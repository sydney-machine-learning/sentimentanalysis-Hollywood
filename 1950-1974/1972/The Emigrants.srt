1
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,884
THE EMIGRANTS

2
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,817
"This is a story
of a group of people

3
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,653
who emigrated to North America

4
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:13,241
from their homes in Ljuder parish
in the Swedish province of Småland.

5
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,911
In 1844, the parish of Ljuder
had 1,925 inhabitants.

6
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,081
The population had tripled
in a hundred years.

7
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:23,626
Besides 254 landed farmers
and tenant farmers,

8
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,629
there were 39 artisans,

9
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:30,592
92 landless peasants,
and 11 enlisted soldiers.

10
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:34,304
There were also
274 farmhands, 127 paupers,

11
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:37,515
60 cripples, five halfwits,

12
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,102
three idiots,
three whores, and two thieves.

13
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:45,607
Four men governed the parish by virtue
of their spiritual and temporal offices:

14
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:50,361
Brusander the dean,
Lönnegren the sheriff,

15
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:54,616
Paul Rudeborg, landowner,
lieutenant, and knight,

16
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:59,120
and Per Persson,
churchwarden and storekeeper.

17
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:05,543
It was the same
in all other parishes at the time.

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,145
<i>Let each and every man obey
the authorities above him,</i>

19
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:29,108
for there is no authority
but of God.

20
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:33,404
The powers that be
have been ordained by God.

21
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:37,492
Whosoever therefore resisteth
the authorities

22
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:41,079
resisteth the ordinance of God,

23
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,665
and they that resist

24
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,668
shall receive
to themselves damnation.

25
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,295
For those who have authority

26
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,049
strike fear in the hearts
not of those who do good

27
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,343
but of those who do evil.

28
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,931
Wouldst thou not be afraid
of those in power?

29
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,308
Then do that which is good,

30
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,686
and thou shalt have praise
of the same.

31
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,605
For they are servants of God

32
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,692
and work for thy welfare.

33
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,111
Amen."

34
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,781
I'll have more salted herring.

35
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:01,534
Have some bread.
You can't just eat fish.

36
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,161
Is it good?

37
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,913
Yes.

38
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,584
She salted it last week.

39
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:49,350
How long were you a farmhand, Father,
before you took over here?

40
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,185
Twelve years.

41
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,232
But those 12 years
weren't all in Ålarum?

42
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,526
No, they weren't.

43
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,663
It's no kingdom
you're taking over, son,

44
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:15,710
but it's twice as much land
as I took on 25 years ago.

45
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:28,639
But if you're going to be a farmer,
you'll need a woman too.

46
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,812
I figure I can get
a good one if I want.

47
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,483
Don't brag like that, son.

48
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,399
<i>Kristina!</i>

49
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,751
Eat now.

50
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,048
<i>If only we had a horse,</i>

51
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,342
but the land can't feed one.

52
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,303
You've tilled
all the tillable land.

53
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,930
Hard as we try,
we can't improve our lot.

54
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:23,517
"By the sweat of thy brow
must thou earn thy bread."

55
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,686
That doesn't guarantee
you anything to eat.

56
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,689
Do you have money
for the mortgage?

57
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,150
We're 22 <i>riksdaler</i> short.

58
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,196
Kristina thinks I can borrow
from her uncle in Kärragärde.

59
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,865
You can borrow from me.

60
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,373
I have to tell Robert
about the cat.

61
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:47,500
She won't last much longer.

62
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,315
Something on your mind?

63
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,361
Snow at the end of April,

64
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,822
and heavy snow at that.

65
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,035
Doesn't bode well
for this year's crop.

66
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,038
No, it doesn't.

67
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,290
When will we sow now?

68
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,296
If the crops fail again this year,
I don't know what we'll do.

69
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,007
We must believe
that God will make them grow.

70
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,800
Believe!

71
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,844
If believing helped...

72
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,515
we could harvest
a hundred bushels of rye by the fall.

73
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:12,561
We break our backs,
but we're still losing ground.

74
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,273
After four years
we still have no oxen,

75
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:19,527
and we're 70 <i>riksdaler</i>
deeper in debt.

76
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,667
Grant us suitable weather...

77
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,630
and preserve the earth's bounty
from ruin of every kind.

78
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,509
Bless us with barley and grain.

79
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,097
Through Jesus Christ
our Lord, amen.

80
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:25,134
Karl Oskar, we better not.

81
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,386
What's wrong?

82
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,264
I'm thinking of the children.

83
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,226
They're all asleep.

84
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,937
I mean... I was thinking

85
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,315
about food for the children.

86
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,983
Food?

87
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,946
I mean, maybe we shouldn't.

88
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,699
Then there wouldn't be any more.

89
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:52,453
"Maybe we shouldn't"?
For the rest of our lives?

90
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,165
Are we to stay away
from each other forever?

91
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,876
I could never do that...

92
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,964
not until I'm so old
that moss grows out of my ears.

93
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,645
<i>Can't you work
for your food and clothing?</i>

94
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,399
You're 15 now, aren't you?
You're strong and healthy.

95
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:49,319
- You can't stay here any longer.
- It's high time you worked.

96
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:52,406
Karl Oskar has
enough mouths to feed.

97
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,742
Shame on you!

98
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,995
Your sister's been a farm servant
for years and has never complained.

99
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,337
What's that book?

100
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,259
Natural sciences.
The schoolmaster gave it to me.

101
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,429
Rinaldo said
he was good at reading.

102
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:21,852
He always said
everyone should read the Bible

103
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,937
and natural sciences.

104
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,523
This tells you all there is to know

105
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,317
about the world.

106
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,611
It tells you about the body,

107
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,321
about water.

108
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,072
Listen:

109
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:38,118
"You can hold
wood or rock in your hand...

110
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,622
but you can't do that with water.

111
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,793
For water is fluid
and follows its own course.

112
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:51,006
All fluid things
like water, ale, beer, or milk

113
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,009
can form drops
and are called liquids,

114
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,303
because they're wet."

115
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,730
Well, if it isn't

116
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,442
our little farmhand!

117
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:02,406
Didn't find your way to Nybacken
this morning, did you!

118
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,243
Stop.

119
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:13,000
You deserve a good thrashing,

120
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,504
but this time I'll let you off
with a box to the ears.

121
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,822
Bedbugs.

122
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,211
I'll teach you to hurry it up!

123
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:28,148
Aren't you going
to teach Robert too, Arvid?

124
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:32,694
Will you and the heifer
see the pastor soon

125
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,988
to announce your engagement?

126
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:03,350
<i>"Notable grasses found abroad
include sugarcane,</i>

127
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:07,354
<i>which grows six feet high
and as thick as a man's arm."</i>

128
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,898
Read about rice again.

129
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:16,988
"Rice is a cereal cultivated
in unbelievable abundance

130
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,990
in warmer countries.

131
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:23,870
The shelled grains
are brought here as well,

132
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,539
where they're cooked in milk

133
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,584
to make our tasty white
sweet porridge.

134
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:33,588
The best rice comes
from beyond the ocean,

135
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,716
from Carolina in North America."

136
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,470
How wide is the ocean?

137
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,918
It's all the fault
of the Lord's weather.

138
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,046
Don't blaspheme, Karl Oskar.

139
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,595
Is this hay or cat's hair?

140
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:27,642
You took all the rest.
You can take this too.

141
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,687
You're blaspheming!

142
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,275
May God forgive you.

143
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,736
May God forgive you.

144
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,129
What's that you found?

145
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,383
Will we die too?

146
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,218
Yes.

147
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,140
When, Father?

148
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:09,267
Not for a long time.

149
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,615
If it doesn't rain soon,

150
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,658
we'll have no milk.

151
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:33,166
Remember all the vole hills
we had last year?

152
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,766
Where'd you get that?

153
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:53,269
Aron's keg. I usually take
part of my wages in liquor.

154
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:06,199
Aron said there'll be
a catechism meeting here next week.

155
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:10,245
Last year the dean asked
who our lords and masters were,

156
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,455
but I couldn't answer.

157
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,793
"Our lords and masters are all those,
together with our parents,

158
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,629
whom God has given
fatherly dominion over us,

159
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:22,715
such as authorities,
teachers, and governors."

160
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,801
Lord a-mercy!

161
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:31,015
You know how many
lords and masters we have

162
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,976
in all the world?

163
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,269
No.

164
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,397
First there's the king, Oscar I.

165
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:41,526
Second is the county governor.
Third is the chief constable.

166
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:45,738
Fourth and fifth are
Sheriff Lönnegren and his deputy.

167
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,324
Sixth is our dean.

168
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,578
And seventh is Aron, our master.

169
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,914
Lord a-mercy!
What a heap of masters!

170
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,587
You know it now
in case they ask next time?

171
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,133
First...

172
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,136
is the king.

173
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,389
What was his name?
- Oscar I.

174
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,809
Then there's —

175
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,022
The county governor.

176
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,774
The county governor.

177
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,153
Then comes the chief constable?

178
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,116
Then there's the dean.

179
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,292
King Oscar I.

180
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,587
Then comes...

181
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,464
the county governor...

182
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,478
Arvid, what are you doing up?

183
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,815
Chopping wood
in the middle of the night?

184
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,942
The old lady will die tonight.

185
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,944
Put the axe down.

186
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:50,029
I'll kill the old crone!

187
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,907
You're out of your mind!
Put that down!

188
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,993
I'll split her snout,
the old bitch!

189
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,914
Listen to me!

190
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,713
Let go!

191
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,174
Listen to me!

192
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,552
You'll just get in trouble!

193
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,432
You don't know what you're doing!
- Let go, I said!

194
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,267
Let go!

195
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,413
Come inside now.

196
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,459
You know
what they accuse me of?

197
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,252
Yes.

198
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,296
It's not true.

199
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,758
That old bitch made it all up.

200
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,094
I've never done
anything unlawful with the heifer.

201
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,889
I believe you.

202
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:02,185
I've never believed
what they accuse you of.

203
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,104
- Know what they call me?
- No.

204
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,400
The bull of Nybacken.

205
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,654
No wonder none of the girls
wants anything

206
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,656
to do with me.

207
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,411
Arvid...

208
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:23,289
I have a secret...

209
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:26,459
and you're the only one
I'm going to tell.

210
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,628
Can I trust you?

211
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,302
You can't say a word to anyone.

212
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:46,145
I'll keep mum,
even if they cut my head off.

213
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,650
I'm going to run away.

214
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:53,027
Run away?

215
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:57,573
In the fall, when they drive
the timber to Karlshamn.

216
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:00,451
I'll catch a ship there
that sails to America.

217
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,537
Will you come with me?

218
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,748
Will you come?
- Yes.

219
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,009
Look at this.

220
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,557
"Description of the United States
of North America,

221
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,852
along with information
and advice for emigrants."

222
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:34,235
In America they're not divided
into gentry and commoners, like here.

223
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,530
You can even address
the president informally.

224
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,121
The best rice comes
from Carolina in North America.

225
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,876
And salted herring
is absolutely forbidden as food.

226
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:54,964
"In America no one works
more than 12 hours a day.

227
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,384
Many slaves have
better dwellings, food, clothing,

228
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,971
and working conditions
than most peasants in Europe.

229
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:06,142
They have their own hens and pigs
and can grow what they like

230
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,895
and sell the yield
for their own profit."

231
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:12,231
I'll sell myself as a slave there.

232
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,692
It's forbidden
for white folk to do that.

233
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:18,404
Forbidden? You just said
America's a free country.

234
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:22,074
Well, that trade
is forbidden for white folk.

235
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,831
I'll go with you all the same.

236
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,255
How much is passage?

237
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,925
About 200 <i>riksdaler.</i>

238
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,594
Jesus!

239
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,723
Two hundred <i>riksdaler!</i>

240
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:49,435
I'll never scrape that together.
- You won't?

241
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:53,105
We forgot: We can go overland!

242
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,734
No, you can't walk to America.

243
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,945
Isn't there any way?

244
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,948
No, it can't be done.
America's an island.

245
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,289
Goddamn ocean!

246
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,068
Last year the crops rotted.

247
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,737
This year they're burning up.

248
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,370
This might get us
through Christmas,

249
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,957
but what do we make
bread from then?

250
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,104
When will we die, Mother?

251
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,648
Nobody knows. Only God.

252
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:21,027
Father said
we're all going to die.

253
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:29,535
A few drops.
Maybe we'll get a shower after all.

254
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,334
No, don't do that.

255
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,683
The barn's on fire!

256
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:55,186
It set fire to the barn!

257
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,858
You got your way.
That was your punishment.

258
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:12,930
There was nothing we could do.

259
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:15,391
That bit of rain didn't help.

260
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:47,524
Playing dollhouse, my little friend?

261
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,655
Dodging work are you,
you lazy devil!

262
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:43,956
What's wrong?

263
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,089
What is it?

264
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,260
My ear hurts bad.

265
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,306
What am I going to do?

266
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:05,477
We can try some liquor
on a wad of wool.

267
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:14,653
It will sting at first,
but it'll pass quickly.

268
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:28,000
There.

269
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,768
It's a little better.

270
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:53,400
But it's still roaring.

271
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:58,322
It sounds like
a whole ocean in there.

272
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,708
Can you hear it?

273
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:12,878
No.

274
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:32,624
<i>You're back already?</i>

275
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:37,463
Karl Oskar?

276
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,029
What is it?

277
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:09,203
I broke the plow
on a huge goddamn rock.

278
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,998
The earth here is cursed.

279
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:15,667
There's no need
to swear and blaspheme.

280
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,669
It's not like you.

281
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,339
You can fix the plow, can't you?

282
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:26,220
Everything goes wrong
no matter how we break our backs.

283
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:33,018
And there are
more and more of us.

284
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:36,146
We must leave
our worries to God.

285
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,901
I'm not sure he'll feed the children
if we sit twiddling our thumbs.

286
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:45,280
Is it God's duty to feed
all the children you're the cause of?

287
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:48,450
What do you mean?

288
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:53,539
I mean you shouldn't blame the Lord
when you make your wife pregnant.

289
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:56,291
But darling...

290
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,879
I've never denied
that I have a share in that.

291
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:04,132
You complain that there are
more and more of us

292
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:06,552
as if it were my fault!

293
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:09,221
I've never blamed you!

294
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:14,726
When you never say a word to me,
what am I to think?

295
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,815
Surely you know
that you and the children

296
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,067
mean the world to me.

297
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,946
Do you care about me
the way you used to?

298
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:28,323
Of course I do.

299
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:37,749
We have to stick together.

300
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:41,003
We have to help ourselves,

301
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,589
because no one else is going to.

302
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,475
Poor child.
What a beating he gave you!

303
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,188
Come in, Karl Oskar.

304
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:03,400
Look.

305
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:05,611
Who did that?

306
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:08,614
- Aron.
- Why?

307
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:12,826
I bumped into a wall yesterday
with a load of turnips

308
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:17,456
and broke a bar on the wagon,
and he beat me with a fence post.

309
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:19,541
I'm not going back.

310
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:23,545
Aron won't let him go just like that.

311
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,425
He was hired for the year.

312
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,136
Aron will send for the sheriff.

313
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,096
I'm not going back.

314
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,057
You don't have to.

315
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:37,893
No one in our family
has to take a flogging.

316
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,312
We're just as good as Aron.

317
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:43,774
Wouldn't it be better
to patch things up with Aron?

318
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:49,154
I'll go talk to him.
You stay here.

319
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,726
Come in your brother's place,
have you?

320
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,521
Now I have a proper farmhand.

321
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,857
You can find
another farmhand to beat.

322
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:28,276
You're not getting
any more from my family.

323
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:30,570
The sheriff will bring him back.

324
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:33,740
Let me go!

325
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,660
Come get him yourself.

326
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:39,871
You're welcome
to come to Korpamoen.

327
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:15,157
I'm looking for your brother,
the farmhand Robert Nilsson.

328
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:16,908
He's not here.

329
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:49,483
If your brother stays here
in my district,

330
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:51,443
I'll get him.

331
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,038
Go inside now.

332
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:23,058
<i>...and everything's left
for me to do.</i>

333
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,560
You said you'd handle it.

334
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,813
Now I'll have to do it myself.

335
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:30,148
Well, answer!

336
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:34,277
<i>Shut your trap!
I've had enough of your nagging!</i>

337
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,696
<i>Goddamn bitch!</i>

338
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:41,034
You could help now and then,
but you never do. You hear me?

339
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:44,830
<i>I'm sick and tired of you!
Shut up!</i>

340
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:48,291
<i>Shut your mouth, you old witch!</i>

341
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:01,680
Hell and damnation!

342
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:06,643
The devil take her!

343
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:21,950
Lönnegren's a decent guy
all the same.

344
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,536
I could see his point.

345
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:28,874
You can stay with Kristina's parents
at Duvemåla for now.

346
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,376
That's outside
Lönnegren's district.

347
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:34,045
We can think up something later.

348
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:37,883
You're kind, Karl Oskar.

349
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,141
Now I have something else
to ask of you.

350
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:49,603
Sure, if I can give it to you.

351
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:56,026
I want to take out
my share in the farm.

352
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:59,404
I'm going to North America.

353
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:13,126
Surprised you, didn't I?

354
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,887
I never dreamed
you had the same idea as me.

355
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:27,098
Look at this.
It's a wheat field in —

356
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:30,769
A wheat field in North America.

357
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:33,355
"Hardworking farmers
have excellent prospects

358
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,899
in the United States

359
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:37,776
of North America."

360
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,446
What do you think?

361
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:50,413
We may have to work
just as hard as here...

362
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,292
but there we can prosper
from our work,

363
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,587
which we can't do here,
no matter how we try.

364
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:59,464
Look at Father.

365
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,718
And what's to become
of the children here?

366
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,098
Johan can take over the farm,

367
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:10,558
but what about the others?

368
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:12,978
Farmhands,
or peasants with no land.

369
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:17,232
Will you take responsibility
for taking them across the ocean...

370
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:20,402
and putting their lives in danger?

371
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,118
If only someone else
had gone before us,

372
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:31,788
but no one
from around here has.

373
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,958
Then I'll have to be the first.

374
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:37,836
You'll take that responsibility?

375
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,963
Someone has to...

376
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,424
in all things.

377
00:55:55,228 --> 00:56:01,609
INTERROGATION
OF FARMER DANJEL ANDREASSON

378
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,696
<i>Do you admit,
Danjel Andreasson,</i>

379
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:07,699
<i>that the following persons
lodge in your house:</i>

380
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:10,910
<i>soldier Severius Pihl,
dishonorably discharged,</i>

381
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:13,747
<i>handicapped servant girl
Sissa Svensdotter,</i>

382
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:17,042
and spinster
Ulrika of Västergöhl

383
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,294
and her illegitimate daughter Elin,

384
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:22,047
and that you conduct
meetings in your home

385
00:56:22,172 --> 00:56:24,424
with your house folk and neighbors?

386
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,593
That is true, Dean.

387
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,720
What do you do
at these meetings?

388
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,639
I do what the clergy do not do.

389
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:33,892
I preach the true word of God.

390
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:37,270
It's the devil whispering
answers in your ear!

391
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:43,359
In the presence
of these upright and trusted men,

392
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:45,570
I hereby forbid you

393
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:47,947
to concern yourself with anything

394
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,075
pertaining to the ministry!

395
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,244
You have no power to forbid me.

396
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:56,247
Do you acknowledge
that my authority comes from God?

397
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:58,458
No, Dean.

398
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,668
Do you refuse
to obey law and order?

399
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:04,089
There is no law over the righteous.

400
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:10,261
Are you filled with such spiritual pride
that you call yourself righteous?

401
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:12,889
I'm filled with God's spirit.

402
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:15,725
The guiding precepts
for my conduct are the Bible

403
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,936
and the dictates of my conscience.

404
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:21,689
Is it true you have accused me
of leading souls astray

405
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:24,442
and leading them
headlong into hell?

406
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,070
Yes, sir. Is it not true

407
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:30,281
that you sell liquor
from the parsonage distillery?

408
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:33,201
It's my lawful right
as owner of the farm.

409
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:35,912
When people get drunk
on your liquor

410
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:38,081
and commit violence,

411
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:40,959
fornication, and other offenses
against God's commandments,

412
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:46,965
do not those who thus break
God's commandments incur hellfire?

413
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:50,802
<i>You</i> have been summoned
for questioning, not me!

414
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,848
In the presence of these witnesses,

415
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:58,476
I forbid you to trespass
upon the holy ministry.

416
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:02,021
Should you persist
in this criminal practice,

417
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:04,649
you can be tried by a court of law,

418
00:58:04,774 --> 00:58:06,985
fined, and imprisoned
on bread and water,

419
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,655
and, upon a third offense, banished
from the kingdom for two years!

420
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:15,910
But you cannot
for one moment banish me

421
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,996
from God's kingdom.

422
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:21,249
"Despite the warning,

423
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:25,211
Danjel Andreasson continued
his unlawful preaching.

424
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:29,132
Dean Brusander therefore invoked
church discipline against him

425
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:32,927
and banished him
from the Lord's Holy Communion

426
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:36,514
and the fellowship of the church."

427
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:44,814
May the body of Christ
that you are about to receive

428
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:48,151
preserve thee unto everlasting life.

429
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:52,739
May the blood of Christ
that you are about to receive

430
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:56,034
preserve thee unto everlasting life.

431
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:08,671
May the body of Christ
that you are about to receive

432
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:12,300
preserve thee unto everlasting life.

433
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:19,599
May the blood of Christ
that you are about to receive —

434
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,650
Danjel dear, don't open it!

435
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:33,404
Our Lord Jesus Christ
is with us.

436
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:36,115
We have nothing to fear.

437
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:44,374
Who is it that disturbs
the peace of our house at night?

438
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,668
<i>Sheriff Lönnegren.</i>

439
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:48,628
<i>Open up!</i>

440
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:54,842
Whom do you seek
in my house at this late hour?

441
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:56,803
<i>You yourself, Danjel Andreasson.</i>

442
00:59:57,095 --> 01:00:00,848
<i>In the name of the law,
I order you to open this door.</i>

443
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:05,061
I do not obey the law of man
that you mention.

444
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:09,190
<i>If you won't open the door,
it's my duty to break it down.</i>

445
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:12,902
Then I will spare you

446
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,405
from adding to your burden of guilt

447
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,574
by committing violence
in the presence of the Lord.

448
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:37,385
What are these folk doing here
in the middle of the night?

449
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:41,055
We are gathered
for a love feast.

450
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,891
Poor misguided souls!
You defile the Holy Sacrament!

451
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,894
We are partaking
of the blessed sacraments.

452
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:52,567
You can see he's administering
Holy Communion to these creatures.

453
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:55,320
We are all witnesses
to his criminal conduct.

454
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,989
Did you administer
the sacrament to these persons?

455
01:00:58,114 --> 01:00:59,782
Not yet to all.

456
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,826
You interrupted us.

457
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:04,746
But you know no one may give
communion unless ordained.

458
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:07,498
- I know no such thing.
- The dean told you so.

459
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,168
I obey the Holy Scriptures,

460
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:12,128
not the dean.

461
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:14,756
Nowhere in the Bible does it say

462
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:17,383
that our Lord Jesus Christ
was ordained.

463
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:19,927
Don't argue with this hairsplitter!

464
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,638
Take down the names
of all those present.

465
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:28,019
I forbade you once
to concern yourself

466
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:30,646
with matters
belonging to the ministry.

467
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:34,233
You will now suffer
the full force of the law.

468
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:37,820
But I beg you all once again
to consider your immortal souls.

469
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,490
If you repent of your errors,

470
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,992
I will receive you back
into the church.

471
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:45,703
Away with all of you!
You darken the room,

472
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,164
standing there black and evil
as Satan himself!

473
01:01:54,504 --> 01:01:56,631
I see that your heart
remains unchastened,

474
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:59,509
yet you take Christ's blood
to your unclean lips!

475
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:02,220
I'm not afraid of you,
you pot-bellied parson!

476
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:05,056
- You'd insult the dean, Ulrika?
- Mind yourself...

477
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:07,642
or I'll insult you too!

478
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:10,895
You should wash your mouth out
before addressing the clergy.

479
01:02:11,062 --> 01:02:13,898
With vicarage liquor
or parson's piss, eh?

480
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:18,236
- Hold your tongue, you old whore!
- Did you say whore?

481
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:22,782
If I'm a whore, Per Persson,
then you're a whoremonger!

482
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:26,536
Remember when you came to me
with money in one hand

483
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:28,538
and your prick in the other?

484
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:31,082
When you told me
to lie on my back?

485
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:33,751
You were very amenable then!

486
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:37,922
But that filthy whoremonger

487
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:41,050
isn't forbidden
communion in church!

488
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:45,054
No! Because he's friends
with the pot-bellied parsons,

489
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:48,975
those lazy lumps of lard
wallowing in their own fat!

490
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:54,564
In virtue of your office,
I think you should

491
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:57,608
disperse this assembly
and dismiss those present.

492
01:02:57,733 --> 01:03:00,528
And I strictly forbid you
to continue giving Holy Communion

493
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,155
at this table.

494
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,867
You cannot turn
the Lord Jesus out of my house.

495
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:08,286
You think your ramblings
are revelations from God,

496
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:10,288
but they're from the devil!

497
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:14,625
Get out of here,
bloated lovers of the flesh!

498
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:22,133
<i>In silence must I
endure accusations</i>

499
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:30,016
<i>And walk on in innocence</i>

500
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:39,309
<i>Forgiving and forgetting</i>

501
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:45,031
<i>Sure in the knowledge</i>

502
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:49,744
<i>That God will judge aright</i>

503
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:52,955
"Sentences handed down
in the spring of 1849:

504
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,750
for Danjel Andreasson,
a fine of 200 silver <i>riksdaler.</i>

505
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:59,045
For the others at the meeting,
a fine of 100 silver <i>riksdaler</i>

506
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,839
or 28 days imprisonment
on bread and water."

507
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:07,637
May the body of Christ
that you are about to receive

508
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:12,642
preserve thee unto everlasting life.

509
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:35,790
Can I have some porridge?

510
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,959
Not now.

511
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:42,004
You'll have some this evening,
after your brother's baptism.

512
01:04:47,093 --> 01:04:49,720
I want some porridge.

513
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,014
You can't have any!
Go see Granny.

514
01:04:57,019 --> 01:05:00,314
You'll have porridge this evening,
when company comes

515
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:04,026
and we baptize the little lad.

516
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:12,410
Those children are here again.

517
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:14,912
Poor wretches.
They won't find much.

518
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:37,768
Anna! What are you —
Outside now!

519
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:48,571
Shame on you!

520
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:52,074
Go outside!

521
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:06,922
It's a shame to send them here.
They should keep them at home.

522
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:11,385
We have
no more than they have.

523
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:18,017
You can't eat that.

524
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:21,103
Mother can make soup from it.

525
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:23,230
Soup! No, take this.

526
01:06:23,648 --> 01:06:25,983
Run home now.

527
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:47,254
Father's little helper is here, eh?

528
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,431
Aren't you cold?

529
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:11,028
Run back to Mother now.

530
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,798
Anna!

531
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:53,988
Little one.

532
01:08:08,586 --> 01:08:11,088
You'll be all right soon.

533
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:15,551
I'll wipe your face.

534
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:23,184
Did you stuff your tummy?

535
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:25,770
Her stomach's all swollen.

536
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:30,065
Shouldn't we send
for Berta in Idemo?

537
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,293
Let's see how our little girl is.

538
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:57,802
She's very sick.

539
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:01,972
The grain in the porridge

540
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:04,809
has swollen up to twice its size.

541
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:09,146
Her stomach may have burst,

542
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:12,817
in which case
there's nothing I can do.

543
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,326
We'll have to see
how she is in the morning,

544
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,996
whether she's taken
a turn for the better.

545
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:30,835
If not, I'm afraid God
will take her home to him.

546
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:35,506
Yes, I'm afraid so.

547
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,469
But let's hope she'll get better.

548
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:43,889
You never know what might happen.

549
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:37,401
You've been choosing
timber all day.

550
01:10:37,568 --> 01:10:40,321
Why don't you let me
make the coffin?

551
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:55,586
Why don't you let me
put it together?

552
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:26,241
I'm not against moving
to America anymore.

553
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:13,682
Don't touch the wash
with your filthy fingers.

554
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:18,062
Leave it alone.

555
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:21,523
Don't get it dirty
now that it's clean.

556
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,674
We'd better
take this with us too.

557
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:52,763
Grandpa can keep that one.

558
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,235
"On tracks like these
you travel at great speed —

559
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:10,531
10-20 miles an hour,
and even faster.

560
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:13,909
Many large carriages
are coupled together

561
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:17,454
and pulled along
by a steam engine.

562
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:21,625
Strong wooden crossbeams
are laid on the road,

563
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:24,628
and to these are fastened
strong iron rails,

564
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:27,798
which serve
to guide the carriages.

565
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,592
Each carriage
is furnished so comfortably

566
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:33,137
that it makes disembarking
unnecessary,

567
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:35,264
even on long journeys.

568
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:38,100
These railroads,
which with the aid of steam

569
01:14:38,225 --> 01:14:41,478
allow one to enjoy
a comfortable and exciting journey,

570
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:45,274
now cover a distance
of 8,000 miles in America."

571
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:51,697
You can gather enough
winter fodder for a cow in two days,

572
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:54,199
and for a horse in three.

573
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,660
I'm wondering
about those railroads.

574
01:14:56,785 --> 01:14:58,871
If they lie out on the ground

575
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:01,165
unguarded night and day,

576
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,792
doesn't the iron get stolen?

577
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:08,213
No, they have so much iron there
that no one bothers to steal

578
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,174
so much as a filing.

579
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:12,718
It's the same with gold and silver.

580
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:16,221
In America
they hang a thief straight off...

581
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,516
usually before
he's had time to confess.

582
01:15:20,184 --> 01:15:23,520
Americans are the most honest
and upright people in the world.

583
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,442
I expect they have
a few bastards there too.

584
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,708
- You're taking a lot of folk.
- There'll be six of us.

585
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:46,627
There'll be more.

586
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:49,546
You'll have more descendants
than you know.

587
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:53,717
And you never asked your children's
or grandchildren's opinion.

588
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:58,013
- I'm thinking of my children.
- And I'm thinking of mine.

589
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:02,851
Ever since you could unbutton
your britches to piss,

590
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:06,563
you've never asked your parents
for advice or help.

591
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:11,235
And one shouldn't give
unsolicited advice.

592
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,496
Does your ear hurt?

593
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:25,916
It'll be better
once we get to America.

594
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:34,299
I read in the paper yesterday
about a man who got home

595
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,970
and found his whole family
had been eaten by a crocodile.

596
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:44,017
It had eaten three children
and just swallowed his wife,

597
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:47,729
but her head
got stuck in its throat,

598
01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:49,815
so it choked to death.

599
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:52,109
That was her revenge.

600
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:55,654
The ground all around
was soaked in human blood.

601
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:59,116
Are we going to those parts?

602
01:16:59,241 --> 01:17:02,286
You should know
Robert's imagination by now.

603
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:05,289
It's not my imagination.
I read it.

604
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:56,840
Could it be the sheriff?

605
01:17:59,593 --> 01:18:01,178
Who is it?

606
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:04,056
<i>It's Uncle Danjel.
May I come in?</i>

607
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:11,563
<i>God's peace on your house.</i>
- Something wrong at home?

608
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,858
No, all is well
with my wife and children.

609
01:18:16,193 --> 01:18:18,195
What is it, then?

610
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,864
What is it?

611
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,203
I have a message for you,
Karl Oskar.

612
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:28,789
From whom?

613
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,376
From God.

614
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:37,506
The Lord woke me tonight
and said...

615
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:42,386
"Go to Karl Oskar at Korpamoen,
husband to thy dear niece."

616
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:48,100
He spoke to me as he once spoke
to Abraham. He said...

617
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:51,603
"Go forth from thy fatherland

618
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:54,606
and from thy kindred,
and from thy father's house,

619
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:57,734
unto a land
that I will show thee.

620
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,737
Go to Karl Oskar at Korpamoen.

621
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,115
He shall help thee."

622
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,159
Are you coming
to America with us, Uncle?

623
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:11,581
We are living
in a time of persecution

624
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:14,084
in the land of my fathers.

625
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:16,920
I'm prevented
from serving my God.

626
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:20,006
I've been banished
from the land.

627
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:23,260
But the Lord will open
a new land to me.

628
01:19:23,427 --> 01:19:25,387
We shall go there together,

629
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,931
and none of us shall know fear.

630
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:31,601
So there would be
six of you, right?

631
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:33,770
Eight...

632
01:19:34,146 --> 01:19:36,940
counting children and household.

633
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,152
You're taking your lodgers too?

634
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:43,655
Yes, Ulrika and her girl
are coming.

635
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,574
I promised them.

636
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:52,038
Would you have use
for a farmhand, Uncle?

637
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:53,790
I would indeed.

638
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:57,711
The last one ran off
when the persecution started.

639
01:19:57,836 --> 01:20:00,797
I know one who'd be
a great help in America.

640
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:03,175
His name's Arvid.

641
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:08,680
We shall place everything
in God's hands.

642
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:12,476
He will aid us
with all his mighty power

643
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:16,146
to make it
across the perilous sea.

644
01:20:19,107 --> 01:20:23,236
You'll set a bad example
for my other parishioners,

645
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:25,405
Karl Oskar Nilsson.

646
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:29,701
You're seen as an energetic
and hardworking farmer.

647
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:33,079
Surely you can support yourself
in your native district.

648
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,916
It seems I can't, Dean.

649
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:40,128
You have the bare necessities
for your household.

650
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:44,382
Man should be content
with the bare necessities.

651
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:48,803
Have you given sufficient thought
to this adventure

652
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,723
that you and your family
are setting off on?

653
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:54,309
Do you know
the truth about the country

654
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,520
that so beckons to you?

655
01:20:56,645 --> 01:20:59,064
Are you sure
you haven't been misled?

656
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:02,901
Or tricked by fantasies
and delusions?

657
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:06,279
This could be the ruin
of you and yours,

658
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:08,657
and I therefore
advise against it.

659
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:12,410
You do know
I'm thinking of your welfare?

660
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:14,996
I'm sure you mean well, sir.

661
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:18,750
At least think of your parents.
Your father is a cripple.

662
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,002
The old folks are taken care of.

663
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:26,508
You're possessed by a spirit
of discontent and blinded by lies —

664
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:29,177
I've sold everything off
and am now free.

665
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:32,180
Perhaps I could have
my business settled now?

666
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:43,900
You shall have
your permit to emigrate.

667
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,547
Now I pray God
to bless you and yours

668
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:08,091
on your voyage
to this faraway land.

669
01:22:08,258 --> 01:22:12,721
May you never have cause
to regret your bold decision.

670
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:16,266
My humble thanks, Dean.

671
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:20,914
Mother!

672
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:38,098
That's enough!

673
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:42,686
- That's enough.
- What? A little more!

674
01:23:42,811 --> 01:23:43,937
No.

675
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:58,326
Aren't we going soon?

676
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:51,963
Who knows what trash
they wear on their feet in America,

677
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:56,259
but I needn't be ashamed
of showing these there.

678
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,430
They weren't cheap.

679
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:05,518
Who'd have thought so many
would emigrate all at once?

680
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:07,771
And now Jonas Petter too.

681
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:10,774
There's something
I have to tell you.

682
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:14,944
I'm in that way again.

683
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:18,156
I see.

684
01:25:25,622 --> 01:25:28,416
It couldn't come
at a more inopportune time.

685
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,250
What?

686
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:32,629
I mean it's awkward,
coming just now.

687
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:35,089
I can't be with child
when it suits you!

688
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:36,966
Don't take it like that.

689
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,804
It's not my fault alone!
It's yours too!

690
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:44,808
More than mine! You come to me
at the "inopportune" time!

691
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:47,268
Why are you getting so upset?

692
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:50,396
You're afraid I'll be a burden!

693
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:52,482
I never said that!

694
01:25:52,982 --> 01:25:57,403
I'm just afraid it will make it
harder for you now.

695
01:25:57,529 --> 01:25:59,823
We have to stick together

696
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:01,616
or we'll never make it.

697
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:05,328
Let's be friends this last evening
at home, all right?

698
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:07,622
Yes, of course.

699
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:10,166
I'm just not well.

700
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:13,294
I know, I know.

701
01:26:13,837 --> 01:26:15,630
You must speak gently to me.

702
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:17,715
No harsh words, I promise.

703
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,733
Go slowly through the gate!

704
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:31,367
Lucky you're so slender,
or I'd have to run alongside.

705
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:13,886
Arvid, when we get
to Karlshamn,

706
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:16,973
I'm going to buy
a book for learning English.

707
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:20,852
I figure I can learn it
during the voyage.

708
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:24,564
You can borrow it if you like.
- I don't need it.

709
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:27,525
You can't speak English, can you?

710
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:31,654
Not yet, but when I step ashore
in America, I'll be able to.

711
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:38,494
You'll speak it properly
the minute you set foot ashore?

712
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:40,079
Yes.

713
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:44,000
Who said so?

714
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,751
Uncle Danjel.

715
01:31:45,877 --> 01:31:49,922
You have to learn it,
because you're not living in the spirit,

716
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:51,841
but the rest of us needn't.

717
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:55,678
- Can that really be true?
- You think Danjel tells lies?

718
01:31:56,345 --> 01:31:57,680
No.

719
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:02,894
When we go ashore, the faithful
will be filled with the Holy Ghost,

720
01:32:03,019 --> 01:32:05,688
just like the apostles
at Pentecost.

721
01:32:05,855 --> 01:32:08,524
And all who are reborn
in Jesus Christ

722
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:12,320
will speak American fluently
the moment they step ashore.

723
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:14,864
You never read
the Acts of the Apostles?

724
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,200
Sure...

725
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:22,622
but I've never heard of being filled
with the Holy Ghost like that.

726
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,713
Robert...

727
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:33,674
I'm afraid of America.

728
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:36,093
Afraid? Why?

729
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:39,513
Maybe they're mean
to newcomers there.

730
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,432
No.

731
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:45,603
You needn't be afraid.
They have so few women in America

732
01:32:45,728 --> 01:32:48,439
that they treat them like gold
and precious stones.

733
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:52,026
You'll be pampered like a baby
and given anything you want.

734
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,737
...they have a steam wagon
that pulls everything,

735
01:32:54,862 --> 01:32:57,698
and so that the wagons in back
don't slip off,

736
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:00,243
they attach hooks —

737
01:33:28,271 --> 01:33:30,273
The peace of God be with you!

738
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:37,613
Well, the vicar lay there

739
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:41,575
with his rod sticking up
as stiff as a church candle.

740
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:44,078
They couldn't bury him like that,

741
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:47,164
so they called in
all the other churchmen.

742
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:49,292
Dean Stenmark himself was there.

743
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:52,461
They read over him,
but it wouldn't go down.

744
01:33:52,628 --> 01:33:55,840
Satan wouldn't leave his body.
It just stayed that way.

745
01:33:55,965 --> 01:34:00,303
Well, along came
his old housekeeper, Magda,

746
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:02,930
and asked
if she could have a try,

747
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:05,850
so they let her in
where the body was kept.

748
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:09,895
She was in there all night,
and in the morning

749
01:34:10,021 --> 01:34:14,150
there he lay just like all other men
who are to be buried.

750
01:34:15,443 --> 01:34:18,571
I wonder if we'll be
seasick on the ship.

751
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:20,990
It's not so bad.

752
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:23,326
You just throw up a bit.

753
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:27,413
Like when
you're in the family way.

754
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,291
They say it's so painful.

755
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:32,501
Don't you remember

756
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,920
what I said, Inga-Lena?

757
01:34:35,504 --> 01:34:39,550
Have you forgotten what I told you?
- Of course not, Danjel dear.

758
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:41,719
Those who have Christ within them

759
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:43,929
need not fear that sickness.

760
01:34:44,055 --> 01:34:47,224
They can bear the sea,
even if they're not used to it.

761
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:49,894
I believe you. I'm not afraid.

762
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:54,023
You don't think you'll get seasick
like everyone else?

763
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,983
No, Karl Oskar.

764
01:34:56,108 --> 01:34:59,695
Our Lord Jesus Christ
died on the cross for my sins.

765
01:35:00,363 --> 01:35:02,490
You're a doubter, Karl Oskar.

766
01:35:02,615 --> 01:35:04,867
I've heard that married women

767
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:08,162
get seasick
more than other women.

768
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:11,832
Not if they live in the spirit,
Jonas Petter.

769
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:15,419
But most women live in the flesh.

770
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:19,215
They can spawn bastards
even in the marriage bed.

771
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:24,929
But aren't scurvy and cholera
worse than seasickness?

772
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:27,723
- What are they?
- I heard that —

773
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,560
Let us give thanks to God
on this first day of our journey.

774
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,523
We thank thee, Lord,

775
01:35:35,648 --> 01:35:38,442
for holding thy hand over us

776
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:40,945
on this first day of our journey.

777
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:18,667
INTERMISSION

778
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,043
Johan!

779
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:10,970
- Where are our berths?
- [ Speaking Danish ] Let's see.

780
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:13,764
You and you...

781
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:16,267
come away from there.

782
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:20,229
- Karl Oskar!
- Coming!

783
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:29,446
Here?

784
01:38:33,576 --> 01:38:36,120
I want a berth with my family.

785
01:38:36,245 --> 01:38:38,247
I don't understand
what you're saying.

786
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:43,252
May I speak to the captain?

787
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:05,566
The beasts in my barn
have more room.

788
01:39:05,691 --> 01:39:07,276
It's just greed.

789
01:40:35,489 --> 01:40:37,074
PASSENGERS AND CARGO

790
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:00,723
Nice to get some fresh air.

791
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,266
Sure is.

792
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:54,359
I counted 16.

793
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:56,653
Me too.

794
01:41:57,863 --> 01:42:00,616
- Shall we pace her out?
- Sure.

795
01:42:20,469 --> 01:42:22,471
So far and no further.

796
01:42:23,764 --> 01:42:25,641
We're not allowed any further.

797
01:42:25,766 --> 01:42:28,143
- How many did you count?
- Thirty-six.

798
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:29,478
Me too.

799
01:42:41,114 --> 01:42:43,116
What if the sea rises?

800
01:42:43,242 --> 01:42:44,952
We'll all drown.

801
01:42:47,663 --> 01:42:48,997
No.

802
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:53,669
If the sea rises,
so does the ship.

803
01:43:12,813 --> 01:43:15,524
How many are there of you?

804
01:43:15,732 --> 01:43:19,361
Don't all come running.
One person per family.

805
01:43:20,946 --> 01:43:23,490
They keep popping out babies,
these people!

806
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:25,158
Come here.

807
01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:28,495
And bring something
to carry the food in.

808
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,205
You can't just jump in line.

809
01:43:31,707 --> 01:43:32,749
That's enough.

810
01:43:44,303 --> 01:43:47,723
- Don't we get any potatoes?
- There are none.

811
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:50,517
No milk either?

812
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:53,228
We don't have goats on board.

813
01:43:56,023 --> 01:43:59,693
I don't want to be on the boat.
I want to be home.

814
01:44:23,884 --> 01:44:26,887
We don't get any potatoes.
They don't have any.

815
01:44:27,012 --> 01:44:29,181
They gave us
pickled cabbage instead.

816
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:34,144
- No milk either?
- No, not for the whole voyage.

817
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:38,023
It reeks of piss here! You need
a clothespin for your nose.

818
01:44:38,899 --> 01:44:42,152
- When can we use the galley?
- Not for a while.

819
01:44:42,277 --> 01:44:46,073
It's more crowded down here
than church on Christmas morning.

820
01:44:47,324 --> 01:44:50,077
- Little Märta's forehead is so hot.
- Is it?

821
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:53,789
- She won't eat anything.
- How are you, little one?

822
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:58,251
You think she caught something
from that girl over there?

823
01:44:58,377 --> 01:44:59,795
No.

824
01:44:59,962 --> 01:45:03,632
I expect it's just a cold.
That girl has quinsy.

825
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,932
She's so close to us!

826
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:13,850
Who?

827
01:45:16,144 --> 01:45:17,688
The Glad One?

828
01:45:17,938 --> 01:45:20,440
Why do they call her
the Glad One?

829
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:23,610
I suppose
because she's never sad.

830
01:45:23,735 --> 01:45:25,737
If any woman should be sad,
it's her.

831
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:28,156
If any woman
should weep blood —

832
01:45:28,323 --> 01:45:30,075
Never mind her.

833
01:45:31,827 --> 01:45:33,870
You're right.
We have other concerns.

834
01:45:33,996 --> 01:45:36,665
I'm so sad
you can't stay here with us.

835
01:45:44,006 --> 01:45:46,633
You ought to like that.
You always loved the swing.

836
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:49,094
We have so little water left,

837
01:45:49,219 --> 01:45:51,555
and you can't ask
the mate for more.

838
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,557
He doesn't like you.

839
01:45:53,682 --> 01:45:56,268
You can have some of our water.

840
01:45:57,019 --> 01:45:59,021
We don't use much.

841
01:46:00,188 --> 01:46:02,149
Thanks very much.

842
01:46:02,274 --> 01:46:05,360
Where are you folks bound for?

843
01:46:06,778 --> 01:46:08,572
We don't quite know yet.

844
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:13,452
What about you?
- We have a son in Minnesota.

845
01:46:14,911 --> 01:46:17,372
- Is it good farming land there?
- Very good.

846
01:46:19,374 --> 01:46:22,044
Our son has a hundred acres.

847
01:46:22,169 --> 01:46:23,462
You don't say.

848
01:46:23,587 --> 01:46:25,630
He's a clever lad.

849
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:30,052
He wrote that he has
a hundred acres.

850
01:46:30,635 --> 01:46:34,056
We're bringing him
a grindstone as a present.

851
01:46:35,724 --> 01:46:38,060
They're very expensive in America.

852
01:46:38,185 --> 01:46:39,728
Is that so?

853
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:45,567
I'm in a bad way myself.
Got a bad heart.

854
01:46:45,692 --> 01:46:47,736
It stops in the morning,

855
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:51,782
but a pinch or two of snuff
gets it going again.

856
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:02,626
It's a real bother...

857
01:47:03,418 --> 01:47:05,170
this thing is.

858
01:47:07,881 --> 01:47:09,925
But it starts up again.

859
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:27,919
"The lips move very little

860
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:31,673
and are neither rounded
nor thrust forward.

861
01:48:32,007 --> 01:48:36,261
It's especially important
not to thrust the lips forward...

862
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:41,933
particularly when making
the difficult sh-sound."

863
01:48:44,644 --> 01:48:46,354
Understand?

864
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:51,985
I'll show you.

865
01:48:56,364 --> 01:48:58,200
You mustn't do that.

866
01:48:58,366 --> 01:49:02,370
I don't stick my lips out like that
when I speak Swedish either.

867
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:08,043
Make the sh-sound in Swedish.

868
01:49:10,212 --> 01:49:12,797
"Seasick."

869
01:49:16,343 --> 01:49:18,720
Don't stick your lips out so far.

870
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:25,518
Say it again.

871
01:49:36,738 --> 01:49:38,531
That's good.

872
01:49:39,407 --> 01:49:44,079
It won't hurt you to learn
a bit of English now.

873
01:49:44,537 --> 01:49:46,581
Then, when you go ashore
in America,

874
01:49:46,706 --> 01:49:49,334
you'll have helped out
the Holy Ghost a bit.

875
01:49:49,459 --> 01:49:51,378
That can't be a sin.

876
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,881
Say...

877
01:49:55,215 --> 01:49:56,758
shine...

878
01:49:57,592 --> 01:49:59,094
shall...

879
01:49:59,761 --> 01:50:01,763
shoot.

880
01:50:24,286 --> 01:50:27,205
You have to learn
the right tongue position too.

881
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:31,793
Stick your tongue out
so I can see.

882
01:50:43,972 --> 01:50:46,975
No, I don't think you'll have
any trouble learning English.

883
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:57,360
Elin, come here.

884
01:50:58,403 --> 01:51:00,530
Come help out here.

885
01:52:14,813 --> 01:52:18,233
<i>...it began to bleed,
and he passed out.</i>

886
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,402
<i>But she'd already prepared</i>

887
01:52:20,777 --> 01:52:23,613
a decoction
of wild rosemary and bloodroot.

888
01:52:23,738 --> 01:52:26,408
She stopped the bleeding,

889
01:52:26,533 --> 01:52:29,119
and when he came to,
it had stopped.

890
01:52:29,244 --> 01:52:33,123
He became
a bit slow and dimwitted,

891
01:52:33,248 --> 01:52:36,459
but devoted to her all the same.

892
01:52:36,584 --> 01:52:40,255
She saved what she had
cut off and dried it

893
01:52:40,422 --> 01:52:43,508
and took it out
sometimes for company

894
01:52:43,633 --> 01:52:45,885
on special occasions and such.

895
01:52:46,094 --> 01:52:48,763
They say he still had a bit left,

896
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:52,142
and that's why
they called him Stumpy.

897
01:52:52,267 --> 01:52:54,978
And that's as true
as I sit here.

898
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,733
This is the life.

899
01:53:01,151 --> 01:53:03,194
No goddamn farmer
waking you up

900
01:53:03,319 --> 01:53:06,448
in the middle of the night
to feed the horses.

901
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:12,162
And plenty of food too,
so your belly's good and full.

902
01:53:13,455 --> 01:53:15,999
I'm damned lucky I came along.

903
01:53:20,879 --> 01:53:23,298
I'll go ask
how much further it is.

904
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,181
How much further
to North America?

905
01:53:31,473 --> 01:53:35,477
It's as far from here to there
as from there to here,

906
01:53:35,602 --> 01:53:37,812
with a difference
of about 50 miles.

907
01:53:42,984 --> 01:53:44,944
You goddamn sheep's cunt!

908
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:49,449
We peasants are no more stupid
than folks like you that sail the sea.

909
01:55:57,452 --> 01:55:59,871
What's wrong?
You're not sick, are you?

910
01:55:59,996 --> 01:56:02,624
I'm covered in lice!

911
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:05,376
Dear God in heaven!

912
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:08,796
Don't look at me!
It's so awful!

913
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:11,341
Darling, don't cry.

914
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:15,303
I've never had a single louse
in my whole life.

915
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:17,972
We've always been so clean,

916
01:56:18,097 --> 01:56:21,059
and I come out here to sea
and get them!

917
01:56:21,184 --> 01:56:24,520
Don't take it so hard.
You didn't bring them.

918
01:56:24,646 --> 01:56:27,982
You must have caught them
from another passenger.

919
01:56:34,113 --> 01:56:37,325
It's you, you old whore!
You've given us all lice!

920
01:56:37,659 --> 01:56:41,079
All your men have spread
your vermin all around the parish.

921
01:56:41,204 --> 01:56:44,582
Now you'd spread them
to America too?

922
01:56:45,625 --> 01:56:50,588
So your wife brought her lice
along from home.

923
01:56:51,673 --> 01:56:55,176
They couldn't bear to be separated
from such a fine woman.

924
01:56:55,301 --> 01:56:57,720
Admonish your wife, not me!

925
01:56:57,845 --> 01:57:01,182
Now we're going to have it out,
Kristina of Korpamoen!

926
01:57:01,557 --> 01:57:04,143
You accuse me
of infesting this ship.

927
01:57:04,268 --> 01:57:06,562
You accuse me
of having vermin!

928
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,899
Danjel, she's reviled
the body of Christ

929
01:57:10,024 --> 01:57:11,943
and his pure, innocent lamb.

930
01:57:12,068 --> 01:57:13,695
Hold your peace, women.

931
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:16,823
She accuses me
when she herself is full of lice.

932
01:57:16,948 --> 01:57:19,617
Get down on your knees
and apologize!

933
01:57:20,076 --> 01:57:23,496
I'd sooner kneel before Satan himself!

934
01:57:24,205 --> 01:57:25,998
You hear that?
She blasphemes!

935
01:57:26,124 --> 01:57:29,043
Quiet, both of you!
Enough quarreling.

936
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:32,296
Ever since I was born again,
I've been free of lice.

937
01:57:32,422 --> 01:57:36,050
I'll undress to my bare skin.
No one will find a louse on me.

938
01:57:36,175 --> 01:57:39,512
Have you no shame?
You disgrace the very name of woman!

939
01:57:39,637 --> 01:57:42,932
You accused me!
Anyone who likes can look!

940
01:57:43,057 --> 01:57:45,226
Ulrika, beware!

941
01:57:45,393 --> 01:57:48,187
Beware of the temptation of pride!

942
01:57:48,688 --> 01:57:52,233
Your body is
the wondrous work of the Lord.

943
01:57:52,358 --> 01:57:56,070
You mustn't use it
to arouse sinful lusts in men.

944
01:57:56,237 --> 01:57:58,531
I will clear my name!

945
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:02,368
Inga-Lena will check my clothes.
She'll be my unbiased witness.

946
01:58:02,827 --> 01:58:04,954
Come, Inga-Lena.

947
01:58:08,416 --> 01:58:10,168
Now you've done it.

948
01:58:10,293 --> 01:58:12,253
I called her a whore.

949
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,422
That's her proper name.

950
01:58:14,547 --> 01:58:17,425
You shouldn't say
such things about Ulrika.

951
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:22,346
Well, Inga-Lena,
did you find any lice?

952
01:58:22,847 --> 01:58:24,348
No.

953
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:27,226
Even a single nit?

954
01:58:27,935 --> 01:58:29,187
No.

955
01:58:29,312 --> 01:58:31,189
Hear that?

956
01:58:31,314 --> 01:58:33,858
I'm innocent.
Kristina shall kneel to me.

957
01:58:33,983 --> 01:58:37,737
Never!
I'd sooner jump in the ocean!

958
01:58:37,945 --> 01:58:40,990
Down on your knees
or I'll scratch your eyes out!

959
01:58:41,115 --> 01:58:45,203
I won't have you on this ship!
Slut! Whore!

960
01:58:45,328 --> 01:58:47,789
Danjel, look.

961
01:58:48,956 --> 01:58:51,626
Me too. I have...

962
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,555
This creature too
is part of God's creation.

963
01:59:05,264 --> 01:59:08,309
It's been sent as a trial to us...

964
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:11,229
so that we may better ourselves.

965
01:59:13,731 --> 01:59:16,400
Things must be pretty bad
in old Sweden

966
01:59:16,526 --> 01:59:19,695
when even the lice
start emigrating to America.

967
02:00:59,921 --> 02:01:02,632
My dear Inga-Lena...

968
02:01:03,215 --> 02:01:05,468
my dear spouse.

969
02:01:06,427 --> 02:01:10,222
Dear wife, are you seasick?

970
02:01:11,766 --> 02:01:14,226
My dear Danjel, forgive me.

971
02:01:14,352 --> 02:01:16,938
Have you lost your faith?

972
02:01:17,313 --> 02:01:19,607
Have you been listening
to the enemy?

973
02:01:55,351 --> 02:01:57,144
We're sinking!

974
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:02,483
It's just the storm.
Settle down.

975
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:05,027
Can't you feel that we're sinking?

976
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,739
You're just seasick.

977
02:02:09,365 --> 02:02:13,327
Karl Oskar, I can't breathe!

978
02:02:13,744 --> 02:02:15,997
You have as much air as I do.

979
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:18,207
Be quiet now.

980
02:02:36,767 --> 02:02:40,146
<i>In the dark
I can't even see where to vomit.</i>

981
02:02:47,695 --> 02:02:50,531
I drowned a cat once.

982
02:02:51,782 --> 02:02:53,951
It suffered before it died.

983
02:02:54,577 --> 02:02:57,455
You think I can be forgiven?

984
02:02:57,580 --> 02:02:59,498
Don't talk rubbish.

985
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:03,127
I can hear it meowing
down there.

986
02:03:03,919 --> 02:03:05,963
You're just delirious.

987
02:03:08,716 --> 02:03:12,595
Dear God, forgive me.

988
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:15,681
I've been an unfaithful servant.

989
02:03:47,338 --> 02:03:49,048
Let me out!

990
02:04:02,978 --> 02:04:04,855
Come on, Robert.

991
02:04:05,147 --> 02:04:07,274
You can't lie here.

992
02:04:47,231 --> 02:04:51,694
It can't be good for you,
being shut up like a stallion.

993
02:06:16,487 --> 02:06:18,280
Won't you eat a little?

994
02:06:20,616 --> 02:06:23,369
Can you give the children
something to eat?

995
02:06:23,494 --> 02:06:25,746
They get enough to manage.

996
02:06:28,791 --> 02:06:31,168
It's good they're well.

997
02:06:31,418 --> 02:06:34,672
You'll be well soon too,
once the sea calms down.

998
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:38,717
Would you like a spoonful
of the Prince's Drops?

999
02:06:38,842 --> 02:06:40,427
No.

1000
02:06:44,682 --> 02:06:48,102
Am I hearing things?

1001
02:06:53,232 --> 02:06:55,317
That young girl died.

1002
02:06:55,567 --> 02:06:58,195
It wasn't seasickness.
It was quinsy.

1003
02:07:06,203 --> 02:07:08,163
I have to tell you something.

1004
02:07:08,289 --> 02:07:10,165
What?

1005
02:07:10,291 --> 02:07:13,168
I'll never set foot in America.

1006
02:07:15,337 --> 02:07:17,214
No, Karl Oskar.

1007
02:07:17,756 --> 02:07:20,676
I've known
ever since we came aboard.

1008
02:07:22,886 --> 02:07:25,848
I won't get out of here alive.

1009
02:07:26,932 --> 02:07:30,352
You and your notions!
Seasickness isn't fatal.

1010
02:07:32,021 --> 02:07:34,773
We'll make port in America,
you and me.

1011
02:08:11,894 --> 02:08:15,564
Please!
Can't you wait a bit longer?

1012
02:08:16,482 --> 02:08:19,526
He often lies like this
in the morning.

1013
02:08:19,777 --> 02:08:22,738
I have to shake him hard
until he wakes up.

1014
02:08:22,905 --> 02:08:25,240
His heart stops sometimes,

1015
02:08:25,366 --> 02:08:27,451
but then it starts again.

1016
02:08:27,576 --> 02:08:30,329
Your old man's
as dead as he can be.

1017
02:08:30,454 --> 02:08:32,581
I know what dead folk look like.

1018
02:08:32,706 --> 02:08:35,667
Can't you please wait
a bit longer?

1019
02:08:35,793 --> 02:08:37,419
Just one hour!

1020
02:08:38,128 --> 02:08:40,381
Till he starts to smell?

1021
02:08:41,298 --> 02:08:43,759
Just a little while!

1022
02:08:45,803 --> 02:08:47,971
Please!

1023
02:08:48,889 --> 02:08:52,059
You can't take him!

1024
02:10:13,557 --> 02:10:17,352
It's my turn now!

1025
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:50,886
Why aren't we going to live
in a house, Mother?

1026
02:10:51,053 --> 02:10:53,972
In America
we'll live in a house.

1027
02:10:57,935 --> 02:11:00,771
It's a poor sort of wife
you're taking to America.

1028
02:11:00,896 --> 02:11:04,441
You'll be fine when we get ashore.
Märta, come here.

1029
02:11:05,526 --> 02:11:07,361
Come here to Mother.

1030
02:11:07,486 --> 02:11:09,196
Come to me.

1031
02:11:13,367 --> 02:11:15,077
She's so grumpy.

1032
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:18,914
What is it, Inga-Lena?

1033
02:11:21,625 --> 02:11:23,502
I feel so dizzy.

1034
02:11:26,171 --> 02:11:28,423
I'm not feeling well.

1035
02:11:30,259 --> 02:11:34,763
Lately I've had blood in my stool.

1036
02:11:35,472 --> 02:11:37,933
I suppose it's what they call scurvy.

1037
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:40,102
You should lie down

1038
02:11:40,269 --> 02:11:42,771
and let Danjel do your chores.

1039
02:11:42,896 --> 02:11:46,400
He mustn't know.
Poor man has enough worries.

1040
02:11:47,568 --> 02:11:49,278
Isn't he well either?

1041
02:11:49,403 --> 02:11:51,697
Yes, but he has
to settle accounts

1042
02:11:51,822 --> 02:11:53,073
with God.

1043
02:11:53,865 --> 02:11:56,118
He's suffering terribly.

1044
02:11:56,285 --> 02:12:00,289
He could still help out.
He needn't always be praying.

1045
02:12:00,414 --> 02:12:02,457
You mustn't tell anyone...

1046
02:12:04,543 --> 02:12:06,837
but Danjel confessed
that he committed

1047
02:12:06,962 --> 02:12:09,756
the most heinous sin
a man can commit.

1048
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:12,759
He believed himself free of sin.

1049
02:12:13,885 --> 02:12:16,263
Then he was laid low
with seasickness,

1050
02:12:16,388 --> 02:12:19,141
and since then
he's been a changed man.

1051
02:12:19,308 --> 02:12:23,812
He says there's but one
righteous person on board: Ulrika.

1052
02:12:24,938 --> 02:12:27,149
She was spared both vermin

1053
02:12:27,274 --> 02:12:28,859
and seasickness.

1054
02:12:28,984 --> 02:12:31,945
He says God has saved
the ship for her sake.

1055
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:33,322
Not Ulrika!

1056
02:12:33,739 --> 02:12:35,907
Don't say a word to Danjel about this

1057
02:12:36,033 --> 02:12:38,160
or tell him I'm feeling out of sorts.

1058
02:12:38,327 --> 02:12:40,996
Promise me.

1059
02:12:57,763 --> 02:13:01,058
Good God, Kristina!
What's happened?

1060
02:13:04,227 --> 02:13:06,355
I'm so tired.

1061
02:13:06,897 --> 02:13:08,565
I can't go on.

1062
02:13:10,192 --> 02:13:12,527
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1063
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:15,614
I'm so tired.

1064
02:13:15,739 --> 02:13:20,035
It's all the blood you've lost.
We have to stop the bleeding.

1065
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:22,621
Lie still!

1066
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,919
I don't want Mother
to bleed anymore.

1067
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:31,463
I'll go wake the captain.

1068
02:13:32,506 --> 02:13:35,550
No, don't leave me.

1069
02:13:42,724 --> 02:13:46,395
My wife's bleeding to death!
You have to do something!

1070
02:14:07,999 --> 02:14:11,461
Change the compress
on her forehead every hour.

1071
02:14:50,834 --> 02:14:53,587
You'll be good
to the children, won't you?

1072
02:14:53,712 --> 02:14:55,589
Of course.

1073
02:14:57,966 --> 02:14:59,676
That's good to hear.

1074
02:15:00,969 --> 02:15:03,764
You'll have to be
both father and mother to them.

1075
02:15:03,889 --> 02:15:05,849
Don't talk like that.

1076
02:15:07,809 --> 02:15:09,478
Do you want anything?

1077
02:15:10,562 --> 02:15:13,148
No, nothing.

1078
02:15:23,825 --> 02:15:25,744
A lump of sugar?

1079
02:15:26,787 --> 02:15:28,663
I've been hiding them for you.

1080
02:15:28,789 --> 02:15:30,832
You're so kind...

1081
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:33,543
but I don't have the strength.

1082
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:42,969
Kristina.

1083
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:50,477
I want —

1084
02:15:52,687 --> 02:15:54,564
I want to ask...

1085
02:15:55,148 --> 02:15:56,983
your forgiveness.

1086
02:15:59,194 --> 02:16:01,029
For what?

1087
02:16:03,532 --> 02:16:05,700
For wanting to come away.

1088
02:16:07,202 --> 02:16:08,912
I wanted to too.

1089
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:12,082
But I insisted.

1090
02:16:13,208 --> 02:16:17,420
You wanted to make things
better for all of us.

1091
02:16:20,715 --> 02:16:23,093
You mustn't be sad.

1092
02:16:26,888 --> 02:16:29,432
So you forgive me?

1093
02:16:31,434 --> 02:16:33,937
I have nothing to forgive.

1094
02:16:35,188 --> 02:16:37,190
Remember that.

1095
02:16:39,734 --> 02:16:41,570
I'm glad to hear that.

1096
02:16:50,078 --> 02:16:53,081
I'm so very fond of you,
Karl Oskar.

1097
02:16:57,127 --> 02:16:59,254
I always have been.

1098
02:17:04,175 --> 02:17:06,303
We're the best of friends.

1099
02:17:07,470 --> 02:17:09,306
Yes, we are.

1100
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:11,600
We're the best of friends.

1101
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:20,609
I'll just sleep a bit now.

1102
02:17:21,192 --> 02:17:22,652
Yes, do.

1103
02:17:23,945 --> 02:17:26,656
Sleep now. You need it.

1104
02:17:26,865 --> 02:17:29,075
Just for a little while.

1105
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:33,079
Go to sleep, but just don't —

1106
02:17:35,874 --> 02:17:37,542
Just don't —

1107
02:18:07,656 --> 02:18:09,324
Father.

1108
02:18:09,491 --> 02:18:11,618
Mother's stopped bleeding.

1109
02:18:20,001 --> 02:18:21,836
<i>She's dead.</i>

1110
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:24,089
No, she's alive.

1111
02:18:24,923 --> 02:18:27,342
I think she's going to make it.

1112
02:18:28,843 --> 02:18:31,554
She died... just now.

1113
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:34,015
But you can see for yourself!

1114
02:18:37,143 --> 02:18:39,938
Inga-Lena died just now.

1115
02:18:42,232 --> 02:18:46,653
She never told me
she was so badly off.

1116
02:18:47,904 --> 02:18:49,698
She never complained.

1117
02:18:51,366 --> 02:18:53,868
Dust thou art,

1118
02:18:54,035 --> 02:18:56,037
and unto dust thou shalt return.

1119
02:18:56,746 --> 02:19:00,417
Jesus Christ shall wake thee
on the last day.

1120
02:19:14,973 --> 02:19:22,973
<i>Among God's saints in heaven</i>

1121
02:19:34,909 --> 02:19:39,622
The Lord said to you
as he said to Moses...

1122
02:19:40,999 --> 02:19:43,626
"Thou shalt not enter that land."

1123
02:19:45,503 --> 02:19:50,341
My dear wife, it was not given
to you either to see the new land.

1124
02:19:50,759 --> 02:19:54,804
You've gone before us
to that other harbor.

1125
02:19:57,098 --> 02:19:59,684
But when I wanted to set out,

1126
02:19:59,893 --> 02:20:03,813
you answered and said,
"Wherever you go...

1127
02:20:04,689 --> 02:20:06,775
there I shall go.

1128
02:20:07,525 --> 02:20:10,487
Wherever you stay,
there I shall stay.

1129
02:20:12,447 --> 02:20:16,242
Wherever you die,
there I too shall die...

1130
02:20:17,285 --> 02:20:20,205
and there I shall be buried."

1131
02:20:52,445 --> 02:20:54,989
You think we'll get there
by midsummer?

1132
02:20:56,157 --> 02:20:57,867
Yes, I think so.

1133
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:02,247
By then we'll have been
at sea for ten weeks.

1134
02:21:03,581 --> 02:21:06,000
Shall we read
the English book a bit?

1135
02:21:06,668 --> 02:21:08,586
If you like.

1136
02:21:13,299 --> 02:21:17,095
What was it you were to say
when you looked for work?

1137
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:21,057
"What can you do?"

1138
02:21:22,016 --> 02:21:24,811
"I am used to farm work."

1139
02:21:24,936 --> 02:21:26,980
I should practice mine too.

1140
02:21:27,689 --> 02:21:30,275
"I am the new servant girl."

1141
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:40,493
"Wash your hands
before you handle the food."

1142
02:21:40,618 --> 02:21:41,911
Damn it!

1143
02:22:03,183 --> 02:22:07,687
Why do they think all servant girls
have dirty hands in America?

1144
02:22:11,691 --> 02:22:13,359
I don't know.

1145
02:22:14,777 --> 02:22:16,571
I suppose because

1146
02:22:16,738 --> 02:22:19,657
everything's so nice and clean
in the new world

1147
02:22:19,782 --> 02:22:24,078
that they have to ask that of those
who've come from the old dirty one.

1148
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:01,824
Must you throw those away?

1149
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:04,953
I can wash and mend them
when I get ashore.

1150
02:23:05,119 --> 02:23:09,249
The sight of these
would only upset us there.

1151
02:23:09,749 --> 02:23:13,169
And I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of the Americans.

1152
02:23:13,294 --> 02:23:17,632
They'd see these rags and wonder
what sort of people we were.

1153
02:23:24,639 --> 02:23:26,140
Robert!

1154
02:23:26,849 --> 02:23:30,395
They've sighted America!

1155
02:25:46,114 --> 02:25:48,116
Hold on tight.

1156
02:25:50,701 --> 02:25:54,163
Your turn now. That's it.

1157
02:26:13,182 --> 02:26:15,518
Hop ashore.

1158
02:26:18,146 --> 02:26:20,690
There's a big boy,
going ashore by yourself.

1159
02:26:29,157 --> 02:26:30,658
What about our cargo?

1160
02:26:30,783 --> 02:26:32,910
As your interpreter, I'll handle it.

1161
02:26:33,035 --> 02:26:36,038
Look after it while I change
currency with the captain.

1162
02:26:36,164 --> 02:26:37,748
I'll do that.

1163
02:26:37,874 --> 02:26:40,251
I heard you're coming with us,
Landberg.

1164
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:46,507
It says something about California.

1165
02:26:55,183 --> 02:26:57,185
It's about ships to California.

1166
02:27:41,729 --> 02:27:44,732
The mate says
every tenth person here is a thief.

1167
02:27:46,192 --> 02:27:49,612
He says every fifth woman
is a whore too.

1168
02:28:45,876 --> 02:28:48,296
Is your ear hurting again?

1169
02:28:48,421 --> 02:28:50,548
No, it's just roaring.

1170
02:29:10,359 --> 02:29:12,153
He smells of liquor.

1171
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:17,408
Come on.

1172
02:30:31,232 --> 02:30:33,567
Are you asleep, Kristina?

1173
02:30:34,193 --> 02:30:35,986
It's moving.

1174
02:30:40,491 --> 02:30:42,660
It'll be just fine. You'll see.

1175
02:30:46,455 --> 02:30:48,457
Close your eyes and smell.

1176
02:30:51,627 --> 02:30:53,170
It can't be!

1177
02:30:55,089 --> 02:30:57,883
Eat and drink your fill now.

1178
02:31:00,219 --> 02:31:01,887
There's plenty.

1179
02:31:09,395 --> 02:31:12,773
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful apple?

1180
02:31:12,898 --> 02:31:14,942
I got it for nothing.

1181
02:31:18,738 --> 02:31:20,406
Let's see, now.

1182
02:31:24,618 --> 02:31:27,121
For you... and for you.

1183
02:31:31,208 --> 02:31:35,379
I think America's a good place.
We needn't be sorry we came.

1184
02:31:55,524 --> 02:31:59,069
Wait here.
I'll go find our places.

1185
02:32:03,365 --> 02:32:05,659
Robert, Arvid, this way.

1186
02:32:06,535 --> 02:32:08,120
We get on over there.

1187
02:32:50,704 --> 02:32:53,457
The train's starting. Hold on.

1188
02:32:59,964 --> 02:33:01,715
There's no danger.

1189
02:33:33,914 --> 02:33:35,541
Landberg...

1190
02:33:35,833 --> 02:33:38,252
can't we open a door a bit?

1191
02:33:38,419 --> 02:33:41,005
They're locked.
They'll open them when we stop.

1192
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:44,258
It ripped three fingers
off his left hand.

1193
02:33:44,592 --> 02:33:47,469
That's how powerful
the steam is when it escapes.

1194
02:33:48,554 --> 02:33:51,015
Suppose it escapes in here?

1195
02:33:51,223 --> 02:33:54,727
I don't think it will,
but if it does —

1196
02:33:56,604 --> 02:33:58,814
That's some invention!

1197
02:33:58,939 --> 02:34:02,568
There ain't many back home
who've enjoyed such comfort.

1198
02:34:02,693 --> 02:34:06,113
Do they collect the shit
to fertilize the crops?

1199
02:34:06,614 --> 02:34:10,200
Remember how we promised
to stick together

1200
02:34:10,326 --> 02:34:13,287
no matter what?
- I'll never forget our promise.

1201
02:34:13,454 --> 02:34:16,707
Whatever happens in America,
we'll stick together.

1202
02:34:21,712 --> 02:34:24,298
- What does that cost?
- Twenty-five cents.

1203
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:26,759
Is it any good?

1204
02:34:26,884 --> 02:34:29,637
Oh yes. It gives relief
for most illnesses —

1205
02:34:29,762 --> 02:34:33,390
cholera, jaundice,
baldness, and others.

1206
02:34:33,515 --> 02:34:35,517
Would you like a Painkiller?

1207
02:34:35,643 --> 02:34:37,811
- Please.
- Here you are.

1208
02:34:37,978 --> 02:34:40,022
Fine money they have!

1209
02:34:40,147 --> 02:34:42,650
Decorated
with the heavenly stars.

1210
02:34:44,109 --> 02:34:46,320
They stand for the first 13 states.

1211
02:34:48,238 --> 02:34:51,700
Something's written
under the woman on the throne.

1212
02:34:51,825 --> 02:34:56,121
It says, "In God we trust."

1213
02:34:57,039 --> 02:34:59,500
What? You hear that?

1214
02:34:59,667 --> 02:35:03,379
The creed is written
right on their money!

1215
02:35:03,504 --> 02:35:07,716
It's a good and God-fearing land
we've come to.

1216
02:35:08,217 --> 02:35:12,179
Let us praise the Lord
that we've been allowed to come.

1217
02:35:44,294 --> 02:35:46,422
Aren't you going to eat, Uncle?

1218
02:35:47,089 --> 02:35:50,384
We have nothing left.

1219
02:35:53,762 --> 02:35:56,598
Fresh air!
I could do with some.

1220
02:36:35,596 --> 02:36:38,098
If you don't mind stale bread.

1221
02:36:38,223 --> 02:36:39,391
Thank you.

1222
02:36:54,156 --> 02:36:56,867
If there are no delays,
we'll reach Buffalo

1223
02:36:56,992 --> 02:36:58,911
this time tomorrow.

1224
02:37:36,865 --> 02:37:39,827
They almost look like
the gentry at home.

1225
02:37:40,786 --> 02:37:43,956
You said people aren't divided
into gentry and commoners

1226
02:37:44,081 --> 02:37:45,874
here in America.

1227
02:37:49,002 --> 02:37:52,422
I only said they weren't divided
into different classes.

1228
02:37:53,132 --> 02:37:56,844
I expect those are the ones
who are well-off.

1229
02:37:58,846 --> 02:38:02,516
There are two kinds
of people in America:

1230
02:38:02,808 --> 02:38:05,978
those who've been here so long
that they've gotten rich,

1231
02:38:06,103 --> 02:38:10,232
and those so new here
they haven't had time to get rich.

1232
02:38:12,151 --> 02:38:15,696
Just think: traveling on the water
when they don't have to.

1233
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:34,548
I just found out the truth,
and you'll answer for it!

1234
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:40,679
You deceived us.
- What on earth are you accusing me of?

1235
02:38:41,013 --> 02:38:45,184
You said we had
just 250 miles to travel.

1236
02:38:45,309 --> 02:38:47,227
That's what
the ship's captain said.

1237
02:38:47,394 --> 02:38:50,397
Our interpreter says
it's 1,500 miles,

1238
02:38:50,522 --> 02:38:52,399
and he's not one to lie.

1239
02:38:52,566 --> 02:38:55,444
You lied to us,
you goddamn bastard!

1240
02:38:55,569 --> 02:38:59,198
Here we've crossed
one ocean after the other,

1241
02:38:59,323 --> 02:39:02,284
all because we trusted you.

1242
02:39:02,409 --> 02:39:04,995
Are you accusing me?
You old har—

1243
02:39:05,537 --> 02:39:07,164
Say it.

1244
02:39:07,289 --> 02:39:08,916
Say the whole word.

1245
02:39:09,082 --> 02:39:11,501
"You old harlot!"

1246
02:39:11,627 --> 02:39:14,046
Calm down!
You're both right.

1247
02:39:14,254 --> 02:39:16,924
American miles are much shorter
than Swedish miles.

1248
02:39:17,299 --> 02:39:20,219
There are six
to one Swedish mile.

1249
02:39:20,344 --> 02:39:21,386
You see?

1250
02:39:21,511 --> 02:39:25,098
If anyone else thinks
I've deceived them, step forward.

1251
02:39:25,224 --> 02:39:27,267
Calm down.
It was all a mistake.

1252
02:39:27,434 --> 02:39:29,436
No, I'm going to speak my mind.

1253
02:39:29,561 --> 02:39:32,773
I didn't ask all of you
to come to Minnesota.

1254
02:39:32,898 --> 02:39:35,317
Where I'm going
concerns my family alone.

1255
02:39:35,442 --> 02:39:38,237
You can all go settle
wherever you goddamn like!

1256
02:39:38,362 --> 02:39:42,074
Calm down.
You have no reason to quarrel.

1257
02:39:42,199 --> 02:39:45,118
Shake hands.
- You heard what he called me!

1258
02:39:45,244 --> 02:39:46,828
You called me a liar!

1259
02:39:47,746 --> 02:39:50,457
Shake hands now and make up.

1260
02:39:53,961 --> 02:39:55,629
Shake hands.

1261
02:39:57,130 --> 02:40:00,759
Forget about her.
You know we trust you.

1262
02:40:00,884 --> 02:40:03,804
We're all very grateful to you.

1263
02:40:11,144 --> 02:40:14,815
I can't bear that woman any longer.
We'll part ways with her.

1264
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:18,652
But she's part of Danjel's family,
and she's good with the children.

1265
02:40:18,819 --> 02:40:22,322
I like her more now that we've arrived.

1266
02:40:22,447 --> 02:40:25,575
And Danjel told me
how badly she was treated,

1267
02:40:25,701 --> 02:40:28,453
sold at auction as a little girl.

1268
02:40:31,039 --> 02:40:35,544
Ulrika's turning plain crazy because
she hasn't had a man for so long.

1269
02:40:36,086 --> 02:40:40,007
She needs a prick rammed up her
as far as it will go.

1270
02:41:58,835 --> 02:42:00,420
You're alone?

1271
02:42:00,921 --> 02:42:04,257
Isn't Märta with you?
- No. Isn't she on board?

1272
02:42:04,383 --> 02:42:05,467
No.

1273
02:42:06,134 --> 02:42:08,345
- Are you sure?
- She was with you!

1274
02:42:08,762 --> 02:42:12,432
- I thought she was with you.
- She's still on shore!

1275
02:42:17,979 --> 02:42:19,398
Märta!

1276
02:42:21,650 --> 02:42:24,778
Karl Oskar, what's happened?

1277
02:42:24,945 --> 02:42:26,446
Is Märta there?

1278
02:42:28,365 --> 02:42:30,200
I haven't seen her.

1279
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:51,346
Have you seen my little girl?
She's so little! Please!

1280
02:43:06,111 --> 02:43:07,737
She's not here.

1281
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,868
You let her out of your sight!

1282
02:43:13,785 --> 02:43:15,996
She's fallen in the water!

1283
02:43:16,830 --> 02:43:19,749
Where is she?

1284
02:43:21,334 --> 02:43:23,336
The boat's leaving without us!

1285
02:43:24,546 --> 02:43:28,008
- We can't leave her behind.
- What about the other kids?

1286
02:43:28,175 --> 02:43:30,010
I'm staying here!

1287
02:43:30,302 --> 02:43:32,345
Please wait!

1288
02:43:34,431 --> 02:43:37,559
Märta is still on shore.

1289
02:43:38,894 --> 02:43:41,438
We have to look for her!

1290
02:43:42,689 --> 02:43:44,191
Hurry!

1291
02:43:47,068 --> 02:43:48,653
Hurry!

1292
02:44:02,209 --> 02:44:06,046
She was on the beach
playing with shells.

1293
02:44:06,713 --> 02:44:09,716
She was having such fun
that I was afraid

1294
02:44:09,883 --> 02:44:11,551
she'd never come.

1295
02:46:29,773 --> 02:46:32,108
What did you say
the disease is called?

1296
02:46:32,233 --> 02:46:33,443
Cholera.

1297
02:47:10,188 --> 02:47:12,315
She just brings it up again.

1298
02:47:23,493 --> 02:47:26,413
- Isn't there anything else?
- No.

1299
02:47:26,579 --> 02:47:28,248
No bread?

1300
02:47:28,748 --> 02:47:31,376
We'd do well
to keep off the ship's fare.

1301
02:47:31,543 --> 02:47:34,129
It may be where
the disease comes from.

1302
02:47:34,254 --> 02:47:37,424
Robert, put this somewhere
no one will see it.

1303
02:48:02,323 --> 02:48:04,367
We have to buy milk!

1304
02:49:35,416 --> 02:49:36,960
O Lord...

1305
02:49:37,710 --> 02:49:42,131
thou hast said I was to have
no other gods before thee.

1306
02:49:43,383 --> 02:49:45,677
I idolized my daughter.

1307
02:49:46,928 --> 02:49:49,848
Now thou hast taken
my idol from me.

1308
02:49:50,974 --> 02:49:52,851
I thank thee...

1309
02:49:53,059 --> 02:49:55,353
my Lord and savior.

1310
02:50:53,453 --> 02:50:57,165
Respected sir,
how can I reach Taylors Falls?

1311
02:51:26,110 --> 02:51:28,196
You understand what he's saying?

1312
02:51:28,446 --> 02:51:29,572
Yes.

1313
02:51:35,244 --> 02:51:38,039
What did he say?

1314
02:51:38,957 --> 02:51:41,125
Something about the weather.

1315
02:51:41,250 --> 02:51:43,252
The weather!

1316
02:51:43,378 --> 02:51:47,006
What did you ask him?
- How to get to Taylors Falls.

1317
02:51:47,131 --> 02:51:49,425
Did you understand
what he said?

1318
02:51:49,550 --> 02:51:52,470
Something about the weather.
I'll ask someone else.

1319
02:51:52,595 --> 02:51:55,807
- Did you say what's in the book?
- Yes.

1320
02:52:13,658 --> 02:52:17,203
Everything's soaking wet.

1321
02:52:21,958 --> 02:52:24,961
I've never seen a man
so handy in the kitchen.

1322
02:52:26,004 --> 02:52:30,800
Yes, that's the nicest,
most kind-hearted man I've ever met.

1323
02:52:30,925 --> 02:52:33,094
You'd never guess
he was a parson.

1324
02:53:39,118 --> 02:53:41,913
Do you know Anders Månsson?

1325
02:53:54,967 --> 02:53:56,969
I think it's close.

1326
02:53:57,762 --> 02:53:59,514
Can you ask him?

1327
02:56:53,312 --> 02:56:57,483
Robert, when we get there,
I won't go on living with Uncle Danjel.

1328
02:56:57,650 --> 02:56:59,235
What will you do?

1329
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:02,697
I'll seek a position
with a wealthy American family.

1330
02:57:04,323 --> 02:57:07,660
I don't intend to keep working
for Karl Oskar long either.

1331
02:57:07,827 --> 02:57:09,787
What will you do?

1332
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:13,165
I certainly won't be a farmhand.

1333
02:57:15,584 --> 02:57:18,838
I'll probably push on west
to California.

1334
02:57:19,005 --> 02:57:21,340
California? What's there?

1335
02:57:30,182 --> 02:57:32,893
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

1336
02:57:33,019 --> 02:57:34,520
Promise.

1337
02:57:34,770 --> 02:57:36,022
I promise.

1338
02:57:50,494 --> 02:57:53,372
- Did I hurt you?
- No, it's my ear.

1339
02:57:54,415 --> 02:57:56,625
It starts up now and then.

1340
02:57:57,251 --> 02:58:01,172
- Is it roaring like before?
- Your ear is roaring?

1341
02:58:01,297 --> 02:58:03,007
Can I hear it?

1342
02:58:04,175 --> 02:58:05,926
You can try.

1343
02:58:12,892 --> 02:58:14,727
Can you hear it?

1344
02:58:41,837 --> 02:58:43,923
We thank thee, O Lord,

1345
02:58:44,215 --> 02:58:46,342
for our daily bread.

1346
02:58:54,225 --> 02:58:56,185
An alien land

1347
02:58:56,435 --> 02:59:00,147
has generously opened
its gates to us...

1348
02:59:01,315 --> 02:59:03,609
and we have entered
through them

1349
02:59:04,068 --> 02:59:07,947
to dwell in peace
and seek our livelihood.

1350
02:59:09,115 --> 02:59:13,702
But we'd be lost and wandering
like newborn lambs

1351
02:59:14,120 --> 02:59:18,165
had thou, O Lord, not helped us.

1352
02:59:20,501 --> 02:59:28,134
<i>O everlasting Lord</i>

1353
02:59:28,634 --> 02:59:31,887
<i>From generation to generation</i>

1354
02:59:32,012 --> 02:59:35,850
<i>From land to land</i>

1355
02:59:36,308 --> 02:59:43,607
<i>Your hand protects
the world from harm</i>

1356
02:59:44,108 --> 02:59:47,987
<i>In the morning</i>

1357
02:59:48,112 --> 02:59:51,949
<i>The flower opens</i>

1358
02:59:52,450 --> 02:59:56,662
<i>But it withers</i>

1359
02:59:56,787 --> 02:59:59,707
<i>Before the day's end</i>

1360
03:00:00,499 --> 03:00:07,298
<i>Just like that flower</i>

1361
03:00:07,798 --> 03:00:14,972
<i>Are all the people on the earth</i>

1362
03:01:00,392 --> 03:01:02,561
Surely no one lives there.

1363
03:01:03,312 --> 03:01:05,189
It's just a barn.

1364
03:01:26,418 --> 03:01:28,504
Can you explain to him?

1365
03:01:33,592 --> 03:01:35,844
Have you no manners, boy?

1366
03:01:35,970 --> 03:01:37,930
Put that gun down!

1367
03:01:40,182 --> 03:01:42,810
What are you doing
with a gun in the barn?

1368
03:01:46,730 --> 03:01:48,941
I wasn't expecting you.

1369
03:01:49,608 --> 03:01:51,819
I thought I'd never get here.

1370
03:01:56,407 --> 03:01:57,992
Where's Father?

1371
03:02:00,578 --> 03:02:02,329
Is Father dead?

1372
03:02:02,496 --> 03:02:05,791
As dead as all the others
at the bottom of the sea.

1373
03:02:08,836 --> 03:02:11,797
Here's our iron pot.

1374
03:02:12,923 --> 03:02:14,967
One foot got knocked off.

1375
03:02:16,510 --> 03:02:19,513
You brought our old pot.

1376
03:02:28,772 --> 03:02:30,816
Come inside...

1377
03:02:30,941 --> 03:02:32,651
all you Swedish folk.

1378
03:02:34,403 --> 03:02:37,364
Thank you. It was a long way,

1379
03:02:37,489 --> 03:02:39,283
but we made it at last.

1380
03:02:39,408 --> 03:02:41,827
Why are you living in the barn?

1381
03:02:42,661 --> 03:02:45,497
This is my house, Mother.

1382
03:02:45,748 --> 03:02:47,207
This?

1383
03:02:49,877 --> 03:02:52,087
Anders, you wrote that —

1384
03:02:53,464 --> 03:02:56,467
Don't stand there
telling your old mother fibs.

1385
03:02:56,717 --> 03:02:59,178
Show me your farm!

1386
03:03:02,848 --> 03:03:04,350
Come inside now.

1387
03:03:22,409 --> 03:03:23,952
Mother.

1388
03:03:53,941 --> 03:03:58,112
There's a forest over there —
a fine and beautiful one.

1389
03:04:03,742 --> 03:04:08,122
We could put in a road here.

1390
03:04:21,593 --> 03:04:24,847
Two feet of good soil here too.

1391
03:04:26,098 --> 03:04:30,436
The sun has never shone
on fairer ground.

1392
03:04:31,145 --> 03:04:32,688
No...

1393
03:04:32,813 --> 03:04:36,400
better farming land
you won't find in all creation.

1394
03:04:36,525 --> 03:04:38,444
It's a mosquito pit here.

1395
03:04:39,194 --> 03:04:41,488
Marshland on both sides.

1396
03:04:41,613 --> 03:04:44,116
You're never satisfied,
Karl Oskar.

1397
03:04:44,241 --> 03:04:46,285
We've gone far enough.

1398
03:04:46,827 --> 03:04:49,037
Let's stay here now.

1399
03:04:49,163 --> 03:04:51,540
There's plenty of room
for the three of us.

1400
03:04:51,665 --> 03:04:53,667
It may be even better further on.

1401
03:04:53,792 --> 03:04:57,546
We should be grateful to the Lord
for this place he's shown us.

1402
03:04:57,671 --> 03:05:01,508
If you're not happy with this spot,
you're just plain picky.

1403
03:05:05,429 --> 03:05:09,183
You said you thought
it was even better by the other lake.

1404
03:05:09,308 --> 03:05:12,811
- By Ki-Chi-Saga?
- That's right. Ki-Chi-Saga.

1405
03:05:12,936 --> 03:05:14,605
I don't know.

1406
03:05:14,730 --> 03:05:17,483
Not many have gone that far in.

1407
03:05:19,067 --> 03:05:21,153
I've come thousands of miles.

1408
03:05:21,278 --> 03:05:24,072
I can go a few more
to have a look

1409
03:05:24,490 --> 03:05:26,325
around Ki-Chi-Saga.

1410
03:05:28,994 --> 03:05:32,915
That way they can see
that the land is claimed.

1411
03:05:41,882 --> 03:05:45,552
The greenest fields
lie furthest away.

1412
03:08:57,661 --> 03:09:01,498
