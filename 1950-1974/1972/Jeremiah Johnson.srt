1
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,761
His name was Jeremiah Johnson.

2
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,924
They say he wanted
to be a mountain man.

3
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,645
The story goes that he was a man
of proper wit and adventurous spirit...

4
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,649
suited to the mountains.

5
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,485
Nobody knows where he came from,
and it don't seem to matter much.

6
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,767
He was a young man...

7
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,249
and ghosty stories about
the tall hills didn't scare him none.

8
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,162
He was looking for e Hewkin gun,
50 caliber or better.

9
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,240
He settled for e 30, but damn,
it was e genuine Hewkin.

10
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,924
You couldn't do no better.

11
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,722
Bought a horse, traps and other truck
that went with being a mountain man.

12
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,321
And said goodbye
to whatever life was down below.

13
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,802
Where is it I could find bear, beaver,
other critters worth cash skinned?

14
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,642
Ride due west as the sun sets.
Turn left at the Rocky Mountains.

15
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,364
This here 's his story.

16
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,400
"I, Hatchet Jack..."

17
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,243
being of sound mind
and broken legs...

18
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,047
do hereby leaveth my bear rifle...

19
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,084
to whatever finds it.

20
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,930
Lord hope it be a white man.

21
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,607
It is a good rifle...

22
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,009
and killed the bear that killed me.

23
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,890
Anyway, I am dead.

24
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,164
"Yours truly, Hatchet Jack."

25
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,571
Ha, ha!

26
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,523
A 50 caliber Hawkin!

27
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,487
Come on, you.

28
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,610
That'll be far enough, pilgrim!

29
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,680
Where are you?

30
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,042
You're a fine target, pilgrim!

31
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,608
Empty your hand.

32
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,729
I ain't seen no live man in 2 months.

33
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,482
I am Bear Claw Chris Lapp.

34
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,401
Blood kin to the grizzly
that bit Jim Bridger's ass!

35
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,887
You are molesting my hunt!

36
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,690
- I am...
- I know who you are!

37
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,288
You're the same dumb pilgrim
I've been hearing for 20 days...

38
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,801
and smelling for 3!

39
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,846
How come you ain't been scalped?

40
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,124
Ain't been too lucky?

41
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,044
- No.
- This place has been trapped out since '25.

42
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,367
Why are you here?

43
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,370
I hunt griz.

44
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,965
- Griz?
- Grizzly bears, pilgrim. I collect the claws.

45
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,530
I had one in that thicket.

46
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,161
Ready to shake hands,
until you came!

47
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,567
I'm sorry, then.

48
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,450
You look it!

49
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,009
Hungry too?

50
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,691
Come on.

51
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,005
You know how to skin griz?

52
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,408
I can skin most anything.

53
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,928
You sure are cocky
for a starving pilgrim.

54
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,127
There she be. Go in, get warm,
eat something.

55
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,880
I've got a chore to finish.

56
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,440
My boy!

57
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,444
Are you sure
that you can skin griz?

58
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,007
Just as fast as you can find them.

59
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,246
Jesus!

60
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,887
Skin that one, pilgrim,
and I'll get you another!

61
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,242
Must have missed
another war down there.

62
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,961
Didn't miss nothing.

63
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,601
If I head due west tomorrow,
will I find places to trap?

64
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,329
If you head due west or any place
tomorrow, you'll be starving in a week.

65
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,331
You ain't likely to meet
someone like me.

66
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,729
Mountain's got its own ways.

67
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,721
What?

68
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,641
Use that skin pad, pilgrim,
before you lose all your fingers.

69
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,727
What you learned down in the flat
will serve you no good up here.

70
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,929
You got some work to do.

71
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,046
Utes and Flatheads...

72
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,085
are generally peaceful critters.

73
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,001
Crows, they are fearful.

74
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,686
Mighty warriors too.

75
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,563
In my opinion, the Crows
are the handsomest Indians there is.

76
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,166
And proud too.

77
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,726
There ain't a man alive
can match them on a horse.

78
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,124
I've seen them ride
with one foot on the horse's rump...

79
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,687
one wrist through a loop
in the mane...

80
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,611
shooting arrows and guns
under the horse's neck!

81
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,402
But they are an adulterous people.

82
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,728
Adulterous.

83
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,090
Here you are, pilgrim.
Sharp enough to scale a fish with.

84
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,766
Ever get lonesome?

85
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,367
For what?

86
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,687
Woman?

87
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,845
Full-time night woman?

88
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,681
I never could find no tracks
in a woman's heart.

89
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,006
I packed a Squaw
for 10 years, pilgrim.

90
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,928
Cheyenne, she was.

91
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,766
And the meanest bitch
that ever balled for beads!

92
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,642
I lodgepoled her at Dead Wolf Creek
and traded her for a Hawkin gun!

93
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,770
Don't get me wrong,
I love the women, I surely do!

94
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,125
But I swear...

95
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,886
a woman's breast
is the hardest rock...

96
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,367
the Almighty ever made on Earth...

97
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,211
and I can find no sign on it.

98
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,208
Now these coals here
will simmer until sunrise.

99
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,722
You better go do likewise.

100
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,407
Didn't put enough dirt down.

101
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,168
Saw it right off.

102
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,449
You track well, pilgrim.

103
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,802
- Kind of like it, don't you?
- Maybe.

104
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,610
Figures. A human man...

105
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,962
likes tracking and killing.

106
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,567
An Injun, he figures it's natural.

107
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,486
Wind's right.

108
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,570
But he'll just run, soon as
we step out of these trees.

109
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,050
Trick to it.
Walk out on this side of your horse.

110
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,405
What if he sees our feet?

111
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,962
Elk don't know
how many feet a horse has.

112
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,087
No, you damn fool!
Slide it up over the saddle!

113
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,722
You got him, pilgrim!
You nailed him clean.

114
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,962
We got us an elk to skin!

115
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,524
Can't figure people there
eating hog when they could feed on elk.

116
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,245
Didn't like it down there?

117
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,928
- Ought to have been different.
- Is that so?

118
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,004
Many a child journeys
this high to be different.

119
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,608
To get from here what their natures
couldn't get them below.

120
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,806
It comes to nothing.

121
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,448
Can't cheat the mountain, pilgrim.
Mountain got it...

122
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,969
Probably Crow. They'll steal
our horses unless we bribe them.

123
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,167
Why?

124
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,567
It's their territory.
They figure we're trespassing.

125
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,930
Yep, Crow.

126
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,167
Paints-His-Shirt-Red.
That's his sign. Just stand still.

127
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,126
You two know each other?

128
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,686
I saw him once.

129
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,883
He says you fish poorly.

130
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,531
You understand their language?

131
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,367
Paints-His-Shirt speaks English,
he just does this to aggravate me.

132
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,123
Says he's got enough bear claws.

133
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,288
Hold that.

134
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,530
What's your name?

135
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,405
Johnson.

136
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,570
Your Christian name?

137
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,121
Jeremiah.

138
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,171
You've learned well, pilgrim.
You'll go far.

139
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,286
Providing you ain't burnt alive
or scalped.

140
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,766
I will do my best.

141
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,808
You can out wood
and leave it up on the Judith.

142
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,127
Riverboat captains will leave you gold
if you put out a pouch.

143
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,284
Good thing to know...

144
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,284
if times get hard.

145
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,291
Watch your topknot.

146
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,801
Yes. Watch yours.

147
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,486
I told you not to go play outside.
You got yourself all dirty...

148
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,644
and also, young lady...

149
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,406
without your shoes.

150
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,964
And you, Josh...

151
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,206
dirty!

152
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,122
Look at you! There, now!

153
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,164
Mary Lou, you knew better
than to go out in the sun...

154
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,931
Have I told you
not to go out...

155
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,289
without a bonnet on your head?

156
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,563
You better stop there.

157
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,969
Woman, I am your friend.

158
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,442
We have graves to dig.

159
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,727
You were borne on the wind today.

160
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,530
Josh was being a bad boy.
I must tell your father.

161
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,047
Time to start the garden.

162
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,330
If the wind would stop.

163
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,726
We will now sing.

164
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,168
Shall we gather at the river

165
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,044
Where bright angel feet have trod

166
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,251
With its crystal tide forever

167
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,884
Flowing by the throne of God

168
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,643
Yes, we'll gather at the river

169
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,648
The beautiful, the beautiful river

170
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,687
Gather with the saints at the river

171
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,931
That flows by the throne of God

172
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,607
Boy, did you see all this?

173
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,802
Better get one of these biscuits, boy.

174
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,329
I make damn good biscuits.

175
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,690
Here's food.

176
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,364
I could not find your husband
anywhere, ma'am.

177
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,361
So, maybe he will come back here.

178
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,088
The Indians will not bother you now,
on account of...

179
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,970
you are touched.

180
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,004
They will be afraid.

181
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,644
What about the boy?

182
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,002
Maybe you and the boy
best come with me now.

183
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,003
I will take you down to the Judith.
Put you on a ferry.

184
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,721
Take him.

185
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,644
- What?
- Take him!

186
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,206
Ma'am, I wouldn't know how
to tend after...

187
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,122
You got a name, boy?

188
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,571
Huh?

189
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,329
I will call you Caleb.

190
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,001
It is a name
I have always admired.

191
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,248
You like that? Caleb?

192
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,845
Do what you like.
I was much the same myself.

193
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,006
Damn!

194
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,121
Are you all right?

195
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,762
Sure, I got a fine horse under me!

196
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,288
Got one of them feathers
in my nose.

197
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,490
Keep sneezing,
it'll come out all right.

198
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,886
Haven't seen anyone pass by recently,
have you?

199
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,130
Nobody's gone in front of me.

200
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,323
Can't say what's happened
behind me though.

201
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,810
The Injuns put you here?

202
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,208
It weren't Mormons.

203
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,844
A chief, name of Mad Wolf.
Nice fellow, don't talk a hell of a lot.

204
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,090
You wouldn't have
an extra hat on you, would you?

205
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,488
Shade's getting scarce in these parts.

206
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,290
Why did you shave your head?

207
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,369
Mad Wolf figures like
every other Injun I know.

208
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,481
Says this scalp ain't fit
for no decent man's lodgepole.

209
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,970
Ain't the first time I protected
my head in such a way.

210
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,528
Name's Del Gue.

211
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,211
With an "E."

212
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,889
- When did they come through?
- A few hours ago.

213
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,811
I will be happy to see my horse.
I hate walking.

214
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,965
I knew you would help me
get my pelts back.

215
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,364
I wouldn't leave a man
without a horse or gun.

216
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,207
Ain't that Hatchet Jack's rifle?

217
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,521
Yeah.

218
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,721
How did you get it?

219
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,128
I found him, froze to a tree.

220
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,840
Damn!

221
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,728
That Hatchet Jack was a wild one.

222
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,962
He was living with a female panther.

223
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,971
Two years in a cave
up in the Musselshell.

224
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,129
She never did get used to him.

225
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,730
That be them.

226
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,529
- How many you figure?
- Three.

227
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,003
Just like before.

228
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,848
Are you smelling them Blackfeet?

229
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,569
No, I'm locating my horse.
Dirtiest animal this side of hell.

230
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,609
Come dark, you give me your pistol.
Load that bear rifle full of nails.

231
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,487
No. I got no truck with them Blackfeet.

232
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,128
I plan to be here a long time.
I do not want them down on me.

233
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,411
Them critters hammered me
into the ground. Took my rifle, horse.

234
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,480
Stole my pelts. Not to mention
what they done to that boy's folks!

235
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,766
Then let it pass?

236
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,286
Nope.

237
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,086
But they'll be asleep soon.

238
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,842
Should be no trouble to slip in there
and then get your possibles.

239
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,684
Use this blanket, boy.

240
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,610
To keep you warm.

241
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,044
He don't say a lot, does he?

242
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,327
No.

243
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,571
Hey.

244
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,441
No.

245
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,811
No.

246
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,562
Stay here with the animals.

247
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,330
No!

248
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,728
I am Del Gue!

249
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,526
I can whip my weight in Wolverines...

250
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,005
straight through a crab apple orchard
on a flash of lightning!

251
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,211
You've stolen my pelts!

252
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,403
And die, you must!

253
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,644
You skinheaded son of a bitch,
you almost got me killed!

254
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,846
Where are you going?

255
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,131
Don't you want any of these?

256
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,401
What?

257
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,927
Scalps!

258
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,520
No.

259
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,731
Mother Gue never raised
such a foolish child.

260
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,604
Stop that, boy.

261
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,250
- What do you do with the scalps?
- Sell them to the English.

262
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,926
English?

263
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,250
London is wallpapered
with Injun scalps.

264
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,489
- Let's pull into those trees.
- Don't go getting hasty.

265
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,929
Them is Flatheads, and they've hurt
nobody that I know.

266
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,203
Just hold back.

267
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,924
- What's he saying?
- Says they're Blackfeet ponies.

268
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,288
He asks if you are the great warrior...

269
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,882
who avenges the Crazy Woman
in the Wolf Tail Valley.

270
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,531
She's big medicine.

271
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,842
And so are you,
if you are that man.

272
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,771
- So what's he shouting for?
- Scared of you.

273
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,245
- But how did you...?
- I didn't know they'd be Flatheads.

274
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,241
It's all right, boy.

275
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,564
Chief here is named
Two-Tongues Lebeaux.

276
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,922
Mighty educated too.

277
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,731
French missionaries
taught him their language.

278
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,049
- Christian Indians?
- Lots of them.

279
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,522
He says the scalps are fierce
and the horses are fleet.

280
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,810
Take them.

281
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,644
Take them. And the ponies.
I have no further use for them.

282
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,803
Damn fool,
you may have cooked our brains!

283
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,001
Why?

284
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,686
He brought us here to honor you
and you want to give him a gift.

285
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,167
If he cannot give you a better one,
it'll be an insult.

286
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,801
What's so funny?

287
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,885
The danger is over.

288
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,330
He has thought of a better gift.

289
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,730
- His daughter.
- Huh?

290
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,400
Now you have a son,
you need a wife.

291
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,963
- I don't want no wife...
- He says he'll be very happy.

292
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,451
What is that word? Oh, yes!

293
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,166
He may read the Bible,
but he's still an Injun.

294
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,090
And his rules is his rules.

295
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,449
If you value your hair,
you will get married!

296
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,403
Del Gue,
I do not think this is funny.

297
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,761
It ain't.

298
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,448
When you leave, you can
take her to Fort Hawley and sell her.

299
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,487
But you best take her, friend.

300
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,888
Besides, maybe she ain't near bad.

301
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,004
He says she's called The Swan,
but she'll answer to anything you want.

302
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,725
But maybe you need her.

303
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,682
You turn down this gift, they'll slit
you, me, Caleb and the horses...

304
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,646
from crotch to eyeball
with a dull deer antler!

305
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,611
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Johnson.

306
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,491
Your husband has told me
so much about you.

307
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,282
Congratulations, Two-Tongues.
Wonderful wedding.

308
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,771
- Bye, Jeremiah Johnson!
- Where are you going?

309
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,010
I wouldn't want to disturb
your wedding night.

310
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,003
I'll see you in the fall.

311
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,441
Have a nice honeymoon,
Mrs. Johnson.

312
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,570
Do you speak any English?

313
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,849
I don't speak any Flathead.

314
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,684
So don't bother me, neither of you!

315
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,330
Wondering about something?

316
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,485
Go ahead, ask.

317
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,044
Leave it be.

318
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,003
Nothing wrong with quiet.

319
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,251
Cooking sure
don't smell like Bear Claw's.

320
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,003
Tie him off, boy.

321
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,525
Suppertime!

322
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,410
Go on, boy, and eat.
It's good for you.

323
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,244
No.

324
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,846
I'm full.

325
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,320
You religious too?

326
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,205
Religious.

327
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,764
I'm not going to harm you.

328
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,290
Religious.

329
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,125
Yes.

330
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,965
Yes.

331
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,965
I'm not going to harm you.

332
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,450
Yes.

333
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,490
Yes.

334
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,049
Yes!

335
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,365
Yes.

336
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,770
Ain't that a lot easier
than saying all that gibberish?

337
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,644
Yes!

338
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,491
Great hunter.

339
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,486
Yes.

340
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,170
- Yes.
- Yeah.

341
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,049
Fine figure of a man, yes?

342
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,361
Yes?

343
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,726
- Yes.
- That is all you need to know. For now.

344
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,090
You getting enough, boy?

345
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,840
Yes.

346
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,082
This wasn't my idea, you know?

347
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,721
Lord!

348
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,764
ThiS'll do.

349
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,408
River in front, cliffs behind.

350
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,046
Good water. Not much wind.

351
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,209
This will be a good place to live.

352
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,080
Hawk.

353
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,762
Yeah. Going for the Musselshell.

354
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,922
It'd take me a week's riding.
And he'll be there in...

355
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,764
Hell, he's there already.

356
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,844
I wish you would see fit to stop
the practicing of these ceremonies.

357
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,847
NO!

358
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,402
Caleb, take notice of the traps
and go fetch some proper food.

359
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,890
And keep your nose open,
there may be Indians about.

360
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,564
Be going for buffalo soon.

361
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,526
No, you'll stay here.

362
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,924
Here. Go on,
fetch the rest of that wood.

363
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,926
Ch.

364
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,528
Swan, I cannot stand this weight.

365
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,410
Well...

366
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,730
It will have to do.

367
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,210
Johnson.

368
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,041
It will keep me warm
in the strong wind.

369
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,042
And the rain
will not pass through neither.

370
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,241
Thank you.

371
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,729
You have beaver scent?

372
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,245
What happened to your face?

373
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,529
Huh? My beard?

374
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,170
Watch this.

375
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,807
Spring.

376
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,887
There.

377
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,688
Careful, that'll take your hand off.

378
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,444
Put that smell down.

379
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,404
Won't come around
without the smell.

380
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,881
Hell, don't run off. It's me.

381
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,007
What?

382
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,764
Skin this.

383
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,765
Troop, halt!

384
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,924
Johnson?

385
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,730
I'm Lieutenant Mulvey,
Third Cavalry.

386
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,404
That's Reverend Lindquist.

387
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,489
We've been watched since
we started to climb up from the Gila.

388
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,361
Who are they, Flathead?

389
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,000
I said, are they Flathead?

390
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,161
- Did I say something?
- No.

391
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,124
It's been a long time...

392
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,770
since I had...

393
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,367
so much of the English language
spoke at me.

394
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,525
I ain't used to it.

395
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,086
Crow.

396
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,160
This is Crow land.

397
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,960
This is the Department of Colorado.

398
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,529
- Yeah.
- You're on good terms with them.

399
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,881
Crow?

400
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,286
Who gave you that idea?

401
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,329
People talk about it down below.

402
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,801
You live up here.

403
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,961
I do that.

404
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,282
And you know the high country.

405
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,841
Do you know Feather Mesa?

406
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,846
I do. So?

407
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,490
We have wagons there. Three of them.

408
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,810
Broke down in the snow and ice.

409
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,805
We got to get them
out of there before they freeze.

410
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,280
Gr the Indians get them.

411
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,047
Would be wise.

412
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,970
We were told that
you would know how to get there.

413
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,443
Through those passes.

414
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,928
We were hoping that maybe...

415
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,647
These are Christian families.

416
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,043
Christian women
and children, starving.

417
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,683
Do you mean that you intend
to let those people die?

418
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,209
How's the war going?

419
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,891
Which war?

420
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,406
One against the President of Mexico.

421
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,209
It's over.

422
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,081
Who won?

423
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,643
Did you hear something?

424
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,851
Can't go through here.

425
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,087
Why not?

426
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,205
Crow burial ground. Sacred.

427
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,962
- We'll have to turn around and head east.
- How far east?

428
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,970
Next pass.

429
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,120
Twenty... 20 miles or so.

430
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:11,002
Those people are waiting for us!
They're freezing, hungry and scared.

431
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,090
Crow only come with medicine men
and burying parties!

432
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,971
- We are not Crows!
- What would happen?

433
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,650
I don't know.

434
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,327
I don't know.

435
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,731
This is big medicine.
They guard it with spirits.

436
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,206
You don't believe that.

437
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,365
It doesn't matter. They do.

438
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,081
You've been up here too long,
believing in this!

439
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:40,366
What chance would I have finding
a way through, just by riding west?

440
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,881
Poor chance. Or none.

441
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,690
Thanks all the same, Johnson,
but we're riding through.

442
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,771
Sergeant! Prepare to move!

443
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,841
You won't make it.

444
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,409
You have to hunt, you said.

445
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,931
I have to try.

446
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,006
Tell your men to keep
behind me in single file.

447
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,167
Tell them to go slow
and stay quiet.

448
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,050
- Sergeant!
- Sir.

449
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,526
Single file, slowly.

450
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,091
Yes, sir.

451
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,845
Keep them quiet.

452
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,926
Well, we seem to have escaped.

453
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,924
How long have you
been carrying your Squaw?

454
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,404
- Thank you...
- Move them fast.

455
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,324
Crow don't take kindly to trespassing.

456
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:44,602
Where's your mule that kicks holes
in the sky and shakes off its saddle?

457
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,930
Where's your slavering wolf
of the rolling prairie?

458
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,524
Here's your old grizzer brown bear
can clobber bark off a gum tree.

459
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,123
There's a man for you,
Jeremiah Johnson.

460
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:00,046
I'm half horse, half gator,
and a touch of the earthquake.

461
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,090
I got the prettiest gal,
fastest horse...

462
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,641
ugliest dog this side of hell.

463
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:08,883
I can outjump, outrun, throw down...

464
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,725
drag out and whip
any man in all Kentucky.

465
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,162
How you been, Jeremiah?

466
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:20,802
Staying alive, Del.
Ain't that hair I see on your head?

467
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,566
It sure is.

468
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,327
I've decided that when I depart
from this life, I'd leave something.

469
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,325
At least to be remembered
on some man's lodgepole.

470
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,603
Sound wisdom.

471
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,002
- Where you headed?
- Same place you are, Jeremiah.

472
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,084
Hell in the end.

473
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:51,926
With all them Injuns after you,
I cannot brag about your campsite.

474
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,603
You got old and scary
since you growed hair on your head?

475
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,126
What ever happened to that boy?
The one that didn't talk much?

476
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,409
Never did take him to Hawley.

477
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,363
Stayed with that Injun gal
all this time?

478
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,050
She wasn't no trouble.

479
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,208
Just like this, one at a time?

480
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,763
You're lucky they were Crows.

481
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,327
Apaches would send 50 at once.

482
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,571
Amongst Injuns...

483
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:21,289
a tribe's greatness is figured on
how mighty its enemies be.

484
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,166
Maybe...

485
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,610
Maybe you'd best go down to a town...

486
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,204
get out of these mountains.

487
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,168
I've been to a town, Del.

488
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,445
Which way now?

489
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,770
Don't know.

490
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:07,646
I hear the Big Belt in the Blue has
beavers the size of bobcats.

491
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,160
That so?

492
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,888
I ain't never trapped either...

493
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,050
but sure would like to.

494
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,685
- Jeremiah-
- You will do well, Del.

495
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:22,921
You will do well.

496
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:26,968
If you don't get in too much trouble
with all that hair.

497
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,245
Ain't this something?

498
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,084
I told my pap and mam
I was coming to the mountains...

499
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,011
to trap and be a mountain man.

500
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,562
Acted like they was gut-shot.

501
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,126
Says: "Son..."

502
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,887
make your life go here.
Here's where the people is.

503
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,364
"Them mountains
is for animals and savages!"

504
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,691
I said: "Mother Gue..."

505
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:57,040
the Rocky Mountains
is the marrow of the world."

506
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,890
And by God, I was right.

507
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,251
Yes, you were.

508
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,004
Which way you headed, Jeremiah?

509
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,290
Canada, maybe.

510
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,768
I hear there's land there
a man has never seen.

511
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,283
Keep your nose in the wind...

512
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,483
your eyes along the skyline.

513
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,970
I will do that, Del Gue.

514
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,880
I ain't never seen them,
but my common sense tells me...

515
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:38,490
the Andes is foothills,
and the Alps is for children to climb.

516
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,601
Keep good care of your hair!

517
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,525
These here are
God's finest sculpturings...

518
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,241
and there ain't no laws
for the brave ones!

519
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,841
And there ain't no asylums
for the crazy ones!

520
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:54,010
And there ain't no churches
except this right here.

521
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,805
And there ain't no priests...

522
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,491
excepting the birds!

523
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,687
I are a mountain man! And I'll
live until an arrow or bullet finds me.

524
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,803
And then I'll leave my bones...

525
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,368
on this great map
of the magnificent...

526
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,770
Right here, mister.

527
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,126
Where's the crazy woman?

528
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,251
She's gone.

529
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,041
Walk over this way.

530
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,481
Gone where?

531
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,567
Dead.

532
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,723
One of them mounds.

533
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,771
Who are you?

534
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,884
My name's Qualen.

535
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,321
I'm a settler.

536
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,086
Settler.

537
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,725
What are you going to do?

538
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,607
I do it when Indians are coming.

539
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,446
You're him.

540
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,489
Ain't you him?

541
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,446
What's this?

542
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,286
It's for you.

543
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,408
If you be Johnson.

544
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,850
A might early, ain't they?

545
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,881
It ain't a grave like the other.

546
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,441
More like a statue or a monument.

547
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,124
We never see them.

548
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,609
We never even hear them.

549
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:54,610
We look and there's e new piece of
bone or hide, or somethings been left.

550
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,609
So we know they've been here.

551
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,928
Some say you're dead
on account of this.

552
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,049
Others say you never will be
on account of this.

553
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,805
It won't save anything.

554
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,641
Huh?

555
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,610
Sending them out to hide
in the corncrib.

556
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,011
What's on the spit?

557
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,366
Grown particular?

558
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,411
Not about feeding.

559
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,090
Just the company I keep.

560
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,242
Thank you kindly.

561
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:56,925
You've come far, pilgrim.

562
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:01,290
Feels like far.

563
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,929
Was it worth the trouble?

564
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,606
What trouble?

565
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,647
You cook good rabbit, pilgrim.

566
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,006
Cold up here.

567
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,049
- What brings you up so high?
- Griz.

568
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,531
Griz.

569
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,001
Avalanche took the cabin.

570
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,169
Lost my mule.

571
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,089
We swum out of it.

572
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,930
But no matter.

573
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,601
Weren't no griz left anyway.

574
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,210
Would you happen to know
what month of the year it is?

575
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,162
No, I truly wouldn't.

576
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:11,048
I'm sorry, pilgrim.

577
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,565
March.

578
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,129
Maybe April.

579
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,725
March, maybe.

580
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,042
I don't believe April.

581
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,684
Winter's a long time going?

582
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:29,881
Yeah.

583
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,522
Stays long this high.

584
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:50,723
March is a green,
muddy month down below.

585
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,329
Some folks like it.

586
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,648
Farmers mostly.

587
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:06,005
You have done well
to keep so much hair...

588
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,487
when so many are after it.

589
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,484
I hope you will fare well.
