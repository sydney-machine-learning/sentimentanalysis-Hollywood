1
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:18,573
Flight 4 from New York
now boarding at Gate 7.

2
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:37,491
Flight 741 from Holland
now arriving at Gate 8.

3
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:00,855
Taxi.

4
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:07,126
Follow that cab!

5
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,812
Howard, Howard Bannister!

6
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:28,342
Howard, when I ask you
to wait for me somewhere...

7
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,784
...I expect you
to stay there until I come back.

8
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,683
Yes, Eunice.

9
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:35,190
It is difficult enough for me
to see to all these arrangements myself.

10
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,987
- Yes, Eunice.
- It is exactly 6:15.

11
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,960
If we reach the hotel in half an hour...

12
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,360
...we'll have enough time
to dress for the banquet.

13
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,158
- Put these things in a taxi.
- Yes, Eunice.

14
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,741
It's a beautiful city, isn't it, Howard?

15
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,809
I'd like to come here on our honeymoon.

16
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,341
Did you hear me, Howard? I said
I'd like to come here on our honeymoon.

17
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,250
What?

18
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,446
I thought you wanted to go
to San Francisco on your honeymoon.

19
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:17,652
- This is San Francisco, Howard.
- Of course it is.

20
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:19,922
Howard!

21
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,021
Hey, what're you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

22
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,624
- You all right back there?
- I hope nothing's broken.

23
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,998
- It's just a bump.
- No.

24
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,037
Don't overdramatize.

25
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,732
I mean my igneous rocks.
I hope they're not damaged.

26
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,240
I know how you feel, mister.

27
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,868
I hate it when my igneous rocks
are even touched.

28
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,539
Miss, may I help you?

29
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,406
I was wondering if my friends are here.

30
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:45,174
They're visiting from the New Hebrides
and I believe they're in Room 1717.

31
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:49,648
- I'm sorry, but that room is vacant.
- I don't understand.

32
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,716
They told me they would be
in Room 1717 at the Hotel Crystal.

33
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:57,155
This is the Bristol, madam, not the Crystal.

34
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,927
Then one of us must be in the wrong hotel.

35
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,998
Mrs. Van Hoskins.

36
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,330
It's so nice to have you back with us.

37
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,203
- Thank you, Hans.
- Fritz.

38
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:13,707
What happened to Hans?

39
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,177
There is no Hans, Mrs. Van Hoskins,
there is only me, Fritz.

40
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,440
What a shame.

41
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,809
Boy!

42
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,955
Franz, I'm going to take this with me.
There are some things I need tonight.

43
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,654
Tomorrow, I want you
to put it the hotel safe for me.

44
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,487
It will be done, madam.

45
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:54,714
Room service, please.

46
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,143
Hi, room service, this is Room 1717.

47
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,488
I would like a double thick
roast beef sandwich, medium rare...

48
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,685
...on rye bread, mustard on the top,
mayonnaise on the bottom...

49
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,491
...and a coffee, hot fudge sundae
with a large bottle of diet anything.

50
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,666
You got that? Yeah.

51
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,058
Room 1717.

52
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,264
And, room service, would you...

53
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:18,171
...put it outside the door.
Don't bring it in or knock...

54
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:21,506
...'cause I'm just putting my baby to sleep.
Right. Thank you.

55
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:30,246
I am Miss Eunice Burns, and this is
my fiancé, Dr. Howard Bannister.

56
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,652
We are here for the Congress
of American Musicologists' Convention.

57
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,314
Go to the drugstore and get some aspirin.

58
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,485
I want you to be in shape for this evening.

59
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,792
Don't touch that!
These are my pre-Paleozoic Tambulu rocks.

60
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,395
- Don't touch those rocks.
- I'll take care of those.

61
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,925
Howard, you go to the drugstore
and be back in my room in five minutes.

62
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,631
- Right. Eunice?
- Yes?

63
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,900
- Why am I going to the drugstore?
- Aspirin.

64
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,807
Get it with buffering added.
It's better for the stomach.

65
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,003
- Right.
- Front.

66
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,340
- Flat.
- Sir?

67
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,914
Your bell is flat. It's half a tone off.

68
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,233
- What's up, doc?
- I beg your pardon?

69
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,941
- We've gotta stop meeting like this.
- You're making a mistake.

70
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,915
I came in here
for something for a headache.

71
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:10,645
You'll need an awfully big glass
of water to get that down.

72
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:11,480
What?

73
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,049
No, you see, I'm a musicologist.

74
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:17,585
I was just testing this specimen
for inherent tonal quality.

75
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,319
I have this theory
about early man's musical relationship...

76
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,194
...to igneous rock formations.

77
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,225
But I guess you're not really interested
in igneous rock formations.

78
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:32,405
Not as much as I am in the metamorphic
or sedimentary rock categories.

79
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,568
I mean I can take your igneous rocks
or leave them.

80
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,741
I relate primarily to micas, quartz, feldspar.

81
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,041
Keep your pyroxenes, magnetites
and coarse-grained plutonics...

82
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,711
...as far as I'm concerned.

83
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,388
- I forgot why I came in here.
- Headache.

84
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,557
Yes, thank you. And goodbye.

85
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,098
- Was it something I said?
- I beg your pardon?

86
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,037
What do you think I am, a piece of fruit...

87
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:06,802
...to squeeze the juice out of
and toss?

88
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,208
- You're making a mistake.
- That's all I am to you.

89
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,042
A clerical error. Erase me,
forget you even know my name.

90
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,082
- I don't know your name.
- Judy Maxwell.

91
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,845
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

92
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,682
- Could you let go of my hand?
- I don't think so.

93
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,924
Look what happened.

94
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:25,918
Oh, dear!

95
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,862
Please don't help me.
I am perfectly able to do this myself.

96
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,829
Be more careful.

97
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,460
Did you know that 3 percent of all
fatal accidents happen in drugstores?

98
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,833
What's going on back there?

99
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,964
Nothing, we're just looking
for a little aspirin.

100
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,167
- Let me help you.
- Don't help me!

101
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,570
Just go away.

102
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,344
Okay.

103
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:54,147
- My husband'll pay for this.
- What's he doing on the floor?

104
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,883
He suffers from a nervous condition.
He falls down a lot.

105
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,451
- I don't want people falling down in here.
- Well, we're on our honeymoon.

106
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,193
- Is this the kind with buffering?
- That's right.

107
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,791
How much do I owe you?

108
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:13,107
- $68.29.
- I beg your pardon?

109
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,472
$68.29.

110
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,503
How much is it without buffering?

111
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,846
Look, mister, the aspirin is $0.84.
This is $67.45.

112
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,111
- What's that?
- A radio.

113
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,278
- I don't want a radio.
- What about your wife?

114
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:29,654
- I don't want a wife. I haven't got a wife.
- Quit kidding. He's always kidding around.

115
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,023
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who she is.

116
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,460
Come on, Steve, buy her the radio,
it's on sale.

117
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,128
You call this a honeymoon?

118
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,600
What about the aspirin?

119
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,967
Hey, Steve! Steve, wait!

120
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,005
Wait up, Steve.

121
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,610
Am I sorry.

122
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:52,503
I am...

123
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm terribly sorry.

124
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:58,619
Let me sew it up for you.
We'll go someplace quiet.

125
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,314
We'll get needle and thread
in the drugstore.

126
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,085
I don't want to go into the drugstore.
I don't like it.

127
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,352
Don't be angry.

128
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:06,452
Listen, Steve.

129
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:10,429
My name is not Steve.
It is Howard Bannister...

130
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:13,798
...and now that I've told you
I wish you'd forget you've heard it.

131
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,804
- I like Steve better.
- You've mistaken me for someone else.

132
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,567
Now go away and leave me alone.

133
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:22,975
- Why did you follow me into the drugstore?
- I didn't, I had headache.

134
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:24,637
- Still have it?
- No.

135
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,941
- Howard.
- See?

136
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:29,542
- Howard. I said five minutes.
- I'm sorry, Eunice.

137
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,176
That's a person named Eunice?

138
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,744
- Where've you been?
- I had a problem in the drugstore.

139
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,653
- You didn't say you're married.
- We're not.

140
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,419
- Congratulations.
- But we will be soon.

141
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,050
Condolences.

142
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,357
- Who is this person?
- I have no idea.

143
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,455
- She was behind a rock in the drugstore.
- Tell her about us.

144
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:46,763
- Why is she calling you that name?
- Don't pay any attention to her.

145
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,163
- Look, Miss Maxwell...
- You know her name.

146
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,229
I swear this is a bizarre joke.

147
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,969
It's easy for you, everywhere you go,
another heart broken.

148
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:56,978
Women. You call it joking,
Eunice and I, we call it lust.

149
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,538
- Don't you know the meaning of propriety?
- Propriety? Noun.

150
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,585
Conformity to established standards
of behavior or manners...

151
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,917
...suitability, rightness,
or justness. See "etiquette."

152
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,406
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

153
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:27,499
- We don't want to wake up the little one.
- We sure don't.

154
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,697
I was...

155
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:55,993
...just...

156
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,104
...Iooking for my key.
- Oh, yes.

157
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:03,838
- Can't seem to find it anywhere.
- Maybe the door is open.

158
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,907
No, I'm sure I locked it.

159
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,278
Good night.

160
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,887
- Don't forget your dinner.
- Yeah, right, I'll get it later.

161
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,414
Thanks.

162
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,990
- Eunice. Eunice.
- Who's there?

163
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,496
It's me, Howard Bannister, your fiancé.

164
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:33,666
- You look very nice, Howard.
- Thank you, Eunice, you look very nice, too.

165
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,903
I haven't gotten dressed yet, Howard.

166
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,978
Come in, I'll do your tie.

167
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:41,813
- What tie is that, Eunice?
- Your tie. The tie in your hand.

168
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,813
Yes, of course.

169
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,453
My dinner's here.

170
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,467
I don't know who he is, but I hate him.

171
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,719
Howard, you must have said
something to encourage that girl.

172
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,225
What do you mean, Eunice?

173
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,557
Now, Howard, you know
what I'm talking about.

174
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,494
- After all, you are a man.
- That's true.

175
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,156
- She is a woman.
- That's true, too.

176
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:07,930
- In the same way that I am a woman.
- I don't think of you as a woman, Eunice.

177
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,668
I think of you as...

178
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,096
...as Eunice.

179
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,902
- But I am a woman, Howard.
- I know that.

180
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,669
Eunice, I know I don't seem to be
a very romantic person.

181
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm not looking for romance, Howard.

182
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,811
I'm looking for something more important
than that. Something stronger.

183
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,254
As the years go by, romance fades
and something else takes its place.

184
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:29,722
- Do you know what?
- Senility.

185
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,089
- Trust.
- That's what I meant.

186
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,856
I think we'd better talk about this
at some other time.

187
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,330
Now, Howard, I want you to make
a good impression on Mr. Larrabee.

188
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,799
Tell me exactly
what you're going to say to him.

189
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,527
What?

190
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:44,470
I'll probably say something like,
"Hello there, Mr. Larrabee, I'm Howard."

191
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,939
- You're not.
- I'm not Howard.

192
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,476
You are not going to say,
"Hi, my name's Howard."

193
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,104
- Anyone can say that, anyone.
- Anyone named Howard.

194
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,045
You'll to walk straight up to him...

195
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,948
...and take his hand
in a firm masculine handshake and say:

196
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,178
"Mr. Larrabee, I'm Dr. Howard Bannister.

197
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,084
"It is a privilege to meet you, sir."

198
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:02,385
- Think you can do that?
- Yes, I think I can.

199
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:05,893
- Well, do your best. Be dignified.
- I'll be dignified.

200
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:08,088
- Be solemn, but not stuffy.
- I'll be solemn.

201
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,529
- Act friendly, but impersonal.
- I'll act friendly.

202
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,159
- Pull the door open.
- I'll pull the door open.

203
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,000
- Well, goodbye, Eunice.
- Now, don't be nervous, Howard.

204
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,405
Just remember,
everything depends on this.

205
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,872
Now, let's see.

206
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:28,372
Mr. Larrabee, it's an honor to...
No, that's not it.

207
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,251
What is it? It's a...

208
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:34,915
- It's a privilege to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

209
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,494
Mr. Larrabee, it's a privilege to meet you.

210
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,969
I'm Dr. Howard Bannister.

211
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,702
And I'm your head waiter, Rudy.
Can I show you to your table, sir?

212
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:04,069
No, thank you,
I think I'll just mingle for a while.

213
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:07,312
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you, I don't drink.

214
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:12,942
- You're upside down, sir.
- I'm upside down.

215
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:45,912
Hello? Give me the chief.

216
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:48,313
He is? Tell him...

217
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,549
...I got the documents.

218
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,404
- I'm Hugh Simon.
- How do you do?

219
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,271
- You're upside down.
- I know.

220
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:12,438
And, I suppose, you have not read
my series of articles...

221
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,244
...on the Versuch einer Anweisung
in the Music Monthly.

222
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:16,443
I haven't, I'm sorry.

223
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:20,215
Foolish of you. You must realize
that it was that series of articles...

224
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,813
...that helped me to become
one of the two finalists...

225
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:26,622
...in contention for the Larrabee Grant.
Amazingly, you are the other one.

226
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,623
I can't imagine
that the Larrabee Foundation...

227
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:33,134
...will throw good money away
on a study of prehistoric rock dumpings.

228
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:35,465
I think you're oversimplifying my thesis...

229
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:38,131
Oversimplifying?
You accuse me of oversimplifying?

230
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:39,935
I never oversimplify.

231
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:42,772
There's an old Croatian saying, Bollixter,
which goes...

232
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,176
- Bannister.
- Well, whatever it is.

233
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,311
Our host!

234
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,119
Mr. Larrabee?

235
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:06,833
Mr. Larrabee...

236
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:10,565
I'm Hugh Simon, Mr. Larrabee,
I would like to say, I love your hair.

237
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,630
- Thank you.
- On behalf of myself...

238
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:14,641
...and my colleagues at the conservatory...

239
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,507
Yes, indeed.
And I believe that this must be Mr...

240
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,275
- It's a privilege...
- Although, I want you to know...

241
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:23,442
...that I personally have only contempt
for monetary gain.

242
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:26,385
The $20,000 will allow us, me, that is...

243
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,748
...to complete a great body of work,
which will most certainly reflect...

244
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,226
...une gloire énorme
on the Larrabee Foundation.

245
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:35,024
Very well put. Nothing like it.

246
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:37,497
Nothing like a little gloire énorme
or otherwise...

247
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,126
...but I must point out
you're only one of the finalists.

248
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,137
- lf I'm not mistaken, this must be...
- Mr. Larrabee.

249
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:47,437
- Believe me, I understand it if...
- Very understanding of you, Simon.

250
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,238
And, now, if you don't mind...

251
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,175
- I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry.
- It's all right, it's all right.

252
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,450
- Dr. Bannister.
- Mr. Privilege, it's a...

253
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:08,158
No, that's not it.
Anyway, it's nice to see you, sir.

254
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:10,758
- Thank you, I don't drink.
- Neither do I.

255
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,460
You don't. Shall we sit down, gentlemen?
I believe...

256
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,797
After you, sir.

257
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,770
...we're all sharing the same table.

258
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:20,703
Mr. Larrabee.

259
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:23,403
Good evening, Prof. Hosquith,
this is Howard Bannister.

260
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:24,445
You're Bannister.

261
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,674
- How do you do?
- Thank you.

262
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:30,479
Your fiancée was telling us about
your most incredible adventure in the sky.

263
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,146
What's this, what incredible adventure
did you have?

264
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,746
What adventure did I have?
What adventure did I have?

265
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:39,385
You mustn't be modest about
a simply incredible thing like that.

266
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:43,727
You'll have to tell us all about it, Bannister.
Come along to the table, now.

267
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,227
Good show, Bannister, good show.

268
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:50,600
- And this must be Miss Burns.
- How do you do?

269
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,300
- You!
- Eunice, Howard, Eunice.

270
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:58,869
We've almost got that stammer cured.
Sit down, dear.

271
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,973
- How? How?
- Howard. Howard.

272
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:05,319
He still gets stuck on names.
It's probably the excitement...

273
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,845
...of meeting you for the first time.
I must say I can feel it myself.

274
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,052
- Can you?
- Can I? My heart is going a mile a minute.

275
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:15,062
Why, you can just feel it pounding.
Can't you feel it?

276
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:18,531
Yes, I think I can. Yes, it's absolutely...

277
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,226
It's certainly in there pounding.

278
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:23,600
It's amazing, you should feel it, gentlemen.

279
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:24,639
Sit down, gentlemen.

280
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:27,266
- Can I sit next to you?
- I wouldn't have it another way.

281
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:31,039
Why don't you sit on my right, Bannister?
If you could move, Mr. Simon.

282
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,376
- But, sir, this is not...
- I know, Bannister.

283
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,076
This isn't the seating plan
according to the place cards...

284
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:38,779
...but we can break
a few of the minor social customs.

285
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:39,945
Sir, I must point out...

286
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:43,684
I must point out that "foolish consistency
is the hobgoblin of little minds."

287
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:45,555
- Emerson!
- I beg your pardon, my dear?

288
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,857
Ralph Waldo Emerson,
born 1803, died 1882.

289
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,759
- You like Emerson?
- I adore him!

290
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,128
I adore anyone who adores him.

291
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:54,066
I adore anyone who adores anyone
who adores Emerson. Your turn.

292
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,763
She's a delight, Bannister.
You're a lucky dog.

293
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,203
- But this isn't...
- Admit it.

294
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:00,867
- Admit you're a lucky dog.
- I'm a lucky dog. But...

295
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,739
- Miss Burns, may I call you Eunice?
- No!

296
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,368
How's that?

297
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,436
Howard means that back
where we come from...

298
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:09,142
...everyone calls me Burnsy.
- Burnsy? I like that.

299
00:26:09,784 --> 00:26:10,773
Burnsy.

300
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:11,817
Help!

301
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:22,050
I presume you are familiar
with your fiancé's studies, Miss Burns?

302
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:23,715
You presume correctly, Mr. Simon.

303
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,955
- You have read his thesis?
- Read it! I typed it for him myself.

304
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,052
This is not Eunice Burns.

305
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:31,530
Then you must share
his inordinate interest in rocks.

306
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,397
Passionately. You might say
a rock brought us together.

307
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:35,595
You're not Eunice.

308
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,333
You will expect me to accept a notion
that Neanderthal man found...

309
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,898
...a method of making music
out of minerals?

310
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:44,968
I believe I can prove that actual melodies,
crude, of course...

311
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:49,346
...but melodies, based on the diatonic scale
similar to the Norse Ventengum chants...

312
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,577
I love those Ventengums.

313
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:53,177
...really existed
as far back as 7 million B.C.

314
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,985
- You can prove this?
- Given the time, and the money, of course.

315
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,824
- But really, music from rocks?
- It so happens, Mr. Simon...

316
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:03,420
...that Howard had discussions
with Leonard Bernstein...

317
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:06,399
...about the possibility
of conducting an avalanche in E flat.

318
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:09,960
- That's ridiculous.
- Where's your sense of humor, Simon?

319
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:12,438
She's a gem, Bannister.

320
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:15,101
- She's unbelievable.
- Yes, she is.

321
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,839
What do you mean you can't find me?
I'm right here.

322
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,973
I'm sorry, I have no badge in that name.

323
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,315
Will you look again, please?
It's Burns, Eunice Burns.

324
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:36,823
I got the jewels.

325
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,025
Get out of there,
but don't let anyone see you.

326
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,759
Roger.

327
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:40,596
Fritz.

328
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,673
As you undoubtedly realize, Mr. Larrabee...

329
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:25,713
...I spent almost six years on this study.

330
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,977
- You've got to get out.
- And miss all the good stuff that's coming?

331
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,247
- She'll be here any minute.
- That's the good stuff that's coming.

332
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,878
...in terms of Swiss composers.

333
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,856
- Swiss composers, Mr. Simon?
- That's right, Miss Burns.

334
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:41,456
I don't imagine that it is a field
that the musical archeologists...

335
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:45,726
...would find particularly rewarding,
but it is a rich field...

336
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,100
...in which my groundbreaking scholarship
has cultivated a rich harvest.

337
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,095
Must've taken a lot of fertilizer.

338
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:55,404
We would like to hear the story
that Miss Burns was telling about.

339
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,445
- Burnsy.
- That Burnsy was telling about...

340
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,571
- He calls her Burnsy.
- What was it, Bannister?

341
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:02,343
Some incredible adventure
your had on your flight here?

342
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:02,940
Yes. No!

343
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,713
My Howard is too modest
to tell you that story himself.

344
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:08,585
It all began shortly
after we passed the point of no return.

345
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:09,782
I think we just passed it.

346
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:12,088
When the amplifiers
and directional gyro failed...

347
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,151
...and the flex valve refused to disconnect...

348
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,630
...one of the pilots fainted from fear
and went into this power dive.

349
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:21,157
Howard took his igneous rocks
into the cockpit, selected two of them...

350
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,500
...with a particularly high
magnetic content...

351
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,233
...and set up an electrically-induced
field pattern on the...

352
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,569
I'm having a nightmare.

353
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,903
- What's the problem?
- This lady claims to be a Eunice Burns.

354
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:33,311
I am not a Eunice Burns,
I am the Eunice Burns.

355
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,372
I don't have a badge for a Eunice Burns.

356
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,748
Of course not.
Miss Burns is wearing her badge.

357
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:39,912
- She's already inside.
- That is impossible.

358
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:43,014
- Perhaps you're at the wrong convention.
- This is outrageous.

359
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:46,949
And just possibly saving
112 passengers...

360
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,791
...from a tragic, fiery death.

361
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:53,195
Absolutely incredible.
I find that story intensely moving.

362
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:57,804
I find that story as difficult to swallow
as I do this potage au gelée.

363
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,773
How would you like to swallow
one sandwich de knuckles?

364
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,070
- I've got to talk to you privately.
- Meet me under the table.

365
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,637
- What?
- My goodness, there goes my napkin.

366
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,207
So far, so good?

367
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,412
- Don't you understand anything?
- Like what?

368
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:14,114
- Like Eunice.
- I don't understand Eunice.

369
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:16,748
- She'll be here soon.
- Stop repeating yourself.

370
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:19,224
I'm not repeating myself,
I'm not repeating myself.

371
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,693
Oh, God, I'm repeating myself.

372
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:23,128
- Steve, you don't want to marry her.
- I'm Howard!

373
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:25,597
- Neither of you wants to marry Eunice.
- Why is that?

374
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,295
You don't want to marry one
who'll be wrinkled and flabby.

375
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:30,963
- Everybody gets wrinkled and flabby.
- By next week?

376
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,768
Hey, what's going on down here?

377
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,740
You two can't keep away from each other?

378
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,798
We're just talking.

379
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,277
Are you all right, Mr. Larrabee?
Can I help?

380
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:40,439
No, I'm fine, we were just chatting.

381
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,240
- What's going on?
- Anything wrong?

382
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,113
No.

383
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:46,847
Testing a theory Howard has about
vocal reverberation under spinal pressure.

384
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,583
What? Vocal reverberation
under spinal pressure?

385
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,658
- You know V.R.U.S.P.?
- Yes.

386
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,657
I think I read a monograph on that.

387
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:58,260
Charles, what kind of wine are you serving
at Table 1?

388
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,467
I'm telling you, Bannister,
this girl of yours is fun.

389
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,804
F-U-N, and if you win that grant,
well, you can consider it her victory...

390
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,903
...as well as your own, do you follow me?
- I...

391
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,577
I certainly do.

392
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,550
Howard! Howard Bannister!

393
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:27,292
Howard, tell them who I am.
They're trying to...

394
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,393
They're trying to keep me out!

395
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,822
Who is that
dangerously unbalanced woman?

396
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,902
Howard, tell them who I am.

397
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:37,870
Tell them who I am!

398
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:41,136
I insist you tell them
who I am right this minute!

399
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,635
I never saw her before in my life.

400
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:52,341
Wait!

401
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:12,034
Look, here she comes now.
Did you get the jewels out of the hotel?

402
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:14,336
No, I put it in 1714. I didn't have time...

403
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,569
1714!

404
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:18,942
What kind of a house detective are you?
Can't you commit a burglary?

405
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:20,480
- I'm ashamed.
- Never mind.

406
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:23,381
I'll return the case to her room
while you detain her.

407
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:25,316
- How do I do that?
- Use your charm.

408
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:30,950
Charm. Use your charm.

409
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:46,237
- What do you want?
- Madam, it is I, Fritz.

410
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:50,542
I suppose you've come to apologize
for the unbelievable criminal injustices...

411
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,511
...which have been visited upon me here.

412
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,606
The fact is that one of our guests
has lost something.

413
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:59,710
I fail to see how it could be in here
unless it crawled in under its own power.

414
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,345
Exactly, Miss Burns.

415
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:02,912
What are you trying to say?

416
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,788
It's very embarrassing,
but one of our regular guests...

417
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,920
...a wealthy eccentric,
has lost his pet snake.

418
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,996
No! Yes, here. Calm yourself.

419
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,327
May I suggest that you shut yourself
in the bathroom for a few moments...

420
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:19,305
...while I search your room.
- What if it's in there?

421
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,601
It won't be in there.

422
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:24,509
Snakes, as you know,
live in mortal fear of tile.

423
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,971
Oh, yes. And thank you.

424
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:35,515
It's all right, Miss Burns,
you can come out now.

425
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:38,719
What more can they do to me?

426
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,003
- What's the matter, Steve?
- My name is not Steve...

427
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,335
...and the matter is, how am I going
to explain all this to Eunice?

428
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:29,941
- That is the easiest thing.
- Easiest thing.

429
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,104
First you go right down to her room.
You knock on the door.

430
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:36,082
Okay. She answers the door.
She will have been crying...

431
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,177
...so her eyes will be all puffy
and bloodshot, you know...

432
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:43,348
...and her nose is all red and running.
But, you overlook that.

433
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,358
You put your hand on her shoulder...

434
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:48,623
...you stare purposefully
into those red-rimmed, swollen eyes...

435
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,923
...and you say:

436
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,363
"Eunice, there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

437
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:56,233
"I behaved like, a cad, a bounder.
But now I see everything clearly.

438
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:59,962
"And I have decided that Judy and I
are going to put you into a home."

439
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:02,642
That is not amusing.

440
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,179
Steve, what are you so upset about?
Tonight was fantastic!

441
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,408
- We've got that Larrabee grant sewn up.
- We?

442
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:10,609
You have to admit I helped,
he calls me Burnsy.

443
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:12,676
That's not the point, you are not Burnsy.

444
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,154
Burnsy is Burnsy, I mean Eunice is Burnsy,
I mean she isn't Burnsy.

445
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:17,885
Nobody is Burnsy.

446
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,655
- So what is the point?
- The point is...

447
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:22,218
Oh, God, I've forgotten the point.

448
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:25,527
The point is, you think when Mr. Larrabee
finds out I'm not Eunice...

449
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,227
...he'll think you tried to trick him...

450
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:29,792
...and it's bye-bye $20,000.
- Right! That's the point!

451
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:33,363
That money would enable me to establish
certain proof for theories of mine.

452
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,033
Certain theories that...

453
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,901
Must you stand quite so close?

454
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,936
I'm very nearsighted.

455
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,212
- Where was I?
- Certain theories.

456
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:45,214
Right.

457
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,914
That money would enable me
to travel to southern France...

458
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:51,390
...to examine evidence of prehistoric
art forms 100,000 years old.

459
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,292
- Aurignacian or Upper Perigordian?
- Both, if I'm given...

460
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:57,627
- Where do you come up with those names?
- Just a wild guess.

461
00:36:58,266 --> 00:36:59,756
I want you to go away now.

462
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:03,731
Steve, I'm sorry, I only wanted to help.

463
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,333
I know you don't mean any harm,
you're just...

464
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:09,968
- You're just different.
- Thank you.

465
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:13,006
I know I'm different, but from now on...

466
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,579
...I'm gonna try to be the same.

467
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,277
Same as what?

468
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,084
Same as people who aren't different.

469
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:23,617
- Good, thank you, and goodbye.
- Come on, give me a chance.

470
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:25,955
When you get to know me better
you'll like me.

471
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,585
I won't like you. Goodbye.

472
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:31,027
Let's not say goodbye,
let's just say au revoir.

473
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,932
No, let's say goodbye.

474
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,582
Enter Mrs. Van Hoskins' room
through the adjoining room...

475
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,550
...take the jewel case
and go to the basement.

476
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:55,282
- What if she wakes up and sees me?
- You'll tell her you are smitten with her.

477
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:59,122
That you had followed her all night,
and you will make passionate love to her.

478
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,489
Couldn't I just kill her?

479
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:39,288
That's crazy.

480
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:27,367
- Hello, out there.
- Hello.

481
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,040
- No, it must be brain damage.
- What?

482
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,186
I believe you dropped something.

483
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:46,754
- What do you think you're doing?
- I think I'm taking a bath.

484
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:49,990
If you're not out of here in two minutes,
I'm calling the police.

485
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:50,928
Who'll they arrest...

486
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,364
...the girl in the tub
or the guy with his pants down?

487
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:56,062
I am not joking now,
I do not like to act rashly...

488
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,003
...but you are the last straw
that breaks my camel's back.

489
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,097
You are the plague.

490
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:04,167
You bring havoc and chaos to everyone,
but why to me? Why me?

491
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:06,577
Because you look cute
in your pajamas, Steve.

492
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:07,839
Get out!

493
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,906
- Right now?
- Yes!

494
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,950
No, wait a minute!

495
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:15,086
Are you all right?

496
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,722
- I think I've broken several major bones.
- Let me see.

497
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,726
- Don't help me!
- Tell me where it hurts.

498
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:24,025
The ilium? The sacrum?
I hope it's not your coccyx.

499
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:26,293
I can't breathe.
Is it possible to break a lung?

500
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,164
I think your necktie's too tight.

501
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,432
- There. See? Now the phone is ringing.
- I'll get it.

502
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:32,631
I can do it.

503
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,303
Hello? Yes.

504
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,676
Eunice who? Oh, Eunice!

505
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:41,744
Howard, what's going on in there?

506
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,382
Nothing much, I fell down.

507
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:44,246
Are you hurt?

508
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,286
I'm feeling much better. Thanks for calling.

509
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:47,342
- Howard!
- Yes, Eunice?

510
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,117
- I'm coming in there.
- I wish you wouldn't do that.

511
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,920
I want to see if you're all right.

512
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:54,460
I am still very angry with you,
but I am concerned.

513
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:56,385
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

514
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:57,657
I think I'll get dressed.

515
00:41:57,731 --> 00:41:58,755
Who was that?

516
00:41:58,866 --> 00:41:59,730
Who was what?

517
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,062
I heard a voice say something...

518
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,693
...about getting dressed.

519
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:04,837
It's the television set, Eunice.

520
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:08,839
There's a war movie on.
They're getting dressed for the big battle.

521
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:10,137
It was a woman's voice.

522
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,771
They're lady soldiers.
It's called The Fighting WACs.

523
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:14,973
Do you have a bathrobe I could put on?

524
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,883
I'm coming in!

525
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,146
Well, that's it.

526
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,056
- Only one thing left to do.
- What's that, what?

527
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,753
Eunice is coming, you're here, like that.
And I'm going to jump.

528
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:29,193
- Steve.
- Goodbye.

529
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:33,165
- Steve, wait!
- I don't believe it. You did it again.

530
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,903
- Excuse me. Are you with the hotel?
- Why?

531
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,206
I would like the key to 1716,
my fiancé's in there...

532
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:45,802
...and I believe he's hurt himself.

533
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:48,507
Sorry, lady,
I'm looking for something in 1717.

534
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:51,649
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't even ask for it...

535
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,549
...but I think it's...

536
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,986
I got my orders
from the desk clerk downstairs.

537
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,649
I gotta go to 1717, so please,
don't bother me now.

538
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:11,729
Howard. Open this door, Howard.

539
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:14,439
Howard, I know you're in there.

540
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:15,966
Do you hear me?

541
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:19,103
Howard, open this door immediately!

542
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,502
Howard!

543
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:23,182
- What's wrong with the closet?
- She'll look in there.

544
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,842
What kind of a person is she?

545
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,180
Howard Bannister, I am talking to you.

546
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:29,248
I know you're in there.

547
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,553
I can't. I'm terrified of heights,
I'm acrophobic.

548
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,217
- There's a ledge.
- I'm ledge-a-phobic.

549
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,194
- Until I can get rid of her.
- I can't!

550
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:36,558
Howard, do you hear me?

551
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,655
- She has a violent temper.
- I can't!

552
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:39,323
Howard!

553
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,335
- She studies karate.
- Maybe I can.

554
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,168
Howard.

555
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:45,966
I am going to count to five.

556
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,338
Don't count, Eunice.
I hate it when you count.

557
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:49,301
One.

558
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,675
Two. Three.

559
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:55,180
Four.

560
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,713
Five!

561
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,615
Hello, Eunice, come on in.

562
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:15,394
Howard, if you have betrayed
my trust in you...

563
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:17,797
What's that?

564
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,938
That's a bath. I was going to take a bath.

565
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:24,239
Since when have you taken bubble baths?

566
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:27,108
It came out of the faucet that way, Eunice.

567
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:32,584
- Why are your rocks in the bathroom?
- I don't know, I wish I did, but I don't.

568
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:30,375
- What are you looking for, dear?
- Howard, you are not being open with me.

569
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:33,106
I am being open with you, Eunice,
I'm always open.

570
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,739
It's open.

571
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,880
Good evening.
Where do you want it, ma'am?

572
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,212
Where do I want what?

573
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:41,118
- Roast beef on rye. Mustard on top...
- I don't want food!

574
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:44,357
Room 1716, right?
Well, I'll just set it up over here.

575
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,386
- What's that?
- What's what?

576
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:51,761
- I hear knocking.
- It's your nerves.

577
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:07,978
- Why are you fiddling with the window?
- Too much fresh air, dear, very harmful.

578
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:11,084
Howard, will you turn off that...

579
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:12,175
...television?

580
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,295
Howard, if you don't turn that set off
I am going to scream!

581
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:28,162
You are screaming, Eunice.

582
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,663
Hey, have a heart, we're trying
to get some sleep down here.

583
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:32,727
Eunice.

584
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:39,946
- Pull the plug out.
- It's cable.

585
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:41,446
Pull the cable out.

586
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,038
Hey, come on.

587
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,259
I'm gonna call the police.

588
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,765
Down there.

589
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,865
Take the hose down the hallway.

590
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:45,970
Down here.

591
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:52,944
...the fire department go to 1716.

592
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:56,849
Miss Burns, what are you doing
in Mr. Bannister's room?

593
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,084
Don't you know the meaning propriety?

594
00:49:21,773 --> 00:49:22,569
Hello?

595
00:49:27,712 --> 00:49:30,010
Come in, it's broken. I mean, it's open.

596
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:44,889
Good morning.

597
00:49:45,263 --> 00:49:46,753
No, I don't think so.

598
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:51,194
I'm Mr. Kaltenborn,
the manager of what's left of the hotel.

599
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:56,273
I'm awfully sorry about this mess.
Usually this doesn't happen.

600
00:49:56,541 --> 00:50:00,068
Mr. Bannister, I have a message for you
from the staff of the hotel.

601
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:01,644
- What is it?
- Goodbye.

602
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:03,112
That's the entire message?

603
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:05,513
- We'd appreciate it if you'd check out.
- When?

604
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,608
- Yesterday.
- That soon?

605
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:11,950
I don't suppose you have another room
you could let me use just for...

606
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:13,855
No.

607
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:17,152
Oh, well.

608
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,960
These are my igneous Tambulu rocks.

609
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,198
Yes, of course they are.

610
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:39,940
Where were you thinking of going now?

611
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:43,282
My fiancée, Miss Sleep,
is still burning and...

612
00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:46,086
...Miss Burns is still sleeping.

613
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:49,886
I thought maybe
I would just sit in the lobby and wait.

614
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,162
I'm awfully sorry about the room.

615
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:01,104
That's all right, we have lots of others.

616
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:38,142
That's a nice view. I must be crazy.

617
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:43,145
I must be crazy. I'm looking at the view.
Eunice is going home.

618
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:23,612
"Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world, he walks into mine."

619
00:52:23,955 --> 00:52:25,149
"Play it, Sam."

620
00:52:26,758 --> 00:52:27,816
I don't...

621
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:35,755
C minor 7th.

622
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:13,532
That's very good.

623
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:31,153
Yeah.

624
00:53:52,677 --> 00:53:53,666
What's wrong?

625
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:54,900
The future.

626
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,109
What's the matter with it?

627
00:53:58,249 --> 00:54:00,479
Judging from the recent past...

628
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:03,586
Edmund Burke said, "You can never
plan the future by the past."

629
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:04,450
I beg your pardon?

630
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:07,855
You're wondering what a girl
like me is doing quoting Edmund Burke?

631
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,756
I was a political science major.

632
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:11,658
Did you learn about rocks there?

633
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:13,060
- You have a case like mine.
- Yes.

634
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:13,994
- No?
- No.

635
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,856
Advanced geology, Wellesley.

636
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:18,868
- What about the music?
- Bennington, musical appreciation.

637
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:22,167
Comp lit, Northwestern University.
Archaeology, Tuskegee Institute.

638
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:24,331
General semantics, University of Chicago.

639
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:26,808
Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M.
Say when.

640
00:54:26,878 --> 00:54:28,209
- Trying to become?
- A graduate.

641
00:54:28,279 --> 00:54:30,372
- Why is that important?
- It was to my father.

642
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:32,382
He was upset when I was
asked to leave college.

643
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,314
"Asked" to leave?

644
00:54:33,518 --> 00:54:35,577
- Bounced. You want to know why?
- No.

645
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:40,724
He sent me someplace else after that,
but it didn't work out. None of them did.

646
00:54:40,825 --> 00:54:43,453
Some of it was very nice,
I read a lot of good books.

647
00:54:43,528 --> 00:54:46,827
I went to a lot of movies, but something
always seemed to go wrong.

648
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:49,592
- I can believe that.
- This last time was not my fault!

649
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,360
What happened?

650
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:53,003
Nothing really.

651
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:56,602
It was just a little classroom.
It sort of burned down.

652
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:58,436
- Burned down?
- Blew up, actually.

653
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:00,702
- Political activism?
- Chemistry major.

654
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:03,803
- Now I'm really scared to go home.
- So am I.

655
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:05,039
How do you mean?

656
00:55:05,116 --> 00:55:08,643
Eunice and I came from Iowa.
The conservatory got together this fund...

657
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,914
...so that I could
come here and win this grant.

658
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:13,286
- I forgot to give you this letter!
- What letter?

659
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:15,723
It was under your door
when I came to your room.

660
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:18,387
- Did you open this?
- How else could I have read it?

661
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:22,295
- The grant! Mr. Larrabee!
- Yes!

662
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,301
- Yes, I saw.
- Oh, boy, the $20,000!

663
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:26,836
I know.

664
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:30,069
- I've got to tell Eunice.
- Of course you do.

665
00:55:30,274 --> 00:55:32,105
After all, she is...

666
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:36,175
- She is my fiancée.
- Of course she is.

667
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,241
She deserves to be the first.

668
00:55:40,518 --> 00:55:41,951
Or, at least, the second.

669
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:42,951
Yeah.

670
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,820
Where was I?

671
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:52,418
Eunice?

672
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:54,625
Who is Eunice?

673
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:04,973
Eunice?

674
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:06,433
Eunice?

675
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:09,706
Eunice, open the door,
I have some wonderful news.

676
00:56:12,116 --> 00:56:14,175
I do not want your apologies, Howard.

677
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:16,214
I think it is too late for that.

678
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,283
All right, Eunice, no apologies.

679
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:20,022
Have you no heart?

680
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:24,357
I'd think after what you have done to me
you'd come crawling for forgiveness.

681
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:27,022
Eunice, please let me read you this letter.

682
00:56:27,098 --> 00:56:29,566
"Dear Howard," do you hear that?
"Howard."

683
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,099
That is your name.

684
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:34,069
"The committee agreed that barring
unforeseen circumstances...

685
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:36,935
"...you'll be the next recipient
of the Larrabee Grant.

686
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:40,239
"Please join me
for a luncheon at my house, around noon...

687
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:43,371
"...and bring your charming
fiancée. Sincerely, Frederick."

688
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:44,675
Look, Eunice, "Frederick."

689
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:46,376
How he could refer to me as your...

690
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,078
..."charming fiancée"
when he's never met me?

691
00:56:49,153 --> 00:56:51,121
We can straighten all that out.

692
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:54,890
All right, Howard.
It will take me some time to get dressed.

693
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:57,359
You go without me,
and I'll follow as soon as possible.

694
00:56:57,428 --> 00:56:59,658
- The address, please?
- 888 Russian Hill.

695
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,459
And Eunice...

696
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:20,680
888 Russian Hill.

697
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:24,019
Take it to 459 Dirello Street.

698
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:26,315
Deliver it to the boys on the second floor.

699
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:28,357
459 Dirello Street.

700
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,830
It's settled, Eunice will meet us there.
I really think it's going to work.

701
00:57:36,934 --> 00:57:39,266
- What could go wrong?
- Please, don't you say that.

702
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:41,827
Tell Mr. Larrabee
that Eunice is really Eunice...

703
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:44,373
...and the Eunice he thinks is Eunice
isn't Eunice.

704
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:45,807
- What will you say?
- About what?

705
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,878
- Yourself.
- I'll say I'm a girl you picked up.

706
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:52,348
- No. You don't say anything.
- Right, I just sit there and nod.

707
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:56,450
Yes. Then this whole terrible episode
will be over.

708
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:57,713
What about us?

709
00:57:57,788 --> 00:58:01,315
We'll say goodbye.
It's that simple. I think.

710
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:04,087
Okay. You go get a taxi,
I'll be out in a minute.

711
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:10,400
Miss Eunice Burns, please.

712
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:13,826
Yes?

713
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:17,407
Miss Burns, this is Sylvia,
Mr. Larrabee's personal secretary.

714
00:58:17,608 --> 00:58:19,667
There's been a mix-up in the invitation.

715
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:22,677
The luncheon has been switched
from Mr. Larrabee's home...

716
00:58:22,747 --> 00:58:24,578
...to one of the Larrabee offices.

717
00:58:24,682 --> 00:58:26,513
Mr. Bannister has already gone...

718
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:29,177
I caught Mr. Bannister on his way out
and told him.

719
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,686
- The address is, do you have a pencil?
- Yes.

720
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:33,983
- 459 Dirello Street.
- Dirello?

721
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:35,082
Second floor.

722
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:37,558
- Thank you, Miss...
- Louise.

723
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,287
I thought you said, "Sylvia."

724
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,625
Yes, Sylvia-Louise,
you know with a hyphen?

725
00:58:54,245 --> 00:58:55,337
Excuse me.

726
00:59:14,632 --> 00:59:16,657
Robbed! All of my jewels!

727
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:18,892
Help! All of my jewels.

728
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,933
Thieves! Robbers!

729
00:59:30,648 --> 00:59:33,116
Are you sure this is the right address?

730
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,151
459 Dirello Street, lady.
You don't want me to wait, do you?

731
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:37,277
Yes, I do.

732
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:38,184
I didn't think so.

733
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:11,616
Hello?

734
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,157
Hello?

735
01:00:21,332 --> 01:00:23,232
Hello?

736
01:00:31,275 --> 01:00:33,402
This can't be the Larrabee...

737
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:37,113
Those are Howard's.

738
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:40,477
What on earth are you doing
with Howard Bannister's rocks?

739
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:59,126
Thank you very much.

740
01:01:23,761 --> 01:01:27,720
There they are, our two stars.
Congratulations, Howard.

741
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:29,698
- Thank you, Mr. Larrabee.
- Frederick.

742
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,393
I have something very important
to tell you.

743
01:01:32,503 --> 01:01:34,403
Come with me and meet my friends.

744
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:36,004
May I take that, sir?

745
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:38,404
No, thank you, I'll hold on to it.

746
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:43,437
I see you're all dressed up
for a celebration.

747
01:01:43,514 --> 01:01:45,141
- What happened, Bollister?
- Bannister.

748
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:47,547
All of your other clothes burn up?

749
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:57,215
- You remember our Mr. Simon.
- Miss Burns, isn't it?

750
01:01:57,928 --> 01:02:00,260
- No, it's Burnsy.
- Of course.

751
01:02:00,731 --> 01:02:03,131
Ladies and gentlemen, and Mr. Larrabee.

752
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,996
Frederick!

753
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:06,059
Mr. Frederick. What I want to say...

754
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:09,536
What Howard's trying to says is
how much he appreciates your hospitality.

755
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,131
We'll both think of you
when we're back in Iowa.

756
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,800
What compelling sentiments.

757
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:16,675
Did anyone ever tell you
that you were very sexy?

758
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,338
Well, actually, no.

759
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:19,677
They never will.

760
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:26,946
I have a little announcement to make
that may be of some interest.

761
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:32,028
My natural curiosity was aroused,
and so I did a little research...

762
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:34,690
...on Mr. Bannister and Miss Burns
and I think...

763
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,461
I think it can wait until Howard
has given us a little recital...

764
01:02:38,602 --> 01:02:40,763
...on those famous rocks of his.

765
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:42,565
How about it, Howard?

766
01:02:42,773 --> 01:02:43,933
All right.

767
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:47,640
For those of you unfamiliar
with Dr. Bannister's theory...

768
01:02:47,778 --> 01:02:51,077
...of percussional and prehistoric
and rhythmical communications...

769
01:02:51,215 --> 01:02:52,773
...let me try to point out...

770
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,613
What's the matter?

771
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:57,146
- Is something the matter?
- Wrong case!

772
01:02:57,321 --> 01:02:58,811
Identical traveling cases.

773
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:00,287
Sweet, isn't it?

774
01:03:00,357 --> 01:03:02,917
Excuse me, Mr. Larrabee,
I wanted to ask you something.

775
01:03:02,993 --> 01:03:04,824
What were you saying about...

776
01:03:06,296 --> 01:03:08,526
I think a slight mistake has been made.

777
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:11,862
A slight mistake,
Mesdames and Messieurs...

778
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:15,631
...is in the so-called identity
of these alleged colleagues.

779
01:03:15,773 --> 01:03:19,641
I don't know who he is,
but she is definitely not herself.

780
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,437
What are you babbling about, Simon?

781
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,070
Nobody move!

782
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:24,673
Get over there.

783
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:28,282
I want that case.

784
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:29,650
Which one?

785
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:30,945
- What?
- Which one?

786
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:33,146
Either one! Just slide it over here.

787
01:03:37,428 --> 01:03:38,395
Don't move!

788
01:03:38,562 --> 01:03:40,052
Get away from that case.

789
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:44,761
This is inexcusable.
You can't come in here uninvited.

790
01:03:44,902 --> 01:03:46,028
Stand back, all of you.

791
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:50,266
All I want is that one, or that one,
or maybe that one.

792
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:51,668
Throw that up here.

793
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:02,408
Howard! They've got your rocks!

794
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:05,144
- Don't nobody do nothing!
- This is unheard of.

795
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:07,416
Throw down the case and the gun.

796
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:12,726
Don't shoot me, I'm part Italian.

797
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:13,885
Button it!

798
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:16,295
Don't kick those rocks, you Philistine!

799
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,264
Shut up!

800
01:04:17,468 --> 01:04:20,699
Don't you dare strike that brave,
unbalanced woman!

801
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:37,351
Mister!

802
01:04:47,197 --> 01:04:48,721
Grab his legs!

803
01:04:57,741 --> 01:04:59,333
Give me that.

804
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:13,621
- Having fun?
- I can't find my rocks!

805
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:14,782
- Grab the cases.
- Which ones?

806
01:05:14,858 --> 01:05:16,018
All of them!

807
01:05:25,936 --> 01:05:27,597
Don't!

808
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:32,067
How many cases are there?

809
01:05:32,142 --> 01:05:34,576
- I believe there're four of them.
- I've got three.

810
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:52,020
Wait a minute.

811
01:05:52,196 --> 01:05:53,823
Stick them in here.

812
01:05:57,234 --> 01:05:58,895
- How are your legs?
- My legs?

813
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,526
Never mind, push!

814
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:08,073
Hey!

815
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:15,515
Come on.

816
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:17,677
- What?
- Get on!

817
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:21,784
Come on, Steve, you can do it!

818
01:06:21,858 --> 01:06:23,382
My name is Howard.

819
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:28,126
We are going to lose them
if you don't hurry.

820
01:06:38,976 --> 01:06:41,968
Follow that cab, I'm with the government!

821
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:43,237
All right.

822
01:06:46,817 --> 01:06:47,875
Here they come.

823
01:06:48,085 --> 01:06:49,211
Hang on!

824
01:06:55,058 --> 01:06:56,685
Come on, Harry, keep going.

825
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,181
You're in my way, I can't see!

826
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:26,253
No!

827
01:07:26,356 --> 01:07:27,823
- What is it?
- Don't ask.

828
01:08:15,806 --> 01:08:17,569
- Put on the brakes.
- I am!

829
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:16,663
No!

830
01:09:38,622 --> 01:09:41,489
- Where are we? I can't see.
- There's not much to see...

831
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:43,716
...we're inside a Chinese dragon.

832
01:10:42,986 --> 01:10:43,782
Let's go.

833
01:10:58,835 --> 01:11:02,134
- Wait, I know where the alley comes out.
- All right, let's go.

834
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:17,482
I've got an idea. Follow me.

835
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:19,915
- What's the idea?
- Stick with me.

836
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:22,356
No! Thank you very much.

837
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:26,317
- This is a terrible thing we're doing.
- It's fantastic, you'll love it.

838
01:11:27,898 --> 01:11:29,889
I'm sorry, we'll be right back.

839
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:02,061
What are you doing?
This is a one-way street!

840
01:12:02,132 --> 01:12:03,724
We're only going one way!

841
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:10,973
- Look out!
- I am looking out.

842
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:12,235
Oh, no!

843
01:12:17,247 --> 01:12:18,839
- What are you doing?
- Driving!

844
01:12:18,915 --> 01:12:20,542
- I know that!
- It's my first time.

845
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,412
It's a cinch.

846
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:25,181
- What does this thing do over here?
- Let me do it, for Pete's sake!

847
01:12:26,823 --> 01:12:28,654
Look out for that thing!

848
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:37,999
Will you turn off those things?

849
01:12:38,134 --> 01:12:39,294
How?

850
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:40,936
That's the radio!

851
01:12:42,906 --> 01:12:44,464
How are we doing?

852
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:47,908
Here they come! Turn here!

853
01:12:48,078 --> 01:12:49,943
Okay. I'm turning!

854
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:54,309
- Look at that! Go there!
- What? No!

855
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:55,441
Yes!

856
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:00,244
Duck!

857
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:06,559
Now what?

858
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,789
- Back up.
- I knew you'd say that.

859
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:18,199
Where are they?

860
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:20,468
- Mr. Larrabee, will you help me?
- Frederick!

861
01:13:20,577 --> 01:13:23,978
- Frederick, will you help me?
- Yes, I will. Who are you?

862
01:13:24,147 --> 01:13:25,273
I am Eunice Burns.

863
01:13:25,415 --> 01:13:28,179
Who cares who she is,
we're going to be killed!

864
01:13:28,318 --> 01:13:29,546
We'll all be killed!

865
01:13:33,289 --> 01:13:34,813
I think we lost them.

866
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:36,882
Would you turn the radio off, please?

867
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:38,082
Sure.

868
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:41,663
- I better turn down there to be sure.
- Okay.

869
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:46,192
Sorry!

870
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:14,721
They're gaining on us.

871
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:17,190
There's a good road right down there.

872
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:18,366
Okay.

873
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,247
I can't see where we're going!

874
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:40,788
Let me clean your glasses.

875
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,721
Now I really can't see!

876
01:14:44,994 --> 01:14:46,393
Judy, I can't see.

877
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:50,064
Oh, God, I can see.

878
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:56,462
They're headed for the ferry!

879
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,038
- Follow them!
- Okay!

880
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,304
- We can make it!
- No.

881
01:15:06,049 --> 01:15:07,311
We can make it!

882
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,444
I don't think we can make it.

883
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:19,017
Where are they going?

884
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,766
Help!

885
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,466
No, I mean, I'll help you.

886
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:09,300
Look at them.

887
01:16:12,215 --> 01:16:15,275
A foul and depraved-Iooking lot, Bailiff.

888
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:18,513
Those are just the spectators, Your Honor.

889
01:16:19,722 --> 01:16:21,121
Of course...

890
01:16:22,559 --> 01:16:23,651
Get on with it.

891
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:24,852
All stand!

892
01:16:24,928 --> 01:16:27,556
Hear ye, all those present.
Let it be known court...

893
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:30,463
...is now in session as of this day,
the 30th of July, 1972.

894
01:16:30,567 --> 01:16:33,001
His Honor Marvin B. Maxwell presiding.

895
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:39,401
Sit down.

896
01:16:40,944 --> 01:16:42,741
I don't want any noise tonight.

897
01:16:42,846 --> 01:16:46,839
I don't want any disturbances
or demonstrations of any kind.

898
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:49,711
I want peace and calm and order.

899
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:53,789
If there is any nonsense, of any sort...

900
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:56,753
...I will be merciless. Merciless!

901
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:59,461
Is that clearly understood?

902
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:02,063
Do you think they understood that, Bailiff?

903
01:17:02,165 --> 01:17:03,860
Yes, sir, I'm sure they did.

904
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,163
Let's get tonight's horror show
on the road.

905
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:09,429
Is Your Honor feeling all right?

906
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:11,871
No, My Honor is not feeling all right.

907
01:17:12,075 --> 01:17:15,841
My head is pounding, my metabolism
has practically ceased to function...

908
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:17,809
...and my nerves are shot.

909
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:19,505
That's too bad, sir.

910
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:23,243
Do you have any idea what it's like
to sit here night after night...

911
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:27,380
...and watch this endless parade
of human debris floating by?

912
01:17:27,457 --> 01:17:28,856
Yes, sir, of course I have.

913
01:17:28,925 --> 01:17:31,086
No, you don't.

914
01:17:31,294 --> 01:17:32,989
You don't have to make up your mind...

915
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:36,156
...whether to put them away
in some ghastly hellhole.

916
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:40,729
Or turn them all loose
to commit some other hideous offense.

917
01:17:42,138 --> 01:17:45,699
I'd like to send every one of them
to an island somewhere...

918
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,501
...wrapped in heavy chains.

919
01:17:51,781 --> 01:17:53,646
Do you know why I don't, Bailiff?

920
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:54,545
Why, Judge?

921
01:17:54,684 --> 01:17:55,878
Compassion.

922
01:17:57,287 --> 01:18:00,154
I just have too much compassion.

923
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:03,149
And that's why I'm a wreck.

924
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,327
You see this yellow pill?

925
01:18:05,428 --> 01:18:06,486
Yes, sir.

926
01:18:07,163 --> 01:18:08,562
You know what it's for?

927
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:09,791
What, Judge?

928
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:13,061
To remind me to take this blue pill.

929
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:15,394
What's the blue one for, Judge?

930
01:18:16,873 --> 01:18:18,170
I don't know.

931
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,603
They're afraid to tell me.

932
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,411
Your Honor,
I think it'll be pretty quiet tonight.

933
01:18:24,514 --> 01:18:28,678
It was deliberate.
You have no right pushing!

934
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:41,819
Silence!

935
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,362
Silence, silence, silence!

936
01:18:46,836 --> 01:18:47,860
Shut it!

937
01:18:48,738 --> 01:18:49,568
Everyone.

938
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:54,275
If there are any further outbursts
of this nature, I'll give somebody orders...

939
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,968
...to shoot to kill.

940
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:00,746
You've made me smash my Life Savers.

941
01:19:00,917 --> 01:19:05,081
Now we're going to get this story
calmly and clearly.

942
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:07,248
First of all...

943
01:19:07,824 --> 01:19:10,418
...just what the devil are these?

944
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,187
- My rocks.
- My jewelry.

945
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:14,422
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

946
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,225
Whom do these cases belong to?

947
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:17,197
The government!

948
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:18,766
I want my bike back.

949
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:20,898
I'll give your bike back.

950
01:19:21,004 --> 01:19:23,871
I'll give you a broken back
if you don't be quiet.

951
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,064
Officer.

952
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:29,369
What are these people being charged with?

953
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:31,504
That's kind's hard to say, Judge.

954
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:32,946
Give it a shot.

955
01:19:33,016 --> 01:19:36,315
Well, sir, we picked some of them out
of San Francisco Bay.

956
01:19:36,452 --> 01:19:38,181
Entering the country illegally?

957
01:19:38,254 --> 01:19:39,881
No, sir, they drove in.

958
01:19:40,023 --> 01:19:41,923
- Into the country?
- Into the bay.

959
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:43,490
That's better.

960
01:19:43,793 --> 01:19:46,125
Unauthorized use of public waters.

961
01:19:46,496 --> 01:19:48,225
Mostly in stolen cars.

962
01:19:49,999 --> 01:19:51,728
That's grand larceny.

963
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:54,231
Then, there was a shooting.

964
01:19:54,337 --> 01:19:56,271
That's assault with a deadly weapon.

965
01:19:56,406 --> 01:19:58,340
They broke into my home.

966
01:19:58,508 --> 01:20:00,408
That's breaking and entering.

967
01:20:00,543 --> 01:20:02,909
And they brought her with them, forcibly.

968
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:04,906
That's kidnapping.

969
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:07,048
They tried to molest me.

970
01:20:07,817 --> 01:20:10,547
That's unbelievable.

971
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,177
Your Honor,
I can clear all this up in 10 seconds.

972
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:16,189
- You do, and you'll get a prize.
- May I approach the bench?

973
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:18,750
Yes. Watch him like a hawk.

974
01:20:18,895 --> 01:20:21,329
As you can see,
I represent our government.

975
01:20:21,431 --> 01:20:22,489
God bless it!

976
01:20:22,632 --> 01:20:24,190
Shut up! Go on.

977
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:27,065
Your Honor, I have been following
this person's movements...

978
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,331
...for quite some time and I can prove...

979
01:20:29,472 --> 01:20:33,203
...that he is in unauthorized possession
of secret government...

980
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:34,604
...underwear.

981
01:20:34,777 --> 01:20:35,869
Underwear?

982
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:39,105
- Get the court psychiatrist.
- Watch out, those might be my rocks.

983
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:41,980
- Tell him to bring straight jackets.
- We have a right to know!

984
01:20:42,085 --> 01:20:43,484
In assorted sizes.

985
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,713
- Order in the court!
- Order in the court!

986
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:51,016
- Everyone be quiet!
- Everyone be quiet!

987
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:51,890
- Silence!
- Silence!

988
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:53,360
- You, too.
- Me, too.

989
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:56,593
Now, this is a court of law...

990
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,192
...my court of law!

991
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:02,727
It may not look like much to you,
but it's all I've got!

992
01:21:03,806 --> 01:21:06,468
Ordinarily I would threaten you
with contempt.

993
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:11,672
But in this case, and I think
the Supreme Court will back me up...

994
01:21:12,482 --> 01:21:16,009
...I am seriously considering
setting up a torture chamber!

995
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:22,089
I want this whole ridiculous story...

996
01:21:22,492 --> 01:21:24,392
...told by one person.

997
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:27,295
Does anybody here think
they can handle it?

998
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:32,091
All right.

999
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:34,066
And while he's telling it...

1000
01:21:34,504 --> 01:21:36,768
...the rest of you keep whips...

1001
01:21:37,507 --> 01:21:39,771
...red-hot irons in the back of your minds.

1002
01:21:40,243 --> 01:21:43,235
Sir, my name is Howard Bannister
and I'm from Ames, Iowa.

1003
01:21:43,412 --> 01:21:44,436
No excuse.

1004
01:21:44,514 --> 01:21:47,506
No, sir, it all started
when I bumped my head in the taxi...

1005
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:49,141
...on the way in from the airport.

1006
01:21:49,252 --> 01:21:51,083
Are you pleading insanity or amnesia?

1007
01:21:51,154 --> 01:21:54,317
Neither. I went to the drugstore
to get something for a headache...

1008
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,483
...the druggist tried to charge me
for a radio.

1009
01:21:56,559 --> 01:21:59,892
She said her husband would pay for it.
But I didn't, of course.

1010
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:01,296
Of course.

1011
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:03,889
She ripped my jacket
and when Eunice came along...

1012
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,457
- Who's Eunice?
- Eunice is my fiancée.

1013
01:22:07,637 --> 01:22:09,002
You have a wife and a fiancée?

1014
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:11,570
No, sir. But, she kept calling me "Steve."

1015
01:22:12,408 --> 01:22:14,273
Your own fiancée calls you Steve?

1016
01:22:14,443 --> 01:22:17,901
No, sir, my wife.
Or rather the one who isn't my wife.

1017
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:21,909
What does the one who isn't your fiancée
call you? Howard?

1018
01:22:22,084 --> 01:22:25,144
No, sir, the one who isn't my fiancée
doesn't call me Howard.

1019
01:22:25,221 --> 01:22:27,416
The one who isn't my wife
doesn't call me Howard.

1020
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:30,220
The one who isn't my fiancée
also isn't my wife.

1021
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:32,853
The other one who isn't my wife,
who is my fiancée...

1022
01:22:32,962 --> 01:22:36,489
...she doesn't call me Steve.
She calls me Howard. Do you see?

1023
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:41,029
Let's just skip over this part, and move on.

1024
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:44,438
That night at the banquet
she was there again.

1025
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:46,871
Who was there, your wife or your fiancée?

1026
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:47,839
Neither.

1027
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:48,899
There's a third?

1028
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:52,379
No, sir, the one who isn't either.
Everyone was calling her "Burnsy."

1029
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:55,542
- Why?
- That's short for Burns, Eunice's last name.

1030
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:57,085
Eunice was there.

1031
01:22:57,186 --> 01:23:00,644
No, sir, Burnsy was there, or rather,
the one who isn't Burnsy.

1032
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:07,291
I think I want to skip over this part, too.

1033
01:23:07,363 --> 01:23:10,332
That night, I went back to my room
and she was in the bath.

1034
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,698
Who was there?
No, don't tell me, just go on.

1035
01:23:14,103 --> 01:23:16,594
When Eunice walked in
and the drapes caught fire.

1036
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:18,435
Everything burned.
They asked me to leave.

1037
01:23:18,507 --> 01:23:20,236
I really don't blame them.

1038
01:23:20,476 --> 01:23:21,500
Good boy.

1039
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:23,242
- Is there more?
- Sure.

1040
01:23:23,312 --> 01:23:25,803
- There's more.
- Well, the next day, today...

1041
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:29,484
...Mr. Larrabee asked me to his house
with my rocks and to bring Eunice.

1042
01:23:29,552 --> 01:23:31,850
Or rather, Burnsy,
the one he thinks is Eunice.

1043
01:23:31,921 --> 01:23:34,321
- Is that clear?
- No, but it's consistent.

1044
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:37,585
- Shall I go back over it?
- No, please, I beg you, don't.

1045
01:23:38,027 --> 01:23:39,153
Just go on.

1046
01:23:40,196 --> 01:23:42,391
It gets kind of complicated now.

1047
01:23:42,832 --> 01:23:45,630
First, there was this trouble
between me and Hugh.

1048
01:23:46,135 --> 01:23:48,194
- You and me?
- No, not you, Hugh.

1049
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:49,363
I am Hugh.

1050
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:51,770
- You are me?
- No, I am Hugh.

1051
01:23:52,775 --> 01:23:55,642
Stop saying that.
Make him stop saying that.

1052
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:57,804
- Don't touch me, I'm a doctor.
- Of what?

1053
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,541
- Music.
- Can you fix a hi-fi?

1054
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:00,673
- No, sir.
- Then shut up!

1055
01:24:01,517 --> 01:24:05,977
He came in and tried to get my case,
and then he came in and tried to get his...

1056
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:08,523
...then they came in
and tried to get all the cases...

1057
01:24:08,591 --> 01:24:09,489
...then shooting started.

1058
01:24:09,558 --> 01:24:12,459
They forced me to come.
I was out in the car the whole time!

1059
01:24:12,528 --> 01:24:13,859
You little fink!

1060
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:18,560
Silence.

1061
01:24:20,236 --> 01:24:21,430
Silence!

1062
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:25,398
Order! Now this is my last warning!

1063
01:24:26,876 --> 01:24:31,040
I intend to get to the bottom of this
web of deceit and confusion...

1064
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:32,740
...if it takes me the rest of my life!

1065
01:24:32,815 --> 01:24:34,646
Which may end at any minute.

1066
01:24:37,086 --> 01:24:38,610
Now, you.

1067
01:24:39,155 --> 01:24:40,645
You in the blanket.

1068
01:24:41,023 --> 01:24:43,082
You seem to have caused all this.

1069
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:45,923
Exactly what have you got
to say for yourself?

1070
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,796
- Judy!
- Hello, Daddy.

1071
01:25:25,935 --> 01:25:27,402
Got your rocks back?

1072
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,394
Got your things back.

1073
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:33,368
- Going somewhere?
- Back to school.

1074
01:25:33,776 --> 01:25:35,869
- Another one.
- Sure.

1075
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:38,172
According to the 1970 enrollment studies...

1076
01:25:38,247 --> 01:25:41,273
...there are one 1,145 institutions
of higher education.

1077
01:25:43,386 --> 01:25:45,286
I've got quite a few to go.

1078
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:48,850
Look at that!

1079
01:25:48,924 --> 01:25:52,325
Could you give me information
about flights to Rio de Janeiro?

1080
01:25:57,633 --> 01:25:59,328
It wasn't all so bad, was it?

1081
01:26:00,136 --> 01:26:03,572
Of course, it was terrible,
that they took the grant away from you.

1082
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:06,506
They had to do that,
the Larrabee Foundation isn't used...

1083
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:08,873
...to having to bail its founder out of jail.

1084
01:26:08,944 --> 01:26:11,037
There are a lot of other grants.

1085
01:26:11,113 --> 01:26:14,082
- I was reading...
- I wish you wouldn't tell me about it.

1086
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:17,381
You see, you have this way
of making everything sound reasonable...

1087
01:26:17,453 --> 01:26:20,547
...and then rooms begin to burn,
people start to chase people...

1088
01:26:20,623 --> 01:26:22,022
Look at that!

1089
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:38,301
- I guess I owe you $20,000.
- Don't be silly.

1090
01:26:38,374 --> 01:26:41,104
If I paid you off at $10 a week,
we'd be even...

1091
01:26:41,177 --> 01:26:43,941
...in 38 years and 5 and a half months.
- You did that fast.

1092
01:26:44,013 --> 01:26:46,504
- New math, Mount Holyoke.
- Miss Maxwell.

1093
01:26:46,849 --> 01:26:48,840
- Hello, young man.
- Mrs. Van Hoskins.

1094
01:26:48,918 --> 01:26:52,718
Miss Maxwell, as you may know,
there was a $20,000 reward...

1095
01:26:52,788 --> 01:26:55,256
...for the return of my jewels.
- $20,000!

1096
01:26:55,324 --> 01:26:58,122
I paid for the damage done to your room,
that was $2,800.

1097
01:26:58,194 --> 01:27:01,220
And then that little car you were in,
that was $2,400.

1098
01:27:01,397 --> 01:27:03,558
Of course, the two other cars, let me see...

1099
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:06,396
...there was $3,400 for the taxi...

1100
01:27:06,769 --> 01:27:10,068
I guess I'd better have my little list.

1101
01:27:10,706 --> 01:27:13,504
Yes, of course. $2,600 for the other.

1102
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:16,243
Now the pane of glass you broke
was $1,600.

1103
01:27:16,312 --> 01:27:19,611
Damages to a costume store, a restaurant,
a delivery cart...

1104
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:22,680
...and, goodness me, a Chinese dragon.

1105
01:27:23,085 --> 01:27:24,882
$3,850.

1106
01:27:24,954 --> 01:27:28,890
One canopy, $2,300
and $1,000 in court costs...

1107
01:27:29,258 --> 01:27:30,885
...making a grand total of...

1108
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,554
...$19,950.

1109
01:27:33,629 --> 01:27:36,860
Leaving $50 to be split between you two...

1110
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:40,135
...and the cab driver
and that dear little old man...

1111
01:27:40,202 --> 01:27:42,670
...and, of course,
the gentlemen from the government.

1112
01:27:42,738 --> 01:27:46,367
And there you are, my dear.
And God bless you. Michael.

1113
01:27:48,644 --> 01:27:51,841
That leaves only 38 years,
5 months and 1 week to go.

1114
01:27:53,549 --> 01:27:55,278
See, sometimes it's kind of fun.

1115
01:27:55,351 --> 01:27:58,320
- I know, but...
- Don't tell me, you need peace and quiet.

1116
01:27:58,387 --> 01:27:59,581
That's right.

1117
01:28:03,759 --> 01:28:06,159
- You'll miss me.
- I know that, too.

1118
01:28:09,932 --> 01:28:10,899
Well.

1119
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:15,670
Well.

1120
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:20,436
- Howard, Howard Bannister!
- We have come to see Mr. Simon off.

1121
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:23,967
- What are you doing here, Eunice?
- No hard feelings, Bannister?

1122
01:28:24,213 --> 01:28:25,874
- C'est la vie.
- C'est la guerre.

1123
01:28:25,948 --> 01:28:27,210
C'est la dreck.

1124
01:28:27,283 --> 01:28:31,185
I will be catching my plane now,
so it will be arrivederci to all.

1125
01:28:31,253 --> 01:28:33,278
- Don't forget this, Simon.
- What?

1126
01:28:33,722 --> 01:28:34,711
The check.

1127
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:37,691
Would you care
to have just a look at it, Bannister?

1128
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:42,197
- That's very nice.
- You deserved it, Howard, you really did.

1129
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:45,532
I suppose there are some
who think there's some merit...

1130
01:28:45,601 --> 01:28:48,331
...in the study of prehistoric
mineral tampings...

1131
01:28:48,404 --> 01:28:51,805
...but I think the Hugh Simon theory
of Swiss scale patterns...

1132
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:55,139
...will stand the test of time.
- What is that theory, Mr. Simon?

1133
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:58,202
- I doubt you're qualified to understand.
- Try me.

1134
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,410
The Simon theory advances the notion
that 16th-17th century Swiss composers...

1135
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:03,246
Yes?

1136
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:05,150
Developed a uni-tonic scale pattern...

1137
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:09,486
...based upon the uniform intervals
utilized in the mountaineer yodel.

1138
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:11,423
- You developed this theory?
- I invented it.

1139
01:29:11,493 --> 01:29:14,053
That should come as some shock
to Professor Findelmeyer.

1140
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:16,597
- What are you talking about?
- The Findelmeyer Proposition.

1141
01:29:16,665 --> 01:29:18,792
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Sure you do!

1142
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:20,391
That has never been translated.

1143
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:23,336
Just once!
1925, Harvard Press Musicological Review.

1144
01:29:23,405 --> 01:29:25,168
- It's probably out of print...
- Of course!

1145
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,573
Professor Hydrich Findelmeyer,
the University of Zurich, 1911.

1146
01:29:28,811 --> 01:29:33,510
The controversial Findelmeyer Proposition.
No wonder it sounded so familiar.

1147
01:29:33,616 --> 01:29:36,107
- I'm sorry, Simon.
- This is unspeakable!

1148
01:29:36,485 --> 01:29:40,216
Simon, you're a plagiarist.
What's worse, you're a bad loser.

1149
01:29:40,289 --> 01:29:42,655
I don't like you and I want you to go away!

1150
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:45,455
The Foundation will make out
a new check...

1151
01:29:45,561 --> 01:29:47,961
...and send it on to you
at the conservatory.

1152
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:50,157
- Thank you, Mr. Larrabee.
- Frederick.

1153
01:30:02,544 --> 01:30:05,741
Howard, I've asked Eunice
to stay on with me for a few days.

1154
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:07,839
In separate quarters, of course.

1155
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:08,744
Of course.

1156
01:30:08,817 --> 01:30:12,651
We've shared a great deal
in the past day or so, and I think perhaps...

1157
01:30:12,988 --> 01:30:14,421
You know what I mean.

1158
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:17,948
Goodbye, Howard. You'd better hurry
or you'll miss your plane.

1159
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:22,121
Come, Frederick, now it is 12:05
and the lecture starts promptly at 1:00.

1160
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:24,788
Well, Judy, I guess...

1161
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:27,133
Judy?

1162
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:31,461
Judy.

1163
01:30:37,046 --> 01:30:42,916
United Airlines Flight 634,
boarding through Gate 62.

1164
01:31:09,445 --> 01:31:12,539
What? No, I'm a transfer student.

1165
01:31:13,015 --> 01:31:15,848
No, not the University,
the Conservatory of Music.

1166
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:18,520
It's in Ames. You never heard of it?

1167
01:31:18,587 --> 01:31:20,987
It's a small conservatory,
but people love it.

1168
01:31:21,056 --> 01:31:23,581
There's a professor there
whom I hope to study with...

1169
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:26,059
...a brilliant man, Dr. Howard Bannister.

1170
01:31:26,128 --> 01:31:28,528
No, Bannister as in "sliding down the."

1171
01:31:29,498 --> 01:31:30,692
You have heard of him?

1172
01:31:30,766 --> 01:31:33,257
Yeah, that's right, the nut with the rocks.

1173
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:36,567
What's up, doc?

1174
01:31:36,672 --> 01:31:39,539
Did you happen to know that I love you?

1175
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,468
- Yeah.
- You did? Do?

1176
01:31:43,145 --> 01:31:45,705
Listen, kiddo, you can't fight a tidal wave!

1177
01:31:51,954 --> 01:31:55,481
About those things I said, I mean,
the way I acted back there...

1178
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:56,649
...I'm sorry.

1179
01:31:56,725 --> 01:31:58,215
Let me tell you something.

1180
01:31:58,293 --> 01:32:01,023
"Love means never having
to say you're sorry."

1181
01:32:03,932 --> 01:32:06,230
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.

1182
01:32:07,636 --> 01:32:09,729
"We really mean it

1183
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:15,198
"What's up

1184
01:32:17,146 --> 01:32:18,340
"Doc?"

1185
01:32:26,522 --> 01:32:28,387
That's all, folks.

1186
01:33:44,366 --> 01:33:46,630
English
