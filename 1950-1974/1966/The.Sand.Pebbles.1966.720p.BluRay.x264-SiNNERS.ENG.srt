1
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,146
- You got orders?
- Yeah.

2
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,287
Check in. Stay off the streets.
There's no liberty.

3
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,122
Right.

4
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:25,908
- Where's Mitch?
- He died a couple of months ago.

5
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:29,495
- What happened?
- Just didn't wake up one morning.

6
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,457
I was a shipmate of his. Name's Baxter.
Ex-chief signalman. I took over.

7
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,502
- Everything?
- Yeah, everything.

8
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:41,298
Gimme a UB of whiskey.

9
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:45,218
- He was all right, though.
- They start liberty again?

10
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:48,847
Nah. Transferrin' to a new ship.
The <i>San Pablo.</i>

11
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,684
You can have my part of that.
Them gunboats are nothin'.

12
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:56,354
- Well, they got engines, ain't they?
- Sure.

13
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:00,107
Well, then they ain't nothin'.

14
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:08,866
- You likee me?
- Oh, much like all the sailor man!

15
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:12,203
Uniform gets 'em every time.

16
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,801
We can't threaten them into being our friends.

17
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,012
- Exactly.
- Then what's the point?

18
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,682
Now, you can hate the gunboats
and what they represent, Jameson,

19
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:38,436
but you missionaries
are only tolerated because we have them.

20
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,773
- I question that.
- The Chinese'd run you out, otherwise.

21
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:45,777
They hate you and despise you.
Dare you know that?

22
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,031
I dare love them in return,
and I dare trust God rather than guns.

23
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,825
Yes, but when there are anti-foreign riots,

24
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:56,119
how often have you fled
to the gunboat for protection?

25
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:59,331
To my shame, twice. But never again.

26
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,542
My name is Hamilton.

27
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,920
- Holman.
- How do you do? This is Miss Eckert.

28
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:11,301
And Mr Jameson. As you may have gathered,
Mr Jameson is a missionary. Miss Eckert, too.

29
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:13,720
- And this is Mr Outscout.
- How do you do?

30
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:16,222
British.

31
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:21,811
- Where are you headed?
- Uh, <i>San Pablo.</i> Gunboat.

32
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:25,273
Well, if I were you,
I'd jump overboard while I still had time.

33
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:27,567
- Do you know anything about her?
- Uh-uh.

34
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,821
American gunboats in central China
are a painful local joke, Mr Holman.

35
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:36,200
- And the most painful is the <i>San Pablo.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

36
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:41,414
I think she's something you chaps inherited
from Spain after the Spanish-American War.

37
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,665
Well, I missed that one.

38
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:48,211
They don't let her on the Yangtze proper.
They keep her up in some small river.

39
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,089
You must know her.
She operates near Changsha.

40
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:55,969
- Yes. We know her.
- Mr Jameson dislikes gunboats.

41
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:59,139
Whatever flag they fly.
English, French, American...

42
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:02,142
Symbols of what
the great powers did to this nation.

43
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,102
Nation? Don't be ridiculous.

44
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:09,356
It's a patchwork quilt of bandits,
warlords, mobs, rape, loot and chaos.

45
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,234
China will be unable
to put her own house in order

46
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,404
until she is free of
your enslaving, unequal treaties.

47
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:20,493
Foreigners collecting her taxes, placed
in charge of her Customs, postal system...

48
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:25,623
Foreigners enjoying immunity from her laws.
Would we tolerate a Frenchman

49
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:29,210
who had committed a crime in America
not to be tried in our courts?

50
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:31,462
You know Chinese justice.

51
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:34,797
Confessions by torture, corruption...

52
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:40,470
Have you seen the executioner of the
warlords walk through the streets? "Oh, you."

53
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:43,932
"Ah. You!"

54
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,893
Well, do you think that's funny?

55
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:49,395
Well, you do it kinda funny.

56
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,899
Yes, those things happen.
But they're trying.

57
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:56,903
Responsible Chinese leaders
are trying to put their house in order.

58
00:09:56,986 --> 00:10:02,825
- From the south, the Nationalist Party...
- Mobs, that's all I see. Mobs that threaten us.

59
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:06,411
Confusing, isn't it? And painful.

60
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:13,043
I bequeath China and her agonies
to you youngsters, with pity,

61
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:17,089
and with the hope that perhaps
<i>you</i> can understand what's going on,

62
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:22,052
can comprehend what so many people
are going to have to die for.

63
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:25,763
The good, the bad... the innocent.

64
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:31,018
- Excuse me, sir, but you're talking rot.
- Conceivably.

65
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,688
A firm hand, that's what's needed.

66
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:36,315
That's what you're doing here.

67
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,026
Hey. Listen, I run the engine.

68
00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:42,697
All this other is just "looksee-pidgin".

69
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:48,703
- I beg your pardon?
- To make a show. Something for the officers.

70
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:51,621
I don't fool with it.

71
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:21,275
Oh, don't stop.

72
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:24,945
I can't do no more.
Just butterflies and rabbits.

73
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,411
Is this your first trip upriver?

74
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,580
Yeah.

75
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,836
Did you understand
what they were talking about last night?

76
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,255
- Politics.
- I'd like to know more.

77
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:49,886
I'm not a missionary, I'm a teacher. And
if I'm going to teach, I ought to know more.

78
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:52,764
You gonna try to teach the slopeheads?

79
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:56,267
Yeah.

80
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,771
I taught back home in high school.
Vermont.

81
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:05,902
- Where's your home?
- Well, I was born in Grover, Utah.

82
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:09,072
But my home's whatever ship I'm on.

83
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,242
You're an engineer, huh?

84
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:20,916
I'd have thought the engine on a large ship is
more interesting than the one on a gunboat.

85
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,418
Too many guys tryin'
to tell you how to run it.

86
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:24,670
Ah.

87
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:29,466
See, on a small ship
you haven't got any of that military crap.

88
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,138
They, uh... They leave you alone.

89
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,393
I had a brother in the navy during the war.

90
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,563
He was a lieutenant in the reserve.

91
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,731
Uh-huh?

92
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:51,654
- How long have you been in the navy?
- Nine years.

93
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,740
- And out here?
- Seven.

94
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:58,202
See, most China sailors, they don't go back.

95
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:03,874
They pull their 20, 30 years and shack up
with a Chinese girl, open up a bar.

96
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:06,168
I see.

97
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,799
I mean, I keep asking myself the same
question about what I'm doing here.

98
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:16,595
I'm kinda frightened.

99
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:20,140
It may be romantic,
but I wanted to be swept up by something.

100
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:24,728
One night, Mr Jameson showed coloured
slides in the basement of the church.

101
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:27,313
Slides of his mission, China Light.

102
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:31,275
- How long you sign up for?
- Seven years.

103
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:37,448
Well, those slopeheads
could use some teaching.

104
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:42,119
I hope you're good at it. Long as you're
good at something, they can't bust you down.

105
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:45,122
Like me, you know, with the engine.

106
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:56,382
The Reverend'll probably tell you that nice
American girls don't talk to China sailors.

107
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:01,179
It's not your brother's navy.

108
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,225
I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.

109
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,227
No.

110
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,731
Goodbye.

111
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,679
I can't help feeling
a sort of sadness about his life.

112
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:47,014
Yes, it would be sad -
if he wanted something else.

113
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:52,770
They don't. They reduce life
to a very simple point, or no point at all.

114
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:57,191
As long as they obey orders,
the navy takes care of them.

115
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,027
The way of life appeals
to a certain kind of man.

116
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:06,909
Go.

117
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,483
- Hello. I takee.
- I got it.

118
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,070
- I takee all gear sailor man.
- OK! Takee.

119
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,238
- OK.
- Takee!

120
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,292
- That guy sure likes to carry things.
- Ah, it's his rice bowl.

121
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,338
You must be Holman, huh?
We was wondering when you'd get here.

122
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:51,969
Well, Shanghai slowed me up a little bit.
Had a hell of a time tryin' to find you.

123
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:57,056
Oh, we only come down to civilisation
every couple of years for overhaul.

124
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:02,645
Welcome aboard the Sand Pebble.
That's what we call her. We're Sand Pebbles.

125
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:07,024
- Frenchy Burgoyne.
- Yeah. Hey, you got an engineerin' officer?

126
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,154
No, just the skipper and the exec.
You'll be the senior engineering rate.

127
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:13,489
- Yeah?
- Wong will show you your bunk.

128
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,992
I wanna look at the engine first.

129
00:18:57,506 --> 00:19:01,135
All thing proper. You makee looksee, master.

130
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:03,678
Any side proper. All OK.

131
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,370
Hello, engine.

132
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,538
I'm Jake Holman.

133
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,844
Coffee, sailor man?

134
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,648
Ah. Good boy, Wong.

135
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,570
Through with the butter?

136
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,791
Welcome aboard. My name's Bronson.

137
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,002
- Hiya.
- Hey, what's your name, buddy?

138
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,338
- Holman.
- Stawski. Machinist's mate.

139
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,424
- That's Farren. Bosun's mate, second class.
- Howdy.

140
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:31,054
- The redhead is Shanahan, ship's writer.
- Yeah, that's me. Red Dog.

141
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:34,891
- Red Dog "bite 'em in the butt" Shanahan.
- Red Dog, cut it out!

142
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:37,977
- Jennings, pharmacist's mate.
- Hey, Holman.

143
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:43,650
When you meet those pigs at the Red Candle
at Changsha, the doc's a man's best friend.

144
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,152
Right, Crosley?

145
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,949
Say, Holman, what was your last ship?

146
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,785
Flagship. Asiatic fleet.

147
00:20:54,868 --> 00:21:00,499
- Harris, electrician. Navy's foulest mouth.
- So don't get me started.

148
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:04,044
- What do you want for breakfast? Tell Wong.
- Eggs.

149
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:07,965
- Sure. How many?
- Half a dozen?

150
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:11,051
- You got 'em. Over easy, or what?
- Yeah, over easy.

151
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,928
- Ham?
- Yeah.

152
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,347
- OK, Wong?
- OK.

153
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,935
The old Sand Pebble ain't much to look at,
but she's sure as hell a home and a feeder.

154
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,855
- Yeah, she sure is, Frenchy.
- Tell him all about it.

155
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:27,108
Hey, Holman.
Clip-Clip here does all the shaving.

156
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:29,193
I like to do my own shavin'.

157
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:34,198
It's his rice bowl.

158
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:43,498
Don't wanna break nobody's rice bowl.

159
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:46,001
OK.

160
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:53,133
- Attaboy, Clip-Clip.
- Great breakfast this morning, huh?

161
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:07,813
Let's go! Come on.

162
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:10,149
Come on, come on, come on.

163
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:14,987
Move it, move it. Come on!
Fall in at attention. Let's go. Hup!

164
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,616
Come on, come on, come on,
come on! On the double!

165
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:21,118
Let's go! Fall in at attention.

166
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:23,704
Dress right!

167
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:26,624
Front! Answer to muster!

168
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:28,542
- Holman! Burgoyne!
- Banks!

169
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,628
- Perna! Shanahan!
- Ho!

170
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,128
- Colgate! Troys!
- Here!

171
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:33,922
- Crosley!
- MacDonald!

172
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:36,090
- Haythorn!
- Here!

173
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:43,389
- Report!
- Deck and gunnery divisions all present, sir.

174
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:47,477
Engineering and navigation
all present or accounted for, sir.

175
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,730
- Ship's company all accounted for, sir.
- Very well.

176
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:53,149
- Posts!
- The clock reads eight, Captain.

177
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,318
Make it so.

178
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,323
Ten hut!

179
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,301
- Dismiss the ship's company.
- Aye aye, sir.

180
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:25,138
All right, Chief, dismiss the men.

181
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:27,306
- Fall out and turn to.
- Fall out.

182
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,936
Holman. Welcome aboard. I'm Wellbeck,
your mustering Chief Petty Officer.

183
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,940
Did you look at the new man's records,
Mr Bordelles? What did you think?

184
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:39,193
Well, he seems to be a first-rate engineer, sir.

185
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:43,656
- You take a good look at his service record?
- Yes, sir. Nothing but 4.0 marks.

186
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:48,869
In everything except leadership.
And he's had seven transfers in nine years.

187
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:53,874
It's almost time for battle drill, sir.
What shall we run this morning?

188
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:56,501
- Repel boarders starboard.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,130
All hands, repel boarders starboard!

190
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:04,301
- Repel boarders!
- On the double, Holman.

191
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:08,138
You help man the hose in the waist party.
I'm Chief Franks.

192
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:25,988
OK, grab this.

193
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:36,999
Waist party manned and ready, sir.

194
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:40,085
Stand back, you slope-headed slobs!

195
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:44,339
Stand back, you slobs! Stand back!

196
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:47,091
Go! Go!

197
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,886
Stand by on that hose!

198
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:55,517
All right. Cut her in down there.

199
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,115
- Secure from drill!
- Secure from drill!

200
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,867
Secure from drill!

201
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:27,131
- You do this a lot?
- Every day except Sunday.

202
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:30,717
Well, what do you do Sundays?
Turn a machine gun on 'em?

203
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:33,886
Come on.

204
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,001
Master!

205
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:17,345
All of you. Go back to work. Go back to work.

206
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:19,681
Continue. Continue.

207
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:32,860
- You, uh...
- Po-han, master.

208
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:36,405
I wanna looksee the bilge side.
Take up the floor plate. Savvy?

209
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:39,158
- Me savvy.
- Bilge pidgin no can do.

210
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:42,244
Today must washee port side.

211
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:47,124
- Who the hell are you?
- Chien. Boss coolie. No can do bilge pidgin.

212
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:51,127
Yeah? I do bilge pidgin. Looksee pipes.

213
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,463
Learn pidgin all pipes. Savvy?

214
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:57,050
This ain't the Chinese Navy. Take it up.

215
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,382
Master! Master!

216
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:41,968
Hey, shut it off! Shut it off!

217
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,056
Hey! Hey!

218
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,559
Hey! What the hell is wrong?

219
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:54,397
- That boss coolie's gonna get his head bent.
- What?

220
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,942
- He blew the glass on me in the bilges.
- Oh, take it easy.

221
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:01,696
We always blow the glass
when the watch changes.

222
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:04,532
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.

223
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:07,409
He probably
didn't even know you was there.

224
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:12,080
He knew.

225
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:17,878
We don't never go in the bilges. And if
you want Chien's respect, stay out of 'em.

226
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:21,423
- I don't care if that slopehead respects me.
- Well, you better!

227
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:26,553
- We couldn't get along without him.
- Well, by God, <i>I can get along without him.

228
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:39,815
- Who works for who around here?
- Oh, it's a system they got.

229
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:44,820
If you want a bilge coolie, go through Chien.
For a deck coolie, go through Pappy Tung.

230
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:51,702
The boss of all the coolies is Lop-eye Shing.
He's kind of captain.

231
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:54,121
- Like Collins is with the crew.
- Yeah?

232
00:28:54,413 --> 00:29:00,502
- How the hell did they get this thing started?
- Oh, a long time ago, before I shipped on.

233
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,340
The sampans'd gang around the slop chutes,
and the Chinese'd fight for the garbage.

234
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:10,512
Well, that was no way, so finally the cook
gave one sampan the contract. Hey, come on.

235
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:13,389
Relax, huh?

236
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:17,685
Soon, they wasn't only collectin' it,
they was scrapin' and washin' dishes.

237
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:21,648
In a week, every mess cook had
a Chinese helper to do all the work.

238
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:24,983
Next thing, they were sleeping
in the galley passageways.

239
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:28,737
Then they was with the ship for good,
in all the departments.

240
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:32,491
- Course, it ain't official.
- Hey, how do they get paid?

241
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:37,788
Oh, squeeze. Little here, little there.
Uncle Sam don't miss it. You got a minute?

242
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:40,457
- Yeah.
- Come on. I'll show you.

243
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:43,293
They live in the old crew's quarters.

244
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:53,803
We never come in here.
The Captain don't even inspect it.

245
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,852
Oh, come on.
He's lost enough face for one day.

246
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:09,944
If you wanna hit one of them, kick him.
Never touch him with your hand.

247
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:12,613
Don't get buddies with a coolie.
That's trouble.

248
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,574
- And they do all the work?
- Sure.

249
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:18,660
That leaves us free for standing
topside watches and our primary duty.

250
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:21,246
Black gangs ain't supposed
to stand topside watches.

251
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:26,209
- On this ship, everybody.
- What <i>is</i> our primary duty?

252
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:29,171
- Fightin'.
- Who do we fight?

253
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:34,050
Nobody. Probably never will. But, like
the skipper said, we're always ready.

254
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:37,637
Look, Jake, we got it good here, huh?

255
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:42,184
I didn't come all the way from the fleet
to have it good. I'm an engineer.

256
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:47,980
Look, I told you. Let Chien handle the engine.
He'll keep it in shape. He knows it inside out.

257
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,357
Relax, huh?

258
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,617
Today we begin cruising to show the flag on
Tungting Lake and the Hunan Rivers.

259
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,119
I want all honours rendered smartly.

260
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:05,873
At home in America, when today
reaches them, it'll be Flag Day.

261
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:09,084
For us who wear the uniform,
every day is Flag Day.

262
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,215
It is said there will be no more wars.
We must pretend to believe that.

263
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:21,387
But when war comes, it is we who will take
the first shock, and buy time with our lives.

264
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:25,183
It is we who keep the faith.

265
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,769
We serve the flag.

266
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,815
The trade we all follow
is the give-and-take of death.

267
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,485
It is for that purpose that
the people of America maintain us.

268
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:41,490
Any one of us who believes he has ajob like
any other, for which he draws a money wage,

269
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:43,784
is a thief of the food he eats,

270
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:47,955
and a trespasser in the bunk
in which he lies down to sleep.

271
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,794
Mr Bordelles, make preparations
for getting underway.

272
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:41,147
- When was the last time it was overhauled?
- About a month ago.

273
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,158
Captain?

274
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:58,080
- Yes, Holman?
- Got a burnt bearing, sir.

275
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:02,084
It could tear up the crankshaft.
I'd like to shut down and repair it.

276
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,587
Holman, as long as we move
and smoke boils out of our stack,

277
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:09,425
we'll make the impression
I want to make on the Chinese.

278
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:12,468
Yes, sir. It's still gonna give us trouble, sir.

279
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,222
It never has.

280
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,391
Yes, sir.

281
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,780
Here's a message, sir.

282
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,618
- Full speed ahead.
- Full speed ahead.

283
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,412
Full speed ahead.

284
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,881
Tell the Captain she won't take no more turns.

285
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,887
Oil the cups! Oil the cups! Oil the cups!

286
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,516
Oil the cup. Oil. More oil.

287
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:07,021
- Holman, why aren't we up to full speed?
- She won't take no more turns, sir.

288
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:10,149
We're under orders
to reach Changsha on the double.

289
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:12,651
She ain't gonna make it.

290
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,820
We've never had to stop before.

291
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,907
Well, I'm just telling you.

292
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,336
That's right.

293
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,848
Tell the Captain we must stop and secure.

294
00:35:54,775 --> 00:36:00,239
As soon as we get the LP at the top,
we'll lock in the jacking gear. That'll hold it.

295
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:24,846
- A lot of slack in that damn thing, Jake.
- There sure as hell is.

296
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,455
OK. Lock it in.

297
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:53,623
Two men. You and you.

298
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,092
Jacking gear in.

299
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,761
Into the pit. I order you.

300
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:08,555
- I won't go.
- You are boss. You do it.

301
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,891
- You want to be fired?
- Do it yourself.

302
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,310
Gimme the wrench.

303
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:17,521
My takee wrench. My takee wrench.

304
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:21,650
OK, Chien.

305
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,372
Hammer.

306
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:05,484
- Watch it!
- The damn jacking gear gave way!

307
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:10,489
- Get Jennings down here!
- Aye aye, sir!

308
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:24,670
Floor plate down. If you try and pull him out
through there you'll tear him to pieces.

309
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:35,138
Frenchy...

310
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,560
- The drain valves open?
- Yeah.

311
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:45,314
And Frenchy?
Don't let no steam build up, huh?

312
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:02,581
All right. Come on. Out, out.

313
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:04,750
Come on.

314
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,425
Easy, easy.

315
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:21,223
Hey, Jennings, grab his hands.
Easy. Easy now.

316
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,487
OK.

317
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,190
- Slow engine.
- Slow engine.

318
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,701
Stand by all lines.

319
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,745
Get cleaned up.
The Captain's waiting for you.

320
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:27,054
A man has been killed on this ship
for the first time. I want to know why.

321
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:31,307
- A key in the jacking gearjarred out, sir.
- Why?

322
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,143
- Vibration.
- And why the vibration?

323
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:38,856
Because of the bearing knock, sir. I guess
one key has been missin' for a long time.

324
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:41,776
And the other one's just being held in by rust.

325
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:45,029
Can you fix any personal
responsibility for this?

326
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:48,699
- For the jacking gear, sir?
- For the accident, Holman.

327
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:52,745
Without the knock in the LP,
there'd be no vibration.

328
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:57,248
Chien handled the overhaul.
He should have fixed it, sir.

329
00:41:57,332 --> 00:41:59,918
Are you saying that Chien killed himself?

330
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,672
I'll remind you he worked under supervision.

331
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:08,676
Can't supervise an overhaul and stand
deck watches at the same time, sir.

332
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,640
Black gang should stand
their watches in the engine room, sir.

333
00:42:13,723 --> 00:42:16,518
Lop-eye Shing says that you killed Chien.

334
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,978
You threw the engine
in some mysterious way.

335
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:23,857
Now, that may be superstition,
Holman, but it's very real to them.

336
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,610
Your resentment of Chien was well known.

337
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:31,573
The system you got on this ship
is what killed him, sir.

338
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:38,914
You will immediately train a new coolie
to take Chien's place. Give it your full time.

339
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:42,543
- They ain't got the brains.
- They operate efficiently enough.

340
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,463
It's monkey see, monkey do. They don't
know what happens with the engine.

341
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:51,175
- It's not necessary they should.
- Let me run the engine room like I should.

342
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:54,387
- I can give you 12 knots, no breakdowns...
- Holman.

343
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,141
I'm the one here who decides
what jobs'll be done by whom.

344
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,105
The crew of this ship is designed
just like the machinery that powers the ship.

345
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:10,153
Captains before me designed the <i>San Pablo</i>
for a special job in the backwaters of China.

346
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:13,072
But men will not hold together
like brass and steel.

347
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:16,032
We have to refit ourselves
into the design every day.

348
00:43:16,116 --> 00:43:19,286
That's the purpose of all we do in <i>San Pablo.</i>

349
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:25,167
As part of that design, you cannot do what
you prefer to do, however well you do it.

350
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:30,213
You will train a new coolie
and then return to your military duties.

351
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:33,592
That's all, Holman.

352
00:43:57,364 --> 00:44:02,411
- Hey, come on. Over here.
- Hey, Red Dog! Bring our whiskey back!

353
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:05,538
- You no wantee whiskey?
- Oh, no, honey.

354
00:44:05,622 --> 00:44:08,124
Not on an empty stomach, I'll tell you.

355
00:44:10,293 --> 00:44:12,379
Hey, Jake.

356
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:14,547
Jake!

357
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,223
- How'd you make out with the Captain?
- One piece whiskey.

358
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:26,684
- We ain't waltzin' no more.
- What happened?

359
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:31,064
Collins says that us Sand Pebbles
is like machinery, only different.

360
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,398
Huh?

361
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:37,403
We gotta keep changing, cos we ain't
made out of brass. Think that one over.

362
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:41,240
Didn't he say nothing about Chien?

363
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:44,827
Yeah. I gotta train a new coolie.

364
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:48,747
- What?
- Yeah, one of them slopeheads.

365
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:52,418
I can't do it, Frenchy.
They think that engine's got ghosts in it.

366
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,753
- Sailor man?
- I'm broke.

367
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:58,923
Hey! Mama Chunk.

368
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:04,137
- Where's the new stuff?
- You all the time same Sand Pebble sailor.

369
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,473
What's the matter? No likee all the same girl?

370
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:09,809
What's the matter with her?

371
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:12,353
Hey! Frenchy!

372
00:45:12,437 --> 00:45:17,316
- Hi, Mama.
- What's the matter, no takee girl topside?

373
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,905
- Ah, give me time.
- Oh, I think you too old a man.

374
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:25,490
Too old, huh? Too old, huh?

375
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:33,790
Wait. You new sailor! What you name?

376
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:37,335
- Holman.
- Homang. Homang.

377
00:45:37,419 --> 00:45:42,340
- Yeah. Homang.
- Oh. Have got one piece new girl topside.

378
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:48,722
Brand new. She just now makee pretty.
I suppose bye-bye she come see you?

379
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:50,890
- Well, I...
- Send her over, Mama.

380
00:45:50,973 --> 00:45:53,476
- Oh, oh, nice Frenchy.
- Hey, Ski!

381
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,562
Your eyes are bigger than your...

382
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:33,098
Hey. Oh, OK.

383
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:39,479
Right over here, lovey duck. Best table
in the house. Right here. Sit over here.

384
00:46:39,562 --> 00:46:42,106
Clear out, you slobs. Back to your pigs.

385
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:45,567
My name is Ski.

386
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:48,153
Ski. Savvy?

387
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:50,656
What name you?

388
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,825
My name is Maily.

389
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,953
Say that again.

390
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:59,123
- My name is Maily.
- Did you hear that? A Vassar girl.

391
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:02,668
- Well, hello, Maily.
- Ski, I am your buddy.

392
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:05,504
- Shove off, Restorff.
- Hey, Ski. Pal? Come on.

393
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:08,297
I'm sure you have
your own joy junks to go to.

394
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:12,051
Come on, why don't you vamoose?
Come on, you guys, beat it.

395
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:17,432
Maily, what'll you have to drink?

396
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:21,394
I should warn you,
I get a commission on what I drink.

397
00:47:21,477 --> 00:47:25,565
All I drink is cold tea,
but you'll have to pay for whiskey.

398
00:47:25,648 --> 00:47:29,402
Oh. I see. Yeah, sure.

399
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:32,029
Boy! Catch two piece whiskey.

400
00:47:35,991 --> 00:47:38,618
Relax. Relax, Maily.

401
00:47:38,702 --> 00:47:41,121
- I keep books for Mr Shu.
- Oh.

402
00:47:41,913 --> 00:47:46,293
And act as hostess.
I'm very pleased to meet all of you.

403
00:47:47,085 --> 00:47:49,463
Yeah.

404
00:47:49,546 --> 00:47:52,716
Where'd you learn to talk English like that?

405
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:54,676
My secret.

406
00:47:55,635 --> 00:47:57,721
Uh-huh.

407
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,433
- Where do you come from?
- New Jersey.

408
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:06,812
- Oh, yes. Trenton.
- Yeah, Trenton's in New Jersey.

409
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:12,651
- Where Washington crossed the Delaware.
- Yeah. That was a little before my time.

410
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:19,116
As hostess, I'm supposed
to divide my time among all the tables.

411
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:22,411
It's been pleasant meeting all of you,
but I must go now.

412
00:48:22,495 --> 00:48:26,915
Oh, no, no. Not till we take
a little trip across the Delaware.

413
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:30,919
I don't go upstairs. I'm only a hostess.

414
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:34,839
- Ski, she don't love you.
- Hey, Ski, go and get some air.

415
00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:40,970
Mr Ski, please. Please don't!

416
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:43,598
- Ski, let her alone!
- You go to hell.

417
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:45,392
Please.

418
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:49,854
Hold it, Frenchy. In case you didn't know,
this girl's got duties, just like sailors.

419
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:52,439
- Oh, please.
- Oh, let her go.

420
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:56,193
Now, Frenchy, stand fast! That's an order.

421
00:48:56,276 --> 00:49:00,823
You know better than to mess around with
another man's girl till he's through with her.

422
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:04,326
What's the matter? Wait. What's the matter?

423
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,287
You want to go topside her? Pay money.

424
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:10,666
- Money!
- Money, money. OK.

425
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,918
- Come on. Topside.
- Wait.

426
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:16,838
This girl first time.
Must pay 200 dollar.

427
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:21,050
$200?

428
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:29,058
- I'll give you ten dollars Mexican. Come on.
- 200 dollar!

429
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:32,437
- You think I'm an admiral?
- That be first-time price.

430
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,605
- Who say so?
- Victor Shu.

431
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:42,654
- $200.
- Nobody's ever gonna have that much.

432
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:47,034
- $200.
- I'll be damned.

433
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:50,328
- I'm still drinkin' with her.
- No. She go other table now.

434
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:53,248
You can't change
the house rules just like that.

435
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:58,295
- As long as I pay for her drinks, I keep her.
- What's the matter? You crazy?

436
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,506
Come on, on the side.

437
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,010
Come on. Come on. All right, break it up.

438
00:50:05,093 --> 00:50:07,637
All right, break it up. Go back to your pigs.

439
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:13,684
Wait. Wait. You like talk to pretty girl?

440
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:17,688
Yeah, sure, Mama.

441
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:24,195
- Why don't you grab a table?
- Yeah.

442
00:50:24,278 --> 00:50:26,530
Come on. Let's sit down.

443
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:43,004
- What's your name?
- Frenchy.

444
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:45,173
- And yours?
- Jake Holman.

445
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:48,927
- Mine is Maily.
- How do you do?

446
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,096
Ooh!

447
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:57,977
- Thank you very much for helping me.
- Oh, it was nothing.

448
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:03,649
- Where are you from, Mr Holman?
- Utah.

449
00:51:04,149 --> 00:51:07,277
- Oh, Salt Lake City.
- Uh-huh.

450
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:11,657
- I'm from Philadelphia.
- Yes, Liberty Bell.

451
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,993
- Uh-huh.
- Is Utah nice?

452
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:18,163
Oh, for some people.

453
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:25,295
Well, I guess I'd better get back to ship.

454
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:27,797
- Huh?
- Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

455
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,720
- So long.
- There's a guy who knows when to leave.

456
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:40,393
Where'd you learn
to speak English this good, Maily?

457
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,562
My secret.

458
00:51:43,104 --> 00:51:44,689
Oh.

459
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,362
Why $200?
Is there something special about $200?

460
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,825
Yeah, I know. Your secret, huh?

461
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:03,999
Well, what happens when Shu gets his $200?

462
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,753
I go to Hankow, to Shanghai.

463
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,757
I am free!

464
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,217
I wish I had $200.

465
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,846
Oh, I mean... I mean, just to give you.

466
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:24,060
You would do that?

467
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:27,438
Yeah, sure.

468
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:32,026
Look... I'll get it.

469
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:35,196
Time's up. Next table.
You gotta work fast here, boy.

470
00:52:35,279 --> 00:52:39,450
My name's Farren. I don't come from nowhere
and I don't wanna talk geography.

471
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:44,037
- Anybody wanna shoot a little crap?
- You won't get 200 bucks from me, lover boy.

472
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,206
Next week, Frenchy. Next week.

473
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,092
Hey. Come here.

Him all die.

00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:20,656
Yeah, him all die. And that's too bad.

No, no, the engine's OK.

483
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,675
Now, the valve.

489
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,487
- Wowel.
- Yeah?

490
00:54:03,947 --> 00:54:06,033
OK. Wowel.

491
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:09,494
Now, main steam stop valve.

492
00:54:09,578 --> 00:54:13,331
May stim stop wowel.

493
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:17,753
Where?

494
00:54:26,553 --> 00:54:28,763
You find.

495
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:52,370
No, no.

496
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:55,080
No, not proper wowel.

497
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:01,544
May stim stop wowel.

498
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:11,012
- May stim stop wowel?
- Yeah.

499
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:15,266
- May stim stop wowel?
- Main steam stop valve.

500
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:20,354
But I don't know.

501
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:23,857
You, me, can do.

502
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:27,403
Jake.

503
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:34,868
OK.

504
00:55:34,952 --> 00:55:40,708
OK. If you go that way,
then we're going reverse. OK?

505
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:49,340
Huh?

506
00:55:49,632 --> 00:55:52,260
The generator. Makes juice for the lights.

507
00:56:01,477 --> 00:56:03,438
See?

508
00:56:08,568 --> 00:56:09,610
OK.

509
00:56:10,402 --> 00:56:15,365
This is the boiler.
Inside belongs live steam. Savvy?

510
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:19,953
Strong steam.

511
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,750
- Stim.
- Steam.

512
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,712
Stim.

513
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,716
Live stim goes through this pipe.

514
00:56:34,051 --> 00:56:36,594
Live stim goes into the feed pump.

515
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:44,643
Live stim! Make pump go vroom,
vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom...

516
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:48,314
Live stim, huh?

517
00:56:48,397 --> 00:56:52,276
Live stim... Live stim... Live stim.

518
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:57,990
Exhaust stim.

519
00:56:58,074 --> 00:57:00,576
Condenser. Makee steam all dead.

520
00:57:04,204 --> 00:57:06,289
You know, sleepy stim.

521
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:25,308
Live stim, dead stim.

522
00:57:27,394 --> 00:57:29,561
Before, live stim.

523
00:57:29,645 --> 00:57:33,440
Now water. Water belong dead stim.

524
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:35,609
All same dead stim.

525
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,033
Stim dead. Stim dead!

526
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:45,327
That's right. That's it.

527
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:49,832
Now you got it! That's right!
That's the way it works!

528
00:57:54,919 --> 00:57:57,005
And that's the throttle.

529
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:05,805
I'll teach you about that throttle one day.

530
00:58:13,104 --> 00:58:15,189
Go ahead. Grab ahold of it.

531
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:20,777
Boo!

532
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:23,613
Nah. There ain't no ghosts in that engine.

533
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,955
Hey!

534
00:58:34,374 --> 00:58:37,711
- Who's your new throttle man, Homang?
- Out.

535
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:43,592
Ask the new throttle man if you can have
some coffee. Maybe he'll let you use his cup.

536
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:50,139
Yeah. Why, you slant-eyed bastard...

537
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:03,110
Holman, you'd better watch out.

538
00:59:06,447 --> 00:59:10,993
Lettin' that slopehead drink coffee
down here, touch the throttle...

539
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,495
You watch out, Holman.

540
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:16,373
Slopehead!

541
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:20,669
Pick up your coffee cup.

542
00:59:40,145 --> 00:59:43,899
Looks like you ain't
runnin' this ship after all, Lop-eye.

543
00:59:46,735 --> 00:59:49,863
Sir, is it wise
overruling Lop-eye about the coolie?

544
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:53,409
That's not what I've done.
The crew wants Po-han off the ship.

545
00:59:53,492 --> 00:59:56,954
They believe Stawski about
what happened in the engine room.

546
00:59:57,037 --> 01:00:00,749
- You believe Holman, sir?
- Not necessarily, but he makes more sense.

547
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:05,753
But Lop-eye fired Po-han. He'll lose face
if Holman makes the crew change their mind.

548
01:00:05,837 --> 01:00:08,381
Unlikely as that is, it might serve a purpose.

549
01:00:08,464 --> 01:00:12,343
Lop-eye has a tendency
to forget his place from time to time.

550
01:00:29,985 --> 01:00:33,488
That's right. That's what happened, Holman.

551
01:00:33,572 --> 01:00:38,201
The slopehead hit me and you jumped
me before I had a chance to kill him.

552
01:00:38,618 --> 01:00:41,288
- Right, Perna?
- Just like that.

553
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:47,294
You're lucky I busted it up when I did.
If he'd have hit ya, he woulda killed ya.

554
01:00:48,462 --> 01:00:50,547
The slopehead woulda killed me?

555
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:55,676
You never... You ever see a slopehead fight?

556
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,928
- You guys saw a slopehead fight.
- Yeah.

557
01:00:58,012 --> 01:01:01,349
Holman, you're crazy.
He woulda killed the Chink.

558
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:05,019
- He woulda put out your lights.
- Who says so?

559
01:01:05,102 --> 01:01:08,105
- I got 50 bucks that says so.
- I'll take it.

560
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:10,816
- You got any more?
- I'll take some of that.

561
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,446
Now, wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.
Hold it! Hold it! Just one minute! Hold it!

562
01:01:15,529 --> 01:01:19,575
Who's gonna do the fightin' here? Now,
I don't go for it unless you bet me $100.

563
01:01:19,658 --> 01:01:22,660
- You holdin' $100?
- Yeah, I'm holdin' $100.

564
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:26,956
And I need $200
to buy myself a very special present.

565
01:01:30,669 --> 01:01:33,213
$100 says he'll take you.

566
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:38,301
Oh, Maily! Maily, here I come!

567
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,597
Hey, hold it.

568
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:47,643
Beside the money, if Po-han wins,
he stays aboard. That's my deal.

569
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,733
- Sure.
- Well, he's not gonna win anyway.

570
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:57,277
- Bets right here.
- You said $50, huh?

571
01:01:57,361 --> 01:01:59,446
Hey. You got any more, Homang?

572
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,573
- Yeah, I got an extra $50.
- Holman?

573
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:05,744
- I'll bet you $10 the slopehead don't fight.
- He'll fight.

574
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:09,123
Put me down for $10.

575
01:02:12,543 --> 01:02:14,877
Hey, Chief. When are we gonna start?

576
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:33,896
- Frenchy, you mustn't worry.
- How the hell can you say...

577
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:39,109
- Excuse me.
- If Ski gets me, then he's supposed to.

578
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:43,822
- That big ape.
- It will only mean that I'm being punished.

579
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:46,742
- For what?
- My secret.

580
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,911
Now look. You quit that "my secret" stuff.

581
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:54,374
- Who'd wanna punish you?
- God.

582
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:57,002
- Who?
- God!

583
01:02:58,003 --> 01:03:00,297
What'd you do to him?

584
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,049
I...

585
01:03:02,132 --> 01:03:06,552
I stole some money
from American missionaries.

586
01:03:06,635 --> 01:03:09,305
They found me as a baby and brought me up.

587
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:14,810
Why did you steal it?

588
01:03:14,894 --> 01:03:18,981
To get away.
They wanted me to be a missionary too.

589
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:28,032
I meant to go to Shanghai and earn
enough money to send it back to them.

590
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:34,746
But I couldn't get there. So I came to
Changsha instead and Mr Shu advanced it.

591
01:03:35,747 --> 01:03:40,418
And now he must be paid. And so must God.

592
01:03:41,169 --> 01:03:45,173
You're bughouse, Maily.
What kind of religion do they teach you?

593
01:03:54,974 --> 01:03:58,268
- Don't you worry about it.
- The Chinaman can't fight.

594
01:03:58,352 --> 01:04:00,437
Get me some beer.

595
01:04:01,355 --> 01:04:04,525
Yeah, he's big. But he's blubber.

596
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:07,277
How can you fight and drink beer?

597
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:09,446
Ah!

598
01:04:11,323 --> 01:04:15,703
Po-han. Get him in the throat,
in the kidneys, in the gut. Hurt him.

599
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:21,542
Too much cold this side. Suppose
cold this side, any man no can fight.

600
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:26,004
Oh, you plenty time fight Chinese man.
How you no fashion fight Stawski?

601
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:29,007
- Ski no same.
- Come on, boy!

602
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,301
Listen to me. He's gonna try to hurt you.

603
01:04:32,385 --> 01:04:36,639
Forget what colour he is.
You want you come back ship, you fight.

604
01:04:37,223 --> 01:04:39,308
Fight!

605
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,313
- Give me a bell.
- Let's get out here.

606
01:04:45,773 --> 01:04:47,859
- Come on out here.
- Let's go.

607
01:04:47,942 --> 01:04:51,194
- How you doin'?
- Come on! Come on, get out here.

608
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:54,614
- Ski, you look great.
- Come on, come on, come on.

609
01:04:55,365 --> 01:04:59,703
Now look. No kickee, no scratchee.
None of that stuff, you savvy?

610
01:04:59,786 --> 01:05:01,580
- Me savvy.
- Me no savvy.

611
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:03,373
You!

612
01:05:04,082 --> 01:05:06,335
Go on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

613
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:08,503
Give me a bell.

614
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:12,799
OK. Let's go.

615
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:22,850
Get him, get him. Come on!

616
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:25,436
Boo!

617
01:05:26,812 --> 01:05:30,066
Come on. Hit me. Come on, come on. Hit me.

618
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,570
What's the matter?
Your man all same not fight? Huh?

619
01:05:34,654 --> 01:05:38,532
Give you even money Ski don't
knock him out in the first round.

620
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:41,618
Drop anchor, will you?

621
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:45,830
- Hit him!
- Fight!

622
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:50,168
What do I do now, Ma?

623
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:55,298
Come on. Fight. Fight!

624
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:58,760
Fight! Fight! Fight!

625
01:05:58,843 --> 01:06:01,388
Fight! Fight! Fight!

626
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:04,474
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Hit him.

627
01:06:09,978 --> 01:06:12,398
All right. Break, break.

628
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:19,279
- Hi, Haythorn, how are ya?
- Hit him! Hit him.

629
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:27,079
- Get up, Ski. Get up!
- Get up there.

630
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:30,416
Get up, Ski!

631
01:06:34,585 --> 01:06:36,671
Hit him!

632
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,095
- One...
- He's bleeding. The guy is bleeding, Ski.

633
01:06:44,178 --> 01:06:45,972
Finish him off.

634
01:06:46,055 --> 01:06:48,558
- One. Two.
- You got him, Ski.

635
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:51,144
- Three.
- He wants his mother, Ski.

636
01:06:51,227 --> 01:06:53,604
- Four. Five.
- He wants his mommy.

637
01:07:02,779 --> 01:07:06,742
- Nice going!
- You've got him goin', boy.

638
01:07:06,825 --> 01:07:08,910
Thanks for the fifty, Homang!

639
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:13,832
Now listen. He's getting tired.

640
01:07:13,915 --> 01:07:16,001
You thinkee he tired hit me?

641
01:07:17,127 --> 01:07:19,963
I'm tellin' you, he's runnin' out of steam.

642
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:23,091
Now, hit him, Po-han. Hit him in the guts.

643
01:07:24,258 --> 01:07:26,344
Hit him. Hit him!

644
01:07:30,765 --> 01:07:34,560
Pack your bags
for that trip across the Delaware, baby!

645
01:07:43,819 --> 01:07:45,571
Hit him.

646
01:07:46,155 --> 01:07:48,240
Hammer! Hammer!

647
01:07:54,746 --> 01:07:56,373
Get him, Ski!

648
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:11,680
Hit him! Hit him!

649
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,475
Come on, Ski, belt him!

650
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,899
Open his face!

651
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:27,236
Tear his head off!

652
01:08:29,446 --> 01:08:32,199
Come on, Ski, get him!

653
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:40,290
Hammer!

654
01:08:43,793 --> 01:08:45,503
Hammer!

655
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:00,643
This is what happens when you train on beer.

656
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:09,818
Finish him this time. You'll need
your strength for the main event.

657
01:09:09,901 --> 01:09:12,279
Oh, yeah! Whee!

658
01:09:14,197 --> 01:09:17,951
Hammer! He's ready to go down.
Hammer! Hammer!

659
01:09:18,327 --> 01:09:20,412
Yeah, hammer, hammer.

660
01:09:21,663 --> 01:09:24,249
Hit him in the gut. In the gut!

661
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,435
Kiss your money goodbye, Holman.

662
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,732
- Jake, if we lose fight, you lose money?
- Three. Four.

663
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:54,695
- Five. Six. Seven.
- Yeah. I lose money. But you lose ship.

664
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:56,906
Eight.

665
01:09:57,907 --> 01:10:00,200
Come on. Fight.

666
01:10:04,537 --> 01:10:06,331
One. Two.

667
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:09,250
Three. Four.

668
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:15,423
One. Two.

669
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:17,676
Three. Four.

670
01:10:22,263 --> 01:10:24,516
Put him down. Put him down!

671
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:26,892
- Get him, Ski. Get him!
- Hammer!

672
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:30,354
Hit the bum!

673
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,651
Hammer! Hammer!

674
01:10:36,694 --> 01:10:39,738
- Ski!
- One. Two.

675
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:43,575
- Three.
- Four!

676
01:10:44,702 --> 01:10:47,037
- Get up, you slob.
- Get up, Ski.

677
01:11:04,053 --> 01:11:07,598
One. Two. Three.

678
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,810
Four. Five.

679
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:18,066
Emergency recall!
Everybody back to the ship on the double.

680
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:21,361
Finish the count! Six!

681
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:24,740
- Let him alone.
- Eight!

682
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:28,201
- Nine! Ten!
- Yahoo!

683
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:32,414
Maily! I told you he'd do it!
I told you! What'd I tell you?

684
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,462
Me go back to ship?

685
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,630
You're damned right you do!

686
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:03,277
- Come on! Let's go!
- What the hell's goin' on up there, Waldron?

687
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,322
- Who's blowin' that whistle?
- On the double!

688
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:14,287
On the double! On the double, there!

689
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,456
- Keep moving.
- Let's go!

690
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:19,626
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

691
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:23,588
- Come on, Chief, get 'em aboard. Look alive!
- Come on! Come on!

692
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:33,848
Get steam up. Stand by to cast off lines and
drift if we don't get steam up fast enough.

693
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,392
We'll anchor in the channel.
Sober the men up.

694
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:41,397
- We may have to repel boarders.
- Aye aye. Chief, prepare to get underway.

695
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,275
Now hear this.
Make all preparations for getting underway.

696
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,904
Holman!
Get steam up to the engine on the double.

697
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:52,116
- Come on, Red Dog.
- Just a moment.

698
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:53,659
Up on the bridge. Come on.

699
01:12:55,494 --> 01:12:58,998
- Steam coming up on number two.
- I'll get the steam pump.

700
01:12:59,873 --> 01:13:02,333
Where are you goin'? You're boss now.

701
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:24,063
- Look sharp on those lines!
- All hands are on board, Captain.

702
01:13:24,147 --> 01:13:26,523
Very well.

703
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:34,698
- Cast off all lines!
- Cast off all lines!

704
01:13:34,781 --> 01:13:37,242
Get 'em in. Come on.

705
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:39,536
Take in gangway, on the double.

706
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:32,671
Last night,
at Wanxian up the gorges of the Yangtze,

707
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:35,715
two British warships
fought with the local warlord.

708
01:14:35,799 --> 01:14:38,718
200 Chinese were killed, and 150 British.

709
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:44,264
The Bolsheviks are now saying that
2,000 innocent Chinese were slaughtered.

710
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:48,727
- We're up against a new strategy of lies.
- I see, sir.

711
01:14:48,978 --> 01:14:54,108
The students of China support a new leader,
Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist Party.

712
01:14:54,191 --> 01:14:56,902
He's leading an army north
to wipe out the warlords.

713
01:14:56,986 --> 01:15:00,572
- What are we to do, sir?
- We have new orders, Mr Bordelles.

714
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:02,741
- Not to fire back.
- Sir?

715
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,872
- Not to fire back.
- I don't understand, sir.

716
01:15:10,123 --> 01:15:14,877
Apparently, we're being blamed
for everything. "The foreign devils".

717
01:15:14,961 --> 01:15:19,966
Oh, it's an old trick, to unify people by
getting them to hate something or someone.

718
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:23,469
Well, we're it.
They all want to get rid of us.

719
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:28,141
Chiang Kai-shek peacefully,
the Communists in the movement by force.

720
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:31,019
And we're supposed to grin and bear it.

721
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:35,772
Because if we fire back, we give them
new propaganda to use against us,

722
01:15:35,856 --> 01:15:39,484
and play into the hands of Communists,
who want us to start a real war

723
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:44,573
so that Russia can come to China's
rescue and in that way take her over.

724
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:51,496
It is an accident of history that we in the
<i>San Pablo</i> are the first American armed unit

725
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,583
to come face to face with this new thing.

726
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:58,378
How we face it can be
our great honour, or our dishonour.

727
01:15:59,671 --> 01:16:02,089
I intend that it shall be our honour.

728
01:16:03,257 --> 01:16:05,551
Our government has decided for now

729
01:16:05,635 --> 01:16:09,305
not to treat fighting between
Chiang Kai-shek and the other warlords

730
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:12,141
as just another warlord squabble.

731
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:18,481
We will treat it as an authentic civil war, in
which we must remain very carefully neutral.

732
01:16:18,564 --> 01:16:22,777
The United States Government
has ordered the evacuation of central China.

733
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:29,115
We shall be making one last trip to Baoshan
to rescue the missionaries at China Light.

734
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:32,118
Make all preparations for getting underway.

735
01:16:49,469 --> 01:16:51,972
- Stop engine.
- Stop engine.

736
01:16:57,017 --> 01:17:01,397
Those are the China Light people,
but I don't see Jameson. Where is Jameson?

737
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,607
He wouldn't come.

738
01:17:04,942 --> 01:17:07,361
- Go to China Light and get him.
- Aye aye, sir.

739
01:17:07,444 --> 01:17:10,406
Shove off at once. Damned nonsense.

740
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:09,338
Left, left, left, right.
Left, left and right turn.

741
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:17,595
Left, right, left, right,
left, left, left, right and left turn.

742
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:30,232
Left, left, left, right,
left, left, left, right, left, left and halt.

743
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:33,319
Left face.

744
01:18:36,905 --> 01:18:38,990
Mr Jameson is in my custody.

745
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,666
- Yes?
- Mr Jameson, please.

746
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:49,834
Come in. He's down the hall.

747
01:18:54,589 --> 01:18:57,050
Hi.

748
01:18:59,344 --> 01:19:03,847
She's a schoolteacher. I met her on
a steamer comin' up from Shanghai.

749
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:07,351
- Yeah?
- She's a lady.

750
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,816
They'd do great on the <i>San Pablo,</i> huh?

751
01:19:13,899 --> 01:19:17,361
Collins'd have 'em standin' like that all day.

752
01:19:21,115 --> 01:19:23,200
- Hello.
- Hi. Thanks.

753
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,121
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm Shirley Eckert.

754
01:19:27,204 --> 01:19:30,331
- Oh. Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

755
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:34,294
Those kids stand like that
much longer, they're gonna melt.

756
01:19:58,692 --> 01:20:01,903
What's all the machinery you got over there?

757
01:20:01,987 --> 01:20:06,825
A lot of things we don't understand.
I thought about you the minute I saw it.

758
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,496
- How do you like your gunboat?
- It's OK.

759
01:20:14,124 --> 01:20:17,544
- Do you like your teaching here?
- Oh, yes. Very much.

760
01:20:20,172 --> 01:20:23,924
That's to make beet sugar,
and this is for electric light.

761
01:20:25,718 --> 01:20:28,054
Hey, you oughta be runnin' 'em.

762
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:30,556
- Cho-jen!
- How come you ain't runnin' 'em?

763
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,269
We don't know how. Some wealthy man
from Philadelphia sent them out.

764
01:20:35,353 --> 01:20:37,438
Cho-jen.

765
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:41,400
Cho-jen's the leader
of the students in this district.

766
01:20:41,484 --> 01:20:44,153
I want you to meet him. He's very bright.

767
01:20:44,236 --> 01:20:47,197
Cho-jen, this is Mr Holman. He's an engineer.

768
01:20:50,116 --> 01:20:52,202
- Hiya.
- Hello.

769
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:58,750
Where's your direction manuals?
Machinery like this usually has 'em.

770
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:01,461
Oh, well, I think Mr Jameson has them.

771
01:21:01,544 --> 01:21:04,798
Attention! Attention! Face front!

772
01:21:04,881 --> 01:21:07,050
That Cho-jen, he a Bolshevik?

773
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:10,345
Oh, no. Chiang Kai-shek is his god.

774
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:12,513
For all of them he's the hope.

775
01:21:12,596 --> 01:21:14,890
How come he tied a can to the Reverend?

776
01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:20,437
Mr Jameson stood trial in a Chinese court
here. He's under sentence of death.

777
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:23,524
Opium was growing on
a remote piece of mission property.

778
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:26,402
He didn't know,
but technically he's responsible.

779
01:21:26,485 --> 01:21:29,363
Why go to a Chinese court?
He coulda ducked that.

780
01:21:29,446 --> 01:21:32,408
He didn't want to.
He's in Cho-jen's custody now.

781
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:36,870
We're going to Changsha to appeal
the sentence. We're sure it'll be changed.

782
01:21:36,954 --> 01:21:39,330
Then we can return to our work here.

783
01:21:39,414 --> 01:21:41,916
Changsha? That's where <i>we're</i> goin'.

784
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:46,671
We heard you were taking the
missionaries all the way down to Hankow.

785
01:21:46,754 --> 01:21:48,840
Changsha.

786
01:21:49,632 --> 01:21:51,718
Shirley!

787
01:21:56,389 --> 01:22:01,728
The <i>San Pablo</i> is going to Changsha.
It'll be quicker than going overland.

788
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:04,730
Cho-jen has agreed.
We'll leave when you are ready.

789
01:22:04,813 --> 01:22:06,898
I'll go pack.

790
01:22:08,025 --> 01:22:11,445
Now, don't take too much.
I'm sure we'll be returning.

791
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:14,865
Forward march!

792
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:39,722
Mr Bordelles, steam is up. We'll get
underway when the motor pan's secured.

793
01:22:39,805 --> 01:22:41,891
Aye aye, sir.

794
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:58,657
- Repel boarders port side, on the double.
- Aye aye, sir. Repel boarders port side!

795
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,702
Repel boarders port side!
Repel boarders port side!

796
01:23:20,845 --> 01:23:23,389
Don't shoot unless attacked. Wait the word.

797
01:23:23,472 --> 01:23:26,183
Wait the word!

798
01:23:26,433 --> 01:23:29,270
It's the bilge coolie, Captain.

799
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:31,730
- Hold fire!
- Hold fire!

800
01:23:32,022 --> 01:23:34,692
- What was he doing ashore?
- I send.

801
01:23:40,531 --> 01:23:43,325
- Cho-jen?
- They are not ours.

802
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,413
Let him go! He is our countryman!

803
01:23:50,123 --> 01:23:54,877
- What's he saying?
- "Watch what we do to the running dog."

804
01:24:01,259 --> 01:24:03,803
- Who is it, sir?
- It's Po-han.

805
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:13,687
Offer ransom.
Speak I pay money, $100.

806
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,856
- No, sir.
- Speak!

807
01:24:19,484 --> 01:24:26,950
Release him. The American sailors
will pay $100 if you let him go.

808
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:31,538
We dare you to shoot.

809
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:34,916
- What?
- They dare ship to shoot.

810
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:41,005
Yes. They'd like another incident.
They'd like a war. Tell them $200.

811
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:45,968
He will pay you $200.
He will pay $200.

812
01:24:46,761 --> 01:24:48,721
Four hundred!

813
01:25:00,775 --> 01:25:04,028
- You dirty bastards!
- Crosley, stand clear of that gun!

814
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:07,614
- They're killing that coolie!
- Stand clear! Bronson, take over.

815
01:25:07,697 --> 01:25:10,116
Hold station, Holman.

816
01:25:10,951 --> 01:25:12,869
Five hundred!

817
01:25:12,953 --> 01:25:15,830
$500, the Captain will pay you.

818
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:21,211
Let him go! Let him go!

819
01:25:26,633 --> 01:25:29,636
Steady. Steady. Hold station, Holman.

820
01:25:47,778 --> 01:25:49,446
Offer $1,000!

821
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:51,907
$1,000! $1,000!

822
01:25:51,991 --> 01:25:54,451
- Get back to your station.
- Do something!

823
01:25:54,535 --> 01:25:58,955
- Get below, or I'll have you shot for mutiny.
- Well, shoot <i>somethin'!</i>

824
01:26:01,124 --> 01:26:06,129
Someone save me! Please shoot me!

825
01:26:07,005 --> 01:26:09,674
Po-han say, somebody shoot him.

826
01:26:22,854 --> 01:26:25,939
Holman! Holman!

827
01:26:31,403 --> 01:26:32,863
Holman!

828
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,802
- Jake.
- Get out.

829
01:29:23,152 --> 01:29:26,613
That man this afternoon, who was he?

830
01:29:30,617 --> 01:29:33,662
He was a bilge coolie I trained.

831
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:38,583
So you became a teacher too, hm?

832
01:29:41,253 --> 01:29:43,004
Yeah.

833
01:29:44,297 --> 01:29:46,383
That's good.

834
01:30:45,772 --> 01:30:48,859
If you had killed a Chinese,
there'd have been a massacre.

835
01:30:48,942 --> 01:30:54,990
We'd have had to open fire, and it might have
been the war the Bolsheviks want. You see?

836
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:58,410
As it is, in killing the coolie...

837
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:03,248
Although I can understand your feelings,
I can't condone what you did.

838
01:31:04,082 --> 01:31:09,295
However, I choose to ignore it officially,
on condition you request a transfer.

839
01:31:10,296 --> 01:31:15,676
You're opposed to the whole spirit aboard the
<i>San Pablo,</i> Holman. You've disrupted morale.

840
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,514
You've been involved in the
only two deaths this ship has ever had,

841
01:31:20,598 --> 01:31:23,142
and the men consider you a Jonah.

842
01:31:24,769 --> 01:31:29,857
If you won't request a transfer to keep
your record clean, then I'll request it.

843
01:31:33,235 --> 01:31:38,156
I'll request it, sir.
You want me to keep running the engine?

844
01:31:39,032 --> 01:31:43,036
Yes. It'll be some time
before a replacement can get here.

845
01:31:46,581 --> 01:31:48,667
That'll be all.

846
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:56,488
- Engine ahead one third.
- Engine ahead one third.

847
01:34:56,572 --> 01:35:00,534
- Prepare to drop anchor out here.
- Aye aye, sir. Stand by the anchor.

848
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,836
- Stop engine.
- Stop engine.

849
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:17,301
Let go the anchor.

850
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,450
Did you ever find out
what happened to them engine manuals?

851
01:35:41,533 --> 01:35:44,328
Mr Jameson says he has them.

852
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:59,843
- Hit them with the hose if they get too close.
- Aye aye, sir.

853
01:35:59,927 --> 01:36:02,012
- Get a fire hose up here.
- Right.

854
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:14,817
The Boatmen's Union
has declared a strike on your ship.

855
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,820
When the missionaries go ashore,
send an armed escort.

856
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:21,657
- With what orders, sir?
- The same orders the ship has.

857
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:26,662
Fire only to save American lives,
and then only when everything else fails.

858
01:36:29,623 --> 01:36:34,211
We demand that you permit us to take off
the citizens of Republic of China

859
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:37,714
who you are holding against their will.

860
01:36:43,762 --> 01:36:46,598
You can go to hell. Hit 'em with the hose.

861
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:49,434
Aye aye, sir. Give us the water.

862
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:24,094
Come ahead! Come ahead!

863
01:37:27,389 --> 01:37:30,309
Keep it smart!
Come ahead! Come ahead!

864
01:37:37,232 --> 01:37:39,985
Left, right, left. Left.

865
01:37:40,068 --> 01:37:42,154
Left. Left, right, left.

866
01:37:56,418 --> 01:37:58,504
Detail, halt.

867
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,426
Mr Jameson.

868
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:07,679
Miss Eckert, how nice to see you again.

869
01:38:08,055 --> 01:38:10,140
Left face!

870
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:17,481
Mr Bordelles, this is Major Chin
of the Nationalist Chinese Army.

871
01:38:18,857 --> 01:38:23,111
- What is your mission here, Mr Bordelles?
- I ask you that, Major Chin.

872
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:27,032
- This compound is American property.
- It is Chinese soil.

873
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:33,038
I have authority under Chinese law
to commandeer it for battalion headquarters.

874
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:38,293
You have no right to be here under arms.
I will have you escorted back to your ship.

875
01:38:38,377 --> 01:38:40,546
Let me warn you, Major Chin.

876
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:45,300
If your superior officers are not prepared
to go to war against the United States,

877
01:38:45,384 --> 01:38:49,513
they will undoubtedly disavow
your actions and make amends.

878
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:53,142
Do you understand my meaning?
It has happened before.

879
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,312
All too often before.
But we've had enough of that now.

880
01:38:57,396 --> 01:39:00,649
I will quote your own history to you,
Mr Bordelles.

881
01:39:00,732 --> 01:39:03,235
"If you mean to have a war, let it begin here."

882
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:08,365
Gentlemen, please. Mr Bordelles,
we're perfectly safe here with Major Chin.

883
01:39:25,966 --> 01:39:30,053
You may have your men sling arms,
or you may have them lay down their arms.

884
01:39:30,137 --> 01:39:34,641
You may go under escort or under full arrest.
That is all the choice I will give you.

885
01:39:34,725 --> 01:39:37,019
And you must make it now.

886
01:39:41,982 --> 01:39:44,067
Present arms.

887
01:39:57,164 --> 01:39:59,625
Sling... arms.

888
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:06,840
Turn right!

889
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:22,189
Right face.

890
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:28,695
Right and left about... turn.

891
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:40,123
Detail, forward march!

892
01:42:15,385 --> 01:42:20,140
- Don't wash it. Burn it! Burn it.
- Throw that out.

893
01:42:20,224 --> 01:42:22,935
Nobody could wash it
clean enough for me to wear.

894
01:42:23,018 --> 01:42:25,813
- What the hell happened?
- Shut up!

895
01:42:27,648 --> 01:42:29,942
Wash this, will you?

896
01:42:36,615 --> 01:42:40,828
- Will there still be liberty, sir?
- I have no instructions to the contrary.

897
01:42:40,911 --> 01:42:46,458
- They'll tear the town apart.
- Restrict it to that place they usually go.

898
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:48,585
Aye, sir.

899
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:04,518
- Where you been?
- Nobody'd rent me a room for Maily.

900
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:07,855
- You get one?
- Finally. It cost me an arm and a leg though.

901
01:43:07,938 --> 01:43:11,608
- What's going on?
- She's been with them since I got here.

902
01:43:11,692 --> 01:43:14,319
- They've got her drinking.
- Did you tell her?

903
01:43:14,403 --> 01:43:18,574
I ain't had a chance.
Give me the dough, Frenchy.

904
01:43:19,908 --> 01:43:22,661
I'll talk to Shu,
have him get her away from them, huh?

905
01:43:22,744 --> 01:43:24,830
Yeah.

906
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:30,335
Shu?

907
01:43:30,419 --> 01:43:33,672
I got the $200 for Maily.
Now, let's do it quiet.

908
01:43:33,755 --> 01:43:38,552
Just pry her loose from those guys
in a few minutes and bring her outside.

909
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:41,305
I got the $200.

910
01:43:54,443 --> 01:43:58,989
- Outside.
- I say $210.

911
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:04,495
Well, how about it, sailor?

912
01:44:04,578 --> 01:44:06,663
$210?

913
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:10,000
You said the price was $200, Shu.

914
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:13,837
- And I said $210.
- Butt out of this, mister.

915
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:15,798
All right, break it up, you guys.

916
01:44:15,881 --> 01:44:18,675
You've got no authority over me, sailor.

917
01:44:18,759 --> 01:44:21,470
He's right.

918
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:23,639
Match it.

919
01:44:26,642 --> 01:44:28,685
- I'll pay $210.
- $220.

920
01:44:29,311 --> 01:44:33,899
- Auction! Auction! How about it, Mr Shu?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

921
01:44:33,982 --> 01:44:37,694
We haven't had an auction here yet.
So let's do it.

922
01:44:39,655 --> 01:44:41,782
Why not?

923
01:44:41,865 --> 01:44:45,202
- Wait a minute. Keep clear.
- Put her up on the block.

924
01:44:47,704 --> 01:44:53,043
Ladies and gentlemen!
Now, just look at this merchandise.

925
01:44:53,127 --> 01:44:57,381
Now, what am I bid for this clean,
delicious piece of girl-flesh here?

926
01:44:57,464 --> 01:44:59,216
- Come on, what am I bid?
- $230.

927
01:44:59,299 --> 01:45:01,260
And 40.

928
01:45:01,343 --> 01:45:05,639
Boys, boys. That won't even buy one leg.

929
01:45:06,807 --> 01:45:11,061
Brand-fresh new goods,
untouched by human hands.

930
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:16,316
- Let's bid it up here, come on.
- $250!

931
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:19,945
- $275!
- More! More!

932
01:45:21,446 --> 01:45:24,116
Boys! Who'll say $300 and we see it all?

933
01:45:29,913 --> 01:45:32,166
All right, let's take a look at her.

934
01:45:35,335 --> 01:45:37,004
- $300.
- $300 I got...

935
01:45:37,087 --> 01:45:40,757
- $300. Now let her go, damn you!
- She ain't yours yet, buddy.

936
01:45:42,342 --> 01:45:44,511
$325.

937
01:45:46,305 --> 01:45:48,765
- $350!
- $350, I...

938
01:45:48,849 --> 01:45:51,810
Strip her. Strip her!

939
01:45:56,690 --> 01:46:00,152
Strip her! Strip her! Strip her! Strip her!

940
01:46:00,235 --> 01:46:02,571
$350! I said $350! Now that's it!

941
01:46:02,988 --> 01:46:06,074
- Bid $400 and we strip her.
- OK. $400.

942
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:16,794
Jake, come on!

943
01:46:30,724 --> 01:46:34,561
Watch the steps. They're slippery.
It's down this way.

944
01:46:37,731 --> 01:46:39,817
- Anybody after us?
- Nah.

945
01:46:58,335 --> 01:47:01,171
- Oh, let me go back.
- After all that?

946
01:47:01,255 --> 01:47:03,340
- Please!
- No. No.

947
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:05,717
Here. Here.

948
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:15,727
- Boy. If ever I get my hands on those guys...
- You've got enough troubles.

949
01:47:15,811 --> 01:47:18,438
What happens now?

950
01:47:18,522 --> 01:47:22,818
Well, I guess I'll go back tomorrow
and pay Shu the $200.

951
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:24,987
That's all she owes him.

952
01:47:27,281 --> 01:47:29,366
- OK.
- I'll see you.

953
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:32,995
No, hey, hey.
Hang on a minute. I'll go with you.

954
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:51,054
You all right?

955
01:47:53,098 --> 01:47:55,726
I'm sorry as hell about...

956
01:48:00,981 --> 01:48:03,400
You'll be OK here.

957
01:48:03,484 --> 01:48:07,237
I'm gonna go tomorrow
and pay Shu just what you owe him.

958
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:10,199
Then I'll get you on a train to Shanghai.

959
01:48:11,783 --> 01:48:16,997
Look, if I can't get you on a train
right away, you could stay here, huh?

960
01:48:18,957 --> 01:48:21,794
Maybe I'll... I'll drop in.

961
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:32,095
I sure as hell apologise. I don't know
what to say about those guys. They...

962
01:48:38,018 --> 01:48:40,270
You all right?

963
01:48:40,354 --> 01:48:43,232
Let me go away. Just let me go away.

964
01:48:43,315 --> 01:48:48,779
No. I want you to go to Shanghai like
you want, but not just away like that.

965
01:48:50,697 --> 01:48:53,909
I'll do what you want. You've bought me.

966
01:48:55,619 --> 01:48:58,956
No. I didn't buy you.

967
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:06,380
Oh, sure, I'm gonna pay some money,
but I'm not buying you.

968
01:49:08,257 --> 01:49:10,342
I don't want it to be...

969
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:17,099
Well, I don't want it to be like that between us.

970
01:49:20,269 --> 01:49:22,938
I want it to be something else.

971
01:49:26,066 --> 01:49:28,235
It's got to be something else.

972
01:49:32,948 --> 01:49:35,033
You'll be all right.

973
01:49:38,537 --> 01:49:41,999
Please. Please don't leave me.

974
01:50:07,149 --> 01:50:09,568
- Jake?
- Yeah?

975
01:50:11,612 --> 01:50:14,490
- I wanna marry her.
- Hey! Now, wait a minute...

976
01:50:14,573 --> 01:50:18,535
I don't know what I've been doing.
Years with them dumb pigs...

977
01:50:19,786 --> 01:50:22,664
They got a law.
You can't marry no Chinese girl.

978
01:50:24,666 --> 01:50:29,630
- One of them missionaries might marry us.
- Well, they ain't gonna do it.

979
01:50:29,713 --> 01:50:32,633
Why don't you just move in with her?

980
01:50:32,716 --> 01:50:35,761
No. I don't want that.

981
01:50:39,598 --> 01:50:42,351
Maybe we could get it done in Chinese?

982
01:50:45,979 --> 01:50:48,357
I just know I wanna marry her.

983
01:50:53,612 --> 01:50:55,280
Six dollars.

984
01:50:55,364 --> 01:50:57,074
OK.

985
01:50:57,157 --> 01:50:59,243
Thank you.

986
01:51:01,495 --> 01:51:06,250
Sounds kinda nuts, but guys catch these
birds so you'll buy one and set it free.

987
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:09,128
You know, just for the hell...
For the fun of it.

988
01:51:09,211 --> 01:51:11,713
- Go ahead.
- It's a lovely idea.

989
01:51:11,797 --> 01:51:16,718
Well, it's supposed to make you feel like
when you help an old lady across the street.

990
01:51:16,802 --> 01:51:19,304
Go, fella.

991
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:28,272
It does. It's ridiculous,
but it makes you feel marvellous.

992
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:46,582
- What happens if you make it?
- You get a wish.

993
01:51:46,665 --> 01:51:48,750
Oh.

994
01:51:50,085 --> 01:51:52,880
Jake, you made it!
You got it! You get a wish.

995
01:51:52,963 --> 01:51:55,132
What do you want?

996
01:51:55,215 --> 01:51:58,719
- I don't know.
- Well, there must be something.

997
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:01,513
Yeah, well. I used to want... want an engine.

998
01:52:02,973 --> 01:52:05,392
Isn't the engine still important?

999
01:52:07,686 --> 01:52:09,980
Well, not like it used to be.

1000
01:52:12,733 --> 01:52:16,987
- Why don't you take my wish?
- OK.

1001
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:20,574
Oh, hey. Mr Jameson said
I could lend these to you.

1002
01:52:20,657 --> 01:52:23,368
These are the booklets for the machinery.

1003
01:52:23,452 --> 01:52:25,788
- OK. I'll look 'em over.
- All right.

1004
01:52:27,122 --> 01:52:29,541
- Well, go ahead. Take your wish.
- OK.

1005
01:52:37,049 --> 01:52:39,510
- Jake?
- Huh?

1006
01:52:39,593 --> 01:52:41,845
- Don't you wanna know?
- Know what?

1007
01:52:43,055 --> 01:52:45,766
Don't you wanna know what I wish for?

1008
01:52:46,391 --> 01:52:48,185
OK.

1009
01:52:48,268 --> 01:52:53,190
Well, I wished that someday you'd feel
like telling me more about yourself.

1010
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:57,069
Sometime.

1011
01:52:57,152 --> 01:52:59,238
When you feel like it.

1012
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:02,324
OK.

1013
01:53:05,452 --> 01:53:07,538
So? Then what happened?

1014
01:53:08,497 --> 01:53:12,292
- You just keep pullin', don't you?
- You can't just stop in the middle.

1015
01:53:12,376 --> 01:53:14,837
Well, why not?

1016
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,548
Because it's about you. I'd like to know.

1017
01:53:18,799 --> 01:53:21,885
OK. I graduated at the head of my class.

1018
01:53:21,969 --> 01:53:24,054
Jake!

1019
01:53:27,099 --> 01:53:29,643
Um... I got kicked outta school.

1020
01:53:30,102 --> 01:53:32,855
- Aw...
- Aw?

1021
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:37,442
No, I mean it. What happened?

1022
01:53:41,446 --> 01:53:44,491
Well, me and this guy
got in it on a class picnic.

1023
01:53:44,575 --> 01:53:48,495
He brought a couple of bottles of booze
and he was chargin' double for drinks.

1024
01:53:48,579 --> 01:53:51,582
And I never liked him anyhow,
so I hung one on him.

1025
01:53:51,665 --> 01:53:56,170
Thing was, though, I was gonna get
my diploma in a couple of months.

1026
01:53:56,253 --> 01:54:01,467
So I went to see the principal.
He was one of them soft, smiley kind of guys.

1027
01:54:02,426 --> 01:54:07,723
He said "If you'll sign this paper saying
you brought the booze, that'll be that."

1028
01:54:08,807 --> 01:54:14,021
So, like a bonehead, I signed it. Then
he looks at the paper and he kinda smiles.

1029
01:54:14,104 --> 01:54:17,357
He says "Well, I'll have to think about it."

1030
01:54:19,735 --> 01:54:22,029
So I guess I started swingin'.

1031
01:54:22,112 --> 01:54:25,949
I forgot he was wearing glasses,
and I put out his eye.

1032
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:34,583
So anyhow, the judge says "You got three
choices: Army, navy, reform school."

1033
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:36,752
Well, why did you pick the navy?

1034
01:54:36,835 --> 01:54:39,046
Well, ain't much water in Utah.

1035
01:54:40,589 --> 01:54:45,344
Jake. Wasn't there anybody
to stick up for you with the judge?

1036
01:54:46,762 --> 01:54:50,891
My mother. She didn't count
for very much around there, though.

1037
01:54:53,644 --> 01:54:56,605
But a good dame.

1038
01:55:13,664 --> 01:55:16,708
We're mixing our lives together, Maily.

1039
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:21,171
We'll never be able to unmix 'em again.
And we'll never want to.

1040
01:55:22,256 --> 01:55:28,470
I take you for what you are, and all
that you are, and mix you with all of me.

1041
01:55:30,013 --> 01:55:32,516
And I don't hold back nothing.

1042
01:55:34,393 --> 01:55:38,230
When you're cold and hungry
and afraid, so am I.

1043
01:55:40,065 --> 01:55:45,404
I'm gonna stay with you all I can,
and take the best care of you I can.

1044
01:55:48,407 --> 01:55:51,910
And love you... till I die.

1045
01:55:58,417 --> 01:56:00,502
Now you say it.

1046
01:56:02,546 --> 01:56:06,675
I will always love you,
and honour and serve you,

1047
01:56:08,677 --> 01:56:11,263
and stay as near to you as I can,

1048
01:56:12,264 --> 01:56:14,641
and do everything for you,

1049
01:56:15,142 --> 01:56:17,227
and live for you.

1050
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:23,066
I won't have any life except our life together.

1051
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:31,742
I will just love you, Frenchy,
all of me, loving you for ever.

1052
01:56:45,464 --> 01:56:47,549
Now we're married.

1053
01:57:00,103 --> 01:57:02,731
Want to put a hand on ours for luck?

1054
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:10,656
I hope you have luck,
and I hope it goes smooth and easy for you.

1055
01:57:15,869 --> 01:57:17,955
Thanks for comin'.

1056
01:57:36,932 --> 01:57:39,017
They seem very much in love.

1057
01:57:40,018 --> 01:57:43,021
- Frenchy is.
- Not Maily?

1058
01:57:43,105 --> 01:57:47,192
Yeah, but she knows.
She's not foolin' herself.

1059
01:57:47,276 --> 01:57:50,654
- About what?
- Well, for one thing, she's Chinese.

1060
01:57:50,737 --> 01:57:54,408
And for another,
one day he's gonna get shipped out.

1061
01:57:54,491 --> 01:57:57,077
- She could follow him.
- Where?

1062
01:57:57,161 --> 01:57:59,580
What they got right now ain't no good.

1063
01:57:59,663 --> 01:58:03,750
Somethin' called a "block committee"
is trying to kick 'em out of their rooms.

1064
01:58:03,834 --> 01:58:05,919
Where are they gonna go?

1065
01:58:06,587 --> 01:58:08,547
Just runnin' from hole to hole.

1066
01:58:12,551 --> 01:58:14,887
Still, I envy them.

1067
01:58:30,486 --> 01:58:32,571
Jake...

1068
01:58:50,714 --> 01:58:53,091
It ain't gonna work, Shirley.

1069
01:58:54,259 --> 01:58:56,762
Why?

1070
01:58:56,845 --> 01:59:02,392
Cos you're goin' back to China Light
pretty soon, and I'm goin' back to the fleet.

1071
01:59:04,812 --> 01:59:08,941
Jake? Come back to China Light with us now.

1072
01:59:13,153 --> 01:59:16,782
You know how hard
they look for deserters, Shirley?

1073
01:59:18,992 --> 01:59:21,787
And what happens to 'em
when they catch 'em?

1074
01:59:22,538 --> 01:59:25,457
Well... Well, I just thought...

1075
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:31,797
Knowing how you feel about the military,
and that you taught Po-han...

1076
01:59:32,506 --> 01:59:35,300
That ain't what we're talkin' about.

1077
01:59:35,384 --> 01:59:39,429
Oh, it's good up there, Jake.
It can be a good life.

1078
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:57,072
The court's agreed
to let Mr Jameson go back.

1079
01:59:59,408 --> 02:00:03,579
You could come as
a kind of engineering missionary.

1080
02:00:09,293 --> 02:00:11,670
I shouldn't have suggested it.

1081
02:00:13,839 --> 02:00:15,924
I'm sorry.

1082
02:00:18,343 --> 02:00:21,805
I told you not to talk to sailors, didn't I?

1083
02:01:50,894 --> 02:01:54,648
Hey, look. I wonder what's the matter.
They're jumpin' all over.

1084
02:01:54,731 --> 02:01:57,693
Hey, it's our coolies. They're jumpin' ship!

1085
02:02:10,706 --> 02:02:13,000
Bend off.

1086
02:02:16,545 --> 02:02:20,466
- Hey, what the hell happened?
- Shing put opium on board, said it was ours.

1087
02:02:20,549 --> 02:02:24,970
- Ski, the bonehead, dumped it in the furnace.
- The Captain told me to get rid of it.

1088
02:02:25,053 --> 02:02:29,224
- We can't run this ship without coolies.
- Well, we're gonna.

1089
02:02:29,308 --> 02:02:32,102
Shall we try to mask the smoke
with rubber, Captain?

1090
02:02:32,186 --> 02:02:35,522
It's too late, Mr Bordelles. It's too late.

1091
02:02:40,652 --> 02:02:44,907
The <i>San Pablo</i> is now in
a state of siege here, and will be all winter.

1092
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:50,621
The water level in the channel is already
too low for us to leave before spring.

1093
02:02:50,704 --> 02:02:52,873
There will be no liberty.

1094
02:02:52,956 --> 02:02:57,920
No contact with the shore except a guard
mail trip to the consulate once a week.

1095
02:02:58,003 --> 02:03:01,340
Each of you will get a chance
to make this trip once.

1096
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:08,555
They have singled out
<i>San Pablo</i> for destruction,

1097
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,975
using their new weapons
of boycott and propaganda.

1098
02:03:13,602 --> 02:03:18,607
They expect in the end
to haul down the flag in shame and disgrace.

1099
02:03:20,484 --> 02:03:23,111
We will not let them do that.

1100
02:03:23,195 --> 02:03:27,658
When the time comes, we will
defend our flag with our life's blood.

1101
02:03:29,827 --> 02:03:32,913
They will watch us every minute.

1102
02:03:32,996 --> 02:03:39,336
They will gloat over every rust streak down
our sides, every sign of military slackness.

1103
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:46,426
They expect to destroy us.
But it will only make us stronger.

1104
02:03:59,273 --> 02:04:01,358
That's all. Carry on.

1105
02:04:02,317 --> 02:04:04,403
All right, Chief. Carry on.

1106
02:04:04,486 --> 02:04:07,364
Ten hut! Dismissed.

1107
02:04:39,521 --> 02:04:43,984
The next incident, they could
just as well turn on him and kill him.

1108
02:04:44,067 --> 02:04:46,403
Well, at least he's off our necks, sir.

1109
02:04:46,487 --> 02:04:50,574
Our primary mission
is still to defend American lives.

1110
02:04:50,657 --> 02:04:52,951
Even if they are damned fools.

1111
02:04:58,165 --> 02:05:00,959
Pray for an early spring.

1112
02:05:01,043 --> 02:05:03,420
Or permission to open fire.

1113
02:07:40,536 --> 02:07:44,748
Frenchy, you mustn't come here any more.

1114
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:48,961
- You must stay on the ship.
- No.

1115
02:07:59,346 --> 02:08:03,976
Sometimes, when I come here,
I think maybe you've gone...

1116
02:08:06,019 --> 02:08:08,981
They've chased you away
someplace I can't find you.

1117
02:08:09,064 --> 02:08:12,734
- Maybe it would be better.
- No, sweetie, don't say that.

1118
02:08:13,735 --> 02:08:16,405
I can't help it.

1119
02:08:16,488 --> 02:08:22,119
I'm nothing.
I'm not Chinese, I'm not American.

1120
02:08:22,202 --> 02:08:24,997
And the child will be nothing.

1121
02:08:29,626 --> 02:08:31,712
He'll be ours.

1122
02:08:32,713 --> 02:08:35,591
Like you're mine. That's all we need.

1123
02:08:46,143 --> 02:08:49,521
Harris, clean up your stinkin' mess!
I'm not gonna do your work.

1124
02:08:49,605 --> 02:08:53,108
- I won't stand any more of your watches.
- Harris, lay below!

1125
02:08:53,192 --> 02:08:55,777
- Perna, you...
- I said lay below!

1126
02:08:55,861 --> 02:08:58,238
Harris!

1127
02:08:58,322 --> 02:09:01,241
- Cut it out! Cut it out, you guys!
- Let him go! Let him go!

1128
02:09:01,325 --> 02:09:04,912
- Get the deck aides to help you.
- What's the matter with you guys?

1129
02:09:04,995 --> 02:09:09,917
- Isn't there enough trouble with slopeheads?
- Get him down below where he belongs!

1130
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,879
- I'm an electrician. He belongs below.
- Knock it off!

1131
02:09:13,962 --> 02:09:16,924
And the rest of you!
What are you standin' around for?

1132
02:09:22,304 --> 02:09:26,433
I want you to start
wearing side arms. Franks, too.

1133
02:09:28,977 --> 02:09:32,314
When the water in the channel rises
and we can get to Shanghai,

1134
02:09:32,397 --> 02:09:34,483
everything will be all right.

1135
02:09:35,317 --> 02:09:39,613
Till then, the men are not responsible.
They have to be protected.

1136
02:09:40,489 --> 02:09:43,784
- So stay clear of them.
- Aye aye, sir.

1137
02:09:45,202 --> 02:09:49,206
There's never been a mutiny
aboard a United States ship of war.

1138
02:09:49,289 --> 02:09:52,501
I'm not gonna give them
the slightest chance on this one.

1139
02:09:52,584 --> 02:09:54,670
I understand, sir.

1140
02:11:57,918 --> 02:12:02,589
I told him to go back
to the ship to see a doctor.

1141
02:12:04,216 --> 02:12:08,053
But he was afraid they would lock him up.

1142
02:12:08,137 --> 02:12:10,681
How long has he been dead?

1143
02:12:10,764 --> 02:12:12,975
Last night.

1144
02:12:39,668 --> 02:12:41,753
You can't stay here.

1145
02:12:43,672 --> 02:12:45,757
I'll be all right.

1146
02:12:46,592 --> 02:12:48,677
You go back to your ship.

1147
02:12:49,887 --> 02:12:52,181
I'm all through with that.

1148
02:12:54,725 --> 02:12:57,227
Come up to China Light with me.

1149
02:13:01,815 --> 02:13:03,901
I can't.

1150
02:13:06,236 --> 02:13:08,822
Listen. Listen.

1151
02:13:11,116 --> 02:13:13,994
Frenchy'd want you to.

1152
02:13:14,077 --> 02:13:17,039
It's gonna be all different up there.

1153
02:13:17,122 --> 02:13:21,460
Nobody's gonna ask you
whether you're Chinese or American,

1154
02:13:23,504 --> 02:13:25,756
where's your father, or anything.

1155
02:13:27,049 --> 02:13:30,177
It's just gonna be everybody, all together.

1156
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:40,354
And you got your kid to think about.

1157
02:13:41,688 --> 02:13:44,233
Shirley says they grow vegetables,

1158
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:47,653
and they got a milk goat.

1159
02:13:50,155 --> 02:13:55,953
You can't stay here. Get out.
Him, too. Wake him up, white man's slut!

1160
02:14:13,137 --> 02:14:16,265
- The white pig is dead.
- Throw her out.

1161
02:15:09,026 --> 02:15:12,696
Stop! What are you doing here?
Come with us. Come!

1162
02:15:21,288 --> 02:15:25,083
Don't come back
to that part of the city again.

1163
02:15:37,596 --> 02:15:39,681
What the hell happened?

1164
02:15:40,599 --> 02:15:43,644
Don't say nothin' about this
on the ship, will you?

1165
02:15:45,312 --> 02:15:47,397
All right.

1166
02:16:00,744 --> 02:16:03,247
Captain! Mr Bordelles!

1167
02:16:05,165 --> 02:16:07,251
Captain?

1168
02:16:12,881 --> 02:16:16,385
- Repel boarders.
- Repel boarders! All hands to stations.

1169
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:19,471
Repel boarders! Repel boarders!

1170
02:16:45,747 --> 02:16:47,833
Hey! What the?

1171
02:16:58,635 --> 02:17:01,513
- Get Holman up here on the double.
- Aye aye, sir.

1172
02:17:12,065 --> 02:17:15,444
- Captain wants to see you.
- Now what's goin' on?

1173
02:17:15,527 --> 02:17:17,613
I don't know.

1174
02:17:26,663 --> 02:17:29,374
- What's this all about?
- I don't know, sir.

1175
02:17:29,458 --> 02:17:33,754
You were ashore yesterday. What happened?
Tell me. That's an order.

1176
02:17:33,837 --> 02:17:37,007
- I don't know anything about no murder.
- He is a murderer!

1177
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:41,595
He killed a Chinese woman
who was carrying his child!

1178
02:17:43,472 --> 02:17:45,808
What is it? What's he talking about?

1179
02:17:48,101 --> 02:17:50,187
Frenchy's wife. Maily.

1180
02:17:51,814 --> 02:17:53,899
I think they killed her.

1181
02:17:55,442 --> 02:17:57,528
What happened?

1182
02:17:59,113 --> 02:18:04,493
Frenchy's dead. He got sick
and he couldn't make it back.

1183
02:18:06,578 --> 02:18:09,081
While I was there they busted in and...

1184
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:13,836
I didn't think they'd do that.

1185
02:18:16,964 --> 02:18:22,177
They say you killed her. That's all that's
important. How do they know your name?

1186
02:18:22,761 --> 02:18:24,972
They must have found my hat.

1187
02:18:28,183 --> 02:18:31,478
Within two days
this'll be an international incident.

1188
02:18:31,562 --> 02:18:35,440
"American Gunboat Sailor
Kills Chinese Woman."

1189
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:40,487
- Is the channel deep enough yet?
- Well, I think we could make it, sir.

1190
02:18:40,571 --> 02:18:43,991
We may have to fight our way out of here.

1191
02:18:44,074 --> 02:18:46,660
Not for you personally, Holman.

1192
02:18:46,743 --> 02:18:51,039
You only matter now
as a symbol of your country.

1193
02:18:51,123 --> 02:18:53,208
That's all.

1194
02:19:00,966 --> 02:19:03,844
- Secure from repel boarders.
- Aye aye, sir.

1195
02:19:53,685 --> 02:19:58,607
We wanna talk to you. Word is, they ain't
gonna let us out till they get you.

1196
02:19:58,941 --> 02:20:01,819
As long as you're aboard,
they ain't gonna give up.

1197
02:20:01,902 --> 02:20:06,281
They got guns between here and Hankow.
Blow us right out of the water.

1198
02:20:06,365 --> 02:20:08,450
You oughta turn yourself in.

1199
02:20:08,534 --> 02:20:12,830
Tell the Captain you'll go ashore
and stand trial so we can get outta here.

1200
02:20:12,913 --> 02:20:16,416
- I didn't kill Maily.
- Then you got no problems.

1201
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,710
They'll let you go.

1202
02:20:26,218 --> 02:20:31,348
You give yourself up, Holman. You've been
a Jonah since the day you come aboard.

1203
02:21:28,113 --> 02:21:30,866
Captain!

1204
02:21:35,204 --> 02:21:37,831
Looks like nationalist soldiers this time.

1205
02:21:37,915 --> 02:21:41,335
Repel boarders.
Get Holman up to the flying bridge.

1206
02:23:15,846 --> 02:23:18,557
Underjust and equal law of nations,

1207
02:23:18,640 --> 02:23:22,728
we demand you give up
murderer Holman to people's justice.

1208
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:28,233
Under the just law of nations, you people
are pirates. I will not parley with you.

1209
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:32,696
We will!

1210
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:34,865
Come and get him!

1211
02:23:36,575 --> 02:23:39,953
- Come and get him!
- Silence on the main deck!

1212
02:23:42,581 --> 02:23:44,708
Homang, come down!

1213
02:23:46,251 --> 02:23:49,880
Homang! Come down!

1214
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:56,512
- Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
- Homang, come down.

1215
02:23:57,179 --> 02:24:01,642
Homang, come down.
Homang, come down.

1216
02:24:01,725 --> 02:24:08,982
Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
Homang, come down. Homang, come down.

1217
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:14,488
Holman, if you make any effort
to give yourself up...

1218
02:24:18,659 --> 02:24:21,245
You in the sampan there, shove off!

1219
02:24:22,496 --> 02:24:24,581
Shove off, or I'll fire into you.

1220
02:24:28,210 --> 02:24:30,629
Crosley, fire a burst into the water.

1221
02:24:36,927 --> 02:24:39,012
Crosley, damn you, fire a burst!

1222
02:24:40,931 --> 02:24:43,016
The gun is jammed, sir.

1223
02:24:45,936 --> 02:24:48,981
- Bronson, fire a burst!
- The gun's jammed, sir.

1224
02:24:51,024 --> 02:24:55,863
Homang, come down!
Homang, come down! Homang, come down!

1225
02:25:11,378 --> 02:25:15,132
Homang, come down! Homang, come down!

1226
02:25:20,053 --> 02:25:21,889
Homang...

1227
02:25:48,707 --> 02:25:52,544
Mr Bordelles,
make all preparations for getting underway.

1228
02:25:52,628 --> 02:25:56,381
- Take her out of rifle range and anchor her.
- Aye aye, sir.

1229
02:25:57,382 --> 02:25:59,676
Captain...

1230
02:26:33,627 --> 02:26:36,880
Make preparations for getting underway.

1231
02:26:36,964 --> 02:26:39,049
Aye aye, sir.

1232
02:26:41,927 --> 02:26:45,097
Here. Wear this.
Come back up as soon as we secure.

1233
02:26:55,107 --> 02:26:58,068
Make all preparations for getting underway.

1234
02:28:54,101 --> 02:28:56,228
Captain?

1235
02:28:56,311 --> 02:28:58,647
Sir, there's an urgent message.

1236
02:28:59,398 --> 02:29:03,444
Nationalist troops have Nanking.
They're killing American treaty people.

1237
02:29:03,527 --> 02:29:09,283
British and American ships have shelled
the city. Marines are landing in Shanghai.

1238
02:29:09,366 --> 02:29:15,080
Sir? Treaty people are being directed
to flee to the coast for their lives.

1239
02:29:15,164 --> 02:29:19,585
Plan Red will be put into effect
upon confirmation from Washington.

1240
02:29:34,683 --> 02:29:36,768
Mr Bordelles, get Franks.

1241
02:29:37,519 --> 02:29:39,605
Come into my cabin, all of you.

1242
02:29:54,203 --> 02:29:58,123
What happened this morning
has not gone down on paper yet.

1243
02:29:58,207 --> 02:30:01,835
It is not history unless it goes down on paper.

1244
02:30:01,919 --> 02:30:06,799
What is going down on paper for
the end of <i>San Pablo</i> is quite different.

1245
02:30:07,424 --> 02:30:11,678
Our radio communications are out of order.
They're out of order.

1246
02:30:11,762 --> 02:30:14,473
We are therefore on our own.

1247
02:30:14,556 --> 02:30:17,059
Not hampered by orders from above.

1248
02:30:18,018 --> 02:30:21,897
At dawn we will get underway.
We will proceed into the lake.

1249
02:30:21,980 --> 02:30:25,943
Then, instead of turning downriver
to Shanghai, we will cross the lake,

1250
02:30:26,026 --> 02:30:29,696
and turn up the Chien River to China Light.

1251
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:33,408
Our objective will be to rescue
the missionaries at China Light.

1252
02:30:33,492 --> 02:30:36,954
After the slaughter at Nanking
they will be desperate for rescue.

1253
02:30:37,037 --> 02:30:40,374
We will make one last,
savage thrust deep into China,

1254
02:30:41,291 --> 02:30:44,586
and if the <i>San Pablo</i> dies,
she dies clean.

1255
02:30:45,712 --> 02:30:48,048
It is my responsibility to the ship.

1256
02:30:51,468 --> 02:30:53,554
And to the men.

1257
02:30:54,805 --> 02:30:58,350
They've been put through intolerable strain.

1258
02:30:58,433 --> 02:31:01,687
They rate this... last chance.

1259
02:31:03,647 --> 02:31:06,859
Reports indicate the Chien river
is blocked by a boom of junks

1260
02:31:06,942 --> 02:31:10,320
linked with bamboo cable
and defended by militia.

1261
02:31:10,404 --> 02:31:15,701
We will break that boom and we will move
on to rescue the people at China Light.

1262
02:32:04,792 --> 02:32:07,044
All right. There's the boom.

1263
02:32:11,965 --> 02:32:16,845
About a dozen junks, 50 to 60 feet apart,
a cable from bow to bow.

1264
02:32:20,098 --> 02:32:21,850
- Half speed.
- Half speed!

1265
02:32:42,704 --> 02:32:46,500
It looks like the sampans
are bringing more men from shore.

1266
02:32:48,293 --> 02:32:52,172
- Drop armour. Call general quarters.
- All hands, general quarters.

1267
02:32:52,256 --> 02:32:54,341
Man your battle stations.

1268
02:33:08,605 --> 02:33:10,691
Let's go! Let's go!

1269
02:33:17,531 --> 02:33:19,992
Look alive! Look alive!

1270
02:33:34,882 --> 02:33:37,676
Minimum crew in engine spaces.
All others topside.

1271
02:33:37,759 --> 02:33:39,845
Aye aye, sir.

1272
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:45,392
Minimum crew in the engine spaces.
All others topside.

1273
02:33:45,476 --> 02:33:50,230
Comin' up. Stawski, take the throttle.
Perna and MacDonald, handle the boilers.

1274
02:33:50,314 --> 02:33:52,399
The rest of you, on deck.

1275
02:33:54,777 --> 02:33:56,862
Bronson.

1276
02:34:04,077 --> 02:34:07,623
Holman! Set up a BAR position forward.
You others, lend a hand.

1277
02:34:07,706 --> 02:34:09,792
- Aye aye, sir.
- I'll get it.

1278
02:34:27,351 --> 02:34:29,436
From the bulkhead over.

1279
02:34:30,562 --> 02:34:34,608
- Battle stations manned and ready.
- Very well. Run up the battle flag.

1280
02:34:34,691 --> 02:34:37,861
Aye aye, sir. Battle flag!

1281
02:34:37,945 --> 02:34:40,364
- Full speed!
- Full speed.

1282
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:46,411
- Holman, you lower the jack staff.
- Let's go!

1283
02:35:20,779 --> 02:35:22,865
Here you go.

1284
02:35:24,616 --> 02:35:30,289
- Steer for the centre of the channel.
- Steering for the centre of the channel, sir.

1285
02:35:35,669 --> 02:35:39,923
Prepare to concentrate fire
on the centre junk.

1286
02:35:41,049 --> 02:35:44,595
- Have Wellbeck take the con below.
- Chief, take the wheel.

1287
02:35:44,678 --> 02:35:46,763
I got it.

1288
02:36:21,089 --> 02:36:24,676
- They're within range, sir.
- They'll have to fire first.

1289
02:36:50,661 --> 02:36:52,746
Half speed.

1290
02:36:53,872 --> 02:36:55,958
Half speed, sir.

1291
02:36:58,669 --> 02:37:02,840
- Main battery, commence firing.
- Main battery, commence firing.

1292
02:37:10,264 --> 02:37:11,598
Ready.

1293
02:37:17,479 --> 02:37:19,940
Ready!

1294
02:37:23,527 --> 02:37:25,112
Ready.

1295
02:37:36,957 --> 02:37:39,042
Ready.

1296
02:37:44,423 --> 02:37:46,508
Sir.

1297
02:37:49,178 --> 02:37:52,097
- Commence firing.
- Commence firing.

1298
02:37:52,181 --> 02:37:56,101
- Commence firing! Commence firing!
- Commence firing! Commence firing!

1299
02:38:03,025 --> 02:38:05,110
Magazine.

1300
02:38:13,035 --> 02:38:15,329
- Here you go.
- Ready!

1301
02:38:34,556 --> 02:38:37,059
How about that? The mast!

1302
02:38:37,726 --> 02:38:40,062
Ready.

1303
02:38:45,609 --> 02:38:48,153
- Captain.
- Ready!

1304
02:38:59,039 --> 02:39:03,168
- Slow speed.
- Slow speed, sir.

1305
02:39:03,252 --> 02:39:05,546
- Main battery, cease firing.
- Cease fire.

1306
02:39:05,629 --> 02:39:07,714
Cease firing!

1307
02:39:08,173 --> 02:39:10,926
- Boarding party, take arms!
- Aye aye, sir.

1308
02:39:11,009 --> 02:39:14,388
Boarding party, take arms!
Boarding party, take arms!

1309
02:39:14,471 --> 02:39:16,557
Boarding party, take arms!

1310
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:29,194
First wave, take boarding position.

1311
02:39:49,465 --> 02:39:52,759
- Take her now and lay her alongside.
- Aye aye, sir.

1312
02:40:10,611 --> 02:40:12,154
Fix bayonets!

1313
02:40:21,538 --> 02:40:23,624
Prepare to grapple!

1314
02:40:36,929 --> 02:40:38,639
Grapple!

1315
02:40:52,986 --> 02:40:55,072
Boarding party, away!

1316
02:41:07,376 --> 02:41:09,586
Why, you dirty...

1317
02:41:21,890 --> 02:41:23,976
Let's go.

1318
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:52,087
Aboard, second wave!

1319
02:41:52,171 --> 02:41:54,256
Let's go!

1320
02:42:06,810 --> 02:42:08,228
Down!

1321
02:42:34,338 --> 02:42:36,423
Come on, Holman. Come on!

1322
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:19,883
Captain!

1323
02:43:47,786 --> 02:43:51,457
Return to the ship! Come on, Bronson.
Lend a hand with the wounded.

1324
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:54,042
Return to the ship!

1325
02:45:48,490 --> 02:45:52,327
They'll try to repair the boom.
We haven't the strength to break it again.

1326
02:45:52,411 --> 02:45:56,248
If I'm not back by daylight, consider
our mission failed. Sail without me.

1327
02:45:56,331 --> 02:46:00,294
- Captain, I can't do that.
- That's all. That's an order.

1328
02:46:00,711 --> 02:46:03,005
Whom do I have for a landing party?

1329
02:46:03,088 --> 02:46:06,925
Well, all of them are badly cut up, sir,
but it's the best we could do.

1330
02:46:07,009 --> 02:46:10,429
Farren will handle the boat,
and Bronson and Crosley.

1331
02:46:10,512 --> 02:46:13,265
Holman will be the senior petty officer.

1332
02:46:16,435 --> 02:46:18,937
- Remember your orders.
- Aye aye, sir.

1333
02:46:20,189 --> 02:46:24,318
- The men performed brilliantly, Mr Bordelles.
- Yes, sir.

1334
02:46:24,401 --> 02:46:26,487
Uh, Captain?

1335
02:46:27,446 --> 02:46:29,531
Good luck, sir.

1336
02:47:05,192 --> 02:47:10,364
Lieutenant Collins, it would be much better
for all of us if you go away at once.

1337
02:47:10,447 --> 02:47:13,909
- We have no intention of leaving.
- Your lives are in danger.

1338
02:47:13,992 --> 02:47:18,539
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Jameson, you're to come back with me.

1339
02:47:19,206 --> 02:47:21,834
You have five minutes
to pack what you need.

1340
02:47:21,917 --> 02:47:25,754
Our militia of students
went to fight you at the boom.

1341
02:47:25,838 --> 02:47:29,716
I was hoping to see <i>them</i>
come back victorious instead of you.

1342
02:47:30,467 --> 02:47:33,137
- You've heard about Nanking?
- Yes.

1343
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:36,056
But those events have no bearing here.

1344
02:47:36,140 --> 02:47:38,934
You alone endanger us.

1345
02:47:39,017 --> 02:47:41,270
I must ask you to leave now.

1346
02:47:42,187 --> 02:47:44,314
My duty is to protect you.

1347
02:47:44,398 --> 02:47:48,402
No longer. Shirley, will you please
get that paper from my desk?

1348
02:47:48,735 --> 02:47:53,782
We've declared ourselves stateless persons.
We've sent our names to Geneva.

1349
02:47:55,576 --> 02:47:57,661
That's impossible.

1350
02:47:58,745 --> 02:48:00,831
Read this.

1351
02:48:09,965 --> 02:48:12,509
- Jake.
- I tried to get back sooner. I couldn't.

1352
02:48:12,593 --> 02:48:15,137
- You staying?
- Yes. What happened at the boom?

1353
02:48:15,220 --> 02:48:19,016
By that signed declaration
we have renounced nationality itself.

1354
02:48:19,099 --> 02:48:23,479
Your uniform now gives you no authority
over us and no responsibility for us.

1355
02:48:23,562 --> 02:48:26,648
- Romantic nonsense.
- We've convinced most people here

1356
02:48:26,732 --> 02:48:30,402
that there is no connection
between ourselves and the gunboats.

1357
02:48:30,486 --> 02:48:35,032
- Your presence only endangers us.
- We're at war, Jameson. They'll kill you.

1358
02:48:35,115 --> 02:48:36,825
They will not.

1359
02:48:36,909 --> 02:48:40,245
Perhaps once this might have
protected you, but not now.

1360
02:48:40,329 --> 02:48:44,500
Now it is shooting and killing.
It's too late for such fine distinctions.

1361
02:48:44,583 --> 02:48:46,668
It will protect us.

1362
02:48:47,711 --> 02:48:52,257
This afternoon, my ship fought
its way through down there at the boom.

1363
02:48:52,341 --> 02:48:57,262
People were killed on both sides. You will not
make that a futile and meaningless battle.

1364
02:48:57,346 --> 02:49:01,850
We will not serve to give meaning to your
heroics. Our lives have their own meaning.

1365
02:49:01,934 --> 02:49:05,521
- We have renounced nationality!
- You were sentenced to death!

1366
02:49:05,604 --> 02:49:08,315
I am free, under the protection of a student.

1367
02:49:08,398 --> 02:49:12,361
They will not care who protects you now.
Not after Nanking.

1368
02:49:12,444 --> 02:49:17,991
And it will not be a student militia
who comes for you now, but regular troops.

1369
02:49:18,075 --> 02:49:21,787
Miss Eckert, they will strip you and rape you.

1370
02:49:21,870 --> 02:49:27,626
And this whole valley will be destroyed when
our country comes to avenge your death.

1371
02:49:27,709 --> 02:49:30,546
Do you want that?

1372
02:49:30,629 --> 02:49:32,714
You don't know them.

1373
02:49:32,798 --> 02:49:35,968
Have you ever cared for
Chinese women raped and butchered

1374
02:49:36,051 --> 02:49:38,887
by the warlord troops
you favour with your treaties?

1375
02:49:38,971 --> 02:49:43,434
- In heaven's name, leave us alone!
- That's enough!

1376
02:49:44,726 --> 02:49:47,688
Holman, help them get their things together.

1377
02:49:49,189 --> 02:49:51,275
No, sir.

1378
02:49:52,443 --> 02:49:54,403
That's an order.

1379
02:49:54,486 --> 02:50:00,909
You better get back to the ship, Captain.
Cos they're stayin' here. And so am I.

1380
02:50:03,162 --> 02:50:05,247
Do you know what this is?

1381
02:50:06,206 --> 02:50:09,209
Desertion in the face of the enemy.

1382
02:50:09,668 --> 02:50:14,923
I ain't got no more enemies.
Shove off, Captain.

1383
02:50:16,592 --> 02:50:18,927
Jameson! Jameson, sir!

1384
02:50:19,803 --> 02:50:21,889
Jameson, sir, sir...

1385
02:50:22,556 --> 02:50:24,641
Jameson, sir...

1386
02:50:26,518 --> 02:50:28,604
Jameson, sir...

1387
02:50:30,397 --> 02:50:39,031
Cho-jen was killed at the boom.
Soldiers are coming to get you. You must go.

1388
02:50:41,533 --> 02:50:45,037
Shirley, he says Cho-jen is dead.

1389
02:50:46,413 --> 02:50:48,499
Oh, no.

1390
02:50:49,792 --> 02:50:52,044
No!

1391
02:50:55,839 --> 02:50:58,842
You killed him at the boom.

1392
02:50:58,926 --> 02:51:01,595
And now they're coming for me.

1393
02:51:01,804 --> 02:51:03,889
Because of you...

1394
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:06,934
and your blind pride.

1395
02:51:10,813 --> 02:51:12,898
Damn your flag!

1396
02:51:14,149 --> 02:51:16,235
Damn all flags!

1397
02:51:17,569 --> 02:51:20,072
It's too late in the world for flags!

1398
02:51:23,534 --> 02:51:25,619
Lights! Get the lights.

1399
02:51:33,377 --> 02:51:35,963
Wait. Wait!

1400
02:51:36,713 --> 02:51:38,715
Listen to me.

1401
02:51:40,759 --> 02:51:42,511
Wait. Listen...

1402
02:51:45,639 --> 02:51:47,724
No!

1403
02:52:09,163 --> 02:52:11,790
Is there another way out of here?

1404
02:52:11,874 --> 02:52:16,420
A hut by the back wall
has a door that leads to the open fields.

1405
02:52:16,503 --> 02:52:18,380
Show us.

1406
02:52:22,718 --> 02:52:24,803
Cover us. Come on.

1407
02:52:36,523 --> 02:52:38,609
Ammo.

1408
02:52:41,528 --> 02:52:44,615
- Which way?
- The doorway over there.

1409
02:53:09,890 --> 02:53:13,852
Holman, take charge
and get everybody back to the motor pan.

1410
02:53:14,603 --> 02:53:16,814
You're senior here.

1411
02:53:17,481 --> 02:53:21,944
I'll stay and make 'em think
we're all still here. Give me the BAR.

1412
02:53:26,824 --> 02:53:29,868
When I think you've gotten clear, I'll follow.

1413
02:53:33,956 --> 02:53:36,625
You did well at the boom today.

1414
02:53:41,463 --> 02:53:43,632
All of you.

1415
02:53:46,927 --> 02:53:50,013
Wait till I open fire, then get 'em out of here.

1416
02:53:53,225 --> 02:53:55,310
All right, you cover the screen!

1417
02:54:00,732 --> 02:54:02,818
You other men take the walls!

1418
02:54:03,944 --> 02:54:06,238
What the hell are we waitin' for?

1419
02:54:07,448 --> 02:54:09,533
Fire at anything that moves!

1420
02:54:26,008 --> 02:54:28,093
Jake...

1421
02:55:29,530 --> 02:55:32,282
He's dead. Get her outta here.

1422
02:55:32,533 --> 02:55:35,744
- Let's all get goin'.
- Somebody's gotta slow 'em up.

1423
02:55:35,828 --> 02:55:40,541
They'd nail us before we got to the river. If
they get her, you know what they'll do to her.

1424
02:55:40,624 --> 02:55:43,377
- Jake, for God's sake!
- Get goin'.

1425
02:55:56,598 --> 02:55:58,684
No! Jake!

1426
02:56:02,146 --> 02:56:04,314
Now go ahead. I'll be along.

1427
02:57:08,128 --> 02:57:10,714
Hold your fire, Bronson.

1428
02:57:12,591 --> 02:57:14,927
Don't shoot till you see something.

1429
02:57:17,513 --> 02:57:19,598
How we doin', Crosley?

1430
02:57:22,684 --> 02:57:24,978
Watch it, Crosley!

1431
02:57:59,763 --> 02:58:03,600
We're gonna get outta here,
Bronson! Watch the walls.

1432
02:59:28,185 --> 02:59:30,395
OK, everybody out!

1433
02:59:31,522 --> 02:59:34,149
Time to go, Holman. Right!

1434
02:59:34,650 --> 02:59:36,652
Right.

1435
03:00:36,503 --> 03:00:38,589
I was home.

1436
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:42,426
What happened?

1437
03:00:43,218 --> 03:00:45,304
What the hell happened?
