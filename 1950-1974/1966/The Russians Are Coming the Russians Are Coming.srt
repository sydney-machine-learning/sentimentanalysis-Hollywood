1
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,597
104, 105,

2
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,974
106,

3
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,936
107,

4
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,063
108,

5
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,774
109,

6
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,276
110,

7
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,820
111,

8
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,323
112,

9
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,243
113,

10
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,578
114,

11
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,789
115...

12
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,569
Why don't you go back to bed?
I'll keep the kids quiet.

13
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,571
You know I never can get back to sleep.

14
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,157
- Is there any coffee?
- It's not finished yet.

15
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,367
Have some orange juice.
You'll feel better.

16
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,537
This house is damp.
Doesn't the dampness ever bother you?

17
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,123
Any house by the sea
is bound to be damp.

18
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,625
No. This house is special.
It'll always be special.

19
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,628
It'll always be that damp summer place
on Gloucester Island.

20
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,380
Two-and-a-half months here,

21
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,133
it'll take two-and-a-half years
for my bones to dry out.

22
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,109
Here, listen to my back.

23
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,471
There. Did you hear that?

24
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,822
- I don't hear anything.
- Listen! There!

25
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,494
Tomorrow, we'll be going home.

26
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,106
You'll be nice and dry.

27
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:46,668
Your back won't make a sound,
and we'll never go anywhere again.

28
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,629
Ever.

29
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,673
We'll go.

30
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,871
Dad! Mom! There's some men outside!

31
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,124
- There are what?
- There are men outside! Lots of men!

32
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,086
- There are? What are they doing, Pete?
- I don't know. They're creeping!

33
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,398
- They're creeping, are they? Listen...
- I think they're creeping up on this house!

34
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,218
But, Dad!

35
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,527
Pete! Annie's asleep upstairs.

36
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,448
- They've got guns! I saw their guns!
- Maybe it's an ambush.

37
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,976
Why don't you go outside
and play some tennis?

38
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,201
Okay.

39
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,537
I warned you.

40
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,997
I know.

41
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,043
- Bacon and eggs all right?
- No. I'll get dressed first.

42
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,046
It's too damp to eat.

43
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:36,202
Honey, I have to work today, I really do.
What's the plan? Do I have to pack?

44
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,828
Walt, you don't have to do a thing.

45
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,581
Alison's coming.
We're going to spend the day packing.

46
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,750
I'll keep the kids away,
and you can work.

47
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,629
You know Larry's going to scream if I
don't get that second act worked out.

48
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,341
I told him last Wednesday I already had it.
I don't even have an idea for it.

49
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,027
You will. You know you will.

50
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,656
You know how producers are.
He'll say it's a masterpiece.

51
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,866
And it probably will be.

52
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,162
You get dressed,
eat a good breakfast, and just do it.

53
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,872
All right?

54
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,920
Yeah.

55
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,009
They're hiding out by the garage now.

56
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,930
And there's this great big one,
like Uncle Harry.

57
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,057
Like Uncle Harry?

58
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,768
Okay, Pete. You keep an eye on them.

59
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,063
I'll never get any work done today.

60
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,315
People running around the house.

61
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,842
Hello, good morning.

62
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,510
Okay?

63
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,680
- How are you?
- Very good.

64
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,305
Annie was awake till 10:00.
I'll let her sleep.

65
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,072
The toast is burning.

66
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,810
This darn thing.

67
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,914
Why I ever let that agent talk me into $125
for the dampest house in the...

68
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,195
- I counted them. There are nine of them.
- Come on.

69
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,072
Two of them've got Tommy guns,

70
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,324
and they're all talking
some foreign language.

71
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:24,620
- They could be Russians or something!
- Sit down and eat your breakfast.

72
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,123
- You don't even believe me!
- Just eat.

73
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,348
Okay.

74
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,065
Someone at the door.

75
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,733
You always know everything.

76
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,347
- What? What do you mean?
- It's probably Alison.

77
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,473
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

78
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,367
Alison, this early in the morning?
No, I'll get it.

79
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,919
Good morning, sir.
A pleasant good morning to you.

80
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,488
Good morning.

81
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,242
Please permit me to apologize
for this unusual disturbance,

82
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,911
but we are hoping for some
conversations, please.

83
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,830
Lady, and a young boy.

84
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,375
Good morning, also, my dear lady.
Good morning, young boy.

85
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,294
We are two strangers in this island,

86
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,437
and we wish to speak
with you about boats.

87
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,091
Boats?

88
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,902
- About boats?
- Yes, that is most exactly correct.

89
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,404
Boats.

90
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,436
I don't understand. I mean, who are you?

91
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,398
- I didn't hear a car. How did you...
- Please, not to be afraid. We are nobody.

92
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,860
We wish only to inquire
where to find powerboat.

93
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,906
Motor-powerboat for private use for
some brief little time, you understand?

94
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,341
Sorry, but I still don't understand.
There are no boats around here.

95
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,245
- No boats?
- No.

96
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,346
This is an island with no boats?

97
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:56,102
There are boats, some boats,
but not around here. In town.

98
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,131
In the harbor in town,
but there are none around here.

99
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,466
- Big boats?
- Yeah.

100
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,885
- Motor-powerboats?
- All different kinds of boats.

101
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,804
Ask them if they're Russians.

102
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,031
A nice little boy there.
Which way to harbor, please?

103
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,854
It's five miles down.

104
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,164
- Ask them if they're Russians!
- Peter, be quiet.

105
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,111
A clever little boy, very clever, to see
that my friend and I are foreigners here.

106
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,587
But of course, not Russians, naturally.

107
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,743
What would the Russians be doing
on United States of America island

108
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,747
with so many animosities and hatreds
between these two countries?

109
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,432
It is too funny idea, is it not?

110
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,022
No, we are, of course, Norwegians.

111
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,443
Norwegians?

112
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,515
On a small training exercise
for the NATO countries...

113
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,434
- NATO.
- NATO countries, of course, yes.

114
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,728
To reach place of power motorboats

115
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,998
is necessary to make borrowings
of automobile for short time only, sir.

116
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,819
- May I ask you something?
- Yes, of course.

117
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,739
Are there nine of you out there?
Are you all Russians with machine guns?

118
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,759
And does one of you look like Uncle...
I mean, look like a wrestler?

119
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:18,294
I'm sorry to comply with your statement,
but misfortunately

120
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,437
all of the answers
to these questions are yes.

121
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,023
He's got a gun!

122
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,387
- Please, to step inside the house.
- No, just wait a minute.

123
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,766
- You can't come in here.
- Lady, not to worry, for no harm is coming.

124
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,810
No harm. Absolutely no harm.

125
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,981
Don't be frightened. There's an explanation.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you, son.

126
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,482
- All to keeping calm.
- Yes.

127
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,652
I repeat, no harm is coming.
All now, please, being seated.

128
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,322
It's all right, just take it easy.
Pete, don't be scared.

129
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,840
- There's no need to be scared.
- I'm not scared.

130
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,621
Good boy.
Now, to answer some few questions

131
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,333
very quickly, so that there
is no necessity howsoever...

132
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,585
- Whatsoever.
- Whatsoever!

133
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,837
So that there is no necessity howsoever

134
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,882
why everybody in such
a nice American family

135
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,482
should get shot to little pieces.

136
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,360
You understand? Yes. Good.

137
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,448
- What else people are in this house?
- What?

138
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,810
There's only our little girl.
She's asleep upstairs.

139
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,745
But she's only a little baby.

140
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,442
So. First is necessary
to make borrowings of automobile.

141
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,959
Where are keys?

142
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,794
In my purse.

143
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,298
Bag.

144
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,348
If you don't mind, please.

145
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,986
Very good.

146
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,728
What is population of island, please?

147
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,606
- It's about 200 people.
- Honey, there's more than that.

148
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,650
In September?
You're thinking of the summer.

149
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,696
No, in West Village, all the farms.
You forgot to count the farms.

150
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,256
No matter! Not many people.

151
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,623
Please, you know of no boat
except at boat place?

152
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,724
No boat close to where we are here?

153
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,601
No, there just aren't any boats.

154
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,306
Very few questions more.

155
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,142
Don't tell them anything!
We'd be traitors!

156
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,744
Pete, just keep quiet. Here.

157
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,818
There is no establishment of US Navy
or Army or Coastal Guardians on island?

158
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,586
No US of Air Force?

159
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,213
No, there are no bases on Gloucester.

160
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,591
Gloucester.

161
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:42,763
Police constabulary? How many members
of police department here? 20, 40?

162
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,085
No, there are not that many.
Maybe three or four.

163
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,296
Don't tell them anything.
He hasn't even tortured you yet!

164
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,232
- Pete.
- Listen. No one's going to be tortured.

165
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,638
Couldn't you at least give us
some idea what this is all about?

166
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,821
I know it's none of...

167
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,742
None of my business, but...

168
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,066
It is necessary for you
to remain in this house,

169
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,778
I hope, most vigorously,
for short time only.

170
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,171
- We're not going anywhere, so that...
- Good.

171
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,827
Please, to remain absolutely good-behaved,
so that this man here,

172
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,136
a marksman of prize-winning caliber,

173
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,932
will not have the necessity
of shooting you to small pieces.

174
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,239
- I forgot. I meant to, but I forgot.
- Listen, there isn't much gas in the car.

175
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,325
The gas. Petrol.

176
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,330
- Gasoline.
- No time for stupid tricks.

177
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,541
Just to keep absolutely
good-behaved, yes?

178
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,339
Madam, once more,
I apologize for all this.

179
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,922
Why'd you let him do that?
What'd you let him kiss your hand for?

180
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:18,093
- I didn't know what he was going to do.
- You could have pulled it away.

181
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,361
I didn't want to make him mad.

182
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,713
- Pete! Come back here!
- Walt!

183
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,023
I'll call the police, that's what!

184
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,522
It doesn't buzz.
They must've cut the telephone line.

185
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:16,652
Is true. Now, please to sit down with
Mama and Papa, all together, yes?

186
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,588
Listen to me. You're not to try
anything like that again, do you hear?

187
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,300
- It's Annie!
- It's my sister!

188
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,264
Good morning, Mommy.

189
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,099
Good morning, darling.

190
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,186
I'm hungry. I want my breakfast.

191
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,272
All right, Annie.

192
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,942
All right, you'll have your breakfast.

193
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,050
Please, Mister and Missus.

194
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,195
I am most sinceriously sorry
for incident with little girl.

195
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,658
Suddenness of noise...

196
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,787
What's your name?

197
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,500
Alexei Kolchin.

198
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,754
My name's Annie Whittaker.
I'm going to be four.

199
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,341
Where did you come from?

200
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,803
From Soviet Navy submarine boat.

201
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,389
A submarine? You're off a submarine?

202
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,684
Last night, captain of submarine boat

203
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,856
is putting submarine boat
too close to land, against orders.

204
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,817
He want to look at America.

205
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,527
What for?

206
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,654
He never saw it.

207
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,240
All of a suddenness,

208
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,604
submarine boat is becoming
fixed on this place,

209
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,871
Gloucester Island.

210
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,940
You went aground!

211
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,485
Honey, that's it!
Their sub has gone aground!

212
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,987
Well, if that's... Wait a minute!

213
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,882
You're looking for a big motorboat
to try to pull the sub off the sandbar?

214
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,785
Da, is it!

215
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,286
Why did you come in here...

216
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,539
Anybody could go aground like that.
It happens all the time.

217
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,056
Please to disagree.

218
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,727
All are most sinceriously terrified
of what will happen now.

219
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,645
Why? What will happen?

220
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,842
Unless Rozanov is finding
power motorboat

221
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,777
will be coming many US of American

222
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,279
air machines

223
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,866
and the war vessels.

224
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,123
Blow up.

225
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,338
No more Soviet Navy submarine boat.

226
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,216
But they wouldn't.

227
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,884
They couldn't.

228
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,221
- Please?
- Just because you've gone aground?

229
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,959
It wasn't deliberate.
It was only an accident, wasn't it?

230
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,144
- They'd simply have to be sympathetic.
- Honey.

231
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,646
When you get captured, you'll get shot.

232
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,440
And I hope you do.

233
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,637
- You know you don't mean that.
- I do mean it.

234
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,763
Listen to me, son.

235
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,806
I can't. You were the
one who helped them!

236
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,642
What? What do you mean?

237
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,270
You told them everything they wanted
to know, just like Arnold Benedict!

238
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,371
That's Benedict Arnold, not...

239
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,207
What are you saying?

240
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,403
Are you saying you think
your father is a traitor?

241
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,696
Yes, I am.

242
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,575
I bet I'm the only guy in the fourth
grade whose father is a famous trader.

243
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,426
That's "traitor."

244
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,723
Just stop it. You're being silly.

245
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,401
Might as well give her a hand.
Here, honey, let me help you with that.

246
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,575
I'm going to do something.
I'm going to get that gun from him.

247
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,646
Walt, you're crazy! Don't.

248
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,314
You heard what Pete said?

249
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,458
He's only a child.
Now you're behaving like a child.

250
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,822
He's bigger, younger
and stronger than you are,

251
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,532
and he's got the gun!

252
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,008
He's also just as frightened as I am.

253
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,913
Sailor, as long as you're here,

254
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,792
- how about a cup of hot, cold...
- Do not come close with that, please.

255
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,377
- It's just a little cold...
- Please.

256
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:12,132
I do not want to hurt anybody.
Not children, not parents, also.

257
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,093
Walt, I don't think he wants it. Really.

258
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,553
Who comes there? Who?

259
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,265
It's probably Alison, and all those men.
Come in, Alison.

260
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,853
Alison. Did your brother
Fred come with you?

261
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:29,873
- Hi, Fred, come on in! I've got him now!
- No! Look out!

262
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,282
I got him! Grab him! Stop yelling!

263
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,534
Pete, I got him!

264
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,343
Hit him!

265
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,598
Let him go!

266
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,020
I got the gun!

267
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,525
All right, stick them up.

268
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,738
No shoot! No!

269
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,460
Darn curtain!

270
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,712
He's getting away!

271
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,178
But, Mr. Whittaker...

272
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,669
I'll bet he's hiding somewhere.

273
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,853
Walt! Don't shoot! It's us!

274
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,028
What are you gonna do?

275
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,225
Nothing. He ran for it. It's all over.
Everybody all right?

276
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,645
- But who is he, Mr. Whittaker?
- A Russian sailor.

277
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,815
Careful, Walt.
If he's gone, where did he go?

278
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,151
- He's probably hiding right over there!
- I tell you, he's gone.

279
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,212
Would he be silly enough to come back
when I've got the Tommy gun?

280
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,408
He'll be trying to get back
to the submarine.

281
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,842
All right, everybody in the house.

282
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,721
Pete, I guess we showed him.

283
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,167
We handled that situation
all right, wouldn't you say?

284
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:15,880
You just let him get away!
You didn't even shoot him!

285
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,981
You just let him get away!

286
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,110
Did you hear that? Did you?

287
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,865
- What are you raising, a delinquent?
- He's only a child.

288
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:31,312
- He's getting too much, just too much.
- He's a baby. Careful!

289
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,732
- He's eight-and-a-half years old.
- Nine-and-a-half.

290
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,915
There, you see?

291
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,807
If that's those high school kids...

292
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,651
Russians!

293
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,906
Brodsky.

294
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,911
Operator! Hurry up!

295
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,168
That Alice Foss? Call Chief Mattocks.

296
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,404
The Russians have landed!

297
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,591
They're here. Do you hear?
The Russians, in West Village.

298
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,303
And I'm being attacked!

299
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,349
Stop that! How dare you?

300
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,190
Help!

301
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,626
- Yeah?
- It's Alice Foss, Chief.

302
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,799
I'm sorry to bother you, Chief Mattocks,
but I just had a call from Muriel Everett.

303
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,926
What'd she want?

304
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:20,057
She was shouting that I should call you,
because according to her...

305
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,144
Muriel said the Russians have landed.

306
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,323
Wanna give me that again, Alice?

307
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,561
Muriel said the Russians have landed,
whatever that means, Chief.

308
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,830
And she said they were
attacking her personally.

309
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,901
Remember when she called
about that peeping Tom?

310
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,946
You know who that was, don't you?
It was Luther Grilk's horse.

311
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,781
I remember that one, Chief.

312
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,632
You handle it, will you?

313
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,551
Just go ahead and call her.

314
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,848
If all those men are in town,
they all have guns and they're desperate.

315
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,475
I mean, anything might happen.

316
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,854
Nobody's gonna do anything! Nobody!

317
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,106
- Tell the police they took our car.
- I will.

318
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,817
We have to find it before we go.
It doesn't belong to us.

319
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,943
I know.

320
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,487
- While you're there, call the plumber.
- All right.

321
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,825
- Tell him to turn off the water.
- Listen, if I'm not back in 20 minutes...

322
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,052
What? If you're not back
in 20 minutes, what?

323
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,166
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, nothing!

324
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,711
I'll be back just as soon as...
I'll be right back!

325
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,964
Totally unbelievable.
I've got work to do today!

326
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,508
If I don't get that second act,
Larry's gonna scream!

327
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,152
You look silly on a girl's bicycle.

328
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,058
If you wanna hit him,
it's all right with me.

329
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,409
You're riding for a fall, buster.

330
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,541
- You're riding for a fall.
- Hit him!

331
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,127
Get back! Just get in.

332
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,172
You change Annie, I'll start packing.

333
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,707
Muriel!

334
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,173
If that's the way she wants it,
that's the way it's gonna be.

335
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,850
Fern, why don't you
answer that telephone?

336
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,652
Mattocks here, who's that?

337
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,740
I'm awfully sorry to be bothering you again,
but I think something really is happening.

338
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:28,146
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried, but Muriel's line is dead.

339
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,815
I ain't a repairman.
If you got trouble with the lines,

340
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,251
you call up Ed Spooner or Art Pinkney,
the guys that work for you.

341
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,946
But Chief, Muriel Everett said...

342
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,382
I know what she said.
She said that the Russians had landed.

343
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,843
She said the Russians
landed in West Village.

344
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,431
Alice, come on, for the love of...

345
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:54,547
How could they land in West Village?
There's nothing out there but sandbars.

346
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,856
Couldn't they drop in parachutes?

347
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:03,530
- How many of the lines are out?
- The whole circuit. It's just dead.

348
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,490
All right, I'm up.

349
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,534
I said, I'm up.

350
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,437
Whatever is going on, I'm up.

351
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,274
While I'm getting dressed,
you call up Norman, Charlie, Les and Oscar.

352
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,874
Oscar Maxwell.

353
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,545
Tell them I said to get over
to the office right away.

354
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,173
Tell them I said they better
bring their guns, all right?

355
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,551
Yes, Chief!
But should I call the State Police?

356
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,846
No. I don't want them bastards.

357
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,766
- Shall I call the Coast Guard?
- No, Alice, nobody. Just...

358
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,213
Let's find out what's going on first.

359
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,006
If there is something going on,

360
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,274
before we start spreading around
a lot of alarms.

361
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,692
Okay, Chief.

362
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,700
The Russians have landed.

363
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,789
The Russians have landed in West Village
and are attacking the postmistress.

364
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,251
They're attacking Muriel Everett.

365
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,176
Fern!

366
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,761
Where the hell...

367
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,640
I'll get it. Will you eat?

368
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,226
Oscar Maxwell speaking.

369
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,230
Chief Mattocks wants you at the station,
and bring your gun. That's an order.

370
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,815
Bring my gun?

371
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,718
Gun?

372
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,930
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Russians.

373
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,072
Russians?

374
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,532
Russian parachutists!

375
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,018
Muriel Everett

376
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,562
reported that Russian parachutists...

377
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,456
A Russian parachutist
on Gloucester Island?

378
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,403
Russians!

379
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,696
Get my gun!

380
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,448
- Where's my gun?
- I saw it when I moved your shirts.

381
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,033
You shouldn't have moved it!

382
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,202
Can't you understand,
this is an emergency?

383
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,580
- And I can't even find my...
- It won't be there, those are my things.

384
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,458
You're a great help!
I can't get this thing on.

385
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,629
That isn't right. Here, I'll get it.
Just where did you put my badge?

386
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,438
- It's right here.
- Find that.

387
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,150
I can't get this thing fastened.

388
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,657
- Will you watch what you're doing?
- Sorry.

389
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,231
- What about me? What should I do?
- Just stay at home, in the house.

390
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,525
- But if you're gone...
- My cap!

391
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,002
The kids, why do they
put things in my cap?

392
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,615
Kids, I want you to pay attention to me.
This is very serious.

393
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,243
There's an emergency.
Chief called me to the station.

394
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,912
Listen to your mother, too.
Pay attention to her.

395
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,041
I don't want you going outside.
Or near the windows, okay?

396
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,642
Better yet, all of you stay
in the cellar. Understand?

397
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,712
Okay. Wonderful kid.

398
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,465
Norm, suppose they come here.

399
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,066
Suppose they start burning and looting.

400
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,487
- Suppose they start raping?
- Do what?

401
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,031
I don't know, Sarah.

402
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,644
The way I see it, you could kick up
a fuss and get yourself killed.

403
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,413
Or you could clear out the
minute you see them coming.

404
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,040
- Clear out?
- Yeah.

405
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,114
Clear out where?
The ferry isn't even running!

406
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,007
This is Sunday!

407
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,137
Norman. Where you going?

408
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,004
Morning, Norm. What's going on?

409
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,716
There's a report that the
Russians have landed out there.

410
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,109
Russians! Holy jumping!

411
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,639
They must be coming in at the airport.
It's the only way.

412
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,198
Will you get out of the way?

413
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,769
I said, will you get out of the way?

414
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,787
The chief called me down at the station.
I've gotta get there.

415
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,900
Will you get back in the house
with the kids, like I told you?

416
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,876
That goes for you, too, Isaac!

417
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,034
Did he say they've captured the airport?
The Russians have captured the airport?

418
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,220
I don't know, but there's some
kind of general alarm out.

419
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,417
Hey, Porter.
Do you know what's going on?

420
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,560
They've captured the airport!
There's a general alarm out!

421
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,370
Muriel?

422
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,331
Muriel!

423
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,269
Where are you?

424
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,482
What are you doing up there?

425
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,444
Holy Mackerel, girl!
What was it, a stickup?

426
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,572
Russians, Papa!

427
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,284
What are you doing,
hanging up there on the wall?

428
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,034
Handel!

429
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,246
Tchaikovsky!

430
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:10,125
Wilbert, I want you to get
hold of yourself. Calm down.

431
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,878
Chief's here. I'll talk to you later.

432
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,564
- Hey, Chief. What's going on?
- Is there any truth to it?

433
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:21,261
Take it easy. All I know is
Muriel Everett called up Alice Foss

434
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,654
and told her the Russians had landed.

435
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,659
She said the Russians had landed,
and they were attacking her personally.

436
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:34,165
Attacking Muriel Everett?
That's just plain crazy, Chief!

437
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,362
Anyway, she hollered to Alice
about getting attacked

438
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,630
and then her line went dead.

439
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,696
- What's going on?
- Who are you, boy?

440
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:07,159
- Walt Whittaker. We're staying out at the...
- Whoever you are, you better get moving.

441
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,953
This whole danged island's
under attack by Russians!

442
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,121
We're getting out!

443
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:15,000
- You're what? Wait a minute.
- Can't wait! We're getting out!

444
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,378
Wait a minute. What happened here?
Those Russians are just ashore.

445
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,881
That's right, they're all
over Gloucester Island.

446
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,008
Those Russians are not...

447
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,901
Hey, wait a second!

448
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,821
Hey, listen!

449
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,869
Those Russians are not...

450
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,627
Is anybody...

451
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,842
"Suppose," my foot!
There ain't any Russians anyplace.

452
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,081
But, I mean, just in case there are,
what are we supposed to do, Chief?

453
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,624
I just got here. I don't know.

454
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,059
My wife is just about out of her mind!

455
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,438
I'll tell you what we do. We shoot them.

456
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,275
No. We're not gonna shoot anybody.

457
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,679
Will you call back, Fern?

458
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,015
What are you trying to do,
start a panic here?

459
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,266
You talk about a panic.

460
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,477
There's people all over the streets,
running, yelling, screaming!

461
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,980
That's right, Chief.
Some of them even got guns.

462
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,915
If we can just keep this thing quiet.

463
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,128
Look! Ed Spooner! He's carrying a.22!

464
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,256
There's Joe Monsell, he's got a shotgun!

465
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,759
We gotta do something.
We really gotta do something.

466
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,054
Those people are running around
down there with guns!

467
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,765
That's great.

468
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,559
That's just great.

469
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,465
I thought all the nuts
went home after Labor Day.

470
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,259
We've gotta have a definite
plan of action, men.

471
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,303
That's what we need.

472
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,264
First off, we've gotta
have ourselves a leader.

473
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,641
Yeah! That's right!

474
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,727
The democratic way,
that's the way I'd be for.

475
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,786
Let's do it the Republican way!

476
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,568
Have nominations and a proper election.

477
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,295
But that might take time.

478
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,049
So I'm gonna suggest an alternate.

479
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,038
Anybody wants to be leader
ought to step up here right now,

480
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,623
and we'll put it to a voice vote.

481
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,224
You do it, Fendall!
You've got the sword.

482
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:11,275
Nobody else wants to do it,
I guess it'll have to be me.

483
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,864
So, if there are no objections,
I'll assume command.

484
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,117
One minute.

485
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,497
This may be it, men. This may be it!

486
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,000
All men with firearms,
form a line across the street.

487
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,631
Come on, men! Keep out of the way!

488
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,997
If an armed man falls,
an unarmed man will pick up his gun!

489
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,182
Don't fire until I give the order!

490
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,355
Men with shotguns,
don't fire until you see the whites!

491
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,362
Get out of the way! It's Agnes Grilk.

492
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,909
Get out of the way!

493
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,208
- That was Muriel Everett with her.
- They said Muriel was dead.

494
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,877
Stop it, Muriel! What are you doing?

495
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,790
If we can take some prisoners
without a fight, all the better.

496
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,894
But if they want war,
men, let it begin here!

497
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,598
Make it lively, boys.
Step lively. On the double!

498
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,450
All right, the armed contingent here.
Attention.

499
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,312
Now, count off!

500
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,996
One, two...

501
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,628
Morning, Fendall.

502
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,547
What's cooking?

503
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,717
Holy jumping, haven't you even heard?

504
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,661
- Heard what?
- The Russians!

505
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,122
The Russians have captured the airport!

506
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,641
- Anybody seen them, Fendall?
- You got any witnesses?

507
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,731
Speak up!
Anybody actually see any Russians?

508
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,846
All right, everybody go on home!
Just get off the streets.

509
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,766
- Norm, break it up.
- You heard the chief. Break it up.

510
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,644
Listen, Mattocks!
What are you trying to do?

511
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,369
Lots of people have seen them.

512
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,497
Reports are coming in every minute!

513
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,084
All right, men, every fourth man,
run and get your car!

514
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,172
- Hold it.
- Wait a minute.

515
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,160
- Just a minute there!
- Now what do you want?

516
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,663
I'm going out to the airport. You ain't.

517
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,540
- You're gonna stay right here.
- What?

518
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,376
You're gonna stay here until
I find out what the score is,

519
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,645
and don't you do nothing
till I tell you to, you got that?

520
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,813
Wait a minute, Mattocks!

521
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,734
You're gonna foul up the whole detail.

522
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,471
We've got a plan of operation
all worked out.

523
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,559
That don't give you no right
to tell the police what to do, Fendall.

524
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:09,521
We are governed by the laws of this town
as authorized by the Commonwealth,

525
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,732
and unless you got a federal warrant
that supersedes that,

526
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:17,836
you can keep your big fat mouth shut, or
I'll throw you in jail for disorderly conduct!

527
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,998
- Let's take him in, Link.
- Right, Chief. Let's take the slob in.

528
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,586
Take me in?
After I've been elected leader?

529
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,478
I'd like to see you try.

530
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,465
Norm.

531
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,900
Put that thing away, Fendall.

532
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,862
All right, I want all the unarmed men
to stay here in town.

533
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,933
Norm Jonas is gonna be in charge
of the town defense.

534
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,436
Norm, you stay here
and get things organized.

535
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,105
- You promised...
- Don't argue with me, do like I tell you.

536
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,915
Why do you have to argue
with me all the time?

537
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,697
All right, you can come along, Fendall.
Go on.

538
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,158
All right men, we're going!

539
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,994
Just keep your mouth shut,
and stay behind this jeep.

540
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,596
Get your cars and follow me.

541
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,361
Let's go. Move that car, will you?
Come on, you guys.

542
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:29,017
Get that Volkswagen out of here.
Come on, will you get it out of here?

543
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,909
What are you doing, Tom?

544
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,954
Are you trying to back over me? Move it!

545
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:55,142
- Holy jumping! Muriel, you all right?
- I think so.

546
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,561
What happened?

547
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,467
Agnes, there's the Reverend Hawthorne
and I'm still in my night things.

548
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:06,846
Are you all right? Why, it's Miss Everett.
You better come inside.

549
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,932
The telephone company says
the Russians...

550
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,742
Had you heard about it?
Some kind of invasion.

551
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,480
- Anybody know where Arthur Carew is?
- He went to get his teeth fixed.

552
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,107
He took the Friday boat.

553
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,359
I want somebody to run up
to Arthur's house

554
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,444
and get Millie to lend you
keys to the store.

555
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,405
Everett, you go up there. Listen.

556
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:27,534
Tell her to give you all the arms she's got
in stock. We got to have more guns.

557
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:31,496
Slim, go over to Mr. Paladini's.
He's got a couple of guns over there.

558
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,580
Do as I tell you.

559
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,683
All right, on one condition,
everybody pays cash.

560
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,487
Come on, they're opening up the bar.

561
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,325
We've just got to get organized.

562
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,836
Hey, Marvin, it's Luther Grilk.

563
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,700
That's the final...
Luther, how'd you get in there?

564
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,493
I didn't know you were there.

565
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,010
Morning, Marv.

566
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,513
Morning, fellows.

567
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,762
- What's going on?
- The Russians!

568
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,945
What?

569
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:47,530
I can't get anything but church services,
and there's not even any news.

570
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,991
Maybe they captured
all the radio stations.

571
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:54,287
What about that four-minute warning?
Did anybody get a four-minute warning?

572
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,721
Norm.

573
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,391
Double bourbon, coming up.

574
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,214
- Listen, Norm.
- Not now. Can't you see I'm busy?

575
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,341
Why don't you go sleep it off somewhere?

576
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,802
Leave that space clear there,
in front of that door.

577
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,638
Wait a minute. I just got an idea.

578
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,515
What if they captured
all the radio stations?

579
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,282
Ain't that the first place?

580
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,019
Luther, can't you see I'm busy?

581
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,981
- I'm trying to get something organized.
- But we're helping you.

582
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,123
Quiet!

583
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:30,824
You wanna do something to help?
You wanna do something important?

584
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,827
You know those people that live
in those shacks past the dump?

585
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,663
They got no way of knowing
about the alarm,

586
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,916
and there's no way of going
without a jeep, and we ain't got one.

587
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,669
- Why don't you get your horse...
- Beatrice?

588
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,256
Why don't you get Beatrice,
and ride up there on horseback,

589
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,190
and let those people
know what's happening?

590
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,737
There are women and kids up there,
and you could warn them.

591
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,492
I guess I could.

592
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,454
And I will!

593
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,416
Not that way. This way.
Clear that door. I told you guys.

594
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,806
- What are you...
- I got to get to my horse.

595
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,561
Norm! Where are you?

596
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:29,632
My things are packed.
Get the children's things, and we'll go.

597
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,468
- The ferry's not running.
- I don't care.

598
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,279
I'm not going to stay here with
those Russians running around.

599
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,108
- You Miss Whittaker?
- Yes, could you...

600
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,110
- My name is Bell.
- Could you help me?

601
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,738
I live over in Corner Pocket Bay.

602
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,781
Is your phone out of order?

603
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,452
Yes, it is. They cut the lines, you see,
some Russians from a submarine.

604
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:01,831
I can explain, but you wouldn't understand.
Are you driving to town or to West Village?

605
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,308
My husband went to the police
and hasn't come back.

606
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,184
Did you say Russians?

607
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,755
Why don't you ride
into West Village with him?

608
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,591
- I want to come!
- I don't think I ought to leave.

609
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,692
You go with him. We'll be all right.

610
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,264
All right. Pete, you stay here
with Alison and Annie.

611
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,725
- I'll be right back.
- Okay. I'll get the Tommy gun.

612
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,269
- You'll get the what?
- Come on, you come with me!

613
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,479
Wait a minute!

614
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,773
If you could give us a lift,
we'd be so grateful.

615
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,499
Take care of Annie. We'll be right back.

616
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,682
Come on, Gustav!

617
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,303
My name is Walt Whittaker.

618
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,306
I want to report that nine Russian
sailors came to my house...

619
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,475
What? Norman, come over here.

620
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,769
- This fellow says nine Russian sailors...
- What?

621
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,981
Aren't you that Whittaker fellow
from out there at Duck Head Point?

622
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:11,401
My brother was at your house last month,
cleaning out a clogged drain.

623
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,904
I want to report that nine Russian
sailors came to my house...

624
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,756
Sailors? You mean,
their navy's landing, too?

625
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,926
My God!

626
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,971
- Listen, fellows, come here.
- No. They're off a submarine.

627
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,936
It's not just parachutists.
The Russian navy's landed.

628
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,398
That means they've captured
the whole west half of the island.

629
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,472
Will you tell me,
what's all this about parachutists?

630
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:46,311
There's a shore party of nine men
off a Russian submarine, stranded.

631
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,938
My God. It's all over. It's finished.

632
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,859
We haven't got a chance, not a chance.
My God, how could such a thing happen?

633
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,043
Listen. All they...

634
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,132
We're surrounded! The navy's here!

635
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:06,789
You're in charge here, aren't you?
One of those Russians, he told us,

636
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:11,502
he said the other eight are coming here
to Gloucester Haven, to the harbor.

637
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,880
He said they wanted to get a boat.

638
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,216
Sam, we've got to do something.
You listen to me.

639
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:21,721
- Call Link and tell him what's happened.
- Link's out at the airport.

640
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,182
- We've just got to do something.
- What?

641
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,601
I'll tell you what.
We gotta call the President!

642
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,353
What?

643
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,898
The President of the United States.
He's got that there hot line.

644
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,566
- You've heard about that?
- Sure.

645
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:38,336
He'll either know what's happening,
or he'll get on the hot line and find out.

646
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:45,119
The Russians are... Just a second!
Those Russians just told me...

647
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:48,638
You can't use a hot line.
That's not for us to...

648
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,850
Hello, yes?

649
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,605
It's true, Mr. Carmichael.
It seems that the Russians have landed.

650
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,964
One small noise, you are dead.
You believe me?

651
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,564
Yes, I believe you.

652
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,246
Hello, Beatrice.

653
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,000
Hello, beauty. We got a big job to do.

654
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,586
Come here, Beatrice.

655
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,927
Come here, sweetie. Take it easy now.

656
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,932
This way.

657
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,944
One small noise, and you are dead.
Where's Kolchin?

658
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,128
Who?

659
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,797
I don't know. He ran away.

660
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,826
We had a struggle, you see.

661
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,828
I took away his gun.

662
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,179
You took Kolchin's gun? You?

663
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,299
Kolchin would not run away.

664
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,676
He would stay near house.
This is what he was told.

665
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,886
He was?

666
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,306
You mean, he's still there?
He wouldn't do anything to hurt...

667
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,141
We have big problem here.

668
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,311
We cannot get boat except
kill some men by boat place.

669
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,063
I don't care about your problem.

670
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,607
Would that kid do anything
to harm my family?

671
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,151
- If he touches them...
- No, Kolchin is good boy.

672
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,737
Is doing nothing howsoever
to hurt anybody.

673
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,923
Not to be worried, only listen.

674
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,785
Has Coastal Guardians
or Navy of United States

675
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,178
been told that we are here, yes or no?

676
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,806
I don't know.

677
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,975
I don't think so.

678
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,254
Some men in a bar down the street,

679
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,230
they were speaking about
telephoning the President.

680
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,525
What is communications with mainland?

681
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,762
- You mean, the telephone office?
- Yes.

682
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,722
It's right upstairs.

683
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:56,352
- Is there a battle going on at the airport?
- Office of telephone is upstairs?

684
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,453
Are there are parachutists all over...

685
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:04,292
- There are parachutists on island?
- No. I mean Russian parachutists.

686
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,406
Everybody on the island
is saying that...

687
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,882
Everybody on the island is crazy!

688
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,593
How many people in office of telephone?

689
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,387
I don't know.

690
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,416
Can I give you some advice?

691
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,141
You'll never make it down to the harbor.

692
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,795
Why don't you give yourselves up?

693
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:25,689
Either you'll kill somebody,
or you'll get killed.

694
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:29,067
Either way, you could start a war.

695
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,472
- What is your name?
- Whittaker, Walt.

696
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:38,269
Pay mark to this, we must have boat.
Even now, may be too late.

697
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,188
This is your island,
I make your responsibility.

698
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:44,984
You help us get boat quickly,
otherwise there is World War III,

699
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,210
and everybody is blaming you.

700
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,599
Hello. He said they were trying
to get a boat. Is that right?

701
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,059
They were trying to get a boat?

702
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,062
The fellow said the Russian said
they're trying to get a boat.

703
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,355
Tell you what we gotta do.

704
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,900
We gotta post a dozen men there
with guns to keep an eye on those boats.

705
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,026
That's right.

706
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,154
Will you put that drink down?
You've had enough of that stuff.

707
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,198
But, Norman, I've already paid for it.

708
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,674
Hello. Alice? Where the hell is she?

709
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:39,471
I don't know whether Chief Mattocks
has alerted anybody, Mr. Nelson. Hold on.

710
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,975
Just a minute, please.

711
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,149
All I know is...

712
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:56,529
Mr. Nelson! You've got no right
to address me in a tone like that!

713
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,243
You want the who? The President?

714
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,614
Mattocks.

715
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,494
Let's see what the butcher boy wants.
All right.

716
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,376
Well?

717
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:56,881
Hold on a minute. Look,
the airport's only half a mile away.

718
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,094
We can't just barge in,
like going to the ball park.

719
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,888
We gotta have a plan.

720
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:10,854
Let's leave the cars here,
and sneak up there and surround them.

721
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,466
Old "Blood and Guts" Hawkins.

722
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,801
I thought you wanted
to lead the charge, General.

723
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,971
What's the matter,
you getting a little queasy now?

724
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:21,724
- You got no right to speak to me like that.
- Yes, I have.

725
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:25,743
- With my military experience?
- Come on, Charlie, let's get out of here.

726
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,997
Come on, what are we waiting for?

727
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,251
Let me get in here.

728
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,298
Fendall, will you stop poking me
with that sword?

729
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,671
Come on, lady, just be nice and calm.
Not nice and calm.

730
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:55,424
You don't say a word,
and we don't kill you, yes?

731
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,609
Nice and calm.

732
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,181
I think he means it, ma'am,
so please don't scream or anything.

733
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,641
They're kind of desperate.

734
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,519
- But who are you?
- My name is Whittaker, they...

735
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,354
- Mr. Walter Whittaker?
- Yes.

736
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,731
- Didn't you rent the old Selwyn place?
- Yes.

737
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:14,485
I've put through some of your calls
to New York City. I'm Miss Foss.

738
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:15,569
Lady!

739
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:19,839
You and Whittaker Walt, you have nice
conversation some other day, yes?

740
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,285
You had some idea of getting
men from boat place?

741
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,510
No!

742
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,165
Unless you create a diversion.

743
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,767
What kind of diversion, please?

744
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,089
Send some of your men out of town,
and let them fire their guns in the air.

745
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,883
It's great idea.
I send my men 50 paces, and...

746
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:41,319
I congratulate you on extreme
genius of this idea.

747
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,350
- Not if you all disguised yourself.
- What?

748
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:49,311
Like with those clothes
downstairs at the cleaners.

749
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,356
You could sneak through town,
and no one would notice.

750
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,539
Is good.

751
01:10:56,627 --> 01:11:01,073
Are you really trying to help them?
Are you on their side?

752
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,492
Of course I'm not! How could you say...

753
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,454
I think it would be a whole lot pleasanter
if a lot of people didn't get killed.

754
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,847
All they're trying to do
is borrow a motorboat.

755
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,190
- What did they say?
- I don't know, I'm not with them.

756
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,408
Hi.

757
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,831
Excuse me, please. I am here still.

758
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,295
Please, you should not
be frightened of me.

759
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,796
Here.

760
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,465
You see? You.

761
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,509
I give you gun.

762
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,273
I'm not frightened.

763
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:57,872
Your forehead's bleeding.

764
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:37,146
- Guns?
- Where are they?

765
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,148
Who? What do you mean?

766
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,499
- The parachutists.
- The Russians.

767
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,987
What? What are you?

768
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:49,340
The Russian parachutists.
We got reports that they were...

769
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:52,453
Quiet! Let's get to the bottom of this.

770
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:56,373
Stanley, we know that this
whole island is under attack.

771
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:58,266
Where did they go?

772
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,018
I didn't see anybody.

773
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,354
Have you been sleeping, Stanley?

774
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:04,840
No.

775
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,441
Come on now, admit it.

776
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,817
No.

777
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,905
Are you trying to tell us that
nothing at all has happened here?

778
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,285
Will you shut up?

779
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:23,040
Think, Stanley.

780
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,048
- There was one thing that happened.
- What happened?

781
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:36,012
My phone is out of order.
I just discovered it this morning.

782
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:40,558
His phone is out of order.
That could be significant.

783
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:45,605
All the phones on the whole
west side of the island are out.

784
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:48,983
Where are you going?

785
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:53,305
We're going over to Muriel Everett's
house and check her telephone line.

786
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:57,518
After that, we're gonna go home.
The rest of you go on home, too. Go on.

787
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,020
Wait a minute!

788
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,650
Don't shove that thing in my face, Fendall.
Go on home, like I told you to.

789
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,319
You're not giving orders to my detail.

790
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,003
We are going, too.

791
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,449
Stay behind this jeep. Just follow me.

792
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:15,968
To your cars.
We're moving to West Village.

793
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:50,670
Emergency. Everybody to get from street.

794
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,737
Emergency. Everybody to get from street.

795
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:49,046
Dear, kind lady.
Sincerest apologies for what we do here.

796
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,814
For you, your equipment,
for all of this.

797
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,473
Whittaker Walt,
if you're a man who makes prayers,

798
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,392
this is time for special prayer
that all is going well.

799
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,785
I say goodbye for second time, yes?

800
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,128
Miss Foss, can you hear me?

801
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:33,340
On the count of three,
let's roll over to the wall.

802
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,068
When I say three, follow me. Here we go.

803
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,569
One,

804
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,806
two,

805
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,075
three. No, get off me!

806
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,959
Annie, go play in the sand.

807
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,161
You'll feel better
when you eat something.

808
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,261
Here.

809
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:06,430
I'm sure you'll feel better.

810
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,023
What?

811
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,485
What will become with me?

812
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,862
I must be arrested, surely.

813
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,157
But will Americans place me in prison?

814
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,333
I am...

815
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,461
I confess to you,

816
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,339
I have much fear of what
will happen with me.

817
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,467
A Russian seaman in America.

818
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,555
Don't be afraid.

819
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,765
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

820
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,649
What's your name?

821
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:07,658
Kolchin. Alexei Kolchin.

822
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:24,175
- What is your name, please?
- Alison. Alison Palmer.

823
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,189
Can I call you Alexei?

824
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:44,195
I never met anyone called Alexei before.

825
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,074
Here. Eat.

826
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:32,894
When I say three, press forward.
We're going to stand up.

827
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:36,205
But whatever you do, don't fall over.

828
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:41,085
One, two... Don't fall over!

829
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,103
Emergency.

830
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,274
Everybody to get from street.

831
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,609
Hey, Mom!

832
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:15,578
Just take it easy, Beatrice.

833
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:23,961
Hop, that's it, Miss Foss.
No, not that way. That way.

834
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,757
Hold it! Please.

835
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:35,097
Let's try to turn around. We can hop
better if we face each other, I think.

836
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,392
All right now, try turning around.
Here we go!

837
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,236
Courage.

838
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,950
All right now, let's start hopping.

839
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,661
Here we go.

840
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,244
Gloucester.

841
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,790
Gloucester Haven.

842
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:53,618
Hop. Good. Miss Foss, over here.

843
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,746
Don't pull that way.
We're not going over this way!

844
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,832
This way. Here we come.

845
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,224
Wonderful, Miss Foss.

846
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,994
You're doing fine. Just a moment.

847
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,776
We may have a problem here.

848
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:30,087
- A what?
- I said, we may have a problem here.

849
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,802
Wait, Miss Foss. Courage.

850
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,612
Let's try it, Miss Foss.

851
01:23:56,239 --> 01:24:00,769
We're going to go down one step at a time.
When I say three, hop.

852
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,077
Hop?

853
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,246
One, two...

854
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:11,628
Come out, you guys.

855
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,256
Sorry.

856
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:18,927
- The Russians, they're out here.
- Come on, you guys, down to the jetty!

857
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:20,971
Walt!

858
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,893
We're fine, Miss Foss.

859
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,146
Over here. This way!

860
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:22,684
You're doing beautifully.

861
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,869
Come down to my step, only one step.

862
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:32,876
You're doing fine,
but don't lean that way.

863
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:38,090
Miss Foss.

864
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:24,746
Come on, you guys,
let's head on back to our cars.

865
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,499
Let's head back to the
East Shore Road. Hurry up.

866
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,767
- Come on, everybody. Back to your cars.
- That's East Shore Road, boys.

867
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:34,271
- Are you all right, Miss Foss?
- I think so.

868
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,232
I think I'm gonna faint.

869
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:42,013
- Don't faint until you roll off me.
- Yes.

870
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:45,616
You're squashing me!
Just roll over, lightly.

871
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,957
What's the matter?

872
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,421
Sounds like it's coming from the harbor.

873
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:28,825
It's your father! It's Daddy.

874
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:34,456
- Walt, are you all right? What happened?
- I'm all right.

875
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:38,403
- Who's she?
- Did the Russians do it, Dad?

876
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,155
What happened?

877
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:44,242
- Take the gag out, and I'll tell you!
- He's okay, he's alive!

878
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,285
Alice!

879
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:46,744
Take her gag out.

880
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,512
Alice, what did they do to you?

881
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:50,013
Out!

882
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,940
No boat in the harbor
could catch that cruiser.

883
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,277
Don't you think I know that?
All of you armed men, follow me.

884
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,154
You unarmed men, clear off the streets.

885
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,364
We're gonna head out
that East Shore Road.

886
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,007
Keep your eye on that cruiser.

887
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,254
A shell!

888
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,966
Go get some more, Annie.
Go find some shells.

889
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:11,762
In Union of Soviet,

890
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,306
when I am only young boy,

891
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,808
many are saying

892
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,936
Americans are bad people.

893
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,548
They will attack Russians.

894
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:26,777
So all mistrust American.

895
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:34,284
But I think that I do not
mistrust American.

896
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,914
Not really sinceriously.

897
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:44,586
I wish not to hate anybody.

898
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,975
This makes good reason to you,
Alison Palmer?

899
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:04,898
Of course it does.
It doesn't make sense to hate people.

900
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,026
It's such a waste of time.

901
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,738
But it does not matter now.

902
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,892
Something has gone amiss.

903
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:17,828
Else otherwise Rozanov,
he is my officer,

904
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,581
he would have come back for me.

905
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:28,630
But I think now that everything
is completed for me.

906
01:30:56,367 --> 01:31:00,897
They tried to draw everybody away from
the harbor so they could steal the boat.

907
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:04,082
They tied us up upstairs and...
Where's Annie?

908
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,613
She's home. She's at the house.
Don't worry, Walt. Alison's with her.

909
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:12,450
You shouldn't have left her there.
That boy's liable to do anything.

910
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,910
- What boy?
- That boy, Kolchin.

911
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,288
They'll stop at nothing.
There's no limit to what they'll do.

912
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:19,665
They'll be shooting people
in the streets.

913
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:22,642
They'll be grabbing our kids
and using them as hostages!

914
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:25,854
Hostages? Come on, we gotta get Annie.

915
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,398
Walt, Pete!

916
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:30,734
Get in the car!

917
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:36,224
- What are you doing?
- I've got to borrow your car. Give me that!

918
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:39,951
- It isn't even paid for!
- I'll explain later. You'll get your car back.

919
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,584
He took my car!

920
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:50,629
I can't figure out where
they all went to.

921
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:52,949
Who?

922
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,493
The people in West Village.
Who do you think I mean?

923
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:58,470
Muriel Everett. All of them.
Where did they go?

924
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:00,847
Nobody there.

925
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,193
- Was that Matt Ferguson?
- Yeah, looked like his car.

926
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:17,056
Where's he think he's going? Who's that?

927
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:22,270
Looked a lot like that New Yorker fellow.
Took the old Selwyn place this summer.

928
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,412
- Name's Whittaker.
- That nut!

929
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:40,037
There's some bullets in the back.
Do you want me to load the gun?

930
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:42,331
Just sit still.
Take those bullets away from him.

931
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:45,460
- Just turn around.
- You shouldn't have left them alone.

932
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,171
You've no idea
how desperate those men are.

933
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:50,882
- You said we'd be perfectly safe.
- Who knew they would...

934
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:52,008
- Walt!
- What?

935
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:54,818
- Not so fast.
- It's all right. Don't panic.

936
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:57,529
Everything's gonna be all right.

937
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,031
He might do anything.

938
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,325
- What do you mean?
- He...

939
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,411
Just don't panic!

940
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:09,165
Why didn't you stay in the house
where you should've?

941
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,128
You just never listen!

942
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,124
Link, they were here!
They were shooting all over the place!

943
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:28,961
They stole the senator's cabin cruiser!
They wrecked the telephone office!

944
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:30,838
Nearly killed Alice Foss!

945
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,423
See, what did I tell you?

946
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,426
- Where are they now? Where's Norman?
- Up the East Shore Road!

947
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,261
Norm's chasing them!

948
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,572
They were here! Fendall! They were here!

949
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,312
Some of them are in disguise!
Some of them look like us!

950
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:48,288
Get them! Up the East Shore Road!

951
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,381
Gustav! Come back here!

952
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,223
If I am to be imprisoned,

953
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,311
could you perhaps come and see me there?

954
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:17,984
If I could be a little with you,
on some occasion,

955
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:21,946
I think I would say,

956
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:29,537
"Never mind,
I have my friend, Alison Palmer."

957
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:39,547
Is permitted to say

958
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,717
that I have

959
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,928
strong

960
01:34:45,721 --> 01:34:48,682
feeling of affection for you already?

961
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,152
Does this cause offensiveness to you?

962
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:19,713
You kissed me.

963
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:29,055
This mean the same as in
Union of Soviet Socialist Republic, yes?

964
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,292
Kolchin!

965
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:27,598
They must be all right.
Who'd want to harm them?

966
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,183
I'll get the gun.

967
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:32,603
Give me that gun, please.
Wait in the car, both of you.

968
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:34,412
Give me those...

969
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:39,485
Just stay behind me.

970
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:43,406
How do you load this darn thing?
Just get behind me, will you?

971
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,507
Stay back of me.

972
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:49,453
- I don't see anybody. I don't see Annie...
- In the house.

973
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:50,970
I'm frightened.

974
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,164
Stay back there.

975
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:53,374
- Be careful.
- Never mind.

976
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:56,392
- What are you gonna do?
- Annie!

977
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:10,281
Hey, where's my gun?
Come back! Stop or I'll fire.

978
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,246
He's in there.

979
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,750
Annie!

980
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:23,779
Come here. Here, take this.

981
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:25,448
They've got Annie!

982
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:28,033
You, stop.

983
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:31,746
Stop, or I'll fire. Where's my daughter?

984
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,763
I warn you to stop or I'll kill you!

985
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:53,741
Hello, Mommy!

986
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:30,653
Always I am saying goodbye to you,
and always I am meeting you again.

987
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,311
Alison, where were you?
We looked all over for you.

988
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:41,581
You better surrender, 'cause my dad
has a gun, so you just better surrender.

989
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,002
Are you hurt?

990
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,506
I am wounded in dignity only.

991
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:56,679
Please, I know everybody in this island
is complete and total crazy.

992
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,266
But you, Whittaker Walt,
you are crazy, too?

993
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:03,712
- I came back here only to get Kolchin.
- But I thought...

994
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:06,423
We saw this strange car here,
don't you see?

995
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:10,094
We thought something happened
to Annie, our daughter.

996
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,237
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to...

997
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:17,852
I was trying to kill you,
I'll admit that, but it wasn't...

998
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,577
I mean, it wasn't anything personal.

999
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,945
- Don't do it no more.
- I promise, I won't.

1000
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,505
The last time I'll shoot anybody.

1001
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:32,882
Peace.

1002
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:46,813
You're wasting ammunition.
Knock it off. Cease fire.

1003
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:50,316
It's no use.

1004
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,596
You're wasting your ammunition.

1005
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:54,972
We gotta head them off.

1006
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:57,573
I tried to tell you, let's get the boat.

1007
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:00,201
You tried to tell me nothing.

1008
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,462
I finally got you.

1009
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:24,001
We chased them out here.
They're going around the island.

1010
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,004
Get in. Come on, Charlie, put that away.
We gotta get started.

1011
01:40:27,104 --> 01:40:30,215
- Wait a minute. Hold it.
- Get out of the way, Fendall.

1012
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:35,095
Listen, Mattocks, I'm warning you.
This whole operation has been a foul-up.

1013
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,847
- And it's your fault.
- What?

1014
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:40,184
You brought us out here,
and you let them get away.

1015
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:43,187
- I'm warning you.
- You're warning me?

1016
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,747
You big, incompetent flatfoot.

1017
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:50,152
That does it. That did it.
I'll punch him in the jaw.

1018
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:51,794
I'm holding you responsible.

1019
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:58,577
As commander of the civilian
forces in this emergency,

1020
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,595
I'm charging you with treason.

1021
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:06,350
Give me that thing.

1022
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:11,856
You see that?

1023
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:25,286
That's the Dexter F.
Meadows Memorial Sword.

1024
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,207
Yeah.

1025
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:32,126
You traitorous fink!

1026
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:42,538
For God's sake, why is it we
can't learn to live together?

1027
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:44,180
You're right, Norman.

1028
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:48,059
Let's get organized here.

1029
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:55,069
You can do it, beauty.
Steady there. Come on.

1030
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:57,378
Now we're going. Now we're swinging.

1031
01:42:57,754 --> 01:43:00,324
We ought to call the Coast Guard
and the Navy.

1032
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:01,867
This thing's too big for us.

1033
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:05,412
If it was a sub, it'd be clear
out to sea by now, Chief.

1034
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:07,498
We've still gotta call them.

1035
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,167
But the phones are out. They're all out.

1036
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:14,520
- Then we'll radio.
- Ed Spooner's got a radio in his store.

1037
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,067
Whittaker Walt, this is very bad.

1038
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:38,195
This captain has bad temper.
These people should get away!

1039
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:39,670
What am I supposed to do?

1040
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:13,287
Tommy, let's go up to the steeple
and see what's going on.

1041
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,500
It's impossible.

1042
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,211
Alison Palmer, listen.
This is dangerous situation.

1043
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:38,922
- The boat never reached him.
- He wants all men on board.

1044
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:41,425
- He thinks men have been captured.
- Men are missing.

1045
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,818
In three minutes,
he's going to destroy this town.

1046
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:47,029
Tell him. He can't just...

1047
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:50,241
Captain, sir.

1048
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:57,774
Walt Whittaker.
And he's telling the truth.

1049
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:00,918
You're making a mistake.
You can't go around shooting here.

1050
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:07,425
- He wants to know if you're an official.
- No. I'm a writer.

1051
01:45:11,638 --> 01:45:13,055
What do you write?

1052
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:18,019
- He writes musical comedy.
- I'm working on a musical.

1053
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:45,155
Listen, you can't.

1054
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:48,116
Don't you realize you could start a war?
You can't do that.

1055
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:50,551
- Stop, you'll make him mad.
- So what?

1056
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:54,930
Listen. You just... Have you gone crazy?

1057
01:45:55,265 --> 01:45:58,585
You get out of here. Tell him.

1058
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:00,128
Reason with him. Talk to him.

1059
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:02,938
- Honey, think of something.
- What am I gonna do?

1060
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,868
Their submarine's in the port.

1061
01:46:31,968 --> 01:46:36,138
- What's happening?
- I think I can tell you what happened.

1062
01:46:39,017 --> 01:46:41,310
What's going on here?

1063
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,755
One at a time, now.

1064
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:47,217
The sub got free by itself.
That captain there thinks that somebody...

1065
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:50,304
That captain there,
he thinks somebody's holding his men.

1066
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:54,224
Unless somebody produces them, he says,
he's gonna open fire on the town.

1067
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:57,618
- He does, does he? That right?
- That's what he says.

1068
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:04,401
- Who's that one?
- He's all right.

1069
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,361
- What?
- I mean, he's with me.

1070
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:08,363
- What do you mean?
- He's been to my house.

1071
01:47:08,463 --> 01:47:09,672
To your what?

1072
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:16,512
What did he say?

1073
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:19,390
He says that you have one minute.

1074
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:33,362
- I have one minute for what?
- Before he begins shooting.

1075
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:50,296
It looks like we got a situation here.
That's what it looks like to me.

1076
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:56,260
All right, you tell the captain
he's under arrest.

1077
01:47:59,055 --> 01:48:01,724
Tell the captain he's under arrest.

1078
01:48:29,794 --> 01:48:32,505
Norman, get the women
and kids out of here.

1079
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:49,146
He says...

1080
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:51,675
- He is angry, yes?
- Yeah.

1081
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:53,150
He says,

1082
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,280
you stupid idiot,
he will blow up the town.

1083
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:04,453
I'm going over to Ed Spooner's.
I'll radio the Air Command.

1084
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,705
Look out.

1085
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,384
All right.

1086
01:49:19,302 --> 01:49:21,303
Let's have your name and address.

1087
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:00,009
You.

1088
01:50:03,346 --> 01:50:05,848
Tell him this, and get it straight.

1089
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:10,644
He's under arrest.

1090
01:50:18,486 --> 01:50:20,154
You're all under arrest.

1091
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:27,077
You come in here,
scaring people half to death.

1092
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:32,499
You steal cars and motorboats.

1093
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:39,048
You cause damage to private property.

1094
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,622
Then you threaten
the whole community with

1095
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,765
grievous bodily harm and maybe murder.

1096
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:53,687
Now, we ain't gonna take
no more of that. See?

1097
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:00,527
We may be scared.

1098
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:06,617
I am, anyway.

1099
01:51:15,293 --> 01:51:18,462
But maybe we ain't so scared
as you think we are.

1100
01:51:24,969 --> 01:51:27,763
Now, you say you're
gonna blow up the town?

1101
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:33,811
Well, I say

1102
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:37,231
all right.

1103
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:40,776
You start shooting and see what happens.

1104
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:15,704
Watch out!

1105
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:19,166
Mommy! Daddy! Help him!

1106
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:45,635
Hang on, Jerry!

1107
01:53:45,735 --> 01:53:46,944
Get something to catch him in.

1108
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,471
Get the fire truck.

1109
01:53:48,571 --> 01:53:50,640
No, it'd take too long. We need a rope.

1110
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:52,642
- Get a ladder.
- We make ladder.

1111
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:54,993
We make ladder of men.

1112
01:53:57,413 --> 01:53:59,107
What are we going to do?

1113
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:01,609
Please, Mommy!

1114
01:54:01,709 --> 01:54:04,419
They're coming to get you, baby,
it's all right.

1115
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:08,658
Okay, get up.

1116
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:10,509
You get on my shoulders.

1117
01:54:25,775 --> 01:54:27,234
Walt, hang on, honey.

1118
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:31,947
Push it. Hold it.

1119
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:34,116
Some more people, please.

1120
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:36,577
Please don't move.

1121
01:54:51,634 --> 01:54:52,801
Careful!

1122
01:54:53,344 --> 01:54:55,596
Too slippery. We need more men.

1123
01:55:01,769 --> 01:55:03,478
Help. Get me down.

1124
01:55:09,527 --> 01:55:12,654
Mommy, Daddy, help me.

1125
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:46,063
Get up, boy. Hold on. Tight.

1126
01:56:00,536 --> 01:56:01,954
Take boy.

1127
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,599
- You okay, Norman?
- I'm fine.

1128
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:39,032
My shoulder hurts a bit, but...

1129
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:42,202
We got the kid, didn't we?

1130
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:55,658
Look out. Let me through here.

1131
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:57,634
Get out of the way!

1132
01:57:04,267 --> 01:57:05,976
Quiet!

1133
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:10,814
Listen to me. Quiet!

1134
01:57:11,357 --> 01:57:12,675
I got them!

1135
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:17,279
I got the Air Force, and they're calling
the Coast Guard and the Navy.

1136
01:57:17,947 --> 01:57:20,850
The whole bunch will be here
inside of five minutes.

1137
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:23,910
Now you're gonna see something.

1138
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,749
Say, what is this?

1139
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,278
Didn't you hear what I just said?

1140
01:57:32,378 --> 01:57:35,990
I got through to them
on Ed Spooner's radio.

1141
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:37,883
They're on their way.

1142
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:42,497
You better get going.

1143
01:57:42,597 --> 01:57:43,873
It's not possible.

1144
01:57:43,973 --> 01:57:46,475
It's not enough time.
I still have seven men on the boat.

1145
01:57:46,934 --> 01:57:48,477
It's not possible.

1146
01:57:52,356 --> 01:57:53,648
It isn't fair.

1147
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:01,656
Think of something.

1148
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:12,834
We could give them an escort.

1149
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:18,006
I mean, we could use all the
little boats out in the harbor.

1150
01:58:19,967 --> 01:58:21,301
A convoy.

1151
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:23,386
An escort?

1152
01:58:24,013 --> 01:58:25,430
Could we do that, Link?

1153
01:58:26,015 --> 01:58:28,600
Go out with them.
Take them out of the harbor.

1154
01:58:30,686 --> 01:58:33,021
Can we help them get away, Dad, can we?

1155
01:58:34,482 --> 01:58:37,468
Anybody wants to go with them,
I ain't gonna stop them.

1156
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,777
What?

1157
01:58:53,626 --> 01:58:55,335
Charlie, get over here, will you?

1158
01:59:02,135 --> 01:59:03,619
I must go.

1159
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:06,721
But I promise my word to you
that I see you again.

1160
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:10,559
All right, get that thing out of here.
Come on.

1161
01:59:10,726 --> 01:59:12,227
Move it out.

1162
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:16,758
You and I, Alison Palmer,

1163
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:20,902
we have, somehow,
a long life of peaceful coexistence.

1164
02:01:00,336 --> 02:01:05,340
Hey, can you drive a big boat like this?
Turn boat around quickly.

1165
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,859
Be careful and jump.

1166
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:05,942
There they are.

1167
02:02:22,793 --> 02:02:26,030
- Tiny Tim control. Juliet Papa 3-8.
- Roger, 3-8.

1168
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:29,492
It's a Russian, running on the surface.
Heading zero, niner, zero.

1169
02:02:29,592 --> 02:02:31,494
Must be the same one
the Navy had alert on.

1170
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:34,163
- Listen, the Russians are being escorted.
- Say again?

1171
02:02:34,263 --> 02:02:37,500
She's got an escort. There are
15 or 20 small boats down there.

1172
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,169
There are 100 or more people
on those boats.

1173
02:02:40,269 --> 02:02:41,603
Request instructions.

1174
02:03:16,138 --> 02:03:18,708
Juliet Papa 3-8.
Recalled and return to base.

1175
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:22,003
We'll find out what it was about later.
Somebody ought to know.

1176
02:03:22,103 --> 02:03:24,479
Roger. How about that, Charlie Brown?

1177
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:34,280
They didn't do anything!

1178
02:04:46,228 --> 02:04:49,022
The Russians are coming!
