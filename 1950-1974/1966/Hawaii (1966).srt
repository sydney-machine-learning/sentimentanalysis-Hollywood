1
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,445
Ever since our island people
could remember,

2
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:57,715
Bora Bora
had been the home of the gods.

3
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,216
Home of Kanaloa,
King of the Underworld...

4
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,394
of Pele,
the little mother of volcanoes...

5
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:12,965
of Ta'aora, god of the ocean waters,
god of the winds and the storms,

6
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,372
of Mano the shark, who guided his children
through secret pathways of the sea

7
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,943
when they were lost,

8
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:22,945
and of great Kane,
father of the universe

9
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:25,811
and all that lived therein.

10
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:30,980
And so it remained
until in the days of Kanakoa the King

11
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:33,318
there came upon the people of this island

12
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:37,224
the most terrible anguish
that can afflict the spirit of man...

13
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:40,695
a time when the gods
began to change.

14
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:43,961
For in that day there arose a new god

15
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:49,973
whose appetite for human sacrifice
heaped the altars high with his dead...

16
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:54,875
Oro. Oro whose eyes
were the eyes of death.

17
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,143
So King Kanakoa
called together his people and said,

18
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,381
"This new god, this Oro,
is a god of vengeance and wrath.

19
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:06,479
Let us run away from him."

20
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,059
The State Canoe of Bora Bora
was the swiftest vessel

21
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:16,224
in all the oceans of the world.

22
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:20,100
They filled it with roots and seeds
to plant in a new land

23
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:24,140
which, legend told them,
lay far to the north.

24
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:28,610
From its holy place
they took the sacred stone,

25
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:31,079
the image of gentle Kane,

26
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:33,616
and guided by Mano the shark,

27
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:38,314
set out through uncharted seas
towards the unknown,

28
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,585
until at last they approached
the shores of a land

29
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:48,188
never seen before by the eyes of men,
the glowing land that was Hawaii.

30
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,991
For over 30 generations
they lived in that land,

31
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,254
remote from the rest of the world,

32
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:03,095
content in the worship of Kane,
until you came,

33
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,397
and my people found themselves
once more in a time

34
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:08,233
when the gods were changing.

35
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:14,943
You who have trained
for your ministries here at Yale College,

36
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:18,071
and only yesterday
received your diplomas,

37
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:22,278
cannot begin to imagine
what that can do to the human soul.

38
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:26,515
Even the Reverend Dr. Thorn
finds it unbelievable

39
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:31,721
that only 43 years ago, when the English
Captain Cook arrived in Hawaii,

40
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,993
my brothers stood for the first time
face to face with a Christian world

41
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,069
whose existence
they had never even dreamt of.

42
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:44,664
We beheld your weapons,
your tall ships,

43
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,175
your way with books and numbers,

44
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,475
and we could not doubt the greatness
of your Christian God.

45
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,450
In less than one generation
we leveled our temples,

46
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:58,715
burnt our pagan idols,

47
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:04,125
and stood like waiting children for
the revelation you promised to send us.

48
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:10,496
But instead of sending God's words,
you sent adventurers to steal our lands...

49
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:14,469
pestilence to ravage our countrysides,

50
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:18,167
strong drink to devour
the manhood of our sons,

51
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:21,403
and devils in the shape of whalers
to despoil our daughters

52
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:24,276
and cast them aside
like little wounded animals...

53
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:29,418
to die in torment of that disease
for which we had no name

54
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,885
until you came.

55
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,655
We hunger for the word of God.

56
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:37,790
Yet in the four years
I've lived among you,

57
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:42,127
no one yet has said to me,
"Keoki Kanakoa,

58
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:46,567
I will go with you to Hawaii
to save the souls of your people."

59
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,831
I am coming, I am coming!

60
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,982
- It's past 3:00.
- I'm sorry, Reverend Thorn.

61
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:02,780
You said the lists were closing tonight,
and Brother Hale and I

62
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:06,379
- decided to volunteer for Hawaii.
- You have? Come on in.

63
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:11,322
Why did you not stand forth with
the others at a more appropriate hour?

64
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:15,364
I wasn't sure of my worthiness, sir.
I asked Brother Whipple to stay with me

65
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,592
and pray for God's direction.

66
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,964
I assume the Lord
has spoken to you again?

67
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,730
He has, sir.

68
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,635
When Prince Keoki spoke tonight,

69
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,005
I heard the voice of God
commanding me to go to Hawaii

70
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,839
and bring His word to the heathen.

71
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:30,106
It was clearer
than the personal revelation

72
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,342
I experienced when I was only 15,
that mystical...

73
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,439
Yes, I remember.

74
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,484
I am very pleased that you
are volunteering, Brother John.

75
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,750
I'd always thought that as a doctor

76
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:43,850
you were more interested
in medicine than in theology.

77
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:47,362
Tonight I realized I could serve God
in both capacities.

78
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,932
You should hear from the board
of commissioners within the week.

79
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:53,162
Thank you very much,
Reverend Thorn.

80
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,898
- I promise I will...
- Your case will take longer.

81
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,002
- Why?
- Your teachers tell me

82
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:01,634
that you were somewhat
proud of your sanctity.

83
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,203
The Lord God Jehovah
is not your uncle, Brother Hale.

84
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,613
He is your Creator.

85
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:10,084
But every day I repeat
the biblical injunction against pride.

86
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:14,385
- Proverbs 16:5: "Every one that is proud..."
- Yes, I...

87
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,083
I know the verse.

88
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:20,125
I presume that like most
of our young volunteers,

89
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,131
you are still confronted
with the problem of finding a wife.

90
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,963
No, sir. My cousin
has agreed to marry me.

91
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,766
- I don't understand.
- You must have a wife.

92
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:32,069
We do not send young men to live
among the naked savages without wives.

93
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:37,709
At your age, you probably have
some dedicated female in view.

94
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:38,839
No, sir.

95
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,512
I haven't.

96
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:50,216
No one at all?

97
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:52,553
No, sir.

98
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,498
I'll pray on the matter.

99
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,229
It will require more than prayer,
Brother Hale.

100
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:04,700
Sir, I beg you to accept me
on this mission.

101
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,833
I promise that if you bestow upon me

102
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:10,573
the holy privilege of saving
those poor souls in agony,

103
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:14,708
- it will be a commitment to the...
- You will be hearing from us.

104
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,582
Now, I really must insist
on bidding you good night.

105
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:20,088
I assure you,
I have heard this call clearly.

106
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,715
Yes, Brother,
you will be hearing from us.

107
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,877
No, no, no, no,
I simply will not have it.

108
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:50,385
The least you could have done was
consult with us before you wrote Jerusha.

109
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,682
It might not be a bad thing, Abigail.

110
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,122
Jerusha seems willing
to meet the boy, at least.

111
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:59,685
My dear sister, the fact is
you have a daughter who is 22,

112
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:03,233
and she grows more confused
and depressed each day.

113
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,766
That's not true!

114
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:08,963
It's only since Captain Hoxworth
she's had these... depressions.

115
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,199
But that's the point!

116
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:13,105
All this mooning around over
a damn sailor she hasn't heard from

117
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,041
in almost two years, it's unnatural.

118
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:18,478
But this Hawaii,
we don't even know where it is.

119
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:21,983
Charles, are you willing
to send your daughter...

120
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,919
My dear, the only thing I'm not willing
to do is abandon my child

121
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:28,685
to fits of depression and religious mania
in a small upstairs room!

122
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,161
If she can find love and a rich,
new life in Hawaii,

123
00:13:32,262 --> 00:13:34,560
It's a damn sight
better than she's doing here in Walpole,

124
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:38,101
wasting away over a sailor
who's long since forgotten her.

125
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,103
Abigail...

126
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,101
Shouldn't we give
the young man a chance?

127
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,507
If she doesn't like him,
she can send him away.

128
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,376
I promise.

129
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,662
Abner! A letter! A letter!

130
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,860
"Dear Brother Hale,
as a result of careful inquiries,

131
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:14,767
"the American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions

132
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,102
"is happy in the will of God to announce

133
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:20,699
"that you have been chosen
for mission duty in Hawaii.

134
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,678
"Your acceptance, however,
is provisional,

135
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,774
"since there remains the matter
of obtaining a wife to accompany you.

136
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:33,755
"To this end, you would be well advised
to present yourself in one month's time

137
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:38,760
"at the house of Charles and Abigail
Bromley in Walpole, New Hampshire,

138
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:43,094
"there to meet their daughter,
a Christian girl of 22.

139
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:48,096
"May I also take the liberty
of suggesting that in the interim

140
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:53,233
"you work in your father's fields
each day with your hat off.

141
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:57,211
Yours in Christ, Elifaleth Thorn."

142
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,249
Do you think
she will accept you, Abner?

143
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:02,685
If God wishes it.

144
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:05,651
Let us pray together.

145
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:12,184
Almighty God, look down with pity
on this miserable company of sinners,

146
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:16,027
conceived in lust, delivered in evil,

147
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:20,570
and slaves to every loathsome appetite
the flesh is heir to.

148
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:28,066
We have held fast against atheism,
Romanism, Unitarianism,

149
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,045
and a score of lesser evils.

150
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:34,743
And we thank Thee
that Thou has chosen one of us

151
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,447
to carry Thy holy word
and the precious light of John Calvin

152
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:43,253
to the wicked
and benighted heathen of Hawaii.

153
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,818
- Amen.
- Amen.

154
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,386
Welcome to Walpole.

155
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,822
I trust you had
a reasonably pleasant journey.

156
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:16,984
Yes, yes, indeed.

157
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:20,086
The Reverend Abner Hale,
Mr. Charles Bromley.

158
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,730
- I'm deeply honored.
- My pleasure, son.

159
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,825
Come on.
I want you to meet the family.

160
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:28,666
- Yes, but I had...
- I'll take care of your baggage.

161
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,206
- Fine.
- You're a lot browner and tougher

162
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:34,175
- than I expected you'd be.
- I always was tough, sir.

163
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,744
Reverend Thorn!

164
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:44,878
A packet of delayed mail
and a letter came for the Bromleys.

165
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:47,320
- Would you take them along?
- Thank you.

166
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,932
That's him, isn't it?

167
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,564
I think so.

168
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:10,008
- But he's so tall!
- It's not that he's tall, he's just so skinny!

169
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,946
He's not very handsome, either.
Do you think?

170
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,746
No. He's got an awfully big nose.

171
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,249
They're coming in. Come on.

172
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,190
- Don't push!
- Quiet!

173
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,791
Mommy doesn't look
as if she likes him.

174
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:28,330
Papa's using his funny voice.

175
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:30,559
Yes, how do you do, Reverend?

176
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,770
And this is my daughter, Miss Jerusha.

177
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,084
I'm pleased to make your
acquaintance, Reverend Hale.

178
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:03,456
Oh, dear!

179
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,464
Did I spray?

180
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,671
No, no, no, not at all.

181
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:23,644
Well, what did you think of him?

182
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,723
- I rather took to the lad myself.
- He is simply dreadful.

183
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:29,189
- Oh, Abigail.
- And what you are doing is shameful.

184
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:34,286
If she accepts that scrawny
weed of a man, it will be out of despair.

185
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:35,956
My dear sister.

186
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,365
We must leave it all
in the hands of the Lord.

187
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,175
Come in.

188
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,606
You have a very kind nature,
Miss Bromley.

189
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,683
Thank you, Reverend Hale.

190
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:58,448
But then, I have always admired
the character of Jerusha

191
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,352
as set forth in Holy Scripture.

192
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:06,454
I think particularly on 2 Kings 15:33.

193
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,897
"Five and twenty years old
was Jotham when he began to reign,

194
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:14,493
"and he reigned 16 years
in Jerusalem.

195
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:20,201
And his mother's name was Jerusha,
the daughter of Zadok."

196
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,404
- It's a lovely verse.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

197
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:24,673
Thank you.

198
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,242
Thank you.

199
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:30,216
I often think...

200
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:34,624
Save the soup!

201
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:48,493
Oh, my raggedy, taggedy,
little old scraggedy wishing doll

202
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:53,133
I'd see two fleecy clouds caress

203
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:56,644
And they become
a snow white party dress

204
00:19:56,746 --> 00:20:00,307
For my wishing doll

205
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:04,047
And every rainbow way up there

206
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:11,856
Becomes a silken ribbon for the hair
of my wishing doll

207
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,192
And then one day...

208
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:18,258
Reverend Hale.

209
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:22,967
Are you feeling better?

210
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,776
Oh, very much better, thank you.

211
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,377
Will you stay a week
if it takes that long?

212
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,451
- What takes?
- If you don't ask her, the captain will.

213
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,213
Charity...

214
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,617
All right.

215
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:57,930
Only this morning as I awakened
and looked out the window,

216
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,168
I thought with...

217
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:05,178
with Virgil,
"Here is Spring eternal!"

218
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,912
Will you have sugar?

219
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,078
If you please.

220
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,745
Or...

221
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:18,184
Or with Theocritus,
"It is Spring everywhere,

222
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:21,560
"and in the pastures
the udders are swelling with milk

223
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:23,724
and the lambkins are suckling."

224
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:29,362
- Cream, Reverend Hale?
- Thank you.

225
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,876
One is also reminded
of the divine Milton...

226
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,909
Let... let... let me...

227
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,887
I have no graces.

228
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,859
I'm strange and awkward in... in...

229
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,461
worldly surroundings.

230
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,800
But until now I've always
thought myself at least an honest man.

231
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,632
I have no taste for poetry.

232
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:09,007
I memorized those lines
to make you think better of me.

233
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:14,342
I even... Iooked up your name
in my Bible concordance.

234
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,232
My little sister's remark
about a certain captain...

235
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:34,299
I think I should tell you that
two years ago I fell in love

236
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,929
with a New Bedford man
who came here on a visit.

237
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,634
However, we've not
corresponded since that time.

238
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:42,111
I'm now quite free.

239
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:48,884
He was a whaler, a strong man,
somewhat rough in his ways.

240
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,147
Yet also gentle.

241
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,923
And very handsome.

242
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,491
Miss Bromley...

243
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,592
You will find someone else.

244
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:13,602
When that happens, I pray he'll be
the strongest, gentlest man on Earth.

245
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,812
And the handsomest, too.

246
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,983
I'll be going home tomorrow.

247
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:34,088
I cannot think it right
for a young woman of your breeding

248
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:40,500
to travel across 18,000 miles
of stormy seas to a savage land...

249
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:44,095
I know all about Hawaii.
Prince Keoki lectured at our church.

250
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,764
It is horrible.

251
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:50,369
My life will be one of work,
poverty, bad food...

252
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:55,844
living in a grass hut
surrounded by filth and savages.

253
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,856
Why do you try to make Hawaii
seem even worse than it is?

254
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:10,194
Because I will not spoil your life,
Miss Bromley.

255
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,964
You are so beautiful,
and I am of such little consequence,

256
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:18,563
that I put the idea of marriage
completely out of mind

257
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:20,438
the moment I saw you.

258
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,503
Am I so little to you, then?

259
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,280
You are more to me
than anyone can know.

260
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:32,911
My feelings for you
are of such a deep and tender nature,

261
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:35,684
so profoundly affectionate,
that l... I...

262
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,020
I dare not mention them.

263
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,628
But you have dared.

264
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:43,455
And in doing so
you have dishonored me.

265
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,465
But, Miss Bromley!

266
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:51,432
How?

267
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,343
No gentleman would explain his feelings
so explicitly to a lady

268
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:58,005
without previous
proposal of marriage.

269
00:24:58,114 --> 00:24:59,138
But I...

270
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,680
You wouldn't think
of going to Hawaii with a man like me.

271
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:05,914
Would you?

272
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,519
Not if he wasn't my husband.

273
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,387
Goodness!
I certainly didn't mean to imply that!

274
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,664
I would protect you...

275
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:26,970
and cherish you...

276
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:30,875
and love you all the years of my life...

277
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:35,141
if only you could find it in your heart

278
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:38,049
to... marry me.

279
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:42,252
It is in my heart.

280
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:50,499
"There is a prince and a great man
fallen this day in Israel."

281
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:54,126
I looked your name up, too.

282
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:59,106
- Mom, he did it!
- Mom!

283
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,478
You have set forth
as one family in Christ.

284
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:19,225
Everything you possess,
both now and in the future,

285
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,524
belongs to that family.

286
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:24,632
You will receive no salaries,

287
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:29,034
neither will you engage
in any enterprise for personal gain.

288
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:34,908
I have no doubt that you would do
conspicuously well in business,

289
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,572
but you have been called
to serve the Lord,

290
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:43,948
and it is to this business
that you must attend.

291
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:48,888
You are directed to accomplish
two divine missions...

292
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:53,929
to bring the heathen to the Lord
and civilize him.

293
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:00,128
You will lift up the heathen,
step by step, until he stands with you,

294
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:06,300
and before you leave the scene,
the pulpits you erect will be filled by him.

295
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,377
You are to spend yourselves
in Christ so generously

296
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:16,043
that in later years
it may be said of you,

297
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:20,020
"They came to a nation in darkness,

298
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:23,024
they left it in light."

299
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,298
Ready, Captain Janders.

300
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,372
Reverend Thorn.
Land the gangplank!

301
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:39,032
- Let go forward.
- Let go forward, sir!

302
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,700
Let go aft!

303
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,175
Let go aft, sir!

304
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,874
Blest be the tie that binds

305
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:52,319
Our hearts in Christian love

306
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:59,521
The fellowship of kindred minds

307
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:04,657
Is like to that above

308
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,010
And you must submit your will
entirely to God's keeping.

309
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,847
You are correct on that, Reverend.

310
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,717
If you're ready,
I'll be proud to count you the first.

311
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:30,054
I'm not half ready, Reverend.
I love to hear you nag.

312
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,923
We haven't had such a fine gab
in many a passage.

313
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:34,962
He's at it again, Captain.

314
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,387
Reverend Hale!

315
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,963
I thought I told you to leave
those men alone.

316
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:46,607
You forbade me to enter the forecastle.

317
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:50,941
But you did not forbid me to bring them
the word of God while they are at work.

318
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,140
What word were you bringing
to young Cridland?

319
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,080
He kept the whole watch
awake last night

320
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:57,982
hollering in his sleep about
hell fire and damnation.

321
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,681
I reminded him briefly of his sins

322
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,452
and read certain passages
from the Holy Bible.

323
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,791
To an ignorant man,
the Bible can be a terrifying book.

324
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:11,832
More than the profane novels
I observe in your cabin?

325
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:16,894
Do you think that Smollet and Defoe
and Voltaire are profane?

326
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,702
- They are damnable.
- Have you read them?

327
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:22,837
Must I commit murder
to judge it a sin?

328
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:31,509
Why is it with so many
attractive young people on board,

329
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:35,318
it's always that mangy scarecrow
that's well enough to eat with us?

330
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,567
Raise your spirits,
my dear friends.

331
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:53,665
We are a full degree
nearer the equator.

332
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:56,370
When will this dreadful rocking cease?

333
00:29:56,479 --> 00:30:00,438
Come, Brother Quigley.
You'll have your sea legs soon.

334
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,881
Perhaps you'd care to shave.

335
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,509
I can fetch you some hot water
from the galley.

336
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,214
I don't know what we'd do
without your comfort.

337
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:09,518
We are a family in Christ,
my dear sister.

338
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:22,694
Would it compose you
if I were to read to you?

339
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,432
Sister Urania?

340
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:35,681
Abner, no good cheer, I beg you.

341
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:37,252
Why, Brother John.

342
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:42,086
I should think you, as a doctor, would be
the first to prescribe a cheerful face.

343
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:45,786
As a doctor, Brother Abner,
I accept the truth.

344
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:50,923
And the truth in this case
is that we are, all of us, except you,

345
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,864
fit only for pickling.

346
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:59,906
- Mrs. Hale?
- Reverend Hale, I'm so sick.

347
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:04,569
You must pray.
And try to swallow back more firmly.

348
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,615
- I do try.
- I know.

349
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:09,514
It's Sunday again.

350
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:13,517
Forgive me.

351
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:16,520
You must be ready for services.

352
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:21,427
I can't even raise my arm.

353
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,956
I'll pray while you attend services.

354
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:27,558
God's word will give you strength.

355
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,571
Also the excellent pork and sea-pie
we are having for dinner.

356
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:46,544
"Hear, O earth: Behold,

357
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:52,060
"I will bring evil on these people, because
they have not hearkened unto my words,

358
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,289
nor my law, but rejected it.

359
00:31:55,932 --> 00:32:00,528
I have seen thine adulteries
and neighings."

360
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:06,874
The Lord has marked your presence,
Brother Quigley.

361
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:09,444
You may go below to say prayers
with Sister Hale.

362
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:18,446
"I have seen thine adulteries...

363
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,648
"and neighings...

364
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:26,861
the lewdness of thy whoredom..."

365
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:28,555
That sounds like fun, don't it?!

366
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,526
God will punish you for that!

367
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,566
God will punish you for that!

368
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,674
Perhaps at Cape Horn.

369
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,640
We will soon be at the cape.

370
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:44,144
Is it there
that the day of reckoning will come

371
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,647
for those who refuse
to heed God's word?

372
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:50,150
Will tides as high
as mountains engulf you

373
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:54,519
and seawater fill your nostrils
and your lungs?

374
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,394
Will your eyes drop from their sockets
at the bottom of the sea?

375
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:11,732
Captain Janders,
since you have permitted blasphemy,

376
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:13,832
I will dispense with the benediction.

377
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,944
We will spend the rest of our Sabbath
in the main cabin,

378
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:22,415
where Keoki will continue his instructions
in the Hawaiian language.

379
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:30,022
Dutchmen and Spaniards
have done it.

380
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:32,492
Some of our own whalers
have managed to get through.

381
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:33,755
Why is it so difficult?

382
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:36,491
It isn't, until the end.
See those rocks?

383
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,725
The Four Evangelists?

384
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,768
The Westerlies from the Pacific
pile up tremendous waves

385
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,770
all the way along the exit
from the passage.

386
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:46,137
In trying to break out,
they throw you onto the Evangels.

387
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:02,751
Captain Janders!

388
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:07,557
The Evangels are two points off
the starboard bow!

389
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:19,871
Mr. Collins,
we're having a go at it!

390
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,272
Aye-aye, sir!

391
00:34:21,377 --> 00:34:24,107
- Steady as she goes.
- Aye-aye, sir.

392
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:55,905
Help! Reverend Hale!
Your wife!

393
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,035
Mrs. Hale!

394
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:00,080
- Mrs. Hale.
- We're lost!

395
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:03,207
Let me die.
Please let me die!

396
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:05,412
- What are you saying?
- God, let me die!

397
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:06,818
- Mrs. Hale!
- Let me die!

398
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:09,322
- You must not blaspheme!
- Please let me die!

399
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:15,363
I'm afraid, too, my dear wife.
We must not despair.

400
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:17,159
God is with this ship.

401
00:36:04,947 --> 00:36:07,677
She's slipping, sir!

402
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:10,752
The Evangels are dead ahead!

403
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:14,418
Send the gaff topsail!

404
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:17,287
Loose the gaff topsail!

405
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:02,867
Haul away!

406
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:05,734
Haul away!

407
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,480
Keoki!

408
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,020
Help him, God.

409
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:05,356
Help that man.

410
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,848
Help that man!

411
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,518
Strengthen his hands!

412
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:49,971
- Haul away!
- Haul away!

413
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,400
He is with us.

414
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:25,737
He's with us!

415
00:39:46,902 --> 00:39:51,100
The Lord of hosts is with us!

416
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,004
He is with us!

417
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,879
- Are you sleepy?
- No.

418
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,391
Forgive me.

419
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,516
I'm not sleepy.

420
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:14,661
I'm just relaxed.

421
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,098
I felt so good after my bath, I...

422
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:22,227
brushed my skin with oil of lilac.

423
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,366
I smelled it.

424
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:28,134
Moses forbade the use of perfume.

425
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,941
Proverbs say that
"Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart."

426
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:41,082
Isaiah cursed the woman who used
perfume and abased herself unto hell.

427
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:46,292
Esther perfumed herself
for a whole year.

428
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:47,953
She was under compulsion.

429
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:50,429
I think she just liked
the smell of it on her skin.

430
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,695
Skin is but flesh,
flesh is corruption incarnate.

431
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:59,501
- The flesh was given us by God, too.
- As a burden, as a temptation.

432
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:05,737
The temptation you are to me
at this very moment.

433
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,881
That's one of the purposes
of marriage, isn't it?

434
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:15,351
Not when it drives the thought
of God from the mind.

435
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:17,618
I begin to feel that...

436
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,626
that I'm utterly depraved.

437
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,031
I think of nothing but your loveliness.

438
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:30,762
Is it possible for anything to seem lovely
without God having wanted it so?

439
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:04,724
Get away this ship.
We got too much preacher-man here.

440
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,860
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

441
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:16,028
He says his daughters
are the best...

442
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:20,737
Are they his own daughters?

443
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,233
Look!

444
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:26,678
Look there!
There they are!

445
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,372
- Who are they?
- Keoki's parents.

446
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:30,206
Lahaina, here,
is the capital of the island of Maui,

447
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,281
and Keoki's father, Kelolo,
is the king's deputy here.

448
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:37,318
His mother is Malama,
and Alii Nui of all the islands.

449
00:45:37,419 --> 00:45:38,511
Where does the king live?

450
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,180
In Honolulu, on the island of Oahu.
Break out the sling!

451
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,073
Why did you kneel to your mother?

452
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,773
She is the Alii Nui.
She is a sacred person.

453
00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:08,747
It's from her our mana flows.

454
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,976
It is from God,

455
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:13,680
not from any Alii Nui that you receive
your spiritual consecration.

456
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:17,247
I understand, and so will they when
they become Christians, Brother Hale.

457
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,988
- I was referring to the old religion.
- I think it would be better

458
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:25,465
if from now on you referred to me
in the old way, as Reverend Hale.

459
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:27,501
Abner!

460
00:46:27,602 --> 00:46:30,400
We agreed as a family
that we're all brothers and sisters.

461
00:46:30,505 --> 00:46:33,702
That applied only to ordained ministers
and their wives.

462
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,744
Ordained or not,
I shall always be your sister Jerusha.

463
00:46:46,288 --> 00:46:47,755
Hoist away!

464
00:46:56,932 --> 00:47:00,424
Aloha, aloha!

465
00:47:10,612 --> 00:47:12,512
Aloha!

466
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:18,276
Gently, gently.
Don't drop her or we'll all be massacred.

467
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:48,746
Aloha! Aloha!

468
00:47:58,593 --> 00:48:00,891
My mother, Malama, says welcome.

469
00:48:00,996 --> 00:48:03,487
These are the first lhaole women
she has ever seen.

470
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:07,326
Haole is our word
for people of the white race.

471
00:48:09,437 --> 00:48:13,032
She says that until now you have sent
only sailors and troublemakers.

472
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:18,710
But since you bring your women,
your intentions must be good.

473
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,304
Please express our thanks
to the Alii Nui.

474
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:23,179
Tell her that in order to help her people

475
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:25,719
we intend to establish missionaries
throughout these islands.

476
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,948
I know little bit English already.

477
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:31,582
How you meaning help my people?

478
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:34,787
- Help them to know God.
- And reading, too, and writing.

479
00:48:34,896 --> 00:48:38,992
Writing?
This is good. It is our need.

480
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,160
In one month time,
I learn plenty writing.

481
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,067
But first you must learn about God,

482
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,834
without Whose grace
all writing is useless.

483
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:52,478
First write.
Then maybe I listen your god.

484
00:49:05,293 --> 00:49:07,761
She says you are adorable,
puny women.

485
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,559
Will you tell her that
she and your father are very handsome?

486
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,396
And that Lahaina
seems as lovely as New England,

487
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:15,935
though in quite a different way.

488
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:19,268
Alolha nui! Alolha nui!

489
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,808
Alolha nui means love intense.

490
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,778
I like you here.
You stay Lahaina.

491
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,814
She teach me write.

492
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:30,146
Alii Nui.
I'm not assigned to your island.

493
00:49:30,252 --> 00:49:31,685
My mission is in Honolulu.

494
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:36,251
Where you go, I not care.
Her stay here.

495
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:39,484
But Mrs. Hale is my wife.

496
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:42,496
- She your wife?
- Yes.

497
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:46,698
I let you stay, too. You come now.

498
00:49:47,802 --> 00:49:51,738
We can trade, Brother Hale.
Jephtha and I can go on to Honolulu.

499
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,206
You and Sister Hale
can stay here in Lahaina.

500
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:58,268
Her got plenty much mana.
Her one time wife with Kamehameha.

501
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,473
Kamehameha had 21 wives.

502
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:04,177
My mother is Alii Nui. So she's
entitled to other husbands as well.

503
00:50:04,786 --> 00:50:05,753
You mean...

504
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:09,221
she was married to Kamehameha
and your father at the same time?

505
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:12,760
She had to marry my father
because he is her brother.

506
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:15,421
The Alii Nui may only have children
by her brother,

507
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,124
otherwise her mana
would be profaned by outside blood.

508
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:22,034
Water!
Please bring water, somebody!

509
00:50:53,368 --> 00:50:56,804
Reverend! Reverend!
Reverend?

510
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:59,567
My name is Fredericks,
I have a little grog shop here

511
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:01,266
and a few acres of farm land.

512
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,139
I hope we are going to be friends.

513
00:51:03,244 --> 00:51:04,575
Grog shop?

514
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,241
We'll discuss friendship when you stop
debauching my people with drink.

515
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:21,123
Just one moment.
Just one moment, please.

516
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:23,626
I will not permit us to be separated.

517
00:51:51,826 --> 00:51:53,623
Now, teach me write.

518
00:51:55,163 --> 00:51:57,961
Sit here, start teach.

519
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:01,463
Perhaps we should begin tomorrow.

520
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:03,298
We begin now!

521
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,868
Well, I...

522
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,646
In English, we have 26 letters.

523
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:26,455
- But in Hawaiian...
- I need write letter you people, not mine.

524
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,051
Teach English.

525
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:29,821
English.

526
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,534
Well, we'll start with your name.

527
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:35,797
Malama.

528
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:39,070
M...

529
00:52:46,514 --> 00:52:49,540
It is our family shrine.
We call it "heiau."

530
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:52,283
It's for the Great Chiefs only.

531
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:55,220
The center stone
comes from a temple in Bora Bora.

532
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:58,486
It was brought here by my people
over a thousand years ago.

533
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,220
Idolatry!

534
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:04,890
Reverend Hale!
Reverend Hale!

535
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,062
What is the meaning of this?

536
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:12,662
- I had to stop you, Reverend Hale.
- No touch!

537
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:16,835
It's an evil place drenched in blood.
It must be destroyed!

538
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,140
It is not that kind of a temple.

539
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:21,807
This is the temple of Kane,
a gentle god.

540
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:23,508
- A god of love and mercy.
- No touch!

541
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,219
This place is an abomination.

542
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:30,382
It is, but until he understands,
we can't ask him to destroy it.

543
00:54:05,093 --> 00:54:06,924
Who is that naked female?

544
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:09,758
Her my small, little daughter
named Noelani.

545
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:13,391
One day she grow big and be
the Alii Nui the time when Malama die.

546
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,991
Then she's Keoki's sister?

547
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,533
One day her marry with Keoki.
Together, they get keikewalhine.

548
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:24,305
Make one more Alii Nui.

549
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,775
Reverend Hale?
This is my sister Noelani.

550
00:54:29,884 --> 00:54:33,581
Do you realize that your father
expects you to marry this girl

551
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:34,916
and have children by her?

552
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:38,459
- I will explain this to her later...
- No, now, make it clear now.

553
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,494
I understand English,
Reverend Hale.

554
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:44,121
Then you must also understand
that your brother is a Christian

555
00:54:44,232 --> 00:54:47,861
and any lustful union between you
is a damnable sin

556
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:49,869
and must not take place.

557
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:04,708
I wish I had been given
a little more time to prepare her.

558
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:16,729
Could I go now
and come back tomorrow?

559
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:19,732
No! While we waste time,

560
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:23,531
lhaoles who know how to write
can steal this island.

561
00:55:23,638 --> 00:55:26,607
I'm sorry, I feel faint.

562
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:56,131
This one baby
not come for long time yet.

563
00:55:56,237 --> 00:55:59,900
Better you sleep.
I make you work too hard.

564
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:06,436
Rest, rest, rest.
Oh, rest.

565
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:13,078
Jerusha is not a strong woman.
She'll not bear up well under pain.

566
00:56:13,187 --> 00:56:14,745
I'll try to be here when the baby comes.

567
00:56:14,856 --> 00:56:17,950
If not, this is the best book
on midwifery in existence.

568
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,420
Keoki says the native midwives
are excellent, use them.

569
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,630
Good bye, Brother Hale.

570
00:57:44,846 --> 00:57:46,006
Well...

571
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:55,016
I guess we better...

572
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,436
- Abner.
- Yes.

573
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,507
Abner.

574
00:58:28,556 --> 00:58:30,046
What is your name?

575
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:35,758
Iliki.

576
00:58:36,631 --> 00:58:38,929
You may go home now, Iliki.

577
00:58:53,648 --> 00:58:55,206
Apparently she's been...

578
00:58:55,983 --> 00:58:59,248
given to us by that woman.

579
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:03,988
Do you suppose they actually
give children away?

580
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:08,125
I'll ask her tomorrow.

581
00:59:10,865 --> 00:59:12,423
You may stay here if you wish.

582
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:32,409
She's placed in our care
by the hand of God.

583
00:59:33,888 --> 00:59:36,322
She will become
the first member of my church.

584
00:59:39,594 --> 00:59:41,789
From the utter darkness,

585
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:44,990
I will lead her into the light.

586
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:55,499
I've already waited three weeks!

587
00:59:56,143 --> 00:59:57,474
I must see her.

588
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,251
- What is it?
- This baby, she was gonna bury it alive!

589
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:12,588
Let us through,
please, let us through.

590
01:00:16,831 --> 01:00:18,924
This baby got evil spirit.

591
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:22,594
It isn't an evil spirit,
it's only a birthmark. Look!

592
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:24,728
And see how fat and healthy he is!

593
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:27,034
Bad thing.
More better he die quick.

594
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:30,110
Does this killing of innocent children
go on all the time?

595
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:33,009
Only sometime
they little bit sick, like this one.

596
01:00:33,114 --> 01:00:37,278
If such children are not wanted,
we will establish a home for them.

597
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:39,182
They must not be killed!

598
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,687
A wise Alii Nui
would make that a law.

599
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:44,087
Too much law make people mad.

600
01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:52,028
She not kill him, Hale walhine.
Only feed him.

601
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,170
We sit down, now.
Make another lesson.

602
01:01:05,279 --> 01:01:08,578
Alii Nui. If I may have a moment,
I've been trying...

603
01:01:08,683 --> 01:01:10,844
I learn English now.
Go away.

604
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:16,115
It would only take a moment, Alii Nui.
He wants to talk about some land.

605
01:01:16,223 --> 01:01:21,160
- Land? You want land?
- Yes, I must have land in order to...

606
01:01:22,563 --> 01:01:23,894
I beg your pardon?

607
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:26,398
No land! No like it!

608
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,699
Every lhaole come here want land.
You go now.

609
01:01:31,806 --> 01:01:32,773
Teach.

610
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:36,740
- If you will only permit me...
- No! Go away!

611
01:01:53,995 --> 01:01:56,259
He doesn't want the land for himself.

612
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,832
And he doesn't want
very much land, either.

613
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:01,925
Just enough to build a church on.

614
01:02:02,036 --> 01:02:08,236
- You like it, him build this church?
- Yes, I would like it very much.

615
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:13,744
I tell Kelolo find little bit piece land,

616
01:02:13,848 --> 01:02:17,750
give men,
help build him his church.

617
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:19,911
Now teach me.

618
01:02:53,587 --> 01:02:54,747
Makua Hale!

619
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:58,222
Makua Hale, the Kahunas say
you put door bad place.

620
01:02:58,325 --> 01:02:59,952
The Kahunas!

621
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:02,029
They come for help new kind god.

622
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:04,728
He's not a new god,
he's the only God!

623
01:03:04,832 --> 01:03:07,357
And the Kahunas have nothing to do
with His church.

624
01:03:07,468 --> 01:03:11,370
They say more better no make wall.
Keep every side open.

625
01:03:11,472 --> 01:03:13,736
This make strong
when whistling wind come.

626
01:03:13,841 --> 01:03:16,503
Whistling wind?
What are you talking about?

627
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,669
The kind wind
come when Alii Nui die.

628
01:03:18,779 --> 01:03:20,110
Nonsense.

629
01:03:25,986 --> 01:03:30,753
Makua Hale, I know this place.
Many time I talk with the spirits live here.

630
01:03:30,858 --> 01:03:35,090
We will put the door where I say.
And there will be walls.

631
01:03:35,763 --> 01:03:37,924
Whoever heard
of a church without walls!

632
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:40,523
Makua Hale! Makua Hale!

633
01:03:40,634 --> 01:03:42,363
You come see!

634
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:46,167
I have something for show you.
You read.

635
01:03:48,442 --> 01:03:53,209
"To James Monroe,
President of America in Washington.

636
01:03:53,314 --> 01:03:59,048
"I send you 'AIoha'
from Lahaina on island of Maui.

637
01:03:59,153 --> 01:04:03,590
"Some men from America,
too much do they want land.

638
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:07,491
"Also too many sickness do they bring.

639
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:14,398
"I think you like do something about it.
I write this with great love.

640
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:17,938
Malama, Alii Nui."

641
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:25,602
It is a remarkable accomplishment,
Alii Nui.

642
01:04:25,713 --> 01:04:27,374
I think so.

643
01:04:28,249 --> 01:04:30,046
Little one.

644
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:33,643
For thanks
because you teach me write,

645
01:04:33,754 --> 01:04:36,382
I give you nice valley by Waiakoa.

646
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,358
- Got stream with fishes.
- No, you mustn't give away your land.

647
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:45,531
Makua Hale like land.

648
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:47,498
You have already given us this land,

649
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:50,365
to build a church for
Almighty God and His flock.

650
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:54,134
We are very grateful for that.
But for ourselves we want nothing.

651
01:04:59,113 --> 01:05:05,746
I think maybe this writing not enough.
Time now for teach me about your god.

652
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,921
I'm pleased that you want to learn.

653
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,088
Tomorrow we'll begin.

654
01:05:12,193 --> 01:05:13,990
We begin now!

655
01:05:32,947 --> 01:05:36,849
Tell me, this god,
how he look?

656
01:05:38,552 --> 01:05:40,281
God is a spirit.

657
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:45,083
He cannot be seen with the eyes.

658
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:49,390
He's seen only in the heart
of those who have found a state of grace.

659
01:05:49,496 --> 01:05:52,954
In one month time I find grace!

660
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:55,058
No, it cannot be done that way.

661
01:05:55,169 --> 01:05:59,765
To be saved you must first confess
that you are evil, corrupt, and sinful.

662
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:07,041
I evil, corrupt, sinful.
What is "sinful"? What it mean?

663
01:06:07,147 --> 01:06:10,048
- It means "bad."
- I bad?

664
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:15,383
No! They bad, not me!
I am Alii Nui. I cannot be bad.

665
01:06:15,489 --> 01:06:16,854
In the eyes of God,
there is no difference

666
01:06:16,957 --> 01:06:19,983
between the Alii Nui
and her meanest servant.

667
01:06:20,094 --> 01:06:23,860
God think
they equal to the Alii Nui?

668
01:06:23,964 --> 01:06:26,899
God doesn't think, He knows.

669
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:29,299
You have the sin of pride, Alii Nui.

670
01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:33,068
To find grace,
you must become humble.

671
01:06:33,173 --> 01:06:34,902
- Humble?
- Humble.

672
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:39,576
Are you humble?

673
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:47,844
I think maybe you proud, too.

674
01:06:47,955 --> 01:06:51,789
You find grace, then I find it!
You show me where right now!

675
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:54,986
That I cannot do!
Until you stop living

676
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:58,326
in incestuous marriage with Kelolo,
you will never find grace.

677
01:07:00,801 --> 01:07:02,496
Why Kelolo?

678
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,468
Because he is your brother.

679
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:07,335
And God forbids you
to live with him as his wife.

680
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:13,004
But Kelolo is good.
No better men all this island like Kelolo.

681
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:16,514
No, Makua Hale,
I be too Ionely send him away.

682
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:19,142
- Reverend Hale, if I may...
- Please.

683
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:22,950
If you don't give him up,
you will burn throughout all eternity

684
01:07:23,057 --> 01:07:26,185
in the blazing fires
of everlasting hell.

685
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:34,465
How hot this hell?

686
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:38,868
Hotter than the fires of a thousand
volcanoes. It burns incessantly.

687
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,372
Its pain is horrible
beyond imagining.

688
01:07:46,747 --> 01:07:51,684
Many years before I die.
Of Kelolo we talk another time.

689
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:02,125
Up we go.

690
01:08:08,602 --> 01:08:11,901
No! No! Come back!

691
01:08:53,313 --> 01:08:56,111
Mr. Morris! Mr. Morris!

692
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,308
Yes, sir?

693
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:58,715
I'll have that one there.

694
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:02,985
- You...
- No! That one there!

695
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:07,983
- Over here.
- Mr. Morris, that one definitely, there.

696
01:09:08,462 --> 01:09:10,327
- All right.
- What the hell, Mr. Morris.

697
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:12,524
- Send them all to my cabin!
- Yes, sir.

698
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:50,124
You want her for yourself?

699
01:10:50,228 --> 01:10:52,093
Who the hell does he think we are?

700
01:10:53,798 --> 01:10:56,733
How can you do this
to these innocent children?

701
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:59,668
Have you no mothers at home,
no sisters?

702
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:03,331
May God in His mercy forgive you.

703
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,975
Come back, Reverend,
I'll buy you a drink!

704
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:12,412
Go home, you wicked creature!

705
01:11:12,517 --> 01:11:14,815
- I no do nothing bad!
- Go home!

706
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:32,902
Let that girl go!

707
01:11:34,973 --> 01:11:36,167
Let her go!

708
01:11:47,519 --> 01:11:49,919
Dillon! Let her go.

709
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:55,518
That's enough!
Stop it! That's enough.

710
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:57,185
Stop it now.

711
01:11:58,029 --> 01:12:01,192
Rape is a rotten sport at any time.

712
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:04,631
But in Lahaina,
it's a downright waste of energy.

713
01:12:04,736 --> 01:12:08,194
Now get out of here and find yourselves
some cooperative ones.

714
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,337
This is the daughter of our Alii Nui.

715
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:21,342
My compliments to the Alii Nui.
My apologies to you.

716
01:12:21,453 --> 01:12:22,477
Are you alright?

717
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:30,086
You bear the responsibility
for the depredations of your men.

718
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,061
I do.

719
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:36,162
As God's instrument on Earth,

720
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:39,031
I order you
to take your sailors back to your ship!

721
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:44,439
My men are not sailors, Reverend.
They're whalers.

722
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,669
And for over three years,
they've been on this voyage

723
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:48,575
and they haven't touched land
in eight months.

724
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,945
Now, the females of Lahaina have
got the warmest blood in the Pacific,

725
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:56,578
and my men have neither the strength
nor the inclination to fight them off,

726
01:12:56,688 --> 01:12:59,156
neither, might I add, have I.

727
01:12:59,257 --> 01:13:00,622
If you'll excuse me.

728
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:06,059
- Iliki came in crying...
- Jerusha!

729
01:13:12,003 --> 01:13:14,870
- Rafer!
- Jerusha Bromley!

730
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,339
What are you doing here?

731
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:27,213
You're supposed to be in Walpole
waiting for me there!

732
01:13:27,318 --> 01:13:28,945
L... How could I have waited?

733
01:13:29,054 --> 01:13:31,079
- You didn't write, I had no...
- Write?

734
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:34,590
I wrote from Canton,
from Manila, from Santiago,

735
01:13:34,693 --> 01:13:36,285
from Honolulu...

736
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:39,989
Jerusha,
I've never seen anything so beautiful...

737
01:13:40,098 --> 01:13:41,656
Captain, you may not
behave in that manner!

738
01:13:41,766 --> 01:13:43,256
Shut up!
I'm speaking to Miss Bromley.

739
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:44,665
Rafer, I'm married.

740
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:47,638
Married!

741
01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:51,237
Oh, my God, not to him!

742
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:53,572
What did he do,
pray you into bed?

743
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,914
For two years now,
I thought of nothing but you,

744
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:04,147
night and day, on sea and land,
nothing but you!

745
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:06,382
I'm not going to let you go
a second time.

746
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:08,151
Abner, don't!

747
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:12,827
Stop it, Rafer!

748
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:15,491
Rafer, I'm expecting,
I'm with child!

749
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,334
Go away, go away!
Leave us alone!

750
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,341
I wanted you more
than anything else on this Earth.

751
01:14:29,013 --> 01:14:32,471
I could have taken you by candlelight
in your father's house, and you know that.

752
01:14:34,686 --> 01:14:39,817
May the Lord strike me dead if I ever
pass up another virgin as long as I live.

753
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:42,386
What a damn fool!

754
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:45,986
What a God-abandoned fool!

755
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,096
He's right. It's wrong
for the girls to swim out to the ships.

756
01:14:55,206 --> 01:14:57,401
Girls in Boston not swim out?

757
01:14:57,509 --> 01:15:00,603
- Certainly not!
- Water too damn cold?

758
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:02,537
Not at all!

759
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:06,139
But the Alii of Boston
have made it against the law,

760
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,742
just as you should make it
against the law here.

761
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:12,550
I think missionary like stop
everybody have fun.

762
01:15:12,657 --> 01:15:15,717
There's no fun in the disease
these girls catch from the sailors.

763
01:15:15,827 --> 01:15:17,419
There's only death.

764
01:15:19,697 --> 01:15:22,165
I think about it one more time.

765
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,827
To think about it is not enough.

766
01:15:24,936 --> 01:15:27,905
You must make laws
to protect your people.

767
01:15:28,006 --> 01:15:30,566
Laws against killing,
against rum,

768
01:15:30,675 --> 01:15:33,337
and laws against
the damnable sin of adultery.

769
01:15:33,444 --> 01:15:35,378
- Adultery?
- Yes.

770
01:15:37,415 --> 01:15:38,882
That what he mean.

771
01:15:38,983 --> 01:15:41,349
What kind adultery
you not like too much?

772
01:15:41,452 --> 01:15:42,578
What kind?

773
01:15:42,687 --> 01:15:46,350
There's only one kind of adultery,
and it is a mortal sin.

774
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:49,756
Got 23 kind adultery
going on this place all the time.

775
01:15:49,861 --> 01:15:53,627
Married man sleep with
another married walhihe. That one kind.

776
01:15:53,731 --> 01:15:56,825
Married man, he sleep
with wife his brother, that two kind.

777
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:58,664
Married man
sleep with wife his son...

778
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:02,171
If we say there shall be
no adultery without saying which kind,

779
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:05,333
everyone would think,
"They don't mean our kind of adultery,

780
01:16:05,443 --> 01:16:07,035
they mean the other 22 kinds."

781
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:11,514
On the other hand, if we list all 23 kinds,
somebody will surely say,

782
01:16:11,616 --> 01:16:13,948
"We never heard
that kind before, let's try it."

783
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:17,385
Father sleep with daughter,
that 11 kind.

784
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:20,013
Mother sleep with son,
this 12 kind.

785
01:16:20,124 --> 01:16:22,854
Married walhihe sleep with brother,
this 13 kind.

786
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:26,829
I think I see the problem.
I'll pray on the matter.

787
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,226
Makua Hale! Makua Hale!

788
01:16:38,076 --> 01:16:39,043
What is it?

789
01:16:39,143 --> 01:16:42,078
Hale walhihe say
you run fast to house.

790
01:16:42,814 --> 01:16:43,906
What's the matter?

791
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:47,451
The baby!
Him wanna come out fast!

792
01:16:47,552 --> 01:16:49,679
Better you make run like hell!

793
01:17:08,273 --> 01:17:11,299
- Have the pains started already?
- Yes.

794
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:14,105
Brother Whipple isn't due
for another three weeks.

795
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,679
I know.

796
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,179
Have you counted the pains?

797
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:21,741
- Nine or ten.
- Are they regular?

798
01:17:21,853 --> 01:17:23,286
No, not yet.

799
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,185
Do they make you
want to bear down?

800
01:17:26,624 --> 01:17:30,253
- Then your water hasn't broken yet.
- No, be careful.

801
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:33,228
- Then we have plenty of time
- Yes.

802
01:17:33,331 --> 01:17:35,356
Try to lie full length this way.

803
01:17:37,268 --> 01:17:40,863
I'll get everything ready.
Tell me when the next pain begins.

804
01:17:40,972 --> 01:17:42,234
Light the lamp.

805
01:18:12,236 --> 01:18:13,703
Give it to me.

806
01:18:14,138 --> 01:18:16,163
Tie these to the foot of the bed.

807
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:31,911
Tell me when it's over.

808
01:18:39,163 --> 01:18:40,721
Now.

809
01:18:42,066 --> 01:18:43,624
It's going away.

810
01:19:10,294 --> 01:19:12,956
- Who is it?
- It's Keoki, Reverend Hale.

811
01:19:13,064 --> 01:19:15,396
I've brought the midwives.

812
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,991
They have medicines
to kill pain and stop bleeding.

813
01:19:29,747 --> 01:19:31,339
Keoki, I do not want them.

814
01:19:32,116 --> 01:19:33,879
They have delivered many children,
Reverend Hale.

815
01:19:33,985 --> 01:19:37,386
I will not surrender my wife
or my child to heathen practices.

816
01:19:37,488 --> 01:19:39,388
Tell them to go away.

817
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:52,797
Bring in a basin of boiled water.
Boiled, Iliki!

818
01:19:53,604 --> 01:19:56,869
Then help Mrs. Hale
into her nightgown.

819
01:21:17,288 --> 01:21:18,846
Don't bear down anymore.

820
01:21:18,956 --> 01:21:20,651
I can't help it.

821
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:23,192
You must hold back
on the next pain.

822
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,598
What is it?
Is something wrong with the baby?

823
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:29,290
Nothing's wrong with the baby.

824
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:31,791
Listen to me carefully.

825
01:21:32,737 --> 01:21:36,332
It's in the breech position.
You remember what that is.

826
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,034
You must hold back
on the next pain.

827
01:21:39,143 --> 01:21:42,112
Pant, breathe
through your mouth, anything!

828
01:21:42,213 --> 01:21:43,407
But hold back!

829
01:21:45,316 --> 01:21:47,614
I can't! I can...

830
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:03,599
Listen, listen to me.
Jerusha, listen to me!

831
01:22:05,002 --> 01:22:07,493
I've got to try
to turn the baby around.

832
01:22:08,139 --> 01:22:12,041
The book said if it is not delivered
within three minutes, it will die.

833
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,270
Do you understand?

834
01:22:14,378 --> 01:22:15,572
All right.

835
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,905
All right.
When the next pain comes...

836
01:22:19,016 --> 01:22:20,381
It's coming now.

837
01:22:21,352 --> 01:22:22,649
Scream if you want to!

838
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,011
Hold back!

839
01:22:25,656 --> 01:22:28,022
No! No, don't push!

840
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,891
Hold back!

841
01:22:31,996 --> 01:22:35,159
Iliki, hand me the towels.
Quickly, Iliki!

842
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:54,644
It's a boy, Jerusha.

843
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:04,954
Is it normal?

844
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,722
He's a strong, healthy boy.

845
01:23:41,165 --> 01:23:43,463
You may go, now.
Sleep.

846
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:49,804
You know the kind way Hawaiians do
when baby come out wrong end like that?

847
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:58,838
Number one midwife, she kill the baby,
then she pull them out.

848
01:24:02,086 --> 01:24:03,553
Go away, Iliki.

849
01:24:17,068 --> 01:24:19,536
I love you, Jerusha.

850
01:24:20,571 --> 01:24:21,833
I love you.

851
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:28,103
When I was a boy
and found God,

852
01:24:28,779 --> 01:24:33,307
I thought I could never love anyone
as dearly as I loved him.

853
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:35,710
But I was wrong.

854
01:24:37,588 --> 01:24:39,783
I love you more than I love God.

855
01:24:40,591 --> 01:24:41,751
I love you.

856
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:46,159
I love you.

857
01:24:48,265 --> 01:24:49,960
I love you more.

858
01:24:54,205 --> 01:24:55,866
I love you more!

859
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:22,089
But I always liked the name David.
It's so sweet.

860
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:26,669
But Micah is a name strong
in the goodness of the Lord.

861
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:30,366
When we are gone,
he will carry on our work here.

862
01:25:30,474 --> 01:25:32,704
He will need such a name.

863
01:25:34,412 --> 01:25:35,504
All right.

864
01:25:48,058 --> 01:25:50,356
Try to forget
what I said to you last night.

865
01:25:50,461 --> 01:25:52,088
It was blasphemy.

866
01:25:52,663 --> 01:25:55,655
I placed my love for you
above my love of God.

867
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:03,035
I will spend the rest of my life
seeking His forgiveness.

868
01:26:25,496 --> 01:26:28,363
Micah. Micah.

869
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,992
Micah.

870
01:26:38,809 --> 01:26:45,146
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

871
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:49,242
I baptize you Martha Iliki Pupali.

872
01:26:49,353 --> 01:26:53,187
And I receive you
as a member of this church.

873
01:26:53,924 --> 01:26:56,290
The first fruit of my ministry.

874
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:18,982
- Is she going to do it?
- Yes, she is.

875
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:22,314
At first she threatened to cancel
the whole affair

876
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:25,547
unless I allowed her to become
a full member of the church.

877
01:27:25,656 --> 01:27:27,886
- Brother John.
- Very fine sermon, Reverend.

878
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:29,687
- Thank you, Captain.
- Mrs. Hale.

879
01:27:30,794 --> 01:27:31,954
When I mentioned Kelolo

880
01:27:32,062 --> 01:27:34,223
she had the effrontery to swear
she had sent him away.

881
01:27:34,331 --> 01:27:38,290
Well, she has.
He lives in another house now.

882
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:43,401
Yes, he sneaks back into the palace
every night, she admitted it.

883
01:27:47,411 --> 01:27:49,811
Her desire for grace
is quite overshadowed...

884
01:27:51,415 --> 01:27:54,543
- by her lust for Kelolo.
- Don't call it lust, Abner.

885
01:27:54,652 --> 01:27:57,450
It must be terribly hard for her to
understand that a form of marriage

886
01:27:57,555 --> 01:28:00,956
she's always considered holy,
is thought by us to be a deadly sin.

887
01:28:02,726 --> 01:28:05,854
- I find it sad.
- Sad?

888
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:09,126
Yes, I find it sad
that after all these years together,

889
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:12,691
two people should have to stop
loving each other in order to love God.

890
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:24,105
This day new laws are made
for us of Maui.

891
01:28:24,214 --> 01:28:27,843
Because these laws
are made for two people,

892
01:28:27,952 --> 01:28:31,353
I speak them in our two tongues,

893
01:28:31,455 --> 01:28:35,289
English first and then Hawaiian.

894
01:28:36,393 --> 01:28:41,490
First law: In this place,
everyone will serve God.

895
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:44,828
Everyone will love Jesus.

896
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:49,835
Next law:
There will be no killing of people.

897
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:56,345
No grown people, not children,
no sick babies will be killed.

898
01:28:58,716 --> 01:29:03,847
Next law:
No more will girls go to the ships.

899
01:29:06,023 --> 01:29:10,619
Next law: When the sun
goes down beneath the water,

900
01:29:10,728 --> 01:29:13,788
the sailors will go back to the ships.

901
01:29:14,732 --> 01:29:22,138
Next law: No more will the grog shops
sell the rum to my people.

902
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:29,645
Next law: There will be no more
sleeping together in mischief

903
01:29:29,747 --> 01:29:32,307
without getting married.

904
01:29:36,086 --> 01:29:41,524
Next law: Here, Kelolo
will be chief of the policemen.

905
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:45,686
He will beat with sticks
the breakers of these laws.

906
01:29:45,796 --> 01:29:50,392
He will put them in the jailhouse
here in the fort.

907
01:29:50,501 --> 01:29:53,163
Let us now obey these laws.

908
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:59,175
Then no more will people laugh at us
how we live in Lahaina.

909
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:03,413
The four of us speak for every ship
in Lahaina harbor, ma'am.

910
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:05,744
For over two years my men
have been at sea,

911
01:30:05,849 --> 01:30:07,714
and they will not be bound
by a curfew.

912
01:30:07,818 --> 01:30:10,810
We bring lots of custom to this place.

913
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:13,014
It used to be
the best port in the Pacific.

914
01:30:13,123 --> 01:30:17,355
We live in a small place,
but we change with new times.

915
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:19,452
You will obey my law.

916
01:30:19,563 --> 01:30:23,431
This afternoon our men are coming
ashore. They will remain ashore tonight.

917
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:26,264
There'll be no rape,
but any woman willing to trade her favor

918
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,770
for a yard of calico
will have the opportunity of doing so.

919
01:30:28,872 --> 01:30:31,739
If you come, you will be arrested.

920
01:30:31,842 --> 01:30:34,037
Try that and there'll be trouble.

921
01:30:34,144 --> 01:30:37,136
Then there will be trouble.

922
01:30:58,402 --> 01:31:00,427
You no walk this place,
go more far!

923
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:01,697
We're coming ashore.

924
01:31:01,805 --> 01:31:04,069
Touch one of my men
and you'll smart for it.

925
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:08,542
You get thrown in the jailhouse,
damn lhaole.

926
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:11,401
You're harder to see
than the Empress of China.

927
01:32:12,342 --> 01:32:14,674
A man has to fight
every inch of the way.

928
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:47,703
I love you, Jerusha.

929
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:50,209
I love you, I love you.

930
01:32:51,682 --> 01:32:54,651
There are a thousand whales
running off Japan, and I...

931
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:57,447
I left them and I sailed
half an ocean just to...

932
01:32:59,556 --> 01:33:01,421
Why, he's made
an old woman of you.

933
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:05,323
No, he hasn't.

934
01:33:05,963 --> 01:33:07,931
But he's made a damn good try.

935
01:33:09,066 --> 01:33:11,330
I'm taking you back
to New Hampshire.

936
01:33:11,435 --> 01:33:13,835
Can you imagine Walpole
in the autumn,

937
01:33:13,937 --> 01:33:18,772
with the leaves beginning to turn?
And the first snowfall on its way?

938
01:33:18,876 --> 01:33:20,104
Oh, don't, don't!

939
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,201
And the logs on the hearth?

940
01:33:22,312 --> 01:33:25,338
But who needs a fire
in this godforsaken place?

941
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:28,009
And a piano?
Someone singing?

942
01:33:29,086 --> 01:33:31,054
- And you, Jerusha.
- I'll never see Walpole again.

943
01:33:31,154 --> 01:33:32,746
Yes, you will, you will.

944
01:33:32,856 --> 01:33:34,551
You'll see it with me.

945
01:33:34,992 --> 01:33:38,155
Look, I don't give a damn
about my immortal soul.

946
01:33:38,262 --> 01:33:39,524
But I do care about you.

947
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:42,861
One minute with you,
one hour, one day with you.

948
01:33:42,966 --> 01:33:43,933
Now, pack your things.

949
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:46,195
Wait! No, no...

950
01:33:48,071 --> 01:33:50,130
Hale walhihe! Hale walhihe!

951
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,764
Our nice pretty church house!

952
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,776
I think them sailor men
gonna burn them all up with fire!

953
01:33:57,915 --> 01:33:59,849
Iliki, stay here,
Micah is asleep.

954
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:08,971
Church more better now.

955
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:13,880
Burn him big holes in wall.
Let plenty air come inside.

956
01:36:21,625 --> 01:36:22,922
My people,

957
01:36:23,026 --> 01:36:27,486
it is good
that you did not let the church die.

958
01:36:27,597 --> 01:36:31,624
When you sleep, God will smile.

959
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:45,140
Now, will the sailors
go back to their ships?

960
01:37:14,277 --> 01:37:17,337
Jerusha, I promise you.

961
01:37:17,447 --> 01:37:20,211
I won't touch you,
I won't even look at you.

962
01:37:20,317 --> 01:37:22,911
Please,
please come onboard my ship.

963
01:37:23,019 --> 01:37:26,477
I'll take you and your child
to Honolulu

964
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,387
and there I'll ship you both to Boston.

965
01:37:28,492 --> 01:37:31,620
You'll have an even chance
of staying alive there.

966
01:37:34,798 --> 01:37:37,232
He'll kill you here, Jerusha.

967
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:39,063
He will kill you.

968
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:41,194
Good-bye, Rafer.

969
01:37:44,107 --> 01:37:45,631
Good-bye, Jerusha.

970
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:04,190
- Morris!
- Yes, sir!

971
01:38:04,294 --> 01:38:06,489
Gather what men we have left
and get them aboard.

972
01:38:06,596 --> 01:38:09,030
I want my ships
out of this port by sunrise.

973
01:38:09,132 --> 01:38:10,429
Right away, sir.

974
01:38:17,307 --> 01:38:20,276
- What are you so mad about?
- Damn lhaole. Him no more good.

975
01:38:20,377 --> 01:38:22,675
Him try burn
the church house with fire.

976
01:38:25,882 --> 01:38:27,850
Steady, steady.

977
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:29,179
Easy!

978
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:31,545
Now, tell me.

979
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:35,284
How would you like to see
the lights along Manila Bay?

980
01:38:36,126 --> 01:38:37,923
Or Singapore?

981
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:41,126
Or the Irrawadi in Rangoon?

982
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:47,526
What that?

983
01:38:49,017 --> 01:38:50,985
Very good, Luku.

984
01:38:51,741 --> 01:38:53,504
I thought so!

985
01:39:28,011 --> 01:39:29,706
What the devil do you want?

986
01:39:29,813 --> 01:39:32,976
I've come for the young woman
named Martha Iliki Pupali

987
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:35,643
Who is illegally concealed
aboard this vessel.

988
01:39:38,021 --> 01:39:39,511
Get off my ship!

989
01:39:39,623 --> 01:39:42,023
I will not leave without Iliki.

990
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:44,286
Why, you bible-thumping
son of a bitch,

991
01:39:44,394 --> 01:39:47,158
do you want every female
I lay my eyes on?

992
01:39:56,773 --> 01:39:58,104
Mr. Morris!

993
01:39:58,208 --> 01:40:01,609
Next time you let the preacher
aboard this ship I'll hang you.

994
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:03,474
Maho. Maho!
Shark! Shark!

995
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,741
- Maho!
- Shark down there!

996
01:40:07,317 --> 01:40:09,444
Over here, shark!
Go get him!

997
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,025
He let him get away.

998
01:40:22,132 --> 01:40:25,067
He was... a big shark, too!

999
01:40:29,339 --> 01:40:33,867
Well, everything in these latitudes
is a disappointment.

1000
01:40:41,618 --> 01:40:43,779
- Mr. Morris, we weigh anchor.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1001
01:40:43,887 --> 01:40:46,014
Prepare to make way!

1002
01:40:47,123 --> 01:40:49,318
Prepare to make way!

1003
01:40:57,537 --> 01:40:59,630
If there be no further discussion,

1004
01:40:59,739 --> 01:41:04,335
we shall now vote on that resolution
calling for the expulsion

1005
01:41:04,444 --> 01:41:06,776
of Brother Abraham Hewlett
from his ministry.

1006
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,442
Those in favor will let it be known by
raising their right hands and saying aye.

1007
01:41:11,551 --> 01:41:13,815
- Aye.
- Aye.

1008
01:41:24,164 --> 01:41:28,658
Those opposed will raise their right hands
and signify by saying nay.

1009
01:41:28,768 --> 01:41:29,735
- Nay.
- Nay.

1010
01:41:29,836 --> 01:41:32,634
Three. The "Ayes" have it,
the motion is carried.

1011
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:34,172
The minutes of these proceedings

1012
01:41:34,274 --> 01:41:37,402
will be sent to the
Board of Commissioners in Boston,

1013
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,944
and the congregations
will be duly circularized.

1014
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,470
Abraham Hewlett...

1015
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:46,143
it is the judgment of this meeting...

1016
01:41:46,252 --> 01:41:48,982
...that your continued presence
in these islands

1017
01:41:49,122 --> 01:41:51,090
is an embarrassment to the church.

1018
01:41:51,191 --> 01:41:55,355
And it is our decision
that you leave here and live elsewhere.

1019
01:41:57,497 --> 01:42:00,830
It is not within your jurisdiction
to advise me any further.

1020
01:42:00,934 --> 01:42:02,834
I shall live where I wish.

1021
01:42:03,803 --> 01:42:06,294
You will receive
no sustenance from us!

1022
01:42:07,407 --> 01:42:09,432
What sustenance?

1023
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:12,443
Those yearly barrels of trash
and cast-off junk

1024
01:42:12,545 --> 01:42:16,777
sent to us by the Boston Missionary Board
and disguised as Christian charity?

1025
01:42:16,883 --> 01:42:20,512
My wife has brought me
several thousand acres of prime land.

1026
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,713
I shall work for myself,

1027
01:42:22,822 --> 01:42:24,881
earn my own wage,

1028
01:42:24,991 --> 01:42:31,089
and provide for my family here
on these islands for as long as I choose.

1029
01:42:31,197 --> 01:42:35,600
You love Hawaiians as potential converts,
but you despise them as people.

1030
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:39,697
Having come
to the opposite conclusion,

1031
01:42:39,806 --> 01:42:43,674
I gladly depart from a Ministry
in which love has no place.

1032
01:42:50,517 --> 01:42:53,782
We shall now look to that resolution

1033
01:42:53,887 --> 01:42:58,654
censuring Brother John Whipple
for performing the marriage ceremony

1034
01:42:58,758 --> 01:43:01,488
whereby our lost brother fell into sin.

1035
01:43:01,594 --> 01:43:04,620
I'd say the ceremony was one
whereby he fell out of sin.

1036
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:11,234
As for the vote,
save your time, Brothers.

1037
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:13,532
I also take my departure.

1038
01:43:15,141 --> 01:43:16,631
Brother John!

1039
01:43:23,816 --> 01:43:26,785
Kelolo has something to say to you,
Makua Hale.

1040
01:43:26,886 --> 01:43:28,911
Make you very happy.

1041
01:43:29,022 --> 01:43:35,689
I evil, I corrupt, I sinful.

1042
01:43:37,497 --> 01:43:41,024
You see?
Already has he found grace.

1043
01:43:41,134 --> 01:43:45,571
Does this mean you are prepared
to move out of the palace

1044
01:43:45,672 --> 01:43:48,937
and renounce this carnal union
with your sister?

1045
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:52,637
He will not have to go away,
Makua Hale.

1046
01:43:53,046 --> 01:43:57,210
He will be a Christian
and I will be a Christian.

1047
01:43:57,317 --> 01:44:02,914
Many times have you said that marriage
between Christians is sanctified.

1048
01:44:03,022 --> 01:44:08,119
A marriage between brother and sister
can never be sanctified.

1049
01:44:08,228 --> 01:44:14,064
Then there is no way I can keep Kelolo
without going to hell?

1050
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:16,499
No way at all.

1051
01:44:25,178 --> 01:44:32,016
I am so filled with sin
that in the wrong way do I love Kelolo.

1052
01:44:32,785 --> 01:44:36,516
Yet also do I love Jesus.

1053
01:44:36,623 --> 01:44:40,286
He was such a good young man

1054
01:44:40,393 --> 01:44:42,793
with so much aloha,

1055
01:44:42,895 --> 01:44:48,026
and they hurt him so badly
when they killed him.

1056
01:44:49,168 --> 01:44:54,435
It will be sad when I die
and not go to Him.

1057
01:44:54,540 --> 01:45:00,877
On the day you send Kelolo away,
I will accept you into the church,

1058
01:45:01,814 --> 01:45:04,977
and you will see Jesus.

1059
01:45:05,752 --> 01:45:07,151
I promise.

1060
01:45:13,059 --> 01:45:15,960
Now will I sleep for a while.

1061
01:45:16,062 --> 01:45:18,496
Aloha, Makua Hale.

1062
01:45:18,598 --> 01:45:22,796
Aloha, Alii Nui.

1063
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:38,539
So King Tamatoa called together
his people in Bora Bora

1064
01:45:38,651 --> 01:45:44,886
and said, "This new god,
this Oro, I do not like him.

1065
01:45:45,291 --> 01:45:49,990
"He is a god of vengeance and wrath.
Let us run away from him.

1066
01:45:50,096 --> 01:45:52,997
"Let us cross the waters
to another land.

1067
01:45:53,099 --> 01:45:56,796
"There, without fear,
can we worship Kane,

1068
01:45:56,903 --> 01:46:00,566
giver of life, Kane the gentle."

1069
01:46:01,474 --> 01:46:04,739
So they did that,
and as they drove the canoe forward,

1070
01:46:04,844 --> 01:46:06,744
this was their chant...

1071
01:46:23,296 --> 01:46:26,629
What's this?
What is it, what's going on?

1072
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,728
It's a chant that tells how our people
sailed from Bora Bora

1073
01:46:30,837 --> 01:46:33,431
to this new land
beneath the Seven Little Eyes,

1074
01:46:33,539 --> 01:46:35,507
guided by Mano the shark.

1075
01:46:35,608 --> 01:46:38,600
In a way, it's like the migration
of Abraham in the Bible.

1076
01:46:40,747 --> 01:46:42,112
Dismiss the class.

1077
01:46:44,851 --> 01:46:46,648
You are dismissed.

1078
01:47:04,203 --> 01:47:08,663
How dare you compare a bundle of myths
to the Holy Scriptures?

1079
01:47:15,248 --> 01:47:19,014
These Kahuna superstitions
are dangerous, Keoki.

1080
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:21,882
Your task is to spread the word
of Almighty God.

1081
01:47:23,489 --> 01:47:26,117
I have waited eight years
to spread it.

1082
01:47:26,225 --> 01:47:28,921
And you have not ordained me yet.

1083
01:47:29,028 --> 01:47:31,258
How long must I wait,
Reverend Hale?

1084
01:47:31,364 --> 01:47:34,390
I'll answer you truthfully.

1085
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,937
For the present I have no plans
for ordaining you at all.

1086
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:44,642
- What do you hold against me?
- My dear Keoki.

1087
01:47:44,744 --> 01:47:46,109
You're too young.

1088
01:47:46,212 --> 01:47:48,544
I'm older than you
when you were ordained.

1089
01:47:48,648 --> 01:47:53,483
Yes, but you must remember
that I grew up in a Christian family.

1090
01:47:53,586 --> 01:47:55,781
- I was...
- A white man?

1091
01:48:01,561 --> 01:48:04,223
If you wish to put it that way, yes.

1092
01:48:05,131 --> 01:48:07,031
For over a hundred years,

1093
01:48:07,133 --> 01:48:11,331
my ancestors fought that this church
might be established.

1094
01:48:11,437 --> 01:48:13,462
Some of them died for it.

1095
01:48:13,573 --> 01:48:16,599
I cannot wait 100 years,
Reverend Hale.

1096
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:19,507
I was the highest student
in the mission school in America.

1097
01:48:19,612 --> 01:48:22,274
It was me and my words
that brought you here.

1098
01:48:27,987 --> 01:48:29,454
That is correct.

1099
01:48:35,728 --> 01:48:37,719
I've been thinking lately

1100
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:40,594
that our church is ready
for a board of deacons.

1101
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:43,533
I'm willing to make you
their head, Keoki.

1102
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:46,138
You would move among
the Hawaiians,

1103
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:49,402
find out who is smoking,
who has alcohol on his breath,

1104
01:48:49,509 --> 01:48:52,842
who is sleeping with another man's wife,
that sort of thing.

1105
01:48:52,945 --> 01:48:57,814
Then each week you will hand me a list
to be admonished from the pulpit.

1106
01:48:59,919 --> 01:49:02,444
I sought a way to serve my people.

1107
01:49:03,689 --> 01:49:05,589
Not to spy upon them.

1108
01:49:09,128 --> 01:49:12,655
Your mother will not be pleased that
you have refused the deaconship.

1109
01:49:13,866 --> 01:49:15,299
My mother is dying.

1110
01:49:16,502 --> 01:49:18,902
Your mother is not dying, Keoki.

1111
01:49:19,038 --> 01:49:22,906
I just talked with her.
There's nothing wrong with her.

1112
01:49:24,076 --> 01:49:25,373
She will die.

1113
01:49:26,979 --> 01:49:29,209
And then will come
the whistling wind.

1114
01:50:36,248 --> 01:50:37,579
Who's the young boy?

1115
01:50:41,854 --> 01:50:43,549
King Kamehameha.

1116
01:50:47,827 --> 01:50:48,987
I could find nothing wrong with her.

1117
01:50:49,095 --> 01:50:52,064
But she is dying,
there's no question of that.

1118
01:50:53,265 --> 01:50:54,994
She would like to see you both.

1119
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:22,826
Hear me,
for I speak to Kelolo.

1120
01:51:29,402 --> 01:51:33,395
Dear brother, dear husband,

1121
01:51:33,506 --> 01:51:37,840
God commands you
to be sent away from me.

1122
01:51:37,943 --> 01:51:41,936
Sent away to a faraway place.

1123
01:51:43,516 --> 01:51:46,974
No more shall I sleep in your arms.

1124
01:51:49,021 --> 01:51:52,787
No more shall you see me again
in the sunlight.

1125
01:51:57,396 --> 01:51:59,591
I have said it.

1126
01:52:01,133 --> 01:52:02,623
Aloha.

1127
01:52:16,515 --> 01:52:19,143
I will need some water.

1128
01:52:19,919 --> 01:52:23,446
There is water beside me,
Makua Hale.

1129
01:52:39,939 --> 01:52:41,804
Malama Kanakoa,

1130
01:52:42,742 --> 01:52:46,439
having entered into a state of grace,

1131
01:52:46,545 --> 01:52:49,844
seeks baptism
into the Holy Church.

1132
01:52:54,353 --> 01:52:56,787
In the name of the Father,

1133
01:52:56,889 --> 01:52:59,687
the Son,

1134
01:52:59,792 --> 01:53:01,987
and the Holy Spirit,

1135
01:53:02,094 --> 01:53:07,555
I baptize you
Ruth Malama Kanakoa.

1136
01:53:10,803 --> 01:53:14,102
Of Ruth it is written,

1137
01:53:14,206 --> 01:53:19,371
strength and honor
are her clothing,

1138
01:53:19,478 --> 01:53:23,710
and she shall rejoice
in time to come.

1139
01:53:28,687 --> 01:53:32,145
And Ruth said,
"Wither thou goest, I will go."

1140
01:53:34,393 --> 01:53:36,122
Alolha hui.

1141
01:53:41,167 --> 01:53:43,465
Alolha hui.

1142
01:53:43,569 --> 01:53:48,700
My adorable little lhaole sister.

1143
01:53:59,051 --> 01:54:03,647
Hear me again,
for I make a kapu.

1144
01:54:03,756 --> 01:54:08,455
If on some distant day,
I shall die,

1145
01:54:08,561 --> 01:54:11,553
let no one cut his skin

1146
01:54:11,664 --> 01:54:16,260
or strike out the teeth
from his mouth

1147
01:54:17,036 --> 01:54:20,972
or pluck out the eyes from his face.

1148
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:24,700
Obey this law.

1149
01:54:29,148 --> 01:54:30,410
Ae.

1150
01:54:33,052 --> 01:54:34,417
Makua Hale?

1151
01:54:35,287 --> 01:54:36,584
Alii Nui.

1152
01:54:36,689 --> 01:54:40,591
I be too Ionely apart from Kelolo.

1153
01:54:41,827 --> 01:54:47,732
Before he goes,
may I not touch him once more in aloha?

1154
02:05:03,815 --> 02:05:06,181
Stop this abomination!

1155
02:05:06,284 --> 02:05:09,185
I forbid it! I forbid it!

1156
02:05:10,121 --> 02:05:11,884
Let me go!

1157
02:05:12,824 --> 02:05:13,950
Go!

1158
02:05:17,863 --> 02:05:19,990
You cannot go through
with this, Keoki.

1159
02:05:20,098 --> 02:05:23,158
You must not interfere with us here,
Reverend Hale.

1160
02:05:23,268 --> 02:05:26,328
Your mother will curse you
from her grave!

1161
02:05:26,438 --> 02:05:29,168
She is not in her grave,
Reverend Hale.

1162
02:05:29,274 --> 02:05:33,005
In her last words to our father,
she said, "For their own good,

1163
02:05:33,111 --> 02:05:35,443
"my people must become Christians,

1164
02:05:35,547 --> 02:05:38,812
"so let Makua Hale bury me
in the Christian way as an example.

1165
02:05:38,917 --> 02:05:41,909
"Then dig me up
and hide my bones in the old way,

1166
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:47,390
so that Kane and Kanaloa and Pele
will know that I love them, too."

1167
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:49,725
You are lying!

1168
02:05:49,828 --> 02:05:53,924
My mother's bones are hidden
where no one will ever find them.

1169
02:05:54,032 --> 02:05:57,092
And her heart goes
with our father to Bora Bora.

1170
02:06:06,244 --> 02:06:09,441
Backslider! Heretics!

1171
02:06:09,548 --> 02:06:10,776
Blasphemers!

1172
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,477
Heathens!

1173
02:07:51,416 --> 02:07:55,546
Oh, God! Bring them low!

1174
02:07:55,654 --> 02:07:56,678
Punish them!

1175
02:07:56,788 --> 02:08:02,420
Send earthquakes! Plagues!
Floods! Pestilence!

1176
02:08:02,527 --> 02:08:04,017
Destroy them!

1177
02:08:04,129 --> 02:08:07,587
Destroy them utterly!

1178
02:08:48,339 --> 02:08:49,499
Well?

1179
02:08:51,309 --> 02:08:54,301
The child is terribly deformed.

1180
02:08:57,916 --> 02:08:59,884
It is God's punishment.

1181
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:03,244
- Abner!
- They have defied God.

1182
02:09:03,822 --> 02:09:07,883
And God has visited his wrath
on them, as I foretold.

1183
02:09:07,992 --> 02:09:10,825
Abner, don't you understand?
The baby is in danger!

1184
02:09:10,929 --> 02:09:12,988
They can't accept
a deformed child as Alii Nui.

1185
02:09:13,098 --> 02:09:14,429
They may even try to kill it!

1186
02:09:14,532 --> 02:09:16,762
Now they will see

1187
02:09:16,868 --> 02:09:20,463
how God rebukes
apostasy and incest.

1188
02:09:20,572 --> 02:09:22,403
All of them will see.

1189
02:09:22,507 --> 02:09:24,065
All of them!

1190
02:09:24,175 --> 02:09:25,870
All of them will see!

1191
02:09:31,883 --> 02:09:34,317
Because Noelani and Keoki

1192
02:09:34,419 --> 02:09:39,550
lusted like rutting beasts in the field
before your very eyes,

1193
02:09:40,325 --> 02:09:44,386
because they broke the commandments
of God and the laws of men,

1194
02:09:44,496 --> 02:09:47,363
now has God punished them.

1195
02:09:47,465 --> 02:09:50,025
Take heed before it is too late.

1196
02:09:50,135 --> 02:09:54,970
Take warning, for the deformed offspring
of that evil union

1197
02:09:55,073 --> 02:09:59,976
was ordained by Almighty God
Himself who has said,

1198
02:10:00,078 --> 02:10:04,981
"I will punish the wicked
for their iniquity.

1199
02:10:05,917 --> 02:10:09,409
"Everyone that is found
shall be thrust through.

1200
02:10:09,521 --> 02:10:11,716
"Their houses shall be spoiled,

1201
02:10:12,657 --> 02:10:14,557
"their wives ravished,

1202
02:10:14,659 --> 02:10:19,323
their children also shall be dashed
to pieces before their eyes."

1203
02:10:48,893 --> 02:10:50,360
He won't see you.

1204
02:10:54,432 --> 02:10:55,763
Noelani?

1205
02:11:00,271 --> 02:11:04,935
- If only I'd had a chance to save it.
- You had that chance.

1206
02:11:05,043 --> 02:11:07,273
I mean its soul.

1207
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,809
I mean the child.

1208
02:11:25,763 --> 02:11:28,755
I'm carrying too much whale oil to make
a run back to the whaling grounds,

1209
02:11:28,867 --> 02:11:31,392
and not enough for a trip
to New Bedford.

1210
02:11:31,502 --> 02:11:32,799
That happens.

1211
02:11:34,138 --> 02:11:36,538
Make me a fair offer
and the lot is yours.

1212
02:11:36,641 --> 02:11:40,634
Since Doc Whipple joined the business
we've stopped buying odd lots of oil.

1213
02:11:40,745 --> 02:11:42,076
Why?

1214
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:43,704
We'll store it for you,

1215
02:11:43,815 --> 02:11:46,875
and trans-ship it with other odd lots
when we have a full cargo.

1216
02:11:46,985 --> 02:11:51,149
Charge you a fair fee for the service.
But we won't buy anything.

1217
02:11:51,256 --> 02:11:52,689
It's Doc's idea.

1218
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:55,156
From now on, we don't own,
we just handle.

1219
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:57,023
Well, I'll be damned.

1220
02:11:57,128 --> 02:11:58,959
You don't put up
a dollar of your own money,

1221
02:11:59,063 --> 02:12:02,226
and yet you handle anything
that passes in and out of the port.

1222
02:12:02,333 --> 02:12:03,800
For a fee, of course.

1223
02:12:03,902 --> 02:12:06,166
An honest burglar
would use a gun.

1224
02:12:06,938 --> 02:12:08,599
Well, for people
who came here to do good,

1225
02:12:08,706 --> 02:12:11,698
you fellows have done pretty well,
don't you think?

1226
02:12:11,809 --> 02:12:16,337
I believe the Reverend Hewlett in Honolulu
is going in for the sugar cane business.

1227
02:12:16,447 --> 02:12:18,381
As a matter of fact,
Doc's going there

1228
02:12:18,483 --> 02:12:20,747
to open a branch
for us to handle it for him.

1229
02:12:20,852 --> 02:12:22,183
You're worst than locusts.

1230
02:12:22,287 --> 02:12:24,949
- When can I move my whale oil?
- In the morning.

1231
02:12:25,056 --> 02:12:26,318
I'm shorthanded as well.

1232
02:12:26,424 --> 02:12:30,155
I need a cook, seven or eight
healthy kanakas at $5 a head.

1233
02:12:30,261 --> 02:12:33,162
We can supply the cook, but we
don't handle native labor anymore.

1234
02:12:33,264 --> 02:12:34,231
Why not?

1235
02:12:34,332 --> 02:12:37,631
The practical reason,
Hawaiians are becoming too scarce

1236
02:12:37,735 --> 02:12:38,963
to ship from these islands.

1237
02:12:40,038 --> 02:12:43,007
The humanitarian reason,
we won't use force to round them up.

1238
02:12:44,375 --> 02:12:45,569
Dr. Whipple?

1239
02:12:49,781 --> 02:12:54,241
Miss Hale want you come see
what make Micah not feel good.

1240
02:12:55,453 --> 02:12:56,943
I'll be right there.

1241
02:12:57,655 --> 02:12:58,679
Excuse me.

1242
02:12:59,490 --> 02:13:04,086
What we make in handling charges,
we lose in free medical services.

1243
02:13:04,195 --> 02:13:06,663
I'll bet.
What about my deckhands?

1244
02:13:06,764 --> 02:13:09,597
Fredericks operates
the press gang on the island.

1245
02:13:09,701 --> 02:13:11,669
If you must have them,
go and see him.

1246
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:31,515
Do we have to wear these again?

1247
02:13:31,622 --> 02:13:35,058
David, you know you do.
Your father told you it's October.

1248
02:13:35,159 --> 02:13:37,684
- But they're too hot.
- I know they are.

1249
02:13:37,795 --> 02:13:41,731
- What seems to be the trouble here?
- Hello, John. Thank you for coming.

1250
02:13:41,833 --> 02:13:43,232
I put Micah to bed.

1251
02:13:43,334 --> 02:13:45,325
I'm not worried about Micah.
I'm worried about you.

1252
02:13:45,436 --> 02:13:47,996
I've told you this before,
and I'll repeat it.

1253
02:13:48,106 --> 02:13:50,131
You are working yourself to death.

1254
02:13:50,241 --> 02:13:54,405
- Lucy, run along and play with David.
- Beans again? And salt pork?

1255
02:13:54,512 --> 02:13:56,446
In a place where fruit ripens
the year round,

1256
02:13:56,547 --> 02:13:59,778
- and fish come fresh from the sea?
- Abner doesn't really like it.

1257
02:13:59,884 --> 02:14:02,375
I'll listen to Abner on religion,
but not on diet.

1258
02:14:04,922 --> 02:14:06,583
You must go home, Jerusha.

1259
02:14:06,691 --> 02:14:10,183
You must go home for at least a year.
Two would be even better.

1260
02:14:10,294 --> 02:14:12,956
Otherwise, you'll die here,
you'll die young.

1261
02:14:13,064 --> 02:14:15,726
If you don't take it up
with Abner this time, I will.

1262
02:14:15,833 --> 02:14:18,199
Oh, no, John,
I will talk to him, I promise.

1263
02:14:18,302 --> 02:14:20,167
I've delayed this long because...

1264
02:14:25,309 --> 02:14:29,006
Well, about Micah. He's got a fever
and his chest is covered with spots...

1265
02:14:29,113 --> 02:14:30,375
Spots?

1266
02:14:40,925 --> 02:14:44,759
But measles is a child's disease.
I can't understand...

1267
02:14:44,862 --> 02:14:48,127
To us, it is a child's disease, Abner,
but to the Hawaiians,

1268
02:14:48,232 --> 02:14:51,497
who have developed no resistance
at all, it is a deadly pestilence.

1269
02:14:51,602 --> 02:14:53,001
The sailor who brought it ashore

1270
02:14:53,104 --> 02:14:55,902
is bound to have infected dozens
of others besides Micah.

1271
02:14:56,007 --> 02:14:59,465
Within three days, this disease
will sweep like a raging plague.

1272
02:15:00,411 --> 02:15:02,174
Their fevers will go high,

1273
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:05,078
their deaths are agonizing
beyond all imagination.

1274
02:15:06,017 --> 02:15:08,451
Our children will come through
in good shape.

1275
02:15:08,553 --> 02:15:11,215
We can save a fair percentage
of the Hawaiian children

1276
02:15:11,322 --> 02:15:13,449
if we can separate them
from their parents.

1277
02:15:14,492 --> 02:15:16,119
The adults are another story.

1278
02:15:17,161 --> 02:15:20,494
One month from today,
one third of our population will be dead.

1279
02:15:21,065 --> 02:15:24,159
One out of four of the survivors
will develop consumption.

1280
02:15:24,268 --> 02:15:27,829
One out of 7 will be deaf,
one out of 12 will be blind.

1281
02:15:27,939 --> 02:15:29,873
I need all the help you can give me.

1282
02:15:29,974 --> 02:15:32,499
Captain Hoxworth has offered
to organize a harbor blockade.

1283
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:35,602
The only trouble
is that many of the sailors have come...

1284
02:15:35,713 --> 02:15:37,010
What of Iliki?

1285
02:15:37,115 --> 02:15:39,015
What have you done with her?

1286
02:15:39,784 --> 02:15:43,345
I married her off
to an English consul in Santiago.

1287
02:15:43,454 --> 02:15:47,914
With what you and I together
have taught her, she'll end up a duchess.

1288
02:15:48,025 --> 02:15:49,788
Get out of Lahaina!

1289
02:15:49,894 --> 02:15:53,762
He can't get out of Lahaina, Abner,
he's quarantined like the rest of us.

1290
02:16:01,405 --> 02:16:05,000
We accept your offer, Captain.
And we thank you.

1291
02:16:35,473 --> 02:16:36,872
Get your mother home.

1292
02:16:36,974 --> 02:16:40,171
- John, just give me a minute.
- No argument, Jerusha.

1293
02:16:40,278 --> 02:16:42,075
Get her home and keep her there.

1294
02:17:09,507 --> 02:17:12,101
Everybody go beach.
Make lie-down in the water.

1295
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:13,973
Try for keep cool.

1296
02:17:14,078 --> 02:17:16,945
That'll kill them.
They'll catch pneumonia and die.

1297
02:17:18,216 --> 02:17:20,081
Rafer, help me.

1298
02:17:40,738 --> 02:17:42,103
Good Lord!

1299
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:45,470
Go back to your homes,
you must not stay here!

1300
02:17:45,576 --> 02:17:47,806
It'll kill you here,
go back to your homes!

1301
02:17:47,912 --> 02:17:49,641
Go back to your homes!

1302
02:17:49,747 --> 02:17:52,443
No, no, too hot, burn like fire.
Get cool in water.

1303
02:18:02,493 --> 02:18:05,121
You must come with me, Keoki.
Let me help you.

1304
02:18:05,229 --> 02:18:07,629
- You need warmth, blankets.
- Leave me alone.

1305
02:18:07,732 --> 02:18:10,860
Please, Keoki,
if you stay here, you will die.

1306
02:18:10,968 --> 02:18:12,595
- Then I will die.
- No!

1307
02:18:12,703 --> 02:18:16,139
Go away.
Can't you even let us die in peace?

1308
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,437
You must not die
without salvation, Keoki.

1309
02:18:19,543 --> 02:18:23,707
God will forgive you your sins.
An all-powerful God can forgive anything.

1310
02:18:23,814 --> 02:18:28,410
- God no longer exists.
- Dear brother, don't blaspheme!

1311
02:18:29,353 --> 02:18:31,378
Not "brother," Reverend Hale.

1312
02:18:32,123 --> 02:18:33,420
Pray with me, Keoki.

1313
02:18:33,524 --> 02:18:36,925
God, take thy erring servant Keoki
into Thy bosom...

1314
02:18:37,028 --> 02:18:39,588
I will not stay to hear it.

1315
02:19:04,855 --> 02:19:06,447
There's nothing
you could've done for him.

1316
02:19:10,928 --> 02:19:12,987
When Captain Cook discovered
these islands 50 years ago,

1317
02:19:13,097 --> 02:19:14,758
they were a true paradise.

1318
02:19:14,865 --> 02:19:17,425
Infectious disease was unknown.

1319
02:19:17,535 --> 02:19:19,093
They didn't even catch cold.

1320
02:19:19,837 --> 02:19:23,068
There were 400,000 of them,
now there are less than 150,000.

1321
02:19:25,409 --> 02:19:28,674
You and I may well live to see
the last Hawaiian lowered into his grave.

1322
02:19:29,947 --> 02:19:32,415
With proper Christian services,
of course.

1323
02:20:32,877 --> 02:20:34,037
We...

1324
02:20:36,947 --> 02:20:39,814
We seem to have passed
the peak of the epidemic.

1325
02:20:45,322 --> 02:20:49,918
Keoki is dead... of course.

1326
02:20:51,395 --> 02:20:54,489
He went forth unrepentant into hell.

1327
02:21:05,709 --> 02:21:10,169
They're burning... the bodies.
It goes well.

1328
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:15,377
Aside from that...

1329
02:21:15,486 --> 02:21:22,016
there's nothing but the dead,
and the dying, and those who mourn them.

1330
02:21:25,629 --> 02:21:27,119
I did not mean it.

1331
02:21:31,268 --> 02:21:34,499
No matter what I said,
I did not mean it!

1332
02:21:34,605 --> 02:21:37,802
How could I have known
God would scourge them so terribly?

1333
02:21:38,943 --> 02:21:41,434
God had nothing to do with it.
It's a disease.

1334
02:21:42,246 --> 02:21:46,945
The Bible tells us nothing on this Earth
can happen without God's consent...

1335
02:21:47,051 --> 02:21:50,418
Abner, do you believe
every word in the Bible literally?

1336
02:21:51,689 --> 02:21:53,213
Believe?

1337
02:21:53,324 --> 02:21:57,556
The Bible is God's holy word
written exactly as He commanded,

1338
02:21:57,661 --> 02:21:58,821
and I believe it all.

1339
02:21:58,929 --> 02:22:01,955
I believe in heaven and in hell
and in original sin

1340
02:22:02,066 --> 02:22:05,593
and in God's terrible,
all-consuming wrath.

1341
02:22:05,703 --> 02:22:08,638
If I did not believe,
I could not call myself a Christian.

1342
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:12,070
Then I will no longer
call myself a Christian.

1343
02:22:13,377 --> 02:22:15,675
I don't believe in your God of wrath.

1344
02:22:15,779 --> 02:22:18,509
I don't believe Keoki's in hell, either.

1345
02:22:18,616 --> 02:22:21,676
I believe he has found God,
and Malama with him, and Kelolo,

1346
02:22:21,785 --> 02:22:23,685
and those who died on the beach.

1347
02:22:23,787 --> 02:22:26,654
It's impossible
for the unbaptized to enter heaven!

1348
02:22:27,925 --> 02:22:29,825
I've never seen
a people more generous,

1349
02:22:29,927 --> 02:22:33,363
more loving, more filled
with Christian sweetness than these.

1350
02:22:33,464 --> 02:22:35,625
I will not believe
that God rejected them

1351
02:22:35,733 --> 02:22:38,065
simply because
they haven't been baptized.

1352
02:22:38,168 --> 02:22:41,296
Not even that lost child
whose birth you cursed.

1353
02:22:50,848 --> 02:22:54,944
These things
are God's will... not mine.

1354
02:22:57,488 --> 02:23:00,980
What else but God's wrath
has the power to annihilate them?

1355
02:23:02,192 --> 02:23:06,822
Disease, despair,
our lack of love,

1356
02:23:07,731 --> 02:23:09,892
our inability to find them beautiful.

1357
02:23:10,834 --> 02:23:16,101
Our contempt for their ways,
our lust for their land, our greed,

1358
02:23:17,508 --> 02:23:18,998
our arrogance.

1359
02:23:20,411 --> 02:23:22,402
That is what kills them, Abner.

1360
02:23:24,415 --> 02:23:26,440
That's what you
must save them from.

1361
02:23:27,518 --> 02:23:29,918
They are already lost.
I failed them.

1362
02:23:30,020 --> 02:23:31,612
I failed these people!

1363
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:34,018
And God.

1364
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:40,191
My ministry here is at an end.

1365
02:23:41,765 --> 02:23:44,063
Your ministry here is not ended.

1366
02:23:44,768 --> 02:23:49,228
You will stay here in Lahaina
and shelter and protect these people.

1367
02:23:50,741 --> 02:23:53,335
You will win them to a merciful God

1368
02:23:53,444 --> 02:23:58,143
with bonds of charity so strong,
they will belong to Him forever.

1369
02:23:59,683 --> 02:24:00,980
How?

1370
02:24:01,085 --> 02:24:05,886
By offering what you've always
valued most and found it hardest to give,

1371
02:24:06,824 --> 02:24:08,451
to them and to me...

1372
02:24:10,661 --> 02:24:12,060
your love.

1373
02:24:40,624 --> 02:24:42,182
Watch how you handle that!

1374
02:24:42,826 --> 02:24:45,886
I haven't carried this 16,000 miles
to have you drop it.

1375
02:24:50,801 --> 02:24:51,859
That's the lot.

1376
02:24:53,971 --> 02:24:55,905
Hold it in the pier till I get back.

1377
02:25:07,117 --> 02:25:08,482
Hey, you up there!

1378
02:25:13,424 --> 02:25:14,755
Reverend Hale!

1379
02:25:18,529 --> 02:25:21,589
Go into the church, Micah,
and wait for me there.

1380
02:25:43,787 --> 02:25:45,755
I wanna speak with you.

1381
02:25:51,829 --> 02:25:53,558
That's a house.

1382
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:56,758
I had it built in New Bedford
and taken down piece by piece.

1383
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:01,399
- But how can this...
- Shut up.

1384
02:26:01,505 --> 02:26:04,269
Every beam,
board and plank is numbered.

1385
02:26:04,374 --> 02:26:07,775
My ship's carpenter will remain here
till it is put together.

1386
02:26:10,514 --> 02:26:12,175
It's for Jerusha.

1387
02:26:14,384 --> 02:26:15,783
For you, too, I guess.

1388
02:26:15,886 --> 02:26:19,617
I want her out of that grass hut,
I wanna put a decent roof over her head.

1389
02:26:21,158 --> 02:26:22,125
But I'm afraid...

1390
02:26:22,226 --> 02:26:25,354
I will not let her spend the rest of her
life in that pigsty you stuck her in.

1391
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:28,295
Good God, man,
she's your wife!

1392
02:26:28,932 --> 02:26:31,196
Wouldn't you like to see her
living in comfort?

1393
02:26:31,935 --> 02:26:33,266
Of course I would.

1394
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:34,598
Good.

1395
02:26:34,705 --> 02:26:38,004
Good, then you accept.
The house is on the pier.

1396
02:26:38,108 --> 02:26:40,269
No, I didn't accept, I can't.

1397
02:26:41,712 --> 02:26:44,306
I should've known better
than to speak to you in the first place!

1398
02:26:45,449 --> 02:26:46,575
Where's Jerusha?

1399
02:26:48,886 --> 02:26:50,080
Well, where is she?

1400
02:27:06,036 --> 02:27:07,230
How did she die?

1401
02:27:09,106 --> 02:27:10,403
I killed her.

1402
02:27:14,244 --> 02:27:16,007
I simply killed her.

1403
02:27:31,862 --> 02:27:34,695
That's enough!
Enough!

1404
02:27:34,798 --> 02:27:36,163
Enough!

1405
02:27:43,807 --> 02:27:44,933
Go to your father.

1406
02:27:46,143 --> 02:27:47,542
I'll go for help.

1407
02:27:51,782 --> 02:27:52,874
Father!

1408
02:27:55,686 --> 02:27:56,880
Father!

1409
02:27:56,987 --> 02:27:58,545
Father!

1410
02:28:09,666 --> 02:28:11,725
He's over here,
Reverend Quigley.

1411
02:28:13,370 --> 02:28:18,273
Why, it's Brother Quigley!
Welcome to Lahaina.

1412
02:28:18,876 --> 02:28:20,400
You should have let me know
you were coming.

1413
02:28:20,510 --> 02:28:23,946
It's only for a short visit.
I'm just recently back from Boston.

1414
02:28:24,047 --> 02:28:26,015
Yes, I saw your grandparents, Micah.

1415
02:28:26,116 --> 02:28:28,710
- Who?
- The Bromleys. They send greetings.

1416
02:28:28,819 --> 02:28:31,811
Micah, take Reverend Quigley's
bag along to the house.

1417
02:28:31,922 --> 02:28:32,889
Thank you, Micah.

1418
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:34,685
Come, we have much to discuss.

1419
02:28:34,791 --> 02:28:36,759
It's lovely back in Walpole.

1420
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:39,852
I'd forgotten how beautiful
the autumns can be there.

1421
02:28:39,963 --> 02:28:42,295
Did you get back
in time for the Annual Meeting?

1422
02:28:42,399 --> 02:28:46,529
- Yes, we missed you, Brother Hale.
- Well, I was unable to get away.

1423
02:28:46,637 --> 02:28:50,505
We are engaged in a great
struggle with the sugar planters here.

1424
02:28:50,607 --> 02:28:54,737
- Yes, I've heard reports of it.
- Their lust for land grows every day.

1425
02:28:54,845 --> 02:28:58,042
I finished helping my Hawaiians
draft a petition to the king

1426
02:28:58,148 --> 02:29:01,549
that no more land be sold
to the planters or any other foreigner.

1427
02:29:01,652 --> 02:29:02,880
- Indeed?
- Yes.

1428
02:29:02,986 --> 02:29:06,854
And also we are assembling regularly
in meetings of public protest.

1429
02:29:06,957 --> 02:29:09,551
- In your church?
- Yes, of course!

1430
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:12,458
What purer purpose
can our churches be put to

1431
02:29:12,562 --> 02:29:15,292
than to protect the Hawaiians' land?

1432
02:29:15,399 --> 02:29:18,095
Their land is their life,
Brother Quigley.

1433
02:29:18,201 --> 02:29:19,828
Malama understood that.

1434
02:29:19,937 --> 02:29:23,236
Every church in the kingdom
must stand forth as a bastion

1435
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:26,400
against those who would rob
these people of their birthright.

1436
02:29:27,678 --> 02:29:30,374
And the walls are two feet thick.

1437
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:32,812
As you see, of course.

1438
02:29:33,784 --> 02:29:37,413
I left the windows uncovered, though.
It's cooler that way.

1439
02:29:37,521 --> 02:29:39,716
And the wind...

1440
02:29:40,624 --> 02:29:42,251
can blow through.

1441
02:29:44,561 --> 02:29:49,021
Of course, there is no Alii Nui...
left to die.

1442
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:55,163
They develop
shocking temperatures.

1443
02:29:55,839 --> 02:29:59,138
That's why it's unhealthy for them
to work in the cane fields.

1444
02:29:59,242 --> 02:30:03,542
I've seen as many as 40 Hawaiians
hitched to ploughs.

1445
02:30:03,647 --> 02:30:05,638
Sugar is a curse on these people.

1446
02:30:05,749 --> 02:30:09,515
We reviewed the whole problem
of sugar at the Annual Meeting.

1447
02:30:10,053 --> 02:30:11,418
Came to some conclusions
about it.

1448
02:30:11,521 --> 02:30:13,512
Very good, excellent!
Tell me.

1449
02:30:13,623 --> 02:30:18,822
It is felt the time has come for
our missions to become self-supporting.

1450
02:30:18,929 --> 02:30:22,558
To that end, we voted
to authorize members of our ministry

1451
02:30:22,666 --> 02:30:25,533
to invest in plantation lands
and sugar mills

1452
02:30:25,635 --> 02:30:28,627
and to operate them also,
if they have the skill.

1453
02:30:31,341 --> 02:30:33,036
But we are a family...

1454
02:30:34,077 --> 02:30:35,408
in Christ.

1455
02:30:36,179 --> 02:30:38,044
Dedicated to poverty.

1456
02:30:38,148 --> 02:30:42,881
It has cost us 20 years
of poverty and sickness

1457
02:30:42,986 --> 02:30:47,150
and sometimes death, to win these people
to Christianity and make them literate.

1458
02:30:47,257 --> 02:30:50,784
If we now desire
a competence for our old age,

1459
02:30:50,894 --> 02:30:54,295
a heritage for our children,
we have every right to earn it.

1460
02:31:05,008 --> 02:31:08,739
We are taking the land

1461
02:31:08,845 --> 02:31:11,871
of the people whose souls
we came to save

1462
02:31:12,883 --> 02:31:15,750
while they are dying.

1463
02:31:15,852 --> 02:31:19,652
A whole race is dying
before our eyes.

1464
02:31:20,724 --> 02:31:22,453
I'm afraid that is true.

1465
02:31:23,860 --> 02:31:26,556
But the Lord's ways
are not our ways.

1466
02:31:26,663 --> 02:31:28,494
And the only answer that I can find

1467
02:31:28,598 --> 02:31:31,590
is that perhaps the Lord
intends for these islands

1468
02:31:31,701 --> 02:31:34,135
gradually to pass into other hands.

1469
02:31:36,706 --> 02:31:38,469
May God forgive you!

1470
02:31:44,815 --> 02:31:47,249
There is a feeling

1471
02:31:47,350 --> 02:31:51,377
that you've worn yourself out
in God's service, Brother Hale.

1472
02:31:51,488 --> 02:31:53,479
The church wishes to reward your labors

1473
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:56,081
with something
more substantial than gratitude.

1474
02:31:57,727 --> 02:32:00,696
But l... reward?

1475
02:32:00,797 --> 02:32:03,595
The Board of Commissioners
has appointed you

1476
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:06,897
to the pulpit of Regents Church
in New Surrey, Connecticut.

1477
02:32:09,706 --> 02:32:11,537
Forgive me, I don't quite...

1478
02:32:12,309 --> 02:32:14,675
A comfortable residence
adjoins the church,

1479
02:32:14,778 --> 02:32:16,609
and the stipend is quite reasonable.

1480
02:32:19,049 --> 02:32:22,712
You are taking my church...
away from me.

1481
02:32:22,819 --> 02:32:26,812
Not at all! You are simply being called
to a better one in New England.

1482
02:32:26,923 --> 02:32:31,053
Brother R.S. Bonham has been transferred
from Kauai to succeed you here.

1483
02:32:32,429 --> 02:32:37,662
You are taking my church...
away from me.

1484
02:32:39,803 --> 02:32:44,137
Passage on the Bigahtihe Eueka
has been arranged for you and your family.

1485
02:32:44,241 --> 02:32:46,709
She sails
Tuesday afternoon for Boston.

1486
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:49,843
No.

1487
02:32:50,814 --> 02:32:53,078
I'm afraid
the decision is already made.

1488
02:32:55,185 --> 02:32:58,552
The Annual Meeting
commissioned a tablet

1489
02:32:58,655 --> 02:33:01,647
to be placed in this church
commemorating your ministry.

1490
02:33:08,198 --> 02:33:11,463
My ministry here is not ended.

1491
02:33:12,936 --> 02:33:15,996
If I no longer can preach
in my own church,

1492
02:33:17,541 --> 02:33:19,475
I will preach somewhere else.

1493
02:33:20,510 --> 02:33:22,808
In the streets, if necessary.

1494
02:33:22,913 --> 02:33:25,643
But I will preach.

1495
02:33:27,117 --> 02:33:30,814
You understand, of course,
you'll get no sustenance from us.

1496
02:33:30,921 --> 02:33:33,412
Yes, yes,
I would certainly understand that!

1497
02:33:34,491 --> 02:33:37,619
Very well, I'll arrange passage
for three instead of four.

1498
02:33:37,727 --> 02:33:40,218
- Three?
- The children.

1499
02:33:40,330 --> 02:33:43,458
Since the death of Sister Jerusha, they
must have been a heavy burden for you.

1500
02:33:46,336 --> 02:33:49,464
They are good children.
They comfort me.

1501
02:33:49,573 --> 02:33:53,065
The time has come for them to complete
their education in New England.

1502
02:33:56,112 --> 02:33:58,103
Micah, yes.

1503
02:33:58,215 --> 02:34:00,479
He's well prepared for Yale.

1504
02:34:02,052 --> 02:34:04,418
But David and Lucy...

1505
02:34:04,521 --> 02:34:07,490
No, Brother Quigley,
they're too young.

1506
02:34:07,591 --> 02:34:10,788
Their grandparents in Walpole
have offered them a home.

1507
02:34:10,894 --> 02:34:15,524
They'll get proper shelter, food,
education, a chance for happiness.

1508
02:34:15,632 --> 02:34:18,430
With no support here,
what can you offer them?

1509
02:34:19,436 --> 02:34:20,926
What will happen to them?

1510
02:34:28,044 --> 02:34:29,875
I will pray on the matter,

1511
02:34:32,249 --> 02:34:33,876
Brother Quigley.

1512
02:35:06,716 --> 02:35:08,843
May the Lord go with you, Lucy.

1513
02:35:09,486 --> 02:35:10,976
Good-bye, Father.

1514
02:35:14,624 --> 02:35:16,785
May the Lord go with you, David.

1515
02:35:16,893 --> 02:35:18,360
Bye, Father.

1516
02:35:26,202 --> 02:35:29,831
I don't like to leave you, Father.
Please let me stay.

1517
02:35:32,842 --> 02:35:34,935
When you have been
graduated from Yale,

1518
02:35:35,045 --> 02:35:38,378
you will return here
and take over my ministry.

1519
02:35:39,115 --> 02:35:40,639
God help you, son,

1520
02:35:40,750 --> 02:35:42,718
and guide your steps.

1521
02:35:42,819 --> 02:35:45,151
My hopes go with you.

1522
02:35:46,423 --> 02:35:47,856
Your mother's, too.

1523
02:35:49,559 --> 02:35:51,891
You are so like her.

1524
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:59,830
Go along, go along.

1525
02:36:05,141 --> 02:36:07,575
I wish you would reconsider,
Brother Hale.

1526
02:36:08,545 --> 02:36:12,345
You'll be alone here,
no church, no support...

1527
02:36:13,083 --> 02:36:14,550
no friends.

1528
02:36:15,618 --> 02:36:19,520
In this place,
I have known God...

1529
02:36:20,657 --> 02:36:22,488
Jerusha Bromley,

1530
02:36:23,593 --> 02:36:27,120
and Ruth Malama Kanakoa.

1531
02:36:30,033 --> 02:36:33,696
Beyond that,
a man needs no friends.

1532
02:36:37,874 --> 02:36:39,068
Good-bye, Brother Hale.

1533
02:37:00,697 --> 02:37:02,631
Don't cry, Lucy.

1534
02:37:05,268 --> 02:37:07,168
Don't cry, little girl.

1535
02:38:04,494 --> 02:38:08,055
- Makua Hale?
- Yes? Who are you? What do you want?

1536
02:38:08,164 --> 02:38:09,961
I'm Jonah Kiimalo.

1537
02:38:10,066 --> 02:38:13,900
I've been going to school in Honolulu.
You probably don't remember me.

1538
02:38:15,405 --> 02:38:16,838
No, I don't.

1539
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:20,068
I've come to ask
if I can be your assistant.

1540
02:38:21,244 --> 02:38:24,771
That's impossible.
I no longer have a church.

1541
02:38:24,881 --> 02:38:25,848
I know.

1542
02:38:25,949 --> 02:38:28,713
You'd better talk
to the new minister when he comes.

1543
02:38:28,818 --> 02:38:30,046
Reverend Bonham.

1544
02:38:30,153 --> 02:38:33,350
But I want to help in your work,
Makua Hale, not his.

1545
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:34,914
What do you mean?

1546
02:38:35,024 --> 02:38:40,189
I mean that I want to stay with you
and be of service to you.

1547
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:53,768
You... you're...
Oh, you...

1548
02:38:54,844 --> 02:38:56,038
You are...

1549
02:38:56,880 --> 02:39:00,372
I remember...
Of course, I do remember!

1550
02:39:00,483 --> 02:39:01,973
I remember!

1551
02:39:11,594 --> 02:39:13,653
Do you remember that little child...

1552
02:39:34,784 --> 02:39:36,251
You remember?
