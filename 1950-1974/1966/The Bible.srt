1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,360
In the beginning, God created
the Heaven and the Earth.

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,440
And the Earth was
without form and void...

3
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,760
...and darkness was upon the face
of the deep.

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,600
And the Spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters.

5
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,680
And God said, ''Let there be light. ''

6
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,280
And there was light.

7
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,840
And God divided the light
from the darkness.

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,920
And God called the light ''day. ''

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,360
And the darkness He called ''night. ''

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,440
And the evening and the morning
were the first day.

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,760
And God said, ''Let there be
a firmament...

12
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,320
...in the midst of the waters.

13
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,240
And let it divide the waters
from the waters. ''

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And God called
the firmament ''heaven. ''

15
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,840
And the evening and the morning
were the second day.

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,040
And God said:

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
''Let the waters under the heaven...

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,800
...be gathered together
unto one place...

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,160
...and let the dry land appear. ''

20
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,600
The gathering together
of the waters...

21
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,040
...called He ''seas. ''

22
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,880
And He called the dry land ''earth. ''

23
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,080
And God said,
''Let the earth bring forth grass...

24
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,120
... the herb yielding seed and
the fruit tree yielding fruit...

25
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
... whose seed is in itself
upon the earth. ''

26
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
And the evening and the morning
were the third day.

27
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,720
And God said, ''Let there be lights
in the firmament of the heaven...

28
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
...and let them be for signs
and for seasons...

29
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,080
...and for days and years. ''

30
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,840
And God made two great lights:

31
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,640
The greater light, to rule the day...

32
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
...and the lesser light,
to rule the night.

33
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,000
He made the stars also.

34
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,440
And God set them in the firmament
of the heaven...

35
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,320
... to give light upon the Earth.

36
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,480
And the evening and the morning
were the fourth day.

37
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,320
And God said, ''Let the waters
bring forth abundantly...

38
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,160
... the moving creature
that hath life...

39
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,560
...and fowl that fly above the earth
in the open firmament of heaven. ''

40
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,520
And God created great whales...

41
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
...and every living creature
that moveth...

42
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,400
... which the waters brought forth
abundantly after their kind.

43
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,480
God blessed them, saying:

44
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,120
''Be fruitful and multiply
and fill the waters...

45
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,080
...and the seas. ''

46
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,920
And the evening and the morning
were the fifth day.

47
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,000
And God said, ''Let the earth
bring forth...

48
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,040
... the living creature
after his kind.

49
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,520
And everything that creepeth
upon the earth after his kind...

50
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,560
...cattle and the beast of the earth
after his kind. ''

51
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,560
And God saw that it was good.

52
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,480
And God said:

53
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,520
''Let us make man in our own image...

54
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,920
...after our likeness. ''

55
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,880
The Lord God formed man
of the dust of the ground...

56
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,680
...and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life...

57
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,600
...and man became a living soul.

58
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,640
And God brought unto Adam
every beast of the field...

59
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,120
...and every fowl of the air...

60
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
... to see what he would call them.

61
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,920
And the Lord said:

62
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,000
''It is not good that the man
should be alone. ''

63
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,240
And He caused a deep sleep
to fall upon Adam.

64
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,720
And he slept.

65
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,840
And God made a woman
and brought her unto the man.

66
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,360
This is now bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh.

67
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
So God created man
in His own image...

68
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,800
...in the image of God
created He him...

69
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,480
...male and female created He them.

70
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,520
And God saw everything
that He had made...

71
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,640
...and behold, it was very good.

72
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,640
And the evening and the morning
were the sixth day.

73
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,440
And on the seventh day God rested...

74
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,360
...from all His work
which He had made.

75
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,800
And God blessed the seventh day
and sanctified it.

76
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,720
Eastward, in Eden,
God had planted a garden.

77
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,400
And He said, ''Go into the garden
I have made.

78
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,880
Tend it and keep it.

79
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,240
Of every tree of the garden
thou mayest freely eat.

80
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,840
But of the Tree of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil...

81
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,880
... thou shalt not eat of it.

82
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,280
For in the day
that thou eatest thereof...

83
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,920
... thou shalt surely die. ''

84
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
And God blessed them
and said unto them:

85
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
''Be fruitful and multiply. ''

86
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,240
Eve. . . .

87
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,040
Eve. . . .

88
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,520
Eve. . . .

89
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,680
Hath God said. . .

90
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
. . .ye shall not eat of every tree
in the garden?

91
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,640
We may eat of the fruit of the trees
of the garden. . .

92
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,720
. . .but of the fruit of this tree
God hath said:

93
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,680
''Ye shall not eat of it. . .

94
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,720
. . .neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die. ''

95
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,600
Ye shall not surely die.

96
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,720
For God doth know that in the day
ye eat thereof. . .

97
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,440
. . .then your eyes shall be opened. . .

98
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,760
. . .and ye shall be as gods. . .

99
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,000
. . .knowing good and evil.

100
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,680
The serpent hath said
that we shall not die. . .

101
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,960
. . .that our eyes shall be opened
and we shall be as gods.

102
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,400
Taste it. There's no harm.

103
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,960
lt is. . .

104
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
. . .disobedience.

105
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,120
lt will make us wise.

106
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,040
And the Lord God called unto Adam:

107
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,120
''Where art thou?''

108
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,040
l heard thy voice and l was afraid
because l was naked, and l hid myself.

109
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,960
Who told thee that thou wast naked?

110
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
Hast thou eaten of the tree...

111
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,000
... whereof I commanded thee
that thou shouldst not eat?

112
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,280
The woman thou gavest to be with me. . .

113
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,080
. . .she gave me of the tree,
and l did eat.

114
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,280
What is it that thou hast done?

115
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,800
The serpent beguiled me and l did eat.

116
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,480
Because thou hast done this...

117
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,440
... thou art cursed above all cattle...

118
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,800
...and above every beast of the field.

119
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,760
Upon thy belly shalt thou go...

120
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,320
...and dust shalt thou eat
all the days of thy life.

121
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,760
I will put enmity between thee
and the woman...

122
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,560
...between thy seed and her seed.

123
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,040
It shall bruise thy head...

124
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,000
...and thou shalt bruise his heel.

125
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Eve...

126
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,000
...I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
and thy conception.

127
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,320
In sorrow shalt thou bring forth
children...

128
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,720
...and thy desire shall be
to thy husband...

129
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,320
...and he shall rule over thee.

130
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,360
Adam, because thou hast harkened
unto thy wife...

131
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,840
...and hast eaten of the tree...

132
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,880
...cursed is the ground
for thy sake...

133
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,560
...in sorrow shalt thou eat of it
all the days of thy life...

134
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,480
... thorns also and thistles
shall it bring forth to thee.

135
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,920
Thou shalt eat the herb
of the field.

136
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,480
In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread...

137
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,600
...until thou returnest
unto the ground.

138
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,520
For out of it was thou taken.
For dust thou art...

139
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,360
...and unto dust shalt thou return.

140
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,080
l have made a man from the Lord God.

141
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,960
Thy name shall be called Cain.

142
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,800
And the meaning of Cain
is ''possession. ''

143
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,920
Eve again bare a son...

144
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,480
...and his name was Abel...

145
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,560
... which means ''breath of life. ''

146
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,040
And the children of Eve
grew to be men.

147
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,080
Cain was a tiller of the ground...

148
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,520
...and Abel was a keeper of flocks.

149
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,160
At the time of the harvest,
they builded altars...

150
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,240
...and kindled fires upon them.

151
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,120
And Abel brought of the firstlings
of his flock...

152
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,400
...and the fat thereof.

153
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,120
And Cain also brought of the fruit
of the ground...

154
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,640
...an offering unto the Lord.

155
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,920
And the Lord had respect unto Abel
and his offering.

156
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,920
But unto Cain and his offering
He had not respect.

157
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,160
Why art thou angry?

158
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,840
lf thou doest well,
shalt thou not be accepted?

159
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
Cain?

160
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,240
Cain.

161
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,720
Where is Abel, thy brother?

162
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,000
l know not!

163
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,800
Where is Abel, thy brother?

164
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,080
Am l my brother's keeper?

165
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,520
What hast thou done?

166
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
The voice of thy brother's blood...

167
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,440
...crieth unto me from the ground.

168
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,680
Now art thou cursed from the Earth...

169
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,280
... which hath opened to receive
thy brother's blood from thy hand.

170
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,800
When thou tillest the ground...

171
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,800
...it shall not yield
unto thee her strength.

172
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,160
A fugitive and a vagabond
shalt thou be in the Earth.

173
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,080
For dust thou art and unto dust
shalt thou return.

174
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
My punishment is greater
than l can bear!

175
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,520
Thou hast driven me out this day
from the face of the Earth. . .

176
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,600
. . .and from thy face shall l be hid.

177
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,000
And l shall be a fugitive
and a vagabond in the Earth. . .

178
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,280
. . .and everyone that findeth me
shall slay me!

179
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,760
Whosoever slayeth Cain...

180
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,680
... vengeance shall be taken
on him sevenfold.

181
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,840
I set a mark upon Cain...

182
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,000
...lest any, finding him,
shall slay him.

183
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,640
And Cain left the presence
of the Lord...

184
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,000
...and dwelt in the Land of Nod,
east of Eden.

185
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,040
And Cain knew his wife,
and she conceived and bare a son.

186
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
In the generations of time...

187
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,280
... when his seed began
to people the Earth...

188
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,240
... there were born men
apt in knowledge and craft.

189
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,480
As Jabal, the father of such
as dwell in tents...

190
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,840
...and of such as have cattle.

191
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,240
They made vessels out of the earth...

192
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,480
...jars and pitchers by the skill
of their hands.

193
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,320
And Jabal's brother's name was Jubal.

194
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,400
He was the father of all such
as handle the harp and play music.

195
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,840
And Tubalcain, also...

196
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,920
...an instructor of every artificer
in brass and iron.

197
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,960
And they learnt the secrets
of the ground...

198
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,240
... that it should deliver to them
its fullness and strength.

199
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,840
But the knowledge of good and evil
was in all the people of the Earth.

200
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,800
And God grieved in His heart that men
followed the way of evil...

201
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,280
...and that every imagination...

202
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,280
...of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil, continually.

203
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,480
The Earth disclosed her blood...

204
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,840
...and no more covered her slain.

205
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,160
The deed of Cain was multiplied
a thousand times.

206
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,760
And God said, ''I will destroy man,
whom I have created...

207
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,080
...both man and beast, for it
repenteth me that I hath made them. ''

208
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,960
But the Lord gave Eve another son...

209
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,520
...instead of Abel whom Cain slew.

210
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,760
And Adam called his name Seth.

211
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,560
And from Seth 's seed,
through the generations...

212
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,240
... was Noah born.

213
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,080
And Noah found grace
in the eyes of the Lord.

214
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,360
There dwelt with Noah
his sons: Shem...

215
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
...Japheth and Ham.

216
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,560
And his wife,
and his sons ' wives also.

217
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,720
And Noah was perfect
in his generations.

218
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,280
He was a just man,
and walked with God.

219
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,480
Noah.

220
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,400
Noah.

221
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,800
Noah!

222
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,840
Hearken now to my voice
and take heed.

223
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,240
Now shall I tell thee
the matter of my grief...

224
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,080
...and of what thou shalt do.

225
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,040
The end of all flesh
is come before me...

226
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,160
...for the Earth is filled
with violence through them.

227
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,480
And behold, I will bring a flood
of waters upon the Earth...

228
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,600
... to destroy all flesh.

229
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,960
And everything that is
in the Earth shall die.

230
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Make thee an ark of gopher wood.

231
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,760
Rooms shalt thou make...

232
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,560
...and shalt pitch it within and
without with pitch.

233
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,480
And this is the fashion
thou shalt make it of.

234
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,600
The length of the ark shall be
300 cubits...

235
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,960
... the breadth of it 50 cubits...

236
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,000
...and the height of it 30 cubits.

237
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,640
With thee will I establish
my covenant.

238
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Thou shalt come into the ark.

239
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,400
Thou and thy sons and thy wife,
and thy sons ' wives with thee.

240
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,560
For thee have I seen righteous
before me in this generation.

241
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,280
What is more stupid than this?

242
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,600
A man building a ship on dry land!

243
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,000
A devil is in him
and hath made him mad. . .

244
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,360
. . .and his sons with him!

245
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,640
When shall the Earth see this again?

246
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,320
He hath the sea in his head,
and his house rides up on the waves.

247
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,080
Father, is it indeed God's voice
thou hast heard?

248
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,680
For look, there is no cloud
in the sky.

249
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,760
Not so much as would cover a bird.

250
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,320
The Lord waiteth upon our work.

251
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,840
Then what need is there of haste?
Shall we not do it little by little. . .

252
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,520
. . .under cover of night?

253
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,440
He demandeth every hour of the day.

254
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,040
ln our obedience must be no delay.

255
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,680
Will you question your father's
understanding or doubt his ways?

256
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,320
You should be ashamed.

257
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,200
Yet when shall they be rid
of the work?

258
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,120
All things wait for this.

259
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,880
The ground is unsown,
and the house is unmended.

260
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,640
Give me one to make the roof good. . .

261
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,000
. . .lest when the rain comes the house
will not keep it out.

262
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,960
But, wife!

263
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,680
Shem!

264
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,960
More pitch!

265
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,560
Ham!

266
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,240
We have need of more pitch!

267
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,160
Japheth!

268
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,880
Take the bucket and fill it,
and our work is done!

269
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,920
Shem!

270
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,640
Ham!

271
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,680
Japheth!

272
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,240
Noah.

273
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,840
Come thou and all thy house
into the ark.

274
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,240
I will cause it to rain upon
the Earth 40 days and 40 nights.

275
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,040
Every living substance I have made...

276
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,520
... will I destroy from off
the face of the Earth.

277
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,960
And of every living thing
of all flesh...

278
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,080
... two of every sort,
male and female...

279
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,800
...shalt thou bring into the ark
to keep them alive with thee.

280
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,920
Two. . .

281
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,440
. . .of every sort.

282
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,360
Wife!

283
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,680
Sons! Daughters!

284
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,760
Fear not.
The Lord hath spoken and said:

285
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,720
''Bring two of every kind
to keep them alive. ''

286
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,480
They have followed me and trust us. . .

287
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,400
. . .to mind them and bring them
to safety.

288
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,320
They're good beasts at heart.

289
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,960
They will do no harm to you,
nor each other. . .

290
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,440
. . .for they know of the waters
that will fall upon the Earth.

291
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,960
And God hath chosen them
above all others.

292
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,120
There are more yet to come.
Japheth, help them find their way.

293
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,800
Ham, Shem, load hay and grain.

294
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,960
Wife and daughters,
put oil into the lamps.

295
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,680
And get thy house aboard
the ark in order.

296
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,000
And God shut him in.

297
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,160
ls it the wind that waileth?

298
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,440
No, wife.

299
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,800
lt is the chaff, which
the wind driveth away.

300
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,360
The Lord hath taken hold
of the ends of the Earth. . .

301
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,880
. . .and shaketh it.

302
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,120
They cry to be fed.

303
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,160
We have work to do.

304
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,920
Shem. . .

305
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,240
. . .care for the animals with
hooves that cheweth the cud.

306
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,680
Ham shall tend the camels,
hares, swine and giraffes.

307
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,000
Japheth, the tigers, the lions,
the cats of all kinds.

308
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,000
What shall they eat?

309
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,600
Milk from the cattle and the goats.

310
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,960
Milk? For beasts of prey?

311
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,680
They're only great cats, wife.

312
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,440
Do you not hear them purr?

313
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,520
Be not afraid. He will do thee no
harm, for harm is not in him.

314
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:12,560
Shem, the red hart has not eaten
of his corn. Fetch him leaves.

315
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,280
The waters prevailed, and all the
high hills were covered.

316
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,160
And Noah only remained alive...

317
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,800
...and they that were
with him in the ark.

318
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,160
When will the rain cease?

319
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,680
When shall we stand again
upon the Earth?

320
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,160
God has told us it shall rain
40 days and 40 nights.

321
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,920
But here we know
neither the day nor the night.

322
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,840
We cannot measure the time by sleep.

323
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,880
We sleep when we will.
When we are rested, we wake.

324
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,800
The moon has no waxing or waning. . .

325
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,400
. . .and the sun no rising or setting.

326
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,080
-We are without knowledge of time.
-Nay, but l know.

327
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,120
Since the time we came into the ark. . .

328
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,560
. . .and the doors shut, and the flood
carried us upon its waters. . .

329
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,840
. . .the days have been 20.

330
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,640
-And two.
-Twenty and two.

331
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,720
How dost thou know
what is hidden from us?

332
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,240
By what rod dost thou
measure the darkness?

333
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,320
By the beasts,
who carry the days within them.

334
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,040
Even as the sun and the moon
divide the seasons into hours.

335
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,400
l know the time by the lowing
of the cow ready to be milked. . .

336
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,520
. . .and the cackle of the hen when
the egg shall be gathered.

337
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:26,040
l have counted the days.

338
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,560
ln 1 8 days, then, we'll know
the world as before.

339
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,800
Not so. When the rain stops,
still the water will cover the earth.

340
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,720
Neither shall we know
the world as before.

341
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,840
When the waters are dried up. . .

342
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,040
. . .then we shall know.

343
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,840
We shall be alone on the Earth.

344
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,480
No other life.

345
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,120
Where will the ark have carried us?

346
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,080
ln what strange land
shall we be renewed?

347
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,240
The Lord has put
the future into our hands.

348
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,520
All things will be new.

349
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,000
Raven!

350
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,760
And Noah sent forth a raven...

351
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,360
... to see if the waters were abated
from off the ground.

352
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,800
Go forth!

353
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,480
And the raven went forth,
and flew to and fro.

354
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,640
Even until the waters were
dried up from off the Earth.

355
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,800
And the raven returned not
again unto Noah anymore.

356
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,920
Also he sent forth a dove from him.

357
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,440
But the Earth was still seas...

358
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,880
...as it had been in the beginning,
before the dry land appeared.

359
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,480
She hath found no rest
for the sole of her foot.

360
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,960
For the waters are on the
face of the whole Earth.

361
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,240
Eat of the grain
and renew thy strength.

362
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,280
For in seven days l shall send
thee forth again.

363
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,800
And the dove came in to him
in the evening...

364
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,840
...and lo, in her mouth was
an olive leaf, plucked off.

365
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,640
Let us make a rudder and a sail.

366
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,600
For now we know that the waters are
abated from the Earth. . .

367
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,480
. . .and we can find land.

368
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:20,800
What sail shall discover the winds,
and what rudder find our course?

369
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,320
The breath of God
shall divide the waves. . .

370
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,720
. . .and his hand only
lead us into safety.

371
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,800
And the ark rested in the seventh
month, of the 1 7th day of the month...

372
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,920
...upon the mountains of Ararat.

373
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,440
And the Lord said in his heart:

374
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:58,400
''I will not again curse
the ground for man 's sake.

375
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,680
While the Earth remaineth,
seed-time and harvest...

376
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,160
...cold and heat, summer
and winter, and day and night...

377
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,880
...shall not cease.

378
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:14,160
The waters shall no more become
a flood to destroy all flesh.

379
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,320
I do set my bow in the cloud.

380
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,880
And it shall be for a token
between me and the Earth.

381
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,960
It shall come to pass
when I bring a cloud...

382
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,560
... the bow shall
be seen in the cloud.

383
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,720
And I will remember my covenant
which is between me and you.

384
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,860
And every living
creature of all flesh. ''

385
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,700
And sons were born unto the sons
of Noah after the flood.

386
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:15,020
And of them was the
whole Earth overspread.

387
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:19,940
And the whole Earth was of one
language and of one speech.

388
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:24,180
Now these are the generations
of the sons of Noah.

389
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,700
The sons of Japheth: Gomer....

390
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,620
The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur....

391
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:34,660
And the sons of Ham: Mizraim, Phut,
Canaan and Cush.

392
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,660
And Cush begat Nimrod.

393
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:40,780
And Nimrod was a king.

394
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:45,780
And he set to build a tower
that would soar like his pride.

395
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,980
A tower that would reach unto Heaven.

396
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,980
And his people sang a song
as they built the tower:

397
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:15,740
''Who can bend the bow of Nimrod?

398
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:20,460
Or put strength into the arrow
like unto his strength?

399
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:23,940
Nothing is too mighty for him to do

400
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:27,300
No power is greater than his

401
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,820
He hath taken the Earth
and made it his own

402
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:35,580
He stores up the thunder and wears
the lightning like a jewel

403
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:40,060
The glory of Nimrod
shines beyond the sun

404
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,980
There is none greater
than he in Earth or Heaven. ''

405
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:34,060
And the Lord came down
to see the tower...

406
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:37,140
... which the children
of men builded.

407
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:42,700
And He said,
''Behold, the people is one...

408
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,980
...and they have all one language.
And this they begin to do.

409
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:51,740
And now nothing will
be restrained from them...

410
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:54,620
... which they have imagined to do. ''

411
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,260
My bow.

412
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,660
''Let us go down and confound
their language...

413
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,700
... that they may not understand
one another's speech. ''

414
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,940
Stand your ground. Obey me!

415
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,940
Make good what has been brought down.

416
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:57,980
Am l not Nimrod?
And my voice is your commandment!

417
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,220
What words are these?

418
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,060
Babbling fool!
Madness is in his mouth!

419
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,820
You mock your king's tongue?

420
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,500
Shall a monkey gibber against me?

421
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:42,340
Therefore is the name of it
called Babel.

422
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,940
There the Lord confounded
their language...

423
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:49,980
...and scattered them abroad
upon the Earth.

424
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,700
The Lord waited 1 0 generations
for a man called Abram to be born.

425
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:39,900
He was born in Ur of the Chaldees.

426
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:43,260
And when he had come of an age,
the Lord said:

427
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,940
''Get out of thy city
and thy country...

428
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,380
...from thy kindred
and from thy father's house...

429
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:52,340
...unto a land that I will show thee.

430
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:55,780
I will make of thee a great nation...

431
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,780
...and I will bless thee
and make thy name great. ''

432
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:06,940
So Abram departed, as the Lord
had spoken unto him...

433
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,500
... with Lot, his brother's son...

434
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:12,780
...and Sarai, his wife,
whom he loved...

435
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:16,140
...and all their substance
that they gathered...

436
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,620
...and the souls they had gotten...

437
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:22,500
...and they journeyed
like strangers on the Earth.

438
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:41,900
They journeyed not knowing
whither they went.

439
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,500
And yet the land lay before them
as the Lord had promised.

440
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:50,100
And the mornings and the evenings
pointed the way.

441
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,100
Come! Come!

442
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,700
The hills revealed it.

443
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:22,020
Lift up now thine eyes...

444
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:25,220
...and look from the place
where thou art...

445
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:28,020
...northward and southward...

446
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,580
...and eastward and westward...

447
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,100
...for all the land
which thou seest...

448
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,460
... to thee will I give it...

449
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,420
...and to thy seed forever.

450
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,500
Shall we indeed inherit
this country in peace?

451
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:01,100
For the Canaanites go about the land.

452
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:05,140
The understanding of God. . .

453
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,780
. . .is not our understanding.

454
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:12,220
And what shall be brought about
and how it is perfected. . .

455
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:15,700
. . .is not in our power to know.

456
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,980
Only in the promise
of what shall come. . .

457
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:23,100
. . .can we prosper.

458
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,900
And in that trust. . .

459
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:31,180
. . .have we pitched our tents.

460
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,620
Wife.

461
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,340
Abram.

462
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,460
My husband.

463
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:15,860
The sun has gone down.
We have labored until evening.

464
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,860
l bring my love beside you
in the tent. . .

465
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,060
. . .as day answereth day.

466
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:30,220
Let my beloved come into his garden
and eat his pleasant fruits.

467
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,020
Behold.

468
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,420
Thou art fair, my love.

469
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,140
Behold, thou art fair.

470
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:59,460
l have drawn away from my beauty
as from a stranger. . .

471
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:03,260
. . .for the years have gone with
the going down of the sun.

472
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:07,940
Your beauty stands in a sanctuary.

473
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,260
The enemy falters in the street. . .

474
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,740
. . .and sheathes his sword
in the marketplace.

475
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,060
Time. . .

476
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,580
. . .cannot pass the door.

477
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,900
The strong lock of the door is love. . .

478
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,340
. . .and the key. . .

479
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,300
. . .is in my hand.

480
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:44,460
As the apple tree among
the trees of the wood. . .

481
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,260
. . .so is my beloved among the sons.

482
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,820
His left hand is under my head. . .

483
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:55,860
. . .and his right hand doth embrace me.

484
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,460
My right arm covers you. . .

485
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,780
. . .as the night covers the day.

486
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,940
But Sarai, his wife, was barren...

487
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:10,900
...and she had no child.

488
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:18,580
Yet was the land before them
as God had promised.

489
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:23,740
And they pitched their tents
in the length and breadth of it...

490
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:28,860
...from Bethel to Kadesh and Shur,
even unto Egypt.

491
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,300
With Sarai came also her handmaid...

492
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,940
...Hagar, the Egyptian.

493
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,180
They learned the wells
and fertile places...

494
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,540
Five score.

495
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:53,820
...and Abram prospered.

496
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,740
Six score.

497
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,140
Seven score.

498
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,780
And when they came again
unto Bethel...

499
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:26,780
... there was division between
the herdsmen of Abram's cattle...

500
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:29,620
...and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle.

501
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:46,420
Let there be no strife
between thee and me.

502
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:52,660
And between thy herdsmen
and my herdsmen, for we are brethren.

503
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:02,580
Our substance is too great
for us to dwell together.

504
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,820
The land is not able
to bear us together.

505
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:15,700
ls not the whole land before thee?

506
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,540
Separate thyself,
l pray thee, from me.

507
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:23,020
lf thou will go left,
l will go to the right. . .

508
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:27,100
. . .or if thou go right,
l will go to the left.

509
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,900
There below us is the plain of Jordan.

510
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:38,020
And that way l will go.

511
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:41,300
Toward the cities of the plain.

512
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:47,300
The men of the cities are wicked,
and sinners before the Lord.

513
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:52,100
From here the walls of Sodom and
Gomorrah are white.

514
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,860
But within the walls. . .

515
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,180
. . .is the darkness of men.

516
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:02,380
Many tribes and their kings try
to claim their domination. . .

517
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,300
. . .and the city walls are refuge
and strength.

518
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:08,060
God is my refuge and strength.

519
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:12,500
The plain is well-watered
everywhere. . .

520
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,580
. . .fertile with fruits of the earth. . .

521
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:20,700
. . .even as the Garden of the Lord.
That is the way l shall take.

522
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:28,700
And my way is another.

523
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:30,340
Lift up now thine eyes...

524
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:33,580
...and look from the place
where thou art...

525
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:38,300
...northward and southward
and eastward and westward.

526
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,060
For all the land which thou seest...

527
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:46,940
... to thee will I give it
and to thy seed forever.

528
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:53,060
Lord God, what wilt thou give me,
seeing l go childless?

529
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:58,780
Behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

530
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:04,220
I will make thy seed
as the dust of the Earth...

531
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:07,580
...so that if one can number
the dust of the Earth...

532
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:11,660
... then shall thy seed
also be numbered.

533
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:17,700
But Sarai, my wife, is barren
and she has no child.

534
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:21,020
I am the Lord that brought thee...

535
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:23,620
...out of Ur of the Chaldees...

536
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:27,420
... to give thee this land
to inherit it.

537
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,740
Lord God. . .

538
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:35,380
. . .whereby shall l know
that l shall inherit it?

539
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,860
Take me a heifer
of three years old...

540
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:49,820
...and a she-goat of three years old
and a ram of three years old...

541
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:52,780
...and a turtledove
and a young pigeon.

542
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,300
Divide them in the midst...

543
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:58,660
...and lay each piece
one against another.

544
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:02,460
But the birds,
they shall not be divided.

545
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:10,060
Now have I made my covenant
between me and thee...

546
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:13,780
...and out of thine own bowels
thou shalt have an heir.

547
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:17,660
And Isaac shall his name be called.

548
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,740
Yet know of a surety that thy seed...

549
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:25,100
...shall be a stranger in a land
that is not theirs.

550
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,420
Its rulers shall afflict them...

551
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:31,260
...pangs and sorrows
shall take hold of them.

552
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:35,020
They shall be in pain
as a woman that travaileth.

553
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:38,300
They shall be tried,
like metal in a furnace...

554
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,660
...as also I shall try thee.

555
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:47,060
I will make a man more precious
than fine gold...

556
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,460
...even a man than
the golden wedge of Ophir.

557
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:01,220
Go.

558
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,260
Go.

559
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:52,820
Abram.

560
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,420
Behold now.

561
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:02,540
The Lord hath restrained me
from bearing.

562
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,860
l pray thee. . .

563
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:09,860
. . .go in unto my maid. . .

564
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,540
. . .according to that law which says:

565
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,100
''When a wife is barren. . .

566
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:19,260
. . .her maidservant may bear for her. ''

567
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:23,780
lt may be that l may obtain
children by her.

568
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:32,820
l give thee my handmaiden. . .

569
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:36,660
. . .Hagar the Egyptian. . .

570
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:40,740
. . .to be thy wife.

571
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:44,420
ls it so. . .

572
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:49,140
. . .that the promise of many nations
shall be fulfilled?

573
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:52,980
Even so. . . .

574
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:21,460
And Abram went in to Hagar
and she conceived...

575
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,780
...and when it came near the time
that she should bear a child...

576
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:32,820
... Sarai, her mistress,
was despised in her eyes.

577
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,300
Are you not tired?

578
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,860
Let us stay our hands. . .

579
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:11,580
. . .and eat and drink,
now that the sun is gone.

580
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,500
Fruits of thy kind.

581
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,140
Figs that are dry,
and dates and raisins.

582
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,420
But for me. . .

583
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:05,420
. . .the fruits that ripen.

584
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:13,740
Go away from me!

585
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:41,220
Why weepest thou?

586
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:47,020
l am ashamed.

587
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,060
For what cause?

588
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:58,260
Did l not say to thee:

589
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:03,020
''Go in to my maid that l may
obtain children by her''?

590
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:05,180
Even so?

591
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:11,620
Now l am despised by her that
she carries the child in her body.

592
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:17,660
l am but the grass that is bruised
where she walks.

593
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:24,060
l look through her eyes and see myself
as one who no longer lives.

594
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:28,660
The fulfillment of the earth
passes to strangers.

595
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:37,380
And l am left as l was never born.

596
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,180
But the child is thine. . .

597
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:47,460
. . .by thy maidservant. . .

598
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,580
. . .and by the love l bear thee.

599
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:59,860
From the south,
even unto the plain of Jordan...

600
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:03,060
...came four warring kings:

601
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:06,660
The kings of Shinar,
of Ellasar...

602
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:11,220
...of Elam, and Tidal,
king of nations.

603
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:14,220
These made war with
the king of Sodom...

604
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:17,740
...and the king of Gomorrah
and the king of Admah...

605
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:21,380
...and the king of Zeboiim
and the king of Zoar.

606
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:24,300
Four kings with five.

607
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:28,060
They joined battle
in the vale of Siddim.

608
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:33,780
The vale of Siddim
was full of slime pits...

609
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:38,580
...and the kings of Sodom
and Gomorrah fled and fell there...

610
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:43,860
...and the victors took captives
and goods and went their way.

611
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,820
And Lot?

612
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:54,420
And Lot, my brother's son, Lot?

613
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,860
He is taken captive.

614
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:08,020
Shall the land that is promised to us
have no peace?

615
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:12,620
And my blood be taken into slavery?

616
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:18,780
-Eliezer.
-My lord?

617
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:23,100
Summon Mamre, the Amorite. . .

618
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:27,060
. . .and Aner and Eshcol, his brothers
who are confederates.

619
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,460
And you, my trained servants. . .

620
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:31,780
. . .born in mine own house. . .

621
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:34,420
. . .gather at the tents.

622
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:36,100
Three hundred eighteen we be.

623
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:39,100
How shall we prevail against so many?

624
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:43,460
They have gotten the victory,
and left off watching.

625
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:48,540
l will divide us
against them by night. . .

626
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,580
. . .and smite them.

627
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:50,220
Blessed be the most high God. . .

628
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:53,660
. . .which hath delivered mine enemies
into my hands.

629
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:59,620
Thou art my shield and
my exceeding great reward.

630
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:13,700
I am the Almighty God.

631
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:17,900
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

632
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:21,420
Thy name shall no more be Abram...

633
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:24,260
...but thy name shall be Abraham.

634
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:27,620
For kings shall come out of thee...

635
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:31,820
...and I will establish
my covenant between me and thee...

636
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:36,860
...and thy seed after thee, and their
generations, to be their God.

637
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:44,060
As for Sarai, thy wife,
thou shalt not call her name Sarai...

638
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:46,780
...but Sarah shall her name be.

639
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:51,260
And I will bless her and give thee
a son, also of her.

640
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:54,260
And she shall be a mother of nations.

641
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:02,020
Thy child.

642
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:06,140
By my maidservant, and
by the love l bear thee.

643
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:16,100
The smell of my son is like a field
which the Lord has blessed.

644
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:22,540
This is my covenant, which ye
shall keep between me and you...

645
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:24,860
...and thy seed after thee.

646
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:30,380
Every man-child among you
shall be circumcised...

647
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:34,380
...as a token of the covenant
betwixt me and you.

648
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:44,380
Thou hast 24 score and 7
in thy flock.

649
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:54,020
By each pebble l know you
as good servants.

650
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:59,260
You are blessed among us
and are indeed our blessing.

651
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:08,300
My lord.

652
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:17,140
Behold. Thy son, lshmael,
hath seven years.

653
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:19,580
Give him thy blessing, l pray. . .

654
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:25,620
. . .that he may live before God as the
first of thy flesh, and thy only son.

655
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:31,380
Yet have l told thee how it stands
between me and lshmael.

656
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:36,580
For God hath said He will bless
Sarah and give me a son also. . .

657
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:38,100
. . .of her.

658
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:43,820
Wilt thou indeed believe
what cannot come to pass?

659
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:47,860
The years have gone by and
the promise is not fulfilled.

660
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,660
With Sarah, thy wife. . .

661
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:53,060
. . .the time of childbearing is over.

662
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:56,860
Give lshmael, therefore, thy blessing.

663
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:00,060
Thou can hope for no other.

664
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:07,700
Shall the Lord speak
and Abraham not believe?

665
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:13,460
What is faith if it say,
''This thing cannot be''?

666
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:18,540
And as for lshmael. . .

667
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,260
. . .God has said ''Behold. . .

668
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:24,700
. . .l have blessed him and will
make him fruitful.

669
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,820
But my covenant will l establish
with lsaac. . .

670
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:31,140
. . .which Sarah shall bear unto thee. ''

671
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:35,940
And so l wait upon his will. . .

672
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:41,100
. . .even beyond the time.

673
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:45,900
And Abraham waited upon
the will of God.

674
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:51,380
And God was silent, as one who
searches the strength of a man.

675
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:55,780
Three years passed
and two more added...

676
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:59,260
...and Sarah and Abraham grew old.

677
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:51,540
My Lord. . .

678
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,580
. . .if now l have found favor
in thy sight. . .

679
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:01,020
. . .pass not away from thy servant.

680
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:05,660
We go down towards the city. . .

681
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:09,060
. . .toward Sodom. . .

682
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:15,100
. . .where Lot, thy brother's son,
sits in the gate of the city.

683
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,780
Rest yourselves, l pray thee. . .

684
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,100
. . .under the tree.

685
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:36,220
And comfort ye your hearts.

686
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:05,340
Where is Sarah, thy wife?

687
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:12,140
Behold, in the tent.

688
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:26,940
l will certainly
return unto thee, and lo. . .

689
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:31,300
. . .Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son.

690
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:44,700
After l am waxed old. . .

691
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:48,260
. . .shall l have pleasure. . .

692
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:51,220
. . .my Lord being old also?

693
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:53,700
Wherefore did Sarah laugh?

694
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:58,340
ls anything too hard for the Lord?

695
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,780
l laughed not!

696
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:02,180
Nay. . .

697
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:05,380
. . .but thou didst laugh.

698
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:15,460
At the time appointed
l will return unto thee. . .

699
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:19,180
. . .and Sarah shall have a son.

700
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:22,580
We are going. . .

701
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:26,940
. . .towards the cities of the plain.

702
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:31,180
l will bring you on your way.

703
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,580
Shall l hide from Abraham. . .

704
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:55,260
. . .that thing which l do?

705
02:04:57,860 --> 02:05:01,660
Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great. . .

706
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:05,220
. . .and because their sin
is very grievous. . .

707
02:05:06,620 --> 02:05:08,580
. . .l will go down now. . .

708
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:12,100
. . .and see whether
they have done altogether. . .

709
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:15,700
. . .according to the cry of it,
which has come unto me. . .

710
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:20,340
. . .and if not, l will know.

711
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:27,900
Wilt thou also destroy
the righteous with the wicked?

712
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:32,660
There may be 50 righteous. . .

713
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:37,540
. . .within the city. Wilt thou not
spare the place for them?

714
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:42,220
Shall not the judge
of all the Earth. . .

715
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,020
. . .do right?

716
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:49,980
lf l find 50 righteous
within the city. . .

717
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:54,220
. . .l will spare all the place
for their sakes.

718
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:59,420
What if there be 45 such men?

719
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:03,540
Or 30? Or even as few as 20?

720
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:08,060
l will not destroy it. . .

721
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:10,620
. . .for 20's sake.

722
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:19,380
Let not the Lord be angry
and l will speak yet but this once:

723
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:25,620
Peradventure, 1 0 shall be found there.

724
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:29,620
I will not destroy it...

725
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:31,860
...for 1 0's sake.

726
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:41,060
It chanced that when the sun was down,
Lot sat in the gates of the city.

727
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:44,980
And he lift up his eyes and looked...

728
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:49,380
...and beheld two strangers
coming into the city.

729
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:59,020
-What strangers are these?
-Where are they from?

730
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:03,860
-Two angels of God.
-So fair they are. So fair.

731
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:51,980
-Where are they?
-What have you done with them?

732
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:58,260
-Yes, bring them out unto us!
-Bring them, that we may know them!

733
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:02,140
l pray, brethren, do not so wickedly.

734
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:06,540
For these strangers
here with us are of God.

735
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:09,380
Better you destroy all l possess. . .

736
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:12,300
. . .than any harm should be done them.

737
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:19,140
Behold, l have two daughters
which have not known man.

738
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:23,700
Let me, l pray you,
bring them out unto you. . .

739
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:27,540
. . .and do ye to them
as is good in your eyes. . .

740
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:31,500
. . .only unto these men do nothing.

741
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:35,940
This one fellow came in to sojourn. . .

742
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:39,420
. . .and he will needs be a judge?

743
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:44,580
Now will we deal worse
with thee than with them!

744
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:10,540
l cannot see!

745
02:13:14,740 --> 02:13:20,140
Whatsoever thou hast in the city,
bring them out of this place. . .

746
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,580
. . .for the Lord hath sent us
to destroy it.

747
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:31,180
Take thy wife and thy two daughters
which are here. . .

748
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:35,540
. . .lest thou be consumed
in the iniquity of the city.

749
02:13:56,700 --> 02:14:01,060
Escape to the mountain,
lest thou be consumed.

750
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:04,980
Look not behind thee.

751
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:48,260
The name of our son
shall be called lsaac.

752
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:55,380
Thy son. . .

753
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,740
. . .and mine.

754
02:17:58,580 --> 02:18:04,300
God hath made me laugh.
All that hear will laugh with me.

755
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:17,820
Who would have said unto Abraham. . .

756
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:21,180
. . .that Sarah would have
given children suck?

757
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:25,940
For l have borne him a son
in his old age.

758
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,100
ln him. . .

759
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:36,460
. . .are the stars of the heavens. . .

760
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:41,580
. . .and the sands of the seashore.

761
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:45,020
And the child grew...

762
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:50,860
...and Abraham made a great feast
the same day Isaac was weaned.

763
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:07,180
Cast out this bondwoman and her son.

764
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:10,180
Who has put this into thy heart?

765
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:13,580
Did you not see how
he went among us mocking?

766
02:21:14,020 --> 02:21:18,740
l have a great fear there will
come such division in our people.

767
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:25,060
Like Cain and Abel again. l beg you,
cast out this bondwoman and her son!

768
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:30,340
The son of this bondwoman
shall not be heir with my son. . .

769
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:32,820
. . .even with lsaac.

770
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,820
What sayest thou? He is my seed.

771
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:42,220
l will not cast out the lad,
nor thy bondwoman.

772
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:01,740
But God said unto Abraham:

773
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:05,860
''Let it not be grievous in thy sight
because of the lad...

774
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:08,740
...and because of thy bondwoman.

775
02:22:08,940 --> 02:22:14,380
In all that Sarah hath said unto
thee, hearken unto her voice...

776
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:18,980
...for in Isaac shall
thy seed be called. ''

777
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:25,180
And Abraham sent her away,
and she departed...

778
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:29,180
...and wandered in the wilderness
of Beersheba.

779
02:23:06,220 --> 02:23:10,860
Lord! Let me not see
the death of the child!

780
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:14,660
And an angel of God
called to Hagar out of heaven...

781
02:23:14,860 --> 02:23:16,900
...and he said unto her:

782
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,380
What aileth thee, Hagar?

783
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:21,180
Fear not. . .

784
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:27,100
. . .for God hath heard the voice
of the lad where he is.

785
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:42,540
And God was with the lad...

786
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:46,940
...and he grew
and became a great nation.

787
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:52,340
Here are the generations
of my fathers named. . .

788
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:54,940
. . .to whom God gave life.

789
02:23:56,740 --> 02:24:00,860
lt has fallen to me that
the past shall not be forgotten. . .

790
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:04,260
. . .and after me. . .

791
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:06,700
. . .my son. . .

792
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:09,660
. . .also shall remember it.

793
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:16,500
By what descent are ye come?

794
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:21,380
These are the generations
of which l am made. . .

795
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:25,580
. . .of Noah, who by faith
prepared an ark. . .

796
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:28,660
. . .to the saving of this house.

797
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:30,980
Noah begat Shem. . .

798
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:33,540
. . .and Shem, Arphaxad. . .

799
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:37,860
. . .and after him was Salah,
who begat Eber. . .

800
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:42,260
. . .and his son was Peleg. . .

801
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:47,260
. . .the father of Reu,
who begat Serug. . .

802
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:50,020
. . .the father of Nahor. . .

803
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:52,620
. . .and Nahor begat Terah. . .

804
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:56,580
. . .whose son was Abraham,
my father.

805
02:24:57,900 --> 02:25:00,220
Here are the names written.

806
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:03,580
And here shalt thy name be also. . .

807
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:06,860
. . .lsaac, son of Abraham. . .

808
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:10,780
. . .when thou takest my place.

809
02:25:18,260 --> 02:25:20,740
Put thy hand upon it.

810
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:28,460
Abraham....

811
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:40,100
Abraham!

812
02:25:50,980 --> 02:25:53,020
Here l am.

813
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:17,060
The night is filled with thy voice.

814
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:22,540
Here am l.

815
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:28,940
What dost thou demand of me?

816
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:32,820
Thy son.

817
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:37,260
Thy only son.

818
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:48,340
What sayest thou?

819
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:53,780
Take now thy son...

820
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:59,780
... thy only son, Isaac,
whom thou lovest...

821
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:04,900
...and go into the mountains,
where I shall show thee...

822
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:09,580
...and offer him there
for a burnt offering.

823
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:16,100
Wouldst thou l do
even as the Canaanites. . .

824
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:19,940
. . .who lay their first-born
on fires before idols?

825
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:27,020
Art thou truly the Lord, my God?

826
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:31,660
Thou knowest.

827
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:41,860
No!

828
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:28,740
Thou wilt not. . .

829
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:32,140
. . .ask this thing of me!

830
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:01,860
lsaac. . .

831
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:06,020
. . .take leave of thy mother.

832
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:17,340
Mother, l am going on a journey.

833
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:20,780
A journey?

834
02:29:20,980 --> 02:29:23,540
We are going on a journey
of three days.

835
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:27,500
-l am going with my father.
-What dost thou tell me?

836
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:31,180
A journey unto the land of Moriah!

837
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:34,380
Unto Moriah?
Why unto Moriah?

838
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:38,980
God hath commanded that
we go there to sacrifice unto him.

839
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:41,820
Six days must l wait for thee?

840
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:44,260
Mother, it is a little time.

841
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:48,900
l have waited for thee
until l was old.

842
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:51,900
The days are precious to me.

843
02:29:56,740 --> 02:29:59,260
lsaac, lsaac. . . .

844
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:08,900
What should l fear. . .

845
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:14,740
. . .if thou goest with thy father?

846
02:30:45,540 --> 02:30:46,900
Father. . .

847
02:30:48,020 --> 02:30:50,180
. . .this was a city?

848
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:56,020
The city of Sodom.

849
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:01,420
Lot sat here in this gate.

850
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:03,180
And here. . .

851
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:07,700
. . .came the two angels to him.

852
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:25,300
He overthrew these cities
and all the plain. . .

853
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:28,700
. . .and all the inhabitants
of the cities. . .

854
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:32,460
. . .and that which grew
upon the face of the ground.

855
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:35,020
All the inhabitants?

856
02:31:46,300 --> 02:31:50,900
And lo, the smoke
of the country went up. . .

857
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:54,060
. . .as the smoke of a furnace.

858
02:31:55,700 --> 02:32:00,220
The Lord, our God, must be obeyed.

859
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:04,780
All the inhabitants of the cities?

860
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:08,140
The children also?

861
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:11,700
Were the children also wicked?

862
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:57,580
Father?

863
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:18,660
Shall not the judge
of all the Earth. . .

864
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:20,500
. . .do right?

865
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:29,260
Call the nobles to the kingdom!

866
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:35,540
None are here.

867
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:40,300
All the princes are nothing!

868
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:44,060
Father!

869
02:33:44,260 --> 02:33:48,540
All the princes are nothing!

870
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:51,900
The thorns have come up
in the palace.

871
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:57,660
From generation
to generation it will lie. . .

872
02:33:58,340 --> 02:34:00,900
. . .waste.

873
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:06,020
Ye shall stretch out upon it
the line of confusion.

874
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:24,060
Has it not been told from the
beginning, God is He that sitteth. . .

875
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:26,580
. . .upon the circle of the Earth. . .

876
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:31,100
. . .that stretcheth out the heaven
as a curtain. . .

877
02:34:31,300 --> 02:34:35,700
. . .and spreadeth them out as a tent
wherein to dwell. . .

878
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:39,980
. . .that bringeth the princes
to nothing?

879
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:44,180
Ye shall blow upon them. . .

880
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:47,340
. . .and they shall wither!

881
02:34:47,540 --> 02:34:50,700
And the whirlwind. . .

882
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:56,820
. . .shall take them away. . .

883
02:34:59,180 --> 02:35:01,220
. . .as stubble.

884
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:32,340
My son. . .

885
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:41,540
. . .the Lord God. . .

886
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:44,180
. . .appeared unto me. . .

887
02:35:45,060 --> 02:35:50,860
. . .and said unto me,
''l am the Almighty God.

888
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:54,900
Walk before me. . .

889
02:35:56,300 --> 02:35:58,340
. . .and be thou. . .

890
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:01,580
. . .perfect.

891
02:36:03,740 --> 02:36:06,980
Behold, my covenant is with thee. . .

892
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:10,420
. . .and l will make thee. . .

893
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:12,660
. . .exceedingly. . .

894
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:16,180
. . .fruitful. ''

895
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:24,300
Come, let us leave these ruins. . .

896
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:29,100
. . .and go from here
into the mountains.

897
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:51,980
ln all things. . .

898
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:56,220
. . .we must obey Him.

899
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:06,380
Then on the third day...

900
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:10,900
...Abraham lift up his eyes
and saw the place, afar off.

901
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:09,500
The wood.

902
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:11,740
The fire.

903
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:14,380
The knife.

904
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:19,180
But where is the ram
for the sacrifice?

905
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:08,460
Father!

906
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:18,700
My son!

907
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:36,100
There is nothing
He may not ask of thee?

908
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:39,260
Nothing.

909
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:04,380
Abraham!

910
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:07,740
Abraham!

911
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:12,780
Here am l.

912
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:16,780
Lay not thy hand upon the lad...

913
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:19,980
...for now I know
that thou fearest God...

914
02:42:20,180 --> 02:42:24,100
...seeing that thou
hadst not withheld thy son...

915
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:28,460
... thy only son, from me.

916
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:07,260
There is the ram for the sacrifice.

917
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:28,540
Behold, I have tried thee
like metal in a furnace.

918
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:32,780
I have chosen thee
in the furnace of affliction.

919
02:43:33,420 --> 02:43:38,180
Now will I multiply thy seed
as the stars of the heaven...

920
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:43,980
...and as the sand which is
by the seashore, innumerable.
