1
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,420
Every second bastard born
is fathered by a priest.

2
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,119
But in Utopia that couldn't be.

3
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,245
For why?

4
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:31,724
- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.

5
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,436
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?

6
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,607
- Bless you, sir. I don't know.
- Bless you too, Matthew.

7
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,348
To be sure, we have
some holy priests in England.

8
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,784
- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.

9
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,203
Man's a simpleton.

10
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,414
It's from Cardinal Wolsey.

11
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,334
What's he want?

12
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:01,044
- Me.
- When?

13
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,045
Now.

14
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:05,089
In Hampton Court?
You won't be there by midnight.

15
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,467
- The King's business.
- Queen's business.

16
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,094
Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.

17
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,389
Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.

18
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:18,711
That's very true. And when the Cardinal
calls, you all come running, day or night.

19
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,814
What is the man? A butcher's son.

20
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,674
Chancellor of England, too.

21
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,276
No, that's his office. What's the man?

22
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:30,264
Surely, Your Grace, when a man
rises so high and so swiftly...

23
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:33,242
we must think he was misplaced
in his origins.

24
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:37,287
That, at least,
was the opinion of Aristotle and...

25
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,457
A butcher's son and looks it.

26
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,167
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.

27
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,380
What was that you said, Richard?

28
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:50,550
Nothing, Sir Thomas,
it was out of place.

29
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,011
And Wolsey's still a butcher.

30
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:57,999
And you're a member of the King's
High Council, not an errand boy.

31
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,767
That is why I must go.

32
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:02,895
The Duke would go
if the Cardinal called him.

33
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,856
I might.

34
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,776
I'll be back for breakfast.

35
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:10,820
Go to bed.

36
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:16,409
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight,
or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.

37
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:20,996
"Careful only for our soul's salvation.
For Christ's sake. Amen."

38
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,291
And bless our lord, the King.

39
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,944
- "And bless our lord, the King."
- Amen!

40
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:30,797
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.

41
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,722
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He's a frightened man.

42
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:43,727
- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.

43
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:46,938
- What's he want?
- What do they all want? A position.

44
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:50,150
- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?

45
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:51,817
No.

46
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:11,420
- Sir Thomas.
- No.

47
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:14,215
- Did you recommend me?
- No.

48
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,761
Richard, I may have a position for you.

49
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:23,015
- What? What position?
- Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.

50
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,473
For you all, boatman.

51
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,517
Thank you, sir.

52
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,791
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.

53
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,667
Master Cromwell.

54
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:52,727
You opposed me in the Council
this morning, Thomas.

55
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,937
Yes, Your Grace.

56
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:59,025
- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.

57
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:01,694
You're a fool.

58
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,907
Thank God there is only one fool
on the Council.

59
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:11,620
Why did you oppose me?

60
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,623
I thought Your Grace was wrong.

61
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,959
A matter of conscience.

62
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,506
You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.

63
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:25,784
If you could just see facts flat on...

64
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:29,054
without that horrible moral squint.

65
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,809
With a little common sense,
you could have made a statesman.

66
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:41,399
The King.

67
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,637
Where's he been? Do you know?

68
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,931
I, Your Grace?

69
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:16,933
Spare me your discretion.

70
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:22,355
He's been to play in the muck again.

71
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,776
He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.

72
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,244
More, are you going to help me?

73
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:41,541
If Your Grace will be specific.

74
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:45,920
You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.

75
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:49,758
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?

76
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:54,052
I'm very sure the King needs no advice
from me on what to do about it.

77
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:58,332
Thomas, we're alone.
I give you my word, there's no one here.

78
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:00,851
I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.

79
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:08,133
Do you favor a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?

80
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,426
For God's sake, Your Grace!

81
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:13,030
Then he needs a son. I repeat,
what are you going to do about it?

82
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,390
I pray for it daily.

83
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,784
God's death, he means it.

84
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:20,829
That thing out there,
at least she's fertile.

85
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:24,274
- But she's not his wife.
- No, Catherine's his wife...

86
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:27,735
and she's barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?

87
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,420
There are precedents.

88
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:37,011
All right. Good. Pray by all means.

89
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:43,893
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.

90
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:49,816
Have I your support, or have I not?

91
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:57,240
The Pope gave a dispensation,
so that the King might marry...

92
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,950
his brother's widow for state reasons.

93
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:06,023
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with
his dispensation, also for state reasons?

94
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:08,275
I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?

95
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,571
Then, clearly all we have to do is
to approach His Holiness and ask him.

96
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,841
I think we might influence
the decision of His Holiness.

97
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,659
By argument?

98
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,638
Argument certainly. And pressure.

99
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:27,185
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.

100
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:30,439
Pressure.

101
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:40,614
No, Your Grace,
I'm not going to help you.

102
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:46,745
Then goodnight, Master More.

103
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:55,004
Let the dynasty die with Henry VIII
and we'll have dynastic wars again.

104
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,549
Blood-witted barons ramping the country
from end to end.

105
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:02,970
Is that what you want? Very well.

106
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,015
England needs an heir.

107
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:11,770
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...

108
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,399
perhaps not, there's much in the Church
which needs reformation, Thomas.

109
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,697
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.

110
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:28,937
Now, explain how you, as a councilor
of England, can obstruct these measures...

111
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,915
for the sake
of your own private conscience.

112
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,837
I think that when statesmen forsake
their own private conscience...

113
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,507
for the sake of their public duties...

114
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:44,301
they lead their country
by a short route to chaos.

115
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,974
And we shall have my prayers
to fall back on.

116
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:55,896
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
To govern the country with prayers?

117
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,689
Yes, I should.

118
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,692
I'd like to be there when you try.

119
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,947
Who will wear this after me?

120
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,953
Who's our next chancellor?
You? Fisher? Suffolk?

121
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,580
- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?

122
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,208
What about my secretary,
Master Cromwell?

123
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,921
Cromwell. He's a very able man.

124
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,215
But?

125
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,260
Me rather than Cromwell.

126
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,054
Then, come down to earth.

127
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,142
Until you do...

128
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,521
you and I are enemies.

129
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,941
As Your Grace wishes.

130
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,279
As God wills.

131
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,489
Perhaps, Your Grace.

132
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,535
More! You should have been a cleric!

133
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,163
Like yourself, Your Grace?

134
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,720
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.

135
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,978
Sir Thomas.

136
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,022
Sir Thomas.

137
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,316
Sir Thomas.

138
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,904
- What's this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.

139
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,908
- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.

140
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:40,289
My daughter has a case, sir,
in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.

141
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,501
Baked apples, sir.

142
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,795
To sweeten my judgment.

143
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:49,907
I'll give your daughter the same judgment
I would give my own.

144
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,426
A fair one, quickly.

145
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,036
Bless you, sir.

146
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:57,807
I understand. Yes. I'll read it.
Yes. Thank you.

147
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,271
Good evening, Sir Thomas.

148
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,466
- I'll read it.
- It's an awkward case.

149
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:10,844
- I could illuminate it for you...
- I'll read it.

150
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:12,570
Just a moment or two...

151
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:15,698
Boat!

152
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:16,866
Sir?

153
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:40,706
Chelsea, sir?

154
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:41,849
Chelsea.

155
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,918
I expect you'll make it
worth my while, sir.

156
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:48,422
- You've got a license?
- Bless you, yes sir, I've got a license.

157
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,108
- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.

158
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,844
Hampton to Chelsea downstream,
a penny halfpenny.

159
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:56,096
Chelsea to Hampton upstream,
a penny halfpenny.

160
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:58,657
Whoever makes the regulations
doesn't row a boat.

161
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:02,686
No. Three pence if you get me home
for breakfast.

162
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,079
Thank you, sir.

163
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,566
A nice cup, sir.

164
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,319
Yes.

165
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,712
That's worth money, sir.

166
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:34,750
Mind a way, sir.

167
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,675
Thank you, sir.

168
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,100
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.

169
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:56,020
You said there was a post?

170
00:19:56,646 --> 00:20:02,068
Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house,
a servant and £50 a year.

171
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,528
What post?

172
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:05,947
At the new school.

173
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:09,951
A teacher!

174
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:14,038
Richard, no one's going to give you
a place at court.

175
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,251
Master Cromwell says
he'll do something for me.

176
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,004
Cromwell?

177
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,008
Well, if you know Cromwell
you don't need my help.

178
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,634
Sir Thomas?

179
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,183
If only you knew how much,
much rather, I had your help than his.

180
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,020
Not to a place at court.

181
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,022
Why not?

182
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:43,400
Look.

183
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,529
- What is it?
- It's a bribe!

184
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,410
"I am the gift of Averil Machin."

185
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,082
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit
in the Court of Requests.

186
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:03,711
Italian silver. Take it. No joke.

187
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,465
Thank you.

188
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,095
What will you do with it?

189
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:13,538
Sell it.

190
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,973
- And buy what?
- A decent gown!

191
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:19,393
But Richard, that's a little bribe.

192
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:25,608
At court they offer you all sorts of things,
home, manor houses, coats of arms.

193
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,861
A man should go
where he won't be tempted.

194
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:34,741
Why not be a teacher? You'd be
a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.

195
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:40,414
- If I was, who would know it?
- You! Your pupils. Your friends.

196
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:43,583
God. Not a bad public, that.

197
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,464
And a quiet life.

198
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:52,701
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.

199
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,220
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.

200
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:59,958
It's eating your heart out, isn't it?
The high affairs of state.

201
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,268
The divorce?

202
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,729
Boatman!

203
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,105
Sir?

204
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,841
- Take this gentleman to the New Inn!
- Right, sir.

205
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,316
Sir Thomas?

206
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,485
Thank you.

207
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:14,530
Be a teacher.

208
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,941
- Matthew.
- Sir.

209
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,960
- Lady Alice in bed?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,004
- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.

211
00:22:30,463 --> 00:22:32,365
The Master Roper's here, sir.

212
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,425
At this hour? Who let him in?

213
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:37,386
He's a hard man to keep out, sir.

214
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,952
Will wants to marry me, Father.

215
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:05,538
Well, he can't marry you.

216
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,025
Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.

217
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,753
Oh, congratulations, Roper.

218
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:14,464
My family may not be at the palace,
but in the city...

219
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:17,008
There's nothing wrong
with your family, Will.

220
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,886
There's not much wrong with you.

221
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,181
Except you seem to need a clock.

222
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,558
I can buy a clock, sir.

223
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,335
Roper, the answer is no...

224
00:23:28,435 --> 00:23:31,005
and will be no as long
as you're a heretic.

225
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,340
Now, that's a word I don't like,
Sir Thomas!

226
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,384
It's not a likeable word or thing.

227
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:39,096
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!

228
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:40,931
Luther is an excommunicate!

229
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:43,951
From a heretic Church!
Church? It's a shop!

230
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:47,621
- Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!
- Will, no!

231
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:50,916
- What I know, I'll say!
- You've no sense of the place!

232
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,876
He's no sense of the time.

233
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,087
Now listen well.

234
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,990
Two years ago you were
a passionate churchman.

235
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,034
Now you're a passionate Lutheran.

236
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:04,162
We must just pray
that when your head's finished turning...

237
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:06,472
your face is to the front again.

238
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:11,144
- Is your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.

239
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:14,897
Well, take a horse from the stables
and get back home.

240
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:17,859
Go along.

241
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:20,903
May I come again?

242
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,199
Yes. Soon.

243
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:32,372
Is that final, Father?

244
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:35,459
As long as he's a heretic, Meg,
that's absolute.

245
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,131
What did Wolsey want?

246
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:45,969
Nice boy, young Will.

247
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:50,724
Terribly strong principles, though.

248
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,310
Clumsy, too.

249
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:56,938
- You're very pensive.
- You're very gay.

250
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,024
Was it the divorce?

251
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:01,734
To bed.

252
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:07,031
They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.

253
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,408
Old Roper was just the same...

254
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:13,037
You don't want to talk about it.

255
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:14,872
No.

256
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,756
- I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn't sleeping very deeply.

257
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,800
What did Wolsey want?

258
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,596
- Will Roper's been.
- Will Roper?

259
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,708
Yes, he's been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.

260
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:36,351
- Why you don't beat that girl I...
- No.

261
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:40,522
She's full of education
and it's a delicate commodity.

262
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:42,524
Goodnight, Meg.

263
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:43,942
Goodnight.

264
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,932
Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.

265
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:52,867
Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.

266
00:25:56,287 --> 00:26:00,625
Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor
of England before he left.

267
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,420
Well, he's a dangerous friend then.

268
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:06,673
Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.

269
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,117
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you...

270
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:13,178
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp
a few small boats like ours.

271
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,722
No.

272
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:18,308
There'll be no new chancellors
while Wolsey lives.

273
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:11,194
The Duke of Norfolk,
Earl Marshal of England.

274
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:28,210
Have you any message for His Majesty?

275
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,297
If I had served God...

276
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:35,467
one half so well
as I've served my King...

277
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:40,931
God would not have left me here,
to die in this place.

278
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:46,686
Thank God you're dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.

279
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,004
"I am straightly charged
by the King himself...

280
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:18,426
"here openly to declare
how much all England...

281
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:20,720
"is beholden to this man.

282
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:25,975
"And how worthy he is
to have the highest room in the realm.

283
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:30,478
"And how dearly the King's grace
doth love and trust him...

284
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:33,773
"not only for much good council...

285
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,819
"deliberate council,
but for better council yet...

286
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,281
"that which is privy
to the King's person.

287
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:44,534
"This same Sir Thomas More...

288
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:47,579
"here made before you all to be...

289
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:50,957
"Lord Chancellor of the Realm."

290
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:32,080
Calm yourself, Matthew.

291
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,849
Fetch Lady Alice.

292
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,945
That's very well.

293
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,285
My lady! The King!

294
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,834
Now remember, the visit's a surprise.

295
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,794
But he'll know we're expecting him...

296
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:06,630
It's a very great honor.
One friend calling on another.

297
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,382
What's he really coming for?

298
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,843
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.

299
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:13,387
- But he's had his answer.
- He wants another.

300
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:14,488
Thomas!

301
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,774
Your Majesty does my house more honor
than I fear my household will bear.

302
00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:28,084
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!

303
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,778
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.

304
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,213
Look. Mud.

305
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:39,220
By heaven, what an evening.

306
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,082
Lady Alice,
I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.

307
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:45,768
Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.

308
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,296
Well, that is,
we are ready to entertain...

309
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:50,815
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.

310
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,403
She's not yet had the honor
to meet Your Grace.

311
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:58,740
Why Margaret,
they told me you were a scholar.

312
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:01,241
Answer, Margaret.

313
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,202
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.

314
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:36,984
Can you dance, too?

315
00:33:37,693 --> 00:33:39,278
Not well, Your Grace.

316
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,574
Well, I dance superlatively!

317
00:33:44,492 --> 00:33:46,911
That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!

318
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:02,243
Lady Alice,
the river's given me an appetite.

319
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:05,496
If Your Grace would share
a very simple supper.

320
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,665
It would please me. Lead them in.

321
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:09,208
Thomas and I will follow.

322
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,683
Matthew.

323
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:13,395
My lords and gentlemen!

324
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,318
Margaret?

325
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,970
Your Grace?

326
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,696
Do you like music?

327
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:25,407
Yes, Your Grace.

328
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:27,742
They'll play to you.

329
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,892
Now, listen to this.

330
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:57,980
Sit down.

331
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:02,067
Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.

332
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,741
You're my friend, are you not?

333
00:35:09,283 --> 00:35:10,309
Your Majesty.

334
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,937
Thank God I have a friend
for my chancellor.

335
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:16,065
Readier to befriend, I trust,
than he was to be chancellor.

336
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:18,359
My own knowledge of my poor abilities...

337
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:20,752
I will judge of your abilities.

338
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:22,712
Thomas?

339
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,760
You know that Wolsey named you
for chancellor?

340
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:34,057
Before he died, Wolsey named you,
and Wolsey was no fool.

341
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,269
He was a statesman
of incomparable ability, Your Grace.

342
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:41,814
Was he?

343
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,609
Was he so?

344
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,737
Then, why did he fail me?

345
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,200
It was villainy then.

346
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,185
Yes, villainy.
Secret opposition, secret.

347
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,689
But deliberate, willful,
meditated opposition.

348
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,316
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.

349
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,901
What is it? Thought!

350
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:07,447
Because I'm simple and plain and deal
with every man straightforwardly.

351
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:11,468
Because of that I say,
do they take me for a simpleton?

352
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:21,228
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.

353
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:23,897
Pride right through.

354
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,565
And he failed me.

355
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:30,069
Failed me in the one thing that matters,
then as now.

356
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:34,990
But look.

357
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,118
Be seated.

358
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:43,874
What an evening.

359
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:47,211
A man could fight a lion.

360
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:49,755
Some men could, Your Grace.

361
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,258
Thomas...

362
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:56,053
touching this matter of my divorce.

363
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,706
Have you thought of it
since we last spoke?

364
00:36:58,806 --> 00:36:59,874
Of little else.

365
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,833
Then you see your way clear to me?

366
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,811
That you should put away
Queen Catherine, sire?

367
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:07,130
Alas, as I think of it,
I see so clearly...

368
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,342
that I cannot come with Your Grace,
that my endeavor is...

369
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:11,801
not to think of it at all.

370
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,320
Then you haven't thought enough!

371
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:22,704
Lilac.

372
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:25,957
We have them at Hampton.

373
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,710
Not so fine as this, though.

374
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:33,590
I'm in an excellent frame of mind.

375
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,039
Thomas, you must consider,
I stand in peril of my soul.

376
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:43,640
It was no marriage.

377
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:47,352
I have lived in incest
with my brother's widow.

378
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:53,342
Leviticus: "Thou shalt not uncover
the nakedness of thy brother's wife."

379
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:55,761
Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.

380
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:57,721
Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy...

381
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:59,807
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!

382
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:02,559
Your Grace, I'm not fitted
to meddle in these matters.

383
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,770
To me, it seems a matter
for the Holy See...

384
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,624
Thomas, does a man need a pope
to tell him where he's sinned?

385
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,793
It was a sin.

386
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:14,379
God's punished me.

387
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,839
I've no son.

388
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,118
Son after son she's borne me.

389
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:23,221
All dead at birth,
or dead within the month.

390
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:26,082
I never saw the hand of God
so clear in anything.

391
00:38:26,182 --> 00:38:28,334
It's my bounden duty
to put away the Queen.

392
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:32,021
And all the popes, back to Peter,
shall not come between me and my duty!

393
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,051
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.

394
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:40,279
Then, why does Your Grace
need my poor support?

395
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,198
Because you're honest.

396
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:45,517
And what is more to the purpose,
you're known to be honest.

397
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,145
Those like Norfolk follow me
because I wear the crown.

398
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:51,690
Those like Cromwell follow
because they're jackals with sharp teeth...

399
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,984
and I'm their tiger.
A mass follows me...

400
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,044
because it follows anything that moves.

401
00:38:58,588 --> 00:38:59,840
And then there's you.

402
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,470
I am sick to think
how much I must displease Your Grace.

403
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,808
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.

404
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,771
But respect...

405
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,191
man, that's water in the desert.

406
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,139
How'd you like our music?

407
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,350
That air they played,
it had a certain...

408
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,936
Well, tell me what you thought of it.

409
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,288
Could it have been Your Grace's own?

410
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:33,831
Discovered!

411
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,610
Now I'll never know your true opinion,
and that's irksome.

412
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,172
Well, we artists, we love praise,
yet we love truth better.

413
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,741
- Then I will tell my true opinion.
- Well?

414
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:47,053
To me it seemed delightful.

415
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:53,166
Thomas, I chose the right man
for chancellor.

416
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:57,520
I should in fairness add that my taste
in music is reputedly deplorable.

417
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,590
Your taste in music is excellent!

418
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,901
It exactly coincides with my own.

419
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,531
Music.

420
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,409
Music.

421
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,606
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.

422
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,900
My house is at Your Grace's disposal.

423
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,503
Touching this other business,
mark you...

424
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,799
I'll have no opposition.

425
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:28,951
Your Grace.

426
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:33,305
No opposition, I say. No opposition.

427
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,641
Be seated.

428
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:43,148
I'll leave you out of it
but you are my chancellor.

429
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,404
I don't take it kindly
and I'll have no opposition!

430
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,783
I see how it will be.

431
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:56,161
The bishops will oppose me!

432
00:40:56,578 --> 00:41:01,208
The full-fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites! All hypocrites!

433
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,710
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!

434
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:05,403
Your Grace is unjust.

435
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:08,615
If I cannot serve Your Grace
in this great matter of the Queen.

436
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:11,092
I have no queen!

437
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:13,803
Catherine's not my wife!

438
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:16,681
No priest can make her so.

439
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,102
They that say she is my wife
are not only liars, but traitors!

440
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,647
Yes, traitors!

441
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,275
That I will not brook now!

442
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,068
Treachery!

443
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:31,387
I will not brook.

444
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:32,822
It maddens me!

445
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:38,827
It is a deadly canker in the body politic,
and I will have it out!

446
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,796
See?

447
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:54,259
You see how you've maddened me?

448
00:41:54,843 --> 00:41:57,137
I hardly know myself.

449
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:08,048
If you could come with me,
there's no man I'd sooner raise...

450
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:10,025
yes, with my own hand.

451
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,443
Your Grace overwhelms me.

452
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,829
What's that?

453
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,998
Eight o'clock, Your Grace.

454
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,877
Lift yourself up, man.

455
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,550
Have I not promised
I'll leave you out of it?

456
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:39,470
Shall we eat?

457
00:42:39,595 --> 00:42:41,222
If Your Grace pleases.

458
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:47,102
Eight o'clock, you said.

459
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:50,438
The tide will be turning.

460
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:53,983
- I was forgetting the tide. I must go.
- I'm sorry, Your Grace.

461
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:57,429
If I don't catch the tide
I'll not get back to Richmond.

462
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:59,072
No, don't come.

463
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:06,313
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.

464
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:09,082
So we give you our thanks
and we say goodnight!

465
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:32,730
What's this?

466
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:35,174
- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.

467
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:37,384
- Why?
- I couldn't find the other way.

468
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:39,511
You're too nice altogether, Thomas.

469
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:43,115
- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!

470
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:48,370
God save Your Majesty!

471
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:51,540
God save Your Grace!

472
00:43:58,713 --> 00:44:00,465
God save the King!

473
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:04,552
Lift!

474
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,770
Drop blades!

475
00:44:16,314 --> 00:44:18,566
Sire! Sire! Sire!

476
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,683
Are you coming my way, Rich?

477
00:44:54,976 --> 00:44:56,061
No.

478
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,315
I think you should, you know.

479
00:45:00,774 --> 00:45:02,900
I can't tell you anything.

480
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:10,741
Well?

481
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:24,672
Thomas?

482
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:28,926
Stay friends with him.

483
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:34,181
Whatever may be done by smiling,
you may rely on me to do.

484
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,606
Set your mind at rest.

485
00:45:43,898 --> 00:45:47,152
This is not the stuff
of which martyrs are made.

486
00:45:56,828 --> 00:45:59,831
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.

487
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:03,209
Will wants to talk to you, Father.

488
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,613
I told him it wouldn't be convenient.

489
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:07,714
You were quite right.

490
00:46:08,506 --> 00:46:11,425
You're very free
with my daughter's hand, Roper.

491
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,843
Yes.

492
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:15,387
It's of that I wish to speak.

493
00:46:15,763 --> 00:46:18,682
Sir, you've had a disagreement
with His Majesty.

494
00:46:19,558 --> 00:46:21,877
- Have I?
- So Meg tells me.

495
00:46:21,977 --> 00:46:23,937
I offer my congratulations.

496
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:27,216
If it's true,
is it a matter for congratulation?

497
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:28,359
Yes!

498
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:36,408
Sir, when last I asked you
for your daughter's hand...

499
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:39,870
you objected to my unorthodox opinions.

500
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:41,605
- I did.
- Yes.

501
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:44,375
Well, since then my views
have somewhat modified.

502
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:50,671
Well, that's good hearing, Will.

503
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:55,326
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning
the various corruptions in the Church.

504
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:58,246
- Quite right.
- But an attack upon the Church herself...

505
00:46:58,346 --> 00:47:00,873
no. I see behind that an attack on God.

506
00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:02,458
- Roper!
- The Devil's work...

507
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:04,335
to be done by the Devil's ministers!

508
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,337
For heaven's sake, remember my office.

509
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:07,880
If you stand on your office...

510
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,193
No, I don't stand on it, but there are
certain things I may not hear.

511
00:47:12,902 --> 00:47:13,569
Sir Thomas.

512
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:17,407
Richard?

513
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:19,324
I fell.

514
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:22,411
Lady Alice.

515
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:24,313
- Lady Margaret.
- Good evening.

516
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:26,832
Do you know William Roper, the younger?

517
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:28,875
By reputation, of course.

518
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,420
- Good evening, Master...
- Rich.

519
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,429
You've heard of me?

520
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:41,805
Yes.

521
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:45,559
In what connection?
I don't know what you can have heard.

522
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,608
I sense that I'm not welcome here.

523
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:56,928
Why Richard? Have you done something
to make you not welcome?

524
00:47:57,028 --> 00:47:58,387
Cromwell is asking questions.

525
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:01,907
About you. He's always asking
questions about you and your opinions.

526
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:03,701
Of whom?

527
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:06,996
Of him, for one.
That's one of his sources.

528
00:48:08,664 --> 00:48:11,042
Of course. That's one of my servants.

529
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,336
All right, Matthew.

530
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:21,761
Well, you look at me
as though I were an enemy.

531
00:48:24,388 --> 00:48:26,349
Why Richard, you're shaking.

532
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:29,392
Help me.

533
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,311
How?

534
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:32,729
Employ me.

535
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:34,522
No.

536
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:36,858
- Employ me!
- No.

537
00:48:52,457 --> 00:48:54,292
I would be faithful.

538
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:02,217
You couldn't answer for yourself
even so far as tonight.

539
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:15,562
Arrest him!

540
00:49:15,688 --> 00:49:17,172
- For what?
- He's dangerous!

541
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:19,049
- Libel. He's a spy!
- That man's bad!

542
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:21,343
- There's no law against that.
- God's law!

543
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:24,013
- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he's gone!

544
00:49:24,113 --> 00:49:27,141
Go he should, if he were the Devil,
until he broke the law.

545
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:30,894
- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?

546
00:49:30,994 --> 00:49:33,522
Cut a road through the law
to get after the Devil?

547
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:36,583
Yes. I'd cut down every law in England
to do that.

548
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:40,486
And when the last law was down,
and the Devil turned on you...

549
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:43,615
where would you hide, Roper,
the laws all being flat?

550
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:46,409
This country is planted with laws
from coast to coast...

551
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:49,120
Man's laws, not God's,
and if you cut them down...

552
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,955
and you're just the man to do it...

553
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:55,560
do you really think you could stand
upright in the wind that would blow then?

554
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:57,337
Yes.

555
00:49:57,437 --> 00:50:01,733
I give the Devil benefit of law
for my own safety's sake.

556
00:50:39,644 --> 00:50:41,396
- Master Rich?
- Yes.

557
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:43,065
In there, sir.

558
00:50:49,111 --> 00:50:51,155
Rich? Come in.

559
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:57,311
Taken you long enough to get here.

560
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,121
Have I kept you waiting?

561
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:01,582
Months.

562
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,170
- Here.
- Thank you.

563
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:09,131
Do you know the news?

564
00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:12,593
- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.

565
00:51:14,136 --> 00:51:16,222
And I succeed him.

566
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:19,166
Secretary to the Council?

567
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:20,392
You?

568
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:22,644
'Tis surprising, isn't it?

569
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,815
I mean, one sees that's logical.

570
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:31,653
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...

571
00:51:31,778 --> 00:51:33,863
as His Majesty would say.

572
00:51:37,325 --> 00:51:39,119
You see how I trust you.

573
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:42,831
I'd never repeat
or report a thing like that.

574
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:46,918
What kind of thing
would you repeat or report?

575
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:50,797
Nothing said in friendship.

576
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:52,532
Do you believe that?

577
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:54,617
- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.

578
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,093
Well, yes.

579
00:51:56,427 --> 00:52:00,389
Rich, seriously.

580
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:08,939
That would depend what I was offered.

581
00:52:10,816 --> 00:52:12,426
Don't say it just to please me.

582
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:15,237
It's true. It would depend
what I was offered.

583
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:20,284
Well, there is another post vacant.

584
00:52:20,743 --> 00:52:22,953
Collector of Revenues for York.

585
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,189
Is it in your gift?

586
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,665
Effectively.

587
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,500
What must I do for it?

588
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:35,214
I know a man
who wants to change his woman.

589
00:52:36,841 --> 00:52:39,744
Normally a matter of small importance,
but in this case...

590
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:43,014
it's our liege, Lord Henry,
the eighth of that name.

591
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:48,127
Which is a quaint way of saying that
if he wants to change his woman, he will.

592
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:50,396
And our job as administrators...

593
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,318
is to minimize the inconvenience
which this is going to cause.

594
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:59,739
That's our only job, Rich,
to minimize the inconvenience of things.

595
00:53:00,198 --> 00:53:03,200
A harmless occupation
you would say, but no.

596
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,453
We administrators are not liked, Rich.

597
00:53:06,912 --> 00:53:08,689
We are not popular.

598
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:13,001
I say "we" on the assumption you'll accept
the post at York I've offered you.

599
00:53:17,964 --> 00:53:19,091
Yes.

600
00:53:26,932 --> 00:53:30,294
It's a bad sign when people are depressed
by their own good fortune.

601
00:53:30,394 --> 00:53:32,421
- I'm not depressed.
- You look depressed.

602
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,923
I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.

603
00:53:35,023 --> 00:53:37,900
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?

604
00:53:39,402 --> 00:53:43,572
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor,
now there's an innocent man.

605
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,576
The odd thing is, he is.

606
00:53:47,827 --> 00:53:50,813
Yes, I say he is. Unhappily...

607
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:53,274
his innocence is tangled up
in this problem...

608
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:56,110
that you can't change your woman
without a divorce...

609
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,463
and you can't get a divorce
unless the Pope says so.

610
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:04,135
And from this meaningless circumstance,
I foresee a certain measure of...

611
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:06,762
- Inconvenience?
- Just so.

612
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:10,599
This goblet he gave you,
how much was it worth?

613
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:16,730
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?

614
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:18,256
Fifty shillings.

615
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:21,359
It was a gift, wasn't it,
from a litigant, a woman?

616
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:23,945
- Yes.
- Which court? Chancery?

617
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:27,782
Don't get drunk!

618
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:30,869
Which court was the litigant's case?

619
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:34,539
Court of Requests.

620
00:54:36,624 --> 00:54:39,377
There. That wasn't too painful, was it?

621
00:54:42,005 --> 00:54:43,423
- No.
- No.

622
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:46,175
And you'll find it easier, next time.

623
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:24,420
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...

624
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:27,173
Reverend Doctors of the Church.

625
00:55:27,382 --> 00:55:30,285
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...

626
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:32,829
to his trusty well-beloved subjects...

627
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,682
pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.

628
00:55:37,392 --> 00:55:38,685
"His Majesty...

629
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,772
"acknowledges your humble
admission of many grievous errors...

630
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,383
"for which he accepts...

631
00:55:45,483 --> 00:55:50,154
"the manumission
of £100,000 in token.

632
00:55:52,657 --> 00:55:56,476
"Mindful for the well-being of the realm
and the quietness of his subjects...

633
00:55:56,576 --> 00:56:00,981
"His Majesty requires that you do now
straightly renounce your pretended...

634
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:03,500
"allegiance to the See of Rome.

635
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:07,212
"And admit the statute
passed through parliament...

636
00:56:07,546 --> 00:56:10,090
"acknowledging
the King's good title...

637
00:56:10,674 --> 00:56:13,468
"Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

638
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:22,060
Well, my lords, what's your answer?

639
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:26,398
Yea or nay?

640
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:31,235
His Majesty accepts your resignation
very sadly.

641
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,971
He's mindful of your goodness
and past loyalty.

642
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:38,576
And in any matter concerning your honor
and welfare he'll continue your good lord.

643
00:56:39,952 --> 00:56:42,204
You will convey my humble gratitude.

644
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:50,880
- Help me with this.
- Not I.

645
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:56,302
- Alice?
- No.

646
00:56:57,261 --> 00:57:02,016
Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken
for a wise man. Is this wisdom?

647
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:04,000
To betray your ability...

648
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,771
abandon your station
and forget your duty to your kith and kin?

649
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,148
Shall I, sir?

650
00:57:11,816 --> 00:57:14,444
No, thank you, son Roper.

651
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:17,447
Margaret...

652
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,116
will you?

653
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:22,702
Yes.

654
00:57:27,832 --> 00:57:29,751
If you want.

655
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:36,758
There's my clever girl.

656
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:44,556
Well done, sir! In my opinion,
that thing's a degradation.

657
00:57:44,682 --> 00:57:47,251
I'll tell you my opinion
of the King's title, too...

658
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:51,230
Don't! Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...

659
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:53,857
and may have children.

660
00:58:05,703 --> 00:58:07,771
All right, Thomas, make me understand...

661
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:10,649
because I tell you,
to me this looks like cowardice!

662
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:11,708
All right, I will.

663
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,545
This isn't reformation,
this is war against the Church.

664
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:19,407
Our King has declared war on the Pope
because the Pope will not declare...

665
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:22,385
- ... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?

666
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:26,806
Is she?

667
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:32,211
Have I your word that what we say here
is between us two?

668
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:33,521
Very well.

669
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:37,191
And if the King should command you
to repeat what I may say?

670
00:58:37,317 --> 00:58:39,277
I should keep my word to you.

671
00:58:39,402 --> 00:58:43,239
Then what has become of your oath
of obedience to the King?

672
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:47,768
You lay traps for me!

673
00:58:47,868 --> 00:58:50,495
No, I show you the times.

674
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:57,653
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?

675
00:58:57,753 --> 00:59:01,782
He is. He's also the descendant
of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.

676
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:05,744
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...

677
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:08,789
which includes the respect
of your country, for a belief?

678
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:12,184
Because what matters
is that I believe it, or rather, no...

679
00:59:12,768 --> 00:59:15,937
not that I believe it,
but that I believe it.

680
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:20,108
- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.

681
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,697
Why do you insult me
with this lawyer's chatter?

682
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:29,325
Because I'm afraid.

683
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:31,118
Man, you're ill.

684
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:36,540
This isn't Spain, you know.
This is England.

685
00:59:55,975 --> 01:00:00,021
My friends, you all know
why I've called you here.

686
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:04,192
I have today resigned my office.

687
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:09,656
I am no longer a great man.

688
01:00:10,865 --> 01:00:14,160
Sir, we want you to know
that we're all on your side.

689
01:00:14,995 --> 01:00:17,455
My side? What side is that?

690
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:19,733
Well, sir, we all know what you think.

691
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:22,319
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...

692
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:25,463
and babble it about,
you do me no good service.

693
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:31,118
Since I am no more a great man,
I no longer need a great household.

694
01:00:31,218 --> 01:00:36,015
Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.

695
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:39,460
However, I still number some great men
among my friends...

696
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,837
and they still need great households.

697
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:45,341
No one will be turned away
until we've found another place for him.

698
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,360
- We can't find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.

699
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:52,072
Thank you.

700
01:00:53,365 --> 01:00:54,867
That is all.

701
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:07,253
What about you, Matthew?

702
01:01:10,923 --> 01:01:12,467
Will you stay?

703
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:14,535
Well, sir, that's according.

704
01:01:14,635 --> 01:01:17,430
There will be more work and less money.

705
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:22,794
Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.
After all, I've got my own...

706
01:01:22,894 --> 01:01:26,856
Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.

707
01:01:27,982 --> 01:01:30,777
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.

708
01:01:35,448 --> 01:01:37,158
I shall miss you.

709
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:51,046
Damn me! Isn't that them all over!

710
01:01:51,505 --> 01:01:53,865
Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?

711
01:01:53,965 --> 01:01:58,287
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.

712
01:01:58,387 --> 01:02:03,308
And that's it. And that's all of it! All right,
so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.

713
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:06,353
I don't mind saying
that I'm sorry, bad luck.

714
01:02:06,645 --> 01:02:08,797
If I had good luck to spare
he could have some!

715
01:02:08,897 --> 01:02:10,883
I wish we could have good luck
all the time.

716
01:02:10,983 --> 01:02:15,611
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings! But we don't.

717
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:29,125
Well, there's an end of you.

718
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:32,028
What'll you do now? Sit by the fire...

719
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:34,280
and make goslings in the ash?

720
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,424
Not at all, Alice.

721
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,719
I expect I'll write a bit...

722
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,263
I'll write...

723
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:45,308
I'll read, I'll think.

724
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,768
I think I'll learn to fish.

725
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,482
I'll play with my grandchildren
when son Roper's done his duty.

726
01:02:56,234 --> 01:02:59,654
- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!

727
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:06,019
Poor, silly man, you think
they'll leave you here to think?

728
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,580
If we govern our tongues, they will!

729
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:16,796
I have a word to say on that. I've made
no statement. I've resigned, that's all.

730
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:22,076
The King is made, by act of parliament,
Supreme Head of the Church in England.

731
01:03:22,176 --> 01:03:26,455
This English Church will divorce him from
the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.

732
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:30,434
But on any of these matters,
have you heard me make a statement?

733
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,602
No.

734
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:35,673
If I'm to lose my rank and fall to
housekeeping, I want to know the reason.

735
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:37,800
- So make a statement now.
- No.

736
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,886
Alice, it's a point of law.
Accept it from me...

737
01:03:40,986 --> 01:03:43,889
that in silence is my safety,
under the law.

738
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:47,643
And my silence must be absolute,
it must extend to you.

739
01:03:47,743 --> 01:03:49,870
In short, you don't trust me.

740
01:03:53,582 --> 01:03:57,543
I'm the Lord Chief Justice,
I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.

741
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,237
I take your hand...

742
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:03,199
I clamp it on the Bible,
on the blessed Cross and I say:

743
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:06,678
"Woman, has your husband
made a statement on these matters?

744
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:10,723
"On peril of your soul remember,
what is your answer?"

745
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:13,893
No.

746
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,939
And so it must remain.

747
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:29,408
Have you opened your mind to Meg?

748
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,661
Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?

749
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,748
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.

750
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,637
This is a dangerous matter then...

751
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,390
if you've not told Meg.

752
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,019
I don't think so. No.

753
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,480
When they find I'm silent...

754
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,400
they'll want nothing better
than to leave me silent.

755
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,194
You'll see.

756
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,720
But he's silent, Master Secretary,
why not leave him silent?

757
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,931
Your Grace, not being
a man of letters...

758
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,376
you perhaps don't realize
the extent of his reputation.

759
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:42,420
This silence of his
is bellowing up and down Europe!

760
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,714
In Europe he is claimed
as the King's enemy.

761
01:05:44,814 --> 01:05:47,259
Rubbish! Crank he may be,
traitor he is not.

762
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,778
Exactly. And with a little pressure...

763
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:52,973
With a little pressure
he can be got to say so.

764
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:55,809
That's all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...

765
01:05:55,909 --> 01:05:59,829
- ... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.

766
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:02,999
The King does not agree with you.

767
01:06:08,046 --> 01:06:12,174
What kind of pressure do you think
you can bring to bear?

768
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:16,787
I have evidence that Sir Thomas,
while he was a judge, accepted bribes.

769
01:06:16,887 --> 01:06:18,305
What?

770
01:06:18,597 --> 01:06:22,501
Goddammit! He was the only judge
since Cato who didn't accept bribes!

771
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:25,880
When was there a chancellor
whose possessions, after three years...

772
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,816
totaled £100 and a gold chain?

773
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,139
It is, as you imply, common practice...

774
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:38,267
but a practice may be common
and remain an offence.

775
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,953
This offence could send a man
to the Tower.

776
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,417
Come here.

777
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:51,738
This woman's name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.

778
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:53,948
- She entered a case...
- A property case it was.

779
01:06:54,048 --> 01:06:55,508
Shut your mouth.

780
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:59,120
A property case in the Court of Requests
in April, 1528.

781
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,747
And got a wicked false judgment!

782
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:03,666
And got an impeccably correct judgment
from Sir Thomas.

783
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,835
- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman...

784
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:08,646
about the gift you gave the judge.

785
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:11,482
I gave him a cup, sir.

786
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:15,053
A silver Italian cup I bought in Leicester,
for 100 shillings.

787
01:07:15,153 --> 01:07:17,155
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?

788
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:18,598
Yes, sir, he did.

789
01:07:18,698 --> 01:07:22,159
He did accept it. We can corroborate that.
You can go.

790
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:24,411
- To my way of thinking...
- Go!

791
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:36,006
- Is that your witness?
- No.

792
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:41,553
By an odd coincidence that cup later
came into the hands of Master Rich here.

793
01:07:43,347 --> 01:07:44,473
How?

794
01:07:47,392 --> 01:07:50,479
- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
- Gave it to you? Why?

795
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:52,147
A gift.

796
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:56,275
Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?

797
01:07:56,901 --> 01:07:59,153
When did Thomas give you this thing?

798
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:01,864
I can't exactly remember.

799
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,119
Do you "remember" what you did with it?

800
01:08:07,536 --> 01:08:09,330
- I sold it.
- Where?

801
01:08:09,997 --> 01:08:12,208
- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?

802
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:15,461
No. They've lost all track of it.

803
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:17,171
How convenient.

804
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:21,409
You doubt Master Rich's word,
Your Grace?

805
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:23,844
It had occurred to me.

806
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:28,975
This is the bill of sale.

807
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:44,572
That cow put her case into court in April,
you said. This is dated May.

808
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:48,643
In other words, the moment Thomas knew
the cup was a bribe...

809
01:08:48,743 --> 01:08:52,163
he dropped it into the nearest gutter.

810
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:58,044
The facts will bear that interpretation,
I suppose.

811
01:08:59,296 --> 01:09:02,032
This is a horse that won't run,
Master Secretary.

812
01:09:02,132 --> 01:09:04,909
Just a trial gallop.
We'll find something better.

813
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:07,594
- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.

814
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:11,223
What's that you say?

815
01:09:12,683 --> 01:09:17,104
The King particularly wishes you
to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.

816
01:09:17,563 --> 01:09:19,089
He's not told me that.

817
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,108
Indeed? He told me.

818
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:26,864
Look here, Cromwell...

819
01:09:27,156 --> 01:09:29,325
what's the purpose of all this?

820
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,993
There you have me.

821
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,621
It's a matter of conscience, I think.

822
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:38,333
The King wants Sir Thomas
to bless his marriage.

823
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:43,296
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding
now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.

824
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,259
He won't attend the wedding.

825
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,887
If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.

826
01:09:51,512 --> 01:09:54,682
I really would try, if I were you.

827
01:09:57,185 --> 01:10:00,188
Cromwell, are you threatening me?

828
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:03,650
My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.

829
01:10:04,525 --> 01:10:06,194
This is England!

830
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:25,079
Thomas? Thomas!

831
01:13:31,018 --> 01:13:32,127
Lady Margaret?

832
01:13:32,227 --> 01:13:33,103
Yes.

833
01:13:35,397 --> 01:13:38,899
We've been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.

834
01:13:41,152 --> 01:13:45,489
I have a letter for your father,
Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.

835
01:13:48,909 --> 01:13:53,039
He's to answer certain charges
before Secretary Cromwell.

836
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:58,085
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.

837
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:06,619
Master Rich will make a record
of our conversation.

838
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,746
Good of you to tell me,
Master Secretary.

839
01:14:08,846 --> 01:14:10,331
I think you know one another.

840
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:12,766
Indeed yes, we're old friends.

841
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:16,061
That's a nice gown you have, Richard.

842
01:14:21,232 --> 01:14:23,485
Sir Thomas, believe me.

843
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:27,781
No, that's asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.

844
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:31,868
You have no more sincere admirer
than myself.

845
01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:35,372
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.

846
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:41,194
If I might hear the charges.

847
01:14:41,294 --> 01:14:44,239
- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.

848
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:47,950
Some ambiguities of behavior
I should like to clarify, hardly charges.

849
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,720
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.

850
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,974
Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.

851
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:03,023
The King is not pleased with you.

852
01:15:03,816 --> 01:15:05,317
I am grieved.

853
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:09,597
And yet, do you know that even now,
if you could bring yourself...

854
01:15:09,697 --> 01:15:13,309
to agree with the Church,
universities, the Lords and the Commons...

855
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:17,204
there is no honor which His Majesty
would be likely to deny you?

856
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:21,041
I am well acquainted with
His Grace's generosity.

857
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:25,253
Very well.

858
01:15:27,714 --> 01:15:31,968
You have heard of the so-called
"Holy Maid of Kent"...

859
01:15:32,385 --> 01:15:34,871
who was executed for prophesying
against the King?

860
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:37,140
- Yes, I met her.
- Yes, you met her.

861
01:15:37,307 --> 01:15:40,919
Yet you did not warn His Majesty
of her treason. How was that?

862
01:15:41,019 --> 01:15:44,397
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.

863
01:15:44,772 --> 01:15:47,759
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?

864
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:51,054
- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.

865
01:15:51,154 --> 01:15:56,058
Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain
from meddling in the affairs of state.

866
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,078
I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.

867
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:07,336
- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.

868
01:16:14,426 --> 01:16:18,347
In the June of 1521,
the King published a book.

869
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:20,849
A theological work.

870
01:16:22,351 --> 01:16:25,045
It was called,
A Defense of the Seven Sacraments.

871
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:30,091
For which he was named "Defender
of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.

872
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:33,553
By the Bishop of Rome,
or do you insist on "pope"?

873
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:37,823
No. "Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn't alter his authority.

874
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:44,272
Thank you. You come to the point
very readily. What is that authority?

875
01:16:44,372 --> 01:16:46,440
For example, in the Church of England...

876
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:49,377
what exactly is
the Bishop of Rome's authority?

877
01:16:50,294 --> 01:16:54,632
You will find it very ably set out
and defended, Master Secretary...

878
01:16:54,882 --> 01:16:56,676
in the King's book.

879
01:16:57,259 --> 01:17:00,580
In the book published under
the King's name, would be more accurate.

880
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,165
- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.

881
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:05,125
I don't mean you actually held the pen.

882
01:17:05,225 --> 01:17:08,044
I answered to my best ability,
some points of common law...

883
01:17:08,144 --> 01:17:10,463
which the King put to me,
as I was bound to do.

884
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:12,132
Do you deny you instigated it?

885
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:15,802
It was from first to last
the King's own project.

886
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:17,028
The King says not.

887
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:22,826
The King knows the truth of it.

888
01:17:23,702 --> 01:17:25,979
And whatever he may have said to you...

889
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,291
he will not give evidence
to support this accusation.

890
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:31,985
Why not?

891
01:17:32,085 --> 01:17:36,381
Because evidence is given on oath,
and he will not perjure himself.

892
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:40,718
If you don't know that,
then you don't yet know him.

893
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,766
Sir Thomas More.

894
01:17:47,933 --> 01:17:49,126
Have you anything to say...

895
01:17:49,226 --> 01:17:51,603
regarding the King's marriage
with Queen Anne?

896
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,840
I understood
I was not to be asked that again.

897
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,051
Then you understood wrongly.
These charges...

898
01:17:57,151 --> 01:18:01,614
They are terrors for children,
Master Secretary, not for me!

899
01:18:07,328 --> 01:18:10,064
Then know that the King
commands me to charge you...

900
01:18:10,164 --> 01:18:12,750
in his name, with great ingratitude!

901
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:17,612
And to tell you that there never was,
nor could be, so villainous a servant...

902
01:18:17,712 --> 01:18:20,590
nor so traitorous
a subject, as yourself!

903
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:23,468
So...

904
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:28,473
I am brought here at last.

905
01:18:29,432 --> 01:18:30,475
Brought?

906
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:34,437
You've brought yourself
to where you stand now.

907
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:37,857
You may go.

908
01:18:43,404 --> 01:18:44,781
For the present.

909
01:18:51,203 --> 01:18:52,829
What will you do now?

910
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,917
Whatever's necessary.

911
01:19:05,884 --> 01:19:06,927
Boat!

912
01:19:23,818 --> 01:19:26,821
Oh, come, come,
it's not as bad as all that!

913
01:19:32,285 --> 01:19:33,536
Howard!

914
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,168
I can't get home.

915
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:43,754
They won't bring me a boat.

916
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:45,798
Do you blame them?

917
01:19:45,965 --> 01:19:47,591
Is it as bad as that?

918
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,386
It's every bit as bad as that!

919
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:53,998
Then it's good of you
to be seen with me.

920
01:19:54,098 --> 01:19:55,683
I followed you.

921
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:58,560
Were you followed?

922
01:20:09,112 --> 01:20:11,306
- You're dangerous to know!
- Then don't know me.

923
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,350
- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.

924
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:17,495
- I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.
- What's to be done then?

925
01:20:17,621 --> 01:20:19,689
- Give in.
- I can't give in, Howard.

926
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:22,067
Our friendship's more mutable than that.

927
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:24,903
The one fixed point in the world
of turning friendship...

928
01:20:25,003 --> 01:20:28,740
- ... is that Sir More won't give in.
- To me it has to be, for that's myself.

929
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,467
Affection goes as deep in me
as you, I think.

930
01:20:31,925 --> 01:20:36,388
But only God is love right through,
Howard, and that's my self.

931
01:20:37,973 --> 01:20:39,350
And who are you?

932
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:43,170
A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!

933
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:47,299
We're supposed to be the proud ones,
the arrogant ones, we've all given in.

934
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:49,051
Why must you stand out?

935
01:20:49,151 --> 01:20:52,529
Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!

936
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:57,326
You'll break my heart.

937
01:20:58,535 --> 01:21:02,414
No one is safe, Howard,
and you have a son.

938
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,044
We'll end our friendship now.

939
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:10,588
- For friendship's sake?
- Yes.

940
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:12,298
Daft!

941
01:21:20,056 --> 01:21:21,975
Norfolk, you're a fool!

942
01:21:23,393 --> 01:21:25,837
You can't place a quarrel,
you haven't the style.

943
01:21:25,937 --> 01:21:29,549
Hear me out. You and your class
have given in, as you rightly call it...

944
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:32,635
'cause this country's religion
means nothing to you at all.

945
01:21:32,735 --> 01:21:34,988
Well, that's a foolish saying
for a start!

946
01:21:35,947 --> 01:21:37,473
The nobility of England...

947
01:21:37,573 --> 01:21:41,685
The nobility of England would have
snored through the Sermon on the Mount!

948
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:45,580
But you'll labor like scholars
over a bulldog's pedigree.

949
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,941
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.

950
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:51,753
We've had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.

951
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:54,865
You can be cruel when you want,
but I've always known that.

952
01:21:54,965 --> 01:21:58,176
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?

953
01:22:00,178 --> 01:22:01,413
- Yes.
- It's their nature?

954
01:22:01,513 --> 01:22:03,290
- Yes.
- It's why you breed them?

955
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:04,600
It's so with men.

956
01:22:05,017 --> 01:22:07,002
I will not give in, because I oppose it.

957
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:12,691
Not my pride, not my spleen,
nor any other of my appetites, but I do, I.

958
01:22:13,566 --> 01:22:17,637
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,
no sinew that serves no appetite...

959
01:22:17,737 --> 01:22:20,056
of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
There is!

960
01:22:20,156 --> 01:22:22,099
- Give that some exercise, my lord!
- Thomas!

961
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:25,228
As you stand you'll go before your Maker
ill conditioned!

962
01:22:25,328 --> 01:22:26,020
Now steady.

963
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:31,042
And he'll think that, somewhere back along
your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!

964
01:22:45,431 --> 01:22:49,476
Cast in this very house
on April 3, last year...

965
01:22:49,851 --> 01:22:54,214
it is a matter very fit
for the Commons, gathered here...

966
01:22:54,314 --> 01:22:56,900
in parliament, to take in hand.

967
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:01,321
Or, in consequence
of the decay of guilds...

968
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:05,725
the woolen cloth, now coming out
of Yorkshire, Lincoln...

969
01:23:05,825 --> 01:23:09,329
and the like,
is not to blame and this...

970
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:14,626
I will defer the rest
of my matter to later.

971
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:26,553
That the loyal Commons, here assembled,
will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.

972
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:31,225
For as much as it concerns the King's
new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.

973
01:23:31,517 --> 01:23:35,271
Both matters pleasing
to a loyal subject.

974
01:23:36,897 --> 01:23:38,649
Mark, my Masters...

975
01:23:38,983 --> 01:23:43,487
there is among us
a brood of discreet traitors...

976
01:23:43,862 --> 01:23:46,182
to which deceit
the King can brook no longer.

977
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:52,329
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now
drive these subtle foxes from their covert.

978
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:21,966
Father?

979
01:24:22,066 --> 01:24:23,151
Margaret!

980
01:24:24,736 --> 01:24:26,446
I couldn't get a boat.

981
01:24:26,988 --> 01:24:28,598
What is it, Meg?

982
01:24:28,698 --> 01:24:31,366
Father, there's a new act
going through parliament.

983
01:24:33,577 --> 01:24:36,063
And by this act,
they're going to administer an oath...

984
01:24:36,163 --> 01:24:37,956
about the marriage.

985
01:24:38,624 --> 01:24:40,375
On what compulsion is the oath?

986
01:24:41,627 --> 01:24:43,946
- High treason.
- But what is the wording?

987
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:46,406
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.

988
01:24:46,506 --> 01:24:47,616
Tell me the words.

989
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:50,410
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.

990
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:51,136
Take it?

991
01:24:51,428 --> 01:24:53,639
And if it can be taken,
you must take it, too.

992
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:55,374
No!

993
01:24:55,474 --> 01:24:59,895
Listen, Meg. God made the angels
to show him splendor.

994
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:05,107
As he made animals for innocence
and plants for their simplicity.

995
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:10,071
But Man he made to serve him wittily,
in the tangle of his mind.

996
01:25:10,529 --> 01:25:13,850
If he suffers us to come to such a case
that there is no escaping...

997
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,769
then we may stand to our tackle
as best we can.

998
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:21,916
And yes, Meg, then we can clamor like
champions, if we have the spittle for it.

999
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:26,195
But it's God's part, not our own,
to bring ourselves to such a pass.

1000
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:29,674
Our natural business lies in escaping.

1001
01:25:31,884 --> 01:25:33,886
If I can take this oath, I will.

1002
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:40,792
I would, for my sake,
you could take the oath.

1003
01:25:40,892 --> 01:25:43,478
I never took a man into the Tower
less willingly.

1004
01:25:43,895 --> 01:25:45,730
Thank you, Master Governor.

1005
01:25:48,733 --> 01:25:50,110
Thank you.

1006
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:53,571
Sir Thomas.

1007
01:27:27,204 --> 01:27:28,413
Sir Thomas.

1008
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:32,834
Sir Thomas!

1009
01:27:53,522 --> 01:27:55,524
This is iniquitous.

1010
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:01,654
- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.

1011
01:28:58,793 --> 01:29:00,128
Sit down.

1012
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,955
This is the Seventh Commission
to inquire into the case...

1013
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:14,041
of Sir Thomas More, appointed
by His Majesty's Council.

1014
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:16,085
Have you anything to say?

1015
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:17,269
No.

1016
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,049
- Seen this document before?
- Many times.

1017
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:23,759
It is the Act of Succession.

1018
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:26,345
These are the names
of those who have sworn to it.

1019
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:29,431
- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?

1020
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,616
No.

1021
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,410
Thomas, we must know...

1022
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:41,609
We must know plainly whether you
recognize the offspring of Queen Anne...

1023
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,695
as heirs to the throne.

1024
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,406
The King in parliament
tells me that they are.

1025
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:49,033
- Of course I recognize them.
- Will you swear to it?

1026
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:52,120
- Yes.
- Then why won't he swear to the act?

1027
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:55,039
Because there is more
than that in the act.

1028
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:59,669
Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the
preamble that the King's former marriage...

1029
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,754
to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...

1030
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:06,567
she being his brother's widow and the Pope
having no authority to sanction it.

1031
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,737
Is that what you deny?

1032
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:17,786
Is that what you dispute?

1033
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:27,212
Is that what you are not sure of?

1034
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:37,873
You insult His Majesty and Council
in the person of the Lord Archbishop!

1035
01:30:37,973 --> 01:30:39,208
I insult no one.

1036
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:43,186
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.

1037
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:46,840
- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not "must be," may be.

1038
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,633
It's a fair assumption!

1039
01:30:48,733 --> 01:30:52,595
The law requires more than an assumption,
the law requires a fact.

1040
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:55,890
Of course, I cannot judge
your legal standing in the case...

1041
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:58,809
but until I know the ground
of your objections...

1042
01:30:58,909 --> 01:31:02,914
I can only guess
your spiritual standing, too.

1043
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:07,235
If you're willing to guess that, it should be
small matter to guess my objections.

1044
01:31:07,335 --> 01:31:09,320
Then you do have objections to the act?

1045
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,255
Well, we know that, Cromwell!

1046
01:31:11,464 --> 01:31:12,824
No, my lord, you don't.

1047
01:31:12,924 --> 01:31:16,869
You may suppose I have objections,
all you know is that I will not swear to it...

1048
01:31:16,969 --> 01:31:20,014
for which you cannot lawfully
harm me further.

1049
01:31:20,264 --> 01:31:24,793
But if you were right in supposing me
to have objections, and right again...

1050
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:27,420
in supposing my objections
to be treasonable...

1051
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,857
the law would let you cut my head off.

1052
01:31:32,359 --> 01:31:33,985
Oh, yes.

1053
01:31:35,153 --> 01:31:36,763
Well done, Sir Thomas.

1054
01:31:36,863 --> 01:31:40,851
I've been trying to make that clear
to His Grace for some time.

1055
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:43,228
Oh, confound all this!
I'm not a scholar.

1056
01:31:43,328 --> 01:31:45,480
I don't know if the marriage
was lawful or not...

1057
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,666
but damn it, Thomas,
look at these names.

1058
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:51,628
Why can't you do as I did,
and come with us, for fellowship?

1059
01:31:53,088 --> 01:31:56,824
And when we die, and you are sent
to heaven for doing your conscience...

1060
01:31:56,924 --> 01:32:01,971
and I am sent to hell for not doing mine,
will you come with me, for fellowship?

1061
01:32:03,264 --> 01:32:06,542
So, those of us whose names are there,
are damned, Sir Thomas?

1062
01:32:06,642 --> 01:32:09,628
I have no window to look into
another man's conscience.

1063
01:32:09,728 --> 01:32:11,005
I condemn no one.

1064
01:32:11,105 --> 01:32:13,674
- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.

1065
01:32:13,774 --> 01:32:17,011
But that you owe obedience to the King
is not capable of question.

1066
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:20,322
So weigh a doubt against a certainty
and sign.

1067
01:32:23,284 --> 01:32:28,330
Some men think the earth is round,
others think it flat.

1068
01:32:28,539 --> 01:32:31,082
It is a matter capable of question.

1069
01:32:31,874 --> 01:32:36,154
But if it is flat,
will the King's command make it round?

1070
01:32:36,254 --> 01:32:39,591
And if it is round,
will the King's command flatten it?

1071
01:32:40,425 --> 01:32:43,303
No, I will not sign.

1072
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,123
Then you have more regard for
your own doubt than the King's command?

1073
01:32:47,223 --> 01:32:49,501
- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?

1074
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:51,878
No doubt that I will not take this oath.

1075
01:32:51,978 --> 01:32:56,274
But why I will not, you,
Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.

1076
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:59,569
I might get it out of you in other ways.

1077
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,406
You threaten like a dockside bully.

1078
01:33:03,573 --> 01:33:04,807
How should I threaten?

1079
01:33:04,907 --> 01:33:08,744
Like a minister of state, with justice!

1080
01:33:09,453 --> 01:33:12,080
Justice is what you're threatened with.

1081
01:33:12,205 --> 01:33:14,082
Then I am not threatened.

1082
01:33:20,464 --> 01:33:22,758
Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?

1083
01:33:22,966 --> 01:33:25,410
Aye. The prisoner may retire
as he requests.

1084
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:28,680
- Unless you...
- I see no purpose in prolonging this.

1085
01:33:32,684 --> 01:33:35,812
Then, goodnight, Thomas.

1086
01:33:40,983 --> 01:33:43,486
May I have one or two more books?

1087
01:33:44,362 --> 01:33:45,863
Why, you have books?

1088
01:33:46,322 --> 01:33:47,181
Yes.

1089
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:49,825
I didn't know, you shouldn't have.

1090
01:33:58,084 --> 01:33:59,902
May I see my family?

1091
01:34:00,002 --> 01:34:01,087
No.

1092
01:34:07,551 --> 01:34:08,594
Captain!

1093
01:34:08,886 --> 01:34:10,596
Master Secretary?

1094
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:15,041
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak
of the King's divorce, supremacy...

1095
01:34:15,141 --> 01:34:17,419
- ... or the King's marriage?
- No, not a word.

1096
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:20,230
If he does, you will repeat it to me.

1097
01:34:21,231 --> 01:34:22,607
Of course.

1098
01:34:27,737 --> 01:34:28,613
Rich.

1099
01:34:28,738 --> 01:34:29,598
Secretary?

1100
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:32,409
Tomorrow morning,
remove the prisoner's books.

1101
01:34:32,576 --> 01:34:34,269
Is that necessary?

1102
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:37,397
With regards to this case,
the King is becoming impatient.

1103
01:34:37,497 --> 01:34:39,357
- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.

1104
01:34:39,457 --> 01:34:42,752
The King's impatience
will embrace a duke or two.

1105
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,013
Master Secretary.

1106
01:34:55,973 --> 01:34:58,142
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.

1107
01:34:59,143 --> 01:35:01,186
The Attorney General for Wales.

1108
01:35:01,437 --> 01:35:03,230
His post is vacant.

1109
01:35:04,356 --> 01:35:06,567
You said that I might approach you.

1110
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,695
Not now, Rich.

1111
01:35:12,781 --> 01:35:14,992
He must submit. He must!

1112
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,202
Rack him.

1113
01:35:21,206 --> 01:35:24,918
No. The King's conscience
will not permit it.

1114
01:35:25,293 --> 01:35:27,670
We have to find some other way.

1115
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:38,389
Sir Thomas!

1116
01:35:40,808 --> 01:35:41,626
Father!

1117
01:35:41,726 --> 01:35:43,102
What? Margaret?

1118
01:35:43,978 --> 01:35:45,480
Father!

1119
01:35:46,189 --> 01:35:49,342
Meg. For God's sake,
they haven't put you in here?

1120
01:35:49,442 --> 01:35:51,845
- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.

1121
01:35:51,945 --> 01:35:53,363
Father.

1122
01:35:54,405 --> 01:35:56,741
- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.

1123
01:36:00,327 --> 01:36:02,120
Good morning, Will.

1124
01:36:07,501 --> 01:36:09,836
Well, this is a hellish place!

1125
01:36:10,087 --> 01:36:13,115
Except it's keeping me from you,
my dears, it isn't so bad.

1126
01:36:13,215 --> 01:36:14,950
It's remarkably like any other place.

1127
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:17,970
- It drips!
- Yes. It's too near the river.

1128
01:36:29,856 --> 01:36:30,983
Well, what is it?

1129
01:36:33,442 --> 01:36:36,988
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!

1130
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:41,367
Is this why they've let you come?

1131
01:36:41,492 --> 01:36:42,535
Yes.

1132
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:47,498
Meg's under oath to persuade you.

1133
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:51,002
That was silly, Meg.

1134
01:36:59,343 --> 01:37:01,512
How do you plan to do that?

1135
01:37:03,556 --> 01:37:04,765
Father.

1136
01:37:05,391 --> 01:37:08,919
"God more regards the thoughts
of the heart than the words of the mouth."

1137
01:37:09,019 --> 01:37:11,379
- Well, so you've always told me.
- Yes.

1138
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:14,633
Then say the words of the oath
and in your heart think otherwise.

1139
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:17,986
What is an oath then,
but words we say to God?

1140
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:25,952
Listen, Meg.

1141
01:37:26,745 --> 01:37:30,832
When a man takes an oath, he's holding
his own self in his own hands...

1142
01:37:31,124 --> 01:37:32,417
like water.

1143
01:37:32,626 --> 01:37:37,672
And if he opens his fingers then,
he needn't hope to find himself again.

1144
01:37:38,882 --> 01:37:43,802
Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be
loathed to think your father one of them.

1145
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:49,308
- I have another argument.
- Oh, Meg.

1146
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,772
In any state that was half good,
you would be raised up high, not here...

1147
01:37:54,939 --> 01:37:57,942
- ... for what you've done already.
- All right.

1148
01:37:58,275 --> 01:38:00,886
It's not your fault
the state's three-quarters bad.

1149
01:38:00,986 --> 01:38:01,720
No.

1150
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:04,431
If you elect to suffer for it,
you elect to be a hero.

1151
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:06,075
That's very neat.

1152
01:38:06,575 --> 01:38:10,913
But look now. If we lived in a state
where virtue was profitable...

1153
01:38:11,247 --> 01:38:13,524
common sense would make us saintly.

1154
01:38:13,624 --> 01:38:18,044
But since we see that avarice, anger,
pride and stupidity...

1155
01:38:18,294 --> 01:38:23,299
commonly profit far beyond charity,
modesty, justice and thought...

1156
01:38:23,466 --> 01:38:26,052
perhaps we must stand fast a little...

1157
01:38:26,219 --> 01:38:28,721
even at the risk of being heroes.

1158
01:38:33,393 --> 01:38:34,794
But in reason!

1159
01:38:34,894 --> 01:38:38,356
Haven't you done as much
as God can reasonably want?

1160
01:38:43,111 --> 01:38:47,031
Well, finally it isn't
a matter of reason.

1161
01:38:47,156 --> 01:38:49,533
Finally, it's a matter of love.

1162
01:38:52,786 --> 01:38:55,898
You're content then to be shut up here
with mice and rats...

1163
01:38:55,998 --> 01:38:58,275
- ... when you might be home with us?
- Content?

1164
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:03,589
If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be
through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.

1165
01:39:08,218 --> 01:39:10,913
I haven't told you
what the house is like without you.

1166
01:39:11,013 --> 01:39:12,164
Don't, Meg.

1167
01:39:12,264 --> 01:39:15,501
- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.

1168
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:17,853
We don't read because we've no candles.

1169
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:20,923
We don't talk because we wonder
what they're doing to you.

1170
01:39:21,023 --> 01:39:23,716
The King is more merciful.
He doesn't use the rack.

1171
01:39:23,816 --> 01:39:25,551
Two minutes to go, sir.

1172
01:39:25,651 --> 01:39:28,321
- I thought you'd like to know.
- Two minutes!

1173
01:39:28,946 --> 01:39:31,490
- Jailer!
- Sorry, sir. Two minutes.

1174
01:39:33,284 --> 01:39:37,188
Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.

1175
01:39:37,288 --> 01:39:39,273
- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.

1176
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:41,150
They won't let me see you again.

1177
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:44,153
You must all go on the same day,
but not on the same boat.

1178
01:39:44,253 --> 01:39:47,573
- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.

1179
01:39:47,673 --> 01:39:50,259
There'll be no trial, they have no case.

1180
01:39:51,844 --> 01:39:53,846
Do this for me, I beseech you.

1181
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:55,790
- Will?
- Yes, sir.

1182
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:57,724
- Margaret?
- Yes.

1183
01:39:58,391 --> 01:39:59,434
Alice?

1184
01:40:05,398 --> 01:40:08,151
- Alice, I command you!
- Right.

1185
01:40:15,533 --> 01:40:17,535
This is splendid.

1186
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:21,106
- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.

1187
01:40:21,206 --> 01:40:22,249
Yes.

1188
01:40:25,001 --> 01:40:27,571
You still make
a superlative custard, Alice.

1189
01:40:27,671 --> 01:40:28,755
Do I?

1190
01:40:31,299 --> 01:40:33,634
That's a nice dress you have on.

1191
01:40:34,969 --> 01:40:36,720
Nice color anyway.

1192
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:39,139
My God, you think little of me!

1193
01:40:39,723 --> 01:40:40,666
I know I'm a fool...

1194
01:40:40,766 --> 01:40:44,003
but I'm not such a fool
as to be lamenting for my dresses...

1195
01:40:44,103 --> 01:40:46,564
or to relish complimenting
on my custards.

1196
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:48,440
I'm well rebuked.

1197
01:40:49,817 --> 01:40:51,443
- Alice...
- No!

1198
01:40:54,613 --> 01:40:59,410
I'm sick with fear when I think
of the worst they may do to me.

1199
01:40:59,577 --> 01:41:04,690
But worse than that will be to go
with you not understanding why I go.

1200
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:05,815
I don't.

1201
01:41:05,915 --> 01:41:11,070
If you can tell me that you understand,
I might make a good death, if I have to.

1202
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:15,366
- Your death's no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.

1203
01:41:15,466 --> 01:41:16,634
I don't!

1204
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:18,786
I don't believe this had to happen!

1205
01:41:18,886 --> 01:41:21,122
If you say that
I don't see how I'm to face it.

1206
01:41:21,222 --> 01:41:22,557
It's the truth!

1207
01:41:22,974 --> 01:41:26,144
- You're an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.

1208
01:41:26,936 --> 01:41:29,130
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of...

1209
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:32,150
that when you've gone,
I shall hate you for it.

1210
01:41:36,571 --> 01:41:38,281
You mustn't, Alice.

1211
01:41:41,783 --> 01:41:43,076
You mustn't.

1212
01:41:47,789 --> 01:41:52,127
As for understanding, I understand you're
the best man I ever met or ever likely to.

1213
01:41:52,586 --> 01:41:57,533
And if you go, God knows why I suppose,
though as God's my witness...

1214
01:41:57,633 --> 01:41:59,885
God's kept deadly quiet about it.

1215
01:42:00,594 --> 01:42:04,640
And if any one wants to know
my opinion of the King and his Council...

1216
01:42:04,765 --> 01:42:07,434
he only has to ask for it!

1217
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:14,358
Why, it's a lion I married.

1218
01:42:14,607 --> 01:42:16,400
A lion. A lion.

1219
01:42:22,323 --> 01:42:24,575
This is good.

1220
01:42:27,286 --> 01:42:28,663
It's very good.

1221
01:42:29,455 --> 01:42:31,165
Sorry, Sir Thomas!

1222
01:42:31,624 --> 01:42:33,776
- Oh, for pity's sake!
- Time's up, sir.

1223
01:42:33,876 --> 01:42:36,696
- But one more minute!
- You don't know what you're asking.

1224
01:42:36,796 --> 01:42:38,656
- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven's sake.

1225
01:42:38,756 --> 01:42:40,508
Now, don't do that, sir.

1226
01:42:43,427 --> 01:42:45,763
Now, madam, don't make trouble.

1227
01:42:48,683 --> 01:42:51,017
Come along, please, Lady Alice.

1228
01:42:54,896 --> 01:42:57,232
Take your muddy paws off me!

1229
01:42:57,774 --> 01:43:00,860
Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!

1230
01:43:01,611 --> 01:43:03,905
I'll see you suffer for this!

1231
01:43:05,156 --> 01:43:06,408
Goodbye.

1232
01:43:21,548 --> 01:43:23,924
You must understand my position, sir.

1233
01:43:24,258 --> 01:43:27,887
I'm a plain, simple man
and I just want to keep out of trouble.

1234
01:43:37,771 --> 01:43:42,401
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Savior,
clear my wits.

1235
01:43:43,736 --> 01:43:48,032
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God,
comfort my wife and daughter...

1236
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:51,035
and forgive me for them.

1237
01:44:55,514 --> 01:44:59,960
Sir Thomas More, though you have
heinously offended the King's majesty...

1238
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:05,232
we hope that if you'll even now fore think
and repent of obstinate opinion...

1239
01:45:05,649 --> 01:45:08,442
you may still taste his gracious pardon.

1240
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:11,696
My lords, I thank you.

1241
01:45:12,446 --> 01:45:14,932
As for the matters
you may charge me with...

1242
01:45:15,032 --> 01:45:18,811
I fear from my present weakness,
that neither my wit...

1243
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:21,163
nor my memory will serve...

1244
01:45:21,789 --> 01:45:23,791
to make sufficient answer.

1245
01:45:25,084 --> 01:45:27,378
I should be glad to sit down.

1246
01:45:27,545 --> 01:45:29,297
A chair for the prisoner.

1247
01:45:43,768 --> 01:45:46,004
Master Secretary Cromwell,
have you the charge?

1248
01:45:46,104 --> 01:45:48,523
- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.

1249
01:45:52,235 --> 01:45:55,514
"That you did willfully and maliciously
deny and deprive...

1250
01:45:55,614 --> 01:45:59,451
"our liege, Lord Henry,
of his undoubted certain title...

1251
01:45:59,701 --> 01:46:02,621
"Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

1252
01:46:04,122 --> 01:46:07,417
But, I have never denied this title.

1253
01:46:09,794 --> 01:46:13,632
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth,
and again at Richmond...

1254
01:46:13,757 --> 01:46:16,258
you stubbornly refused the oath.

1255
01:46:16,425 --> 01:46:17,743
Was this no denial?

1256
01:46:17,843 --> 01:46:19,929
No, this was silence.

1257
01:46:20,262 --> 01:46:23,599
And for my silence,
I am punished with imprisonment.

1258
01:46:24,892 --> 01:46:29,104
- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.

1259
01:46:29,897 --> 01:46:32,942
For which the punishment
is not imprisonment.

1260
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:34,443
Death...

1261
01:46:34,985 --> 01:46:37,363
comes for us all, my lords.

1262
01:46:37,655 --> 01:46:39,849
Yes, even for kings he comes.

1263
01:46:39,949 --> 01:46:43,035
The death of kings is not in question,
Sir Thomas.

1264
01:46:43,285 --> 01:46:46,330
Nor mine, I trust,
until I'm proven guilty.

1265
01:46:46,455 --> 01:46:49,858
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas,
as it always has!

1266
01:46:49,958 --> 01:46:51,793
Is that so, my lord?

1267
01:46:52,418 --> 01:46:54,170
Then I'll keep a good grip on it.

1268
01:47:01,135 --> 01:47:02,720
So, Sir Thomas...

1269
01:47:03,304 --> 01:47:05,348
you stand on your silence?

1270
01:47:06,015 --> 01:47:07,183
I do.

1271
01:47:07,934 --> 01:47:10,019
But, gentlemen of the jury...

1272
01:47:10,812 --> 01:47:13,606
there are many kinds of silence.

1273
01:47:14,065 --> 01:47:17,193
Consider first the silence of a man
when he is dead.

1274
01:47:17,527 --> 01:47:20,680
Suppose we go into the room
where he is laid out and we listen.

1275
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:21,948
What do we hear?

1276
01:47:23,449 --> 01:47:24,741
Silence.

1277
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,328
What does it betoken, this silence?

1278
01:47:28,912 --> 01:47:31,582
Nothing. This is silence
pure and simple.

1279
01:47:31,915 --> 01:47:33,692
But let us take another case.

1280
01:47:33,792 --> 01:47:36,653
Suppose I were to take a dagger
from my sleeve...

1281
01:47:36,753 --> 01:47:38,739
and make to kill the prisoner with it.

1282
01:47:38,839 --> 01:47:43,160
And my lordships there, instead of crying
out for me to stop, maintain their silence.

1283
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,178
That would betoken!

1284
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:48,807
It would betoken a willingness
that I should do it.

1285
01:47:49,016 --> 01:47:51,935
And under the law,
they would be guilty with me.

1286
01:47:52,895 --> 01:47:56,607
So silence can,
according to the circumstances...

1287
01:47:57,524 --> 01:47:58,649
speak.

1288
01:47:59,317 --> 01:48:03,696
Let us consider now the circumstances
of the prisoner's silence.

1289
01:48:04,322 --> 01:48:08,100
The oath was put to loyal subjects
all over the country who all declared...

1290
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,353
His Grace's title to be just and good!

1291
01:48:10,453 --> 01:48:13,539
But when it came to the prisoner,
he refused!

1292
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:17,793
He calls this "silence."

1293
01:48:18,961 --> 01:48:21,714
Yet, is there a man in this court...

1294
01:48:22,506 --> 01:48:25,468
Is there a man in this country...

1295
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:30,014
who does not know
Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?

1296
01:48:32,682 --> 01:48:34,517
Yet, how can this be?

1297
01:48:34,893 --> 01:48:37,854
Because this silence betokened...

1298
01:48:38,355 --> 01:48:43,276
nay, this silence was not silence at all,
but most eloquent denial!

1299
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:47,072
Not so.

1300
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:50,742
Not so, Master Secretary.

1301
01:48:53,536 --> 01:48:56,857
The maxim of the law is,
"Silence gives consent."

1302
01:48:56,957 --> 01:49:00,068
If, therefore, you wish to construe
what my silence betokened...

1303
01:49:00,168 --> 01:49:04,381
you must construe that I consented,
not that I denied.

1304
01:49:05,674 --> 01:49:08,492
Is that in fact what the world
construes from it?

1305
01:49:08,592 --> 01:49:11,871
Do you pretend that is what you wish
the world to construe from it?

1306
01:49:11,971 --> 01:49:15,266
The world must construe
according to its wits.

1307
01:49:15,432 --> 01:49:18,686
This court must construe
according to the law.

1308
01:49:28,237 --> 01:49:31,198
My lords, I wish to call
Sir Richard Rich!

1309
01:49:32,866 --> 01:49:35,619
Richard Rich, come into court.

1310
01:49:35,911 --> 01:49:37,580
Richard Rich!

1311
01:49:58,892 --> 01:50:02,587
"I do swear the evidence I'll give
before the court shall be the truth...

1312
01:50:02,687 --> 01:50:05,048
"the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."

1313
01:50:05,148 --> 01:50:06,858
"So help me God," sir.

1314
01:50:07,275 --> 01:50:08,693
"So help me God."

1315
01:50:11,487 --> 01:50:15,240
Now Rich, on May 12,
you were at the Tower?

1316
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:17,226
- I was.
- For what purpose?

1317
01:50:17,326 --> 01:50:19,603
I was sent to carry away
the prisoner's books.

1318
01:50:19,703 --> 01:50:21,939
- Did you talk with the prisoner?
- Yes.

1319
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:24,775
Did you talk of the King's supremacy
of the Church?

1320
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:25,918
Yes.

1321
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:27,836
What did you say?

1322
01:50:28,503 --> 01:50:31,573
I said to him, "Supposing there were
an act of parliament...

1323
01:50:31,673 --> 01:50:34,326
"to say that I, Richard Rich,
were to be king.

1324
01:50:34,426 --> 01:50:37,346
"Would not you, Master More,
take me for king?"

1325
01:50:37,554 --> 01:50:39,014
"That I would," he said.

1326
01:50:42,768 --> 01:50:45,062
"For then you would be king."

1327
01:50:47,481 --> 01:50:48,523
Yes?

1328
01:50:49,815 --> 01:50:53,319
Then he said,
"But I will put you a higher case.

1329
01:50:54,028 --> 01:50:59,033
"How, if there were an act of parliament,
to say that God should not be God?"

1330
01:50:59,408 --> 01:51:02,119
- This is true and then you said...
- Silence!

1331
01:51:02,745 --> 01:51:03,955
Continue.

1332
01:51:06,624 --> 01:51:10,503
But then I said,
"I will put you a middle case.

1333
01:51:11,003 --> 01:51:13,656
"Parliament has made our King
Head of the Church.

1334
01:51:13,756 --> 01:51:15,758
"Why will you not accept him?"

1335
01:51:19,178 --> 01:51:20,263
Well?

1336
01:51:23,683 --> 01:51:27,477
And then he said,
"Parliament had not the power to do it."

1337
01:51:29,229 --> 01:51:31,481
Repeat the prisoner's words.

1338
01:51:33,275 --> 01:51:34,359
He said:

1339
01:51:35,777 --> 01:51:38,280
"Parliament had not the competence."

1340
01:51:40,865 --> 01:51:42,742
Or words to that effect.

1341
01:51:43,034 --> 01:51:45,203
He denied the title!

1342
01:51:45,537 --> 01:51:46,872
He did.

1343
01:51:55,088 --> 01:52:00,009
In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier
for your perjury than my peril.

1344
01:52:00,134 --> 01:52:02,761
- Do you deny this?
- Yes!

1345
01:52:03,345 --> 01:52:06,582
You know if I were a man
who heeded not the taking of an oath...

1346
01:52:06,682 --> 01:52:08,142
I need not be here.

1347
01:52:08,726 --> 01:52:11,228
Now, I will take an oath.

1348
01:52:13,063 --> 01:52:15,941
If what Master Rich has said is true...

1349
01:52:16,358 --> 01:52:20,321
I pray I may never see God in the face.

1350
01:52:21,363 --> 01:52:25,075
Which I would not say, were it otherwise,
for anything on earth!

1351
01:52:25,201 --> 01:52:27,912
- That is not evidence.
- Is it probable...

1352
01:52:28,704 --> 01:52:33,274
Is it probable
that after so long a silence on this...

1353
01:52:33,374 --> 01:52:35,944
the very point
so urgently sought of me...

1354
01:52:36,044 --> 01:52:39,839
I should open my mind
to such a man as that?

1355
01:52:41,424 --> 01:52:44,802
Sir Richard, do you wish
to modify your testimony?

1356
01:52:45,929 --> 01:52:47,038
No, my lord.

1357
01:52:47,138 --> 01:52:49,749
Is there anything you wish
to take away from it?

1358
01:52:49,849 --> 01:52:50,959
No, my lord.

1359
01:52:51,059 --> 01:52:52,936
Have you anything to add?

1360
01:52:53,228 --> 01:52:54,520
No, my lord.

1361
01:52:55,813 --> 01:52:59,067
- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?

1362
01:53:03,029 --> 01:53:04,697
I am a dead man.

1363
01:53:08,408 --> 01:53:10,327
You have your will of me.

1364
01:53:11,453 --> 01:53:13,789
Then the witness may withdraw.

1365
01:53:21,129 --> 01:53:24,341
There is one question
I would like to ask the witness.

1366
01:53:26,885 --> 01:53:30,097
That's a chain of office you're wearing.
May I see it?

1367
01:53:38,146 --> 01:53:39,523
The Red Dragon.

1368
01:53:39,856 --> 01:53:41,048
What's this?

1369
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:44,277
Sir Richard is appointed
Attorney General for Wales.

1370
01:53:44,485 --> 01:53:45,820
For Wales.

1371
01:53:47,363 --> 01:53:52,535
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing
to give his soul for the whole world.

1372
01:53:54,412 --> 01:53:55,913
But for Wales.

1373
01:54:04,297 --> 01:54:05,798
My lords! I've done.

1374
01:54:06,883 --> 01:54:09,510
The jury will retire
and consider the evidence.

1375
01:54:11,596 --> 01:54:16,182
Considering the evidence, it shouldn't
be necessary for them to retire.

1376
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:20,353
Is it necessary?

1377
01:54:27,152 --> 01:54:29,905
Then is the prisoner
guilty or not guilty?

1378
01:54:35,076 --> 01:54:36,745
Guilty, my lord!

1379
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:51,050
Sir Thomas More, you have been
found guilty of high treason.

1380
01:54:51,175 --> 01:54:53,636
- The sentence of the court...
- My lords!

1381
01:54:54,428 --> 01:54:58,390
When I was practicing the law,
the manner was to ask the prisoner...

1382
01:54:58,515 --> 01:55:02,436
before pronouncing sentence,
if he had anything to say.

1383
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:04,605
Have you anything to say?

1384
01:55:05,272 --> 01:55:06,315
Yes.

1385
01:55:17,451 --> 01:55:20,538
Since the court has determined
to condemn me...

1386
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:23,415
God knoweth how...

1387
01:55:24,499 --> 01:55:27,794
I will now discharge my mind...

1388
01:55:28,378 --> 01:55:32,715
concerning the indictment
and the King's title.

1389
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:40,765
The indictment is grounded
in an act of parliament...

1390
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:43,960
which is directly repugnant...

1391
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:47,730
to the law of God and His Holy Church.

1392
01:55:47,897 --> 01:55:52,135
The supreme government of which
no temper able person...

1393
01:55:52,235 --> 01:55:56,406
may by any law presume to take upon him.

1394
01:55:57,282 --> 01:55:58,991
This was granted...

1395
01:55:59,741 --> 01:56:01,243
by the mouth...

1396
01:56:01,994 --> 01:56:04,538
of our Savior, Christ Himself...

1397
01:56:05,414 --> 01:56:09,960
to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome
whilst He lived...

1398
01:56:10,669 --> 01:56:13,964
and was personally present...

1399
01:56:16,383 --> 01:56:18,010
here on earth.

1400
01:56:20,262 --> 01:56:24,099
It is therefore insufficient in law...

1401
01:56:24,725 --> 01:56:27,686
to charge any Christian to obey it.

1402
01:56:29,146 --> 01:56:30,631
And more than this...

1403
01:56:30,731 --> 01:56:35,568
the immunity of the Church is promised
both in Magna Carta...

1404
01:56:35,693 --> 01:56:39,280
and in the King's own coronation oath.

1405
01:56:41,115 --> 01:56:43,743
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!

1406
01:56:44,243 --> 01:56:45,494
Not so.

1407
01:56:47,914 --> 01:56:49,999
I am the King's true subject...

1408
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:54,503
and I pray for him and all the realm.

1409
01:56:56,297 --> 01:56:57,882
I do none harm.

1410
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:00,927
I say none harm.

1411
01:57:01,928 --> 01:57:04,222
I think none harm.

1412
01:57:06,307 --> 01:57:09,351
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive...

1413
01:57:09,768 --> 01:57:13,355
then in good faith, I long not to live.

1414
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:16,733
Nevertheless...

1415
01:57:17,692 --> 01:57:22,264
it is not for the supremacy
that you have sought my blood...

1416
01:57:22,364 --> 01:57:26,576
but because I would not bend
to the marriage!

1417
01:57:35,001 --> 01:57:38,129
You have been found guilty
of high treason.

1418
01:57:38,964 --> 01:57:42,007
The sentence of the court
is that you be taken...

1419
01:57:42,132 --> 01:57:44,051
to the Tower of London...

1420
01:57:46,178 --> 01:57:49,515
until the day hence
to the appointment...

1421
01:57:50,516 --> 01:57:52,601
for your execution!

1422
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:11,453
I am commanded
by the King to be brief...

1423
01:58:12,204 --> 01:58:15,124
and since I am
the King's obedient subject...

1424
01:58:15,665 --> 01:58:17,208
brief I will be.

1425
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:21,963
I die His Majesty's good servant...

1426
01:58:22,964 --> 01:58:24,549
but God's first.

1427
01:58:31,389 --> 01:58:33,683
I forgive you, right readily.

1428
01:58:39,731 --> 01:58:42,025
Be not afraid of your office.

1429
01:58:42,442 --> 01:58:44,152
You send me to God.

1430
01:58:46,613 --> 01:58:48,556
You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?

1431
01:58:48,656 --> 01:58:51,992
He will not refuse one who is so blithe
to go to him.

1432
01:59:14,765 --> 01:59:18,210
Thomas More's head was stuck
on Traitor's Gate for a month.

1433
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:22,189
Then his daughter, Margaret,
removed it and kept it 'til her death.

1434
01:59:22,981 --> 01:59:26,901
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason
five years after More.

1435
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:30,071
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.

1436
01:59:30,696 --> 01:59:33,850
The Duke of Norfolk should have
been executed for high treason...

1437
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:36,953
but the King died of syphilis
the night before.

1438
01:59:37,912 --> 01:59:40,831
Richard Rich became
Chancellor of England...

1439
01:59:41,457 --> 01:59:43,292
and died in his bed.
