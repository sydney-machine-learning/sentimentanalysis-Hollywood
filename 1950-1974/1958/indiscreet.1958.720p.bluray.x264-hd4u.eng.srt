1
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:14,987
Would you put the bags
here, please?

2
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:20,614
Give me a hand
with this, will you?

3
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,754
Will there be
anything else?

4
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,142
No, thank you,
William.

5
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:29,882
Right you are. And
welcome back, Miss Kalman.

6
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,882
Thank you.
I'm glad to be back.

7
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:32,961
Will you be all right?

8
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,935
You know it's Doris
and Carl's day off.

9
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,327
Yes, certainly.
I'll be all right.

10
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:38,808
Very good, miss.

11
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:53,820
- Hello, Doris. Hello, Carl. - Hello
- Nice entrance.

12
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:55,253
I thought
it was your day off.

13
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,175
We thought
you were a burglar.

14
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,431
Lucky for you
that I'm not.

15
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:59,261
We heard a noise.

16
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,158
We didn't get a cable
you were coming back today.

17
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,392
That's why
we didn't meet you.

18
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:03,748
I didn't decide to come
until this morning.

19
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,366
Something the matter?

20
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:07,149
No.

21
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,210
Have a nice trip?

22
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,304
Mm-Hmm. All right.

23
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:13,439
Oh, that's
no meal for you.

24
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,708
I'll get you
something hot.

25
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,106
No, that's all I want.

26
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,056
Go on about your business.

27
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,812
We don't have
any business.

28
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:19,839
We were only going
to have tea

29
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,289
And then go
to the movies.

30
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,069
Well, then go.

31
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,202
I've got
some nice lamb chops

32
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,251
And some
little French peas.

33
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,316
Go to the movies.
No, no, Doris, tomorrow.

34
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,500
How would you like me to
give you a nice massage?

35
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,813
Tomorrow.

36
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:35,870
I'll get you
some hot milk.

37
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,726
No, no, no.

38
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:38,968
N- O, no. G-O, go.

39
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:40,711
I'm staying here.

40
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:42,713
Ring if you want
something.

41
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,252
Oh! I didn't expect
to see anybody.

42
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,607
I'm not back from the grave, you know?

43
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,739
Good evening,
Mrs. Munson.

44
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,255
What are you doing here?
Good evening, Doris.

45
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,877
Why aren't you
in Majorca?

46
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,136
Because I'm here.
How's Alfred?

47
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:03,237
Alfred is fine.
I can see you're here,

48
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,119
But you should be
in Majorca.

49
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:06,898
Mr. Munson and I
are changing here.

50
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,834
Just put out our evening
clothes, will you, Doris?

51
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,167
Yes, madam.

52
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,026
And then go.

53
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:14,127
Very well.

54
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,340
Aren't you and Doris
getting on?

55
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,002
We get on fine.

56
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:22,359
Now, what's wrong with you?

57
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,651
You planned to be away
for the whole winter,

58
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:25,829
And here you are,
back again after 10 days.

59
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,060
I didn't find it
interesting.

60
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,609
Is it possible that the
trouble isn't with Majorca?

61
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,539
Possible.

62
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,396
What happened
to the colonel

63
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:35,934
That you wrote to me
about in your letter?

64
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,707
The one who looked
like a Greek statue.

65
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,787
He talked like
a Greek statue.

66
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:41,762
I don't think he knew
more than a dozen words.

67
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:43,652
Scotch and soda
and one or two more.

68
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:45,754
You were impressed with
him when you first met him.

69
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,054
I hadn't heard
the dozen words.

70
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:49,744
I don't know what you expect from a man.

71
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,302
You know there's a limit to
how entertaining they can be.

72
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:55,094
Well, they should be able to
talk a little, simple sentences.

73
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,032
You told me that
he was good-Looking

74
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,856
And that he danced
beautifully.

75
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:00,938
That's all a woman's
entitled to.

76
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:03,238
You can always
read a good book.

77
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:04,882
Dear little sister,

78
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,543
Go wash your mind
with soap.

79
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:08,677
I'm not your little
sister. I'm the older.

80
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,324
This is a side of you
I've never seen before.

81
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,973
Sort of maternal
white slaver.

82
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,554
I'm not sympathetic.

83
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,302
You've plenty of beaus.

84
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,693
You're beautiful,
talented, and famous.

85
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,243
You're an actress

86
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,520
Who's the envy of
everyone who knows you.

87
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:28,114
But then they don't know me.

88
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,925
What about
David Wilson?

89
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,405
Why don't you
marry him?

90
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:34,195
I don't love him.

91
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,381
Why not?

92
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:36,586
I don't know why not.

93
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:39,379
I tried to love him.
I just don't.

94
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:41,297
Someone will turn up.

95
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,790
When?

96
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,732
Do a play.

97
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,772
You know you're much
happier when you're working.

98
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:49,252
I don't feel like it.

99
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,399
Come along with us.

100
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,238
Come on. You'll feel
much better in a girdle.

101
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,119
Where are you going?

102
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,620
To a banquet.

103
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:56,731
Oh.

104
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:58,769
Sometimes the speaker
is very interesting.

105
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,296
I remember
the last one.

106
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,807
The Dutch ambassador spoke
for an hour and 15 minutes...

107
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:03,912
in Dutch.

108
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,623
Well, we'll go on
somewhere afterwards.

109
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,301
Oh, why, lord?

110
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:09,828
Anna!

111
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,765
Well,
what a surprise.

112
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,427
Hello, Alfred.

113
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,674
Mmm. Delicious cold
cream. You get that brand.

114
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,255
You're looking bloomy.

115
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:19,920
So are you. How is
the foreign office?

116
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,530
Muddling through.

117
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,139
Well, dear, how's everything at home?

118
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:23,811
Fine.

119
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,370
Come along. I'll help you get dressed.

120
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,414
You're feeling sorry
for yourself.

121
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:27,716
I am not.
I feel sorry for you.

122
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,150
She's coming
with us.

123
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,347
Oh, she's not.

124
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,646
Well, you're
more than welcome.

125
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,066
The Dutch ambassador,
I think of him often.

126
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,354
I told you, he's not going
to be there this time. Is he?

127
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:37,905
Oh, no, no. That was
an official state dinner.

128
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,334
This one's going to
be quite interesting.

129
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,760
Ah. You see?

130
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,524
Who is it for?

131
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:43,357
Well, it's for
the hard-Currency countries.

132
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,688
There will be a number
of speakers who will, uh..

133
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:47,564
Well, speak.

134
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,713
On hard currency?

135
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:50,887
Yes.

136
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,531
The Dutch ambassador's
growing on me.

137
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:53,774
It's not that bad
as it sounds.

138
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,959
I go no place where
they don't speak Dutch.

139
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,650
Alfred, it might be better
if I stayed behind with Anna.

140
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,644
She's acting so gay
I know she's depressed.

141
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,184
She's not.

142
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,384
The door was open.

143
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,123
Hello, Philip.

144
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,143
Darling, I want you to
meet Mr. Philip Adams.

145
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,418
This is my wife.

146
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:19,859
How do you do?

147
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:24,120
And my sister-In-Law
Miss Anna Kalman.

148
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,645
How do you do?

149
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:33,031
Miss Kalman
is no stranger to me.

150
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,231
I've seen you often
on the stage.

151
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,757
I'm a fervent admirer.

152
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:38,614
Why, thank you, kind sir.

153
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,008
I once stayed over
an extra day in Liverpool

154
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,030
Because you were billed
to appear,

155
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,842
And then the performance
was canceled.

156
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,282
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:50,078
It turned out to be a fortunate
delay. I made some money out of it.

158
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,191
I'm glad.

159
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,201
I would've gladly traded the
money for the performance.

160
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,248
Would you care to see
the performance now?

161
00:08:58,523 --> 00:08:59,550
I'll play all the parts.

162
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,376
How much money was it?

163
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,499
I asked Philip to come up
here and change his clothes.

164
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:10,060
He's in from Paris...
just for the dinner.

165
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:11,559
I had no idea
you'd be back.

166
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,907
Oh, that's perfectly
all right.

167
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,766
I could go to a hotel.

168
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,143
Oh. You're
more than welcome.

169
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,070
Well, it's rather
an imposition.

170
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,792
Well, I owe you something
for Liverpool.

171
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,077
And where is Mrs. Adams
going to dress?

172
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,019
There is no Mrs. Adams.

173
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,683
Oh. Well...

174
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,234
now, do we have to go
to this silly old dinner?

175
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,432
The speaker will bore us,
and they won't miss us.

176
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:39,338
They'd miss him.
He's the speaker.

177
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:42,492
This happens to me all the time.

178
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,520
I once asked a butler
at the French embassy

179
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,725
If he cared
to waltz.

180
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,372
He waltzed
divinely.

181
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:50,109
You're right about the speech
being dull. I've heard it.

182
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,009
Well, we can go on to some
other place afterwards.

183
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,063
It's the only hope
for the evening.

184
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:55,583
What do you say, Anna?

185
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,223
Oh, I couldn't go.

186
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,249
Why not?

187
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,959
Well, for one thing,
I'm not dressed.

188
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,921
Well, neither are they. We'll race them.

189
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:03,456
I couldn't possibly
be on time.

190
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:04,914
It doesn't matter
if we are late.

191
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,641
We've got the man
with the speech.

192
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,028
They can't start
without him.

193
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:11,854
Oh, she needs coaxing.
You coax her.

194
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm an extra man. You'd make
the dinner come out even.

195
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,798
How many people are
going to be there?

196
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:20,463
600.

197
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,006
Yes.

198
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:24,889
599 people in a room
does look untidy.

199
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:28,326
You see? That's all I wanted
- An intelligent reason.

200
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:29,958
You change in there.

201
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,998
Last one dressed
is last.

202
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,111
Can I help you?

203
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:38,874
Whitehall 0-0-1-1.

204
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,431
Who in heaven's name
is that?

205
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,851
Stop breathing
so hard.

206
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,978
Oh, I didn't know
it showed.

207
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:51,364
Who is he? What is he? And speak slowly.

208
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,043
He's a very bright
gentleman

209
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,840
We are hoping will accept a job in NATO,

210
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,572
And we're not
having much luck.

211
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,831
Hello, Harris?
This is Mr. Munson.

212
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:00,732
One more
for our table.

213
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,685
Yes, a place card
for Miss Anna Kalman.

214
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,900
Uh, next to
Mr. Philip Adams.

215
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,933
Fine.

216
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,867
Well, what about
this Mr. Adams?

217
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,351
What do you want
to know?

218
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,484
Everything.
And I mean everything.

219
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,595
Well, I don't think he's
romantically attached,

220
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,154
Which is
what you're hinting.

221
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:20,991
I'm not hinting,
I'm asking.

222
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,654
How do you know
he's not attached?

223
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:24,853
Well, we've had dinner
together. He's been alone.

224
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:28,610
So were you. Presumably.
That proves nothing.

225
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:29,919
That's right.

226
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,144
Well, I don't know what
he does after he leaves me.

227
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,704
I'll follow him
next time.

228
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:36,634
Of course
he hasn't any money.

229
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,907
You'll notice we're giving
this dinner about money.

230
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,401
He's the speaker. He must
have some connection with it.

231
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,680
There must be something
the matter with his health.

232
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:47,414
Hardly. He beat the squash
champion at my club last weekend.

233
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,481
You've got to be
pretty healthy to do that.

234
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:51,666
There must be a catch in it somewhere.

235
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,285
He couldn't have
escaped this long.

236
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,252
Well, we're anxious
to get him into NATO.

237
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:58,573
There aren't many like him
available as public servants.

238
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:01,497
I'm not interested
in the public.

239
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:05,162
So you see...
we find ourselves,

240
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,190
I think
I'm permitted to say,

241
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,771
In a small dilemma.

242
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:10,104
We have spiraling inflation
on one hand

243
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:12,235
And contracting credit
on the other.

244
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:14,428
But even that
is no real cause for alarm

245
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:17,209
Since we are actually
the purchasing agent

246
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,143
And consumer
at the same time.

247
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:20,985
I therefore suggest

248
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,990
That we let the ratio
of block currency

249
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:24,618
Equal the long-Term
commitments

250
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,143
Of the participating
NATO countries.

251
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,288
He's as bad as the Dutch ambassador.

252
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:31,969
I can't understand one word.

253
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:33,921
The tariff considerations
would no longer be affected

254
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:34,921
By internal
evaluations nor-

255
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,619
And I can't emphasize
this too strongly-

256
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,080
Would any single currency

257
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:43,087
Be obliged to look
to another

258
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,809
For its health
and stability.

259
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,022
I submit this is only fair.

260
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:12,731
Good evening, miss
Kalman. Glad to see back.

261
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,431
Good evening, Oscar.
Nice to be back.

262
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,060
My, it's later
than I thought.

263
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,396
But you have time
for a drink.

264
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,411
Certainly we have.
It's early.

265
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,626
I'm afraid we haven't
time for that drink.

266
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,955
I have an early
appointment tomorrow,

267
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:35,115
And Philip here is meeting
half the French cabinet

268
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,460
At 10:00
in the morning.

269
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,017
He's sleeping
on the bullet train.

270
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:45,915
Thank you. I'll drop you at the station.

271
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,024
It must be
out of your way.

272
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,390
I can take a cab.

273
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,282
It's only a few minutes.
No trouble at all.

274
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:04,632
We'll get our bags
and run along.

275
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:05,831
Do you want
to change here?

276
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,637
No, no. I can change
on the train. Thanks.

277
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,681
Oh, isn't that awful.

278
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:14,284
What's awful?

279
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:16,907
Stop playing games.

280
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,603
Don't tell me
you don't like this one.

281
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,535
Why, he talks
and everything.

282
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:21,056
Mm-Hmm.

283
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,944
He's all right.
He's interesting.

284
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:24,527
Interesting?

285
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,617
All these years married
and never once,

286
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,672
And now I have
a confession to make.

287
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:31,168
At dinner,

288
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,769
I thought he was pressing
his knee against mine.

289
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,278
It turned out to be a table
leg. I was disappointed.

290
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,055
You're
a big talker.

291
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:40,839
Anna, we're off.

292
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:43,182
Good night,
Mr. Adams.

293
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,565
I had a nice evening.

294
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,550
So did I. I've never had a better time.

295
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,113
And I enjoyed your speech
very much.

296
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,579
I'm crazy
about hard currency.

297
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:50,525
I'm afraid
you're going to

298
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,915
Have to wait an hour at the station.

299
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:53,310
Just about.

300
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,585
What's that? You're not
going to sit in the station

301
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,003
For a whole hour.

302
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:00,041
I don't mind. I have
some papers I can go over.

303
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,618
Oh, that's ridiculous.

304
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,955
Well, wouldn't
it be all right

305
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:06,074
If you left
the door open?

306
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,383
Yes, we could do that,

307
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,437
And you can go over
your papers right here.

308
00:15:10,437 --> 00:15:11,901
I would be
keeping you up.

309
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,373
I'm not a bit sleepy.

310
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:14,835
Alfred,
it's getting late.

311
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:16,578
Yes, well, I'm not going
to press you any further.

312
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,668
You know how badly we
want you to take the post.

313
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:22,021
Whatever you decide, the
secretary wants me to thank you

314
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,928
For the job
you've done already.

315
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,734
Oh, please don't. I'm flattered.
I'm honored to be asked.

316
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,749
Good night, Mr. Adams.
Anna, darling.

317
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,381
Good night,
Mrs. Munson.

318
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,788
Good night.

319
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,491
Alfred.

320
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:33,856
Good night, Anna.

321
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,045
They seem to
have forgotten.

322
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,865
Would you like to
take your coat off?

323
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:49,446
Like a drink?

324
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,611
Uh, yes,
a short one.

325
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,141
I seldom drink
after dinner.

326
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:55,688
What?

327
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,219
Uh...

328
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,578
scotch and soda,
please.

329
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,551
Are you going
to have one?

330
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,671
No, I don't think so,
but you have one.

331
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,124
I like a man with a glass in his hand.

332
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,100
It's becoming.

333
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,600
Oh, in that case,
I'll gladly hold it.

334
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,170
You have to sip it
once in a while, too.

335
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,490
That's part
of the picture.

336
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,335
I'm quite impressed
the foreign secretary's

337
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,878
Asked you to take a post you don't want.

338
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,485
Is it something
you can talk about?

339
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:21,888
Oh, it's not
that important, really.

340
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,328
I just finished a 30-Day job with NATO,

341
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:26,242
And they've asked me
to stay on.

342
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,794
I know
it's a public service,

343
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:29,894
And my conscience
bothers me a little,

344
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:32,866
But there's an exciting new
project in Mexico that attracts me.

345
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,446
Frankly, I'd prefer that
to being tied down

346
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,192
To a desk job
in Paris right now.

347
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:38,747
Have you ever
been in Mexico?

348
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:40,136
No, I haven't.

349
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,261
It isn't too bad once
you get used to the water.

350
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:44,604
So I hear.

351
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,601
Couldn't you try
the NATO job...

352
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:49,488
just for a while
to see if you like it?

353
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,619
Once I took it,
I'd be obligated to stay.

354
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,622
That's policy.
You can understand that.

355
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:54,771
I see.

356
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,391
Any advice?

357
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:02,276
Well, if you go to Mexico,
drink bottled water.

358
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:03,406
I'll do that.

359
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:04,915
I understand
where people slip up

360
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,661
Is in brushing
their teeth.

361
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:07,848
Bottled water
there, too.

362
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:09,265
Really?

363
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,828
That seems such
a lot of trouble.

364
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,102
Yes, it does.

365
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,692
Take the job with NATO.

366
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:15,815
Brush your teeth
with anything.

367
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:17,753
That might decide me.

368
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,651
Have you ever
lived in Paris

369
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:20,932
For any
length of time?

370
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:21,761
No, I haven't.

371
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:23,867
There's an interesting
social life

372
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:24,938
Once you adjust
yourself to it.

373
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,632
You, being single,
would be in great demand.

374
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,320
There's quite
a shortage.

375
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:32,155
Then, of course, you could
spend your weekends in London.

376
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,419
I've never really
enjoyed myself in London.

377
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:36,914
How dare you, sir?

378
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:38,512
London is
my adopted home.

379
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,016
I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

380
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,059
I'm sure
it's all my fault.

381
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:43,221
May I inquire
where you are from?

382
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,263
San Francisco.

383
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,472
It's delightful, but it's
so far from everything.

384
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,391
That depends upon
what is everything.

385
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,970
Well, I mean,
our theater,

386
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,208
Our opera,

387
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,542
Our museums.

388
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,943
When were you
in a museum last?

389
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,340
I go daily.

390
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:00,884
Oh, well,
in that case.

391
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:05,752
We're not as isolated in
San Francisco as you think.

392
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,266
The stagecoach makes
it fairly regularly now.

393
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:10,889
We get
the New York shows.

394
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:12,636
Not the same year,
but eventually.

395
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,207
We have opera.

396
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:15,643
Not much,
but enough.

397
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,375
I take it you're not an opera lover.

398
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,969
No, no, no. Really,
it escapes me.

399
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,298
On the other hand, we
have a whole ballet season.

400
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,664
That does not escape me.

401
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:24,771
You like the ballet?

402
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,624
Oh, I do, indeed.
Very much.

403
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,880
Would you like to go
Saturday night?

404
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,248
I have regular seats.

405
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,144
I'm a married man,
miss Kalman.

406
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:48,934
I'm sorry.
I'm awfully sorry.

407
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:50,801
Oh, it's perfectly
all right.

408
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,924
You see, when I first
came in this evening,

409
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,193
I said there was
no Mrs. Adams.

410
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:56,912
I meant there was no Mrs.
Adams with me in Europe.

411
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:58,508
There's no Mrs. Adams
dressing.

412
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,186
It's been on my conscience all evening.

413
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:01,992
Yes, I must say,

414
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:03,712
You've been palming
yourself off as a single man.

415
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,524
I must've sounded
quite idiotic

416
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:07,744
Blurting it out
like that.

417
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:08,796
Oh, no, not at all.

418
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:09,998
It was very proper
and pertinent.

419
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,751
Rather vain, too.

420
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:14,450
Vain?

421
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,748
Why?

422
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:17,067
Well,
the implication was

423
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,566
That you wouldn't be able
to keep your hands off me.

424
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:20,916
That sounds
pretty silly, too.

425
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,451
Well,
you'll never know now.

426
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,391
That's right.

427
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,170
Well,
if you felt that,

428
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,620
Why did you
have to warn me?

429
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,755
Because
those are the rules

430
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:31,999
Between grown-Up
men and women,

431
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,082
Or should be.

432
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:35,836
Trouble is, the game is
so one-Sided for a man.

433
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:38,265
Yes...

434
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,075
I think it is, too.

435
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,234
Well,
you're a rarity.

436
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:44,994
I don't believe I am.

437
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:46,411
You are.
Oh, you are.

438
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,652
I speak from
vast experience.

439
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:51,542
Men usually don't mention
at all that they're married.

440
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,621
Or if it's
something you know,

441
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,466
Then they tell you that
they are misunderstood

442
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,648
Or separated

443
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,103
And can't possibly
get a divorce.

444
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,404
The last one is the
most popular this year.

445
00:19:58,404 --> 00:19:59,803
Really?

446
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:03,672
Well, I'm afraid this changes
my status here morally.

447
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,817
Well, you're not
compromising me,

448
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,294
If that's what's
bothering you.

449
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,815
You'd have to
spend the night.

450
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:11,803
The law
is quite clear on that.

451
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:13,978
Ipso facto
if you spend the night.

452
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,967
I was in a play once
that had that in it.

453
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:18,711
It doesn't seem fair
to the woman.

454
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:19,958
I hope
there are loopholes.

455
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,099
You have a well-Developed
sense of chivalry.

456
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:25,798
I mean it
as a compliment.

457
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:27,508
I'll take it
as a compliment.

458
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,483
I've had a...

459
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,148
very enjoyable time.

460
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,440
So had I.

461
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,637
You know,
I must tell you this.

462
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,629
I've been sorely tempted
to break the rules,

463
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,457
And I've been
debating it all evening.

464
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:53,231
Evidently your honor is
stronger than my beauty.

465
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:57,840
You see, I am separated
from my wife,

466
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,517
And I can't possibly
get a divorce.

467
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:03,008
That's the same line all the
others are pulling this year.

468
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,481
Well, how the devil could I say it

469
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,424
Without saying it?

470
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:14,706
You know, I can't help the fact
they're all using it so much.

471
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,094
There's no copyright
on it.

472
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:18,568
Well, I know.

473
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:21,412
So good night.

474
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:29,324
And thank you again.

475
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,962
The desk, please.

476
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,200
Hello, Oscar.
This is miss Kalman.

477
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,381
Has the gentleman
who left my apartment

478
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:08,450
Come out of
the elevator yet?

479
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:10,846
No, ma'am.

480
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,367
The elevator's just
on the way down.

481
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:13,835
Let me speak to him,
please.

482
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:19,162
Uh, excuse me, sir.

483
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,014
Miss Kalman would like to speak to you.

484
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:23,979
Thank you.

485
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,131
Hello?

486
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:31,629
Good seats to the ballet
are hard to get.

487
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,661
Will you come?

488
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,740
I'd like nothing better.

489
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:42,145
6:00 then.

490
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,692
Good night.

491
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:45,567
I'll take
the afternoon plane.

492
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,099
Good night.

493
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:47,486
Ooh, it's 6:00.

494
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:49,309
Dear, you've had
enough coffee.

495
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:49,915
Come on.

496
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,199
Drive carefully.

497
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:51,868
Yes.

498
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:53,338
Wipe your glasses
and hurry up.

499
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:54,771
Yes.

500
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:06,566
Good evening.

501
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,017
Hello.

502
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:25,553
You're very prompt.

503
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,371
Oh, am I?

504
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,531
Yes, you are.

505
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,273
I used to work
in a bank.

506
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:31,561
Some of it hung on.

507
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:33,831
Oh, thank you for
the beautiful roses,

508
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,438
But you sent
far too many.

509
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,134
Uh, I like yellow roses.

510
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,004
You're quite welcome.

511
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:41,332
Uh, well,
shall we go?

512
00:24:46,104 --> 00:24:46,593
Oh...

513
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,223
it was rather muggy
in Paris today.

514
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,217
It was muggy here, too.

515
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,050
Really?

516
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,317
Yes.

517
00:24:57,948 --> 00:24:59,536
I made
dinner reservations

518
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:00,654
At both the Mirabelle
and the white tower.

519
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:01,965
You have your choice.

520
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:04,320
Uh...

521
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:06,260
they don't suit you?

522
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,207
Yes, they do.

523
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:09,045
Ooh, they're very
nice restaurants.

524
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:11,179
It never
occurred to me

525
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:12,467
That you would make
reservations from Paris.

526
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:14,480
I arranged
something.

527
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,189
You did? Well, fine.

528
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,485
I hope you approve.

529
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:18,469
I'm sure I will.

530
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,947
A friend is taking us
to the players club.

531
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:22,878
Oh, I see.

532
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,799
It's quite a treat.

533
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,436
I thought it was
something unusual for you.

534
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,157
And since I'm
not a member,

535
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:28,878
I coaxed a friend
to invite us.

536
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,291
Thank you.

537
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:32,784
That's very
thoughtful of you.

538
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,174
It's unusual for the
weather to be so muggy

539
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:45,411
This time of year.

540
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:47,463
Yes, uh...

541
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:48,856
I read an article
the other day

542
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,448
That claimed the world's
weather was changing.

543
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:51,684
Oh, really?

544
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:53,770
That's interesting.

545
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:55,617
Yes, isn't it?

546
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:05,716
Evening,
Miss Kalman.

547
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:06,401
Good evening.

548
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:14,389
Here she comes!

549
00:26:15,347 --> 00:26:15,984
Miss Kalman, please.

550
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,457
Can I have
your autograph?

551
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:18,525
Just one moment,
miss Kalman.

552
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,589
Oh, miss Kalman.

553
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:20,547
Miss Kalman, please.

554
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:35,063
Miss Kalman.

555
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,466
Excuse me.

556
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:40,824
Oh, miss Kalman,

557
00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:42,119
Please,
for my daughter.

558
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,658
She lives
in Australia.

559
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,443
Would you write,

560
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:46,863
"To Kitty Kins"?

561
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:48,739
That's her name.

562
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:50,575
Well, it's her nickname, really.

563
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,591
Her name
is Catherine,

564
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,099
But we all call
her Kitty Kins.

565
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:54,198
She'll be just
thrilled to get it.

566
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:57,954
Oh, I am so sorry.

567
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:00,303
The pen leaks.
It's my husband's.

568
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:01,590
Oh, I am sorry.

569
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:11,793
Good evening,
Miss Kalman.

570
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:12,652
Good evening, Albert.

571
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:13,618
I have a message
for you.

572
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:15,292
Mr. Whitehead phoned
and asked to be excused.

573
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:19,235
His aunt is ill. Would you dine
without him and please forgive him?

574
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:20,528
Of course.
Poor man.

575
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:21,776
This way,
please.

576
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:33,506
Thank you.

577
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,683
Shall we have
something to drink?

578
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:37,148
Yes, please.
A scotch and soda.

579
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:38,314
The same.

580
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:41,429
Oh, Albert,
the ballet tonight.

581
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:42,337
Please get us out
in time.

582
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,099
It shall be
our responsibility.

583
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,412
I hope Mr. Whitehead's
aunt is all right.

584
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,231
He has no aunt.

585
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,658
Oh, a fabrication to get
around the house committee.

586
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,468
Do you think you're
putting it over on Albert?

587
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,355
No one ever puts
anything over on Albert.

588
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:56,789
I didn't think so.

589
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,673
Well, to the Alberts of this world

590
00:28:00,673 --> 00:28:01,921
Who have shown tolerance.

591
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:03,085
Bless them.

592
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:04,335
Amen.

593
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,581
It's 7:25.

594
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:18,726
Why haven't you got
Miss Kalman out?

595
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,666
She's late.

596
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,540
I tried attracting their
attention half a dozen times.

597
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:22,814
They waved me away.

598
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:24,886
I was 12 years old,

599
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:25,988
And my father
took me to see

600
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:27,035
A performance
of Camille.

601
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,346
Well, that was the
experience of my life.

602
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,550
That poor
frail woman,

603
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:32,916
Dying of
tuberculosis,

604
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,783
Coughing into
her handkerchief,

605
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:37,543
Sending
her lover away.

606
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,719
Oh, I cried so loud,

607
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,745
You could hardly
hear the actors.

608
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:42,579
Well, the next day,

609
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,604
I convinced
the students

610
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,131
That we should give
Camille as our school play

611
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,423
With me playing Camille, of course.

612
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:48,722
Well, a 12-Year-Old
Camille,

613
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:49,952
And rather...

614
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:54,081
my mother believed in
four big meals a day

615
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,753
For growing children.

616
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:58,214
It wasn't exactly what Dumas had
in mind when he wrote the play.

617
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:00,762
Frankly, Henry VIII
would've suited me better.

618
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:01,947
Nothing else, Albert.
Thank you.

619
00:29:01,947 --> 00:29:03,970
Excuse me,
but the ballet.

620
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,189
It's already 7:30.

621
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:06,785
7:30 now?

622
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,349
Oh, Albert, you should have told us.

623
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:09,946
Now we're going
to be late.

624
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,673
Good night.

625
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:12,883
It's all right.

626
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:14,019
It's on Mr. Whitehead.

627
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:15,140
Good night.

628
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:28,880
Thank you.

629
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,782
There can be
no one seated

630
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,198
Until the termination
of the first scene.

631
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:37,683
Oh.

632
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:40,270
Isn't she wonderful?
She looks beautiful.

633
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,502
She's a wonderful
actress.

634
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:45,273
Excuse me. Is there
any standing room left?

635
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:46,523
All gone.
I'm sorry.

636
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,518
Why don't you
try the gallery?

637
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,282
We did.

638
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:49,391
Just two,
perhaps.

639
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:52,003
All standing room's sold the
fire department allows. I'm sorry.

640
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:53,740
Ohh.

641
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:57,038
I know how Romeo and Juliet comes out.

642
00:29:57,813 --> 00:29:58,643
It's sad.

643
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:13,930
Do you think
Mr. Whitehead can afford

644
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,465
This second
cup of coffee?

645
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,235
Thank you, Albert.

646
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,038
Were you always interested in finance?

647
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:21,558
No, no.

648
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:22,529
You see,
as a young man,

649
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,294
I didn't display any
banking tendencies at all.

650
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:27,122
As a matter of fact, my
allowance was always overdrawn,

651
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,278
Which is a very bad sign for a banker.

652
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,964
Believe it or not,
my first love was music.

653
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,475
I always wanted
to be a violinist.

654
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,122
Did you really?

655
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:38,237
Oh, yes.
And I worked at it.

656
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,211
And when I was
13 years old,

657
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,001
My professor thought I
was ready to give a concert

658
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:43,604
In our music academy.

659
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,660
Well, all my relatives
came to cheer...

660
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,784
and all the relatives of the
other students not to cheer,

661
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,965
And I was announced
from the stage.

662
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,949
Wild applause
from my relations.

663
00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:55,086
I walked on
in my new blue suit,

664
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,103
Put the violin
to my chin,

665
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,336
And the audience
began to laugh.

666
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:01,683
Oh, small titters
at first, but it grew.

667
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,464
But they laughed
before you played?

668
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:04,582
Before.

669
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:05,765
But why?

670
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,286
Well, I'm left-Handed.

671
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,845
It seems that left-Handed
violinists make people laugh.

672
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,326
Miss Kalman, we've been following you.

673
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:37,538
We weren't sure
it was you.

674
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,137
May we have your autograph, please?

675
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:51,430
Did you ever try to play
the violin right-Handed?

676
00:32:52,815 --> 00:32:53,845
Yes, yes, I tried,

677
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,544
But I found myself
moving the violin

678
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:56,858
Instead of the bow.

679
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,609
Shall I see you
to your elevator?

680
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:52,502
Yes.

681
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:13,314
Good night.

682
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,195
Would you like to come in for a drink?

683
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:18,476
Yes, I would.

684
00:35:45,822 --> 00:35:46,375
Hello?

685
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,187
Regent 8-9-4-7, please.

686
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:58,299
Hello?

687
00:36:01,235 --> 00:36:01,867
Good morning.

688
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:06,464
Good morning.

689
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:08,302
How did you sleep?

690
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:10,697
Fine.

691
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,423
And you?

692
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:13,549
Fine.

693
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:16,950
What are you doing?

694
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,221
I'm considering
getting up.

695
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,365
I'm going to take a shower and shave

696
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:24,597
And take you
to a lavish lunch.

697
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:27,977
Why don't you
come up here instead?

698
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:29,813
My talent is cooking.

699
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:32,096
I'll do that.

700
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:51,194
Come in.

701
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:52,427
The door is open.

702
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:00,547
I'm in the kitchen.

703
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:03,115
Servants' day off.

704
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:17,698
Look out.

705
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:19,074
The chef is very
temperamental.

706
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,565
Sit down.

707
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:22,489
Drink your juice.

708
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:38,508
Eat while it's hot.

709
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:41,264
I'll wait.

710
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:42,629
Start.

711
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:44,530
Good manners
spoil good food.

712
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,540
I've decided to take
the NATO job in Paris.

713
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,136
I'm glad.

714
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:03,371
Oh...

715
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,605
hello?

716
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:48,458
Hi.

717
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:49,784
10 seconds late.

718
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:51,878
Last night
it was seven,

719
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:52,989
The night
before, five.

720
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,192
I can see the handwriting on the wall.

721
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,579
You're cooling.

722
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:57,811
Hardly.

723
00:39:58,168 --> 00:39:59,132
How was your day?

724
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:00,157
Fine.

725
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:01,253
How was yours?

726
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,151
Fine.

727
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:03,789
Anything new?

728
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:05,286
No, no.
Nothing special.

729
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,374
Oh, yes.

730
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:08,545
Huh?

731
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:09,402
There was
a little something.

732
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:10,911
Yes?
What was it?

733
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:12,735
You're ready
to be impressed?

734
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:13,876
Ooh, fire away.

735
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:16,241
Well,
I just had dinner

736
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,540
With the president
of France.

737
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:19,044
No.

738
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,001
Yes.

739
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,091
What did you
have to eat?

740
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,773
Lamb chops.

741
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:26,246
Oh, no.

742
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:27,364
Why?
What did you expect?

743
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:28,787
Something
more pretentious,

744
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,231
Befitting
the occasion.

745
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,763
It wasn't
an occasion for him.

746
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:32,935
He eats every night.

747
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:35,011
Well, how did you
come to be invited?

748
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,573
The ambassador took me.

749
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:38,040
It's customary
for a new man.

750
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,060
Now, tell me everything that happened.

751
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:44,176
Small talk, really.

752
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:46,809
Well, you must have
discussed something.

753
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:49,508
Well, let me think.

754
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:50,893
Oh, yes.

755
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,327
Is it worthwhile putting
saccharine in coffee

756
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:54,661
Instead of sugar?

757
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:55,899
That took up
most of the evening.

758
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:57,018
The president
said it wasn't.

759
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:58,101
Well, he's wrong.

760
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,113
The finance minister
said he was wrong, too.

761
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,817
Of course it wasn't
an out-And-Out quarrel,

762
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:04,500
But it was a strong
difference of opinion.

763
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:06,306
That's off the record.

764
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:07,795
Off the record?

765
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:08,963
That's right.

766
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:10,515
Oh, you fit fine
in diplomacy.

767
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:12,243
Don't I?

768
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,472
Something else
happen?

769
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,163
No, nothing w-

770
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,131
Oh, yes.
Now, wait a minute.

771
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,521
Come to think of it,

772
00:41:20,798 --> 00:41:21,904
Someone mentioned
your name.

773
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:23,628
Oh, really?
Who did?

774
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:24,987
Who was that?

775
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:26,415
Oh, yes.
It was the president.

776
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:29,886
It seems he's seen you
often on the stage,

777
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:30,977
And, uh...

778
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:32,154
he thinks
you're charming.

779
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:33,371
That was
his exact word.

780
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,588
Charming isn't
a very strong word.

781
00:41:36,588 --> 00:41:37,708
Not in the theater.

782
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:39,190
Well, the president
isn't in the theater.

783
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:41,082
Oh, that's right.

784
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:42,861
Now, on the other hand,

785
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:45,201
The ambassador thought
you extremely talented

786
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:46,782
And exciting.

787
00:41:47,209 --> 00:41:48,854
Well,
that's much better.

788
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,513
And I agreed
with both of them.

789
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:51,881
You see what a diplomat I am?

790
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:52,406
Mm-Hmm.

791
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:54,551
I...

792
00:41:56,966 --> 00:41:58,706
uh, I found
a play I like.

793
00:42:00,614 --> 00:42:01,950
I have decided
to do it.

794
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:07,179
I'm glad.

795
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:09,281
We are right
for each other.

796
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:12,915
We are good for each other, my darling.

797
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:14,837
We are, we are.

798
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:17,979
Sleep well,
my love.

799
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:23,259
Good night.

800
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:25,116
Good night,
dearest.

801
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:32,242
Now, come on.
Hang up.

802
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:33,383
Hang up.

803
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,426
Oh...

804
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:35,819
right.

805
00:42:38,004 --> 00:42:38,770
Good night.

806
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:40,064
Good night,
dearest.

807
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,195
What are you
in town for?

808
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:53,638
Just some errands.

809
00:42:54,803 --> 00:42:55,753
What are you doing
with yourself?

810
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:56,957
Rehearsing.

811
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:58,353
Is that all?

812
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:00,310
What more
would you expect?

813
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:02,394
I'm just curious to know what you did

814
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:03,736
With your day apart
from rehearsing.

815
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:06,702
Well,
if you're interested,

816
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:08,654
I get up in the morning,
and I brush my teeth,

817
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,714
And then I have breakfast,
and I read the morning paper.

818
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:13,963
What about
Mr. Philip Adams?

819
00:43:16,113 --> 00:43:16,998
What about him?

820
00:43:21,072 --> 00:43:22,753
Mr. Adams was here
last weekend,

821
00:43:23,658 --> 00:43:25,725
And he's taken a permanent
suite one floor below you.

822
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:27,567
How do you know?

823
00:43:28,454 --> 00:43:29,505
Alfred.

824
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,561
You mean, Philip told
Alfred he was here?

825
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:32,820
Not Philip.

826
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,927
Scotland yard.

827
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:35,826
Scotland yard?

828
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,142
Scotland yard doesn't
allow new members of NATO

829
00:43:38,373 --> 00:43:40,284
To wander around without
knowing where they go.

830
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:42,556
Oh, for heaven sakes.

831
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,815
Anything else
they know?

832
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:47,933
Everything else
they know.

833
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:49,889
You can take
my word for it.

834
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,604
Well, the country's
come to a fine state-

835
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:54,844
Peeping toms,

836
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:56,456
Spying.

837
00:43:56,764 --> 00:43:58,659
I didn't come here to show
you that I'd been snooping.

838
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:01,001
I've got something
unpleasant to tell you,

839
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:02,537
And I'm dreading it.

840
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,672
What is it?

841
00:44:05,172 --> 00:44:07,501
Mr. Philip Adams
is a married man.

842
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:10,049
I know.

843
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:11,575
How do you know?

844
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:12,618
He told me.

845
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,384
He told you?

846
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,022
Is he getting
a divorce?

847
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:17,754
He never can.

848
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:19,835
Well...

849
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:23,121
are you doing
the right thing?

850
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:25,125
I don't know.

851
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:26,478
I have no choice.

852
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:27,928
I did have in the
beginning, but not now.

853
00:44:28,693 --> 00:44:29,474
You love him?

854
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:30,994
Terribly.

855
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:32,733
Don't you hope
to marry him?

856
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,141
Yes.

857
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:36,335
It's never
out of my mind.

858
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,551
May I ask the purpose of your visit?

859
00:44:47,029 --> 00:44:47,822
Business
or pleasure?

860
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,550
Pleasure.

861
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:50,609
Holiday?

862
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:51,773
That's it.

863
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:54,892
Darling,
I'll miss you terribly.

864
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,051
I'll walk into
a crowded room,

865
00:44:57,516 --> 00:44:58,806
And someone will be
standing the way you stand.

866
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:02,974
He'll hold his head the
way you hold your head,

867
00:45:03,975 --> 00:45:05,636
The way you hold
your knife and fork.

868
00:45:06,284 --> 00:45:07,585
I don't hold my knife and
fork in any special way.

869
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:09,154
Yes, you do.

870
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,756
You hold your fork straight
up as a little boy does.

871
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:13,795
You do, Arthur.

872
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,051
Oh, hello,
Mr. Adams.

873
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:29,044
How are you
this week?

874
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,397
Fine, thank you.
How are you?

875
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:49,482
Ohh.

876
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:18,368
Now, here,

877
00:46:18,614 --> 00:46:18,946
Here.

878
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:26,109
Ah-Choo!

879
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:27,755
Bless you.

880
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:29,774
Oh, this is terrible.

881
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,016
Oh, my gosh.

882
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:34,829
All right.

883
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:40,024
What's the purpose
of your visit?

884
00:46:41,018 --> 00:46:41,186
Business or-

885
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,010
Hello, Mr. Adams.
How are you?

886
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:44,423
Hello, again.
How's everything?

887
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:45,568
Fine, thank you.

888
00:46:47,313 --> 00:46:48,415
Now you stay down here,

889
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:49,750
And I'll go up
and be charming.

890
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,200
And keep your fingers crossed.

891
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:53,041
Why can't I go
with you?

892
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,534
Well, this is a very delicate
and diplomatic matter.

893
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:56,806
I don't want you to put your foot in it.

894
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,465
I deal with diplomatic
matters every day without feet.

895
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,036
Promise not to
say anything?

896
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:03,363
I won't say a word.

897
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:09,921
Now-Now wait a minute.

898
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,220
Does it have to be
the sea witch?

899
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,586
Why that
particular yacht?

900
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,938
Please, please,
it has to be.

901
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,308
I once was
a guest on it.

902
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:17,253
It must be
the sea witch.

903
00:47:17,622 --> 00:47:19,144
And don't say a word.

904
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:20,561
Oh, I won't.
I won't.

905
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:22,999
How do you do?

906
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:25,285
Good day, miss Kalman.
Mr. Finley's expecting you.

907
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:30,181
Miss Kalman, sir.

908
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:32,084
Hello, Mr. Finley.

909
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:33,727
How nice to let me come
on such short notice.

910
00:47:34,246 --> 00:47:36,040
My pleasure entirely,
I assure you.

911
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:37,276
This is
Mr. Philip Adams,

912
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:38,668
An American
friend of mine.

913
00:47:39,087 --> 00:47:40,215
Mr. Adams is with NATO.

914
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:42,399
Really?
An admirable organization.

915
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:44,006
How do you do, sir?

916
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:44,806
How do you do?

917
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,532
Why, Mr. Finley
spoke to me.

918
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:47,387
I had to
say something.

919
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,513
Now, you're just in time.
Would you like some tea?

920
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:50,729
Oh, no, thank you.

921
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:51,652
Would you, sir?

922
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:52,381
Yes, please.

923
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:53,620
See?
He did it again.

924
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,630
I had to do it
again.

925
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,589
I saw you in your
present play, miss Kalman,

926
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:00,365
And I'd like
to take the opportunity

927
00:48:00,633 --> 00:48:03,478
To tell you how very much
I enjoyed your performance.

928
00:48:03,802 --> 00:48:04,505
Thank you.

929
00:48:04,505 --> 00:48:06,282
As a matter of fact,
I saw it twice.

930
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,498
Several months ago
and only last week

931
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,564
When the duke
gave a theater party.

932
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,398
He likes you, too.

933
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:15,892
I like the part where
you stand in the doorway.

934
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:18,247
"Go, you foolish
young man,

935
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:19,933
And shut the door
behind you."

936
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:21,489
In the second act.

937
00:48:21,854 --> 00:48:24,859
Why, Mr. Finley, you
missed your true calling.

938
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:26,074
You should be
on the stage.

939
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,884
Well, now...

940
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:30,272
what can I do for you?

941
00:48:31,354 --> 00:48:35,435
Well, I've heard a rumor that
it is possible- Just possible-

942
00:48:35,435 --> 00:48:36,769
To charter
the sea witch.

943
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:37,992
So I took it upon myself
to speak to the captain,

944
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,193
And he said it might
be possible,

945
00:48:40,558 --> 00:48:41,855
But only for
the month of October.

946
00:48:42,764 --> 00:48:45,192
But my vacation is the
first two weeks of July.

947
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:48,516
Is there-
Please, dear Mr. Finley,

948
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:49,639
Is there a chance

949
00:48:50,064 --> 00:48:52,209
That the duke would let me
charter it for two weeks in July?

950
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:54,782
I'm terribly sorry
you didn't tell me

951
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:56,776
Your business on the phone. I
could have saved you the trip.

952
00:48:57,683 --> 00:48:59,285
The duke's
not the owner anymore.

953
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:00,704
He sold the sea witch.

954
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,593
Oh, no.

955
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:04,381
I am sorry.

956
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:06,252
I couldn't be
more disappointed.

957
00:49:07,134 --> 00:49:08,393
Oh, well.
Never mind.

958
00:49:08,671 --> 00:49:09,792
Cheer up. It can't
be helped. Come along.

959
00:49:10,624 --> 00:49:12,331
Here's the deed
not filed yet.

960
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,143
I didn't handle
the transaction.

961
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,511
The new owner's
a Philip Adams.

962
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:21,408
Well, at least you're assured it
for the first two weeks in July.

963
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:22,776
You bought it?

964
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:23,902
It was a bargain.

965
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,241
Well,
did you ever see it?

966
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,523
No, but I saw
the photograph.

967
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:29,473
Why did you buy it? We only
wanted it for two weeks?

968
00:49:29,473 --> 00:49:31,214
Because it came
with a dock.

969
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:32,851
That's real estate.
It's very valuable.

970
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:34,736
I didn't own any
in England.

971
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:36,446
What's that got to do
with it?

972
00:49:36,446 --> 00:49:37,991
You don't own anything in
Honolulu, Hawaii, either.

973
00:49:38,301 --> 00:49:40,681
Yes, I do. Another fellow and
I own a canning factory there.

974
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:43,466
You don't understand these thing.
It's called scattering your risk.

975
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:44,839
You invest
in different places.

976
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:48,602
Thank you for the tea,
Mr. Finley.

977
00:49:54,547 --> 00:49:56,062
But aren't you
Mr. Adams?

978
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,727
Give my regards
to the duke.

979
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,322
Goodbye, Mr. Finley.

980
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:05,737
I know why you spend
so much money on me.

981
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:06,482
Why?

982
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:07,987
Your conscience.

983
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,168
You feel you have
to make it up to me.

984
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:12,868
Oh, that's not true.

985
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,105
I buy you presents because
I like to please you.

986
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:24,415
I wish you didn't
have any money.

987
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:28,233
I wonder if
I would've said that

988
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,655
If you hadn't just
bought a yacht.

989
00:50:30,181 --> 00:50:31,721
Well, let's believe
you would.

990
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,318
Well, what about this one?

991
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:40,666
I don't know.
I like the yellow one,

992
00:50:41,562 --> 00:50:43,860
But there's a risk Mrs.
Williams has one like it.

993
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,612
Only thing, I don't know
if she's wearing it tonight.

994
00:50:45,953 --> 00:50:46,926
Why, you'll soon
find that out.

995
00:50:47,508 --> 00:50:48,666
How? You can't ask her.

996
00:50:49,456 --> 00:50:50,541
I wouldn't give her
the satisfaction.

997
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:52,421
I simply drop in to
see Mrs. Williams' maid,

998
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:54,827
Chitchat with her while she
lays out Madame's things,

999
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:56,289
And there we are.

1000
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:57,466
You're a genius, Doris.

1001
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,828
Ask them what color
dress they're wearing...

1002
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,210
she's so happy, Carl.

1003
00:51:04,913 --> 00:51:05,757
She's happy now...

1004
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,178
but for how long?

1005
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:08,803
What's the matter
with you?

1006
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,499
Well, what's
to come of it?

1007
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:12,070
What has to come
of it?

1008
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,667
It can't go on like this.

1009
00:51:15,427 --> 00:51:15,972
Why not?

1010
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:18,904
A man, a wife,
another woman.

1011
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:20,990
I think about that.

1012
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,399
Oh, what
a happy surprise!

1013
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:50,041
You're two hours early!

1014
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:51,353
I took an earlier plane.

1015
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:52,587
Wasn't that
clever of me?

1016
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,766
How nice.

1017
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:57,028
Well, how are you?
How are you feeling?

1018
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,805
Couldn't be better.
Everything's wonderful.

1019
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:00,963
The play's
going beautifully.

1020
00:52:00,963 --> 00:52:01,933
Good.

1021
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:03,873
Oh, when love is right,
everything is right.

1022
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:05,419
Oh, how true.

1023
00:52:06,745 --> 00:52:08,255
What can I do for you?
Come have some tea.

1024
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:09,789
No, thank you.
I had some on the plane.

1025
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,042
Have some of mine.

1026
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,272
Well, if I must.

1027
00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:15,768
Well?

1028
00:52:16,663 --> 00:52:17,529
Out with it.

1029
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:18,814
What do you mean,
out with it?

1030
00:52:18,814 --> 00:52:20,052
The reason
you are early.

1031
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:21,634
Ha ha ha!

1032
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,109
You are the most
transparent man I ever saw.

1033
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:27,471
I hope NATO isn't trusting
you with any secrets.

1034
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:28,587
Oh, you'd be surprised.

1035
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:30,175
Let's hear one.

1036
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:31,838
Oh, you would be
surprised, Mata Hari.

1037
00:52:33,412 --> 00:52:34,898
Just tell me if it's
unpleasant or not.

1038
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,379
I always look at
the end of the book.

1039
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:37,979
I can never wait.

1040
00:52:38,479 --> 00:52:40,568
I know.
You have no restraint.

1041
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,926
All right. Begin.

1042
00:52:47,327 --> 00:52:50,848
Well... well, the secretary
called me into his office,

1043
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:52,163
Sat me down,
and gave me a cigar-

1044
00:52:52,163 --> 00:52:54,317
A good cigar.

1045
00:52:54,728 --> 00:52:56,096
Ooh, that's nice.
And then?

1046
00:52:57,364 --> 00:52:59,577
He wanted to know if I'd
accept a change of assignment.

1047
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:01,524
New York.

1048
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,465
New York?

1049
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,523
Yes. That's what I said-
New York.

1050
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,919
Give him his cigar back.

1051
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,817
I told him we had an
understanding about my duties.

1052
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,298
It would be away,

1053
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:14,860
And it would be inconvenient
for me to change.

1054
00:53:16,378 --> 00:53:17,713
Very inconvenient.

1055
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:23,190
Well...
they can't force you.

1056
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:24,350
It isn't like the army.

1057
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:26,161
No, they can't
force me to go.

1058
00:53:27,439 --> 00:53:28,719
Well, then
everything's all right.

1059
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:31,225
Don't you dare to scare
me like that again.

1060
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:37,009
You were definite about
refusing, weren't you?

1061
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,388
No, darling,
I left it open.

1062
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:40,923
But why?

1063
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:42,610
I wanted your advice.

1064
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:44,726
Well, you have it.

1065
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,778
Yes, you see,
I omitted a sidelight.

1066
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:51,429
You do want to hear the case
for both sides, don't you?

1067
00:53:52,388 --> 00:53:53,180
Well, not particularly.

1068
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:55,288
The man I'd replace
is the author

1069
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:56,769
Of a very complicated
monetary pact.

1070
00:53:57,259 --> 00:53:58,304
He's been working on it
for years,

1071
00:53:58,304 --> 00:53:59,763
And now it's just about
ready to be closed.

1072
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:01,359
Let him close it.

1073
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:02,671
Well, it takes
a lot of negotiating.

1074
00:54:02,962 --> 00:54:03,937
Well, let him.

1075
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,760
Well, he intended to.
He was going to New York,

1076
00:54:06,022 --> 00:54:07,652
But... he's dying.

1077
00:54:08,774 --> 00:54:09,627
He's just found it out.

1078
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:11,397
And now we know,
and we can't let him go.

1079
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:12,749
Oh.

1080
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:14,134
Now what should
I tell the secretary?

1081
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:16,272
Send someone else?

1082
00:54:16,946 --> 00:54:18,909
I'm the only man capable
of handling the work.

1083
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:20,281
You can take
my modest word for it.

1084
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:25,864
How long would it be?

1085
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:28,064
Three months.
Perhaps four or five.

1086
00:54:28,284 --> 00:54:31,525
Five months?

1087
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,013
And you've already said
that you'd go.

1088
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:40,886
It'll go by quicker
than you think.

1089
00:54:41,297 --> 00:54:42,338
Oh, that's not true.

1090
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:44,572
Why do people
always say that?

1091
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,181
It'll be longer
than I think.

1092
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:47,665
Much longer.

1093
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,760
I feel as badly
as you do, darling.

1094
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:52,961
Want to bet?

1095
00:54:56,105 --> 00:54:56,967
When do you leave?

1096
00:54:57,799 --> 00:54:58,927
There's a whole
commission going.

1097
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:00,366
We're sailing tomorrow
on the Elizabeth.

1098
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,518
Tomorrow? It is
as bad as the army.

1099
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:06,027
I know.

1100
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:09,324
And I won't be with you for
your birthday tomorrow night.

1101
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:11,215
And not for
the sea witch either.

1102
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:12,811
You go, dear.

1103
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:14,033
No, not without you.

1104
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:17,319
Oh, I'll miss you so.

1105
00:55:19,585 --> 00:55:22,649
Oh, everything is
impossible for us this way.

1106
00:55:24,144 --> 00:55:24,993
Philip...

1107
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:31,119
could you possibly get
a divorce and marry me?

1108
00:55:36,602 --> 00:55:38,714
Oh, I don't know why
I said... said that.

1109
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:41,467
Oh, please,
please forgive me.

1110
00:55:41,757 --> 00:55:43,892
I... I don't know
what came over me.

1111
00:55:44,496 --> 00:55:45,345
Anna, please-

1112
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,467
I'm so sorry.

1113
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,651
I had no right,
and I know that.

1114
00:55:49,456 --> 00:55:50,686
Now you'll always
remember that I asked you.

1115
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:52,640
No, no,
it's all right-

1116
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,983
Promise me that you'll
put it out of your mind.

1117
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:56,191
You'll forget
that it ever happened.

1118
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:57,583
Promise me
it never happened.

1119
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:58,580
It never happened.

1120
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,056
I never said it.

1121
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:00,760
You never said it.

1122
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:01,454
And we'll never refer
to it as long as we live.

1123
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:02,767
All right, darling.

1124
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,361
Oh, I've done it again.

1125
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:07,691
As long as we live-
That's the same thing.

1126
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,409
Oh, Philip,
you are free.

1127
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:12,767
You can go
when you please.

1128
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:13,976
I have no strings
on you.

1129
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:17,770
I do love you, Anna.

1130
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,616
I don't see how.

1131
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:21,641
Why don't you
get up and leave?

1132
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,807
I wouldn't blame you.

1133
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:26,639
Come on.

1134
00:56:29,078 --> 00:56:30,390
You're very beautiful
when you cry.

1135
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:32,887
Oh, I'm sure.

1136
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,309
Pink eyes... pink
eyes are very becoming.

1137
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:41,182
Listen to me.

1138
00:56:42,168 --> 00:56:43,514
Tomorrow night at midnight,

1139
00:56:43,939 --> 00:56:45,227
Let's drink a toast
to your birthday.

1140
00:56:45,846 --> 00:56:46,634
Will you remember?

1141
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:49,087
I'll drink, all right.

1142
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:52,997
At the first stroke
of Big Ben, raise your glass.

1143
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:54,925
Where will you be?
I'd like to picture you.

1144
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:58,650
The fireplace.
That's usual.

1145
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:01,632
I did it
in a play once.

1146
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:03,787
I was wonderful
in it.

1147
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:08,304
Well, that must be
Margaret and Alfred.

1148
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,185
They know, of course.

1149
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:13,151
Yes. Alfred feels
very badly about it.

1150
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:14,185
He should.

1151
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:16,162
He was the one who
tricked you into NATO.

1152
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:20,690
Hello, dear.

1153
00:57:21,223 --> 00:57:21,944
Hello, Margaret.

1154
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:22,914
Hello, Anna.

1155
00:57:24,432 --> 00:57:25,089
Hello, Judas.

1156
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:27,350
There was
no other choice.

1157
00:57:28,065 --> 00:57:29,285
I could've given you
a list of names-

1158
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:30,529
Yours on top.

1159
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:33,477
As soon as he told me, Anna,
I said, "why can't you go?"

1160
00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:36,561
Her exact words were,
"why in hell can't you go?"

1161
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:40,016
He told me he wasn't
bright enough.

1162
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:42,244
Philip is supposed to be
very clever about money.

1163
00:57:43,142 --> 00:57:44,392
I haven't seen
any evidence of it.

1164
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,585
I think he's going to
bankrupt England and America.

1165
00:57:47,961 --> 00:57:50,063
Never mind. We'll have
a lovely time tonight.

1166
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:52,449
We don't want
you two to be alone.

1167
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:54,465
Why not, may I ask?

1168
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:57,090
You're taking
the wrong attitude.

1169
00:57:57,951 --> 00:57:59,905
The time will go much
quicker than you think.

1170
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,512
I told you.
Everyone says that.

1171
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:04,351
I'm going to get dressed.

1172
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:08,194
Oh, women.

1173
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:10,318
I wish I were
going with you.

1174
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,717
Let's go
to the club.

1175
00:58:12,108 --> 00:58:13,235
No. I think I ought
to stay here.

1176
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,087
They won't come out of that
room for a couple hours.

1177
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:16,848
I'll give you
a game of snooker.

1178
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:18,282
A game of what?

1179
00:58:18,518 --> 00:58:19,620
Snooker.
What's that?

1180
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,879
Come on.
I'll show you.

1181
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,945
The, uh, the group
that's sailing tomorrow

1182
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,995
Is using the four days
on the ship for discussion.

1183
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,670
I'm not in on that.

1184
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:35,862
Would anyone object
if I fly?

1185
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:37,458
No, certainly not.

1186
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,321
Oh, dear.

1187
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,704
Because I'd like to spend
those few extra days here.

1188
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:42,795
Of course.

1189
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:44,333
You see,
tomorrow at midnight,

1190
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,314
Anna and I had planned to
drink a toast to each other.

1191
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,407
She thinks I'll be
on the high seas.

1192
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,630
And you'll
walk in the door?

1193
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,523
Yes, that's the idea.
That ought to surprise her.

1194
00:58:52,943 --> 00:58:53,833
Yes. It should do.

1195
00:58:55,023 --> 00:58:56,048
Well, that's
very romantic.

1196
00:58:56,818 --> 00:58:57,941
I didn't mean that
disparagingly.

1197
00:58:58,689 --> 00:59:00,401
I envy you
your touch.

1198
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:02,956
But it's my belief
that success with women

1199
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:05,125
Is something that
you're born with.

1200
00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:07,601
You're not entitled
to any of the credit.

1201
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,652
I hope I'm not
embarrassing you.

1202
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:11,714
Not at all.

1203
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,871
An interesting
subject.

1204
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:14,029
Yes, and quite popular.

1205
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:16,424
There's one thing
I'm very curious a.

1206
00:59:16,424 --> 00:59:18,835
I'm hesitant
to mention it to you...

1207
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:20,952
for fear
you'll be offended.

1208
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:22,447
Then perhaps
you shouldn't.

1209
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:24,033
I'll just have
to chance it.

1210
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:25,802
All right,
if you must.

1211
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:28,050
Ah... ah... thank you.

1212
00:59:28,788 --> 00:59:29,908
As I said,
I'm just curious...

1213
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:34,879
why do you pretend to be a
married man when you're not?

1214
00:59:44,323 --> 00:59:45,122
How did you know?

1215
00:59:46,045 --> 00:59:47,585
Well, they made quite
a security check.

1216
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:49,994
Do you intend
to tell Anna?

1217
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:51,578
Of course not.
What do you take me for?

1218
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:53,221
Her brother-In-Law,
for one thing.

1219
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:54,677
But I'm not
her guardian.

1220
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,263
You must admit that it
doesn't sound honorable.

1221
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:00,704
Then let me make
my position clear to you.

1222
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:03,502
Actually, it's...
it's clear enough.

1223
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,399
No, no, no.
Obviously it isn't.

1224
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,222
Now, come along now.

1225
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:09,517
Now just try
to follow this.

1226
01:00:09,517 --> 01:00:12,171
Let's just take a...
well, a usual case.

1227
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:15,170
A man meets a woman.
He's attracted to her.

1228
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:17,109
He courts her.

1229
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:20,694
They're old enough,
and she, uh, favors him.

1230
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:24,146
Eventually she'd
like to get married.

1231
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:27,032
He then says
I am not the marrying kind.

1232
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:29,279
Do you admire
such a man?

1233
01:00:29,279 --> 01:00:30,796
No, I don't,
but go on.

1234
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:32,306
Well, I, too,
don't care to be married.

1235
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,410
On the other hand, I don't
care to give up women.

1236
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:36,854
I understand that.

1237
01:00:37,653 --> 01:00:40,421
Now, since I have no
intention of getting married,

1238
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:44,055
I feel honor-Bound to declare
myself in the beginning.

1239
01:00:44,509 --> 01:00:45,948
But before the favors?

1240
01:00:45,948 --> 01:00:47,026
Certainly before the favors.

1241
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:48,372
That's where
the honor comes in.

1242
01:00:48,804 --> 01:00:50,575
Now, how do I
declare myself?

1243
01:00:50,575 --> 01:00:52,826
By saying
I will never marry?

1244
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,907
What woman
really believes that?

1245
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,045
If anything,
it's a challenge to them.

1246
01:00:57,325 --> 01:00:58,317
What do you do?

1247
01:00:58,547 --> 01:01:00,546
Well, I say
I am married.

1248
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:02,726
I'm married, and
I can't get a divorce.

1249
01:01:03,884 --> 01:01:05,581
Now our position is clear.

1250
01:01:05,824 --> 01:01:07,602
There can't be
any misunderstanding later.

1251
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:09,345
It sounds reasonable.

1252
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:10,566
Well,
it is reasonable.

1253
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:12,977
I think NATO has got you
in the wrong job.

1254
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,244
I know there's a big
hole in your argument.

1255
01:01:15,244 --> 01:01:16,444
I haven't come to it
yet, but there must be.

1256
01:01:17,035 --> 01:01:18,943
Why must there be?

1257
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,197
You've got it all wrong.

1258
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:21,784
You're the exception.

1259
01:01:21,784 --> 01:01:23,468
Most people
do get married.

1260
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:24,733
I don't resent that.

1261
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:26,843
That's very
tolerant of you.

1262
01:01:26,843 --> 01:01:29,127
I merely ask them
to respect my indifference.

1263
01:01:29,662 --> 01:01:31,605
You're just against
marriage for yourself.

1264
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:33,050
Oh, indeed I am.

1265
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:37,188
And whether you believe
it or not, I love Anna.

1266
01:01:37,908 --> 01:01:39,764
I love Anna
as I've never loved before.

1267
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,207
But I wouldn't marry
any woman

1268
01:01:42,207 --> 01:01:43,334
If you held
a gun to my head.

1269
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,515
I haven't got any gun.

1270
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:49,179
Anyway, I don't think it's
a brother-In-Law's place.

1271
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:50,792
It has to be
a blood relative.

1272
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:52,869
Come on. Let's go home.

1273
01:02:02,036 --> 01:02:02,507
Hello there.

1274
01:02:03,518 --> 01:02:04,005
I'm back.

1275
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:06,206
Where's Philip?

1276
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,423
He's downstairs in his
apartment getting dressed.

1277
01:02:09,244 --> 01:02:10,685
When Philip gets
off the Elizabeth,

1278
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,379
I'm going to meet him
on the dock.

1279
01:02:12,803 --> 01:02:14,798
I'll fly
while he's sailing.

1280
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:15,839
What's that?

1281
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:16,816
You heard me.

1282
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,739
You heard her.

1283
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:18,736
I was hoping
I didn't.

1284
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:19,795
Well, you were wrong.

1285
01:02:19,795 --> 01:02:21,343
What about your play?

1286
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:23,125
It's a big hit now.

1287
01:02:23,432 --> 01:02:25,024
They can get somebody else
less expensive.

1288
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:26,818
They won't mind.
They'll be delighted.

1289
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:28,333
Anna, be practical.

1290
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,372
I am practical.

1291
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:31,606
I will not be separated
from him for five months.

1292
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,403
You're talking
like a schoolgirl.

1293
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:35,417
A schoolgirl can afford
to wait five months.

1294
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:37,332
See that expression
on her face?

1295
01:02:37,918 --> 01:02:40,081
The first time we saw
it, she was 4 years old.

1296
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:41,811
We couldn't
budge her then.

1297
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,344
Did Philip ask you
to come to New York?

1298
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,045
Philip?
Oh, no, he'd never.

1299
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,307
He'd be too concerned
about my reputation.

1300
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,470
He's the most considerate,
unselfish, honorable man

1301
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,572
That ever lived.

1302
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,494
I'm burning
candles for him.

1303
01:02:56,778 --> 01:02:58,570
You say something.

1304
01:02:58,882 --> 01:03:00,919
You're a diplomat.
Talk her out of it.

1305
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:02,061
What do you advise?

1306
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:04,603
Be brilliant.
Just start me off.

1307
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,927
Please, don't say
anything, Alfred.

1308
01:03:06,927 --> 01:03:07,922
Please.

1309
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:10,466
Well... I'll have
to say this much.

1310
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:13,193
There's no use your
flying over to New York

1311
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:15,050
To meet the Queen Elizabeth
when she docks

1312
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:17,420
Because he
won't be on her.

1313
01:03:18,874 --> 01:03:19,476
He won't?

1314
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:20,630
He has his own surprise.

1315
01:03:21,322 --> 01:03:23,093
As you two are drinking
toasts to each other

1316
01:03:23,093 --> 01:03:24,084
At midnight tomorrow,

1317
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:26,499
He's coming
through that door.

1318
01:03:28,665 --> 01:03:29,853
Oh, oh!

1319
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,499
So you'll have another
three days together.

1320
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:33,665
There, you see?

1321
01:03:33,665 --> 01:03:36,767
Three whole days.
That's enough, isn't it?

1322
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,420
No, that's not enough!

1323
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,683
He's so wonderful.
He's...

1324
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:41,590
oh, Margaret.

1325
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,484
Oh, Anna.

1326
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:46,323
I'd like not
to have told you this,

1327
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,376
And in some way, I shall get
the blame for it, I'm sure.

1328
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:51,799
But there's no use
your flying over there

1329
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,154
To meet him at the dock

1330
01:03:53,154 --> 01:03:55,687
If he isn't going to be on
the ship in the first place.

1331
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:57,992
That's going to be
my story anyway.

1332
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,838
Anna, darling,
pull yourself together.

1333
01:04:00,193 --> 01:04:02,413
I don't like
to be told secrets.

1334
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,280
Whenever anyone
says to me,

1335
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:06,544
"Would you like to hear
something confidential,"

1336
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:08,616
I always say no.

1337
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:09,697
And I've never
regretted it.

1338
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,159
Oh, Margaret.

1339
01:04:11,553 --> 01:04:11,979
Oh, Anna.

1340
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,353
This is going
to be quite a day.

1341
01:04:15,064 --> 01:04:16,008
Oh, he's
so wonderful.

1342
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:17,931
No, he's not.

1343
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,741
He's no good.

1344
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:23,029
He's been fooling you.

1345
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,613
Anna...

1346
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:27,184
he isn't married.

1347
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:30,268
What did you say?

1348
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:31,950
He's single.

1349
01:04:32,877 --> 01:04:35,053
He's a single...
bachelor.

1350
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,039
Yes, this is going
to be quite a day.

1351
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:40,619
How dare you?

1352
01:04:40,991 --> 01:04:41,726
But it's true!

1353
01:04:42,555 --> 01:04:43,519
I know it's true.

1354
01:04:44,015 --> 01:04:44,887
How do you know?

1355
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,157
I saw it in a Scotland Yard
report on Alfred's desk.

1356
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:51,466
What the devil do you mean
by reading things on my desk?

1357
01:04:52,413 --> 01:04:53,533
You've no right
to take advantage

1358
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:54,694
Of your position
as my wife

1359
01:04:54,935 --> 01:04:56,827
To endanger the security
of our government.

1360
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,586
I forbid you
to come into my office

1361
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:01,056
Unless you're announced
and I am there.

1362
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:02,527
Oh, shut up.

1363
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:10,181
I was down on my knees
asking his forgiveness

1364
01:05:10,412 --> 01:05:11,372
Because I asked him
to marry me.

1365
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:13,653
On my knees!

1366
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:17,435
How dare he make love to me
and not be a married man!

1367
01:05:19,508 --> 01:05:21,238
Damn!

1368
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:26,711
Astonishing.

1369
01:05:31,201 --> 01:05:31,967
What was that?

1370
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,123
Perfume bottle
through the mirror.

1371
01:05:36,451 --> 01:05:38,255
You know, when you
come to think of it,

1372
01:05:38,255 --> 01:05:39,527
It's all very strange.

1373
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:42,491
It was perfectly all right
when he was married,

1374
01:05:43,225 --> 01:05:44,579
When you'd think
that it wouldn't be,

1375
01:05:45,652 --> 01:05:47,187
And now that we know
that he's single,

1376
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:49,764
When it should be all right,
if you know what I mean,

1377
01:05:50,229 --> 01:05:51,924
Well, it isn't.

1378
01:05:52,922 --> 01:05:53,900
Do you follow me?

1379
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:55,795
No, I don't follow you.

1380
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,964
Well, I guess we better
call the party off.

1381
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:01,555
I'll make our excuses.
I'll say-

1382
01:06:02,017 --> 01:06:02,569
No.

1383
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:07,389
We'll not
call off the party,

1384
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,729
And you're not going
to tell him anything.

1385
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:11,836
We'll spend the evening
just as we had planned...

1386
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:13,973
as if nothing
had happened.

1387
01:06:15,028 --> 01:06:17,475
Anna, dear, don't you
think it'd be much bet-

1388
01:06:17,758 --> 01:06:18,846
As if nothing
had happened.

1389
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:20,473
That's what we
are going to do.

1390
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:35,802
Oh, delicious steak.
Never tasted better.

1391
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:36,878
How's yours?

1392
01:06:36,878 --> 01:06:37,891
Mmm. It's very good.

1393
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:38,573
Good.

1394
01:06:40,169 --> 01:06:41,186
Margaret,
you're not eating.

1395
01:06:41,938 --> 01:06:42,563
I can't swallow.

1396
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:43,608
Why not?

1397
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:45,745
I'm just
not hungry.

1398
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:47,257
Oh, that's a pity.

1399
01:06:48,876 --> 01:06:50,296
Nice to be in this
place again, isn't it?

1400
01:06:51,122 --> 01:06:52,706
This is where we spent
our first evening together.

1401
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:53,758
Yes, dear.

1402
01:06:54,151 --> 01:06:56,171
Let's hope it won't
be the last.

1403
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:02,706
Ladies and gentlemen,
take your places

1404
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:04,463
For an eightsome reel.

1405
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:05,946
Oh, we ought
to learn that.

1406
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:07,444
Come on, darling,
let's learn it.

1407
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:08,868
It's a party.
Let's celebrate.

1408
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:28,217
Whoops.

1409
01:07:42,865 --> 01:07:43,518
Ah. Oh.

1410
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:02,259
Wonderful.

1411
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:24,306
Oh, I like that.

1412
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:27,320
That's nice.

1413
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:28,362
Hee!

1414
01:08:38,988 --> 01:08:39,578
Oh.

1415
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:44,497
What about that?

1416
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:45,874
Pretty good, huh?

1417
01:08:49,206 --> 01:08:50,945
Hoo! Uh-Oh,
look out.

1418
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,961
Whoo! Oh.

1419
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:03,915
Ooh. Slippery.

1420
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,058
Ooh, sorry.

1421
01:09:11,634 --> 01:09:12,417
Slippery.

1422
01:09:13,088 --> 01:09:13,950
Swing it.

1423
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,401
That's it.

1424
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:22,003
Look out.

1425
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:42,112
Over and change.

1426
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:45,336
Hi. Hey,
where you going?

1427
01:09:45,705 --> 01:09:46,668
Hey,
wait a minute, fellows.

1428
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,433
Hey, fellows,

1429
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:51,590
Hey, fellows, hey.

1430
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:53,171
Oh, well.

1431
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,791
Like that?

1432
01:10:25,381 --> 01:10:26,177
What a performance.

1433
01:10:27,191 --> 01:10:28,246
Too bad the critics
can't see it.

1434
01:10:28,872 --> 01:10:31,553
You know, I'm too old
for this sort of evening.

1435
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:32,692
I always was.

1436
01:10:36,603 --> 01:10:38,086
Margaret, how about
the next dance with me?

1437
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,288
Feeling better, Alfred?

1438
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,522
Yes, fine.

1439
01:10:41,522 --> 01:10:42,435
Good.

1440
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:50,568
Your stomach any better?

1441
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,458
No.

1442
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:55,863
This drink I invented-
Bourbon and Bicetol-

1443
01:10:56,483 --> 01:10:57,328
It'll never catch on.

1444
01:10:58,244 --> 01:10:59,711
What impressed me
was the way

1445
01:11:00,139 --> 01:11:02,104
That you could swallow
anything at dinner.

1446
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:04,157
That was acting.

1447
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:05,384
I couldn't
eat a thing.

1448
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:07,160
Now, he ate
for everybody.

1449
01:11:07,945 --> 01:11:08,783
Look at him.

1450
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:10,642
He's certainly
in good spirits,

1451
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,792
Dancing every dance,
singing.

1452
01:11:13,493 --> 01:11:15,227
You'd think that it
was his wedding night.

1453
01:11:16,457 --> 01:11:17,386
Oh, excuse me.

1454
01:11:18,429 --> 01:11:20,662
Anna, I should like to
say how much I admire

1455
01:11:21,086 --> 01:11:22,523
The way you're carrying
the whole thing off.

1456
01:11:23,123 --> 01:11:25,548
You're sweet,
charming, smiling...

1457
01:11:26,026 --> 01:11:26,992
just right.

1458
01:11:27,675 --> 01:11:29,344
When he's
in America,

1459
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,079
You'll write him
a little note

1460
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:33,563
Explaining that you can't
possibly leave your play,

1461
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:37,217
And the whole relationship
will peter out naturally.

1462
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:38,809
No scene, no fuss.

1463
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:41,535
A gentleman asked me
to lay this on your table.

1464
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:43,248
Thank you.

1465
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:45,672
A red rose-
Who sent it?

1466
01:11:46,437 --> 01:11:48,182
David sent it.
He's here.

1467
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,069
David? Your David?

1468
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:51,390
Your old David?

1469
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:52,680
My old David.

1470
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,005
Where is he?
I didn't see him.

1471
01:11:55,253 --> 01:11:56,359
He was on
the dance floor.

1472
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,411
Say, I liked David.

1473
01:11:59,112 --> 01:12:01,482
I even fancied him for a
moment as a brother-In-Law.

1474
01:12:02,339 --> 01:12:03,854
I always meant to ask
you what happened to him.

1475
01:12:06,546 --> 01:12:07,427
What's the matter?

1476
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:10,877
Anna, what is it?

1477
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:18,792
I'm sorry that was
such a short whirl.

1478
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:20,308
You owe me another.

1479
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:22,806
How's everything at this
table, may I inquire?

1480
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:24,569
Everything is fine.

1481
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:26,288
Just fine.

1482
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:31,375
Uh, let's all go home now, shall we?

1483
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:35,217
Well, if we must.
No difference to me.

1484
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:37,275
Yes. It's getting late.

1485
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,017
Call me at home
later.

1486
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:03,501
Well...

1487
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,926
I will now draw
the first clear breath

1488
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:09,686
That I have drawn
all evening.

1489
01:13:10,403 --> 01:13:12,024
Did you see all that
signaling in the elevator?

1490
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:14,164
Wigwagging
over our heads,

1491
01:13:14,678 --> 01:13:16,251
Asking to come up here
after we've gone.

1492
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,124
Well, we'll just
stay the night here.

1493
01:13:18,124 --> 01:13:19,161
That's all there is
to it.

1494
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,050
Well, I guess that's best.
That'll do it to him.

1495
01:13:21,637 --> 01:13:23,370
Anna, call downstairs,

1496
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:25,354
Say we're
in the guest room,

1497
01:13:25,725 --> 01:13:26,621
And you couldn't
get rid of us.

1498
01:13:27,064 --> 01:13:29,002
Saying good night in
the elevator, smirking.

1499
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:30,326
Really, he's not
very subtle.

1500
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,600
He manages
to fool people,

1501
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:33,991
People who think
they're rather bright.

1502
01:13:34,574 --> 01:13:36,238
You have nothing
to blame yourself for.

1503
01:13:36,772 --> 01:13:38,320
You're a woman,
and you were deceived.

1504
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:40,046
It happens every day,
oftener.

1505
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:42,006
Not to me.

1506
01:13:42,411 --> 01:13:43,684
Even our
staying here tonight

1507
01:13:43,684 --> 01:13:44,839
Doesn't settle
the whole problem.

1508
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:47,511
He means to surprise you
at midnight tomorrow

1509
01:13:47,984 --> 01:13:50,120
Whilst you're supposedly
drinking toasts to each other

1510
01:13:50,443 --> 01:13:51,604
In honor
of your birthday.

1511
01:13:51,604 --> 01:13:53,767
I'd forgotten that. He's going
to be here for three days.

1512
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:55,317
I can't stay
for three days.

1513
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:57,483
I can. I shall have
some things sent down.

1514
01:13:57,971 --> 01:13:59,673
We'll make it a visit,
have a lovely time.

1515
01:14:00,334 --> 01:14:02,046
I don't remember
inviting you.

1516
01:14:02,352 --> 01:14:03,721
What are you saying?

1517
01:14:04,179 --> 01:14:05,995
You will please leave
and now.

1518
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:07,762
Leave?
Leave?

1519
01:14:07,762 --> 01:14:08,539
Leave.

1520
01:14:08,799 --> 01:14:10,019
Do you mean to let him
come up here?

1521
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:11,278
I mean to let him
come up here.

1522
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:12,616
But why?

1523
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:14,242
Well, I mean,
what for?

1524
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:16,673
I mean,
how could you?

1525
01:14:17,401 --> 01:14:18,793
Now, what have you
got in mind?

1526
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:20,000
None of your business.

1527
01:14:20,237 --> 01:14:21,509
Anna, I want
to talk to you.

1528
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,682
I've known you ever
since you were born,

1529
01:14:23,682 --> 01:14:25,730
And there's one thing about
your character I don't admire:

1530
01:14:26,318 --> 01:14:27,458
You go to extremes.

1531
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:29,002
What do you mean to do?

1532
01:14:29,475 --> 01:14:31,301
Look, you're
a prominent person.

1533
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,080
You have to think
of scandal.

1534
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:36,016
Oh, you haven't got a gun,
have you?

1535
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:37,609
Shooting is too good
for him.

1536
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:39,802
That's how I like
to hear you talk-

1537
01:14:40,299 --> 01:14:41,145
No violence.

1538
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:42,573
What do you intend
to do?

1539
01:14:42,788 --> 01:14:44,954
Just give us an idea.
We're family.

1540
01:14:46,585 --> 01:14:47,252
What is it?

1541
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:49,289
A rose?

1542
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:51,754
Yes, a rose,
a red rose.

1543
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:53,261
David sent it
to our table.

1544
01:14:53,963 --> 01:14:54,849
I didn't see him.

1545
01:14:55,569 --> 01:14:56,559
Why didn't you
tell me?

1546
01:14:58,383 --> 01:15:00,373
Philip. He wants
to know if we're out

1547
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:01,885
And if the coast
is clear.

1548
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:04,227
Well, we're not, and it isn't,
and it's not going to be.

1549
01:15:04,673 --> 01:15:05,562
It's not Philip.

1550
01:15:05,562 --> 01:15:07,013
It is David.
I asked him to call.

1551
01:15:07,992 --> 01:15:09,459
Hello?

1552
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,203
Hello, David.

1553
01:15:12,344 --> 01:15:13,374
Certainly I'm alone.

1554
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,814
There is no sincerity
like a woman telling a lie.

1555
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:19,657
It was nice
seeing you again.

1556
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:22,767
Tomorrow night
would be fine.

1557
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:24,609
Anywhere you say.

1558
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:27,658
As a matter of fact, I'm
not very keen on going out.

1559
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,924
This was a big evening,
and when I'm working,

1560
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:31,279
I don't feel like
two in a row.

1561
01:15:31,924 --> 01:15:34,125
Why don't you join me for
supper here after the play?

1562
01:15:35,175 --> 01:15:36,388
For heaven's sakes.

1563
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:38,379
Well, let's
make it 11:30.

1564
01:15:39,147 --> 01:15:40,274
Well,
that's 11:30.

1565
01:15:40,694 --> 01:15:41,786
You've got that
right now?

1566
01:15:42,031 --> 01:15:43,741
11:30 here.

1567
01:15:45,062 --> 01:15:46,412
All right,
David.

1568
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:48,756
Bye-Bye.

1569
01:15:50,661 --> 01:15:51,844
Won't it be
a little crowded?

1570
01:15:52,568 --> 01:15:55,146
You haven't forgotten you've
another suitor coming at 12:00?

1571
01:15:55,459 --> 01:15:56,479
I haven't forgotten.

1572
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:57,691
That's all
I've been thinking of,

1573
01:15:58,008 --> 01:15:59,655
His walking through
that door at midnight

1574
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,434
And surprising me
with another man!

1575
01:16:02,101 --> 01:16:03,777
That's how I was able to
keep on smiling at him,

1576
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,029
To keep from smashing him
over the head with a lamp.

1577
01:16:06,258 --> 01:16:07,283
Anna, what's
gotten into you?

1578
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:10,624
Tomorrow night, I can see
the expression on his face-

1579
01:16:11,162 --> 01:16:12,047
The shock...

1580
01:16:12,453 --> 01:16:13,622
the unbelief...

1581
01:16:14,275 --> 01:16:15,496
the horror.

1582
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,456
He catches me
with another man.

1583
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:20,984
Him-So charming,
so handsome,

1584
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:22,388
So generous,

1585
01:16:22,636 --> 01:16:24,424
And still
she took another.

1586
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:25,530
How could she?

1587
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:27,730
It'll be a nightmare

1588
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,409
That he'll remember
the rest of his life.

1589
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:32,297
He'll go over it and
over it a thousand times,

1590
01:16:33,074 --> 01:16:35,404
And each time, it will
burn deeper and deeper

1591
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:37,751
Until he won't have
to recall it at all.

1592
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:38,876
It will just be there.

1593
01:16:39,459 --> 01:16:41,384
How am I going to exist
until tomorrow night?

1594
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,971
And to think how carefully
you were brought up.

1595
01:16:44,971 --> 01:16:46,196
Well, I'm against it.

1596
01:16:46,196 --> 01:16:47,192
It's my considered
opinion, Anna,

1597
01:16:47,192 --> 01:16:48,328
That you're
playing with fire.

1598
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,814
Alfred's right.
You're overdoing it.

1599
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:51,980
Let's all keep calm.
Let's sleep on it.

1600
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:53,586
Tomorrow,
when we're cooler,

1601
01:16:53,898 --> 01:16:55,011
We'll discuss it
rationally.

1602
01:16:55,434 --> 01:16:56,861
After all, we're grown men and women.

1603
01:16:57,582 --> 01:16:59,232
Very well put, dear.
We're all overwrought now.

1604
01:16:59,232 --> 01:16:59,975
We're not thinking
clearly.

1605
01:16:59,975 --> 01:17:01,016
Well, I'm
thinking clearly.

1606
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,099
No, you're not.

1607
01:17:02,099 --> 01:17:03,691
You have the feeling
that you're a wronged woman.

1608
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,075
I am a wronged woman!

1609
01:17:05,481 --> 01:17:06,377
You know
what I mean.

1610
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:07,651
You know what I mean.

1611
01:17:07,651 --> 01:17:08,643
I'm the wrongedest
woman you ever saw,

1612
01:17:08,643 --> 01:17:10,227
And I'm going to pay
him back with interest,

1613
01:17:10,629 --> 01:17:12,085
2 or 3,000 %
of interest.

1614
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:15,713
Well, there he is now,
sooner than usual.

1615
01:17:16,681 --> 01:17:18,407
So impatient,
so flattering.

1616
01:17:19,687 --> 01:17:20,631
Anna, we're
staying over.

1617
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:23,434
Hello?

1618
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:25,839
Yes, dear,
they've gone.

1619
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:27,710
How nice of you to call
and say goodnight.

1620
01:17:28,636 --> 01:17:29,570
Oh, by the way,

1621
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:31,337
Why don't you come up
for a nightcap,

1622
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:33,196
Just this once?

1623
01:17:34,186 --> 01:17:36,246
No? All right.

1624
01:17:36,858 --> 01:17:37,531
Good night.

1625
01:17:38,752 --> 01:17:40,122
Oh, good.

1626
01:17:40,545 --> 01:17:41,342
It's all right.

1627
01:17:41,684 --> 01:17:42,470
He's not coming up.

1628
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:44,052
Of course he's coming up.

1629
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:45,480
He says that so
the operator won't know.

1630
01:17:46,313 --> 01:17:47,933
So considerate
about my reputation.

1631
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:51,149
Well, get going.
He'll be here any minute.

1632
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:52,779
I'm not going,
and you can't make me.

1633
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:53,921
Good night,
dear sister.

1634
01:17:54,138 --> 01:17:55,403
Anna, you're just
being impulsive.

1635
01:17:55,996 --> 01:17:57,106
I've only got your
interests at heart.

1636
01:17:58,008 --> 01:17:58,666
Good night.

1637
01:17:58,666 --> 01:17:59,590
I'll tell you one thing.

1638
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:01,675
I shall telephone you
every 15 minutes,

1639
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,099
If somebody doesn't
answer the phone,

1640
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:04,447
I shall be right back.

1641
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:05,748
Good night, Anna.

1642
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,153
I'll send for our
clothes in the morning.

1643
01:18:07,153 --> 01:18:08,621
Remember,
nothing in anger.

1644
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:11,323
Hurry, dear. If he catches
us, we'll be embarrassed.

1645
01:18:11,727 --> 01:18:12,763
Why should we
be embarrassed?

1646
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:14,841
He's the one that's
sneaking up here.

1647
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:15,737
Come on!

1648
01:18:17,094 --> 01:18:18,296
Remember mama!

1649
01:19:06,296 --> 01:19:06,995
Hello?

1650
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:07,988
Good evening, darling.

1651
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:09,510
It isn't the beginning
of the evening.

1652
01:19:09,798 --> 01:19:10,749
It is for me.

1653
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,668
Champagne
for the occasion.

1654
01:19:19,981 --> 01:19:20,747
Some for you.

1655
01:19:21,348 --> 01:19:23,327
Some for me.

1656
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,101
I'll swizzle it
with my nose.

1657
01:19:32,982 --> 01:19:33,586
May I?

1658
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:34,602
Of course.

1659
01:19:36,631 --> 01:19:37,121
Ooh.

1660
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:38,715
You dressed for bed?

1661
01:19:38,715 --> 01:19:39,630
Mm-Hmm.

1662
01:19:42,203 --> 01:19:42,839
I smell perfume.

1663
01:19:43,499 --> 01:19:44,061
Oh.

1664
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:46,019
Well, what happened
to that?

1665
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:47,741
Oh, just
a little accident.

1666
01:19:48,629 --> 01:19:50,284
It was very thoughtful
of you

1667
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:52,484
Not letting the telephone
operator know you were coming up.

1668
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:54,195
That was the least
I could do.

1669
01:19:54,765 --> 01:19:55,659
It's typical of you,

1670
01:19:56,066 --> 01:19:57,144
Consideration
in small things.

1671
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,247
You don't think
we're fooling anyone?

1672
01:20:00,799 --> 01:20:01,516
Indeed, I do.

1673
01:20:01,837 --> 01:20:03,116
Oh, the whole building
will know.

1674
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:05,083
Now, how could that be true?
How could they know?

1675
01:20:05,363 --> 01:20:06,481
The elevator operator.

1676
01:20:06,937 --> 01:20:08,047
I used the stairs.

1677
01:20:08,911 --> 01:20:11,025
Oh, did you, really?

1678
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:12,346
Don't start
admiring me again.

1679
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:13,483
It's only one flight.

1680
01:20:13,908 --> 01:20:14,560
Mmm.

1681
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:15,944
Oh.

1682
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:20,328
I have here a token
of my esteem and regard.

1683
01:20:21,538 --> 01:20:23,281
You've given me quite
enough presents.

1684
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,765
Yes, but this is
your birthday present.

1685
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:27,419
This must not be opened
before midnight tomorrow night.

1686
01:20:28,026 --> 01:20:29,062
I'd like to
ask you something.

1687
01:20:29,293 --> 01:20:30,561
What?

1688
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:32,733
Did you give your wife
as many presents

1689
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:34,648
Before
you were separated?

1690
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:37,045
Well, that's not
much of a subject.

1691
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:40,309
I'm very curious.
Tell me.

1692
01:20:41,573 --> 01:20:42,636
Well, yes, I guess so.

1693
01:20:42,636 --> 01:20:43,617
Why do you ask?

1694
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:45,746
I'm trying to figure out
whether you are truly generous

1695
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:47,095
Or if it is
your conscience.

1696
01:20:47,623 --> 01:20:48,682
Many people get credit

1697
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,300
For doing admirable
things that they rarely do

1698
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,286
Because they'd feel
uncomfortable if they didn't.

1699
01:20:52,627 --> 01:20:54,656
I hope that's from
a play you're in

1700
01:20:54,656 --> 01:20:55,819
Because
it's pretty silly.

1701
01:20:56,177 --> 01:20:57,475
It's from the play
I'm in now.

1702
01:20:58,273 --> 01:20:59,251
I don't remember that.

1703
01:20:59,823 --> 01:21:01,124
Oh. Now,
about this present.

1704
01:21:01,754 --> 01:21:03,426
It looks very expensive.
It's so small.

1705
01:21:04,325 --> 01:21:05,606
Well, it is expensive.

1706
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:08,205
I'll take it.
I deserve it.

1707
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:11,036
Anna, what is
the matter with you?

1708
01:21:11,036 --> 01:21:12,826
You've taken the best
years of my life.

1709
01:21:14,021 --> 01:21:15,852
Why are you
behaving so strangely?

1710
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:17,500
You've been in a dozen
different moods,

1711
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:19,015
Most of which
I've never seen before.

1712
01:21:19,294 --> 01:21:21,085
Mystery, that is
my stock in trade.

1713
01:21:21,786 --> 01:21:23,302
I'm a woman,
you know.

1714
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,402
I know.
I'll testify to that.

1715
01:21:25,892 --> 01:21:26,544
I...

1716
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:31,461
will you-Will you
get into another mood?

1717
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:34,576
Something less, uh,
flippant, please.

1718
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:36,171
I'll wait.

1719
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:38,337
What kind of mood
would you like?

1720
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:41,784
Nothing makes a man
feel more ridiculous

1721
01:21:42,054 --> 01:21:43,948
Than being sentimental
when a woman is not.

1722
01:21:44,212 --> 01:21:46,924
Oh, you want
sentiment, huh?

1723
01:21:48,886 --> 01:21:49,744
You sure it's expensive?

1724
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:52,009
Well, then,
I can do that.

1725
01:21:52,925 --> 01:21:53,996
I'm an actress.

1726
01:21:55,045 --> 01:21:56,375
You couldn't deceive me.

1727
01:21:56,815 --> 01:21:58,871
Mmm. You'd be surprised.

1728
01:22:00,839 --> 01:22:02,120
Oh, darling.

1729
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:05,115
Oh, I'll miss you
terribly.

1730
01:22:05,938 --> 01:22:07,356
I'll walk
into a crowded room.

1731
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,083
Someone will be standing
the way you stand.

1732
01:22:09,785 --> 01:22:11,689
He'll hold his head the
way you hold your head,

1733
01:22:12,477 --> 01:22:14,125
The way you hold
your knife and fork.

1734
01:22:14,866 --> 01:22:17,000
I don't hold my knife and
fork in any special way.

1735
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:18,770
Yes, you do. You hold
your fork straight up,

1736
01:22:19,188 --> 01:22:20,357
As a little boy does.

1737
01:22:21,306 --> 01:22:22,851
Now, that
is in your play.

1738
01:22:23,358 --> 01:22:24,106
You see?

1739
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:25,476
Well, you are
in a strange mood.

1740
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:27,435
Ahh.

1741
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:30,917
What character are you
playing now?

1742
01:22:31,225 --> 01:22:32,057
Delilah.

1743
01:22:32,271 --> 01:22:33,734
Delilah-From the bible?

1744
01:22:33,734 --> 01:22:35,431
I don't see the parallel.

1745
01:22:35,672 --> 01:22:36,767
It's my own
interpretation.

1746
01:22:37,466 --> 01:22:38,934
If I'm going to be
destroyed anyway-

1747
01:22:38,934 --> 01:22:42,734
Is it going to be
that sort of an evening?

1748
01:22:43,106 --> 01:22:44,097
It's only Margaret.

1749
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,888
Margaret. The woman
loves the telephone.

1750
01:22:46,427 --> 01:22:47,631
What would she have done
100 years ago?

1751
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:50,193
Probably have sent
carrier pigeons. Hello?

1752
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:52,311
The skies would have
been black with them.

1753
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:53,589
Hello, David.

1754
01:22:54,853 --> 01:22:56,337
Oh, this is quite
a surprise.

1755
01:22:57,021 --> 01:22:58,801
Uh, you think
I ought to...

1756
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:00,099
don't you dare leave.

1757
01:23:00,982 --> 01:23:01,954
You may wish
to speak privately.

1758
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:03,684
Why, Philip,
you're not jealous?

1759
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,345
That's not jealousy.

1760
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:06,307
That's just
common courtesy.

1761
01:23:06,307 --> 01:23:07,386
You're beginning
to blush.

1762
01:23:08,294 --> 01:23:10,529
Huh? No, no.
I'm not alone.

1763
01:23:10,807 --> 01:23:11,573
Doris is here.

1764
01:23:12,368 --> 01:23:13,449
Doris is leaving.

1765
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:14,927
She's just leaving.

1766
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,253
I'm not interested
in Alfred's advice.

1767
01:23:24,488 --> 01:23:25,374
Oh, Margaret.

1768
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:27,541
Then let Alfred
take a sleeping pill.

1769
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:29,050
Good night.

1770
01:23:33,628 --> 01:23:35,080
You can come
back now, Doris!

1771
01:23:47,744 --> 01:23:48,835
You know, I think I
ought to point out to you

1772
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:50,219
That I'm not jealous.

1773
01:23:50,444 --> 01:23:51,456
Oh, I'm glad.

1774
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,017
I was so afraid when you
left the room just now

1775
01:23:53,017 --> 01:23:54,694
That you were displeased.

1776
01:23:54,694 --> 01:23:57,209
No-Well, yes, as a matter
of fact, I was displeased,

1777
01:23:57,846 --> 01:23:59,045
But that's not the same
as jealousy.

1778
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:00,698
You see,
I'm a very honest man,

1779
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:03,318
And I'll admit that I was
displeased at his calling you.

1780
01:24:03,607 --> 01:24:05,398
Yes, you are honest,

1781
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:07,487
And I'm going
to match your honesty.

1782
01:24:08,107 --> 01:24:08,955
What do you mean?

1783
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:11,956
I've been hiding this
from you.

1784
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:13,074
Well, what is it?

1785
01:24:13,856 --> 01:24:15,035
A red rose.

1786
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:17,382
Now, where
did you get it?

1787
01:24:17,382 --> 01:24:18,514
Where did it come from?

1788
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:19,677
David?

1789
01:24:19,915 --> 01:24:21,138
I wasn't going to
let you know about it.

1790
01:24:21,878 --> 01:24:22,967
I didn't have
confidence in you.

1791
01:24:23,242 --> 01:24:24,122
I'm ashamed of myself.

1792
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:26,727
Did he give it to you
this evening? Where?

1793
01:24:27,474 --> 01:24:28,980
Was he at the dance?

1794
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:30,349
Was there a note with it?

1795
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:31,961
Did he bring it over
himself?

1796
01:24:32,461 --> 01:24:33,786
A waiter
brought it over.

1797
01:24:33,786 --> 01:24:34,732
Oh, then he didn't
speak to you.

1798
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:35,758
He did.

1799
01:24:35,997 --> 01:24:37,731
When? How? I danced
with you all evening.

1800
01:24:37,731 --> 01:24:38,688
I was with you
every minute.

1801
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,823
When I went to the powder
room, he followed me.

1802
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:43,363
He followed you
to the p-

1803
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:46,400
Well! I will not
lower myself

1804
01:24:46,744 --> 01:24:48,190
To discussing
such behavior.

1805
01:24:48,404 --> 01:24:50,236
I will merely say that
he does not flatter you.

1806
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,216
I pictured more
of a - a gentleman.

1807
01:24:52,998 --> 01:24:54,741
David is a gentleman.
Take my word for it.

1808
01:24:54,981 --> 01:24:55,750
Oh, come now!

1809
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,040
You'd like him.

1810
01:24:57,413 --> 01:24:58,246
Yes, you would.

1811
01:24:58,694 --> 01:24:59,888
You'd get along
beautifully together.

1812
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:03,458
Hardly. You know, I don't
consider myself a snob,

1813
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,235
But I'm sure there's no
one among my acquaintances

1814
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:06,890
Who follow women
to powder rooms.

1815
01:25:07,576 --> 01:25:09,495
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe
he didn't follow me.

1816
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:11,110
Maybe it was
just a coincidence.

1817
01:25:11,547 --> 01:25:12,596
No. He was
following you.

1818
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:15,653
In any case, did I do the
right thing in telling you?

1819
01:25:16,293 --> 01:25:17,077
Certainly, you did.

1820
01:25:17,077 --> 01:25:17,999
And you're not upset?

1821
01:25:17,999 --> 01:25:19,377
Not the slightest.
I'm pleased.

1822
01:25:19,668 --> 01:25:20,316
Pleased?

1823
01:25:20,752 --> 01:25:23,808
Frankly, I was curious to
know what sort of a man he is.

1824
01:25:24,116 --> 01:25:25,216
I'm not anymore.

1825
01:25:25,559 --> 01:25:27,400
I'm glad. That's
the way to look at it.

1826
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,547
What did he say to you
on the phone?

1827
01:25:31,185 --> 01:25:31,838
On the phone?

1828
01:25:32,076 --> 01:25:33,030
I'm sorry.
I wasn't asking,

1829
01:25:33,385 --> 01:25:34,766
But you were explaining
about him,

1830
01:25:34,766 --> 01:25:35,857
And I thought you
intended to tell me.

1831
01:25:36,284 --> 01:25:38,383
I was just trying to help
the conversation along.

1832
01:25:39,132 --> 01:25:40,196
I don't mind
telling you.

1833
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,593
I'd rather not hear it.

1834
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:42,739
I'd like to tell you.

1835
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:44,107
It's of no interest
to me whatsoever.

1836
01:25:44,693 --> 01:25:45,786
He asked me
to go out with him.

1837
01:25:46,537 --> 01:25:47,849
And what did you say?

1838
01:25:49,143 --> 01:25:50,366
Here or at the dance?

1839
01:25:51,578 --> 01:25:52,771
He asked you
at both places?

1840
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,964
Well, he asked me there,
and I said no,

1841
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:57,886
And now
he asked me again.

1842
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:00,566
And what did you say?

1843
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,367
What do you think
I said?

1844
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,632
Absolutely not.

1845
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:10,273
Oh. Oh, well.

1846
01:26:10,273 --> 01:26:11,282
If you feel like it,

1847
01:26:11,282 --> 01:26:12,119
Why don't you
go out with him?

1848
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:13,303
You're such old friends.

1849
01:26:13,746 --> 01:26:15,292
I like you better
when you're jealous.

1850
01:26:15,515 --> 01:26:17,181
No, I mean it. You'll
be lonely while I'm away.

1851
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:18,299
I won't mind.

1852
01:26:18,299 --> 01:26:19,383
Oh, I couldn't.
I couldn't.

1853
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:22,767
What I like about you
is you're so fair.

1854
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:24,984
Yes, I think I am.
I try to be objective.

1855
01:26:26,089 --> 01:26:28,443
Sending a rose
to the table,

1856
01:26:28,908 --> 01:26:30,048
That's really adolescent,
isn't it?

1857
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:31,257
Well.

1858
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:32,247
He's not
very considerate,

1859
01:26:32,247 --> 01:26:33,409
Calling you
at this time of night.

1860
01:26:33,761 --> 01:26:35,555
He knows I don't go
to bed until later.

1861
01:26:38,998 --> 01:26:40,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

1862
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,709
That was the wrong
thing to say, wasn't it?

1863
01:26:43,623 --> 01:26:44,781
Try to forget it.

1864
01:26:45,184 --> 01:26:46,104
Put it out of your mind.

1865
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,418
For an evening
at started out well,

1866
01:26:48,728 --> 01:26:50,403
This has turned into one of
the most exasperating evenings

1867
01:26:50,403 --> 01:26:51,418
Of my whole life.

1868
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,578
Your life
isn't over yet.

1869
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:56,774
I think an ex-Suitor
who doesn't realize

1870
01:26:56,983 --> 01:26:58,369
He's an ex-Suitor
and doesn't stay ex'd

1871
01:26:58,369 --> 01:26:59,995
Is the most despicable
kind of human being-

1872
01:26:59,995 --> 01:27:02,243
I'd tell him so
to his face.

1873
01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:03,873
He's taller
than you are.

1874
01:27:04,312 --> 01:27:05,536
That's enough.
I'm leaving.

1875
01:27:05,975 --> 01:27:06,886
Good night, dear.

1876
01:27:23,555 --> 01:27:24,846
I'm terribly sorry,
darling.

1877
01:27:25,169 --> 01:27:26,388
Oh, that's all right.

1878
01:27:26,672 --> 01:27:27,479
Forgive me, please.

1879
01:27:28,088 --> 01:27:29,095
Mmm! Mmm.

1880
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,465
What is it?

1881
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:34,260
Oh, I have
a splitting headache.

1882
01:27:34,935 --> 01:27:36,737
Oh, don't be
irritated now.

1883
01:27:37,097 --> 01:27:38,010
It's only your vanity.

1884
01:27:38,348 --> 01:27:39,117
I'm not irritated.

1885
01:27:39,374 --> 01:27:41,069
Yes, you are.
Oh, don't be.

1886
01:27:41,314 --> 01:27:42,489
You're going to leave
so early in the morning,

1887
01:27:42,705 --> 01:27:43,751
And I won't
see you anymore.

1888
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:44,851
I wish
I'd left yesterday.

1889
01:27:45,162 --> 01:27:46,333
Well, I can't help
the headache.

1890
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,724
That's why I've been
acting so strangely.

1891
01:27:48,254 --> 01:27:49,168
I've been trying
to hide it.

1892
01:27:49,788 --> 01:27:51,076
I'm awfully sorry, dear. And I
haven't been behaving too well.

1893
01:27:52,464 --> 01:27:55,188
Yes, you have, considering
that you are worried

1894
01:27:55,188 --> 01:27:56,374
Whether I got
a splitting headache

1895
01:27:56,374 --> 01:27:58,119
Only after
the telephone call,

1896
01:27:58,983 --> 01:27:59,748
Aren't you?

1897
01:28:03,349 --> 01:28:04,057
No more.

1898
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:07,844
Oh, darling.

1899
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:09,073
Oh, good night, dear.
Good night.

1900
01:28:12,545 --> 01:28:12,670
Good night.

1901
01:28:14,349 --> 01:28:14,859
Take care.

1902
01:28:15,476 --> 01:28:16,190
I will.

1903
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,937
And write.

1904
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:19,095
I'll phone.

1905
01:28:19,693 --> 01:28:20,690
Oh, here's your present,
darling.

1906
01:28:21,306 --> 01:28:23,037
Don't forget. At the
first stroke of midnight-

1907
01:28:23,037 --> 01:28:24,065
I'll raise my glass.

1908
01:28:26,048 --> 01:28:26,470
Yes, dear.

1909
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:28,735
Goodbye.

1910
01:28:36,642 --> 01:28:38,744
I've seen plays with wonderful
goodbye lines in them.

1911
01:28:39,003 --> 01:28:39,845
I'm trying
to remember one.

1912
01:28:40,631 --> 01:28:41,433
I've heard them all.

1913
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:43,432
Yes, I guess you have.

1914
01:28:43,432 --> 01:28:45,338
Well, goodbye, dear.

1915
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:47,765
Very clever
and to the point.

1916
01:28:50,341 --> 01:28:51,951
Uh, don't forget.
Tomorrow at midnight.

1917
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,423
I'm thinking about it
right now.

1918
01:29:09,633 --> 01:29:10,609
You think we've
overdone the flowers?

1919
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:12,613
We've never had
this many before.

1920
01:29:13,153 --> 01:29:13,972
How many are there?

1921
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:15,430
You told me
to get five dozen,

1922
01:29:15,797 --> 01:29:16,700
And Mr. Wilson sent two.

1923
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:17,700
That's seven dozen
altogether.

1924
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:21,590
It is a bit thick, and it
smells like a flower shop.

1925
01:29:22,343 --> 01:29:23,174
Shall I take
some of them out?

1926
01:29:23,174 --> 01:29:24,341
No. I want them
to be noticeable.

1927
01:29:24,884 --> 01:29:25,681
They have to stick out.

1928
01:29:26,412 --> 01:29:27,751
I want them to be seen
at first glance.

1929
01:29:28,694 --> 01:29:29,344
Yes, ma'am.

1930
01:29:29,996 --> 01:29:31,092
Grilled lobster,

1931
01:29:31,545 --> 01:29:33,085
And I've taken
the champagne

1932
01:29:33,404 --> 01:29:34,353
Out of the icebox
so it's cold.

1933
01:29:34,707 --> 01:29:35,651
Very good, Doris.

1934
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,548
I cannot understand why
Mr. Wilson hasn't come yet.

1935
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:39,363
What time is it?

1936
01:29:39,905 --> 01:29:40,898
20 minutes to 12:00.

1937
01:29:41,483 --> 01:29:42,169
Oh.

1938
01:29:44,938 --> 01:29:47,088
Mayfair 5-1-0-1.

1939
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,854
Mr. Wilson, please.
David Wilson.

1940
01:29:55,282 --> 01:29:57,457
Oh, uh, could you tell me
how long ago he left?

1941
01:29:59,151 --> 01:30:00,530
Did he leave any message?

1942
01:30:01,524 --> 01:30:02,102
He didn't.

1943
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:03,582
Well, thank you.

1944
01:30:05,043 --> 01:30:06,412
I don't know
what has happened.

1945
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:08,537
Hello?

1946
01:30:09,085 --> 01:30:09,816
Yes.

1947
01:30:10,177 --> 01:30:11,647
Who?

1948
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:14,347
Oh, no.

1949
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:17,544
Oh.

1950
01:30:19,725 --> 01:30:20,594
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

1951
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:22,508
Remember me to him.

1952
01:30:23,691 --> 01:30:24,955
Tell him
he has my sympathy.

1953
01:30:26,063 --> 01:30:26,522
Thank you.

1954
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:30,319
Is anything the matter?

1955
01:30:31,034 --> 01:30:32,678
They carried Mr. Wilson off
the tennis court this afternoon

1956
01:30:33,057 --> 01:30:33,896
With acute appendicitis.

1957
01:30:34,548 --> 01:30:35,176
Oh, my!

1958
01:30:35,176 --> 01:30:36,611
He was on the operating
table 45 minutes.

1959
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:37,946
The operation
was very successful.

1960
01:30:38,377 --> 01:30:39,337
Oh, I'm glad.

1961
01:30:39,337 --> 01:30:40,677
The first thing he said when
he came out of the ether was,

1962
01:30:41,049 --> 01:30:43,055
"Call miss Kalman
and apologize for me."

1963
01:30:43,482 --> 01:30:44,310
Wasn't that
considerate?

1964
01:30:44,633 --> 01:30:45,277
Considerate?

1965
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:46,904
What the hell was he
doing playing tennis?

1966
01:30:49,433 --> 01:30:50,173
Would you like
some lobster?

1967
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:51,364
No.

1968
01:30:51,907 --> 01:30:52,685
It will make you
feel better.

1969
01:30:52,685 --> 01:30:53,799
No, it won't.

1970
01:30:54,213 --> 01:30:55,422
You haven't
had anything to eat

1971
01:30:55,422 --> 01:30:56,298
Since before the show.

1972
01:30:56,298 --> 01:30:57,162
I'll give you a little.

1973
01:30:57,162 --> 01:30:58,911
I don't want a lobster.
I want a man!

1974
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:01,158
I need a man tonight-
Here, right now.

1975
01:31:01,464 --> 01:31:03,598
A man? Do you want
to lift something?

1976
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:04,794
Carl's outside.

1977
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:08,053
Carl's not very big,
but he's very strong.

1978
01:31:08,406 --> 01:31:09,172
You'd be surprised.

1979
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,315
Carl?

1980
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,716
Shall I ask him
to come in?

1981
01:31:11,992 --> 01:31:13,086
Yes. We'll audition him.

1982
01:31:14,549 --> 01:31:15,312
Carl?

1983
01:31:16,281 --> 01:31:17,039
Carl, come in here.

1984
01:31:17,749 --> 01:31:19,857
You want me?

1985
01:31:19,857 --> 01:31:20,610
Come over here.
Stand there.

1986
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:22,384
What do you
want him for?

1987
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,440
Of course
he knows you. Still...

1988
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:26,004
turn the lights off.

1989
01:31:27,705 --> 01:31:28,860
It will only be
for a few seconds.

1990
01:31:30,387 --> 01:31:31,266
Walk around, Carl.

1991
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:33,224
Walk.

1992
01:31:33,548 --> 01:31:34,057
Where?

1993
01:31:34,057 --> 01:31:34,866
Over there.

1994
01:31:34,866 --> 01:31:36,161
Up and down.
Can't you just walk?

1995
01:31:37,487 --> 01:31:39,823
Does Carl have a nice dressing
gown or robe or something?

1996
01:31:39,823 --> 01:31:41,604
Yes, he has. The one you
gave him last Christmas.

1997
01:31:41,854 --> 01:31:42,929
Oh, yes.
Bring that.

1998
01:31:45,113 --> 01:31:46,245
You can stop
walking now, Carl.

1999
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:48,437
Take your
glasses off.

2000
01:31:51,197 --> 01:31:51,845
Put them down.

2001
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:57,787
Don't you see well
without your glasses?

2002
01:31:59,711 --> 01:32:00,950
Not small things,
miss Kalman.

2003
01:32:02,306 --> 01:32:02,896
Oh.

2004
01:32:03,397 --> 01:32:04,177
Give it to him.

2005
01:32:06,394 --> 01:32:07,094
Walk some more.

2006
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,810
I'm thinking of playing a
practical joke on a friend of mine,

2007
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:11,988
And I wonder if
you care to help.

2008
01:32:11,988 --> 01:32:13,123
Certainly, he will.

2009
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,248
Practical joke?

2010
01:32:14,523 --> 01:32:15,306
Yes.

2011
01:32:15,549 --> 01:32:16,414
Will anybody be hurt?

2012
01:32:16,858 --> 01:32:17,815
Not physically.

2013
01:32:18,244 --> 01:32:18,913
It's none
of your business.

2014
01:32:19,343 --> 01:32:20,276
I only asked 'cause
I'm the one who-

2015
01:32:21,139 --> 01:32:21,874
What do you
want him to do?

2016
01:32:21,874 --> 01:32:24,090
Exactly at midnight, I
want him to open that door

2017
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:26,075
And let Mr. Adams see
you just for one second,

2018
01:32:26,075 --> 01:32:27,977
Then jump back into the room
and close the door behind you.

2019
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:29,349
Mr. Adams?

2020
01:32:29,789 --> 01:32:30,895
That's who we're
playing the joke on.

2021
01:32:32,085 --> 01:32:34,531
I wouldn't want
to spoil it for you.

2022
01:32:34,531 --> 01:32:35,916
I don't think
I could do it well.

2023
01:32:36,374 --> 01:32:37,960
But there's no danger,
if that's your concern.

2024
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:39,711
I've seen many plays
in my time,

2025
01:32:39,711 --> 01:32:42,568
And jealous lovers
always have a knife or gun

2026
01:32:42,862 --> 01:32:44,347
Or the poker
from the fireplace.

2027
01:32:45,223 --> 01:32:46,821
Anyway, somebody's always
lying on the floor.

2028
01:32:48,036 --> 01:32:49,201
Carl, you're a coward.

2029
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,474
That's true. All my life,
I've been a coward.

2030
01:32:51,474 --> 01:32:52,974
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

2031
01:32:52,974 --> 01:32:53,981
I am ashamed.

2032
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:55,255
Mr. Adams
won't harm you.

2033
01:32:55,255 --> 01:32:56,625
You can lock the door behind you.

2034
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:57,860
And hide
under the bed.

2035
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:02,308
Why am I wasting
everybody's time?

2036
01:33:02,735 --> 01:33:03,516
Oh, thank you,
Carl.

2037
01:33:03,516 --> 01:33:04,549
But I'm going
to lock the door.

2038
01:33:05,326 --> 01:33:06,140
What did you
want me to do?

2039
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:08,667
All you have to do is
to listen for the chimes

2040
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,051
And come out
on the 12th chime.

2041
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:11,129
Just step out. One step. That's enough.

2042
01:33:11,129 --> 01:33:12,967
Step back
and close the door.

2043
01:33:13,586 --> 01:33:14,398
And lock it.

2044
01:33:14,398 --> 01:33:16,129
The important thing
is to count the chimes

2045
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,098
And come out
on the last one.

2046
01:33:19,977 --> 01:33:20,967
Maybe we ought
to have a rehearsal.

2047
01:33:21,442 --> 01:33:23,331
What's the matter with you?
Can't you count to 12?

2048
01:33:23,576 --> 01:33:24,617
I can count fine,

2049
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,783
But this stepping out and
stepping back, it has to be right.

2050
01:33:27,155 --> 01:33:27,952
Yes, we need a rehearsal.
What time is it?

2051
01:33:29,056 --> 01:33:30,007
18 minutes to 12:00.

2052
01:33:30,467 --> 01:33:31,676
You get in there and
listen for the chimes.

2053
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:32,849
Doris will be
the chimes

2054
01:33:32,849 --> 01:33:34,545
And come out
on the 12th one.

2055
01:33:35,367 --> 01:33:36,221
Right. The 12th one.
That'll be my cue.

2056
01:33:39,508 --> 01:33:40,307
My hero.

2057
01:33:41,323 --> 01:33:42,341
All right.
Ready, Doris?

2058
01:33:44,511 --> 01:33:44,668
Begin.

2059
01:33:46,045 --> 01:33:46,675
Bong.

2060
01:33:47,947 --> 01:33:49,848
Philip, what are you doing here?

2061
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,722
He'll stand there
disappointed.

2062
01:33:51,722 --> 01:33:53,009
He'll take a moment.

2063
01:33:53,278 --> 01:33:54,647
To understand.
What he sees-

2064
01:33:55,438 --> 01:33:57,607
Supper for two,
the red roses.

2065
01:33:57,932 --> 01:33:58,813
Then he'll
look back at me.

2066
01:33:59,404 --> 01:34:00,819
I'll look at the door,
frightened.

2067
01:34:01,417 --> 01:34:02,447
I'll run to the door.

2068
01:34:03,339 --> 01:34:05,751
I'll stand in front of it,
speechless,

2069
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:07,300
Hand to my mouth.

2070
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,218
Ohh!
Bong.

2071
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:12,761
What can I say?

2072
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:17,027
Then I'll say I'm sorry
he had to find out.

2073
01:34:17,293 --> 01:34:18,839
I'm sorry it had
to end this way.

2074
01:34:19,261 --> 01:34:20,304
Then I'll
open the package,

2075
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,299
And I'll say...

2076
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:24,655
this is a beautiful
bracelet.

2077
01:34:24,655 --> 01:34:25,865
I hope
you can return it.

2078
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:27,362
It is a beautiful
bracelet.

2079
01:34:28,343 --> 01:34:29,802
Oh, it is.

2080
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:32,366
The one thing you
can't call him is cheap,

2081
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,580
But you can call him
everything else.

2082
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:34,950
Maybe he
won't take it back.

2083
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:37,971
How was I?

2084
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,040
You were fine, Carl.

2085
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,099
You'll steal
all the notices.

2086
01:34:40,099 --> 01:34:42,018
What time is it? Put
the food on the plates.

2087
01:34:42,395 --> 01:34:43,569
Go back in the room and do
it just the way you did it.

2088
01:34:43,569 --> 01:34:46,183
I'm a little bit
nervous.

2089
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:47,688
Oh, stop it, Carl.
Go on.

2090
01:34:49,529 --> 01:34:50,320
All right, Doris.

2091
01:34:52,009 --> 01:34:52,887
I'll be listening.

2092
01:35:00,553 --> 01:35:02,119
Philip, what
are you doing here?

2093
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:04,299
What can I say?

2094
01:35:04,674 --> 01:35:05,371
I'm sorry.

2095
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:12,336
Philip.

2096
01:35:12,336 --> 01:35:13,366
Happy birthday,
darling.

2097
01:35:13,366 --> 01:35:14,677
What are you
doing here?

2098
01:35:14,677 --> 01:35:15,954
Why aren't you
at the fireplace?

2099
01:35:16,728 --> 01:35:17,697
What can I say?

2100
01:35:17,697 --> 01:35:19,229
Don't say anything.
Just listen to me.

2101
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:20,890
I have the most
astonishing news.

2102
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,500
Darling,
we can be married!

2103
01:35:23,647 --> 01:35:24,901
I've just had word
from my wife.

2104
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:25,955
She's willing to
give me a divorce.

2105
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:28,464
She's fallen in love with a
ski instructor in Sun Valley.

2106
01:35:28,803 --> 01:35:30,276
Darling,
will you marry me?

2107
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:33,044
Oh.

2108
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:34,380
What is it, darling?

2109
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:37,816
Oh.

2110
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:41,071
Uh...

2111
01:35:41,863 --> 01:35:42,863
what...

2112
01:35:42,863 --> 01:35:43,943
who is that?

2113
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:45,978
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

2114
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:47,497
Calm down.

2115
01:35:47,837 --> 01:35:48,601
Now, who is that?

2116
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:50,081
Oh, Philip.

2117
01:35:50,374 --> 01:35:52,336
Well, I knew you were
going to say that.

2118
01:35:53,112 --> 01:35:54,048
Who is that?

2119
01:35:54,637 --> 01:35:55,946
It's of
no importance now.

2120
01:35:56,214 --> 01:35:57,806
It's important to me.
Now, who is it?

2121
01:35:57,806 --> 01:35:59,159
That's Carl, dear.

2122
01:35:59,558 --> 01:36:01,822
Carl? In a bathrobe
in your bedroom?

2123
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:03,760
That's David.

2124
01:36:04,084 --> 01:36:05,145
Oh, what am I
going to say?

2125
01:36:05,417 --> 01:36:06,657
I don't know.
I'd like to hear it.

2126
01:36:06,657 --> 01:36:07,536
What are you
going to say?

2127
01:36:07,536 --> 01:36:08,520
Well, I know what
I was going to say.

2128
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,106
I was going to take
this bracelet and say,

2129
01:36:10,106 --> 01:36:12,329
"This is a beautiful bracelet.
I hope you can return it."

2130
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:13,843
Don't you understand?

2131
01:36:14,426 --> 01:36:15,500
No, I don't understand.

2132
01:36:16,174 --> 01:36:18,193
And to think I actually
proposed marriage.

2133
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,557
Marriage.

2134
01:36:20,177 --> 01:36:20,849
But, Philip...

2135
01:36:21,351 --> 01:36:22,570
but you don't
understand at all.

2136
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,797
Oh, miss Kalman, it didn't
go very well, did it?

2137
01:36:29,347 --> 01:36:31,077
There was nothing
I could do. Nothing.

2138
01:36:31,569 --> 01:36:32,991
There was nothing
anybody could do.

2139
01:36:33,357 --> 01:36:34,040
How was I?

2140
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:35,036
Oh, shut up, Carl.

2141
01:36:35,036 --> 01:36:36,452
How was I?
Somebody tell me.

2142
01:36:36,452 --> 01:36:37,422
Please, Carl.

2143
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:39,460
Miss Kalman, maybe if
you told him truth...

2144
01:36:39,749 --> 01:36:41,393
I did tell him the truth,
and he wouldn't believe me.

2145
01:36:42,549 --> 01:36:43,373
Oh, it is all over.

2146
01:36:43,771 --> 01:36:45,007
Did I spoil something?

2147
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:47,010
No, not you, Carl.
I did...

2148
01:36:47,537 --> 01:36:48,527
with my little hatchet.

2149
01:36:48,871 --> 01:36:50,613
I can go to him and
explain the whole thing.

2150
01:36:50,613 --> 01:36:51,777
Maybe he'll
believe me.

2151
01:36:52,017 --> 01:36:52,876
Did something go wrong?

2152
01:36:53,191 --> 01:36:54,280
Nothing much.
A small thing-

2153
01:36:55,079 --> 01:36:56,248
My life,
that's all.

2154
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:08,570
I don't want
this bracelet.

2155
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:09,466
It's yours.

2156
01:37:09,858 --> 01:37:10,709
This wasn't a gift.

2157
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:12,497
Consider it
as payment.

2158
01:37:12,932 --> 01:37:14,272
And while
you are there,

2159
01:37:14,272 --> 01:37:15,558
Will you please give
a message to my rival.

2160
01:37:16,094 --> 01:37:17,027
Tell him
I'm indebted to him.

2161
01:37:17,334 --> 01:37:19,180
I can think of no man to
whom I'm more indebted.

2162
01:37:19,426 --> 01:37:21,333
Wait a minute. You
can tell him yourself.

2163
01:37:21,965 --> 01:37:23,351
Come out.
It's all right.

2164
01:37:27,519 --> 01:37:28,269
Why, it's Carl.

2165
01:37:29,826 --> 01:37:30,625
I didn't do anything.

2166
01:37:31,525 --> 01:37:32,309
They made me do it.

2167
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:39,120
Well, that was a cheap
and shoddy thing to do.

2168
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,445
I didn't start being
cheap and shoddy.

2169
01:37:42,084 --> 01:37:43,877
It didn't become you. It
didn't become our relationship.

2170
01:37:44,265 --> 01:37:45,812
What was our relationship, may I ask?

2171
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:47,435
Something fine
and spiritual.

2172
01:37:47,435 --> 01:37:49,284
On whose part?
On my part!

2173
01:37:49,284 --> 01:37:50,969
I contributed to the fine and spiritual.

2174
01:37:51,213 --> 01:37:52,430
You lied
and cheated.

2175
01:37:52,672 --> 01:37:54,089
You're not married.
You're dishonest.

2176
01:37:54,089 --> 01:37:56,581
I was honorable.
I stuck to the rules.

2177
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,683
You're not going to
bring up the rules again.

2178
01:37:58,942 --> 01:38:00,410
What can man go by
but rules?

2179
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:02,627
When you found out
I wasn't married,

2180
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:03,707
You shouldn't have
done anything about it.

2181
01:38:03,707 --> 01:38:04,829
That's what a clever woman
would've done.

2182
01:38:04,829 --> 01:38:06,380
I'd had come around
to marrying you.

2183
01:38:06,602 --> 01:38:07,828
You notice I did.

2184
01:38:07,828 --> 01:38:09,493
You wouldn't have if I
hadn't made you jealous,

2185
01:38:09,493 --> 01:38:10,815
Not in
a thousand years.

2186
01:38:10,815 --> 01:38:13,136
I might've proposed a little
later, but it was inevitable.

2187
01:38:13,608 --> 01:38:14,443
No, it's not true.

2188
01:38:15,077 --> 01:38:17,748
What's inevitable is that we
are fated not to be married.

2189
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:20,293
We had the chance for a
moment, and we lost it.

2190
01:38:21,498 --> 01:38:23,440
It's too bad, too, because
I love you very much,

2191
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,900
And we could've
been very happy.

2192
01:38:25,297 --> 01:38:26,341
We can still be happy.

2193
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:27,881
I wonder.

2194
01:38:29,257 --> 01:38:30,732
Well, I suppose
any happiness

2195
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:31,732
Is difficult
enough to find.

2196
01:38:34,332 --> 01:38:36,389
It's not too becoming
from a woman, but...

2197
01:38:36,686 --> 01:38:37,786
we are hardly strangers,

2198
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,210
And knowing
your passion for rules,

2199
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:40,447
I'll make
the proposition.

2200
01:38:41,341 --> 01:38:42,688
If you're willing,
I'm willing.

2201
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:44,748
The last two days
never happened.

2202
01:38:45,611 --> 01:38:46,538
What do you mean?

2203
01:38:46,989 --> 01:38:48,368
I mean we'll go on
as before.

2204
01:38:50,025 --> 01:38:51,444
And not be married?

2205
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:52,536
That's right.

2206
01:38:53,282 --> 01:38:55,122
That's the most improper
thing I've ever heard.

2207
01:38:55,546 --> 01:38:56,484
What?

2208
01:38:56,484 --> 01:38:57,974
I can hardly
believe my ears.

2209
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,190
What are you
so shocked about?

2210
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:01,542
I didn't think
you were capable of it.

2211
01:39:02,232 --> 01:39:03,185
Well, what is different?

2212
01:39:03,185 --> 01:39:04,736
We're not married.

2213
01:39:04,736 --> 01:39:06,140
We weren't before.

2214
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,755
But you didn't know
I wasn't married.

2215
01:39:07,755 --> 01:39:08,670
You knew.

2216
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:09,851
I knew you didn't know.

2217
01:39:10,233 --> 01:39:11,156
What's the matter
with you?

2218
01:39:12,173 --> 01:39:13,517
How could you ask me
to do such a thing?

2219
01:39:13,517 --> 01:39:15,310
Haven't you been following
what I've been saying?

2220
01:39:16,598 --> 01:39:18,291
Oh, I tell you, women
are not the sensitive sex.

2221
01:39:18,559 --> 01:39:20,072
That's one of the great
delusions of literature.

2222
01:39:20,072 --> 01:39:21,638
Men are
the true romanticists.

2223
01:39:22,234 --> 01:39:22,975
I'd-

2224
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:29,798
What are you
crying about?

2225
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:31,262
Oh, shut up, Philip.

2226
01:39:31,587 --> 01:39:33,236
Don't cry, Anna.
I love you.

2227
01:39:33,236 --> 01:39:34,323
Everything
will be all right.

2228
01:39:35,383 --> 01:39:36,801
You'll like
being married.

2229
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:38,289
You will.
You'll see.

2230
01:39:38,828 --> 01:39:40,257
Yes.
