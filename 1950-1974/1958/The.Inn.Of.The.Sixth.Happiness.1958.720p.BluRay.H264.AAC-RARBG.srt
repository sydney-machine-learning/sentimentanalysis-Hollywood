1
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,056
My name is Gladys Aylward.

2
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,559
I've written to
the head of the missionary society.

3
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,021
His reply stated that he'd see me
if I ever came to London.

4
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,066
-If he's busy, I can wait.
-Just one moment, please.

5
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,360
Sit down, won't you?

6
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,743
Dr. Robinson will see you now,
Miss Aylward.

7
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,297
-How nice of you to drop in so soon.
-Thank you.

8
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,133
I decided to come
after I'd received your letter.

9
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,927
I couldn't wait any longer.

10
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,096
You've severed
your connections in Liverpool?

11
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:28,100
There wasn't much to sever.
I brought everything I own with me.

12
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,769
I see.

13
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,479
Well, sit down, please.

14
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,113
Well, you are going to use me. Aren't you?

15
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,532
You are going to send me to China.

16
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,368
It's quite impossible.

17
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,787
Why?

18
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,705
Look, I'm terribly sorry about this.

19
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,626
I blame myself for not having
been more clear in my letter, but...

20
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,253
But why can't you use me?

21
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,256
To be a missionary in China today
is frightfully difficult.

22
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,008
I'm not speaking from hearsay.

23
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,721
I spend three years there
for every year I spend here at home.

24
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,224
You don't know what you'd be facing.

25
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,103
The... The filth, the squalor,
the hardships in the remote areas.

26
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,231
That doesn't frighten me. I'm strong.

27
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,066
I'm used to hard work.

28
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,694
My dear girl, don't you understand?

29
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,196
You're just not qualified.

30
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,615
We send to China only those of our people

31
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,202
who have very special
education and experience.

32
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,706
I know. I've had a very ordinary schooling.

33
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,209
And since then I've been a servant, but...

34
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,129
But I've read. I've studied by myself.

35
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,297
I've worked at
the Liverpool Mission on my days off.

36
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,717
I understood that from your letters.

37
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,218
And I do understand

38
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,221
the strong call you feel for China, but...

39
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,181
But it isn't enough?

40
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,269
Thank you anyway.

41
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,523
Have you any plans?

42
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,650
N... No.

43
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,152
Well, forgive me

44
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,696
but are you all right for money?

45
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,072
Oh, I'll get a job.

46
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,701
That may be difficult.
There's so much unemployment now.

47
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,703
I'll manage.

48
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,204
No, wait, please.

49
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,707
I may be able to help you.

50
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,710
People sometimes contact us
when they have positions.

51
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,713
Old China hands, clergymen, and so on.

52
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,216
I suppose they feel confidence
in anyone we recommend.

53
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,718
Yes, here's one.

54
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,220
Sir Francis Jameson, the explorer

55
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,347
and a good friend to China missions.

56
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:34,060
I'd be very happy to approach him for you.

57
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,354
That is, if you've had
experience as a second maid.

58
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,732
Yes. Yes, I have.

59
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,610
For that, I'm qualified.

60
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,470
Good morning.

61
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,352
What is the fare to China, please?

62
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,522
China? But where in China, miss?

63
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,525
Well, wherever I can get to the quickest.

64
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,534
Exactly £90 by boat.

65
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,119
Is that the cheapest way?

66
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,829
No, that's not the cheapest way.

67
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,290
The cheapest way is overland,
the Trans-Siberian Railroad.

68
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,210
That is only £41.

69
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,878
It's a lot, but it's better.

70
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,215
Unfortunately, it's quite impossible.

71
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,093
Look, uh, will you come over here?

72
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,427
I'll explain.

73
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,138
Look. This is the route.

74
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,681
You go from England to Holland

75
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:58,477
across Germany, Poland,
Russia, Siberia, China.

76
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,814
At best, it's a very long,
dangerous, and difficult trip.

77
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,150
But over and above that, at the moment

78
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,027
there's a situation on
the Russian-Chinese border

79
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,571
to which both parties have sent troops.

80
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,157
There's been considerable disturbance.

81
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,033
Oh, that doesn't matter.

82
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,577
But, miss, there's been shooting.

83
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,995
This may turn into a war.

84
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,539
Why would anyone bother me?

85
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,668
Miss, Milfields undertakes to deliver
its clients to their destinations,

86
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,129
usually in good health, but always alive.

87
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,840
We cannot guarantee your deliverance
to China alive,

88
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,383
not by the overland route.

89
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,094
I'm on my way to Chelsea, a mile away.

90
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,097
Who can guarantee I'll get there alive?

91
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,894
Will you book me a passage, please?

92
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,396
Very well then. For what date?

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,399
I don't know yet. I haven't got £41.

94
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,943
But I'll pay something on account

95
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,862
and come back every week and add to it.

96
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm very reliable.

97
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,531
I don't doubt it.

98
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,034
But we don't sell tickets that way.

99
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,828
Look. Couldn't you save it up

100
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,288
and then bring it in?

101
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,332
I might get discouraged.

102
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,210
If I know I own a small part of a ticket

103
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,628
it'll be easier.

104
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,673
I'll take the pennies and leave you the rest.

105
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,384
There is £1 and 5 shillings.

106
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,844
Is that all you have?

107
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,013
Isn't it enough for the first payment?

108
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,391
You can't leave yourself
with just four pennies.

109
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,685
I'm on my way to a new job.

110
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,812
But supposing you don't like the new job

111
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,814
or it just doesn't work?

112
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,316
I'll make it work.

113
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,986
Will you spell your name for me please?

114
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,529
Last name first.

115
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,228
Well, the mission don't send
flighty ones, and that's a blessing.

116
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,479
Come in.

117
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,149
You're Gladys Aylward?

118
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,567
I'm Miss Thompson, the housekeeper.

119
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,777
I expected you an hour ago.

120
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,904
-Oh, I...
-No excuses, please.

121
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,572
Are you an experienced second maid?

122
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,283
Yes, Miss Thompson. I've worked for...

123
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,286
We'll soon see.
The wages are 19 shillings a week.

124
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,955
Thursday and every second Sunday off
from 10:00 till 10:00.

125
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,416
-That'll be fine. Thank you.
-I should think so.

126
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,460
Remember, there are 50 girls
for every job in London.

127
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,337
I'll take you to your room.

128
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,350
Short of breath, are you?

129
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,394
Oh, it's just the suitcase.

130
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,987
The room's small, but it's clean.

131
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,406
Oh, it's fine. Thank you.

132
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,741
Good.

133
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,649
Now, Gladys, stop it.

134
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,860
Why make work for yourself
on your day off?

135
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,195
It was streaked.

136
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,696
With people coming in for tea

137
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,823
you would have bitten my head off.

138
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:45,829
Good morning, Sir Francis.

139
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,873
Good morning.                    

140
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,051
Was he annoyed at your being there?

141
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,260
No, I don't think so.

142
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,972
He said what he always says,
"Good morning."                    

143
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,724
I daresay you want your money.

144
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,227
And I daresay it will be spent by tonight.

145
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,230
Every penny. Every single penny.

146
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,066
With that,

147
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,276
I make the grand total

148
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,153
£24, 9 shillings.

149
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,030
That's more than half your ticket.

150
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,700
At this moment, I'm entering
the western end of Siberia.

151
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,119
Well, not quite. Tomorrow, perhaps.

152
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,829
Tomorrow I'll be halfway through it.

153
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,249
I'm cleaning a lazy woman's kitchen
this afternoon

154
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,459
and serving at a birthday party
this evening.

155
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,128
That's at least another 10 shillings.

156
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,754
And much too much work.

157
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,381
You haven't had a holiday for three months.

158
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,674
I don't need one.

159
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,592
You'll be exhausted
by the time you get there.

160
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,138
No, I'll have lots of energy left.

161
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,181
Lots left to use. Good-bye.

162
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,104
Birthday cake, Bessie,
with half a yellow rose.

163
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,356
Oh, Glad, whatever have you done?

164
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,566
What is it?

165
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,859
Take off your coat and put on your apron.

166
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,612
Sir Francis is waiting in the library.

167
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,114
Those gentlemen came to tea.

168
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,949
There was an argument about a book.

169
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,660
Walled Cities of China.

170
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,620
Sir Francis went to the shelf,
and it was gone.

171
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,705
He rang for me.

172
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,457
"Perhaps it's been borrowed," I said.

173
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,251
"I didn't lend it," he shouted.
"Search the house!"

174
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,628
There it was under your pillow,

175
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,257
a book worth £50.

176
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,676
I'm afraid this is the end, Gladys.

177
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,391
SIR FRANCIS: Come in.

178
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,027
Since you were recommended
by the missionary society

179
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,405
I assume you know the difference
between right and wrong.

180
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,824
What have you to say for yourself?

181
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,160
I... I'm... I'm sorry that you were worried

182
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,162
but I didn't damage the book.

183
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,331
I've been very careful with all of them.

184
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,375
All of them? You've done this before?

185
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,710
Yes, sir.

186
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,339
I... I have read a whole shelf on China

187
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,883
and I'm in the middle of another.

188
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,009
Did it ever occur to you

189
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,346
that you might ask
if you could borrow the books?

190
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,389
I was afraid you'd say no.

191
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,351
I had to read them. I'm going to China.

192
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,854
I have to learn all I can about it.

193
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,649
Oh, Sir Francis,
only half of my ticket is paid for.

194
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,109
If I can keep this job a little longer...

195
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,279
Stop fussing, girl. Sit down.

196
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,825
Now, what's all this
about your going to China?

197
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,578
Is the mission sending you?

198
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,790
No. No, no,
they don't think I'd be any good.

199
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,166
I'm going on my own.

200
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,835
You can't just wander
into China without a job,

201
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,463
without a destination, without money.

202
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,675
I'll have at least £5 over and above my fare.

203
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,885
-£5?
-Mmm-hmm.

204
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,137
Why? Why must it be China?

205
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,101
You... You feel where you belong

206
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,395
as if you were told.

207
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,813
For me, it's China.

208
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,983
Give up this ridiculous adolescent idea.

209
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,485
But I can help out there.

210
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,153
Help? How can you help?

211
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,447
You're not a trained nurse
or a welfare worker.

212
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,366
I want to be a missionary.

213
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,742
A missionary? You?

214
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,161
Take my advice. Stay here, my girl

215
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,872
and go on polishing the furniture.
You'll do far more good.

216
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,292
No, I won't.

217
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,501
It doesn't matter

218
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,087
why I feel God wants me to go to China.

219
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,714
The important thing is that I feel it.

220
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,591
Because I do, I'll go

221
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,635
no matter what you or anyone else can say.

222
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,972
If I can't stay here and earn the money

223
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,016
then I'll go somewhere else.

224
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,476
Oh, I see.

225
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,896
You may keep your job.

226
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,981
Thank you.

227
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,900
You're a foolish, stubborn girl

228
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,902
unquestionably heading for trouble.

229
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,696
However, I shall worry less

230
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,283
if some of the more obvious idiocy
is removed from your plans.

231
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,953
I've outlived all my missionary
friends in China, except one.

232
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,415
Jeannie Lawson,
worth any ten women I've ever known.

233
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,792
Mind you, I don't promise anything

234
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,920
but I'll drop her a line
when I have a moment.

235
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,381
She must be getting on.

236
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,384
It's possible she could do
with a strong, young helper.

237
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,054
Ah, here it is. Her last address.

238
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,681
Hmm?

239
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,861
Did you pin your passport
into your underthings?

240
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,154
If anyone wants to see it

241
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,406
they must just wait
while you go to the ladies and get it.

242
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,910
-After all, you're a British subject.
-Why, there's Mr. Murfin.

243
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,203
How kind of you to come.

244
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,205
Well, I'm interested, naturally.

245
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,499
Some shortbread. Mrs. Murfin made it.

246
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,167
Is this the Aylward expedition?

247
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,337
-Sir Francis.
-I forgot to give you this at the house.

248
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,422
It's been with me on quite a few treks.

249
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,299
You'll find it useful on cold nights.

250
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,676
Thank you, Sir Francis.

251
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,302
Miss Thompson gave me a camera

252
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,804
and Mr. Murfin some shortbread.

253
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,640
Sir Francis, Mr. Murfin
from the travel agency.

254
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,061
I'd better be putting
your luggage in, Gladys. It's time.

255
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,398
What are you planning to do,

256
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,066
trade with the natives?

257
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,403
I thought I was going to make
my own tea and save money.

258
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,155
Boil everything, I told her,
foreigners being what they are.

259
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,074
Very sensible, very English.

260
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,242
Now, remember

261
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,702
the mission at Tientsin

262
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,746
will get you in touch
with Mrs. Lawson at Yang Cheng.

263
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,457
At least you have a destination.
That's something.

264
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,042
It's more than enough.

265
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,420
I might not be leaving today
if it wasn't for you.

266
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,965
That is a thought that
gives me no peace of mind.

267
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,175
Well, off you go.

268
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,927
Are you afraid, Gladys?

269
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,971
It's not too late to back out.

270
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,723
I would, honestly.

271
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,436
Good-bye.

272
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,979
Good-bye, dear friends.

273
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,774


274
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,950
Yurga! Yurga!

275
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,493
Yurga!

276
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,873
Yurga!

277
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,834
Conductor.

278
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,919
Can't you tell me what is happening?

279
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,505
Yurga... What is Yurga?

280
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,590
Ah, angliyskyi.

281
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,366
Angliyska.

282
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,659
English spoken.

283
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,203
Oh, good. Can you tell me
what is happening?

284
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,414
We arrive to the village Yurga.

285
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,416
You must disbark.

286
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,710
No, I have a ticket to Harbin.

287
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,545
Nyet, Harbin. Yurga.

288
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,214
Harbin across border of China.

289
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,300
There is argument.

290
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,051
I'll go as far as I can.

291
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,053
Thank you just the same.

292
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,764
Ha! Angliyska.

293
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,435
English spoken with excellence, yes?

294
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,020
Yes, very.

295
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,066
Stop shouting at me.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

296
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,568
Didn't you hear
the conductor say I'm English?

297
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:22,155
-Angliyskyi... ska.
-Tovarisch commissar.

298
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,157
Oh, Tovarisch commissar.

299
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,458
You cannot stay here. You woman alone.

300
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,460
Soldier men not moral.

301
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,795
Your passport, please.

302
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,047
Passport.

303
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,423
Passport!

304
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,902
I'm on my way to China

305
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,195
but I was supposed to stop...

306
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,740
Nyet, nyet, nyet. Next station, you go out.

307
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,496
You are by profession machinery?

308
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,456
But China no machinery.

309
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,791
Why go there?

310
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,377
Here in U.S.S.R., machinery good.

311
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,422
Tractors, combine, conveyors.

312
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,589
You stay here.

313
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,383
Machinery China, pfeu!

314
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,552
I'm not that kind of machinery.

315
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,178
I'm a missionary.

316
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,932
I'm going to China
as a missionary, with a Bible.

317
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,607
Onward
Christian soldiers

318
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,776
Marching as to war

319
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,740
Yes. Yes, that's it.

320
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,866
That's it.

321
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,285
-Yes.

322
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,227
Good-bye.

323
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,370
Oh, wait a minute!

324
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,997
Come on.

325
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,505
Yang Cheng.

326
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,097
Ohh.

327
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,940
This place, Mrs. Lawson's

328
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,400


329
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,712
Are you Mrs. Lawson?

330
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,796
Yes.

331
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,881
You're Gladys Aylward.

332
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,009
Good for you.

333
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,011
I didn't think you'd make it.

334
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,220
Get down, girl.

335
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,388
You're home.

336
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,392
Ha ha!

337
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,353
Come in and see our grubby palace.

338
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,771
Oh, don't get too discouraged.

339
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,897
We'll fix it up.

340
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,357
Isn't it very big?

341
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,525
That's why I bought it.

342
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,068
It's an old inn.

343
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,320
We're going to reopen it.

344
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:39,198
You and I and Yang, my cook. 

345
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,409
That gave you a toot, didn't it?

346
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,870
You didn't come out here
to be an innkeeper.

347
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,496
You came to be a missionary

348
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,415
and teach the word.

349
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,375
Well, didn't you?

350
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,379
Gladys, I've never been
this far north in China before.

351
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,048
Very few missionaries have.

352
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:59,010
There are a few in Tsechow, Tientsin,
the big cities.

353
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,889
But there's never been one
in Yang Cheng before

354
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,767
nor any white person, chances are.

355
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,105
Thank you.

356
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,399
Good-bye.

357
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,401
Good-bye and thank you.

358
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,445
Now, people here

359
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,448
call men in the next village foreigners

360
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,949
and suspect them

361
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,993
so why should they listen to us?

362
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,079
Then how do you hope to reach them?

363
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,581
We're after something bigger.

364
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,917
The mule trains pass through here.

365
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,543
They stay the night at the inns,

366
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,337
then go on their way.

367
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,924
These muleteers
are the newspapers of north China.

368
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,759
If we can make one of them

369
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,886
listen to us and believe

370
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,056
we've reached more people
than there are in Yang Cheng.

371
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,808
Come on in.

372
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,227
It's even worse inside.

373
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,564
Why would they stay at our inn?

374
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,983
Because we're going to charge them
what the others do

375
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,402
for food and lodging

376
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,946
and offer something the others don't.

377
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,906
First, no bugs.

378
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,243
Second, stories, which the Chinese love

379
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,078
free with their dinner.

380
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,707
I've got a good one
for them to listen to and repeat.

381
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,794
Once upon a time, in a little town
called Bethlehem

382
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,421
a baby was born.

383
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,756
Oh, it's a wonderful idea.

384
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,843
Well, the mission center at Shencheng
put up the money

385
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,429
but they weren't that enthusiastic.

386
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,930
Come along in here.

387
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,683
Now there's Yang, my cook.

388
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,977
Yang, this is Miss Gladys

389
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,104
who's going to be our new helper.

390
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,106
Yang's been with me 20 years

391
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,442
and in case you should think
our work's easy

392
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,111
he still isn't a Christian.

393
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,404
He stays with me

394
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,948
because he thinks foreigners are funny.

395
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,701
Now come and see the rest.

396
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,954
Oh, why is it built this way?

397
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,205
Oh, it's a k'ang.

398
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,458
It's heated from underneath

399
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,460
like an oven.

400
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,961
A k'ang?

401
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,463
What is a k'ang for?

402
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,548
A community bed.

403
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,468
You'll find them in every inn in north China.

404
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,637
We've got lots of rooms,
but when winter comes

405
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,515
this is the bed everybody'll be in.

406
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,850
You mean together?

407
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,352
30, 40, 50 at a time

408
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,481
all fully clothed and ignoring each other.

409
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,983
It gets cold here. You'll find out.

410
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,486
Miss Lawson, I go shop now.

411
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,488
Why not go with him?

412
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,656
See what you've let yourself in for.

413
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,949
She go like that?

414
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,701
I'll get her some proper things.

415
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,496
I wait for you outside. Courtyard.

416
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,415
The merchants will start raising their prices

417
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,250
if they see you in those clothes.

418
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,336
They'll take you for a rich foreigner.

419
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,506
Rich? Ha ha! In these?

420
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,509
For people as poor as they are, yes.

421
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:48,346
My dear girl, you're in China now.

422
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,056
Yes.

423
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,933
Yes, I know.

424
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,061
Oh, my.

425
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,480
You look like a Chinese woman.

426
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,316
We go now.

427
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,615
Miss Jeannie like you.

428
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,200
You stay when she die?

429
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,576
Oh, Yang.

430
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,204
She's very old. Cannot live long.

431
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,415
It isn't nice talking about people dying.

432
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,043
You funny. Just like her.

433
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,920
Good. You stay in China.

434
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,421
I stay with you.

435
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,132
Yang, I've tried to learn
Chinese from a book.

436
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,717
Book don't know. I teach.

437
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,136
We point things, then I tell you.

438
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,304
Oh.

439
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,774
Hsien Chang.

440
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,944
Foreigner call him Mandarin.

441
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,112
He like judge.

442
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,321
Very important.

443
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,782
He say die. You die.

444
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,075
This is house where he lives.

445
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,744
Chinese call Hsien-Cheng-Fu.

446
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,414
Hsien-Cheng-Fu.

447
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,416
Are all those girls his daughters?

448
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,294
Not exactly daughters. More like wives.

449
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,005
But not exactly wives.

450
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,436
I go shop here.

451
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,770
Are you going to stay long?

452
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,105
Oh, yes. Plenty.

453
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,398
First, gossip.

454
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,567
Then he tell me how much
what I want cost.

455
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,069
I say no. I go.

456
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,030
He call me back. More argue

457
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,948
plenty long time.

458
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,534
I'll walk around a little by myself.
I'll find the way back.

459
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,662
Yes, but don't forget.
You foreign devil here.

460
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,172
Ooh. Ohh.

461
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,056
But I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean any harm.

462
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,696
Aah!

463
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,459
The man was a murderer.

464
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,628
He was tried before the Mandarin

465
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,964
proved guilty, and executed.

466
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,674
That's their law.

467
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,218
But to chop off his head...

468
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,262
I don't suppose hanging's a pretty sight

469
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,055
but that's what we do in England.

470
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,557
That's our law.

471
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,100
But it's different.

472
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,019
This is so horrible, so bloodthirsty.

473
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,479
And the way people act...

474
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,106
Those women were frightened.

475
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,066
But what about the men
in that dragon place

476
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,235
yelling and screaming at me for no reason?

477
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,862
They had a reason.

478
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,530
That dragon place, as you call it

479
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,366
was for men only.

480
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:40,119
There's much that is horrible in China

481
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,454
as in any country.

482
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,497
Babies left to die in ditches,

483
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,791
the poor preying on the poor.

484
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,420
Many things, but they'll change.

485
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,506
One thing at a time,
with the help of the Lord

486
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,635
and that's what we're here for
in this dirty room,

487
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,554
to try to help.

488
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,937
It's a hard life for a young woman

489
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,482
but it won't seem hard, I promise you.

490
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,485
When you're my age and look back

491
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,195
it'll only seem beautiful.

492
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,841
"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness."

493
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:40,304
Ah, it sounds quite Oriental, doesn't it?

494
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,806
Yes.

495
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,141
Yes, but Yang...

496
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,477
Yang says that everybody in China

497
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,146
wishes you the five happinesses.

498
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,982
Wealth, longevity, good health,

499
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,651
uh, virtue, and a...

500
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,486
And a peaceful death in old age.

501
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,863
Yes, but he didn't mention any more.

502
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,323
What is the sixth happiness?

503
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,826
That you must find out for yourself.

504
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,495
Each person decides in his own heart

505
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,747
what the sixth happiness is.

506
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,791
Come on.

507
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,421
Oh, so much still to be done.

508
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,882
The windows, the balcony, the roof...

509
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,885
Do you think we should've
waited longer to open?

510
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,512
Can't afford to.

511
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,765
I've used up all the year's
allowance from the center

512
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,225
doing what fixing we have done.

513
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,561
Can't do any more
until we make some money

514
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,479
but don't worry. We will.

515
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,607
Mule trains are passing through every day.

516
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,526
I only hope some stop here.

517
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,405
That's your job. You've got to stand outside

518
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,740
like a regular Chinese innkeeper

519
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,284
and shout to them to come in.

520
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,286
With my 20 words of Chinese.

521
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,829
Ask Yang what to shout.

522
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,080
All right.

523
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,252
Oh, Mrs. Lawson,

524
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,753
what are you doing?

525
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,922
Binding it up so the mules won't...

526
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,591
But these bales are heavy.

527
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,384
Let me do it.

528
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,304
Oh, don't bury me before I'm ready.

529
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,768
I have to holler to the mule drivers.

530
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,729
What shall I say to them?

531
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,272
Oh, I tell you.

532
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,532
We have no bugs. We have no fleas.

533
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,451
We do have stories.

534
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,494
Good. Come.

535
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,704
Now start.

536
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,896
That's the second one that passed by.

537
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,523
What shall I do now?

538
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,608
Well, get the lead mule in.

539
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,402
The rest will follow.

540
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,987
Once they start on the fodder

541
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,488
nothing will get them out.

542
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,157
But I can't drag them in, can I?

543
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,899
Whoa!

544
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:25,070
I've got mules, plenty of mules,

545
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,364
but no men.

546
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,199
Yang!

547
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,661
Yang, what does yong gwee tso mean?

548
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,289
MAN: Yong gwee tze.
That means foreign devil.

549
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,875


550
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,919
I'm delighted that you have no fleas.

551
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,255
Oh, you speak English. That's wonderful.

552
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,925
Wonderful? To an Englishman, perhaps.

553
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,761
Where is the Hsien-Cheng-Fu, please?

554
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,387
Oh, it's down the road,

555
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:54,058
but could you tell me
why the men ran away?

556
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,602
They've probably never seen
a white person before

557
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,562
especially one bent on
capturing their mules.

558
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,606
Could you tell them
there's nothing to be afraid of?

559
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,566
-Only if it's true.
-Of course it is.

560
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,444
Mrs. Lawson who owns
the inn is a missionary.

561
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,988
The most frightening kind of foreign devil.

562
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:46,026
I welcome you to Yang Cheng,
Captain Lin Nan.

563
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,028
As a government representative,

564
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,697
you honor us with a visit.

565
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,284
In the future, you will be honored

566
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,954
by other representatives, Hsien Chang.

567
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,456
China is going to be one country,

568
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,960
not a group of weak provinces
left to their own devices.

569
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,962
You're an intelligence officer, Captain,

570
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,880
according to your credentials.

571
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,634
May one ask have you come
to impart intelligence

572
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,927
or to obtain it?

573
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,971
Both.

574
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,973
Primarily, I'm here to observe.

575
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,977
The government wishes to know more
about this isolated region,

576
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,687
its terrain, its population, its problems.

577
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,188
The terrain is mountainous.

578
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,023
The population is peasant.

579
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:29,069
And the problem, as always,
is to stay alive.

580
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:31,989
Continue.

581
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,490
I'm instructed to tell you

582
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,492
that in some remote areas of China

583
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:39,413
the laws concerning taxes,
the registration of birth and death

584
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,166
and the prohibition against
the foot-binding of women

585
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,834
are not being properly enforced.

586
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,086
But foot-binding is a very old custom.

587
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,130
Some of the people will
never obey this law.

588
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,842
You must appoint a foot inspector
who will see they do.

589
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:56,013
This is part of a program
aimed at the equality of women.

590
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,765
The equality of women?

591
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,893
That is amusing.

592
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,853
The government is interested in the opinion

593
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,771
of the local officials,

594
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,690
their functions, their efficiency,

595
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,816
how they run their prisons,

596
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,776
their modes of execution

597
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,279
and their corruption or...

598
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,072
Or lack of corruption.

599
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,325
The elimination of concubines,

600
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,452
the management of government funds,

601
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,288
even their manner of dress.

602
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,957
Now, shall I make a formal protest

603
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,210
about the foot-binding law in your name?

604
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,170
I think not, Captain.

605
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,465
It is better to bend with the wind
when it blows.

606
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,720
We will have tea.

607
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,680
Mine will not be a long visit.

608
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,724
However long, it will be too short.

609
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,727
I fear you will find us very backward.

610
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,522
Our district is isolated from this world.

611
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,694
Not so isolated that the missionaries
haven't found you.

612
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,489
My mule train was waylaid
at an inn they run.

613
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,992
So you don't object
to foreigners in your city.

614
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,953
What is a foreigner, Captain?

615
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,122
How would you describe yourself?

616
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,417
My heart and my mind are Chinese.

617
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,711
Only my blood is mixed.

618
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,964
If I have offended a guest in my house

619
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,925
I shall not forgive myself.

620
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,427
It's my own mixed blood which offends me

621
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,430
since I believe China
should be for the Chinese.

622
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,432
I cannot speak for all China,

623
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,935
just for this one district.

624
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,937
Poor and weak as it is,

625
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,607
I'm confident it can survive many things.

626
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,527
New laws, no concubines,

627
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,030
even two eccentric Englishwomen.

628
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:56,383
Oh, Mrs. Lawson.

629
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,969
Oh, really.

630
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,849
All right. I lifted a pot.

631
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,892
And a bale of hay this afternoon.

632
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,729
And tomorrow I may move all the furniture

633
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,188
or start on the balconies

634
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,524
and you're my helper, not my nurse.

635
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,527
But I can't help with the real work.

636
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,363
I can't go in there
and tell stories in Chinese.

637
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,157
But I can free you for what is important.

638
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,326
And if you won't let me,
I don't know why I'm here.

639
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,870
You're here because I need you.

640
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,958
Oh, and I'm a dreadful old woman.

641
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,419
It isn't every day of the week I'd admit it.

642
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,338
They eat like starved.

643
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,714
Must like food.

644
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:39,468
Now all they've got to do is like the stories.

645
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,054
Pray. That's an order.

646
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,950
Tsai Bethlehem Jesus...

647
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,536


648
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,845
Are they listening? I can't tell.

649
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,892
Mandarin servant from Hsien-Cheng-Fu.

650
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,477
What do you think he wants?

651
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,437
Maybe he make us close down.

652
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:36,024
Maybe this last supper like Bible say.

653
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,704
Not to worry.

654
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,289
He want chief mule driver

655
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,458
get baggage for important person.

656
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,335
Guest at Hsien-Cheng-Fu.

657
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,027
He say let important person wait.

658
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,113
He want to hear end of story.

659
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,783
He does? Oh, Yang,
then they all have been listening.

660
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:27,909
Shh!

661
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,677


662
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,888
Aah!

663
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,515
Oh!

664
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:57,981
Mrs. Lawson!

665
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,942
Get a doctor, quickly!

666
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,657
They will stone anyone who goes
into the mountain villages

667
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,160
and orders the women's feet unbound.

668
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,163
No one wants the position
of foot inspector.

669
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,374
I have approached every likely candidate.

670
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,251
It's my impression that in other matters

671
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,420
you command rather than approach.

672
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,423
-In your own interest, I would like you...

673
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,763
Hsien Chang, are you well?

674
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,681
Yes, I am well.

675
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,058
Who are you?

676
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,936
I am the servant of the foreign women.

677
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,188
The old one has fallen from a great height.

678
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,607
Hsien Chang, please, your doctor...

679
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,526
My doctor?

680
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,027
Would you like me to go with him

681
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,404
because of the language problem?

682
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,075
Ahh, perhaps it would be better.

683
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,411
Two women in a strange land.

684
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:54,913
Get the doctor.

685
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,880
                                                                    Yea, though I walk
through the valley

686
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,216
of the shadow of death.

687
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,928
I shall fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

688
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,807
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

689
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,646
Thou preparest a table before me.

690
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,174


691
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,768
Good. In one week you learn much.

692
00:48:58,853 --> 00:48:59,894
Oh, it's not enough.

693
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,897
It'll be ages before
I can really tell the Bible stories.

694
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,190
Not to worry.

695
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,401
Until you can, I tell.

696
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,528
Oh, yeah, and you don't believe them.

697
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,406
Don't have to. Good stories anyway.

698
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,907
You want to worry?

699
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,409
Worry about food.

700
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,411
Two days more, no more.

701
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,756
I knew you wanted it the moment it came.

702
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,841
Thank you. Please don't go.

703
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,772
They don't believe in the inn.

704
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:47,442
They only agreed to it reluctantly

705
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,945
"out of respect for Mrs. Lawson's
vast experience in China.

706
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,950
"Without her or a person
equally qua... Qualified,

707
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,453
"the project is hopeless.

708
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,455
"Our advice is to abandon it

709
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,958
"and come to Shencheng.

710
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,252
"In gratitude for your help
to our dear colleague,

711
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,214
"we will arrange
for your return fare to England."

712
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,174
With that money, I could open the inn.

713
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,676
Why don't they give it to me?

714
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,929
They gave their reasons.

715
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,972
Yes.

716
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,475
One reason. Always the same one.

717
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,978
I'm not qualified.

718
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,855
I was a servant in England.

719
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,484
That's what they mean,

720
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,861
but I came here when they said I couldn't

721
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,321
and I'll stay here

722
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:35,365
though they say I can't.

723
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,662
I'm going back
to Shencheng in the morning.

724
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,998
I'll be glad to see that you get there safely.

725
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,209
I'm not going to leave.

726
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,047
You are angry and disappointed.

727
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,507
That's understandable.

728
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,009
But you must be realistic.

729
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,469
You cannot stay.

730
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,055
I'll go to the food merchants. I'll beg them.

731
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,057
They will not give you credit.

732
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,351
You will not be able to open the inn.

733
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:06,479
You have no friends, no money.

734
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,481
You don't know the language.

735
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,484
We're in the most isolated
part of the country

736
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,987
entering a period of violent conflicts

737
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,488
from within and without.

738
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,990
It isn't your country.

739
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,908
It isn't your problem.

740
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,995
You're white.
You shouldn't be in China at all.

741
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,914
How can you say that
when you're part white?

742
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,041
I'm half white.

743
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:31,004
In your world, I can only
be a second-class citizen.

744
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,006
I chose China

745
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,134
because here I'm allowed to be of value.

746
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,097
That's why I came here. To be of value.

747
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,599
How?

748
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,809
By trying to make people believe
what you believe?

749
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,061
By saving souls
who don't want to be saved?

750
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,480
Who will agree to anything

751
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,106
for an extra bowl of rice

752
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,566
and laugh at you once it is eaten?

753
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,695
To argue about such things
is to argue about shadows.

754
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,113
The dangers that confront you,

755
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:58,948
those are real.

756
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,451
Leave now while you still can.

757
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,454
Go back to England where you belong.

758
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,664
If I feel that God wants me in China,

759
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,666
then this is where I belong.

760
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,462
In that case,

761
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,964
I'll leave you in His hands.

762
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,467
Obviously, you don't need my help.

763
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,345
Captain Lin, I...

764
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,764
I know you think I'm stubborn,

765
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,390
but I'm not ungrateful.

766
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:27,894
For you to be concerned, to bother,

767
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,395
it is very kind.

768
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,481
If I were really kind,

769
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,484
I'd have you ordered out of Yang Cheng,

770
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,988
but since I'm not obsessed
with saving souls or lives,

771
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,825
I wish you well.

772
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,005
A pleasant journey, a swift return.

773
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,423
You honor me, Hsien Chang.

774
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,551
I am told that you are not able

775
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,304
to persuade the foreign woman to leave.

776
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,431
She's a very foolish young woman.

777
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:09,435
Clearly, if she closed
her ears to your advice.

778
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,813
When she goes,
it would be an act of charity

779
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,481
to help her, Hsien Chang.

780
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:15,358
If that is your wish.

781
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,277
It seems possible, however,

782
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,279
that she will not go.

783
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,323
She'll go. They all go,

784
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,826
the outsiders, the do-gooders in time.

785
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,829
How I envy the young men of China.

786
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,832
How I regret I was born too soon

787
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,959
to be so sure of everything.

788
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,252
And how I regret

789
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:36,963
I cannot report to my superiors

790
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,506
that the law against foot-binding

791
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:39,841
is being fully enforced

792
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,384
in the district of Yang Cheng.

793
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,219
It is being enforced.

794
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:45,221
In the city itself, perhaps,

795
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,141
but not in the outlying villages,
Hsien Chang.

796
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,976
Nor can it be.

797
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,979
That is my first foot inspector.

798
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,480
Numbers two and three

799
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,900
are not yet able to leave their beds.

800
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:00,153
My superiors will probably
understand your difficulties,

801
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,281
but since they will certainly
reduce your income

802
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,949
till their orders are obeyed,

803
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:08,161
I would appoint number four if I were you,

804
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,164
and if necessary, five and six and so on.

805
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,665
Whom shall I appoint?

806
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,709
Those men who are not
frightened of the job

807
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,127
are disgusted by it.

808
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:21,007
They say it's not men's work
to inspect the feet of women.

809
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,508
Then appoint a woman.

810
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,510
It's an interesting problem, Hsien Chang.

811
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:28,556
I shall be happy to hear you have solved it.

812
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,477
Then be happy, Captain.

813
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,437
I've just solved it.

814
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,857
I'm delighted.

815
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,860
How kind of you to rejoice for me.

816
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:03,466
Mandarin say,
Captain Lin ask him to help you

817
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,010
so he offer you job on his staff.

818
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,929
Foot inspector.

819
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,224
-Foot inspector?

820
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,476


821
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,521
Foot inspector will tour district.

822
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,899
See people no more bind feet
of female children

823
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,401
to make small.

824
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,611
If female under 30, unbind.

825
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:26,406
Well, I certainly approve of that,

826
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,366
yet I suppose you can go with me

827
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,660
until I can speak more Chinese.

828
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,662
But will the people listen to us?

829
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,165
He send soldiers, make listen.

830
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,919
Ask him how much I'll get for it.

831
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,256


832
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,386
What did he say?

833
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,679
Well, he said

834
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,181
maybe you worth something, maybe not.

835
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:55,184
When you come back
from first village and report

836
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,394
Mandarin tell you.

837
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,230
-                                                         
-Decide fast, he said.

838
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,940
He does not need you.

839
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,692
He make this offer to be kind.

840
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,737
It is kind of him and the captain.

841
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,322
Yes, it is, Yang.

842
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,450
And if it pays enough to start the inn

843
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,035
I have to take it.

844
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,037
Tell him yes and thank him.

845
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,581


846
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,291
Tell them it is not a bad law.
It is a good law.

847
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,210
Tell the women I am speaking to them.

848
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,712
This law is for them and their children.

849
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,423
It is wrong for them
to hobble on crippled feet.

850
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,342


851
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,018
If the Mandarin knew that
the people felt this way about the law,

852
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,394
why didn't he warn me?

853
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,896
He need foot inspector.

854
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,191
If anything happens to you,
what does he lose?

855
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,238
Is there not one mother...

856
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:32,406
Is there not one mother in Peh-Chu

857
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,575
that loves her little girl enough

858
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,452
to let me unbind her feet?

859
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:51,384


860
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,848
Old person say unbind her feet.

861
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,517
No! No! The pain would kill her.

862
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,894
She couldn't walk.
Her feet have been bound too long.

863
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,856
Tell her the law is for
the children and young women.

864
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:11,654


865
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,369
She says, unbind her feet.

866
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,371
Let the young women see

867
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,040
that she cares more
for their children than they do.

868
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,918
Do it or she will do it herself.

869
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,450
No, I can't. I can't do it.

870
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,493
Oh.

871
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,883
She say, unbind her child's feet.

872
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,220
There. That is good.

873
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,931
Don't be frightened. It won't take long.

874
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,892
If God wanted girls to have
stubby, horrid feet,

875
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,894
He would've made them that way.

876
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,606
What use? The father will
order them bound again.

877
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:35,947
Look at her feet!

878
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,240
Look at them.

879
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,574
Take these.

880
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,451
If you want her feet bound again,

881
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,994
you bind them.

882
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,204
You listen to her scream.

883
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,705
Not a woman, you.

884
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,832


885
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,645
Yang, what is happening? What is it?

886
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,729
I don't know.

887
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,857
Maybe the women have their feet unbound.

888
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,028


889
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,705
Mandarin is pleased with his new servant.

890
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:26,956
She has done well.

891
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,876
As reward, he make you
official foot inspector.

892
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,379
You will also carry messages for him

893
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,880
to the far villages

894
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,174
and stop foot-binding everywhere.

895
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,343
Besides all this honor,

896
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:41,554
he give you a horse for your journeys

897
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,347
and one yuan a month pay.

898
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,975
I'm not staying in Yang Cheng
to be his foot inspector.

899
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,644
I've got to run the inn.

900
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,814
I want credit arranged
with the food merchants.

901
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,026
And when I take
his messages to the people,

902
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:59,030
I am also going to tell them
of my own beliefs.

903
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,866
It's only with honesty
that I can take this job,

904
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,368
though it was not with honesty or kindness

905
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:07,163
-that he offered it to me.
-                                                         

906
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:21,427


907
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,900
Mandarin agree to what you ask

908
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,151
and forgive you

909
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:40,112
for the way you speak to him this time.

910
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,823
In a world full of frightened people,

911
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,326
he likes courage wherever he find it,

912
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,330
even in a rude and angry woman.

913
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,297
I am the Mandarin's servant.

914
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:15,856
These were the years
of endless work and contentment.

915
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,859
Soon every muleteer

916
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,861
who traveled the old trade routes

917
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,864
knew of the Inn of the Sixth Happiness,

918
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:27,368
but my happinesses
were too many to count.

919
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,870
The happiness of being one of them,

920
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,580
of being called by my new name.

921
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,083
Jen-ai: the one who loves people.

922
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,294
Eu Eu.

923
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:40,464
Of learning to speak their language,

924
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,968
of being able to talk to the people
in the marketplace,

925
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:48,097
to my neighbors in the fields

926
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:52,476
and my friends in every village
in the mountains,

927
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,980
the happiness of watching the seasons

928
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,983
turn and change,

929
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,986
from autumn to winter,

930
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,989
from winter to spring,

931
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,992
the happiness of beginning new things

932
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,996
that every year brought a harvest
of inner happiness

933
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,001
from teaching the children
God had let me borrow.

934
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,044
Now...

935
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,464
Now we learn a song

936
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,798
that I knew when I was a little girl.

937
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,341
It goes like this.

938
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,844
This old man

939
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,388
He played one

940
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,849
-This old man
-This old man

941
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,393
-He played one
-He played one

942
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:38,230
He played knick-knack on my drum

943
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,988
MAN: Good morning, Jen-ai.

944
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:49,033
Good morning, Jen-ai.

945
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,035
Are you well, Hsien Chang?

946
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,496
I am well enough, Jen-ai.

947
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,663
Good morning, Jen-ai.

948
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,041
-Good morning.

949
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,506
How beautifully you paint, Hsien Chang.

950
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,509
It requires patience,

951
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,512
a virtue of which I have great need.

952
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,515
Have the recent emissaries
from the government annoyed you?

953
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,309
Government emissaries
I am used to these days.

954
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,312
They even want me
to wear some kind of uniform.

955
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,022
But, no, Jen-ai,

956
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,774
the source of my annoyance

957
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,192
is closer to home.

958
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,693
It is you.

959
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,034
You have attained importance
throughout the district,

960
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,036
and with good reason.

961
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,748
Your name is as well-known as my own.

962
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,375
You are loved by the people

963
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,252
even more than I am,

964
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,254
and with that I am content.

965
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:46,549
Hsien Chang should be feared and obeyed,

966
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:47,841
not loved.

967
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,843
But you are all these things.

968
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,054
Do not compliment me.

969
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,056
Do not manage me.

970
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,601
Do not be so... So Chinese, Jen-ai.

971
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,604
I am sorry, but I meant it.

972
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,107
You are loved by the people, I said,

973
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,609
but my officials, they do not love you.

974
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:08,445
Every day there is
another complaint about you.

975
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,073
The official in charge of road building

976
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,616
complains that you urge his coolies

977
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,368
to demand more money.

978
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,370
The prison warden complains

979
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,372
that you badger him with questions

980
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,249
about the welfare of the convicts.

981
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,251
In short, they tell me

982
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,087
that you are an interfering woman.

983
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,674
I probably am, Hsien Chang,

984
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,093
but you have to interfere
with what is wrong

985
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,386
if you hope to make it right.

986
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,929
That is what I tell them.

987
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,056
Of what are you guilty, I ask,

988
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,018
that you object to her interfering?

989
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,020
Then you don't object?

990
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,521
Certainly not.

991
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:45,024
Bother the officials all you wish.

992
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,150
Embarrass them,

993
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,028
ask them questions, badger them,

994
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,823
but leave the women
of my household alone.

995
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:53,949
Oh.

996
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,075
Exactly.

997
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,577
Did you not tell them

998
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,787
that no human being should be subject

999
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,497
to the will of another?

1000
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,790
And did you not tell them

1001
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:06,128
that to obey any man unquestioningly
was old-fashioned?

1002
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:10,007
And have you not been
teaching them to read?

1003
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,634
Where will it end?

1004
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,552
With your converting them?

1005
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,764
With hymns being sung
in my Hsien-Cheng-Fu?

1006
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,808
I have not tried to convert them.

1007
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,061
Why not? Why stop at that?

1008
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:25,189
I'm surprised that you've never
attempted to convert me.

1009
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,070
I may be an interfering woman,
Hsien Chang,

1010
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,572
but I am not a completely foolish one.

1011
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,116
I know when I have met my master.

1012
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,917
Hsien Chang!

1013
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,544
The chief guard of the prison
has just arrived.

1014
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,046
There is trouble.

1015
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,766
Chief guard, where is the prison warden?

1016
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,352
He's nowhere to be found in Yang Cheng.

1017
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,520
What's the trouble?

1018
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,896
The convicts are rioting.

1019
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,356
They are like madmen.

1020
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,650
Do I have your approval to shoot
them from the walls?

1021
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,695
It would be better to leave them there.

1022
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:16,115
They'll hunger in time and listen to reason.

1023
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,866
Of course, they may wreck the prison.

1024
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,078
Before the prison warden left,
he gave orders to shoot them.

1025
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,913
The convicts are under
the prison warden's charge

1026
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,874
to be cared for, not be murdered.

1027
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:30,713
Can't this man reason with them,
or is he afraid?

1028
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,924
It is unfair to goad him into danger.

1029
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,927
I would not order him
in there to die, Jen-ai.

1030
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,346
In this mood, the convicts
would kill anyone

1031
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,141
who tried to reason with them.

1032
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,268
But it is his duty to restore order,

1033
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,769
not to slaughter people.

1034
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:48,272
Let others go in. I will not.

1035
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,482
This riot is not of my making.

1036
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:51,984
I am not responsible.

1037
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,028
You're responsible for order in the prison.

1038
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,197
I've heard that you say everywhere

1039
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,950
that you have a god who
protects you from harm.

1040
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,161
Even in prison, we have heard it.

1041
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,079
Well, I have no such god.

1042
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,539
You go in.

1043
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,583
Surely, you cannot be killed.

1044
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:10,377
It is the safety of the soul

1045
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,380
that my faith promises, not of the body.

1046
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:16,133
With your permission, Hsien Chang,

1047
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:20,095
I'll go to the prison. I'll try.

1048
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:24,600
I have many convicts
but only one foot inspector.

1049
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,060
Shall I lose your services

1050
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,688
so that you may save the face
of your religion?

1051
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,232
If my religion loses face,

1052
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,693
how will my service be of value?

1053
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,517
Do not go in, Jen-ai.

1054
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,018
Admit you are afraid.

1055
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,020
Yes. I am afraid.

1056
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,064
Open the gate.

1057
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,079
My name is Jen-ai.

1058
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,622
I want to speak to you.

1059
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,707
It is Jen-ai.

1060
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,500
The one who tries to help the people.

1061
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,671
Jen-ai.

1062
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,054
Give me that ax.

1063
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,565
Go and sit against the wall

1064
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,483
and rest.

1065
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,527
You are tired.

1066
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,041
Bring the wounded...

1067
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,543
Bring the wounded into the shade.

1068
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,887
Choose the man to speak for you.

1069
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,096
-Li.
-Li.

1070
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,516
Form into a line right there.

1071
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,103
They have chosen me.

1072
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,605
Who are you?

1073
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:20,025
My name is Li.

1074
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,069
I have been inside these walls

1075
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,570
for eight years now.

1076
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:24,738
And before that?

1077
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,156
I was a teacher.

1078
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,158
How did the riots start?

1079
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,035
Because of hunger.

1080
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,162
Aren't you fed enough?

1081
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,497
Not ever enough.

1082
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,749
The warden steals our ration and sells it.

1083
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:39,169
-What do you do here all day?

1084
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:42,506
We sit or we pace

1085
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,633
or we fight.

1086
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,468
Men should have work,

1087
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,679
but to the warden, we are no longer men.

1088
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:52,474
Tell the men it will change.

1089
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,018
I will speak to the Hsien Chang.

1090
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:58,021
I promise you it will change.

1091
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,878
It has been a long time

1092
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,797
since we have tasted tea together

1093
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,049
in my humble abode.

1094
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,384
You honor me, Hsien Chang.

1095
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:28,593
Hsien Chang!

1096
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,637
We were not to be disturbed.

1097
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:32,514
I told Jen-ai you were not to be disturbed.

1098
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,809
Jen-ai has returned? Unharmed?

1099
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,979
Yes, Hsien Chang, but angry, very angry.

1100
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,733
My foot inspector.
You'll forgive an interruption?

1101
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,484
Send Jen-ai in.

1102
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,945
An exceptional name, Jen-ai,

1103
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,947
the one who loves people.

1104
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,743
In Yang Cheng, even the foot
inspector is exceptional.

1105
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,037
Hsien Chang,

1106
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,956
what I found in that prison
is a disgrace to...

1107
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:03,754
Yes, she is still here.

1108
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,465
And if I am, it's thanks to you.

1109
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,384
Well, don't you remember?

1110
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:13,388
When you left, you asked
Hsien Chang to help me.

1111
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,140
To help her leave, wasn't it?

1112
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,308
To help me leave?

1113
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,602
Ah, perhaps I misunderstood.

1114
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,104
Perhaps I misunderstood a moment ago.

1115
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:23,857
You said there were
no foreigners in Yang Cheng.

1116
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,025
Nor are there.

1117
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,276
I'm a Chinese citizen.

1118
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,071
You gave up British citizenship?

1119
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,531
I once told you that I belonged here.

1120
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,366
The government must've thought so, too,

1121
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,701
or they wouldn't have accepted me.

1122
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:37,412
So you see, Captain, you were wrong.

1123
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:39,539
Our friend is a colonel now,

1124
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:42,209
though equally wrong, of course.

1125
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,713
May I speak about the prison now?

1126
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,215
Sit down, Jen-ai.

1127
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,134
I regret to say there's been a riot.

1128
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:54,638
The riot is over,
but not the misery that caused it.

1129
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:56,640
First, the convicts have been starved.

1130
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:59,142
The warden was stealing
their food allotments.

1131
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:01,937
He will be found and severely punished.

1132
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,314
A new warden will be appointed at once

1133
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,650
but perhaps,
as the government representative,

1134
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,236
you would prefer to rule on this case?

1135
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,403
There's no need.

1136
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,156
You are doing as
the government would wish.

1137
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,242
Hsien...

1138
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,577
Hsien Chang, just as important

1139
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,829
as the men's need for food

1140
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,622
is their need for work.

1141
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,832
When I left the prison,

1142
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,458
I went to a farmer nearby.

1143
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,544
If the convicts are allowed
to work in his fields,

1144
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,004
he'll pay them with food.

1145
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,506
This would keep them active

1146
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,508
and add to their food allotment.

1147
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,009
Permission is given.

1148
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,011
One more thing, during the riot,

1149
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,763
the prison was badly damaged.

1150
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:37,931
It should be repaired.

1151
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,641
The year's funds for prison repairs

1152
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,810
has already been used.
Can more be obtained?

1153
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,689
Not at this time. Our money must go
to more important things.

1154
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,566
Well, what could be more important?

1155
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,025
A war.

1156
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,403
We're expecting a Japanese attack.

1157
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:54,030
A war?

1158
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,907
But if this should happen,

1159
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,534
why should they attack this region?

1160
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,077
We're so poor, so isolated.

1161
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:04,124
An innkeeper, foot inspector,
prison reformer,

1162
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,209
and now, a military expert.

1163
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,920
Careful, Colonel. No one is more trusted

1164
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,256
by the mountain people than Jen-ai.

1165
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,341
You need her to send your orders to them.

1166
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,802
There are new taxes,
new quotas for the army.

1167
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,555
Yes, and there's a message to them.

1168
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:19,681
When the invaders come,

1169
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,559
they're not to be met
peacefully as in the past.

1170
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,060
They're to be fought.

1171
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,562
Each man must fight.

1172
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,022
Each man must kill.

1173
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,650
I cannot take that message.

1174
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,153
To me, killing is a mortal sin.

1175
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,071
You are a citizen of China.

1176
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,073
You will obey its laws.

1177
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,242
When the laws of China

1178
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:41,828
conflict with the laws of my faith,

1179
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,830
I know which one to obey.

1180
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:53,548
Now, on the night the baby Lord Jesus

1181
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:56,718
was born in that stable in Bethlehem,

1182
01:15:56,802 --> 01:16:00,722
several came to bow down to Him

1183
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,767
and His mother, the Lady Mary.

1184
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:07,687
There were three powerful warlords

1185
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,232
known as the magi

1186
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,776
who brought many fine gifts.

1187
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,987
And still another wonderful man,

1188
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:20,283
a sea captain named Noah
came to visit Jesus.

1189
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:24,120
His ship was called Noah's ark.

1190
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:26,665
The Lord Jesus liked this Noah

1191
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,042
for he was a wise man...

1192
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,252
Ahem.

1193
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:34,297
Especially in the ways of animals

1194
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:37,550
whom he often took sailing in his ark.

1195
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:38,843
Ahem.

1196
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,303
This man Noah...

1197
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,430
Yang.

1198
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:46,851
This man Noah was born
long before the Lord Jesus,

1199
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,813
but men in those days lived to be very old

1200
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:52,148
so no one can be sure,

1201
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,650
no one at all,

1202
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,736
that Noah did not visit Jesus in that stable

1203
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:58,363
in Bethlehem.

1204
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:03,076
Ahh!

1205
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,674
May I speak with you a moment?

1206
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,051
Since you won't take the new
orders around the district,

1207
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,303
I must.

1208
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:23,305
Do you object to my traveling with you

1209
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,806
on your next tour?

1210
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,932
No.

1211
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:28,393
And to introduce me to the village elders?

1212
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,978
I'm leaving tomorrow morning

1213
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,563
as soon as it's light,

1214
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,399
but I have to stop at the prison first

1215
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:35,900
if that is convenient.

1216
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,527
Perfectly. I'll meet you here.

1217
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,488
I... I remembered you as a friend.

1218
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,158
I know we think differently
about things, but...

1219
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:46,828
But I can't understand
why you were so hostile

1220
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,456
at the Hsien-Cheng-Fu.

1221
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,958
I'm not hostile to you personally.

1222
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:53,918
I have few personal feelings.

1223
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,054
With the Hsien Chang's approval,

1224
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:06,473
your new prison warden gives you leave

1225
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:09,476
to plant the little field outside the wall

1226
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,727
for your own use.

1227
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,021
It isn't much, but it is a beginning.

1228
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,404
We thank you, Jen-ai.

1229
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:22,989
We are grateful.

1230
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:36,086
Surely that was a great opportunity
for making converts.

1231
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,254
Aren't you neglecting
your missionary work?

1232
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:39,672
Is that what you think it is?

1233
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:40,799
Collecting converts,

1234
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,343
the way a child collects pretty stones?

1235
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,053
Is it anything else?

1236
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:49,391
To me, it's making each man
know that he counts

1237
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,851
whether he believes in Christ or Buddha

1238
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:53,353
or nothing, Colonel, like you.

1239
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,605
I believe in China as it can be.

1240
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,857
I love China the way it is.

1241
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,359
Filthy, ignorant, backwards?

1242
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,028
No, but if your house is dirty,

1243
01:19:02,113 --> 01:19:03,530
you can clean it.

1244
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:05,031
One can make improvements

1245
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:07,617
even in small corners, like this prison.

1246
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:09,953
If enemies plan to burn your house,

1247
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,956
is it time to clean or to fight?

1248
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:16,084
The village elder tells me

1249
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,920
that except for those citizens
under five years old,

1250
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:21,548
you all know every word in the first reader

1251
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,383
so here's the second one

1252
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,884
and it's much harder.

1253
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,721
And I'll tell the Hsien Chang

1254
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:32,392
that in Peh-Chu all the toes can wiggle

1255
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,227
and everyone can read.

1256
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,647
Now, that finishes my business.

1257
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,024
Colonel Lin, an officer in our army

1258
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,609
will now talk to you.

1259
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,031
I bring bad news

1260
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:50,160
and orders that mean hardship.

1261
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,828
The government believes that our country

1262
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,705
will soon be attacked by the Japanese.

1263
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,000
Because this may well start here

1264
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:59,502
in the north, this concerns you.

1265
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:00,962
They will not bother us.

1266
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,797
This is a small, poor village.

1267
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:05,967
This is a small, poor finger.

1268
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,344
It must do its part if I'm attacked

1269
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:11,306
or it will become a small, dead finger.

1270
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,850
A large army is being trained to defend you.

1271
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,351
To maintain it,

1272
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,396
you must give half your grain and livestock.

1273
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:24,861
All men must register for the army.

1274
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,529
Many will be taken,

1275
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:30,742
but those at home must fight, too.

1276
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,703
They will kill the enemy if they can.

1277
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,664
Burn the crops that might feed him.

1278
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:39,167
And plant again when he's gone.

1279
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,753
Read the orders.

1280
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,797
Jen-ai, must we obey this man?

1281
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,050
It's not for me to tell you

1282
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:49,344
what you should obey or not obey

1283
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,678
but you must listen.

1284
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,473
The colonel speaks for the government.

1285
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:02,190
You mustn't mind.

1286
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,109
They are just terribly suspicious
of foreigners.

1287
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,476
At the four villages we visited,

1288
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,103
has anyone listened to me?

1289
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:41,980
They've listened.

1290
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,731
They'll fight.

1291
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:47,193
People are always ready to fight.

1292
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,195
I appreciate your not trying

1293
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,697
to influence them differently.

1294
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:55,410
My conscience is my own affair

1295
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,453
and theirs is theirs

1296
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,038
and yours is yours.

1297
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,887
Hoka! Hoka!

1298
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,015
Three days we wait for you, Jen-ai.

1299
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,516
A fine greeting.

1300
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:21,394
And now look what you bring. Let him go.

1301
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,146
Why not the police, huh?

1302
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,355
Come on.

1303
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,535
Those bandits are obviously your friends.

1304
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,995
Are there more of them?

1305
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,997
About 20. It's a small band.

1306
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,207
They're poor, ignorant men who need help.

1307
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,667
One has been hurt.

1308
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:47,003
I want to see what I can do.

1309
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,464
Hoka says you can wait here without harm.

1310
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:51,841
If you give me your word
you'll forget you ever saw them.

1311
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,843
I promise. On one condition.

1312
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,721
That I can go with you and talk to them.

1313
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,723
20 bandits used to these mountains.

1314
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,850
They'll make excellent scouts for us.

1315
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,186
You never miss an opportunity, do you?

1316
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,521
You do your work. I do mine.

1317
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:06,689
Jen-ai!

1318
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:08,232
I'll speak to him.

1319
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:13,738
Hoka!

1320
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,532
He promises, but only if he can talk to you.

1321
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:17,700
All right!

1322
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,746
It's all right, Colonel!

1323
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:24,916
Hello, Jen-ai.

1324
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,543
The government believes
that our country

1325
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:31,047
will soon be attacked by the Japanese.

1326
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,049
When it comes,

1327
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,718
you can perform an important service

1328
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:38,221
by scouting the enemy.

1329
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,972
If you will help,

1330
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:43,976
you will be pardoned for all your crimes

1331
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:47,980
and become honored citizens again.

1332
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:51,234
You will not have to hide in the mountains

1333
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:52,985
like thieves.

1334
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,154
Think about it.

1335
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:58,157
You can be of valuable help in the north

1336
01:23:58,242 --> 01:24:00,451
if it starts here.

1337
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,745
That's all I have to say.

1338
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:06,499
Your friend makes a fine speech.

1339
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,876
He says we're all going to be heroes.

1340
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,044
If the Japanese come,

1341
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:11,963
we'll all be honored dead, I think.

1342
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,215
Thieves and citizens alike.

1343
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:18,010
Is he going to be all right, Jen-ai?

1344
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:20,388
I don't know enough to be sure

1345
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,765
but at least I got the wound clean.

1346
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,518
Well, use your medicine to make him well.

1347
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,019
He's a good man.

1348
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,522
He's a bad man, Hoka, just like you.

1349
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,524
But I will use the medicine

1350
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:35,528
if your men don't rob
or kill for eight weeks.

1351
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,824
Four weeks.

1352
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,410
-I can kill you and take the medicine.
-Go ahead.

1353
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,455
No killing or robbery for eight weeks

1354
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,707
or I'll let this man rot.

1355
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:50,543
All right.

1356
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:54,547
But you can be very hard, Jen-ai.
Like a man.

1357
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,560
If Dr. Robinson could see me now,

1358
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:12,565
with my convicts, my bandits, and you.

1359
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,525
Still I wonder if in England

1360
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,778
you wouldn't have had a more normal life.

1361
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:19,572
Marriage, children, and all that.

1362
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:22,366
For some people, that never happens,

1363
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,577
no matter where they are.

1364
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:28,080
I have always felt that I was one of those.

1365
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,541
Maybe Hoka is right.

1366
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,043
I am like a man.

1367
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,587
It's a warm night.

1368
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,340
Why don't you come for a swim with me?

1369
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:52,313
Hoka was wrong, Jen-ai.

1370
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,316
You're not like a man at all.

1371
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,540
This village we are coming to

1372
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,041
will be our last visit.

1373
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,335
We head back for Yang Cheng
in the morning.

1374
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,305
The baby should be covered.

1375
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,307
Do you want it to die?

1376
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:30,351
If it dies, I'll get another.

1377
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:33,312
It is easy to get babies. Ask your man.

1378
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,815
Be quiet. Did you steal this child?

1379
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:36,899
No! No!

1380
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,818
It's a girl child, worthless.

1381
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,736
A beggar gave it to me.

1382
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:43,406
I hope to find a woman with pity

1383
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,699
who would take it.

1384
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,493
I'll take it from you. I'll adopt it.

1385
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:48,703
But I need money.

1386
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:49,829
How much?

1387
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,080
Jen-ai.

1388
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:52,164
10 yuan.

1389
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:53,791
Jen-ai, you can't be serious.

1390
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:56,377
All I have is this lucky piece from England.

1391
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,421
Could you lend me some money?

1392
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,089
Not for this idiocy, no.

1393
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:02,341
Sixpence. English money.

1394
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:03,593
-No.
-Take it.

1395
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:07,430
If you don't, the child will die,
and you'll have nothing.

1396
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:10,057
Don't you see how stupid
and pointless this is?

1397
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:13,269
You can't adopt
every abandoned baby in China.

1398
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,605
No, just the ones I'm offered.

1399
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,064
What are you going to do with her?

1400
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,442
Call her Sixpence. Do you like it?

1401
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,527
I said what are you going you do with her?

1402
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,529
What do you know about babies?

1403
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:24,864
What is there to know?

1404
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,240
When they're dirty, wash them.

1405
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:27,617
When they're hungry, feed them.

1406
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,577
We'll find an inn and do both.

1407
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:37,209
I will feed the baby, Jen-ai.

1408
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,670
I spoke to my husband about it.

1409
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,006
Why don't you let us keep her?

1410
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,342
We have no girls.

1411
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,509
No.

1412
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,178
Aren't you being a little selfish?

1413
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,221
It's right for her to be with them.

1414
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,224
I like her. I don't want to give her up.

1415
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,727
WOMAN: Where will you eat,
you and your friend?

1416
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:58,022
Jen-ai and her friend will eat outside

1417
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,025
so that they may quarrel
in peace like true friends.

1418
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,041
Why do you think it's more right

1419
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,043
for Sixpence to stay with them?

1420
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,545
'Cause you think she'll mind one day

1421
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,880
having a white mother?

1422
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:24,674
'Cause you may mind one day

1423
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,175
having a Chinese child.

1424
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,052
But how can you say that?

1425
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,553
Because I know.

1426
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:31,430
My mother was Chinese,

1427
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,182
my father Dutch.

1428
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,059
He took us to his country

1429
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,602
after China made him rich.

1430
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:38,521
It was a great novelty

1431
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,731
having a beautiful Chinese wife.

1432
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,402
Till the embarrassment started coming

1433
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,945
and the insults.

1434
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,614
Then he divorced her and sent her back.

1435
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:52,034
She was a gentle little woman.

1436
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:55,037
She never recovered from it.

1437
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,914
He kept me with him.

1438
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:59,041
An empty man needs sons.

1439
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:02,044
I didn't look very Chinese as a child.

1440
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:05,756
Then the day came
I wasn't a child anymore.

1441
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,759
And I don't want Sixpence ever to tell you

1442
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,762
what I told him the day I left him.

1443
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:15,224
But you were hurt, Lin Nan.

1444
01:29:17,144 --> 01:29:20,187
Oh, do you think I would ever hurt a child?

1445
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,399
No,

1446
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:24,775
you wouldn't.

1447
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,195
But what if you marry?

1448
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,697
Oh, that won't happen.

1449
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,033
You said it before.
How can you be so sure?

1450
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,453
You've never met anyone you loved?

1451
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,455
Nor anyone who loved me.

1452
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,998
Ohh.

1453
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:41,500
I'm not attractive in that way.

1454
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:43,335
But

1455
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:47,298
don't you know you're beautiful?

1456
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:54,013
Once in her life,

1457
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,016
every woman should have that said to her.

1458
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:01,395
I thank you for being the one
who said it to me.

1459
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,527
Oh, it's late. I...

1460
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,030
I better go in.

1461
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,541
May I have the baby?

1462
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:51,839
Yang! Yang! She's coming! She's coming!

1463
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:58,304
I can't wait to see the Hsien Chang's face

1464
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:01,557
when he hears his foot inspector
has a baby now.

1465
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,100
He'll take it calmly.

1466
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,191
They always light firecrackers
when I come home.

1467
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,027
-Hello, children.

1468
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,029
No scolding! They were good!

1469
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:16,530
We were wonderful.

1470
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:18,032
The noise scared her.

1471
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,241
Ahh.

1472
01:32:19,326 --> 01:32:21,702
These are my children.

1473
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,541
This is my big daughter, Sui-Lan,

1474
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:29,835
and my little girl, Mai-Da,

1475
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,837
and my big son

1476
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:33,255
and my little son, Bao Bao.

1477
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,299
Children, this is Colonel Lin.

1478
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,887
Mother, you forgot to say my name.

1479
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:44,058
It's the same as yours. Lin.

1480
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:46,185
Lin?

1481
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:49,104
Yes, yes, we call him Lin.

1482
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:52,024
Children, this little baby's your new sister.

1483
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:55,027
Her name is Sixpence.

1484
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,987
Yang, we can handle one more, can't we?

1485
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:59,657
Can five be more trouble than four?

1486
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,788
I... I found Lin soon after you left

1487
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:09,500
and I felt you were my first friend in China,

1488
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,961
so naturally, I named him after you.

1489
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:13,295
I hope you don't mind.

1490
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:16,131
No, I don't mind.

1491
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,021
And so you lectured her

1492
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,524
on the difficulties of raising children.

1493
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:37,027
Ha! She thrives on difficulties.

1494
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:39,488
She's a very forceful woman.

1495
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:41,824
Yes. Yes, she is,

1496
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:44,994
but she's also gentle and trusting.

1497
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:48,080
She walks through a world full of evil

1498
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,290
and sees only children,

1499
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,835
not complicated or cruel,

1500
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:54,962
just untidy ones

1501
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,966
needing to be washed and fed and loved.

1502
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:04,013
I see this trip has been eventful for you.

1503
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:06,015
And for Jen-ai?

1504
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,516
I don't know.

1505
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,519
In any case, I shall be leaving soon.

1506
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:12,521
And returning?

1507
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,191
No.

1508
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:19,069
Are you troubled, Colonel?

1509
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,031
Confused.

1510
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,532
A sign of growth.

1511
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,034
When first we met,

1512
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:27,161
you were not capable of confusion.

1513
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,580
You were sure of everything.

1514
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,373
That's the way I must be.

1515
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,375
My life is planned.

1516
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,377
A life that is planned

1517
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:38,047
is a closed life, my friend.

1518
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,674
It can be endured, perhaps.

1519
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:43,260
It cannot be lived.

1520
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,097
Excuse me, Hsien Chang.

1521
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:59,193
Write a letter to Jen-ai.

1522
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,071
Write and tell her

1523
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:07,076
the colonel sings the praises
of my foot inspector

1524
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,577
which honors me

1525
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:11,705
and ask her to dine with us this evening.

1526
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:16,085
Also tell her I am sending her

1527
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:21,465
something which was intended
as a gift for her name day.

1528
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:26,095
I think this is a more appropriate occasion.

1529
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:43,362
MAN: The honorable tax collector!

1530
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,033
Hsien Chang, are you well?

1531
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,535
I am well, tax collector.

1532
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,370
This is our guest, Colonel Lin.

1533
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:53,872
Our city is honored, Colonel.

1534
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:59,920
MAN: The honorable foot inspector!

1535
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:03,424
I thought it would give you pleasure
if she joined us.

1536
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:06,802
Look at the elders. They're stunned.

1537
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:10,305
They've never dined here
with a lone woman before.

1538
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:12,558
Officially, that is.

1539
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,560
Are you well, Hsien Chang?

1540
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,103
I am well, Jen-ai,

1541
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:19,440
and well-pleased
my foot inspector is beautiful.

1542
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,941
So you see, Jen-ai,

1543
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,528
more than one man has told you that.

1544
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,989
It's the Hsien Chang's gift that is beautiful.

1545
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:28,449
Yes, that, too.

1546
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:31,743
I am also well-pleased
with my own judgment.

1547
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:34,371
No disrespect to Hsien Chang's gift.

1548
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:37,416
It is his foot inspector who is beautiful.

1549
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,836
You're confusing me.

1550
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,505
Many people are confused these days.

1551
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:46,383
Let us have dinner and wine and music

1552
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:48,427
and discuss it further.

1553
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,429
We will dine!

1554
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:00,689
When you left me at the inn

1555
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,191
I thought you were angry.

1556
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,693
You were wrong, Jen-ai.

1557
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:22,461
Colonel.

1558
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,130
Jen-ai.

1559
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:38,894
Colonel, I'm afraid it is the old China

1560
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,395
which impresses Jen-ai.

1561
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,898
No. I like all of it.

1562
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:45,901
I know there are beautiful things
in other places,

1563
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,320
but I couldn't see until I came here.

1564
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:51,657
Sometimes, I think my life
really started in China.

1565
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,259
Colonel Lin?

1566
01:39:34,344 --> 01:39:35,427
Yes?

1567
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,100
I'll be just a few minutes.

1568
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,198
Well, it seems to be starting.

1569
01:39:56,282 --> 01:40:00,243
Enemy troops are massing at
several points along our borders.

1570
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:03,038
Is my city in danger?

1571
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:04,539
Not yet, certainly.

1572
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,917
Though you never know
where they'll strike

1573
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,960
or when or if.

1574
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:11,880
Hsien Chang, I must go now.

1575
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:14,675
May I ask a favor?

1576
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:19,763
A moment alone with Jen-ai.

1577
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:25,310
Go into the garden.

1578
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:41,868
I told you once that I have
few personal feelings.

1579
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:44,746
You were trying to be unkind.

1580
01:40:44,831 --> 01:40:47,791
Perhaps I'm being even more unkind now.

1581
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:52,087
I've many personal feelings,

1582
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:55,173
for you, all of them.

1583
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:57,175
What I wanted to say to you,

1584
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,678
I... I tried not to say,

1585
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,931
I was afraid to say,

1586
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:06,268
but I cannot leave

1587
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:07,769
with the words unsaid.

1588
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:10,772
There's nothing you can't say to me.

1589
01:41:16,446 --> 01:41:18,864
Would it offend you to be loved

1590
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:22,200
by a man of another race?

1591
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,869
It would honor me.

1592
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,337
That makes me very happy.

1593
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:39,968
So let's leave it this way, Jen-ai,

1594
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:41,470
till I come back.

1595
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:26,973
Look, Mother.

1596
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,274
Children, come down from there.

1597
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,855
Oh, children. Here. Wait here

1598
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,857
until I get back for you.

1599
01:44:40,942 --> 01:44:42,859
There is food in the basket.

1600
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:45,236
Sui-Lan, watch out for them. Be brave.

1601
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,466
Jen-ai! Jen-ai!

1602
01:45:48,551 --> 01:45:50,719
What is to become of us?
Tell me what to do!

1603
01:45:50,803 --> 01:45:54,097
Take the children whose parents
are gone to my inn!

1604
01:45:59,145 --> 01:46:00,729
Are you hurt?

1605
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:01,896
No.

1606
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,818
Yang! Yang!

1607
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:14,409
Yang!

1608
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,921
To the square, everybody!

1609
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:28,923
Everybody go to the square!

1610
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:30,800
To the square, everybody!

1611
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:32,302
Have you seen Yang?

1612
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,763
I don't know. Go to the square.

1613
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:36,347
The Hsien Chang wants everyone!

1614
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:51,404
Citizens of Yang Cheng,

1615
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:54,449
Japanese soldiers are close to us

1616
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,494
less than a day's march away.

1617
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:01,164
We will take refuge in the mountains,

1618
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:05,168
on the farms in the small villages.

1619
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:10,006
The officials and I will
stay close to Yang Cheng

1620
01:47:10,091 --> 01:47:13,676
to keep watch and to send word to you

1621
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,429
when it is safe to return.

1622
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:20,517
Go now and work for your city

1623
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:22,435
and your brothers.

1624
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:35,534
Go to the west gate. It is time now.

1625
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:47,210
To the west gate! It is time!

1626
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:53,675
To the west gate, everyone.

1627
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,176
To the west gate.

1628
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:02,475
Jen-ai!

1629
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:06,062
Li, what are you doing here?

1630
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:07,605
The prison has been destroyed.

1631
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:08,815
Many were killed.

1632
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:11,526
The few who survived have been set free.

1633
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:14,195
I have come to help.

1634
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:54,611
Jen-ai, we found Yang.

1635
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:57,447
Where is he?

1636
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:58,823
He's behind the marketplace.

1637
01:48:58,908 --> 01:49:00,783
-Is he hurt?
-Badly.

1638
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:01,910
I'll come!

1639
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:04,537
Li, you go on with the children.

1640
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:07,916
Follow the Hsien Chang.
I'll see you in Peh-Chu.

1641
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,417
You're staying here alone?

1642
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:12,420
I must say good-bye to an old friend.

1643
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:31,522
Very tired.

1644
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:34,525
I die soon.

1645
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:37,403
Not so bad to die.

1646
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:40,490
Not good, but not so bad.

1647
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:47,914
Not to worry, Miss Gladys, not to worry.

1648
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:48,117
No sign of the enemy, sir, or anyone else.

1649
01:51:48,202 --> 01:51:50,745
The others are still searching,
but the city seems abandoned.

1650
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:52,163
Possibly, a week.

1651
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,664
All right, we go in.

1652
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:55,875
Groups of six, five minutes apart.

1653
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:57,418
Tell the men.

1654
01:51:57,503 --> 01:51:59,253
-Lieutenant Wong?
-Yes, sir.

1655
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:01,130
You come with me.

1656
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:06,260
Sergeant Wu, Sergeant Ching,
Sergeant Fong.

1657
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:43,441
Lin Nan!

1658
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:48,321
Oh!

1659
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:51,908
You are alive.

1660
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:03,961
So many things to tell

1661
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:06,464
and so many things to ask.

1662
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:08,966
All I can think of is

1663
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:10,468
can Sixpence walk now?

1664
01:54:10,552 --> 01:54:11,844
Yes.

1665
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:15,348
Yes, and she said her first word last week.

1666
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:16,766
What was it?

1667
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,267
She said no.

1668
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,024
What is it?

1669
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:27,026
It's the elders celebrating their return.

1670
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,612
We were close by in the hills
with the Hsien Chang

1671
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,614
and we saw you ride in.

1672
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:36,035
Jen-ai, is the Hsien Chang
in the Hsien-Cheng-Fu?

1673
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:37,870
Yes.

1674
01:54:37,955 --> 01:54:39,789
I have to talk to him

1675
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:42,375
and to you.

1676
01:54:48,549 --> 01:54:49,799
Hsien Chang!

1677
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:57,139
Ah, you have found each other.

1678
01:54:57,224 --> 01:55:01,143
This is a happy night for many reasons.

1679
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:03,813
They will be glad to see the last of us

1680
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:06,816
at Peh-Chu, thanks to this young woman.

1681
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:10,736
You should see the orphans
she has collected there.

1682
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:13,364
10, 15, I've lost count.

1683
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:16,075
Captain, start on with the men. I'll follow.

1684
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:17,243
Oh, I'm sorry.

1685
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:19,036
I thought there would be a little time.

1686
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:22,039
Soon there will be all the time in the world.

1687
01:55:22,124 --> 01:55:24,417
Our troops are advancing.

1688
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:26,168
The enemy has been pushed back.

1689
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:29,005
No, Hsien Chang.

1690
01:55:29,089 --> 01:55:31,591
They've been withdrawn
to join a powerful army

1691
01:55:31,675 --> 01:55:33,593
which has just crossed our border.

1692
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:36,596
We'll bring up everything
we have to meet it.

1693
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,598
The war is just beginning.

1694
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:41,767
They will have to put up with us

1695
01:55:41,852 --> 01:55:44,103
a little longer at Peh-Chu.

1696
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:46,272
No, Hsien Chang.

1697
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,400
You must leave tonight with the elders

1698
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:50,568
for the town of Lao.

1699
01:55:50,652 --> 01:55:53,070
But Lao is in another province.

1700
01:55:53,155 --> 01:55:54,113
Exactly.

1701
01:55:54,197 --> 01:55:56,407
If you were captured here,

1702
01:55:56,491 --> 01:55:59,118
the enemy could use you
as a puppet governor,

1703
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:00,494
issue orders through you,

1704
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:01,787
which the people would obey.

1705
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:04,373
You speak as if we were defeated!

1706
01:56:04,458 --> 01:56:06,876
The battle has not yet been fought!

1707
01:56:08,337 --> 01:56:09,795
We will be defeated.

1708
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,757
We'll hold them up as long as we can,

1709
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:15,760
but they'll push us back, mile by mile

1710
01:56:15,844 --> 01:56:17,762
till they suddenly burst through

1711
01:56:17,846 --> 01:56:20,306
and pour across the north like a river.

1712
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:24,935
I must tell the elders.

1713
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,937
They are at the temple

1714
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:29,315
offering thanks for their homecoming,

1715
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:34,570
but we will sit down
together, one last time.

1716
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:47,458
You could go with him,
but Shencheng is better.

1717
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:48,959
It's army headquarters.

1718
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:51,462
I'll be sure of finding you there.

1719
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:53,464
You'll find me right here

1720
01:56:53,548 --> 01:56:57,259
or in the hills nearby, where I belong.

1721
01:56:57,344 --> 01:56:59,470
All missionaries and foreigners

1722
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:02,306
are being ordered out of this area.

1723
01:57:02,391 --> 01:57:05,309
If it is true, that doesn't apply to me.

1724
01:57:05,394 --> 01:57:07,311
I'm not an accredited missionary

1725
01:57:07,396 --> 01:57:09,814
and I'm a Chinese citizen, not a foreigner.

1726
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:11,816
But it isn't true, is it?

1727
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,776
You don't lie very well.

1728
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:18,864
I want you to promise me you will go.

1729
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:20,866
I want you out of it.

1730
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:22,868
Don't wish me out of this

1731
01:57:22,953 --> 01:57:25,454
or in any way seek to get me out

1732
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:27,373
for I will not be got out.

1733
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:28,833
These are my people

1734
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:32,461
and I will live and die with them.

1735
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:36,716
I want you to be safe.

1736
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,552
I'm afraid for you.

1737
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:42,304
Oh, I'm afraid for you, too.

1738
01:57:43,432 --> 01:57:45,349
So many men will die,

1739
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:48,644
but I don't love you any less for leaving.

1740
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:53,315
Do you think I love you less for staying?

1741
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:59,155
Jen-ai, life was good to bring us together.

1742
01:57:59,239 --> 01:58:02,825
Two people who thought that
they had to live without love.

1743
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:07,496
And tonight again, when everything
seemed against it,

1744
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:09,749
we found each other.

1745
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:12,668
But isn't it asking too much,

1746
01:58:12,753 --> 01:58:16,046
even of God, if there is a God,

1747
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:18,841
to hope that we will meet again

1748
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:20,468
if you stay here?

1749
01:58:24,014 --> 01:58:26,432
Whatever you decide, let Hoka know.

1750
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,934
I'll get in touch with him.

1751
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:31,270
Whatever you decide,

1752
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:33,522
I love you.

1753
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,279
As long as I'm alive,

1754
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:42,031
I will love you.

1755
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:50,975
These robes, in farewell to the past,

1756
01:59:51,059 --> 01:59:53,102
mine and China's.

1757
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:03,696
In a little while, we must leave our city

1758
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,532
perhaps for years, perhaps forever.

1759
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:09,535
For those of us who are old,

1760
02:00:09,619 --> 02:00:12,538
certainly forever.

1761
02:00:12,622 --> 02:00:14,540
Elders of Yang Cheng,

1762
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:16,542
I thank you for your help

1763
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:18,043
in this time of trouble,

1764
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:22,381
but we were born to our trouble.

1765
02:00:22,465 --> 02:00:26,677
There is one who has taken it upon herself

1766
02:00:26,761 --> 02:00:31,974
not from necessity but from love.

1767
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:39,899
Jen-ai,

1768
02:00:39,983 --> 02:00:43,402
we thank you for those who are not here,

1769
02:00:43,486 --> 02:00:47,990
for the dead, whose children
you have taken as your own,

1770
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:52,244
for the poor and the sick and the afflicted,

1771
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:55,581
for all the people of Yang Cheng,

1772
02:00:55,665 --> 02:00:59,251
for the past and for the future.

1773
02:00:59,336 --> 02:01:05,215
I honor you for your strength.

1774
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:08,427
I wish to share with you

1775
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:13,182
the faith from which it comes.

1776
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:18,604
City recorder,

1777
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,901
close the books of Yang Cheng
with this entry.

1778
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:25,778
As a sign of respect

1779
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:27,780
for the honored foot inspector

1780
02:01:27,864 --> 02:01:29,573
of this city,

1781
02:01:29,658 --> 02:01:32,284
the Hsien Chang of Yang Cheng

1782
02:01:32,369 --> 02:01:34,828
has become a Christian.

1783
02:01:43,004 --> 02:01:44,630
Oh, I...

1784
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:48,467
I thank you for this... For this great gift.

1785
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,552
I can't... I can't...

1786
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,473
Jen-ai,

1787
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:57,601
accept my gift.

1788
02:01:57,686 --> 02:01:59,895
It is offered with love.

1789
02:02:05,402 --> 02:02:09,405
It is time to go, old friends.

1790
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:23,752
Stay here in the Hsien-Cheng-Fu for a little.

1791
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:28,298
It will comfort me as I leave to know it.

1792
02:02:28,383 --> 02:02:33,762
We shall not see each other again, I think.

1793
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,017
Farewell,

1794
02:02:38,101 --> 02:02:39,560
Jen-ai.

1795
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,898
How many more can we lose?

1796
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:27,900
When the Japanese have gone,

1797
02:03:27,984 --> 02:03:31,320
if any of our men are still alive, help them.

1798
02:04:01,017 --> 02:04:03,435
This is all the food I can spare.

1799
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,104
I wish I could keep you here longer

1800
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:06,396
but it isn't safe.

1801
02:04:06,481 --> 02:04:07,940
Be careful and good luck.

1802
02:04:22,831 --> 02:04:24,414
If you'd gone when the colonel told you,

1803
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:25,624
you wouldn't have so many children.

1804
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:28,127
Have you any news of Colonel Lin?

1805
02:04:28,211 --> 02:04:29,920
No. Many soldiers are trapped in Tsechow.

1806
02:04:30,004 --> 02:04:33,632
-He might be there.
-She hit me.

1807
02:04:33,716 --> 02:04:35,384
I want to speak to you.

1808
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:36,885
Go. Go and play.

1809
02:04:50,066 --> 02:04:51,817
There, the Japanese are. Here we are

1810
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:54,319
with only Tsechow in between.

1811
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:55,988
There's only one thing to do...

1812
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,157
Get out while you have the chance.

1813
02:04:58,241 --> 02:05:00,659
That's what I'd planned
if they came that close,

1814
02:05:00,743 --> 02:05:03,120
but that was before I had 50 children.

1815
02:05:03,663 --> 02:05:04,872
There's no place for them.

1816
02:05:04,956 --> 02:05:07,332
There's no room in Peh-Chu.

1817
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:09,084
I thought of the mountain caves,

1818
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:10,794
but it's getting too cold.

1819
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,087
We have to stay here.

1820
02:05:12,172 --> 02:05:15,632
That's foolishness. Get out
while you have the chance.

1821
02:05:15,717 --> 02:05:18,177
I would if I knew where l
could get food for the children,

1822
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:21,430
medical care, schooling, all that they need.

1823
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:25,100
At least the inn is on neutral ground.
It's owned by the mission.

1824
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:26,935
I don't think anyone would hurt them.

1825
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:29,229
You think the Japanese will feed them?

1826
02:05:29,314 --> 02:05:31,857
They're human beings. They might.

1827
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:33,901
Oh, I don't know.

1828
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:51,293
You've been awake all night.

1829
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,465
I don't know what to do.

1830
02:05:56,549 --> 02:06:00,219
I've thought. I've prayed. I...

1831
02:06:00,303 --> 02:06:03,680
It's no use. I can't find an answer.

1832
02:06:03,765 --> 02:06:05,724
I've started the stove.

1833
02:06:05,808 --> 02:06:07,392
I'll bring you some good hot tea.

1834
02:06:07,477 --> 02:06:08,894
-And then...

1835
02:06:24,369 --> 02:06:25,702
Wait! Wait!

1836
02:06:33,169 --> 02:06:35,420
Your friend ran after
the men who brought us.

1837
02:06:35,505 --> 02:06:37,005
They were afraid.

1838
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:39,424
All the way from Tsechow,
they were afraid.

1839
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:41,969
I thought Tsechow was taken.

1840
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:44,179
It was, but our missionary got us out.

1841
02:06:44,264 --> 02:06:46,181
We're from the mission orphanage.

1842
02:06:46,266 --> 02:06:47,349
I see.

1843
02:06:49,769 --> 02:06:51,103
Where were the men
supposed to take you?

1844
02:06:51,187 --> 02:06:52,271
Do you know?

1845
02:06:52,355 --> 02:06:56,358
To you, if your name is Jen-ai.

1846
02:06:56,442 --> 02:06:59,194
I've a letter for you from our missionary.

1847
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:00,696
My name is Timothy.

1848
02:07:01,823 --> 02:07:03,699
I couldn't catch the men.

1849
02:07:06,202 --> 02:07:08,245
There must be 50 of them.

1850
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:10,539
Oh, Li, the answer came.

1851
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:13,125
It's from the missionary in Tsechow.

1852
02:07:13,209 --> 02:07:14,418
He wouldn't leave his hospital,

1853
02:07:14,502 --> 02:07:16,712
but there's a home
for the children in the interior

1854
02:07:16,796 --> 02:07:18,171
with a school and everything

1855
02:07:18,256 --> 02:07:19,298
and they'll take ours.

1856
02:07:19,382 --> 02:07:23,969
We have to get them to the mission
at Sian by November 12th.

1857
02:07:24,053 --> 02:07:27,806
The army trucks which will take them

1858
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:29,141
must leave on that date.

1859
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:31,143
But that is three weeks away!

1860
02:07:31,227 --> 02:07:34,146
And it'll only take one week
on the Honan Road.

1861
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:38,650
Oh! "These children will be met in Sian

1862
02:07:38,735 --> 02:07:40,360
"and taken the rest of the way

1863
02:07:40,445 --> 02:07:44,489
"by the head of the mission center,
Dr. Robinson."

1864
02:07:44,574 --> 02:07:46,575
Dr. Robinson.

1865
02:07:50,496 --> 02:07:52,581
Oh, children!

1866
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:58,587
Oh!

1867
02:08:17,732 --> 02:08:19,149
Hurry up, men!

1868
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:21,777
Get out of your uniforms quickly.

1869
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:27,616
He's coming, Colonel!

1870
02:08:34,207 --> 02:08:35,665
She wasn't there.

1871
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:38,543
There's no one in Yang Cheng
but a few old people.

1872
02:08:38,628 --> 02:08:40,212
Where did she go?

1873
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:42,089
Sian, with the children and Li,

1874
02:08:42,173 --> 02:08:43,757
by way of the Honan Road.

1875
02:08:43,841 --> 02:08:45,425
Honan Road.

1876
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:47,844
The Japanese have a roadblock
on the Honan Road

1877
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:49,721
30 miles south of Yang Cheng.

1878
02:08:49,806 --> 02:08:50,847
When did she leave?

1879
02:08:50,932 --> 02:08:53,016
Yesterday afternoon. On foot.

1880
02:08:53,601 --> 02:08:55,352
On foot

1881
02:08:55,436 --> 02:08:58,355
with 20 children to slow her down.

1882
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:01,858
With 100 children to slow her down.

1883
02:09:01,943 --> 02:09:03,819
100 children.

1884
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,261
Jen-ai.

1885
02:09:29,345 --> 02:09:33,014
Jen-ai!

1886
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:50,198
Lin Nan.

1887
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:57,747
I didn't think I'd reach you in time.

1888
02:09:57,832 --> 02:10:00,417
You're walking into an enemy roadblock.

1889
02:10:00,501 --> 02:10:03,920
Oh. Oh! I have to get
these children to Sian.

1890
02:10:04,005 --> 02:10:06,965
I can't go back. Not a handful
would survive the winter.

1891
02:10:07,049 --> 02:10:08,300
But the roadblock...

1892
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:11,470
I can get them across the mountains.

1893
02:10:11,554 --> 02:10:13,972
But it's twice as long, terribly dangerous

1894
02:10:14,056 --> 02:10:17,017
and impossible for you alone
on foot with 100 children.

1895
02:10:17,101 --> 02:10:18,977
I can't go with you.

1896
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:21,313
My orders are to start the resistance here

1897
02:10:21,397 --> 02:10:22,939
with the people and soldiers left.

1898
02:10:23,024 --> 02:10:25,317
You'd only put us in danger,

1899
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:27,652
you or any soldier.

1900
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:30,989
This way, if we're caught,
I can explain who we are...

1901
02:10:31,073 --> 02:10:33,158
If you're given the chance to explain.

1902
02:10:33,242 --> 02:10:35,327
If the journey doesn't kill you.

1903
02:10:35,411 --> 02:10:39,456
No. No. I think this journey
was meant for me.

1904
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:42,792
Lin Nan, I think this is why God

1905
02:10:42,877 --> 02:10:44,836
wanted me to come to China,

1906
02:10:44,921 --> 02:10:47,255
to get these children out.

1907
02:10:57,683 --> 02:11:00,101
Remember to avoid the traveled roads

1908
02:11:00,186 --> 02:11:02,354
and look for the hidden ones.

1909
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:05,357
I've marked the distance
you should cover each day

1910
02:11:05,441 --> 02:11:07,359
to reach Sian in time.

1911
02:11:07,443 --> 02:11:10,529
When you get there,
go to army headquarters.

1912
02:11:10,613 --> 02:11:13,657
They will try to get
a message through to me.

1913
02:11:13,741 --> 02:11:17,160
Then you're not going to
ask me to stay in Sian

1914
02:11:17,245 --> 02:11:22,207
or to go to safety in the interior
with the children?

1915
02:11:22,291 --> 02:11:24,709
I know you too well for that now

1916
02:11:24,794 --> 02:11:26,795
and I love you too much.

1917
02:11:26,879 --> 02:11:29,798
I know you'll come back if you can.

1918
02:11:43,896 --> 02:11:46,815
I'll give it to our oldest son one day.

1919
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:53,697
You must go while there's still light.

1920
02:12:00,288 --> 02:12:02,581
A safe journey,

1921
02:12:02,665 --> 02:12:03,999
a happy return.

1922
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:09,314
Timothy, take Sixpence a while.

1923
02:13:24,789 --> 02:13:27,582
I thought the big boys
were carrying the pot.

1924
02:13:27,667 --> 02:13:28,833
They're playing a game.

1925
02:13:28,918 --> 02:13:30,710
It is good that they're in high spirits.

1926
02:13:30,795 --> 02:13:34,422
I'd like to keep them that way
as long as we can.

1927
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:38,677
Three more days and our food is gone.

1928
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:39,844
But here is the village.

1929
02:13:39,929 --> 02:13:41,888
I know the people will help us.

1930
02:13:41,972 --> 02:13:44,974
We should be there in about two days.

1931
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:49,312
Should we stop and let them rest?

1932
02:13:50,439 --> 02:13:53,650
Let us go on a little longer while it is light.

1933
02:13:55,903 --> 02:13:57,028
Up.

1934
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:33,648
Come on, children.

1935
02:14:39,947 --> 02:14:41,072
Some rice.

1936
02:14:58,215 --> 02:15:00,508
There. Now you two share that bowl.

1937
02:15:00,593 --> 02:15:02,051
Give me that.

1938
02:15:06,348 --> 02:15:07,849
You two share it.

1939
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:10,935
There.

1940
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:13,062
Now you share it with her.

1941
02:15:13,147 --> 02:15:14,522
Go over there.

1942
02:15:16,817 --> 02:15:19,861
There's so little food in this soup.

1943
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,239
It's hot. It'll fill their stomachs

1944
02:15:23,365 --> 02:15:24,449
until they fall asleep.

1945
02:15:24,533 --> 02:15:26,034
And when they wake?

1946
02:15:35,044 --> 02:15:37,295
I could have 10 more bowls full.

1947
02:15:37,379 --> 02:15:39,547
Big talk. Big stomach.

1948
02:16:21,674 --> 02:16:24,509
Children, run down the road.

1949
02:16:26,595 --> 02:16:28,263
Keep going.

1950
02:16:28,973 --> 02:16:31,099
Come on, children.

1951
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:35,520
Hurry up.

1952
02:17:05,801 --> 02:17:08,970
We'll try and find a crossing upstream.

1953
02:17:11,307 --> 02:17:14,309
Children, come down here. Be very careful.

1954
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:19,981
Children, come down this way.

1955
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:21,399
Careful.

1956
02:17:35,414 --> 02:17:36,456
It's too deep.

1957
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:37,874
It's over my head.

1958
02:17:37,958 --> 02:17:39,959
Too dangerous.

1959
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:44,797
And cold. Very cold.

1960
02:17:44,882 --> 02:17:46,299
But we can't stop now.

1961
02:17:47,051 --> 02:17:49,218
If we had a rope,
we could tie one end to a tree

1962
02:17:49,303 --> 02:17:51,304
and one of us could get across
with the other end.

1963
02:17:51,388 --> 02:17:53,723
And then we could make a big fire.

1964
02:17:53,849 --> 02:17:56,517
Jen-ai, we have some rope and blankets.

1965
02:18:19,375 --> 02:18:23,086
Children, you know what
the coldest sound in the world is?

1966
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:26,005
Well, it's teeth chattering.

1967
02:18:26,090 --> 02:18:28,174
And that is all I can hear.

1968
02:18:28,258 --> 02:18:32,303
Do you know what we are going to do?

1969
02:18:32,388 --> 02:18:34,472
We're going to sing a song
and drown it out.

1970
02:18:34,556 --> 02:18:35,974
Take your jacket off.

1971
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:39,102
We're going to sing... You know this one.

1972
02:18:39,186 --> 02:18:40,979
Hold it up. There.

1973
02:18:41,063 --> 02:18:42,897
We're going to sing, you know.

1974
02:18:42,982 --> 02:18:44,691
This old man

1975
02:18:44,775 --> 02:18:46,985
He played one

1976
02:18:47,069 --> 02:18:51,197
He played knick-knack on my drum

1977
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,366
Knick-knack paddywack

1978
02:18:53,450 --> 02:18:55,368
Give the dog a bone

1979
02:18:55,452 --> 02:18:57,662
This old man came

1980
02:18:57,788 --> 02:18:59,497
Rolling home

1981
02:18:59,581 --> 02:19:01,666
Come on.

1982
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:03,876
This old man

1983
02:19:03,961 --> 02:19:06,504
He played one

1984
02:19:06,588 --> 02:19:09,382
He played knick-knack on my drum

1985
02:19:09,466 --> 02:19:11,426
With a knick-knack paddywack

1986
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:12,719
Give a dog a bone

1987
02:19:12,803 --> 02:19:15,680
This old man came rolling home

1988
02:19:15,764 --> 02:19:17,181
This old man

1989
02:19:17,266 --> 02:19:18,683
He played two

1990
02:19:18,767 --> 02:19:21,394
He played knick-knack on my shoe

1991
02:19:21,478 --> 02:19:23,521
With a knick-knack paddywack

1992
02:19:23,605 --> 02:19:24,856
Give a dog a bone

1993
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:27,775
This old man came rolling home

1994
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:29,110
This old man

1995
02:19:29,194 --> 02:19:30,778
He played three

1996
02:19:30,863 --> 02:19:33,781
He played knick-knack on my knee

1997
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:52,842
It's quiet. Too quiet.

1998
02:19:52,926 --> 02:19:54,635
So are the children.

1999
02:20:03,437 --> 02:20:04,562
Children!

2000
02:20:04,646 --> 02:20:06,314
Run! Come on!

2001
02:20:07,983 --> 02:20:09,400
Under the trees!

2002
02:20:09,485 --> 02:20:10,818
Come on!

2003
02:20:57,199 --> 02:20:58,366
Get up.

2004
02:20:59,535 --> 02:21:00,785
Come.

2005
02:21:00,869 --> 02:21:03,162
Children, get up.

2006
02:21:03,247 --> 02:21:04,580
Get up, children.

2007
02:21:11,463 --> 02:21:13,005
Come on, children.

2008
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:14,173
Come.

2009
02:21:22,057 --> 02:21:26,144
Oh! They are ours! They are Chinese.

2010
02:21:33,652 --> 02:21:35,319
Woman, where you taking those children?

2011
02:21:35,404 --> 02:21:37,155
I'm trying to get them to Sian.

2012
02:21:37,239 --> 02:21:38,322
We've been walking for days.

2013
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:39,824
The children are starving.

2014
02:21:40,868 --> 02:21:42,910
Men, feed the children.

2015
02:21:44,413 --> 02:21:46,622
Thank you. Do you think
the airplane will come back?

2016
02:21:46,707 --> 02:21:49,041
I don't know. They were
reconnaissance, I think.

2017
02:21:49,126 --> 02:21:51,043
We had to hide too.

2018
02:21:51,128 --> 02:21:53,045
Yesterday we saw some Japanese soldiers

2019
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:55,047
in the forest you're coming to.

2020
02:21:55,132 --> 02:21:57,383
It's very dangerous. There may be more.

2021
02:21:57,467 --> 02:21:59,427
We have no other way to go.

2022
02:21:59,511 --> 02:22:01,012
I wish we could help you

2023
02:22:01,096 --> 02:22:03,097
but our orders take us north.

2024
02:22:03,182 --> 02:22:05,433
Anywhere near Yang Cheng?

2025
02:22:05,517 --> 02:22:07,435
I don't know.

2026
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:10,188
If you should get near Yang Cheng

2027
02:22:10,272 --> 02:22:13,024
and you run into a man
called Lin, Colonel Lin...

2028
02:22:13,108 --> 02:22:15,026
Would you give him a message?

2029
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:17,695
Tell him you met a woman
with 100 children

2030
02:22:17,779 --> 02:22:20,907
only six days from the Yellow River.

2031
02:22:20,991 --> 02:22:23,910
And tell him to stay alive.

2032
02:22:23,994 --> 02:22:25,453
Just to stay alive.

2033
02:22:38,634 --> 02:22:40,885
How good it was to see them eat.

2034
02:22:40,969 --> 02:22:42,637
It would be good to see you eat.

2035
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:46,140
Drink this. One of the soldiers
gave me a pinch of tea.

2036
02:22:47,142 --> 02:22:50,895
This forest... This is where
we're going to lose time.

2037
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:54,315
No path, the children running off.

2038
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:56,567
I got this chalk from one of the soldiers.

2039
02:22:56,652 --> 02:22:58,069
What do you want that for?

2040
02:22:58,153 --> 02:23:01,072
I want to leave ahead of you and scout.

2041
02:23:01,156 --> 02:23:02,615
But if there's danger ahead.

2042
02:23:02,699 --> 02:23:05,451
I could mark the trees
with this chalk as a guide.

2043
02:23:05,535 --> 02:23:06,577
The children could make a game

2044
02:23:06,662 --> 02:23:07,745
of looking for the marks.

2045
02:23:07,829 --> 02:23:09,330
It would hurry them too.

2046
02:23:09,414 --> 02:23:12,291
We'd better stay together.

2047
02:23:12,376 --> 02:23:14,418
I don't want you to go alone.

2048
02:23:14,503 --> 02:23:16,921
Alone or together,
we'll meet what we're meant to,

2049
02:23:17,005 --> 02:23:18,798
danger or safety.

2050
02:23:18,882 --> 02:23:22,843
I'll wait for you at the end of the forest.

2051
02:23:55,419 --> 02:23:56,419
Mother,

2052
02:23:58,297 --> 02:24:00,172
you are worried, aren't you?

2053
02:24:00,257 --> 02:24:01,966
I'm just tired.

2054
02:24:03,885 --> 02:24:05,553
We must all sleep.

2055
02:24:07,764 --> 02:24:09,807
Mother,

2056
02:24:09,891 --> 02:24:12,643
do you think we'll be in time

2057
02:24:12,728 --> 02:24:15,187
for the trucks on the 12th?

2058
02:24:15,272 --> 02:24:18,983
Of course, Sui-Lan. We'll be in time.

2059
02:24:19,067 --> 02:24:21,068
We must be in time.

2060
02:24:23,655 --> 02:24:24,739
Mother,

2061
02:24:26,074 --> 02:24:29,327
when you take us to Sian

2062
02:24:29,411 --> 02:24:32,163
you're going back, aren't you?

2063
02:24:32,247 --> 02:24:33,622
To Yang Cheng.

2064
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:38,711
Oh, Mother, will I ever see you again?

2065
02:24:38,795 --> 02:24:41,213
-Oh, Sui-Lan.
-Oh, Mother.

2066
02:24:41,298 --> 02:24:43,299
Sui-Lan.

2067
02:24:43,383 --> 02:24:45,843
You and Lin and the three little ones,

2068
02:24:45,927 --> 02:24:48,220
you're mine. You're my family.

2069
02:24:48,305 --> 02:24:50,222
We'll keep together. I promise you.

2070
02:24:50,307 --> 02:24:52,725
I'll just be gone for a little while.

2071
02:24:52,809 --> 02:24:55,436
You'll go to school,
and I'll be so proud of you.

2072
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:58,356
And when the war is over

2073
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,900
we'll all go home.

2074
02:25:00,984 --> 02:25:03,569
We'll all go home.

2075
02:25:03,653 --> 02:25:04,987
Yes.

2076
02:25:06,823 --> 02:25:08,908
I'll look after the little ones.

2077
02:25:08,992 --> 02:25:10,034
Yes.

2078
02:25:10,118 --> 02:25:13,037
Until you come back to us.

2079
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:16,707
Oh, my mother, you come back to us.

2080
02:25:16,792 --> 02:25:20,753
You come back for us.

2081
02:25:21,963 --> 02:25:23,923
Come back for us.

2082
02:25:24,007 --> 02:25:26,175
Oh, Sui-Lan.

2083
02:25:44,653 --> 02:25:46,487
I found one!

2084
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:48,489
I found another one.

2085
02:25:53,078 --> 02:25:54,703
I found one.

2086
02:25:58,041 --> 02:25:59,542
I see another.

2087
02:26:53,054 --> 02:26:55,723
Sit down, children,
wherever you are. Sit down.

2088
02:26:56,558 --> 02:26:58,184
Don't move until I get back.

2089
02:26:58,268 --> 02:27:01,187
Be very quiet. Sui-Lan, watch them.

2090
02:27:01,271 --> 02:27:04,315
Timothy. Timothy, come with me.

2091
02:27:59,996 --> 02:28:02,915
"If you keep My commandments

2092
02:28:02,999 --> 02:28:05,834
"you shall abide in My love

2093
02:28:05,919 --> 02:28:09,547
"even as I have kept
My Father's commandments

2094
02:28:09,631 --> 02:28:11,715
"and abide in His love.

2095
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:14,802
"These things I have spoken unto you

2096
02:28:14,886 --> 02:28:17,721
"that My joy might remain in you

2097
02:28:17,806 --> 02:28:20,975
"and that your joy might be full."

2098
02:28:22,769 --> 02:28:25,312
This is My commandment...

2099
02:28:25,397 --> 02:28:27,314
That ye love one another

2100
02:28:27,399 --> 02:28:30,109
as I have loved you.

2101
02:28:30,193 --> 02:28:33,904
Greater love hath no man than this

2102
02:28:33,989 --> 02:28:37,616
that a man lay down his life

2103
02:28:37,701 --> 02:28:39,159
for his friends.

2104
02:29:30,211 --> 02:29:33,130
How far have we got to go? I'm hungry.

2105
02:29:33,214 --> 02:29:34,381
I'm hungry.

2106
02:29:34,466 --> 02:29:35,466
I'm tired.

2107
02:29:35,550 --> 02:29:37,843
I'm tired too.

2108
02:29:37,927 --> 02:29:42,306
Children, children, no. We can't stay here.

2109
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:44,350
We can't stay here.

2110
02:29:44,434 --> 02:29:48,479
I know you're tired and hungry

2111
02:29:48,563 --> 02:29:51,857
but this is the last mountain
we are going to cross.

2112
02:29:51,941 --> 02:29:55,861
And then... Then we'll see the Yellow River

2113
02:29:55,945 --> 02:29:58,989
and ride across to Sian.

2114
02:29:59,074 --> 02:30:02,868
Now, you must think how happy

2115
02:30:02,952 --> 02:30:05,454
our good friend Li, who is in heaven

2116
02:30:05,538 --> 02:30:07,748
would be for us.

2117
02:30:08,249 --> 02:30:09,667
There. Now

2118
02:30:09,751 --> 02:30:11,168
try to be brave

2119
02:30:11,252 --> 02:30:13,003
just a little longer.

2120
02:30:13,088 --> 02:30:15,005
Now.

2121
02:30:15,090 --> 02:30:17,675
Come on, children.

2122
02:30:17,759 --> 02:30:18,842
Come on.

2123
02:32:35,396 --> 02:32:37,272
Look! The river.

2124
02:32:39,609 --> 02:32:42,069
Oh. Children, the river!

2125
02:32:47,075 --> 02:32:50,244
Oh, Sixpence, look!

2126
02:32:50,328 --> 02:32:51,829
Look at the river.

2127
02:32:57,919 --> 02:32:59,670
Go. Let's go.

2128
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:25,612
Dr. Robinson.

2129
02:33:28,616 --> 02:33:30,701
Have you any news?

2130
02:33:30,785 --> 02:33:32,035
No. But today is November 12th

2131
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:35,455
and the trucks are at the depot.
You'll have to leave.

2132
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:38,166
We're not leaving without those children.

2133
02:33:38,293 --> 02:33:42,421
That last message said
they were six days away.

2134
02:33:42,505 --> 02:33:44,715
That was nearly two weeks ago.

2135
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:46,049
The mountains they are going through

2136
02:33:46,134 --> 02:33:48,218
are controlled by the enemy
and almost impassible...

2137
02:33:48,303 --> 02:33:49,386
I know, but...

2138
02:33:49,470 --> 02:33:52,389
There's practically no chance
for them to get through.

2139
02:33:52,473 --> 02:33:55,392
I know. The whole city knows.

2140
02:33:55,476 --> 02:33:58,896
That's why we've been praying
night and day for those children.

2141
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:01,398
Why we'll continue to pray and to wait.

2142
02:34:01,482 --> 02:34:04,151
I'm sorry, Doctor, but...

2143
02:34:12,327 --> 02:34:13,285
This old man

2144
02:34:13,369 --> 02:34:14,912
Came rolling home
