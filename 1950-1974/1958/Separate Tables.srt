1
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,330
Major Pollock.

2
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,119
Well, hello.

3
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,731
What's this?

4
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,201
I was rather worried about you.

5
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,439
Worried? Why?

6
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,167
- Has anybody been talking about me?
- No, Major.

7
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,199
It's just that, when you were away
for these last two days, I...

8
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,959
I see. Yes, I telephoned the hotel.

9
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,239
I talked to Miss Cooper.
I told her I was visiting a friend.

10
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,279
A company commander who served
under me in the desert campaigns

11
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,799
ran into a bit of bad luck,
I thought I'd give him a hand.

12
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,999
You're always trying to help
people, aren't you, Major?

13
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,999
Well, yes, but the fellow
saved my life once,

14
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,599
just outside of El Alamein.

15
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,319
Pinned down. Short of petrol.
He was a good man.

16
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,439
Yes.

17
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,119
Mark you, Jerry in the desert
was a different cup of tea

18
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,679
from Jerry on the Western Front.

19
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,959
Were you in Normandy, too, Major?

20
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,719
No, Desert Rats, you know.

21
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,719
Still, we got to
Berlin, eventually.

22
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,759
Berlin must have been depressing.

23
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,399
Berlin depressing?

24
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,919
What with all those
Fräuleins and Mädchens?

25
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
I should say not.

26
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,399
By Jove, I could tell you a thing
or two. Good life, yes, indeed.

27
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,959
Let's go and get
brushed up for dinner.

28
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,881
There you are, dear. Having
a stroll with the Major?

29
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,519
- Yes, Mummy.
- Evening, Mrs. Railton-Bell.

30
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,359
Good evening, Major. Had
your watch stopped, darling?

31
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,449
No, Mummy, it's going.

32
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,159
Well, the Major was telling me
all about the desert campaign.

33
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,399
Sorry to have kept your pride and
joy out in the cold, Mrs. R-B.

34
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,439
The fact is, I got
on to the old days.

35
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,479
That's the trouble with us
old retired warhorses, what?

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,489
We all talk too much.

37
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,447
Yes. Well, if you'll excuse me.

38
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,999
Sibyl, my dearest.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
Do you mind if your tactless old
mother whispers something in your ear?

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,959
No, Mummy.

41
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,087
- Such a wonderful concert this afternoon.
- Yes. I'll join you in the game room.

42
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,651
All right.

43
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,119
It's just that, do
you think it wise,

44
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,608
to make your feelings for
the Major quite so public?

45
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,319
- My feelings for the Major?
- Yes, staring at him all the time.

46
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,439
Talking to him for hours on end.
Those meetings down on the front.

47
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,449
Quite a lot of people are
beginning to notice.

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,688
You don't mean... You can't mean...

49
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,519
No. How can people be so awful?

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,279
Control yourself. Don't get
into one of your states now.

51
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,370
It's all right, Mummy.
I'm not in a state.

52
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,279
- Good evening, Mrs. Railton-Bell.
- Good evening, Miss Cooper.

53
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,839
- Good evening, Sibyl.
- Evening, Miss Cooper.

54
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,119
Dear, I think you better run
upstairs and change for dinner.

55
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,881
You know Miss Cooper
likes us to be punctual.

56
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,359
Stratton, still at it, I see.
I don't know how you do it.

57
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,119
Most praiseworthy effort.

58
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,319
Thank you, Major.

59
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,799
When I was at Sandhurst...
I'm sorry, I mustn't interrupt you.

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,079
That's all right. When
you were at Sandhurst?

61
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,479
Yes, I was just going to say,
when I was at Sandhurst

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,919
and when I was at Wellington, too,
I was a bit like you, you know.

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,279
Sweating away at the
books all the time.

64
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,079
Cramming away like mad, I was.

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,679
Military history, great
battles of the past,

66
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,799
Clausewitz and all
that sort of stuff.

67
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,439
I could have told you a
lot about Clausewitz.

68
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,959
- Really, sir? And you can't now?
- Not anymore, I'm afraid.

69
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,479
Everything goes, you know.

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,319
Still, I don't regret it.

71
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,159
I did jolly well at Sandhurst.

72
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,567
Did you get the Sword
of Honor, sir?

73
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,365
Get the what?

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,039
- The Sword of Honor.
- The Sword of Honor?

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,119
No, I came close to it, though.
Passed out pretty high.

76
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,919
You're quite right, sir.

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,439
I'm sorry, my boy.
Go on. I talk too much.

78
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,559
No, but Miss Cooper walked by
and you were looking for her.

79
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,999
Did she? Yes, I want to have a
little chat with her. Thank you.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,679
Keep up the good work.

81
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,882
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

82
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,039
There we are, Miss Cooper.

83
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,799
- What can I do for you, Major?
- Nothing important.

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,079
They're sending me a copy of the
West Hampshire Weekly News.

85
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,839
- I wondered if it had arrived.
- The West Hampshire News?

86
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,319
Yes. I'm told they have a
good page of small ads.

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,599
I might pick up a portable typewriter. I'm
taking a stab at the old war memoirs.

88
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,559
If there are bargains, one
must be quick off the mark.

89
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,959
Yes. There are some
things in my office.

90
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,719
I haven't been through
them yet. I'll have a look.

91
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,651
That's very good of you.
Thank you, Miss Cooper.

92
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,919
I can't understand it.
There's still no answer.

93
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,519
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fowler.
Will you excuse me?

94
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,079
One of your old flames, Mr. Fowler?

95
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,691
Old flames?

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,799
No, it's an old pupil
coming down for a few days.

97
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,919
I used to teach him
Classics at school.

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,239
Rather backward I thought
him in those days.

99
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,599
As far as old flames are concerned,
I leave all that to you galloping majors.

100
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,043
Those days are all past
and gone now, I'm afraid.

101
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,239
Weren't they teaching the new
pronunciation in your time at Wellington?

102
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,399
Yes, of course. I forget now.
I never was much of a hand at Greek.

103
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,728
Latin. Horace.

104
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,399
Latin. Yes, of course.
Stupid of me.

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,719
Here we are, Major.

106
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,039
Good show. Thank you, Miss Cooper.

107
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,959
I think, if you don't mind, I'd
like you to still keep the room.

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,801
- After all, he may be on the later train.
- Yes, of course.

109
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,359
And if anything has gone
wrong, which I don't believe,

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,599
I shall, of course,
expect to pay for it.

111
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,246
Will you let me know when you can?

112
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,648
By the by, Major, you were in the Highland
Division at Alamein, weren't you?

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,399
Not in the Highland Division, no.

114
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,519
- I thought you were.
- I never said so.

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,199
I was just wondering...

116
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,279
Mr. Fowler, aren't we
going to finish this game?

117
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,639
We have a shilling on
it, if you'll remember.

118
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,320
Yes, of course. Will you excuse me?

119
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,687
- Good evening, Major Pollock.
- Good evening.

120
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,039
So this is where
you've been hiding.

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,079
I was not hiding. Now just shush.

122
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,839
Forget your work for once and
let's go play billiards.

123
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,886
But, darling, the anatomy exams
come up next month. Remember?

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,530
Jean, really.

125
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Have you told your father about us?
What did you tell him?

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,839
Charles, what did you tell him?

127
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,199
For heaven's sake, that we
were in love with each other.

128
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,159
And that we're going to be married.

129
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,999
- Well, you told him a dirty lie.
- Why? I do want to marry you.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
I can never understand why...

131
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,359
You know my views on
marriage very well.

132
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,519
I intend to produce
paintings, not children.

133
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,799
And be kept in luxury by London's
most celebrated surgeon.

134
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,162
Who has failed to pass his anatomy.

135
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,159
Charles? Let's go for
a walk in the garden.

136
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,239
What? Darling, first it's
billiards, now it's a walk.

137
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,442
But it looks so romantic.

138
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,719
How can I possibly mix
anatomy with romance?

139
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,241
That shouldn't be too difficult.

140
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,963
Well, I'm obviously not
going to get any work done.

141
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,639
Come on. The dinner gong
will go in 15 minutes.

142
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,439
Where on earth are we going
to walk in 15 minutes?

143
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,768
Charles, how dim can you be?

144
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,405
I rather think we'd
better play billiards.

145
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,204
Go in, you blighter.

146
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,569
Bad luck, Mr. Fowler.

147
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,647
I only play for exercise.

148
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,484
That'll be a shilling,
please, Mr. Fowler.

149
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,519
You'll ruin me, Miss Meacham.

150
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,439
- Come on, Charles. They've finished.
- I'll take all your money.

151
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,086
Poor Mr. Fowler, has he ever won?

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,807
Once in 1948. It was her
Christmas present to him.

153
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,007
There's stuffed pork tonight.
We ought to be ready for the gong.

154
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,084
That, I expect, is young
Ridgewell at last.

155
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,959
What is it?

156
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,959
- New arrival, apparently.
- Great Scott.

157
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,639
What is it, Miss Meacham?

158
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,839
You should see for yourself.

159
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,839
Slim as a willow, dressed like a
Parisian model and not a day over 30.

160
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,442
This place is turning
into a regular nursery.

161
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,279
- Six suitcases.
- And all matching.

162
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,925
And a hatbox.

163
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,368
Mayfair from head to foot.

164
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,849
Can't think what she's doing
in a place like this.

165
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,519
- Good evening.
- Mrs. Shankland?

166
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,839
Yes, that's right.

167
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,204
Good evening. I have your reservation.
Will you sign there, please?

168
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,802
- My American address or my English?
- English, please.

169
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,721
Can you tell me if Mr. Malcolm
is in? Mr. John Malcolm?

170
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,479
He's out at present. He'll be in for
dinner. Was he expecting you?

171
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,206
No, I'd like to surprise him.

172
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,085
Well, I won't say a word. Edgar?

173
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,319
How long will you be staying?

174
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,159
I'm not quite certain as yet.

175
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,081
- Could I let you know later on?
- Yes, of course. Number 12.

176
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,410
I'll book you in just for tonight.

177
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,565
Dinner is at 7:00.
You'll hear the gong.

178
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,445
- Edgar will show you to your room.
- Thank you.

179
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,679
- You're the new one, aren't you?
- Yes.

180
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,121
- You're over there.
- Thank you.

181
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,479
Hello, Miss Cooper.

182
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,839
Major, dinner's nearly over.
Aren't you going in?

183
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,041
No.

184
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
I'm so late, I think
I'll give it a miss.

185
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,679
- Everything all right?
- Fine, everything's on the top line.

186
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,283
I got to thinking about those memoirs.
Time rather ran away, I'm afraid.

187
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,079
I found one or two
portable typewriters.

188
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,406
Good.

189
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,079
I don't suppose the West Hampshire
Weekly News is much read, is it?

190
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,250
What? Mrs. Railton-Bell
takes it every week.

191
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,479
Does she? Whatever for?

192
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,599
There's not a lot
goes on in the world,

193
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,879
even in West Hampshire,
that she cares to miss.

194
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,879
And she can afford fourpence
for the information.

195
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,959
I suppose so.

196
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,959
Funny, I've never seen
her reading it. Have you?

197
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,759
There's a lot of stuff she has
sent in she doesn't read.

198
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,406
Most of it she leaves
on this table.

199
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,559
You mean, her copy's
been here all the time?

200
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,399
No, Major, that'll be sent
up with the evening papers.

201
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,559
Well, dash it all.

202
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,639
I've wasted fourpence for nothing.

203
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,799
I mean, I could have borrowed hers.

204
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,879
Sorry, mustn't keep you gossiping.

205
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,719
Well, thanks again. Cheery-bye.

206
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,081
Major.

207
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,919
- I thought we were going upstairs.
- We've just finished dinner.

208
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,439
I don't see what that
has to do with it.

209
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,079
This is more important, dear.

210
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,567
That's a terrible thing to say.

211
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,159
There, now.

212
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,839
Wipe the lipstick off.
The old girls might notice.

213
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,879
Even the old girls know
the facts of life.

214
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,686
They may know them,
but they don't like them.

215
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,119
If you would only marry me,

216
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,119
we wouldn't have to worry
about the old girls.

217
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,279
We wouldn't have to
worry about anything.

218
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,319
We could lead a nice,
normal, peaceful existence.

219
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,839
Damn, here they come.

220
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,646
Not so much the pork
as the stuffing.

221
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,611
Excuse me.

222
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,810
Good evening.

223
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,162
Look at them. There's your
normal, peaceful existence.

224
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,925
Darling.

225
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,319
Conventions and marriage.
I don't want to end up like them.

226
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,727
Will you shut up? They'll hear you.

227
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,559
I've figured it all out.

228
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,839
Life isn't meant to be
dreary, but exciting...

229
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,690
Will you shut up?

230
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,087
Bed.

231
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,999
I'm on the trickiest duct
in the whole human body.

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,119
Now, please.

233
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,367
Bed.

234
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
Come on.

235
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,400
Good night, ladies.

236
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,009
Good night. Sleep tight.

237
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,651
Surely, a somewhat unnecessary
remark, Gladys dear.

238
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,079
They're old friends. They're
just here to study.

239
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,799
That's what they told Miss Cooper.

240
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,279
I think it most unwise of
her to have them here.

241
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,086
Even at opposite ends
of the corridor.

242
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,719
- Quite obvious they were making love.
- How do you know?

243
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,924
He was putting a handkerchief
away with lipstick on it.

244
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,729
Well, perhaps they are in love.

245
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,043
Why don't they say so?
I hate anything furtive.

246
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,727
Now, what were we talking about?

247
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,805
Good gracious.

248
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,560
Please shut that door,
there's a most terrible draft.

249
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:33,481
A draft? Bless my soul,
so there jolly well is.

250
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,566
- He's so amusing.
- He's drunk.

251
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,839
A brilliant observation,
Mrs. Railton-Bell.

252
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,719
I'm sure she didn't mean...

253
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,359
Lady Matheson. It's nice to
have a champion, thank you.

254
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,881
But she's right. Irish Whiskey.

255
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,321
Hello, Sibyl, how are
you this evening?

256
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,279
Without the Irish Whiskey,
I'd not have broken my record.

257
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,599
I made it back here from the Feathers
bar in six minutes flat instead of ten.

258
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,079
I had the wind at my back.

259
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,999
But as you and I know,
Mrs. Railton-Bell, we cannot deny

260
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,159
the propulsive powers
of Irish Whiskey.

261
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,479
Scotch, on the other hand...

262
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,650
Mr. Malcolm, did you come in
through the French windows?

263
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,207
Miss Cooper, I cannot tell a lie.

264
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,329
You know that is strictly
forbidden after 7:00.

265
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,359
I'm sorry, I'd forgotten.

266
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,519
There's mud all over the floor.

267
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,439
Please hang this in
the proper place.

268
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,559
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,959
Also, wipe your feet on the mat
provided for that purpose.

270
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,525
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,359
I'm so sorry. I shall see
this doesn't happen again.

272
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,599
I must say, quite
frankly, Miss Cooper,

273
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,039
I've never understood how you
could tolerate such boorishness,

274
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,159
and have done all this time.

275
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,199
In a hotel, one must tolerate
all sorts of things.

276
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,479
I suppose so.

277
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,319
But one hardly expects to find that
kind of person in this kind of hotel.

278
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,879
Why he should have selected the
Beauregard as a permanent residence

279
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,319
is quite beyond me.

280
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,922
He was stationed near here
during the war, I believe.

281
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,328
He used to stay here then.

282
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,799
He writes very nicely.

283
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,679
I read an article of his once. Just
out of curiosity. It was about labor.

284
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,959
Have you ever read...

285
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,209
I have no curiosity about
the working classes.

286
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,009
How many have you had?

287
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,129
Two. Well, three.

288
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,847
Definitely not more than four.

289
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,206
I'm sorry, Pat. I know I shouldn't.

290
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,680
You know that I love you,
don't you? Very sincerely.

291
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,919
That sounds like what a
brother says to a sister.

292
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,039
Sister? You know my feelings
for you go beyond that.

293
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,159
Just how far beyond, John?

294
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,239
Well, I had a dim recollection
we were engaged, or hadn't I?

295
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,363
I rather wondered if you had.

296
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,079
- What's the matter?
- I don't know what you mean.

297
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,560
Come on, now,
something's the matter.

298
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,599
After all, most women feel rather
odd about a proposal of marriage,

299
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,199
especially if they hear it once rather late
at night and the man has had a few drinks.

300
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,609
- We'll announce it publicly, right now.
- No, John.

301
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,039
- What?
- There's someone...

302
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,287
Yes?

303
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,767
Despite the hour and the
drink, you did mean it?

304
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,279
Have dinner. I told cook
to keep you something hot.

305
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,759
Let's walk to the beach.

306
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,119
- Darling, I can't. I've got to close up...
- Let's walk down to the beach tonight.

307
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,130
Ask me again when
you've had your coffee.

308
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,485
Miss Meacham.

309
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,971
You in, at last? Thank heavens.

310
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,523
The park's off, and the
goulash is drying out,

311
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,879
but we kept you some soup.

312
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,529
What a pity young Ridgewell wasn't here.
He'd have enjoyed the turnover.

313
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,599
The cook's acquiring a lighter touch
with her pastry, don't you think?

314
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,439
Not judging by the tarts
we had at tea yesterday.

315
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,371
Cannon balls. Simply cannon balls.

316
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,047
Here we are, tuck into that
while I get the goulash.

317
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,367
Not for what I wouldn't think
you'd had your liquid already.

318
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,839
What are you doing here?

319
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,166
Surprised?

320
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,279
I gave up being surprised
by you five years ago.

321
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,404
You gave up a lot of
things five years ago.

322
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,199
Is this your year for
looking up old husbands?

323
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,765
Only the special ones.

324
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,119
I ran into some friends of
ours at a party in London.

325
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,479
Friends of ours?

326
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,284
All right, mine.

327
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,519
They said you were having a rough
time getting along these days.

328
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,359
That's why I'm here.
I wanted to help you.

329
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,131
Well, that's really touching.
I'm overwhelmed.

330
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,559
Goulash. Aren't you
going to eat your soup?

331
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,922
I'll have two bowls tomorrow.

332
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,609
Tomato aspic tomorrow.

333
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,930
Don't take long, will you?
My friend's waiting.

334
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,439
Now, is there anything else?

335
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,479
You find it impossible to
believe I care about you.

336
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,199
Not impossible, Ann,
just incredible.

337
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,199
Call it selfish if you want.

338
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,846
But I'd feel better if I could
make up in some way for the past.

339
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,519
What is this, a bribe to
ease your conscience?

340
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,529
Now look, John, I...

341
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,759
I'm not saying who was right
or wrong over what happened.

342
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,167
I'm only concerned
seeing you like this.

343
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,485
You'll forget all about it by the
time you reach London tomorrow.

344
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,965
- Tomorrow?
- You are leaving in the morning?

345
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,879
Why yes, of course, if you like.

346
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,128
Fine. That's settled then.

347
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,927
What do you possibly do here?

348
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,530
I enjoy one great luxury,
being left alone.

349
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,487
Well, it's a quaint spot you've
picked out for yourself.

350
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,039
Your last husband would have
done wonders with this place.

351
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,079
Interior decorator, wasn't he?

352
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,759
When he worked.

353
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,839
How long were you married to him?

354
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,639
Two years and six months.

355
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,322
Beats us by three months.
Cruelty again, wasn't it?

356
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,530
A legal device.

357
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,159
You mean he didn't break down
the bedroom door to get at you?

358
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,523
No. He didn't try
to kill me, either.

359
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,519
I saw the headlines of the divorce.

360
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,119
Educating, but not nearly so
sensational as ours, you'll admit.

361
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,319
You were interested
enough to read about it?

362
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,039
Reading worthless items is a bad
habit I picked up in prison.

363
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,925
You see, there was nothing else to do.
My wife never came to see me.

364
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,081
I only did what I thought
was best for you.

365
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,811
You know something, Ann? No one I
know of lies with such sincerity.

366
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,639
Now, if you'll excuse me.

367
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,481
Do you know what I think?
I think you've found a new girl.

368
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,119
The morning train leaves at 10:45.

369
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,288
You must like her a lot.

370
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,250
I do. I'm going to marry her.

371
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,926
John,

372
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,359
don't misunderstand.

373
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,121
I think it's really wonderful
you've found someone else.

374
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,199
I didn't mean any harm.

375
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,640
That's when you do the most damage.

376
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,639
- We all make mistakes.
- You specialize in them.

377
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,679
Only little ones, though.

378
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,399
I still have a scar on the side of my
head to remind me of one of yours.

379
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,250
Five years should cure most scars.

380
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,521
Most, I suppose. Not all, though.

381
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,649
Well, I may not see
you in the morning.

382
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,243
- Shall we say goodbye now?
- I think we've said it.

383
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,131
I'm awfully glad to
see you again, John.

384
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,362
What are you laughing at?

385
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,291
That was an innocent kiss.
You have nothing I want.

386
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,199
I'm happily engaged to be married, and
came to England to meet his family.

387
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,319
He's everything I want in a man.

388
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,524
He doesn't have to turn
a wild beast to prove it.

389
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,008
Now you must feel as
foolish as you look.

390
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,521
John.

391
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,928
If you didn't want to see the program,
dear, you should have said so.

392
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,879
Caught in the act, what?

393
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,519
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. R-B.

394
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,839
There was something in the Evening
Standard I wanted to look at.

395
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,929
I'm afraid I
appropriated your copy.

396
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,119
Would you mind if I
borrowed it for a minute?

397
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,239
That isn't the Evening
Standard, Major.

398
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,319
It's what?

399
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,285
No. It's the West
Hampshire Weekly News.

400
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,443
I'm absolutely blithered.
What an astonishing thing.

401
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,119
I must have pulled
out the wrong paper.

402
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,039
Mea culpa. My fault. I can't
understand how I did that.

403
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,890
Neither do I. There's
quite a difference.

404
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,679
Yes. Indeed. The West Hampshire
News is hardly my cup of tea. What?

405
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,279
Well, is it all right then, if I borrow
your Standard for a little while?

406
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,399
If you return it.

407
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,879
Jolly decent of you, Mrs. R-B.
Thank you so much.

408
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,479
After that, I think I'll go
take a look at some telly.

409
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,559
I understand there's a
new quiz program on.

410
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,599
A small boy of nine
just won over £40.

411
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,959
Yes, I hear he's very clever.

412
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,731
- Shall I be seeing you in there?
- Yes.

413
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,639
No, I'd forgotten.
I have to write a letter.

414
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,083
I see. Well, cheery-bye, both.

415
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,679
I wish he wouldn't use that revolting
expression. It's so common.

416
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,559
Of course, he's such an
awfully common little man.

417
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,999
No, Mummy. Do you think so?

418
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
He was in a very good regiment.

419
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,691
You can be in the Horse Guards,
dear, and still be common.

420
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,439
I don't know what you see in him.

421
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,679
It's just that I like all
his stories about the war

422
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,199
and the desert and the regiment.

423
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,165
He's seen so much of
life, and I haven't.

424
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,359
I don't know what you mean
by that, dear, I'm sure.

425
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,210
I only meant...

426
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,524
I'm sorry, Mummy.

427
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,039
I realize that you must occasionally miss
some of the little gaieties of life.

428
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,839
Balls and cocktail parties

429
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,039
and things that a few other
lucky young people can enjoy.

430
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,519
I do my best, you know.

431
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,839
I know you do, Mummy.

432
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,999
There was Scotland last year, and our
Scandinavian cruise the year before.

433
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,569
I know, Mummy. Please, don't
think that I'm not grateful.

434
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,205
- It's only...
- Only what, dear?

435
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,402
If only I could do something.

436
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,319
Mummy, there's an advertisement in the
newspaper for a telephone operator.

437
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,159
My dear, we've been
over this so often.

438
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,204
You'd never stand it,
even for a few days.

439
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,559
You remember Jones and Jones?

440
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,039
Yes. But it was so stifling hot there
in the basement of Jones and Jones.

441
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,971
This job in the
newspaper is different.

442
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,559
Now, you're not a very strong child.
You must try and get that into your head.

443
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,639
Your nervous system isn't nearly
as sound as it should be.

444
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,679
You, mean my "states."

445
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,399
But I haven't had one of
those for a long time.

446
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,490
I know, dear. You've
been very good, indeed.

447
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,959
But there's quite a difference
in not having an hysterical fit

448
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,367
and being able to keep a job.

449
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,966
Now, fetch me that
newspaper, will you, dear?

450
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,405
Yes, Mummy.

451
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,799
- Which one do you want?
- The West Hampshire Weekly News.

452
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,159
I want to see what the Major
was so interested in.

453
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,919
Dear, what a silly-billy.

454
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,851
I've gone and left
my glasses upstairs.

455
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,919
Shall I go and get them for you?

456
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,399
Will you, dear? That
would be so kind of you.

457
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,879
I hate you fetching
and carrying for me.

458
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,439
But you know, my poor old
legs are a bit tired.

459
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,839
I think you'll find them
on the table by my bed.

460
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,451
Yes, Mummy.

461
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,599
My dear, there's the most wonderful
quiz program on television.

462
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,479
- There's a little boy...
- Gladys, have you got your glasses?

463
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,199
- Yes, dear.
- Good. I idiotically left mine upstairs.

464
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,448
Here, read this out to me.

465
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,720
- "Cab driver loses license."
- No. "Ex-officer pleads guilty."

466
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,200
"Ex-officer pleads guilty.
Offense in theater."

467
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,599
- My dear, do we really want to read this?
- Yes, we do. Go on.

468
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,964
- But what about the television?
- This is infinitely more important.

469
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,079
"On Thursday last, before
the Bournemouth magistrate,

470
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,159

00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,519
He must've been drinking.

477
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,199
No. He only drinks one
glass of port a day.

478
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,279

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,119
"During the whole of the war,
he had held a responsible position

501
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,403
"in an army supply depot
in the West indies."

502
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,884
The whole of the war?

503
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,687
Yes, dear. I heard you. Go on.

504
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,968
"In 1946, he had been demobilized
with the rank of full lieutenant.

505
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,839
"The defendant was not called.

506
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,159
"The Chairman of the Bench,
giving judgment, said,

507
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,839
"'You've behaved disgustingly, but as
this seems to be your first offense,

508
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,759
"'we propose to deal
leniently with you.'

509
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,203
"The defendant was put on
probation for 12 months."

510
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,966
Dear.

511
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,679
He must have thought he'd
gotten away with it.

512
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,439
What a stroke of luck
I take this paper.

513
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,563
Luck? Was it luck?

514
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,891
I almost...

515
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,844
Dear, poor Sibyl.

516
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,050
- Maud, you must not tell her.
- Not tell her?

517
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,686
Not the details.
Not about the theater.

518
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,679
I don't know how I shall ever
look him in the face again.

519
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,119
You won't have to, dear.

520
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,839
I'll insist to Miss Cooper
that he leave the hotel

521
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,879
before luncheon time tomorrow.

522
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,199
Maud, do you think you ought to?

523
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,599
What's come over you this evening?
Of course I ought to.

524
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,771
You know what Miss Cooper is.
She's so independent and stubborn.

525
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,839
Perhaps she won't agree.

526
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,522
- She'll have to if we all insist.
- We don't all insist.

527
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,965
Well, I mean, there's
only the two of us.

528
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,727
Should we consult the others?

529
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,439
That means we shall
have to tell them.

530
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,199
An excellent idea. Let's go
and get them all together.

531
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,599
Sorry it took so long.
Here are your glasses.

532
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,199
You found them, clever girl.
I don't need them now.

533
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,210
Gladys, go and see who's
in the game room.

534
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,319
Mrs. Shankland. We'd like you to
come to a meeting in the lounge.

535
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,729
- But I...
- I'll tell you all about it in a moment.

536
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,048
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

537
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,079
Am I reading your magazine?

538
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,965
No. You go right
ahead, Mrs. Shankland.

539
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,319
I didn't expect to find a
fashion magazine here.

540
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,967
- Does Miss Cooper take it?
- No. It's...

541
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,879
It's yours, isn't it?

542
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,127
Yes.

543
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,959
You must forgive me
for staring at you,

544
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,130
but you look so beautiful,
I really couldn't help it.

545
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,799
Thank you very much.

546
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,162
You look just like the
pictures in the magazine.

547
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,439
But my picture hasn't been in
a magazine, not for years.

548
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,239
But I remember them.

549
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,319
And I've always wondered who you were,
and the exciting kind of life you led.

550
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,159
You look just the same.
Just as lovely.

551
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,079
Well, thank you. That's
very sweet of you.

552
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,319
I recognized you the
moment that you came...

553
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,559
Sibyl?

554
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,569
Yes, Mummy. I'm here.

555
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,759
Forgive me for staring at you.
It was very rude.

556
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,284
Sibyl, dear. I think you had better
go to your room, if you don't mind.

557
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,439
But why, Mummy?

558
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,282
Because we're having a meeting in here
with some of the regular residents,

559
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,171
to discuss a matter
of grave urgency

560
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,279
which has just cropped up.

561
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,479
How exciting. Can't I stay?
After all, I'm a regular, too.

562
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,159
Yes, I know, dear.

563
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,199
But I don't think the subject
is at all suitable for you.

564
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,962
- If this is to be a meeting of the residents...
- No, please, Mrs. Shankland.

565
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,999
Although you're temporary, we'd like
you to feel that you're one of us.

566
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,399
And as a woman of the world,
we would value your advice.

567
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,319
But what is it, Mummy?

568
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,887
What an inquisitive child it is.

569
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,327
Well, I'll tell you this much.
But only this much.

570
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,560
It concerns your friend, the
Major, and it's extremely grave.

571
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,999
But I don't understand.
What is it, Mummy?

572
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,999
I'm not going to tell you more.
It might upset you too much.

573
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,199
I must know, Mummy. I must...

574
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,319
Please, don't raise your voice so, dear.
You really insist I should tell you?

575
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,719
Yes, Mummy. I do.

576
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,764
- Even after my strong warning?
- Yes, Mummy.

577
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,321
Very well then, I've no option.

578
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,005
Read that, middle column,
top of the page.

579
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,209
I couldn't find...

580
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,199
Maud, you haven't told her.

581
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,847
I did my best, but she
absolutely insisted.

582
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,759
My dear, I'm so sorry. Must
be a dreadful shock for you.

583
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,043
It was for us, too.
Are you all right?

584
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,562
Sibyl, are you all right?

585
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,485
Yes, Mummy.

586
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,280
Sibyl, you've broken my glasses.

587
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,919
And you've cut your hand.

588
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,929
Here, let me see it.

589
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,359
I think you'd better
wrap this around it.

590
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,439
It's only a scratch, that's
much too fine a handkerchief.

591
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,325
That's all right.
I have another in my bag.

592
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,119
Well now, shall we all sit down?

593
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,639
Mr. Fowler, would you draw
up that chair, please?

594
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,119
Where are the others?

595
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,599
I couldn't find anyone else. Edgar's
gone to look for Mr. Malcolm.

596
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,479
I shouldn't have bothered.
He always has so much to say.

597
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,444
Now, let us all be seated.

598
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,005
Who, it turns out, was only a
lieutenant in the Service Supply Depot

599
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,559
and was arrested in the cinema.

600
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,728
I can't believe it. Incredible.

601
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,359
The question now becomes,
"What are we going to do about it?"

602
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,804
The Major will be watching TV for a while,
and we don't want to be interrupted.

603
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,959
I feel we should act firmly
and quickly to rid ourselves

604
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,359
of this dangerous
person in our midst.

605
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,009
I must admit, I always suspected
the public school education.

606
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,439
Only this evening, he made a most
shocking mistake in quoting Horace.

607
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,559
- Please.
- Quite appalling.

608
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,839
Please, Mr. Fowler, we're
getting away from the subject.

609
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,159
The ugly fact remains that
this fellow resident of ours

610
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,479
was arrested and found guilty.

611
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,999
Pleaded guilty.

612
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,319
Please, Gladys.

613
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,679
Found or pleaded guilty
to a disgusting offense.

614
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,519
Which fellow resident?
What disgusting offense?

615
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,371
I don't think this is a matter that
would interest you, Mr. Malcolm.

616
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,199
It seems to interest
our newest resident.

617
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,159
I don't see why it shouldn't
interest one of our oldest.

618
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,039
Very well. If you must know, Major
Pollock has behaved immorally

619
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,245
to no less than six respectable
women in a local cinema.

620
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,722
Six? Well, that's
quite a performance.

621
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,999
Really, Maud, on behalf of
the Major, I must remind you

622
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,489
we only know that one was respectable,
the one who made the complaint.

623
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,159
And even she behaved very oddly. Why
didn't she say right out to the Major,

624
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,879
"Will you please stop doing
whatever it is you are doing?"

625
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,279
That's what I would have done.

626
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,199
And we don't know anything
about the others.

627
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,563
We don't even know that he
nudged them or anything.

628
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,519
Of course he nudged them.

629
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,359
He was in that cinema
for an immoral purpose.

630
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,879
He admitted it.

631
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,039
And he was seen to change his
seat no less than five times

632
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,039
always choosing one next
to a female person.

633
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,119
Let's see. That would make
10 nudges, wouldn't it?

634
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,039
If he used both elbows. No, 11 with
the original one. Or 12 supposing...

635
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,609
I consider this flippancy, on a matter
so serious, as utterly monstrous.

636
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,399
You're right, it is serious
for the poor Major.

637
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,399
What are you proposing?
Have him thrown out of the hotel?

638
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,239
I'm proposing to ask the opinion
of the other residents.

639
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,799
I plainly have no
need to ask yours.

640
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,119
I don't know why you say that.

641
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,639
I feel repelled by
what the Major's done.

642
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,799
I've always had an intense
dislike for, shall we say,

643
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,359
the more furtive forms
of sexual expression.

644
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,119
I think it's only fair to ask
ourselves this question,

645
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,959
what harm has the man done?

646
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,839
Apart from bruising the
elbow of a certain lady

647
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,119
whose motives in complaining,
I agree with Lady Matheson,

648
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,799
are extremely questionable.

649
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,722
Apart from that and telling us a few
rather pathetic lies about his past life,

650
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,199
which most of us do from
time to time anyway,

651
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,679
I can't see what he's done to justify
being thrown into the street.

652
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,959
Then it's obvious you're
against any action at all.

653
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,719
Well, I might give him a
cool glance at dinner.

654
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,759
I think your attitude is shocking.

655
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,007
Do you? Why?

656
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,887
What's he done that's worse than
people who cheapen lovemaking,

657
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,328
who use it as a weapon
to get what they want?

658
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,119
No, Mrs. Railton-Bell, I'm sure
there are people in this very room,

659
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,879
who have done their fellow man
more harm than the Major.

660
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,570
I don't agree.

661
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,799
I'm sorry. Just forget
I said anything.

662
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,559
That's quite all
right, Mrs. Shankland.

663
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,445
I'm sure that anything that you have
to say will be right to the point.

664
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,879
It wouldn't be fair.

665
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,051
I don't even know the Major.
We are talking about the Major?

666
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,639
We are indeed.

667
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,159
Now that we've heard your views
on the subject, Mr. Malcolm,

668
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,519
odd, distasteful and dangerous
though they may be,

669
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,802
it's time we heard from
the others. Mr. Fowler?

670
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,439
Well, it's very difficult.

671
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,479
I don't see what's
difficult about it.

672
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,969
But it is, you know. I can't say
that I see it like Malcolm.

673
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,039
Certain acts are wrong because
they are, in themselves

674
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,891
and by themselves,
impure and immoral.

675
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,999
It seems to me that this terrible
wave of vice and sexual excess

676
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,759
which has been flooding
the world since the war

677
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,760
might in part be due to the
decline of the old standards.

678
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,527
Tolerance is not necessarily a good.
Tolerance of evil can itself be an evil.

679
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,959
After all, wasn't it
Aristotle who said...

680
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,643
Really, you've all gone
on far too long about it.

681
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,079
And when you start quoting Aristotle,
personally, I'm going to me room.

682
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,599
You heard, Miss Meacham?

683
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,399
I couldn't help hearing.
I didn't want to.

684
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,839
I was doing me betting system.

685
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,044
You need to concentrate
like billyo on that.

686
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,439
I had my chair against the
wall to catch the light.

687
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,279
I certainly wasn't going to get
eyestrain just for you people.

688
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,599
As you know the facts, perhaps
we'd better canvass your opinion.

689
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,962
I haven't any. Why should I?

690
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,927
I've been out of the world far
longer than any of you...

691
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,971
And what do I know of
morals and ethics?

692
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,319
Only what I read in novels,
and as I only read thrillers,

693
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,439
that doesn't amount to much.

694
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,399
In Mickey Spillane, the hero does far worse
things to his girls than the Major's done

695
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,239
and no one seems to mind.

696
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,719
It's hardly to the point

697
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,481
what Mr. Spillane's heroes do
to his girls, Miss Meacham.

698
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,002
We want your views
on Major Pollock.

699
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,886
Do you?

700
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,568
My views on Major Pollock have always
been that he's a crashing old bore

701
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,849
and a wicked old fraud.

702
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,445
Now I hear he's a dirty old man,
too, I'm not at all surprised.

703
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,003
And quite between these four
walls, I don't give a damn.

704
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,048
Sad. Very sad.

705
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,964
Well, Mr. Fowler, I take it you
are on the side of action?

706
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,044
I once had to recommend
a boy for expulsion.

707
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,319
Only once, in all the 15
years I was a housemaster.

708
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,251
Are you in favor of
action, Mr. Fowler?

709
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,126
Yes, I suppose so.

710
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,130
Yes, I am.

711
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,561
Gladys?

712
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,599
Oh, dear.

713
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,079
There you go, shilly-shallying
again, Gladys.

714
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,479
Make up your mind.

715
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,239
Are you with Mr. Malcolm
and his defense of vice,

716
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,241
or on the side of the Christian
virtues, like Mr. Fowler and myself?

717
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,725
Never in my life have I heard a
question so disgracefully begged.

718
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,319
You should be in politics,
Mrs. Railton-Bell.

719
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,726
Gladys?

720
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,925
Of course I am on your side,
dear. It's only that...

721
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Mr. Malcolm, apart from Miss
Meacham and Mrs. Shankland,

722
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,767
who may be counted as neutral,
the count is four-to-one against you.

723
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,319
Shall we all go and see
Miss Cooper in a body

724
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,763
or would you rather that I
acted as your spokesman?

725
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,479
I think perhaps,
dear, if you went...

726
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,839
Yes. Perhaps that would be best.

727
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,280
Well,

728
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,408
it's a duty I hardly relish.

729
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,331
Just a moment, Mrs. Railton-Bell.
We haven't heard from your daughter.

730
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,079
My daughter agrees with me.
I know her feelings on the subject.

731
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,919
I think she should be permitted
to speak for herself.

732
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,361
Sibyl, can we have your views?

733
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,366
- Mr. Malcolm is speaking to you, dear.
- Yes, Mummy.

734
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,849
Can we have your views?

735
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,799
MY views?

736
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,679
On Major Pollock, dear.

737
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,486
What action should
we take about him?

738
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,450
It's the shock.

739
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,731
You know what you've just
read in the paper, dear.

740
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,048
What do you feel about it?

741
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,639
It made me sick.

742
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,959
Of course it did.
That's how we all feel.

743
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,764
It made me sick.

744
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,279
It made me sick!

745
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,439
Stop that, Sibyl. Now, darling...

746
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,719
- it made me sick. I don't feel well.
- Of course you don't, dear.

747
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,319
It made me sick.

748
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,047
Come, we'll go up to
our room and lie down.

749
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,479
Is she often like that?

750
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,889
No, not often. But
sometimes, I'm afraid.

751
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,765
Her mother ought to
never have told her.

752
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,159
I'm surprised at you, Mr. Malcolm.

753
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,079
You ought not to have
brought her into it.

754
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,770
I suppose not.

755
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,639
I thought I might get her,
once in the whole of her life

756
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,491
to publicly disagree
with her mother.

757
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,608
It could save her
soul if she ever did.

758
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,606
Poor child. The whole
affair is too dreadful.

759
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,719
It's made me quite miserable.

760
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,359
Yes. The trouble about
being on the side of right

761
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,559
as one sees it, is that
one often finds oneself

762
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,889
in the company of such
very questionable allies.

763
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,719
There's nothing to be
done about it now.

764
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,239
Your young friend Mr. Ridgewell,
he never telephoned?

765
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,159
He could still turn up.

766
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,959
I can hear the front
doorbell, you know.

767
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,881
And, of course, with all this,
I won't get a wink of sleep.

768
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,606
I wish he'd taken the
trouble to call.

769
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,329
You're making it a bit
too obvious, you know,

770
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,086
that you hate the very sight of me.

771
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,844
The very sight of you, Ann, is perhaps
the one thing about you I don't hate.

772
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,525
Please, John, don't
be so ill-mannered.

773
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,250
All this fencing is a
bit idiotic, isn't it?

774
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,759
I am leaving in the morning.

775
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,919
And I wouldn't be here if I'd known
you were going to be married.

776
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,879
Credit me with some degree of tact.

777
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,290
I do. You were always very tactful,
especially about my bad manners.

778
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,559
I never mentioned your manners.

779
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,843
Incidentally, if you
disliked me so intensely,

780
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,640
why did you ever marry
me in the first place?

781
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,239
Do you want it reaffirmed
after all these years?

782
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,479
Does your vanity need it that much?

783
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,523
I wanted you desperately.

784
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,279
I craved you so violently that
I could deny you nothing.

785
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,239
Not even a marriage that was
bound to end in disaster.

786
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,519
Why disaster?

787
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,479
Ann, it's a long way from a Pennsylvania
steel town to Upper Park Avenue.

788
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,599
Class distinction? You always
claimed it never existed.

789
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,119
Until I married you.

790
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,719
Then I really found
out how wrong I was.

791
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,279
My ideas of a wife were influenced by
watching my mother ruin her health,

792
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,919
to bring up eight kids.

793
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,879
My demands on you wouldn't
have been that high

794
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,199
but would've included properly
running a home and bearing children.

795
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,639
About children, I did make
it perfectly clear...

796
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,119
I know. The beautiful fashion model.
That little hobby of yours.

797
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,244
Your figure was too important
to risk for posterity.

798
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,239
I accepted the deal.
I've no complaints.

799
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,249
But you know you have, John.

800
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,639
The same complaint as always, that
I didn't love you when we married.

801
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,839
Please. Let's not go into that.

802
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,328
Why would I have married
you, if I didn't love you?

803
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,883
After all, there were others.
More important men.

804
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,359
They couldn't pay
you the full price.

805
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,479
What price?

806
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,045
Enslavement.

807
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,931
John, really. How
ridiculous you are.

808
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,199
If all I wanted to do was
to make my husband a slave,

809
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,528
why would I have chosen
you and not the others?

810
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,810
Because where would the fun have
been, enslaving men like that?

811
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,479
A tame millionaire.
A mincing baronet.

812
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,639
Too polite to say anything when
denied their conjugal rights.

813
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,039
Too polite not to take
your headaches at bedtime

814
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,799
as just headaches at bedtime.

815
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,721
Where would the fun have been, turning
your weapons on men like that?

816
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,199
No, Ann, you were reaching
into another class.

817
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,801
You were looking for wilder game.

818
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,959
Remember how you introduced
me to your friends?

819
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,039
"My wild roaring savage"?

820
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,359
That was always good for a laugh.

821
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,039
To turn your weapons on him,
to make him sit up and beg

822
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,479
at the whispered promise
of what was his by right.

823
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,399
To goad him to such a rage

824
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,399
that he'd kick open your bedroom
door and nearly kill you.

825
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,967
That really must have been fun.

826
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,810
Forgive me, Ann.

827
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,722
I don't get many chances at
speechmaking these days.

828
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,323
Besides, I'm a little
drunker than usual tonight.

829
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,207
Because of seeing me?

830
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,446
Yes.

831
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,131
I'm sorry.

832
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,331
No, you're not.

833
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,759
You haven't changed much.

834
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,325
Haven't I?

835
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,599
The same old John, pouring out
the same old cascade of truths,

836
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,370
half-truths and distortions.

837
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,443
Human nature isn't as simple
as you make it, John.

838
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,010
You left out the most
important fact of all.

839
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,928
You see, you're the only person in the
world I've ever really been fond of.

840
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,440
Notice how tactfully I
leave out the word "love."

841
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,690
Give me a cigarette.

842
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,922
No, not those awful cheap things.

843
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,610
Hand me my bag.

844
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,604
Do you dispute that?

845
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,366
Your fondness for me was sometimes
shown in surprising ways.

846
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,639
Why are you staring at me?

847
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,968
You know perfectly well why.

848
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,210
Well, don't. It makes
me embarrassed.

849
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,199
You really think I
haven't changed much?

850
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,919
To look at, I mean?

851
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,485
Not at all.

852
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,519
Just the clever makeup, I expect.

853
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,159
I don't think so.

854
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,639
I still think you're the most beautiful,
most desirable woman I've ever known.

855
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,320
John, I really think you mean that.

856
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,365
You know,

857
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,199
some of the things you said might
happen to me are happening.

858
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,640
Such as?

859
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,759
Loneliness, for one.

860
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,851
- No friends?
- Not many. I haven't the gift.

861
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,043
What about your fiancé?

862
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,249
You really think I'm
in love with him?

863
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,842
It's always been you, John.

864
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,650
All these years.

865
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,684
It's so wonderful seeing
you again like this.

866
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,967
I'm only sorry it's too late.

867
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,767
If only I could just
stay on a little while.

868
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,963
I won't be a nuisance.

869
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,129
Really I won't, John.

870
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,130
Darling, please.

871
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,323
This is a public place.

872
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,291
Anyone might come
out at any moment.

873
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,961
There's no one here for it to
make any difference to me.

874
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,288
I was just thinking of you.

875
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,010
Miss Cooper has given me what
appears to be a very isolated room,

876
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,402
the number of which is 12.

877
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,005
Shall we go?

878
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,082
How do I look? All right?

879
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,439
All right.

880
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,839
Mrs. Shankland, you're
wanted on the telephone.

881
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,008
It's a call from London.

882
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,611
Thank you.

883
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,285
- You know where the telephone is?
- Yes, I do. Thank you very much.

884
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,081
You knew who she was, didn't you?

885
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,041
Yes.

886
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,488
I must say, she's exactly
as you described her to me.

887
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,399
"Carved in ice," you once said.

888
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,761
Did I?

889
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,004
So that's the woman who
smashed up your life.

890
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,519
She didn't, Pat.
I smashed up my own life.

891
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,439
- If I hadn't been the sort of man I am...
- I know the sort of man you are.

892
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,679
And the sort of woman she is.

893
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,726
- In all the years I've known you...
- You don't know me at all.

894
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,084
I'm sorry, Pat,

895
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,971
but blaming her isn't
going to help.

896
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,321
I see.

897
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,959
I always knew in my heart you
were still in love with her.

898
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,970
- Pat...
- Don't say anything.

899
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,008
I've known it all along.

900
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,164
Will you be going away with her?

901
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,641
I don't know. I don't know
anything about the future.

902
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,083
Yes, I expect you will.

903
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,004
She looks as if she's got
some willpower, that girl.

904
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,239
If she's taken the trouble to run you to
earth down here, she won't let go easily.

905
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,331
She didn't run me to earth, Pat.
She came down here to help me.

906
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,239
You really believe that?

907
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,205
She was going to be married.
Her fiance is in London.

908
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,131
- And she came here to help you?
- Yes.

909
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,366
It doesn't strike you as strange?

910
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,566
All right, let's leave it at that.

911
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,159
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

912
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,559
- Tell me.
- No.

913
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,279
- What is it? Tell me.
- Don't knock me about. I'm not her.

914
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,479
Now I'll ask you a question.

915
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,639
- Does she know about us?
- No.

916
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,319
You're sure of that?

917
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,799
I told her I was engaged,
but I didn't say to whom.

918
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,119
The only one who'd know about us
is your publisher, David Wilder.

919
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,559
That's right.

920
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,969
She's talking to Mr. Wilder
on the telephone now.

921
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,799
- John, listen.
- It's all right. I want to talk to her.

922
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,367
- Please.
- I've got to talk to her.

923
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,211
Miss Cooper, I've
been waiting for you.

924
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,919
It's a matter of vital importance.
I can't go into it here.

925
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,919
- I ask you to read this.
- Very well.

926
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,199
I may add that I've taken a
consensus of the residents.

927
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,279
We are virtually unanimous

928
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,159
that the gentleman in
question be asked to leave

929
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,885
before lunchtime tomorrow.

930
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,160
Come in.

931
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,167
I'll just be a minute, darling.

932
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,125
Goodness, you didn't
give me much time.

933
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,965
I can wait.

934
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,599
There's some brandy on the
bureau, if you'd like.

935
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,770
But I really don't think
you should, do you?

936
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,919
No.

937
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,770
That's a good boy.

938
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,445
Darling John.

939
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,924
Listen. You can hear
the waves rolling in.

940
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,811
Just like that hotel
in East Hampton.

941
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,761
Like that first summer we met.

942
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:18,328
A little big perhaps,
a little grand.

943
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,363
But we could make
believe, couldn't we?

944
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,001
We could wipe out everything
that's happened to us since.

945
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,971
The waves rolling
in all night long.

946
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,646
Remember?

947
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,159
That completes it, doesn't it?

948
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,319
What?

949
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,919
The stage is all set,
just like it was that night.

950
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,009
But I don't understand.

951
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,879
- Are you afraid of the light?
- Why should I be afraid of the light?

952
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,359
People who hate the light
usually hate the truth.

953
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,079
The truth? John, forgive me, but I
don't know what you're talking about.

954
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,919
I'm talking about liars, Ann.

955
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,479
- Liars and expensive tramps!
- What are you trying...

956
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,279
What did you say to Wilder?

957
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,879
That you saved dear old John from
a grubby little hotelkeeper?

958
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,479
Ten minutes flat and
he was at your feet.

959
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,999
His hands were too shaky
to light your cigarette.

960
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,479
Please don't be angry with me.
I had to see you.

961
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,919
- I was desperate to see you.
- What for?

962
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,679
To help me? You wouldn't think
of telling me the truth.

963
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,199
No. You had to have your conquest,
your unconditional surrender.

964
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,079
If you could do it by lying...

965
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,046
All right. I knew you were
going to get married.

966
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,359
And I should have said so
from the beginning, but.

967
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,166
- I still have some pride left.
- Pride.

968
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,201
Yes.

969
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:54,402
I can see the makeup now, all right.
Little lines that weren't there before.

970
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,810
The beginning.

971
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,199
There'll be more, and one day
this face will begin to decay,

972
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,639
and there'll be nothing left to make
a man grovel, to make him want to...

973
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,330
Why don't you?

974
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,769
Don't leave me, John.

975
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,719
John, come back. Come back
to my room. John, don't go!

976
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,844
I can make you forget
all those silly lies.

977
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,724
John, come back!

978
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,806
What's happened?
I thought I heard...

979
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,999
Miss Cooper, Mrs. Shankland has
had a fall. I'm afraid she's hurt.

980
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,559
- I'll come at once.
- What is the matter? What's going on?

981
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,967
Mrs. Shankland has had a fall.

982
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,679
- I'd like my newspaper back.
- Yes. It's on my desk.

983
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,999
- You've read it?
- Yes, I've read it, Mrs. Railton-Bell.

984
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,519
Poor dear. It's so
dark on these stairs.

985
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,319
- Thank you.
- Think nothing of it.

986
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,003
Careful, now. Come along,
Mrs. Shankland. You're all right.

987
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,891
That's all right, now.

988
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,639
- How's the weather, Miss Meacham?
- Dry as a bone outside.

989
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,083
I should have a winner,
if it stays dry at Newbury.

990
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,719
Did me handicap book arrive?

991
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,526
I think, that looks like it.

992
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,159
Miss Cooper, Mr. Malcolm wasn't in
his room when I took his tea up

993
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,719
and his bed hadn't been slept in.

994
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,239
Yes, I know, Doreen.

995
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,039
- You know?
- I should have told you. I forgot.

996
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,159
Mr. Malcolm had to go to London
unexpectedly last night.

997
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,359
- He won't be in to breakfast?
- No, I don't suppose he will.

998
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,599
What about the new lady?
She's not down yet.

999
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,282
She's down, Doreen. I think
she'll be in for breakfast.

1000
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,801
Okay.

1001
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,291
She's leaving, isn't she?
The new one?

1002
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,359
How did you know?

1003
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,279
I heard her ask for her
bags to be brought down.

1004
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,608
I knew she'd never stick it.

1005
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:47,439
- "Stick it," Miss Meacham?
- I don't mean the hotel.

1006
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,759
Best for the price in Bournemouth.
I've always said so.

1007
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,601
I meant the life. She's
not an "alone" type.

1008
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,919
Is anyone an "alone" type, really?

1009
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,090
Yes. They're rare, of course.

1010
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,159
But you are, for one, I'd say.
You're self-sufficient.

1011
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,359
I've very glad you think so, Miss Meacham,
perhaps even gladder than you realize.

1012
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,199
What do you mean by that?

1013
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,919
I haven't the faintest idea.
I'm a bit tired this morning.

1014
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,879
I had very little sleep last night.

1015
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,448
Well, I don't suppose
you are glad, really.

1016
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,039
Probably you haven't had
to face up to it yet.

1017
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:28,131
I faced up to it very early on.
Long before I was an old wreck.

1018
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,679
People have always scared
me a bit, you see.

1019
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,319
They're so complicated.

1020
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,126
I suppose that's why
I prefer horses.

1021
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,370
Feeling better?

1022
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,006
A bit.

1023
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,846
Any word?

1024
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,641
No. But I shouldn't worry.
He's been out like this before.

1025
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,611
I'd feel much better
if he'd come back.

1026
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,888
I must catch that train.

1027
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,762
Thank you for everything.

1028
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,529
Hello, Miss R-B. Enjoying
the sunshine, what?

1029
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,439
By Jove, what a morning.

1030
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,679
I've been walking on the chines.

1031
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,039
I must say, looking across that sea,
that sky, it could have been Tunis.

1032
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,519
It really could.

1033
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,679
I remember, in the spring of '43...

1034
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,121
Please, don't pretend anymore.

1035
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,839
Pretend? My dear Miss R-B...

1036
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,407
The West Hampshire Weekly News.

1037
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,042
Mummy's read it, you see.

1038
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,526
Did she show it to you?

1039
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,201
Yes.

1040
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,569
And to all the others.

1041
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,850
Miss Cooper, as well?

1042
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,767
Yes.

1043
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,844
She's asked Miss Cooper
to tell you to go.

1044
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,601
I see.

1045
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,642
That's it then, isn't it?

1046
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,761
Yes.

1047
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,446
God.

1048
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,050
Why did you do it?

1049
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,084
I don't know. I wish
I could answer that.

1050
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,079
Why does anybody do anything
that they shouldn't?

1051
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,239
Why do some people drink too much,

1052
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,125
and other people smoke
50 cigarettes a day?

1053
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,731
Because they can't
stop it, I suppose.

1054
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,281
Then this wasn't the first time?

1055
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,485
No.

1056
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,370
It's horrible.

1057
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,291
Yes, it is, of course. I'm
not trying to defend it.

1058
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,919
You've never guessed this,
I know, but ever since school,

1059
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,964
I've always been scared
to death of women.

1060
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,322
Of everyone, in a way, I
suppose, but mostly of women.

1061
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,959
I had a bad time at school, which
wasn't Wellington, of course.

1062
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,367
It was just a council school.

1063
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,519
Boys hate other boys to be timid and shy,
and they gave it to me good and proper.

1064
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,959
My father despised me, too.

1065
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,004
He was a sergeant major
in the Scots Guards.

1066
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,799
He made me join the army, but I was
always a bitter disappointment to him.

1067
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,480
He died before I got my commission.

1068
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,999
I got that by a wangle, too. It wasn't very
difficult at the beginning of the war.

1069
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,362
But it meant everything
to me just the same.

1070
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,523
Being saluted, being called "sir."

1071
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,683
I thought, "I'm someone
now, a real person."

1072
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,525
Perhaps some woman might even...

1073
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,125
But it didn't work.
It never has worked.

1074
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,049
I'm made in a certain way,
and I can't change it.

1075
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,359
It has to be in the dark, you see,
and strangers, because...

1076
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,519
Stop it. Stop!

1077
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,291
I don't want to hear any more.

1078
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,359
You asked me why I did such things

1079
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,370
and I wanted to talk
to somebody about it.

1080
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,444
I never have, you see,
not in my whole life.

1081
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,439
I'm sorry if I upset
you, of all people.

1082
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,399
Why me, especially?
Why not the others?

1083
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,719
I don't give a hang
about the others.

1084
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,759
They'll all take it
in their various ways

1085
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,602
but to them it'll be just another bit
of gossip to snort and snigger over.

1086
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,679
But it'll be different for you, Sibyl,
and that makes me very unhappy.

1087
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,479
That's the first time
you've called me Sibyl.

1088
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,091
Is it really?

1089
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,803
Well, there's not much point in all
that "Miss R-B" stuff now, is there?

1090
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,444
What makes me so different
from the others?

1091
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,967
I suppose it's because you're so scared
of... Well, shall we call it "life"?

1092
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,041
That sounds more respectable
than that word I know you hate.

1093
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,289
We're awfully alike, you know,
you and I, in many ways.

1094
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,199
That's why we've drifted so
much together in this place.

1095
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,599
How can you say that we're alike?

1096
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,399
It's just that we're both so
frightened of other people

1097
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:03,003
and we somehow managed to forget our
fright in each other's company.

1098
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,608
Speaking for myself, I'm grateful.
I always will be.

1099
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,722
I can't expect you to feel
the same way now, of course.

1100
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,010
Well, I'd better start
packing, I suppose.

1101
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,006
I should be able to
catch the 10:45.

1102
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,159
The old Wellingtonian colors.

1103
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,284
Why have you told
so many awful lies?

1104
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,479
Because I don't like myself the way I am,
so I've had to invent somebody else.

1105
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,921
It's not too harmful, really.

1106
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,959
We all have our daydreams.

1107
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,607
Mine have just gone a step
further than most people's.

1108
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,330
Sometimes, I've even managed to
believe in "the Major" myself.

1109
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,170
Well, I'd better get
cracking, I suppose.

1110
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,087
Packing up after four years
is hellish business, really.

1111
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,129
Has to be done, though.

1112
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,851
If I don't see you
again before I go,

1113
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,688
I'll write and say goodbye.

1114
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,759
But where will you go?

1115
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,485
I don't really know.

1116
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,919
A chap in London might put
me up a couple of days.

1117
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,879
Only, I don't really
want to go there.

1118
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,525
But why not?

1119
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,965
Well, it's really rather a
case of birds of a feather.

1120
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,247
Don't go to him. You
mustn't go to him.

1121
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,639
- I don't really know where else.
- Another hotel.

1122
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,079
It can't be Bournemouth,
or anywhere near here.

1123
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,759
It'll have be London, and I don't
know anywhere there I can afford.

1124
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,279
I'll lend you some money.

1125
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,519
- No, you certainly won't.
- Yes, I have some savings certificates.

1126
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,759
You can have those, and
I can get some more...

1127
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,442
No, Sibyl. Thank you, but no.
I'll think of somewhere.

1128
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,559
I've just remembered a place now.

1129
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,004
Cheltenham. It's a very pleasant spot.
I'll go and telephone them right away.

1130
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,399
I hate to do this, but could you
possibly lend me a sixpence?

1131
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,443
Yes, of course. Here.

1132
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,679
Here you are.

1133
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,319
Thank you so much.

1134
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,399
But...

1135
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,650
Don't bother about me. Don't worry.
I'll be perfectly all right. Please.

1136
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,650
Are you all right?

1137
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,686
Yes, thank you,
I'm quite all right.

1138
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,119
Is there anything I can do to help?

1139
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,529
No, thank you. I'm perfectly
all right, thank you.

1140
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,999
You're fond of him, aren't you?

1141
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,559
No, I hate him, I despise him.
He's a vile, wicked man,

1142
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,319
and he's done a horrible, beastly thing,
and it's not the first time, either.

1143
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,170
He admitted that.

1144
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,769
God, it's so horrible!

1145
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,004
He says we're alike, he and I.

1146
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,166
Did he?

1147
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,565
He says we're both afraid
of life and people

1148
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,806
and sex.

1149
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,839
There, I've said it.
I've said the word.

1150
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,279
He says I hate saying it, even.

1151
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,881
He's right, I do.

1152
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,287
Please, try and control yourself.

1153
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,561
Someone may come in.

1154
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,206
Will he be all right, do you think?

1155
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:42,283
Because, in spite of what he's done,
I don't want anything bad to happen to him.

1156
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,122
I just want him to be happy.

1157
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,002
I want him to find another
friend in his other hotel,

1158
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,641
help him to forget his fright.

1159
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,368
Do you think that he will?

1160
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,765
I hope so.

1161
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,920
So do I.

1162
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,120
Oh, God.

1163
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,086
So do I.

1164
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,249
Here's your sixpence.

1165
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,285
I'm afraid that place was full up,
but I'll find something else.

1166
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,246
Well,

1167
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,130
goodbye, Sibyl.

1168
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,005
God bless you.

1169
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,003
I know perfectly well what
you must think of me.

1170
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,880
Thank you for being so kind to her.

1171
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:05,363
I had a couple of pipes here somewhere.
I'd better take them with me, I suppose.

1172
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,163
That's everything, I think.

1173
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,479
Are you all right?

1174
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,682
Yes, I'm all right, Pat.

1175
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:52,521
That was a fine way to behave,
dashing out into the night.

1176
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,290
- Where have you been?
- I don't know. I walked a long way.

1177
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,959
- How is she? Is she all right?
- Your hands are like ice.

1178
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,527
What about her? Is she all right?

1179
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,884
She's all right, John.
I'll get you some tea.

1180
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,119
Did I hurt her?

1181
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,769
No. She was pretty hysterical last
night, but that was hardly surprising.

1182
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,119
She fell, though, didn't she?

1183
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,919
I seem to remember pushing her.

1184
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,639
- Her falling, hitting her head...
- She's all right, John.

1185
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,923
Whatever you did, there's
been no damage at all.

1186
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,922
She's leaving this morning.

1187
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,359
Did you ring, Miss?

1188
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,319
Some tea for Mr. Malcolm, please.

1189
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,959
Tea? Just before breakfast?

1190
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,162
That will be all, Doreen.

1191
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,606
Okay.

1192
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:51,010
We talked most of the night.
I didn't want to get a doctor.

1193
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,091
John, did you know
that she took drugs?

1194
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,919
- Drugs?
- It's only the kind to make you sleep

1195
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,879
but she takes three
times the proper dose.

1196
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,519
- The little fool.
- She takes them in the daytime, too.

1197
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,449
Why does she do it?

1198
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,281
Why do you go to the Feathers?

1199
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,079
She was going to be married.

1200
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,479
That's not true.

1201
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:15,401
- But she told me.
- I'm simply telling you, that's not true.

1202
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,399
There's not much to choose
between you two, is there?

1203
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,759
Together, you slash
each other to pieces,

1204
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,611
apart, you slash
yourselves to pieces.

1205
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,487
All told, it's quite a problem.

1206
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:34,127
- I'm going to tell her that you're here.
- No, Pat, don't do that.

1207
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,559
I'll just stay out of her
way till she's gone.

1208
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,919
She's only waiting
to hear how you are.

1209
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,719
You can tell her I'm all right.

1210
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:44,279
You don't think you might
tell her that yourself?

1211
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,686
No, Pat.

1212
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,079
It's your own business. I think if
I was in your place, I'd want to.

1213
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,524
You don't know what it's like to be
in my place. You can't even guess.

1214
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,842
Yes, I think I can, John.

1215
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,328
I said there was a refuge
for you here. I was wrong.

1216
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,209
There is no refuge.

1217
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,519
- There's no refuge from yourself.
- Stop it, Pat, please.

1218
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,121
Listen, why won't you face facts?

1219
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,839
Do you think I enjoy seeing your
refuge blown down over your head?

1220
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,839
After all, I've shared it with
you for a good many years.

1221
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,839
I'm under the debris,
too, you know...

1222
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,319
Pat, please!
I'm asking you to stop it!

1223
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,522
All right. I'll stop it.

1224
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,651
Here we are, all cozy now.

1225
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,686
- Put it there, Doreen.
- Righty-o.

1226
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,522
She'll have to go, that girl.

1227
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,439
Pat, I'm sorry, but,

1228
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,399
give me one good reason why I
should ever see her again?

1229
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,730
All right. Just one then, and God
knows it's not for me to say it.

1230
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:56,006
Because you love her
and she needs you.

1231
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,959
What went on between you last night?
How did she win you over?

1232
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,004
She didn't win me over,
for heaven's sake.

1233
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,206
Feeling the way I do,
do you think she could?

1234
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,723
Anyway, to do her justice,
she didn't even try.

1235
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,519
I could see her as
she is, all right.

1236
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,679
All you've told me about
her is probably true.

1237
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,248
She is vain and spoiled and
selfish and deceitful.

1238
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,519
Of course, with you
being in love with her,

1239
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,359
you see all those things
as sort of monstrous sins.

1240
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,999
I see them as ordinary
faults. I don't like them

1241
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,125
but that doesn't stop me being sorry
for a woman who's ill and lonely

1242
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,927
and desperately in need of help.

1243
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,491
Well, shall I tell her
that you're here?

1244
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,803
No, Pat, just let her
go back to her own life

1245
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,807
and leave me here to
live mine in peace.

1246
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,925
Well, that would be fine, John,
if you'll tell me just one thing.

1247
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,683
What sort of peace are
you living in down here?

1248
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,924
Is it even living?

1249
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,445
Is it, John?

1250
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,406
It'll do.

1251
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,445
Thank you. At this moment, I don't
think I could have borne tact.

1252
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,079
If you won't face her,
there's the door.

1253
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,479
Outside's the street. Down
the street is the Feathers.

1254
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,127
It's a bit early, but I'm
sure they'll open up for you.

1255
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,960
Come in.

1256
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,799
- I'm so sorry, you're busy.
- No, Major, come in. It's all right.

1257
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,119
- I can come back.
- It's all right, Major, I was just leaving.

1258
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,688
I've already taken up more of Miss
Cooper's time than I deserve.

1259
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,999
I shouldn't have barged in.
I've upset him.

1260
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,009
You didn't upset him.

1261
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,399
What can I do for you, Major?

1262
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,604
Just, if you don't mind,
to get my bill ready.

1263
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,365
I want to make it
perfectly plain, Major,

1264
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,730
that there's no question of my
asking you to leave this hotel.

1265
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,799
If you wish to stay, you're
at perfect liberty to do so.

1266
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,319
Well, that's very good of you,
but of course, I have to go.

1267
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,399
Very well.

1268
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,446
I'll send you a forwarding address
when I get something fixed.

1269
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:35,239
I hate to ask, but could I hide here in
your office when I bring my bags down?

1270
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,283
- I don't want to...
- Of course.

1271
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,639
And thank you for being so kind.

1272
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,839
I don't deserve it, but
I'm very grateful.

1273
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,441
I do wish you'd change your mind.

1274
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:52,121
Miss Cooper, the plain fact is that I'm far
too much of a coward to stay on here now.

1275
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,485
At least you wouldn't be forced into any
more of that "Major" stuff, would you?

1276
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,400
I might be forced into something
a good deal more conclusive.

1277
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,720
Cleaning the old service
revolver, perhaps.

1278
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,122
Make a nasty mess on
one of your carpets

1279
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,039
and bring an ugly
scandal to your hotel.

1280
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,810
I'd take the risk, if you would.

1281
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,085
You're thinking of
Sibyl, of course?

1282
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,526
Sibyl, too, yes.

1283
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,610
Not a hope in the whole
blinking wide world.

1284
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,922
I know my form, you see.

1285
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,442
Still, that is the part about
it that I hate the most.

1286
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,519
She's distinctly an odd
one, almost a case.

1287
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:39,328
Mind of a child and all that. And
yet, she means quite a lot to me.

1288
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,846
I rather think you mean
a lot to her, too.

1289
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,922
I would like to think so.

1290
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,799
You know, one's awfully apt to try and
excuse oneself sometimes by saying,

1291
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,004
"What I do doesn't do
anybody else much harm."

1292
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,285
But one does, you see, and that's not
a thought that I like very much.

1293
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,644
Well, I mustn't miss
the old train, what?

1294
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,968
I must stop saying "what."

1295
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,285
cheery-bye.

1296
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,121
I must stop doing
that, too, I suppose.

1297
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,811
Charles.

1298
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,842
Charles, you were asleep.

1299
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,159
Darling, I just can't go on
like this. I just simply can't.

1300
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,399
Like what?

1301
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,959
Well, you've just got to marry
me, so I can get some sleep.

1302
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,686
I'm never going to
pass these exams.

1303
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,051
All right.

1304
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,161
What?

1305
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,768
All right, we'll be married.

1306
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,039
Jean.

1307
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,559
After all, it really isn't going to
make the slightest bit of difference.

1308
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,039
We'd better call my mother,

1309
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,999
so she can get started
on the arrangements.

1310
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,559
And you'd better call
your father in Liverpool.

1311
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,319
Charles, how many children
do you think we should have?

1312
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,251
I think maybe three
to start, don't you?

1313
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,571
Yes, dear.

1314
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,479
Good morning, Mr. Malcolm.

1315
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,762
Good morning, Miss Meacham.

1316
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,079
Are you all right, Ann?

1317
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,399
Yes, thank you. I was
worried about you.

1318
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,965
You shouldn't have been.

1319
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,599
Toast, Mrs. Shankland?

1320
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,279
No, thank you.

1321
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,839
Haddock or boiled egg?

1322
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,804
Just coffee, please.

1323
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,923
I'm glad you came in.

1324
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,207
It gives me a chance to say how
sorry I am I had to lie to you.

1325
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,208
Tell me something, Ann.
When you say you need me,

1326
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,919
is it me that you
need or just my love?

1327
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,202
Because if it's my love, you
must know that you have that.

1328
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,407
- It's you, John.
- Why?

1329
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,129
I suppose because you're
all the things I'm not.

1330
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,999
You're honest and true and
dependable and sincere and...

1331
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,646
Virtues that I don't have anymore.

1332
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,123
So you see, Ann, I could
never satisfy your need.

1333
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,730
I know that you could
never satisfy mine.

1334
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,162
I would never try to again.

1335
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,647
I won't bother you anymore.

1336
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,689
Going back to New York?

1337
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,279
I suppose so.

1338
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,319
You must have friends there,
hundreds of acquaintances...

1339
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,439
You know better than that, John.

1340
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,439
It's hard to believe,

1341
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,440
but you can be more alone in
New York than in this hotel.

1342
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,366
Even with their separate tables,
they can talk back and forth.

1343
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,241
Being alone in a crowd is worse.

1344
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,970
It's more painful,
more frightening.

1345
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,410
So frightening.

1346
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,487
I'm an awful coward, you see.

1347
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,210
I've never been able to
face anything alone.

1348
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,684
Being ill, having
operations and all that.

1349
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,368
Now I can't even face

1350
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,604
just getting old.

1351
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:08,842
That damn waitress will come
back and catch me crying.

1352
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,159
How did you sleep, dear?

1353
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,639
Not at all well. That dreadful
business about the Major.

1354
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:20,811
I know. Nerve-wracking, isn't it?
I'm utterly shattered, myself.

1355
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,999
Poached eggs for you, isn't it?

1356
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,519
You should know by now,

1357
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:38,159
that Miss Railton-Bell never has anything
but a poached egg for breakfast.

1358
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,170
I forget things, dear.
That's my trouble.

1359
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,959
There we are.

1360
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,839
Eat your egg, dear.

1361
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,409
You don't want people to think you're still
upset over that horrible man, do you?

1362
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,925
No, Mummy.

1363
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,724
Sorry, Major, there's been a muddle.
I'll lay your table right away.

1364
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,450
Mabel, No. 7's in.
You said he was out.

1365
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:22,123
That's what Edgar said.
Edgar said he was leaving.

1366
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,279
Haddock? It's nice this morning.

1367
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,289
Very well, thank you.

1368
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,405
There we are.

1369
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,770
All cozy now.

1370
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,405
Good morning.

1371
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,810
Good morning.

1372
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,125
Good morning.

1373
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,639
Good morning.

1374
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,519
Lovely day, isn't it?

1375
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,119
Yes, it is.

1376
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,159
It should be fine for the course.

1377
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,364
If the weather holds up, I could
give you a winner tomorrow.

1378
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,683
Thank you very much.

1379
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,651
I may not be here tomorrow.

1380
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,641
I see.

1381
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,800
It's suddenly turned very cold
in here, dear, don't you think?

1382
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,967
I think I shall move my chair
around out of the draft.

1383
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,250
Good morning. Have you seen
the latest cricket score?

1384
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,759
No, I haven't.

1385
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,407
We're doing rather well.
Australia all out 246.

1386
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:32,086
- I am glad to hear that.
- Yes, it is encouraging, isn't it?

1387
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,085
Well, really.

1388
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,719
Good morning.

1389
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,126
Gladys.

1390
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,928
I hope you're having the
haddock. It's delicious.

1391
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,204
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

1392
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,525
Come, Sibyl.

1393
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,519
I haven't finished yet.

1394
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,039
It doesn't matter, dear.
Come with me into the lounge.

1395
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,571
No, Mummy.

1396
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,882
Sibyl, come with me at once.

1397
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:19,443
No, Mummy. I'm going to stay here in the
dining room and finish my breakfast.

1398
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,604
I saw the new moon through
glass last night.

1399
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,439
Did you, indeed?

1400
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,484
Some people think that's
unlucky, don't they?

1401
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,079
Yes, they do.

1402
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,523
But then, I don't believe
in superstitions. Do you?

1403
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,126
No, as a matter of fact, I don't.

1404
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:01,006
You know, Ann, that we don't
have very much hope together.

1405
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,568
Have we all that much apart?

1406
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,442
Good morning, Lady Matheson.

1407
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,048
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1408
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,123
Edgar says your taxi has
arrived, Mr. Pollock.

1409
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,559
Ask him to send it away
again, would you, please?

1410
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,207
Very well. Lunch at
the usual time then?

1411
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,848
Lunch at the usual time.
