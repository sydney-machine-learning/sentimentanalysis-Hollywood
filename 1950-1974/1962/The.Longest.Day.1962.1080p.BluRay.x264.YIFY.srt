1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,622
<i>London calling... with Frenchmen</i>
<i>speaking to their countrymen.</i>

2
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,694
Take a look at that! What
a handsome sight...

3
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,363
...the pride of the Third Reich!

4
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:41,535
The brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners.

5
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,083
So that's a sample of the
master race! In a pig's eye!

6
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:36,458
In this darkest hour, in
the gloom of night...

7
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,586
...we must not despair.

8
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,471
For each of us...

9
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,517
...deliverance is coming!

10
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,136
We need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast.

11
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,349
At every beach, on every dune...

12
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,851
...on every rock.

13
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,145
How many have been installed?

14
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,941
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.

15
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,244
The work has completely
exhausted our troops.

16
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,916
Which would your troops rather be...

17
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,168
...exhausted or dead?

18
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:53,421
Just look at it, gentlemen.

19
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,966
How calm... how peaceful it is.

20
00:04:56,383 --> 00:05:00,053
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...

21
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:02,265
...between the Allies and us.

22
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:08,272
But beyond that peaceful
horizon... a monster waits!

23
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:12,317
A coiled spring of men,
ships and planes...

24
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:15,655
...straining to be released against us.

25
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:21,036
But not a single Allied soldier
shall reach the shore.

26
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,297
Whenever or wherever this invasion
may come, gentlemen...

27
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:35,845
...I shall destroy the enemy
there... at the water's edge!

28
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,639
Believe me, gentlemen.

29
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,311
The first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive.

30
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,483
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...

31
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:50,820
...the longest day!

32
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,530
The poem by Verlaine?

33
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,198
Play it back!

34
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,797
<i>Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.</i>

35
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:48,803
<i>Here are some personal messages.</i>

36
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,686
<i>"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."</i>

37
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:57,187
<i>I repeat:</i>

38
00:06:57,396 --> 00:07:01,234
<i>"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."</i>

39
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:05,364
Have you notified all commands?

40
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,339
If Berlin is right,
when we intercept the second verse...

41
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,844
...it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours.

42
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,431
Give me the text of the second verse.

43
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,162
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

44
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:54,003
We've intercepted hundreds of messages
in the last year... hundreds!

45
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,423
I've ordered alerts again and again.

46
00:07:57,632 --> 00:08:01,678
Why should this poem mean more
than other messages?

47
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:03,347
Tell me this:

48
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:08,228
Does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when?

49
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,814
Of course it doesn't.

50
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:19,824
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...

51
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:24,746
...just because a pair of nitwits
in Berlin intercept a poem?

52
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,918
No, Blumentritt... no alert!

53
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:33,339
And especially not in this weather!

54
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,969
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

55
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:56,783
Good morning, Field Marshal.

56
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:58,910
- Any news?
- Nothing important.

57
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,913
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.

58
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:05,460
Nothing much happened
last night... the storm.

59
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:09,505
That's all I'm interested in
this morning... the storm.

60
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:15,220
It came from nowhere...
blew my roses to bits.

61
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,100
There are five-foot waves
in the Channel...

62
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,937
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.

63
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,608
For the month of June...

64
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,360
...it's the worst Channel
storm in 20 years.

65
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,988
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?

66
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:34,743
General Jodl will see the FÃ¼hrer today...

67
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,704
...and confirm the appointment for you.

68
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,585
Will you still go to Germany as planned?

69
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:45,422
Can you think of a better time?

70
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:51,053
The weather is expected to continue
like this for another week.

71
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:40,067
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

72
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:42,529
Snap it up.

73
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,489
Jerk the lead.

74
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:46,324
Snap it up.

75
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,535
Jerk the lead.

76
00:10:47,744 --> 00:10:50,079
You expect us to eat this slop again?

77
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,165
I don't care what you do with it, mac.

78
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,167
Eat it, throw it out.

79
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:55,961
I get paid for cooking it.

80
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,921
Come on. Put it on.

81
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:01,801
Snap it up.

82
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,386
Jerk the lead.

83
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:05,430
Didn't you get any sleep?

84
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:08,601
Are you kidding? I haven't slept
since we got here.

85
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:13,230
I got the absolute lowdown.

86
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,485
It's on for tonight. For sure.

87
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,028
Yeah.

88
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:21,615
I got in this crap game
with this guy from F Company.

89
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:25,661
- He's an orderly for some general.
- Move it. Move it.

90
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,126
Hey, Hutchy!

91
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,420
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.

92
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:35,839
Hey, Hutchinson...

93
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:39,761
...do you think they'd let me write
home? If it was really important?

94
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:43,015
Not likely, mate. Security.

95
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,476
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.

96
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:48,354
It's the wife, you see.
She's going to have a baby.

97
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:49,730
Your first, is it?

98
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,193
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead
worried about her.

99
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,612
She's not too strong, you see.

100
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,811
Man, that stink.

101
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:28,483
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.

102
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,946
And there ain't no place left
to get sick in.

103
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,490
The puke bags is full.

104
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,993
The fire buckets is full.

105
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,998
All we got left is our helmets.

106
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,835
June.

107
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,718
Every June my old man
used to take me camping...

108
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:56,474
...up in the Blue Mountains.

109
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,687
We'd hunt and fish all day long.

110
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,191
And at night...

111
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,196
...we'd sleep out under the stars.

112
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,992
Didn't even need a blanket.

113
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,166
June.

114
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,008
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.

115
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:28,594
Don't it ever stop?

116
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:31,972
Look, Dad, all I want
to do is get going.

117
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:36,353
Wind or no wind. Even if we land
in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

118
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:39,064
- Come to think of it...
- Colonel wants us.

119
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,025
All of us.

120
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:58,711
All troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment.

121
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,047
In this weather, sir?

122
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,719
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure
that we'll land in France...

123
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,556
...in sunshine and dry weather.
- Didn't mean that.

124
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,143
- What did you mean?
- It isn't the weather.

125
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,396
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.

126
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,066
I don't think I have to remind you...

127
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:20,611
...that this war has been going on
for almost five years.

128
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:23,240
Half of Europe has been
overrun and occupied.

129
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:25,909
We're comparative newcomers.

130
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:30,415
England's gone through a blitz with
a knife at her throat since 1940.

131
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:34,878
I am quite sure that they too
are impatient and itching to go.

132
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,922
Do I make myself clear?

133
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,758
Yes, sir. Quite clear.

134
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:42,762
Three million men penned up
on this island.

135
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,683
All over England,
in staging areas like this.

136
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:51,105
We're on the threshold
of the most crucial day of our times.

137
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,524
Three million men out there...

138
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:58,614
...keyed up, and waiting for
that big step-off.

139
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,160
They aren't exactly alone.

140
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,707
Notify the men. Full packs
and equipment, 14:00 hours.

141
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,083
Yes, sir.

142
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,176
This allows you more freedom.

143
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,555
Quicker to get rid of
when we hit the beach.

144
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:23,225
- Well?
- It's on.

145
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,229
Tonight, as scheduled.

146
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,232
- If the weather isn't worse.
- How worse can it get?

147
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,653
Ike has called a high-level
conference for 9:30.

148
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:37,116
I am not Eisenhower. I am
an assistant division commander.

149
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:42,038
I don't know from nothing,
but he can't call it off again.

150
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:47,545
Frank, turn that thing off.

151
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:50,172
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

152
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:51,966
Troops ready to go.

153
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,010
Eleven thousand planes on the line.

154
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,848
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.

155
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,143
Norm, relax.

156
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:04,814
RAF says the gale can stop
as suddenly as it began.

157
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:07,359
So they told us yesterday
and the day before.

158
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,069
Look, Norm.

159
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:12,322
We're all of us just as...

160
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:16,077
...dedicated to this thing as you are,
just as anxious to get going.

161
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:18,288
And that includes Ike.

162
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,459
Now if he calls it off again,
he knows what he's doing.

163
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,378
Of course he does. I know that.

164
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:28,383
I'm just thinking about those
assault troops. 200,000 of them...

165
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:31,970
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.

166
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,975
Some of those men have been
on those tubs for almost three days.

167
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,436
I say go.

168
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,272
Go. Weather or no weather.

169
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:44,526
No!

170
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:47,988
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.

171
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:52,160
- Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.
- I'm not doing so good myself.

172
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,089
Hey, lend me $50?

173
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:10,890
- Lend me 20 bucks?
- Drop dead.

174
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,357
Lend me $ 10?

175
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:27,242
- Fifty on a bet.
- I got it.

176
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,494
One, two, three, four, five.

177
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,413
Fifty!

178
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,459
Let me hear it, let me hear it.

179
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:39,131
- Five and two, four and three.
- Six! That's the way we go!

180
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,801
Seven points in a row. It ain't
logical, it just ain't logical.

181
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:47,932
- There's a hundred out there.
- $ 100 dollars, $20 dollars.

182
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,684
Anything open?

183
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:51,854
- Forty more.
- Forty more.

184
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,730
You got a bet.

185
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:58,069
- Okay, you mother-loving...
- Just a minute. Wait a minute.

186
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,613
Here you are. Use this.

187
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,283
- You don't think I'd...
- I don't think anything.

188
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:06,829
I just like to hear the sound
when it comes out of the cup.

189
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:10,666
That's it. Shake it.

190
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:15,547
Okay. Let me see what you do
with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.

191
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,340
- What is it?
- Nothing.

192
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,427
- Seven!
- That's what I wanted!

193
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,929
Who put this cup in the game?

194
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,932
- Next shooter. Who's coming up?
- I'll go $ 100.

195
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,728
He's shooting a hundred.
Who's got it?

196
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:30,314
- Watch your side bets.
- $ 100.

197
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,652
You got a letter for me.
Schultz, huh?

198
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:38,031
Yeah, that's it.

199
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:39,867
Thanks, buddy.

200
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,964
- How much did you take him for?
- Not much. Just a hair over $2500.

201
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,551
- $2500?
- Yeah.

202
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,137
Oh, man, $2500?

203
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,433
It's too bad you had to win it now.

204
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,185
What do you mean, now?

205
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,480
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?

206
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:12,028
Five I take with me to Paris
to blow on the broads and wine.

207
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,698
A thou I leave here for seed
when I get back.

208
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,076
And the rest I send to my mother.

209
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:42,856
Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.

210
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,732
You always was lucky.

211
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,860
Hey, remember that night
in Fort Bragg?

212
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:51,282
I remember it.

213
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:56,204
You know, I think I sneak over there
and give it a big whang myself.

214
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,373
Why not? What's to lose?

215
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:03,504
Damn it.

216
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:08,217
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?

217
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,724
I was lucky, all right,
in that crap game.

218
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,646
Next day I break my leg in a jump.

219
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,441
And two months in traction.

220
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:36,625
$2500.

221
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:41,839
That's more money I ever had
in my whole life.

222
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,138
I know.

223
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,352
Man, I just know.

224
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:09,079
I wonder how long it takes
to lose $2500?

225
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,511
Pint of sludge, Ted.

226
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,691
Oh, hello, Dave.
Hey, you seen Johnny?

227
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,151
Yes.

228
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,736
Well, where is he?

229
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:41,158
Come on, Dave.

230
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,952
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.

231
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,206
Where is he?

232
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,250
At the bottom...

233
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,085
...of the Channel.

234
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:01,431
You mean...

235
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:04,434
...he's bought it?

236
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:06,936
Ack-ack over Calais.

237
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:11,192
He jumped clean,
but his parachute didn't open.

238
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:22,330
That leaves just you
in the squadron, Dave.

239
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:27,001
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.

240
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,047
What's always worried me
about being one of the few...

241
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:32,841
...is the way we keep on
getting fewer.

242
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:35,762
Yeah.

243
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,847
Poor old Johnny.

244
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:40,850
Bad luck, it happening now.

245
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,481
- Now, then. What's the difference?
- He went through the Battle of Britain!

246
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:50,070
And now if the big show
starts tonight...

247
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,197
...he won't be in it.

248
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:55,158
Look, will you please
shut up about him?

249
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,703
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

250
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,206
You heard something about tonight?

251
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:03,377
No, no. I haven't heard anything.

252
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:06,839
- What are you talking about then?
- Well, it's just...

253
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:10,552
- Go on, go on.
- I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

254
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:13,221
- That's all.
- A feeling.

255
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:15,723
Take your feeling somewhere else.

256
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:18,686
I've got a letter to write.

257
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:21,564
I've had this feeling since I woke up.

258
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,942
I've had it with me all day long.

259
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,403
I can't shake it off.

260
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:30,282
It's tonight. I know it is.

261
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,285
All right, it's tonight.

262
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:33,870
Suits me fine.

263
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,914
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!

264
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,377
I mean...

265
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,256
...as soon as I finish this beer.

266
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,234
- General, can you spare me a minute?
- Come in.

267
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:03,153
- Thank you.
- Can I get you coffee?

268
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,615
- No, thanks.
- I'll get some for myself.

269
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:17,920
Is it still raining?

270
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:19,714
On and off, off and on.

271
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:22,550
Sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

272
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,801
What?

273
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:28,432
I say, sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

274
00:24:28,974 --> 00:24:30,935
Good question.

275
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,645
What's on your mind, Van?

276
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,941
I'm concerned about the placement
of our drop zones.

277
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:37,400
Go on.

278
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,197
I know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new...

279
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,741
...but you've given me
a tough nut to crack.

280
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,496
- It gets tougher every time I try.
- I know, Van.

281
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:51,291
Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise straddles
the only road the Germans can use...

282
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,004
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.

283
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,340
And it has to be held.

284
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:01,178
That's why I gave you the job, Van.

285
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,976
- Can I use your board?
- Of course.

286
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:14,986
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

287
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:18,614
Down here is the swamp area
that the Germans have flooded.

288
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:22,786
And in between, four miles
from the town, is our drop zone.

289
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:25,414
Now if anything goes wrong
and we undershoot...

290
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:28,500
...we land in this flooded area
and are bogged down.

291
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:31,963
If we overshoot, we come down
like clay pigeons...

292
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:35,133
...smack dab in the center
of Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise.

293
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:39,889
That's why I gave the men training
in low-level jumps near the villages.

294
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:41,682
So I've heard.

295
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:47,606
Got a complaint from
the city council at Bexhall.

296
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:52,445
Some of your men overshot
the drop zone and landed in the town.

297
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:56,490
- Tied up traffic for an hour.
- That's true, sir. I was with them.

298
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:59,578
Sudden crosswind hit us,
swept us over the treetops...

299
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,872
...scattered us all over the place.

300
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:08,463
- Where did you end up?
- In the courtyard of a convent.

301
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:11,467
Relax, Van. Sit down.

302
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:16,805
The last few months have been
a tough grind on all of us.

303
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:20,685
I hear you've been working yourself
and your battalion hard.

304
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,938
Almost without a stop.

305
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:27,193
Now that we're almost
at the end of the line...

306
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:30,696
...why don't you try easing up
on yourself and on the men?

307
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:34,743
Sometimes a battalion can be
sharpened to too fine a point.

308
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:38,038
Sometimes a commander can too.

309
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,626
Well...

310
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:46,507
...if there's any further delay...

311
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:50,469
...I request permission to submit
a new placement for our drop zones.

312
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,847
All right. Put it in writing.

313
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,433
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.

314
00:26:56,184 --> 00:27:01,148
But Ike has called a final meeting
for tonight at Southwick House.

315
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:04,277
If it's on, we'll get
the green light by 9:30.

316
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:07,281
- What are the chances?
- Better than 50-50.

317
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:11,743
Forget everything I said. I got
the best battalion in this division...

318
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:12,954
...and they're ready.

319
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,974
Here it is. The latest report.

320
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:52,582
- It's Southwick House, sir.
- Stagg here.

321
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,629
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in
much faster than we thought.

322
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,965
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.

323
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:03,762
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.

324
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:14,023
- Would you like some more tea, sir?
- Coffee, and make it black.

325
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,233
Please.

326
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:17,528
One moment, Colonel Priller.

327
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:20,405
Why wasn't he court-martialed?

328
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:22,575
He shot down 132 planes.

329
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,542
Don't call me "Pips, old boy."

330
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,212
You were a rotten pilot
when we flew in Russia.

331
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,967
You're flying a desk now, but
you're still a rotten pilot!

332
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,262
What's that you're saying?

333
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,767
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...

334
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:49,480
...with only two planes...
two stinking crates!

335
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:54,486
Oh, sure, sure... your
orders were followed!

336
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,989
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!

337
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,620
My supplies are all gone. What
am I supposed to do now?

338
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:08,043
But Pips, we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons... we had to!

339
00:29:08,252 --> 00:29:12,591
Look what happened to our airstrips
around the Pas-de-Calais!

340
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,635
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

341
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:20,057
You move us back instead of forward!

342
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:25,188
Sure, I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...

343
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,525
...but what would happen if they did?

344
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:32,906
But you know I can't get there
with my equipment for two days.

345
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:36,784
I tell you, you're all crazy!

346
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:57,433
Priller has always been a hothead...

347
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:00,395
...but let's not underestimate him.

348
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:04,149
What he says is not entirely illogical.

349
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:06,903
What's the weather report?

350
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:09,447
Slightly better over the Channel.

351
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:12,617
I wouldn't be surprised if...

352
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,207
- When's the next weather report?
- Tonight at 8, General.

353
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,711
Keep me posted on the weather.

354
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:24,839
You made my dinner reservations?

355
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:26,841
Yes, I did, General.

356
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,719
Cancel everything.

357
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:48,534
Shoes for my wife, I had them
specially made in Paris...

358
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:53,664
...for her birthday... tomorrow,
the sixth of June.

359
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:56,293
Please wish her a happy birthday.

360
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,961
Thank you, Speidel.

361
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:04,552
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect...

362
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,642
An attack now would be embarrassing.

363
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,147
But I don't think we need worry.

364
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:39,133
Is the plan ready, sir?

365
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:42,970
Yes, yes, quite finished.

366
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,141
War games...

367
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:50,020
...theoretical invasions.

368
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:57,028
Rush to Rennes just to push
little flags around a table.

369
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:01,951
Playing at war!

370
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,373
Do you win or lose, sir?

371
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,209
Have I ever lost?

372
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:17,969
But General, this time you play
the role of Eisenhower.

373
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,974
I win because I go against the rules.

374
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,771
We expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the Channel...

375
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,859
...and in good weather. But that's
too simple... too obvious.

376
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:37,199
I choose the widest part, in the
worst weather... and attack here.

377
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:39,744
In Normandy.

378
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:41,830
And in bad weather!

379
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:47,378
Like now...

380
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,463
...bad weather!

381
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,009
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

382
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,432
From a meteorological standpoint,
conditions almost resemble mid-winter.

383
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,850
And Normandy?

384
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,646
High winds, clouds,
and some fog over the beaches.

385
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:07,985
However, I can say with a certain
degree of safety...

386
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:11,488
...that we can expect a brief period
of fair conditions.

387
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:13,699
Let me summarize, then.

388
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,080
What you're promising us is a barely
tolerable period of fair conditions.

389
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,415
Am I right?

390
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,751
Yes.

391
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,588
Conditions that are far below
the minimum requirements.

392
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,216
That's all I can promise.

393
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:31,845
You've done your best, Stagg.
Thank you, gentlemen.

394
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,769
Well...

395
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:39,604
...there it is.

396
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:43,400
We've postponed the attack
once already.

397
00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:48,072
Now, either we go on the 6th,
with only marginal conditions...

398
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:50,825
...or postpone again...

399
00:33:51,284 --> 00:33:53,787
...in the hope of getting
perfect conditions.

400
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,665
What do you think, Monty?

401
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,959
I say, go. Go.

402
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,461
I must remind everybody...

403
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,591
...that the American convoy
for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

404
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,677
...they've farthest to go...

405
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:10,181
...must be given the order
within the next half-hour...

406
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,559
...if the assault is to take place
on the 6th.

407
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:20,734
We can't keep almost a quarter
of a million men on ships...

408
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,947
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.

409
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:28,243
The longer we wait, the more
acute our security problem.

410
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,204
The next time...

411
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,957
...the tides and the moon
will be right...

412
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,796
Not before July.

413
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,759
Gentlemen...

414
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,723
...such a postponement...

415
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:51,145
...is too bitter to contemplate.

416
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:58,069
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.

417
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:03,241
Fortunately, it's only a game.

418
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,663
I don't think we have
much to worry about.

419
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,669
Eisenhower would never
take the gamble.

420
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:14,838
Never.

421
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:23,014
I'm quite positive
we must give the order.

422
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,976
I don't like it...

423
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:28,062
...but there it is.

424
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:29,855
Gentlemen...

425
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:34,819
...I don't see how we can possibly
do anything else but go.

426
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:53,340
Wilson speaking.

427
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:55,426
Yes, sir.

428
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:02,893
It's on, sir. Ike's made the
decision. Tonight, as scheduled!

429
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:19,578
Colonel Tomson speaking.

430
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:24,710
Thank you.

431
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,092
Next stop...

432
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:32,844
...Normandy.

433
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:36,849
God help us now.

434
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:55,745
Gentlemen...

435
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:58,373
...the day we've been
waiting for has arrived.

436
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:01,501
Invasion! We're on our way.

437
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,177
General.

438
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,974
The orders have been given.
It's on.

439
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,272
Have the battalion commanders
join me in the wardroom.

440
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:31,828
All right, Sergeant.

441
00:37:34,122 --> 00:37:36,917
You men are the eyes
of our airborne army.

442
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:42,090
You, the pathfinders, will have
one job, and one job only:

443
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:46,053
To light the drop zones
for our paratroops.

444
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,015
Along with the British and Canadians
you'll be the first men...

445
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:53,061
...to land in France.
And remember this:

446
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,063
When you get to Normandy...

447
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:57,691
...you'll only have one friend:

448
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,610
God.

449
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,573
And this.

450
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,120
This...

451
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,581
...is Rupert.

452
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,378
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...

453
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,422
...and a lot more like him...

454
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,717
...behind the invasion area.

455
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,345
He's...

456
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,558
...a very extraordinary
fellow, Rupert.

457
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,436
He's sort of a...

458
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:32,105
...one-man army, all by himself.

459
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,400
Let me show you.

460
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:38,696
Let me show you what happens
when Rupert...

461
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:40,449
...hits the ground.

462
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,701
Sergeant, switch off
the lights, please.

463
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:52,503
All right, Sergeant, that's all.

464
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:55,215
All right, come on. Simmer down.

465
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,634
Come on, up.

466
00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:06,102
It's possible that Rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the Germans.

467
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:09,273
Confuse them, make them look
over their shoulders...

468
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:12,068
...and launch an attack
in the wrong direction.

469
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:23,164
Ten-hut!

470
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:27,710
- The crickets have been distributed.
- So I heard.

471
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:31,048
At ease!

472
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:36,304
You're as ready as we can make you.

473
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,891
This five-cent toy...

474
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:42,937
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

475
00:39:43,145 --> 00:39:45,106
It may save your life.

476
00:39:45,606 --> 00:39:47,900
You're gonna be landing in the dark.

477
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:51,238
On the other side of that hedgerow...

478
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:55,993
...the fellow may not be wearing
the same uniform you are. So...

479
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,829
...one click...

480
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,665
...is to be answered by two clicks.

481
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,254
And if you don't
get that answering click...

482
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:07,840
...hit the dirt and open fire.

483
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,091
I repeat:

484
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,136
One click...

485
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,596
...must be answered by two clicks.

486
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:18,561
Now, hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.

487
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,521
Do you read me?

488
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,690
Loud and clear, sir.

489
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,152
All right. One more thing.

490
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,988
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

491
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:31,159
You can't give the enemy a break.

492
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:34,245
Send them to hell.

493
00:40:39,752 --> 00:40:41,420
That is all.

494
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:53,225
<i>London calling with messages</i>
<i>for our friends.</i>

495
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:03,153
<i>"Molasses tomorrow will</i>
<i>bring forth cognac."</i>

496
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:10,703
<i>"John has a long mustache."</i>

497
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,996
<i>I repeat:</i>

498
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:15,125
<i>"John has a long mustache."</i>

499
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:18,796
"John has a long mustache!"

500
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:36,358
No, not yet...

501
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:37,985
Oh, my Lord!

502
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,805
"John has a long mustache."

503
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,675
Make any sense to you, mac?

504
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:40,348
As I said last night, they're code
messages to the Resistance chaps.

505
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:43,518
Obviously, one message means
something to one group...

506
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,063
...and another means something
to another group.

507
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,320
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>

508
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,405
<i>I repeat:</i>

509
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,538
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>

510
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:06,336
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor."</i>

511
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:07,712
<i>I repeat:</i>

512
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:12,051
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor."</i>

513
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:27,568
The bridge... in forty-five minutes.

514
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:38,832
We'll be back.

515
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:50,803
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor."</i>

516
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:52,889
<i>I repeat:</i>

517
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:56,935
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor."</i>

518
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:02,483
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>

519
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:16,541
The best hand I've had all night.

520
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,002
Let me see here...

521
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:24,508
Pardon me.

522
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:28,764
Pardon me, General... it's come!

523
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:31,350
Wait. Give that to me.

524
00:44:31,892 --> 00:44:33,101
What's come?

525
00:44:33,352 --> 00:44:35,104
It's the second part of the message.

526
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,774
The second verse.

527
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:40,693
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

528
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:44,698
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

529
00:44:47,242 --> 00:44:50,080
We can expect the invasion
within 24 hours!

530
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:54,250
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.

531
00:44:56,712 --> 00:44:58,089
Thank you.

532
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:10,937
You know, I'm too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this.

533
00:45:11,145 --> 00:45:15,693
Now... where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!

534
00:45:43,265 --> 00:45:45,226
It's almost impossible to believe.

535
00:45:46,185 --> 00:45:48,354
Every dot represents a ship.

536
00:45:49,022 --> 00:45:52,609
You got battlewagons, cruisers,
destroyers, minesweepers.

537
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:55,988
You got assault craft of every size
and every type.

538
00:45:58,116 --> 00:46:00,785
The biggest armada
the world's ever known.

539
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,251
Here.

540
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:11,965
You remember it.

541
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:14,509
Remember every bit of it.

542
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:16,720
We're on the eve of a day...

543
00:46:16,928 --> 00:46:20,683
...that people will talk about
long after we're dead and gone.

544
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:33,990
You wanna know something?

545
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:37,869
It gives me goose pimples
just to be part of it.

546
00:46:49,424 --> 00:46:51,343
You could call it one of them...

547
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:54,597
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages,
you know?

548
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:58,017
Met at a dance at the USO
and all that...

549
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,270
...but, I mean, I took it serious.

550
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:03,732
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.

551
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:06,778
- When did you get the letter?
- Week ago.

552
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:08,113
Two weeks.

553
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:13,034
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.

554
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:17,123
I mean, she's a high-class model
and all, and I...

555
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,963
I'm not the kind of guy
to get married that easy.

556
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,257
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.

557
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:35,102
But oh, man, we really had some
wonderful times together.

558
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,981
And you think she's got a boyfriend?

559
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,903
Well, she never actually said so...

560
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,864
I mean...

561
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:50,953
You think I was right?
I mean, was I fair?

562
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:55,166
She can't get one
without your permission, right?

563
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,210
You gotta give your okay.

564
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,046
I know it's the law.

565
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:02,090
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

566
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:12,811
Well, I guess I better be
getting back to the outfit.

567
00:48:16,274 --> 00:48:17,776
Good luck.

568
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:20,820
You too.

569
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:35,045
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?

570
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:39,092
I don't know, Sparrow.

571
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:42,637
I never saw him before in my life.

572
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:09,710
Happy birthday, General...
from your staff!

573
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:15,466
Thank you.

574
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:19,972
Will you cut the cake, sir?

575
00:49:21,098 --> 00:49:24,143
I trust you don't
expect me to eat it, too!

576
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,258
What's that?

577
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:57,181
<i>Dummkopf,</i> that's the "V for
victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.

578
00:49:59,683 --> 00:50:02,437
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

579
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,900
Release point coming up, Major Howard.

580
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:45,361
Right, prepare for landing.

581
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:47,071
Cutting loose now.

582
00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:48,322
Roger and out.

583
00:51:15,395 --> 00:51:18,566
<i>Major Howard, I cannot overestimate</i>
<i>the importance of your task.</i>

584
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:23,028
<i>The Orne River Bridge must be captured</i>
<i>before the enemy can destroy it.</i>

585
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:28,118
<i>It's a vital military artery, and the</i>
<i>enemy has prepared it for demolition.</i>

586
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,707
<i>It must be taken by surprise</i>
<i>and captured intact.</i>

587
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:37,336
<i>Your gliders will land at night,</i>
<i>without the benefit of ground support.</i>

588
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:40,257
<i>You will assault the garrison,</i>
<i>overwhelm it...</i>

589
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:42,634
<i>... and hold until relieved.</i>

590
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,263
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

591
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:46,681
Major Howard!

592
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,600
There's the bridge coming up.

593
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:51,771
Just on our left.

594
00:52:01,782 --> 00:52:03,492
Right, link your arms.

595
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:05,328
Brace yourselves.

596
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,522
Feet up!

597
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,691
Hang on!

598
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:39,518
Smoke screen. Smoke.

599
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:46,234
Up the action, bucks!
Up the action, bucks!

600
00:53:56,497 --> 00:53:58,749
Right, Tom.
Over the bridge.

601
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:26,155
Check for demolition charges!

602
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:05,576
Hello! Hello!

603
00:55:27,517 --> 00:55:28,560
Clear.

604
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,871
It's working!

605
00:55:52,837 --> 00:55:53,630
Where's the doc?

606
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:56,258
On the third glider.
There's no report from them.

607
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:57,718
Walsh.

608
00:55:57,927 --> 00:55:58,928
Sir?

609
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:01,807
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.

610
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:03,850
On the other end of the bridge.

611
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:06,436
- What happened to you?
- Broke it on landing.

612
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:08,981
- Isn't the doc with you?
- No, he's missing.

613
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,610
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

614
00:56:13,277 --> 00:56:15,239
I'm all right, sir.
So are the boys.

615
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:18,784
- Okay, carry on.
- Right, sir. Come on!

616
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:43,563
Well, I'll be...

617
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:45,690
Hey, doc! Doc!

618
00:56:46,816 --> 00:56:49,068
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.

619
00:56:49,277 --> 00:56:52,239
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.

620
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:04,128
Sir?

621
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:07,548
The demolition charges have
been removed. It's all clear.

622
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:09,550
Good. Corporal Smith.

623
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:15,140
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.

624
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:20,229
- John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
- Right, sir.

625
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,404
All in less than 15 minutes.

626
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:32,911
Only a matter of time before
they counterattack.

627
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,290
- What about the paratroopers?
- 7th Para might not get here for hours.

628
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:39,752
And Lovat and his commandos...

629
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:43,047
It could be midday
before they get here.

630
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:46,802
The question is,
how long can we hold?

631
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,387
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

632
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,266
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

633
00:58:02,986 --> 00:58:04,822
It's raining again.

634
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,241
Thank you.

635
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,535
Did you get the list?

636
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:17,628
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games.

637
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:24,136
The Commander of the 243rd
left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.

638
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:28,850
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd...
twelve officers in all.

639
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:31,978
Yes, I know.

640
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:37,067
The weather is bad, so everyone
enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

641
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:39,903
I don't like it.

642
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:41,489
Any of it.

643
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:44,909
So many key officers are
away at the same time.

644
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:47,287
I don't know why, but I don't like it.

645
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:51,625
But the war games have been
scheduled for a week...

646
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:55,630
Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight.

647
00:58:58,008 --> 00:59:01,679
Advise all officers who have
not yet left for Rennes...

648
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:04,891
...to postpone their
departure until tomorrow.

649
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:07,935
May I remind you, General...

650
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,899
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.

651
00:59:12,107 --> 00:59:16,196
North Africa... Sicily... Italy...

652
00:59:16,946 --> 00:59:18,448
Yes, and always at dawn!

653
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:29,878
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

654
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:32,297
Now, once more, I repeat:

655
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:36,302
If, for any reason, we fail
to hit our drop zones...

656
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:38,387
...move north by east.

657
00:59:38,763 --> 00:59:40,515
North by east.

658
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:44,561
The Germans have flooded large
swamp areas behind the coast.

659
00:59:44,812 --> 00:59:46,980
Avoid them if possible.

660
00:59:47,189 --> 00:59:50,067
We came here to fight, not to swim.

661
00:59:50,485 --> 00:59:51,861
Do you read me?

662
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,404
Loud and clear, sir.

663
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:16,764
How'd you make out?

664
01:00:17,807 --> 01:00:19,685
How did you make out at the game?

665
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:22,604
I lost.

666
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:28,403
Now we're both jumping clean.

667
01:00:46,007 --> 01:00:49,844
I understand. And when will
the Field Marshal return?

668
01:00:51,804 --> 01:00:53,599
I see. Oh, well.

669
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:55,225
Just a moment.

670
01:00:56,977 --> 01:00:58,604
The radar report.

671
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,612
We are getting reports of
strong radar interference...

672
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:08,449
...and radio reception is jammed.

673
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:14,956
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!

674
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:16,124
And the...

675
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:20,463
Call the OB West? Very well.

676
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:24,592
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.

677
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:58,714
Bye, Rupert.

678
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,177
Do your duty for God, king,
and your country.

679
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,253
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!

680
01:04:32,473 --> 01:04:34,475
- Are we late?
- No, but...

681
01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:36,228
...we must hurry!

682
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:49,353
What is it?

683
01:05:56,695 --> 01:05:58,239
I'll go.

684
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:19,096
Stop!

685
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:21,473
We said, stop!

686
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:23,893
Stop, or I'll shoot!

687
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:30,025
What are you doing here?

688
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:32,945
I live in that farm.

689
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:36,532
Nobody lives in that farm.

690
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:40,495
- It's abandoned.
- Show me your papers.

691
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,498
Hurry up!

692
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,340
Come with me.

693
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,008
Go on!

694
01:07:31,637 --> 01:07:33,639
Put your bicycle there.

695
01:07:34,557 --> 01:07:35,767
Hans!

696
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,728
Hans, where are you?

697
01:07:40,063 --> 01:07:43,234
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!

698
01:07:43,818 --> 01:07:46,237
Who is with you? I want to know!

699
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:56,875
Stop!

700
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,626
Stop!

701
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,767
Stop!

702
01:08:17,565 --> 01:08:18,566
Stop!

703
01:08:18,774 --> 01:08:20,484
Stop!

704
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:11,334
Good luck at the war games, General.

705
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:15,839
Anything important?

706
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:19,928
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.

707
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:23,223
The Underground again!

708
01:09:23,974 --> 01:09:28,521
Some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute.

709
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:30,565
Rubber dummies!

710
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:34,361
Connect me with General Richter!

711
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:39,616
We can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics...

712
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:45,123
...but I don't like this idea
of dummy parachutists.

713
01:09:51,714 --> 01:09:52,882
Are you certain?

714
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:55,385
How many?

715
01:09:56,928 --> 01:09:58,555
What do you think of it?

716
01:10:03,227 --> 01:10:04,729
Paratroopers...

717
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:12,571
Put it over there.

718
01:10:19,537 --> 01:10:23,334
This is what they dropped, they
explode on contact with the earth.

719
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:26,086
In the dark, they look like soldiers.

720
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:31,551
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.

721
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:45,776
When you create a diversion,
it's for a reason.

722
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:48,779
Connect me with General Pemsel!

723
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:54,327
Dummies...?!

724
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:56,455
Rubber dummies!

725
01:10:58,374 --> 01:11:03,337
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.

726
01:11:05,632 --> 01:11:07,551
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

727
01:11:07,759 --> 01:11:11,222
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.

728
01:11:15,142 --> 01:11:17,144
They wouldn't drop dummies...

729
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:20,107
...unless it was to divert our
attention from something else.

730
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:21,817
In this weather?

731
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:23,610
In any kind of weather!

732
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,823
I must get in touch with OB West.

733
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:24,013
They're enemy paratroopers!

734
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:40,156
Blimey, mate...

735
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:43,452
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!

736
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:21,704
Fellas!

737
01:13:21,912 --> 01:13:23,665
I'm hung up!

738
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,417
Fellas!

739
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,266
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

740
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,463
Where have you come from?

741
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:23,343
Awfully sorry, old man.

742
01:15:23,594 --> 01:15:25,762
Simply landed here by accident.

743
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:33,813
What's that?

744
01:15:34,648 --> 01:15:37,651
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.

745
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,819
Your what?

746
01:15:39,028 --> 01:15:41,281
My communion set. I've lost it.

747
01:15:41,573 --> 01:15:44,409
Now listen, padre.
We've got no time to look for...

748
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,377
I'm sure that it was here
that I lost it.

749
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,655
We're under fire, padre.
Don't you think we ought to...

750
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:20,533
You go on, my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

751
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,872
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

752
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,171
I've got it! I've got it!

753
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,173
Glory be.

754
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:37,220
Now, my son, let's go
about God's work this night.

755
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:50,443
Pluskat.

756
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:56,992
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?

757
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:02,290
Nothing that I've heard...

758
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:08,255
The usual bombing, but quite distant.

759
01:17:10,382 --> 01:17:12,677
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

760
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:15,680
Well, wait a minute.

761
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:17,765
Yes, just a moment.

762
01:17:31,615 --> 01:17:35,911
Flares... but a long way up the coast.

763
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:39,499
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.

764
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:42,544
There's probably nothing to it...

765
01:17:43,337 --> 01:17:47,842
...but we have had reports
of paratrooper landings.

766
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:51,054
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

767
01:17:51,638 --> 01:17:53,515
Thank you, sir.

768
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:14,081
Higher! Higher!

769
01:18:19,252 --> 01:18:22,256
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!

770
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,140
Mayor Renaud, you must
come with me immediately.

771
01:18:30,349 --> 01:18:33,769
- Is it important?
- Very important, Mayor Renaud.

772
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:45,408
What's wrong, madam?

773
01:18:45,616 --> 01:18:48,620
I was on my way to the
little house outside...

774
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:51,957
Suddenly, I saw a man
fall from the sky.

775
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,251
- A parachutist?
- Yes, that's right.

776
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:55,920
He looked like a big white bird!

777
01:18:56,129 --> 01:18:58,256
- British or German?
- What?

778
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:00,842
The parachutist... was he
a friend or an enemy?

779
01:19:01,092 --> 01:19:04,722
I don't know. He disappeared
without a word. Just "Shh!"

780
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:07,266
- Without a word?
- Just "Shh!"

781
01:19:15,483 --> 01:19:17,153
<i>Bonjour, madame...</i>

782
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:19,488
<i>... je suis amÃªricain.</i>

783
01:19:20,031 --> 01:19:21,991
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselle...</i>

784
01:19:22,575 --> 01:19:23,994
<i>... je suis amÃªricain.</i>

785
01:19:26,288 --> 01:19:28,206
We seem to be circling.

786
01:19:28,957 --> 01:19:32,211
Maybe they're having difficulty
finding the drop zone.

787
01:19:33,338 --> 01:19:34,714
<i>Je suis...</i>

788
01:19:34,964 --> 01:19:36,341
<i>... amÃªricain.</i>

789
01:19:36,549 --> 01:19:39,136
<i>Je suis amÃªricain.</i>

790
01:19:40,596 --> 01:19:41,764
<i>Voulez-vous...</i>

791
01:19:42,222 --> 01:19:43,223
<i>... mademoiselle?</i>

792
01:19:44,934 --> 01:19:45,935
Okay.

793
01:19:47,145 --> 01:19:48,480
Go!

794
01:19:49,356 --> 01:19:50,649
Go!

795
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:25,355
Paratroopers!

796
01:23:47,128 --> 01:23:48,380
Anything new?

797
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:52,592
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...

798
01:23:53,009 --> 01:23:55,262
...and now near Caen.

799
01:23:55,471 --> 01:23:58,182
The lines to Stations 6
and 8 have been cut...

800
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:00,518
...but the direct line is open.

801
01:24:18,831 --> 01:24:20,749
I'll stay for a while.

802
01:24:22,252 --> 01:24:25,505
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

803
01:25:07,094 --> 01:25:09,722
For God's sakes, padre,
stop that damn noise.

804
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:12,559
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

805
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,436
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.

806
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:10,041
Two clicks.

807
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,419
I heard two clicks.

808
01:27:53,576 --> 01:27:54,744
Man...

809
01:27:54,953 --> 01:27:56,872
...am I glad to see you.

810
01:27:57,665 --> 01:28:00,710
- You guys the 82nd?
- No. This is the 101.

811
01:28:00,918 --> 01:28:02,253
101?

812
01:28:02,461 --> 01:28:03,755
Where's the 82nd?

813
01:28:03,964 --> 01:28:07,300
Look, bud, we don't even know
where our own outfit is.

814
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:11,055
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.

815
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,765
Let's us go find this war.

816
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:14,308
Come on.

817
01:28:44,593 --> 01:28:47,388
Maybe they're Limeys
and ain't got no cricket.

818
01:28:50,099 --> 01:28:52,101
They must be our guys.

819
01:28:55,647 --> 01:28:57,107
Okay.

820
01:29:19,257 --> 01:29:20,843
No.

821
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:37,654
Hey.

822
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:40,365
Hey, they were Germans.

823
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:55,049
Hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right.

824
01:29:55,258 --> 01:29:56,926
Toward Caen.

825
01:29:59,887 --> 01:30:05,102
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula...
something must be happening!

826
01:30:05,352 --> 01:30:10,525
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.

827
01:30:12,402 --> 01:30:16,115
Has anything been
observed on the beaches?

828
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,453
No... nothing.

829
01:30:21,495 --> 01:30:23,832
Yes, I'll let you know right away.

830
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:25,417
Of course.

831
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:35,428
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

832
01:30:35,636 --> 01:30:37,347
Compound fracture, sir.

833
01:30:37,556 --> 01:30:40,517
Well, put the boot back on
and lace it up...

834
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:41,727
...tight.

835
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:43,688
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.

836
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:45,690
And you're not walking on it.

837
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:50,237
- You're not going to try...
- Knock it off and do as you're told.

838
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,542
Yes?

839
01:31:02,751 --> 01:31:05,963
A, B and C Company are scattered
all over like we are.

840
01:31:06,172 --> 01:31:07,507
Go on.

841
01:31:07,715 --> 01:31:11,845
Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke
his shoulder. I left him with a medic.

842
01:31:12,054 --> 01:31:13,680
Any contact with F Company?

843
01:31:13,889 --> 01:31:17,936
No, but they must be up ahead
in the direction of Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise.

844
01:31:18,978 --> 01:31:22,482
Well, go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.

845
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:28,489
Well, here's where we are.

846
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:30,616
The northern edge of the swamp area...

847
01:31:30,825 --> 01:31:32,702
...five miles from our drop zone.

848
01:31:32,911 --> 01:31:34,746
Five miles.

849
01:31:35,539 --> 01:31:36,623
- F Company?
- No, sir.

850
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,001
And we've got scouts
all over the place.

851
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:41,254
We even picked up a group
from the 101.

852
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:45,425
F Company were the first
of the lead planes.

853
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:48,262
Well, give me a hand.

854
01:31:57,731 --> 01:31:59,482
Can I have my rifle?

855
01:32:09,619 --> 01:32:11,913
Well, we'll head out this way.

856
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:16,961
We ought to reach high ground
and open country by daybreak.

857
01:32:17,462 --> 01:32:19,714
All right. Have the men spread out...

858
01:32:19,922 --> 01:32:21,884
...pick up any stragglers
they can find.

859
01:32:22,092 --> 01:32:23,510
- Pass the word.
- Right, sir.

860
01:32:23,719 --> 01:32:26,680
All right, men, spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.

861
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:28,558
Pass the word down.

862
01:32:30,268 --> 01:32:31,644
All right...

863
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:33,229
...let's go.

864
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:38,486
From the latest reports,
this is how I see it:

865
01:32:38,694 --> 01:32:41,782
American paratroopers have landed...

866
01:32:45,535 --> 01:32:47,162
British paratroopers...

867
01:32:49,457 --> 01:32:51,125
The invasion...

868
01:32:58,675 --> 01:33:00,511
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.

869
01:33:01,345 --> 01:33:05,058
General Pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion!

870
01:33:05,308 --> 01:33:10,189
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:

871
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:13,818
Normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack.

872
01:33:14,026 --> 01:33:16,321
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.

873
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:20,575
It's not the main attack. That will
come at the Pas-de-Calais...

874
01:33:21,368 --> 01:33:23,162
...where it was always expected.

875
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:28,626
Where we always expected it!

876
01:33:29,377 --> 01:33:31,880
But we can't take any chances.

877
01:33:32,089 --> 01:33:35,300
I want the reserve panzers
moved up at once!

878
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:38,471
We need approval from the
FÃ¼hrer's headquarters.

879
01:33:38,721 --> 01:33:41,516
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

880
01:33:41,808 --> 01:33:46,856
Call the FÃ¼hrer's headquarters
and insist.

881
01:33:47,064 --> 01:33:51,570
Insist that the panzers be
released to me immediately!

882
01:33:56,408 --> 01:34:02,123
An invasion of Normandy would
be against all military logic.

883
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:06,253
It would really be against all logic...

884
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:19,435
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.

885
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:25,734
Most of you have had
your feet wet before:

886
01:34:26,234 --> 01:34:28,820
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.

887
01:34:29,029 --> 01:34:31,907
And we know what it means
to be driven into the sea.

888
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:35,078
In a few hours
we're going back from the sea.

889
01:34:36,746 --> 01:34:38,915
And this time we're going to stay.

890
01:34:40,334 --> 01:34:42,377
There's no time
for any sob stuff about...

891
01:34:42,586 --> 01:34:44,880
...England, home and beauty.

892
01:34:46,508 --> 01:34:50,261
Remember, our people have had a
rough time for four and a half years.

893
01:34:51,596 --> 01:34:53,766
They've earned the final victory.

894
01:34:55,976 --> 01:34:57,603
Let's give it to them.

895
01:34:58,854 --> 01:35:01,858
And to our French comrades in arms,
I say:

896
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:03,693
Good luck.

897
01:35:03,902 --> 01:35:05,904
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.

898
01:35:15,332 --> 01:35:16,834
Come in, Teddy.

899
01:35:27,178 --> 01:35:28,973
Did you have to put it in writing?

900
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,642
I knew you wouldn't let me go
unless I did.

901
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,894
You're putting me on the spot.

902
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:36,731
- I didn't mean to, Tubby.
- The hell you didn't.

903
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,734
You put that request in writing,
made it official.

904
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:42,530
You're the assistant division
commander.

905
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:46,033
And that's why I'm supposed to go
ashore in the first wave.

906
01:35:46,242 --> 01:35:49,037
That's where I'm supposed to be.
You know that.

907
01:35:49,246 --> 01:35:50,914
You're important
to this operation.

908
01:35:51,123 --> 01:35:53,792
We can't have you knocked off
on the first day.

909
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:56,337
But that's not the real reason.

910
01:35:56,546 --> 01:36:00,175
Isn't it because my father was
president of the United States?

911
01:36:00,425 --> 01:36:01,843
And a great president.

912
01:36:02,051 --> 01:36:03,846
And a great soldier.

913
01:36:04,054 --> 01:36:07,308
He led the charge of the Rough Riders
up San Juan Hill.

914
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:11,938
So now you've got to be
the first man ashore on Utah Beach.

915
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:15,901
But that's where I'm supposed to be,
Tubby. That's my job.

916
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:26,038
Also, I've been there side by side
with the men all through training.

917
01:36:26,246 --> 01:36:30,376
They're used to seeing where I belong.
They have a right to expect me there.

918
01:36:31,002 --> 01:36:33,213
President's son or not.

919
01:36:35,882 --> 01:36:37,718
Is my request denied?

920
01:36:50,107 --> 01:36:51,984
No, you know it's not.

921
01:36:53,736 --> 01:36:57,031
Request reluctantly approved.

922
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:00,661
Thanks, Tubby.

923
01:37:02,371 --> 01:37:03,664
Thanks a lot.

924
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:06,251
Say...

925
01:37:06,459 --> 01:37:08,545
...how's that arthritis of yours?

926
01:37:09,087 --> 01:37:10,755
Arthritis?

927
01:37:11,422 --> 01:37:13,926
Haven't had a touch in months.

928
01:37:14,135 --> 01:37:15,469
Glad to hear it.

929
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:35,659
The street...

930
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:38,245
...the bridge...

931
01:37:39,121 --> 01:37:40,540
...the hotel...

932
01:37:42,459 --> 01:37:43,960
...the casino.

933
01:37:58,393 --> 01:37:59,770
One more thing...

934
01:38:01,647 --> 01:38:04,650
You have been fighting
everywhere for four years...

935
01:38:04,984 --> 01:38:10,240
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete...

936
01:38:12,284 --> 01:38:15,371
But this time you are going
to fight on French soil...

937
01:38:15,955 --> 01:38:17,540
...in our fields...

938
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,126
...in our villages...

939
01:38:22,213 --> 01:38:24,048
...under the eyes of our own people.

940
01:38:33,517 --> 01:38:38,022
The FÃ¼hrer took a sedative, I won't
wake him for these reports.

941
01:38:38,272 --> 01:38:43,195
First we hear that the paratroopers
are shot down plane crews.

942
01:38:43,403 --> 01:38:46,532
Next they are identified
as mechanical dummies.

943
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:50,620
If paratroopers have landed...

944
01:38:50,829 --> 01:38:54,541
...it can only be a commando raid.

945
01:38:54,749 --> 01:38:59,338
Is that a sufficient reason to send
the panzers to the coast?

946
01:38:59,672 --> 01:39:04,803
I will submit all reports to the
FÃ¼hrer as soon as he awakens.

947
01:39:05,804 --> 01:39:07,556
I understand.

948
01:39:09,558 --> 01:39:11,394
Jodl has turned us down.

949
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:18,694
He will not release the panzers
without the FÃ¼hrer's approval...

950
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:24,200
...and the FÃ¼hrer is still asleep!

951
01:39:25,743 --> 01:39:27,954
Will you tell von Rundstedt?

952
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:32,918
No, not now...

953
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,089
Not now.

954
01:39:38,592 --> 01:39:40,343
Thank you, gentlemen.

955
01:39:56,778 --> 01:39:59,199
Sit down.

956
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:03,453
This is history!

957
01:40:05,288 --> 01:40:08,959
We are living an historical moment.

958
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:11,796
We are going to lose the war...

959
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:17,010
...because the glorious FÃ¼hrer
has taken a sleeping pill...

960
01:40:18,678 --> 01:40:21,098
...and is not to be awakened.

961
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:24,268
It's unbelievable.

962
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,103
Think of it, Kurt.

963
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:29,983
Don't ever forget it.

964
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:34,113
We are witnessing something...

965
01:40:34,405 --> 01:40:38,493
...which historians will always
say is completely improbable...

966
01:40:38,701 --> 01:40:40,412
...and yet it is true.

967
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:46,961
The FÃ¼hrer is not to be awakened!

968
01:40:47,963 --> 01:40:52,175
I sometimes wonder
whose side God is on.

969
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,720
Can I...

970
01:40:56,013 --> 01:40:58,099
...bring you anything, sir?

971
01:41:01,937 --> 01:41:05,524
In my room there is a bottle
of excellent cognac...

972
01:41:05,732 --> 01:41:08,361
...Napoleon, unopened.

973
01:41:09,237 --> 01:41:12,365
I was even saving it for
a fitting occasion.

974
01:41:13,366 --> 01:41:18,205
This isn't exactly the right
occasion, but get it anyway.

975
01:41:43,735 --> 01:41:45,445
Daylight at last.

976
01:41:47,989 --> 01:41:50,826
A whole night wasted again!

977
01:41:58,752 --> 01:41:59,753
Where's my dog?

978
01:41:59,961 --> 01:42:02,047
He was here a minute ago.

979
01:42:07,804 --> 01:42:09,597
Let's have one last look.

980
01:42:15,687 --> 01:42:17,357
Not even a seagull...

981
01:42:27,117 --> 01:42:28,410
My God!

982
01:42:35,085 --> 01:42:36,545
The invasion.

983
01:42:38,046 --> 01:42:39,423
They're coming!

984
01:42:43,511 --> 01:42:48,308
It's the invasion! There must be
five thousand ships out there!

985
01:42:48,892 --> 01:42:51,395
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.

986
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:56,609
The enemy doesn't have
even half that many.

987
01:42:56,985 --> 01:43:01,031
Well dammit! Come and see
for yourself, you fool!

988
01:43:02,032 --> 01:43:03,659
It's amazing.

989
01:43:03,909 --> 01:43:06,329
It's beyond belief.

990
01:43:07,622 --> 01:43:11,334
My dear Pluskat, where are
these ships heading?

991
01:43:11,543 --> 01:43:13,212
Straight for me!

992
01:43:29,147 --> 01:43:31,858
General, in exactly two minutes...

993
01:43:32,066 --> 01:43:34,278
...the fleet will open fire.

994
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:38,824
Your attention, please.
The Admiral has an announcement.

995
01:43:43,455 --> 01:43:46,166
Soon we shall be engaged in battle.

996
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:52,131
To drive the enemy out, we must
fire on our homeland.

997
01:43:52,965 --> 01:43:55,177
This is the price of liberty.

998
01:43:56,303 --> 01:43:57,638
Long live France!

999
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:30,050
There he goes, right on time... as usual.

1000
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:25,071
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!

1001
01:45:33,623 --> 01:45:35,791
I'm not crazy.
Look, they're landing!

1002
01:45:36,042 --> 01:45:38,377
The Americans, the English
and the French!

1003
01:46:14,211 --> 01:46:18,715
Do you hear me? What's the matter
with you? What's going on?

1004
01:46:19,049 --> 01:46:21,719
You must be deaf! Can't you...?

1005
01:46:22,846 --> 01:46:26,432
Dammit can't you hear
it for yourself?

1006
01:46:29,895 --> 01:46:34,067
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!

1007
01:46:39,406 --> 01:46:44,078
Those five thousand ships you
say the Allies haven't got...

1008
01:46:44,412 --> 01:46:47,415
...well, they've got them!

1009
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:00,680
It's wonderful!

1010
01:47:20,119 --> 01:47:22,121
Yes? What is it now?

1011
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:23,832
Listen to me, Pips.

1012
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:28,462
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!

1013
01:47:28,712 --> 01:47:32,467
What the hell can I do
with only two planes?

1014
01:47:32,759 --> 01:47:35,178
Where are the others, you idiots?!

1015
01:47:35,595 --> 01:47:40,142
Priller, that's an order! Get
ready at once! Understand?

1016
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:43,270
If it isn't too much trouble...

1017
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:47,817
...would you tell me where
the invasion is?

1018
01:47:48,985 --> 01:47:51,989
Normandy! How delightful!

1019
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:56,577
Thanks my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!

1020
01:47:57,245 --> 01:48:00,832
It's getting very difficult to
get any sleep around here.

1021
01:48:03,544 --> 01:48:08,841
Your prospects for a long sleep are
excellent. The invasion has begun.

1022
01:48:11,094 --> 01:48:13,305
We're flying there, the two of us.

1023
01:48:14,473 --> 01:48:16,225
Nobody else is left.

1024
01:48:18,186 --> 01:48:20,021
I don't think we're coming back.

1025
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:33,980
The shelling has stopped.

1026
01:49:37,818 --> 01:49:38,903
Landing craft approaching.

1027
01:49:39,153 --> 01:49:43,534
Return to headquarters. Direct
your troops from there!

1028
01:49:43,951 --> 01:49:46,119
Landing craft approaching the coast!

1029
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:53,711
Those French bastards!

1030
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,839
Sergeant!

1031
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:59,343
Send this to headquarters by courier.

1032
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:05,225
No! Take it yourself. Tell
them our lines are cut!

1033
01:50:05,433 --> 01:50:07,394
Gentlemen, come here please.

1034
01:50:48,024 --> 01:50:51,820
There it is, men.
Omaha Beach, dead ahead.

1035
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:54,031
Lock on the target!

1036
01:50:56,909 --> 01:50:58,661
Stand by!

1037
01:52:03,694 --> 01:52:05,946
Get off of the beach!

1038
01:52:06,196 --> 01:52:07,991
Let's go!

1039
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:53,918
Come on, move up!

1040
01:53:12,898 --> 01:53:13,941
Hello, General, sir.

1041
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:16,026
Are you all right, boy?

1042
01:53:16,235 --> 01:53:17,195
Yes, sir.

1043
01:53:17,403 --> 01:53:20,531
Don't you think you better go
back and get your rifle?

1044
01:53:21,282 --> 01:53:22,075
Out there, sir?

1045
01:53:22,283 --> 01:53:25,204
You're almost sure to need it
before this day is over.

1046
01:53:26,622 --> 01:53:27,539
Yes, sir.

1047
01:53:43,432 --> 01:53:46,270
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.

1048
01:53:53,611 --> 01:53:54,779
Medic!

1049
01:53:54,988 --> 01:53:55,947
Medic!

1050
01:54:16,804 --> 01:54:19,683
General, first reports
from Omaha, sir.

1051
01:54:19,891 --> 01:54:21,226
"Assault teams have landed.

1052
01:54:21,435 --> 01:54:24,271
No direct radio contact,
but destroyers report...

1053
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:27,609
...first and second waves
appear pinned down on the beach.

1054
01:54:27,817 --> 01:54:30,737
Concentrated artillery
and mortar fire.

1055
01:54:30,945 --> 01:54:34,700
Third wave floundering."
Heavy casualties, sir.

1056
01:55:33,767 --> 01:55:35,895
When the mortars and machine guns
are silenced...

1057
01:55:36,104 --> 01:55:38,273
...have the battalion commanders
join me...

1058
01:55:38,982 --> 01:55:39,774
...over there.

1059
01:55:40,024 --> 01:55:41,192
Okay.

1060
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:43,779
Hang on to that map case, Eddie.

1061
01:56:13,896 --> 01:56:15,231
I made it.

1062
01:56:17,776 --> 01:56:19,069
Hey, I made it.

1063
01:56:19,403 --> 01:56:21,322
Did you see me get those two guys?

1064
01:56:23,032 --> 01:56:24,492
Hey, Sergeant?

1065
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:29,956
Sergeant?

1066
01:56:32,126 --> 01:56:35,838
As best as I can figure it,
this is the wrong beach.

1067
01:56:36,047 --> 01:56:39,801
We're a mile and a quarter south
of where we were supposed to land.

1068
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:41,720
We should be up there.

1069
01:56:42,012 --> 01:56:45,099
Control boat must've been confused
by the naval bombardment smoke.

1070
01:56:45,558 --> 01:56:47,769
I agree with you,
but what will we do now?

1071
01:56:47,977 --> 01:56:51,105
Our reinforcements and heavy equipment
will approach in a very few minutes.

1072
01:56:51,314 --> 01:56:54,526
- I know, I know.
- What if they land at the right beach?

1073
01:57:03,954 --> 01:57:07,333
The reinforcements will have to
follow us wherever we are.

1074
01:57:09,043 --> 01:57:10,920
We're starting the war from right here.

1075
01:57:12,046 --> 01:57:15,092
- Head inland. We're going inland.
- Okay, let's go.

1076
01:57:33,112 --> 01:57:35,657
Follow me. Do everything I do!

1077
01:57:39,369 --> 01:57:41,789
All right. Let's go!

1078
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:30,178
Head for home!

1079
01:58:31,763 --> 01:58:35,141
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!

1080
01:58:45,362 --> 01:58:46,738
Stand by to beach.

1081
01:58:46,947 --> 01:58:48,990
Duncan, take care of that strongpoint.

1082
01:58:49,574 --> 01:58:52,578
Any minute now. Stand by!

1083
01:58:52,828 --> 01:58:54,997
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!

1084
01:58:55,498 --> 01:58:58,210
You hear that? Dunkirk.
Do you hear it, Clough?

1085
01:58:58,418 --> 01:59:00,462
Sure he was at school at the time.

1086
01:59:02,923 --> 01:59:05,009
Come on, you bums!

1087
01:59:05,802 --> 01:59:09,764
Come out, you dirty slobs!
Flanagan's back!

1088
01:59:12,977 --> 01:59:16,230
The evil of it all. Drowning a man
before he fights.

1089
01:59:16,438 --> 01:59:17,398
Oh, come on!

1090
01:59:53,064 --> 01:59:55,567
Keep those vehicles moving!

1091
01:59:55,775 --> 01:59:59,322
MP, chase out those cyclists.

1092
02:00:02,033 --> 02:00:04,368
Get off the beach! Move inland!

1093
02:00:06,163 --> 02:00:07,539
Come on, you lot!

1094
02:00:07,748 --> 02:00:09,207
Hurry it up.

1095
02:00:12,669 --> 02:00:14,380
Never mind the blathering!

1096
02:00:14,589 --> 02:00:16,549
We must put these down somewhere.

1097
02:00:16,758 --> 02:00:18,593
The sooner you get off the beach...

1098
02:00:18,801 --> 02:00:21,639
...the sooner they'll stop
this blasted shelling.

1099
02:00:21,847 --> 02:00:23,891
It's very bad for the dog!

1100
02:00:26,727 --> 02:00:28,563
Down, Winston, down!

1101
02:00:29,606 --> 02:00:32,233
Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A.

1102
02:00:32,442 --> 02:00:35,738
Third wave ashore on time.
No obstruction to follow-up.

1103
02:00:35,946 --> 02:00:37,531
Standing by.

1104
02:00:38,949 --> 02:00:40,493
Get going!

1105
02:00:40,869 --> 02:00:43,538
For heaven's sake,
get that carrier off the beach!

1106
02:00:43,747 --> 02:00:46,917
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your radio.

1107
02:00:47,125 --> 02:00:49,587
If you can't drive it, carry it!

1108
02:00:50,421 --> 02:00:51,422
You were saying?

1109
02:00:51,631 --> 02:00:54,300
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your...

1110
02:00:54,509 --> 02:00:57,930
My dear fellow, I don't want
to appear uncooperative...

1111
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:00,766
Yes, I know all about
the power of the press.

1112
02:01:00,975 --> 02:01:04,604
But this line happens
to be rather busy! Come on!

1113
02:01:08,693 --> 02:01:10,444
Down, Winston. Down, Winston.

1114
02:01:13,406 --> 02:01:14,615
What did he say?

1115
02:01:14,865 --> 02:01:16,535
The answer is no.

1116
02:01:16,785 --> 02:01:18,578
We have to use the damn pigeons.

1117
02:01:18,787 --> 02:01:20,497
I've got these ready.

1118
02:01:21,039 --> 02:01:22,667
Here, clip this on.

1119
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:38,893
They're going the wrong way.

1120
02:01:39,102 --> 02:01:41,104
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!

1121
02:01:41,313 --> 02:01:44,442
The other way! The other way!

1122
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:46,360
Damned traitors!

1123
02:01:46,569 --> 02:01:49,280
- Hold it.
- Can't you get your finger out?

1124
02:01:49,488 --> 02:01:50,449
What's the matter?

1125
02:01:50,657 --> 02:01:54,036
Engine won't start, sir.
Full of seawater, I think.

1126
02:01:55,495 --> 02:01:57,080
My old grandmother used to say...

1127
02:01:57,290 --> 02:02:00,001
...anything mechanical,
give it a good bash.

1128
02:02:00,585 --> 02:02:01,544
Try it now.

1129
02:02:05,007 --> 02:02:06,050
Thank you, sir.

1130
02:02:06,258 --> 02:02:07,760
Off you go. Good luck.

1131
02:02:12,682 --> 02:02:14,059
I'm sure that got it out.

1132
02:02:16,019 --> 02:02:18,189
That's what I call a hell of a man!

1133
02:02:18,397 --> 02:02:20,608
Aye, I like his dog too.

1134
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:23,444
Don't stand there yapping!

1135
02:02:23,653 --> 02:02:26,406
This isn't Hyde Park Corner!
The war's over there!

1136
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,035
Come along!

1137
02:02:30,243 --> 02:02:31,495
Come on!

1138
02:02:32,246 --> 02:02:35,291
- Thank you.
- Everything's going according to plan.

1139
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:38,796
Stand by to move.
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."

1140
02:02:49,975 --> 02:02:52,185
What in God's name...?

1141
02:02:56,357 --> 02:03:00,153
Oh, my friends. What a day!
What a day!

1142
02:03:00,445 --> 02:03:02,739
Welcome to France.
Welcome to Colleville!

1143
02:03:02,948 --> 02:03:05,117
Most kind of you.
Very nice to meet you...

1144
02:03:05,367 --> 02:03:07,495
Look at this. I kept it for you all.

1145
02:03:07,704 --> 02:03:10,540
But I don't think there
will be enough for everyone.

1146
02:03:10,748 --> 02:03:14,837
Perhaps next time. We have
a previous engagement: The war!

1147
02:03:15,838 --> 02:03:17,506
Mustn't lose that champagne!

1148
02:03:17,756 --> 02:03:20,885
All right, men, fall in!
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."

1149
02:03:22,512 --> 02:03:23,847
Goodbye.

1150
02:03:25,473 --> 02:03:28,352
Thank you, boys! Thank you!

1151
02:03:34,108 --> 02:03:36,862
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!

1152
02:03:38,071 --> 02:03:39,364
If you ask me, Flanagan...

1153
02:03:39,573 --> 02:03:43,036
...there's a lot of very
peculiar blokes on this beach.

1154
02:03:44,412 --> 02:03:45,955
Welcome!

1155
02:03:46,831 --> 02:03:48,584
Welcome to you all!

1156
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:43,423
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!

1157
02:05:45,508 --> 02:05:48,179
Better try them on first.

1158
02:05:52,683 --> 02:05:54,144
Rommel speaking.

1159
02:05:54,353 --> 02:05:55,812
Good morning.

1160
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:58,106
What?

1161
02:05:58,732 --> 02:06:00,109
What!

1162
02:06:00,777 --> 02:06:02,153
Where?

1163
02:06:02,612 --> 02:06:03,654
Normandy!

1164
02:06:04,697 --> 02:06:06,949
Have they a foothold already?

1165
02:06:07,409 --> 02:06:10,079
They must be thrown back!

1166
02:06:10,662 --> 02:06:12,790
What about the panzer reserves?

1167
02:06:13,874 --> 02:06:17,253
Did von Rundstedt obtain
their release from the FÃ¼hrer?

1168
02:06:28,725 --> 02:06:30,185
Normandy!

1169
02:06:34,356 --> 02:06:36,025
How stupid of me!

1170
02:06:52,085 --> 02:06:53,503
There it is.

1171
02:07:04,891 --> 02:07:07,561
You mean to tell me
that's all we gotta climb?

1172
02:07:07,769 --> 02:07:10,023
They're not as high
as the practice ones.

1173
02:07:10,231 --> 02:07:12,025
They wasn't shooting at us then.

1174
02:07:13,609 --> 02:07:16,029
Why can't the Air Force
or Navy do this job?

1175
02:07:16,237 --> 02:07:20,034
The big guns in bunkers behind the
cliff can't be seen from the air.

1176
02:07:20,242 --> 02:07:23,496
We knock them out or they'll
murder our guys on the beach.

1177
02:07:23,705 --> 02:07:25,457
Yeah, well if you ask me...

1178
02:07:25,665 --> 02:07:28,626
...three grandmothers with brooms
could sweep us off there...

1179
02:07:28,835 --> 02:07:30,796
...like flies off of a sugar cake.

1180
02:14:06,207 --> 02:14:08,084
That's it, the one we're after.

1181
02:15:05,024 --> 02:15:06,442
It's empty.

1182
02:15:06,901 --> 02:15:10,322
The Air Force and Navy
really plastered this baby.

1183
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:11,948
But I don't get...

1184
02:15:12,866 --> 02:15:14,242
The guns.

1185
02:15:14,951 --> 02:15:16,537
There ain't no mounts.

1186
02:15:17,371 --> 02:15:19,540
They've never even been installed.

1187
02:15:20,917 --> 02:15:22,126
You mean...

1188
02:15:23,003 --> 02:15:25,964
...we come up all this way...

1189
02:15:26,173 --> 02:15:27,758
...for nothing?

1190
02:15:32,806 --> 02:15:34,974
Don't worry, sarge,
you'll be all right.

1191
02:15:35,183 --> 02:15:37,478
Medic! Medic!

1192
02:15:46,446 --> 02:15:48,865
I wonder what "bitte, bitte" means?

1193
02:15:59,336 --> 02:16:03,090
What the hell are you
wearing a life preserver for?

1194
02:16:03,674 --> 02:16:05,468
I can't swim.

1195
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:18,108
Normandy. It really is Normandy.

1196
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:22,863
This is madness... madness...
sheer madness!

1197
02:16:26,409 --> 02:16:30,663
I just talked to General Jodl...
the FÃ¼hrer is awake.

1198
02:16:30,872 --> 02:16:36,462
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?

1199
02:16:37,296 --> 02:16:41,801
The FÃ¼hrer went into
one of his tantrums...

1200
02:16:42,385 --> 02:16:45,180
...and no one dared
bring up the subject.

1201
02:16:45,723 --> 02:16:47,892
They're still held in reserve!

1202
02:16:48,517 --> 02:16:50,644
Yes, Field Marshal.

1203
02:16:54,191 --> 02:16:56,651
Sir, if you would call
the FÃ¼hrer yourself...

1204
02:16:57,068 --> 02:17:00,406
...I am convinced he would
respect your views.

1205
02:17:00,698 --> 02:17:02,241
Call him?

1206
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:05,328
Call that Bohemian corporal?!

1207
02:17:06,245 --> 02:17:09,625
Crawl on my knees to him?!

1208
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:12,920
No! It is out of the question!

1209
02:17:16,424 --> 02:17:22,056
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

1210
02:17:22,473 --> 02:17:23,557
What's that?

1211
02:17:23,808 --> 02:17:27,103
Nothing... nothing of importance.

1212
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:30,690
Here, let me help you.

1213
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:35,071
You all right, Tom?
Come on, they're up there.

1214
02:17:39,367 --> 02:17:41,286
- Sir.
- Well?

1215
02:17:41,578 --> 02:17:44,915
Mr. Smith says to tell you
he's stood his men too.

1216
02:17:45,124 --> 02:17:47,292
The Jerries are moving up
into the woods...

1217
02:17:47,543 --> 02:17:49,462
...with machine guns and mortars.

1218
02:17:50,338 --> 02:17:53,383
- Tell the men to stand firm!
- Tell the chaps...

1219
02:17:53,591 --> 02:17:56,679
Tell them to expect another
counterattack, a heavy one.

1220
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,145
- Here you are, mate.
- Ta.

1221
02:18:07,149 --> 02:18:08,150
What's the matter?

1222
02:18:08,358 --> 02:18:10,945
Listen. I thought I heard bagpipes.

1223
02:18:11,154 --> 02:18:12,989
Don't be daft!

1224
02:18:21,707 --> 02:18:24,878
I told you I heard bagpipes!
It's the reinforcements.

1225
02:18:39,019 --> 02:18:40,103
It's Lovat!

1226
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:49,405
Come on!

1227
02:18:49,947 --> 02:18:51,450
Come on!

1228
02:19:18,439 --> 02:19:20,566
- Sorry I'm late.
- Better than never, sir.

1229
02:19:20,775 --> 02:19:22,193
Glad to see you, Shimmy.

1230
02:19:26,907 --> 02:19:30,077
You boys are right on target.
What's the situation?

1231
02:19:30,285 --> 02:19:33,248
Jerry's regrouping in the woods,
about a mile.

1232
02:19:33,581 --> 02:19:35,375
With mortars and machine guns.

1233
02:19:35,583 --> 02:19:36,543
Numbers?

1234
02:19:36,751 --> 02:19:40,589
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem
to be moving forward in force.

1235
02:19:42,466 --> 02:19:44,093
In that case, we won't wait.

1236
02:19:44,885 --> 02:19:46,304
We'd better get moving.

1237
02:19:46,972 --> 02:19:48,890
All right, we're going across.

1238
02:19:49,099 --> 02:19:50,308
- Millin!
- Sir?

1239
02:19:51,143 --> 02:19:52,769
"Black Bear," sir.

1240
02:19:53,229 --> 02:19:55,481
All right, come on.

1241
02:19:55,690 --> 02:19:57,150
Everybody up!

1242
02:19:57,650 --> 02:19:59,110
On your feet!

1243
02:20:05,492 --> 02:20:08,621
There he goes. He's at it again.

1244
02:20:08,997 --> 02:20:11,749
Ever hear such a bleeding racket
in all your life?

1245
02:20:11,958 --> 02:20:14,712
Yeah, it takes an Irishman
to play the pipes.

1246
02:20:30,313 --> 02:20:32,482
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

1247
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:34,442
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

1248
02:20:36,862 --> 02:20:41,701
North by east, north by east.
Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise is that way.

1249
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,078
Somebody turned that sign around.

1250
02:20:44,287 --> 02:20:47,999
Doesn't anybody in this outfit
look at a compass besides me?

1251
02:20:48,417 --> 02:20:49,752
Hey, you guys!

1252
02:20:50,002 --> 02:20:53,672
Over here! Over here!

1253
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:56,885
Over here, on the double.

1254
02:20:59,554 --> 02:21:01,890
- Where you taking that?
- We don't know, sir.

1255
02:21:02,098 --> 02:21:03,976
We took the wrong road.

1256
02:21:04,852 --> 02:21:06,604
What do you got in here, ammo?

1257
02:21:06,854 --> 02:21:08,147
Yes, sir.

1258
02:21:08,523 --> 02:21:09,483
You 82nd?

1259
02:21:09,691 --> 02:21:11,235
No, sir, 101.

1260
02:21:11,443 --> 02:21:14,112
Well, you're in the 82nd now.

1261
02:21:15,239 --> 02:21:17,367
- But, sir, we're...
- But what?

1262
02:21:17,575 --> 02:21:18,952
Nothing, sir.

1263
02:21:19,869 --> 02:21:21,704
All right, move out.

1264
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:27,628
- Knock that sign down!
- Yes, sir.

1265
02:21:33,969 --> 02:21:37,807
- Something's moving up there, colonel.
- Hit the dirt! Take cover.

1266
02:21:41,018 --> 02:21:42,979
Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company.

1267
02:21:45,315 --> 02:21:47,609
Colonel, it's me!

1268
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:52,490
- Where did you come from?
- Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise.

1269
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:55,451
We hold the main road
and north side of the square.

1270
02:21:55,702 --> 02:21:58,831
The Germans have a battery
on the other side of the town...

1271
02:21:59,039 --> 02:22:01,584
...and command the countryside.
- And Major Lance?

1272
02:22:01,792 --> 02:22:05,505
- Holed up in a building in the square.
- F Company?

1273
02:22:06,214 --> 02:22:09,885
They overshot the drop zone
and landed in the middle of the town.

1274
02:22:10,093 --> 02:22:11,136
Go on.

1275
02:22:11,386 --> 02:22:14,223
It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter.

1276
02:22:14,474 --> 02:22:17,101
They were mowed down
before they hit the ground.

1277
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,109
Major Lance sent me to try
and contact you, sir.

1278
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:27,906
He wants your permission to pull back
and regroup outside of town.

1279
02:22:30,742 --> 02:22:35,498
No, damn it. We came here
to take Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise.

1280
02:22:35,706 --> 02:22:37,625
We're gonna take it and hold it.

1281
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:41,421
Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen.

1282
02:22:52,391 --> 02:22:54,770
- Sir.
- Thank you.

1283
02:22:56,104 --> 02:22:59,983
British and Canadians advancing
steadily from Sword, Gold, and Juno.

1284
02:23:03,321 --> 02:23:05,198
Anything from Omaha?

1285
02:23:05,448 --> 02:23:09,662
Nothing since the first message:
Heavy fighting, heavy casualties.

1286
02:23:09,870 --> 02:23:11,080
Sir.

1287
02:23:14,417 --> 02:23:15,669
Omaha?

1288
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:18,547
No.

1289
02:23:22,176 --> 02:23:26,013
I can't understand why Jerry hasn't
brought his heavy armor into play.

1290
02:23:26,848 --> 02:23:29,476
All the panzer divisions
except the 21 st...

1291
02:23:29,726 --> 02:23:32,271
...seem to be sitting it out
in the rear.

1292
02:23:32,855 --> 02:23:33,897
Sir.

1293
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:40,822
French commandos driving inland
from Sword...

1294
02:23:41,072 --> 02:23:43,367
...have reached the outskirts
of Ouistreham.

1295
02:23:44,034 --> 02:23:45,578
Ouistreham.

1296
02:26:36,315 --> 02:26:38,067
Fall back!

1297
02:26:40,861 --> 02:26:42,489
Take cover!

1298
02:26:58,215 --> 02:27:02,302
Tank support!
We must have tank support!

1299
02:27:48,856 --> 02:27:50,566
I can't get them!

1300
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:53,028
Keep trying! We must have support!

1301
02:27:53,653 --> 02:27:58,033
Hold your positions...
I'm going for a tank!

1302
02:27:59,327 --> 02:28:01,787
Give us as much cover as you can!

1303
02:28:49,884 --> 02:28:51,261
Fire!

1304
02:28:56,308 --> 02:28:57,685
Try for the cannon!

1305
02:29:03,275 --> 02:29:05,735
Get the wounded out of here!

1306
02:29:33,767 --> 02:29:34,810
Go back!

1307
02:29:35,644 --> 02:29:37,022
Get out of here!

1308
02:29:56,084 --> 02:29:58,254
You can't stay here!

1309
02:29:58,463 --> 02:30:01,257
I am Mother Superior of the convent.

1310
02:30:01,466 --> 02:30:03,969
The sisters are qualified nurses.

1311
02:30:04,178 --> 02:30:09,391
But Madame... I mean, Mother,
we're in the middle of a battle!

1312
02:30:12,395 --> 02:30:14,356
Take care of the wounded.

1313
02:30:49,896 --> 02:30:50,939
It's a tank!

1314
02:30:53,693 --> 02:30:55,111
It's Kieffer!

1315
02:31:05,414 --> 02:31:07,542
In the other direction!

1316
02:31:18,387 --> 02:31:21,808
Clear away the debris! Hurry!

1317
02:31:58,808 --> 02:32:01,228
But where is the Luftwaffe?!

1318
02:32:01,436 --> 02:32:02,438
I'm trying...

1319
02:32:02,688 --> 02:32:04,607
Yeah, yeah, you're trying.

1320
02:32:12,699 --> 02:32:17,413
The British troops have a beachhead
here. They are moving inland.

1321
02:32:17,622 --> 02:32:23,504
The Americans hold Ste-MÃ¨re-Eglise
and have cut the highway.

1322
02:32:23,712 --> 02:32:26,840
We control this center section.

1323
02:32:27,383 --> 02:32:32,722
The Americans have landed but
their attack has bogged down.

1324
02:32:33,390 --> 02:32:36,268
Rommel is right...

1325
02:32:36,519 --> 02:32:39,981
If we can hold them on the beaches...

1326
02:32:40,231 --> 02:32:42,233
...the invasion will collapse.

1327
02:33:19,109 --> 02:33:20,235
That thing still work?

1328
02:33:20,444 --> 02:33:22,613
Yes, sir, now and then.

1329
02:33:22,821 --> 02:33:25,366
- Anything from the other beaches?
- Not directly.

1330
02:33:25,575 --> 02:33:29,120
A while ago the sergeant picked up
some flashes from the destroyers.

1331
02:33:29,996 --> 02:33:34,209
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach
and moving inland.

1332
02:33:34,418 --> 02:33:35,794
Inland?

1333
02:33:38,213 --> 02:33:41,343
- What about the 1 st Division?
- They're hung up, sir.

1334
02:33:41,551 --> 02:33:43,011
Like we are.

1335
02:33:47,433 --> 02:33:48,809
Move out.

1336
02:34:08,082 --> 02:34:10,459
- What do you think?
- Think?

1337
02:34:11,377 --> 02:34:14,673
We must have close to a thousand
casualties up to now.

1338
02:34:14,881 --> 02:34:17,550
Do you want me to have the ships
start picking us up?

1339
02:34:18,343 --> 02:34:20,972
- You think it's that bad?
- I don't see what else to do.

1340
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:23,099
We can't get up this hill.

1341
02:34:23,307 --> 02:34:26,018
If we don't get off this beach,
we won't have any division left.

1342
02:34:26,227 --> 02:34:27,228
What?

1343
02:34:28,313 --> 02:34:30,107
These are our men, Tom.

1344
02:34:30,315 --> 02:34:34,404
You think we brought them in so some
die and ask the rest to turn tail?

1345
02:34:34,612 --> 02:34:37,407
Hell, no.
We're gonna get up that hill.

1346
02:34:37,615 --> 02:34:40,201
Find me somebody to speak
for the Rangers.

1347
02:34:40,410 --> 02:34:43,163
Back down the beach
on the right there's a gully.

1348
02:34:43,497 --> 02:34:48,461
With a heavily defended roadblock
and machine gun nests on both sides.

1349
02:34:48,670 --> 02:34:51,798
- If we can blow our way through...
- We've hit it three times.

1350
02:34:52,007 --> 02:34:54,467
- We didn't get close.
- Three times isn't enough.

1351
02:34:54,718 --> 02:34:58,097
We're gonna hit it again.
Can you find me some engineers?

1352
02:34:58,306 --> 02:34:59,265
They're all around you!

1353
02:34:59,473 --> 02:35:01,809
I mean engineers
with equipment still working.

1354
02:35:03,604 --> 02:35:05,439
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?

1355
02:35:05,647 --> 02:35:06,898
No, damn it!

1356
02:35:07,107 --> 02:35:11,195
We need bangalore torpedoes,
bazookas, mortars, wire cutters...

1357
02:35:11,446 --> 02:35:14,115
...and every man that can stand.
Pass the word, will you?

1358
02:35:15,909 --> 02:35:17,328
Okay, Norm.

1359
02:35:33,930 --> 02:35:36,349
Now listen to me, all of you.

1360
02:35:37,059 --> 02:35:39,353
You guys got to snap out of it.

1361
02:35:39,603 --> 02:35:42,481
We're getting off of here,
and we're going inland.

1362
02:35:42,731 --> 02:35:45,693
What about weapons, General?
My men lost everything.

1363
02:35:45,902 --> 02:35:48,321
They gotta have something
to fight with.

1364
02:35:48,529 --> 02:35:50,365
Strip the dead and the wounded.

1365
02:35:50,573 --> 02:35:52,576
Pick up anything that'll shoot.

1366
02:35:52,785 --> 02:35:55,496
I don't have to tell you the score,
you all know it.

1367
02:35:55,704 --> 02:35:58,667
Only two kinds of people
are gonna stay on this beach:

1368
02:35:58,875 --> 02:36:02,837
Those that are already dead and those
that will die. Get off your butts!

1369
02:36:03,046 --> 02:36:05,758
You guys are the fighting 29th!

1370
02:36:23,278 --> 02:36:25,029
I've looked at the naval reports.

1371
02:36:25,238 --> 02:36:26,365
Yes?

1372
02:36:27,199 --> 02:36:31,328
According to reports from the offshore
destroyers, Omaha is a shambles.

1373
02:36:31,787 --> 02:36:34,541
There's no evidence...
To quote the report exactly:

1374
02:36:34,749 --> 02:36:39,087
"There is no evidence of any movement
that can be observed off the beach."

1375
02:36:41,090 --> 02:36:42,842
I'd better have a look through these.

1376
02:36:46,430 --> 02:36:47,889
How is Ike taking it?

1377
02:36:48,098 --> 02:36:51,893
Like everybody else, sir.
Hanging on by his fingernails.

1378
02:36:54,272 --> 02:36:58,026
No, no! We must regroup
according to Plan Six!

1379
02:37:04,908 --> 02:37:06,201
Can you hear me?

1380
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:09,914
I said we must regroup
according to Plan Six.

1381
02:37:10,915 --> 02:37:12,751
Nonsense!

1382
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:16,255
If the panzers arrive, we still
have time to use them.

1383
02:37:19,884 --> 02:37:22,012
We'll drive to the coast!

1384
02:37:22,387 --> 02:37:24,306
Shall we remove the files?

1385
02:37:24,723 --> 02:37:29,312
I don't care! I want to get to the
front at once... to Normandy!

1386
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:30,647
Yes, General.

1387
02:37:58,011 --> 02:38:00,347
- Where is everybody?
- What?

1388
02:38:02,767 --> 02:38:04,978
I said, where is everybody?

1389
02:38:07,438 --> 02:38:09,399
I can't hear you.

1390
02:38:10,651 --> 02:38:12,528
It's them bells.

1391
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:15,614
I've had them in my ears
for 10 hours.

1392
02:38:15,823 --> 02:38:18,827
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

1393
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:22,914
Hey, Sergeant, where's Major Lance?

1394
02:38:23,123 --> 02:38:25,459
We moved the CP to that
building. The major's there.

1395
02:38:25,668 --> 02:38:27,545
Get him, the colonel's here.

1396
02:38:29,046 --> 02:38:30,214
What?

1397
02:38:32,217 --> 02:38:33,427
Hold it!

1398
02:38:44,063 --> 02:38:46,317
Colonel, am I glad to see you!

1399
02:38:47,443 --> 02:38:50,571
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.

1400
02:38:50,779 --> 02:38:53,199
Why are you leaving them up there?
Get them down!

1401
02:38:53,408 --> 02:38:55,201
But we've been under fire, sir.

1402
02:38:55,410 --> 02:38:57,412
I know you have, but I don't care!

1403
02:38:57,621 --> 02:38:59,832
Get them down! Down!

1404
02:39:00,207 --> 02:39:04,170
- I don't want those boys left there.
- Take a detail and cut them down.

1405
02:39:04,378 --> 02:39:06,256
- At once!
- Yes, sir.

1406
02:39:10,469 --> 02:39:15,141
Has there been a linkup between our
forces and the troops from the sea?

1407
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:19,605
I don't know, Major. I don't even
know if the landings took place.

1408
02:39:19,813 --> 02:39:24,610
But I am sure we're gonna hold
this town until the linkup does come.

1409
02:39:24,818 --> 02:39:29,366
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow,
till hell freezes over.

1410
02:39:30,951 --> 02:39:32,870
For their sake,
if for no other reason.

1411
02:39:33,079 --> 02:39:35,581
Show me the enemy positions.

1412
02:39:35,790 --> 02:39:38,668
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point
is right there.

1413
02:39:38,876 --> 02:39:41,713
That's over there on the hill.
They've got no tanks yet.

1414
02:39:41,922 --> 02:39:46,009
They've got heavy guns and machine
gun positions at the top of that road.

1415
02:39:46,218 --> 02:39:48,054
How many men have you got?

1416
02:39:48,805 --> 02:39:49,764
Not enough.

1417
02:39:50,014 --> 02:39:53,894
Lt. Wilson will take A Company
and reinforce Major Lance.

1418
02:39:54,561 --> 02:39:59,316
The rest of the command will follow us
straight up that road.

1419
02:40:00,568 --> 02:40:01,653
Good luck, Major.

1420
02:40:01,861 --> 02:40:04,447
All right, A Company, fall out.

1421
02:40:04,656 --> 02:40:06,741
- Private.
- Yes, sir.

1422
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:08,119
It's a helluva war.

1423
02:40:08,327 --> 02:40:10,871
It's a privilege to serve
with you, colonel.

1424
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:15,127
Well, God willing, we'll do
what we came here to do.

1425
02:40:15,335 --> 02:40:17,212
Ready, sir.

1426
02:40:17,504 --> 02:40:19,214
Move out!

1427
02:40:29,476 --> 02:40:33,022
The old man sure has changed
since yesterday.

1428
02:40:38,903 --> 02:40:41,197
Or maybe it's just
that we've changed...

1429
02:40:42,283 --> 02:40:43,909
...since yesterday.

1430
02:40:51,668 --> 02:40:54,296
Lovat and his commandos
have reached the bridge.

1431
02:40:55,422 --> 02:40:56,883
Bob, did you hear?

1432
02:40:57,550 --> 02:40:59,135
Yes, I heard.

1433
02:41:00,511 --> 02:41:05,059
"Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise captured
by units of the 82nd Airborne."

1434
02:41:06,894 --> 02:41:09,730
"101 Airborne driving on Utah."

1435
02:41:09,939 --> 02:41:12,651
That's good. Good.

1436
02:41:13,068 --> 02:41:17,990
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha
it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.

1437
02:41:18,199 --> 02:41:21,661
We'll have two cut-off beachheads,
one in British zone and one at Utah.

1438
02:41:21,869 --> 02:41:22,912
Yes...

1439
02:41:23,245 --> 02:41:25,415
...and the Germans in between.

1440
02:41:40,891 --> 02:41:42,726
You guys engineers?

1441
02:41:44,144 --> 02:41:45,897
Yes, sir. 299th.

1442
02:41:46,106 --> 02:41:49,025
Where are your officers?
Who's in charge here?

1443
02:41:49,609 --> 02:41:52,113
I guess I am, sir.
None of our officers made it in.

1444
02:41:52,321 --> 02:41:54,365
What about your equipment?
Those torpedoes work?

1445
02:41:54,573 --> 02:41:56,575
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!

1446
02:41:57,952 --> 02:42:00,622
- What's your name, Sergeant?
- It's Fuller, sir, John H.

1447
02:42:00,956 --> 02:42:04,459
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on,
whether you like it or not.

1448
02:42:07,005 --> 02:42:10,550
You send some men down to the foot
of that gully with those torpedoes.

1449
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,511
You and the rest of the men follow me.

1450
02:42:12,761 --> 02:42:14,555
Yes, sir!

1451
02:42:14,805 --> 02:42:18,350
All right, men!
Let's move that equipment down here.

1452
02:42:24,733 --> 02:42:28,154
- I got a rifle, sir.
- Well, good for you, son!

1453
02:42:28,821 --> 02:42:30,156
The Rangers are ready, General.

1454
02:42:30,364 --> 02:42:32,867
Okay, Major, move them out.

1455
02:42:33,075 --> 02:42:35,829
Captain, move them up.

1456
02:42:36,038 --> 02:42:38,248
Move them up!

1457
02:42:40,460 --> 02:42:42,337
- Well, Tom?
- We're ready.

1458
02:42:42,545 --> 02:42:44,172
As ready as we'll ever be.

1459
02:42:44,380 --> 02:42:47,217
It'll work. It's got to work.

1460
02:42:49,011 --> 02:42:53,390
We're getting murdered here! We might
as well move inland and get murdered!

1461
02:42:57,395 --> 02:42:58,980
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

1462
02:42:59,189 --> 02:43:01,859
You're gonna blow
that roadblock for me.

1463
02:43:02,068 --> 02:43:04,612
When I give the word
everything pops at once. Okay?

1464
02:43:04,862 --> 02:43:05,738
Yes, sir.

1465
02:43:33,353 --> 02:43:36,983
First, we gotta blow a hole
through that wire with bangalores.

1466
02:43:37,233 --> 02:43:40,069
If that works, we'll pack
everything we've got into that wall.

1467
02:43:42,321 --> 02:43:43,907
All right, let's go!

1468
02:46:43,613 --> 02:46:48,201
All right, let's go! Go! Go!

1469
02:47:47,519 --> 02:47:51,148
We must leave. The main highway
is under aerial attack.

1470
02:47:51,356 --> 02:47:53,026
You don't say!

1471
02:49:30,554 --> 02:49:32,013
Don't worry, Yank.

1472
02:49:37,186 --> 02:49:38,271
He's dead.

1473
02:49:59,795 --> 02:50:03,674
Give me a cigarette.
I'm dying for a cigarette.

1474
02:50:11,559 --> 02:50:13,019
You hurt bad?

1475
02:50:16,939 --> 02:50:18,942
Shot down during the night.

1476
02:50:22,905 --> 02:50:27,077
He was gonna make sure of me,
but I got him...

1477
02:50:27,494 --> 02:50:28,953
...with this.

1478
02:50:39,591 --> 02:50:43,553
You ever killed a man?
I mean, face to face?

1479
02:50:45,389 --> 02:50:46,391
No.

1480
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:51,270
Neither had I, face to face.

1481
02:50:54,817 --> 02:50:57,277
I've been sitting here looking at him.

1482
02:50:58,904 --> 02:51:01,616
Have you noticed anything peculiar
about him?

1483
02:51:11,502 --> 02:51:12,628
No.

1484
02:51:14,339 --> 02:51:16,091
He's got his boots...

1485
02:51:16,425 --> 02:51:18,593
...on the wrong feet.

1486
02:51:26,144 --> 02:51:28,105
He must have been
in a big hurry, huh?

1487
02:51:30,315 --> 02:51:31,567
Is it bad?

1488
02:51:34,445 --> 02:51:36,322
Split wide open...

1489
02:51:37,532 --> 02:51:39,743
...from the crotch to the knee.

1490
02:51:40,452 --> 02:51:44,457
A medic came along and gave me
a shot of morphine.

1491
02:51:47,168 --> 02:51:49,755
I hope he'll be back
before it wears off.

1492
02:51:50,922 --> 02:51:52,299
He said he would.

1493
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,971
Did he sew you up?

1494
02:52:00,808 --> 02:52:04,563
Well, when he came to shore
he lost most of his equipment.

1495
02:52:07,524 --> 02:52:09,360
So he pinned it together...

1496
02:52:10,403 --> 02:52:12,489
...with safety pins.

1497
02:52:24,086 --> 02:52:25,670
Getting on toward night.

1498
02:52:33,846 --> 02:52:35,139
You know something?

1499
02:52:36,682 --> 02:52:38,685
I haven't fired my gun all day.

1500
02:52:39,186 --> 02:52:42,981
I keep hearing shooting, but every
time I get there, everybody's gone.

1501
02:52:46,861 --> 02:52:48,321
Funny, isn't it?

1502
02:52:49,697 --> 02:52:50,950
He's dead.

1503
02:52:52,201 --> 02:52:53,828
I'm crippled.

1504
02:52:54,995 --> 02:52:56,664
You're lost.

1505
02:52:59,209 --> 02:53:01,086
I suppose it's always like that.

1506
02:53:03,046 --> 02:53:04,589
I mean war.

1507
02:53:12,099 --> 02:53:13,934
I wonder who won.

1508
02:53:56,816 --> 02:53:59,486
Okay, run me up the hill, son.
