1
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,980
Well, Miss Timberlake, back again
for a little of the taxpayers' money, hmm?

2
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,031
- So did you work last week?
- No.

3
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,161
- Are you available for work?
- Yes.

4
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,290
- Did you turn down any jobs?
- No.

5
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,298
- Are you busy tonight?
- Yes.

6
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:27,804
If, in our opinion,
the applicant hasn't exercised

7
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:30,766
proper diligence in seeking employment,

8
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,314
we can withhold payment of cheques.

9
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,445
Perhaps tomorrow night?

10
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:40,246
There's a wonderful little diner
round the corner from where I live

11
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,214
and after dinner we could, uh, well...

12
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,059
...perhaps...
- Go up to your apartment?

13
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:54,563
- Well, I, uh...
- If you want me to go up to your apartment

14
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:59,328
come out and ask. That way I can
think about it and make a decision.

15
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:03,005
Would you like to stop off at my place?

16
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:07,477
- May I have my cheque?
- Oh. Of course.

17
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:18,917
Well?

18
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,960
I would enjoy going out with you,
Mr Beasley,

19
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,259
if I didn't find you so personally distasteful.

20
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:31,265
You're a sneaky, crude, offensive man.

21
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,397
That's just how I feel.

22
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:37,873
I'm sure there are hundreds of girls
who admire those qualities.

23
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,747
I circled the entire area, sir.

24
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:45,095
- There's no sign of her.
- Darn. Thank you, Collins.

25
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:52,099
Hit and run's a dangerous sport, Mr Shayne,
even for the privileged class.

26
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,109
Even if this victim survives,
what can she do? Sue you?

27
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:01,117
With your money, you can run down half
the girls in New York and still be solvent.

28
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,417
We hit a puddle, splashed the girl.

29
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:06,257
Would you have me stop, tie up the traffic,

30
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:09,513
crawl through the rain
and beg forgiveness?

31
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:13,103
A decent gesture like that
would never occur to you.

32
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:16,899
So I'll set up a foundation
for waterlogged girls.

33
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,616
Isn't it a little early for cocktails?

34
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,246
I'm perfectly aware of what I'm doing.

35
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,960
- I have an analyst. Dr Gruber.
- I know.

36
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,801
A distinguished analyst. I know exactly
what started me drinking at this hour.

37
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,850
- What?
- Dr Gruber, he's a lush.

38
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,649
Seven years of treating you could do it.

39
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,779
- Yeah.
- Look out.

40
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,203
- He's a brilliant man. Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

41
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:45,421
He put his finger right on my problem -
my lack of integrity.

42
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,760
You were a humble but respected
professor of economics at Princeton.

43
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,936
Students sat at my feet
absorbing my wisdom.

44
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,270
The lvy League Socrates.

45
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,069
Then you came along
dangling $50,000 a year under my nose

46
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,869
and, to my everlasting shame, I sold out.

47
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,833
And every year you further humiliate me
by raising my salary.

48
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,261
Inexcusable.
Like rubbing salt in the wounds.

49
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:12,601
And at Christmas
you gave me stock in the company.

50
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:16,191
- Why are you trying to destroy me?
- Just my natural hostility.

51
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,032
Excuse me.
Benson's attorneys say he still won't sell.

52
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:23,289
Roger, you researched that company.
What's it worth?

53
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,541
General Electronics? Six million.

54
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,757
Offer six and a quarter,
tell him it's top dollar.

55
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:30,260
Yes, sir.

56
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,102
Roger, if that deal goes through,
you're in for a bonus.

57
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:35,397
Bonus?

58
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:38,736
- Haven't you any conscience?
- What?

59
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:44,206
Just when I'm reaching a point where I'll
have the courage to go back to Princeton.

60
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:46,626
- Would it help if I fired you?
- No!

61
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:50,136
Dr Gruber said this would be
the worst time for that.

62
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,265
- Why?
- I owe him quite a bit of money.

63
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,811
He's brilliant!

64
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,941
Wait a minute. Yes?

65
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:02,198
- 'Mrs Haskell and Mrs Farnum are here.'
- I'll see them in a moment.

66
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,332
- There she is!
- Who?

67
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:06,461
- That girl I splashed.
- Where?

68
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:10,634
Just went into the automat.
Roger, go and apologise for me.

69
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:14,015
She's a blonde in a raincoat
with a leather collar.

70
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,731
This is in case I damaged her clothes.

71
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:20,329
I'm a highly paid executive,
not a messenger boy.

72
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,795
OK, I'll go.

73
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:27,378
You hired me as your financial adviser.

74
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,427
Wouldn't send Bernard Baruch out
to pay off a girl for you.

75
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,312
Oh, yes, you would.

76
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,248
Connie?

77
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,010
Connie! Yoo-hoo!

78
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,980
- Where are you?
- In the cucumbers.

79
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:58,576
Hi.

80
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:02,698
That's the first smiling face today.
I only get hungry ones.

81
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:05,459
What'll it be? Chicken pie or turkey leg?

82
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,963
Chicken.

83
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,641
How'd it go today? Any luck?

84
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:18,731
All bad. Some idiot splashed me
with his car, practically ruined my dress.

85
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,742
You should see me. He never even stopped.

86
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:24,870
- Then I had to face Beasley.
- What a parlay!

87
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,585
How is the playboy
of the 8th Avenue unemployment office?

88
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:32,428
He asked me to his apartment.
I told him what I thought of him.

89
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,099
- Au gratin or baked potato?
- Baked.

90
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,447
He's not worth the trouble.
Does a snake know he's a snake?

91
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:44,372
He crawls on his stomach
and thinks he's a king.

92
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:47,961
Right. You know, you're a philosopher.

93
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:52,552
When a girl of my age still isn't married,
you either philosophise or get arrested.

94
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:54,477
- Carrots or peas?
- Carrots.

95
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:01,949
Cathy, your problem is how to keep
your honour AND your job.

96
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:05,661
Men see you and suddenly their wives
just don't understand them.

97
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,332
I've never done anything to encourage them.

98
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:11,049
You don't have to, nature did it for you.

99
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,551
- Jell-o?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:19,024
Now, there are just so many jobs for girls
who can operate computing machines.

101
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:22,282
The next job you get, you'll listen to me.

102
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:24,411
You don't comb your hair, no make-up,

103
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:28,206
wear military heels,
you remind them of their wives.

104
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:32,134
They figure this they can get at home
so they leave you alone.

105
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:36,642
Have some cake, it might make your
skin break out. See you later, honey.

106
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,607
OK. Hey, I have an interview after lunch

107
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:42,449
- so I'll call you when it's over.
- Good.

108
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,252
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

109
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:48,425
Mr Miller.

110
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,715
Miss Emerson.

111
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:54,555
Are you familiar with company policy
on giving away free food?

112
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,519
No, sir. Are we for it or against it?

113
00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:00,900
That will cost you
one dollar and twelve cents.

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,698
However, I might be willing
to overlook the incident

115
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,542
if you, uh, introduce me to your friend.

116
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:11,254
- How is Mrs Miller?
- She doesn't understand me.

117
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:13,809
I could've made book on that answer.

118
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,494
Excuse me,
were you struck by a car this morning?

119
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,421
- What?
- Splattered by a limousine?

120
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,588
Oh. Yes, I certainly was.

121
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:35,809
The gentleman who owns the car
has offices across the street.

122
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:40,442
He saw you from his window
and sent me to convey his regrets.

123
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:44,116
I should think a gentleman
would apologise himself.

124
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:47,912
- Well, Mr Shayne's a very busy man.
- Oh, really?

125
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:52,550
Is that why he didn't stop?
That's leaving the scene of an accident.

126
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,763
If there was any damage done...

127
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,981
My raincoat was practically ruined.
And look at this dress.

128
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:02,987
I've been authorised to compensate you
for any damage done.

129
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,701
- Well, you just tell Mr...
- Shayne.

130
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:08,915
...Shayne, that money
does not buy good manners.

131
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,046
I wish I could tell him that myself.

132
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,926
- Do you? Really?
- I certainly do.

133
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:15,846
You're right!

134
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:19,688
How would you feel?
Here I am, he practically runs me down

135
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,819
and then drives right away!

136
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,159
And doesn't have the decency
to apologise himself.

137
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,749
Furthermore I have a job interview
and have to go like this.

138
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,337
- He doesn't care.
- Ohhh.

139
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,265
- You know what I'd like to do?
- Throw the money in his face?

140
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,959
Exactly!

141
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,276
I'd like to throw that money right in his face.

142
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,404
- Would you?
- Yes, I would.

143
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,284
I've waited seven years for this moment.

144
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,421
You come with me.

145
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,844
Say, Connie,
there's a man dragging Cathy out.

146
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:59,563
Gee. They don't even
give her a chance to eat.

147
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:09,998
She's gonna spend the rest of her life
saying, "I'm not that kind of a girl."

148
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:14,560
I'm only afraid that some day,
before she can finish saying it, she will be.

149
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,560
There you are.

150
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,697
The Manhattan Home for Young Women
thanks you for your generous donation

151
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:26,949
and for permitting us to use your name

152
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,415
- in our fundraising drive.
- Well, it's a worthy cause.

153
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:35,636
There's a great need to provide
an atmosphere of care and understanding

154
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,766
during this critical period.

155
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,979
You'd be shocked
that the rate of unwed mothers...

156
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,155
Charlotte, we don't
call them unwed mothers.

157
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:48,456
...that the rate of unfortunate girls
has tripled in five years.

158
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:51,295
- It's a deplorable situation.
- Yes, yes.

159
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,007
There's one consolation, Mrs Farnum -

160
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,355
for every unwed mother,
there's an unwed father.

161
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,521
I never thought of it that way.

162
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,279
Well, thank you again, Mr Shayne.

163
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,615
- Goodbye, Mr Shayne.
- Goodbye.

164
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:12,130
Wasn't it sweet of him
to contribute so generously?

165
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,385
Mr Shayne doesn't deny he's responsible
for what happened to me?

166
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:18,516
- No.
- The least he could've done

167
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:23,107
was come to see me himself instead
of sending someone over with money.

168
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,906
Some men have no sense
of moral obligation.

169
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:30,497
Same thing happened to my friend Connie.
He never even told her his name.

170
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,629
No. Have a seat.

171
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,764
I'll tell him you're here.

172
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:40,234
My dear, when the time comes,
call this number.

173
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,449
Psst! Miss Timberlake.

174
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:53,588
No wonder he donated so generously.
Guilt feelings.

175
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:56,051
Now, Evelyn, we must be realistic.

176
00:13:56,151 --> 00:14:01,146
When a man donates $200,000,
he's entitled to use the facilities.

177
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:06,739
He's in there, he'll be right out.
Don't forget what you're gonna say -

178
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,037
reckless driving,
leaving the scene of an accident,

179
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:12,540
bad manners, then the money in the face!

180
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,257
There are few other things I'd do
if I weren't a lady.

181
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:19,806
This is no time to think of sex. Now, go!

182
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,361
Mr Shayne, Miss Timberlake.

183
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,701
Miss Timberlake?

184
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:31,001
Go get him.
Miss Timberlake has something to say.

185
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,015
Yes?

186
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:38,179
I- I'd like to apologise

187
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,520
uh, for getting in your way this morning.

188
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,899
- It was entirely my fault.
- I was practically jaywalking.

189
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,826
- You had a perfect right to be on the kerb.
- I was leaning over.

190
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:54,795
I'm sorry I couldn't stop. My driver circled
the block but when we got back you'd gone.

191
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,676
- Leaving the scene of an accident.
- Oh.

192
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:01,308
I don't know why I left.
I must have gotten panicky.

193
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,979
Him, not you!

194
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,328
Roger, don't you have a letter
to get off to Princeton?

195
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:13,958
I should've come down to the restaurant
to apologise but I had some people here.

196
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:18,430
Knowing how busy you are, I'm surprised
you found time to send anyone.

197
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,892
If I've damaged anything in any way...

198
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:24,024
Oh, not really.

199
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:29,197
Water's good for raincoats,
and there's just a few spots on my dress.

200
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,331
- I'll be glad to pay for a new dress.
- No, thank you.

201
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,423
I was going on an interview,
it wasn't important.

202
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:39,138
You can't go on an interview like that.
Come with me.

203
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:43,857
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne?'
- Send up the valet.

204
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:48,491
You can have your things back
in 20 minutes. You can change in there.

205
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:53,299
There's a bathroom on your right and in that
closet there's a topcoat you can wear.

206
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:57,092
Well, go on, do as I tell you.

207
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,181
That's right.

208
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,107
- Connie, it's for you.
- Oh. Thanks.

209
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:06,444
Hello? Cathy?

210
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:09,701
- Where'd you go?
- Across the street in Mr Shayne's office.

211
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,580
- What about your lunch?
- Once I get my dress back.

212
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,340
What floor are you on?
Millie, get the cleaver!

213
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,300
Honey, we'll be right over.

214
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,769
Connie, I'm all right. He sent my dress out
to have it cleaned.

215
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:24,775
See you later.

216
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,788
Sent it out to have it cleaned?

217
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,667
I have heard of sneaky ways
to undress a girl but...

218
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,763
Isn't that the man
who took Cathy out of here?

219
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:42,521
Let me see.

220
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,568
That's the one.

221
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:02,432
The tractor division should show
an increase in earnings.

222
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:06,067
Fine. Now we're back
to General Electronics.

223
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,907
Still no breakthrough.

224
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,602
Come in.

225
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,420
- Ooh, I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute, whoa.

226
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:20,012
- Come on in.
- Mr Shayne, I thought you were alone.

227
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,977
Um, it didn't come back yet
and I have an appointment.

228
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,110
All right, I'll check on it.

229
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,534
Wait a minute.
Gentlemen, this is Miss Timberlake.

230
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,952
- How do you do?
- Come on in.

231
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,837
- Oh, I didn't want to interrupt.
- You're not interrupting.

232
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:42,809
Miss Timberlake, we need to know
why a man won't sell a company

233
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:46,358
when we've offered him
more than it's worth. Go ahead.

234
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:50,115
Well, we've tried everyone.

235
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:54,834
We talked to Benson's lawyers,
his directors and his executive assistant.

236
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:58,341
Now, who else is there to talk to?

237
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,476
There, you see.

238
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,523
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?

239
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,018
Well...

240
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:09,748
no.

241
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,291
No, they haven't talked to Mr Benson.

242
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,795
Well, the same thing happened
to my Aunt Rachel.

243
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:23,477
Um, this man she knows in the next town
kept sending her letters proposing to her,

244
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,022
and she just kept turning him down.

245
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:32,078
Now, she wanted to get married but
she felt that he should've asked in person.

246
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:35,793
There, you see, gentlemen.

247
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:40,800
Perhaps Mr Benson is eager to become
a bride but has never been asked.

248
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,144
How would your Aunt Rachel have felt
about a phone call?

249
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:47,856
Oh, no. She wouldn't say yes
till he came to the house.

250
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:49,988
They have eight children now.

251
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,368
Well, that couldn't have happened
over the phone.

252
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:56,083
Miss Timberlake,

253
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,592
how would you like to go for a ride with me?
Come on.

254
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:02,054
What are you doing in Baltimore?

255
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:05,062
I'm here with Mr Shayne. We...

256
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,607
Well, of course I've got my clothes on.

257
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:10,654
Connie, we flew here in his private plane.

258
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:15,163
Gosh, you should see it,
it's completely furnished. Even has a bar.

259
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:18,922
Honey, this time
you've run into a shrewd one.

260
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:21,930
Once he gets you up there, you can't argue.

261
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,058
It's hit the silk or else.

262
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:29,532
Connie, he's here to buy a company and
he brought me along as a good luck charm.

263
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,292
I'll call you back. Bye.

264
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,795
- What happened?
- Well, Aunt Rachel said yes.

265
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:40,886
- Good.
- And I owe it all to you.

266
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:44,475
Miss Timberlake,
I'm glad I almost ran you down today.

267
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,369
I am too.

268
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:50,234
Let's go and toast that puddle
that brought us together.

269
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:53,450
- Do you care for Italian food?
- Oh, I love it.

270
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,082
Good, I know a little place,
if you like fettucine?

271
00:19:57,182 --> 00:20:00,266
- Er, yes.
- This is the only place to have it.

272
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:11,741
- Hello?
- 'Hi.'

273
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,824
Cathy? Where are you?

274
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:17,124
- In Philadelphia.
- 'What are you doing there?'

275
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:19,710
It's the only place to have fettucine.

276
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:25,183
I should've thought of that. I thought he took
you there to buy you the Liberty Bell.

277
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:30,108
Get off that merry-go-round. He's just
another Beasley with a flying bedroom.

278
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,996
Oh, Connie, he's not like anyone.
You've never met a man like this.

279
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:37,125
That's the problem, neither have you.

280
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:40,799
- I have so much to tell you when I get back.
- 'If you get back.'

281
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,850
We're leaving, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

282
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:50,571
- Well, did you get your roommate?
- Yes. She said to be sure and say hello.

283
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:55,621
You'll have to pay the piper for dinner by
sitting through a report I'm due to deliver.

284
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,373
I don't mind.

285
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:03,015
How do you feel about untapped natural
resources of underdeveloped countries?

286
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,598
I think they ought to be tapped.

287
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,995
Hmm. You've condensed
a 40-minute speech into one sentence.

288
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:18,417
The wealth of a nation
is in the wellbeing of its people,

289
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:21,509
both spiritually and materialistically.

290
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:24,721
It's not a question of lowering our standards

291
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:27,647
but of helping others to raise theirs.

292
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:30,608
If all people everywhere could be content

293
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,912
and their living standards even
and compatible with ours,

294
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:37,040
there would be no envy in the world

295
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,471
and, therefore, less provocation of war.

296
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:45,973
When you encourage and help people
to develop their own natural resources,

297
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,476
you do more than put bread in their mouths,

298
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:50,616
you put dignity in their hearts.

299
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,668
Even the Russians are applauding.

300
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:05,771
- Isn't he magnificent?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:09,608
- His car nearly ran me down this morning.
- Ooh!

302
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,159
- Yeah.
- What a delightful way to go.

303
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:18,038
Now we've discussed
the world's natural resources,

304
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,170
let's explore some of our own.

305
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,927
Miss Timberlake, New York's a wonderful
city, what would you like to do with it?

306
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:28,725
I don't know.
I've never been offered a city before.

307
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:32,070
That doesn't speak well
for the boys back home.

308
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:37,499
It's really not their fault. "Miss Timberlake,
I offer you Upper Sandusky."

309
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,293
- You see?
- It doesn't have the same ring.

310
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,929
What is a pretty girl offered
in Upper Sandusky?

311
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:47,766
Baseball.

312
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,936
I went to a lot of baseball games.

313
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,280
A friend of mine has a box
behind the third base dugout.

314
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,909
- Oh, that's nice.
- Cougars won the pennant in '58.

315
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,086
If you like baseball we've got a local team.

316
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:03,592
Oh, the Yankees. Oh.

317
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:06,560
The Cougars they are not but they try hard.

318
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:16,777
Strike!

319
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:23,468
Strike? Hey, ump! Shake your head,
your eyeballs are stuck!

320
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,565
It was a ball! It was that far from the plate.

321
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:33,526
Little lady, will you let me umpire this game?
You've been on my back all night.

322
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:37,242
- Mickey, you saw that pitch. It was a ball.
- It looked like it.

323
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:39,291
You're out of the game, Mantle.

324
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:41,709
What? Roger, how'd that pitch look?

325
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,727
- It could've missed the corner.
- You're out, Maris.

326
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,605
- Yogi.
- It's a perfect strike, the ump was right.

327
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:54,280
I don't like sarcasm, Berra.
You're out of the game too!

328
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,409
You can't do that!

329
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:57,903
Lady...

330
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:02,001
- Where's the manager?
- I think he's hiding.

331
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,098
Oh! Ooh...

332
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:08,184
I didn't mean to get
all those men thrown out.

333
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:11,062
It proved they could win
without their starting line-up.

334
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:14,610
I always get that way at ball games.
I lose control.

335
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,743
Well, it's over now, we won.

336
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:20,122
I know just the place
where you could calm down.

337
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:22,510
- Where?
- My apartment.

338
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:44,424
It's not ready for a housewarming
but how do you like it?

339
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:48,932
- It's beautiful up here.
- I might put in some walls over there.

340
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:53,735
And perhaps a ceiling,
just to give it that traditional touch.

341
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,871
That would be nice.

342
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:01,126
The, er, the living room will be there,

343
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:03,255
and the bedroom there.

344
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,717
I think the bedroom should be there.

345
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,847
Wherever you say.

346
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,977
And I love fireplaces.

347
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:14,401
There'll be one in every room.
And bookcases, I like books everywhere.

348
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:17,532
- And good reading lamps.
- That's the idea.

349
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:20,747
- Plenty of paintings.
- Mmm. And a built-in oven.

350
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:24,711
- And a sunken bathtub.
- Oh, I love taking sunken baths.

351
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:26,851
You'd always find me in it.

352
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,273
I didn't mean it that way, I...

353
00:25:32,373 --> 00:25:35,822
I know you didn't.
But let's not abandon the idea.

354
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,601
Cathy...

355
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:41,374
I've got to go to Bermuda for a few days.

356
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,837
How would you like to join me there?

357
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,967
Then we could go on to Paris.

358
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:49,391
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- No.

359
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:52,854
That's the best way to see it,
for the first time.

360
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:58,658
I know a restaurant in Paris where you can
get some marvellous French food.

361
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,789
Then we'll go to Monte Carlo,

362
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:05,341
where I can get a friend to take us
for a cruise around the Greek islands.

363
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:08,848
That's the only way to see them -
slowly, by boat.

364
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:12,643
They're like fine paintings -
you mustn't rush up to them.

365
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:17,616
We'll continue around the world, get back,
and this building will be finished.

366
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:22,751
If you don't like this apartment
you can have one of the others.

367
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:25,297
- May I ask one question?
- Go on.

368
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:27,717
Did you just ask me to marry you?

369
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:28,817
No.

370
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,238
- Oh.
- I didn't mean to mislead you.

371
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:38,373
Oh, you didn't.

372
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:42,793
You're very honest and I admire you for that.

373
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,843
- Then you're not offended.
- No.

374
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,020
Well, then what is it?

375
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,652
I'm a little frightened of you.

376
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:56,778
Oh, I know many people
who can't stand me.

377
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:58,909
I can stand you all right.

378
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:01,841
Now, Cathy, if this presents a problem...

379
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,093
You know, Mr Shayne, I feel I can trust you.

380
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,222
What would you advise me to do?

381
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:12,851
Oh, please, I'm hardly in a position
to give advice.

382
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:14,650
But I respect your opinion.

383
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,823
That's like asking a man
to testify against himself.

384
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:23,832
Cathy, you have rare qualities.
You're direct, sincere, uncomplicated,

385
00:27:23,932 --> 00:27:27,881
the type of woman who brings out
the worst in a man - his conscience.

386
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:31,014
Oh, I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

387
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,146
It's rather disturbing.

388
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:38,447
See, a man's conscience is generally
in direct opposition to his best interests.

389
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:42,456
And, in your best interests,
I'd better disqualify myself.

390
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,759
So this has to be your decision.

391
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:49,511
There's only one decision.

392
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:55,146
Get a lawyer, blackmail him, get a potful of
money and go to Bermuda without him.

393
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:59,406
You're condemning him
without even knowing him. You really are.

394
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:03,165
You should've heard
him speak to the United Nations.

395
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,212
Khrushchev spoke there too!
Would I let you go to Bermuda with him?

396
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,678
Connie, how can you compare them?

397
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:14,352
All I know is this, he did not try to lure me
to Bermuda or anywhere else.

398
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:17,946
He was completely honest,
a perfect gentleman.

399
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:22,370
A man meets you and in the same day
asks you to live with him?

400
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,167
I met a guy with a diamond stick pin
and a waxed moustache

401
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,717
and even he waited until the second date.

402
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:32,059
If he's a perfect gentleman,
waxed moustache is Albert Schweitzer.

403
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,399
OK, answer me this - why didn't he try to
influence me when I asked for his advice?

404
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:39,821
Because that's the way he operates.

405
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:44,043
Some guys ride the subways pinching girls,
he works out of a limousine.

406
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:45,543
But a pincher is a pincher.

407
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,385
Connie, I don't wanna hear
another word against him.

408
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:52,437
OK, if that's the way you feel about it.

409
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:55,589
I tried.

410
00:28:57,955 --> 00:28:59,997
What's this?

411
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:05,252
Some woman
in Mr Shayne's office gave it to me.

412
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,964
Boy, has this guy got an organisation.

413
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:10,933
He even has a medical plan for his victims!

414
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,781
Not another word.

415
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:45,951
Connie.

416
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:51,096
- Connie.
- Hmm? Huh?

417
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:53,776
What?

418
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:56,530
I think I'm in love.

419
00:29:57,244 --> 00:30:01,709
Try to get some sleep, honey,
you'll feel better in the morning.

420
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,476
Connie?

421
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:22,123
- Mmm?
- You sleeping?

422
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:30,468
It's four o'clock.

423
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:32,890
Why would I be sleeping?

424
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:37,526
I've made a decision.

425
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,654
I'm not gonna go with him.

426
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,789
It's for the best.

427
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,926
- Connie?
- Mmm?

428
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,561
When he calls, how do I tell him no
without hurting his feelings?

429
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:02,909
Call this number,
you'll get some good suggestions.

430
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:15,182
I wonder what shade of hair
I ought to wear this week.

431
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:18,276
I didn't do too well as a blonde.

432
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,943
Raven. That wasn't bad.

433
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:23,082
I got whistled at by a bird.

434
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:27,510
Grey. Maybe they'll feel sorry for me.

435
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:41,908
Look, if you don't know how to tell him,
when he calls I'll talk to him.

436
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:44,036
I'll talk to him.

437
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:50,170
But I just want to say it in a way that he won't
think it any personal reflection on him.

438
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,303
You're worried about him?

439
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:55,104
Oh, boy, men really have this game beat.

440
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,981
For 2,000 years we have had their children,

441
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:03,202
washed their clothes, cooked their meals
and cleaned their houses.

442
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:07,207
What do they give us in return?
The right to smoke in public.

443
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:09,338
We sold out for a cigarette.

444
00:32:09,438 --> 00:32:11,473
And you don't even smoke.

445
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:15,769
Good morning, good morning!

446
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:18,942
- It's a great day out.
- You're very happy, Roger.

447
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:21,525
Check that with Dr Gruber,
it might be serious.

448
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:25,786
I had a wonderful night's rest.
I've solved the trouble I have sleeping.

449
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:30,379
Just before you go to bed, put three
tranquillisers in a jigger of brandy.

450
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:33,972
You still can't sleep
but you're so relaxed you don't care.

451
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:38,107
Fancy that. People who sleep
don't know what they're missing.

452
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,987
Here's your chance to analyse
the Harrington report.

453
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:46,078
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne?'
- Did you call Miss Timberlake yet?

454
00:32:46,178 --> 00:32:48,209
- 'No, sir.'
- Cancel it.

455
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,133
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yeah, the young lady from the automat.

456
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,469
- What happened with her?
- Nothing.

457
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:57,851
I've been wrestling
with my conscience all morning.

458
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,983
- And I lost.
- That's an upset.

459
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,613
Her mother's a teacher,
father's a druggist,

460
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,576
brother's an eagle scout
and she sang in the church choir.

461
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:10,380
To take her to Bermuda is a desecration
of everything the Minutemen fought for.

462
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,676
- You asked her to go away with you?
- Yes.

463
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:14,895
- But you're not gonna take her.
- No.

464
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,560
What a terrible thing to do to me.

465
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,231
- To you?
- I've built this image of a man,

466
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:24,032
cold, ruthless, predatory,

467
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:28,623
now you go do a decent thing like this
to destroy that image.

468
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,422
You've set me back years in my analysis.

469
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:33,346
Oh, I'm ashamed of myself.

470
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,905
Well, Roger, if I've done anything human,
I'll make it up to you.

471
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,403
Would it help if I fired
every employee over 60?

472
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:44,503
No.

473
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:50,011
Hey, wait a minute, take the wrapper off.
It's better that way.

474
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:54,930
11:30. He said he'd call
first thing in the morning.

475
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,020
Well, now you don't have to worry
about not hurting his feelings.

476
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,445
At least he should give me the courtesy
of hurting his feelings.

477
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:07,038
A man picks you up off the street,
takes you to his office,

478
00:34:07,138 --> 00:34:10,795
makes you take your clothes off
and propositions you.

479
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:14,470
- What can you expect from a man like that?
- Respect.

480
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,349
Respect.
On that note of logic, I'll go to work.

481
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:22,234
He should've had the decency to call
and get my answer.

482
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:42,743
Well, I'm not paying for you just to sit there.
Do something! Ring!

483
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:50,084
Hello?

484
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:54,051
Yes, I'll talk to her. Hello, Cathy.

485
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,635
Weren't you supposed to call this morning?

486
00:34:56,735 --> 00:35:00,647
I'm sorry, I didn't think I should
under the circumstances.

487
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:03,066
What circumstances?

488
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,199
Cathy, I came to a decision.

489
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:08,578
I thought I was supposed
to make this decision.

490
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:11,210
Yes, but considering the situation.

491
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,340
What situation?

492
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,931
Well, I'm sure Upper Sandusky
is a delightful town

493
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,894
but it hardly prepares a girl
for this kind of situation.

494
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,572
I can see you don't know the girls
in Upper Sandusky.

495
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:27,951
- They're always prepared.
- I'm sure they are.

496
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:30,583
We're not unsophisticated rustics.

497
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:35,091
I'm not attacking you culturally. I'm sure
you have fine libraries and museums.

498
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:37,223
We also have a home for girls.

499
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:41,896
We may not be as large as New York
but we're just as progressive.

500
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:44,400
Last year we had a scandal
at the country club...

501
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,789
- I'm sure it's a zippy little community.
- Things are hoppin' up there!

502
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:53,712
I apologise. I should have called you
and given you the opportunity of saying no.

503
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:58,017
- You certainly should have.
- And I respect that decision.

504
00:35:58,117 --> 00:36:00,520
- What decision?
- Not to go.

505
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:06,075
I hate to disappoint you, Mr Shayne,
but the answer is yes!

506
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:09,248
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

507
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:12,043
- Unless you're thinking of backing...
- No.

508
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:15,635
I just suddenly see Upper Sandusky
in a new light.

509
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:19,226
- Will I be hearing from you?
- As soon as I make the arrangements.

510
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,564
- Thank you.
- Thank you for calling.

511
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:25,365
Well, you heard. I tried to talk her out of it.

512
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:31,210
No, I brought her to throw money in your
face. I delivered the sparrow to the hawk.

513
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,427
The sparrow's flying south. She'll need
clothes so make the arrangements.

514
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,805
No. I will not dress the victim for sacrifice.

515
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:43,026
Bergdorf Goodman have a new line
of sacrificial evening gowns.

516
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:46,987
I have waited years to tell you
what you can do with your job,

517
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:49,832
your salary, bonuses and fringe benefits.

518
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,376
- Yes, Roger?
- I've waited this long.

519
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:57,268
- And I can wait a little longer.
- Good. Wait over there, do it quietly.

520
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:01,985
So he insulted Upper Sandusky,
this is no way to get even.

521
00:37:03,118 --> 00:37:05,659
You're carrying civic pride too far.

522
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:10,454
OK, if your mind's made up, fine.

523
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:12,591
Send postcards.

524
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,301
Well, he did it.

525
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,437
Rasputin talked her into it.

526
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,533
Connie, look.

527
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,367
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yes.

528
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,665
They're waiting for you
at Bergdorf Goodman.

529
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:56,181
- Who are you?
- Leonard. I'm assigned as coordinator.

530
00:37:57,646 --> 00:38:00,310
Oh? What do you coordinate?

531
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,410
You.

532
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,780
Thank you very much.

533
00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:11,077
Oh, Connie, please stop crying.

534
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:13,379
I'm only going around the world.

535
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,577
I know.

536
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:21,061
Oh, Cathy, you look so beautiful.

537
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:24,437
Just like a bride.

538
00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:26,567
Oh, I'm sorry!

539
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,534
Oh, Connie, I'm all right, really I am.

540
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,964
What can happen to me?

541
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,387
Oh, Connie, please, stop.

542
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,543
Connie.

543
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,672
Please?

544
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:47,272
I'm all right now.

545
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:50,572
Oh, Cathy, have a good trip.

546
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:54,456
Oh, I will. I'll write to you
as soon as I get to Bermuda.

547
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:58,851
Oh, Cathy, you look lovely in that coat.

548
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:02,264
You mother would be so proud of you...

549
00:41:02,364 --> 00:41:04,603
Oh, I'm so sorry!

550
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:10,804
- Bye.
- Bye.

551
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,632
Enjoy yourself.

552
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:18,489
I think.

553
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:36,168
When she said she'd throw that money
in his face she became a symbol of hope.

554
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:38,297
Look at her.

555
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:42,144
It's like watching Joan of Arc
on her way to the fire.

556
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:50,028
'Good morning, welcome aboard flight 603.

557
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:55,542
'This is your pilot, Captain Miller.
Your copilot is Captain Saunders.

558
00:41:55,642 --> 00:42:00,298
'We will be cruising at 31,000 feet
at an average speed of 500 miles an hour.

559
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,935
'We hope you will have a pleasant trip.'

560
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:09,777
- Are you comfortable, Miss Timberlake?
- Yes, thank you.

561
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:13,997
Is this the off season for Bermuda.
No, we're booked solid.

562
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:16,131
Mr Shayne bought every seat.

563
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:21,559
Oh! It's all right.

564
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:02,342
Cathy, you're too much.
Here, let me take this.

565
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:05,013
Mr Shayne, everything was so expensive.

566
00:43:05,113 --> 00:43:08,313
I told Leonard not to spend so much
but he insisted.

567
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:11,156
- Who's Leonard?
- He works for you.

568
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,573
- Oh, he does?
- He coordinated me.

569
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:16,122
You know, he sort of put me together.

570
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:20,931
Well, no reflection on Leonard
but he merely put a frame on a Renoir.

571
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:59,383
Here's your key, Mr Shayne.

572
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,134
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

573
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:06,857
Come along.

574
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,004
Stand there.

575
00:45:21,104 --> 00:45:23,140
Don't move, don't go away.

576
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:32,947
Nowhere else in the world can you see
beaches with pink sand.

577
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:35,825
Pirate ships used to anchor in that cove.

578
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:41,217
Only pirates from the best families,
naturally. The others couldn't afford it.

579
00:45:51,536 --> 00:45:55,071
There's the kitchen
in case you get hungry in the night.

580
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:58,082
Oh, no. Once I get in bed I'm through.

581
00:45:58,182 --> 00:46:00,210
I sleep like a rock.

582
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:04,005
I wish I had that faculty.
Takes me hours to get to sleep.

583
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:06,472
Have you tried hot milk and butter?

584
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:08,858
No, I'm not that anxious to sleep.

585
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:20,461
I want you to look at something.

586
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:23,308
Have you ever seen anything like that?

587
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:25,562
No.

588
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:29,937
It means so much more
when you can share it with someone.

589
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:34,193
How long will it take you to get ready?

590
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,326
- For what?
- A swim.

591
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,872
Shall we go to the pool? Can you swim?

592
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:41,630
Oh, swim! That I can do.

593
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,674
If you'd like to change,
I'll wait on the balcony.

594
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:49,271
No. A gentleman always allows
the lady to undress first.

595
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:14,118
'She knows.'

596
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:39,837
'They know.'

597
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,509
'Everybody knows!'

598
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:23,756
I want to thank you for a wonderful day.

599
00:48:23,856 --> 00:48:27,012
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Will I see you tomorrow?

600
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,930
I imagine so.

601
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,068
Good. Good night.

602
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,703
I think I'm registered here.

603
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:41,803
Oh.

604
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,016
Is there anything you'd like?

605
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:09,730
How about a late movie?

606
00:49:10,528 --> 00:49:12,986
All the theatres are closed.

607
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:17,615
- We can watch one on television.
- There is no television.

608
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,428
What do people do here at night?

609
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:28,640
I mean, um, for entertainment.

610
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:31,318
I mean, um...

611
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:35,530
to... pass the time.

612
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,992
They make up games, Cathy.

613
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:41,414
Simple, fun games.

614
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,890
Come over here.

615
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:51,992
Sit down.

616
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:57,153
Cathy, this is a very special place to me.

617
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:59,868
I've never brought a girl here before.

618
00:49:59,968 --> 00:50:02,337
You're not sorry you came, are you?

619
00:50:07,144 --> 00:50:09,179
What are you doing?

620
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,315
I'm kissing you. Do you mind?

621
00:50:12,029 --> 00:50:14,071
Not if you don't.

622
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,614
Well, relax. I'll keep you informed
of my every move.

623
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:23,041
You have a beautiful back.

624
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:25,754
My mother always made me sit up straight.

625
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:27,884
I'm grateful to your mother.

626
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,187
And such attractive shoulders.

627
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:33,728
Swimming was compulsory at high school.

628
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:36,692
I'm grateful to the public school system.

629
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:39,824
There's so much to be grateful for.

630
00:50:39,924 --> 00:50:42,211
And so little time to be grateful.

631
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,350
Oh, I just remembered - I forgot
my toothbrush. I'd better go back for it.

632
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,146
I always carry a spare.

633
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:17,109
But it takes me months
to break in a new one.

634
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:21,579
The Hindus use twigs,
they break them off the trees. We'll try that.

635
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,874
- I'm going for a short walk.
- I'll go with you!

636
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:27,173
Stay here. Make yourself comfortable.

637
00:51:27,273 --> 00:51:30,847
Philip! There's something
you should know about me.

638
00:51:30,947 --> 00:51:33,226
I have an uncle who's a socialist.

639
00:51:33,326 --> 00:51:38,284
I respect you for telling me
but what we have transcends all politics.

640
00:52:01,796 --> 00:52:04,596
- Hi.
- Hello.

641
00:52:04,886 --> 00:52:07,843
Er, my name's Harry Clark.

642
00:52:08,977 --> 00:52:11,222
Philip Shayne.

643
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,438
I just got married this afternoon.

644
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:18,613
Congratulations.
How do you like married life?

645
00:52:18,713 --> 00:52:20,451
I don't know yet.

646
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:26,968
I, er, came out for a smoke.

647
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,937
I thought I'd give Marie-Anne
some time to, er...

648
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:38,028
Well, what is a decent interval
for a fella to stay away?

649
00:52:38,128 --> 00:52:40,281
How long have you been out here?

650
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:44,626
- Two hours.
- That's as decent as you can get.

651
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:47,845
Marie-Anne's kinda shy.

652
00:52:48,976 --> 00:52:53,892
I mean, psychologically,
I want her to feel secure.

653
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,980
Harry?

654
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,445
She sounds secure.

655
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:03,879
Well, awfully nice to have met you.
G- Good night.

656
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:24,372
Oh, good evening.

657
00:53:24,472 --> 00:53:26,507
Good evening.

658
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:34,184
- Do we know each other?
- I'm Dr Richardson, the hotel physician.

659
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:36,602
- Oh.
- I wouldn't go in just yet.

660
00:53:36,702 --> 00:53:40,740
- What happened?
- The lady called to ask if we'd any sedatives

661
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,451
and she sounded agitated so I came up.

662
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,418
- Is she all right?
- Nothing serious, just a case of nerves.

663
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,676
May I ask a personal question, Mr Shayne?

664
00:53:51,776 --> 00:53:55,057
- Sure, go ahead.
- Is that Mrs Shayne in there?

665
00:53:55,157 --> 00:53:56,157
Er...

666
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:57,949
no.

667
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:03,500
That's strange, this reaction
is more common amongst married women.

668
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:12,262
- Is he back yet?
- Yes.

669
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:16,102
Don't let him come in!
I don't want him to see me like this.

670
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:17,797
I won't.

671
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:20,700
All of a sudden I started breaking out.

672
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:25,286
I always get rashes when I'm nervous.

673
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:27,790
The ointment will take care of that.

674
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,929
Here, take this.

675
00:54:34,735 --> 00:54:37,854
And get some sleep.
I'll stop by in the morning.

676
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:41,485
Thank you. Oh, Doctor!
Don't tell him about the rash.

677
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:45,964
- Tell him I had a stroke or something.
- I'll be discreet.

678
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:47,885
Oh!

679
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:55,347
- How is she?
- Fine. Needs a good night's rest.

680
00:54:55,447 --> 00:54:57,313
Uninterrupted.

681
00:54:57,413 --> 00:54:58,859
Naturally.

682
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:02,320
Had a case in 207 last week,
honeymoon couple.

683
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,702
Lovely girl, barricaded herself
in the bathroom.

684
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,001
Claimed her husband
was making advances toward her.

685
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:13,344
- The man should be horsewhipped.
- They're just not prepared.

686
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:16,475
We give them one semester
of home economics

687
00:55:16,575 --> 00:55:19,029
and expect Madame DuBarry.

688
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:33,894
Mr Shayne?

689
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:37,730
Yes, Cathy?

690
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,153
- Mr Shayne, I'm sorry.
- You couldn't help it.

691
00:55:41,253 --> 00:55:45,493
But I don't want to ruin your evening.
You go out without me.

692
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,496
It wouldn't be the same.

693
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:50,712
Don't worry. We'll go back
to New York in the morning.

694
00:55:50,812 --> 00:55:53,298
I know you've gone to great expense.

695
00:55:53,398 --> 00:55:56,681
Plane, hotels, meals, tips...

696
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:59,775
If you add it all up,
I'll be glad to pay half of it.

697
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,237
We'll figure it out in the morning.

698
00:56:02,337 --> 00:56:05,867
Now, you get a good night's sleep,
I'll be on the couch.

699
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,749
If you wake up and need anything,
just call me.

700
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:11,841
I won't wake up.
Once I get in bed, I'm through.

701
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:13,637
Yes, I know.

702
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,598
- Will you be all right on the couch?
- Fine!

703
00:56:16,698 --> 00:56:21,819
If you have trouble falling asleep,
don't forget the hot milk and butter.

704
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:23,955
This may be the night for it.

705
00:56:25,337 --> 00:56:27,913
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,891
- Oh, Mr Shayne!
- Yes, Cathy?

707
00:56:33,353 --> 00:56:37,016
I just want you to know that, sick as I am,

708
00:56:37,116 --> 00:56:40,441
this has been
the most wonderful day of my life.

709
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,364
I'll never forget it.

710
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:45,541
Neither will I.

711
00:57:17,945 --> 00:57:20,019
Having trouble, too, huh?

712
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:21,396
Well...

713
00:57:21,496 --> 00:57:25,535
Before you give them the mink coat
they all talk a big game.

714
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:29,380
Now the lady gets headaches,
she prefers to be alone.

715
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:33,509
- What did you do?
- I belted her.

716
00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:35,637
How about you?

717
00:57:35,737 --> 00:57:37,767
Right across the chops.

718
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:41,729
- We got a lot in common.
- We could pass for brothers.

719
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,988
Deal the cards.

720
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,581
- Watch it, I cheat.
- So do I.

721
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:56,178
And in view of its growth potential, I strongly
recommend purchase of said stock.

722
00:57:56,278 --> 00:58:00,187
Send a copy to Mr Shayne,
Victoria Hotel, Bermuda.

723
00:58:00,287 --> 00:58:03,036
- Yes, sir.
- Just a moment, Miss Jones.

724
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:08,329
I've been very curious about
something for years.

725
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:11,209
- Would you let your hair down?
- What?

726
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:13,346
Let your hair down.

727
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:23,945
Now take your glasses off.

728
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,466
Strange, always seems to work
in the movies.

729
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:36,677
- Miss Jones, do you see what I see?
- Where?

730
00:58:36,777 --> 00:58:40,526
It's a miracle. Joan of Arc put out the fire.

731
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,462
- Things went pretty badly?
- Pretty badly.

732
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:56,843
- It was a disaster?
- That's what I like about you,

733
00:58:56,943 --> 00:59:00,981
no matter what calamity befalls others,
you can still laugh about it.

734
00:59:01,081 --> 00:59:06,070
It's a victory for the little people. How often
does the sparrow down the hawk?

735
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,247
The baron of the boudoir
shot down over Bermuda.

736
00:59:09,347 --> 00:59:13,503
- It had to happen sooner or later.
- I knew she was no ordinary woman.

737
00:59:13,603 --> 00:59:17,051
- She proved that all right.
- Something about her,

738
00:59:17,151 --> 00:59:19,139
purity, innocence, honour.

739
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:23,732
- All virtues that drive a man to drink.
- What a lift this is for me.

740
00:59:23,832 --> 00:59:27,331
There'll be dancing in
Dr Gruber's office today.

741
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:33,501
Excuse me, sir. Miss Timberlake
asked me to return these things to you.

742
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:35,589
Thank you, Collins.

743
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:38,177
Why do that?
Why didn't she just keep them?

744
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:40,061
It upsets you, doesn't it?

745
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:45,278
The puppet master ran across a puppet who
won't perform and then cuts all his strings.

746
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:50,035
She's become a symbol of hope to
all of us who sold out for that touch of mink.

747
00:59:50,135 --> 00:59:51,332
Roger!

748
00:59:51,594 --> 00:59:55,007
You give us good salaries,
paid vacations, insurance,

749
00:59:55,107 --> 00:59:58,802
you take away our problems
and act like you've done us a favour.

750
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:02,147
Well, you haven't
and some day there'll be an uprising

751
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:05,821
and the masses will regain
the misery they're entitled to.

752
01:00:05,921 --> 01:00:10,456
Neurotics of the world unite. You have
nothing to lose but your psychiatrist.

753
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:14,796
Roger, I flew 800 miles
to a tropical paradise

754
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:16,927
to drink hot milk and butter.

755
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:22,062
I spent half the night playing gin rummy
with a bookie. Not a memorable evening.

756
01:00:22,162 --> 01:00:25,070
If you don't leave now, I'll raise your salary.

757
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,365
You're sadistic enough to do that.

758
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:30,744
If Miss Timberlake is your hope,
you get together with her.

759
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:34,260
You, she and Dr Gruber
will make a lovely couple.

760
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:52,965
You go back home for a few days
and see your family, you'll feel better.

761
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:57,219
I don't want to feel better. I don't deserve it.

762
01:00:58,356 --> 01:01:03,147
I was afraid of him.
I thought I wasn't good enough for him.

763
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:05,398
Afraid I'd disappoint him.

764
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:09,158
So? You weren't asking for
a letter of recommendation.

765
01:01:09,258 --> 01:01:13,083
The minute he bolted that door I got panicky.

766
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:17,130
Of course. You're alone in a hotel room
with a strange man,

767
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,469
what would the average girl do?

768
01:01:19,569 --> 01:01:24,940
Forget about the average girl, somebody as
sensitive as you are is bound to get nervous.

769
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,737
Nervous? I broke out in a rash.

770
01:01:28,837 --> 01:01:30,704
I know, I know.

771
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:33,544
I had exactly the same experience once.

772
01:01:33,644 --> 01:01:38,677
This fellow and I stopped off
at a roadside inn - never forget it.

773
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:41,935
Started shaking like a leaf,
broke out in boils.

774
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:45,865
He was so sick I had to drive him home.
It happens to everybody.

775
01:01:46,997 --> 01:01:49,200
He was so understanding about it.

776
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,335
He didn't even get upset.

777
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:54,502
He just smiled.

778
01:01:54,602 --> 01:01:57,048
It was so awful!

779
01:01:57,148 --> 01:01:59,928
If only he'd got mad or yelled or hit me.

780
01:02:00,028 --> 01:02:04,148
- Men are so inconsiderate.
- And all that money he spent on me,

781
01:02:04,248 --> 01:02:07,154
he can't even deduct it, it's humiliating.

782
01:02:07,254 --> 01:02:08,572
What is?

783
01:02:08,672 --> 01:02:12,669
I'm not even important enough
to be a tax loss.

784
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,524
- Good morning, Roger.
- Morning, Doctor.

785
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:27,108
It's good to be home.

786
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:30,618
How are things in the investment world?
Any good tips?

787
01:02:30,718 --> 01:02:35,336
A new stock issue, Consolidated Wire.
It's a great buy if you get in fast.

788
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:41,099
I still haven't heard from my mother, not that
it bothers me but it has been two days.

789
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,400
I know what's wrong, she's in a snit.
I forgot Grandpa's birthday.

790
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,111
She has a real problem with her father.

791
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:50,409
Let her analyst worry about that.

792
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:55,882
Doc, an exciting thing happened,
I think I'm about to make a breakthrough.

793
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,971
I made a great discovery,
Philip Shayne is just a man!

794
01:03:01,071 --> 01:03:03,101
It took a woman to prove it.

795
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:08,236
There's this girl, let's call her...
Cathy Timberlake...

796
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:12,713
Walter? Dr Gruber.
What's Consolidated Wire?

797
01:03:13,926 --> 01:03:15,961
12 and a half.

798
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:18,180
Buy me... 500 shares.

799
01:03:19,312 --> 01:03:21,597
Yes, I got it from the usual source.

800
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,644
The way she stood up to him was inspiring.

801
01:03:24,744 --> 01:03:28,947
I kept thinking what would I have done
if I were in her shoes.

802
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:31,082
Unemployed, no money.

803
01:03:33,424 --> 01:03:37,715
This very wealthy man
sees me walking down the street,

804
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,299
he's terribly attracted to me.

805
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:45,104
Had me brought up to his office,
I have to admit he's quite charming.

806
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:48,778
After the usual preliminaries -
dinner and dancing -

807
01:03:48,878 --> 01:03:52,286
- he invites me to Bermuda.
- Just like that?

808
01:03:52,386 --> 01:03:56,543
This is a forceful man,
accustomed to getting his own way.

809
01:03:56,643 --> 01:03:58,038
Uh-huh.

810
01:03:58,308 --> 01:04:01,677
Get given a complete wardrobe,
including a mink coat,

811
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:06,604
flown to Bermuda, taken to the best suite,
this man offers everything.

812
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,986
Excitement, comfort, security.

813
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:12,866
Believe me, Doc, it's not easy
to turn down an offer like that.

814
01:04:12,966 --> 01:04:14,999
No, it's not.

815
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:17,961
Roger, something
quite urgent has come up.

816
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:21,220
- Would you mind cutting the session short?
- No.

817
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,144
I want to see you in the morning.
We should examine this new development.

818
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:28,191
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Yes, that's...

819
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,614
quite a breakthrough you've made.

820
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:35,459
Walter, Dr Gruber.
Cancel that order for Consolidated Wire.

821
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:40,931
My informant has developed instabilities
which make his judgement questionable.

822
01:04:42,858 --> 01:04:45,310
Tell me when you're coming back
and I'll meet you.

823
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:50,867
- I will. Better hurry, you'll be late for work.
- I know. Have a good trip. Bye.

824
01:04:58,682 --> 01:04:59,682
Bye.

825
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:05,227
Cathy! How did you miss the bus?
You were on it.

826
01:05:05,327 --> 01:05:07,190
I've changed my mind.

827
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:10,613
- We can still catch it.
- I've got to go back there.

828
01:05:10,713 --> 01:05:15,370
You are the husband, four children
and a cottage type, this isn't you.

829
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:18,463
You got lucky once,
it may not be a rash this time.

830
01:05:18,563 --> 01:05:23,636
I can't let him think of me as I was last night.
I want him to remember me as a woman.

831
01:05:23,736 --> 01:05:27,435
It's important to me,
I've got to prove to him I'm a woman.

832
01:05:27,535 --> 01:05:30,197
There are easier ways to prove it.

833
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:32,331
Send him your birth certificate.

834
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:41,048
Mr Shayne, a long-distance phone call.
It came through from your office.

835
01:05:41,148 --> 01:05:43,469
- Who is it? Do you know?
- No, sir.

836
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,644
All right. Thank you, Mario.

837
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:50,236
- Hello?
- Philip, this is Cathy.

838
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:53,451
'Guess where I am.'

839
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:55,036
Disneyland?

840
01:05:55,136 --> 01:05:58,667
Bermuda. At the hotel.

841
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:00,550
What are you doing there?

842
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,971
Waiting for you.

843
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:08,938
I already have plans for the evening.
I have a few things to catch up on.

844
01:06:09,038 --> 01:06:12,154
You could be here in two hours.

845
01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:15,753
And I have a board meeting early tomorrow.

846
01:06:19,974 --> 01:06:23,513
Is that what you'd rather see
first thing in the morning?

847
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:29,316
That is something to think about.

848
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:32,740
And it's all just two hours away.

849
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,869
Er, just a minute.

850
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:39,254
Isabella, I have
a hypothetical question to ask you.

851
01:06:39,354 --> 01:06:43,638
Darling, what would you do
if the situation were reversed?

852
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,131
Grazie.

853
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,486
I'm on my way.

854
01:07:03,021 --> 01:07:06,306
Sorry to keep you this late
but just one more letter.

855
01:07:06,406 --> 01:07:10,149
To the Dean of Economics Department,
Princeton University.

856
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:12,991
Dear Arnold, after an absence of six years

857
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:17,458
I'm happy to announce I will soon be
returning to the academic world.

858
01:07:17,558 --> 01:07:21,925
It is my intention to fill the void
created by my leaving...

859
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:24,092
- Oh, Collins.
- Yes, sir?

860
01:07:24,192 --> 01:07:27,474
- Taking everything back?
- Oh, no, the airport.

861
01:07:27,574 --> 01:07:32,234
Mr Shayne is flying to Bermuda.
He's meeting Miss Timberlake.

862
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:33,334
Oh.

863
01:07:34,252 --> 01:07:36,252
Thank you.

864
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:49,691
Thank you, Miss Jones.
We'll finish in the morning.

865
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,028
- Good night.
- Good night.

866
01:07:56,297 --> 01:08:01,043
Dr Gruber? Roger. I hate to bother you
but something's come up.

867
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:04,343
- Remember what I told you this morning?
- 'Yes.'

868
01:08:04,443 --> 01:08:07,602
- It's happening again.
- 'A trip to Bermuda?'

869
01:08:07,702 --> 01:08:09,524
Yes, tonight.

870
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:24,052
You don't scare me.

871
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:59,216
- Good evening, Mr Shayne.
- Good evening.

872
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:15,991
Cathy.

873
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:25,636
Cathy?

874
01:09:26,482 --> 01:09:27,682
Cathy.

875
01:09:33,246 --> 01:09:34,446
Cathy!

876
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:37,837
Hi!

877
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:49,189
See... no rash.

878
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:54,160
Well, that's something.

879
01:10:01,178 --> 01:10:03,630
Cathy. Cathy...

880
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:06,928
Cathy! Did you drink this whole bottle?

881
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:09,098
Beats hot milk and butter.

882
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:11,195
Oh, for...

883
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:13,527
Come on, girl. Come on.

884
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,656
Come on, let's sit up.

885
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:18,588
There's a good girl. Sit up. That's right.

886
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,213
- Are you glad you came here?
- Delighted. Come on.

887
01:10:23,313 --> 01:10:26,220
I bet you never expected
to hear from me again.

888
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,432
Oh, I had a premonition.

889
01:10:28,532 --> 01:10:30,568
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah!

890
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:31,739
Good.

891
01:10:33,745 --> 01:10:37,786
- I'm a real woman, huh?
- Yeah, irresistible.

892
01:10:37,886 --> 01:10:39,914
Now, try to walk.

893
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:42,127
That's the idea.

894
01:10:42,227 --> 01:10:44,512
There you are, that's right.

895
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:48,177
Do you like the way I walk?

896
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,433
You're poetry in motion.

897
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:52,898
- I learned when I was a baby.
- Uh-huh.

898
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,321
- I been walking for years.
- Oh.

899
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,425
Oh, dear.

900
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,797
- Have you been drinking?
- Not yet.

901
01:11:03,897 --> 01:11:06,301
Right, come on.

902
01:11:08,066 --> 01:11:10,939
There. Now, just stand there, don't move.

903
01:11:12,074 --> 01:11:14,116
Are you nervous?

904
01:11:15,164 --> 01:11:17,032
Petrified.

905
01:11:17,132 --> 01:11:21,294
Now, take a breath of fresh air.
Come on, take a deep breath.

906
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:26,467
Is that good? Fine... Oop!

907
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:29,138
Now, just stand there. That's right.

908
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:33,439
I'll call down and get some coffee.

909
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,613
Room service, please. Hurry.

910
01:11:36,749 --> 01:11:41,163
Hello, this is Philip Shayne.
Send up some hot coffee right away.

911
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,294
As much as you can carry.

912
01:11:43,394 --> 01:11:46,558
I need a chaser for a fifth of Scotch. Yes, I...

913
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,450
Don't move! Lie there.

914
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,342
Oh, dear.

915
01:12:04,724 --> 01:12:08,637
I fell out of Mr Shayne's suite.
See that I'm returned.

916
01:12:08,737 --> 01:12:13,395
Luckily, the canopy broke her fall.
Nothing but a sprained wrist.

917
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:17,360
- Where's Mr Shayne?
- Wandered off. Seems to be in shock.

918
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,288
Can't say I blame him,
the girl's hysterical one evening

919
01:12:21,388 --> 01:12:23,835
and plunges off his balcony the next.

920
01:12:23,935 --> 01:12:27,884
Their relationship does
leave something to be desired.

921
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,645
- Hi.
- Hi.

922
01:12:36,247 --> 01:12:39,782
- I thought you left this morning.
- I did. Flew back.

923
01:12:39,882 --> 01:12:42,081
How's the little lady?

924
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:44,583
Got another headache. How's yours?

925
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,671
Got loaded. Fell off the balcony.

926
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:50,515
I'm glad I book horses.
Who can handicap women?

927
01:12:50,615 --> 01:12:53,440
- Can't win.
- Why do we keep betting on them?

928
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:57,990
It's like Adam said about Eve -
"It's better than apples."

929
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,241
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

930
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:02,379
Deal the cards.

931
01:13:08,354 --> 01:13:10,812
Thank you. Miss Jones, look!

932
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:16,778
The hawk has crashed again.

933
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:22,996
Call Dr Gruber. Cancel my appointment.
Tell him things worked out well in Bermuda.

934
01:13:23,096 --> 01:13:28,223
You can't just sit there for
the rest of your life staring out the window.

935
01:13:29,523 --> 01:13:33,981
Catherine, darling, look.
I've baked you a kugel. Eat.

936
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:36,064
You need strength to suffer.

937
01:13:36,164 --> 01:13:38,908
Believe me, no man is worth it.

938
01:13:39,008 --> 01:13:43,247
You'll see, you'll get a job, work for 20 years

939
01:13:43,347 --> 01:13:46,347
and then you'll get a pension,
who needs him?

940
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:50,306
Well, say something.

941
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:52,857
I just wanna die.

942
01:13:54,157 --> 01:13:59,322
- Did you hear that? She wants to die.
- Maybe it'll make her feel better.

943
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,672
No, no. Don't call one.

944
01:14:05,012 --> 01:14:10,303
We better wait. I had a traumatic experience
driving in the rain the other day.

945
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:14,183
- Anything serious?
- No, just left me a little puddle-shy.

946
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,317
Let me ask you a question.

947
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,741
If you saw a stray kitten,
helpless but very appealing,

948
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:23,997
and every time you tried to pet it
you got scratched, would you avoid it?

949
01:14:24,097 --> 01:14:27,212
- Naturally.
- Yet you can't leave it to starve,

950
01:14:27,312 --> 01:14:30,593
you've got a moral obligation
to help it survive.

951
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:34,558
- What does this kitten do?
- Works a computing machine.

952
01:14:34,658 --> 01:14:38,441
We own American Credit Card,
they use those machines.

953
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,408
Arrange for a job but keep my name out of it.

954
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:45,458
- How do we contact this kitten?
- With extreme caution.

955
01:14:46,932 --> 01:14:51,723
Don't worry, you go to work.
I'll check and see that she's all right.

956
01:14:51,823 --> 01:14:54,393
Boy, if I ever run across him again.

957
01:15:09,728 --> 01:15:13,148
- Excuse me, could you tell me...
- With pleasure.

958
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,753
- What's wrong?
- It's him.

959
01:15:26,853 --> 01:15:28,247
You...!

960
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:39,277
What happened?

961
01:15:39,377 --> 01:15:41,908
Don't ask, get Herman.

962
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:44,622
Herman. Herman!

963
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:46,836
Herman, come here.

964
01:15:46,936 --> 01:15:48,342
Get him!

965
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:04,707
What happened?

966
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:08,932
I was knocked down two flights of stairs
and attacked by a dog.

967
01:16:10,269 --> 01:16:13,349
This has been the
most satisfying day of my life.

968
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:15,184
What started it?

969
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:19,232
When the cab crashed and
the women started hitting me, I found out.

970
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:23,243
They had nothing against me,
they thought they were hitting you.

971
01:16:23,343 --> 01:16:27,751
Before I go to the hospital I wanted you
to see what people think of you.

972
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:30,257
And you deserved everything I got.

973
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,195
I wonder what I've done.

974
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:40,860
The whole world's on credit

975
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,748
and I'm going with a man who won't
get married till he can pay for it in cash.

976
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:50,589
I told him people charge everything -
hotels, department stores.

977
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,093
Some places won't even take money.

978
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:57,442
One of these days they'll even
charge funerals - die now, pay later.

979
01:17:03,211 --> 01:17:07,502
Stanley's cousin's in town.
We could make it a foursome tonight.

980
01:17:07,602 --> 01:17:12,092
Thanks, but I have to start billing
the New England area tomorrow.

981
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,807
I need to memorise these code numbers.

982
01:17:14,907 --> 01:17:19,110
Well, that'll be more interesting
than Stanley's cousin.

983
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,494
- See you in the morning.
- Night.

984
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:27,418
How do you like working here,
Miss Timberlake?

985
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:30,047
Fine, thank you. I just hope I do well.

986
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:35,099
And if you don't, who's going to fire you?
My friend works in personnel.

987
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:40,190
When the call came from Mr Shayne's
office to hire you it was like panicsville.

988
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:43,784
Have you ever seen
a herd of vice presidents stampede?

989
01:17:43,884 --> 01:17:46,452
Mr Shayne recommended me for this job?

990
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:51,175
Recommended? Honey, you are in
for a labour-management relationship

991
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:53,471
Walter Reuther never dreamed of.

992
01:17:53,571 --> 01:17:57,433
If you sneeze, they tear out
the air conditioning system.

993
01:17:57,533 --> 01:18:00,195
Well, that's life.

994
01:18:00,295 --> 01:18:02,531
I'm glad one of us girls made it.

995
01:18:11,142 --> 01:18:14,472
You don't have to
feel sorry for me, Mr Shayne.

996
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:17,404
I'll get my own job. I don't need your help.

997
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:22,446
If I never work again,
at least I've done it on my own.

998
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:25,871
I'm not like these machines
where you push a button

999
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:28,122
and it does what you want it to do.

1000
01:18:28,222 --> 01:18:31,338
Push all you want,
you're not gonna push my buttons.

1001
01:18:31,438 --> 01:18:33,762
I'm not a robot, I'm people.

1002
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,479
And I quit!

1003
01:19:01,955 --> 01:19:04,496
- Telephone, Mr Shayne.
- Thank you, Mario.

1004
01:19:06,256 --> 01:19:07,456
Hello?

1005
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:11,971
She did what to the machines?

1006
01:19:12,978 --> 01:19:14,937
I'll be right there.

1007
01:19:15,942 --> 01:19:19,561
This is how I found it
when the night watchman called me.

1008
01:19:19,661 --> 01:19:24,155
It's awful. Buffalo gone.
Hartford, Connecticut almost wiped out.

1009
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:26,293
31,000 accounts.

1010
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:31,292
This man had breakfast
at a Howard Johnson drive-in,

1011
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,676
he's being billed for $128,000.

1012
01:19:33,776 --> 01:19:37,055
Hm, it's that second cup of coffee
that gets you.

1013
01:19:37,155 --> 01:19:39,688
It'll take weeks to straighten out.

1014
01:19:39,788 --> 01:19:41,985
Do the best you can.

1015
01:19:42,085 --> 01:19:45,909
It's sabotage! She's an undercover agent
for the Diners Club.

1016
01:19:46,009 --> 01:19:49,250
No. No, I'm the one who placed
this atom bomb here.

1017
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:52,265
I should have dropped her over the desert.

1018
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:56,348
I've no one to blame but myself.

1019
01:19:56,448 --> 01:20:02,527
I felt sorry for this helpless kitten. Helpless?
She ought to be declared a disaster area.

1020
01:20:02,627 --> 01:20:07,701
- She's not the run-of-the-mill girl, is she?
- No. Even Darwin never figured on her.

1021
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:10,962
The Four Horsemen
now have a riding companion.

1022
01:20:11,062 --> 01:20:15,718
There's War, Famine, Death,
Pestilence and Miss Timberlake.

1023
01:20:15,818 --> 01:20:19,600
Sir, this special delivery letter
just came for you.

1024
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,523
Thank you.

1025
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:24,243
- It's from her.
- Open it.

1026
01:20:25,376 --> 01:20:29,129
- I should put it in a tub of water.
- Go on, open it.

1027
01:20:30,261 --> 01:20:32,802
Calm down, I'm opening it.

1028
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:36,979
"Dear sir,

1029
01:20:37,192 --> 01:20:42,816
"Enclosed is an itemised statement of
all expenses incurred by you on my behalf.

1030
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:47,659
"This includes plane fare, hotel,
meals, tips and doctor's bills,

1031
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:50,919
"which comes to a total of $729.40.

1032
01:20:51,019 --> 01:20:55,720
"It is only an estimate.
If your figure differs, please let me know.

1033
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,182
"Enclosed is money order
covering first payment."

1034
01:20:59,282 --> 01:21:02,148
- Three dollars?
- That's integrity.

1035
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:06,240
"You will receive a money order
for a similar amount each week

1036
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:09,287
"until the entire obligation is discharged.

1037
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:14,130
"With best wishes for
your continued success, Cathy Timberlake."

1038
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:16,973
What a future, three dollars a week for life.

1039
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:21,107
- I think it's touching. She has character.
- She's a menace.

1040
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:24,901
Roger, I'm a man who leads
an orderly life, you know that.

1041
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:27,618
I close doors and tighten bottle tops.

1042
01:21:27,718 --> 01:21:31,626
Miss Timberlake is a bottle
wandering around with a loose top.

1043
01:21:31,726 --> 01:21:35,467
She can't hold a job,
she destroys everything she touches.

1044
01:21:35,567 --> 01:21:39,392
She should get married. Only a husband
is equipped for such a beating.

1045
01:21:39,492 --> 01:21:43,400
That's it. Roger, you have plenty of friends,
find her a husband.

1046
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,780
A simple, dull, unimaginative man

1047
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,788
who will smile tolerantly when he learns
she's misplaced the children.

1048
01:21:50,888 --> 01:21:53,557
Return it, mark it address unknown.

1049
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:11,418
Dr Gruber? Roger.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

1050
01:22:11,518 --> 01:22:17,180
Not at all. I received your message.
Things worked out well in Bermuda?

1051
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,019
There's been a fantastic development!
He's mentioned marriage.

1052
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:23,860
And how do you feel about this?

1053
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,577
Naturally, I'm delighted. He just left me
and I tell you this is the real thing.

1054
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:29,871
I see.

1055
01:22:31,928 --> 01:22:34,967
Roger, I'll be away for a while.

1056
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:40,611
I think I'd better go back to Vienna
for a refresher course.

1057
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:45,944
He doesn't love me,
he just feels sorry for me.

1058
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,909
Doesn't love you?
He compared you to the plague.

1059
01:22:49,009 --> 01:22:52,873
- What else could it be?
- He wants me to marry another man.

1060
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:57,804
I drew up a list of 20 eligible bachelors
and turned he them all down. Why?

1061
01:22:59,568 --> 01:23:04,026
This one had a low hairline
and this one graduated from Purdue.

1062
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:06,609
- He even turned him down.
- Rock Hudson?

1063
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:09,660
He said you'd have to live in California.

1064
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,669
When he talks about a simple, dull,
unimaginative husband, he means himself.

1065
01:23:14,769 --> 01:23:16,923
He didn't say he was in love.

1066
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:20,889
It's like having a baby,
the man is always the last one to know.

1067
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:25,111
And how do we awaken him?
Not with a kiss but with a sledgehammer.

1068
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:28,867
- But I'm going away with Beasley.
- It has to be a Beasley.

1069
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,747
- If he's as repulsive as you say.
- Worse.

1070
01:23:31,847 --> 01:23:36,089
- How about running away with you?
- No, he'd admire your choice.

1071
01:23:36,189 --> 01:23:38,259
It has to be someone inferior.

1072
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:43,186
To shatter Philip's ego you have go off
with the lowest human you can find.

1073
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:47,741
That's Beasley. He's so low
when they bury him they'll have to dig up.

1074
01:23:47,841 --> 01:23:51,535
- Mr Beasley, please.
- We're doing this for Philip,

1075
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:53,918
it's for his own good, and yours too.

1076
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:56,760
He's a very nice man
and I'm the last one to admit it.

1077
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:01,227
Even if it worked, it wouldn't be honest.
I'd be tricking him.

1078
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:04,272
- It's a terrible way to get a man.
- Let's re-examine...

1079
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,025
Stop pressing her.

1080
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:11,245
You have now arrived at the crossroads
that every woman eventually arrives at,

1081
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:15,473
you can either be an honest old maid
or a happy liar.

1082
01:24:19,315 --> 01:24:21,690
- 'Hello?'
- Hello.

1083
01:24:23,991 --> 01:24:26,033
This is Catherine Timberlake.

1084
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,786
Well, hello there.

1085
01:24:33,177 --> 01:24:34,777
Come on.

1086
01:24:35,181 --> 01:24:37,844
I've been thinking about you.

1087
01:24:37,944 --> 01:24:44,022
'I wonder if I could, er,
reconsider your invitation, Everett.'

1088
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:46,324
I'm not one to hold grudges.

1089
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:49,657
Tonight?

1090
01:24:49,757 --> 01:24:52,871
We could have a TV dinner
at my apartment.

1091
01:24:52,971 --> 01:24:54,542
Asbury Park.

1092
01:24:54,642 --> 01:25:00,148
Er, I've heard of this charming place
in, er Asbury Park.

1093
01:25:01,192 --> 01:25:03,390
It's, er...

1094
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,115
Al's Motel.

1095
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:10,701
That's a long drive.
What time do you have to be home?

1096
01:25:10,801 --> 01:25:11,801
Oh...

1097
01:25:13,217 --> 01:25:15,093
it all depends.

1098
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,547
On what?

1099
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:20,443
Oh... Everett.

1100
01:25:24,783 --> 01:25:28,915
- I'll borrow my brother-in-law's car.
- Pick me up at five.

1101
01:25:30,002 --> 01:25:32,293
And I'll be waiting... Everett.

1102
01:25:34,636 --> 01:25:38,549
Ooh! He's like a snake.
When he smiles, he rattles.

1103
01:25:38,649 --> 01:25:41,891
He'll pick you up at five
and at one minute past five

1104
01:25:41,991 --> 01:25:44,770
I'll drop the bombshell on Mr Shayne's lap.

1105
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:50,157
- What if he doesn't follow us?
- We're dealing with a monumental ego.

1106
01:25:50,257 --> 01:25:52,828
You'll never get halfway to Asbury Park.

1107
01:25:55,638 --> 01:25:59,805
My brother-in-law's car is
being repaired but he let me have this.

1108
01:26:05,616 --> 01:26:09,749
On the way back we have to make
a delivery for him in Hoboken.

1109
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:41,051
- You've got to follow her.
- Why?

1110
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:46,105
She's going away with another man.
She's lost her confidence with you.

1111
01:26:46,205 --> 01:26:48,946
OK, send her a box of confidence.

1112
01:26:49,046 --> 01:26:51,741
Don't you realise what will happen?

1113
01:26:51,841 --> 01:26:55,916
Nothing will happen, I speak as a veteran
of two Bermuda campaigns.

1114
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:58,047
But she's in love with you.

1115
01:26:58,147 --> 01:27:01,760
- She has a fine way of showing it.
- She's afraid of you.

1116
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:05,142
- What does that mean?
- She's not afraid of him.

1117
01:27:05,242 --> 01:27:08,777
She doesn't care what he thinks.
That's how it happens.

1118
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,750
Get my clothes.

1119
01:27:13,923 --> 01:27:16,927
Get me a hairbrush, a comb,
get me everything.

1120
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:24,725
- Where's my driver?
- He went out to eat, sir.

1121
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:27,023
- Who sent him to eat?
- You did.

1122
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:28,123
Cab!

1123
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:36,418
Asbury Park. Al's Motel.

1124
01:27:36,518 --> 01:27:38,553
This girl I've gotta see.

1125
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:43,730
Go on, hurry.

1126
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:48,858
- Who is this man?
- He's a clerk at the unemployment office.

1127
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,822
How naive can she be?

1128
01:27:50,922 --> 01:27:54,784
What does she think
he's taking her there for? An aptitude test?

1129
01:27:54,884 --> 01:27:58,962
Haven't you ever seen a man dress before?
Give me my shirt.

1130
01:27:59,062 --> 01:28:04,220
Al's Motel! Sounds like a place
where you bring your own light bulbs.

1131
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,693
- Why would she do that?
- He's a man and she's a woman.

1132
01:28:08,793 --> 01:28:13,203
That's the most dangerous combination
to turn loose in a motel.

1133
01:28:16,969 --> 01:28:18,929
Please, keep your eye on the road.

1134
01:28:26,572 --> 01:28:30,652
When I called for the reservation
I talked to the proprietor.

1135
01:28:30,752 --> 01:28:35,327
He said we could use the burner
in his kitchen to heat up the TV dinners.

1136
01:28:35,427 --> 01:28:37,466
We're having haddock.

1137
01:28:38,555 --> 01:28:40,962
Would you like a drink?

1138
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:43,846
Oh, yes. That'd be fine. Let's stop for one.

1139
01:28:43,946 --> 01:28:47,271
No need to. I thought of everything.

1140
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:49,941
Muscatel. For my lady's pleasure.

1141
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:56,336
There's some paper cups
in the glove compartment.

1142
01:28:58,763 --> 01:29:02,677
Would you mind stopping at
the service station for a minute?

1143
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,850
Oh, of course.

1144
01:29:22,813 --> 01:29:27,187
- Can't you go any faster?
- This cab's got 300,000 miles on her.

1145
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:30,943
Would you ask your grandmother
to run the high hurdles?

1146
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:34,368
Why am I chasing her?
I should be grateful to the man.

1147
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:36,248
Freud had a theory about that.

1148
01:29:36,348 --> 01:29:40,715
If he'd ever met this girl,
he'd have opened a delicatessen.

1149
01:29:40,815 --> 01:29:41,815
Yes.

1150
01:29:42,228 --> 01:29:44,472
Freud's Famous Frankfurters.

1151
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:56,414
Would you mind pulling into that station?

1152
01:29:56,514 --> 01:29:57,514
Sure.

1153
01:30:19,304 --> 01:30:23,383
- That convertible ahead, catch up to it.
- I'm doing 70 now.

1154
01:30:23,483 --> 01:30:25,514
I'll burn out a bearing.

1155
01:30:25,614 --> 01:30:27,977
Maybe they'll stop off for dinner.

1156
01:30:28,077 --> 01:30:33,202
When a girl's taken to a place called
Al's Motel, she better not count on dinner.

1157
01:31:02,225 --> 01:31:03,825
Amazing.

1158
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:13,321
I told you she wouldn't make it. She's gone.

1159
01:31:13,421 --> 01:31:17,873
We'll see that she gets a decent burial.
Roger, give him a cheque.

1160
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,255
First phone for another cab.
He'll be right back.

1161
01:31:29,657 --> 01:31:31,942
- Do you know Asbury Park?
- Yeah.

1162
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:34,950
- A place called Al's Motel?
- Yeah.

1163
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:37,367
50 bucks if you get me there.

1164
01:31:37,467 --> 01:31:39,673
Well, it's a little out of my way.

1165
01:31:40,763 --> 01:31:41,763
Here.

1166
01:31:42,433 --> 01:31:45,105
- Hop in the back.
- Right. In the...? Oh.

1167
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:11,950
Oh!

1168
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:28,267
But there's the motel,
we'll be in in a few minutes.

1169
01:32:28,367 --> 01:32:30,935
You register and I'll meet you inside.

1170
01:32:31,035 --> 01:32:35,035
OK. But when you get back to New York,
you ought to have a checkup.

1171
01:32:47,859 --> 01:32:49,933
- This is it.
- Thank you.

1172
01:32:50,033 --> 01:32:52,437
A man spends an entire lifetime

1173
01:32:52,537 --> 01:32:58,326
trying to lead a civilised, dignified,
orderly existence and then he meets a girl,

1174
01:32:58,426 --> 01:33:01,874
five days later he's running round
New York in a bath towel,

1175
01:33:01,974 --> 01:33:05,006
riding in a truck filled with dead chickens,

1176
01:33:05,106 --> 01:33:08,305
tracking her down to
this beaverboard Taj Mahal.

1177
01:33:08,405 --> 01:33:11,520
And poets call it love.
No wonder they starve.

1178
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:14,240
Oh, the nuts you pick up on the road.

1179
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:17,240
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1180
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:21,249
Did a couple just register here?
A blonde about so high?

1181
01:33:21,349 --> 01:33:24,257
Yeah! About ten minutes ago.
Mr and Mrs Smith.

1182
01:33:24,357 --> 01:33:27,719
- That's them.
- Are you a friend of the happy couple?

1183
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:29,768
I gave the bride away.

1184
01:33:29,868 --> 01:33:34,825
- They're in the bridal suite. I'll ring them.
- No. Let me surprise them.

1185
01:33:42,554 --> 01:33:44,507
Oh. All right, where is she?

1186
01:33:44,607 --> 01:33:46,469
- Who?
- Mrs Smith.

1187
01:33:46,569 --> 01:33:49,353
- She's in there, changing.
- Into what?

1188
01:33:51,656 --> 01:33:53,564
Now just a moment.

1189
01:33:53,664 --> 01:33:55,568
What she ever saw in you...

1190
01:33:55,668 --> 01:33:58,239
- Come out of there!
- What right have you got?

1191
01:33:58,339 --> 01:34:02,122
Every right. I least I took her to a hotel,
not a rabbit hutch.

1192
01:34:02,222 --> 01:34:05,883
- She went to a hotel with you?
- She collects hotel keys.

1193
01:34:05,983 --> 01:34:08,019
Are you coming out?

1194
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,907
Congratulations, my friend.
You've got a great little girl there.

1195
01:34:19,714 --> 01:34:21,833
Who was that man?

1196
01:34:21,933 --> 01:34:24,634
You librarians live it up pretty good.

1197
01:34:25,601 --> 01:34:29,181
He didn't follow me and Beasley's
checking in. What shall I do?

1198
01:34:29,281 --> 01:34:31,600
Don't fall apart, keep your head.

1199
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,899
Remember your girl scout training.

1200
01:34:33,999 --> 01:34:36,529
We never covered a situation like this.

1201
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:39,114
Stall for time. Go to the ladies' room.

1202
01:34:39,214 --> 01:34:43,670
I already hit every gas station
between Newark and Asbury Park.

1203
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:46,299
Oh, what made me think it would work?

1204
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:49,307
Why should he follow me?
He doesn't love me.

1205
01:34:49,407 --> 01:34:54,566
Oh, Connie, if only he'd show up.
I'd fall on the ground and kiss his feet...

1206
01:34:57,709 --> 01:34:59,783
Oh, Mr Shayne.

1207
01:34:59,883 --> 01:35:01,999
What a pleasant surprise.

1208
01:35:02,099 --> 01:35:05,128
Erm, are you stopping at
the same motel we are?

1209
01:35:05,228 --> 01:35:08,637
Don't press your luck. Kiss his feet!

1210
01:35:08,737 --> 01:35:10,638
Did you drive up with anyone?

1211
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:12,476
Yes, a plucked chicken.

1212
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:16,986
Oh. Maybe the four of us
can get together later for a drink.

1213
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:21,078
Oh, honey. You're blowing the whole thing.

1214
01:35:21,178 --> 01:35:23,792
- Hang up the phone.
- I will not.

1215
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:25,923
Hang up that phone.

1216
01:35:26,023 --> 01:35:30,514
This is no time to argue.
Get married first, then fight.

1217
01:35:30,614 --> 01:35:31,810
Hello?

1218
01:35:33,574 --> 01:35:35,693
My lover's waiting for me.

1219
01:35:35,793 --> 01:35:38,739
After we're married, I'll invite him over.

1220
01:35:38,839 --> 01:35:43,248
- We can't get married, I have problems.
- We'll work on them.

1221
01:35:43,348 --> 01:35:46,713
I'm unstable.
What kind of mother would I make?

1222
01:35:46,813 --> 01:35:49,473
If you fail, we can breed poodles.

1223
01:35:49,573 --> 01:35:54,606
I also lie. And I can't stand Beasley.
It was a trap to get you to follow me.

1224
01:35:54,706 --> 01:35:56,942
And don't forget the rashes.

1225
01:35:57,042 --> 01:35:59,113
Put your hands in.

1226
01:35:59,213 --> 01:36:00,213
Hey!

1227
01:36:08,562 --> 01:36:12,065
Hey, come back!
I've already paid for the room!

1228
01:36:23,593 --> 01:36:27,545
Did a couple just check in?
Blonde woman about this high?

1229
01:36:27,645 --> 01:36:29,685
Yeah. Number 9.

1230
01:36:30,691 --> 01:36:32,765
But what was I to think when...

1231
01:36:32,865 --> 01:36:37,070
You believe I never cared for
another man till you walked into the library?

1232
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:39,870
- Of course!
- I won't be long.

1233
01:36:51,567 --> 01:36:53,609
All right, where is she?

1234
01:36:55,033 --> 01:37:00,080
You're even more repulsive than she said.
No wonder she begged me to come.

1235
01:37:02,089 --> 01:37:04,580
It's me, Roger.

1236
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,878
Hello?

1237
01:37:06,765 --> 01:37:09,555
Mother! You were right about women.

1238
01:37:11,274 --> 01:37:13,682
Yes, Momma. I'll wait outside.

1239
01:37:13,782 --> 01:37:15,821
Come and get me.

1240
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,957
Nothing serious, just another rash.
Quite common on honeymoons.

1241
01:37:25,057 --> 01:37:28,383
I would recommend
an uninterrupted night's sleep.

1242
01:37:28,483 --> 01:37:30,301
Naturally.

1243
01:37:30,401 --> 01:37:31,597
Cathy!

1244
01:37:32,067 --> 01:37:34,770
- Yes, darling?
- I'm so sorry.

1245
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:36,900
You couldn't help it.

1246
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,613
But it never happened before.

1247
01:37:39,713 --> 01:37:42,954
You've never been in
this situation before - married.

1248
01:37:43,054 --> 01:37:45,090
Hmm, that could be it.

1249
01:37:46,012 --> 01:37:49,631
- I just had a horrible thought.
- What?

1250
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:54,269
You break out when we're not married, I do
when we are, we may never get together.

1251
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:59,077
If that's what you think, you don't know
the girls in Upper Sandusky.

1252
01:38:11,356 --> 01:38:16,147
Roger, take care of the baby, will you?
I want to take a picture of Cathy.

1253
01:38:16,247 --> 01:38:18,283
Come along, dear.

1254
01:38:25,093 --> 01:38:26,917
Dr Gruber!

1255
01:38:27,017 --> 01:38:28,213
Roger.

1256
01:38:29,602 --> 01:38:31,927
- How was Vienna?
- I just got back.

1257
01:38:32,027 --> 01:38:33,976
I've been meaning to call you.

1258
01:38:34,076 --> 01:38:36,394
What happened with that friend of yours?

1259
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:38,367
The wedding was last July.

1260
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:42,580
- How did it work out?
- Take a look.
