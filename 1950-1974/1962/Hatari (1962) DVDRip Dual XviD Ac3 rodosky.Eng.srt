1
00:00:56,927 --> 00:01:00,920
- Kurt, can you hear me?
- Go ahead, Sean.

2
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,040
At about 11 o'clock,

3
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:08,201
right in the middle of that herd
of wildebeest. See him?

4
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:13,605
- Now that's a good one.
- Let's go. Start out easy.

5
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:16,281
OK, Pockets.

6
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:27,043
This one must be a female, she can't
make up her mind which way to go.

7
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,044
Tell Kurt to let her run a while,
wear her down.

8
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:59,042
- Sean says give her some exercise.
- That's what we'll do.

9
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,799
Tell us when you want her.

10
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,845
Tell Kurt to take his time.
This is a mean one.

11
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:25,165
Take your time, Kurt.

12
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,045
Try her, Pockets, move in closer.
See what she's like.

13
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:45,001
Watch her, Pockets. Don't lose her.

14
00:03:56,847 --> 00:04:00,317
The rhino got the Indian.
Swing around.

15
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:12,242
Bring the first-aid kit.

16
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:18,042
Are you trying to get a vacation?

17
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,596
- He hooked me good.
- He did, at that.

18
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:25,443
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- I didn't know he planned to ride with us.

19
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:29,156
- You can fix that up, Pockets.
- Big Band-Aid will do it.

20
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,761
- You all right?
- Want to stretch out?

21
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:36,921
Leave him here. Makes it easier
for me to work. Room, please!

22
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,717
Tough luck.

23
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,644
My fault. I messed it up.

24
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:59,924
- How is it your fault?
- I was driving, wasn't I?

25
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:04,763
- The Indian could have shot him.
- You find him again, I'll shoot him.

26
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:08,317
This tourniquet isn't working.
Better get him to hospital.

27
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,047
- Get him into the catching truck.
- Luis.

28
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:14,563
- Come on. Give 'em a hand.
- Hold it, buddy.

29
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,080
Easy.

30
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,445
Kurt.

31
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,040
Calling Arusha Control.

32
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,675
Arusha Control speaking. Go ahead.

33
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,599
This is Sean Mercer.

34
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:41,885
A man's been horned by a rhino.
He's bleeding pretty badly.

35
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:47,838
Tell Dr Sanderson we'll be at Arusha
hospital in about five hours. Over.

36
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:52,523
- Will do. Anything else?
- That's all. Over and out.

37
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,360
That hole looks very bad.

38
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:58,246
It don't look good.

39
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:01,763
After we get out of here,
push on ahead to the compound.

40
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:04,760
Pick up Brandy,
she'd want to be at the hospital.

41
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,919
You'll get there as quickly as we do.

42
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,482
- Arga! Where's Missy?
- In room.

43
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:59,196
No dinner. We're going into town.
The Indian bwana got hurt.

44
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:03,360
- Bad?
- I don't know yet. Get me some coffee.

45
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,519
Come in.

46
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,280
Hi, Kurt. You're back early.

47
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,124
- Is something wrong?
- Ja.

48
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:23,996
The Indian... Rhino gored him
in the leg. He lost a lot of blood.

49
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,681
They are taking him into hospital now.

50
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:30,203
- Must we hurry?
- I came ahead. There's plenty of time.

51
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,724
Thanks for coming for me.
Help me with my zipper, it's stuck.

52
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:37,117
Come over with me.

53
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:43,205
How did it happen? Was it
the same way as my father was killed?

54
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,597
No, we hadn't even put a rope on him.

55
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,837
How then?

56
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:53,922
It was my fault. I got too close.
The engine was spitting a little...

57
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:57,636
I took the chance and the Indian
was the one that got hurt.

58
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,799
You all take chances.
That's part of the job.

59
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,118
I know, but I shouldn't
have taken that one.

60
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,960
And to pull this thing up here...

61
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:10,961
I'm afraid of ripping something...

62
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:15,920
- Here you are.
- Thank you. I'll get a coat.

63
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:24,806
- How long does it take?
- As long as it takes.

64
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,516
You mean to tell whether
a man can live or not?

65
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,042
Patience, my boy, patience.

66
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:34,199
Sterling virtue. I wish I had more of it.

67
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:40,522
All we can do is wait.
Just don't start climbing the walls.

68
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:45,156
Who's got a cigarette?

69
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,081
- It's yours?
- Thanks.

70
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,637
- Which one is Sean Mercer?
- I am.

71
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,277
- I hear you've got a job open.
- What job?

72
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,200
They said in town
you'd be needing a man.

73
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,517
You're in a rush, aren't you?

74
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,155
Is he asking for the Indian's job?

75
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:07,364
- He's not dead yet.
- I know that.

76
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:10,883
I asked for the job
because I was afraid if I waited,

77
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:13,686
someone else might get it.

78
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:23,045
- You'd better get out of here.
- I'm not talking to you, I just...

79
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:26,797
Kurt, take it easy.
When a fellow's hungry... Cut it out!

80
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,242
Damp it! You can't whip us all.

81
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,523
- I can try.
- Bring your lunch.

82
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:33,757
What's going on here?

83
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,725
I have a patient already.
I don't want any more.

84
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:41,199
- How is he, Sandy? How's the Indian?
- Not good.

85
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:44,999
Did it have to be the Indian?

86
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,920
- What do you mean?
- We didn't arrange it.

87
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:52,797
You seem to take turns getting hurt.
I wish it was someone else.

88
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:56,562
You all have standard type blood
that's easy to match.

89
00:11:56,727 --> 00:12:00,242
- The Indian has to be different.
- He needs a transfusion?

90
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:03,922
Plasma is not doing the job.
I need whole blood.

91
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:09,081
AB negative is not very easy to find.
I'll have to call on...

92
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:13,762
- What is that for?
- I was thinking...

93
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:16,805
...you were in a little too much of a hurry.

94
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,720
We are talking about blood type.

95
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:21,843
Exactly.

96
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:25,318
You mean, that is your blood type?
AB negative?

97
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,079
That's right.

98
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,239
Well, it seems the Indian's luck
hasn't run out.

99
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:32,523
- If you're willing...
- He is.

100
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,882
- I will?
- If you want that job.

101
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,164
I don't want anything from you,
including the job.

102
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:42,559
- You refuse to give him the blood?
- I didn't say that.

103
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:47,755
But I don't like to be told.
You are going to have to ask me now.

104
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,918
I ask you, please.

105
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:55,521
I'm sorry, Mademoiselle,
but he's going to have to ask me.

106
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,957
All right. I'm asking you.

107
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,165
This is the way you ask?

108
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,240
- Where do I go?
- In there. Tell the nurse...

109
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:23,037
- Wait. Tomorrow...
- He won't be going anywhere tomorrow.

110
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:28,076
When he's through with you,
we'll talk about that job.

111
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:33,006
I'll think about it. Mademoiselle...
Where did you say to go?

112
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:37,285
Second door on the left.
Tell the nurse to get you ready.

113
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:40,917
- Who's he?
- I don't know. I'm glad he's here.

114
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:44,636
Doc, how long before you can tell us
about the Indian?

115
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:49,323
Two or three hours. In the meantime,
would you do me a favour?

116
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:52,047
- Sure, Doc.
- Get out of here.

117
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,801
Leave me in peace. Go have a drink.

118
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,039
I think the Indian will be all right.

119
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:02,359
- We'll be at the Safari Bar. Coming?
- On the way.

120
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:12,484
Safari Bar. Yes, sir, they're here.

121
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,877
Hello, Doc. How's the Indian?

122
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:19,120
Did he have a tough time?
Everything OK? Nothing went wrong?

123
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:23,121
- He don't say anything.
- Give him a chance and shut up!

124
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,763
He what? Thanks, Doc.

125
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:34,557
The Indian sat up, asked for a drink
and made a pass at the nurse.

126
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:37,195
Thanks, Doc. We'll call you tomorrow.

127
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,722
- Youman! Another round.
- Yes, sir.

128
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:48,723
- Port!
- Port.

129
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,923
- Starboard!
- Starboard.

130
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:53,396
- Drop it!
- Drop it.

131
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:57,446
- Breakfast at six.
- It's a challenge we'll try to meet.

132
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:00,280
- Goodnight, everybody.
- Goodnight.

133
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,358
Goodnight, Brandy.

134
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,755
- Dead ahead, sailor.
- Aye, aye, sir!

135
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:12,482
Goodnight!

136
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:23,516
Before you go any further,
I should tell you, you're not alone.

137
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:28,681
I waited for you. The house boy
was gone and it was getting late.

138
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:33,637
Hi. I had to sleep somewhere
and I just picked a room.

139
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,799
I suppose I picked yours.
I hope you don't mind.

140
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,356
I don't mind... Who are you?

141
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,165
- Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
- What?

142
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:45,366
Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
And who are you?

143
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:49,406
I'm Sean Mercer, but...
What are you doing here?

144
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:53,845
- Trying to get some sleep.
- I don't mean that, I mean...

145
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:58,080
- You didn't expect me?
- I sure didn't.

146
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:04,037
- What's that for?
- I wanted to see if...

147
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,995
...if I was seeing things.
- You've been drinking a little.

148
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,965
No, ma'am. I've been drinking a lot.

149
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:17,961
Sean, I wanna talk to you about
tomorrow morning. Don't you think?

150
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,646
I wanna talk to you about tomorrow...

151
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:28,843
- Is there somebody in your bed?
- Yes, there is.

152
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,362
What did you want to say to me?

153
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:36,157
I had something important to say.
Can't remember what it is.

154
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,716
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

155
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:42,766
Sean. Do you have some?
I beg your pardon, I didn't expect...

156
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,077
He doesn't know who she is.

157
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,681
- Why is she in his bed?
- He doesn't know.

158
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:50,315
- I didn't say that.
- What did you say?

159
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,876
- I don't know.
- That's what you said.

160
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:54,400
- What?
- "I don't know. "

161
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,035
If you don't know,
why did you say so?

162
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:59,880
You get me mixed up, now. You said...

163
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:03,244
Look, you don't listen.
Let's start from the start...

164
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:07,036
Please, I had a long trip
and I would like some sleep.

165
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:10,085
- Wouldn't you?
- I certainly would.

166
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:13,398
No, no, no. Who are you
and why are you in his bed?

167
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:16,798
Why don't we leave the whole thing
until tomorrow?

168
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:20,642
She's right. We can face it
in the morning with clear heads.

169
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,844
- Yes, she is right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

170
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,202
Goodnight, Sean.

171
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,642
Thanks for the use of your room.

172
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,516
I didn't have much to say about it,
did I?

173
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,837
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

174
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,441
Anybody want one of these?

175
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,677
Black coffee.

176
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,561
Morning! Good morning, Sean.

177
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,323
- Jambo, Arga!
- Jambo!

178
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:00,637
What have we got for breakfast?

179
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,877
Bacon and eggs...

180
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:05,607
My favourite, codfish cakes.

181
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,327
Deep-fried with antelope fat,
I love it.

182
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,726
- Isn't anybody eating?
- Please, Pockets.

183
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,242
- Go away or shut up.
- Preferably both.

184
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,365
He's not human.
To drink that much and not feel it...

185
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:22,725
- We had a big night last night.
- You remember?

186
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:26,118
- Sean. I'm going on the wagon.
- Why?

187
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:30,485
I'm beginning to see things.
I thought I saw a girl in Sean's room.

188
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,524
You saw a girl.

189
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:35,042
That's what I said.
I thought I saw a girl.

190
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,244
Pockets, you did see a girl.

191
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:39,920
- I did?
- You did.

192
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:42,123
Good! Now, I don't...

193
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:44,357
- Well, who was she?
- I don't know.

194
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:46,279
- Don't start that again.
- What?

195
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,403
"I don't know. "

196
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,922
- Sean, he just said...
- Please!

197
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:53,442
Morning, everybody!
Morning, Pockets.

198
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:56,804
- Look what I found.
- What's this?

199
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,527
Cameras, lenses,
a real professional outfit.

200
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,086
Your room-mate.

201
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,919
- Professional?
- Photographer?

202
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:05,442
Didn't a photographer write to the Indian?

203
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:08,485
- From a zoo in Switzerland.
- Basle, wasn't it?

204
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:12,276
Yeah, but...
that was signed by a man, I think.

205
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,642
Well, go get the letter!

206
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,282
Sean, what does he mean,
"your room-mate"?

207
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:25,201
- The girl in my bed last night.
- Sean!

208
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,039
I didn't know her!

209
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:31,041
- What was she doing in your bed?
- I don't know.

210
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:34,005
Here it is. It's signed on the bottom.

211
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,839
A M D'Aless...

212
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:37,918
D'Alessandro.

213
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,840
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

214
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,919
I don't think I have met everybody.

215
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:47,966
We'd better introduce ourselves.
They call me Pockets.

216
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:50,357
They tell me we met last night.

217
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:54,406
I remember you. Who wears
the other half of your pyjamas?

218
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,762
I do. My name is Kurt Mueller.

219
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,124
I know you. I covered the Le Mans race
three years ago.

220
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
You should have won.
That crash... Too bad.

221
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,646
I don't know... He walked away from it.

222
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,561
I'm Luis Francisco García López.
I don't wear pyjamas.

223
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:14,756
And this is our boss,
Miss Delacourt. We call her Brandy.

224
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:17,600
How do you do?
I'm not really their boss.

225
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:21,077
They were my father's friends.
Now we all work together.

226
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:25,160
I know of your father.
One doesn't work at the zoo long

227
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,478
without hearing of Frenchy Delacourt.

228
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:32,720
Kurt, Luis, will you help me
to check the motor on the truck?

229
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,320
Yes, boss.

230
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:37,877
- Will you have some breakfast?
- Thank you. Just coffee.

231
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,766
- Just coffee. Codfish cakes?
- No, thank you.

232
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:43,600
Miss... D'Alessander?

233
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,839
- D'Alessandro. "Dallas" is easier.
- Thank you.

234
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:51,444
- Did you sign this letter?
- Yes, of course. Why?

235
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:56,442
Because A M D'Alessandro
sounds like a man.

236
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,485
You mean because I'm a girl,
I can't do the job?

237
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:01,319
I mean we've got trouble enough.

238
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:05,400
Why not find out
what kind of girl I am before deciding?

239
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:09,526
- I wish I had the time...
- What about Miss Delacourt?

240
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:12,724
- She goes out with you.
- She was born and raised here.

241
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:16,197
She can drive as well as anyone here,
except Kurt.

242
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:19,598
She can shoot a gun as well as anyone,
except the Indian.

243
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:21,758
- Can you handle a gun?
- No.

244
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,599
Have you ever been hunting?

245
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,803
- Have you ever been to Africa?
- No...

246
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,959
Well, I'm sorry, Dallas,
about the misunderstanding.

247
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:31,561
We're short-handed, there isn't time to...

248
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,399
...take care of an amateur?

249
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,923
That's what I was going to say.
I'm sorry.

250
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,999
Well, I'm sorry, too.

251
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:44,160
I hate to do this.
I would prefer that you wanted me.

252
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:48,206
Here is a letter
from the director of the zoo.

253
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,996
I have a slight premonition
the boom is about to be lowered.

254
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:55,079
That zoo will buy
most of your animals this season.

255
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:58,080
And they want pictures of the catchings.

256
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,080
The boom has been lowered.

257
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,715
How long will it take to get your pictures?

258
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:08,483
As long as it takes to catch
your animals. I'm ready when you are.

259
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:13,801
That's a funny-looking work outfit,
but suit yourself. We're ready now.

260
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:17,323
- You won't give me five minutes?
- I can wait a few minutes.

261
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:21,605
- Thank you. I'll be right back.
- I can catch up with you, Sean.

262
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,281
What is it?
Did I say something wrong?

263
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:27,245
- I don't know.
- Nobody knows anything.

264
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:34,880
- Where are we going today?
- Manyara, I guess.

265
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:44,117
Are you gonna carry her stuff?
Don't start in by spoiling her.

266
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,517
Yes, bwana.

267
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,642
- Jambo!
- Jambo!

268
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,045
- All set, Brandy?
- All set.

269
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,437
Let's get under way.

270
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,521
Pockets. Don't wait all day for her.

271
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,318
Yes, bwana! Yes!

272
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:28,159
- Dallas, let's go!
- I'll be right out!

273
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,887
Take my stuff, will you?

274
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,843
All aboard!

275
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:53,437
I'm coming!

276
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:01,919
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,442
Aren't we going? Let's go!

278
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:09,198
- Where are we going today?
- Yeah.

279
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,039
I said... Look out!

280
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:22,766
I didn't see that darned thing!

281
00:25:57,127 --> 00:26:00,676
- How does the ground seem to you?
- Could be better.

282
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:03,361
- Some gullies over there.
- Yeah.

283
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,404
If we get after a good one,

284
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:09,082
stick around and hold him
if I miss the first time.

285
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:10,919
Will do.

286
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:15,242
- Give me that pad.
- Is it OK if I stand back there?

287
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,716
Stay inside, that ground's rough.

288
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:21,641
I'll be all right. I like to be
where I can move around.

289
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,162
You'll move around all right.

290
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:30,435
- What did you say?
- I told them to take care of you.

291
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:35,317
- Tell them I can take care of myself.
- OK...

292
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,958
Maybe.

293
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,435
Luis. Handle the pole.

294
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:50,562
Pockets, you pick me a big one
and I'll make you eat it!

295
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:53,799
Yes, bwana. I'll be very careful.

296
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,561
Start out easy.

297
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:07,323
Why don't they catch the big ones?

298
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:10,479
The last one tried
to get into Sean's lap.

299
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:15,163
Pockets thought he was coming through
the windshield and hit an ant-heap.

300
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:12,437
Take this one, Pockets!

301
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:47,925
Tell Kurt to let that one go.
The noose slipped.

302
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:52,399
Herding car... Let him go.
Sean's having noose trouble.

303
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:57,595
- Was that giraffe to your liking, bwana?
- Just get another one the same size.

304
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,644
- What happened?
- What?

305
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,162
- What happened?
- Nothing yet.

306
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:03,840
Knock on it!

307
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,964
Pockets!

308
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,159
You'd better stay there!

309
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,843
Take this one.

310
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:56,601
Get ready to shake hands with him!

311
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:10,926
All right...

312
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:14,636
Slow down easy! Easy!
Slow down easy!

313
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,966
Come on, hurry it up!
She's a handful of trouble.

314
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:36,000
- Get enough room to move around?
- Oh, shut up!

315
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:40,965
All right.

316
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:15,124
- Well, how is it?
- Terrible. I feel sore all over.

317
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:19,485
The best thing for you now
is a good hot bath. Come on.

318
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:24,402
- Thanks, Pockets.
- I'll put your things in the main building.

319
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:28,162
Brandy... I just want to say something.

320
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:31,603
You might not think so,
but I had a great day.

321
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:36,636
Only, I made a fool of myself.
I'm sorry, I apologise to all of you.

322
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:41,517
I would like to stay, if you'll let me,
but I don't want to force you, so...

323
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:44,565
...just forget about
the letter I showed you.

324
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:48,402
If you want me to go, just tell me. I'll go.

325
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,523
Thanks for listening.

326
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:01,123
Well, gentlemen.
Who's going to tell her to go?

327
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,757
Rhino, elephants, buffalo...

328
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,361
...and a greenhorn.

329
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,887
Well, if that's the way you want it.

330
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:34,443
Mamma mia!

331
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,599
Help!

332
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,759
Help!

333
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,717
Stand perfectly still. Don't move.

334
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:00,765
- I think I can save you.
- Thank you!

335
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:03,919
Get back! Back!

336
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:08,356
- Thank you!
- OK. Get back!

337
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:16,682
- What the?
- What's going on here?

338
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:18,883
What's this Clyde Beatty routine?

339
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:23,484
What's he doing to you, Sonya?
Poking a chair at you!

340
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:26,445
Come on, get out.
You don't belong here anyway!

341
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:28,757
Here, that's my girl.

342
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:31,521
Pockets,
aren't you ashamed of yourself?

343
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:34,599
Dallas screamed,
I ran in, saw the cheetah...

344
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:37,759
It looked too good to pass up,
so I thought I...

345
00:33:40,447 --> 00:33:43,245
- I was wrong.
- I think you're right.

346
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:46,797
- And stay out of here!
- Yes, ma'am.

347
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:20,199
Hi, Sonya.

348
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,403
Oh, nice!

349
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:39,758
- Shall I give you a hand?
- I just want to file these letters.

350
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:43,636
- Why don't you join the fun?
- I don't belong in there.

351
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:46,526
I've had all the fun
I can take for one day.

352
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:51,317
I've had bangs and bumps
on every part of my body, from...

353
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:53,398
...from bottom to top.

354
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:56,764
And I had a bath
with a cheetah and three men.

355
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,885
So I think I'll just sit for a while.

356
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,924
About not belonging...

357
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,443
They decided that
if you want to stay, it's all right.

358
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:08,246
I'm glad of that, because...

359
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,725
You said "they".
Did you vote against me?

360
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:16,084
I told you I thought
you'd be a damned nuisance.

361
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,365
Yeah, you did. And I was today, wasn't I?

362
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:24,122
You were. But at least you knew it.

363
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:30,283
Nice speech, but I don't think
you can talk your way out of it again.

364
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:48,286
- Hi. Care for some company?
- Yes, why not?

365
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:52,406
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.
We were rough on you today.

366
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,923
- I had it coming.
- Would you like a drink?

367
00:35:56,087 --> 00:36:00,877
- Just sit down and talk to me.
- Thank you, Sonya.

368
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,044
What'll we talk about?
My favourite subject?

369
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,437
- What?
- Me.

370
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:11,838
All right. We'll talk about you.

371
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:16,876
I noticed today that when everybody
was wrestling with the giraffe,

372
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:20,676
you were just sitting in the car,
laughing. Why?

373
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,997
Because the giraffe was out there.

374
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:26,159
- Why?
- The giraffe has spots.

375
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:30,286
The zebra has stripes...
and the lion is all one colour.

376
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:32,119
What are you talking about?

377
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:37,315
Dallas, any animal that has spots,
stripes, or is one colour,

378
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,081
any colour, I don't go near.

379
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:45,243
- You don't like animals.
- I like animals, I'm just scared of 'em.

380
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:50,879
But, Pockets, you drove right in
with all these giraffes around.

381
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:54,517
- What colour is a giraffe?
- Mostly yellow.

382
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:58,521
- What colour is a New York cab?
- Mostly yellow.

383
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:02,965
I drove a cab in Brooklyn. I pretend
it's rush hour in Flatbush and...

384
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,118
...in I go.

385
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:08,085
You people, you're all crazy!

386
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:12,559
Just gives me a chance
to do some of my old jokes.

387
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:18,404
You said you'd had a great day.
What was it that you liked?

388
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:25,204
Everything. The car going so fast,
the animals running...

389
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,437
It seems...

390
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:30,280
...a great way to make a living.

391
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,802
Well, crazy, but...

392
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:36,685
Pockets, tell me about things here.

393
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:40,317
Who are these men?
Where have they come from?

394
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:43,877
Well... You know about Brandy.

395
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,242
And Kurt. Let's see...

396
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:51,003
Luis, he's Mexican.
He started out as a bullfighter.

397
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:54,159
He told us he was pretty good.
I never saw him.

398
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,206
- Now, there's the Indian...
- The man who wrote to me.

399
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,722
Mister... Little Wolf.

400
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:04,963
Little Wolf! Wait till you meet him.

401
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:09,643
His folks didn't know what they had
when they called him Little Wolf.

402
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:13,561
- The Indian and I take care of Sean.
- Take care of him? How?

403
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:16,366
Sean's Irish and he gets mad.

404
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:21,078
If he takes his mad out on us,
nobody gets hurt. We don't mind.

405
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:27,004
- Pockets, why he doesn't like women?
- Why doesn't he like?

406
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:33,037
Dallas, I warn you, you are labouring
under a gross misapprehension...

407
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:37,439
- But why doesn't he like women?
- He thinks they're trouble.

408
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:42,283
Well, they are,
but who made him think so?

409
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,439
Well, that's a long story.

410
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:50,716
- He almost got married once.
- Well, that's possible.

411
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,037
He brought her here for a visit.

412
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:57,200
She hated the place, the animals,
everything and everybody.

413
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:02,600
She tried to get Sean to leave.
One day, she got on her broom and...

414
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,325
...just left town.

415
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,478
She was a fool.

416
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,202
You like it here, don't you?

417
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:14,518
Yeah, I like it.

418
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,485
I'm liable to like it too much.

419
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:21,805
Sean's got a way of...

420
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:27,436
You sure got it in a hurry, didn't you?

421
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,200
Pockets, tell me about him.

422
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:39,807
How does he treat you?

423
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:43,164
- You saw us all day.
- That was working.

424
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:46,683
You were with him a few minutes ago.
Was he nice to you?

425
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:48,883
No, he wasn't.

426
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,804
Well, lady, could be that you're in.

427
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,357
- What do you mean?
- I mean that's good.

428
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:01,758
If he were nice to you,
you wouldn't have a prayer.

429
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:04,885
Pockets, will you speak English?

430
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:08,756
- Bad is good, good is bad, I...
- OK, look...

431
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:12,920
If a man falls for a woman,
and gets his fingers burned,

432
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:16,443
so he won't be singed again,
what does he do?

433
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:18,677
I don't know. Tell me.

434
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:22,920
If he doesn't like you, he doesn't care
and he can be nice to you.

435
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,716
But if he does like you,
he doesn't want to get in any deeper.

436
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:31,438
So he acts mean. The more
he likes you, the meaner he acts.

437
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:34,485
- Doesn't that make sense?
- No.

438
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:39,562
Let's try a different way.
If you were me, what would you do?

439
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:42,287
If I were you, Dallas, I...

440
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:44,881
No, you wouldn't want me to answer that.

441
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:47,641
Pockets, make sense! What shall I do?

442
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:50,275
- Now you're making sense.
- What?

443
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:53,359
You said, "What shall I do?" That's it.

444
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:56,439
You're the one that has to do it. He won't.

445
00:40:57,807 --> 00:41:03,325
- That's simple, that I can understand.
- You know, I think you do.

446
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:06,684
Come on. We've settled everything,
let's get a drink.

447
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:10,123
Dallas, one thing,
please, don't make him too mean.

448
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:14,280
- Why?
- I told you. He takes it out on me!

449
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:18,800
What's so funny?

450
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,437
We were talking about
that big giraffe you picked last year.

451
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,359
What a mess!

452
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:27,405
- He stepped over Sean.
- Landed on the hood.

453
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:32,766
After all that trouble catching him,
we had to let him go two months later.

454
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:35,725
- Why?
- We couldn't get him to Mombasa.

455
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:38,924
His neck was too long
for the railroad tunnel.

456
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:43,444
- Dallas, do you want a drink?
- No, thank you.

457
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,359
- E Flat.
- What?

458
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:47,119
E Flat.

459
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:56,600
- I told you, E Flat.
- You'd better be good.

460
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:10,999
At least I played it with both hands.

461
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:30,446
Arusha Control calling...

462
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:35,158
Arusha Control calling 505.
Do you read me? Over.

463
00:43:35,327 --> 00:43:38,205
This is 505. We read you, over.

464
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,283
I have a transmission for you
from Dr Sanderson. Go ahead.

465
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:48,156
Hello 505. Can you hear me? Over.

466
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:50,841
Loud and clear, Sandy, go ahead.

467
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:54,602
Sean, you can have the Indian back
in three or four days.

468
00:43:54,767 --> 00:44:00,319
I wish it was sooner. My nurses
are all worn out, dodging him.

469
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:03,559
That's good for 'em!
The exercise'll keep 'em thin.

470
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:08,482
If that Frenchman's up and around,
I'd like to talk to him. Over.

471
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:12,117
The Frenchman?
Didn't he come to your place?

472
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:14,357
He sure did not.

473
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:20,636
He left here early this morning,
with £ 15 he borrowed from the Indian.

474
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:24,846
- Where'd the Indian get £15?
- Borrowed it from me.

475
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:29,438
Did the Frenchman say
what he was using the money for?

476
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:33,646
No, just borrowed it and took off.
Over.

477
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:38,358
I guess that's that.
Put the £15 on our bill, Doc.

478
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,041
Tell the Indian
we're not sure he's worth it.

479
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:45,120
I've already done both those things.
Over and out.

480
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:47,721
- That's good news.
- Three or four days.

481
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:51,004
The Frenchman took off.
Too bad, we could've used him.

482
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:54,239
Better to work short-handed
than with the wrong kind of man.

483
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:56,921
How do you know
he was the wrong kind?

484
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,282
Didn't you hear it over the radio?

485
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:03,076
He took £15 from the Indian
for saving his life.

486
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:06,239
What kind of a man would do that?

487
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:13,163
- Lafayette is coming.
- What are you talking about?

488
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:17,320
The French blood bank
just turned in the gate.

489
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,121
- Hi.
- Hello.

490
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:36,597
The Indian said to tell you
he'd be back in a few days.

491
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,476
- We talked to the doctor.
- Did he tell you I was coming?

492
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:43,798
He said you borrowed £15
from the Indian.

493
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:47,880
And he said he hadn't seen you since.

494
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:51,835
- You thought I was going to skip out?
- You could have.

495
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:56,275
I've got something to do first.

496
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:58,802
Do you always carry that chip
on your shoulder?

497
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:03,677
That depends. I needed the money
to get my rifle from the gunsmith.

498
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:06,839
Without a rifle
I couldn't be much good to you.

499
00:46:07,007 --> 00:46:09,396
Question is,
are you worth anything with it?

500
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,276
Why don't you try me and see?

501
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:19,044
Kurt is a pretty good shot.
Would you like to shoot against him?

502
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:21,277
I'd like that.

503
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:24,837
- Bring your gun down to the range.
- I'd like to go.

504
00:46:25,007 --> 00:46:28,158
Me, too. Would an audience bother you?

505
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,443
If it does, he won't be much use to us.

506
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:34,805
- It won't make any difference.
- Hop in.

507
00:46:45,847 --> 00:46:50,284
- Hey, where are you going? Wait!
- Dallas, come on!

508
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,364
All right.
Kurt, take the first bottle on the right.

509
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:09,758
And you... What is your name, anyway?

510
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,804
- Charles Maurey.
- Chalmo?

511
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:15,243
- Charles Maurey.
- Never mind. Chips will do.

512
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:19,320
You take the second one
and then alternate. Ready?

513
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,525
Go ahead.

514
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:44,601
There go my deposits!

515
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:49,404
Now shoot what's left of 'em.

516
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:12,723
That's pretty fair shooting.

517
00:48:12,887 --> 00:48:17,597
- He's faster than I am.
- A little.

518
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:21,885
Reload, Chip.
We'll see how fast you really are.

519
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:40,921
Well, it looks like you're going to work.

520
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:45,000
I still have something to do.
May I have your gun, please?

521
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:48,159
- Sure.
- Thank you.

522
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:55,565
You still want me now?

523
00:48:59,927 --> 00:49:03,522
You got the job.

524
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:05,678
OK.

525
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:11,795
But you've got a strange way
of asking for it.

526
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:48,039
- Kurt.
- Go ahead, Sean.

527
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:52,120
Our motor's a little hot.
We're going to get some water.

528
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:57,281
- Find a place in the shade and wait.
- OK, we'll be waiting for you.

529
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:41,884
- Holy smoke! What on earth is this?
- It's a well, a water-hole.

530
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,163
It belongs to the Masai tribe.

531
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:48,639
Nobody knows who built it
or how old it is. 2,000 years maybe.

532
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:52,595
You see how they raise the water
to the cattle.

533
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:02,763
Funny thing, they'll work all day
getting that water up.

534
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,760
But when it comes to repairs,
they won't touch it.

535
00:51:05,927 --> 00:51:08,521
They hire another tribe to do the work.

536
00:51:08,687 --> 00:51:11,679
They're cattlemen. Too proud to dig.

537
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:10,321
Can't you get any more speed
out of this thing?

538
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:12,478
Let's go, Pockets!

539
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:17,606
Oh, nuts! Don't slow down,
pass me the line.

540
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,997
Come on, hurry it up!

541
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:49,605
Some day, Pockets,
I'm gonna wring your neck!

542
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,235
Not today, bwana, not today!

543
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:54,967
Just shut up and drive!

544
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:59,836
We'd better get this one
or else he'll be awful mad!

545
00:53:08,407 --> 00:53:12,002
The Lone Ranger rides again! Yahoo!

546
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:28,878
If he misses again,
stick your fingers in your ears.

547
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:44,807
Slow down easy! Easy!

548
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:00,475
Hold him! Let me see something!

549
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:09,476
Hang on to him!

550
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:19,838
Open the door!

551
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:31,322
Kurt, get out of there. He's hard to hold.

552
00:54:31,487 --> 00:54:35,162
Come on out! Get the hell out, will you!

553
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:36,999
Get up!

554
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,727
Get him up!

555
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:49,884
I thought he was going
to take you clear to Arusha!

556
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,845
- You got another cage?
- No, thank you!

557
00:54:53,007 --> 00:54:55,999
Let's break out the beer.

558
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:11,003
Cheeky!

559
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:16,527
Chewy!

560
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,278
- Bring him over here.
- OK.

561
00:55:33,447 --> 00:55:36,166
He knows the way.

562
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:43,486
Come on!

563
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:46,525
See how he likes it?

564
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:08,806
- Want some?
- Brandy!

565
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:17,645
- Good morning.
- Morning.

566
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,526
I really twisted this thing yesterday.

567
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,245
Yeah.

568
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:25,717
What's the matter? You look liverish.
Too much sun?

569
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:28,037
Sean, how old is Brandy?

570
00:56:28,207 --> 00:56:30,926
She's around... Let's see, she was 17...

571
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,079
Have you had a close look at her lately?

572
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:39,684
Holy smoke! She's all grown up.

573
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:43,965
I noticed that the other night
when I was zipping up her dress.

574
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:46,925
- When you what?
- Zipping her dress.

575
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:49,601
All of a sudden,
I stopped thinking of her as a kid.

576
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:52,076
- You did?
- I did.

577
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:55,398
That Frenchman isn't looking at her
like she was a child.

578
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:58,923
Anybody with two eyes can see that.

579
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:01,760
That's why you're green around the gills!

580
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:05,363
Spring comes to the bushveld
and the bucks start fighting.

581
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,961
- So what?
- So...

582
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:14,166
I can't answer that. But don't let it
gum up the work around here.

583
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:19,276
I won't. But I'm not going
to give him a free hand, either.

584
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:21,756
This is going to be great.

585
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:25,397
The Indian's knocked out,
we're stuck with a woman photographer,

586
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,683
now you break out in monkey bites.

587
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:32,159
- And we're a month behind already!
- So what?

588
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:35,319
So don't give him a free hand.

589
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:40,924
Come on!

590
00:57:47,927 --> 00:57:50,077
Hey! It's the Indian!

591
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:52,886
- Welcome back, Little Wolf!
- We've missed you!

592
00:57:53,047 --> 00:57:55,402
- Don't spoil him.
- Get the stretcher.

593
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:59,355
- Comment ça va?
- Frenchie, you've got good blood.

594
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:02,280
- We're blood brothers.
- Not till I give you some back.

595
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:04,244
It's like carrying an elephant!

596
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:07,160
Indian, this is
Signorina Anna Maria D'Alessandro.

597
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:09,921
- Molto piacere, signorina!
- Piacere!

598
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:14,444
- Where are you taking me?
- Bed. You're going to stay there.

599
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,722
- Pockets stood in the chair.
- No kidding!

600
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:20,720
All right, clear out.
Let him get some sleep.

601
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:22,445
- 'Night.
- Thanks, boys.

602
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:25,246
- Brought you some water.
- I've had that for days.

603
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,683
- Maybe this'll help.
- That's more like it.

604
00:58:28,847 --> 00:58:31,680
Bring me up to date.
What's happened since I've been gone?

605
00:58:31,847 --> 00:58:36,682
Frenchman's working out pretty good.
Quick. Pretty fair shot.

606
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:41,079
- Better than I am?
- Just as good. Moves fast.

607
00:58:41,247 --> 00:58:42,805
Go on.

608
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:46,277
- We got a giraffe and a zebra.
- Go on.

609
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:49,917
The Frenchman and Kurt
got a thing going about Brandy.

610
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:54,842
- Well, good for Brandy! Go on.
- What do you mean, "go on"?

611
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:59,683
That Italian import out there.
Who does she belong to?

612
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:04,796
That Italian import out there
belongs to the Basle zoo.

613
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:08,846
That's A M D'Alessandro. Next time
you write to a photographer,

614
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:11,123
check what the initials mean.

615
00:59:11,287 --> 00:59:14,677
- How come you let her stay?
- I had no choice.

616
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:17,566
- You haven't answered my question.
- What question?

617
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:19,797
- Who does she belong to?
- Oh, Indian!

618
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:24,722
If you need anything, holler.
I'll leave my door open.

619
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,200
Sean.

620
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,277
What about rhino?

621
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:33,519
They say there's plenty of them
around Longido.

622
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:36,804
- Don't do it.
- Why?

623
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:39,561
Let 'em alone.

624
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:43,766
First, it was that Belgian kid.
Then Brandy's father and then me.

625
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:47,442
- This was pretty close.
- Too close.

626
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:52,158
I'm beginning to think
we got the jinx on us about rhino.

627
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:58,116
- That's just because you got horned.
- No, it isn't.

628
00:59:58,287 --> 01:00:01,165
Sure, I'm scared of 'em.
So is anybody with any sense.

629
01:00:01,327 --> 01:00:02,806
You're right, there.

630
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:06,164
So just for this season,
let 'em alone.

631
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:12,844
Well, we'll wait
till we fill the other orders and then...

632
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:17,239
Don't lose any sleep over it
for a while. Goodnight.

633
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:20,403
'Night.

634
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:08,077
You didn't waste any time,
giving the Frenchman competition.

635
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:12,559
Competition? She was kissing
Uncle Kurt for giving her a present.

636
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:15,525
Has she thanked Uncle Kurt
that way before?

637
01:01:15,687 --> 01:01:19,475
- No, she hasn't.
- Some present! What was it?

638
01:01:19,647 --> 01:01:22,764
Oh, nothing.
One of those things women wear,

639
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:27,079
with laces on it
and some stuff around...

640
01:01:27,247 --> 01:01:29,920
What business is it of yours?

641
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:35,081
The Frenchman was watching.
You got him worried, anyway.

642
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:35,922
- What's next?
- I was thinking of buffalo.

643
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:39,716
Got an order for three.
A male and a pair of young ones.

644
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:43,516
Semanjaro might be good.
I hear they are moving through there.

645
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:45,405
Could be all right.

646
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:48,764
Semanjaro's good country
for a lot of stuff we need.

647
01:02:48,927 --> 01:02:51,316
Ought to be good, because it's so dry.

648
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:55,400
- Indian, do you like travelling?
- Sure, if I don't have to walk.

649
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:58,400
Tell Arga to get the stuff ready.
We'll go tomorrow.

650
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,764
- Enough for four or five days?
- That ought to do it.

651
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:03,838
Dallas, no trunk.

652
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:09,206
While I'm thinking about it,
no red shirt like you had on the first day.

653
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:11,756
Why?

654
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:16,364
Some people say animals
are colour-blind, but I don't agree.

655
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:20,202
- I had a bull chase me once.
- Really?

656
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,359
Sure it wasn't the other way round?

657
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:58,597
- Hi, Stan.
- How are you? Good?

658
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:00,166
Hello, Stan.

659
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:03,364
- What happened?
- She was a wild one, a real rogue.

660
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:05,677
Nearly killed a native three nights ago.

661
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:08,281
You can see what she started last night.

662
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,325
The family got out in time.
I had to shoot her.

663
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:13,876
- Can we help?
- Have you a radio set?

664
01:04:14,047 --> 01:04:18,484
Could you tell headquarters
I'll stand by until they arrive?

665
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,605
- Sure.
- Thank you.

666
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:27,082
A calf. Did you know she had a calf?

667
01:04:27,247 --> 01:04:29,522
- Not until now.
- Poor baby.

668
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:32,155
That's too bad.

669
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,838
What?

670
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:40,603
Dallas! Watch out!

671
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:43,520
- That thing can hurt you.
- He's not afraid.

672
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:46,599
You ought to be afraid of him.

673
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,964
Well, Stan. It's up to you.
I don't envy you your job.

674
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:53,358
We'll go on ahead.
I'll get your message to headquarters.

675
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:56,963
- Come, Dallas.
- Let's get out of here.

676
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,517
- I don't want to watch it.
- Watch what?

677
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:04,600
- It's the only way.
- What are you talking about?

678
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,759
That poor little fellow
hasn't been weaned yet.

679
01:05:07,927 --> 01:05:10,202
He's hungry, that's why he isn't afraid.

680
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:13,200
In a couple of days, with no food,
he won't make it.

681
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:16,564
Lions and hyenas...
Better to get it over quick.

682
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:20,845
- You're going to shoot him?
- I'm not, Stan's the game ranger.

683
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:23,475
- That's my job.
- It's not a nice job.

684
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,558
- Come on, Dallas.
- I won't come!

685
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:30,084
I won't come unless you take him.
He's small, we've got plenty of room.

686
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:33,478
- How will you feed him?
- We'll find a way.

687
01:05:33,647 --> 01:05:37,083
If he's hungry, he'll eat. Shoot him
and you'll have to shoot me, too.

688
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:39,078
Don't tempt me!

689
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:42,125
You know, Sean,
there are lots of goats around here.

690
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:45,006
- Goats!
- Goat milk is very nourishing.

691
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,682
- You see!
- How many goats to fill him up?

692
01:05:48,847 --> 01:05:52,157
- What's a few goats?
- How will you get the milk into him?

693
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,158
Posho would be good.

694
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:57,444
- Mealie flour with milk.
- Like baby formula.

695
01:05:57,607 --> 01:06:01,646
What are you grinning about?
Put your two cents' worth in, Indian.

696
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:04,958
- I was thinking...
- He's thinking you're gonna lose.

697
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,836
- I am, am I? And you're all for it?
- That's it, bwana.

698
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,238
Fine. You go get the goats,
I'll go ahead and make camp.

699
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:16,798
All you have to do is get the goats
and an elephant into the cars.

700
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:20,846
In your spare time, figure how to get
the milk into the elephant.

701
01:06:21,007 --> 01:06:25,558
I'm going on to camp.
See you there, if you ever make it.

702
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:30,443
Well? What do we do?

703
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:36,364
First, we take up a collection for
the United Elephant Fund: $2 each.

704
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:41,442
I'll negotiate for the goats
while you get 'em all in the cars.

705
01:06:41,607 --> 01:06:45,805
That's it! That's it!
Everybody contributes. See you later.

706
01:07:19,407 --> 01:07:23,082
- You missed a lot of fun.
- Getting the elephant into the car?

707
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,807
That was easy.
Trouble was with the goats.

708
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:29,357
- Elephants and goats don't mix.
- How about the elephant?

709
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:32,439
Dallas climbed into the car
and he followed. Look.

710
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:34,404
Come, Tembo!

711
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:37,035
Take him out of here
while we get some milk.

712
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:38,799
He's getting hungry.

713
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:42,403
Brandy, find me some pails
to put some milk in, ja?

714
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:44,000
OK, Kurt.

715
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:47,284
Well, boys. Let's unload the goats.

716
01:07:58,687 --> 01:08:00,803
Hey! Get them, boys!

717
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:03,083
I'll get this one right here!

718
01:08:03,687 --> 01:08:06,599
Tembo! Come back!

719
01:08:11,607 --> 01:08:13,962
Now, get him over here.

720
01:08:15,927 --> 01:08:18,760
Come on. Get him out of here!

721
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:25,886
Think this is a mess?
Wait till they milk 'em!

722
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:28,277
It won't be easy!

723
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,917
Quiet, Tembo.

724
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:47,404
- Pockets! What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to milk this goat.

725
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:51,446
That's the wrong kind of goat. It's a ram!

726
01:08:56,127 --> 01:08:59,358
Come on, I'll show you. Turn around.

727
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:12,284
- That's the way you do it?
- That's the way.

728
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:18,520
Quiet, Tembo.
They're getting the milk for you.

729
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:35,597
Now, hold it quiet, so I can...

730
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:39,727
Stand still, baby. Good...

731
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:45,516
- That doesn't get us anywhere.
- We are just wasting milk.

732
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:48,565
- A goat only gives so much a day.
- He must eat!

733
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:52,606
Don't look at me!
Feeding him is up to you people.

734
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,803
So start thinking.

735
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:59,165
Wait, if we take a radiator hose
and shove it down...

736
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:03,924
...take a radiator hose
and shove it down his throat.

737
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:06,760
- Then pour the milk in?
- You'll strangle him.

738
01:10:06,927 --> 01:10:09,725
Maybe if we cut a hole
in the bottom of a bucket.

739
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,401
Yeah, but it's still...

740
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:15,283
Oh, shut up!

741
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:17,961
He still has to swallow,
now he just chokes.

742
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:20,846
I seem to remember you started all this.

743
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:22,281
- Me?
- Yeah.

744
01:10:22,447 --> 01:10:26,963
- You're confused. I just went along.
- Well, think of something!

745
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:30,961
I'm trying. If he'd shut up for a minute,
I might be able to...

746
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:33,687
Hey, he's not yelling.

747
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:37,321
That's the way, Tembo. Easy!

748
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:40,524
Yes. Oh, that's good!

749
01:10:40,687 --> 01:10:42,598
Wonderful!

750
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:45,156
Yes, Tembo. Here!

751
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:48,755
Yes... No, stop it.

752
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:50,997
That's good!

753
01:10:51,927 --> 01:10:54,999
It's easy. I just thought,
"How do you feed a baby?"

754
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:59,160
They never begin by pouring stuff
into them out of a bucket.

755
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,397
Here! Here, Tembo.

756
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:03,364
Oh, that's nice!

757
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:11,639
We ought to try Longido.

758
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:15,083
Seven Sisters is on the way.
We might find them there.

759
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:16,965
- Hi, Brandy.
- Hi.

760
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:20,676
Come on. Let's see
which one has to go to work.

761
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:26,922
Go on, Chips. Take a straw.

762
01:11:27,087 --> 01:11:29,806
I don't understand. What is this for?

763
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:33,198
Oh, I forgot.
I'm going to the river to take a bath.

764
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:35,722
I can't carry a gun
and take a bath, too,

765
01:11:35,887 --> 01:11:40,358
so someone has to come with me -
whoever gets the short straw!

766
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:43,325
- Not with this leg, Brandy.
- OK.

767
01:11:43,487 --> 01:11:47,162
We've been doing this
since she's been this high.

768
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:51,081
- I have the short straw, Brandy.
- Let's go.

769
01:12:00,367 --> 01:12:02,483
Sean, tell me something.

770
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:06,356
When we all drew straws
to see who'd go with Brandy,

771
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:08,643
you didn't have a short straw.

772
01:12:08,807 --> 01:12:10,684
- I know it.
- Why did you say you did?

773
01:12:10,847 --> 01:12:16,444
Didn't you tell me you'd discovered
that Brandy was all grown up?

774
01:12:16,607 --> 01:12:20,646
That Frenchman doesn't look at her
like she's a schoolgirl.

775
01:12:20,807 --> 01:12:23,958
- And I'm not so sure about Pockets.
- Three of us.

776
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:29,326
So I figured I'd better be the one.
I still think of her as a kid.

777
01:12:29,487 --> 01:12:31,443
All right, Papa.

778
01:12:32,527 --> 01:12:35,485
Can I give you a little warning?

779
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:40,038
It isn't exactly a fatherly gleam
in your eye when you look at Dallas.

780
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:43,404
- Oh, stop it!
- Don't act innocent with me.

781
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:48,925
Do you want me to answer this letter
from the San Diego zoo?

782
01:12:49,087 --> 01:12:51,078
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?

783
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:53,636
Answer the letter
from the San Diego zoo.

784
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,718
Oh, sure!

785
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:03,563
I've run out of cigarettes.
I'll get some in my tent.

786
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:08,686
- Hey, Pockets!
- Hi!

787
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:15,485
- I thought you'd turned in.
- Got a minute?

788
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:19,925
Did Sean have anything more to say
about the baby elephant?

789
01:13:20,087 --> 01:13:23,875
He didn't want to see it shot
any more than you did.

790
01:13:24,047 --> 01:13:26,720
- Where is it?
- It's a he, Pockets.

791
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:29,321
I've been mixed up once before today.

792
01:13:29,487 --> 01:13:33,560
He's tied up over there,
under the trees. He's asleep.

793
01:13:33,727 --> 01:13:37,003
Don't miss his two o'clock feeding.
He'll start squalling.

794
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,078
Sean wouldn't like that!

795
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:42,364
And you can't walk the floor
with him, either!

796
01:13:42,527 --> 01:13:45,963
By the way, how are you doing
with the big bwana?

797
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:50,598
I don't know. You heard him today.
He would like to shoot me, he said.

798
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:53,440
I know. I thought it was a good sign.

799
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:58,601
Good sign! If he really
gets to like me, I'm in danger!

800
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:06,836
Remember, he won't start anything.
You're gonna have to do it! Ciao!

801
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:08,599
Ciao.

802
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:13,958
Well...

803
01:14:14,127 --> 01:14:16,960
Now is as good a time as any!

804
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:19,958
All right, see you in the morning.

805
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:21,799
- Hi, Kurt.
- 'Night, Dallas.

806
01:14:21,967 --> 01:14:24,003
Watch it, Papa.

807
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:27,606
- Hi, Sean.
- Hello, Dallas.

808
01:14:28,647 --> 01:14:32,162
I wanted to thank you
for letting me keep the elephant.

809
01:14:32,327 --> 01:14:36,843
Why me? There were a lot of other
people on your side. Thank them.

810
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:41,364
Well, I'm sorry there was
so much trouble about the goats and...

811
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:43,279
That couldn't be helped.

812
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:47,235
Pockets trying to milk that ram
made it worthwhile!

813
01:14:47,407 --> 01:14:50,843
- Dallas, will you have a drink?
- No, thank you.

814
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,475
This is the first time
you've been nice to me.

815
01:14:53,647 --> 01:14:56,207
I was almost afraid to come in here.

816
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,120
Well, why did you come?

817
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:04,480
- I wanted to ask you a question.
- Go ahead.

818
01:15:08,047 --> 01:15:09,639
Sean...

819
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:13,482
- How do you like to kiss?
- How do I like to kiss?

820
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:17,162
- That's what I said.
- What are you talking about?

821
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:22,481
The kiss. You know the kiss.
How do you like it? Slow? Quick?

822
01:15:22,647 --> 01:15:25,844
Do you like to kiss the girl,
or the girl to kiss you?

823
01:15:26,007 --> 01:15:27,645
- That's silly!
- Silly?

824
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:30,844
I ask how you like to kiss,
and you say it's silly?

825
01:15:31,007 --> 01:15:34,158
- Have you never been kissed before?
- Of course I have.

826
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:36,318
Then why do you say it's silly?

827
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:39,365
It's silly to stand here and talk about it.

828
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:44,078
Of course it's silly to talk about it.
Let's do it. I'll show you.

829
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:45,566
You like this?

830
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:50,084
- There's a lot of people...
- Or slow, like this?

831
01:15:55,927 --> 01:16:00,079
I think you like slow better.
Wanna try again to make sure?

832
01:16:00,247 --> 01:16:04,001
Dallas, I've taken
about all of this I'm gonna take.

833
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:07,159
What are you going to do?

834
01:16:11,327 --> 01:16:15,286
Sean, I was... I beg your pardon.

835
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:20,043
We ought to be in a railroad station,
then more people could come in.

836
01:16:20,207 --> 01:16:24,120
- Sorry. I broke something up, didn't I?
- You managed. What do you want?

837
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:28,565
I was talking to Saidi.
He saw leopard tracks by the river.

838
01:16:28,727 --> 01:16:31,400
- Big?
- You know the boys.

839
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:36,197
- It's the next thing to an elephant.
- We need a big one.

840
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:40,838
Well, I suppose
we'd better go talk to him.

841
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:45,803
- I'm sorry, Dallas.
- It's all right.

842
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:49,755
I mean...
Dallas, just out of curiosity...

843
01:16:49,927 --> 01:16:54,284
- How did you get him started?
- I asked him how he liked to kiss.

844
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:58,201
- You just asked him...
... how he likes to kiss.

845
01:16:58,367 --> 01:17:01,598
And you were just finding out when I...

846
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,961
If I ever get a problem,
may I come to you?

847
01:17:05,127 --> 01:17:07,687
- Pockets!
- Yes, bwana.

848
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:05,041
Bring him in a little!

849
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:14,004
Watch it, Pockets!

850
01:19:55,247 --> 01:19:59,035
- Bring us another head rope!
- All right!

851
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:05,687
Look out, he's loose!

852
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:13,877
All right, let's go! Don't lose me!

853
01:20:41,007 --> 01:20:43,521
Our insurance rate just went up.

854
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:57,445
Drop that thing off of there!
Don't give him time to rest!

855
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:01,442
Lay it on! Over here!

856
01:21:09,687 --> 01:21:12,440
Take the door, Kurt.

857
01:21:22,567 --> 01:21:25,035
- All right, turn him loose!
- He's loose!

858
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:27,198
Take it off.

859
01:21:34,647 --> 01:21:37,400
He's caught. Keep the rope tight.

860
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:48,805
Push him from behind, Luis.

861
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,441
All set.

862
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,277
The easiest one we ever got.

863
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:29,482
Well, we're stuck.

864
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:39,479
- I'll take the cable over.
- OK.

865
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:11,483
Look out, Kurt!

866
01:23:19,407 --> 01:23:20,999
Thank you!

867
01:23:23,407 --> 01:23:26,399
All right, Pockets. Take her away!

868
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:39,403
You know, this afternoon...

869
01:23:39,567 --> 01:23:43,082
I don't like crocodiles,
especially when I'm in the water.

870
01:23:43,247 --> 01:23:45,966
Anyway... Thanks again.

871
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:49,483
- A la tienne, mon pote.
- Prost!

872
01:23:49,647 --> 01:23:53,322
I need some help.
The baby leopard is not eating good.

873
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,001
I'll get some milk and eggs.

874
01:24:01,087 --> 01:24:04,682
Our girl looks pretty good tonight.

875
01:24:04,847 --> 01:24:07,839
I'll flip you to see who goes with her.

876
01:24:08,527 --> 01:24:12,281
Let's go together. I don't trust you.

877
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:15,439
Right, then give me my shilling back.

878
01:24:22,727 --> 01:24:25,844
- Kurt, come here a minute.
- What's up?

879
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:29,443
- Somebody left the ostrich pen open.
- Here we go again!

880
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,196
Why don't you catch him, Kurt?

881
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:16,159
I'd better let the boys do it.

882
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:28,166
Hey! Let the females go! Keep the male.

883
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:32,002
The girls will come back
to the old man anyway.

884
01:26:17,647 --> 01:26:21,037
Hold still, baby... There it is.

885
01:26:22,047 --> 01:26:25,835
Pockets, got a pair of pliers?
He's got a thorn.

886
01:26:29,807 --> 01:26:32,275
Easy now, easy.

887
01:26:38,767 --> 01:26:40,598
She'll be better now.

888
01:26:43,527 --> 01:26:45,438
Come, baby.

889
01:26:50,447 --> 01:26:54,042
- Sean, look!
- What's all this?

890
01:26:54,207 --> 01:26:57,677
I was taking Tembo to the bath,
and I found this one.

891
01:26:57,847 --> 01:27:00,281
- Aren't they nice together?
- No.

892
01:27:00,447 --> 01:27:03,359
- They can play together.
- It takes 20 goats...

893
01:27:03,527 --> 01:27:05,597
Sean, don't speak...

894
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,600
- Listen first, don't speak!
- Why not?

895
01:27:08,767 --> 01:27:11,440
- Don't make a fool of yourself.
- I'm a fool?

896
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:15,680
- Not yet. Just if you don't listen.
- Well, I'm listening.

897
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:19,237
I hired an African boy.
He's going to buy more goats.

898
01:27:19,407 --> 01:27:24,003
He'll milk them and take care
of Tembo and his friend. No trouble.

899
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:26,681
- Aren't you glad you're not a fool?
- Dallas...

900
01:27:26,847 --> 01:27:28,678
Yes, Sean?

901
01:27:28,847 --> 01:27:30,439
Aw, hell!

902
01:27:31,407 --> 01:27:34,399
Come on, baby. Let's have a bath.

903
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:40,356
You certainly won that one, bwana.

904
01:27:40,527 --> 01:27:44,236
Some day, Pockets. Some day...

905
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:45,999
Here...

906
01:27:51,807 --> 01:27:53,399
It's good!

907
01:28:09,647 --> 01:28:11,877
Come, baby, come!

908
01:28:15,487 --> 01:28:17,796
- Take a look, bwana.
- What?

909
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:20,527
It's worth your while.

910
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:53,323
Funny how good she is with animals.

911
01:29:04,447 --> 01:29:07,245
She could even do it to me!

912
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:11,441
You could use it.

913
01:29:16,527 --> 01:29:18,916
OK. That's enough!

914
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:23,564
Come, baby!

915
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:11,921
- Hi, Pockets.
- Hi, Dallas.

916
01:30:12,087 --> 01:30:14,840
What are you doing out here,
all by yourself?

917
01:30:15,007 --> 01:30:16,360
I don't know...

918
01:30:16,527 --> 01:30:20,202
You said that if you had a problem,
you would come to me.

919
01:30:20,367 --> 01:30:23,598
- Have you got one now?
- A problem? What about?

920
01:30:23,767 --> 01:30:25,837
- Brandy?
- Brandy...

921
01:30:26,007 --> 01:30:27,884
Aren't you in love with her?

922
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:31,722
Are you nuts? Me in love with Brandy?
That's the most...

923
01:30:31,887 --> 01:30:34,765
- How did you know?
- The way you look at her.

924
01:30:34,927 --> 01:30:37,839
- A woman can tell.
- She can, huh?

925
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:40,043
Then why didn't she notice it?

926
01:30:40,207 --> 01:30:44,564
- Probably she has. How do you know?
- She never did anything about it.

927
01:30:44,727 --> 01:30:47,799
So, as you told me, you've got to do it.

928
01:30:47,967 --> 01:30:50,720
That's fine, but what do I do?

929
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:56,606
I can't ask her how she likes to kiss,
that's your stuff.

930
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,678
Dallas, what do I do?

931
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:01,839
Well... Did you ever dance with her?

932
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:06,443
- I don't remember.
- Do you know how to dance?

933
01:31:06,607 --> 01:31:08,518
- As well as they can?
- Easy!

934
01:31:08,687 --> 01:31:11,247
Come on, we'll show them!

935
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:35,316
I didn't know you could dance like that!

936
01:31:35,487 --> 01:31:37,796
Go ahead, Pockets. Show her!

937
01:32:16,007 --> 01:32:18,202
- Dallas?
- Yes?

938
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:22,201
- E occupata?
- Vengo!

939
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:28,477
- You've got visitors.
- Visitors?

940
01:32:28,647 --> 01:32:33,038
- From the village. Can't you hear?
- I wondered about the singing.

941
01:32:33,207 --> 01:32:35,960
They've made a song for you
and the elephants.

942
01:32:36,127 --> 01:32:39,722
Really! How nice!
I'll come in a moment.

943
01:32:51,407 --> 01:32:55,286
- What are they going to do?
- It's just a Warusha ceremony.

944
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:57,039
Hi, Sean.

945
01:33:41,167 --> 01:33:43,556
What's the matter?

946
01:33:45,367 --> 01:33:48,040
Sean, please help me! Sean!

947
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:03,281
We'd better go along and see
they don't get too enthusiastic.

948
01:34:23,327 --> 01:34:27,684
It's not funny. They want to
shave my hair and take my clothes off!

949
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:30,600
- There was a man there.
- He doesn't speak English!

950
01:34:30,767 --> 01:34:33,076
You're now a member
of the Warusha tribe.

951
01:34:33,247 --> 01:34:38,037
They've given you a name:
Mother of Elephants, Mama Tembo.

952
01:34:38,207 --> 01:34:41,085
You're supposed to dance with them.

953
01:34:55,927 --> 01:34:59,363
- Roast beef! My favourite!
- Everything's your favourite.

954
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:03,600
- Arga, have you some red wine?
- Beer for me, please.

955
01:35:03,767 --> 01:35:05,598
- Where's Mama Tembo?
- In her room.

956
01:35:05,767 --> 01:35:08,884
The new member of the Warusha
is not coming to dinner.

957
01:35:09,047 --> 01:35:12,517
She's been in the tub for hours,
scrubbing all the paint off.

958
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:16,646
- That stuff works like a dye.
- She says she has no skin left.

959
01:35:16,807 --> 01:35:19,719
It was mean not telling her
what she was getting into.

960
01:35:19,887 --> 01:35:23,197
- What do Italians like? Red wine?
- Any kind.

961
01:35:24,127 --> 01:35:28,405
- Get yourself another bottle.
- Arga! Another one.

962
01:35:34,287 --> 01:35:37,279
- Who is it?
- Sean. Are you decent?

963
01:35:37,447 --> 01:35:40,962
- No, don't come in, please!
- Cover up, I'm coming.

964
01:35:41,967 --> 01:35:44,561
Hello, Sonya. She's taken quite...

965
01:35:45,487 --> 01:35:49,116
- Oh, brother!
- You make me mad!

966
01:35:49,287 --> 01:35:53,883
When I look nice, you ignore me.
And now with this stuff on my face...

967
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:56,277
- You look all right.
- Oh, phooey!

968
01:35:56,447 --> 01:36:00,440
- All right, you look terrible.
- So why don't you go away?

969
01:36:00,607 --> 01:36:02,882
- How do you feel?
- I hurt.

970
01:36:03,047 --> 01:36:06,278
I scrubbed and scrubbed.
I almost took my skin off!

971
01:36:06,447 --> 01:36:09,757
- It gave you a good colour.
- How can you tell?

972
01:36:09,927 --> 01:36:13,158
- I brought you a drink.
- Why?

973
01:36:13,327 --> 01:36:16,399
Well, I don't know, the way you're acting.

974
01:36:16,567 --> 01:36:20,606
But you were great today.
It meant a lot to that Warusha tribe.

975
01:36:20,767 --> 01:36:24,362
Now they say Mama Tembo is rafiki,
which means friend.

976
01:36:24,527 --> 01:36:26,358
Thank you.

977
01:36:26,527 --> 01:36:29,325
And they also say that
you're mbali mbali.

978
01:36:29,487 --> 01:36:32,843
If that means "covered with
cold cream" they are right.

979
01:36:33,007 --> 01:36:36,761
- It means you're different.
- Yes, nice and greasy.

980
01:36:36,927 --> 01:36:40,283
- Quit squawking.
- Well, look at me!

981
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:42,358
I am.

982
01:36:42,527 --> 01:36:44,119
Come here!

983
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:50,643
You are a little slippery!
Wipe it off and we'll try again.

984
01:36:53,327 --> 01:36:56,046
- I'm sorry.
- Women and their contraptions!

985
01:36:56,207 --> 01:36:58,675
Now, you stop squawking.

986
01:37:01,447 --> 01:37:03,517
Come and get it!

987
01:37:08,567 --> 01:37:11,365
I brought you your dinner.

988
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:17,042
Now, Sean!

989
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,767
Sean, I didn't mean to do it!

990
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:49,121
Work 'em out onto the flats.

991
01:37:49,807 --> 01:37:52,446
Sean says move 'em out onto the flats.

992
01:37:52,607 --> 01:37:55,917
Make sure they know
that's where you want them.

993
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:48,885
- Let me know when you've picked one.
- I'm looking for one with blue eyes.

994
01:39:04,927 --> 01:39:07,600
To the right, that bunch over to the right.

995
01:39:07,767 --> 01:39:11,316
Where he goes, we go.

996
01:39:50,767 --> 01:39:52,723
Hang on!

997
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:06,762
Where are you hurt? Easy, take it easy.

998
01:40:07,887 --> 01:40:09,366
Shoulder?

999
01:40:12,727 --> 01:40:16,845
- Just a dislocated shoulder.
- Just dislocated, huh?

1000
01:40:17,007 --> 01:40:20,317
I think she's right.
Hold still, I'll fix it.

1001
01:40:21,767 --> 01:40:24,679
- Better?
- Yes, great.

1002
01:40:24,847 --> 01:40:27,520
Let me have some of this water.

1003
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:37,205
OK, Chip? OK?

1004
01:40:38,727 --> 01:40:40,558
My leg's hurt.

1005
01:40:40,727 --> 01:40:43,195
Pull him out of there.

1006
01:40:47,247 --> 01:40:49,636
Let's stand him up.

1007
01:40:50,607 --> 01:40:54,600
Put your weight on your leg.
Try. That's fine.

1008
01:40:56,447 --> 01:41:00,998
- It's not broken. It's all right.
- Get him out here and clean him up.

1009
01:41:01,967 --> 01:41:04,606
I'll take a look at this car.

1010
01:41:24,447 --> 01:41:28,918
Pretty lucky. We can tow this in
behind the green truck.

1011
01:41:44,527 --> 01:41:50,124
- We sure were lucky this afternoon.
- Yeah, when that car went over...

1012
01:41:50,287 --> 01:41:53,199
- Well, you never know, do you?
- Know what?

1013
01:41:53,367 --> 01:41:54,959
- Women.
- What?

1014
01:41:55,127 --> 01:41:57,766
- Or what they'll do.
- What do you mean?

1015
01:41:57,927 --> 01:41:59,997
Brandy! When the jeep flipped.

1016
01:42:00,167 --> 01:42:04,206
I'd have sworn she was in love
with one of those two Romeos.

1017
01:42:04,367 --> 01:42:08,280
- Well, isn't she?
- She sure didn't act like it.

1018
01:42:08,447 --> 01:42:13,123
I always thought... She didn't act
like she was in love, did she?

1019
01:42:13,287 --> 01:42:18,281
- Not to my way of thinking.
- Nor to mine, either.

1020
01:42:43,607 --> 01:42:46,917
- Rough trip?
- We never missed a bump.

1021
01:42:47,087 --> 01:42:49,760
- What happened?
- They flipped the herding car.

1022
01:42:49,927 --> 01:42:51,679
- Did they wreck it?
- It's OK.

1023
01:42:51,847 --> 01:42:54,202
They're going to be OK, too.
Need any help?

1024
01:42:54,367 --> 01:42:56,881
- We'll get cleaned up.
- I need a drink.

1025
01:42:57,047 --> 01:42:58,844
Let's get unloaded.

1026
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:02,079
Pockets, give us a hand
with the wildebeest.

1027
01:43:02,247 --> 01:43:06,240
You know animals don't like me.
I won't be any good to you.

1028
01:43:06,407 --> 01:43:08,557
- You can get in their way.
- Sean!

1029
01:43:08,727 --> 01:43:13,243
You told me I wasn't
going to fuss with the animals!

1030
01:43:16,887 --> 01:43:18,843
All right, Sean.

1031
01:43:19,007 --> 01:43:20,838
He's hooked.

1032
01:43:21,007 --> 01:43:22,884
Here, Pockets, take this line...

1033
01:43:23,607 --> 01:43:26,121
What are you doing up there?

1034
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:29,643
If he were up here, I'd be down there.

1035
01:43:29,807 --> 01:43:33,356
Take this line.
Pull him out when we open this door.

1036
01:43:33,527 --> 01:43:38,521
And keep the slack out of it,
so he won't get hurt.

1037
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:02,287
Ready, Pockets? Watch out!
Don't fall in with those buffalo!

1038
01:44:02,447 --> 01:44:05,245
Thanks for the advice, Sean!

1039
01:44:21,567 --> 01:44:23,922
Pockets, darling!

1040
01:44:24,087 --> 01:44:25,725
Are you all right?

1041
01:44:25,887 --> 01:44:30,324
Speak to me please, darling.
Poor sweet baby!

1042
01:44:30,487 --> 01:44:34,036
- Pockets! Do something, Sean!
- What's the matter with him?

1043
01:44:34,207 --> 01:44:37,517
He's hurt. He doesn't speak,
he doesn't hear me.

1044
01:44:37,687 --> 01:44:40,485
Pockets, darling, please speak to me.

1045
01:44:41,767 --> 01:44:44,679
- Hello, Brandy.
- Are you all right?

1046
01:44:44,847 --> 01:44:46,439
I think so...

1047
01:44:47,567 --> 01:44:52,595
- No, you're not. You just say you are.
- Let me rest here a minute.

1048
01:44:52,767 --> 01:44:55,281
Sean, we have to get him into the house.

1049
01:44:55,447 --> 01:44:59,076
- I think you're right.
- Lift him carefully.

1050
01:44:59,247 --> 01:45:02,284
- Pockets, you'll be all right.
- It's nothing...

1051
01:45:02,447 --> 01:45:06,360
- What are you trying to do?
- I don't know, but I'm doing it right!

1052
01:45:06,527 --> 01:45:09,041
Shall I give you a hot bath?

1053
01:45:09,207 --> 01:45:12,438
Oh, no, Brandy... A hot bath?

1054
01:45:12,607 --> 01:45:16,236
- You just get his bed ready.
- Right away.

1055
01:45:17,087 --> 01:45:19,078
- Now?
- Now.

1056
01:45:26,607 --> 01:45:28,837
Thanks for coming in to patch us up.

1057
01:45:29,007 --> 01:45:31,999
- You'll make it.
- Dallas did a good job.

1058
01:45:32,167 --> 01:45:34,601
- How's the leg?
- A drink would help it.

1059
01:45:34,767 --> 01:45:37,884
- There's no ice. Arga!
- You're wasting your breath.

1060
01:45:38,047 --> 01:45:40,242
- Why?
- There isn't any ice.

1061
01:45:40,407 --> 01:45:42,967
- Why?
- They'll know sooner or later.

1062
01:45:43,127 --> 01:45:45,800
- Might as well be now.
- What do you mean?

1063
01:45:45,967 --> 01:45:49,243
If you want the ice,
look in Brandy's room.

1064
01:45:49,407 --> 01:45:52,399
Go ahead! Take a look, both of you.

1065
01:45:54,487 --> 01:45:56,876
All right, we'll humour you.

1066
01:45:57,847 --> 01:46:01,999
- I think you're mean.
- They'll live through it.

1067
01:46:19,167 --> 01:46:23,240
- How do you feel now, darling?
- Wonderful, Brandy.

1068
01:46:23,407 --> 01:46:26,524
I was so frightened
when you fell off that fence.

1069
01:46:29,167 --> 01:46:31,727
He fell off a fence.

1070
01:46:32,767 --> 01:46:36,999
You nearly took a leg off,
I got a dislocated shoulder...

1071
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:40,443
- And he gets the ice.
- Yeah.

1072
01:46:41,487 --> 01:46:44,479
Come on, I'll buy you a nice warm drink.

1073
01:47:02,127 --> 01:47:06,279
How did you get outside?
You bad boy!

1074
01:47:06,447 --> 01:47:08,438
Come back in, come on!

1075
01:47:11,487 --> 01:47:14,797
Oh, no! Three!

1076
01:47:14,967 --> 01:47:18,596
What would Sean say? I can't tell him.

1077
01:47:18,767 --> 01:47:21,520
- Tell him what?
- This one.

1078
01:47:21,687 --> 01:47:23,598
What's so unusual?

1079
01:47:23,767 --> 01:47:27,282
No... No! How did this happen?

1080
01:47:27,447 --> 01:47:29,722
It must have happened
when I was asleep!

1081
01:47:29,887 --> 01:47:32,003
- What do we do?
- How should I know?

1082
01:47:32,167 --> 01:47:35,159
By gosh, we got another one.

1083
01:47:36,087 --> 01:47:38,442
We're running an elephant nursery.

1084
01:47:38,607 --> 01:47:40,040
Mother!

1085
01:47:40,207 --> 01:47:42,767
That means that he can stay.

1086
01:47:44,047 --> 01:47:46,720
Well... You won another one!

1087
01:47:46,887 --> 01:47:49,242
Come on, baby. Let's go!

1088
01:47:52,527 --> 01:47:54,643
Come, baby, come!

1089
01:47:57,767 --> 01:47:59,758
Come in, don't be afraid!

1090
01:48:02,367 --> 01:48:06,326
Have you fellows any idea
what Pockets is doing in the workshop?

1091
01:48:06,487 --> 01:48:11,083
He won't let anybody in, he says
you promised him not to interfere.

1092
01:48:11,247 --> 01:48:15,286
- Another invention.
- Something for catching monkeys.

1093
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:18,519
You know what he's been buying
to catch monkeys?

1094
01:48:18,687 --> 01:48:21,804
Listen:
"840 feet of three-eighths nylon rope,

1095
01:48:21,967 --> 01:48:24,640
"260 feet of one-eighth airplane cable,

1096
01:48:24,807 --> 01:48:27,401
"80 feet of one-and-a-half
OD aluminium tubing,

1097
01:48:27,567 --> 01:48:30,001
"1,200 square yards
of nylon fish net... "

1098
01:48:30,167 --> 01:48:34,957
Fish net? Must be planning
to run them into the river to catch them.

1099
01:48:35,127 --> 01:48:39,837
Just listen to this:
"100 Ibs black powder.

1100
01:48:40,007 --> 01:48:42,441
- "Twenty war-surplus rockets... "
- What!

1101
01:48:42,607 --> 01:48:45,167
For throwing ropes from ship to ship.

1102
01:48:45,327 --> 01:48:50,401
Then four firing switches "to be used
in missiles for second-stage boost".

1103
01:48:50,567 --> 01:48:51,886
Holy smoke!

1104
01:48:52,047 --> 01:48:54,481
Is he catching monkeys
or launching them?

1105
01:48:54,647 --> 01:48:57,957
We'd better have a little talk
with this gentleman.

1106
01:49:01,127 --> 01:49:04,119
Sean, I'd put out that cigarette.

1107
01:49:08,327 --> 01:49:12,320
- Hatari! Hatari!
- What are you talking about?

1108
01:49:17,287 --> 01:49:22,042
You're washed up!
Come on and get that hose!

1109
01:49:22,207 --> 01:49:25,483
Turn on the water. Come on, full force!

1110
01:49:25,647 --> 01:49:28,798
No! Don't put water on it!
You'll spoil everything.

1111
01:49:28,967 --> 01:49:31,640
- The place is on fire!
- What fire?

1112
01:49:31,807 --> 01:49:33,877
- It's just powder, it'll clear.
- Powder?

1113
01:49:34,047 --> 01:49:36,322
I thought you were trying
to catch monkeys.

1114
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:39,524
That's what I'm doing.
See, the smoke's clearing.

1115
01:49:39,687 --> 01:49:42,485
- What are you doing?
- Wait!

1116
01:49:42,647 --> 01:49:46,435
- You said you'd leave me alone.
- I didn't expect Cape Canaveral!

1117
01:49:46,607 --> 01:49:50,282
You promised.
This place is restricted, off limits.

1118
01:49:50,447 --> 01:49:53,325
- You did promise.
- Yes, I promised.

1119
01:49:53,487 --> 01:49:55,000
Are you gonna break your promise?

1120
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:59,126
Did you set that thing off
or did it go off by itself?

1121
01:49:59,287 --> 01:50:01,164
Did I?

1122
01:50:01,327 --> 01:50:04,080
Well, what happened, Sean, was...
You see...

1123
01:50:04,247 --> 01:50:07,398
- What?
- Well, I've heard...

1124
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:10,923
I didn't feel that... You promised!

1125
01:50:13,087 --> 01:50:15,521
Get the roof fixed!

1126
01:50:39,127 --> 01:50:40,560
- Hi, Brandy.
- Hi, sweetie.

1127
01:50:40,727 --> 01:50:43,400
- What'll you have?
- Beer, if it's cold.

1128
01:50:43,567 --> 01:50:46,604
- How's that invention coming along?
- Fine!

1129
01:50:46,767 --> 01:50:49,804
How are you going to catch monkeys
with a rocket?

1130
01:50:49,967 --> 01:50:53,084
He's going to scare 'em
half to death, like he did me.

1131
01:50:53,247 --> 01:50:57,320
When they faint, we pick them up
on stretchers and carry them away.

1132
01:50:57,487 --> 01:51:01,002
- OK!
- How can you catch them with a net?

1133
01:51:01,167 --> 01:51:04,045
Look, I'm not going
to catch the monkeys.

1134
01:51:04,207 --> 01:51:07,882
I'm gonna get 500 monkeys
under that net for you to catch.

1135
01:51:08,047 --> 01:51:10,800
Some of them have got teeth
about an inch long.

1136
01:51:10,967 --> 01:51:14,004
- I've seen bigger.
- An inch and a half.

1137
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:17,318
If I were you, I'd get some armour
to stop those monkeys

1138
01:51:17,487 --> 01:51:21,116
sinking their teeth
into some part of my anatomy.

1139
01:51:21,287 --> 01:51:22,925
I'll be ready in a few days.

1140
01:51:23,087 --> 01:51:26,443
If you don't think
the invention will work, forget it.

1141
01:51:26,607 --> 01:51:31,397
Forget that monkeys
have teeth this long, just don't bother.

1142
01:51:31,567 --> 01:51:36,357
- Goodnight, Pockets.
- Goodnight, Brandy. Folks. Rest well.

1143
01:51:39,287 --> 01:51:42,484
You don't suppose, by any chance...

1144
01:51:42,647 --> 01:51:46,117
Problem is, you can't depend on Pockets.
It might work.

1145
01:51:46,287 --> 01:51:47,879
What a thing to say!

1146
01:51:48,047 --> 01:51:50,607
I'm not going to get my ears bitten off...

1147
01:51:50,767 --> 01:51:54,077
- We'd better get busy.
- Let's have a look.

1148
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:06,838
Hi.

1149
01:52:07,007 --> 01:52:10,886
Holy Muckya!
You look like a gasoline pump!

1150
01:52:11,047 --> 01:52:14,198
- Can you bend down in that thing?
- Sure.

1151
01:52:14,367 --> 01:52:16,437
Move around?

1152
01:52:19,367 --> 01:52:21,483
The man from Mars.

1153
01:52:21,647 --> 01:52:23,842
Take me to your leader!

1154
01:52:24,007 --> 01:52:26,999
Give me a hand with this, Dallas.

1155
01:52:30,767 --> 01:52:36,364
- Do you want your door closed?
- No, I can't breathe.

1156
01:53:10,927 --> 01:53:13,919
There's more over here! Back! Back!

1157
01:53:19,887 --> 01:53:21,957
Up, up you little devils!

1158
01:53:22,887 --> 01:53:25,447
All we need is about 200 more.

1159
01:53:48,167 --> 01:53:52,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1160
01:53:52,207 --> 01:53:53,640
Thank you.

1161
01:53:53,807 --> 01:53:57,436
Three miles down the road,
past that little duka, is a tree.

1162
01:53:57,607 --> 01:53:59,996
There are lots of monkeys in that tree.

1163
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:03,921
At 6.30 tomorrow morning,
I'll be ready to throw a net over them.

1164
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:09,002
- The rest, my friends, is up to you.
- You got them up that tree?

1165
01:54:09,167 --> 01:54:10,885
- Yes.
- How?

1166
01:54:11,047 --> 01:54:15,120
The Warushas were helpful. I gave
them two cartons of your cigarettes.

1167
01:54:15,287 --> 01:54:19,075
That was very generous of you.
I hope they pleased them.

1168
01:54:19,247 --> 01:54:21,522
They would have liked filter tips...

1169
01:54:21,687 --> 01:54:24,838
What makes you think
the monkeys will be there tomorrow?

1170
01:54:25,007 --> 01:54:30,400
I tied Rover and Cyclone under
the tree, barking nicely when I left.

1171
01:54:30,567 --> 01:54:33,127
Have you got your armour ready,
King Arthur?

1172
01:54:33,287 --> 01:54:36,643
Sir Galahad? Black Knight, Red Knight?

1173
01:54:36,807 --> 01:54:38,718
And goodnight.

1174
01:54:39,727 --> 01:54:43,720
- Sleep tight.
- Thank you. You too... You'll need it!

1175
01:55:16,127 --> 01:55:18,766
- Rockets for Pockets.
- Everybody ready?

1176
01:55:18,927 --> 01:55:20,679
You think this'll work?

1177
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:23,839
I've worked hard on this
and I'm a little nervous.

1178
01:55:24,007 --> 01:55:25,406
I understand.

1179
01:55:25,567 --> 01:55:30,083
I'm going to shoot the net over the tree.
There are at least 500 monkeys there.

1180
01:55:30,247 --> 01:55:34,160
You worry about the monkeys, OK?
I'll be watching you.

1181
01:55:34,327 --> 01:55:36,204
- The tree's over there.
- Sure.

1182
01:55:36,367 --> 01:55:39,677
The rocket's pointing away from it. Why?

1183
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:41,803
I read books.

1184
01:55:41,967 --> 01:55:45,562
Vectors, trajectors,
centrifugal forces and stuff.

1185
01:55:45,727 --> 01:55:47,604
- You know what they are?
- No.

1186
01:55:47,767 --> 01:55:50,759
So you wouldn't understand
why it points that way.

1187
01:55:50,927 --> 01:55:53,282
But do you know?

1188
01:55:53,447 --> 01:55:57,201
I suggest you get behind that tree.
I'm about to light this thing.

1189
01:55:57,367 --> 01:56:00,279
I'm about to get behind a tree.

1190
01:56:00,447 --> 01:56:03,359
When the net is over the tree,
get in there fast,

1191
01:56:03,527 --> 01:56:06,325
and get those monkeys
before they get away.

1192
01:57:06,447 --> 01:57:09,245
It worked! Pockets, it worked!

1193
01:57:10,927 --> 01:57:14,761
- It did?
- All right, Luis. Get the cage truck.

1194
01:57:14,927 --> 01:57:16,918
Let's go get 'em!

1195
01:57:18,487 --> 01:57:19,966
It worked...!

1196
01:57:20,127 --> 01:57:21,879
It worked!

1197
01:57:26,807 --> 01:57:29,196
Timber!

1198
01:57:32,247 --> 01:57:35,478
Go get the monkeys! Come on!

1199
01:57:54,127 --> 01:57:57,563
- We're going great. Another box!
- We?

1200
01:58:01,447 --> 01:58:04,007
That's good! Get another cage!

1201
01:58:06,567 --> 01:58:09,127
OK, put 'em in. That's good.

1202
01:58:21,207 --> 01:58:23,880
OK, put 'em in. That's good.

1203
01:58:38,247 --> 01:58:42,001
Here comes Pockets. We'll have
to tell him again about the rocket.

1204
01:58:42,167 --> 01:58:45,045
Well, he earned it.

1205
01:58:46,687 --> 01:58:50,282
- Sean?
- Yes, Pockets.

1206
01:58:50,447 --> 01:58:53,086
Sean, the rocket was all right, wasn't it?

1207
01:58:53,247 --> 01:58:57,320
As I said, nobody can ever say
your inventions don't work.

1208
01:58:57,487 --> 01:59:00,160
Thank you, Sean.

1209
01:59:00,327 --> 01:59:03,444
I didn't see it. I was behind a tree.

1210
01:59:03,607 --> 01:59:07,361
- I had my hands over my eyes!
- I know.

1211
01:59:07,527 --> 01:59:09,722
- Tell me about it.
- He has, twice.

1212
01:59:09,887 --> 01:59:11,605
Tell me again, Sean!

1213
01:59:11,767 --> 01:59:15,282
The rocket went up,
just like you said it'd go.

1214
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:18,166
Went over that tree
and took the net with it.

1215
01:59:18,327 --> 01:59:21,399
- Just like you said it would.
- Just like I said.

1216
01:59:21,567 --> 01:59:23,637
Did the monkeys get away, Sean?

1217
01:59:23,807 --> 01:59:27,959
- We got close to 500 of 'em caged.
- $6,000 dollars' worth.

1218
01:59:28,127 --> 01:59:30,277
Tell me about the smoke.

1219
01:59:30,447 --> 01:59:34,406
Well, I... Actually,
Kurt could see that better than I.

1220
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:37,764
- What?
- Go on, tell him.

1221
01:59:37,927 --> 01:59:41,920
Well, there it was,
the great silver rocket...

1222
01:59:42,087 --> 01:59:43,725
It was red and blue!

1223
01:59:43,887 --> 01:59:47,516
The great red and blue
silver rocket, leaving a white trail...

1224
01:59:47,687 --> 01:59:49,643
...against the blue sky.

1225
01:59:49,807 --> 01:59:52,685
You never said that.
It must have been beautiful.

1226
01:59:52,847 --> 01:59:54,280
It was.

1227
01:59:54,447 --> 01:59:57,007
Sean, tell me again about the rocket.

1228
01:59:57,167 --> 02:00:00,000
It went just like you said it would. Gin!

1229
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:03,284
I had my hands over my eyes.

1230
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:06,917
- It's too bad you didn't see it.
- Tell me!

1231
02:00:07,087 --> 02:00:10,204
Pockets! Get me a drink, will you?

1232
02:00:12,247 --> 02:00:14,442
Left a white trail.

1233
02:00:14,607 --> 02:00:17,167
A white trail against the blue sky.

1234
02:00:29,327 --> 02:00:34,401
- Where's she going?
- She's taking the elephants for a swim.

1235
02:00:34,567 --> 02:00:36,922
Come on, baby!

1236
02:00:37,087 --> 02:00:38,679
Jambo!

1237
02:00:40,767 --> 02:00:42,962
Go get a gun and follow her, and see...

1238
02:00:43,127 --> 02:00:46,164
I don't think I can go fast enough,
big bwana.

1239
02:01:36,407 --> 02:01:38,682
Come, baby. Come!

1240
02:02:13,207 --> 02:02:14,845
That's good!

1241
02:02:44,687 --> 02:02:46,962
OK, baby! Let's go!

1242
02:02:53,807 --> 02:02:56,275
Come on, baby!

1243
02:03:14,807 --> 02:03:16,525
Hi!

1244
02:03:17,247 --> 02:03:19,807
What did I say about
leaving the compound

1245
02:03:19,967 --> 02:03:22,686
without somebody carrying a gun?

1246
02:03:22,847 --> 02:03:26,476
It wouldn't do me any good
to carry a gun, I can't shoot.

1247
02:03:26,647 --> 02:03:30,560
- It's a very short way.
- It's far enough to get you into trouble.

1248
02:03:30,727 --> 02:03:35,198
That "swimming pool" is a water-hole,
the only one around here.

1249
02:03:35,367 --> 02:03:38,245
- Everything comes here to drink.
- I won't bother them.

1250
02:03:38,407 --> 02:03:39,999
They might bother...

1251
02:03:40,447 --> 02:03:43,598
- What's that?
- Keep quiet.

1252
02:03:53,127 --> 02:03:55,482
Well, that does it.

1253
02:03:55,647 --> 02:04:00,641
Some of Tembo's grandfathers
are around. Here.

1254
02:04:01,767 --> 02:04:03,758
Keep walking.

1255
02:04:25,567 --> 02:04:27,478
Keep moving.

1256
02:04:30,927 --> 02:04:34,124
Get behind that tree and stay there.

1257
02:05:25,767 --> 02:05:28,327
You can come out now.

1258
02:05:35,767 --> 02:05:38,759
We're lucky. I think they've gone.

1259
02:05:38,927 --> 02:05:42,124
I was afraid you were going
to have to shoot him.

1260
02:05:42,287 --> 02:05:45,279
Him? That was a cow.

1261
02:05:45,447 --> 02:05:49,281
She was trying to tell us
to leave her baby alone.

1262
02:05:49,447 --> 02:05:53,076
She has one, you have three.
She figured you had enough.

1263
02:05:53,247 --> 02:05:55,761
So do I. Come on.

1264
02:05:55,927 --> 02:05:58,316
OK. Let's go, baby. Come!

1265
02:06:10,767 --> 02:06:14,442
- Just about wound up.
- I only see one order left to fill.

1266
02:06:14,607 --> 02:06:18,361
- That's right, Indian, the rhino.
- You're going to try them?

1267
02:06:18,527 --> 02:06:22,281
- You still believe in that jinx?
- I still can't walk good, but...

1268
02:06:22,447 --> 02:06:25,883
...I won't waste any more breath.
Do one thing to humour me.

1269
02:06:26,047 --> 02:06:29,084
- What's that?
- Use the power wagon for herding.

1270
02:06:29,247 --> 02:06:30,919
- It's slower.
- Fast enough.

1271
02:06:31,087 --> 02:06:33,362
And higher. A rhino can't climb into it.

1272
02:06:33,527 --> 02:06:34,926
I'll buy that.

1273
02:06:35,087 --> 02:06:38,284
- Is it working good?
- I'm the one who has to drive it.

1274
02:06:38,447 --> 02:06:40,915
All right. We'll use two ropes tomorrow.

1275
02:06:41,087 --> 02:06:46,115
Chips, you take a pole with Kurt.
We leave early so we'd better turn in.

1276
02:06:46,287 --> 02:06:52,317
We don't want any hangovers
or fuzzy heads in the morning, Pockets!

1277
02:06:52,487 --> 02:06:54,239
All right, goodnight!

1278
02:07:18,847 --> 02:07:21,680
Pockets, tell Sean
he's looking the wrong way.

1279
02:07:21,847 --> 02:07:25,635
You've got a visitor, right behind you!

1280
02:07:28,847 --> 02:07:34,126
Why don't you put the tailgate down
and let him climb in?

1281
02:07:48,847 --> 02:07:52,635
- We'll take this one.
- Kurt, we'll take this one.

1282
02:07:54,807 --> 02:07:56,399
Will do.

1283
02:08:10,327 --> 02:08:12,682
This is a big one. Don't be in a hurry.

1284
02:08:12,847 --> 02:08:14,883
I'll be very careful, bwana.

1285
02:08:38,127 --> 02:08:40,595
You're supposed to chase him!

1286
02:08:42,007 --> 02:08:43,998
Tell him that!

1287
02:08:54,847 --> 02:08:58,157
- Move in a little, Pockets.
- Moving in.

1288
02:09:11,087 --> 02:09:13,647
Watch that line, Saidi!

1289
02:09:29,687 --> 02:09:33,043
Take a dolly around that roller bar!

1290
02:09:34,127 --> 02:09:39,155
Hang on! Hang on, boys!
Hang on to the son of a...

1291
02:09:40,687 --> 02:09:43,485
All right, Luis. He's all yours.

1292
02:09:55,487 --> 02:09:58,285
Lay that loop over his head, Chips.

1293
02:10:01,687 --> 02:10:05,282
- Kurt, pull her forward a little.
- Say when.

1294
02:10:08,687 --> 02:10:10,678
When!

1295
02:10:16,727 --> 02:10:19,799
- Stand still, there.
- Jump the other one.

1296
02:10:19,967 --> 02:10:23,960
Keep those ropes taut.
I'm gonna try and move him.

1297
02:10:33,927 --> 02:10:36,077
Loosen this up a little.

1298
02:10:43,007 --> 02:10:44,998
Loosen this up a little.

1299
02:10:47,927 --> 02:10:51,806
- Fair day's work!
- Nice going, big bwana.

1300
02:10:51,967 --> 02:10:55,482
- That's the end of your jinx.
- Sure looks that way.

1301
02:10:55,647 --> 02:10:59,003
Kick him in the backsides
for old times' sake?

1302
02:11:02,807 --> 02:11:05,799
Don't get tangled in those ropes!

1303
02:11:10,727 --> 02:11:12,843
Hang on to him!

1304
02:11:15,567 --> 02:11:18,286
Look out! He's loose!

1305
02:11:24,607 --> 02:11:26,837
Well... Let's start over.

1306
02:11:27,007 --> 02:11:28,998
Get going again!

1307
02:12:07,127 --> 02:12:10,119
All right, move in a little closer.

1308
02:12:24,687 --> 02:12:26,837
Is that close enough?

1309
02:12:33,287 --> 02:12:35,676
Let's give it a try. He's tired.

1310
02:12:39,247 --> 02:12:42,319
Bwana, are we talking
about the same animal?

1311
02:12:48,047 --> 02:12:50,038
Bring him in a little!

1312
02:12:56,087 --> 02:12:57,998
Watch it, Pockets!

1313
02:12:59,127 --> 02:13:02,119
Watch it, he's gonna quit on you!

1314
02:13:27,567 --> 02:13:29,637
Get another rope around his head!

1315
02:13:29,807 --> 02:13:33,800
We're all right.
Watch that line on the catching car.

1316
02:13:36,847 --> 02:13:38,838
Take the rope.

1317
02:13:49,487 --> 02:13:52,718
Unload the crate and grab those lines.

1318
02:13:56,727 --> 02:13:59,924
Now, pull! Yank on it!

1319
02:14:00,087 --> 02:14:01,520
Look out!

1320
02:14:01,687 --> 02:14:03,882
All right, tip him over.

1321
02:14:16,807 --> 02:14:18,763
They got him now!

1322
02:14:19,687 --> 02:14:22,485
There you are, Indian.
He won't get away!

1323
02:14:22,647 --> 02:14:25,844
Easy, Sean, easy! This breaks the jinx.

1324
02:14:26,007 --> 02:14:28,680
I'll feel a lot better when he's delivered.

1325
02:14:28,847 --> 02:14:33,045
- Bring in that crate.
- He's a real nice one!

1326
02:14:40,807 --> 02:14:44,686
- Coming in.
- You got cleaned up in a hurry.

1327
02:14:44,847 --> 02:14:47,759
Good to be finished,
nothing to do in the morning.

1328
02:14:47,927 --> 02:14:51,920
We're not finished till we get those
animals to Mombasa, aboard ship.

1329
02:14:52,087 --> 02:14:53,964
That won't take long.

1330
02:14:54,127 --> 02:14:56,402
Marja Singh said he'd go with them.

1331
02:14:56,567 --> 02:15:00,116
He's a good man.
What'll you do till next season?

1332
02:15:00,287 --> 02:15:04,678
I had a letter from Bandini.
He's got a new car, wants me to drive it.

1333
02:15:04,847 --> 02:15:06,678
I thought you quit that?

1334
02:15:06,847 --> 02:15:10,522
I know, but... one more time won't hurt.

1335
02:15:11,567 --> 02:15:14,240
I hope you don't break your neck.

1336
02:15:14,407 --> 02:15:16,967
- The Frenchman is coming with me.
- Oh?

1337
02:15:17,127 --> 02:15:20,676
We'll go to Paris.
We found out we both know a girl there.

1338
02:15:21,807 --> 02:15:25,959
- One girl for the two of you?
- We'll go halves.

1339
02:15:26,127 --> 02:15:29,642
It's a good excuse for another fight.

1340
02:15:29,807 --> 02:15:34,119
- What's Dallas going to do?
- I don't know.

1341
02:15:34,287 --> 02:15:39,202
- Do you want an opinion from me?
- Looks like I'm gonna get it anyway.

1342
02:15:39,367 --> 02:15:43,406
It's like you got bit by a leopard
and now you see spots on everything.

1343
02:15:43,567 --> 02:15:45,797
I know all about that.

1344
02:15:45,967 --> 02:15:49,357
There's something about this girl.
I... I like her.

1345
02:15:49,527 --> 02:15:51,995
- What?
- I really like her.

1346
02:15:52,167 --> 02:15:53,998
It's gone that far?

1347
02:15:54,167 --> 02:15:56,920
Look, I don't know her
and she doesn't know me.

1348
02:15:57,087 --> 02:15:59,237
I've been busy. I haven't had time.

1349
02:15:59,407 --> 02:16:01,967
Only three months,
the whole hunting season.

1350
02:16:02,127 --> 02:16:06,279
- Are you pushing me?
- No! Take your time. She'll wait.

1351
02:16:06,447 --> 02:16:10,156
- Look, Kurt. This is serious.
- Ask her to come back next year.

1352
02:16:10,327 --> 02:16:14,081
She isn't very attractive.
She won't meet anybody like you...

1353
02:16:14,247 --> 02:16:18,763
More cracks and you won't need
a racing car to break your neck.

1354
02:16:18,927 --> 02:16:22,283
- Let's go to town.
- I don't think you should.

1355
02:16:22,447 --> 02:16:24,722
You shouldn't be with her all evening.

1356
02:16:24,887 --> 02:16:28,357
You might say something
you'll feel sorry about.

1357
02:16:30,207 --> 02:16:34,997
- Am I as bad as that?
- You ought to know.

1358
02:16:43,247 --> 02:16:45,807
- Who is it?
- Pockets.

1359
02:16:46,847 --> 02:16:48,599
Come on in.

1360
02:16:48,767 --> 02:16:50,405
Say, Dallas...

1361
02:16:50,567 --> 02:16:52,444
Hi, Pockets.

1362
02:16:53,207 --> 02:16:55,801
We're going into town...

1363
02:16:55,967 --> 02:16:58,879
...to celebrate. Are you ready?

1364
02:16:59,047 --> 02:17:02,278
I don't think I'll go,
I've got some work to do.

1365
02:17:02,447 --> 02:17:06,406
Dallas, this is Pockets.
What's the matter?

1366
02:17:07,407 --> 02:17:09,716
Isn't it going too good?

1367
02:17:09,887 --> 02:17:12,879
No, it's not going too good.

1368
02:17:13,847 --> 02:17:17,317
Probably my fault.
I messed it up a couple of times.

1369
02:17:17,487 --> 02:17:20,559
That didn't mean anything.
You didn't mess it up.

1370
02:17:20,727 --> 02:17:23,605
I didn't do it. She did it.

1371
02:17:23,767 --> 02:17:27,396
- Come again?
- That girl you told me about.

1372
02:17:27,567 --> 02:17:31,526
The one you said
made him burn his fingers.

1373
02:17:32,367 --> 02:17:34,881
When he looks at me,
when he touches me,

1374
02:17:35,047 --> 02:17:39,518
he likes what he sees
and what he feels just for...

1375
02:17:39,687 --> 02:17:42,918
Then she's there
and I'm not there any more.

1376
02:17:43,087 --> 02:17:46,477
- Well, couldn't you sort of?
- No, I couldn't.

1377
02:17:49,927 --> 02:17:52,487
It's all over.

1378
02:17:52,647 --> 02:17:56,435
I don't even know if I want him any more.

1379
02:17:57,887 --> 02:18:00,879
I was all right until you came in.

1380
02:18:02,247 --> 02:18:05,557
I just couldn't stand him looking at me

1381
02:18:05,727 --> 02:18:10,084
and wondering
if I was going to be like her.

1382
02:18:10,247 --> 02:18:12,556
I'd rather not have him.

1383
02:18:12,727 --> 02:18:17,721
It just wouldn't...
Oh, please, Pockets, go away!

1384
02:18:19,687 --> 02:18:24,283
Well, Dallas, if there's anything
I can do to help.

1385
02:18:24,447 --> 02:18:27,598
Please go away, go with the others.

1386
02:18:39,687 --> 02:18:44,522
All aboard! Bus now leaving
for 42nd Street and Arusha Square!

1387
02:18:44,687 --> 02:18:48,043
- Everybody here?
- Where's Dallas?

1388
02:18:48,207 --> 02:18:51,995
In her room. She's not coming.
Says she has work to do.

1389
02:18:52,167 --> 02:18:54,283
- Well!
- Well, what?

1390
02:18:54,447 --> 02:18:56,961
I'll see if I can get her
to change her mind.

1391
02:18:57,127 --> 02:18:59,800
You all go on ahead,
I'll see you in town.

1392
02:18:59,967 --> 02:19:03,277
Holy smoke!
What have you got in the third?

1393
02:19:03,447 --> 02:19:05,563
- Pretty good, eh?
- Smells good, too.

1394
02:19:05,727 --> 02:19:07,877
- This is business.
- Has it got a sister?

1395
02:19:08,047 --> 02:19:09,958
Two sisters?

1396
02:19:12,687 --> 02:19:14,803
Dallas? It's Sean.

1397
02:19:14,967 --> 02:19:16,559
Come in.

1398
02:19:18,087 --> 02:19:20,965
What's going on here?

1399
02:19:21,127 --> 02:19:24,915
- Please turn the light off, Sean.
- Sure.

1400
02:19:31,887 --> 02:19:34,924
What's the matter?
Why aren't you going with us?

1401
02:19:35,087 --> 02:19:37,237
I just don't feel like it.

1402
02:19:38,007 --> 02:19:39,520
You've been crying.

1403
02:19:39,687 --> 02:19:42,997
What if I have?
Can't somebody cry if they want to?

1404
02:19:43,167 --> 02:19:46,079
- What are you crying about?
- Nothing, nothing.

1405
02:19:46,247 --> 02:19:49,683
A girl doesn't cry about nothing.
It must be something.

1406
02:19:49,847 --> 02:19:53,283
It's because I... I got a scrotch.

1407
02:19:53,447 --> 02:19:56,484
- A what?
- A scrotch, going through the bush.

1408
02:19:56,647 --> 02:20:00,037
- Oh, a scratch!
- Scratch or scrotch, it hurts.

1409
02:20:00,207 --> 02:20:02,243
- What are you doing?
- Hold still!

1410
02:20:02,407 --> 02:20:06,036
No wonder it hurts,
the thorn is still in you.

1411
02:20:06,207 --> 02:20:09,358
There...
There's some iodine around here.

1412
02:20:09,527 --> 02:20:11,597
Never mind, just let it go.

1413
02:20:11,767 --> 02:20:13,917
It would be better with something on it.

1414
02:20:14,087 --> 02:20:16,362
You need iodine worse than I do.

1415
02:20:16,527 --> 02:20:19,405
- I need iodine?
- For your fingers.

1416
02:20:19,567 --> 02:20:22,923
- There's nothing wrong with them!
- Yes, there is!

1417
02:20:23,087 --> 02:20:26,875
I got all mixed up.
You don't use iodine on a burn, do you?

1418
02:20:27,047 --> 02:20:29,720
A burn? Make sense!

1419
02:20:29,887 --> 02:20:34,199
- How do you treat burned fingers?
- I guess you... put butter on them.

1420
02:20:34,367 --> 02:20:37,643
Yeah, then some day
you'll find somebody with butter.

1421
02:20:37,807 --> 02:20:41,925
I don't get it. Fingers, butter...
What are you talking about?

1422
02:20:42,087 --> 02:20:45,602
Go away! You always come
when I don't want you.

1423
02:20:45,767 --> 02:20:49,885
- Oh, Dallas, cut it out!
- Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

1424
02:20:50,047 --> 02:20:53,517
- Get out of here before I...
- OK!

1425
02:21:07,487 --> 02:21:10,445
Now, what the hell did I say?

1426
02:21:17,047 --> 02:21:21,563
First morning we can sleep,
those elephants...

1427
02:21:21,727 --> 02:21:23,285
What a racket!

1428
02:21:23,447 --> 02:21:27,486
Hasn't Mama Tembo
fed them this morning?

1429
02:21:27,647 --> 02:21:31,959
Mama Tembo has gone.
That's why they're yelling.

1430
02:21:32,127 --> 02:21:34,641
- "Gone"?
- She left a little while ago.

1431
02:21:34,807 --> 02:21:37,082
What do you mean, "left"?

1432
02:21:37,247 --> 02:21:40,683
- He may understand you, Pockets.
- I'll take a chance.

1433
02:21:40,847 --> 02:21:44,362
She has packed her bags
and departed from our midst.

1434
02:21:44,527 --> 02:21:49,043
- She can't do that!
- I found this letter under my door.

1435
02:21:49,207 --> 02:21:54,122
- Behave and I'll tell you what she says.
- Well, read it.

1436
02:21:54,287 --> 02:21:57,040
"Dearest Pockets... " That's me.

1437
02:21:57,207 --> 02:22:01,883
"I can't stand goodbyes, so
I'm having Saidi drive me into town. "

1438
02:22:02,047 --> 02:22:04,561
You notice she doesn't write
with an accent.

1439
02:22:04,727 --> 02:22:07,844
"Tell everybody that
I can't find words to thank them,

1440
02:22:08,007 --> 02:22:12,080
"that I'll never forget them,
that I love them. Dallas. "

1441
02:22:12,247 --> 02:22:15,444
- You believe now that she's gone?
- I'm gonna stop her.

1442
02:22:15,607 --> 02:22:17,837
You didn't want her to go?

1443
02:22:18,007 --> 02:22:21,079
- Of course I didn't!
- You asked her to stay?

1444
02:22:21,247 --> 02:22:24,603
- I was going to ask her, but...
- But what?

1445
02:22:24,767 --> 02:22:28,521
- She wouldn't let me. She ran me out.
- She's smart.

1446
02:22:28,687 --> 02:22:31,326
- What are you going to do?
- Find her.

1447
02:22:31,487 --> 02:22:34,763
Arusha's a big town,
if she doesn't want to be found.

1448
02:22:34,927 --> 02:22:37,316
- Tembo might find her.
- Get him on the scent.

1449
02:22:37,487 --> 02:22:39,921
- He's got a long nose!
- Hurry!

1450
02:22:40,087 --> 02:22:41,645
Right!

1451
02:22:41,807 --> 02:22:44,367
- What's this?
- She left that behind.

1452
02:22:44,527 --> 02:22:46,643
Make a good bandage for your fingers.

1453
02:22:46,807 --> 02:22:50,117
Friends! Tell the airport
not to let her on a plane.

1454
02:22:50,287 --> 02:22:55,042
- Shall we say why?
- Say she stole something. Money.

1455
02:22:55,207 --> 02:22:57,277
Tell the police to watch the Nairobi road.

1456
02:22:57,447 --> 02:22:59,802
- How much money?
- She robbed a bank.

1457
02:22:59,967 --> 02:23:02,686
Chips and I will check the taxi station.

1458
02:23:02,847 --> 02:23:05,998
I'll go with them.
I can go places they can't.

1459
02:23:06,167 --> 02:23:08,078
Hurry it up, Luis.

1460
02:23:08,247 --> 02:23:12,525
Why bring all three?
We can only use Tembo.

1461
02:23:14,127 --> 02:23:16,687
Get in there, get in!

1462
02:23:17,967 --> 02:23:19,878
Hold it!

1463
02:23:22,647 --> 02:23:27,675
Come on, Tembo!
What does she do to make him move?

1464
02:23:27,847 --> 02:23:31,965
Come on, get in. Come on, Tembo!

1465
02:23:42,767 --> 02:23:44,280
Come on!

1466
02:23:44,447 --> 02:23:47,439
This might work!

1467
02:23:47,607 --> 02:23:49,484
What is that?

1468
02:23:49,647 --> 02:23:53,401
Look, Tembo! Look, this is Mama.
Yes, Mama!

1469
02:23:53,567 --> 02:23:55,876
Bwana, you remember Mama, don't you?

1470
02:23:56,047 --> 02:23:59,437
Come on, take a good smell now.

1471
02:23:59,607 --> 02:24:01,996
- Yes, it's Mama!
- It's gonna work!

1472
02:24:02,167 --> 02:24:05,523
Wise child that knows its own mother.

1473
02:24:05,687 --> 02:24:08,440
Come on, there's no room for you.

1474
02:24:30,687 --> 02:24:35,715
Airport? If a girl about 5' 6" tall
with red hair shows up,

1475
02:24:35,887 --> 02:24:40,244
don't let her on a plane,
she robbed the Bank of England.

1476
02:25:16,967 --> 02:25:20,642
- Wait a minute, stop! Sean!
- Any luck?

1477
02:25:20,807 --> 02:25:23,082
She's not at the railroad station.

1478
02:25:23,247 --> 02:25:26,205
- She's been to the ticket office.
- What for?

1479
02:25:26,367 --> 02:25:30,280
Airline ticket, but she wasn't
at the airport. She must be in town.

1480
02:25:30,447 --> 02:25:32,483
- Where?
- I don't know.

1481
02:25:32,647 --> 02:25:35,798
- Tembo doing any good?
- Not a thing.

1482
02:25:35,967 --> 02:25:39,164
- Do those clothes belong to Dallas?
- Sure.

1483
02:25:39,327 --> 02:25:44,526
He's probably smelling them,
no wonder. Give them to us.

1484
02:26:09,407 --> 02:26:12,444
Sean, slow up.
I think he smells something.

1485
02:26:15,847 --> 02:26:18,441
He does smell something.

1486
02:26:22,647 --> 02:26:25,639
Come on, Tembo. Come on, baby.

1487
02:26:27,287 --> 02:26:31,280
There he goes...
He's going into Singh's. Come on.

1488
02:26:43,527 --> 02:26:45,165
Oh, no!

1489
02:27:24,687 --> 02:27:26,518
Go away!

1490
02:28:44,207 --> 02:28:46,675
You shouldn't have done it!

1491
02:28:47,647 --> 02:28:50,719
It's not... It's not fair!

1492
02:28:54,247 --> 02:28:58,718
I didn't want you to do this...
Why, why did you?

1493
02:28:58,887 --> 02:29:02,323
- Look, Dallas...
- What did you do that for?

1494
02:29:02,487 --> 02:29:05,604
Why didn't you just let me go?

1495
02:29:05,767 --> 02:29:08,759
Go away! It's all your fault.

1496
02:29:37,207 --> 02:29:38,799
Goodnight, Sean!

1497
02:29:50,247 --> 02:29:55,844
Before you go any further,
I should tell you you're not alone.

1498
02:30:03,327 --> 02:30:07,400
- What's your name?
- They call me Dallas.

1499
02:30:08,407 --> 02:30:11,399
What are you doing in my bed?

1500
02:30:12,967 --> 02:30:15,083
Sean, I wanna talk to you.

1501
02:30:15,247 --> 02:30:19,763
You know that girl Dallas
we were looking for? If we wanna...

1502
02:30:19,927 --> 02:30:21,758
Oh, Sean.

1503
02:30:21,927 --> 02:30:26,239
You know that girl we were
looking for this afternoon?

1504
02:30:26,407 --> 02:30:29,399
- She's in your bed.
- Pockets. Out.

1505
02:30:29,567 --> 02:30:32,206
- What's she doing in your bed?
- Get out.

1506
02:30:32,367 --> 02:30:34,278
We got married this afternoon!

1507
02:30:34,447 --> 02:30:36,517
Oh, no!

1508
02:30:36,687 --> 02:30:39,406
Go away! Go away, now!

1509
02:30:40,527 --> 02:30:42,757
Tembo, go away!

1510
02:30:42,927 --> 02:30:45,361
Tembo!

1511
02:30:45,527 --> 02:30:47,518
Go away!
