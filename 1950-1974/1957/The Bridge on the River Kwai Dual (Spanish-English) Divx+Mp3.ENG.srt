1
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,925
Finish work!

2
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,323
Go to hut.

3
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,002
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,838
If the new prisoners see us
digging graves, they may run.

5
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:32,001
No time for jokes. Finish work!

6
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,123
Dig, dig.

7
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:36,798
How about putting us
on sick list?

8
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,003
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.

9
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:43,406
You no sick. You never sick.

10
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,998
Why you always play sick, Shears?

11
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,007
Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.

12
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,443
Captain Kanematsu...

13
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:54,243
...how about a butt?

14
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:57,049
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

15
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:00,361
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.

16
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,242
When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart...

17
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:07,198
...like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.

18
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,207
That's why...

19
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,199
...I want you to keep this lighter.

20
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:18,807
Think I stole it?

21
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,603
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.

22
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,443
He gave it to me
for a favour I'd done him.

23
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,522
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

24
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,203
You funny man, Shears.

25
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,800
You go on sick list. Him too.

26
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,606
One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him...

27
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,407
...then where'll we be?

28
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,206
Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.

29
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,407
Far away.

30
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, let's knock off.

31
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,602
Here lies...

32
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,047
I forgot who we just buried.

33
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,483
Thomson.

34
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,003
Ah, yes.

35
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,121
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

36
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,998
...serial number zero-one-two-
three-four-five-six-seven.

37
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,999
Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something...

38
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,602
...who died of beri-beri
in the year of our Lord, 1943...

39
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,199
...for the greater glory of...

40
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,440
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.

41
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,805
No need to mock the grave.

42
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:29,004
I don't mock the grave or the man.

43
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,000
May he rest in peace.

44
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,323
He found little of it
while he was alive.

45
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:31,679
"A" Company, mark time!

46
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,847
Mark time!

47
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,163
Halt.

48
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:06,128
Into line, left turn.

49
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,207
Stand easy.

50
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:20,003
We're going to be
busy gravediggers, Weaver.

51
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:22,402
Well done, well done.

52
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,044
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

53
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,200
You going to tell him the truth?

54
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,643
Of course not.

55
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,601
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

56
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:13,322
My name is Nicholson.

57
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:16,398
I am Colonel Saito.

58
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:32,405
In the name of His lmperial Majesty...

59
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,406
...I welcome you.

60
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,398
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

61
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,522
...which is Camp 16...

62
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,999
...along the great railroad...

63
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:49,204
...which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

64
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,437
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

65
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:57,726
...to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

66
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:02,728
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.

67
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:07,599
And officers will work as well as men.

68
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:12,964
The Japanese Army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.

69
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,962
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

70
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:21,608
But if you do not work hard...

71
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,277
...you will be punished.

72
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:29,004
A word to you about escape.

73
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,209
There is no barbed wire.

74
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:34,407
No stockade.

75
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,322
No watchtower.

76
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:39,842
They are not necessary.

77
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,609
We are an island in the jungle.

78
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:45,687
Escape is impossible.

79
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,603
You would die.

80
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:54,004
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.

81
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,088
Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:

82
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,042
"Be happy in your work."

83
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,598
Be happy in your work.

84
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:08,443
Dismissed.

85
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:16,325
Battalion, stand at ease.

86
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:17,922
Fall out, Major Hughes.

87
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,205
Battalion, stand easy.

88
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,404
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.

89
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,879
I'm going to have a word
with this fellow.

90
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,798
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

91
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,599
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.

92
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,040
My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

93
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:45,202
You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labour...

94
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,764
...is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

95
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:49,163
Is that so?

96
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,007
I have a copy of the convention...

97
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,087
...and would be glad to
let you glance through it.

98
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,599
That will not be necessary.

99
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,001
Sit down, please.

100
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:50,643
Yes, sir.

101
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,198
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.

102
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:37,643
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

103
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:39,607
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.

104
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:43,159
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

105
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:44,563
How do you do, sir?

106
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,407
We found him and an Australian.

107
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:48,600
All that's left of the
prisoners who built the camp.

108
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,441
U.S. Navy? Out here?

109
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,600
I am sort of landlocked.

110
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,919
<i>- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.</i>

111
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,445
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

112
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,042
And your group here?

113
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,405
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

114
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,804
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

115
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,601
And what happened to them?

116
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08,208
They died...

117
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,400
...of malaria, dysentery,
beri-beri, gangrene.

118
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:14,843
Other causes of death:

119
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,002
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites...

120
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:20,882
...Saito.

121
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,288
Then there were some
who just got tired of living.

122
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,723
Has Clipton seen you?

123
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,961
Just about to. Come over here,
you can shave later.

124
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,288
All right.

125
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,606
You'll stay with the officers.

126
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,441
We'll find some decent clothing.

127
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,048
Don't bother about me.

128
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,405
I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.

129
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,368
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.

130
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,639
The officers in your party
did manual labour?

131
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,487
I think you could call it that.

132
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,802
I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.

133
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,203
Saito.

134
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,207
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?

135
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,601
Yes. I must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.

136
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,646
Well, I must be pushing on.

137
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,607
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

138
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,602
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,523
Anything we can do.

140
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,361
Thank you, sir.

141
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,839
- What is it?
- Never mind.

142
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,408
Go on, say it.

143
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,648
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito...

144
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:23,199
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

145
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,407
Perhaps Col. Nicholson
defines the word differently.

146
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,243
Any other points?

147
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:37,888
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?

148
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:41,041
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd. Shears...

149
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,041
There won't be any escape committee.

150
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:45,723
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.

151
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,642
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?

152
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:53,121
Where? Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.

153
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:57,203
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.

154
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:01,405
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

155
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:05,238
I'd say that the odds against a
successful escape are 100 to one.

156
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,197
But may I add another word?

157
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,643
Please.

158
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,886
The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.

159
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:15,007
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.

160
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,403
To give up hope of escape...

161
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:19,846
...to stop thinking about it
means accepting a death sentence.

162
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:22,649
Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?

163
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:26,598
I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.

164
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,800
I understand how you feel.

165
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:33,721
Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.

166
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,722
But my men and I are
involved in a curious legal point...

167
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:39,039
...of which you are unaware.

168
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,804
In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.

169
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,647
Ordered, mind you.

170
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:49,207
Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.

171
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,643
Interesting point, sir.

172
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:53,323
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.

173
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,999
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

174
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,809
Without law, commander,
there is no civilization.

175
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:03,287
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.

176
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:06,208
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

177
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:09,403
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

178
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,000
Is there anything else?

179
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,600
I think we're
clear on the program.

180
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:21,319
I want everything to go off smoothly
starting tomorrow morning.

181
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,042
And remember this:

182
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:26,201
Our men must always feel they are
still commanded by us...

183
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,326
...and not by the Japanese.

184
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:32,642
So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

185
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,880
Are you with me there, commander?

186
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,206
I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.

187
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,479
As for me, I'm just a slave.

188
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,725
A living slave.

189
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,606
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

190
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:04,723
He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.

191
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:08,882
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.

192
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:25,598
English prisoners!

193
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,201
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

194
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:37,045
From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.

195
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:42,804
You will finish the bridge
by the twelfth day of May.

196
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:48,085
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.

197
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,239
Time is short. All men will work.

198
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,403
Your officers will work beside you.

199
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,321
This is only just...

200
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,399
...for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.

201
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:07,077
Your shame is their dishonour.

202
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,720
It is they who told you...

203
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,360
...better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.

204
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,726
It is they who brought you here,
not I.

205
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,204
Therefore, they will join you
in useful labour.

206
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,402
That is all.

207
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:29,523
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

208
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,203
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:40,809
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

210
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,603
...to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,843
"Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war...

212
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,045
...who are fit,
other than officers..."

213
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,483
Give me the book.

214
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:53,163
By all means.
You read English, I take it?

215
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,439
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.

216
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,806
If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.

217
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,920
You see, the Code states that...

218
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,009
Stand fast in the ranks.

219
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:07,959
You speak to me of Code?

220
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:10,602
What "Code"?

221
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,925
The coward's code!

222
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,524
What do you know
of the soldier's code?

223
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,806
<i>Of bushido? Nothing!</i>

224
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,404
You are unworthy of command!

225
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,726
If you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilized worid...

226
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:41,439
...we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.

227
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:44,806
My officers will not do manual labour.

228
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:46,682
We shall see.

229
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,403
All enlisted prisoners to work.

230
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:06,601
Sergeant Major! Take the men to work.

231
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,403
Battalion, take up tools.

232
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:17,207
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!

233
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:22,001
"A" Company, by the right,
quick march.

234
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,522
Eyes right.

235
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:28,399
Eyes right.

236
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:37,600
Eyes front.

237
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:49,198
Quick march, eyes right.

238
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,605
"C" Company, by the right.

239
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,567
What's he up to?

240
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,808
Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.

241
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,922
Now, you will be reasonable.

242
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:31,244
You will order your officers to work.

243
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:32,683
No.

244
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:04,600
I will count three.

245
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:06,720
If by the third count...

246
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:11,201
...you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

247
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,003
...I will give the order to fire.

248
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,202
He's going to do it.

249
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,119
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

250
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:39,243
One.

251
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,968
I warn you, Colonel...

252
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:42,602
Two.

253
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:46,842
Stop!

254
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,409
Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.

255
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,440
So has every man in the hospital.

256
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,008
They're too many witnesses.

257
00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:02,083
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.

258
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:08,164
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?

259
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,208
You see, Jennings, there are
advantages to being on the sick list.

260
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:24,247
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.

261
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:26,639
"Into the valley of death
rode the 600."

262
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:28,208
How's that, sir?

263
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,328
That kind of guts.

264
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,241
Also the kind they had in 1914...

265
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:35,049
...when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.

266
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,406
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.

267
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,408
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

268
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,998
Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.

269
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:28,007
Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.

270
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:30,202
What about him?

271
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,722
He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.

272
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:38,599
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

273
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:41,168
Here we go again.

274
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:54,204
Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.

275
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,202
Tell them to go.

276
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,527
Not you.

277
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:20,083
Come.

278
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:41,961
Leave him alone!

279
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:45,327
Leave him alone!

280
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,004
They're going to put him in the oven.

281
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:03,004
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

282
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:07,564
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

283
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,959
<i>And so say all of us</i>

284
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:14,799
<i>And so say all of us
And so say all of us</i>

285
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:19,924
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

286
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:23,440
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

287
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:25,964
<i>And so say all of us</i>

288
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:31,085
Timber!

289
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,926
One, two, three, four.

290
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,964
One, two, three, four.

291
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,407
No, no, no!

292
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,277
Let go!

293
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,043
Let go!

294
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:40,728
You wish to see me?

295
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:43,085
I've tried to see you for three days.

296
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,287
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...

297
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,245
I could have you shot.

298
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:55,927
Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.

299
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:57,922
I knew nothing about the escape.

300
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:00,640
It does not matter.

301
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,647
One must respect those who tried.

302
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:07,484
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

303
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,367
...they were soldiers again.

304
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,287
But it is insane to try and escape.

305
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,647
Two soldiers shot
and the third drowned.

306
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:20,288
To what end?

307
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:23,242
It was an escape from reality.

308
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,847
There is your reality.

309
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:37,645
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.

310
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,559
And this shows the position
of actual progress.

311
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:48,165
Because of your colonel's stubbornness,
we are far behind schedule.

312
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,364
That is not all.

313
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,803
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.

314
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:56,797
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.

315
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:59,558
Then who would build your bridge?

316
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,686
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

317
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:04,841
The men don't work well
without their own officers.

318
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:09,685
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.

319
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,721
That's for Nicholson to decide.

320
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,641
As he said,
it's against the rules.

321
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,885
Do not speak to me of rules.

322
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:17,847
This is war!

323
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,046
This is not a game of cricket.

324
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,445
He's mad, your colonel...

325
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,647
...quite mad.

326
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,437
Sit down, please.

327
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:42,519
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

328
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,163
Thank you.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:48,683
Tell him that if his officers
will not work...

330
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:51,762
...l'll be forced
to close the hospital...

331
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,240
...and your patients will
work in their place.

332
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:59,641
Many will die,
and he will be responsible.

333
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:04,168
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

334
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,524
Doc's going to see the old man.

335
00:37:38,249 --> 00:37:39,443
Sir...

336
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:45,048
It's Clipton, sir.

337
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:48,841
I brought you a few things.

338
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:56,403
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.

339
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,642
We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.

340
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:05,122
And the officers?

341
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,883
Not so good.
They're still in detention.

342
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:12,247
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.

343
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,885
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.

344
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:18,439
Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.

345
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,965
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

346
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,279
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?

347
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:28,248
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

348
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,763
I'm going to clean you up a little
while I talk.

349
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:37,045
I've got something to tell you.

350
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,644
I've just had a word with Saito.

351
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,405
That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

352
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:46,567
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.

353
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,277
Blackmail!

354
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:08,966
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.

355
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,679
It's a question of face, pure and
simple. And he can't give in.

356
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,159
It's still blackmail.

357
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,641
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

358
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:26,844
Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

359
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:31,883
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.

360
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:35,047
But Saito's cut their food rations...

361
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,280
...and if he makes
the sick men work...

362
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:41,158
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.

363
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:44,088
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

364
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:46,763
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.

365
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,638
If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.

366
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,842
Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.

367
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:02,565
We're under a man who'll stop at
nothing to get his way. Principle!

368
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:06,758
No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.

369
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:09,407
Give in, sir. Please!

370
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:11,048
I'm adamant.

371
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:14,838
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

372
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:16,681
- Time.
- All right.

373
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:22,248
Please thank those concerned.

374
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:25,248
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

375
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,047
Reynolds stole the coconut.

376
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,243
We'll be able to get you
food sometimes.

377
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:33,844
We've bribed one of your guards.

378
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:43,326
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

379
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:45,368
Many thanks.

380
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,965
Did you say that American
was killed?

381
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:57,245
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

382
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,642
It's insane to plan escapes.

383
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:05,561
Three men killed, and to what end?

384
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,003
Time!

385
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:10,164
Here is where we must win through.

386
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:33,442
Doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.

387
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:37,085
Means only one thing,
the colonel won't give in.

388
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:50,603
Well?

389
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:52,442
It's like this.

390
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:55,249
Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

391
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:57,525
It's a question of principle.

392
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:01,086
As medical officer, I protest
the way he's being treated.

393
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:03,206
It's a wonder he's still alive.

394
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:07,243
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

395
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,405
He is responsible.

396
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:14,002
Not I.

397
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:25,402
You sick?

398
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:30,999
Are they both mad?

399
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,400
Or am I going mad?

400
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:37,648
Or is it the sun?

401
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:34,202
Attention!

402
00:45:35,409 --> 00:45:38,003
Battalion, attention.

403
00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:42,805
English prisoners.

404
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:45,404
Let us ask the question...

405
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:48,686
...why does the bridge not progress?

406
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:54,124
You know why,
because your officers are lazy!

407
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:58,602
They think themselves too good
to share your burden.

408
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:01,048
This is not just.

409
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:04,326
Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.

410
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:08,359
Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.

411
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:11,045
But there is another cause.

412
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:14,201
I do not hide the truth.

413
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:17,198
With deep shame and regret...

414
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:19,644
...I admit to you the failure...

415
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:22,608
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

416
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:24,959
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

417
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:27,520
He is a bad engineer.

418
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:29,919
He is unworthy of command.

419
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,681
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

420
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:40,198
Tomorrow we begin again.

421
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:43,800
I shall be in personal command.

422
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:46,280
Today we rest.

423
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:52,606
All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy!

424
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:56,399
As token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

425
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:59,083
...I give presents to you all.

426
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:13,198
Let us be happy in our work.

427
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,728
Company, dismissed.

428
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:21,405
Battalion, dismissed.

429
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:37,518
Hey, take a look at this.

430
00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:40,329
Red Cross! He's given us our...

431
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:43,402
Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

432
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:46,806
"Tomorrow we begin again."

433
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:50,562
Hey, Harry, look!

434
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:53,480
They're letting the old man out.

435
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:18,001
Most likely going to give him
another pasting.

436
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:01,922
Good evening, colonel.

437
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,600
Do you mind sitting over here?

438
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:14,207
I am having rather a late supper.

439
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,599
English corned beef.

440
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:41,002
No, thank you.

441
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:48,526
Produce of Scotland.

442
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,319
I prefer it to sake.

443
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:55,363
I spent three years in London,
you know.

444
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:59,119
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

445
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:01,962
Cheers!

446
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:03,722
Sorry.

447
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,721
Later, perhaps?

448
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,527
Perhaps.

449
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:15,119
I was not a good artist.

450
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:17,559
My father disapproved.

451
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,118
He felt I belonged in the army.

452
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:24,718
So I changed from art to engineering.

453
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:29,320
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

454
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:33,158
I intend to make a full report
of your activities.

455
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,924
I do not think you
quite realize my position.

456
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,560
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.

457
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:49,563
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

458
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:52,369
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.

459
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:57,160
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

460
00:51:57,409 --> 00:52:00,128
No officers, except
for administration.

461
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:04,322
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

462
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:06,127
You know it. I know it.

463
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:09,127
I'm not responsible
for other officers.

464
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,762
Personally, I'm appalled.

465
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:13,278
Let's not get excited.

466
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:20,128
Will you have a cigar?

467
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:22,240
No. Thank you.

468
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:27,525
When I said all officers must work...

469
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:31,039
...naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

470
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:35,328
My orders were only intended
for officers below...

471
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:37,520
No officers will do manual labour.

472
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:40,920
Please! I was about to say:

473
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:44,326
I've thought the matter over
and have decided...

474
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:48,847
...to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

475
00:52:49,089 --> 00:52:51,728
...leaving only junior officers
to work.

476
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:55,365
No. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.

477
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:12,960
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

478
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:14,767
I haven't the foggiest.

479
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:17,523
I'd have to kill myself.

480
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:20,529
What would you do if you were me?

481
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:23,523
I suppose if I were you...

482
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:26,319
...l'd have to kill myself.

483
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:29,597
Cheers.

484
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:33,243
I warn you, colonel...

485
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:37,767
...if I am to die,
others will die before me.

486
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:39,203
Do you understand?

487
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,963
Clipton did mention that.

488
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:44,558
That won't solve your problem.

489
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:47,118
I'm sure we can
arrive at a solution.

490
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:48,927
Please sit down.

491
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:55,319
Now. Tell me, colonel...

492
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:59,159
...do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

493
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:01,206
- Of course.
- Good.

494
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:04,803
Now.

495
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:09,120
Take this bridge of yours.

496
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:11,925
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

497
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:16,122
Frankly, I doubt whether
your Lieutenant what's-his-name...

498
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,121
Miura.

499
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:22,724
...is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.

500
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:28,121
On the other hand, I have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance...

501
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:31,919
...who have built bridges
all over India.

502
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:34,522
The men respect them.

503
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:38,284
It's essential for an officer
to have that respect.

504
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:40,559
If it's gone, he ceases to command.

505
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:43,118
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.

506
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:46,725
A poor commander I would be if
I allowed that to happen.

507
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:51,884
Perhaps you are not aware that
the bridge is now under my command.

508
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:55,724
Really? And may I ask, are you
satisfied with the work?

509
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:58,159
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.

510
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:00,525
I hate the British!

511
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:03,766
You are defeated
but you have no shame.

512
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,318
You are stubborn
but have no pride.

513
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:09,447
You endure
but you have no courage.

514
00:55:09,689 --> 00:55:11,361
I hate the British!

515
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,240
Pointless, going on like this.

516
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:15,683
Stay there!

517
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:45,925
Stand down. Stand down!

518
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:57,438
Battalion, attention!

519
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:38,448
Battalion, stand at ease.

520
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:42,322
Please...

521
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:46,322
Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?

522
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:48,202
I've lost count.

523
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:51,122
It's the anniversary of
our great victory...

524
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:53,968
...over Russia in 1905.

525
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:58,168
Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.

526
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:00,161
In honour of this occasión...

527
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:03,003
...I have given your troops
a day of rest.

528
01:00:03,249 --> 01:00:04,443
Many thanks.

529
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:07,567
I am declaring a general amnesty.

530
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:11,165
You and your officers may
return to your quarters.

531
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:13,559
As part of this amnesty...

532
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:18,844
...it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labour.

533
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:49,043
He's done it!

534
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:08,359
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

535
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,401
How many men in your party?

536
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:23,526
I don't really know, sir.

537
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,805
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.

538
01:03:26,049 --> 01:03:29,200
One of the men took sick
this morning, sir.

539
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:32,640
It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.

540
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:37,759
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

541
01:03:38,049 --> 01:03:41,564
A corporal should know
how many men he has under him.

542
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:43,960
Oh, yes, sir.

543
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:48,364
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.

544
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:54,002
It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behaviour.

545
01:03:54,249 --> 01:03:55,364
No, sir.

546
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:01,569
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

547
01:04:11,049 --> 01:04:13,358
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?

548
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:16,959
Ever built a bridge
over a stream like the Kwai?

549
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:20,605
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them
in Madras, Bengal...

550
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:22,760
If this were your bridge...

551
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:25,565
...how would you get it under way?

552
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,201
Get it under way, sir?

553
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,963
First of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

554
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:34,279
Oh, why not?

555
01:04:34,529 --> 01:04:36,008
I was trying to tell you...

556
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:39,958
...the Japanese couldn't have
picked a worse location.

557
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:42,560
You see those piles?

558
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,367
They're sinking.

559
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:50,358
We could drive those logs
forever and they wouldn't hold.

560
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:52,560
Where would you build it?

561
01:04:53,649 --> 01:04:56,607
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.

562
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:59,568
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

563
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:04,361
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

564
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:08,682
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.

565
01:05:10,529 --> 01:05:12,565
Uncoordinated activity.

566
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,367
No teamwork.

567
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:18,966
Some parties are working
against each other.

568
01:05:21,169 --> 01:05:22,363
Yes.

569
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:28,766
I say, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.

570
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,603
Thanks to the Japanese,
we command a rabble.

571
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:34,158
There's no order, no discipline.

572
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:38,407
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.

573
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:40,401
Which isn't going to be easy.

574
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:44,005
Fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.

575
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:46,558
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.

576
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:53,365
We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that'll put them to shame.

577
01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:56,163
Show what a British
soldier is capable of.

578
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:58,969
Yes. I see your point, sir.

579
01:05:59,169 --> 01:06:01,808
I know how difficult
it's going to be here...

580
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:04,404
...where you can't find what you need.

581
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:07,561
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

582
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:10,198
You really want them
to build the bridge?

583
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:12,963
You're not usually
so slow in the uptake.

584
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:16,002
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

585
01:06:16,249 --> 01:06:19,161
If there weren't any work,
we'd invent some.

586
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:22,162
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.

587
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:24,798
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

588
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,085
Here again I know the men.

589
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:30,207
It's essential that they
take pride in their job.

590
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:31,962
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.

591
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:34,967
Reeves, you're
the key man here as engineer.

592
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:38,963
Tell me what you want and we'll
get it. Can we make a go of it?

593
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:41,364
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.

594
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:44,758
We must draw up our plans...

595
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,963
...then arrange a conference
with Saito...

596
01:06:48,649 --> 01:06:50,560
...and set him straight.

597
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:58,960
That takes care of all
the procedural matters.

598
01:07:00,009 --> 01:07:01,362
Oh, yes.

599
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,489
The next point is unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.

600
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:09,364
Sorry to say, the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily...

601
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:11,764
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

602
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:15,478
Incorrectly?

603
01:07:15,729 --> 01:07:17,162
Unfortunately, yes.

604
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:20,003
Our engineer has made
a study of the site...

605
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:23,446
...and decided that the river bottom
there is too soft.

606
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,443
Too soft?

607
01:07:25,689 --> 01:07:28,044
Mud! All the work
has been useless.

608
01:07:28,289 --> 01:07:31,162
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.

609
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:36,364
Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.

610
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:39,288
It would collapse
under the first train.

611
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:43,602
The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.

612
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:48,724
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?

613
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:05,197
I take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

614
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:10,364
...we build a new bridge, at the site
picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.

615
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:15,967
Let's proceed to the next point.

616
01:08:16,769 --> 01:08:19,363
I decided to alter
the work quota of our men.

617
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:21,207
- Alter?
- I've increased it.

618
01:08:21,449 --> 01:08:23,883
From 1.5 yards of earth moved
to two.

619
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:26,768
I'm sure it will
meet with your approval.

620
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:30,166
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?

621
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:33,282
I've done a time study
of the entire project.

622
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:37,204
You see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

623
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:40,998
I'd urge we revise the
organization of the working parties.

624
01:08:41,249 --> 01:08:46,164
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.

625
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:48,764
Would it be possible
to have dinner?

626
01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:50,158
Of course.

627
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:54,968
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

628
01:08:55,169 --> 01:08:58,878
If we increase the squads
and specialize their functions...

629
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:03,281
<i>...l'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30%.</i>

630
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:06,566
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point...

631
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:12,159
Now, there's another important
decisión that can't be postponed.

632
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:14,559
As the British
will work on the bridge...

633
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:17,607
...only a few will be available
for railway work.

634
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:22,559
I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang...

635
01:09:22,769 --> 01:09:27,160
...so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.

636
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,564
I have already given the order.

637
01:09:30,809 --> 01:09:33,767
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

638
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,757
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards
so as not to overtire them...

639
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:40,603
...but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?

640
01:09:40,849 --> 01:09:43,966
That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.

641
01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:48,926
I have already given the order.

642
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:51,603
We'll try to surpass that,
won't we, Hughes?

643
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:54,682
I think that completes
the agenda for tonight.

644
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:58,205
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

645
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:01,202
Are there any other questions?

646
01:10:02,609 --> 01:10:04,167
One question.

647
01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:07,204
Can you finish the bridge in time?

648
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:10,805
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.

649
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:13,358
But we'll certainly give it a go.

650
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:18,687
Don't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement...

651
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:20,681
...for which I was not to blame.

652
01:10:22,249 --> 01:10:23,967
Is there anything else?

653
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:25,764
No.

654
01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:30,157
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

655
01:10:31,249 --> 01:10:33,763
- Good night.
- Good night.

656
01:10:57,009 --> 01:11:01,161
I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

657
01:11:01,849 --> 01:11:04,966
For now I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

658
01:11:05,729 --> 01:11:08,368
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.

659
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:12,400
By the way, I meant to tell you...

660
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:15,368
...there are trees here
similar to elm.

661
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:19,357
And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

662
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,567
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.

663
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:25,759
Six hundred years.

664
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,365
That would be quite something.

665
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:18,998
I'm looking for an American
named Commander Shears.

666
01:12:19,249 --> 01:12:22,366
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.

667
01:12:29,769 --> 01:12:30,963
Kiss!

668
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:33,565
Too many eyes.

669
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,762
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas...

670
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:39,402
All I need is love.

671
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:42,368
It's true.
All you really need is love.

672
01:12:46,969 --> 01:12:49,961
Why are you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

673
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:52,404
Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.

674
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:54,685
And I always follow my heart.

675
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:56,157
Kiss.

676
01:13:04,369 --> 01:13:06,360
How's that, commander?

677
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:08,961
Don't call me commander.

678
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:10,488
It's unromantic.

679
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:12,367
You're an officer yourself.

680
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:15,402
How'd you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

681
01:13:15,649 --> 01:13:18,004
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."

682
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:19,278
Yes, sir.

683
01:13:21,049 --> 01:13:22,482
Brass ahoy.

684
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:24,961
He wants you. He's all yours.

685
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:27,558
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!

686
01:13:29,169 --> 01:13:30,602
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.

687
01:13:30,849 --> 01:13:32,567
My name's Warden.

688
01:13:32,929 --> 01:13:34,487
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...

689
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:37,084
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.

690
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:38,278
Like a martini?

691
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:40,201
That's very kind.
I think not.

692
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,564
Mind if I have one?

693
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:43,083
How did you get that?

694
01:13:43,329 --> 01:13:46,560
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

695
01:13:46,809 --> 01:13:49,164
Yes, of course. Jolly good.

696
01:13:49,569 --> 01:13:51,958
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

697
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:55,599
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 316.

698
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,204
Our headquarters is in
the Botanical Gardens.

699
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:01,566
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.

700
01:14:02,249 --> 01:14:04,558
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.

701
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:08,557
We have an interest
in that railway you worked on.

702
01:14:08,809 --> 01:14:11,960
You could give us no end
of valuable information.

703
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:15,559
Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

704
01:14:15,769 --> 01:14:18,761
...and I told your people
everything I know.

705
01:14:19,009 --> 01:14:22,206
But you could help us
in a rather special sense.

706
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:27,364
I know it's a terrible imposition, but
could you possibly come out and see us?

707
01:14:28,809 --> 01:14:31,607
If you want to go over
the whole thing again.

708
01:14:31,849 --> 01:14:34,409
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.

709
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:35,798
- Who?
- Mountbatten.

710
01:14:36,049 --> 01:14:38,563
We're one of his special pigeons.

711
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:42,364
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car.

712
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:44,560
This evening? Out of the question.

713
01:14:44,809 --> 01:14:46,959
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?

714
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,604
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.

715
01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:51,965
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

716
01:14:52,169 --> 01:14:53,363
Good luck.

717
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:55,364
Thanks.

718
01:15:03,049 --> 01:15:06,758
You're sorry, but
you're going to stand me up tonight.

719
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,960
You couldn't be more wrong.

720
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:15,685
General salute!

721
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:17,601
Present arms!

722
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:33,568
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.

723
01:15:45,809 --> 01:15:48,767
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.

724
01:16:00,129 --> 01:16:03,360
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

725
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:06,966
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.

726
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:12,168
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.

727
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:14,758
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!

728
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:21,158
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

729
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,202
Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.

730
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:27,963
You see, he's gained the initiative.

731
01:16:28,169 --> 01:16:31,798
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

732
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:34,165
- You're sorry?
- So am I.

733
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:37,560
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.

734
01:16:37,809 --> 01:16:41,563
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

735
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:45,766
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.

736
01:16:46,009 --> 01:16:50,160
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

737
01:16:56,049 --> 01:16:59,166
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.

738
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:03,357
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

739
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:07,759
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?

740
01:17:07,969 --> 01:17:09,368
Good of you to come.

741
01:17:09,609 --> 01:17:12,203
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.

742
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:15,407
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.

743
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:18,368
Col. Green is looking forward
to meeting you.

744
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:24,644
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.

745
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:29,565
We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.

746
01:17:29,969 --> 01:17:31,163
What do you do here?

747
01:17:31,369 --> 01:17:33,678
Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.

748
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:36,807
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.

749
01:17:37,049 --> 01:17:39,563
That pop was made
with a lump half this size.

750
01:17:39,809 --> 01:17:43,119
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
at half the weight.

751
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:47,162
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

752
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:48,962
Thanks for telling me.

753
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:52,479
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.

754
01:17:52,689 --> 01:17:54,964
You can do what you like with it.

755
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:57,367
This is my place.

756
01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:03,962
Go ahead.

757
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:09,984
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

758
01:18:12,305 --> 01:18:14,455
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

759
01:18:14,665 --> 01:18:16,781
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

760
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,983
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.

761
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:25,019
Do you read this?

762
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:28,974
I taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.

763
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:36,181
I never congratulated you
on your escape. Good show!

764
01:18:36,385 --> 01:18:40,094
If your sea rescue plane hadn't
spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

765
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:41,983
No, I suppose not.

766
01:18:45,065 --> 01:18:47,579
Would you like to see where you were?

767
01:18:48,505 --> 01:18:49,381
All right.

768
01:18:51,025 --> 01:18:54,415
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.

769
01:18:54,665 --> 01:18:56,383
We think the camp's here.

770
01:18:56,625 --> 01:19:00,294
Do your people have any idea
what happened to Col. Nicholson?

771
01:19:00,545 --> 01:19:04,424
He had guts. They were about to
shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

772
01:19:04,665 --> 01:19:07,702
If you're about to be shot
there's not much you can do.

773
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:12,217
Here is the river Kwai, and here's
the village where you were helped.

774
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:13,978
Here is the railway.

775
01:19:14,185 --> 01:19:16,779
You must be fairly familiar
with this area.

776
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,419
No, I was out of my head
half the time.

777
01:19:19,665 --> 01:19:23,101
The railway starts down here
in Singapore. Malaya...

778
01:19:23,345 --> 01:19:28,021
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea
is to drive on through, into India.

779
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:31,575
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.

780
01:19:31,825 --> 01:19:36,580
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-
Rangoon section by the middle of May.

781
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:38,821
We'll try to prevent them.

782
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,784
It's too far for bombers
to carry a load.

783
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:44,215
We'll have to go smash it
on the ground.

784
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:46,979
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.

785
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:49,983
With demolition equipment
through that jungle?

786
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:54,419
Our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge.

787
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:57,099
You see, none of us have
ever been there.

788
01:19:57,345 --> 01:20:00,417
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.

789
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:05,375
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.

790
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:07,578
Lucky you.

791
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:11,584
Sure you won't have tea?

792
01:20:11,785 --> 01:20:16,176
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude,
but I've got a date at 2.

793
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:19,974
- Lf there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.

794
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:25,583
Well, there is only
one question, actually.

795
01:20:25,985 --> 01:20:28,180
How would you feel about going back?

796
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,335
Come again?

797
01:20:32,465 --> 01:20:35,059
Under the circumstances
it's a bit much...

798
01:20:35,265 --> 01:20:38,302
...but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose.

799
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:40,263
We'd love to have you with us.

800
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:44,415
That's why you brought me here?

801
01:20:44,665 --> 01:20:46,098
To ask me this?

802
01:20:46,345 --> 01:20:47,983
Well, frankly, yes.

803
01:20:48,185 --> 01:20:49,823
I just got out of there.

804
01:20:50,065 --> 01:20:53,978
My escape was a miracle. Now
you want me to go back! Ridiculous!

805
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:55,413
This is embarrassing...

806
01:20:55,665 --> 01:20:59,180
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.

807
01:20:59,425 --> 01:21:03,179
Actually, Col. Green has taken
the matter up with your people.

808
01:21:03,385 --> 01:21:07,060
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.

809
01:21:07,545 --> 01:21:10,901
A signal arrived yesterday morning
from the Pacific...

810
01:21:11,145 --> 01:21:15,024
...authorizing your temporary transfer
of duty to Force 316.

811
01:21:15,265 --> 01:21:17,938
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.

812
01:21:18,745 --> 01:21:20,815
It was hard to break it to you.

813
01:21:21,065 --> 01:21:25,377
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake!

814
01:21:28,185 --> 01:21:32,980
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

815
01:21:33,265 --> 01:21:38,180
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just
an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

816
01:21:40,665 --> 01:21:44,499
<i>When the Houston sunk, I made
it ashore with a real commander.</i>

817
01:21:44,745 --> 01:21:47,782
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.

818
01:21:47,985 --> 01:21:51,182
I figured it was just
a matter of time till l...

819
01:21:51,425 --> 01:21:54,145
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

820
01:21:54,585 --> 01:21:58,180
I thought officers would get better
treatment in prison camps.

821
01:21:58,425 --> 01:22:01,861
But with Saito, the officers
worked along with the rest.

822
01:22:02,105 --> 01:22:04,539
There's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

823
01:22:06,585 --> 01:22:09,816
I kind of got used
to being a commander...

824
01:22:10,065 --> 01:22:12,215
...so when I arrived
at the hospital...

825
01:22:12,465 --> 01:22:17,380
...I took a look at the enlisted men's
ward and then the officer's ward...

826
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:22,016
...and I said to myself, " Let's let
it ride along for a while."

827
01:22:22,265 --> 01:22:23,903
There were certain advantages.

828
01:22:24,145 --> 01:22:25,897
I saw one of them on the beach.

829
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:28,218
That's the whole story.

830
01:22:28,465 --> 01:22:32,219
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer...

831
01:22:32,465 --> 01:22:35,218
...an American Commander Shears
who doesn't exist.

832
01:22:35,465 --> 01:22:37,820
When the Navy learns the truth,
they'll say:

833
01:22:38,025 --> 01:22:40,744
"Ship him home
for impersonating an officer."

834
01:22:41,465 --> 01:22:44,377
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?

835
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,980
Made! I'd like that drink now.

836
01:22:48,185 --> 01:22:50,335
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

837
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:55,295
I'll say I impersonated an officer
because I went crazy in the jungle.

838
01:22:56,705 --> 01:23:00,380
I'm getting worse. Sometimes
I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

839
01:23:01,105 --> 01:23:02,743
It's quite a clever plan.

840
01:23:03,785 --> 01:23:05,935
Not only clever, it's foolproof.

841
01:23:06,185 --> 01:23:08,415
If my Navy finds out who I am...

842
01:23:08,665 --> 01:23:12,499
...those orders won't be worth
the paper they're written on.

843
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:27,462
Isn't this your photograph?

844
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,944
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing...

845
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:35,494
...since your people
couldn't identify you.

846
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:40,336
Finally your C-in-C Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record.

847
01:23:40,585 --> 01:23:44,419
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?

848
01:23:46,425 --> 01:23:50,498
You see, we've known about your actual
rank for nearly a week.

849
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:55,739
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

850
01:23:55,985 --> 01:23:58,101
In one sense you're a hero...

851
01:23:58,345 --> 01:24:00,905
...for making an escape
from the jungle.

852
01:24:01,105 --> 01:24:03,938
At the same time, they can't
bring you home...

853
01:24:04,145 --> 01:24:07,501
...and give you the Navy Cross for
impersonating an officer.

854
01:24:07,705 --> 01:24:10,936
I suppose that's why they were
happy to hand you over.

855
01:24:11,185 --> 01:24:12,698
You see?

856
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:13,974
Hot potato.

857
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:17,101
As far as your rank is concerned...

858
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:20,342
...we're fairly informal
about that in Force 316.

859
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:22,860
You'd have the simulated
rank of major.

860
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:27,700
A simulated major. That figures.

861
01:24:29,185 --> 01:24:30,504
Well...

862
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:36,865
As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.

863
01:24:37,785 --> 01:24:38,979
Good show!

864
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:42,023
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

865
01:24:42,265 --> 01:24:47,180
This is Major Shears. He volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge.

866
01:24:47,585 --> 01:24:48,904
Really?

867
01:24:49,945 --> 01:24:51,537
Good show!

868
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:54,504
Jolly good show, major!

869
01:25:41,905 --> 01:25:44,578
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.

870
01:25:44,825 --> 01:25:46,816
Colonel might think I'm malingering.

871
01:25:47,065 --> 01:25:49,704
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!

872
01:25:55,265 --> 01:25:58,894
Will someone tell me why
he wants to build a proper bridge?

873
01:25:59,145 --> 01:26:02,501
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.

874
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:16,498
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.

875
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:19,221
Fine job our chaps are doing.

876
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:21,695
Yes. How's he behaving?

877
01:26:21,945 --> 01:26:24,539
He's been most reasonable
since we took over.

878
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:27,538
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.

879
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:29,696
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.

880
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:31,704
What do you think?

881
01:26:33,345 --> 01:26:35,097
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

882
01:26:37,185 --> 01:26:41,337
Are you convinced that building
this bridge is a good idea?

883
01:26:41,585 --> 01:26:43,098
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.

884
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:46,894
A good idea? Take another look.

885
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:51,539
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?

886
01:26:51,785 --> 01:26:53,741
Their condition has improved?

887
01:26:53,985 --> 01:26:56,419
Are they a happier lot
or aren't they?

888
01:26:56,665 --> 01:26:59,896
They feed better
and they are no longer abused.

889
01:27:00,145 --> 01:27:04,138
Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when I don't understand you at all.

890
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,216
I'll try to make myself clear.

891
01:27:06,465 --> 01:27:10,174
The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as...

892
01:27:10,385 --> 01:27:13,297
...forgive me, sir,
collaboration with the enemy.

893
01:27:13,545 --> 01:27:15,103
Perhaps even treason.

894
01:27:15,305 --> 01:27:19,218
We're prisoners of war. We haven't
the right to refuse to work.

895
01:27:19,465 --> 01:27:22,543
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?

896
01:27:22,785 --> 01:27:25,697
Must we do better
than they could themselves?

897
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:30,903
If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?

898
01:27:31,865 --> 01:27:34,538
Would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness?

899
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:37,504
Or have it said
we can't do a proper job?

900
01:27:37,705 --> 01:27:42,495
It's important to show them they
can't break us in body or in spirit.

901
01:27:42,785 --> 01:27:44,901
Take a good look, Clipton.

902
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:47,696
One day the war will be over.

903
01:27:47,905 --> 01:27:51,022
I hope that those who use the bridge
in years to come...

904
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:54,337
...will remember how it was built,
and who built it.

905
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:59,500
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.

906
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:02,135
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor...

907
01:28:02,385 --> 01:28:05,104
...but you've a lot to learn
about the army.

908
01:28:27,865 --> 01:28:29,344
Hold him! Hold him!

909
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:33,498
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?

910
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:41,904
Good morning!

911
01:28:55,065 --> 01:28:57,898
What on earth
are you people staring at?

912
01:29:00,745 --> 01:29:02,497
Get him with your boot!

913
01:29:14,585 --> 01:29:16,018
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

914
01:29:16,265 --> 01:29:19,940
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?

915
01:29:20,185 --> 01:29:22,699
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.

916
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:26,139
Very ingenious. Warden was right.

917
01:29:26,385 --> 01:29:27,704
Sit down.

918
01:29:28,385 --> 01:29:32,537
I asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team.

919
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:35,345
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.

920
01:29:35,985 --> 01:29:38,624
Chapman wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts.

921
01:29:38,865 --> 01:29:42,494
He has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.

922
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:43,734
I've told you...

923
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:48,217
...in this job, even when it's finished
there's always one more thing to do.

924
01:29:48,465 --> 01:29:50,740
He's the best swimmer in the school.

925
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:55,103
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.

926
01:29:58,465 --> 01:30:00,296
All right, at ease.

927
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:08,375
These men are thinking of taking you
for a hike in the jungle.

928
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:09,899
Yes, sir.

929
01:30:10,545 --> 01:30:12,695
You were an accountant in Montreal?

930
01:30:12,945 --> 01:30:15,015
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant.

931
01:30:15,265 --> 01:30:17,301
That is, I didn't have my charter.

932
01:30:17,505 --> 01:30:18,858
Exactly what did you do?

933
01:30:19,105 --> 01:30:22,893
Well, sir, I just checked columns
and columns of figures...

934
01:30:23,145 --> 01:30:25,500
...which people had checked
before me...

935
01:30:25,705 --> 01:30:29,015
...and other people checked them
after I had checked them.

936
01:30:29,265 --> 01:30:32,337
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.

937
01:30:32,585 --> 01:30:34,098
How did you wind up here?

938
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:39,220
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.

939
01:30:39,545 --> 01:30:43,060
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir. See, the regular Army...

940
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:44,863
Go ahead, you can be frank.

941
01:30:45,265 --> 01:30:50,134
Well, the regular Army reminded me
of my job in civilian life.

942
01:30:50,385 --> 01:30:52,501
They don't expect you to think.

943
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,297
Think about this.

944
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:59,418
Are you sure you'd be able
to use it in cold blood?

945
01:30:59,865 --> 01:31:01,093
I know how to use it.

946
01:31:01,345 --> 01:31:05,179
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?

947
01:31:05,425 --> 01:31:07,700
Could you kill without hesitation?

948
01:31:08,705 --> 01:31:13,620
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.

949
01:31:14,065 --> 01:31:15,703
And what was the answer?

950
01:31:16,105 --> 01:31:18,096
I don't honestly know, sir.

951
01:31:18,785 --> 01:31:21,299
I've tried to imagine myself...

952
01:31:23,065 --> 01:31:26,899
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.

953
01:31:27,585 --> 01:31:29,462
It's an old army problem.

954
01:31:30,065 --> 01:31:33,102
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.

955
01:31:35,585 --> 01:31:36,984
Am I to go with the team?

956
01:31:38,425 --> 01:31:39,653
We'll let you know.

957
01:31:46,985 --> 01:31:48,100
You see what I mean.

958
01:31:48,305 --> 01:31:50,136
Well, at least he was honest.

959
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:54,697
None of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises.

960
01:31:55,105 --> 01:31:57,096
What's your opinion, Shears?

961
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:59,218
Well, he's Canadian.

962
01:31:59,425 --> 01:32:03,304
That fits with the international
composition of this outfit.

963
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:06,015
If he wants to go,
he can take my place!

964
01:32:06,785 --> 01:32:10,141
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.

965
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,737
I had an air reconnaissance
report on the village.

966
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,818
There's enough clearing
to make your jump at dusk.

967
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:20,137
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.

968
01:32:20,345 --> 01:32:22,939
Blast! This is awkward.

969
01:32:23,185 --> 01:32:25,301
Silly, it never occurred to me!

970
01:32:25,825 --> 01:32:26,860
Well, maybe...

971
01:32:27,105 --> 01:32:29,903
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.

972
01:32:30,145 --> 01:32:31,942
I'll go check right away.

973
01:32:32,185 --> 01:32:35,097
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.

974
01:32:37,345 --> 01:32:39,540
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

975
01:32:39,785 --> 01:32:41,104
Yes, sir.

976
01:32:41,345 --> 01:32:43,905
You don't realize what a plum you are.

977
01:32:44,145 --> 01:32:47,501
Your knowledge of the area,
making friends in that village.

978
01:32:47,705 --> 01:32:51,698
It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.

979
01:32:54,385 --> 01:32:58,697
By the way, here's something that'll
interest you. The new "L" pill.

980
01:32:59,705 --> 01:33:03,095
- L pill?
- L for lethal. Instant, painless.

981
01:33:03,305 --> 01:33:06,502
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.

982
01:33:06,705 --> 01:33:09,139
You're telling me
not to be taken alive.

983
01:33:09,385 --> 01:33:11,103
I wouldn't recommend it.

984
01:33:11,585 --> 01:33:15,624
If any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind.

985
01:33:15,865 --> 01:33:18,095
The objective comes first in our work.

986
01:33:18,745 --> 01:33:23,136
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.

987
01:33:23,385 --> 01:33:25,103
I understand, go ahead.

988
01:33:26,505 --> 01:33:29,622
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.

989
01:33:29,865 --> 01:33:32,504
Joyce is... He'll be okay.

990
01:33:32,745 --> 01:33:35,305
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh? Why not?

991
01:33:35,505 --> 01:33:37,177
Cambridge don and all of that.

992
01:33:37,385 --> 01:33:40,821
It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers...

993
01:33:41,065 --> 01:33:43,295
He's not without experience, you know.

994
01:33:44,145 --> 01:33:47,933
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind
to blow up a couple of bridges.

995
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:51,302
Many other installations
before the Japs caught him.

996
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:54,901
- Fascinating story. He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.

997
01:33:55,145 --> 01:33:59,536
In view of time, they don't think
practice jumps would be worth it.

998
01:33:59,785 --> 01:34:03,539
<i>If you make one jump there's
only a 50% chance of injury.</i>

999
01:34:03,785 --> 01:34:07,221
<i>Two jumps, 80%. Three jumps,
you're bound to get your packet.</i>

1000
01:34:07,465 --> 01:34:11,219
The consensus is, the most
sensible thing for Shears to do...

1001
01:34:11,425 --> 01:34:14,303
...is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.

1002
01:34:14,545 --> 01:34:16,501
With or without parachute?

1003
01:34:21,385 --> 01:34:23,501
Oh, very good!

1004
01:34:26,945 --> 01:34:28,503
With or without!

1005
01:35:23,345 --> 01:35:24,334
He's in the trees!

1006
01:36:01,745 --> 01:36:04,305
Yai says we can't
reach the Kwai your way.

1007
01:36:04,505 --> 01:36:08,545
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

1008
01:36:08,985 --> 01:36:10,941
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.

1009
01:36:11,185 --> 01:36:13,619
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.

1010
01:36:13,865 --> 01:36:16,504
Which means we shall have to
use women bearers.

1011
01:36:16,745 --> 01:36:18,815
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.

1012
01:36:30,145 --> 01:36:33,103
He says it's dangerous
to spend the night here.

1013
01:36:33,345 --> 01:36:37,338
There's an enemy post three miles away
so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

1014
01:36:37,585 --> 01:36:42,101
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.

1015
01:36:42,345 --> 01:36:43,903
Is there something wrong?

1016
01:36:44,985 --> 01:36:49,536
I was just thinking. You speak
Yai's language. I don't.

1017
01:36:49,785 --> 01:36:53,619
He's going to lead you
to the river by a route I never took.

1018
01:36:53,865 --> 01:36:57,335
Will someone tell me why I'm
so indispensable to this outfit?

1019
01:36:57,585 --> 01:37:01,703
I know how you feel, but there's
always the unexpected, isn't there?

1020
01:37:02,265 --> 01:37:03,903
Tell that to Chapman.

1021
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,698
Let's get cracking!

1022
01:40:02,105 --> 01:40:03,697
You're lovely.

1023
01:40:06,145 --> 01:40:07,339
Lovely.

1024
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:09,701
Be happy in your work!

1025
01:40:09,985 --> 01:40:11,100
Yes, sir.

1026
01:40:37,385 --> 01:40:38,704
Leeches.

1027
01:40:39,265 --> 01:40:40,698
Leeches.

1028
01:40:55,385 --> 01:40:59,298
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.

1029
01:40:59,665 --> 01:41:01,895
What's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

1030
01:41:02,145 --> 01:41:04,534
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1031
01:41:04,785 --> 01:41:08,141
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.

1032
01:41:08,345 --> 01:41:09,744
What's wrong with that thing?

1033
01:41:09,985 --> 01:41:13,500
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.

1034
01:41:13,745 --> 01:41:18,660
I'll tell you. It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.

1035
01:41:19,065 --> 01:41:20,703
You might as well dump it!

1036
01:41:25,585 --> 01:41:27,701
<i>This is Radio Tokio signing off.</i>

1037
01:41:27,905 --> 01:41:32,217
<i>This is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy...</i>

1038
01:41:32,465 --> 01:41:34,899
<i>... and never volunteer for anything.</i>

1039
01:41:47,545 --> 01:41:49,501
If we stay, we'll
be up to our necks.

1040
01:41:49,705 --> 01:41:51,900
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!

1041
01:41:52,145 --> 01:41:55,820
Yes, sir. "One, original
bridge works reported abandoned.

1042
01:41:56,025 --> 01:41:58,539
New construction downstream
from first site.

1043
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:02,698
Two, enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train...

1044
01:42:02,905 --> 01:42:05,738
...Bangkok for Rangoon
with troops and V.I.P.

1045
01:42:05,985 --> 01:42:08,499
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.

1046
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:11,742
Three, synchronize demolition
with passage of train.

1047
01:42:11,985 --> 01:42:14,977
Four, good hunting. Have fun."
That's all.

1048
01:42:15,225 --> 01:42:16,943
A train and a bridge!

1049
01:42:17,185 --> 01:42:19,301
Can we get there in time, sir?

1050
01:42:19,505 --> 01:42:21,860
Yai says we're two to three days away.

1051
01:42:22,105 --> 01:42:26,018
If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 12th.

1052
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,096
It's worth it for the train.

1053
01:42:28,345 --> 01:42:31,496
Oh, by all means. Good hunting.
Good show.

1054
01:42:31,705 --> 01:42:33,616
Jolly good fun. Jolly good.

1055
01:42:34,705 --> 01:42:38,015
If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.

1056
01:42:38,265 --> 01:42:40,904
There's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

1057
01:43:05,025 --> 01:43:07,414
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.

1058
01:43:09,065 --> 01:43:11,625
Well, we'll complete this later.

1059
01:43:12,465 --> 01:43:15,821
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?

1060
01:43:16,785 --> 01:43:20,664
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.

1061
01:43:20,905 --> 01:43:22,418
We haven't the manpower.

1062
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:25,822
I've asked the officers to help,
but that won't do it.

1063
01:43:26,065 --> 01:43:27,578
The officers are working?

1064
01:43:27,825 --> 01:43:31,420
I explained the situation and they
volunteered, but it's not enough.

1065
01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:33,337
Why not ask Saito for some men?

1066
01:43:33,585 --> 01:43:36,463
This is ours. We'll make the most
of our resources.

1067
01:43:36,705 --> 01:43:39,458
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.

1068
01:43:39,705 --> 01:43:43,334
There's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.

1069
01:43:43,585 --> 01:43:48,056
It's no reflection on you, but
there are always a few malingerers.

1070
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:50,614
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.

1071
01:43:50,865 --> 01:43:52,617
Come along, let's see.

1072
01:43:54,025 --> 01:43:55,822
Don't move, don't move.

1073
01:43:59,465 --> 01:44:01,023
What's wrong with Haskins?

1074
01:44:01,265 --> 01:44:04,735
Amoebic dysentery and black
water fever. Temperature of 104.

1075
01:44:04,985 --> 01:44:06,418
Right. I see.

1076
01:44:09,385 --> 01:44:10,534
And this man?

1077
01:44:10,785 --> 01:44:14,539
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save it
if I do more cutting tonight.

1078
01:44:14,785 --> 01:44:16,662
Want to send him out to work?

1079
01:44:16,905 --> 01:44:18,623
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1080
01:44:22,905 --> 01:44:23,940
That man there?

1081
01:44:24,185 --> 01:44:25,334
His arm's infected.

1082
01:44:25,585 --> 01:44:27,815
Most of their wounds
won't heal properly.

1083
01:44:28,025 --> 01:44:32,735
I wonder if fresh air and light duties
might do more than being cooped up.

1084
01:44:32,985 --> 01:44:35,863
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...

1085
01:44:36,105 --> 01:44:39,745
...just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?

1086
01:44:39,985 --> 01:44:43,819
A man may not be on top of his form,
but he can still be useful.

1087
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:47,535
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.

1088
01:44:47,785 --> 01:44:51,221
Do you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?

1089
01:44:52,785 --> 01:44:55,219
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.

1090
01:44:56,465 --> 01:44:57,864
You? Nothing difficult.

1091
01:44:58,105 --> 01:45:00,414
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

1092
01:45:02,105 --> 01:45:06,656
Look here, men. It goes without
saying that I'm proud of all of you.

1093
01:45:06,905 --> 01:45:11,262
But we're facing a crisis. For those
of you who feel up to it...

1094
01:45:11,505 --> 01:45:15,418
...how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1095
01:45:15,665 --> 01:45:17,018
What do you say?

1096
01:45:17,225 --> 01:45:20,695
- Yes, sir.
- Good show. Come on, follow me.

1097
01:46:59,065 --> 01:47:00,054
Ten minutes.

1098
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:55,062
Make sure they're all dead.

1099
01:48:58,385 --> 01:48:59,704
Come on, Joyce.

1100
01:49:01,825 --> 01:49:04,339
Use your knife
or we'll be shooting each other.

1101
01:49:16,145 --> 01:49:17,737
Go that way, Joyce.

1102
01:51:20,905 --> 01:51:23,624
I could have done it.
I was ready.

1103
01:51:27,945 --> 01:51:29,264
Are you hit, sir?

1104
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:30,853
Let's go.

1105
01:51:51,345 --> 01:51:54,894
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped
bone, but nothing broken.

1106
01:51:55,145 --> 01:51:57,181
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.

1107
01:51:57,425 --> 01:51:59,814
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.

1108
01:52:00,025 --> 01:52:01,697
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1109
01:52:01,905 --> 01:52:04,465
We won't know that
till I've tried it, will we?

1110
01:55:09,065 --> 01:55:10,657
What are you doing?

1111
01:55:11,105 --> 01:55:13,096
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1112
01:55:13,305 --> 01:55:14,704
We all need it.

1113
01:55:18,625 --> 01:55:22,015
We're still five hours' fast march
from the objective.

1114
01:55:22,225 --> 01:55:23,499
Maybe six.

1115
01:55:24,505 --> 01:55:25,620
Come on.

1116
01:55:25,825 --> 01:55:28,259
If you keep walking,
you'll bleed to death.

1117
01:55:35,545 --> 01:55:38,457
- You're going to leave me here.
- Lf you stop, we stop.

1118
01:55:39,345 --> 01:55:41,859
You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.

1119
01:55:42,065 --> 01:55:44,101
You've got to get there
before sundown.

1120
01:55:44,305 --> 01:55:48,776
But, sir, when the job's done, who
knows if we can return by this route...

1121
01:55:49,025 --> 01:55:51,061
...or whether we could find you
if we did?

1122
01:55:51,305 --> 01:55:54,695
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate
to leave you and you know that.

1123
01:55:55,105 --> 01:55:56,299
He doesn't know, but I do.

1124
01:55:56,545 --> 01:55:59,855
You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.

1125
01:56:00,545 --> 01:56:03,855
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.

1126
01:56:04,065 --> 01:56:06,260
You're in command now, Shears.

1127
01:56:08,905 --> 01:56:10,657
I won't obey that order.

1128
01:56:11,225 --> 01:56:12,704
Your heroics make me sick.

1129
01:56:12,905 --> 01:56:15,578
You carry the stench of death
like the plague.

1130
01:56:15,825 --> 01:56:17,941
Explosives and L-pills
go well together.

1131
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:21,615
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1132
01:56:21,945 --> 01:56:23,583
This is just a game, this war.

1133
01:56:23,825 --> 01:56:27,579
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage. For what?

1134
01:56:27,825 --> 01:56:30,658
How to die like a gentleman,
how to die by the rules...

1135
01:56:30,865 --> 01:56:34,460
...when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being!

1136
01:56:38,305 --> 01:56:41,058
I'm not gonna leave you
here to die, Warden...

1137
01:56:42,345 --> 01:56:46,054
...because I don't care about
your bridge or about your rules.

1138
01:56:46,505 --> 01:56:49,065
If we go on, we go on together.

1139
01:56:51,865 --> 01:56:53,457
Good old Yai.

1140
01:57:04,945 --> 01:57:06,060
All right.

1141
01:57:16,305 --> 01:57:17,533
Come on.

1142
01:58:05,025 --> 01:58:06,424
Let's get closer.

1143
01:58:25,145 --> 01:58:27,261
Still sorry we brought you along?

1144
01:58:28,865 --> 01:58:30,696
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1145
01:58:30,905 --> 01:58:33,055
You're in command again, you know.

1146
01:58:33,265 --> 01:58:34,857
Thank you, major.

1147
01:58:35,705 --> 01:58:40,495
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.

1148
01:58:43,105 --> 01:58:45,858
Not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together.

1149
01:58:46,185 --> 01:58:47,379
Look.

1150
01:58:49,145 --> 01:58:51,101
Those poor devils down there.

1151
01:58:51,345 --> 01:58:55,020
Imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in.

1152
01:58:56,105 --> 01:58:58,983
They've got a British officer
working on his knees.

1153
01:58:59,225 --> 01:59:01,216
The Japanese seem
to be enjoying it too.

1154
01:59:02,345 --> 01:59:05,064
If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale.

1155
01:59:23,745 --> 01:59:26,785
If not for the train, we could
set a time fuse and be miles away.

1156
01:59:27,185 --> 01:59:29,904
Since we don't know
what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1157
01:59:30,145 --> 01:59:32,303
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1158
01:59:32,905 --> 01:59:35,544
We'll set the charges
against the piles...

1159
01:59:35,785 --> 01:59:39,141
...about three feet underwater,
I should think...

1160
01:59:39,385 --> 01:59:42,582
...and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger.

1161
01:59:43,785 --> 01:59:46,504
The problem is where to hide it.

1162
01:59:51,465 --> 01:59:54,377
Our side of the river is
obviously used by the Japanese.

1163
01:59:54,705 --> 01:59:56,502
They'd spot it at once.

1164
02:00:00,185 --> 02:00:03,222
Look. Do you see
those fallen tree trunks?

1165
02:00:03,465 --> 02:00:06,616
And the grey rock just below them
on that little beach?

1166
02:00:07,185 --> 02:00:10,541
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.

1167
02:00:11,545 --> 02:00:13,058
The wrong side of the river...

1168
02:00:13,305 --> 02:00:16,741
...but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.

1169
02:00:18,145 --> 02:00:20,136
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1170
02:00:20,585 --> 02:00:23,338
...whoever's there
will have to swim back.

1171
02:00:23,545 --> 02:00:25,456
It won't be a pleasant swim.

1172
02:00:25,705 --> 02:00:28,139
Sir, I was the best swimmer
in my course.

1173
02:00:30,905 --> 02:00:33,180
It looks like
your line of country, then.

1174
02:00:33,385 --> 02:00:34,181
Thank you.

1175
02:00:34,385 --> 02:00:38,060
Shears, pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1176
02:00:38,305 --> 02:00:41,103
Yai will be with you
so you can occupy the Nips...

1177
02:00:41,305 --> 02:00:43,375
...if they make trouble for Joyce.

1178
02:00:43,625 --> 02:00:45,980
On the theory that
there's always one more thing...

1179
02:00:46,225 --> 02:00:50,457
...l'll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversión.

1180
02:00:50,705 --> 02:00:53,936
Perhaps I might even take
a few potshots at the train.

1181
02:00:54,185 --> 02:00:55,379
All clear?

1182
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:58,776
Any questions? Right, you'll
start as soon as it's dark.

1183
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:01,704
They're sure to have
sentries on the bridge...

1184
02:01:01,905 --> 02:01:05,580
...so you'll have to float
the stuff down from upriver...

1185
02:01:05,825 --> 02:01:07,577
...which means building a raft.

1186
02:01:07,785 --> 02:01:08,774
Yai.

1187
02:01:13,585 --> 02:01:15,940
Yai will take three women to help you.

1188
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:19,143
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!

1189
02:01:24,185 --> 02:01:28,337
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1190
02:01:28,945 --> 02:01:30,742
You think he'll be all right?

1191
02:01:31,025 --> 02:01:33,334
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1192
02:01:33,905 --> 02:01:36,738
I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if I could.

1193
02:01:37,345 --> 02:01:38,539
I'm sorry.

1194
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:41,659
When it's over, I hope
you get that medical discharge...

1195
02:01:41,865 --> 02:01:43,742
...and not the hard way.

1196
02:01:43,945 --> 02:01:45,139
Thanks.

1197
02:02:21,745 --> 02:02:22,734
Load.

1198
02:03:25,865 --> 02:03:27,093
Beautiful.

1199
02:03:27,825 --> 02:03:29,417
Yes, beautiful.

1200
02:03:29,705 --> 02:03:31,423
A first-rate job.

1201
02:03:31,865 --> 02:03:34,220
I had no idea it would
turn out so well.

1202
02:03:39,385 --> 02:03:41,615
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1203
02:03:42,785 --> 02:03:44,218
I've been thinking...

1204
02:03:45,185 --> 02:03:49,622
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that I've been in the service.

1205
02:03:49,905 --> 02:03:52,419
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

1206
02:03:53,665 --> 02:03:57,214
I haven't been at home more
than ten months in all that time.

1207
02:03:57,785 --> 02:04:00,015
Still, it's been a good life.

1208
02:04:01,305 --> 02:04:03,341
I love India.

1209
02:04:04,865 --> 02:04:07,015
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1210
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:10,263
But there are times...

1211
02:04:11,865 --> 02:04:16,017
Suddenly you realize you are
nearer the end than the beginning.

1212
02:04:16,985 --> 02:04:18,464
And you wonder...

1213
02:04:20,065 --> 02:04:22,021
You ask yourself...

1214
02:04:23,305 --> 02:04:26,422
...what the sum total
of your life represents...

1215
02:04:27,185 --> 02:04:30,621
...what difference your being there
at any time made to anything...

1216
02:04:31,105 --> 02:04:33,619
...or if it made any difference
at all, really.

1217
02:04:35,185 --> 02:04:38,416
Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.

1218
02:04:39,065 --> 02:04:41,454
I don't know if that
kind of thinking's healthy...

1219
02:04:42,025 --> 02:04:45,654
...but I must admit I've had
some thoughts on those lines...

1220
02:04:45,905 --> 02:04:47,816
...from time to time.

1221
02:04:50,785 --> 02:04:52,423
But tonight...

1222
02:04:53,825 --> 02:04:54,814
Tonight...

1223
02:04:58,425 --> 02:04:59,824
Blast.

1224
02:05:06,465 --> 02:05:07,864
I must be off.

1225
02:05:10,585 --> 02:05:13,816
The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.

1226
02:05:58,785 --> 02:06:00,013
Lovely.

1227
02:08:03,665 --> 02:08:06,816
<i>If you were the only</i>

1228
02:08:07,025 --> 02:08:09,664
<i>Girl in the worid</i>

1229
02:08:09,865 --> 02:08:14,780
<i>And you were the only boy</i>

1230
02:08:15,185 --> 02:08:17,460
<i>Nothing else would matter</i>

1231
02:08:17,665 --> 02:08:20,623
<i>In the worid today</i>

1232
02:08:21,105 --> 02:08:23,061
<i>We could go on loving</i>

1233
02:08:23,265 --> 02:08:26,337
<i>In the same old way</i>

1234
02:08:26,905 --> 02:08:31,820
<i>A Garden of Eden just made for two</i>

1235
02:12:54,505 --> 02:12:56,257
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1236
02:12:56,465 --> 02:12:59,423
...when I say this has been
a most enjoyable evening.

1237
02:13:01,105 --> 02:13:06,020
Most of you move on tomorrow
to a new camp and new construction.

1238
02:13:06,465 --> 02:13:10,617
It's a pity you won't see the first
practical use of this bridge.

1239
02:13:10,865 --> 02:13:13,425
You'll be glad to know
that the completion...

1240
02:13:13,665 --> 02:13:15,781
...of this link in the railway...

1241
02:13:15,985 --> 02:13:19,216
...will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled...

1242
02:13:19,465 --> 02:13:22,423
...to the new camp by train.

1243
02:13:23,985 --> 02:13:26,818
Colonel Saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind...

1244
02:13:27,025 --> 02:13:29,255
...with Major Clipton
and the sick men...

1245
02:13:29,505 --> 02:13:32,861
...and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.

1246
02:13:34,825 --> 02:13:37,825
<i>Now that your work here is finished...</i>

1247
02:13:38,065 --> 02:13:41,944
<i>... I suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.</i>

1248
02:13:42,705 --> 02:13:44,616
That's quite understandable.

1249
02:13:44,905 --> 02:13:47,419
It's a very natural reaction.

1250
02:13:49,705 --> 02:13:52,822
But one day, in a week,
a month, a year...

1251
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:56,700
...on that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again...

1252
02:13:57,385 --> 02:14:02,300
...you're going to feel very proud
of what you've achieved here...

1253
02:14:02,625 --> 02:14:05,219
...in the face of great adversity.

1254
02:14:06,385 --> 02:14:08,421
What you have done should be...

1255
02:14:09,265 --> 02:14:11,017
...and I think will be...

1256
02:14:11,385 --> 02:14:15,822
...an example to all our countrymen,
soldier and civilian alike.

1257
02:14:16,985 --> 02:14:19,419
You have survived with honour.

1258
02:14:20,305 --> 02:14:22,023
That, and more.

1259
02:14:23,585 --> 02:14:25,621
Here in the wilderness...

1260
02:14:25,905 --> 02:14:29,215
...you have turned defeat
into victory.

1261
02:14:31,865 --> 02:14:33,821
I congratulate you.

1262
02:14:34,345 --> 02:14:35,334
Well done.

1263
02:14:40,505 --> 02:14:41,733
To the king.

1264
02:17:17,465 --> 02:17:18,864
You're in business.

1265
02:17:19,065 --> 02:17:23,024
Now, you got everything? Stem,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1266
02:17:24,625 --> 02:17:26,820
I'll be directly across the river.

1267
02:17:28,225 --> 02:17:31,023
The professor says there's
always one more thing to do.

1268
02:17:31,705 --> 02:17:33,821
I can't think of what it could be.

1269
02:17:35,185 --> 02:17:37,619
Except to wish you
a long and happy life.

1270
02:17:38,025 --> 02:17:39,060
Thank you.

1271
02:19:49,225 --> 02:19:50,624
What's happened?

1272
02:19:55,585 --> 02:19:57,257
The river's gone down.

1273
02:20:18,585 --> 02:20:20,416
You can see the wire.

1274
02:20:21,225 --> 02:20:22,453
The charges!

1275
02:22:25,505 --> 02:22:27,814
Don't wait for the train.

1276
02:22:28,105 --> 02:22:29,140
Do it now!

1277
02:22:55,585 --> 02:22:59,260
If Saito is correct, the train
will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.

1278
02:22:59,505 --> 02:23:02,144
If you don't mind,
I'll watch from up on the hill.

1279
02:23:02,385 --> 02:23:04,216
Why? It's better from the bridge.

1280
02:23:04,465 --> 02:23:07,821
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.

1281
02:23:08,065 --> 02:23:12,217
As you please. Honestly, sometimes
I don't understand you at all.

1282
02:23:12,465 --> 02:23:16,617
As you once said, sir, I've got
a lot to learn about the army.

1283
02:23:23,305 --> 02:23:24,624
Good morning.

1284
02:23:24,865 --> 02:23:27,015
River's gone down in the night.

1285
02:25:07,465 --> 02:25:08,580
What's he doing?

1286
02:25:53,465 --> 02:25:56,457
Colonel, there's something
rather odd going on.

1287
02:25:56,705 --> 02:26:00,220
I think we better have a look around
before that train comes across.

1288
02:26:56,665 --> 02:26:58,018
He's gone mad.

1289
02:26:58,225 --> 02:27:00,216
He's leading him right to it!

1290
02:27:00,465 --> 02:27:01,818
Our own man!

1291
02:27:44,225 --> 02:27:47,023
I was right. There is
something going on.

1292
02:28:39,905 --> 02:28:43,102
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!

1293
02:28:45,825 --> 02:28:49,613
Have you a knife? I just realized
the bridge has been mined!

1294
02:28:49,825 --> 02:28:51,217
Mined!

1295
02:28:57,825 --> 02:28:58,860
Good boy!

1296
02:29:03,625 --> 02:29:06,264
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.

1297
02:29:06,505 --> 02:29:10,464
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir. British commando orders.

1298
02:29:10,705 --> 02:29:13,219
- Blow up the bridge?!
- Yes. There's no time!

1299
02:29:13,425 --> 02:29:15,780
No, no! Help!

1300
02:29:22,745 --> 02:29:24,940
Kill him! Kill him!

1301
02:29:25,305 --> 02:29:27,660
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!

1302
02:29:28,665 --> 02:29:31,418
Kill him! Kill him!

1303
02:29:41,305 --> 02:29:43,023
Kill him, Joyce!

1304
02:30:34,305 --> 02:30:35,294
You!

1305
02:30:36,265 --> 02:30:37,857
You!

1306
02:30:51,185 --> 02:30:52,857
What have I done?

1307
02:31:58,745 --> 02:32:00,224
Madness!

1308
02:32:12,265 --> 02:32:14,017
I had to do it!

1309
02:32:14,905 --> 02:32:18,022
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!

1310
02:32:18,505 --> 02:32:20,416
It was the only thing to do!

1311
02:32:55,225 --> 02:32:56,624
Madness!

1312
02:32:59,305 --> 02:33:00,454
Madness!

1313
02:35:25,665 --> 02:35:26,654
