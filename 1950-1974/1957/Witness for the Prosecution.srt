1
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,263
(gavel)

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,224
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,978
All persons who have
anything to do before my lords,

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:25,150
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer
and general jail delivery

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,611
for the jurisdiction
of the Central Criminal Court

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:33,366
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

7
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,793
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

8
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:13,008
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

9
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:18,138
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

10
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,766
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

11
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,227
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

12
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:29,983
We've been flat on our back
for two months, we'd better be careful.

13
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:45,331
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the lnns of Court.

14
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,959
How lucky you lawyers are.

15
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,672
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy

16
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,550
and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up.

17
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,720
And then peritonitis set in
and he went like that.

18
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,931
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

19
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,655
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

20
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,949
Oh, shut up!

21
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,118
Williams, my cane.

22
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,418
Here he comes!

23
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,684
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.

24
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,938
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

25
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,234
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

26
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,861
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

27
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,115
Nothing. I'm just happy
that you're your old self again.

28
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,452
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

29
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,164
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know,

30
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,668
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

31
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:16,423
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

32
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,349
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

33
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,395
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.

34
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,773
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

35
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:38,486
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

36
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,365
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

37
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,327
If anything happened to you,
what would happen to me, after 37 years?

38
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,581
37 years! Has it been all that long?

39
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:54,711
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
191 5. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

40
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:59,758
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

41
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:04,888
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.

42
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,809
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

43
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,020
Right here.

44
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,108
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

45
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,111
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.

46
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,907
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.

47
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,039
What's all this?

48
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,752
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

49
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,339
Of course. The solicitors
have been breaking down our doors.

50
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,218
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

51
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,972
Divorce case, a tax appeal,
and an important marine insurance claim.

52
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,434
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

53
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,939
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

54
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,568
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,
tobacco, female companionship.

55
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,321
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

56
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,489
Sorry, sir.

57
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,284
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

58
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,205
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

59
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,626
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,
get undressed and lie down.

60
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,505
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

61
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,174
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,

62
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:28,722
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

63
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:34,811
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

64
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:41,109
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

65
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,281
For four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored, probed,

66
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,535
punctured, pillaged and plundered
my helpless body

67
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,831
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk.

68
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,584
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.

69
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,503
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

70
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,090
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

71
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,594
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

72
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,812
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

73
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,274
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

74
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,152
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

75
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,531
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

76
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,992
No. Upstairs.

77
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,996
A few puffs after meals? Please.

78
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,418
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

79
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,464
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.

80
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:51,054
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

81
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,058
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

82
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,270
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

83
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:04,234
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.

84
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,196
Here you are. Simply press this button
for up and this one for down.

85
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,408
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption should collapse,

86
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,787
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister...

87
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,880
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.

88
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:30,927
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

89
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,610
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

90
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,530
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

91
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:55,410
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

92
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,704
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

93
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,415
Serious criminal matter.

94
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,879
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

95
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,090
He can't accept anything
of an overstimulating nature.

96
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,469
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

97
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,138
Hello. Distressing news about your health.

98
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,933
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

99
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,937
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

100
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:28,568
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

101
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,780
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

102
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,574
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

103
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,952
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

104
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,207
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

105
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,418
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.

106
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:56,638
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.

107
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,934
Mayhew! Mayhew!

108
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,812
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

109
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,482
Don't worry, we won't take the brief,
but an old friend needs help.

110
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,485
Surely I can give him a word of advice.

111
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,531
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

112
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,367
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

113
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,203
You go ahead. Start it without me.

114
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,165
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.

115
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,044
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

116
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,630
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

117
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,967
Seems silly to me,
but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

118
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,054
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

119
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,306
Well, for murder.

120
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,017
Oh!

121
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,854
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.

122
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,816
Middle-aged widow, well-off,
living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

123
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,110
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

124
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,155
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

125
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,532
struck on the back of the head
and killed.

126
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,827
Vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence.

127
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,831
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

128
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,585
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

129
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,756
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

130
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,177
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

131
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,514
The defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

132
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,394
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

133
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,189
This will take all our cunning.

134
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,987
Young man!

135
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,989
Come here, please.

136
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:42,369
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

137
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,621
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

138
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,832
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

139
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,588
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

140
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,675
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

141
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,220
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

142
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:04,849
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

143
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:09,312
Then let's make absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

144
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,525
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

145
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,486
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

146
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,451
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

147
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,372
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

148
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,749
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.

149
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:34,045
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

150
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,382
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

151
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,135
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

152
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,470
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

153
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,724
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

154
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,936
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

155
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,859
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

156
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,988
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

157
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:05,035
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

158
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,080
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

159
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,834
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement

160
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,380
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

161
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,716
Well, it can't be helped now.

162
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,220
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

163
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:28,183
He thinks that he made a statement
and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

164
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:33,229
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

165
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,648
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

166
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:40,028
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

167
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,781
We try not to make a habit of it.

168
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,493
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?

169
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:51,289
Of course. There was that case of
that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

170
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,668
In jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap.

171
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,463
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

172
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,842
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

173
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,763
That's all right for him. What if
it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

174
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,100
How would they have restored him
to his normal life then?

175
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,604
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

176
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,817
It's just when you say these things
are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

177
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:23,613
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

178
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,325
Let's get this straight. I may have done
something highly unethical.

179
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,121
I've taken your cigar
but I'm not taking your case. I can't.

180
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:36,376
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

181
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,421
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

182
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,383
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

183
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:49,055
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

184
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,310
Hold this.

185
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,815
Carter?

186
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,861
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

187
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,947
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

188
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,366
Not even as a nurse during the war.

189
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,287
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

190
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,750
You'll like Brogan-Moore,
he's had excellent training. Under me.

191
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,837
This morning I had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly I have three.

192
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,715
We should explain
that I have very little money.

193
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,176
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

194
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,595
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.

195
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,848
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

196
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,018
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

197
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:40,607
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.

198
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,069
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

199
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,531
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

200
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:53,578
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

201
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:58,416
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

202
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,127
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

203
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:05,840
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

204
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,635
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

205
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:13,390
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

206
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,226
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

207
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,980
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

208
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,193
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

209
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:30,949
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

210
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,285
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

211
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,663
But my best is really this eggbeater.

212
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,250
It not only beats,
it also separates the yolk from the white.

213
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,794
Is that really desirable?

214
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,505
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

215
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,842
The trouble is, I need money
for manufacturing and promotion.

216
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:53,013
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

217
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:58,518
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

218
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,439
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

219
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,400
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,

220
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:10,488
daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,
if I had any money.

221
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,579
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

222
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,248
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

223
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:06,878
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

224
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,839
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

225
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,385
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

226
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,847
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

227
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,182
(squealing brakes)

228
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,143
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

229
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,730
You buy that hat. I insist.

230
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:31,444
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

231
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:35,990
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

232
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,492
Go on, please.

233
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,161
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

234
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,622
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.

235
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,958
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

236
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:50,797
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

237
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,969
(gunfire and action-sequence music)

238
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,323
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

239
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,784
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

240
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,329
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

241
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,665
- May l?
- Sure, if you like.

242
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:34,215
Thank you. It's such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again.

243
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:39,387
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

244
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,015
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

245
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,934
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

246
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,398
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

247
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,736
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

248
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,489
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

249
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,617
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

250
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,912
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.

251
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,874
All I knew was she seemed to be
very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

252
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,794
She and her husband
lived abroad in British Nigeria.

253
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,507
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

254
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,927
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.

255
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,305
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

256
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,850
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea.

257
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,019
(Mrs French laughs)

258
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,733
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

259
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,902
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

260
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,114
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

261
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,283
It must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal, which is it?

262
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,036
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

263
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,289
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

264
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,959
We must have one. Is it expensive?

265
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,504
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

266
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:58,633
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

267
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,388
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

268
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,855
Ha!

269
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:17,110
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

270
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,320
Why not?

271
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,073
This is a charming room.

272
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,536
Hubert and I collected all these things
when we lived in Africa.

273
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,872
Hubert was my husband.

274
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,751
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

275
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,337
That's the mask of the witch doctor.

276
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,964
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

277
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,885
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.

278
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:46,139
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

279
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,475
Oh, here's tea.

280
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:55,648
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

281
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,777
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

282
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,363
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

283
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,531
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

284
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,994
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

285
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,124
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

286
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:18,129
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

287
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,800
Oh, is she? I thought
she came with the collection.

288
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,846
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.

289
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,808
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

290
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:35,689
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

291
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,858
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

292
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,152
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

293
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:45,615
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

294
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,286
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

295
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,455
and unsanitary.

296
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,752
Tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder.

297
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,172
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

298
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,259
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

299
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,471
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

300
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,726
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

301
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,520
How much money did you get
from Mrs French?

302
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,689
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

303
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,609
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

304
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,778
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

305
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,906
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

306
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,826
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

307
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,246
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

308
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,206
- Because...
- Because what?

309
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,960
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

310
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,463
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

311
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,550
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

312
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:49,137
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

313
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,599
Because she was rich,
and you were after her money.

314
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,809
Well, yes, in a way.

315
00:23:55,477 --> 00:24:00,315
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

316
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,693
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?

317
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,987
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?

318
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,823
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

319
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,534
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

320
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,413
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

321
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,416
with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.

322
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,211
Perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries.

323
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:26,007
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

324
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,053
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

325
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,515
I didn't do it. No matter
how bad things look, I didn't do it!

326
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,019
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

327
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,147
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

328
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,734
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

329
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,195
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

330
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,241
As for things looking bad, they
don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

331
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:55,662
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

332
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:59,124
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

333
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,335
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

334
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,590
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

335
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,510
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

336
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,929
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.

337
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:18,309
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

338
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,187
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?

339
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:25,275
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

340
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:31,281
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

341
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:36,286
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

342
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,205
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

343
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,708
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

344
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,252
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

345
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:48,423
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

346
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,842
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

347
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:54,095
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

348
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,390
You will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion, hm?

349
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,268
That leaves us with a murder for profit.

350
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:04,564
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

351
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:09,277
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

352
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,447
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

353
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,995
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

354
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,500
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

355
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,045
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

356
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,007
Oh, we'll simply put a lean
on Mr Vole's £80,000.

357
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:35,512
- What £80,000?
- The £80,000 Mrs French left you.

358
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,805
Left me?

359
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:42,143
They opened Mrs French's
bank vault today and found her will.

360
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:47,315
- Congratulations.
- £80,000!

361
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,985
And I was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater.

362
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,154
I must call Christine.

363
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,743
Oh.

364
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,871
This doesn't make things
look any better for me, does it?

365
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,458
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

366
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:11,131
They will indeed. £80,000 makes for
a very handsome motive.

367
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,967
I thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me!

368
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,094
It's not unlikely.

369
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,597
(car pulls up)

370
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,855
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

371
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:31,526
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

372
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:36,114
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

373
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:40,744
- It's our old friend lnspector Hearne.
- Chief lnspector as of last month.

374
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,539
Chief lnspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

375
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,375
You're getting the de luxe treatment.

376
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,839
- Oh, in here, Chief lnspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

377
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:56,718
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police

378
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:00,722
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

379
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,266
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.

380
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,979
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

381
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,815
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

382
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,613
I have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering Emily French.

383
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:21,743
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

384
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,829
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?

385
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,457
That won't be necessary, sir.

386
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:31,169
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

387
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:35,131
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

388
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:40,595
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

389
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,062
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

390
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,439
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.

391
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,484
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

392
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:58,363
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

393
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:04,411
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

394
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,081
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

395
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:16,381
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

396
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,550
Good day, sir.

397
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,804
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

398
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:27,267
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

399
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,895
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

400
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,858
Of course. The prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery.

401
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:39,571
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

402
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,740
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

403
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:45,869
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

404
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:51,916
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

405
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:55,420
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

406
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,715
Either you take care of yourself
or l, too, shall resign.

407
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,384
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

408
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:05,638
For my first day this has already
been rather hectic. I should be in bed.

409
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:13,605
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

410
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,944
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

411
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:26,242
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

412
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,578
Take me, I'm yours.

413
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,373
Oh!

414
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:36,044
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

415
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,924
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

416
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,220
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

417
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,890
(woman) I do not think
that will be necessary.

418
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,521
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,

419
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,483
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

420
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,111
I'm Christine Vole.

421
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,905
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

422
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,074
How do you do?

423
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:09,202
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

424
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:12,288
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

425
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:17,377
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

426
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:21,131
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder. Is that it?

427
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:24,676
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

428
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,470
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.

429
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,640
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

430
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,852
Your husband will have
to stand trial, I'm afraid.

431
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:39,190
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

432
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,734
Oh?

433
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,695
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

434
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,364
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

435
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:51,953
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

436
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:59,085
Is it, perhaps,
that this cause is too hopeless?

437
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:11,181
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It
was a mistake to let you come back here.

438
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,892
I should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort.

439
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,478
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.

440
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,564
Shut up. You just want
to see me in those nasty shorts.

441
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,984
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

442
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:27,113
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

443
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:33,495
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

444
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,664
After your rest
we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.

445
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,876
Then perhaps
we'll have a walk around the square.

446
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,671
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

447
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:47,300
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

448
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:52,097
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

449
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:56,851
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

450
00:32:56,976 --> 00:33:00,855
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

451
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,400
All right. Hop in!

452
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,903
Sir Wilfrid?

453
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,449
Sir Wilfrid!

454
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,410
Come back!

455
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:18,498
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

456
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:19,791
Go on.

457
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:23,670
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

458
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:27,007
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.

459
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:31,136
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

460
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,430
and the socks were two sizes too large,

461
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,266
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.

462
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,435
Leonard has a way with women.

463
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:44,357
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

464
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:49,529
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

465
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,740
Yes. A lot of money.

466
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:56,745
Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?

467
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,122
Is that what he told you?

468
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,750
Surely you're not suggesting different?

469
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.

470
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:11,926
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

471
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:16,431
You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

472
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:20,185
I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.

473
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:23,688
What hypocrites you are in this country.

474
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,859
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

475
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:32,655
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

476
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:36,826
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

477
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:40,330
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

478
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:44,584
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

479
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,545
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

480
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:51,508
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

481
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,344
I assume you want to help your husband?

482
00:34:54,427 --> 00:35:00,141
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

483
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:04,396
There. Isn't that
more comfortable for you?

484
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:08,316
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.

485
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:12,362
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?

486
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:15,865
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

487
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,951
Isn't it the truth?

488
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,953
Of course.

489
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,997
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

490
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:26,334
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

491
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,795
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

492
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,173
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian

493
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,926
and who must have an interpreter.

494
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:38,346
We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

495
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,890
as long as they tell the truth.

496
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:44,352
You're aware that when you're
in the witness box you will be sworn

497
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,564
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

498
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,568
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

499
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:56,865
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?

500
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:03,538
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

501
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:07,459
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

502
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:10,879
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

503
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:15,050
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

504
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,427
How very convenient.

505
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,679
We are dealing with a capital crime.

506
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:23,641
The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.

507
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,354
He is not my husband.

508
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:36,196
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

509
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:40,241
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

510
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:44,329
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

511
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:48,583
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.

512
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,336
But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.

513
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,755
Don't you think you should be grateful?

514
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,007
One can get very tired of gratitude.

515
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,843
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

516
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:02,305
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.

517
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,599
And you?

518
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:07,102
You want to know too much.

519
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,688
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

520
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:16,194
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

521
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:21,032
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

522
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:26,162
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."

523
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:30,166
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.

524
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,712
And you're satisfied, I hope?

525
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:40,677
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

526
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:43,346
That woman's up to something. But what?

527
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:47,517
The prosecution will break her down
in no time when she's in the witness box.

528
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:51,187
This case is going to be rather
like the charge of the Light Brigade

529
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:55,066
or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.

530
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,610
With the odds all on the other side.

531
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,321
I haven't got much to go on, have l?

532
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,991
The fact is, I've got nothing.

533
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,286
Let me ask you something.

534
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:09,914
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?

535
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,919
Do you?

536
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,757
Do you?

537
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,925
I'm not sure.

538
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:24,596
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

539
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,515
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

540
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,310
I'll take it from here.

541
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:36,649
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

542
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,277
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

543
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:42,405
Did you hear me? A match!

544
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:20,193
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

545
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:25,699
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

546
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,451
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

547
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,829
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

548
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:33,039
This is what you were wearing that night.

549
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:37,085
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

550
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,629
Over here against the wall, please.

551
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:45,010
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.

552
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:48,680
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

553
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,516
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

554
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,561
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.

555
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,938
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.

556
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:01,192
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

557
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,905
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

558
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,700
Mayhew, give me the reports.

559
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:11,953
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

560
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:17,208
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

561
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,883
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

562
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,135
particularly her income tax returns."

563
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,180
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms
are very complicated.

564
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,558
There's also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will.

565
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:36,686
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

566
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,522
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

567
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:45,862
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

568
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:49,741
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?

569
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:53,578
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.

570
00:40:53,745 --> 00:41:00,418
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

571
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:05,840
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

572
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:10,053
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

573
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,640
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

574
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,810
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.

575
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:21,231
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

576
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,400
In Germany in 1945.

577
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:30,240
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

578
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:34,119
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.

579
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:39,749
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.

580
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,918
(music and cheers)

581
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:44,170
(woman) Come on!

582
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:45,839
# Join the party

583
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,050
# Have a hearty glass of rum

584
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:52,804
# Don't ever think about tomorrow

585
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:56,016
# For tomorrow may never come

586
00:41:57,183 --> 00:42:00,478
# When I find me a happy place

587
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:03,690
# That's where I wanna stay

588
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:10,655
# Time is nothing
as long as I'm living it up this way

589
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:15,618
# I may never go home any more

590
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:19,205
# Dim the lights
and start locking the door

591
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,584
# Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me

592
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:26,338
# After all that's what sailors are for

593
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:31,426
# I've got kisses and kisses galore

594
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,846
# That have never been tasted before

595
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,266
# If you treat me right
This could be the night

596
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:39,893
# I may never go home

597
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,644
# I may never go home

598
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,563
# I may never go home

599
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:45,315
# I may never go home

600
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:48,943
# I may never go home any more

601
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:57,619
# I may never go home any more

602
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:00,914
Hey, Fraulein, show us some legs.

603
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,126
They rob you blind
and then throw you a ruddy sailor!

604
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:08,838
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

605
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:12,759
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!

606
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:16,262
All right, Fraulein,
if you won't show 'em, I will.

607
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,390
(cheering)

608
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,858
(whistle)

609
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:47,419
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

610
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:02,267
Come on.

611
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:07,063
Bring him round to the other truck.

612
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:14,195
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

613
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:53,610
Gesundheit.

614
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,244
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

615
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,413
Oh, let me help you.

616
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:07,582
(discordant noise)

617
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:12,671
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

618
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,297
(discordant noise)

619
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:16,800
I'm terribly sorry.

620
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,260
You better go. We've had trouble enough.

621
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:23,431
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

622
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:27,894
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

623
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:31,564
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

624
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:33,733
Cigarette? Gum?

625
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:44,994
You're burning my nose.

626
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,664
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

627
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,291
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

628
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,002
How much?

629
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,254
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?

630
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:58,341
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

631
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:00,510
Got any hot water at your place?

632
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:04,097
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

633
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:05,807
Nearby.

634
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,518
Come.

635
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:17,027
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

636
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:20,780
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemutlich sort of way.

637
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:24,534
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.

638
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:27,996
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

639
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,874
She has a Ford automobile.

640
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:34,085
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

641
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,464
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.

642
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,217
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

643
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,762
You'd better sit down on the cot.

644
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,555
The cot?

645
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:49,225
Getting more gemutlich all the time.
Are you married?

646
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,269
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

647
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:54,064
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

648
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:58,109
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.

649
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:02,947
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

650
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,325
But it's getting better.

651
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:12,248
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

652
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:18,546
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

653
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,774
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

654
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:39,984
Very fair.

655
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:45,156
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

656
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:47,325
I would.

657
00:47:56,376 --> 00:48:00,296
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

658
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:02,215
Milk?

659
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,175
Sure.

660
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:08,179
Milk. Sugar.

661
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:11,725
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

662
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,685
Yeah.

663
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:22,777
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,

664
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:27,449
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

665
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:31,745
Don't worry, we'll work out something,
like an instalment plan.

666
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,331
# I may never go home any more

667
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:44,466
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

668
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:48,511
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

669
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:50,013
Ooh.

670
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:53,224
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

671
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,602
Maybe I can fix it.

672
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,771
I'm good at it.

673
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:06,821
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

674
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:10,784
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

675
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:14,204
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

676
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:18,208
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.

677
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,836
First time she saw it, she was so happy
she broke down and cried.

678
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:26,716
Naturally. She had a solid roof
over her head and a British passport.

679
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:32,389
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

680
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:37,435
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.

681
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,397
You're not? Why not?

682
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:44,275
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar
with the subtleties of our language.

683
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:46,820
The prosecution could easily trip her up.

684
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:50,115
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.

685
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,452
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

686
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:58,039
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

687
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:02,836
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

688
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:07,799
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

689
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:10,635
Let us wish each other luck.

690
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:21,771
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

691
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:26,568
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.

692
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:31,656
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

693
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:52,385
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

694
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:56,639
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

695
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:59,684
murdered Emily Jane French.

696
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,562
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

697
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:05,732
Are you guilty or not guilty?

698
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,361
Not guilty.

699
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:11,196
(murmuring)

700
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,448
Members of the jury,

701
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:18,370
the prisoner stands indicted for that he,
on the 1 4th day of October,

702
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:21,373
murdered Emily Jane French.

703
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:25,251
To this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty.

704
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:29,172
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

705
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,300
whether he be guilty or not.

706
00:51:36,554 --> 00:51:39,933
Members of the jury,
by the oath which you have just taken,

707
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,603
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence.

708
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:46,356
You must shut out
from your minds everything

709
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:50,068
except what will take place in this court.

710
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:53,738
You may proceed
for the prosecution, Mr Myers.

711
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:57,450
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

712
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:02,288
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

713
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:06,334
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

714
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:08,545
appear for the defence.

715
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:14,843
I trust we are not to be deprived

716
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,929
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

717
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:22,350
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

718
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:25,687
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

719
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:31,026
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

720
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:36,531
You may, Mr Myers. You may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution.

721
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:38,908
Thank you, my lord.

722
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:42,996
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

723
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:47,292
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

724
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,960
a woman of 56.

725
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:53,506
How he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection.

726
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:56,217
On the night of October 14 last,

727
00:52:56,384 --> 00:53:00,347
between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

728
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,975
Medical testimony
will be introduced to prove

729
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,437
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

730
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:10,190
and it is the case for the prosecution

731
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:13,526
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

732
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:15,737
That's not true! I didn't do it!

733
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:16,821
(murmuring)

734
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,159
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

735
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:25,121
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

736
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:28,041
and from the medical
and laboratory experts,

737
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:33,797
and the evidence of the murdered
woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.

738
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:37,717
I now call Chief lnspector Hearne,
Criminal lnvestigation Department,

739
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:40,679
- New Scotland Yard.
- (man) Chief lnspector Hearne.

740
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:43,890
- Chief lnspector Hearne.
- Chief lnspector Hearne.

741
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:06,496
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

742
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:09,290
240 above 1 30.
You shouldn't be here at all.

743
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,544
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

744
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:15,088
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

745
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:19,092
It may interest you to know
that I am descended from a warrior family

746
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:24,556
which traces its brave past
back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

747
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:29,185
You're to have a calcium injection daily,

748
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:33,189
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

749
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:37,318
Any pain or shortness of breath,
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets

750
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:40,155
under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...

751
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:44,534
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.

752
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:49,247
Carter, I'd better take
that Thermos of cocoa with me.

753
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,208
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

754
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:57,756
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

755
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,383
It is cocoa. So sorry.

756
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:03,553
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

757
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,348
Take care of this, Carter.

758
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:11,686
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

759
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:13,229
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

760
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:16,107
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.

761
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:20,737
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

762
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,906
Come along, Carter.

763
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:27,118
From the body temperature
and other factors,

764
00:55:27,243 --> 00:55:30,955
we placed the time of death
at between 9.30 and 1 0pm,

765
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:36,628
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

766
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:42,842
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

767
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:45,136
Were there any signs of a struggle?

768
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:47,597
None. Just the one blow.

769
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:51,685
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

770
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:55,105
My lord, I must object.

771
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,651
My learned friend refers
to the assailant as "the murderer".

772
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:03,321
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

773
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:06,408
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

774
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:12,497
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

775
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:14,791
Please rephrase your question.

776
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:20,964
Yes, my lord. Inspector,
is it your opinion that the assailant,

777
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:25,301
whether he, she or it,
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

778
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:27,595
My lord, I am taken by surprise

779
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:32,600
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

780
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:35,645
Quite so. You'll have
to do better than that, Mr Myers.

781
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,106
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.

782
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,900
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

783
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,069
(murmuring)

784
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:48,658
Silence! Silence!

785
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:50,827
(gavel)

786
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,873
Very well, lnspector,
let us proceed with the facts.

787
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:59,377
After establishing the cause and the time
of death, what did you then do?

788
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:03,340
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

789
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:07,635
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

790
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:12,265
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

791
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,559
- No others?
- No others.

792
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:19,481
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

793
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:24,986
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

794
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:29,115
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

795
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:34,704
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

796
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:41,586
You're saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside?

797
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:46,049
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

798
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:49,094
After all, if he insists
on answering his own questions,

799
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:52,681
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

800
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:55,225
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?

801
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,394
Yes, my lord.

802
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,979
Inspector,

803
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:03,692
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman's property was missing?

804
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:06,945
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

805
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:12,659
In your experience, lnspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

806
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:16,705
break into a house,
do they leave without taking anything?

807
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,956
No, sir.

808
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,001
- Do you produce a jacket, lnspector?
- Yes, sir.

809
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,378
Is that the jacket?

810
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:30,468
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

811
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,637
Where did you find this, lnspector?

812
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:35,306
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

813
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:37,934
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

814
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:40,562
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

815
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,231
Though an attempt
had been made to wash them out.

816
00:58:43,356 --> 00:58:45,233
What tests were made?

817
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,571
First to determine
if the stains were human blood,

818
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,115
then to classify it by group or type.

819
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,951
And was the blood
of a particular group or type?

820
00:58:55,076 --> 00:58:57,996
Yes, sir. It is type O.

821
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:01,374
And did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman?

822
00:59:01,499 --> 00:59:03,835
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

823
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,672
- The same. Type O.
- (murmuring)

824
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:11,593
Thank you, lnspector.
No further questions.

825
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:16,765
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

826
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,351
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

827
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:24,439
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

828
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:26,900
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

829
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:29,402
So the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery

830
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,738
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

831
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:35,825
Can't we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house,

832
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,703
suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her,

833
00:59:38,828 --> 00:59:42,123
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

834
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:44,834
I submit, my lord,
that it is entirely impossible

835
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:49,547
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

836
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:51,966
With or without gloves.

837
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:56,012
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

838
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:02,560
Inspector, when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

839
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:06,731
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist,

840
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:11,611
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

841
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:14,531
And were you not told
the same thing by his wife?

842
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:18,493
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

843
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,995
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife

844
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:25,166
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread?

845
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:29,921
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

846
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:37,846
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

847
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:41,975
You agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?

848
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,519
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

849
01:00:44,644 --> 01:00:47,689
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

850
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:49,024
Yes, sir, it might.

851
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:54,279
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

852
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:59,367
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

853
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:01,953
- That is correct.
- However,

854
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,540
if the prisoner's blood
were also of this same group,

855
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:08,418
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

856
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:11,254
from the household accident
he described to you.

857
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:13,757
Yes, sir.

858
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:17,677
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood, lnspector?

859
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:19,387
No, sir.

860
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,933
I have here a certificate

861
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:28,355
stating that Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

862
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,815
at the North London Hospital.

863
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,319
And that his blood is group O.

864
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,488
(murmuring)

865
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:41,451
Thank you, lnspector.

866
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:49,167
Inspector, granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife,

867
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:52,337
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

868
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:56,549
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

869
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:59,469
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

870
01:01:59,594 --> 01:02:01,012
You may stand down.

871
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,893
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

872
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:09,896
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

873
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:36,006
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence...

874
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:38,174
(buzzer)

875
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:41,928
..the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

876
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:45,223
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

877
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:48,852
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

878
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:53,982
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

879
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:58,611
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

880
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:02,532
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

881
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:05,869
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

882
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:09,164
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

883
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:12,584
poor feckless bodies, afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work.

884
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:17,922
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

885
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:21,176
Aye. Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

886
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,012
She knew me and she trusted me.

887
01:03:24,095 --> 01:03:26,973
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.

888
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:32,020
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

889
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:36,733
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

890
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,321
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

891
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:45,700
I promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired.

892
01:03:45,825 --> 01:03:49,454
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

893
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:54,000
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

894
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:57,796
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

895
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:01,716
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

896
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:05,261
So after supper I slipped
back to get it as it was no distance.

897
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:08,682
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.

898
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,142
I let myself in
and went upstairs to my room.

899
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:16,481
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

900
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:20,777
- No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!
- (court murmurs)

901
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:22,946
Talking and laughing they were.

902
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:26,574
But it was no business of mine,
so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

903
01:04:26,741 --> 01:04:30,120
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.

904
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:34,165
You say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9?

905
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:38,712
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

906
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:43,341
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

907
01:04:43,466 --> 01:04:49,472
I went back to my niece. Och,
she was delighted with the pattern. Si...

908
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:57,647
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 1 1,
then I said good night and I come home.

909
01:04:57,772 --> 01:05:01,568
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

910
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:03,737
before she went to bed.

911
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:08,408
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.

912
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:11,453
Did you really think
that a burglary had been committed?

913
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:13,663
My lord, I must protest!

914
01:05:13,788 --> 01:05:17,917
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

915
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:22,005
Miss McKenzie, were you aware
that Leonard Vole was a married man?

916
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,008
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.

917
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:27,135
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

918
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:32,223
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

919
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:36,144
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

920
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:39,731
that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?

921
01:05:39,856 --> 01:05:43,401
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

922
01:05:43,526 --> 01:05:48,406
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

923
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:52,577
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

924
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:56,373
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

925
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:59,084
- Why?
- (laughter)

926
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:04,422
Members of the jury, it is possible
for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

927
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:08,718
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

928
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,970
(laughter)

929
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:16,434
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

930
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,105
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

931
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:22,607
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

932
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:25,694
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

933
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:29,656
You heard Mrs French
and the prisoner discussing her new will?

934
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:32,617
Yes. He was to have all her money,
she told him,

935
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:37,205
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did.

936
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,709
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

937
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:44,129
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

938
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:47,549
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.

939
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:51,094
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

940
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:55,348
Would you...? Thank you.

941
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:59,853
Miss McKenzie, you have
given evidence about two wills.

942
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:02,022
In the old will, that which was revoked,

943
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:05,984
were you not to receive
the bulk of Mrs French's estate?

944
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,318
That's so.

945
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:11,781
Whereas in the new will, except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity,

946
01:07:11,906 --> 01:07:15,535
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

947
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:19,456
It'll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money.

948
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:23,960
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.

949
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:26,629
I'm not antagonistic to him.

950
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:30,759
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

951
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:31,676
(laughter)

952
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:33,845
I suggest you formed this opinion

953
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:37,766
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

954
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:42,062
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

955
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:44,898
Now. On the night of October 14

956
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,360
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

957
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:51,905
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

958
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,616
You mean you only heard the voices?

959
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,577
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

960
01:07:57,702 --> 01:08:00,789
What makes you say
the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?

961
01:08:00,955 --> 01:08:05,293
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

962
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:08,880
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

963
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:11,966
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door,

964
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:14,761
yet you are sure
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

965
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:17,681
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

966
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:24,062
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

967
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,690
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

968
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:31,152
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

969
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:35,365
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

970
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,493
Yes. She was fond
of a talk or a good play.

971
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:41,830
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

972
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:44,124
what you really heard was the television

973
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:46,835
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

974
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,423
There was a play called Lover's Leap
on the television that night.

975
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:57,012
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

976
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:02,183
Because the television was away
being repaired that week, that's why.

977
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:04,060
(laughter)

978
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,860
(gavel)

979
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,696
Silence! Silence!

980
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:19,534
Odd. It's not time yet.

981
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:22,704
If my learned friend has no further
questions, I'd like...

982
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:25,915
I have not quite finished.

983
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:30,670
You are registered, are you not,
under the National Health lnsurance Act?

984
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:34,549
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.

985
01:09:34,674 --> 01:09:37,719
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

986
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:40,764
I am sure that many agree with you.

987
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:47,312
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health lnsurance for...

988
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:51,066
- (quietly)..a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

989
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:54,194
I protest against the way
in which this question was put!

990
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,405
I will repeat the question, my lord.

991
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:03,495
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

992
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:08,500
did you apply to the National Health
lnsurance for a hearing aid?

993
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:09,668
Yes, I did.

994
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:12,212
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

995
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:17,634
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

996
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:20,970
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

997
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:24,224
that you could distinguish the voice of...

998
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:26,518
(quietly)..the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

999
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:28,687
Who? Who?

1000
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:29,771
(murmuring)

1001
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,940
No further questions.

1002
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,695
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.

1003
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,907
Six months ago I applied for
my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

1004
01:10:41,032 --> 01:10:45,995
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

1005
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:49,082
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

1006
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:51,668
(laughter)

1007
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:55,046
(Myers) Call Police Constable Jeffries.

1008
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,426
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

1009
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,814
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1010
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:18,028
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1011
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:34,169
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?

1012
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:39,299
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

1013
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:43,219
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

1014
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:56,941
Christine.

1015
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:10,455
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1016
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,250
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1017
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:16,961
My lord, I have the most serious objection

1018
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:21,174
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

1019
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,426
I call my learned friend's attention

1020
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:28,056
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

1021
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:32,268
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1022
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:36,022
And you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1023
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:38,858
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1024
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,944
No.

1025
01:12:41,027 --> 01:12:45,532
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1026
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:48,284
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1027
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:51,913
There is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner,

1028
01:12:52,038 --> 01:12:55,000
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage?

1029
01:12:55,125 --> 01:13:00,714
My lord, the so-called previous marriage
is, in fact, well-documented.

1030
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:06,845
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1031
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:11,683
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1032
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:14,644
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.

1033
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:20,692
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1034
01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:29,492
You're willing to give evidence against the
man you've been calling your husband?

1035
01:13:29,617 --> 01:13:31,036
Yes.

1036
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:35,457
You stated to the police that on the night
that Mrs French was murdered,

1037
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:40,837
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1038
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:43,590
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?

1039
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:48,428
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.

1040
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:53,224
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1041
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,809
(murmuring)

1042
01:13:56,811 --> 01:13:58,938
Silence!

1043
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:01,149
I must have silence.

1044
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:05,528
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1045
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:08,615
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1046
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,869
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1047
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:16,539
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1048
01:14:16,706 --> 01:14:19,417
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

1049
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,711
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1050
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:24,005
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1051
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:27,133
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1052
01:14:27,258 --> 01:14:29,511
He said "I've killed her."

1053
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:34,140
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1054
01:14:34,265 --> 01:14:38,436
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1055
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:45,151
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1056
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:48,446
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

1057
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:52,325
My lord is most gracious,
but pray let the witness continue.

1058
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:56,705
We are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction.

1059
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:00,709
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1060
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:03,753
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1061
01:15:03,878 --> 01:15:08,675
when the prisoner said "l have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1062
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,678
It was that woman
he had been seeing so often.

1063
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:16,558
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1064
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:19,019
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1065
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:21,229
But you've changed your story now. Why?

1066
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:23,606
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1067
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:27,027
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1068
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:29,946
He married me
and brought me to this country.

1069
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,074
What he has asked me to do I have
because I was grateful.

1070
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:36,244
It was not because
he was your husband and you loved him?

1071
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,413
I never loved him.

1072
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,125
It was gratitude, then,
that prompted you to give him an alibi

1073
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:45,712
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1074
01:15:45,837 --> 01:15:49,382
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1075
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:51,634
That woman, she was a harmless old fool,

1076
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,346
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder.

1077
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:58,433
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1078
01:15:58,558 --> 01:16:01,269
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1079
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:03,605
Then this is the truth?

1080
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:07,317
That Leonard Vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten,

1081
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:09,527
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,

1082
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:13,782
and that he said to you
"l have killed her"?

1083
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:17,160
That is the truth.

1084
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:20,455
That is the truth, before God?

1085
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:22,749
That is the truth.

1086
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,251
Thank you.

1087
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:34,010
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,
which do you prefer to be called?

1088
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:36,179
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1089
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:40,350
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1090
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:45,689
However, it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1091
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:50,318
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1092
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:53,530
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1093
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,699
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1094
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:58,910
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1095
01:16:59,035 --> 01:17:01,955
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

1096
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,374
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1097
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:08,837
And in the ceremony, when you swore
to love, honour and cherish your husband,

1098
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:11,506
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1099
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:14,843
And when the police questioned you
about this wretched man

1100
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,387
who believed himself married and loved,

1101
01:17:17,512 --> 01:17:20,015
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1102
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,977
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1103
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:28,398
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1104
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:32,944
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1105
01:17:33,069 --> 01:17:37,949
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1106
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:41,578
The question is, Frau Helm,
were you lying then, are you lying now?

1107
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:45,457
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1108
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:48,126
(murmuring)

1109
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:49,002
(coughs)

1110
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:53,465
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.

1111
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,927
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1112
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:02,265
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1113
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:06,561
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1114
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:12,275
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1115
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,321
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1116
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:20,367
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1117
01:18:20,492 --> 01:18:23,161
when she was sworn here today.

1118
01:18:23,286 --> 01:18:27,582
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1119
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:29,876
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1120
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:32,045
(muttering)

1121
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:39,302
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1122
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:43,014
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

1123
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,266
It means to swear falsely under oath.

1124
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,185
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1125
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:52,273
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1126
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,818
Yes, I'm aware.

1127
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:59,698
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1128
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:03,493
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1129
01:19:03,618 --> 01:19:05,578
So help me, God.

1130
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:11,126
Then that, my lord,
is the case for the prosecution.

1131
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:32,731
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1132
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:37,569
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1133
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:38,653
Silence.

1134
01:19:40,905 --> 01:19:44,617
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?

1135
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:50,582
My lord, members of the jury,

1136
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:55,879
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1137
01:19:56,004 --> 01:20:00,383
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1138
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:04,054
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief lnspector Hearne,

1139
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:09,267
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner, as he always does.

1140
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:14,314
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1141
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:18,401
Whether it is theory
or actual fact, however,

1142
01:20:18,526 --> 01:20:21,112
you will decide for yourselves.

1143
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:25,241
And then you have heard
the evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1144
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:29,537
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1145
01:20:29,662 --> 01:20:31,998
One, the death of her beloved mistress

1146
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:37,796
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of £80,000,

1147
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:40,715
which she'd fully expected to receive.

1148
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,678
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1149
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,724
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

1150
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:52,727
in both these... mishaps.

1151
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:59,401
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1152
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:04,197
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1153
01:21:04,322 --> 01:21:09,035
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1154
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,956
I objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence

1155
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:15,542
harmful to her husband.

1156
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:22,340
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1157
01:21:22,465 --> 01:21:28,638
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it.

1158
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:31,641
For what it is worth.

1159
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:37,689
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.

1160
01:21:37,814 --> 01:21:41,901
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1161
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:45,989
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1162
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:51,828
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1163
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:54,831
on this tragic riddle.

1164
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:57,959
The prisoner himself.

1165
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:01,588
Members of the jury,

1166
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:05,300
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1167
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:27,906
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give will be the truth,

1168
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,242
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1169
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:36,581
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1170
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:39,793
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1171
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:45,215
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did
you not on the night of October 14 last,

1172
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,634
murder Emily Jane French?

1173
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:52,097
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1174
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:54,140
(muttering)

1175
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:58,770
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1176
01:22:58,895 --> 01:23:04,150
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1177
01:23:04,275 --> 01:23:06,778
The defence feels
his faculties should be spared

1178
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:10,490
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution.

1179
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:13,493
This is not a plea for any indulgence.

1180
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:16,663
I am confident that
no matter how searching this may be,

1181
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:19,666
the prisoner will withstand it.

1182
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:24,838
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1183
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:27,007
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1184
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,259
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1185
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:30,135
No.

1186
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:32,512
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1187
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:37,559
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of £80,000?

1188
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:38,852
No, I didn't.

1189
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:43,857
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1190
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:47,277
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

1191
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:51,948
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1192
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:54,576
Yes, sir.

1193
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:59,956
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1194
01:24:00,081 --> 01:24:03,293
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1195
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:06,629
who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own

1196
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:09,341
at the times that he has stated.

1197
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:12,927
Apparently, this splendid effort
was without results.

1198
01:24:13,094 --> 01:24:15,430
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1199
01:24:15,555 --> 01:24:18,767
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1200
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:23,563
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat.

1201
01:24:23,688 --> 01:24:29,110
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1202
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:33,573
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1203
01:24:33,698 --> 01:24:37,744
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1204
01:24:37,869 --> 01:24:41,122
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?

1205
01:24:41,247 --> 01:24:45,377
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1206
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:50,548
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1207
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:55,929
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1208
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:58,473
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1209
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:01,351
My lord, the lady was so described to me.

1210
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:05,980
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1211
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:08,066
Oh.

1212
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:13,363
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1213
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,657
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

1214
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:19,035
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1215
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:23,581
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1216
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:26,042
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1217
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:29,254
And in the afternoon,
you started plans to dispose of it.

1218
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:31,631
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1219
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:34,884
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1220
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:37,137
We had a drink and walked out together.

1221
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:43,309
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1222
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:48,773
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1223
01:25:48,898 --> 01:25:52,736
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1224
01:25:52,902 --> 01:25:56,281
Anyway, it irritated me,
so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,

1225
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:59,951
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,
but it was just an act!

1226
01:26:00,076 --> 01:26:04,247
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit £80,000!

1227
01:26:04,372 --> 01:26:08,877
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but...

1228
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:13,423
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1229
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:17,510
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1230
01:26:17,677 --> 01:26:20,096
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1231
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:24,809
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1232
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:28,772
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1233
01:26:29,522 --> 01:26:34,736
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1234
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:37,489
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1235
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:42,118
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1236
01:26:42,243 --> 01:26:44,829
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1237
01:26:44,954 --> 01:26:49,042
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.

1238
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:52,087
And the fact, Mr Vole,
is that we've only your word for it.

1239
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:55,131
That you left Mrs French's house
at the time you say,

1240
01:26:55,256 --> 01:27:00,053
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1241
01:27:00,178 --> 01:27:03,348
Somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house!

1242
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:07,811
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1243
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:11,272
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands.

1244
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:14,401
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1245
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:16,569
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1246
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:19,614
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

1247
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:21,908
You came home at ten past ten!

1248
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:26,413
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1249
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:28,790
You killed Emily French!

1250
01:27:28,915 --> 01:27:31,209
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1251
01:27:31,334 --> 01:27:35,213
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!

1252
01:27:35,338 --> 01:27:39,926
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1253
01:27:45,598 --> 01:27:48,101
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1254
01:27:48,226 --> 01:27:50,437
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1255
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:55,900
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1256
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:57,944
What?

1257
01:27:58,111 --> 01:28:02,615
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1258
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:06,786
It'll all be over by the afternoon,
and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1259
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:10,373
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1260
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:15,003
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection.

1261
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:18,089
And there's a lot more packing to be done.

1262
01:28:19,049 --> 01:28:23,887
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1263
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:28,350
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1264
01:28:30,393 --> 01:28:34,022
I watched when Frau Helm
was on the stand. They didn't like her.

1265
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:38,401
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1266
01:28:38,526 --> 01:28:41,780
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1267
01:28:41,946 --> 01:28:42,739
No.

1268
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:45,658
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1269
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:47,160
I'm not sure.

1270
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:51,039
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.

1271
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:56,211
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1272
01:28:56,753 --> 01:29:01,925
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1273
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:04,969
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1274
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:08,640
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1275
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:12,560
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1276
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:16,523
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.

1277
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:19,526
He's entitled to the best that I can do.

1278
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:23,697
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal
for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1279
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:28,118
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1280
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:30,787
(telephone rings)

1281
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:39,129
- Yes?
- (woman) This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?

1282
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:42,632
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.

1283
01:29:42,757 --> 01:29:47,178
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

1284
01:29:47,303 --> 01:29:50,807
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?

1285
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:54,269
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1286
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:55,603
Well, really, madam!

1287
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,732
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1288
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:02,569
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1289
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:04,946
It's about that German wife.

1290
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:08,616
I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.

1291
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:14,330
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1292
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,791
Well, hello, ducky.

1293
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,878
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1294
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:23,840
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.

1295
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,968
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1296
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:30,555
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1297
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,142
I'll be here for 30 minutes
because that's when me train leaves.

1298
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:37,520
If you want the lowdown on
that German bag, get yourself here.

1299
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:40,231
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1300
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:42,484
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1301
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:46,863
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1302
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:50,825
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1303
01:30:52,702 --> 01:30:58,500
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1304
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:03,171
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1305
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,131
Balderdash.

1306
01:31:05,256 --> 01:31:10,762
I'm too old and too sick
to go on a wild-goose chase.

1307
01:31:10,887 --> 01:31:13,765
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1308
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:16,976
Euston Station, where do you think?

1309
01:31:18,561 --> 01:31:20,563
Now, sir?

1310
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:22,524
Shortly.

1311
01:31:23,441 --> 01:31:25,026
Cigar!

1312
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,987
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1313
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:32,784
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1314
01:31:32,951 --> 01:31:34,994
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1315
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:43,503
(train announcement on PA)

1316
01:32:00,937 --> 01:32:03,982
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1317
01:32:04,107 --> 01:32:08,862
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

1318
01:32:08,987 --> 01:32:11,322
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.

1319
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:13,992
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1320
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:17,162
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1321
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:22,751
No need for mine. If I did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1322
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:27,130
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.

1323
01:32:27,297 --> 01:32:29,841
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1324
01:32:30,008 --> 01:32:34,429
You realise that you're duty-bound
to give any evidence that you might have?

1325
01:32:34,554 --> 01:32:39,225
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1326
01:32:39,351 --> 01:32:43,813
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1327
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:48,777
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1328
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:52,822
Poor bleeder, he's been took in
by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.

1329
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:58,119
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1330
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:00,997
Well, I don't expect you...

1331
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:08,254
Well, as I say, I don't expect you
to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1332
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:12,967
If these letters get the boy off,
it's £1 00 for me, right?

1333
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:17,972
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer £1 0.

1334
01:33:18,098 --> 01:33:21,476
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1335
01:33:21,601 --> 01:33:24,437
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1336
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:26,690
If these help prove my client's innocence,

1337
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:30,360
£20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1338
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:33,530
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.

1339
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:36,032
- £40.
- All right, blast yer.

1340
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:39,035
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.

1341
01:33:39,202 --> 01:33:41,246
How do we know
these are from Mrs Vole?

1342
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:45,667
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1343
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:51,131
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.

1344
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:56,886
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1345
01:33:57,012 --> 01:33:59,472
Good heavens, look at this.

1346
01:34:02,058 --> 01:34:04,102
Juicy, ain't they?

1347
01:34:04,227 --> 01:34:08,189
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1348
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:11,401
What's the difference
so long as she gets what's coming?

1349
01:34:11,526 --> 01:34:14,696
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1350
01:34:14,863 --> 01:34:18,241
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1351
01:34:19,325 --> 01:34:21,786
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1352
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:26,249
Ha!

1353
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:30,337
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1354
01:34:30,503 --> 01:34:35,467
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1355
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:40,555
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1356
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:46,102
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1357
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:50,648
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1358
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:56,488
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im
away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1359
01:34:56,654 --> 01:35:01,534
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.

1360
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:06,998
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another £5 for the letters.

1361
01:35:07,123 --> 01:35:11,419
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1362
01:35:11,544 --> 01:35:15,173
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1363
01:35:17,133 --> 01:35:19,678
Unbelievable.

1364
01:35:19,803 --> 01:35:24,140
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1365
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:26,267
Miss, um...

1366
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:28,269
Where is she?

1367
01:35:34,275 --> 01:35:40,031
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1368
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,536
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1369
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:46,705
Good idea.

1370
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:55,547
(gavel)

1371
01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:57,173
Silence!

1372
01:35:57,298 --> 01:35:59,426
Be upstanding in court.

1373
01:36:00,468 --> 01:36:03,179
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1374
01:36:03,304 --> 01:36:05,432
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer

1375
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:09,561
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

1376
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:14,065
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1377
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:31,166
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1378
01:36:31,332 --> 01:36:33,710
it has the right to be heard last.

1379
01:36:33,835 --> 01:36:40,133
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1380
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:44,679
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1381
01:36:44,804 --> 01:36:49,476
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1382
01:36:49,642 --> 01:36:53,021
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion.

1383
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:57,359
- I will briefly summarise these facts...
- (footsteps)

1384
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:05,408
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1385
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:10,330
That is, if Sir Wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings.

1386
01:37:10,413 --> 01:37:14,876
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech
for the crown, however, is premature.

1387
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:20,006
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1388
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:24,010
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1389
01:37:24,135 --> 01:37:27,430
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1390
01:37:27,555 --> 01:37:30,934
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1391
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:34,854
I have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent.

1392
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:40,777
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1393
01:37:40,944 --> 01:37:43,321
at page 463.

1394
01:37:43,446 --> 01:37:47,742
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1395
01:37:47,867 --> 01:37:51,246
1942 at page 1 53.

1396
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:54,249
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1397
01:37:54,374 --> 01:37:58,461
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1398
01:37:58,586 --> 01:38:01,172
since you appeared for the prosecution.

1399
01:38:01,297 --> 01:38:06,052
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.

1400
01:38:06,177 --> 01:38:08,388
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1401
01:38:08,513 --> 01:38:10,598
Letters, my lord.

1402
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:13,810
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1403
01:38:16,187 --> 01:38:19,733
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1404
01:38:19,858 --> 01:38:23,445
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1405
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:27,282
in the king against Sullivan
was sustained.

1406
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:32,746
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1407
01:38:32,871 --> 01:38:37,417
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1408
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:40,754
As yours is now, by me.

1409
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:42,922
(muttering)

1410
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:49,304
Call Christine Helm.

1411
01:38:50,138 --> 01:38:51,806
Christine Helm.

1412
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:54,684
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

1413
01:39:11,326 --> 01:39:16,331
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, l
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1414
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:20,460
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1415
01:39:20,585 --> 01:39:21,753
Yes.

1416
01:39:21,878 --> 01:39:27,634
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1417
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:31,763
It's a simple question. Do you
or do you not know a man called Max?

1418
01:39:31,888 --> 01:39:34,140
Max? Certainly not.

1419
01:39:34,265 --> 01:39:38,103
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1420
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:40,772
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.

1421
01:39:40,897 --> 01:39:47,737
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1422
01:39:49,364 --> 01:39:52,325
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1423
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:54,786
I suggest that on October 20

1424
01:39:54,953 --> 01:39:58,289
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1425
01:39:58,415 --> 01:40:01,876
-..addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1426
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:06,131
The letter was but one of a series
written to the same man.

1427
01:40:06,923 --> 01:40:09,050
Lies! All lies!

1428
01:40:09,217 --> 01:40:13,346
You seem to have been, well, let us say,
on intimate terms with this man.

1429
01:40:13,471 --> 01:40:16,182
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1430
01:40:16,349 --> 01:40:21,813
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1431
01:40:21,938 --> 01:40:26,818
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened."

1432
01:40:26,943 --> 01:40:29,904
"l believe all our difficulties
may be ended."

1433
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:32,657
I will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies!

1434
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:36,578
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1435
01:40:36,745 --> 01:40:38,997
- It isn't?
- No!

1436
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:42,542
I write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it.

1437
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:48,214
Like this?

1438
01:40:48,298 --> 01:40:50,133
(muttering)

1439
01:40:50,884 --> 01:40:56,264
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

1440
01:40:56,389 --> 01:40:57,682
(laughter)

1441
01:40:57,807 --> 01:41:02,312
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him
and that's what he is.

1442
01:41:02,437 --> 01:41:06,733
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough
to identify your letter paper.

1443
01:41:06,858 --> 01:41:11,780
Now, if you like, I can have an expert
identify your handwriting.

1444
01:41:11,905 --> 01:41:13,782
Damn you!

1445
01:41:14,282 --> 01:41:17,285
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1446
01:41:17,452 --> 01:41:19,662
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1447
01:41:19,788 --> 01:41:23,249
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!

1448
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:24,793
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1449
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:27,671
Usher, get the witness a chair.

1450
01:41:27,796 --> 01:41:29,839
(Christine sobs)

1451
01:41:33,968 --> 01:41:40,141
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1452
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:50,485
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened."

1453
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:54,322
"All our difficulties may soon be solved."

1454
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:59,494
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about."

1455
01:41:59,619 --> 01:42:05,500
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone."

1456
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:12,757
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder,

1457
01:42:12,882 --> 01:42:16,761
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves,

1458
01:42:16,886 --> 01:42:20,807
and that he even admitted to me
that he'd killed her?"

1459
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:24,394
"Strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him."

1460
01:42:24,519 --> 01:42:28,148
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1461
01:42:28,273 --> 01:42:32,152
because they will take him away forever

1462
01:42:32,277 --> 01:42:37,032
and I shall be free and yours,
my beloved."

1463
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:42,037
"l count the hours until
we are together. Christine."

1464
01:42:45,081 --> 01:42:49,002
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?

1465
01:42:59,179 --> 01:43:04,434
I now ask you again, Christine Helm,
did you write this letter?

1466
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:07,812
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.

1467
01:43:07,937 --> 01:43:12,067
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1468
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:13,985
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1469
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:19,491
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1470
01:43:19,657 --> 01:43:23,203
If you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom,

1471
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:26,956
I strongly advise you
not to add to your crime.

1472
01:43:27,123 --> 01:43:30,877
But, if this letter
has not been written by you,

1473
01:43:31,002 --> 01:43:34,673
then now is the time to state this fact.

1474
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:39,344
I wrote the letter.

1475
01:43:39,469 --> 01:43:41,721
(muttering)

1476
01:43:41,846 --> 01:43:45,767
And that, my lord,
is the case for the defence.

1477
01:43:53,608 --> 01:43:57,028
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1478
01:43:57,153 --> 01:43:59,364
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.

1479
01:43:59,489 --> 01:44:03,618
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.

1480
01:44:03,743 --> 01:44:04,911
I concede.

1481
01:44:05,036 --> 01:44:08,248
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1482
01:44:08,373 --> 01:44:11,876
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1483
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:15,422
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1484
01:44:15,547 --> 01:44:19,718
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1485
01:44:19,843 --> 01:44:23,054
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1486
01:44:23,179 --> 01:44:27,350
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1487
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,394
Come along.

1488
01:44:30,353 --> 01:44:32,397
Where's my wig?

1489
01:45:01,343 --> 01:45:03,803
The prisoner will stand up.

1490
01:45:06,348 --> 01:45:11,311
Members of the jury,
are you all agreed upon your verdict?

1491
01:45:12,896 --> 01:45:14,105
We are.

1492
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:18,485
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole,

1493
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:23,156
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of Emily Jane French?

1494
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:28,495
Not guilty, m'lord.

1495
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:31,039
(shouting / gasping)

1496
01:45:48,556 --> 01:45:49,849
Silence!

1497
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,851
Silence!

1498
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:58,608
Leonard Stephen Vole,
you have been found not guilty

1499
01:45:58,733 --> 01:46:03,279
of the murder
of Emily Jane French on October 14.

1500
01:46:03,405 --> 01:46:07,909
You are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court.

1501
01:46:18,837 --> 01:46:22,173
Persons with anything more to do
before the queen's justices

1502
01:46:22,298 --> 01:46:24,509
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery

1503
01:46:24,634 --> 01:46:29,597
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1504
01:46:38,356 --> 01:46:42,027
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1505
01:46:42,152 --> 01:46:44,654
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1506
01:46:44,779 --> 01:46:48,199
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1507
01:46:48,366 --> 01:46:52,162
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1508
01:46:52,287 --> 01:46:56,124
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1509
01:46:56,249 --> 01:46:59,377
"Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr
when they charged me.

1510
01:46:59,544 --> 01:47:04,716
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1511
01:47:14,184 --> 01:47:17,395
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1512
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,647
and the other on a banana peel.

1513
01:47:19,773 --> 01:47:23,026
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?

1514
01:47:23,151 --> 01:47:26,154
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,

1515
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:30,325
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1516
01:47:30,492 --> 01:47:32,077
(commotion)

1517
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:48,635
- (woman) Every word you said was a lie!
- (man) You ought to be locked up! Liar!

1518
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:52,055
You'd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd, madam.

1519
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:54,224
Thank you.

1520
01:47:58,019 --> 01:48:01,272
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1521
01:48:01,398 --> 01:48:06,986
Let me finish the last of the cocoa
while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1522
01:48:07,112 --> 01:48:11,449
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1523
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:42,522
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1524
01:48:42,647 --> 01:48:45,150
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1525
01:48:45,275 --> 01:48:49,195
I don't mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin.

1526
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,698
But I have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons.

1527
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:56,077
In case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1528
01:48:56,202 --> 01:48:58,413
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1529
01:48:58,538 --> 01:49:02,167
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,

1530
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:06,629
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1531
01:49:06,755 --> 01:49:10,383
If I were appearing
for the prosecution, it would be.

1532
01:49:10,508 --> 01:49:14,512
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1533
01:49:14,637 --> 01:49:17,766
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1534
01:49:17,891 --> 01:49:22,604
and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1535
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:28,526
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1536
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:31,321
What are you driving at?

1537
01:49:31,446 --> 01:49:34,407
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1538
01:49:34,532 --> 01:49:35,909
- We?
- Remember?

1539
01:49:36,034 --> 01:49:39,704
When you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife,

1540
01:49:39,829 --> 01:49:43,917
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent? That gave me the idea.

1541
01:49:44,042 --> 01:49:45,669
What idea?

1542
01:49:45,794 --> 01:49:50,256
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1543
01:49:50,382 --> 01:49:54,344
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1544
01:49:54,469 --> 01:49:58,765
because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.

1545
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:02,560
So now you know
the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.

1546
01:50:07,857 --> 01:50:12,112
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1547
01:50:12,237 --> 01:50:14,864
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1548
01:50:18,618 --> 01:50:22,706
I suspected something, but not that.

1549
01:50:22,831 --> 01:50:25,834
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1550
01:50:25,959 --> 01:50:29,713
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1551
01:50:29,838 --> 01:50:32,716
All those blue letters!

1552
01:50:32,841 --> 01:50:36,511
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1553
01:50:36,636 --> 01:50:39,055
There's never been anyone but Leonard.

1554
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:41,433
My dear, could you not have trusted me,

1555
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,520
worked with me truthfully
and honourably? We would have won.

1556
01:50:45,687 --> 01:50:48,565
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1557
01:50:48,732 --> 01:50:51,901
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1558
01:50:52,027 --> 01:50:55,280
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

1559
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:57,907
I knew he was guilty.

1560
01:51:01,286 --> 01:51:04,247
That can't be true! No!

1561
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:07,876
Listen to me, once and for all.

1562
01:51:08,043 --> 01:51:10,712
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1563
01:51:10,837 --> 01:51:14,299
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1564
01:51:14,466 --> 01:51:17,552
And you saved him? A murderer?

1565
01:51:17,677 --> 01:51:19,804
Again, you don't understand.

1566
01:51:19,929 --> 01:51:21,973
I love him.

1567
01:51:27,771 --> 01:51:30,148
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1568
01:51:30,273 --> 01:51:31,900
Leonard!

1569
01:51:32,025 --> 01:51:35,195
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1570
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,364
Leonard, Leonard.

1571
01:51:39,407 --> 01:51:44,954
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1572
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:50,710
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got
out of this alive, let's stay this way.

1573
01:51:50,877 --> 01:51:54,339
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1574
01:51:54,464 --> 01:51:57,717
Who did? You got me off
and I can't be tried again for this.

1575
01:51:57,842 --> 01:52:02,430
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1576
01:52:02,555 --> 01:52:05,308
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

1577
01:52:05,433 --> 01:52:08,520
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1578
01:52:08,645 --> 01:52:12,816
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1579
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:17,529
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1580
01:52:17,654 --> 01:52:20,573
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1581
01:52:20,699 --> 01:52:24,285
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1582
01:52:24,452 --> 01:52:29,416
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1583
01:52:29,582 --> 01:52:33,253
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be £5,000 for the defence.

1584
01:52:33,378 --> 01:52:38,133
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1585
01:52:38,258 --> 01:52:43,221
Standing in the witness box, having
to face you, saying I never loved you.

1586
01:52:43,346 --> 01:52:44,556
What is it, Leonard?

1587
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:48,560
The luggage is in the car and we've
only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1588
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:51,271
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1589
01:52:51,396 --> 01:52:52,731
Len!

1590
01:52:52,897 --> 01:52:54,524
Oh, Len!

1591
01:52:54,649 --> 01:52:56,317
Len...

1592
01:52:57,902 --> 01:53:01,614
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1593
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:04,242
Leonard, who's this girl?

1594
01:53:04,409 --> 01:53:07,078
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1595
01:53:07,245 --> 01:53:09,039
Tell her, Len.

1596
01:53:09,205 --> 01:53:12,667
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you in the travel bureau?

1597
01:53:12,792 --> 01:53:15,962
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1598
01:53:16,087 --> 01:53:20,759
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1599
01:53:20,884 --> 01:53:25,180
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1600
01:53:25,305 --> 01:53:31,227
and we're going away on a cruise,
just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1601
01:53:31,353 --> 01:53:36,358
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1602
01:53:36,483 --> 01:53:39,194
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

1603
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:42,280
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany,

1604
01:53:42,405 --> 01:53:45,617
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1605
01:53:45,742 --> 01:53:50,288
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1606
01:53:50,413 --> 01:53:53,291
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.

1607
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:58,004
Don't make it worse
or they'll try you as an accessory.

1608
01:53:58,171 --> 01:54:00,423
And you know what that means.

1609
01:54:00,548 --> 01:54:05,261
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1610
01:54:06,262 --> 01:54:08,890
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1611
01:54:09,015 --> 01:54:11,017
Iet them try me for...!

1612
01:54:11,142 --> 01:54:12,977
Argh!

1613
01:54:16,272 --> 01:54:18,108
(Diana screams)

1614
01:54:19,859 --> 01:54:21,695
(sobs)

1615
01:54:34,541 --> 01:54:39,129
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1616
01:54:40,171 --> 01:54:42,549
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1617
01:54:42,674 --> 01:54:44,676
Killed him?

1618
01:54:44,801 --> 01:54:47,095
She executed him.

1619
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,266
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

1620
01:54:51,433 --> 01:54:57,147
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1621
01:55:03,653 --> 01:55:07,615
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1622
01:55:07,741 --> 01:55:11,536
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1623
01:55:11,703 --> 01:55:14,789
We are not going yet, are we?

1624
01:55:17,167 --> 01:55:20,045
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1625
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:22,881
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,
and Mayhew too.

1626
01:55:23,006 --> 01:55:27,260
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1627
01:55:27,385 --> 01:55:29,220
Sir Wilfrid?

1628
01:55:29,346 --> 01:55:32,057
You've forgotten your brandy.

1629
01:55:54,704 --> 01:55:56,623
The management of this theatre suggests

1630
01:55:56,748 --> 01:56:01,002
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,

1631
01:56:01,127 --> 01:56:04,339
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending

1632
01:56:04,464 --> 01:56:07,175
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
