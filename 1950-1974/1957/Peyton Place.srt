1
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,634
My name is Allison MacKenzie.

2
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,637
Where I was born, time was told
not by the clock or the calendar...

3
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,518
...but by the seasons.

4
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,395
Summer was carefree contentment.

5
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,432
Autumn was that bittersweet time
of regret...

6
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,388
...for moments that had ended
and things that were yet undone.

7
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,838
And then winter fell...

8
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,192
...with a cold mantle
of caution and chill.

9
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,318
It nipped our noses
and our arrogance...

10
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,555
...and made use move closer to the
warm stoves of memory and desire.

11
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,071
Spring was promise.

12
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,352
But there was a fifth season...

13
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,839
...of love...

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,352
...and only the wise or the lucky ones
knew where to find it.

15
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,228
Hey, mister,
which way to Peyton Place?

16
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,115
Go up this road, about two miles.
You'll come right to the town.

17
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,639
Thanks.

18
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,155
Lucas stole my money.
He drinks everything in sight.

19
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,595
I saved for a year and a half
for a course.

20
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,399
Don't go, Paul.
You was my firstborn... .

21
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,950
- Hitting everyone in his way. Even you.
- Only when he's drinking.

22
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,879
That's been every night.
Why did you marry him?

23
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,113
When your real pa died, you and Selena
and Joey had to have a father.

24
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,794
Lucas tries hard to be a good man.

25
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,875
- Goodbye, Ma.
- Paul.

26
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,510
Selena, don't you ask me to stay.

27
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,638
My babysitting money.
I wish there was more.

28
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,879
Paul.

29
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,476
Paul, I'll do extra work.

30
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,753
I'll find a job and get
the money back. Don't leave.

31
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,275
I'm sorry we got into a fight.

32
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,275
It won't happen again.
I give you my word.

33
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,795
Paul, Paul!

34
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,954
He'll come back. You wait and see,
he'll come back.

35
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,279
Nellie...

36
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,876
...I'm going to try hard not
to drink anymore.

37
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,318
Selena...

38
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,635
...I'm gonna try harder
than I ever tried anything.

39
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,356
- Morning.
- Good morning.

40
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,159
May I have fried eggs
and a cup of coffee, please?

41
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,436
- All right.
- Do you have a washroom...

42
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,511
...where I can clean up?
- First door.

43
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,999
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

44
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,594
- What you selling?
- Nothing.

45
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,431
Sorry, I thought you might
be a traveling man.

46
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,835
No, I came here to get a job.

47
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,513
I should have known.

48
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,956
I hear Harrington Woolen Mills got
some government contracts...

49
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,031
...for military uniform cloth.

50
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,918
A lot of people will move here.

51
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,071
Which way is it to Harrington Mills?

52
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,114
Follow Elm Street to the river
then look up to your right.

53
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,398
You'll hate it.

54
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,270
- Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie.
- Morning, Nellie.

55
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,916
Paul left this morning.

56
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,230
- Left for where?
- Don't know.

57
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,437
Says he wants to leave town
and make something of himself.

58
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,034
Instead of working all the time
at the mill.

59
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,788
- He wants to see the world.
- Who is?

60
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,758
Paul. He left town this morning.

61
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,474
Allison, must you play records
so early?

62
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,079
Good breakfast music.

63
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,592
Digest your juice with culture.

64
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,872
I'm glad about Paul, Nellie.
How did Selena take it?

65
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,032
She's glad too. But she
ain't a mother. Neither are you.

66
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,510
I'd like to see the world.
Have a romance in Venice.

67
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,717
Meet a tall stranger in Hong Kong.

68
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,996
- Allison, don't eat so fast.
- Have to.

69
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,549
Senior class is giving a gift
to Ms. Thornton.

70
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,918
I wrote a speech that Rodney
Harrington's going to read.

71
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,355
- Badly, I'm sure.
- What's going on?

72
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,590
A meeting to appoint a new principal.

73
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,554
- How do you know it'll be Ms. Thornton?
- Nobody else deserves it.

74
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,915
I'll drop by the store after school.

75
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,119
Goodbye, Dad.

76
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,431
I wish you'd stop that ridiculous
performance every day.

77
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,433
What? Saying goodbye
or hello to my father?

78
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,993
Saying it to a photograph.

79
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,591
I suppose it's silly,
but it makes me feel that he's here.

80
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,318
You scarcely knew him.

81
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,199
It's not my fault he died
when I was two.

82
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,358
I can't remember him, I admit,
but I miss him.

83
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,158
You mean, you miss a father.

84
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,879
Yes, Mother.

85
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,671
Wouldn't it be nice if you had men
friends, or dates, or even marry again?

86
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,872
Stop talking about fathers,
husbands and marriage.

87
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,349
You miss him more
than I ever realized.

88
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,399
I'm sorry, Mother.

89
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,479
I'll be late.

90
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,873
Forgot the speech.

91
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,753
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.

92
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,232
- Good morning, Ms. Lancie.
- Good Morning, Allison.

93
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,799
Hi, David.

94
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,277
- Good morning, Mr. Herman.
- Morning, Miss Allison.

95
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,919
Go on home, Buffy.

96
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,396
- Hi, Dr. Swain.
- Morning, Allison.

97
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,915
- Good morning, girls.
- Morning, doctor.

98
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,549
- Good Morning, Mr. Cross.
- Morning.

99
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,479
Thank you, Norman.

100
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,997
- Everything's gone wrong this morning.
- Lf you didn't run all the time... .

101
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,796
Ted's bringing the gift.

102
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,832
Rodney.

103
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,399
Here's the speech.

104
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,473
- I'll never memorize this.
- Then just read it.

105
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,633
She's coming! Miss Thornton's coming!

106
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,633
Hey. Hey.

107
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,359
"The job of principal of
Peyton Place High School. "

108
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,039
Quiet.

109
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,279
Ms. Thornton, the senior class
has asked me to say a few words...

110
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,278
...and on behalf of them,
to present this gift to you.

111
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,189
"Our names are inscribed inside
the cover of that dictionary.

112
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,399
Because there are so many words
to express what we feel for you...

113
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,074
...and your long services
to the school...

114
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,915
...we decided to give you all the words
in the language.

115
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,396
We're losing you, but to something
bigger and more important:

116
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,353
The job of principal
of Peyton Place High School.

117
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,431
So you'll know we'll never forget...

118
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,559
...you can always turn to the words
love, friendship and remembrance...

119
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,518
...and know that we're always
thinking them. "

120
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,352
This is the loveliest thing
that ever happened to me.

121
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,799
I... .

122
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,710
There's another word in this book.

123
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,719
Gratitude.

124
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,958
Now, let's talk about graduation.

125
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,598
I would like a report from the
president of the class, Ted Carter.

126
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,156
Ms. Thornton, I've arranged
for all the necessary committees...

127
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,518
...and if they all do their jobs well,
I'm sure we'll have a fine graduation.

128
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,713
Vice president, Selena Cross.

129
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,759
The programs will be printed
in a couple of weeks...

130
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,957
...and I've rented caps and gowns
at $2.50 apiece.

131
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,669
And we're gonna have a tea
and a reception on the lawn afterwards.

132
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,595
Editor of the yearbook,
Allison MacKenzie.

133
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,434
The copy's all done.

134
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,751
But the engraver's going mad
waiting for all the pictures.

135
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,232
Whoever doesn't have his picture in
by Wednesday won't be in the yearbook.

136
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,196
Senior dance, Betty Anderson.

137
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,632
Everybody has to help
with the decorations.

138
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,076
The tickets are printed
and will go on sale a week before.

139
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,478
I'm supposed to announce there's
to be no necking in the parking lot.

140
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,309
Nor anywhere else, for that matter.

141
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,316
Harrington, Elsie Thornton
has earned the right to be principal.

142
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,916
She's given her life to this town.
At least we can recognize it.

143
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,675
As head of this school board,
it's my opinion she should be retired.

144
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,355
I'm afraid I can't quite concur with you.
I agree with Doc Swain.

145
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,956
You would.
Ms. Thornton's practically senile.

146
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,029
A hypochondriac, uses sleeping pills.
You want a drug addict for a principal?

147
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,074
Marion, it seems to me that I write
a lot of prescriptions for you.

148
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,437
As far as Ms. Thornton being senile,
she's of your generation.

149
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,238
She is not. I'm 36.

150
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,518
You're 45. My father delivered you
the year they built the courthouse, 1896.

151
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,954
We need someone young.

152
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,635
This fellow who's coming
is well recommended.

153
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,075
And I can get him
at the right price.

154
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,117
Mr. Harrington, he's outside.

155
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,036
He can't do us much good out there,
Ms. Colton. Send him in.

156
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,709
- Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?
- Yes. Thank you.

157
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,555
- Good morning.
- I'm Leslie Harrington.

158
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,039
This is the school board.

159
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,478
Mr. And Mrs. Partridge.
He's a lawyer. Dr. Swain.

160
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,837
Seth Bushwell. He's editor
of the Peyton Place Times.

161
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,715
Mr. Rossi, here's our situation.

162
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,316
We're prepared to offer the job
as principal to a qualified man...

163
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,119
...with a minimum guaranteed
five-year contract.

164
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,592
Mr. Rossi is a graduate of Penn State,
summa cum laude.

165
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,758
He holds a master's degree
in English and literature.

166
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,037
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.

167
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,033
Personally, now that I've
seen him, I like what I see.

168
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,431
- Did I miss anything?
- I've been working in construction.

169
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,552
If you're a teacher,
why were you working there?

170
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,188
I couldn't live on the salary
of a teacher.

171
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,193
This job starts at 3000 a year.

172
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,271
Then we're all wasting our time.

173
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,557
That's only $5 a week more
than I was making as a teacher.

174
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,429
But this offers you security.
A long-term contract.

175
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,239
Guaranteed poverty is not security.

176
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,790
I want 5000 a year and a raise
of 500 in the second year.

177
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,235
- We can't do it.
- You own this mill.

178
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,630
How much do you pay a foreman,
$200 a week?

179
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,435
This is business. These men manufacture
a product that makes money.

180
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,477
Be practical and face realities.

181
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,480
To people like you,
education is a necessary evil.

182
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,710
You can't see it,
so it's worth nothing.

183
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,838
Let me tell you this,
the things we can't see...

184
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,999
...are the most important things
on this earth. They're called ideas.

185
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,158
Thank you for the interview.

186
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,836
If we offer you 5000, would you
coach the basketball and football team?

187
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,831
No, I would not.

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,436
If you can't pay the principal
of your school a decent salary...

189
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,478
...you have no right to be
running a school.

190
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,278
Mr. Rossi.

191
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,798
Leslie, I'm afraid you're fighting
a losing battle.

192
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,958
Now, Mr. Rossi, frankly... .

193
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,156
In other words, the life history of the
race repeats itself in the individual.

194
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,553
- A notice from the school board.
- Thank you.

195
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,478
"Effective immediately...

196
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,837
...the school board of Peyton Place
is happy to announce...

197
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,912
...the appointment of a new
school principal:

198
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,756
Mr. Michael Rossi. "

199
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,199
Who?

200
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,949
"We trust that you will show him
the same loyalty and devotion...

201
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,998
...you displayed to the late Mr. Firth. "

202
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,279
Class dismissed.

203
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,873
I'm sorry, Ms. Thornton.

204
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,710
I don't know how they could do such
a thing. You deserve to be principal.

205
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,668
Allison, a person doesn't
always get what she deserves.

206
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,438
Remember it.

207
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,319
If there's anything in life you want,
go and get it.

208
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,631
Don't wait for anybody
to give it to you.

209
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,395
Now, I have some work to do.

210
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,633
See you later, Al.

211
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,033
- Here we are.
- Good-looking school, doc.

212
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,994
That must be the new principal,
you know?

213
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,239
They really give it to you, didn't they?

214
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,958
Like everybody else,
they really give it to you.

215
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,473
Have you been drinking?

216
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,077
Work yourself to death, then they
bring in an outsider to pick the plum.

217
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,958
You have been drinking.

218
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,116
I know you keep a bottle in the
basement, but I won't have you...

219
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,033
...bring it into the classroom, ever.
Don't forget.

220
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,118
It'd do your kids good to learn
how to handle liquor...

221
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,793
...instead of algebra.

222
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,679
- You're talking like a fool.
- Oh, be I.

223
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,510
I sat in this classroom four years.

224
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,669
I sat right here.

225
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,359
Everything important
was learned somewheres else.

226
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,953
You never applied yourself.

227
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,032
If you had, you might've
learned something in school.

228
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,952
Tell my wife, a cleaning woman.

229
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,237
- Tell me, a janitor, cleaning toilets.
- Stop it!

230
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,836
- Tell every mill worker behind on his bills.
- I said, stop it.

231
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,437
If you had applied yourself, you might
have learned how to live intelligently.

232
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,316
There ain't nobody in this here town
living intelligently. Nobody.

233
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,199
- I don't believe that.
- All right.

234
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,917
Name me one important person
graduated from this here school.

235
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,958
Name one. You can't.

236
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,709
I'm gonna tell you something,
Ms. Thornton...

237
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,872
...something you can
teach your class someday.

238
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,875
The minute they walk out that door,
they walk into a dog-eat-dog world.

239
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,597
It's crawl in front of the big dogs
if you want to eat, get a job.

240
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,913
I won't do it. I won't do it!

241
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,675
That's why I'm washing windows,
scrubbing walls, emptying ashes.

242
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,790
I never had nothing I ever wanted.

243
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,472
Shakespeare did me no more good...

244
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,949
...than Washington did
crossing the Delaware.

245
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,031
You didn't help yourself.

246
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,229
Elsie, I'd like to have you meet
Mike Rossi. Ms. Thornton.

247
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,796
- Hello, Ms. Thornton.
- Mr. Rossi.

248
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,916
- Welcome to Peyton Place.
- Thank you.

249
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
This is our utility man, Lucas Cross.

250
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,753
- Hello, Lucas.
- My hand's too dirty.

251
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,396
I'll start on another room.

252
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,392
Does he always drink?

253
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,792
He's disappointed for me. Loyalty is
always more passionate than reason.

254
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,350
I guess that's why I came
to see you first.

255
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,829
There was sentiment
for making you principal.

256
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,391
Please don't feel uncomfortable,
Mr. Rossi. My time came too late.

257
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,070
- I hope we can work together.
- Of course we can.

258
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,198
I suppose you have a lot of new,
progressive ideas.

259
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,314
No, not really. I'm rather
old-fashioned, as a matter of fact.

260
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,277
I have just two rules:

261
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,595
First, I want this school to teach
the truth as far as we know it.

262
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,548
I don't want any teacher making
a fairy tale out of life.

263
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,598
It's hard enough without
being unequipped to meet it.

264
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,239
That's a good rule.

265
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,833
Shall we sit down?

266
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,832
And rule two...

267
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,029
...teach a minimum of facts
and maximum of ideas.

268
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,432
Our main job is to teach children
how to think, not just to memorize.

269
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,392
If war comes for us...

270
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,597
...these kids shouldn't fight
just for historical dates...

271
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,910
...but for the ideals behind them.

272
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,955
I like your rules, Mr. Rossi.

273
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,514
Peyton Place is very fortunate.

274
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,112
Thank you, Ms. Thornton.

275
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,515
Allison, I don't know what Betty's
buying, but tell her to hurry.

276
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,999
Okay.

277
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,992
Mother, Ms. Thornton
didn't get the job.

278
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
I know. Betty and Margie told me.
They're in the back.

279
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,439
After giving her the gift and the speech,
it was embarrassing for her.

280
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,999
She'll get over it.

281
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,550
I'm glad I'm graduating.
I don't want to know the new principal.

282
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,435
- Mrs. MacKenzie, about graduation... .
- What about it, sweetie?

283
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,995
Mother needs a new dress
for the exercises.

284
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,594
Could I make some arrangement
to buy her one?

285
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,116
After I graduate I'll get a job
and I could pay you back.

286
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,390
You'll be needing
a new dress yourself.

287
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,676
I can get by.

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,631
Look, with Easter and graduation
coming on, I'll be needing some help.

289
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,354
Would you like to work
afternoons and Saturdays?

290
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,670
- I'd love to!
- Fine.

291
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,308
- Then I could buy two dresses.
- Wholesale.

292
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,711
No girl ever had two better friends
than you and Allison.

293
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,759
When you see how hard Mother makes
you work, you won't say that.

294
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,356
- Rodney's outside.
- Good, let him wait.

295
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,716
You'll be arrested for wearing that.

296
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,199
No, just picked up.

297
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,635
Mother says women
should be mysterious.

298
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,837
- Do you think the dress is too old?
- No, you're too young.

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,355
Won't people think you're a little fast?

300
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,355
According to my philosophy, what other
people think will not pay the rent.

301
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,752
If you're accused of being fast, might
as well run. Get the good things first.

302
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,749
Just remember, men can see
much better than they can think.

303
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,396
Believe me, a low-cut neckline
does more for a girl's future...

304
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,034
...than the entire
Britannica encyclopedia.

305
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,710
- Allison, could you help me a moment?
- Sure.

306
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,238
- Be right back.
- Do you think Rod will like it?

307
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,390
When you have
your 18th birthday party...

308
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,869
...I don't want you
to invite Betty Anderson.

309
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,792
I might as well not have a party.

310
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,515
If I can't invite Betty,
Rodney won't come.

311
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,999
I wouldn't mind that.

312
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,516
If Rodney won't come, his friends won't.
Then nobody will accept.

313
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,638
I can't understand why you want
to be friends with Betty.

314
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,360
I don't like the way
she talks about men and sex.

315
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,034
It appears the only
perfect individual is you.

316
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,475
We've had 17 dull
birthday parties alone.

317
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,154
Could you let me have one
for myself, please?

318
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,428
Allison, what about Betty?

319
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,757
Hi, Norman.

320
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,478
Oh, hi, Allison.

321
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,799
What's the matter?

322
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,991
Same old thing.

323
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,278
Grownups who act like children.

324
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,717
Hey, could I walk home with you?

325
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,871
No. You'd get home late.

326
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,156
You mean,
your mother wouldn't like it.

327
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,473
- Well... .
- Come on, Norman. Come on.

328
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,159
Spend the afternoon
in the library again?

329
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,639
Yeah.

330
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,640
Isn't it awfully dull
going there every day?

331
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,559
Yeah.

332
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,236
Then why do you do it?

333
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,230
I like books. Good place
to do my homework.

334
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,394
Besides, where else could I go
but home?

335
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,838
Go down to the water.

336
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,752
Sit in the square.

337
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,191
Take a walk in the woods.

338
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,159
I can't.

339
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,756
You know, that was a nice speech
you wrote for Mrs. Thornton.

340
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,958
I'm sorry I did it now.

341
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,430
Why didn't you read it yourself
instead of Rodney Harrington?

342
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,870
Because I was afraid I'd cry.

343
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,999
Still might cry every time I think
of Ms. Thornton not getting that job.

344
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,672
You know, you just might turn out
to be a great writer.

345
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,910
Norman, I hope so.

346
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,115
You know, every time I touch
a book or read a story...

347
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,669
...or even when I
just open the dictionary...

348
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,593
...something inside of me
goes thump...

349
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,233
...and my heart starts pounding,
and my stomach.

350
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,358
You know, it's how people are supposed
to feel when they fall in love.

351
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,431
Of course, I never have.

352
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,628
I wish I could be so sure of
what I wanted to do.

353
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,991
You must have some idea.

354
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,399
No.

355
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,797
No, I've thought of everything,
but nothing seems to fit me.

356
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,554
Maybe I'll be unique
and retire at the age of 18.

357
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,075
Norman, it's about time
you got home.

358
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,673
Hello, Ms. Page.

359
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,428
- Goodbye, Norman.
- Wait just a minute, will you?

360
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,235
- But you...
- I don't want to go in just yet.

361
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,915
Norman, what an awful thing,
hating to go home.

362
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,439
Come on in here.

363
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,358
Well, thanks for walking with me.

364
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,272
I enjoyed it, really.

365
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,712
Goodbye.

366
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,199
Goodbye.

367
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,555
- May I walk on it, Nellie?
- Sure, it's dry by now.

368
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,316
- Your mother wants you to call her.
- I really don't feel like it.

369
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,472
You two have a fight again?

370
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,438
Same fight, different round.

371
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,472
- Nellie?
- Yeah.

372
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,872
You've been both a daughter and
a mother. Which one is worse?

373
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,395
- Being a mother.
- Why?

374
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,070
You find yourself
doing the same things...

375
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,708
...you hated your own
mother and father doing.

376
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,791
That's very interesting.

377
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,791
Doesn't somebody get intelligent...

378
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,679
...and realize children
must grow up their own way?

379
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,191
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.

380
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,673
Kids get born and you just worry
about them and you hope for them.

381
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,474
Well, I gotta get going.

382
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,038
- Good night, Nellie.
- Good night, Allison.

383
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,397
Hello? Oh, hello, Mother.

384
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,670
I've been thinking it over.

385
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,400
You can invite anyone you want
to your party.

386
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,272
Oh, Mother, thank you.

387
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,953
Thank you very much.

388
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,435
I'll be home in a little while.

389
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,353
Bye.

390
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,355
2676J, please.

391
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,678
Hey, watch where you're going there,
buddy, will you?

392
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,599
- Thanks much.
- Thank you.

393
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,678
- I want it.
- You don't need any.

394
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,432
I want some!

395
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,671
- Would you like a sandwich, Norman?
- No, thank you.

396
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,199
Excuse me. Excuse me.

397
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,038
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

398
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,553
- How are you?
- How are you?

399
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,876
- Betty and Rodney.
- Where's Ted Carter?

400
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,473
Right here.

401
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,552
Let's stop that corny music
and do some serious dancing.

402
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,029
- Those are good records.
- These are new ones.

403
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,509
- I brought some mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?

404
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,558
- Hang it high, will you?
- Only if I can kiss Betty.

405
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,392
Tonight, nobody is safe from me.

406
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,519
- Hey, Christmas is eight months away.
- I do my Christmas kissing early.

407
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,069
- Hey!
- Where's the punch?

408
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,719
- It's over there.
- Oh, good.

409
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,992
- Add the old family formula.
- Now you're talking, Rod.

410
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,752
My mother wouldn't want me to...

411
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,878
- Don't tell me she's here.
- No, she's at the movies.

412
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,712
Put the booze in the bowl.

413
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,950
That's the one thing
she made me promise.

414
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,792
You want to have a party or not?

415
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,633
- You can't fight city hall.
- Put the liquor in.

416
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,236
Forget it. I know 10 other ways
to make a party successful.

417
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,632
Now, first, we gotta make
the atmosphere a little more intimate.

418
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,109
Rodney, aren't you the one.

419
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,230
- Evening.
- Good evening. Hello, doc.

420
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,913
Hi, Connie.

421
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,390
- Just coffee, please.
- Right.

422
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,279
Who's that, doc?

423
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,594
That's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.

424
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,399
She has a daughter
in the senior class, Allison.

425
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,039
Beautiful woman.

426
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,275
She's a widow. Born here,
but she had ambitions, and left.

427
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,399
Married in New York to some ad genius.
When he died, she came back here.

428
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,718
- I'd like to meet her.
- Wouldn't do you no good.

429
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,239
Bring your coffee.

430
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,356
Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi,
the new school principal.

431
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,873
- How do you do?
- Hello.

432
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,315
I hear about you every day
from my daughter.

433
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,276
You've been working kind of late?

434
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,752
No, I've been to the movies.
Allison's giving a party.

435
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,115
What does she plan to do
after graduation?

436
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,919
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her in college.

437
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,914
It's too bad she has
no brothers and sisters.

438
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,993
- Why do you say that?
- Just that I'm against only-child families.

439
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,596
Only children receive all
the attention of the parents.

440
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,638
- Good and bad.
- I don't think Allison turned out badly.

441
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,037
She hasn't turned out yet.
Her life is just beginning.

442
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,158
It's too late to give her
any brothers and sisters.

443
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,835
In your case, I'd say it wasn't.

444
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,713
If I didn't like you so much,
Matt... . No use...

445
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,075
Now, Connie, don't you go
proposing to me.

446
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,915
- For you, doc.
- Excuse me.

447
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,279
Would you like a cigarette?

448
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,551
- Swain speaking.
- Thank you.

449
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,199
I'll be right over.

450
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,790
Speak of babies and they appear.
Mrs. Runkle's in labor.

451
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,279
I'll see you later.

452
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,079
Thanks, doc.

453
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,559
- Bye.
- Bye.

454
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,874
Doc Swain's always talking
about babies.

455
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,157
- They're his stock-in-trade.
- Not a bad subject.

456
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,035
We teach schoolchildren English and
math and history, and yet...

457
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,431
...we neglect what gives them
the most trouble in life.

458
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,154
You don't recommend classes
in baby-making?

459
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,155
Only in theory. I intend to initiate
a sex-education course in the school.

460
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,154
- Isn't that a function of the home?
- You'd think.

461
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,279
And yet not one parent in 10 does it.
No, sex is taboo in the home.

462
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,510
And it should be in the schools.

463
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,834
Where would they learn it,
in parked cars?

464
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,911
They'll learn it when they marry.

465
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,557
Good night, Mr. Rossi.

466
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,669
Doc Swain offers a special price
for frostbites.

467
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,950
- Come on, Allison.
- Rodney.

468
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,959
Allison!

469
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,590
This was supposed to be
a birthday party.

470
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,275
Just playing "photography": Turn off
the lights, see what develops.

471
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,153
Don't be fresh.
Just leave immediately.

472
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,598
- All of you!
- I just caught her under the mistletoe.

473
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,273
Will you please leave?

474
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,753
Happy birthday, Allison.
Come on, Betty.

475
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,119
I'm sorry.

476
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,309
Thanks anyway.

477
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,512
Thanks, Allison.

478
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,479
Come out here.

479
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,272
Allison, I said come out here.

480
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,269
I knew this would happen
if you invited Betty.

481
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,715
- Wasn't her fault.
- And you making love...

482
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,110
We were kissing, one kiss,
not making love.

483
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,113
The house in darkness,
and couples necking all over.

484
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,840
I know, but everyone wanted
to dance in the dark.

485
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,396
And I couldn't very well... .

486
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,870
Mother, at every party in this town,
they turn out the lights.

487
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,315
I don't want you to be like everybody.

488
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,511
I want you to rise above Peyton Place.

489
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,592
It's my home, my town.
Why should I wanna rise above it?

490
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,716
Because its standards are low.

491
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,031
Its people spend their time
trying to drag each other down.

492
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,872
I don't want to be perfect.

493
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,111
I don't want to live in a test tube.

494
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,630
I just want to be me, and have some fun,
and have some friends.

495
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,356
I'd rather be liked than be perfect.

496
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,869
By liked, you mean being pawed by
an animal with one thing on his mind.

497
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,471
Don't make it sound like that. Everything
has to be learned, even kissing.

498
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,116
And sex? Is that what you're going
to practice at your next party?

499
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,835
You keep trying to accuse me of things
I'm not even thinking about.

500
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,035
I don't want you to get a reputation
for a half-hour's carelessness.

501
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,475
I already have one. The wrong kind.

502
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,316
I want you to fall in love...

503
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,597
...and at the proper time,
to marry a man who respects you.

504
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,830
I want you to have a good name.
I want...

505
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,195
You want! You want! You want!

506
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,913
Is that all you can say?

507
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,511
Well, if any man would ask me,
I'd run away and become his mistress.

508
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,352
Don't you ever let me hear you
say a thing like that again!

509
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,238
I don't know why I said it.

510
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,151
I don't know why I said it.

511
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,759
Allison.

512
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,793
Hello, Trudy.

513
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,188
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Joey.

514
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,920
- Selena'll be out in a couple minutes.
- Thank you.

515
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,116
Come on in back.
I got a new baby lamb.

516
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,077
Oh, I'd love to see it.

517
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,118
Oh, it's darling.

518
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,516
I didn't show you my lizard.

519
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,275
I keep him in a box right there.

520
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,830
I got some holes punched in it,
just so he can breathe.

521
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,793
His name is Pocahontas.

522
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,351
Used to be, a man didn't have to cook
his own meals in his own house.

523
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,996
Times have changed. Ma's working,
and I'm late for church.

524
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,836
The way you parade yourself
up and down, taking off your clothes...

525
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,911
- I don't parade up and down.
- You do!

526
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,550
- You just like to show yourself off.
- I don't like to show off!

527
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,633
Just because we don't live in a palace,
doesn't mean we have to act like pigs.

528
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,588
- We've got a trash can, remember?
- Well, well, well.

529
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,797
If you don't pick it up,
somebody else has to.

530
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,357
And it wouldn't harm you to take
the garbage out and bury it.

531
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,317
Or do you like living like a pig?

532
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,040
What do you think you are,
always giving orders?

533
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,673
Take your hands off of me!

534
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,437
Don't you touch her.
Don't you touch her anymore!

535
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,188
Just a little family fracas. Guess my
little girl's getting too big to spank.

536
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,516
It was my fault, Allison.
I made him mad.

537
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,878
Every family has fights.
They're forgotten in an hour.

538
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,039
Come on.

539
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,230
Hey, Norman, you know what?

540
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,434
There's a place I know that I'd like
to show you, that no one knows about.

541
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,389
Not even you. It's my secret place.

542
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,158
I know every spot within three miles
of Peyton Place.

543
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,878
Not this one. Come on.

544
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,518
You were right. I never knew
this place was here.

545
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,398
I don't think anybody does but me.
And maybe God.

546
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,993
And now you.

547
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,518
It's beautiful.

548
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,677
I've just decided. This is the last time
I'm ever going to come here.

549
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,359
Why?

550
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,671
Oh, I'm gonna leave it
for somebody else to find.

551
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,035
Maybe your children will discover it.

552
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,317
I'm never going to marry.
I'm just going to have lovers.

553
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,273
Oh, Allison.

554
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,158
What's wrong with that?

555
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,191
No children to grow up unhappy,
nobody gets hurt except maybe me.

556
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,272
That's the worst kind
of emotional maladjustment.

557
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,919
Who said so?

558
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,948
- A book I read.
- What book?

559
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,640
I sent for a book. It was $ 1.98,
in a plain wrapper.

560
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,956
- A plain wrapper?
- Yeah, a plain wrap...

561
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,237
And, well, it was
about marriage and sex.

562
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,269
I had it sent to me at the post office.

563
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,716
It took me two weeks to get up
the courage to go pick it up.

564
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,119
Look... .

565
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,273
I know it sounds funny, but it was
the only way I could find out anything.

566
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,078
Norman, you know what?

567
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,438
I sent for a book just like that
in the same plain wrapper...

568
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,388
...general delivery.
- No, really? The same one?

569
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,157
And I read every word of it, and I think
most of it's mid-Victorian nonsense.

570
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,635
Maybe yours was better.
Hey, want to trade books?

571
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,230
No. I'd be too embarrassed.

572
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,395
That's your whole trouble, Norman.

573
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,749
Everything embarrasses you.
Everything frightens you.

574
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,239
I know.

575
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,832
And I'm sorry we started talking
about all this.

576
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,790
Hey, Norman, look... .

577
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,190
It's about time you learned that girls
want to do the same things as boys.

578
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,431
And they have the right to know how.
I mean, I think we should help each other.

579
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,350
- Are you suggesting that...?
- Norman, don't get me wrong.

580
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,791
All I want is some normal,
intelligent discussion...

581
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,351
...and maybe some normal affection
between a boy and a girl, nothing more.

582
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,112
Everybody in this town hides
behind plain wrappers.

583
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,831
You're so afraid.

584
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,631
You've even been afraid
to ask me to the graduation dance.

585
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,635
Allison, I want... . Well, see,
I'm just not asking anybody.

586
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,037
- I'll be there, but I can't ask you.
- Why not?

587
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,952
Well, my mother.

588
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,639
Your mother.

589
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,118
Well, she wouldn't actually forbid it.

590
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,511
It's just that she gets jealous
of anybody at all...

591
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,636
...that I spend my time with.

592
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,991
You don't know her.

593
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,469
You don't have to live with her.

594
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,713
But she's my mother.

595
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,754
There's nothing I can do about that.

596
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,475
You don't have to tell me
any more, Norman.

597
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,955
Please, Allison,
I've gotta tell somebody.

598
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,590
She won't let me have friends.

599
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,152
She... .

600
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,152
She makes me tell her 10 times a day
how much I love her.

601
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,149
She's afraid she'll die alone
in a poorhouse.

602
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,992
And marriage... .

603
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,233
Marriage, she says, is misery.
And a woman can only cause me trouble.

604
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,319
Oh, Norman, I can't believe it.

605
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,432
Nobody would.

606
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,512
Now maybe you know why I hate
to go home...

607
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,240
...and why I live in the library...

608
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,878
...and why I can't dance, or kiss girls,
or look anybody in the eye.

609
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,237
You see, I'm a sissy and a coward.

610
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,438
No, you're not, Norman.

611
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,158
No one around town stopped to think
and give you a chance.

612
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,109
You shouldn't be afraid of girls.

613
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,477
I know, but I am, and I don't know
what I can do about it.

614
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,154
- I know what you can do.
- What?

615
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,272
You can start with me.

616
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,355
I'll prove everything your mother
ever said was wrong.

617
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,036
Would you kiss me, Norman?

618
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,158
- I don't think I can.
- Yes, you could.

619
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,559
Kiss me.

620
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,713
I don't know why
I should act so experienced.

621
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,030
It was only my second kiss this year.

622
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,398
It wasn't as good as Rodney's, was it?

623
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,119
No.

624
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,756
Hello, I guess I should've phoned...

625
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,753
...but I was in the neighborhood...
- That's all right.

626
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,593
I have a message for Allison.
Is she home?

627
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,309
No, she and Selena have just gone over
to Kathy Ellsworth's house.

628
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,358
That gives me a good excuse
to talk to you.

629
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,512
- May I come in?
- Oh, of course.

630
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,353
- You have a lovely house.
- Thank you.

631
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,359
Please come in.

632
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,951
This is a very comfortable room.

633
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,989
Good books, pictures.
My own hotel room is a bit basic.

634
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,751
I have a mirror for shaving, a basin for
washing and a closet to hang my coat.

635
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,273
You ought to find a house.

636
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,714
I'm trying to.

637
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,271
In the meantime, I have my hotel room,
which I clear out of right after dinner.

638
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,998
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me.

639
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,837
I was telling you something,
but you weren't listening.

640
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,839
Your husband?

641
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,716
He died when Allison was 2.

642
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,557
And Allison.

643
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,719
- A few years ago.
- She's grown a bit since then.

644
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,953
I came to tell you that Allison
has been named valedictorian.

645
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,233
Wonderful. She'll be terribly pleased,
and so am I.

646
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,036
She's a fine girl, bright and sensitive.
You should be very proud of her.

647
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,719
Yes, I am.

648
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,830
Well, that's what I came about.

649
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,758
Good night, Mrs. MacKenzie.

650
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,070
You are lonely here, aren't you?

651
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,994
It's not the worst thing
that can happen to you.

652
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,152
- Isn't it?
- You can learn to live by yourself.

653
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,312
You can get used to it.

654
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,597
Maybe. But that doesn't make it
the best way to live.

655
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,150
The best way?
What would that be?

656
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,039
People meeting, talking.

657
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,390
Well, in Peyton Place,
two people talking is a conspiracy.

658
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,753
A meeting is an assignation, and getting
to know one another is a scandal.

659
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,197
I think you're hard on the town
and hard on yourself.

660
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,352
No, I'm quite all right the way I am.

661
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,556
What were you gonna do tonight?

662
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,871
Wash your hair? Read a book?
Go to the movies alone?

663
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,870
- Well, it makes time pass.
- Time shouldn't just pass.

664
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,473
It should be used.

665
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,912
I wouldn't know where to begin.

666
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,992
Begin at the beginning,
begin by getting out.

667
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,550
We need another chaperon
for the dance.

668
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,472
Why don't you help us out?

669
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,918
Will you come?

670
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,439
I think I'd like that.

671
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,673
Fine.

672
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,119
Good night, and thanks.

673
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,709
- Good night.
- Good night.

674
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,233
- Betty Anderson's father stopped me.
- What did he want?

675
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,517
He asked when you'll marry Betty,
before or during college.

676
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,157
- I hadn't exactly thought of marrying her.
- I wouldn't hear of it if you wanted to.

677
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,232
Anderson's a good foreman,
but Betty is something else.

678
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,914
- Yeah, I agree.
- Then stop seeing her.

679
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,629
I just can't stop seeing her.
I invited her to the graduation dance.

680
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,951
- Uninvite her.
- Now, Dad, I can't do that.

681
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,109
You're gonna.

682
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,511
Do you realize what it'd mean
if you married the local tramp?

683
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,797
When you marry, you'll marry
someone on your own level.

684
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,393
Call and tell her it's off.

685
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,790
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Call her.

686
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,956
- Please, Dad.
- Go on, call her!

687
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,393
1042W, please.

688
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,553
I can understand you wanting to see
this girl, but not in public.

689
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,039
You know what I mean.

690
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,516
Nobody's fighting you.
I'll be as big a Harrington as you are.

691
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,672
I'll marry a cold fish,
then cheat the rest of my life.

692
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,910
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

693
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,230
But the graduation dance
is important.

694
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,755
You want a new car, don't you?

695
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,234
Betty? Hello, Betty. This is Rodney.

696
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,357
Look, Betty, this is so terrible,
I don't know where to begin.

697
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,748
Tell her.

698
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,229
Betty, the graduation dance is off.

699
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,359
She hung up. What a fine graduation.

700
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,750
- I know someone you can take.
- Who?

701
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,234
Allison MacKenzie.

702
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,198
Her mother kicked me out of the house
for kissing her.

703
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,352
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison's a girl of quality.

704
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,911
Quality's a very good thing in woolen
cloth, but it's very dull on a big date.

705
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,998
I didn't know you were
such a good dancer, Allison.

706
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,957
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

707
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,514
- Hi, Rod.
- Hi there, Allison.

708
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,069
Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?

709
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,749
After the dance,
shall we go to Rockland?

710
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,239
Okay.

711
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,999
Oh, really?

712
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,910
- Some more, Mrs. MacKenzie?
- No, thank you, Ms. Thornton.

713
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,995
May I have this dance,
Mrs. MacKenzie?

714
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,075
I haven't danced for such a long time,
I'm afraid I'd be terrible.

715
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,549
Dancing isn't something you forget.

716
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,918
I promised a dance to Betty, the second
one after intermission. Do you mind?

717
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,991
No, not if you promised it to her.

718
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,799
- Well, I'll see you around, okay?
- Okay.

719
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,959
Allison.

720
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,874
Did you see your mother
dancing with Mr. Rossi?

721
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,032
- I've never seen my mother dance.
- Standing over there.

722
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,351
They make a good-looking couple.

723
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,359
They do?

724
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,753
- Hi, Norman.
- Hi.

725
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,956
Dance with me, Norman.

726
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,630
- I don't know how.
- Just try.

727
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,871
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

728
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,076
Hey, Rodney, you got a new car.

729
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,794
Yeah. Hey, come on, get in.

730
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,719
Rodney, it's beautiful.

731
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,036
Here we are, snug as peas in a pod.

732
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,950
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

733
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,839
Hey, I'm mad at you.

734
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,432
Come on, Betty.

735
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,596
You really want to kiss me, don't you?

736
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,588
- Boy, do I.
- Tell me how much. Tell me.

737
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,149
I wanna kiss you more than anyone
in the world.

738
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,788
I wanna kiss you 1000 times.
I never wanna stop.

739
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,236
That's pretty good.
I'll give you one kiss.

740
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,191
What would Allison say?

741
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,193
Why bring her name up
at a time like this?

742
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,240
Only one kiss to a customer.

743
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,753
Betty, I couldn't help it.
My father made me call you.

744
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,797
Wouldn't you rather be with me?

745
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,151
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Tell me how much.

746
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,474
In the whole world,
in the whole wide world...

747
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,757
...there's nobody I'd rather be with
than you, Betty.

748
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,077
Give me another kiss.

749
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,839
Oh, honey, honey.

750
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,035
- You want to make love to me?
- Yes, yes, of course I want to.

751
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,709
Now go make love
to Allison MacKenzie!

752
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,553
Go get the girl you brought
and try it with her.

753
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,396
The next time I go out, it will be
with a man, not a papa's boy!

754
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,878
Ladies and gentlemen.

755
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,955
Pupils and faculty of Peyton Place
High School, and especially the seniors.

756
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,839
They tell me it is a tradition here
to end each graduation dance with...

757
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,319
..."Auld Lang Syne. "

758
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,276
Since I'm new here and not yet
part of your traditions...

759
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,592
...I think the song should be led by
a woman who has been with you long.

760
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,751
Ms. Elsie Thornton.

761
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,997
Thank you, Mr. Rossi.

762
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,156
We're a small spot in a small town
on a great big map.

763
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,837
And maybe Peyton Place High School
isn't a name that shakes the world...

764
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,999
...but it's a part
of each of you forever.

765
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,555
Make it great by honoring it...

766
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,070
...and come back to see us
whenever you can.

767
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,435
Now let's form a big circle...

768
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,151
...everyone holding hands.

769
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,757
It's an odd feeling, being in a school
when it's so quiet.

770
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,990
I always think of it as sleeping...

771
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,197
...resting up from the pounding
it takes during the day.

772
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,590
- Do you work at night?
- Yes, quite often.

773
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,957
You don't realize the preparation
it takes to be a teacher.

774
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,479
It's like... .

775
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,753
It's like all these kids were my own.
I love them. I want so much for them.

776
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,438
It's more than a job to you,
isn't it?

777
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,319
I didn't mean to sound
like the dedicated idealist.

778
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,630
Well, there's nothing wrong in that.

779
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,479
Connie.

780
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:58,953
- I did want to thank you for coming.
- You don't have to. I enjoyed everything.

781
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,589
Including the dancing?

782
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,553
Including.

783
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,831
You're wasting your time, Mike.

784
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,557
I had my love a long time ago.

785
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,152
And when my husband died,
I came back here.

786
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,355
And I've had no time for anything
but Allison and the dress shop.

787
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,353
- You've got time now.
- It's too late.

788
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,478
- Look, Connie. If I were...
- I said it's too late.

789
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,079
I made my choice...

790
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,599
...Iong ago.

791
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,278
Please take me home.

792
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,439
Sure.

793
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,391
Selena, let's get married.

794
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,799
You mean now?

795
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,110
Sure. I can get a full-time job.

796
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,999
But what about college and law school
that you've always talked about?

797
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,915
That's just a dream. I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make enough...

798
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:16,029
Whose father does? Not everyone
in college is a millionaire's son.

799
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,718
Don't get so steamed up.

800
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,998
Ted Carter, you've always wanted
to be a lawyer. Now, go be it.

801
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,828
Don't crumple up at the first obstacle.

802
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,316
The first obstacle's the biggest,
the money.

803
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,993
Well, then get over that
and the rest should be easy.

804
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,319
Do you know how long it takes
to become a lawyer?

805
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,434
What difference does it make?
It's what you wanna do in life.

806
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,593
One of the things I want to do
is marry you.

807
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,399
If I don't do it now,
maybe I never will.

808
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,071
Ted, the only family I'll ever have
will be half yours.

809
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,989
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.

810
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,319
Good night.

811
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,559
Good night, Selena.

812
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,839
Ted...

813
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,999
...thank you.

814
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,599
Ma?

815
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,759
Ma?

816
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,799
Joey?

817
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,072
I thought you was something
out of a dream.

818
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,196
Where's Ma and Joey?

819
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,318
Let's have a drink,
celebrate your growing up.

820
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,595
Where's Ma and Joey?

821
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,514
They're working at a party at
Harrington's. Let's have a drink.

822
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,030
Rather stay in the dark,
getting kissed by Ted Carter.

823
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,391
I'm going to bed.

824
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,120
It's about time I started teaching
you something.

825
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,430
Lucas! Let me go, Lucas!

826
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,112
Never had nothing I ever wanted.

827
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,311
Never had a beautiful woman.

828
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,559
Let me up.

829
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:07,149
Let me offer to the class of 1941
this fond farewell.

830
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,034
The world outside waits for you.

831
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,836
It is a world full of love
and rich in opportunity.

832
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,514
There may be dangers, but if you hold
firm to your purpose and your ideals...

833
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,593
...you will storm the ramparts
of success and capture them.

834
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,833
Tomorrow you grow up
and your true happiness begins.

835
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,432
- Thank you.
- My best wishes to you.

836
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,592
Selena Cross.

837
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,599
Norman.

838
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,469
At first a diploma seemed
like a reward for the past...

839
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,753
...but once in your hand,
it became an obligation to the future.

840
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,756
Independence was a distant word
that we suddenly owned...

841
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,036
...and we exploded with it.

842
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,158
Some of us splashed
away the summer...

843
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,392
...or swooped and stretched
with joyfulness...

844
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,996
...and emptied our childish piggy banks
of their play money.

845
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,916
Yet others of us, eager to feel adult
or out of necessity...

846
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,957
...began our work early.

847
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,997
- Put the bottle up on top.
- Here?

848
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,115
And gradually, as the happy confusion
of summer faded...

849
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:35,832
...one by one, we knew the Monday
morning of responsibility was at hand.

850
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,953
- Hi, Mr. Rossi.
- Hello, Allison.

851
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,874
Did you read those stories
I gave you?

852
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,270
Yes, I read them.

853
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,359
Well?

854
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,476
- When did you write them?
- All summer.

855
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,996
- Ever since graduation.
- Has anybody else seen them?

856
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,918
Only Selena.

857
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,156
She thinks I'm a genius.

858
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:11,071
What do you think? Are they good
enough to send to a magazine?

859
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,268
Yes, if you want to end up in prison.

860
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,472
Those stories were full of enough
libel and slander...

861
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,279
...and double-entendre to hang us all.

862
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,989
Allison, is that how Peyton Place
really looks to you?

863
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,150
They were only fiction.
I didn't use any real names.

864
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,670
You didn't have to.
I recognized everybody in town.

865
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:37,189
But let's get down to the important part.
You have a talent.

866
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,716
Those stories were a good start.
Now, where do you go from here?

867
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,754
That's what I hoped to find out
from you.

868
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,912
Then I suggest college.
With your talent and your ideas...

869
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,631
Thank you, but I don't want to go
to college. I never have.

870
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,273
Why not?

871
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,876
Because I don't want to study
about writing. I want to write.

872
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,917
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare
was a wonderful writer...

873
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,799
...or that wonderful books
have already been written.

874
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,191
Those books tell you how and why.

875
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,510
I'd rather find that out myself
at a typewriter.

876
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,996
I need someplace to get me going.
Someplace to start.

877
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,239
All right...

878
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,751
...if that's how you feel about it,
then let's do it.

879
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,793
Let's start at the Peyton Place Times.

880
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,431
Who said I was a cynical,
hard-hearted newspaperman?

881
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,518
Aren't all newspapermen?

882
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,475
That's a myth. We're the most
sentimental slobs in the world.

883
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,837
- The softest touches there are.
- Prove it.

884
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,919
All right.

885
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,709
When do I start? All I want is a chance
to show what I can do.

886
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,440
Write something up this week,
I'll run it Friday.

887
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,751
Thank you, Mr. Bushwell.
I'll start right away.

888
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,230
- I'll dig up a story you'll never forget.
- I don't doubt it.

889
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,710
Just remember, there's no such
thing as a cheap lawsuit.

890
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,633
Hold on. We haven't discussed pay.

891
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,189
You don't have to.
I'll do it for experience.

892
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,875
The first thing experience teaches us
is to get paid.

893
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,952
Five dollars a column to start.
More later.

894
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,199
That's more... .

895
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,516
I wouldn't want these stories
to fall into the wrong hands.

896
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,708
Thanks, Seth.

897
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,669
There's no question, the tests confirm
that you're pregnant, Selena.

898
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,269
I'd say about three months.

899
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,552
- Who's the father?
- I won't tell you.

900
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,514
Now, what kind of rot is that?
You're not the first girl in the world...

901
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,797
...who had to get married.
Or in this town, for that matter.

902
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,155
Who's the father? Ted Carter?

903
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,276
- No.
- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!

904
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,749
I'm not lying to you.

905
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,912
Doc, help me. I need your help.

906
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,230
What do you mean by "help"?

907
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,437
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.

908
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,477
There's nothing I can give you.

909
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,633
Tell me who's responsible. I can help you
that way. You can get married.

910
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,836
He's already married.

911
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,474
Then he'll have to take care of you
and provide for the baby. Who is it?

912
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,632
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!

913
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,477
I've done a lot of things,
but I've never broken a law.

914
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,837
What you're asking me to do
is break the law of man and God.

915
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,350
Now, tell me, who is the man?

916
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,795
Selena, tell me who he is. Who is he?

917
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,272
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather! It's Lucas!

918
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,595
Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink.

919
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,916
I've got Selena in my office.

920
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,399
Selena? What for?

921
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,235
She's pregnant.

922
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,033
I told her she'd get in trouble.
Always wrestling with that Carter boy.

923
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:03,949
- I told her, she wouldn't listen...
- You low, miserable, crazy slime.

924
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,157
- Don't you go shoving...
- That's your child she's carrying.

925
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,954
- It ain't.
- I can prove it, Lucas.

926
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,878
I've got enough proof on you
to put you in jail for the rest of your life.

927
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,554
- I never touched her.
- Here, sign that.

928
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,557
It's a statement of the facts.

929
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,439
Are you out of your mind?
I never touched her!

930
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,319
Maybe you'd like the police
to sweat it out of you.

931
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,995
I never touched her, and I ain't
gonna sign nothing that said I did.

932
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,517
If you don't want to sign this paper,
that's up to you.

933
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,559
Hey, doc... .

934
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,870
You know I couldn't do nothing
as awful as that, don't you?

935
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,632
I'm going back to my office.

936
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,679
I'm gonna start telephoning
every father in Peyton Place.

937
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,279
You wouldn't.

938
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,273
I don't know what they'll do,
but I do know this:

939
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,671
You're the janitor in a school
full of young girls...

940
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,877
...and an hour from now,
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.

941
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,632
Don't do it.

942
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,190
I wouldn't think of fooling around
with any other girls.

943
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,476
It was just Selena, doc.

944
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,474
Well, there was something about her.
It was just Selena.

945
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,358
Please, doc, don't.

946
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,359
There's only one thing that'll stop me.

947
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,072
You sign that.

948
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,476
If I sign it, what are you
gonna do with it?

949
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,790
I'll lock it up in my safe.

950
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,839
Give me the pen.

951
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,551
Now, get out
and leave a man to work.

952
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,995
No, Lucas. You get out.

953
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,479
- You get out of Peyton Place before dark.
- Doc, I signed it for you!

954
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,952
If you do, I'll keep this in my safe.
But if you don't, I'll use it against you.

955
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,269
I signed it!

956
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:05,230
Don't you ever try to come back here.
Not next week, not next year, not ever.

957
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,152
If you do, I'll kill you myself.

958
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,799
Why you little... .

959
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,952
Mary.

960
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,396
Unofficially, this was a miscarriage...

961
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,632
...but officially, for the records,
it's an appendectomy.

962
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,156
- That's a lie.
- I removed her appendix. Understand?

963
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,754
You want to ruin a girl's life
for one word?

964
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,310
- No, but falsifying records... .
- I'll make them out personally...

965
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,438
...and if you tell anybody
this wasn't an appendectomy...

966
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,797
...I'll tell the whole town about you
and that drug salesman.

967
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,552
Doc, that's blackmail.

968
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,278
It sure is.

969
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,399
Nellie, she's all right now.
She's just fine.

970
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,919
Thank God.

971
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,678
What a disgrace, disgrace!

972
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,432
- Disgrace!
- Nellie.

973
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,718
Don't talk that way. Nobody's ever
gonna know but the three of us.

974
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,950
People find out.
They always find out.

975
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:34,148
Nobody will find out as long as you
don't say a word. Understand?

976
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,919
- No, I won't.
- Good.

977
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,752
Now, you run on home now.

978
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,232
- Thank you, doctor.
- That's a good girl.

979
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,159
Thanks.

980
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,236
And don't worry about your job.
It'll always be waiting for you.

981
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,311
Thanks for the beautiful bed jacket.

982
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,232
Hi, Mrs. MacKenzie.
Hi, Allison.

983
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,038
- Hi, Ted.
- We were just leaving.

984
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,794
- Don't let me rush you out.
- We have to go.

985
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,951
Goodbye, Selena. See you soon.

986
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,071
They say it'll bloom for a month.

987
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,835
You can plant it in your yard
as a reminder of your operation.

988
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,558
Here's a book on humor.

989
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,836
Surgery's nothing these days.
You'll be up before you know it.

990
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,915
I went to see Mr. Rossi today,
talked about how to get to college.

991
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,311
He said he might be able to wrangle me
a scholarship.

992
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,758
He talked Mr. Partridge into taking me
into his office as an office boy.

993
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,672
How about that?

994
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,068
That's just fine.

995
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,117
Only thing is, if I work there a year,
it'll be eight years instead of seven...

996
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,840
...before I can pass the bar exam.

997
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,030
Selena, I don't want to
wait that long.

998
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,510
I want to marry you now
and become a lawyer too.

999
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,350
Honey, don't cry.
It's nothing to cry about.

1000
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,950
Please go, Ted. Just go.

1001
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,319
Okay.

1002
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,791
I guess I picked the wrong time.

1003
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,793
I'll come back tomorrow,
when you're feeling better.

1004
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,677
Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie.

1005
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,113
Why, Nellie...

1006
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,715
...you didn't have to come
to work today.

1007
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,030
Work keeps my mind off of things.

1008
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,111
Selena's all right now, isn't she?

1009
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,635
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.

1010
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,312
Everything is just trouble,
Mrs. MacKenzie. Just trouble.

1011
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:30,270
Nellie, don't do any work today.
Just sit around and relax.

1012
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,477
Happy Labor Day, Mother.
Something's wrong.

1013
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,039
She's upset.

1014
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,749
Can't blame her, with Lucas gone
and nobody knows where he is.

1015
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,758
I've gotta run.

1016
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,199
Bye.

1017
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,953
- Hi, Norman.
- Hi.

1018
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,678
- How are you?
- Fine.

1019
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,959
Come on.

1020
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,830
Hello, Mike.
Where'd you come from?

1021
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,911
- Back there.
- Right here.

1022
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,153
Nothing's as dull
as a Labor Day speech.

1023
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,517
I didn't bring you here to explain
how management and labor...

1024
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,240
...must pull together,
not in opposite directions.

1025
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,274
You've got living proof of it
in our prosperity.

1026
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,718
And there's more to come.

1027
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,678
Meet me halfway...

1028
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,189
...and you'll never be unemployed...

1029
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,150
...as long as men and women don't go
back to wearing fig leaves.

1030
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,552
And if they did, I'll bet...

1031
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:35,276
...we'd be in the fig-leaf business sooner
than anybody east of the Alleghenies.

1032
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,319
Now...

1033
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:44,395
...aside from this celebration,
this is a proud moment of my life.

1034
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,115
Tomorrow my son Rodney
leaves for Harvard.

1035
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:00,076
Let's get the fun started and
give him a sendoff! End of speech.

1036
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,192
Just beside myself.

1037
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,870
First Paul goes, and then Lucas.

1038
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,431
I don't know if Selena and me can keep
working and take care of Joey.

1039
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,479
- You'll just have to keep trying.
- I've been trying all my life.

1040
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:37,394
With a husband drunk all the time
and a grown girl...

1041
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:43,192
...dressing and undressing in front of him,
and him staring at her all the time...

1042
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,432
...staring at her and thinking... .
- Oh, Nellie.

1043
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,672
- We all have our problems.
- Staring at her...

1044
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,558
...staring at her.

1045
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,399
...and staring at her.

1046
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,719
Hello.

1047
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,679
Hello.

1048
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,675
What are you doing out here
by yourself?

1049
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,549
I'm not used to being at home
with Nellie.

1050
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:13,235
She has too many problems.
As for the outing, I've seen them all.

1051
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,870
Let's go for a drive, try to find
something interesting to do...

1052
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,918
...far away from Peyton Place.

1053
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,517
Now you're beginning to think
like a true suspicious native. All right.

1054
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,828
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1055
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,837
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1056
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,474
Ready, set, go!

1057
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,110
Hi, Harvard. Going to invite me
to the big game?

1058
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,880
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?

1059
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,395
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.

1060
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,391
You've certainly improved with age.

1061
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,199
Things must've been dull for you
these past months.

1062
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,476
You're right. Come on,
let's take a walk.

1063
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,198
What would your father say?

1064
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,749
Look, Betty, I don't care about that.

1065
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,638
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.

1066
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,473
Let's grab some sandwiches,
I've got a pint...

1067
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,596
...and go down to Crystal Pond.

1068
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,470
Hey, you can think for yourself
once in a while, can't you? Okay.

1069
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,509
Hey, let's go get a hot dog
or something.

1070
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,999
- Okay.
- Good.

1071
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,476
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.

1072
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,959
Okay?

1073
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,277
- See that.
- What?

1074
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,956
Allison and Norman on their way to
Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves.

1075
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,796
So what? They're young, happy, maybe
in love. What trouble can they get into?

1076
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,111
If you don't understand,
I'm not going to explain.

1077
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,432
- More?
- Why not?

1078
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,989
Your father said to give you
a big sendoff.

1079
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,108
Rodney, will I ever see you again?

1080
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,830
Can I compete with those Boston girls?

1081
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,592
What are your qualifications?

1082
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,955
- Can't you guess?
- Seeing is believing.

1083
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,157
I think you're 10 percent man
and 90 percent talk.

1084
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,719
You're 100 percent woman.

1085
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,714
Two hundred and fifty percent woman.
Maybe 500.

1086
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,996
Going to take more than money
to keep me.

1087
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,276
Know what you're doing
to my temperature?

1088
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:32,513
- Let's cool it off and go for a swim.
- But we didn't bring any bathing suits.

1089
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,273
- You all ready, Norman?
- Yeah.

1090
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,152
Forgot my cap.

1091
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,352
What did you say?

1092
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,476
Norman, you're making me
blush all over.

1093
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,279
I'm sorry.

1094
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,311
Let's go in swimming.

1095
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,070
What did you whistle for?

1096
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,277
I saw a fellow and a girl swimming,
without a stitch on.

1097
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,749
- Where?
- They're gone now.

1098
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,480
They got out of the water
and ran into the woods.

1099
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,949
- Naked?
- Naked.

1100
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,595
It was Allison MacKenzie
and Norman Page.

1101
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,676
I didn't really get a good look at them.

1102
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,155
Don't you lie to me, Charles.

1103
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,717
We're gonna pull out of here and
forget we even saw them.

1104
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,994
Betty, do you know
how much I like you?

1105
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,038
I remember, faintly.

1106
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,317
I found out you can't always do
or say what you want to...

1107
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,869
...that is, unless your father lets you.

1108
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,759
Rodney...

1109
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,596
...are you going through all your life
only doing what your father lets you do?

1110
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,797
Only having the friends
that he picks out for you...

1111
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,078
...wearing what he tells you to wear,
thinking his thoughts?

1112
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:26,516
Betty, I'm old enough,
but he's a tough man to handle.

1113
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,990
- You've got to do it someday.
- Yeah, but how?

1114
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,239
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me. It's...

1115
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,909
It's called marriage.

1116
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,671
Wouldn't that just bowl him over?

1117
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,435
I'm sure it would. And me too.

1118
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,119
But...

1119
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,313
...don't think of doing it
just to bowl him over.

1120
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,550
You're the only girl I've ever wanted.

1121
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,199
Rodney... .

1122
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,151
Rodney, not that way.

1123
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,553
What good is life if I know I didn't
have the guts to live it my way?

1124
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,994
Rodney.

1125
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,708
I've really loved you
for such a long time.

1126
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,796
It must take a lot of patience
to make something so beautiful.

1127
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,558
That's what they tell me.

1128
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,315
- All gone.
- Thank you.

1129
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,071
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.

1130
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,596
Saw them with my own eyes.

1131
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,755
Sorry, don't think it'd be ethical
to tell you their names. Goodbye.

1132
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,079
Marion.

1133
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,319
- Thanks for today.
- Anytime.

1134
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,757
How about tomorrow, for instance?

1135
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,360
I can't remember when
I've had so much fun.

1136
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:28,036
I've almost forgotten the silly, wonderful
things there are for two people to do.

1137
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,519
It isn't over yet.

1138
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,473
Mike, please.

1139
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,358
- I don't think we'd better, I mean it!
- Connie, listen...

1140
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,356
All right, let's talk about this.

1141
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,919
I don't want to talk.

1142
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,678
I just want you to leave.

1143
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,270
- Just like that?
- That's right.

1144
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,751
- We're not kids, we're adults.
- And we'll behave like adults.

1145
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,237
I kissed you, you kissed me.
That's affection, not carnality.

1146
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,868
That's not lust, you should
know the difference.

1147
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,952
What do you call a man
who thinks about nothing but...?

1148
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,719
Human.

1149
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,837
All men are alike.

1150
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,550
The approach is different
but the result is always the same.

1151
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,472
Sooner or later, we get to this.

1152
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:53,599
If all I wanted was a woman, I could
get one in a bar, in a hotel lobby...

1153
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,079
Or in my home?

1154
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:58,789
- I'm not gonna let you make this dirty.
- What do you call it?

1155
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,996
I'll tell you a truth about yourself.

1156
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:04,914
It isn't sex you're afraid of. It's love,
that's what you can't handle.

1157
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,594
That's what you offer me,
with your hands on me?

1158
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,274
That's one expression,
backed up by many things.

1159
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,112
I haven't asked for any of them.

1160
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,316
Understand what you're saying no to.

1161
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,917
When I take you in my arms, I commit to
you, not just physically but all the way.

1162
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,516
That means I intend to worry about you,
to take care of you...

1163
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:26,798
...and that's what I want back from you,
without any reservations or shame.

1164
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,430
- Either you're up to that or not.
- I have my standards and pride.

1165
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,036
They're not enough for anyone.
You need someone to trust, to love.

1166
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,998
No, I don't. I don't!
Now, just leave me alone.

1167
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,752
I can but I don't want to.

1168
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,674
Let me help you. I don't care
if you hang back. I'll give it time.

1169
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,876
I can't.

1170
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,078
The offer is always open.

1171
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,715
I don't know if you'll take it up...

1172
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,190
...but perhaps it'll make you feel better
to know it's there.

1173
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,039
Hello.

1174
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,079
Yes, Marion.

1175
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,471
I don't believe it.

1176
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,551
Are you positive?

1177
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,631
No. No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself.

1178
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,679
Operator, will you please
connect me with Evelyn Page?

1179
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,149
I don't believe Norman did
what you said.

1180
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,594
Two people saw them.

1181
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:04,719
- Marion has spread it all over town.
- Don't you say a word against Norman.

1182
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,155
If you'd brought him up
with intelligence...

1183
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,914
He has no interest in girls.
He never had.

1184
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,834
He never learned a thing about sex
in my house. It was never mentioned.

1185
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,471
- Hello, Mrs. Page.
- Come in here.

1186
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,474
- Where's Norman?
- Outside, just going home.

1187
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,111
- Stay right here.
- What's the matter?

1188
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,430
Norman! Come in here.

1189
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,233
What is it, Ma?

1190
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,509
- Where were you today?
- What is it, Mother?

1191
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:37,069
You were seen swimming in the nude
with Norman.

1192
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,914
- That's a lie!
- How could you even think that?

1193
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,036
You were seen clearly by two people.

1194
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,435
We went swimming,
but we had our suits on.

1195
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,598
And by now, everybody in Peyton Place
knows about it.

1196
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,916
If anything is wrong with her...

1197
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,355
We didn't do anything,
did we, Allison?

1198
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,954
- No.
- You better take your boy and go.

1199
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,872
We didn't do anything.

1200
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,237
I've never, never been so humiliated
and disgusted!

1201
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,914
Allison! Come back here
immediately!

1202
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,548
Keep this up and I'll do
what you accuse me of!

1203
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,633
I wouldn't doubt it. You're just like your
father about sex. Just like him!

1204
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,679
Don't say things about my father.
He was wonderful.

1205
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,432
- Wonderful!
- And good to you.

1206
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,956
- You told me that, so don't blame him.
- Wonderful and good.

1207
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,236
That's what I told you? Well, I lied.

1208
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,198
I lied because I was ashamed of him
and of myself.

1209
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,430
- Then why did you marry him?
- I didn't!

1210
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,795
He didn't marry me
because he had a wife.

1211
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,758
- You don't mean that, Mother.
- I do mean it.

1212
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,316
- Don't you understand?
- No.

1213
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,272
He had a wife!

1214
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,799
No!

1215
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:51,193
Nellie!

1216
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,273
Allison.

1217
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:19,596
Connie, everybody reacts differently
to suicide.

1218
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,598
With Allison, severe shock.

1219
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,870
She looks so, so... .

1220
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:28,952
Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape...

1221
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,350
...when the mind can't accept
what it sees.

1222
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,478
A few days' care,
and she'll be out of it.

1223
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,800
I guess I'd better tell Selena.

1224
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,433
And Connie...

1225
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,752
...just because it happened in your house,
don't think any of it was your fault.

1226
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,239
Somehow I do.

1227
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:50,517
You've got just one thing
to think about: Allison.

1228
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,430
If you were gonna get married,
why didn't you tell me?

1229
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,956
- You wouldn't have approved.
- You never gave me a chance.

1230
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:11,908
At least it would've been a proper
marriage, not a cheap weekend affair.

1231
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,548
- Don't say that.
- Well, what was it?

1232
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,396
- I'd like to talk with you alone.
- You can talk to both of us.

1233
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:23,109
This has to do with the business,
not your wife.

1234
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,713
- I'll wait outside.
- Okay, honey.

1235
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,393
I can get it annulled.

1236
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,470
I don't want trouble between us. I was in
love with Betty and wanted to marry her.

1237
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:54,117
You weren't in love. You had an itching
for her. She took you, son. She took you.

1238
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,838
Goodbye, Dad.

1239
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,197
- When you come home, don't bring her.
- Then I won't be there.

1240
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,509
Rodney...

1241
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,279
...what about college?

1242
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,471
I'm not going.
I have to support her.

1243
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:08,599
You can have a job here,
if you work like everyone else.

1244
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,871
That's good enough for me.

1245
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,477
Thanks, Dad.

1246
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:30,434
I knew you weren't coming down
for lunch, so I thought... .

1247
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,996
It's such a beautiful day, darling.

1248
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,958
Why don't you get dressed
and go for a walk?

1249
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,995
You haven't spoken to me
for over a week, since... .

1250
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:52,078
Allison, I understand how you feel.

1251
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:55,113
You'll just have to accept
what's happened...

1252
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,713
...and make the best of it.

1253
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,119
Mother.

1254
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:08,635
As soon as I can,
I'm going to get dressed...

1255
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,439
...pack my things
and leave Peyton Place.

1256
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,273
I never want to see this town
or you again.

1257
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,911
- You can't mean that.
- I mean it. I'm going to New York.

1258
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,879
Please, Allison. I was only trying
to protect you.

1259
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,508
I was an accident you hated
and tried to hide.

1260
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,638
But I loved you from the moment
you were born.

1261
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,150
Try to believe me.

1262
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,318
Well, how will you live?
What'll you do for money?

1263
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,756
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.

1264
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,269
Suppose you can't find a job?

1265
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,834
Then I'll live off some man,
the way you did.

1266
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,599
God.

1267
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,794
God, help me.

1268
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,919
Allison.

1269
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:41,879
Allison.

1270
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,469
Didn't want you to come here.
I couldn't say goodbye to you in person.

1271
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,359
- You know I don't want you to go.
- But I'm going.

1272
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:53,516
You stay here. You belong here,
both of us, together.

1273
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,996
- We've been friends since we were kids.
- Goodbye, Selena.

1274
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,836
Your mother, how can you
leave her alone?

1275
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,434
Mother's always been alone.

1276
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,273
Oh, Selena.

1277
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:37,000
I cried all the way to New York and my
eyes were the color of the oak leaves...

1278
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,994
...that had started to fall back home.

1279
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,635
For days, I struggled to keep alive
and I shivered with loneliness...

1280
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,473
...in a back room
on the fourth floor of nowhere.

1281
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,551
There were times when
I wanted to crawl home...

1282
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,712
...but somehow I managed,
and I stayed.

1283
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:01,996
I learned what I could endure, but none
of us, in New York or in Peyton Place...

1284
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,720
...could guess how much
would be demanded of us...

1285
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,757
...that winter of deep despair.

1286
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,197
I knew families at home would be
getting up on frosty mornings...

1287
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,399
...driving their sons
to a place of hurried goodbye.

1288
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,991
I prayed for them.

1289
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,028
Fellas, get your last cup
of civilian coffee.

1290
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,760
The Army stuff is used
for waterproofing shingles.

1291
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,797
That's what I heard.

1292
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,757
- You hear what Norman Page did?
- Became the first 4F in town.

1293
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,235
No, he enlisted in the paratroopers.

1294
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,038
- Our Norman?
- Norman Page?

1295
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,953
- He volunteered, the paratroopers.
- That's funny.

1296
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,237
- Maybe they'll drop his mother.
- She'd kill 1000 Japanese...

1297
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,960
...before she'd let one touch
her little boy.

1298
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,716
Brought you a doughnut.

1299
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,713
Rodney, I'm gonna cry.

1300
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:16,715
No, you don't. Betty, you don't know
how glad I am that I married you.

1301
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,110
Rodney, I hope so.

1302
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,191
Your father's over there.
Go say goodbye to him.

1303
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:31,434
Go on. Go say goodbye to him.
He loves you as much as I do.

1304
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,352
Go on.

1305
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:51,030
Take care of yourself and
whatever you do, do it honorably.

1306
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:55,159
That's the family motto.
Do me a favor, Dad?

1307
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,078
Certainly, son.

1308
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:01,916
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
She won't ask, but she might need it.

1309
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,599
I'll keep an eye on her.

1310
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,513
Would all the draftees
assemble over here, please.

1311
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:11,718
Come right in, folks.

1312
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,429
Now, as chairman of the draft board,
let me say that all of us regret...

1313
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,319
...having to send any of you men
off to war.

1314
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,919
You carry our love, our devotion
and our undying gratitude.

1315
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:28,117
Please try to come back safely
to your homes.

1316
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,834
Now, we've prepared
some gift packages.

1317
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,709
If you'll just step up here,
I'll hand them out.

1318
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:44,798
Peyton Place draftees in the bus,
on the double. Let's go.

1319
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:48,318
- Best of luck.
- Come on, boys, hurry it up.

1320
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:53,750
Make the goodbyes short.
Name, loud and strong. Last name.

1321
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,160
- Culver, Jones... .
- Harvey.

1322
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,118
Keep going.
You boys are gonna love the Army.

1323
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,793
- Elliot.
- Elliot, right.

1324
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,195
Hurry up in the back. Plenty of seats.

1325
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:10,194
Nothing in the world's gonna stop me
from coming back. I love you, Selena.

1326
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,679
I love you, Ted.

1327
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:15,839
Come on, hurry up. On the double,
let's go, boys!

1328
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:17,832
Got them all.

1329
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,633
Hey, you.

1330
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,678
Snap it up, on the double. Let's go.

1331
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:28,594
You know, you can write to her later
on government stationery.

1332
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,793
That first winter away from home,
I took shape as an individual...

1333
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,757
...and toughened.

1334
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,593
And with spring came the promise that
perhaps I had found my place in life.

1335
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,469
But part of me would keep escaping...

1336
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:13,997
...and I'd find it running, in memory,
back through the fields of Peyton Place...

1337
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:18,355
...or wandering down streets
now empty of young men.

1338
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:23,637
I got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter. He says:

1339
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,157
"The food they serve here must have
been warmed over from World War I. "

1340
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:34,354
Remember Fred Combes? He's in
the Navy. He says, "Dear Hyde:

1341
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:39,992
I joined the Navy because I liked the way
they kept their ships neat and tidy.

1342
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:45,996
But I never knew until now
who kept them that way: Me. "

1343
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,956
The boys are getting around these days.

1344
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,954
I had a V-Mail letter just the other day
from someplace from Norman Page.

1345
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,269
- Remember him?
- Sure.

1346
01:48:55,440 --> 01:49:00,719
He said he dug a foxhole so deep that
it was just short of desertion.

1347
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:06,877
And then the seasons spun by so fast
they seemed to become one.

1348
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:12,274
The war news was too big to grasp,
and too unhappy to understand.

1349
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:17,789
Selena wrote me often about
Peyton Place, and I treasured her letters.

1350
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,118
She always tried to mention
my mother...

1351
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,232
...and tell me what people
were saying to each other...

1352
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,879
...or were not saying.

1353
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,552
Eventually, I broke the ice
of my intentions...

1354
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,029
...and subscribed to
the Peyton Place Times.

1355
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,953
I was hungry for names that meant
something to me.

1356
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:48,069
But among them, unhappily, came the
names of those who were gone forever.

1357
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,119
Betty... .

1358
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:39,153
- Rodney asked me to take care of you.
- I don't need your help.

1359
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,276
But I need yours.

1360
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,239
Rodney was a better boy
for having married you.

1361
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:48,437
When I was 6 years old,
I was in love with Rodney.

1362
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:52,115
For years afterwards, I never even
thought about anybody else.

1363
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,189
I was a kind of flashy girl, I know,
but Rodney liked flashy girls...

1364
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,555
...so that's the way I was gonna be.

1365
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,998
The funny thing is, Rodney always
loved me as much as I loved him.

1366
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:06,038
But you taught him appearances
count more than feelings!

1367
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,952
I was wrong.

1368
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,711
Rodney discovered it.

1369
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,033
Let's... .

1370
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,390
Let's keep what's left
of the family together.

1371
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,473
A little brighter one, please.

1372
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,710
- Did you hear about Mr. Rossi?
- No, what?

1373
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,472
- He's leaving town.
- Leaving?

1374
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:35,952
Not really. They're trying to get him to be
principal of a high school in Portland.

1375
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:39,396
- You sure?
- I'm sure. I got it firsthand.

1376
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:40,788
From Mr. Rossi?

1377
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:44,476
From Kathy, who got it from Betty,
who got it from Ms. Thornton.

1378
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:48,155
- I suppose that's firsthand.
- We won't be able to keep him here.

1379
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,835
- This is kind of nice. Can I try it on?
- Sure, come on.

1380
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,072
Merry Christmas.

1381
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,679
Come in.

1382
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,473
Merry Christmas.

1383
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,631
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.

1384
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,315
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.

1385
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,994
Come in. Let me take your coat.

1386
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:32,631
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.

1387
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,951
- Can I fix you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1388
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,230
Well, come in, sit down.

1389
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,272
Well, I really came to... .

1390
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,908
Is it true that you
might go to Portland?

1391
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,752
Well, I've received the offer.

1392
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,037
It's a larger school, and
naturally, much more money.

1393
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,838
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.

1394
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,072
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.

1395
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:59,871
- Michael?
- Yes?

1396
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,918
You were right.
I never thought I could say it...

1397
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,150
...but you were right.
- About what?

1398
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:09,552
During the past months, I've been able to
come to a few conclusions about myself.

1399
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,508
- And what were they?
- Well, Michael, I've lied so long.

1400
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:17,912
I was everything you said,
especially that night in the kitchen.

1401
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,991
I wanted you more
than you wanted me.

1402
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,755
- I had no right to say those things.
- Yes, you did.

1403
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,276
- I came to tell you the truth.
- You don't owe me an explanation.

1404
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:30,318
Allison didn't leave home because
of Nellie's suicide...

1405
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,232
...but because she hated me.

1406
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,075
- She won't answer my letters or calls.
- Why not?

1407
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:39,550
The night you walked out,
Marion Partridge called me.

1408
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,392
She told me Allison and Norman...

1409
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:44,597
I heard about that woman
and her phone calls.

1410
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:47,753
Well, I've always been
so afraid of scandal.

1411
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,833
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.

1412
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:56,717
Without thinking, when Allison returned,
I told her some terrible things.

1413
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,518
What things?

1414
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,110
Come on, Connie, what things?

1415
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:07,669
I'm Allison's mother,
but I've never been married.

1416
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,918
Not to Angus MacKenzie,
not to anyone.

1417
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:15,079
I went to New York
and lived with a married man.

1418
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,035
After he died, I came back here
and lied...

1419
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,069
...and I've been lying ever since.

1420
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:38,395
You want the truth...

1421
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,109
...and when you get it,
you're just like everybody else.

1422
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,989
- They want anything but the truth.
- Connie. Connie!

1423
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,113
I told you once that
the offer was always open.

1424
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,794
That I'm committing myself
to you all the way...

1425
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:59,717
...and that I plan to worry about you,
and take care of you. I meant that.

1426
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,558
Oh, Michael.

1427
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,596
- How's that?
- Fine.

1428
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,352
I'll get it.

1429
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,870
- Merry Chris...
- Ain't you gonna invite me in?

1430
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,799
That's not a very friendly greeting
after I broke my back getting here.

1431
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:27,951
Hi, Joey.

1432
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,430
Say, there's a blizzard
blowing up, big one.

1433
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,868
Got a drink? I'm froze.

1434
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:35,271
You're nowhere near froze,
with all you've got in you already.

1435
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,000
I see the Navy hasn't cured you
of drinking.

1436
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:42,711
Cure me! Honey, the Navy's taught me
tricks you never heared of.

1437
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:48,633
Sure made a lot of changes
around here, ain't you?

1438
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,476
You bet we have, Lucas. And for a start,
you can pick up your things and go.

1439
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:59,237
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what
I can't do in my own house.

1440
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:02,073
- This isn't your house anymore.
- I don't care.

1441
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,629
This is still my place,
and don't forget it.

1442
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,070
Did you just come back here
to make trouble?

1443
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:11,034
- You heard about Ma, didn't you?
- Yep, heard about her.

1444
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:18,111
Hey, Joey, here's a quarter. Run along
now, huh? Come on, pick it up.

1445
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:21,592
- Pick it up, Joey.
- Lucas, you leave him alone.

1446
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,432
Oh, honey... .

1447
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,750
No, don't start a fight.

1448
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,276
Me and you got to know each other
a little too well for that.

1449
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:33,592
Say, I didn't think you could improve,
but you sure have.

1450
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:47,955
It ain't like I was your real pa,
you know.

1451
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:58,433
- You dirty, filthy animal!
- You're still a little wildcat, ain't you!

1452
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,158
As we worship together
this Easter morning...

1453
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,676
...and more, as we pray to him
who died and rose again...

1454
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:29,357
...that we might have life
and have it more abundantly...

1455
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:34,356
...let us remember especially those who
have gone from this country and town...

1456
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:39,870
...to live and die in far-off places
for a like purpose.

1457
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:45,189
May they know his mercy,
his comfort and his peace.

1458
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:50,555
May we uphold them with our prayers,
encourage them with our letters...

1459
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:55,316
...honor them with our love.
And may our lives, not less than theirs...

1460
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,710
...be dedicated to that same Lord...

1461
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:01,236
...who alone can give to life
a perfect freedom...

1462
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:03,755
...and a final peace.

1463
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,712
Let us pray.

1464
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:09,313
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1465
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:13,155
...hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come...

1466
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:17,154
...thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1467
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,433
Gives us this day,
our daily bread...

1468
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:24,718
...and forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors...

1469
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:29,317
...and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

1470
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:33,678
...for thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory...

1471
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,308
...forever. Amen.

1472
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,238
Thank you. Come again.

1473
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,755
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Cross.

1474
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,239
Selena.

1475
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,437
Miss Cross, you have a father
in the Navy. Lucas Augustus Cross?

1476
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:58,953
My stepfather.

1477
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,832
Have you seen him lately?

1478
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,152
Not for a year and a half.

1479
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,719
What's wrong?

1480
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:08,874
He went on leave and didn't come back.
He's listed as a deserter.

1481
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,600
Miss Cross, you're sure
you haven't seen him?

1482
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:14,554
I didn't even know
that he was in the Navy.

1483
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,878
- He hasn't called or written you?
- No.

1484
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:23,194
He disappeared from town a year
and a half ago, deserting his family.

1485
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,316
Looks like he's running true to form.

1486
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,798
If you do hear from him, get in touch
with the First District Shore Patrol.

1487
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:31,632
I will.

1488
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:44,479
Selena, don't get upset.
It's not your fault they can't find him.

1489
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,631
What is it? What's wrong, Selena?

1490
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:56,751
Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone.
I can't keep it to myself any longer!

1491
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:59,912
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?

1492
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,469
Lucas didn't desert.

1493
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,873
How do you know?

1494
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:09,875
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!

1495
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:16,115
- I don't believe it.
- I did. I buried him in the sheep pen!

1496
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:25,670
Selena, you've gotta call
the state police.

1497
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:29,115
No. No, I can't!

1498
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:31,993
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!

1499
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,831
Please don't make me!

1500
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,548
Listen to me, Selena. Listen.

1501
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:41,190
- One of us has got to call.
- I can't!

1502
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:45,670
- No.
- You must call them now.

1503
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,196
I can't.

1504
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,394
- Pardon me.
- Allison!

1505
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:26,273
Norman.

1506
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,877
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.

1507
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,750
Come here. Hey, you guys.
You know... .

1508
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,038
- You look older. More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.

1509
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,838
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.

1510
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,434
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.

1511
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,238
I remember you liked to write.

1512
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,470
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?

1513
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:49,518
No, I got a job working
for a book publisher.

1514
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:52,877
He didn't publish those books
with the plain wrappers, did he?

1515
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,029
- Remember?
- No.

1516
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,077
- Yes, you do. Remember?
- Yes.

1517
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:59,710
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.

1518
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:05,754
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really. You look great.

1519
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,319
Thanks.

1520
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:11,871
You know, you never said goodbye
to me when you left Peyton Place.

1521
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,912
You never even said goodbye.

1522
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:16,469
I'll never forget
that Labor Day, Norman.

1523
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,517
I won't either.

1524
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,838
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.

1525
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,672
What brings you home? Vacation?

1526
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,798
- Haven't you heard about Selena Cross?
- No, why?

1527
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,829
She killed her stepfather, Lucas.
Her trial starts in two days, for murder.

1528
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:36,639
Lucas was always a bad joe, but she
seemed to be able to put up with him.

1529
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,473
Who ever knows what
anyone's able to put up with?

1530
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,439
Well, that's true.

1531
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:45,593
Sure took me a long time to know about
myself and understand Peyton Place.

1532
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:48,954
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

1533
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:53,555
I'm gonna go back and try
and work things out with my mother.

1534
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:56,953
Maybe we'll both be happier.

1535
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:02,312
If not, well, at least
I've made the effort, you know?

1536
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:10,393
I always wondered why you enlisted.
In the paratroopers, I mean.

1537
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:14,198
I guess I wanted to get knocked off
or something.

1538
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:16,590
But as soon as I got away
from my mother...

1539
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:21,834
...I realized how wonderful life really was.
Then I fought like a tiger to stay alive.

1540
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:27,957
I was running away from my problems.
You know what I mean.

1541
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:29,838
Yeah, I know.

1542
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,028
Something's bothering you, isn't it?

1543
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:35,873
Yeah.

1544
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:38,638
Can I help?

1545
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,076
No, you can't.

1546
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,196
- Okay.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

1547
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:45,312
All right.

1548
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:50,071
Hey, have you had dinner?
Would you like dinner, with me?

1549
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,468
- Okay.
- Okay?

1550
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,312
All right.

1551
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:43,950
- Doc Swain.
- Hi. Evening, Selena. Be right with you.

1552
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:49,788
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.

1553
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,472
Watch your feet.

1554
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,635
Are you gonna tell them about me?

1555
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:02,917
- I'll have to, Selena.
- Nobody in town must ever know.

1556
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:06,351
- But if I don't, you'll be risking your life.
- I know that.

1557
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,391
- Well, then why?
- Because of Ted.

1558
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:11,552
What are you afraid of, what he'll think?
He loves you.

1559
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:14,957
It would ruin his life,
married to a girl who... .

1560
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:18,033
Not a respectable person in town
would accept him.

1561
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:22,478
"Respectable. " What kind of
respectability are you talking about?

1562
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:25,393
The people with enough money
to hire him as a lawyer.

1563
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:28,950
Look, don't you understand?
We're talking about your whole life.

1564
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,998
Prison can be a kind of dying.

1565
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:35,197
Losing Ted would be
a worse kind of dying.

1566
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,428
- Besides, you mustn't get involved.
- Never mind about me.

1567
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:44,912
Promise me you won't tell them.
Promise me, please promise!

1568
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,434
All right, Selena. I'll promise you.

1569
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:54,635
You don't seem to realize you face
a possible life sentence.

1570
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:58,475
- I need more to work with, much more.
- There is no more.

1571
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:02,189
Lucas was drunk and brutal.
When he tried to beat me, I killed him.

1572
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:07,354
Killing in self-defense is understandable.
But you hid the body, like a criminal.

1573
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:09,875
- I know.
- She was fighting for her life.

1574
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:13,635
The state is sending a prosecutor
for one purpose: to convict Selena.

1575
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:18,191
I've seen him work. He's thoroughly
competent and relentless as law itself.

1576
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:21,996
Tell her to come in. There must be
something you haven't told me.

1577
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:25,835
- He tried to kill me, I killed him first.
- But you hid the body! Why?

1578
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,479
Come in, Allison.

1579
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:30,077
Allison.

1580
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:32,549
I was never happier to see
anyone in my life.

1581
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,278
Are you all right?

1582
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,313
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Allison.

1583
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:40,717
I can testify about Lucas.
I saw him beat her.

1584
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,279
It'll help, believe me.

1585
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:45,750
- We appreciate you coming back.
- You'll get her off, won't you?

1586
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,911
We're gonna do the best we can.

1587
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:51,868
But the jury decides
on the one thing: evidence.

1588
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:53,837
Now, it adds up to this:

1589
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,788
We have a murder, and a defense
that's too simple to be good.

1590
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:00,599
It's open to attack from many sides.

1591
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:04,357
Selena, have you told me
the whole story?

1592
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,238
I'm sorry.

1593
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,196
There's no more to tell.

1594
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:16,273
Hello, Allison.

1595
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:21,599
- You look well.
- With a drink in my hand?

1596
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:24,156
Would you care for something?

1597
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:37,318
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.

1598
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,958
You haven't learned, have you?

1599
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:44,156
Yes, I have, Mother.

1600
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:47,597
I've learned to smoke and drink
and go to bed when I want to.

1601
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,116
And kiss boys whenever
the impulse sweeps over me.

1602
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:56,435
Allison, we all make mistakes,
but if we face them, truthfully...

1603
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,272
...they can be overcome.

1604
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:02,319
Can we overcome the fact of my birth,
that I'm illegitimate?

1605
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,313
I think so. With love.

1606
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:08,153
Thank you, and goodbye, Mother.

1607
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:12,838
As soon as this trial is over, I'm taking
the first train out of this town.

1608
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,670
Goodbye, Mother.

1609
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,675
Court will come to order.
Everybody rise.

1610
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,075
Be seated, please.

1611
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:19,430
The recess in the trial of
The State v. Selena Cross is over.

1612
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,875
Gentlemen, you may proceed.

1613
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,919
Prosecution wishes to recall
Joseph Cross to the stand.

1614
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:40,075
- Joey...
- I told you my name was Joseph.

1615
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,953
Joseph.

1616
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:48,194
This morning, before recess, we were
talking about lying and telling the truth.

1617
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:51,480
Joseph, have you ever told a lie?

1618
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,790
- Yes, sir.
- Big ones, or little ones?

1619
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:56,838
Some little ones,
and some medium ones.

1620
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:59,960
Would you lie to save your sister
from prison?

1621
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:01,951
- Yes, sir.
- A big lie?

1622
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:04,156
The biggest lie you ever heard.

1623
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,834
- I object!
- Sustained.

1624
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,232
Joseph, we heard your testimony
this morning. Was it true?

1625
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,753
It was all true.

1626
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:18,074
Do you claim your sister killed your
stepfather because he grabbed her?

1627
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,754
He was a strong man,
and we were both afraid.

1628
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:23,798
If Lucas was as strong as you
and everybody else said...

1629
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:26,474
...how could your sister
possibly overpower him?

1630
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:29,518
She was madder than he was,
and scareder.

1631
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:33,355
Lucas was 195 pounds...

1632
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,273
...your sister, 110.

1633
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:39,159
Did she sneak up behind him
and hit him...

1634
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:41,629
...with that firewood
when he wasn't looking?

1635
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,472
No, sir.

1636
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:47,993
- Were you watching every second?
- I might've looked away once or twice.

1637
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:51,233
Did you see Selena hit him
the first blow?

1638
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,796
- I don't know.
- Is there any doubt...

1639
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,030
...as to how that first blow
was struck?

1640
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:59,593
I don't know. It all happened so fast.

1641
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:01,514
Joseph...

1642
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:06,515
...you said that you told your sister
to bury your stepfather.

1643
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,831
- That's right. She didn't want to.
- I see.

1644
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:14,716
How old were you when you told her,
when she did what you wanted?

1645
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:17,359
About 8.

1646
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:19,317
In other words...

1647
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:23,598
...a 19-year-old girl didn't know
what to do with the body...

1648
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:27,230
...until an 8-year-old boy told her.

1649
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:28,998
Yes, sir.

1650
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,470
I have no further questions.

1651
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:36,155
- No questions.
- You may step down, Joseph.

1652
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:40,310
I wish to recall Selena Cross
to the stand.

1653
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:00,678
Miss Cross, yesterday
you told the jury...

1654
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:03,559
...that your stepfather
disappeared from home...

1655
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:06,757
...a year and a half
before you killed him.

1656
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,513
Do you have any idea why he left?

1657
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:16,675
I'm not sure. I'd only be guessing.

1658
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,838
You hesitated. Why?

1659
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,438
I don't know.

1660
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:26,038
Do you know what he did
during that year and a half?

1661
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,236
He was in the Navy, he said.

1662
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,789
Do you imply that he came home
from the war...

1663
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:33,520
...from combat duty,
just to beat you up?

1664
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:37,269
We object, Your Honor. The defendant
has implied no such thing.

1665
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,429
Sustained.

1666
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:44,273
Did your stepfather
own the house you live in?

1667
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:48,956
- Well, my brother and l, we fixed it up.
- Answer the question, please.

1668
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,396
- It wasn't a house when he left...
- Please answer the question.

1669
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,597
Yes, but it was a dirty shack
and nothing else!

1670
02:13:55,760 --> 02:14:01,153
But you had the freedom to come
and go and invite boys in...

1671
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:05,115
...and answer to no one
while Lucas was gone, didn't you?

1672
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:06,629
Didn't you?

1673
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:09,030
Yes, I had the freedom, but I never did!

1674
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,351
When you thought he was gonna
change that, did you kill him?

1675
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:16,149
No! Lucas was drunk
and tried to beat me!

1676
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:20,196
The coroner testified
that he was unconscious...

1677
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:24,558
...from the first blow, so you were safe
from any beating, but you didn't stop.

1678
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:26,551
- Why?
- I don't know.

1679
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:30,349
You kept on hitting him until
you crushed the life out of him. Why?

1680
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:34,559
I don't know. I couldn't stop!
I couldn't stop!

1681
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:41,231
When you finally did kill him,
why didn't you call the police?

1682
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,517
I wanted to. I was afraid.

1683
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:49,310
But you hadn't committed any crime,
defending yourself.

1684
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:51,869
What was there to fear
from the police?

1685
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:54,474
I don't know. I was just afraid.

1686
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:59,874
You had nothing to fear until you
hid Lucas' body, isn't that right?

1687
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:03,191
Then you had a great deal
to fear, didn't you?

1688
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,237
- That's right.
- But you buried him.

1689
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:08,278
You must have had a reason.
A powerful reason.

1690
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:10,749
Don't tell me it was
because you were afraid.

1691
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,035
- I was!
- Are you sure?

1692
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:14,794
- That's the only reason!
- Fear is panic...

1693
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:17,599
...and cleverly burying a man
you just murdered...

1694
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,671
...requires cold thought.
- Objection!

1695
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:22,513
- You knew what you were doing.
- I didn't! I didn't!

1696
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:26,958
- Prosecution is harassing the witness.
- Objection sustained.

1697
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:29,391
I withdraw the question.

1698
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:31,391
I have nothing further.

1699
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:34,353
Miss Cross, at all times
during the quarrel...

1700
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,795
...which led to the death
of Lucas Cross...

1701
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,952
...were you in fear of bodily harm?

1702
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:41,917
Yes, I was.

1703
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,833
I have no further questions.
You may step down.

1704
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:49,675
I wish to call Miss Allison MacKenzie
to the stand.

1705
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:06,312
Raise your hand. Do you swear to tell
the truth, whole truth, so help you God?

1706
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:08,038
- Yes.
- Be seated.

1707
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:11,152
- State your name, please.
- Allison MacKenzie.

1708
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:15,199
Miss MacKenzie, how long have
you known Selena Cross?

1709
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,998
Ever since I was a child.

1710
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:21,472
We went all through school together.
Miss Cross is my best friend.

1711
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:26,676
You have testified that when you saw
Lucas beating Selena...

1712
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:29,718
...you thought your presence
prevented it from going on.

1713
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:33,236
- I know it did.
- No, you don't know, you assume.

1714
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:36,034
He was embarrassed
to find me watching.

1715
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:38,874
How many times did Lucas hit Selena?

1716
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,076
- Once.
- Once?

1717
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:44,391
Did he hit her with his fist
or a weapon?

1718
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:45,879
It was kind of a slap.

1719
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:47,838
Oh, a slap.

1720
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,790
Have you ever been slapped,
Miss MacKenzie?

1721
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,396
- Yes.
- By a stranger?

1722
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:56,755
- No.
- By a member of the family?

1723
02:16:56,960 --> 02:17:00,509
- Do I have to answer these questions?
- I'm sorry, but you do.

1724
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:04,234
By my mother.

1725
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:07,915
As hard a blow as Selena Cross'
stepfather gave her?

1726
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:09,479
- No.
- How could you tell?

1727
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:11,870
- I don't think so.
- You don't really know...

1728
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,600
...what happened in that house.
- Yes, I do know.

1729
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,876
First you talk about a beating...

1730
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:20,635
...and then we find out all you're
discussing is a single blow.

1731
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,117
Would you say the arguments
in the Cross household...

1732
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:26,999
...were more or less violent
than any other family's?

1733
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:29,799
- Objection.
- What's the purpose of that question?

1734
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:35,268
The witness must define her terms,
if the jury is to clearly understand her.

1735
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:37,318
A beating becomes one blow.

1736
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:41,559
A blow becomes a slap. Perhaps the slap
will become something else.

1737
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:43,871
Objection overruled.

1738
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,559
No further questions.

1739
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:50,839
No questions, Your Honor.

1740
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,237
You may step down.

1741
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:00,432
The prosecution calls
Mrs. Constance MacKenzie to the stand.

1742
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:18,313
Raise your hand. Do you swear to tell
the truth, whole truth, so help you God?

1743
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:19,833
- I do.
- Be seated.

1744
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,032
State your name, please.

1745
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:23,913
Constance MacKenzie.

1746
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:31,155
Mrs. MacKenzie, I understand you've
known the defendant a long time.

1747
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:33,709
Yes, since she was a baby.

1748
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:38,910
Did Selena ever complain that her
stepfather had beaten her at any time?

1749
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:41,713
What?

1750
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:44,553
- Did Selena ever complain...?
- No.

1751
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:47,678
Did you ever see any marks on her?
Injuries?

1752
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,159
No.

1753
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:52,552
You knew the defendant's mother well,
did you not?

1754
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,115
Nellie worked for me as a housemaid.

1755
02:18:55,280 --> 02:19:01,310
Did she ever mention Lucas' brutality,
or describe any beating he administered?

1756
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:07,830
No, she said he was drunk and lazy,
and he deserted her...

1757
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:12,835
...and she committed suicide over the
kind of life that Lucas brought them to.

1758
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,475
We're not concerned
with Mrs. Cross' suicide.

1759
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:16,755
I don't see why not.

1760
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:20,316
There was something terribly wrong
in the Cross family life.

1761
02:19:20,480 --> 02:19:24,553
Something wrong when a woman had to
raise her daughter up almost alone...

1762
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:26,995
...and trying to help her...

1763
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:35,472
- Mrs. MacKenzie.
...and not being able to help...

1764
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:37,916
...and not being able to give.

1765
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:40,038
Mrs. MacKenzie.

1766
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:45,035
I'm aware of your concern over the
suicide, but that is not the point at issue.

1767
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:48,755
Did your daughter ever tell you
she'd seen Lucas beat Selena?

1768
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:50,239
No.

1769
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:53,278
Don't you think if she had seen
such an incident...

1770
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:56,000
...she would have mentioned it to you?

1771
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,754
- I don't know.
- Well, wouldn't she?

1772
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,918
Well... .

1773
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:05,518
Mrs. MacKenzie, doesn't your daughter
ever bring home her problems?

1774
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:09,072
How many times do I have to answer
your questions?

1775
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:11,515
Until we find out the truth.

1776
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:16,192
The truth is...

1777
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:19,792
...my daughter did bring
her troubles home...

1778
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:23,431
...and I wouldn't understand.

1779
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,549
- Well, if she brings her problems home...
- I wouldn't understand!

1780
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:35,032
The court will adjourn
for a short recess.

1781
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:43,958
Come in.

1782
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,919
What have I done to Selena?

1783
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,479
You had no choice.

1784
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:53,631
But I did have a choice.

1785
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:57,998
Maybe the wrong one,
but I'll never forgive myself if... .

1786
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:03,393
You blame yourself too much, Connie.
You did what you morally had to do.

1787
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:09,154
Here.

1788
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:25,318
- Charlie, can I speak with you?
- Sure.

1789
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:40,996
Court will come to order.
Remain seated, please.

1790
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,876
Has the prosecution completed
its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?

1791
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,315
It has. The prosecution rests.

1792
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,909
No more questions.
You may step down.

1793
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:03,954
We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the
stand, as a witness for the defense.

1794
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:15,837
Do you swear to tell the truth,
whole truth, so help you God?

1795
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:17,479
- I do.
- Be seated.

1796
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:20,035
- State your name.
- Dr. Matthew Swain.

1797
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:23,317
Do you know of any act of force
or violence...

1798
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:25,710
...Lucas perpetrated
against the defendant?

1799
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:27,757
I certainly do.

1800
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:33,788
We've wasted time torturing a girl who's
emotionally unable to speak for herself.

1801
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:38,119
Lucas Cross was a drunkard
and a wife beater and a child abuser.

1802
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:39,879
I object.

1803
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:42,759
"Child abuser" is an exaggerated,
inflammatory word.

1804
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:45,480
I mean "child abuser"
in the worst way possible!

1805
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:47,915
I object. The deceased is not on trial.

1806
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:52,278
Lucas Cross' character, as to force
and violence, is on trial here.

1807
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,989
You may continue, Dr. Swain.

1808
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,719
The night that Lucas Cross
left town...

1809
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:02,634
...I performed what I recorded
as an appendectomy on Selena Cross.

1810
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,358
It was not an appendectomy.

1811
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:09,111
I falsified my records.
I assisted her in a miscarriage.

1812
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:12,034
A miscarriage of Lucas Cross' baby.

1813
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:16,632
I said it was Lucas Cross' baby
that Selena carried.

1814
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:21,430
- I object to this statement as evidence.
- On what grounds?

1815
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,795
It's the conclusion of the witness.

1816
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:26,838
- Except that it's true.
- Can you testify to this?

1817
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,319
I can.

1818
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:30,994
Objection overruled. Continue.

1819
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:36,792
I have here a complete admission
of guilt, signed by Lucas Cross.

1820
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:42,397
Will the attorneys please
approach the bench?

1821
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:50,270
I offer Lucas Cross' confession
into evidence, Your Honor.

1822
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:51,873
I object, Your Honor.

1823
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:56,517
The confession of a person not a party
to the case is totally inadmissible.

1824
02:23:56,840 --> 02:24:01,595
The prosecution may have a sound point,
but I'll reserve my ruling until...

1825
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:06,754
...I've heard his testimony. If I find it
inadmissible, I'll order it stricken.

1826
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,872
His entire testimony stricken
from the record?

1827
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:12,838
I will rule on that when I've heard it.

1828
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:19,397
You will complete your statement,
Dr. Swain.

1829
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:24,549
I'm sure that the prosecutor will see that
the state investigates my records...

1830
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:28,190
...and perhaps I could lose the privilege
to practice medicine...

1831
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:30,794
...but it's time that someone
spoke up...

1832
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,719
...and paid the price
for the privilege of speaking.

1833
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:36,633
Selena killed Lucas out of fear.

1834
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:41,231
Fear of being forced to submit to him
again, and then she hid her crime...

1835
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:45,752
...for fear of how we'd react to her
being assaulted by her stepfather.

1836
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:50,272
She couldn't trust us with the truth.
Selena had no one to go to but me.

1837
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:53,597
She only came to me because she had
to for medical reasons.

1838
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,352
She swore me to secrecy.

1839
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:58,791
Now I'm violating that secrecy
for a bigger purpose.

1840
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:03,753
We're all prisoners of each other's
gossip, killed by each other's whispers...

1841
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:05,512
...and it's time it stopped.

1842
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:09,673
Our best young people leave as soon
as they can earn a bus ticket.

1843
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:12,952
They contribute their characters
to other communities...

1844
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,350
...because they're stifled
in Peyton Place.

1845
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,238
We're not interested...

1846
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:21,951
Dr. Swain has come forth at considerable
risk to himself and I intend to hear him...

1847
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:23,712
...without any interruption.

1848
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:26,917
I will rule on your objection
when he's finished.

1849
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:29,277
You will continue, Dr. Swain.

1850
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:34,878
We're a small but prosperous town,
yet we allow tarpaper shacks to stand.

1851
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:38,357
We have half a dozen churches
which most of you attend...

1852
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:43,031
...and then don't practice the word they
preach once you walk down the steps.

1853
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:46,437
We have a fine school
that you take for granted.

1854
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:49,797
We have a newspaper with a most
intelligent editorial page...

1855
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:52,554
...which you use
for wrapping garbage.

1856
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:55,348
It's time you people woke up.

1857
02:25:55,640 --> 02:25:58,677
Perhaps today you will,
because there's something bigger...

1858
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:01,434
...than the tragedy of Selena Cross
on trial here.

1859
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:05,599
Our indifference, our failure as a
community to watch over one another...

1860
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:08,638
...to know who needs help
and to give it.

1861
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:11,997
Selena's been living in a prison
of her own long enough...

1862
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,639
...one that we helped build.

1863
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,911
I have nothing more to say.

1864
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:24,756
The objection of the prosecution
is not sustained.

1865
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:28,192
The jury may consider this statement
as evidence.

1866
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:43,716
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1867
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,878
We have, Your Honor.

1868
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:48,349
The foreman will read the verdict.

1869
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:51,956
We find the defendant not guilty.

1870
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:02,151
Court is adjourned.

1871
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:41,397
Come on, Joey,
you come home with me.

1872
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:48,792
Selena, would you like to go now?

1873
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,990
Good going, doc!

1874
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:38,188
Selena, we're so very happy for you.

1875
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:23,599
Mother... .

1876
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,191
Come on, Norman.

1877
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:08,350
We'd finally discovered
that season of love.

1878
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:11,752
It is only found
in someone else's heart.

1879
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:17,275
Right now, someone you know
is looking everywhere for it...

1880
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:19,590
...and it's in you.

1881
