1
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,267
This is a true story.

2
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,480
How often have you seen that statement
at the beginning of a picture?

3
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,150
It sometimes means that there
was a man named Napoleon...

4
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,862
but that any similarity
between what he did in life...

5
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,866
and what he's going to do in this
movie is strictly miraculous.

6
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,661
Well, this is a true story...

7
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,832
about a sweet, rather baffled
young housewife...

8
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,878
who, in 1951,
in her hometown in Georgia...

9
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:14,091
suddenly frightened her husband
by behaving very unlike herself.

10
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,135
Well, there's nothing
unique in that.

11
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,680
We all have moods.
We all have a secret yen...

12
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:24,268
to behave like somebody
we particularly admire.

13
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,604
In fact, a modern writer has said...

14
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,607
that inside every fat man...

15
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,068
a thin man is struggling
to get out.

16
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,489
Well, in a literal and
terrifying sense...

17
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,492
inside this demure young woman...

18
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,286
two very vivid and
different personalities...

19
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:46,833
were battling
for the mastery of her character.

20
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,379
She was, in fact, a case of
what is called multiple personality...

21
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,924
something that all psychiatrists
have read about...

22
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,468
and very few have ever seen...

23
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,222
certainly not Dr. Thigpen
and Dr. Cleckley...

24
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,683
of the Medical College of Georgia...

25
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,893
who one day
were confronted with a woman...

26
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:10,439
who had one personality
more than Dr. Jekyll.

27
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,525
Now, their account of the case
was delivered...

28
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,112
to the American Psychiatric
Association in 1953...

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:21,200
and it's already a classic
of psychiatric literature.

30
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:24,036
So this movie needed no help...

31
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,706
from the imagination
of a fiction writer.

32
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,251
The truth itself was
fabulous enough...

33
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,837
and all the episodes
you're going to see...

34
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,758
happened to this girl
whom they call Eve White...

35
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,679
and much of the dialogue is
taken from the clinical record...

36
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,141
of the doctor that we
call Dr. Luther.

37
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,025
<i>The date is August 20, 1951.</i>

42
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,570

Dr. Watkins wrote you about.

43
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,531
-  Ask her to come in, will you?
-  Yes, Doctor.

44
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,951
Will you come in, please?

45
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,459
-  How do you do, Mrs. White?
-  How do you do?

46
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,629
-  Come in. Sit here, will you?
-  Thank you.

Thank you.

50
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:11,143
Dr. Watkins is a very old friend of mine.
How long have you known him?

51
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,896
He's the doctor we go to.

52
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,441
He's a very able man, very able.

53
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,989
Let's see. He says you've been
troubled with very bad headaches.

54
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,783
Yes, sir. Terrible ones.

55
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,744
-  And some sort of spells?
-  Yes, sir.

56
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,331
What kind of spell?

57
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,251
Why, I don't know.
I'm not exactly sure.

58
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,463
Well, what happens when
you have one?

59
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,384
Is it what they say, amnesia?

60
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,679
Well, amnesia means "loss of memory."
Is that what happens to you?

61
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,517
Yes, I guess that's it.

62
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,604
-  How often does this happen?
-  Sometimes twice a week now.

63
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,734
-  And the headaches, what about them?
-  Same thing.

64
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,445
-  They happen at the same time?
-  Yes, sir.

65
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,573
First I get this terrible headache...

66
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,159
and then I get this spell.

67
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,538
Now, when you say spell, do you mean
you faint or anything like that?

68
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,540
No, sir. It's not like faintin'.

69
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,876
It's more like...

70
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,463
Well, it's like the other day.

71
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,216
I was playin' out in the backyard
with Bonnie...

72
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,219
and all of a sudden
I got this splittin' headache...

73
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,847
and then the next thing I knew...

74
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,893
I mean, the next thing I was
conscious of, it was the next mornin'.

75
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,396
-  Who's Bonnie?
-  That's my little girl.

76
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,066
-  How old is she?
-  She's four and a half.

77
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,902
-  Your only child?
-  Yes, sir.

78
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,196
I lost another baby
about four months ago.

79
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,531
I see.

80
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:53,537
And you have no recollection at all
of what happened...

81
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,831
where you were
or what you did between the time...

82
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,001
you were playing in the backyard
with Bonnie and the next morning?

83
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,589
No, sir, I don't.

84
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,135
Were you at home at the time?

85
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,471
I was there as soon as
I come home from work.

86
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,972
Yes?

87
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,228
I didn't see much different in her.

88
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,023
Well, did you see any difference?

89
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,026

was really different.

00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,778
I got you. It's all right, baby.

170
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,614
It's all right, honey.
It's all right.

171
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,621
<i>You'll be all right.
It's all right.</i>

172
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,334
It's all right, honey.

173
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,381
Don't get up.

174
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,595
I'll kill you, you get up.

175
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,987
<i>- I didn't do it.
- But I saw her.</i>

176
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,114
I didn't do it, I tell you.

177
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,867
How can she say a thing like that
when I saw her with my own eyes?

178
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,411
If I hadn't been there,
I don't know what she'd have done.

179
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,039
- You mean you don't remember doing it.
- I didn't do it.

180
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,999
I suppose you didn't
buy those clothes either.

181
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,959
I'd die before I'd hurt Bonnie.

182
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,505
Why do you suppose Ralph says things
like that if they're not true?

183
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,299
- I love her too much.
- How about you loved her so much...

184
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,551
you wouldn't come home
from Atlanta last month?

185
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,388
She went up to Atlanta to visit her cousin
for five days and then wouldn't come home.

186
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,433
She was having too big a time.
And then when I went up to get her...

187
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,019
she cussed me out
and said she never would come home.

188
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,021
How about how much you
loved her then?

189
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,232
Will you let me talk to her alone
for a few minutes?

190
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,692
She wouldn't come home to me
or to Bonnie.

191
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,444
We'll just be a few minutes.

192
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,539
You didn't answer my question,
Mrs. White.

193
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,166
That's not true, what he said.

194
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,001
What's not true?

195
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,713
I haven't been to Atlanta
in nearly a year.

196
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,590
Well, that's what I mean.

197
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,386
Why do you think he says things
like that if they're not true?

198
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,887
I don't know.

199
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,765
He'd have to have some reason
to do it, don't you think?

200
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,058
Yes, sir, I suppose so.

201
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,978
Have you thought
what that reason might be?

202
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,314
- I thought of one.
- What was that?

203
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,527
Maybe he wants to
get Bonnie away from me.

204
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,698
- You mean, by divorce?
- No, sir, maybe not that...

205
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:12,744
but maybe he can make me believe
I'm losing my mind.

206
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,164
Is that what you think
he's trying to do?

207
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,836
I don't know what else it could be,
the way he tells it. Am I?

208
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,297
I find no evidence of it.

209
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,299
But you're not positive?

210
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,677
Well, I couldn't be positive
of anything this quickly...

211
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,471
but the fact you may be
having spells of amnesia...

212
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,890
doesn't mean that you're,
what you call, "losing your mind."

213
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,975
Doesn't mean that at all.

214
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,354
It's no use...

215
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,106
'cause I am.

216
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,734
You don't wanna tell
me, but I know it now.

217
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,528
How do you know it, Mrs. White?

218
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,575
Because now I'm hearing voices too.

219
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,128
What kind of voices?

220
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,215
Just one voice, but that's
what that means, doesn't it?

221
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,218
- How long has this been going on?
- For months.

222
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,221
Why didn't you tell me this before?

223
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,517
- What does this voice say to you?
- She tells me to do things.

224
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,895
A woman's voice?

225
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,814
- Can you recognize it in any way?
- No, sir.

226
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,776
It sounds familiar sometimes...

227
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,195
but I don't really recognize it.

228
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,031
What does this voice
tell you to do?

229
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,327
To do things like...

230
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,747
leave Ralph...

231
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,791
take Bonnie and run away.

232
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,418
All kind of terrible things
like that.

233
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,130
That is what it means, isn't it?

234
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,094
- No, not in your case.
- But that's what everybody says.

235
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,680
And in most cases, they'd be right.

236
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,933
It's a serious manifestation,
the hearing of voices...

237
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,977
but the difference in
your case is this...

238
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,605
You've been frightened
by this voice...

239
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,650
because you recognize it
as a symptom of illness.

240
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,444
People who are actually
losing their minds...

241
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,572
rarely find anything extraordinary
about the hearing of voices.

242
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,658
They almost invariably assume...

243
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,994
it's some sort of extra privilege
that they enjoy...

244
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,163
like personal radio reception...

245
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,083
or built- in radar.

246
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,544
Yeah, but what if sometimes...

247
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,797
it sounds like my own voice?

248
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,927
Your own voice?
Doesn't make any difference.

249
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,263
Yes, it does.

I feel fine.

No.

257
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,855
I didn't have no headache.
She had one, but I didn't.

258
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,483
She?

259
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,360
Hey, you got a nice
place around here.

260
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,157
She always gets those headaches
when I wanna come out.

261
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,409
I think she's a real dope,
don't you?

262
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,538
- Who are you talking about?
- Eve White.

263
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,753
These hose! They're nylon,
and I'm allergic to nylon.

264
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,756
I think I'll take 'em off.
You don't mind, do you?

265
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,759
If you like.

266
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,930
I think you better turn around,
though.

267
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,683
You're kind of cute, but I don't
think I know you that well.

268
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,026
Maybe sometime, though, huh?

269
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,403
Hey, you like to go dancin'?

270
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,616
- Sometimes.
- Would you like to go dancin' with me?

271
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,910
Okay, you can turn around now.

272
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,500
- So, you're not Eve White?
- I certainly am not.

273
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,420
Hey, maybe one night this week. You can
tell your wife you gotta see a patient.

274
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,507
- And do what?
- And go dancin'.

275
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,968
I bet you're a real cute dancer.

276
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,513
I doubt if my wife would agree
with you about that...

277
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,683
but getting back to the point,
if you're not Eve White, who are you?

278
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,060
Now, what you trying to do, kid me?

279
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,064
Seems more likely you're
trying to kid me.

280
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,402
I'm Eve Black. You know that.

281
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,571
You mean that was your maiden name.

282
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,074
That's still my name.
I ain't never been married.

283
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,326
That's for laughs, gettin' married.

284
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,662
- What about Ralph?
- Come on now, Doc.

285
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,623
You don't think I'd
marry a jerk like that.

286
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,418
Then Bonnie isn't your child?

336
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,505
I don't know whether she heard me
or not, but I really hollered at her.

337
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,216
Boy, I can tell you, though,
I'm gonna fix his wagon.

338
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,969
I ain't gonna go through
the rest of my life with that creep.

339
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,847
And you say that
Bonnie's not your child.

340
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,310
Now, Doctor, how could I have a child
if I'm not even married?

341
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,854
You trying to insinuate something?

342
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,025
You mean, Ralph never made
love to you?

343
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,402
Boy, I'd like to see him try!

344
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,073
Where were you then
when Bonnie was born?

345
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:32,077
It looks like to me
that's your problem, Doctor, not mine.

346
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,829
Don't you have any fans in this office?
It's hot in here.

347
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,999
- How are you gonna fix Ralph's wagon?
- You really wanna know?

348
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,501
I do, indeed.

349
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,337
I'm gonna come out,
and I'm gonna stay out.

350
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,341
Were you ever on a stage, Miss Black?

351
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,177
No, not exactly on a stage...

352
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,846
but I sung in nightclubs, a lot of them.

353
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,516
<i>- Where?
- Well, across the river's one.</i>

354
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,186
- The Big Apple. You ever been there?
- No, I'm afraid I haven't.

355
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,856
They're crazy about me
at the Big Apple.

356
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,069
Every time I go in there,
they ask me to stand up and sing.

357
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,780
Of course, I have to
be in the mood to do it, though.

358
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,367
<i>- What kind of mood?
- I have to have a couple snorts first.</i>

359
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,831
Can you "come out," as you call it,
whenever you want to?

360
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,750
No. I wish I could, but I can't.

361
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,002
Sometimes I can, but sometimes I can't.

362
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,255
But I tell you one thing, though,
it's getting easier...

363
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,674
'cause she's getting weaker
and I'm getting stronger...

364
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:31,219
and one of these days, just like I tell you,
I'm gonna come out and stay out.

365
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,804
Just you wait and see.

366
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,974
And can you retire,
go back in when you want to?

367
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,060
Sure. You know what I done one night?

368
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,188
One night, Ralph had
to go to Savannah...

369
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,150
so I went over to the Big Apple
and I got kind of gassed up.

370
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,404
You know what I done the next morning?
I let her have the hangover.

371
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,158
She's faking.

372
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:57,078
- Boy, you should have seen her face!
- Listen, Mrs. White...

375
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,302

376
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,429

That's beautiful.
I've never heard it before.

I just like to read it anyway.

- Good morning, Doctor.
- Morning.

400
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,393
- Good morning, Doctor.
- How's it going?

401
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,770
I feel much better, thank you.

402
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,106
She looks better too,
don't you think?

403
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,067
- Yes, she really does.
- See you later, Mrs. White.

404
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,069
- Thank you.
- I'll be in the office, Doctor.

Thanks, Lenny.

406
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,449
- Heard from Ralph?
- Yes, sir.

407
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:02,620
- He came by for a few minutes yesterday.
- What about Bonnie?

408
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,749
She's back with my
mother and father now.

409
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,337
Tell me something, Mrs. White.

410
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,301
Would you say that your marriage,
speaking of it as a whole...

411
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,553
has been a happy one?

412
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,515
No, sir.

413
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,729
Well, some of it,
but not as a whole.

414
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,024
Don't you love Ralph?

415
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,570
Yes, sir.

416
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,741
Then why do you think
it hasn't been a happy marriage?

417
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,410
I don't know.

418
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,749
I guess I just haven't been able
to make him happy.

419
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,920
I don't know what it is I do
that irritates him so much, but I do.

Well, tell me something else.

421
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:02,764

that somewhere...

422
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,516
deep down inside you...

423
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,978
there might be somebody
you couldn't quite reach...

424
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,231
but that you nevertheless
knew was there?

425
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,740
No, sir. I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,962

- No, it's a hospital.

You don't see any bars
or anything like that, do you?

Is she crazy?

449
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,348
No, but it's quite possible you can drive her
crazy if you don't behave yourself.

00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,018
Why? I don't know what
I have to do with it.

do with her.

00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,210
- What do you mean?
- I mean simply this...

If you try anything like that,
if you get into any trouble at all...

459

it'll be Mrs. White

too many such cases...

Eve White about you.

- Do you object?
- Well, won't that worry her even more?

I thought you didn't care
what happened to her.

Well, I don't really, but, I mean,
you know, if she worries anymore...

484
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,792
ain't she liable to go crazy anyway?

I'd say the first logical step
to take in that direction...

would be to introduce
them to each other, wouldn't you?

00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,487
Have you ever heard of
multiple personality?

<i>NARRATOR: Now all
Dr. Luther had to do...</i>

503
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,123
<i>was to explain the

504
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,125
How are you, Ralph?

505
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,670
- Good morning, sir. How's Evie?
- Much better now.

506
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,297
Have you found out yet
what's the matter with her?

507
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,384
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Sit down, will you?

508
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,312
It's a very unusual case...

509
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,983
one of the rarest, in fact,
in the history of psychiatry.

510
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,778
- You don't say.
- Mrs. White's problem...

511
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,615
is what is called
multiple personality.

512
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,286
- Yes, sir.
- Have you ever heard of that?

513
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,706
No, sir.
I can't say as I ever have.

514
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,667
Well, what actually
happens is this...

515
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,420
At some point in the past...

516
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,339
apparently when she was
a little girl...

517
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,676
her personality became divided...

518
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,804
into two different personalities.

519
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,808
In effect, she's now
two different women...

520
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,061
entirely different in character.

521
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,233
To be more specific about it...

522
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,404
the girl you married,
Bonnie's mother...

523
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,699
sweet, quiet girl you fell in love with,
that's one of the women.

524
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:24,413
The other is the one that scared Bonnie,
the one who bought all the clothes...

525
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,665
the one that had that row
with you in Atlanta.

526
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,959
You know those headaches
and blackout spells?

527
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,044
Yes, sir.

528
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,631
Well, that was when this
other woman...

529
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,592
the one who calls herself
Eve Black...

530
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,594
was trying to get out.

531
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,971
Out of where?

532
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,310
Out of the body...
Your wife's body.

533
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,562
Well, how do you like that?

534
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,359
But what I want you to understand...

535
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:58,364
is that this is an actual
mental condition with Mrs. White.

536
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,908
It isn't pretending or faking.

537
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,827
She can't help it.

538
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,664
But that doesn't mean
she's psychotic...

539
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,207
crazy.

540
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,961
Do you understand?

541
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,588
No, sir.

542
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,513
Well, let's see if I can put
it to you in another way.

543
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:29,019
In the first place, no one has actually
ever defined the personality...

544
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,772
as a psychopathological...

545
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,780
- I think you better come with me.
- Yes, sir.

- How's Bonnie?
- She's all right.

552

I asked Ralph to come in so that
I could explain the situation to him...

553

you leave here.

Of course.

- Yes, sir.
- All right, now. May I speak with Eve Black?

568

no lead bottom like Ralph White there.

- Bonnie isn't your child?

- Dr. Luther. I know it's true.

Well, that's what I mean, Ralph.

ginned up. You was well enough for that.

681

all that to you.

You told me so yourself.

I asked two doctors about it.
You know what they said?

686

697

She scared her.

I don't wanna hear any more about it.

Dr. Luther, just for a few minutes?

- No. I already talked to two regular doctors.
- Then I'm not going!

00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,746
She's all dressed up for you,
very pretty, with flowers in her hair.

830
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,583
Miss Eve Black in person.

831
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,001
Wanna try hypnosis again?

832
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,919
You mean keep punting
and wait for a fumble?

833
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,509
- How do you do, Miss Black?
- Well, both docs.

834
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,928
You gonna protect him against me?

835
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,223
The way you look this morning,
I'm not so sure he'd want me to.

836
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:40,683
Well, say,

837
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,394
you look pretty sharp yourself,
you know that?

838
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,605
She's your patient, Doctor.

839
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,608
I'm much too old for that
sort of thing.

840
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:54,030
He's pretty cute
sometimes, don't ya think?

841
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,408
He's a living doll.
Will you come in?

842
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,369
Maybe I'd like him better
than I do you.

843
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:12,423
- What's the idea of all this?
- I wouldn't let her come back.

844
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,635
- Why not?
- 'Cause something's wrong.

845
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,765
- You think so?
- Well, she tried to kill herself last night.

846
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,230
Something's wrong somewhere.

847
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,948
- How did she try to kill herself?
- With a razor blade.

848
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:40,409
She's feeling awfully low, and when
I got what she had in her mind...

849
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,411
it near about scared me half to death.

850
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:46,082
Because if somebody didn't stop her,
I'd be gone too, you know what I mean?

851
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,250
Go on.

852
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,460
Well, there wasn't
anybody else there but me...

853
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,673
so when she went in the bathroom
and she locked the door, look.

854
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,930
She made one slash, and then I got out,
and I made her drop the blade...

855
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,391
and I got it and threw it away.

856
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,351
It was a close call.

857
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,856
- Do you think she meant it?
- I know she meant it.

858
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,859
If it'd been me, I
wouldn't have meant it.

859
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,946
I might be trying to scare somebody
or fool them or somethin'...

860
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,949
but I wouldn't go that far,
you know what I mean?

861
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,952
- I understand.
- But she was really leveling.

862
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,622
She really was gonna kill herself
if I hadn't stopped her.

863
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,587
When you said there was
something wrong somewhere...

864
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:38,801
did you mean something more
than the effort to kill herself?

865
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,845
- I sure did.
- What?

866
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,933
Now I'm having blackout spells too.

867
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:50,563
You mean, lapses of time when
you don't remember what's happened?

868
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,024
Let me tell you, it scares me too.

869
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,611
- May I speak to Mrs. White?
- Of course.

870
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,405
Mrs. White?

871
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,086
Eve Black tells me you
were very low.

872
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,884
Yes, I was.

873
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,139
Would you mind
going under hypnosis again?

874
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,559
If you say so.

875
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:33,731
All right. Now, relax...
completely.

876
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,942
When I count to three...

877
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:40,196
you'll be in a deep hypnotic state.

878
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,199
You understand? All right, now.

879
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,242
One...

880
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,287
Your eyelids are getting heavy...

881
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:51,707
<i>very heavy.</i>

882
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,044
Two...

883
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,672
Relax.

884
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,970
Three.

885
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,804
Who are you?

886
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,226
- Who do you think?
- I have no idea.

887
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,328
May I ask who you are?

888
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,290
I don't know that either.

889
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:22,381
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Certainly.

890
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:40,608
How's your heart?
Can you take another one?

891
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,902
- You're kidding?
- Come on.

892
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,826
Do you remember Dr. Day?

893
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,037
- How do you do, Doctor?
- How do you do?

894
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,498
- Well, then you must be Doctor...
- Luther.

895
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,667
Luther. Yes, of course.
I should have known.

896
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,669
You mean, you have heard of me?

897
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,464
Yes, through both Eve
White and Eve Black.

898
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,508
Not unfavorably, I trust.

899
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,178
On the contrary, they think
very highly of you, both of them.

900
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,514
Are we to understand...

901
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,724
This is a little awkward, but,

902
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,186
are we to understand
that you're no longer Mrs. White?

903
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,687
No, I'm not.

904
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,731
- Nor Eve Black?
- No.

905
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,317
Then may I ask what is your name?

906
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,403
I don't know.

907
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:29,281
Well, you do know Mrs. White
and Miss Black, don't you?

908
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,868
I know them in a way.
I don't think I know them very well.

909
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:35,037
You know they're...

910
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,165
Yes, I understand that.

911
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,460
It's a pretty bewildering
thing too, isn't it?

912
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,879
I should say
you are well within your rights...

913
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:46,632
in so describing the situation...

914
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:51,428
and may I add, it seems to grow
no less so with the passage of time.

915
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,639
I wish I understood it better.

916
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,766
How long...

917
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,435
As I say, it's not easy
to phrase these questions...

918
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,063
without sounding like an idiot, but,

919
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,232
how long have you,

920
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,651
well, been around?

921
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:11,949
I don't know, but I don't think
it could have been very long.

922
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,702
What do you know about Mrs. White?

923
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,870
What about Jane?

924
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,001
Jane who?

925
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,003
No, I mean for my name. "Jane."

926
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,590
- Well, why Jane?
- Why not?

927

Hill Brothers.
Hold for just a minute.

939
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,553
- Hold just a moment.
- Hill Brothers.

940
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,768
- Hill Brothers. Thank you for waiting.
- Hill Brothers.

941
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,651
What? Well, just keep your
britches on, sugar foot.

942
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,653
I'll get your party for you.

943
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,197
Let me figure out which one it is.

944
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,408
Okay, that it? What?

945
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,452
Well, who are you?

946
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,496
Well, honey,
you're not the right one.

947
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,873
No, get off the line. You're not...

948
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:46,460
Look, I don't care who you are.
Blast off, Buster.

949
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,755
<i>Or the pleasant young woman

950
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,299
<i>What, in short,
had nature in the first place...</i>

951
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,385
<i>intended this woman to be?</i>

952
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,059
Not yet, Janey.

953
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,144
What's the use, Earl?

954
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,024
You did say you loved me,
didn't you?

955
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,776
Yes, I did.

956
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,530
Well, then, is it fair
to say you love me...

957
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,616
but can't marry me
without telling me why not?

958
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,620
I just can't. I know it isn't fair.
I just can't.

959
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,622
What is it, honey?

960
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,291
Because I'm not gonna let you
get away with anything like this.

961
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,544
This means too much to me.
You've got to tell me.

962
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:32,589
Please, Earl,
just don't ask me anymore. Please?

963
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,634
I'm sorry, Janey, I've got to.

964
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:39,638
I... I can't give you up
without even knowing what's the matter.

965
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,312
All right, then. I'll tell you.

966
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:52,359
Did you read in the newspaper
about a month ago...

967
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,195
about a multiple personality case...

968
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:59,324
a woman that has three personalities?

969
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:02,202
- In the Chronicle?
- Yes, that's the one.

970
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:05,998
- Yeah, I read it. What about it?
- I'm that woman.

971
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,918
You're the...

972
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,837
That's right.

973
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,010
But you sound all right.

974
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,929
- Do I?
- You sound fine.

975
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,558
Well, maybe I do...

976
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,977
but not the other two.

977
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,105
Other two?

978
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,608
Sure. There are two others, you know...

979
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,152
and they're very different from me...

980
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,489
and I don't even ever know
when they're coming out.

981
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,201
Holy Moses.

982
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,788
So that's all there is to it.

983
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,832
Oh, no, it isn't,
not by a long shot.

984
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,169
What I mean is...

985
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,421
that doesn't scare me.

986
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,174
I feel just exactly the same...

987
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,593
exactly as I felt before.

988
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:04,264
I love you just exactly the same...

989
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,893
maybe even more.

990
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,189
Whatever it is, we can
handle it together.

991
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,819
Earl, don't you understand?

992
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:20,322
It's not you marrying me.

993
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,075
It's me marrying anybody.

994
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,329
I'm sick. I am mentally sick...

995
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,082
and I cannot marry anybody ever.

01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,856
How are you, Mrs. White?

1000
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:57,067
I don't feel very well.

1001
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,739
Let's go inside and
talk it over, shall we?

1002
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:18,797
- You look tired.
- Yes, I'm very tired.

1003
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,050
I seem to be tired all the time now.

1004
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:26,054
Has the lively Miss Black
been keeping you out late?

1005
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,390
Yes, I guess so.

1006
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,976
Anyway, I seem to be
forgettin' more than ever now.

1007
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,812
Well, that could also be Jane,
you know.

1008
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,399
Yes, I know.

1009
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,027
What do you think of Jane?

1010
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,989
Well, from what you've told me...

1011
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,575
I hope she'll be the one.

1012
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,494
- The one to what?
- To live.

1013
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,749
Is that what you think
is going to happen...

1014
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,627
that two of you will
eventually disappear?

1015
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,337
Don't you?

1016
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,715
Well, I have thought so at times.

1017
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:07,346
Well, that's what I think...

1018
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,015
and I think it'll be Jane...

1019
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,392
at least, I hope so.

1020
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:17,189
Did you go up Sunday to see Bonnie?

1021
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,566
- Yes, sir.
- Did you have fun with her?

1022
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,152
I did for a while.

1023
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:25,197
Then I forgot for a while.

1024
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,700
Then I came back again
before I left.

1025
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,372
When... When I was saying
good- bye to Bonnie...

1026
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,249
she said to me...

1027
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,293
"Don't come back that other way,
Mommy.

1028
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,295
"I don't like that other way."

1029
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,632
- Eve Black?
- I guess when I was up there last month...

1030
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,634
she must have come out...

1031
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:48,261
and she must have been
cross with Bonnie...

1032
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,805
or slapped her or somethin'.

1033
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,640
But then she said...

1034
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,726
"Come back this way, Mommy,
the way you are now,"

1035
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,479
so I knew that it must have been Jane...

1036
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:02,067
that came out this time when I forgot,
and she was sweet to Bonnie.

1037
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:07,489
But then when Papa
was driving me out of the yard...

1038
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:13,829
I got the strangest feeling that
I wasn't never gonna see her again...

1039
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,374
that this was the last time.

1040
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,921
And I wanted to jump out of that truck
and go hug her...

1041
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,009
and try to explain to her
and try to tell her.

1042
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:34,307
But I don't know.
How do you explain to a little girl?

1043
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,811
How do you make her understand
that her real mommy...

1044
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,896
isn't ever coming back...

1045
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,942
but another woman
who just looks like her?

1046
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,071
Why do you think
you'll be one of the ones to go?

1047
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,285
Just the way I feel, I guess.

1048
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,455
I don't really mind, not anymore.

1049
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,791
I'm not fit for her now.

1050
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:03,503
I'm not fit for anything, really.
I know that.

1051
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,798
But if it's Jane, if...

1052
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,801
if she'll just understand...

1053
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:14,056
how much a little girl
needs love and understanding...

1054
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,558
then I won't mind dying...

1055
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,561
you know, if she'll just
take good care of her for me.

1056
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,981
May I speak to Jane now, please?

1057
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,734
Yes, sir.

1058
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,444
Jane?

1059
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:39,331
Good morning.

1060
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,336
It was me that came out on Sunday...

1061
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,465
and while I was there...

1062
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:53,261
a curious thing happened
that I think you might be interested in.

1063
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,013
What was that?

1064
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,809
Well...

1065
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,647
Well, it was this:

1066
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,609
Bonnie and her mother
were out in the backyard.

1067
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,446
They were playing ball, you know,
bouncing a ball back and forth.

1068
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,949
Now, you ready? All right.

1069
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,700
Here it comes.

1070
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:18,620
Very good.

1071
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,664
Do it again, Mommy.

1072
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,502
Okay. Here we go.

1073
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,175
Look, it's under the house.

1074
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,845
That's all right, honey. I'll get it.

1075
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:52,529
You wait here, darling.
Mother will get it for you.

1076
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,951
Can you see it?

1077
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:18,096
<i>JANE: Then when I got under there,
a strange thing happened.</i>

1078
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:42,078
<i>Suddenly I was littler.</i>

1079
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:45,457
<i>I was a little girl
under the house.</i>

1080
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,792
<i>I could smell the odor
of fresh earth...</i>

1081
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,794
<i>like a long time ago...</i>

1082
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,880
<i>and morning glories...</i>

1083
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,759
<i>though there are no morning glories
growing around there now.</i>

1084
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:05,060
And you still can't remember
anything at all about your childhood?

1085
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,062
No, not even of being a child.

1086
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,898
Do you think Eve White might be able to
remember something about it?

1087
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,067
- I have no idea.
- May I speak with her, please?

1088
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,319
- Of course.
- Mrs. White?

1089
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,576
Jane tells me that when she came out
up there on Sunday...

1090
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,579
when you were playing
catch with Bonnie...

1091
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:28,458
the ball rolled under the house,
and she went under after it.

1092
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,087
And when she got under there...

1093
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,965
she had a feeling of being very small...

1094
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,050
a child...

1095
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:41,805
a very curious and somehow frightening
feeling, as if she'd been there before.

1096
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,891
Now, this had some meaning for her.

1097
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,271
Can you remember
when you were very little...

1098
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,065
any experience like that of any kind?

1099
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:57,862
No, sir.

1100
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:02,826
Will you think back to when you were,
say, five or six or seven years old...

1101
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,703
something like that?

1102
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:10,667
No, sir. I can't remember
anything like that under the house.

1103
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,629
Perhaps under hypnosis.
Would you mind?

1104
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,674
No, sir, I don't mind.

1105
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:21,344
All right, then.
Will you close your eyes, please? Relax.

1106
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,723
One...

1107
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,061
two...

1108
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,817
three.

1109
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:41,823
Now, I want you to think back
to when you were five years old...

1110
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,369
just a little girl on the farm,
a very little girl...

1111
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:50,081
playing around the
house in the backyard.

1112
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,711
Sometimes you play under the house,
don't you?

1113
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,922
Yes, sir.

1114
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:01,801
Did you ever go under
the house for a ball?

1115
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,348
I don't remember.

1116
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:10,685
- Was it dark under the house?
- Yes, sir, very dark.

1117
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,938
- Did it scare you?
- No, sir.

1118
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:19,361
All right. Now you're six...
six years old...

1119
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,615
still playing around the house...

1120
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,658
in the backyard.

1121
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,457
<i>Do you still go under the house
sometimes?</i>

1122
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:35,794
Yes.

1123
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:40,340
Now, can you remember
one particular time...

1124
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,178
<i>when something happened to you
when you were under there?</i>

1125
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,763
She took...

1126
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,766
I don't want to, please.

1127
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,228
<i>Did a ball go under the house?</i>

1128
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,523
I want my cup.

1129
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:01,111
Florence, give me my blue china cup!

1130
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,654
<i>I want my cup.</i>

1131
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,698
I don't want to.

1132
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:10,453
I don't like all those flowers.
Please, I don't want to.

1133
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,875
Mama, please, I don't want to.
There's too many people.

1134
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,879
Please, Mama, don't make me!

1135
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:22,006
Mama, please don't make...

1136
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,562
- Mrs. White?
- What were you doing to her?

1137
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,232
- Eve?
- Of course. What are you tryin' to get at?

1138
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,568
I'll tell you what I'm
trying to get at.

1139
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:44,070
I'm interested in something
that Jane told me...

1140
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:46,948
about being under the house,
your mother's house...

1141
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,367
probably when you
were about six years old.

1142
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:53,163
It upset Mrs. White very much.
Can you remember what it was?

1143
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,665
No, I didn't pay much attention
to anything in those days.

1144
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,751
- You came out then, didn't you?
- Yeah...

1145
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:01,754
but only when I wanted to do something
she didn't want to do.

1146
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:05,884
Didn't she ever tell you about all those
lickings she got for things she didn't do?

1147
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,471
What are you doing out here now?
I didn't call you.

1148
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,894
Well, I don't know.
I just had to, I guess.

1149
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,230
Do you remember anything
about a blue china cup?

1150
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:24,486
I don't remember anything about anything
like that. How long is this gonna go on?

1151
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,363
Until we find out what's the trouble,
of course.

1152
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:32,410
- How long do you think that's gonna be?
- I have no idea.

1153
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,706
You know what I think?

1154
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,124
What?

1155
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,337
I think I'm not having much fun anymore.

1156
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,632
Well, you're still
getting out, aren't you?

1157
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,800
Not like I used to.

1158
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,679
Is it Jane that's doing
that to me?

1159
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,559
I don't know.
What do you think?

1160
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,315
I wish I knew more about her.

1161
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,528
What do you want to know about her?

1162
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,488
I don't know.

1163
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,699
It's not like it used to be
when I knew all about Eve White...

1164
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:15,453
and she didn't know anything about me,
and there wasn't anybody else.

1165
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,622
That's the way I liked it.

1166
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,750
It's all changed now, hasn't it?

1167
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,795
Now there's Jane.

1168
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,172
Yeah.

1169
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,010
Do you like her?

1170
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:35,723
- Very much.
- More than you do me?

1171
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,185
I don't like anybody
more than I do you, really.

1172
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:44,190
You never would go out
and have a good time with me, would you?

1173
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,570
A psychiatrist can't go out with a patient.
That's against the rules.

1174
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:54,617
Would you go out with me
if you wasn't a doctor?

1175
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:58,079
Anytime you'd let me.

1176
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:06,713
Does she know all about what I do?

1177
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,799
She tell you?

1178
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,885
When I ask her.

1179
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,724
- Like about that sergeant?
- Yeah, she told me about that.

1180
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:21,561
That's what I mean. Having somebody
running all the time telling on you.

1181
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,063
Well, you tell me about Mrs. White,
don't you?

1182
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:26,482
Yeah, but she don't do anything.

1183
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,407
- You know somethin', Doc?
- What?

1184
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,872
You remember that red dress,
the low- cut one?

1185
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,458
How could I forget it?

1186
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,296
I want you to have it.

1187
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,842
A low- cut dress for me?

1188
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,555
I want you to have it
if anything happens.

1189
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,225
What do you mean,
if anything happens?

1190
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,979
Something's the matter.

1191
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,233
I don't know what it is,
but something's the matter.

1192
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:13,404
You don't think
we're ever gonna get well, do ya?

1193
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,240
Of course I do.

1194
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,119
Well, I don't.

1195
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,540
I think we're gonna die,
all of us.

1196
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:28,920
Eve.

1197
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,591
You didn't think I could cry,
did you?

1198
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,593
You never have before.

1199
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,519
You know, I remember
the first time I ever saw you.

1200
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,731
You was the first one
I ever said who I was...

1201
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:50,858
<i>first one ever knew me.</i>

1202
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,655
You liked that red dress,
didn't you?

1203
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,700
Very much, indeed.
I think it's a beautiful dress.

1204
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,453
Well, I want you to have it...

1205
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:07,542
'cause you're the only one that knows
what it's meant to me, the only one.

1206
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:11,129
I know of nothing
that's gonna happen to you...

1207
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:14,841
<i>but I do appreciate the dress,
believe me.</i>

1208
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:19,762
Now may I speak to Jane?

1209
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,267
Of course.

1210
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:25,810
<i>Jane?</i>

1211
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,191
Good- bye, Doc.

1212
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,278
Good- bye, Eve.

1213
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,996
Jane?

1214
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,500
Yes?

1215
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,503
What do you think she meant?

1216
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:57,175
I don't know.

1217
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:01,596
Have you remembered about that blue
china cup or under the house?

1218
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,765
- No.
- Mrs. White?

1219
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,602
No!

1220
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,189
No! No!

1221
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:14,609
No, Mama, I don't want to!

1222
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,695
Mama, please don't make me!
Please!

1223
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:22,158
Please... Please...
Please don't make me, Mama! Please!

1224
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:25,787
- Jane?
- Please... Mama!

1225
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,624
What happened, Jane,
under the house?

1226
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,668
She made me kiss her!
She made me kiss her!

1227
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,671
I didn't want to! Mama, please!

1228
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:42,929
- I'll beat you!
- I'll beat you!

1229
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,139
<i>- I'll beat you!
- Evie!</i>

1230
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:46,641
Evie?

1231
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,644
Come on, sugar.
Time to get your clothes on.

1232
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:52,063
I'll be there in a minute, Mama.

1233
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:55,024
Come on, Evie. I don't wanna
come in there after you.

1234
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,568
You come on this minute, you hear?

1235
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,658
You got to kiss Grandma good- bye.

1236
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:07,078
Then you won't miss her so much
if you kiss her good- bye, sugar pie.

1237
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,788
You know that.

1238
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:15,628
<i>Please don't make me.
I don't want to.</i>

1239
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,630
- Papa.
- Evie. Evie, darlin'.

1240
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,550
- Don't let her make me.
- Evie, now, you do like your mommy says.

1241
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,844
- Come on, now. You give her to me.
- You got to, honey.

1242
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,637
- I don't want to!
- Now, baby. I know, sugar.

1243
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:27,014
- All you have to do is kiss her on the cheek.
- Don't make me.

1244
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,851
- Please. I don't want to.
- Then you won't miss her so much.

1245
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,687
- I don't want to, Mama!
- Now, you got to kiss her good- bye.

1246
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,897
- Please, Mama!
- Then you won't miss her so much.

1247
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,775
I don't want to. Please, Mama.

1248
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,820
- Please! Please! I don't want to.
- Come on, sugar.

1249
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,738
<i>Kiss her good- bye
so you won't miss her so much.</i>

1250
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:44,657
<i>Don't make me. Don't make me.</i>

1251
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,367
<i>[SCREAMING]</i>

1252
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,753
She didn't mean any wrong by it.

1253
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,800
It's just the way
people thought in those days,

1254
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,845
that if you kissed the dead face...

1255
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:09,473
it was a sweet good- bye,
and you wouldn't miss her so much.

1256
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:12,643
That's all she meant.

1257
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:16,647
Do you think a great
deal about death now?

1258
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:19,191
No.

1259
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,819
Just that...

1260
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,700
"Life's a city full of
straying streets...

1261
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,747
"and death's the marketplace
where each one meets."

1262
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,542
Just that. Someday it'll happen.

1263
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,837
Who wrote that, that poem?

1264
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,257
Shakespeare, wasn't it?

1265
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:46,218
- Where did you learn it?
- In high school.

1266
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:50,264
Mr. Montgomery recited it
to us one day.

1267
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:53,684
- Who was Mr. Montgomery?
- The English teacher.

1268
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,734
Who was your first teacher...

1269
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:05,321
the very first, when you first
started going to school?

1270
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:11,285
- That was in Fortsville. Miss Bates.
- And the second grade?

1271
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,963
Miss Bates in the first grade...

1272
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:27,343
Miss Griffith in the second grade...

1273
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:32,640
Miss Stewart in the third grade...

1274
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:36,102
and then we moved to Richmond...

1275
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:40,022
and we had Miss Patterson
in the fourth grade.

1276
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:42,650
<i>Do you remember all of 'em?</i>

1277
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,735
<i>- May I say 'em?
- Go on.</i></i>

1278
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,905
And in Richmond...

1279
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,282
we lived on Fifth Street.

1280
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,245
237 Fifth Street...

1281
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,999
right next door to the Thompsons...

1282
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,668
Rick and Mary Lou Thompson.

1283
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:07,008
And Mr. Thompson worked at the railroad
in the machine shop...

1284
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:11,637
because I remember one Sunday he took us
all down to look at the machines...

1285
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:15,099
Rick and Mary Lou and Florence
and myself.

1286
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,854
Florence is my cousin.
I remember!

1287
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,816
May I speak to Mrs. White?

1288
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,653
- Do you have to?
- Mrs. White?

1289
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:39,582
She's gone.

1290
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,959
Eve?

1291
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,381
<i>- They're gone.</i>
- Eve Black?</i>

1292
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,217
They're gone, I tell you,
both of them.

1293
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:55,264
They're gone, and there's
nobody else here but me.

1294
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,975
I know it. I can feel it.

1295
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,771
And I can remember.

1296
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,273
I can remember everything.

1297
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,026
Mama and Papa and Bonnie and...

1298
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:12,531
I can remember.

1299
01:30:13,784 --> 01:30:17,078
I can remember. I can remember.

1300
