1
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,890
OK... Corral

2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,230
OK... Corral

3
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,600
There the outlaw band
made their final stand

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,870
OK... Corral

5
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,470
Oh, my dearest, one must die,
lay down my gun

6
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,310
Or take the chance
of losing you forever

7
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,520
Duty calls,
my back's against the wall

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,220
Have you no kind word to say
before I ride away?

9
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,430
Your love... your love

10
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,030
I need... your love

11
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,670
Keep the flame, let it burn

12
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:28,770
Until I return from
the gunfight at OK Corral

13
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,310
lf the Lord is my friend

14
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,880
We'll meet at the end
of the gunfight at OK Corral

15
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,660
Gunfight at OK Corral

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,160
OK... Corral

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,440
OK... Corral

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,270
There the outlaw band

19
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,900
Made their final stand

20
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,140
OK... Corral

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,650
Oh, my dearest, one must die

22
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,350
Lay down my gun

23
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,980
And take the chance

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,750
Of losing you forever

25
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,130
Duty calls

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,630
My back's against the wall

27
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,800
Have you no kind word to say
before I ride away?

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,240
Away

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,250
Boot Hill

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

31
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,080
Boot Hill

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,410
So cold

34
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,650
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

35
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,050
So still

36
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,380
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,580
There they lay,
side by side,

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,330
The killers that died
in the gunfight at OK Corral

39
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,100
OK... Corral

40
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,730
Gunfight at OK Corral.

41
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,480
Hello, Ed.

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,780
Where's Doc Holliday?

43
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,350
Over at the hotel,
more than likely.

44
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,650
He's been
expecting you...

45
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,490
Get word over there
I’m waiting for him.

46
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,490
No need to do that, Ed.

47
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,830
The whole town knows
you're waiting for him by now.

48
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,300
Before there's
another killing...

49
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,300
You just go on serving
your watered-down liquor

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,890
and keep out
of my business, Shanssey.

51
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,660
stinking drunk,

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,670
spoiling for a fight.

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,690
Whiskey!

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,800
He drew a gun
on Holliday.

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,830
Over there!

56
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,940
Have it your way, Ed.

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,280
Check your guns,
if you want to stay here.

58
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,520
Leave the bottle!

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,830
You don't stand a chance, Doc.

60
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,200
Bailey brought two men with him.

61
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,540
Oh, come on, honey,

62
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,570
let's cut out of here
while there's still time.

63
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,130
The whole town, including
that no-good marshal,

64
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,240
is laying for you.

65
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,240
Right or wrong, they're going
to hang you for another killing.

66
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,280
You know it.

67
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,050
Doc.

68
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,180
Oh, you ain't even
listening to me.

69
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,520
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey
came all the way from Fort Worth

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,590
to see me
on a gentleman's matter.

71
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,690
''Gentleman.''

72
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,760
It wouldn't be hospitable

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,390
for me to leave town,
now, would it?

74
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,300
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.

75
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,470
Well, it's a pure case
of ethics, but...

76
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,240
Well, that's something

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,040
a person like you
wouldn't understand.

78
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,710
Why do you always have
to treat me like I’m dirt?

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,740
You ain't no better than me!

80
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,840
That's debatable.

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,940
Oh, is it?

82
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,650
You and that
magnolia drippin'.

83
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,750
Well, let me tell you
something, Doc Holliday.

84
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,850
All them fancy clothes
and that smart talk

85
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,260
don't make you no gentleman!

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,730
You are dirt, just like me.

87
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,600
And I’m tired of hearing
about that...

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,830
Georgia plantation

89
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,360
and all them lily-white
friends of yours.

90
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,740
They're all gone now!

91
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,300
They're all gone!

92
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,300
Yes, they are...

93
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,320
and here I am with you.

94
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,580
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out

95
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,020
just to send you
through dental school.

96
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,950
You sure turned out fine.

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,860
They'd be real proud of you.

98
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,760
Ow!

99
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,600
Don't you ever mention
my family again.

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,260
Doc, please...

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,140
Doc, please.

102
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,070
Forget about Bailey.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,020
Let's get out of here
while there's still time.

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,420
Maybe...

105
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,950
Maybe we could
even go to Laredo

106
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,020
like you... you said

107
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,860
and do something about
that cough of yours.

108
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,160
It's getting worse all the time.

109
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,030
Your concern over my health
touches me deeply.

110
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,190
You know how
I feel about you.

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,070
I know exactly how you feel.

112
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,240
I don't know...

113
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,830
I don't know what I'd do

114
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,070
if anything
happened to you.

115
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,380
You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?

116
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,310
That ain't nice
to say to me, Doc.

117
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,950
I’ve been good
to you, ain't l?

118
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,510
Why don't you think
about me once in a while?

119
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,230
All right, get over
to Shanssey's

120
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,660
and tell him
I’ll be there later.

121
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,060
Please, don't go there.

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,120
Do as I tell you.

123
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,240
I need some money.

124
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,860
Hello, Wyatt.

125
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,740
Cotton Wilson.

126
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,370
It’s been a long time.

127
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,680
Man, I’m plain worn out.

128
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Hope you got some
good news for me.

129
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,350
Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago, heading east.

130
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,360
Waco, I think.

131
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,360
Johnny Ringo was with him.

132
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,490
Rode through, heading east?

133
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,690
You didn't get my telegram.

134
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,720
I got it.

135
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,190
Well, why didn't you
hold him?

136
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,170
I had no quarrel
with Ike Clanton.

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,570
Nothing to hold him for.

138
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,770
Nothing to hold him for?

139
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,800
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.

140
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,340
I played this whole thing
so he'd be forced into Griffin.

141
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,940
I figured if there was one man
in Texas who could stop him,

142
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,420
you'd be the man.

143
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,180
Now, don't go getting your blood
heated up, Wyatt.

144
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,750
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp
you're talking to.

145
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,230
Ten years ago, I watched
you walk single-handed

146
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,820
into a saloon
in Oklahoma City,

147
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,920
and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.

148
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,760
Ten years
is a long time ago.

149
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,460
Getting old, I guess.

150
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,810
Anybody ever told me that
Cotton Wilson had gone yellow,

151
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,180
I would have called
them a liar.

152
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,010
You have no right
to say that to me, Wyatt.

153
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,480
I’ve bucked heads with the
toughest gangs on the frontier.

154
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Then why didn't you
stop Ringo and Clanton?

155
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,690
Well, why didn't you?!

156
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,680
lf you can't handle it anymore,
turn in your badge!

157
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,390
Turn in my badge.

158
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,560
I’ve been a lawman for 25 years.

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Worked every hellhole
in the territory.

160
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,070
You know what I got
to show for it?

161
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,670
A $1 2-a-month room in the back
of a cruddy boardinghouse,

162
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,700
and a tin star.

163
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,810
Think I like winding up
in a place like this?

164
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,880
It’s the end of the line
for me, Wyatt.

165
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,890
It'll happen to you someday.

166
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,680
Just like it happens
to all of us.

167
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,890
Where is that
yellow-livered skunk?

168
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,030
Slow down, Ed.

169
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,800
Holliday's only
trying to rile you.

170
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,170
What do you figure's
keeping Holliday?

171
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,150
Doc's going to make 'em
dangle a little.

172
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,120
Wyatt Earp.

173
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,120
Why, you old son of a gun.

174
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,310
Why didn't you let us know
you was riding into town?

175
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,580
Good to see you, John.

176
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,950
Hi, Marshal.

177
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,220
Come on, sit down.

178
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,390
Cigar?

179
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,500
I’ll be a son of a gun.

180
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,230
You've sure come a long ways

181
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,700
since the railroading
days in Cheyenne.

182
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,230
Ellsworth, Wichita,
now Dodge City.

183
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,170
Funny, I never figured
you for a lawman.

184
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,140
You was always
pretty reckless and wild.

185
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,040
Never figured myself
for a lawman, either.

186
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,380
Fix a nice steak
for Mr. Earp.

187
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,380
Yes, sir.

188
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,040
My personal stock.

189
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
How are the brothers?

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,010
Fine. Virgil and
Morgan are married.

191
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,140
Virgil and Morgan married?

192
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,050
What do you know.

193
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,490
John, I need some help.

194
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,890
Anything I can do for you.

195
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,390
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo

196
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,160
rode through here
three days ago.

197
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,790
They got a dozen counts
against them.

198
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,320
I telegraphed Cotton
to hold them,

199
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,330
but he crossed me up.

200
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,360
Cotton's skidded a long way.

201
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,560
You know anything?

202
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,330
Wish I did, but...

203
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

204
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,400
Doc Holliday played poker
with them.

205
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
Maybe he heard something.

206
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,900
Bartender!

207
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,240
Bartender!

208
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,440
whiskey around here!

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,810
Ed Bailey.

210
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,650
Doc Holliday
killed his brother.

211
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,850
The guy was begging for it.

212
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,510
He came in drunk,
cheated at cards.

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,850
He pulled a gun on Doc.

214
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,020
Did you ever
meet Holliday?

215
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,990
We crossed trails once.

216
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,220
He was a dentist then.

217
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,630
You know, I’ve yet
to see the guy pick a fight.

218
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,820
Trouble just naturally
seems to find him.

219
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,860
It’s gotten so every would-be
gunman on the frontier

220
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,530
wants the honor of
putting him in Boot Hill.

221
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,970
You know how it is when
a man gets a reputation.

222
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,530
I sure do.

223
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,800
Where is Holliday?

224
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,370
I better get to him
while the getting's good.

225
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,440
He's at the hotel.

226
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
Keep that steak warm,
I’ll be back.

227
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,610
You ain't missing much;
it's longhorn.

228
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,840
Holliday.

229
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,150
Sit down, make
yourself at home,

230
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,380
just like you were invited.

231
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,850
I don't know if you
remember me...

232
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,120
I remember you--
Wyatt Earp.

233
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,720
Pulled a tooth for you
ten years ago.

234
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,520
lf I knew
when I had you in the chair

235
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,290
what you were going to turn out
to be, l...

236
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,960
I hear you've taken up
a new occupation.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,760
It’s too bad;
you were a good dentist.

238
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,740
My patients didn't
like my coughing.

239
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,970
I’d like some information.

240
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,240
The name of this game
is solitaire.

241
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,720
I’m in a position to do
a little horse trading.

242
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,880
Good evening,
Mr. Earp.

243
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,610
I know something
that would interest you.

244
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,620
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

245
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,660
Suppose I was to tell you
that Ed Bailey...

246
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,890
has a small derringer
hidden in his boot.

247
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,060
Left or right?

248
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,470
Left.

249
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,600
I’d say that was
good information--

250
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,970
Bailey's left-handed.

251
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,170
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo

252
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,610
rode through here
three days ago.

253
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,800
You played cards with them.

254
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,070
Which way were they heading?

255
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,100
Beats me.

256
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,510
I thought we were
making a deal.

257
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,510
That's what you said.

258
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,670
I didn't make any deals.

259
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
But you know where
they went, don't you?

260
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,680
Look, you're
interrupting my game.

261
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,640
You've got a real big hate
for the law, haven't you?

262
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,800
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't?

263
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,970
Your brother, Morgan,

264
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,670
ran me out
of Deadwood last year

265
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,240
and impounded $1 0,000
of my money.

266
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,440
As a matter of fact,
you've got brothers

267
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,080
marshaling all over
the frontier, haven't you?

268
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,220
I’ll see you again,
Holliday.

269
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,780
lf you're around.

270
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,100
What did you find out?

271
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,500
Not a thing.

272
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,200
It’s my hunch they're
headed for Tombstone.

273
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,400
Ike's old man has
a big ranch there.

274
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,840
But I can't be sure.

275
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,180
Isn't your brother Virgil
a marshal at Tombstone?

276
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,740
That's right.

277
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,550
I sent him a telegram,
asking him to be

278
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,310
on the lookout for him,
just in case.

279
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,450
What are you going to do?

280
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,680
There's nothing I can do.

281
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,020
The trail's ice cold.

282
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,120
I’m heading back for Dodge City
in the morning.

283
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,500
Mr. Holliday.

284
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,660
Yes.

285
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
Would you care to settle up
your bill now?

286
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,530
Well, uh...

287
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,830
What I mean, sir, is

288
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,840
we didn't know whether you
were checking out or not.

289
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,310
You'll have word
in 1 5 minutes.

290
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,610
Doc, you're walking
into a stacked deck.

291
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,550
lf Bailey don't get you,
the marshal will.

292
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,180
You'd be smart to get out
while you can.

293
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,850
You act as if you want
to get killed.

294
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,220
Maybe I do.

295
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,960
Holliday...

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,630
let's check your gun.

297
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,250
Good evening, Harry.

298
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,850
The usual.

299
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,360
Yes, sir.

300
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,650
I understand
there's a gentleman

301
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,030
in from Fort Worth
to see me.

302
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,560
This gentleman should have
taught his brother better

303
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,970
than to deal
with a marked deck.

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,230
Well, if you happen to see
this, uh... gentleman,

305
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,300
tell him I’ll be waiting
for him at Boot Hill.

306
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,810
He'll have only one direction
to travel from there--

307
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,840
down.

308
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,680
Come to think of it...

309
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,350
he's no gentleman at all.

310
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,550
He's a son
of a yellow-bellied sow.

311
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,640
All right, Doc, let's go.

312
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,370
Right on cue.

313
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,110
What's the charge?

314
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,440
We'll think of one.

315
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,420
I’m sure you will.

316
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,820
Thanks, Harry.

317
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,180
All right, get him
out of here.

318
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,190
It’s all over, folks.

319
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,200
Break it up.

320
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,460
Come on, step up to the bar.

321
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,860
Free drinks, on the house.

322
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,130
Come on, give me
some beer, bartender.

323
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,730
Ah, it's always a mess
after a killing.

324
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,800
Looks like Doc spoiled
everybody's fun.

325
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,900
He's crazy, but he's
got nerve, though--

326
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,340
plenty of nerve.

327
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,710
Shanssey, Mr. Earp, what are you
going to about this?

328
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,800
You saw what happened.

329
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,540
They had no right
to take Doc off.

330
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,640
They're going to do something
to him, I know it.

331
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,650
Kate Fisher,
friend of Doc's.

332
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,910
He's going to be framed.

333
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,440
You saw it--
Bailey pulled a gun on him.

334
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,980
Wait a minute, Miss Fisher,
take it easy.

335
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,050
Why don't you just relax
and let the law handle this.

336
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,420
There ain't no law
in this town.

337
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,620
I never saw a man beg more
to get his brains blown out.

338
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,920
Please, you've got
to help him.

339
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,120
Doc Holliday's none
of my business.

340
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,260
Please, Mr. Earp.

341
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,630
I don't want
any part of him.

342
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,630
I don't even like him.

343
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,630
I’m sorry.

344
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,660
Good night.

345
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,010
Kate, I can have a
pair of saddle horses

346
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,740
put round back
of the hotel.

347
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,140
That's as much as I can do.

348
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,670
With the feeling
against Doc,

349
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,740
I wouldn't stay in
business ten minutes

350
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,270
if they knew
I’d helped him.

351
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,390
Ten, please.

352
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,600
Wilson live here?

353
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,040
Why, no, sir.

354
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,810
They're just holding
Doc Holliday

355
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,010
upstairs in his room.

356
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,340
Oh.

357
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
Mr. Earp.

358
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,860
Look, Miss Fisher, I told you
this is none of my business.

359
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,400
I don't care what you
think of me and Doc.

360
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,060
There's a lynch mob
starting across the street.

361
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,760
That's your business,
ain't it?

362
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,800
Don't make no difference
whether Doc is right or wrong.

363
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,500
He don't deserve to be hung
by a pack of animals.

364
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,220
You're getting out of here.

365
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,360
Since when have you taken

366
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,870
to rescuing gamblers
in distress?

367
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,670
Don't take it personal, Doc.

368
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,610
I just don't like lynchings.

369
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,110
What are we waiting for?

370
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,300
Not yet.

371
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,090
I’d say now is
a very good time.

372
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,610
Hey, Sturges' barn!

373
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,730
That's it.

374
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,130
Get going down
the back stairs.

375
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,900
Much obliged, Marshal.

376
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,740
I’ll see you in Dodge City
and thank you properly.

377
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,180
You can thank me properly
by staying out of Dodge City.

378
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,480
More water!
More water!

379
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,830
...Boot Hill

380
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,460
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

381
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
Boot Hill

382
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,000
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

383
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,270
So cold

384
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,270
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

385
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,670
So still

386
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,680
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

387
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,510
Wyatt Earp, they say,
saved Doc Holliday

388
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:20,990
From old Boot Hill...

389
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,690
Boot Hill

390
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,820
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

391
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,130
Boot Hill

392
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,530
Over there, there's a chill,
there's a chill

393
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,790
So cold

394
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,960
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

395
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,330
So still

396
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,130
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

397
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,970
Wyatt roamed the West,
and though he fought the best

398
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,780
By nature he preferred it
nice and peaceful

399
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,680
Sort of slow

400
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,010
And sort of easy-go

401
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,110
But he was quick on the draw

402
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,680
And Wyatt's word was law

403
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,320
Was law, was law...

404
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,100
Whoa.

405
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,220
How about that?

406
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,020
A little out of place
for Dodge City,

407
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,190
wouldn't you say?

408
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,750
That's strictly
big-city stuff.

409
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,760
Looks like she's going
to stay a while.

410
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,820
Got a trunk.

411
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,370
I got to go on a posse.

412
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,430
That's what I came
to see you about.

413
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,030
Chief Dullknife is
on a rampage again.

414
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,840
I’m going to have
to borrow your deputies.

415
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,400
You're always short of men.

416
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,510
Who's the girl?

417
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,520
Yeah, who's the girl?

418
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,540
Girl? What girl?

419
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,010
Oh. I was too busy finding out

420
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,220
that Doc Holliday and his
lady friend have just checked in

421
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,280
at the Dodge House.

422
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,820
Doc Holliday?

423
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,830
I told him to keep out
of Dodge City.

424
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,830
I’d better get over there
before he unpacks.

425
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,490
You going to lend me
your deputies?

426
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,500
Well, all right,

427
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,160
but I have to keep
Charlie here with me.

428
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
You can have the
rest of the boys.

429
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,830
And don't forget to get back
before those cattle drives.

430
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,340
You know how business picks up
when the cowpokes hit town.

431
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,050
Mario, go on out
and get some fresh air.

432
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,550
The mayor's
welcoming committee, eh?

433
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,190
I thought I told you
to stay out of Dodge City.

434
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,820
I like a sharp razor,
don't you?

435
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,460
Care for a shave?

436
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,060
There's a stage for Abilene
in the morning.

437
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,870
I want you to be on it.

438
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,070
Can't.

439
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,800
The marshal of Abilene
sent me here.

440
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,280
As a matter of fact,

441
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,210
I wish someone would write
you fellas a new speech.

442
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,770
I’ve had the same one
in the last five towns.

443
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,810
All right, you'll stay
in your hotel room, then,

444
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,250
till day after tomorrow.

445
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,310
I’ll personally escort you
to the westbound train.

446
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,290
Wyatt, you've got
to face a hard fact.

447
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,760
I’m in a state of complete
financial collapse.

448
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,820
I don't even have
the price of a ticket.

449
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,800
Shanssey told me you had
quite a bankroll

450
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,820
back there in Griffin.

451
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,370
Shanssey ought to know.

452
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,530
He had $1 0,000 of mine
in his safe.

453
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,230
You know what that
son of a gun did?

454
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,600
You'll recall I had to leave
town rather hastily.

455
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,610
Those two horses in
back of the hotel

456
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,340
cost me $5,000 apiece.

457
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,850
Now, how about that?

458
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,010
Towel, please.

459
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,280
Oh, thank you.

460
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,710
Everyone puts such
an outlandish value

461
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,690
on my life.

462
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,990
Say, Wyatt...

463
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,330
how much do you earn?

464
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,460
About $1 00 a month
and two dollars an arrest?

465
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,690
You trying to bribe me?

466
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,700
Oh, no.

467
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,260
Not you.

468
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,530
I feel compelled to offer you
an honest business proposition.

469
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,570
That's not bad.

470
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,700
You got any money saved?

471
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,210
Some.

472
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,710
Going to buy a small ranch
or a country store someday, huh?

473
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,480
Well, I’ll make it easier
for you.

474
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,540
You stake me
to a thousand dollars

475
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,280
and I’ll split my winnings.

476
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,750
The cowboys are coming
and the stakes will be big.

477
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,280
Fifty-fifty, huh?

478
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,090
Now actually,
any number of people

479
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,720
would be glad to back me
for ten percent, but...

480
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,660
I like you, Wyatt Earp.

481
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,000
I like your cut.

482
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,930
Why so generous
with the split?

483
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,370
Look, a barber needs this.

484
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,100
You're a lawman,
you need a gun.

485
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,470
Money's just a tool
of my trade.

486
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,940
Of course, you will
guarantee you won't lose.

487
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,600
I never lose.

488
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,270
You see, poker's played
by desperate men

489
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,370
who cherish money.

490
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,180
I don't lose because
I have nothing to lose,

491
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,210
including my life.

492
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,280
Is it a deal?

493
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,480
Of all the low-down gall.

494
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,250
Ah, well...

495
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,260
You're just going
to have to stake me

496
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,560
to a railroad ticket.

497
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,430
Holliday, I’ve done

498
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,960
some foolish things
in my life.

499
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,060
I’m about to do another.

500
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,670
I’m going to let you
stay in town.

501
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,810
Why so generous?

502
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,820
Let's say I like your cut.

503
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,580
You can stay and you can play
on one condition:

504
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,640
No knives, no guns
and no killings.

505
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,020
No knives, no guns, no killings.

506
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,120
That's it.

507
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,820
You have my word
as a gentleman.

508
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,760
Just one more thing.

509
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,130
You ought to treat that woman
decent or leave her.

510
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,830
Kate?

511
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,170
Yes, poor old Kate.

512
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,330
She stands for everything I hate
in Doc Holliday.

513
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,710
Oh, leave two bits
for the barber, will you?

514
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,780
Well, I found out all
about your lady fair.

515
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,190
Hey, where'd you
get the new gun?

516
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,480
Buntline made it
for me special.

517
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,490
What lady fair?

518
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,390
It’s sure beautiful--

519
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,480
isn't that barrel too long?

520
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,650
No, good balance,
just right.

521
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,660
What's beautiful?

522
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,660
Hand-tooled, too, huh?

523
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,860
What are you talking about?

524
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,090
Well, that girl that came in

525
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,620
on the stage
day before yesterday.

526
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,190
Oh, yeah, I remember;
what about her?

527
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,070
Well, she's staying
over at Mrs. D's place.

528
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,570
They tell me
she's got a trunkful

529
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,600
of the most elegant clothes
you've ever seen.

530
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,770
Some of them dresses
clean from Paris, France.

531
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,710
She's five-foot six,

532
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,370
weighs 1 20 pounds,

533
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,380
red hair, green eyes...

534
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,640
What is she doing here?

535
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,670
Gambler.

536
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,240
Very funny.

537
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,290
Well, if you
think that's funny,

538
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,650
why don't you take
a little walk

539
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,420
over to the
Longbranch Saloon.

540
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,690
You'll die laughing.

541
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,330
Hello, Wyatt.

542
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,510
What's the trouble?

543
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,670
I think I’m going to have
to break up that game.

544
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,680
Can't do that, Wyatt.

545
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,240
There's no law against
women gambling.

546
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,480
I know, but every time
there's a woman at the tables,

547
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,850
there's trouble, you know that.

548
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,290
Sorry, game's over.

549
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,300
Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow.

550
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,960
Kelly, you're the mayor
of this town.

551
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,020
We agreed there'd be

552
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,590
no women gambling
on the north side.

553
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,460
Miss Denbow's marker
is respected

554
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,370
for $1 0,000 anywhere
in the West.

555
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,870
We all consider her
an exception.

556
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,740
Not in Dodge City,
she isn't.

557
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,830
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp.

558
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,500
Lawman, judge and jury.

559
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,670
That's right, Miss Gambler--
start with you

560
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,510
and we'll have every tramp
on the south side over here.

561
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,810
Who's a tramp?

562
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,580
Shut up and keep
out of this, cowboy.

563
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,250
You're talking to a lady!

564
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,420
It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.

565
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,220
You're in a saloon,
playing a man's game.

566
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,850
Why should you be
treated like a lady?

567
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,660
And you ain't no gentleman.

568
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,560
That's all for tonight,
Miss Denbow.

569
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,160
Take your hands off her.

570
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,530
Hold it, Charlie.

571
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,450
I’m tired of you
pushing people around.

572
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,450
Now, go for your gun.

573
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,850
I’m going to kill you!

574
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,970
I don't have a gun, cowboy.

575
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,180
I’m unarmed.

576
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,290
Stay where you are!

577
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,390
You're drunk.

578
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,990
You don't know
what you're doing.

579
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,770
Now, give me that gun before
you get into real trouble.

580
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,070
I don't stand
for nobody talking

581
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,700
like that to no lady.

582
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,310
You stand real still.

583
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,970
And just give me that gun.

584
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,710
I ain't no gunman.

585
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,640
I couldn't kill anybody.

586
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,670
I know that, cowboy.

587
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,080
You were just trying
to impress the lady.

588
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,240
Charlie--

589
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,950
take him down
and sober him up

590
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,390
and get him out of town.

591
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,830
You're under arrest.

592
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,120
For what, Mr. Earp?

593
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,030
You just saw it--
disturbing the peace.

594
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,120
Wait a minute, Wyatt.

595
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,650
It’s all right, Mayor Kelly.

596
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,960
The marshal's only
trying to save

597
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,970
the good name of Dodge City.

598
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,340
Besides, I might like
to see the inside of a jail.

599
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,810
Don't you think you better wait
for a few of your deputies?

600
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,940
I might be desperate.

601
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,230
I’ll let you go,
if you promise

602
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,000
to do your gambling
south of the deadline.

603
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,230
South of the deadline?

604
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,270
No, I think I’ll stay.

605
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,870
Perhaps the judge isn't as
righteous as the marshal.

606
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,410
Well, aren't you going
to open the door?

607
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,050
Oh, l, uh...

608
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,790
won't be needing these
while I’m here.

609
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,190
Why don't you buy
yourself a new halo?

610
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,790
The one you're wearing's
too tight.

611
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,740
Close the door, Marshal.

612
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,350
Locked her up?

613
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:58,220
That's right,
disturbing the peace.

614
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,850
I could get her out.

615
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,020
$500 says you can't.

616
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,860
Make it the $1 ,000
I owe you.

617
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,900
Double or nothing.

618
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,830
It’s a bet.

619
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,970
I’ll be back in 30 minutes.

620
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,360
Good evening, Charlie.

621
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,420
Oh, hiya, Doc.

622
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,530
Man, this 1 2 on and 1 2 off
is sure ruining my homework.

623
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,970
I spend half my life
on that dern paperwork.

624
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,980
Care for a nip?

625
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,410
Doc, you know why I don't
like drinking on duty.

626
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,550
What's the occasion?

627
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,550
I’d like to bail out
Miss Denbow.

628
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,380
Hit me.

629
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,310
I got 1 9.

630
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,350
Twenty.

631
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,820
Can't do it, Doc.

632
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,520
She's got to appear
in court tomorrow.

633
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,470
Think I’ll stand on these.

634
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,500
Twenty-one.

635
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,940
Oh, I’ll wait for Wyatt.

636
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,840
I sure hope Bat gets
back with our deputies

637
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,410
before them cowboys
hit town.

638
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,140
Blackjack.

639
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,480
I got one, too.

640
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,630
You know, Doc, if we
was playing for real,

641
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,100
I’d just be compelled
to have a look at that deck.

642
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,400
Oh, I’d be compelled
to ask you to try it.

643
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,060
Use mine, huh?

644
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,700
Good thing Wyatt
don't let us

645
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,040
go around drawing
these things.

646
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,100
Somebody might get hurt.

647
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,640
Well... I got
to go have a look

648
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,520
at the prisoners and horses.

649
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,180
Watch the office for me,
will you, Doc?

650
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,380
Sure thing, Charlie.

651
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,800
I never could get the hang
of these things.

652
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,570
What are you doing here?

653
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,540
Wyatt, I’d like to
bail out Miss Denbow.

654
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,270
She happens to be a lady.

655
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,940
No favors, Holliday.

656
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,080
Let's say you release her

657
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,590
in exchange for
some information.

658
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,710
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

659
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,660
Uh, suppose l
were to tell you

660
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,820
that Shanghai Pierce is
bringing his herd here.

661
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,630
Shanghai Pierce, huh?

662
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,860
I take it you've had
some run-ins with him.

663
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,500
I had to bat him over the head

664
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,230
once or twice, when he got drunk
and tried to shoot up Wichita.

665
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,040
Not a bad guy,
just forgot to grow up.

666
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,040
Well, he's aiming
to shoot up Dodge City,

667
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,910
and he's hired Ringo to make
sure you don't spoil his fun.

668
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,810
Oh, and what's more, he, uh...

669
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,820
He's put a price of $1 ,000
on your head, dead.

670
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,750
What else is new?

671
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,050
Well, l, I thought
it was kind of amusing,

672
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,560
a price on a lawman's head.

673
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,320
Look, Holliday,

674
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,520
as long as I’m the law here,

675
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,720
not one of those cowpokes

676
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,000
is going to cross
that deadline with a gun.

677
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,560
I don't care if his name
is Shanghai Pierce.

678
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,730
Well spoken.

679
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,640
I’ll repeat those words
at your funeral.

680
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
How about releasing
Miss Denbow?

681
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,340
Nothing doing.

682
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,010
Look, you made a deal.

683
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,140
You made the deal.

684
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,740
I didn't agree to
a thing, remember?

685
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,650
Charlie, you're working
for a crook.

686
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,660
Oh, yeah?

687
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,850
Go on home, Charlie,
and turn in.

688
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,990
I’ll finish these reports.

689
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,690
Thanks.
Everything's quiet.

690
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,700
Good night.

691
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,960
G'night.

692
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,060
Wyatt, you ought
to turn her loose.

693
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,370
She's got no business
behind bars.

694
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,840
I think Charlie's right.

695
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,340
Let her out.

696
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,210
Conscience?

697
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,450
Maybe I like her.

698
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,580
Tell Kelly

699
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,150
she's to play
in the side room.

700
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,390
I don't want her gambling
on the main floor.

701
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,920
Good evening, Miss Denbow.

702
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,950
Good evening.

703
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,330
Come on, Laura, we've got
business to take care of.

704
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,360
Thank you.

705
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,530
Marshal.

706
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,040
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

707
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,650
Good evening, Miss Denbow.

708
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,020
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

709
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,790
Pair of deuces.

710
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,460
I’ll check to the lady.

711
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,470
Fifty.

712
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,470
I’ll stay.

713
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,490
Too steep for me.

714
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,530
I’m in.

715
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,160
$50, and I’ll
make it $50 more.

716
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,170
I’m in for the $50.

717
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,180
Deal.

718
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,180
Doc...

719
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,180
Queen of clubs.

720
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,180
It’s almost morning.

721
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,270
Jack of spades, three tens.

722
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,840
You didn't answer me.

723
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,870
I’ll make it $1 00.

724
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Doc!

725
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,050
Go buy yourself a drink.

726
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,420
And I’ll raise you $1 00.

727
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,440
Too much for me.

728
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,480
$200 to me.

729
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,490
I’ll call you.

730
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,150
I’ll go along with the lady.

731
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,090
Four deuces.

732
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,490
Gentlemen, we've been
out-classed.

733
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,830
Thank you, gentlemen.

734
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,060
I think I’ll call it a night.

735
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,190
Will you cash me in, Frank?

736
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,200
Good night.

737
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,890
Good night, Mayor Kelly.

738
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,900
May I see you home?

739
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,900
No, thank you, Doc.

740
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,900
Good night.

741
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,100
Good night.

742
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,570
How about a little draw, boys?

743
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,630
All right.

744
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,300
I’ll get my ante in there.

745
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,330
Good night.

746
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,820
Johnny, I need Luke Short.

747
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,130
Richie Bell
and two of his boys

748
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,330
held up the bank at Salina.

749
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,700
They killed the cashier.

750
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,760
They're heading this way.

751
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,000
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt.

752
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,670
I’m sorry.

753
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,110
How soon do you
have to pull out?

754
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,140
Right away, if I expect
to pick up their trail.

755
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,810
Doggone it, Luke's
the only one in town

756
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,820
who can handle a gun.

757
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,880
What about Charlie Bassett?

758
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,440
Somebody's got to mind the town.

759
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,650
Want a gunhand?

760
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,380
You?

761
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,180
I do handle one pretty well.

762
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,250
The only trouble is

763
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,320
those best able
to testify to my aim

764
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,850
aren't around for comment.

765
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,730
I’ll take care of it alone.

766
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,030
Suit yourself.

767
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,670
Hold up your right hand.

768
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,710
Do you solemnly
swear to uphold...

769
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,720
Oh, this is ridiculous!

770
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,720
You're deputized.

771
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,240
Grab some gear,
I’ll get the horses.

772
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,420
Now, wait a minute, don't
I get to wear a tin star?

773
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,650
Not on your life!

774
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,210
Medicine.

775
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,760
For a smart gambler, you
sure play sucker odds.

776
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,050
You're going to be dead
inside of a year.

777
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,360
What do you know
about odds, preacher?

778
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,330
This kind of cough
doesn't go away.

779
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,350
Why don't you get out of
those stinking saloons?

780
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,990
Pack up and go live
in the mountains.

781
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,590
Not me.

782
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,800
You're just ornery enough
to live to a ripe old age.

783
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,430
No, I’m not going to let it
drain me out slow.

784
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,810
Sure.

785
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,870
Play it hard and fast.

786
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,880
Listen, Wyatt,

787
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,470
the only thing
I’m really scared of

788
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,540
is dying in bed.

789
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,880
I don't want to go
little by little.

790
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,880
Someday, somebody's
got to out-shoot me,

791
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,610
and it'll be
over with real quick.

792
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,430
Earp, I didn't come along
to hear you preach a sermon.

793
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,860
You know, I’ve been wondering
about that.

794
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,760
Why did you come?

795
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,630
Well, if I stick around
long enough,

796
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,540
sooner or later you've gotto put your head in a noose.

797
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,700
I’m going to bail you out.

798
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,840
I’ve only got one debt
in this world,

799
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,430
and I don't like
owing it to you.

800
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,470
You don't owe me a thing.

801
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,040
I’ve never needed
anybody in my life,

802
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,550
and I sure don't need
Doc Holliday.

803
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,450
You're pretty positive
about that.

804
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,680
As far as I’m concerned,

805
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,580
you can get on your horse
and keep riding.

806
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,610
No, thanks.

807
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,720
I think I’ll stay.

808
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,770
You know, Wyatt, you and l
are pretty much alike, actually.

809
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,390
Both of us live with a gun.

810
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,460
The only differenceis that badge.

811
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,630
What's the matter,
preacher?

812
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,070
Don't you like
being preached at?

813
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,540
Shut up and go to sleep.

814
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,220
Richie Bell won't
be robbing any more banks.

815
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,520
I thought you were asleep.

816
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
No, it figured.

817
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,990
Let's head back to Dodge.

818
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,360
I want to get in a bed.

819
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,520
What for?

820
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,760
They're not going any place.

821
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,790
Neither are we.

822
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,060
I’m getting some sleep.

823
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,240
Get out of those
stinking saloons.

824
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,970
Pack up, live
in the mountains.

825
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,190
Charlie.

826
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,450
Hi.

827
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,690
I’ll go in and fix up
a coroner's report.

828
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,350
Thanks a lot, Doc.

829
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,420
You and I are even.

830
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,660
Not yet.

831
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,230
Not until the debt's
paid in full, Marshal.

832
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,040
I hear you did some
pretty fancy shooting, Doc.

833
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,540
Well, it's...

834
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,100
all in a day's work
for a deputy.

835
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,480
You all right?

836
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,620
Find Kate and tell her

837
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,560
to come up to the hotel
right away, will you?

838
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,490
Kate hasn't been around
for a while, Doc.

839
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,150
What do you mean?

840
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,630
I mean nobody's seen her
on this side of town

841
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,460
since you rode out.

842
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,670
Should I get a doctor?

843
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,500
Good morning, Laura.

844
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,700
Well, I never thought
I’d be glad to see you.

845
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,800
Something wrong?

846
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,470
My horse has gone lame.

847
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,500
Right forefoot.

848
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,180
Hoof's split.

849
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,520
Better not ride him in.

850
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,820
Aw...

851
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,950
Leave him here,
he won't go far.

852
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,690
I’ll send
the blacksmith out.

853
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,320
Nice you
happened along.

854
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,790
I didn't happen along.

855
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,400
I know you ride out
this way every day.

856
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,070
Come on, I’ll give you
a ride into town.

857
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,680
Unless you'd rather
walk six miles.

858
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,290
Better hold on tight.

859
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,890
Tighter.

860
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,770
Doc, what are you doing up
this time of day?

861
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,270
It’s only 3:00.

862
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,970
I’m on a health bender.

863
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,600
Up before noon,
take a 20-yard walk.

864
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,080
What's the action here?

865
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,450
Uh, picking up the hardware
as soon as the cowboys hit town.

866
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,160
Sure don't look like
Bat's going to get back

867
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,750
with our deputies soon enough.

868
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,950
Where's Kate?

869
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,570
Where is she, Charlie?

870
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,860
Well, it's...
kind of touchy, Doc.

871
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,170
l... l...

872
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,300
Yes?

873
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,970
You promised Wyatt

874
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,740
there wouldn't be
any gunplay, Doc.

875
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,750
Now, you can't...

876
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,180
Where is she, Charlie?

877
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,590
Wally's Hotel.

878
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,060
Ringo blew into town, and
Kate's taken up with him.

879
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,460
Sure is a lot of beef
coming in here.

880
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,760
This is just the beginning.

881
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,830
Wait till the...

882
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,570
Look, Doc,
a gunfight right now

883
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,540
could cause Wyatt
a lot of trouble.

884
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,240
A lot of trouble.

885
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,740
Sure is a mess
of cattle here.

886
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,550
Get out and stay out,
you no-good tramp!

887
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,750
And don't come back!

888
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,310
Widened my mind...

889
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:08,680
My mind is to marry, love,
and leave you behind.

890
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,460
So you got homesick.

891
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,100
Well, well.

892
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,500
lf it ain't
the little deputy.

893
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,870
You've been gone
for three days.

894
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,770
I didn't think you'd notice.

895
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,740
You've been gallivanting
all over the country

896
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,800
with Mr. Virtue.

897
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,310
I was sick, Kate.

898
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,710
I needed you.

899
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,580
Why don't you put a rope
around my neck and...

900
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,480
and pull on it
when you want me?

901
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,510
Can't stay away.

902
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,460
Just can't stay away,
can you?

903
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,960
Oh, leave me alone, Doc.

904
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,050
Always got to crawl
back to your gutter.

905
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,150
Maybe I wouldn't

906
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,320
if you ever noticed
I was alive!

907
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,890
What difference
does it make to you

908
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,420
where I go or who
I take up with?

909
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,800
Shut up!

910
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,900
Get your things together,
you're leaving.

911
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,340
She's staying here.

912
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,580
Keep out of this, Ringo.

913
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,580
You got no right to
come busting in here.

914
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,950
I’m talking to Kate.

915
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,970
Take a walk.

916
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,480
Anything you got to say,
you can say in front of him.

917
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,490
You slut.

918
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,160
Wait a minute, Holliday.

919
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,860
You don't talk to
my woman like that.

920
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,500
''Your woman.''

921
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,090
Anybody's woman.

922
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,200
I’m going to
blast you apart.

923
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,330
I don't have a gun, Ringo.

924
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,110
You got one now.

925
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,790
Reach.

926
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,030
I’m not fighting.

927
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,590
He won't fight.

928
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,970
He promised Wyatt Earp

929
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,410
he'd be a good little boy.

930
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,380
I heard you made
your reputation

931
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,000
against a bunch of drunks.

932
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,400
Go on, reach.

933
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,850
I’m not fighting.

934
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,390
Well, have a drink, then.

935
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,730
Oh, Doc.

936
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,830
It was a lovely dance.

937
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,760
I’m sorry I have
to leave so soon.

938
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,630
You're breaking
a lot of hearts.

939
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,800
Good night, Mayor Kelly.

940
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,030
Good night, Miss Denbow.

941
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,410
May I take you somewhere?

942
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,110
No, thank you,
it's just a short way.

943
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,510
It’s early, and I have
to ride up to the bluffs.

944
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,100
Oh, it is lovely here.

945
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,800
I’m glad I came.

946
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,390
You've lost your poker face.

947
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,290
You look like
a scared little girl.

948
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,160
I’m not scared.

949
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,230
And I’m certainly
not a little girl.

950
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,490
Why did you come
out here with me?

951
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,820
I wish I could answer that.

952
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,630
I don't know.

953
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,560
I’ll tell you why you came.

954
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,100
Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo?

955
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,700
Yeah.

956
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,240
This ought to learn 'em
once and for all

957
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,480
who owns the cow towns!

958
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,680
Yeah.

959
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,290
Shanghai Pierce is in town.

960
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,950
His men are hoo-hawing
Front Street.

961
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:50,050
Now, see if you find Wyatt,
quick as you can

962
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,150
and get some help.

963
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,820
I’ll try to hold them off.

964
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,890
I don't want anybody
out there on the streets!

965
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,830
Pierce, call off your men
before somebody gets hurt.

966
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,810
Tell your boss I’m waiting
for his personal invitation.

967
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,510
You're under arrest, Pierce.

968
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,250
You hear that, Ringo?

969
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,520
I’m under arrest.

970
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:17,610
I heard.

971
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,860
Sure are noisy.

972
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,970
Sure are.

973
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,850
Let's quit.

974
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,400
I want to get out of here.

975
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,850
You just keep dealing.

976
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,480
I’m not breaking this run.

977
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,510
Hit me.

978
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,580
Doc, please.

979
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,890
Deal.

980
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,960
Well... what have we here?

981
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,970
A dance.

982
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,870
Now, ain't that nice?

983
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,600
You folks going
to invite us in?

984
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,730
Ain't very hospitable,
are they, Boss?

985
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,400
You better get that scum
of yours south of the deadline.

986
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,170
You hear that, boys?

987
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,310
These are respectable folks.

988
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,510
They're good enough
to take our money.

989
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,990
I say my men are good enough
to dance with your women.

990
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,570
My boys want to dance!

991
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,640
Piano player, make some music!

992
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,990
Make it lively!

993
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,270
Hello, Shanghai.

994
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,970
Well...

995
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,850
Now my day is complete.

996
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,320
You and me are going to settle

997
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,150
for this scar
you gave me in Wichita.

998
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,850
Unbuckle your guns, boys,

999
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,650
and come on down
to the calaboose with me.

1000
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,590
You better start praying, Earp.

1001
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,990
You pulled your last bluff.

1002
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,160
Start thinking
straight, Shanghai,

1003
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,460
before you get
into too much trouble

1004
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,590
and you can't get out of it.

1005
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,120
Let's work him over, Boss.

1006
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,160
That's a real good idea.

1007
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,760
Maybe your friends
would like to see

1008
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,030
how tough you really are.

1009
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,060
I’d like to see you
do a dance, Marshal.

1010
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,040
That's mighty
brave talk, Shanghai,

1011
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,910
with 20 men behind you.

1012
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,740
Let's you and me step out
into the street, alone.

1013
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,880
Oh, no, you don't sucker me
into that!

1014
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,050
Can't bluff
your way out, huh?

1015
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,520
All right, boys,
take this skunk.

1016
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,390
You gentlemen
made such a racket,

1017
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,260
Frank Loving
was too scared to deal.

1018
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,790
You busted my winning streak.

1019
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,630
Fun's over, boys.

1020
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:21,800
Unbuckle 'em.

1021
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,310
Let's shoot it out.

1022
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,810
All right, Shanghai?

1023
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,740
Go ahead, draw, all of you.

1024
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,040
But you get it first, Shanghai.

1025
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,570
And you second, Ringo.

1026
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,410
Well, call the play.

1027
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:36,650
I’ll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.

1028
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,160
One.

1029
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,220
Two.

1030
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,630
Three.

1031
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,990
Four.

1032
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,900
We had enough fun, boys.

1033
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,900
Unbuckle 'em.

1034
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,800
Harry, Jackson,
get the hardware.

1035
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,670
Get moving.

1036
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,730
Doc!

1037
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,610
Anybody else
want to try their luck?

1038
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,780
Get moving.

1039
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,050
Come on, keep moving!

1040
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,060
All of you!

1041
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,150
All right, Doc, we
ain't finished yet.

1042
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,850
You would have been,

1043
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,220
but I feel in
a charitable mood tonight.

1044
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,440
Keep moving, come on.

1045
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,340
Kelly, take them down

1046
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,740
and lock them up
for the night.

1047
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,410
You heard the marshal.

1048
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,210
Come on,
let's get moving!

1049
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:43,820
I don't suppose
you want my thanks.

1050
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:46,410
Let's just say
my account is paid in full.

1051
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,190
And don't take it
personal, Marshal.

1052
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,000
Mornin', Doc.

1053
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,450
Good morning.

1054
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,950
Just thought
you'd like to know,

1055
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:21,420
there's going to be

1056
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:23,190
one less lawman
in the territory.

1057
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,750
That's always
good news to me.

1058
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,320
I’m heading
for California,

1059
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,800
buying a ranch,
taking your good advice--

1060
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,660
getting out
while there's time.

1061
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,790
Smart man.

1062
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,800
Laura's coming with me.

1063
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,970
We're getting married
in a few days.

1064
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,700
We'd like you to come
to the wedding, Doc,

1065
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,140
if it doesn't interfere
with your poker.

1066
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,440
I’m not good at weddings,
only funerals.

1067
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,070
Deal me out.

1068
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,420
Wyatt...

1069
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,080
You know,
she's a real lady.

1070
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,320
I wish you both
a lot of happiness.

1071
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,190
Ah, you're lucky

1072
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,360
to be getting out
of this country.

1073
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,660
Why don't you try your luck?

1074
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,630
Mmm...

1075
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,500
So long, Doc.

1076
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,790
Take me back, Doc?

1077
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,490
Please?

1078
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,760
Give me another chance.

1079
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,140
Please, take me back.

1080
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,540
I’ll do anything you say.

1081
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,680
I don’t care how you treat me.

1082
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:57,750
Doc, I’m sorry for what I done.

1083
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,550
It’s not your fault, Kate.

1084
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,350
It’s not my fault.

1085
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,090
It’s not anybody's fault.

1086
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,150
It’s just the way
the cards fall.

1087
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:12,600
Never gave you
much of a chance, did l?

1088
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,030
Well, maybe
it could have been different

1089
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,700
if I was right to you, but...

1090
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,730
It ain't too late, Doc.

1091
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,540
I’ll be good to you, I promise.

1092
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,280
It’s too late for both of us.

1093
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,150
Do something better
for yourself

1094
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,950
while you've still
got the chance.

1095
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:45,570
Don't let me go, Doc.

1096
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,430
Don't let me go back there.

1097
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,060
Leave me alone,

1098
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,700
just... leave me alone.

1099
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,340
I’ll see you dead.

1100
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,400
Hiya, Wyatt.

1101
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,600
Charlie.

1102
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,770
You got a letter

1103
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,070
from the Attorney General.

1104
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,130
What's he got to say?

1105
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,520
He says he can get you an
appointment as U.S. marshal

1106
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,020
anytime you want it.

1107
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,650
''Wyatt Earp, United
States marshal''--

1108
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,520
that's all I need.

1109
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,690
These are all dead, Charlie.

1110
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:47,090
Oh, before I forget...

1111
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,430
This is yours now.

1112
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,130
I’m through as
a lawman for good.

1113
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,600
Oh, you got
a telegram, too.

1114
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,470
Read it.

1115
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,390
Virgil's my brother.

1116
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,530
He's in trouble, he needs me.

1117
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,370
Try to understand, Laura.

1118
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,200
I understand I was foolish
to fall in love.

1119
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,640
Oh, if only I could...

1120
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,970
Wyatt, when
I first met you,

1121
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,410
I told you
I wouldn't follow you

1122
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,500
from town to town,
sitting in the darkness,

1123
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,310
waiting for someone to bring
the news you've been killed;

1124
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,680
I won't live that way.

1125
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,350
We're not going to
start a life together

1126
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,350
with a gun in your hand.

1127
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,360
I swear to you, Laura,

1128
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:47,550
I’m through after Tombstone.

1129
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,920
You'll never be through.

1130
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,390
Your reputation will follow you
wherever you are.

1131
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,520
Laura, he's my brother...

1132
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,820
And I’m to be your wife.

1133
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,520
Don't ask me
to let him down.

1134
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,360
Don't let me down.

1135
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,270
I’d give up anything,
I’d go anywhere for you.

1136
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,430
I’ll work beside you
in the fields.

1137
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:04,870
But you've got
to meet me halfway.

1138
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:26,190
I must go to Tombstone.

1139
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:30,390
All right, go,
clean up Tombstone.

1140
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:33,800
There's a hundred more
Tombstones on the frontier,

1141
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,740
all waiting for
the great Wyatt Earp.

1142
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,800
Go on, clean them all up.

1143
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,470
Go on!

1144
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,540
I love you, Laura.

1145
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,610
I love you, Wyatt.

1146
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:30,650
Ride on... ride on...

1147
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:35,760
To hell... and gone...

1148
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,390
Wyatt's heart was sad;
he'd give all he had

1149
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:45,070
To stay... stay on...

1150
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:50,070
Wyatt's lady fair,
he left her crying there

1151
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:55,520
He broke his vow
and rode away to Tombstone.

1152
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,770
Good afternoon, Marshal.

1153
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,060
Out for a little ride?

1154
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,930
About 700-miles-worth:
Tombstone.

1155
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:16,530
Tombstone, huh?

1156
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:18,270
I was headin'
that way myself.

1157
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,140
Understand the climate
down there

1158
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,700
may be better for my cough.

1159
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,300
Since when have you
gotten interested

1160
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:24,680
in your health?

1161
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,380
Well, it's really
a matter of finances;

1162
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,780
the deck's gone cold here,
nobody'll give me any play.

1163
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,840
Mind if I ride along?

1164
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,950
It’s a free country,
hop on.

1165
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,010
Where's your gear?

1166
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,030
Boot Hill

1167
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,030
On a hill, on a hill

1168
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,330
Boot Hill

1169
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:44,800
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

1170
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,060
So cold

1171
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,160
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

1172
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,360
So still

1173
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,890
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

1174
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:53,640
Will the Doc and his friend,
will both of them end

1175
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,880
In the graveyard
that's known as Boot Hill?

1176
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,960
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1177
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,070
Well, thanks
for the ride.

1178
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,040
Sell my horse,
and get a good price.

1179
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,740
Doc.

1180
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,110
I know, no knives,
no guns, no killing, huh?

1181
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,420
Man, that's good.

1182
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,330
I just about forgot what
a home-cooked meal tastes like.

1183
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,700
Betty, I’m going to steal you
away from Virgil.

1184
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,930
By golly, Wyatt,

1185
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,800
you're going to be
the only single one left.

1186
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,390
I got a family going
in Deadwood.

1187
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,130
Even little Jimmy here
is tying the knot

1188
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:31,700
when he gets back
to California.

1189
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,770
What do you mean,
''Little Jimmy''?

1190
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,330
I’ll be 1 9 next month.

1191
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,640
Nineteen.

1192
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,350
Say, when are you going
to get hitched, Wyatt?

1193
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:47,410
Cigar?

1194
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,250
There's the signal

1195
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:51,690
for women and children
to leave the room.

1196
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:53,990
Come on, Tommy,
it's your bedtime now.

1197
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,590
Oh, Mom, do I have to?

1198
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:56,690
Yes, you do.

1199
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,390
Your uncles
will all be here tomorrow.

1200
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,730
Good night, Uncle Wyatt.

1201
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:00,740
Good night, Tommy.

1202
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:01,930
Good night, Uncle Morgan.

1203
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,230
Good night, son.

1204
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,400
Good night, Uncle James.

1205
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,570
Good night, Tommy.

1206
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,700
Good night, Daddy.

1207
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:07,730
Good night, son.

1208
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:13,180
It’s nice to have you here.

1209
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,780
I only wish it were under
happier circumstances.

1210
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,120
She seems pretty upset.

1211
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,220
Well, she's been
asking me for a year

1212
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:31,430
to quit marshaling.

1213
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,160
You know how women are.

1214
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,840
All right, now let's
get down to business.

1215
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:40,430
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.

1216
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,030
Now, Wyatt,
you know Ike Clanton.

1217
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,670
He has a ranch outside
city limits.

1218
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,980
Yes, I know.

1219
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:47,540
He's organized the toughest
bunch of gunslingers

1220
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,910
you ever laid eyes on,

1221
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,580
and he owns the county sheriff.

1222
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,590
Who is he?

1223
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,710
Cotton Wilson.

1224
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,880
Cotton Wilson.

1225
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,650
So Ike paid off on his deed.

1226
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:59,090
Clanton's been rustling
Mexican cattle by the thousands.

1227
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,460
And he has to move them,

1228
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,900
but he can only ship them out
of Tombstone,

1229
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:05,590
and he can't do that
while we control the city.

1230
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:07,070
That's about it.

1231
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,260
He's organized
and he's mean.

1232
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,270
We can't keep him out
of Tombstone forever.

1233
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,930
What about the people
of Tombstone?

1234
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,700
John Clum,
editor of the ''Epitaph,''

1235
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,210
and some of the leading citizens
will back us

1236
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,370
if they know
you're calling the shots.

1237
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,410
We're all agreed, Wyatt,
you should run the show.

1238
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,280
There's only one thing
that bothers me

1239
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:34,260
and I’m going to
speak my piece now.

1240
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,920
There's going to be
a lot of bad talk

1241
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:39,430
about you riding
with Doc Holliday.

1242
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,300
What about
Holliday?

1243
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,400
He's the worst killer
on the frontier,

1244
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,630
that's what about him.

1245
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:49,270
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.

1246
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,340
Holliday saved my life
in Dodge City;

1247
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,440
I don’t forget that.

1248
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,640
What's more,
he's a man of his word.

1249
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,620
As long as he plays
his cards straight

1250
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:57,910
and keeps out of killings,

1251
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,920
we got no right to run him
out of town.

1252
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,550
I didn't know you
two were a team.

1253
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,580
We're not.

1254
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,220
It’s just a case
of square deal.

1255
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,250
Holliday stays.

1256
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,990
All right, Wyatt,
he's your responsibility.

1257
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,190
That suits me fine.

1258
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,560
Now, do we have a map
of the county here?

1259
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,540
Now, the first thing
we got to do

1260
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,940
is let the Clantons know
that the city is closed to them.

1261
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,030
Then we got to control
the county.

1262
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,410
Now, that's important.

1263
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,170
I’m going to get a letter off
to a man tonight

1264
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:24,940
who'll take care of that
little matter for us.

1265
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,500
Now, show me where
the Clanton ranch is.

1266
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:27,540
Here.

1267
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:41,050
Hello, Cotton, I’ve
been expecting you.

1268
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,190
You're looking fine.

1269
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,860
Real prosperous.

1270
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,330
Oh, I ain't complaining.

1271
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:46,930
What's on your mind?

1272
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:49,730
Wyatt, Ike wants
to make you a deal.

1273
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,030
He promises no trouble

1274
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,440
if you'll let him ship
his cattle out of Tombstone.

1275
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,030
Well, that's mighty
nice of Ike.

1276
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,170
Ike is a nice fella.

1277
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,180
He's got a fortune
tied up in cattle

1278
01:15:58,210 --> 01:15:59,440
out there at the ranch,

1279
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,070
and he's going
to move them.

1280
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,110
Oh, he is, huh?

1281
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:13,160
There's $20,000
in it for you-- cash.

1282
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,960
$20,000.

1283
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,730
The wages of sin are rising.

1284
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:22,100
$20,000 against
a six-foot hole in Boot Hill,

1285
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,540
or a $20-a-month pension

1286
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:25,840
if you live long enough
to collect it.

1287
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,280
I’ve thought
about those things.

1288
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,820
You know, Cotton,

1289
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,980
this is a nice little town.

1290
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,620
A good place to set awhile.

1291
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,030
I might even run for county
sheriff in a couple of months.

1292
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,400
That don't scare me at all.

1293
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,960
I got mine.

1294
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,330
I got a ranch now
and $25,000 in the bank.

1295
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:55,630
And you know something?

1296
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:57,800
It don't bother my sleep,
not one bit.

1297
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,270
It would mine, though.

1298
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,010
Why don't you get off
that pulpit, Wyatt?

1299
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,540
Ellsworth, Wichita,
Dodge City,

1300
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,010
and what have they got you
but a life full of misery

1301
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,540
and a woman who
walked out on you

1302
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,050
and the friendship
of a killer.

1303
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,080
Take this message back
to your boss.

1304
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,030
So that's the way
he wants it, huh?

1305
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:32,970
He aims to pull the town
out from under you, Ike.

1306
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:43,810
I immediately raised my hat

1307
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:47,380
And finally she remarked:

1308
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:50,820
I'll never shall forget

1309
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:54,960
That lovely afternoon''

1310
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,590
I met her at the fountain
in the park.

1311
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:05,570
A long time, Ike.

1312
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:06,700
Too long.

1313
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,040
Hello, Ringo.

1314
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,770
Still renting your gun
to the highest bidder?

1315
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,510
Ain't you a little young
to be packing a gun, son?

1316
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,450
Why don't you try me?

1317
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,050
Going someplace?

1318
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,890
We're taking in
the show, Marshal.

1319
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,160
Any objections?

1320
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,390
No, as soon as you check in
your side arms.

1321
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,760
Why don't you check it in
for me, Marshal?

1322
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:34,760
Stop!

1323
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,400
You boys know my brothers.

1324
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,270
Meet John Clum,
head of the Citizens' Committee.

1325
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:43,540
You're a marked man, Wyatt.

1326
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,950
There's no place in
this town for you, Ike.

1327
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,410
The next time
you ride in armed,

1328
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,640
you ride out feet first.

1329
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,610
Now get moving.

1330
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,200
Here comes trouble.

1331
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,300
Who is she?

1332
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,400
She's Kate Fisher.

1333
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:48,240
She just couldn't stay away.

1334
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,180
Four blues.

1335
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:59,310
Call them, you suckers.

1336
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,760
Barkeep, some whiskey
down here.

1337
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,020
Leave the bottle.

1338
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,360
Two pairs.

1339
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,990
Aces up.

1340
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,120
Hey, Doc, what have you got?

1341
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,390
Three tres.

1342
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,060
Nice town, huh, Kate?

1343
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:18,410
Well, well, well.

1344
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,370
If it ain't the little deputy.

1345
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,040
Doc, you deal.

1346
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,850
Ain't you gonna say hello
to an old friend?

1347
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,410
Draw.

1348
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,760
Give me some crème de menthe.

1349
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,560
Hey, little deputy...

1350
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,800
would you like to have
another drink with me?

1351
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:52,230
You're drunk,
Ringo.

1352
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:54,740
It’s the way you made
your reputation, wasn't it...

1353
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,440
against drunks?

1354
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,680
Get your gun.

1355
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,150
I’ll meet you
in the street

1356
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:04,170
in five minutes.

1357
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,980
I’ll be there.

1358
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,330
I said I’d see you dead.

1359
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,890
What kind of a sucker play
is this?

1360
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,110
It’s all Clanton needs
to start a war.

1361
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,590
Look, I’ve had it
up to here.

1362
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,150
If you want to play patty-cake
with him, go ahead.

1363
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:45,390
Give me your gun, Doc.

1364
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:47,120
You've got no right packing it.

1365
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,470
Now, you can...

1366
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:58,470
you can thank God
you're Wyatt Earp's brother.

1367
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:01,910
Holliday, if you think
anything about Wyatt,

1368
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,780
you'll get out of here.

1369
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:05,300
Having a killer like you around

1370
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,410
is the worst thing
that can happen to him.

1371
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,460
I hear you're
leaving Tombstone.

1372
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:00,700
You hear good.

1373
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,730
I’m taking
the stage tomorrow.

1374
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,670
I kind of thought
this climate

1375
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:09,840
was good for your cough.

1376
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,110
Listen, preacher,

1377
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:14,670
being here has caused me
a lot of embarrassment.

1378
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,310
Some people are even
taking me as a lawman.

1379
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,090
You're not leaving
on my account?

1380
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,420
Your account?

1381
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,690
You've got nothing to do
with my leaving.

1382
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,710
Good luck, Doc.

1383
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,050
Too bad we won't be in
on the finish together.

1384
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,360
Hi, Wyatt.

1385
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,600
Here's that letter
you've been waiting for.

1386
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:24,840
Who do we got here?

1387
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,410
Young Clanton
passed out drunk

1388
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,510
at the Alhambra.

1389
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,220
Throw him in the tank
and let him sleep it off.

1390
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,780
Hold it a minute.

1391
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,920
John, how long
is it going to take you

1392
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,430
to get those men
you promised me?

1393
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:37,930
Anytime you say.

1394
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:40,560
I think I’ll take a little trip
out to the Clanton ranch.

1395
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,590
Are you crazy?!

1396
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,730
I don’t think so.

1397
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:43,930
Well, take your gun.

1398
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:45,800
This is all the ammunition
I’ll need.

1399
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:53,540
If I’m not back
in a couple of hours, Virg,

1400
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:56,550
have Clum's Citizens' Committee
drag my carcass out.

1401
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,130
Whoa, whoa.

1402
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,990
Billy!

1403
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,390
He's all right, ma'am,

1404
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,190
just got himself
a little liquored up.

1405
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,420
All right, on your feet.

1406
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:20,000
Billy! You get in the house.

1407
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:41,150
I don’t know what I’m going
to do with that boy.

1408
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:42,660
Way he's going now,

1409
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:44,750
he's going to end up
like his father,

1410
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,490
shot down
for stealing cattle.

1411
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,660
You think
you're pretty tough,

1412
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,230
don't you, son?

1413
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:55,830
I never saw a gunslinger yet

1414
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:58,670
so tough he lived to celebrate
his 35th birthday.

1415
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,640
I learned one rule
about gunslingers:

1416
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,110
There's always a man

1417
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,840
faster on the draw
than you are,

1418
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,580
and the more you use a gun

1419
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,850
the sooner you're going
to run into that man.

1420
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:17,620
You think I don't know
what's inside of you.

1421
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,790
I had a couple
of big brothers.

1422
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:23,530
They fought in the Civil War
and I was too young to go.

1423
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,400
I tried to live up
to them the same way

1424
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,590
you're trying to live up
to Ike and Finn.

1425
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,700
You know about that, huh?

1426
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,680
You can bet I know about that.

1427
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:38,700
It’s not that I want
to be a gunfighter, exactly.

1428
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,880
It’s just... I don't know,
sometimes I get lonely.

1429
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,420
All gunfighters are lonely.

1430
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,790
They live in fear.

1431
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:52,950
They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.

1432
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:55,260
You know, I never
thought about it like that.

1433
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,160
Well, think about
it, think about it.

1434
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,360
Billy, listen to the marshal.

1435
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,070
I won't do it no more, Ma.

1436
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,540
Oh, Billy...

1437
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,660
What are you doin' here?

1438
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:40,640
Brought your kid
brother home, drunk.

1439
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,130
You should be proud,
real proud.

1440
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:46,770
You'd better get ridin'.

1441
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:54,220
I wouldn't do that, Ike.

1442
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,960
Some of my friends in Tombstone

1443
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:58,820
might begin to worry
if I’m not back soon.

1444
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,790
That don't cut
no ice with me, Wyatt.

1445
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:02,920
You're out of your territory
this time.

1446
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,490
Am l?

1447
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,100
My appointment,
United States marshal.

1448
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,380
Sorry to
disappoint you.

1449
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:24,610
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt,

1450
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,850
I’m not lookin' for a fight,

1451
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,250
but you got
to stop pushin' me.

1452
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:29,190
Now, why don't we sit down
and talk it over?

1453
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,890
I’ll make you
any kind of deal you ask.

1454
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,360
The only deal I want

1455
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:33,860
is for you to run
that stolen herd

1456
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,330
back to Mexico.

1457
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,590
Hyah!

1458
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,550
Did you see the judge?

1459
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:56,950
I seen him.

1460
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:58,420
Well?

1461
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:00,420
There's no legal way
you can keep

1462
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,950
a United States marshal
out of the county.

1463
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:05,790
Judge was packin' up
to leave when I got there.

1464
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:09,420
I think it's about time
we all pack up and leave, Ike.

1465
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:10,430
Shut up, Frank.

1466
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,060
Only one thing we can do.

1467
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,630
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.

1468
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:19,400
You're makin' sense now, Ike.

1469
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,380
All right... we got no choice.

1470
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:24,040
We'll ambush him tonight.

1471
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,570
Ain't you forgettin'
about the rest of the Earps?

1472
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:28,550
Now, look,
we can handle the Earps

1473
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,450
if we make this
a personal fight.

1474
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,990
What if they bring in Clum?!

1475
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:33,920
They won't, they're too proud.

1476
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,750
They're going to come to us
the way we want.

1477
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:42,820
It’s a law-- bigger than any law
on the books-- family pride.

1478
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,800
We'll get that Wyatt
when he makes his late round.

1479
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,730
Don't make no difference to me.

1480
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,410
Tired?

1481
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:09,510
Yeah, I guess I must
have dozed a little.

1482
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,150
Betty sent some coffee.

1483
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:12,890
Well, that's going
to hit the spot.

1484
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,360
It’s awful quiet.

1485
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,060
Too quiet.

1486
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:30,110
Wyatt, do you figure we're going
to have to fight it out

1487
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,130
with the Clantons?

1488
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,440
I wish I knew, Jimmy.

1489
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:38,380
Maybe Ike will see
how hopeless it all is.

1490
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,690
You itching to get
back to California?

1491
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:49,250
I think about it
all the time.

1492
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:52,460
She must be
quite a girl.

1493
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,830
Yes, she is.

1494
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,340
Well...

1495
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:59,360
I better get to work.

1496
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:01,970
Look, how about letting me

1497
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:03,770
make the rounds
for you tonight?

1498
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,580
I get awful
lonesome sitting here

1499
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:07,210
with nothing to do but think.

1500
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,680
Sure, you go ahead.

1501
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,410
I could use some sleep.

1502
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,990
At least,
when I’m making the rounds,

1503
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,890
it gives me something else
to think about.

1504
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,850
Ike's called the play.

1505
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:30,720
We'll do it his way now.

1506
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,820
Don't do that, Wyatt,
that's what they want.

1507
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:35,060
Don't let them push you
into a personal fight.

1508
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,830
That's mighty funny
coming from you.

1509
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,020
You're a lawman, Wyatt--

1510
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:39,760
don't throw away
a lifetime's work.

1511
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,830
Where's your logic?

1512
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:42,230
To hell with logic.

1513
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,740
That's my brother
lying there.

1514
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:27,410
Who is it?

1515
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:29,420
Open the door!

1516
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:42,430
Start talkin', Kate.

1517
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:45,260
Doc... I don't know
nothin' about it.

1518
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,460
Talk.

1519
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,800
Why?

1520
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:55,470
What difference
does it make now?

1521
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:59,670
I sure messed everything up
real good, ain't l?

1522
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:05,950
I wanted you back,
and because I love you...

1523
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:07,960
and... l...

1524
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:10,250
I thought if Wyatt
was out of the way

1525
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:12,160
you'd come back to me.

1526
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:15,860
And that's... that's
why I kept quiet when l...

1527
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,130
when I heard them.

1528
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:20,730
I must have been out of my mind.

1529
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:21,960
Where?

1530
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:26,500
The Clanton ranch.

1531
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,980
Who was there?

1532
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:31,170
I didn't want that boy
to be killed!

1533
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,650
Who was there?

1534
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:40,420
Ike, the kid... Cotton Wilson
and the McLowerys.

1535
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,950
And Ringo?

1536
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:45,980
Was Ringo there?!

1537
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:49,620
Yes...
Ringo was there.

1538
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,420
No, Doc...

1539
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:55,830
Don't, Doc.

1540
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,770
Don't, please don't, Doc.

1541
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:00,300
Doc!

1542
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:20,390
Please don't, Doc.

1543
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:22,060
Please don't kill me.

1544
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,190
Please...

1545
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:24,560
Please!

1546
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,070
Please!

1547
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,590
Don't kill me!

1548
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,180
Doc?

1549
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,580
Doc!

1550
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,290
Doc!

1551
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,150
Oh, Doc.

1552
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,730
It’s all right, honey.

1553
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:36,630
It’s all right, honey.

1554
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,410
Wyatt?

1555
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:50,780
Ike sent me.

1556
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:00,280
I didn't have nothin'
to do with it.

1557
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:01,590
I didn't know
nothin' about...

1558
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:03,120
You got to believe me,
you got to.

1559
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,100
I guess it's just because
your name is Clanton.

1560
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:16,940
Ike sent me to see you.

1561
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,310
He wants to meet with you
and your family, personal.

1562
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:20,840
I’ve been expecting it.

1563
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,280
With no interference
from Clum.

1564
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,680
You have my word.

1565
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,020
How many men is he bringing?

1566
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:27,380
Six.

1567
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,950
There'll be Ike
and Finn and...

1568
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:31,290
Ringo and the McLowerys.

1569
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,120
Where and when?

1570
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,790
Sunup at OK Corral.

1571
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:36,920
You tell Ike
we'll be there.

1572
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,230
You said six.

1573
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:41,930
I’ll be coming with 'em.

1574
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,400
Don't do it, Billy.

1575
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,840
Give yourself
a chance to live.

1576
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,570
No, I thought about it.

1577
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:55,180
I thought
real hard about it.

1578
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:01,990
No, sir, I can't run.

1579
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:04,120
Ike and Finn are my brothers.

1580
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,060
You understand that,
don't you?

1581
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:13,560
Yes, Billy,
I understand that.

1582
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,040
How can you sit there
like you're playing checkers?

1583
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,840
How can you sit there like that?

1584
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:31,440
What's the matter with you?

1585
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:34,420
Why don't you go to John Clum
and ask for some help?

1586
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:37,120
I told you,
this is not Clum's affair.

1587
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,960
This is personal,

1588
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:40,860
between us and...
Ike Clanton.

1589
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,950
But you're lawmen...

1590
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,990
you are lawmen,
all three of you.

1591
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:47,000
You have no right
to put yourselves

1592
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:48,760
above the safety of this town.

1593
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,770
not to your own pride.

1594
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:56,630
Proud, proud men.

1595
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,610
Look at you...
look at the proud men.

1596
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:06,780
Morgan, does your wife know
she'll be a widow tomorrow?

1597
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:10,410
I think you'd better
leave the room.

1598
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:26,130
Virgil, your son wants
to kiss you goodnight.

1599
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:36,310
See you in the morning.

1600
01:42:56,530 --> 01:43:00,130
Doc, wake up.

1601
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:04,040
Doc, it's me, Wyatt.

1602
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:05,300
Wake up, do you hear me?

1603
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,120
You drunken sot.

1604
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:21,850
I need you, Doc.

1605
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,650
Don't let me down.

1606
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:26,320
Wake up, do you hear me?!
Wake up!

1607
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,790
Leave him alone.

1608
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:31,690
Can't you see he's dying?

1609
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:13,390
Leave them alone.

1610
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,630
Doc.

1611
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:22,340
How do you feel?

1612
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:24,780
The fight's this morning...

1613
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,400
isn't it?

1614
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:29,000
Well...

1615
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:30,810
I don’t know.

1616
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:39,690
Doc, you can't.

1617
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:41,460
You can't.

1618
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:46,530
Doc, you can't!

1619
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:47,690
You can't even stand up!

1620
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:54,270
You're going to die for sure,
if you go out there.

1621
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:00,000
If I’m going to die,

1622
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:02,680
at least let me die with
the only friend I ever had.

1623
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,720
We don't make
no difference, huh?

1624
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,020
You and l...

1625
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,120
we don't matter, Kate.

1626
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,960
We haven't mattered
since the day we were born.

1627
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,220
Get the horses around back.

1628
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,250
All right.

1629
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,100
Get going, Cotton.

1630
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:39,970
Frank.

1631
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:42,280
Take the rifle,
get inside the wagon.

1632
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,580
Up front.

1633
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:17,650
Morgan and Virgil
are waiting.

1634
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:02,410
Ike wants to talk to you alone.

1635
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,510
He's unarmed.

1636
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:05,860
Wait a minute, Wyatt.

1637
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:08,290
Kate told me about
the killing of your brother.

1638
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:10,420
It was the Clantons
all right...

1639
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:11,690
and you were in on it.

1640
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,200
I had nothing to do with it.

1641
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:14,530
Get back where you belong.

1642
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:15,430
Believe me, Wyatt...

1643
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:17,090
Get back with your friends.

1644
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:24,370
They're coming.

1645
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:35,450
They got Doc Holliday
with them.

1646
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:37,460
Holliday, huh?

1647
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:40,150
Cotton, you get over
with the horses.

1648
01:50:40,190 --> 01:50:41,350
Ike...

1649
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,630
I can't take this kind
of gunplay anymore.

1650
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:44,650
Let me out.

1651
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:46,460
Get over there.

1652
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:26,870
Seven of them, with Cotton.

1653
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:28,170
I only see six.

1654
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:32,870
Spread.

1655
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:49,790
Frank...

1656
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:52,490
Hit the dirt!

1657
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:13,080
Cover me.

1658
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:20,460
Shotgun!

1659
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:28,880
You all right?

1660
01:53:28,930 --> 01:53:29,920
All right...

1661
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,120
All right.

1662
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:10,570
Cotton, you chicken-livered,
miserable...

1663
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:29,040
They killed my brother!

1664
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:30,180
Tom, stay back, you fool!

1665
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:31,250
They killed my brother!

1666
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,030
Come on, Earp!

1667
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:40,050
I’ll kill you!

1668
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,340
Come out and get it, Earp!

1669
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:45,360
Earp! Come out and get it!

1670
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,770
Virg.

1671
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:23,800
Hurt bad?

1672
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,330
Yeah, my le... my legs.

1673
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:16,550
Doc?

1674
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:23,860
I’ll take care of Ringo.

1675
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:25,320
Billy?

1676
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,380
Throw down your gun
and come on out.

1677
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:33,890
Give up, boy,
you haven't got a chance!

1678
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:40,230
Come in and get me.
Come in and get me!

1679
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:55,150
Don't make me do it, boy.

1680
01:58:55,190 --> 01:58:56,660
Don't make me do it.

1681
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:27,970
I’m shoving off, Doc.

1682
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:30,280
How are the brothers?

1683
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,080
Coming along fine.

1684
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,590
They're going
to be all right.

1685
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,250
Another glass, Joe.

1686
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,150
I just want you to know

1687
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,130
I’d have never made it
without you.

1688
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,260
Where are you heading?

1689
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,030
California.

1690
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:53,000
Laura?

1691
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,840
I don’t know;
I hope so.

1692
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:56,840
She'll be waiting.

1693
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:02,210
Will you listen to me
for just once?

1694
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:04,010
Will you get up
to that hospital in Denver?

1695
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:05,210
At this rate,

1696
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:07,150
you can't last more
than a couple of months.

1697
02:01:07,190 --> 02:01:08,150
You crazy?

1698
02:01:08,190 --> 02:01:09,780
And give up
this winning streak?

1699
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,030
I’ll see you around.

1700
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:20,330
So long, preacher.

1701
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,040
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

1702
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:40,050
Hello, Doc.

1703
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:41,050
Hi, Doc.

1704
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:42,280
What's the name
of this game?

1705
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,310
Boot Hill

1706
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,790
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

1707
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:46,120
Boot Hill

1708
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:47,460
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

1709
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,650
So cold

1710
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:49,680
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

1711
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:51,320
So still

1712
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,330
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

1713
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:54,460
There they lay, side by side,

1714
02:01:54,570 --> 02:02:01,740
The killers that died
in the gunfight at OK Corral

1715
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:02,740
OK...

1716
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:04,240
OK

1717
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,400
Corral...

1718
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:06,710
Corral

1719
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:11,810
OK... Corral

1720
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:18,590
Gunfight at OK Corral!
