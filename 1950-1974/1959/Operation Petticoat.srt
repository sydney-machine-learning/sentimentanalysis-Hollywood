1
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:03,540
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Sir.

2
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:05,909
Good morning.

3
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,912
Good morning. I just
came to look around.

4
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:09,663
- Yes, sir.
- All right if I go below?

5
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:11,579
Certainly, sir. Can I
get you some coffee?

6
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,250
No, I'll just go below and wait
for the captain. Maybe later.

7
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:15,883
- Yes, sir.
- Chief.

8
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,429
Who's he?

9
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,551
- That's Sherman.
- Yeah?

10
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:25,096
And what is he doing here
at six in the morning?

11
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:29,235
He came to make sure that
you were comfortable.

12
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:31,646
Don't you know anything
about submarines?

13
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:35,024
Yes, sure. I know Sherman. He's
the boss of Submarines Pacific.

14
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:38,361
- He was the first captain of this boat.
- Yes, I know that.

15
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:41,881
Then you should be able to figure
out what he is doing here.

16
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,454
If you were the first
skipper of the "Sea Tiger"...

17
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:51,208
and you ordered her sent
to the junkyard at nine...

18
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,969
what would you be doing at six?

19
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,142
USN SEA TIGER
CAPTAIN'S JOURNAL

20
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,603
December 10, 1941.

21
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:47,066
Moored starboard side to Machina
Wharf. Cavite Navy Yard...

22
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,152
Philippine Islands, for
provisions and fuel.

23
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:52,739
Directive received from
Commander Asiatic Fleet...

24
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,342
"You will sink or destroy all enemy
ships wherever encountered."

25
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,497
Have advised Commander
Submarine Force, Asiatic Fleet...

26
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:00,874
that "Sea Tiger"...

27
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,712
...will be ready for sea at
19:00, 10 December 1941.

28
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:08,257
Captain! Captain!

29
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,187
Enemy planes over.

30
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:23,871
- Ready on engines?
- The best we can, Sir.

31
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,211
Cut those lines!

32
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,318
Take cover!

33
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,265
I'm not denying we suffered
minor damage, Sir, but...

34
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,476
Minor damage??

35
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:32,745
What does it take to convince you?
You've been sunk!

36
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,524
- You ought to read your own report.
- Yes.

37
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,569
â€œBulkheads, main ballast
tanks and pressure hull...

38
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,112
ripped by bomb fragments.

39
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:43,325
Engine room flooded, main induction
and ventilation wrecked...

40
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:47,914
torpedo tubes, motor controls
and reduction gear inoperable...

41
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:52,376
electrical equipment, wiring,
gauges, gyro, radio."

42
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,836
All you've got out there...

43
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:58,223
is a periscope sitting on a couple
of thousand tons of scrap metal.

44
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,427
What do you suggest, sir?

45
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:03,641
Should we underwater weld to jury patch
the hull before pumping her out...

46
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,352
or should we raise her first
and then work on the hull?

47
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:08,939
Matt, with major repairs
and a complete overhaul

48
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,106
maybe Sea Tiger could be
put back in commission.

49
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,943
- A functioning Navy yard might do it.
- Sir.

50
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:18,073
My chiefs are pretty good hands.
They know they're on their own.

51
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:20,744
And what we're up against. But we think
we can get " Sea Tiger " back in the war.

52
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:22,411
Yes, on who's side?

53
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:26,960
We're due to evacuate back
to Bataan on the 26th...

54
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:31,170
two weeks to do a job a yard
couldn't do in two months.

55
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:35,217
We don't think we can get her
into fighting trim right away...

56
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:39,055
repair it... just enough to
reach the nearest sub tender.

57
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,768
That would be the
"Bushnell", in Darwin.

58
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:44,145
Almost two thousand
miles of ocean...

59
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,608
with the Japanese
Navy roaming over it.

60
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:50,611
And you're going to make it in a sub held
together with spit and bailing wire?

61
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:51,695
Sir...

62
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,615
the " Sea Tiger " deserves
a better epitaph than...

63
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:57,577
"commissioned 1940, sunk, 1941.

64
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,706
Engagements: none.
Shots fired: none."

65
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:02,249
You can't let her go
that way, it's like...

66
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,922
a beautiful woman dying an old
maid, if know what I mean...

67
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,630
by an old maid.

68
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:10,842
- Did you ever sell used cars?
- No, sir.

69
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,387
I think you missed your calling.

70
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:17,016
Okay, Matt. You've got two weeks
to get her out or we blow her up.

71
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,649
Fair enough.

72
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:20,520
By the way...

73
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,943
three of my officers and eighteen
men have been transferred...

74
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:26,443
- ...How soon can I can get them back?
- You don't.

75
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,655
You'll have to get by
with a skeleton crew.

76
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,824
I'll get you what
replacements I can.

77
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:33,549
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

78
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,260
All done.

79
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,381
Men, clean up later.
That's all we can do now.

80
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,217
An odd job but might hold alright.

81
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:23,600
Yes, sir.

82
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:43,623
Do you think the
No. 2 tank will hold?

83
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,550
All that we can do is try, sir.

84
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,789
- Which one are you holding?
- The left.

85
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,916
Well hang on.

86
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,344
Okay, give her some air.

87
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,015
I found it, I found it!

88
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,045
- Found it. Look.
- I give up. What is it?

89
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,674
The cake that my mother sent me.

90
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,691
Isn't that nice. Take it to the
cook, maybe he'll warm it up.

91
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,522
Mothers.

92
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,145
Why couldn't she send
something we need?

93
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:46,786
Like a universal coupling joint.

94
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,991
What is it, Molumphry?

95
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:57,577
I do not know, sir.

96
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,376
Have a look.

97
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,294
Looks like the Good Humor man.

98
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:09,648
- I wonder if he left his tie off.
- What's going on?

99
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,983
- Take a look, sir.
- Okay.

100
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,438
Holy moly.

101
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,779
What is it?

102
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,282
I hope I'm wrong, but with that suitcase
I'd say he was one of the replacements.

103
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,343
Don't tell me that!

104
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:36,664
- Oh, for heaven's sake!
- Do you know anything about him?

105
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:40,292
Only from the society pages of
the Honolulu newspapers;...

106
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:43,129
- His name is Lieutenant Nick Holden.
- Holden.

107
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,506
He's the darling of the
high-class social set.

108
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:48,552
- I'll bet he is.
- He and the Admiral's wife...

109
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:52,024
won the rumba championship
two years in a row!

110
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:19,353
Okay, fellows. Come on,
knock it off. Back to work.

111
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,485
Lieutenant Nick Holden,
reporting for duty, sir.

112
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,732
Excuse the misunderstanding,
Mr. Holden...

113
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,778
It's unusual to see an Admiral's
aide without the Admiral.

114
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,280
He was scheduled to be transferred.
I was sent to make arrangements...

115
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,784
- then the war broke out...
- And you're stranded?

116
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:47,495
Yes, sir. Captain Henderson
assigned me to you...

117
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:50,288
He said to hurry...
before you left.

118
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:52,040
The bearings are okay sir...

119
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,546
but if we don't come up with an
oil pump shaft we will only...

120
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:58,800
- ...get out of here by rowing.
- Didn't Hunkle follow up the requisition?

121
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,720
Requisition? That's all we do.
But we never get anything.

122
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,348
We might as well write a
letter to Santa Claus.

123
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,156
Ya. Well, thank you, Tostin.

124
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,522
- Have you ever been in a submarine?
- No, sir.

125
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:15,527
We need a torpedo and gunnery
officer. Any experience?

126
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,239
- Guns? I'm afraid not, sir.
- How about navigation?

127
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,117
- Terribly sorry.
- Communications?

128
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,951
Wish I could help, sir.

129
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,078
Tell me.

130
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,289
Before becoming an Admiral's aide
What did you do in the navy?

131
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,751
Well, sir, I was
primarily an idea man.

132
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:30,544
I see. Well...

133
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,339
Tell me... what does
an idea man do?

134
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,646
I coordinated the Navy day
parade in Milwaukee...

135
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:40,264
and I was the special liaison officer
for the Eleventh Naval District.

136
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:42,608
- Liaison? With what?
- Hollywood.

137
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:46,104
I coordinated the design
of admission posters.

138
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:49,623
From there I transferred to
Fleet Headquarters Honolulu.

139
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,361
Is that where they
gave you sea duty?

140
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:56,498
No, sir. I was the Recreation
Officer at the Royal Arms Hotel.

141
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,745
Just for my information...

142
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:01,789
What does an idea
man do in a hotel?

143
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,835
The Navy took over the hotel
for officer's training...

144
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,086
and I saw that entertainment
was provided.

145
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:10,297
- Have you ever been to sea?
- Yes, sir, destroyer duty.

146
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:14,094
- How did you find time for it?
- It was a mistake, sir.

147
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:17,056
A week after I left Honolulu
they got it straightened out.

148
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,434
Who, the Admiral or
the Admiral's wife?

149
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:21,771
She must be upset with
you out here ;...

150
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:24,649
that will cost her the rumba
championship this year.

151
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,365
Holy!

152
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:32,824
Here you go, my man. Will you take
this bag and clubs to the submarine?

153
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,457
Thank you, son.

154
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:49,219
Hunkle.

155
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,970
What about that oil pump?

156
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:52,973
Well, I put in four requisitions.

157
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,810
- Did you put stamp them urgent?
- I put a requisition in for one, sir.

158
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,646
- For what?
- An urgent stamp, we haven't got one.

159
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,732
Haven't we received
anything from supplies?

160
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,525
The only requisition
that's been filled

161
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,821
is the requisition for
more requisition paper.

162
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,531
Captain, I got the trim pump
broken down. Want to look at it?

163
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,675
- Yes.
- All right, Hunkle.

164
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,625
Can I help you, sir?

165
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:15,499
No, not really. My name
is Lt. Nick Holden.

166
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,293
- I'm Ernest Hunkle.
- Pleasure to meet you.

167
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,141
Would care for some coffee?

168
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,722
- Yes, thank you.
- Follow me.

169
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:33,529
- Who is that?
- It's " The Prophet ", sir.

170
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:37,399
His he always that cheerful?

171
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,443
That's just the way he is, sir.
Don't mind him.

172
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:41,361
- Cream and sugar?
- Yes, thank you.

173
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:43,947
"Why even try?...

174
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:47,494
If you're lucky enough...

175
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:51,582
to live through today...

176
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,170
tomorrow...

177
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:59,604
you will die."

178
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,688
I don't know...

179
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,514
From the looks of things around here
he knows what he's singing about.

180
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,391
- Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:10,021
- Excuse me, I must get back to my work.
- Certainly.

182
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:11,651
Thank you.

183
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,921
Sir.

184
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,580
- Sir. Look at this.
- What?

185
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,792
Last June, when we were here,
I requisitioned toilet paper.

186
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:30,417
Every time we've been back
I sent through a follow up...

187
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:34,675
according to the book through
channels I even submitted a sample.

188
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:35,884
So what happens?

189
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:40,647
They responded: " Cannot identify,
requisition cancelled ".

190
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:44,435
Not that I'm complaining, sir, but
this what I've been going through.

191
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,104
All right, Hunkle. Relax...

192
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,952
Take a letter.

193
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,032
Let's see.

194
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:53,445
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,490
From Commanding Officer
" USS Sea Tiger "...

196
00:16:56,491 --> 00:17:00,258
To Supply Officer, Navy Yard,
Cavite, Philippines...

197
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:04,091
Dear Commander Submarine
Forces, etc...

198
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,560
Subject: Toilet paper.

199
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,297
One:..

200
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:12,676
On 6 June, 1941...

201
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:17,181
this vessel submitted a requisition
for 150 rolls of toilet paper...

202
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:20,810
On 16 December, 1941...

203
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:23,605
the requisition was returned
with stamped notation...

204
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:27,042
"can not identify
material required".

205
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,736
Two:..

206
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,948
The Commanding Officer of
the " USS Sea Tiger "...

207
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:34,325
can not help but wonder
what is being used...

208
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:38,580
at Cavite as a substitute for
this unidentifiable material...

209
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,174
once so well known to this command.

210
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,128
Three:..
- Excuse me, sir.

211
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,853
- What?
- Excuse me for interrupting.

212
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:49,426
- Have you ever been to Las Vegas?
- Why?

213
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:52,304
The boys up there would say you're
trying to make your point the hard way.

214
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,307
Putting in requisitions,
going through channels...

215
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,603
You've got to sneak
up a few back alleys.

216
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:01,356
You need a Supply Officer to
help you find those back alleys.

217
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,859
- You, Mr. Holden?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,952
- You'd ruin your manicure.
- Here.

219
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:09,421
Don't let my manicure
fool you, sir.

220
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,078
I grew up in a neighborhood
called " Noah's Ark ".

221
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,539
If you didn't travel in
pairs, you didn't travel.

222
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,474
Why don't you make out a shopping list
and I'll see what's left at the market?

223
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,592
You're not the volunteering
type. What's your angle?

224
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:26,803
Same as yours. We both want
to get the submarine...

225
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:30,016
out of here. You so you
can fight your war...

226
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,474
and me...

227
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:33,393
Well, let's say I'm an optimist.

228
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:37,743
Wherever we're headed I am
sure I can get a better deal.

229
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:43,155
Mr. Holden, I may regret this...

230
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,200
but you've just been
made my Supply Officer.

231
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,286
- Get your list from Hunkle.
- Thank you, sir.

232
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:52,499
I am going to need a couple
of men. May I pick my own?

233
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,852
- Right.
- Thank you, sir.

234
00:18:58,716 --> 00:18:59,883
Hunkle...

235
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:03,439
I've got a list for you. We're
going shopping tonight.

236
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:15,531
Turn on the lights.

237
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:31,960
Look, gentlemen, I think
we hit pay dirt.

238
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,380
- Do you have the list?
- Yes, sir.

239
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,424
Take the stuff we need to the door.

240
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,344
Let's go, we don't have much
time. Come on, guys.

241
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,263
You grab the wire.

242
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,516
- I forgot something, sir.
- What did you forget?

243
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,436
I never wrapped up my
belongings for my kinfolk...

244
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:49,440
- ...if we don't get back.
- Will you stop talking like that?

245
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,652
They're going to find us and
shoot us down like a dog.

246
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,697
- Will you shut up?
- Alright, Hunkle.

247
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,531
He's got the right idea;
so be very careful.

248
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:01,799
- Get it to the door.
- Don't forget what you promised ;...

249
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:06,639
When the shooting starts turn your
back so Gertie won't get splattered.

250
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:09,673
Who is Gertie?

251
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,758
- You don't know about Gertie?
- Shut up.

252
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,102
Get moving with that thing.

253
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,305
Hunkle, who is Gertie?

254
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:21,612
Molumphry will be happy
with this wiring.

255
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:25,490
Hunkle, I asked you a question.

256
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:34,909
Who is Gertie?

257
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,501
- The truth is that she's nobody.
- Hunkle.

258
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,919
Well, sir, when my enlistment
was up last year, the boys...

259
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,005
gave me a farewell party.

260
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:49,977
I do not usually drink, sir,
but that night I must have.

261
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:51,846
The last thing I remember...

262
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,235
is standing in front
of a tattoo parlor...

263
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,294
May I?

264
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,328
- They ought to hang you in the Louvre.
- I came home to marry...

265
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:16,833
but when I saw myself in
the mirror, I reenlisted.

266
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,376
I never could explain
Gertie to my fiancÃ©e.

267
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:22,766
No. I can see you've got a problem.

268
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,467
But look on the bright side ;...

269
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:28,512
You've probably got the
sexiest chest in the Navy.

270
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,278
- Sir.
- Yes.

271
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:33,811
I am not one to worry when
there's no need but...

272
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:37,105
after we get this stuff to the door,
how do we get it to the boat?

273
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:41,109
Don't worry about that, just
keep your stuff... The police!

274
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,954
<i>Check the warehouses.</i>

275
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
Halt!

276
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,810
What's your business here?

277
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:12,397
- I stepped out for a breath of air.
- Let's see your identification.

278
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,571
Certainly. Here you are.

279
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,611
Lieutenant.

280
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,071
Why black face, sir?

281
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,451
Don't you know the penalty for
breaking blackout regulations?

282
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:25,829
- Blackout regulations?
- You read the order from Admiral Nimitz?

283
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,791
- No. What order?
- Regulation 4-1-9-8-2:..

284
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:32,295
"... no navy personnel shall appear
at night without face camouflage."

285
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:36,799
A plane comes over, you look
up, give away our position.

286
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,304
Sergeant, a face like that
could cause a lot of damage...

287
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,223
I'll have to put you on report.

288
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:43,933
Honestly, sir, no one
told me about it.

289
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,947
Alright, you've been told.

290
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,897
Black out that face, Sgt.

291
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:51,538
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

292
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,011
- Admiral Nimitz?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:22,518
- Hey that was close.
- It's a trap...

294
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,521
we used to take
possums like that...

295
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:27,735
you fool them so they
feel safe and then, bang!

296
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:31,871
- We are three possums waiting...
- Come on, Prophet. Just...

297
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:35,669
We've only got a couple of
minutes. Get the stuff.

298
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,776
- Hey Chief!
- Yes, Dooley?

299
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,754
Your shaft's here.

300
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,123
Thanks, Dooley.

301
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:15,206
Look, Molumphry, brand
new oil pump shaft.

302
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,262
Congratulations, look's
like you, Tostin.

303
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,381
- What is that?
- Your refrigerator unit.

304
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:25,675
- That?
- We were lucky to get it.

305
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:28,151
Man, it was cold in that ice house.

306
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:32,225
- Look, sir, new oil pump shaft.
- Fine, fine.

307
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,936
- Where is Mr. Holden?
- Keeping an eye on the truck.

308
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:36,652
Mr. Holden!

309
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:42,820
- A decent night for shopping, sir.
- Yes.

310
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:44,530
Could be something saved.

311
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:48,535
I know where you got the Navy
supplies but what about the truck?

312
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:52,580
I can't take credit for the
truck, sir. Ramon got it.

313
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:54,890
- Ramon?
- Ramon!

314
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,088
Smile, sir. He's very sensitive.

315
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:01,175
- What?
- Captain Sherman, Sergeant Gillardo.

316
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:03,928
I'm happy to be a member
of your crew, sir.

317
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,570
What do you mean,
member of my crew??

318
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,267
Well, sir...

319
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:11,728
I promised the sergeant that if he
helped us out, you'll take him on.

320
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,230
But he's a marine.

321
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:17,248
Well, he's open to a better offer.
You'd better get back to work.

322
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,953
I'll handle this.

323
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:24,661
That man is a prisoner.

324
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:27,831
Well, it was. You see, the
prison stockade was bombed...

325
00:25:27,832 --> 00:25:30,708
you have no idea how
hard it was to find him.

326
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,918
You mean you actually
went looking for him?

327
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:35,505
Of course. He's the greatest
operator around here...

328
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:38,551
shortly after he became
General Warren's chef...

329
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:40,971
- ...he went into business for himself.
- I'll bet.

330
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,862
He was sole owner of best
restaurant in Manila.

331
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,935
And what about the
" P " on his back?

332
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,866
- The " P"?
- Yes.

333
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:50,074
Oh, that...
Let's start there.

334
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:54,069
You see, someone started prying
and found that the Marines...

335
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,783
supplying all the meat and silverware...
But he's a man who can get a job done.

336
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,788
There isn't a burglar, swindler,
pickpocket or fence on the island...

337
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:05,124
that doesn't love,
know, and respect him.

338
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,545
That's probably a glowing
recommendation, Mr. Holden...

339
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:11,089
I have no intention of
taking a thief on my crew...

340
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,008
He's an escaped
prisoner, a deserter.

341
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,387
- True, but he is also one other thing.
- What?

342
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:19,946
He's also an informer...

343
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:23,686
and if we don't take him he
will tell everybody everything.

344
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:24,813
Yeah.

345
00:26:24,814 --> 00:26:27,290
And you're in too deep
for than now, sir.

346
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:30,615
We don't have a sales slip
for all this merchandise.

347
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:33,989
It seems I'm boxed in, Mr. Holden.

348
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,376
You've made a wise decision, sir.
I will tell him, he will be so happy.

349
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,505
Ramon!

350
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,466
You have to give him credit, sir...

351
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:51,676
- that's what I call a Supply Officer.
- What?

352
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,679
I wonder where he got everything.

353
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,475
There's only one way to live with the
situation. It's like watching a stripper...

354
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,981
do not ask how she does it,
just enjoy what's coming off.

355
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,612
19 December, 1941.
The repairs are progressing.

356
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:09,948
Morale is high, except for
their concern that...

357
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:12,491
our supply officer might
be caught and shot.

358
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:14,177
My emotions about this are mixed...

359
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:17,682
Lt. Holden and Sgt.
Gillardo are undoubtedly...

360
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,240
the world's greatest thieves.

361
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:22,492
Scavengers.

362
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:24,564
To paraphrase Mr. Churchill ;...

363
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:28,485
" never have so few stolen
so much from so many."

364
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:31,113
And what they can not
find in warehouses...

365
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,089
they improvise.

366
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:58,145
Mr. Sherman, I'm aware that there
has been wholesale scavenging...

367
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,565
No, up to now I overlooked
it, knowing the position.

368
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,610
- Yes, sir.
- But this time you've gone too far.

369
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,493
Mr. Sherman...

370
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:09,918
I want my wall back.

371
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:15,582
- I'm not sure we have it.
- You must have it. You've got everything else.

372
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:18,378
I do not mind a bit of
initiative but you...

373
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,807
Sir, I have to get back to my boat.

374
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:25,107
Wait a minute, I'll go with you!

375
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:17,778
- Any damage?
- No direct hit, sir.

376
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:21,032
Concussion may have sprung some plates
in the tanks, Mr. Watson's checking.

377
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,077
Or camouflage caught
fire, we cut it down.

378
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:24,912
- Were we spotted?
- Yes, sir.

379
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,997
A couple gave us a close-up
look we could spit at...

380
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:30,090
without the. 50 that's
all we could do.

381
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,220
Well, I guess that does it.

382
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:42,350
- Now they'll know where to find us.
- I'm sorry, Matt.

383
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:44,978
Sir, request permission
to get underway.

384
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:46,561
- Get underway?
- Yes.

385
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:47,646
In that?

386
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,275
I can get as far as Cebu
and complete repairs.

387
00:29:50,276 --> 00:29:52,402
- Cebu??
- That's only 400 miles.

388
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:55,698
You'd be in trouble if it was 400 feet.
You're in no condition to go out.

389
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:58,868
- We've made amazing progress.
- You can not even submerge...

390
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:02,581
If you try running on top in the
daylight you're a dead duck.

391
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:04,334
- Molumphry!
- Yes, sir?

392
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,919
- Can this boat go down?
- Like a rock, sir.

393
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,964
- Mr. Watson, how are the plates?
- Tight as a drum, sir.

394
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:14,469
- And the engines, Tostin?
- Factory fresh, sir.

395
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,096
What do you say, sir?

396
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,350
Take your scavengers and
these liars and get out.

397
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,270
- Yes, sir.
- But one stipulation.

398
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:23,980
You will engage no enemy
shipping, including lifeboats.

399
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:28,278
If you see someone swimming
in the water avoid him.

400
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,653
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.

401
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,285
Thank you, sir.

402
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,116
Matt.

403
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:36,287
Is this what's left of my wall?

404
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,621
I wouldn't know, sir.

405
00:30:37,622 --> 00:30:39,581
I would appreciate at least...

406
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:42,259
- ...getting my window back.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:48,842
Can we make it?

408
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:51,345
Well, we have No. 1
engine in shape.

409
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,930
No. 2 I'll tell you about
when it's put back together.

410
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,183
How about three and four?

411
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,644
I've been using them for
parts for one and two.

412
00:30:57,645 --> 00:31:01,858
I am a religious man, Captain, I
believe God will get us through.

413
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,246
Of course, He'll have to give
us his undivided attention.

414
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,406
Mr. Watson!

415
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,449
Be ready to get underway when
Mr. Holden and his gang get back.

416
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,203
- Aye, sir.
- Any idea where they went?

417
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,831
No, sir. When the air raid
started they took off.

418
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:19,597
All Mr. Holden said was:
"in confusion there is profit."

419
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,478
Obviously the same guys who...

420
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:38,745
Sir, we just got a call from the
Security Officer, and he's furious.

421
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:40,735
Why? What's wrong?

422
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:43,579
Apparently someone stole his safe.

423
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:58,934
What happened, sir?

424
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:04,231
Douglas, I think we've been victims
of Sherman's march to the sea.

425
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:07,683
Make all preparations
for getting underway.

426
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:08,726
Aye aye, sir.

427
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,685
Station the watch.

428
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:12,913
Lookouts to posts for sea.

429
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:20,504
- Ready to get underway?
- Ready, sir.

430
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:23,785
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

431
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:26,795
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

432
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:47,646
Ready on No. 1 engine.

433
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:50,453
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

434
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,763
Any time they're ready.

435
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:19,405
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Any time you're ready.

436
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:49,592
Mr. Holden! What the devil is that?

437
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:53,471
A witch doctor, sir. Ramon found
him in the hills. We hired him.

438
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:55,354
You hired him?

439
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,395
To ward off evil spirits and
wish us a safe journey.

440
00:33:58,396 --> 00:34:01,452
I figured we could use all
the help we could get, sir.

441
00:34:15,414 --> 00:34:17,046
Hey hey hey hey.

442
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:18,918
Cut that out.

443
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:22,339
Mr. Holden! Will you
tell this fella...

444
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,813
I can't hear myself think!

445
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:27,319
Go away, please!

446
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:32,739
Get away from my boat!
Get away from my...!

447
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,113
Single up all lines.

448
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,710
Single one.

449
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,248
Single four.

450
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,175
Right full rudder.

451
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:57,046
All ahead one third,
starboard back one third.

452
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:59,047
All ahead one third,
starboard back one third.

453
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:00,646
What a character.

454
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,195
All stop. Shift your rudder.

455
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:20,290
All stop. Shift your rudder.

456
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,756
All ahead two thirds.
Ease your rudder.

457
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:38,101
All ahead two thirds.
Ease your rudder.

458
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,976
You'll never make it.

459
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,774
Tostin is still fighting with
the No. 2 engine, sir.

460
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:28,704
Sounds like he's losing.

461
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:30,485
How's the battery charge?

462
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:33,030
Just enough for a trim dive.

463
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,407
Okay to try it?

464
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:38,260
Not now, wait for the dawn,
we have to take it down then.

465
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:40,631
We will have to try it sometime.

466
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,251
I'm not complaining, sir.
I had my choice.

467
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:44,634
Of what?

468
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,855
I could have gone to West Point.

469
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,683
Careful, sir.

470
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,772
Well, now is the time.

471
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:03,440
Let's take her down.

472
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:04,567
Aye, sir.

473
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,570
- Clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge.

474
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,029
- Number one.
- Aye.

475
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,407
- Number Two.
- Aye.

476
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:11,669
- Number Three.
- Number Four.

477
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:22,844
- Make depth five-eight feet.
- Aye, sir. Five-eight feet.

478
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:29,520
Five-eight feet.

479
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,324
Check your bubble.

480
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:50,959
Close all vents.

481
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:02,551
All ahead one third.

482
00:38:02,552 --> 00:38:04,433
All ahead one third.

483
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,784
Periscope depth.

484
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:18,120
Let's check for leaks.
Take her down to 100 feet.

485
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:23,201
All ahead two-thirds.

486
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:24,492
All ahead two-thirds.

487
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:26,636
6 degrees down bubble.

488
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:41,845
All departments check for leaks.
Report to control.

489
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,100
All departments check
for leaks. Report to control.

490
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:46,726
Close watertight doors.
Close bulkhead flappers.

491
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:49,702
Close watertight doors.
Close bulkhead flappers.

492
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,500
She creaks a bit.

493
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:08,216
She's sure moaning
and groaning, sir.

494
00:39:11,464 --> 00:39:13,179
Cycle all vents.

495
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,184
I doubt if Sam Sneed would
approve of using irons that way.

496
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:23,603
We were lucky that Mr. Holden
had a set of golf clubs.

497
00:39:23,604 --> 00:39:25,152
Aren't we?

498
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:33,619
Guess we didn't bleed all the air
out of the hydraulic system.

499
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:38,797
100 feet.

500
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:59,144
You can't win, my friend.

501
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:01,239
You can't win.

502
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:06,711
You can't win, so why even try?

503
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,157
If you're lucky enough...

504
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,917
to live through today...

505
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,338
Tomorrow you will die.

506
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,968
All compartments report tight, sir.

507
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:25,674
Thank you.

508
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:27,900
Open the watertight doors.

509
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,850
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

510
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,769
If you're ready for breakfast,
sir, I'll be in the wardroom.

511
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,814
- What is that?
- Orange juice, sir.

512
00:40:38,815 --> 00:40:40,023
Where are you taking it?

513
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:43,081
For Mr. Holden. He's
having breakfast in bed.

514
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:46,073
Wait a moment, Sgt.

515
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:48,798
- I'll take it down.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,600
May I come in?

517
00:40:58,339 --> 00:40:59,546
Please do.

518
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:01,548
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Holden.

519
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:05,104
- I've got a bad neck from too much tennis.
- Really?

520
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:07,723
Well. Did you get a
good night's sleep?

521
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:10,725
Not too good; it was a little damp
and noisy. Strange surroundings.

522
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:12,787
I'm sorry to hear that.

523
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,063
Thank you.

524
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,524
Well, how's the food? Satisfactory?

525
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,401
Excellent, thank you.

526
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:21,292
- Would you like a cigar?
- No, no thanks.

527
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:24,159
I suppose after you
digested breakfast...

528
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,548
you'll want to get up on deck and
play a little shuffleboard, right?

529
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,213
This war must be inconvenient
for you, Mr. Holden?

530
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:36,046
I try to make the best of.

531
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:39,801
Yes, and you do, indeed you do.

532
00:41:39,802 --> 00:41:43,097
I know you're not familiar with
the way the functions at sea.

533
00:41:43,098 --> 00:41:45,608
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

534
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:48,645
But here we all...

535
00:41:48,646 --> 00:41:51,106
We all eat and work together...

536
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:55,124
and so you won't upset that system,
You will have to do it our way.

537
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:58,281
You've got three minutes to
get off your fat mattress...

538
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,492
- and report to Mr. Watson!
- Yes, sir.

539
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,954
You are going to learn something
if I have to poor it into you!

540
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:08,168
Another thing: here we dress alike,
Got any regulation trousers?

541
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:11,421
No, sir. I had all my clothes
made at " Saks " Fifth Avenue.

542
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:14,218
I can't to do anything about the
uniform, but don't want you to think...

543
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:17,687
I'll expect breakfast
in bed every morning.

544
00:42:18,181 --> 00:42:20,723
Scuttlebutt is that we will
submerge at daybreak...

545
00:42:20,724 --> 00:42:22,975
and if you gotta go, you
might as well go big.

546
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:27,029
It is past daybreak
and we are submerged.

547
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,499
- We are?
- Yes.

548
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:33,546
- You mean we're under??
- Yes.

549
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,660
But it isn't a permanent situation?

550
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:41,039
I mean, we can up if we'd like to?

551
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,927
Well, I'd like to think we can.
But I'm an incurable optimist.

552
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,342
What happens, sir, if...?

553
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:51,980
What happens if we can not...?

554
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:55,596
If we can not...

555
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,397
Then...

556
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,522
- What kind of answer is that?
- Why? Nervous, Mr. Holden?

557
00:43:02,523 --> 00:43:04,191
Yes.

558
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:07,544
Tell me something:
Why did you join the navy?

559
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:10,294
Because I needed an
officer's uniform.

560
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:13,908
As a kid I was a victim of the
most vicious propaganda;...

561
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:17,247
people told me... that money was
not everything, and I believed it.

562
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,500
Until I found out
that people saying...

563
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:21,960
"money is not everything"
were the ones who had it.

564
00:43:21,961 --> 00:43:24,922
I figured they were trying
to hide a good thing.

565
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:26,800
Sir, please sit down.

566
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:28,481
Yes.

567
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:34,391
Now there are two simple
ways to make money:..

568
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:37,115
You can steal it, or
you can marry it.

569
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,275
To marry it, you have to
travel in the right circles...

570
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:42,026
on the right side of the tracks.

571
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:43,278
Two things I learned:

572
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:46,865
One: A uniform can take you
to the best places, and two:..

573
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:50,328
No one ever checks Dun and
Bradstreet in a bedroom.

574
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,495
It sounds like a
winning combination.

575
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,592
Would you like to see the jackpot?

576
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:59,003
That the girl from the
right side of the tracks?

577
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:00,671
She owns the tracks...

578
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:05,438
or 5.2 % of all the
railroad stock in America.

579
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:07,181
Isn't she lovely?

580
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:11,310
We had a dinner date one night,
and I was a few minutes late...

581
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,474
and she didn't want
it to happen again.

582
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,606
Have you ever seen a two
thousand dollar watch?

583
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:18,537
My, my, my.

584
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:22,835
When the minister says " will you take
this woman? " He won't be kidding.

585
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:26,410
- When is the happy occasion?
- The day I get back.

586
00:44:26,411 --> 00:44:30,039
You see that I get back and I'll
see you have a private submarine.

587
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,839
For heaven's sake.

588
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:38,507
Excuse me.

589
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:41,385
Is this normal or should
I be nervous again?

590
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:43,264
- Captain!
- Yes.

591
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,474
One of our connections
carried away, sir...

592
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:48,234
We're rigging a patch, but I
don't think it will hold.

593
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,108
- Prepare to surface.
- Stand by to surface. Lookouts to conning tower.

594
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,567
Stand by to surface.
Lookouts to conning tower.

595
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:56,944
- How much time for repairs?
- About six hours...

596
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,739
- ...if we can work over the side.
- Six hours...

597
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,494
The nearest place with a
sheltered anchorage is.

598
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,248
- Marinduque island. We better head there.
- Okay.

599
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:06,456
- Watch your fault.
- Yes, sir.

600
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:09,016
All free, sir. Sound the alarm.

601
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:13,421
22 December, 1941.

602
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:17,261
Arrived Marinduque two hours
after enemy air raid.

603
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:20,556
Repairs have to be completed
before their next visit.

604
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:22,933
To get Lt. Holden out
from underfoot...

605
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:27,153
I sent him and his men
to scout the island.

606
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,954
- Captain.
- Yes.

607
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:35,865
Mr. Holden is coming back, sir.

608
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:39,218
War is hell, Mr. Watson.

609
00:45:39,788 --> 00:45:42,465
Not only that, sir.

610
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,052
Wait until you see what
he's got with him.

611
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:10,655
Women!

612
00:46:10,656 --> 00:46:14,341
Wow! That's what I call scavenging!

613
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:18,165
I... What I meant sir is...

614
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,293
I'm sure there will be something
they can be used for.

615
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:25,006
I can think of many uses,
but not here and now.

616
00:46:25,007 --> 00:46:29,344
Mr. Stovall, the influence of Lt.
Holden is beginning to worry me.

617
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:33,278
I suggest you "Wow!" less
and "Tsk Tsk Tsk" more...

618
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,804
- Mayor Heywood.
- Major Heywood.

619
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:01,435
- Lieutenant Duran.
- Lieutenant Duran.

620
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:05,351
- Lieutenant Reid.
- Lieutenant.

621
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:08,656
Lieutenant. Colfax.

622
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:10,646
Lieutenant.

623
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:14,078
Lieutenant Crandall.

624
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,783
If anyone asks what
you're fighting for...

625
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:21,749
there's your answer.

626
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:28,954
Lt. Holden invited
us to go with you.

627
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:30,080
What?

628
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,457
The Major and her unit
were stranded, sir.

629
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,002
We were en route to Manila and
heard it was being bombed...

630
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,422
- ...and we had to land here.
- Oh.

631
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:39,800
The Japanese strafed
the airstrip and...

632
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:42,552
our plane took off to keep from
being destroyed on the ground.

633
00:47:42,553 --> 00:47:44,181
He was supposed to
come back for us.

634
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:45,765
- Alright.
- It didn't make it.

635
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:48,768
They were the only Americans
on the island, sir...

636
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:50,937
You could not possibly
leave them there.

637
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,148
Thank you.

638
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:55,834
- It's an emergency, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Holden.

639
00:47:55,944 --> 00:48:00,615
Now, Major, obviously we have to get
out of here as fast as we can, so...

640
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:03,452
if you'll get your party
below, I'll get you to Cebu...

641
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,496
where you can rejoin an Army unit.

642
00:48:05,497 --> 00:48:08,751
- Escort the Major to the wardroom.
- Yes, sir.

643
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:09,792
Thank you, Lieutenant.

644
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:12,351
- Thank you, ma'am.
- This way, ladies.

645
00:48:16,468 --> 00:48:18,761
- I guess I'm stuck.
- Yes.

646
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:22,448
Just a minute.
Come on. That's right.

647
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:26,490
- Thank you very much.
- Suggest you take the other one off.

648
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:34,695
Sir.

649
00:48:34,696 --> 00:48:36,115
Mr. Holden, just a minute.

650
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:38,958
- Mr. Watson!
- Yes, sir?

651
00:48:39,912 --> 00:48:41,621
Please assemble the crew.

652
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:45,668
Instruct them to ignore that
our passengers are women.

653
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:47,420
That may require some...

654
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:50,963
readjustment... but I want
every man to understand...

655
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:53,467
our objective is Cebu
and then Darwin.

656
00:48:53,468 --> 00:48:56,222
If any man has any other
objective in mind...

657
00:48:56,223 --> 00:48:57,722
he'd better forget it.

658
00:48:57,723 --> 00:48:59,891
You will put on report...

659
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:01,775
Collision!

660
00:49:02,854 --> 00:49:04,857
- Collision, sir!
- Really...

661
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,118
we're not even moving.

662
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,659
- Who hit the collision button?
- I do not know, sir.

663
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,513
Everything has a reason
for being here...

664
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,252
- What happened?
- I'm very sorry.

665
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:25,872
I was coming down the ladder and
accidentally touched that button.

666
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:26,873
She grabbed the collision alarm.

667
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:28,143
Just a minute.

668
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:31,720
Please, ladies, there is one
primary rule you must observe:..

669
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:34,430
Keep your hands...
and... you're, uh...

670
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:36,684
Just do not touch anything.

671
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,731
The ladies will occupy the
Chief's quarters and my cabin.

672
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:45,628
The Chiefs move out with the men. Move my
gear with Watson and you stay with Holden.

673
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,626
Now, uh...

674
00:49:48,074 --> 00:49:51,493
For the next few days we'll
be living in close contact...

675
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:53,287
and you being women... and...

676
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:58,052
the crew being men,
being confined could...

677
00:49:58,212 --> 00:50:00,753
could create situations...
not usually...

678
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:03,764
consistent with normal
submarine operations.

679
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,138
- What I mean to say.
- We know what you mean, Captain.

680
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:09,181
We're well acquainted
with the facts of life.

681
00:50:09,182 --> 00:50:13,114
So are the men. I'm just trying to
avoid any exchange of information.

682
00:50:15,438 --> 00:50:17,201
You must...

683
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,732
You must realize that...

684
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:22,114
submarines are not designed
to be coeducational.

685
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:23,913
That is to say...

686
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,912
Mr. Stovall, take the
ladies to the wardroom.

687
00:50:28,913 --> 00:50:31,885
- I'll try to work out a schedule.
- Yes, sir.

688
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:37,179
You'll eat in the officers' mess.

689
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:42,191
Mealtimes are 7:00,
12:00 and 18:00.

690
00:50:42,762 --> 00:50:45,098
Now, this is the shower.

691
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:46,482
Excuse me.

692
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:48,892
Instructions are on the bulkhead.

693
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:52,605
Your shower period
will be 6:30 to 6:50.

694
00:50:52,606 --> 00:50:54,982
You will each have a
minute and a half.

695
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:56,902
A minute and a half?

696
00:50:56,903 --> 00:51:00,073
Captain 's orders, there are
problems with fresh water supply.

697
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:01,907
How can you shower in
a minute and a half?

698
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:05,204
What you miss one day you can
get the next time around.

699
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:09,305
In here is what we
in the Navy call...

700
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,713
It's operated by means of the
air compression levers...

701
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:17,936
What do they call it?

702
00:51:18,803 --> 00:51:22,359
The head.

703
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:27,788
I've drawn a complete diagram.
I'm sure you will have no trouble.

704
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,341
Why do they call it the head?

705
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,669
Doesn't say.

706
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,541
A woman on board is
bad luck, sir...

707
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:48,003
and if one is bad
luck, imagine five.

708
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:51,299
Alright, what do you want me to do?
Throw them overboard?

709
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,524
It 's something to think about.

710
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:58,571
Do what you can, okay?

711
00:51:59,643 --> 00:52:01,352
Hunkle, what 's going on in there?

712
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:03,520
It's a raffle, they're
drawing for the women.

713
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:04,772
They're drawing for the women?

714
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:08,328
Mr. Holden organized it. They're
picking the five lucky men now.

715
00:52:09,903 --> 00:52:11,453
Kraus.

716
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:15,576
Congratulations.
What did you give away?

717
00:52:15,577 --> 00:52:17,328
- What's going on?
- A raffle, sir.

718
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:18,663
What kind of raffle?

719
00:52:18,664 --> 00:52:21,959
- For clothing.
- Clothes?

720
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,754
Yes. The men are donating
their clothes to the women.

721
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:26,922
- Have you men finished chow?
- Yes, sir.

722
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:30,477
Then back on the job. We
have to get out of here.

723
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,522
- Mr. Holden.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:37,643
How did all that get started?

725
00:52:37,644 --> 00:52:40,314
I thought I was boosting
the men's morale, sir...

726
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:42,649
after all there's a
practical side ;...

727
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,153
these women have been on an
island for quite a while...

728
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:46,987
their clothes are all messed up.

729
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:50,158
Sooner or later they will
have to wash them...

730
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,710
With everything hanging on the
line and nothing hanging on the...

731
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:57,930
You see, sir, it could
be rather awkward.

732
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:02,887
Yes.

733
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:07,564
- Carry on, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

734
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:20,330
I wish I had a decent mirror.

735
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:24,614
Why the Navy still use
that silly clasp?

736
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:26,617
We just found out it's tradition...

737
00:53:26,618 --> 00:53:29,786
each button represents one of
the original thirteen states.

738
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:32,381
Well you better
button up New Jersey.

739
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:35,710
- How's the shirt?
- A little tight.

740
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:39,349
I'd better reinforce those buttons
before you take a deep breath.

741
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,268
The Navy's got to have
some thread, come on.

742
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,404
- Hello.
- Hi.

743
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:58,361
What's wrong?

744
00:53:58,362 --> 00:54:01,157
Kraus does absolutely
nothing for you.

745
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:04,827
You don't put the crown
jewels in a paper bag. Come.

746
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,592
Where are we going?

747
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,712
But I 'm happy with these pants.

748
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:15,631
Barbara, they just won't do.

749
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:16,924
Let me see.

750
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:20,596
- They're not uncomfortable.
- Barbara, will you stop being nervous?

751
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:23,016
- I'm not nervous.
- Well, of course you're nervous.

752
00:54:23,017 --> 00:54:26,061
This is part of my job;
I'm your Supply Officer.

753
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,606
- But I do not need...
- 35-22-34?

754
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:32,198
Then you've got these
supplies before.

755
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:34,663
Let's see...

756
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:36,947
" Shorts ". Do you play tennis?

757
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:40,285
- Well, I...
- Here's a tennis sweater...

758
00:54:40,286 --> 00:54:42,084
a shirt...

759
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:44,372
a nice robe, clean...

760
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:46,626
and also a pair of pyjamas.

761
00:54:46,627 --> 00:54:48,934
- Well, I...
- Excuse me.

762
00:54:49,088 --> 00:54:50,434
Hello.

763
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:53,932
Stovall, aren't you on watch?

764
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,804
Yes. I was just on my way up.

765
00:54:57,805 --> 00:54:59,515
Excuse me.

766
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:01,031
Good night.

767
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:04,202
Now where were we? Oh yes.

768
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:06,948
I think you ought to
try these on for size.

769
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:11,070
Lieutenant, I appreciate the offer
but I can not take your pyjamas.

770
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:12,362
Why not?

771
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:15,909
Well frankly, it's a
little embarrassing.

772
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,547
A girl does not get
into any man's pyjamas.

773
00:55:19,665 --> 00:55:22,000
If the man's not in
them, what's the harm?

774
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:24,224
And what are you going to sleep in?

775
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,258
All right, we'll compromise:..

776
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:30,602
I'll take the bottoms...

777
00:55:30,717 --> 00:55:32,053
And you can have the tops...

778
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:35,407
- unless you prefer...
- The top will be fine.

779
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,779
What else can I give you?

780
00:55:42,524 --> 00:55:43,775
Champagne.

781
00:55:43,776 --> 00:55:47,497
- Under the heading of supplies, too?
- No.

782
00:55:48,406 --> 00:55:51,212
You see, I am also Morale Officer.

783
00:55:51,993 --> 00:55:54,829
You know, it's against regulations
to have this on board.

784
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,886
If we do not drink it,
I will have to pour it out.

785
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:01,420
All we need is a couple
of glasses and some ice.

786
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,463
- Now look, we can't...
- Ramon!

787
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:05,096
Yes, sir?

788
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:07,773
- Thank you.
- Hello.

789
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:10,520
Good night.

790
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:13,392
I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

791
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:15,353
You're an hour early, Mr. Stovall.

792
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:18,410
I couldn't sleep and figured
I might as well come up.

793
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:21,026
Where are your binoculars?

794
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:22,318
In my room.

795
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,707
- Okay, carry on. I'll send them up.
- No, I'll go get them, sir.

796
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,868
- You've just relieved Mr. Watson.
- But you can't do that.

797
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:31,881
And why can't I do that?

798
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:35,304
- Well, because...
- Just what can't I do?

799
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:38,047
- Go to the room.
- Why I can't I go to the room?

800
00:56:38,048 --> 00:56:41,299
Because Mr. Holden is sleeping.

801
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,804
- I'll try not to wake him.
- No! I mean, is, that he...

802
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:49,858
- He has company.
- He's sleeping and he has company?

803
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,795
- Hello.
- Hello.

804
00:57:05,953 --> 00:57:07,370
What are we celebrating?

805
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:11,805
Lieutenant Holden was just
giving me his clothes.

806
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:16,891
That's worth drinking to, but
unfortunately regulations...

807
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,857
Right. I think I'd better be going.

808
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,431
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

809
00:57:23,432 --> 00:57:25,860
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

810
00:57:29,148 --> 00:57:32,316
- Where did you pick up the champagne?
- Captain Henderson's office.

811
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:35,028
I thought it was better
that he keep a clear head.

812
00:57:35,029 --> 00:57:37,254
Very thoughtful of you.

813
00:57:37,823 --> 00:57:41,785
Now I have this unreasonable
desire to get back in the war.

814
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:42,828
Yes, I know, sir.

815
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:46,416
I'd prefer to do it as captain of a
fighting ship not a cocktail bar.

816
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:47,584
As of this moment the
cocktail lounge...

817
00:57:47,585 --> 00:57:49,337
- ...is closed, sir.
- Yes.

818
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:52,215
- No customers after hours.
- Absolutely not.

819
00:57:52,216 --> 00:57:54,144
Fine.

820
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:07,872
That's the idea.

821
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:14,789
Kraus.

822
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,450
Yes?

823
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,796
Which one touched your clothes?

824
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:22,331
I don't know. But I sure hope
it's the one with the big...

825
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,460
- Knock it off.
- What's the matter with you?

826
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:27,379
Quit talking about her that way.

827
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,725
- She's a woman.
- So?

828
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:33,734
- Well my mother is a woman.
- So?

829
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:38,363
I do not know, it just all
seems to tie in somehow.

830
00:58:52,284 --> 00:58:54,036
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

831
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:56,622
I'm having a little trouble.
I can't get it to work...

832
00:58:56,623 --> 00:58:59,466
I think there is something
wrong with that shower head.

833
00:59:02,213 --> 00:59:03,505
- Try this.
- Captain...

834
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,008
I'd like to apologize for setting
off the collision alarm.

835
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:10,304
That's all right. Tell me, did
you follow the instructions?

836
00:59:10,305 --> 00:59:12,723
Yes, I turned this knob

837
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:14,185
and this one...

838
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:16,696
and then this.

839
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:24,279
- At least I think that's what I did.
- Yes, that's what you did.

840
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,365
- Oh dear.
- That's okay.

841
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:29,719
- Let me dry you off.
- No, please.

842
00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:33,414
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

843
00:59:33,415 --> 00:59:36,085
That's a clever shower schedule
you've got worked out, sir.

844
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:38,171
Conserves water, too.

845
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:41,757
- Lt. Crandall was having difficulty.
- Sir, it's your boat.

846
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,439
Excuse me.

847
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:50,059
It's just as well it didn't work.
I left my dusting powder in my room.

848
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,604
- Your dusting powder.
- Would you hold that for me? Be right back.

849
00:59:53,605 --> 00:59:55,948
Terrible.

850
00:59:58,444 --> 00:59:59,611
Good morning, sir.

851
00:59:59,612 --> 01:00:01,114
- Good morning.
- Can I get you anything?

852
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:03,459
- Yes, anything.
- Yes, sir.

853
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,498
- My dusting powder.
- I see.

854
01:00:09,499 --> 01:00:12,091
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

855
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,421
- Wait, Captain. Sir!
- What is it?

856
01:00:15,422 --> 01:00:17,507
There's a woman in my engine room.

857
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:20,009
- You have to get her out.
- Who?

858
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,973
The Major. She washed her clothes
and hung them there to dry.

859
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:27,103
It's bad luck to have a
woman in the engine room.

860
01:00:27,104 --> 01:00:29,522
Tostin, what harm can
their clothes do?

861
01:00:29,523 --> 01:00:31,897
That's when they're
dangerous, like snakes...

862
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:33,608
when they shed their
skin... look out.

863
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:36,029
Can I have my scrubber please?

864
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,280
Yes, here you go.

865
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:39,790
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

866
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:43,162
Tostin, they have to dry
their clothes somewhere...

867
01:00:43,163 --> 01:00:45,832
and yours is the most logical place.
Deal with it as best you can.

868
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:48,640
- Yes, Captain.
- Carry on.

869
01:01:02,102 --> 01:01:05,490
- Sailor.
- Yes, ma'am.

870
01:01:07,024 --> 01:01:09,151
Tell me when these are dry.

871
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:12,112
I'm a machinist mate, I ain't a...

872
01:01:12,113 --> 01:01:14,198
laundry sailor.

873
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:16,909
- Sailor.
- Yes, ma'am.

874
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,911
Please try not to knock
anything down...

875
01:01:18,912 --> 01:01:21,873
I wouldn't want it to
land on this dirty floor.

876
01:01:21,874 --> 01:01:25,844
- What's dirty?
- The whole engine room.

877
01:01:29,633 --> 01:01:31,259
Look at that grease.

878
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,638
If you was bombed and sunk
and pulled up by your stern...

879
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:37,112
you'd be a little greasy too.

880
01:01:51,992 --> 01:01:53,202
Sailor.

881
01:01:53,203 --> 01:01:55,495
- Lady!
- You'll never get it to work that way.

882
01:01:55,496 --> 01:01:58,497
Why don't you go and
roll some bandages?

883
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:01,626
- What do you know about machinery?
- I was raised with it.

884
01:02:01,627 --> 01:02:05,433
My father was Chief Engineer
at the Seattle power plant.

885
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:10,553
That would work if you'd
install a new valve spring.

886
01:02:10,554 --> 01:02:12,555
My father was a Chief Engineer...

887
01:02:12,556 --> 01:02:16,601
I'm trying to make do with something
that doesn't belong on a submarine...

888
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:21,108
and you can't install a new valve
spring if you ain't got it.

889
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:23,236
Now, will you get out of here?

890
01:02:23,237 --> 01:02:25,446
You're talking to an officer.

891
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:29,035
Maybe Congress made you an officer,
but God made you a woman...

892
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:32,079
and a woman shouldn't mess
around with a man's machinery.

893
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,839
For the last time,
get out, will you?

894
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:41,882
Good morning, sir. Can I
pour you a cup of coffee?

895
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,009
- Never mind, I'll attend to it. Go and shower.
- Yes, sir.

896
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,102
- Have the women finished breakfast?
- Yes, sir.

897
01:03:14,587 --> 01:03:16,516
Pardon me.

898
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:23,771
I left my cigarette here.
Have you seen it?

899
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:27,781
Perhaps?

900
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:32,107
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

901
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,578
Oh, that's alright, Lieutenant.
I enjoy a cigarette with my coffee.

902
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:43,588
Oh, thanks.

903
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:49,835
Is that all you're
having for breakfast?

904
01:03:49,836 --> 01:03:53,142
I'm a little nervous.
I don't feel much like eating.

905
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:57,510
Captain, I hope you do not mind a
little professional advice but...

906
01:03:57,511 --> 01:04:00,306
when a person is nervous
and irritable...

907
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:02,975
you can be assured that something
is missing in their life.

908
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:05,603
- Vitamins and minerals.
- Vitamins and minerals.

909
01:04:05,604 --> 01:04:09,317
With an appropriate nutritional balance,
you wouldn't have any gray hair.

910
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:12,945
I like having gray hair, so I
can worry without it showing.

911
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:15,822
- I used to be just like you.
- What, gray hair?

912
01:04:15,823 --> 01:04:19,577
- No. I was run down and poor appetite.
- Yes?

913
01:04:19,578 --> 01:04:22,498
Then I started taking these
pills that I have here...

914
01:04:22,499 --> 01:04:25,210
- ...and they really built me up.
- No question about it.

915
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:27,587
All you have to do is take
one every three hours.

916
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:30,883
You are very kind,
I appreciate the offer...

917
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:34,137
- ...but I'm busy man and would forget.
- I'll remind you.

918
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:36,931
You're the Captain and it would
be bad if you got sick too.

919
01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:38,141
Sick too!

920
01:04:38,142 --> 01:04:39,810
Who's sick?

921
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:43,827
Most of the men. Lieutenants Colfax
and Reid are taking care of them.

922
01:04:44,983 --> 01:04:47,909
Lt. Crandall, excuse me.

923
01:04:50,948 --> 01:04:53,449
- You look pretty good to me.
- I don't feel so good.

924
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:56,745
- Stomach, and I feel dizzy.
- Hold still.

925
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:59,456
Lie down over there.

926
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:01,304
Keep that under your tongue.

927
01:05:01,376 --> 01:05:04,470
- All right.
- Just go over there.

928
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,217
Right. Now, what's
the matter with you?

929
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:09,969
- Williams.
- I've got a headache and my back hurts...

930
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,637
What's wrong?

931
01:05:11,638 --> 01:05:14,890
I don't know, sir. I feel terrible.

932
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:16,773
You smell good.

933
01:05:17,562 --> 01:05:19,194
What about you, Harmon?

934
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,566
I have shooting pains
in my head, sir.

935
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:25,205
- Probably fumes from that hair tonic.
- Yes, sir.

936
01:05:26,615 --> 01:05:29,884
And you, Fox. What have you got on?

937
01:05:30,036 --> 01:05:32,509
It's called " Surrender ", sir.

938
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,872
My mother sent it to me.

939
01:05:34,873 --> 01:05:39,640
Break it up. Neutralize that
cologne with a some perspiration.

940
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:50,307
Even our pharmacist's mate.

941
01:05:50,308 --> 01:05:52,185
What's the matter, Dooley?

942
01:05:52,186 --> 01:05:53,852
- He seems to have...
- Just a minute.

943
01:05:53,853 --> 01:05:55,562
I don't know, sir.

944
01:05:55,563 --> 01:05:58,372
I only hope I can last the day out.

945
01:06:00,029 --> 01:06:02,086
Up, Dooley!

946
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:07,710
Thank you, ladies. We won't be needing
you any more. The epidemic is over.

947
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:15,481
- Lieutenant Crandall.
- You forgot your vitamins.

948
01:06:15,482 --> 01:06:16,441
Thank you very much.

949
01:06:16,442 --> 01:06:18,736
I'll remind you when it's
time for the next one.

950
01:06:18,737 --> 01:06:20,168
Yes.

951
01:06:23,242 --> 01:06:24,838
Sir.

952
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:35,472
Lieutenant Crandall, I...

953
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:40,510
- Mr. Watson.
- Yes, sir?

954
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,931
Pass the word to the crew. When Lt.
Crandall... you know Lt. Crandall?

955
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:48,313
When Lt. Crandall walks through any
part of the boat, give clear passage.

956
01:06:48,314 --> 01:06:51,482
- Right, sir.
- How's Mr. Holden coming with the torpedoes?

957
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:55,154
I decided he would make better headway if
he read the basic submarine manual first.

958
01:06:55,155 --> 01:06:57,795
- It's in his cabin reading.
- Good.

959
01:06:58,034 --> 01:07:00,326
- Am I going down right?
- That's right.

960
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:02,912
- Is she going down right?
- She sure is.

961
01:07:02,913 --> 01:07:04,789
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

962
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:08,926
Mr. Holden is explaining
how everything works.

963
01:07:09,879 --> 01:07:13,589
- He's been explaining?
- We're just on our way to the engine room.

964
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,803
I 'm afraid Mr. Holden won't be
able to maneuver this morning.

965
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:20,515
- Don't you have a book to read?
- Yes, I'm on Chapter Five:..

966
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:22,893
- "Care and Operation of the Bilge Pump"
- All right.

967
01:07:22,894 --> 01:07:24,478
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

968
01:07:24,479 --> 01:07:27,692
You'll like it. It turns out happily;
they get each other in the end.

969
01:07:27,693 --> 01:07:29,317
Engine Room to Captain.

970
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:30,611
What is it, Tostin?

971
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:33,446
Either her or me in
this engine room!

972
01:07:33,447 --> 01:07:35,424
I'll be right there.

973
01:07:38,061 --> 01:07:41,231
It works. You're just to
stubborn to admit it.

974
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:44,240
Get that thing out
of my engine room!

975
01:07:48,073 --> 01:07:51,658
- Look, Major... enough is enough...
- What's going on?

976
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:52,994
Look at what she did, sir.

977
01:07:52,995 --> 01:07:55,497
It's only temporary until
we make a valve spring.

978
01:07:55,498 --> 01:07:59,251
- We?? What do you mean we??
- I will design it and you can make it up.

979
01:07:59,252 --> 01:08:01,170
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

980
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:03,215
What are you going to do, sir?

981
01:08:03,216 --> 01:08:05,008
I don't know. It works, doesn't it?

982
01:08:05,009 --> 01:08:08,054
But I'm here all day and that
thing going up and down...

983
01:08:08,055 --> 01:08:10,232
- ...that's indecent.
- Well.

984
01:08:11,182 --> 01:08:14,267
- Engine room. Is the Captain there?
- What is it, Molumphry?

985
01:08:14,268 --> 01:08:17,399
- Better come up to the yeoman's office, sir.
- What's wrong?

986
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,233
Lieutenant Reid just hit Hunkle.

987
01:08:20,234 --> 01:08:23,872
Hit Hunkle? I'll be right there.
Hit Hunkle.

988
01:08:23,947 --> 01:08:27,835
- What are you to do about her?
- Keep an eye on it, Tostin.

989
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:30,204
I'm sure it wasn't
intentional, ma'am.

990
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:34,175
I know, but I've never seen
anything like that in a man.

991
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:37,933
Mr. Hunkle?

992
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:41,884
I'm sorry.

993
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,470
That's all right, Lieutenant.

994
01:08:43,471 --> 01:08:45,639
- Sir.
- What happened?

995
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,891
- It was nothing, really.
- Then why did you hit him?

996
01:08:47,892 --> 01:08:50,351
It was my fault, sir,
I was changing my shirt...

997
01:08:50,352 --> 01:08:54,189
- I went to borrow the typewriter.
- I had my shirt off and she hit me.

998
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:58,955
It was a reflex action.
I was embarrassed and I...

999
01:08:59,155 --> 01:09:01,213
If you'll excuse me.

1000
01:09:02,576 --> 01:09:06,037
Hunkle, keep that pinup covered,
I've got enough troubles.

1001
01:09:06,038 --> 01:09:08,623
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, torpedo room calling the Captain.

1002
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:11,125
- What is it, Harmon?
- What do I do with Lt. Colfax?

1003
01:09:11,126 --> 01:09:12,460
What's wrong?

1004
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:16,256
She's dizzy, sir. I think she's getting seasick.
She insists she's got the bends.

1005
01:09:16,257 --> 01:09:18,233
I'll be right there.

1006
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:31,120
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes.

1007
01:09:39,536 --> 01:09:42,627
It's amazing how
compact everything is.

1008
01:09:43,499 --> 01:09:47,432
On a sub you have to
operate in close quarters.

1009
01:09:48,754 --> 01:09:51,642
- I think we better be going.
- Going where?

1010
01:09:51,965 --> 01:09:54,892
Well, Nick, haven't you
got some reading to do?

1011
01:09:55,719 --> 01:09:57,471
How old are you, Barbara?

1012
01:09:57,472 --> 01:09:58,931
Twenty-four.

1013
01:09:58,932 --> 01:10:03,645
A very nervous twenty-four.
Look at yourself. You're tense.

1014
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:06,899
Your pulse is beating fast
and your hands are cold.

1015
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,541
We've got to do something
about all this tension.

1016
01:10:09,653 --> 01:10:12,744
I'm afraid that the cure might
be worse than the disease.

1017
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,467
Barbara, you're a nurse, you
know it is with people.

1018
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:19,842
They're like that teapot;...

1019
01:10:20,165 --> 01:10:23,637
build a fire under it,
pressure builds...

1020
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,312
and has to be relieved.

1021
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:42,404
- Mr. Holden, return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:47,448
Captain, it wasn't his fault...

1023
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:49,407
I encouraged him.

1024
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:50,615
Lieutenant...

1025
01:10:50,616 --> 01:10:54,549
the last thing the men on this
boat need is encouragement.

1026
01:10:55,914 --> 01:10:59,849
Major, if you can't control
your women, lock them up.

1027
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:05,646
What happened?

1028
01:11:05,968 --> 01:11:07,564
He caught us.

1029
01:11:08,137 --> 01:11:09,818
Doing what?

1030
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,111
Nick kissed me.

1031
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:14,910
- Oh?
- And I kissed him back.

1032
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,034
Don't you think you're
rushing things?

1033
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:23,325
Love underwater is fine
for a fish, but...

1034
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:26,130
shouldn't you wait until
you come up for air?

1035
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:32,090
Major, my mother had a very
simple outlook on life.

1036
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:35,250
She always said: "never worry
about getting married...

1037
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:38,556
someday you'll turn the right
corner and meet the right man."

1038
01:11:38,755 --> 01:11:40,637
It isn't that easy.

1039
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:43,774
I've been turning corners
for twenty-four years.

1040
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:47,474
You know, I think I finally
turned the right one?

1041
01:11:47,475 --> 01:11:51,435
Why go back out in that
crowd and get lost again?

1042
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:55,440
Baby, if you're right, I'm in
more trouble than I figured.

1043
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,916
You're 24 and I'm 38.

1044
01:11:57,944 --> 01:12:01,085
You know, I might not be able
to make it to the next corner?

1045
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:02,240
Mister...

1046
01:12:02,241 --> 01:12:06,580
You've used that uniform for everything
but what the government intended.

1047
01:12:06,581 --> 01:12:08,664
Why you got the uniform
is your concern...

1048
01:12:08,665 --> 01:12:11,124
but what it does on this
boat is my business.

1049
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:15,087
From here on, if that uniform leaves
this cabin, don't be in it.

1050
01:12:15,088 --> 01:12:17,019
You're confined to quarters.

1051
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:21,315
- Battle stations!
- Goodbye!

1052
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:36,788
Boy oh boy.

1053
01:12:39,367 --> 01:12:41,760
A sitting duck, sir.

1054
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:46,542
A tanker.

1055
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:47,750
A beaut.

1056
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:49,670
Eight thousand tons at least.

1057
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:53,007
She's riding low, sir.
That means she's still loaded.

1058
01:12:53,008 --> 01:12:55,427
Number three tube is operable, sir.

1059
01:12:55,428 --> 01:12:57,820
All we need is one shot.

1060
01:12:57,847 --> 01:13:01,484
This boat wasn't meant
to be a virgin, sir.

1061
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:08,990
Eight thousand tons.

1062
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:14,834
Let's go duck hunting.
Down scope.

1063
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:19,835
- Load torpedo tube three.
- Load torpedo tube three.

1064
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:33,777
- Bearing. Mark.
- Zero-two-six.

1065
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:41,282
- Range. Mark.
- Two-three-double-oh.

1066
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,285
Down scope.

1067
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:46,067
Fire at 1500 yards.

1068
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:48,488
Tube number three ready, sir.
Outer door closed.

1069
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:50,656
Generated range: two-one-double-oh.

1070
01:13:50,657 --> 01:13:54,202
- Open outer door tube three.
- Open outer door tube three.

1071
01:13:54,203 --> 01:13:56,546
Open outer door tube three.

1072
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:05,216
- Tube number three ready, sir.
- One-nine-double-oh.

1073
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:07,062
Final range.

1074
01:14:17,397 --> 01:14:20,488
- Mark.
- One-eight-double-oh.

1075
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:28,043
- Stand by tube three.
- Stand by tube three.

1076
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:35,249
- Captain, it's time for your vitamin.
- Lieutenant, get below.

1077
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,310
Damn it, get below!

1078
01:14:45,178 --> 01:14:47,108
Have I done anything wrong?

1079
01:15:02,157 --> 01:15:04,367
What happened, sir?

1080
01:15:04,368 --> 01:15:06,796
We sunk a truck!

1081
01:15:16,173 --> 01:15:18,397
Let's get the hell out of here!

1082
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:23,597
Right full rudder.

1083
01:15:23,598 --> 01:15:26,691
- All ahead two thirds.
- Take her down to 100 feet.

1084
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:36,488
23 December, 1941.

1085
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:39,783
Sighted tanker, sank truck.

1086
01:15:39,784 --> 01:15:43,830
For the first time in my life, I
came close to hitting a woman.

1087
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:46,040
Perhaps I'm giving
way to hysteria...

1088
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:50,473
but can Lt. Crandall possibly
be a Japanese agent?

1089
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:54,256
Tomorrow we'll be in Cebu and
they'll be the Army's problem.

1090
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:57,344
I'm sorry, Commander.
They are your problem.

1091
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:00,433
I can not take responsibility
for those women...

1092
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:02,435
not without the proper orders.

1093
01:16:02,436 --> 01:16:05,604
Couldn't we forget regulations
this once, Colonel?

1094
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:10,191
Commander, any time the Japanese are
ready, they can overrun this island.

1095
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:13,321
We've been ordered to coordinate
guerrilla action in the hills.

1096
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:15,616
We may be up there for years.

1097
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:18,708
Do you really want us
to take those women?

1098
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:27,890
We'll keep them.

1099
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:31,758
Sir, we will need to see your
Quartermaster to get these...

1100
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:33,760
supplies to make our repairs.

1101
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:37,933
Supplies? Let me give you
a picture of the situation;...

1102
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:41,687
this cigar... belonged to
my aide, Captain Hopkins.

1103
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:44,065
I stole it while he was sleeping.

1104
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:47,569
Everything worth saving has
been taken up into the hills.

1105
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,571
Can I can send some men
into the hills then?

1106
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:52,574
You couldn't get a paper clip with
a requisition from the President.

1107
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:57,092
- Without those supplies we won't get out of here.
- Sorry, I wish I could help.

1108
01:16:57,206 --> 01:16:58,839
Alright.

1109
01:16:59,376 --> 01:17:01,221
Good luck, gentlemen!

1110
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:07,391
- We've got to get those supplies!
- I know, I know.

1111
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:12,065
Sorry!

1112
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:22,034
- Oh boy!
- Give him a hand.

1113
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:27,496
Major, you and your friends
will remain aboard.

1114
01:17:31,662 --> 01:17:34,551
Sir! Sir!

1115
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:38,462
There is only one man who can
do the job, you know who.

1116
01:17:38,463 --> 01:17:41,185
Yes, yes. I know.

1117
01:17:47,765 --> 01:17:49,057
Mr. Holden.

1118
01:17:49,058 --> 01:17:50,737
Yes, sir?

1119
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,946
I'm restoring you to duty.

1120
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:59,069
We're having difficulty, I have
to have those supplies.

1121
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:01,212
That's quite a list, sir.

1122
01:18:01,406 --> 01:18:05,242
I won't bore you with the problems of
command; I doubt you'll ever have one.

1123
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:08,455
It's inconsistent with the philosophy
of "every man for himself".

1124
01:18:08,456 --> 01:18:10,706
"Dog-eat-dog."
- Exactly.

1125
01:18:10,707 --> 01:18:12,792
The most unfortunate
thing about command...

1126
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:15,546
is that responsibilities
outweigh the privileges.

1127
01:18:15,547 --> 01:18:19,091
If it was just myself, I would
tell what to do with that list.

1128
01:18:19,092 --> 01:18:21,178
But my responsibility is this boat.

1129
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:23,972
To get it out of here I'd
make a pact with the devil.

1130
01:18:23,973 --> 01:18:25,891
- That's where I come in.
- That's right.

1131
01:18:25,892 --> 01:18:28,894
Unless you get these supplies, you'll never
get back to that girl with the railway stock.

1132
01:18:28,895 --> 01:18:31,606
- That's a pretty good argument.
- I thought it would convince you.

1133
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:33,452
Okay.

1134
01:18:43,413 --> 01:18:48,555
Auxiliary induction gear;
generator coils; red lead... Ramon!

1135
01:19:19,037 --> 01:19:20,753
Hunkle!

1136
01:19:22,707 --> 01:19:23,999
Do you need this?

1137
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,961
- A priming pump?
- Is that what it is?

1138
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:30,261
- Worth a hundred fifty dollars.
- For this?

1139
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:34,151
- Here's two hundred dollars.
- Oh, thank you.

1140
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:54,034
What do you want for this?

1141
01:19:54,035 --> 01:19:56,120
- Twenty.
- Take twenty-five. Hunkle!

1142
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:57,913
You'll have to get in line
like the rest of the guys.

1143
01:19:57,914 --> 01:20:00,757
But I have gray paint
in the truck outside.

1144
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,127
Twenty-four five-gallon cans.

1145
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:06,466
- What about the red lead?
- Two cans. That's all there is on the island.

1146
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:08,884
We need at least twenty.

1147
01:20:08,885 --> 01:20:12,856
- I can get them white lead.
- We'll take it. How much?

1148
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:15,518
Not a nickel less
than three hundred.

1149
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,896
Three hundred?
He drives a hard bargain!

1150
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:22,900
Here's three hundred, and fifty
dollars on the house. Kraus!

1151
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,944
Unload the paint and
steal the truck.

1152
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,989
- Excuse me, sir.
- Wait a minute.

1153
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:30,700
We don't have any money, how
will we pay if someone wins?

1154
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:33,676
With those tables
and those dealers?

1155
01:20:36,376 --> 01:20:40,141
Master inverted reducing valve.

1156
01:20:40,754 --> 01:20:42,731
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

1157
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:44,216
Next!

1158
01:20:44,217 --> 01:20:45,934
What you have you got, son?

1159
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,439
Carry on.

1160
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:54,937
31 December, 1941.

1161
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:59,108
Holden has reached new heights
in the art of scavenging.

1162
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:01,571
Like a spider in a
web, he sits there...

1163
01:21:01,572 --> 01:21:04,699
and their victims come to him
like flies bearing gifts.

1164
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,536
He is the only man I know...

1165
01:21:06,537 --> 01:21:10,801
who will probably be presented the
Navy Cross at his court martial.

1166
01:21:24,806 --> 01:21:29,452
- Chief, this is a terrible color.
- It makes me kind of sick.

1167
01:21:36,237 --> 01:21:37,946
More canned fish.

1168
01:21:37,947 --> 01:21:41,500
Yes. What a way to
celebrate New Year's Eve.

1169
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:43,035
Sir...

1170
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:46,330
We're mixing those paints...
but I don't think you're going to like it.

1171
01:21:46,331 --> 01:21:48,083
We don't have much choice.

1172
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:51,085
We haven't enough of either
one to do the whole job.

1173
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:53,464
It's a pretty strange color
to paint government property.

1174
01:21:53,465 --> 01:21:54,924
Don't let it throw you, Mo.

1175
01:21:54,925 --> 01:21:57,982
- We're going to color gray anyway.
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,640
Mr. Holden wasn't at the casino.

1177
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,017
Mr. Stovall...

1178
01:22:04,018 --> 01:22:08,649
hereafter you will refer to the
casino as the supply depot.

1179
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:09,941
Where did he go?

1180
01:22:09,942 --> 01:22:13,912
He and Hunkle took off in the truck,
They're not expected back until late.

1181
01:22:14,406 --> 01:22:16,865
Boy, that casino is really...

1182
01:22:16,866 --> 01:22:18,493
I mean...

1183
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:23,506
seems to be a lot of activity
at the supply depot, sir.

1184
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,810
Hunkle, did you see what I saw?

1185
01:22:40,811 --> 01:22:42,562
I don't know, sir.
What?

1186
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:44,361
Come on.

1187
01:23:17,811 --> 01:23:20,939
- That's New Year's dinner.
- That?

1188
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:24,328
We're going to shop around.
Come on.

1189
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,257
What do we do?

1190
01:23:42,508 --> 01:23:45,018
No, that's not quite right.

1191
01:23:45,552 --> 01:23:47,184
The white one!

1192
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,055
That's what I call a pig.

1193
01:23:50,056 --> 01:23:54,270
I'll go around the back. Go
in the front and distract him.

1194
01:23:54,271 --> 01:23:55,729
And how do I do that?

1195
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:59,192
- Talk pig talk.
- How do you talk pig talk?

1196
01:23:59,193 --> 01:24:01,787
Didn't you talk pig
when you were a kid?

1197
01:24:03,156 --> 01:24:06,082
No, too high.
Low, deep in your throat.

1198
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:09,497
That's too deep.

1199
01:24:09,498 --> 01:24:11,924
Right in the middle.

1200
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:13,805
Now with affection.

1201
01:24:17,046 --> 01:24:19,437
Okay, call the pig.

1202
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:25,315
Look, there he is.

1203
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:32,362
Get behind him. Behind him!

1204
01:24:43,285 --> 01:24:45,328
Hurry!

1205
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:48,601
Open the cab!

1206
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,226
Open the door, come on!

1207
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:00,142
- Come on!
- Looks like a wheelbarrow.

1208
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:07,905
Come on, Hunkle, grab him!

1209
01:25:10,566 --> 01:25:12,198
Lift him up!

1210
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:16,822
Grab him!

1211
01:25:16,823 --> 01:25:19,297
Get in! Get in!

1212
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:24,384
- Grab him!
- Okay.

1213
01:25:55,576 --> 01:25:57,160
What are they stopping for?

1214
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:59,706
It's a roadblock.
What are we going to do?

1215
01:25:59,707 --> 01:26:01,082
I don't know.

1216
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:03,677
Let's take a look. Cover us, Bayle.

1217
01:26:05,547 --> 01:26:08,925
- They're shooting looters, you know?
- I know. Let's not panic.

1218
01:26:08,926 --> 01:26:10,855
What about the pig?

1219
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:15,181
- What pig?
- What pig? This pig!

1220
01:26:15,182 --> 01:26:17,351
- I don't see any pig.
- You don't see any pig?

1221
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:18,478
Take off your coat.

1222
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:20,855
- Take off my coat?
- Take off your coat.

1223
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:22,737
Are you out of...

1224
01:26:24,527 --> 01:26:25,944
Put it on the pig.

1225
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:28,656
- Put it on the pig??
- Put it on the pig!

1226
01:26:28,657 --> 01:26:31,325
- Do you have a cap? Do you have a cap?
- Yes, sir.

1227
01:26:31,326 --> 01:26:32,952
Take it off!

1228
01:26:32,953 --> 01:26:36,092
Give me the cap! Give it to me!

1229
01:26:40,421 --> 01:26:43,940
Hold him!

1230
01:26:44,426 --> 01:26:46,818
Stay here, Bill, and
keep me covered.

1231
01:26:58,857 --> 01:27:01,735
- Good evening, Corporal.
- What are you doing out here?

1232
01:27:01,736 --> 01:27:05,157
I'm Lieutenant Holden, off the
"Sea Tiger". We're tied up for repairs.

1233
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:08,962
We were out trying to locate
some spare diesel parts.

1234
01:27:09,538 --> 01:27:10,704
What is that?

1235
01:27:10,705 --> 01:27:14,306
That's Seaman Hornsby. How
are you feeling, Seaman Hornsby?

1236
01:27:15,334 --> 01:27:18,254
- He's not too well.
- What's the matter with him?

1237
01:27:18,255 --> 01:27:21,181
Well, he drinks...

1238
01:27:21,509 --> 01:27:24,721
"Gilly juice" you know?
The alcohol from the torpedoes.

1239
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:28,225
Easy, sailor. I think we're going to
have to get him back to the boat.

1240
01:27:28,226 --> 01:27:30,769
If anything happens to him we're
in an awful lot of trouble.

1241
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:33,742
You see, he's the only
radio operator we have.

1242
01:27:34,065 --> 01:27:36,443
- Easy, Hornsby.
- He doesn't look too good.

1243
01:27:36,444 --> 01:27:39,126
- No.
- You'd better let us take him to the hospital.

1244
01:27:39,697 --> 01:27:42,908
No, no. That's not necessary.
We have a doctor on board.

1245
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:46,245
- Well, you'd better get this man to your doctor.
- All right. Thank you.

1246
01:27:46,246 --> 01:27:49,055
- Happy New Year, Corporal.
- Let them pass.

1247
01:27:58,386 --> 01:28:01,554
- Who were they?
- Three sailors off a submarine.

1248
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:04,600
Guy named Hornsby was sick,
you should have seen him.

1249
01:28:04,601 --> 01:28:07,520
Now I know why they call
submarines "pig boats".

1250
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:10,197
Man, he was the ugliest.

1251
01:28:12,985 --> 01:28:14,361
Oh, Captain...

1252
01:28:14,362 --> 01:28:17,834
a couple of Army MPs out
here want to see you.

1253
01:28:18,283 --> 01:28:21,637
- MPs?
- MPs.

1254
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,348
Okay, okay.

1255
01:28:29,339 --> 01:28:32,340
Sir, this man claims that your
men stole a pig from his farm.

1256
01:28:36,804 --> 01:28:39,724
The biggest one he had, and
drove off in a truck;...

1257
01:28:39,725 --> 01:28:42,394
The only truck that passed us
tonight was headed for this boat.

1258
01:28:42,395 --> 01:28:46,115
That's ridiculous, Corporal. None
of my men would...

1259
01:28:46,232 --> 01:28:49,705
- Is Lieutenant Holden back?
- I do not know, sir.

1260
01:28:50,779 --> 01:28:52,405
Who?
Corporal.

1261
01:28:52,406 --> 01:28:54,156
- Good evening, sir.
- Watson.

1262
01:28:54,157 --> 01:28:57,827
Lt. Holden was one of the men on the
truck. He had two other men with him...

1263
01:28:57,828 --> 01:29:00,080
A Hunkle and Seaman Hornsby.

1264
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:01,498
Seaman Hornsby?

1265
01:29:01,499 --> 01:29:04,723
Yes, sir, he was drunk. They were
bringing him back to the boat.

1266
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:08,883
Where is Seaman Hornsby?

1267
01:29:08,884 --> 01:29:12,511
- He's not feeling too well, sir.
- I didn't ask you that. Where is he?

1268
01:29:12,512 --> 01:29:15,681
- He's been drinking.
- Where is he?

1269
01:29:15,682 --> 01:29:17,743
In the officer's head.

1270
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,155
Just a minute.

1271
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:39,794
Well, the man is right.
Undoubtedly his pig was stolen.

1272
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:42,046
You might as well admit it,
Mr. Holden ;...

1273
01:29:42,047 --> 01:29:45,216
When Hornsby runs wild there's
no telling what he might do.

1274
01:29:45,217 --> 01:29:47,677
He behaves like a perfect swine.

1275
01:29:47,678 --> 01:29:51,389
Look, Corporal, he's in no condition
to be reprimanded tonight...

1276
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:54,935
but I can assure you that tomorrow
he's in for a good roasting!

1277
01:29:54,936 --> 01:29:57,647
I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid
we'll have to take him in.

1278
01:29:57,648 --> 01:29:59,577
Now wait a minute, Corporal.

1279
01:30:00,234 --> 01:30:02,993
Sometimes there is a
reason for drinking...

1280
01:30:03,613 --> 01:30:07,576
You see, Hornsby's been picked
for a dangerous assignment...

1281
01:30:07,577 --> 01:30:10,620
and there is not much chance that
he will come through it alive.

1282
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:13,629
- Gee, I...
- I knew you would understand.

1283
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:16,168
If this man want to
drop the charges...

1284
01:30:16,169 --> 01:30:19,212
I'm sure something can be arranged.
How much is the pig worth?

1285
01:30:21,007 --> 01:30:24,147
He won't take American money
with the Japanese coming.

1286
01:30:25,264 --> 01:30:29,363
One moment. Your pig's
not down there. Hey...

1287
01:30:29,686 --> 01:30:33,619
If you won't take American money I
don't see how we are going to...

1288
01:30:35,608 --> 01:30:37,752
You like that?

1289
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:41,114
You would like to have that?

1290
01:30:41,115 --> 01:30:42,914
Okay.

1291
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:47,002
I do not understand
very well, we'll see.

1292
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:50,458
I think he said he likes the bag.
You like the bag?

1293
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:53,461
Good leather, but he does not know
what to do with those things.

1294
01:30:53,462 --> 01:30:57,507
- Well, we can make a deal.
- But sir, that was a gift...

1295
01:30:57,508 --> 01:31:01,193
- from the admiral's wife.
- Public Relations. Fair enough?

1296
01:31:05,643 --> 01:31:08,229
He said that his pig is worth more.

1297
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,979
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1298
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:12,621
- You couldn't possibly...
- See if you like this.

1299
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:15,208
- But sir, you can't. I have...
- Do you like?

1300
01:31:18,575 --> 01:31:20,993
Sir, I need that for
my tennis shoulder.

1301
01:31:20,994 --> 01:31:22,620
- Your tennis shoulder?
- Yes.

1302
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:24,998
Well, we can take care of that.

1303
01:31:24,999 --> 01:31:28,517
Now you don't need it for your tennis
shoulder. Now, what about it?

1304
01:31:33,383 --> 01:31:35,385
- Oh, yes.
- What did he say?

1305
01:31:35,386 --> 01:31:38,473
He said that his pig weighed
two hundred pounds.

1306
01:31:38,474 --> 01:31:41,099
- And it is not enough.
- I see. That's it, yes.

1307
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,109
- It's a shame.
- Just a minute. Get back.

1308
01:31:45,522 --> 01:31:47,191
Let's see here.

1309
01:31:47,192 --> 01:31:48,901
Yes, this.

1310
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:52,170
Sir, that's solid silver.

1311
01:31:52,863 --> 01:31:57,048
Still not enough?
Let's look here...

1312
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:00,789
Oh, these!

1313
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:04,095
Non-regulation!

1314
01:32:07,549 --> 01:32:11,065
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1315
01:32:14,972 --> 01:32:16,403
Well?

1316
01:32:17,059 --> 01:32:19,652
Put it on your face.

1317
01:32:19,937 --> 01:32:21,104
Shoes!

1318
01:32:21,105 --> 01:32:24,608
- Shoes. Yes.
- Not my Supadance. Sir, please.

1319
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:26,527
- These are your dancing shoes, aren't they?
- Yes.

1320
01:32:26,528 --> 01:32:28,364
Do you like to dance?

1321
01:32:28,365 --> 01:32:30,124
Dance?

1322
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:36,845
He likes to dance, perfect.
Is that enough?

1323
01:32:37,081 --> 01:32:39,342
Goodbye. Here, just a moment.

1324
01:32:39,752 --> 01:32:43,188
Here's gift for you. That's to go
with the shoes; a little bonus.

1325
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,602
Well.

1326
01:32:48,094 --> 01:32:52,056
Very thoughtful of you to offer dinner
for the men. I'm sure they'll appreciate it.

1327
01:32:52,057 --> 01:32:56,406
I suggest you get Hornsby out of
uniform and help him to the galley.

1328
01:33:02,152 --> 01:33:03,952
So am I.

1329
01:33:22,551 --> 01:33:26,153
Yes, they're drafting
everybody these days.

1330
01:33:48,121 --> 01:33:49,637
Pink!

1331
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:52,425
Twenty-five years I've
been in the Navy...

1332
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,392
and I've never seen
nothing like this.

1333
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:58,481
A pink submarine.

1334
01:34:01,555 --> 01:34:05,434
All right, you guys, you have three
hours to have a Happy New Year.

1335
01:34:05,435 --> 01:34:09,618
But at 17:00 every man on this
crew starts painting her gray!

1336
01:34:31,046 --> 01:34:33,714
This pork is great. Aren't
you going to have any, sir?

1337
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:37,568
No, Hornsby and I have been
through too much together.

1338
01:34:38,888 --> 01:34:41,683
- Captain, can I talk to you?
- Yes, Major.

1339
01:34:41,684 --> 01:34:44,145
It's about Dolores. I can't
get her to come up here.

1340
01:34:44,146 --> 01:34:46,405
She says that you'd
rather she didn't.

1341
01:34:47,065 --> 01:34:50,859
She's tried to apologize, but
you won't even talk to her.

1342
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:54,406
- She thinks that you've been avoiding her.
- Only in self-defence.

1343
01:34:54,407 --> 01:34:56,585
She's scared to death of you.

1344
01:34:57,619 --> 01:34:59,954
It's New Year's, Captain.

1345
01:34:59,955 --> 01:35:02,798
The poor girl is down
there all by herself.

1346
01:35:02,876 --> 01:35:05,628
It would be nice if you would
go down and invite her up.

1347
01:35:05,629 --> 01:35:08,981
All right, Major, I'll extend
a personal invitation.

1348
01:35:12,468 --> 01:35:15,145
Isn't this a lovely shade of pink.

1349
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:19,988
Please ma'am, I'm trying to eat.

1350
01:35:20,438 --> 01:35:22,647
- Throw me a pickle.
- The first time I met her...

1351
01:35:22,648 --> 01:35:24,774
- Mr. Tostin, was...
- Chief.

1352
01:35:24,775 --> 01:35:29,070
I was thinking that if you cross
connect the engine cooling system...

1353
01:35:29,071 --> 01:35:30,905
and the mufflers you could
drown out those sparks.

1354
01:35:30,906 --> 01:35:33,547
The engine cooling
system and the mufflers?

1355
01:35:33,743 --> 01:35:35,542
Are you crazy?

1356
01:35:36,205 --> 01:35:38,299
Hey, you know that might work.

1357
01:35:39,959 --> 01:35:42,268
Would you like some pork, Major?

1358
01:35:42,587 --> 01:35:43,889
Thank you.

1359
01:35:44,799 --> 01:35:46,775
- Captain.
- What?

1360
01:35:47,176 --> 01:35:50,980
I've looked up and down this boat
and I can't find Mr. Holden.

1361
01:35:51,222 --> 01:35:55,026
- Or Barbara, er, Lieutenant Duran.
- No kidding!

1362
01:35:55,144 --> 01:35:59,022
- And number three life raft is missing.
- Fancy that!

1363
01:35:59,023 --> 01:36:02,986
- Well, if they're gone and the number three...
- One moment, Watson, listen...

1364
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:05,112
Have you ever been to Las Vegas?

1365
01:36:05,113 --> 01:36:08,992
Because up there the boys would say that
you're trying to make your point the hard way.

1366
01:36:08,993 --> 01:36:12,203
When a girl is under twenty
one she is protected by law.

1367
01:36:12,204 --> 01:36:15,165
When she is over sixty five,
she is protected by nature.

1368
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:18,211
Any where in between...
she's fair game.

1369
01:36:18,212 --> 01:36:20,092
Put that away.

1370
01:36:40,364 --> 01:36:43,824
- May I come in?
- Yes, of course.

1371
01:36:43,825 --> 01:36:45,534
Why aren't you at the party?

1372
01:36:45,535 --> 01:36:48,496
I really didn't think that
you wanted me there.

1373
01:36:48,497 --> 01:36:53,261
I would probably do something out
of line and you would be angry.

1374
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,295
Captain, you may not believe this

1375
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,589
but all of those things that
happened were accidents.

1376
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:59,650
I'm sure they were.

1377
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:05,099
Lieutenant, if I've been
short-tempered, I want to apologize...

1378
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,228
my only excuse is that things haven't
been going well and I'm edgy.

1379
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:12,982
Why not finish your
hair while I wait?

1380
01:37:12,983 --> 01:37:15,068
Then we can go up
together and celebrate.

1381
01:37:15,069 --> 01:37:16,987
- Is that all right?
- Yes.

1382
01:37:16,988 --> 01:37:21,372
Let's forget everything that happened
and start the New Year off right.

1383
01:37:21,577 --> 01:37:23,291
You can... Ahhhh!

1384
01:37:27,125 --> 01:37:30,836
- You'll be a wonderful father.
- Father?

1385
01:37:30,837 --> 01:37:32,504
- When you get married.
- Sure.

1386
01:37:32,505 --> 01:37:34,882
Genetically you have very
dominant characteristics...

1387
01:37:34,883 --> 01:37:35,967
Really?

1388
01:37:35,968 --> 01:37:39,304
- Dark hair, blue eyes.
- What is this?

1389
01:37:39,305 --> 01:37:42,684
Three of four children
will look after you.

1390
01:37:42,685 --> 01:37:45,770
- I know it won't be easy.
- What won't be easy?

1391
01:37:45,771 --> 01:37:47,731
- Until we get settled.
- But...

1392
01:37:47,732 --> 01:37:49,441
- But I'll help.
- Help?

1393
01:37:49,442 --> 01:37:52,360
With the expenses.
I'll get a job.

1394
01:37:52,361 --> 01:37:55,038
- Expenses?
- Yes.

1395
01:37:56,742 --> 01:37:59,465
Barbara, I'm engaged to be married.

1396
01:38:02,165 --> 01:38:04,625
Now, Barbara, don't be hasty.
Let me explain.

1397
01:38:04,626 --> 01:38:06,420
It's a very simple
thing to explain;...

1398
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:09,088
- I've known that girl for quite a while...
- Get away!

1399
01:38:09,089 --> 01:38:11,257
- I thought to tell you now...
- Get away from me!

1400
01:38:11,258 --> 01:38:13,177
You're not listening.

1401
01:38:13,178 --> 01:38:14,595
- I'm going!
- Do not go!

1402
01:38:14,596 --> 01:38:17,350
- I'm going to the boat!
- I can explain everything!

1403
01:38:17,351 --> 01:38:20,017
- I'm going back to the boat!
- Please listen, apart from...

1404
01:38:20,018 --> 01:38:23,573
Barbara, wait! There are
women-eating sharks!

1405
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:25,865
Barbara!

1406
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:28,038
Barbara, wait a minute!

1407
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:36,536
I don't think it's serious, sir, but,
shouldn't one of the nurses look at it?

1408
01:38:36,537 --> 01:38:39,713
- Just bandage it, Dooley.
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:38:52,597 --> 01:38:55,321
Happy new year!

1410
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:58,303
Barbara!

1411
01:40:00,386 --> 01:40:02,527
Barbara! Will you...?

1412
01:40:02,762 --> 01:40:05,307
Barbara, will you get back in the
raft? Will you get in the raft?

1413
01:40:05,308 --> 01:40:07,366
Stop following me!

1414
01:40:08,895 --> 01:40:10,527
Barbara!

1415
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,985
I wish you'd try to understand.

1416
01:40:15,986 --> 01:40:19,657
What if I did say I loved you?
What if we got married?

1417
01:40:19,658 --> 01:40:23,327
I'm poor. You're poor.
All we'd get is poor children.

1418
01:40:23,328 --> 01:40:27,915
- I don't think I should go to the party.
- Oh yes, you should. I demand you do.

1419
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:29,376
You don't have to go just for me.

1420
01:40:29,377 --> 01:40:33,212
I can't think of anyone else I'd do
it for; it's become sort of a need.

1421
01:40:33,213 --> 01:40:34,423
- That's very kind of you.
- Yes, isn't it?

1422
01:40:34,424 --> 01:40:37,969
- I mean is that you're such a gentleman.
- Yes, that comes as a surprise to me, too.

1423
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:39,685
Barbara!

1424
01:40:40,097 --> 01:40:41,861
Barbara, will you...

1425
01:40:42,098 --> 01:40:44,158
Will you listen to me?

1426
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:45,901
Barbara!

1427
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:50,149
Barbara, it's tiring rowing
this way, will you wait?

1428
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,866
Barbara!

1429
01:40:52,986 --> 01:40:56,699
You are a beautiful and intelligent girl,
you should marry a wealthy man.

1430
01:40:56,700 --> 01:41:00,203
I'm no good for you, you don't want to
marry me. I'm doing you a favor.

1431
01:41:00,204 --> 01:41:03,415
- Don't do me any more favors, mister.
- Barbara, dear, would you...

1432
01:41:03,416 --> 01:41:05,426
- Oh shut up!
- Barbara!

1433
01:41:09,131 --> 01:41:10,811
Barbara!

1434
01:41:13,345 --> 01:41:15,854
Air raid! Man your stations!

1435
01:41:17,056 --> 01:41:20,576
- Air Raid!
- Clear the deck!

1436
01:41:23,146 --> 01:41:26,859
Clear the deck!
Get those women down!

1437
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:29,334
Let's get underway!

1438
01:41:32,448 --> 01:41:34,241
Ready in all respects
to get underway, sir.

1439
01:41:34,242 --> 01:41:35,744
Okay, I'll take charge.

1440
01:41:35,745 --> 01:41:38,088
- Strike four.
- Strike four.

1441
01:41:38,205 --> 01:41:39,803
Strike three.

1442
01:41:40,123 --> 01:41:41,721
Drop two.

1443
01:41:49,678 --> 01:41:52,012
Wait, what's going on here?

1444
01:41:52,013 --> 01:41:55,224
- Mr. Holden promised the dealers, sir.
- Promised them what?

1445
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:59,361
You see, sir. If they helped us,
we'd take the women and children.

1446
01:41:59,938 --> 01:42:04,610
- Most of the women are pregnant.
- Yes, sir. Any minute now, sir.

1447
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:07,155
Isn't it lucky that we
have the nurses aboard?

1448
01:42:07,156 --> 01:42:09,991
I'm running a submarine,
not a maternity ward!

1449
01:42:09,992 --> 01:42:11,826
What's that thing doing
here, that goat?

1450
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:14,079
It's for the children, sir.
Fresh milk.

1451
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,766
I don't care, get
them off the boat!

1452
01:42:21,505 --> 01:42:24,181
Aircraft, port quarter!
Closing!

1453
01:42:25,093 --> 01:42:27,178
- One moment.
- Lieutenant promised...

1454
01:42:27,179 --> 01:42:30,186
Go on, get them off!

1455
01:42:34,604 --> 01:42:37,280
Here they come. Get down!

1456
01:42:44,074 --> 01:42:46,116
Ramon, take these women forward.

1457
01:42:46,117 --> 01:42:47,327
Get these kids down.

1458
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:48,411
Come here.

1459
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:49,622
Give me the goat.

1460
01:42:49,623 --> 01:42:51,253
Come on, goat.

1461
01:42:52,584 --> 01:42:54,298
Give me a hand.

1462
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:56,342
Somebody get the kid.

1463
01:43:00,967 --> 01:43:03,976
- Starboard back two thirds.
- Starboard back two thirds.

1464
01:43:23,452 --> 01:43:25,762
I know it, I'm dead.

1465
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:28,512
Cherry.

1466
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:34,714
- Clear the bridge!
- Clear the bridge!

1467
01:43:34,715 --> 01:43:37,676
- Number One.
- Number Two.

1468
01:43:37,677 --> 01:43:39,635
- Number Three.
- Number Four.

1469
01:43:39,636 --> 01:43:41,186
Number Five.

1470
01:44:14,345 --> 01:44:17,472
Isn't there some way to sneak back
to Cebu and pick up that gray paint?

1471
01:44:17,473 --> 01:44:19,104
No, there is not.

1472
01:44:19,392 --> 01:44:24,072
But a pink submarine. What if
somebody sees us? It's embarrassing.

1473
01:44:30,237 --> 01:44:33,490
Mr. Stovall, does she
have to be up here?

1474
01:44:33,491 --> 01:44:36,713
Ramon said she would give more
milk if she had fresh air, sir.

1475
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:45,629
It's a boy!

1476
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:48,188
Congratulations, sir!

1477
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:56,309
3 January, 1942.

1478
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,642
21:30.

1479
01:44:57,643 --> 01:45:01,410
Born to Mrs. Manuel Garcia... a boy.

1480
01:45:01,523 --> 01:45:03,107
22:55.

1481
01:45:03,108 --> 01:45:06,195
Mrs. Ceferino Vincenzo
has gone into labor.

1482
01:45:06,196 --> 01:45:09,324
The whole crew are acting
like expectant fathers;...

1483
01:45:09,325 --> 01:45:13,376
Seaman Fox is even having
sympathetic labor pains.

1484
01:45:15,874 --> 01:45:19,678
- Cheer up, Fox, it will all be over soon.
- Yes, sir.

1485
01:45:22,255 --> 01:45:23,757
Diapers.

1486
01:45:23,758 --> 01:45:26,932
- For the baby, sir.
- Really?

1487
01:45:38,441 --> 01:45:40,204
Got you.

1488
01:45:40,652 --> 01:45:42,862
Yes, you got me, Harmon, now what?

1489
01:45:42,863 --> 01:45:45,616
Excuse me, sir, playing blind
man's buff with the kids.

1490
01:45:45,617 --> 01:45:47,926
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

1491
01:45:48,871 --> 01:45:50,412
- Hi.
- Hi.

1492
01:45:50,413 --> 01:45:51,831
- How are you?
- Okay.

1493
01:45:51,832 --> 01:45:53,624
- What do you know?
- Okay.

1494
01:45:53,625 --> 01:45:55,042
Okay.

1495
01:45:55,043 --> 01:45:57,337
- Can I go through there?
- There's a woman in labor.

1496
01:45:57,338 --> 01:45:59,631
Yes, I know, but I have
to go to the engine room.

1497
01:45:59,632 --> 01:46:02,355
- If you do not mind.
- I don't mind. Come on.

1498
01:46:03,678 --> 01:46:08,407
- Everything all right?
- Okay, okay, everything okay.

1499
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,073
Tostin!

1500
01:46:20,365 --> 01:46:22,245
Tostin!

1501
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:28,374
Me and the Major were just
taking some measurements, sir.

1502
01:46:28,375 --> 01:46:30,967
Would you care to explain that?

1503
01:46:31,043 --> 01:46:33,221
Fuel oil transfer pump.

1504
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:35,630
Engine room.
Is the Captain there?

1505
01:46:35,631 --> 01:46:38,927
- What is it, Stovall?
- Kraus has the radio repeating, sir.

1506
01:46:38,928 --> 01:46:41,021
I'll be right up.

1507
01:46:45,894 --> 01:46:47,812
It looks like you were right, Edna.

1508
01:46:47,813 --> 01:46:50,272
We'll need some high
pressure piping.

1509
01:46:50,273 --> 01:46:53,151
We can get it in the
forward torpedo room.

1510
01:46:53,152 --> 01:46:56,588
Yes, that's right.
I'll get it, Sam.

1511
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:06,342
You're quite a girl, Edna.

1512
01:47:08,962 --> 01:47:11,353
We picked up "Tokyo Rose", sir.

1513
01:47:12,466 --> 01:47:16,178
I have a message for the
crew of the pink submarine

1514
01:47:16,179 --> 01:47:19,014
cruising somewhere
in the Celebes Sea.

1515
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:21,517
Fellows, start the
New Year off right.

1516
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,061
Surrender.

1517
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:26,189
We don't know what you're
up to, but it won't work.

1518
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:30,320
All you've done painting your sub
pink is make it easier to find you.

1519
01:47:30,321 --> 01:47:32,414
So, why die, boys?

1520
01:47:32,823 --> 01:47:35,461
And now an appropriate number.

1521
01:47:37,536 --> 01:47:39,466
What do you think, sir?

1522
01:47:40,457 --> 01:47:42,967
Well, we've got nothing
to worry about.

1523
01:47:43,126 --> 01:47:45,338
Their side knows and
our side knows.

1524
01:47:45,339 --> 01:47:48,513
There's probably some of our
ships out looking for us now.

1525
01:47:52,846 --> 01:47:56,098
We've checked with British, Australian,
and Dutch naval units, sir.

1526
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:59,144
- They have no pink submarines.
- And it's certainly not one of ours.

1527
01:47:59,145 --> 01:48:02,189
Intelligence feels the
"Tokyo Rose" broadcast

1528
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:05,078
is a decoy so they can slip one
of their own subs through.

1529
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,614
Well, this is one trick
they won't get away with.

1530
01:48:08,615 --> 01:48:10,782
Notify all Allied naval units:

1531
01:48:10,783 --> 01:48:15,215
Any unidentified submarine, pink or
otherwise, is to be sunk on sight.

1532
01:48:22,547 --> 01:48:23,715
- Sir.
- What?

1533
01:48:23,716 --> 01:48:25,810
A destroyer on the starboard bow.

1534
01:48:29,556 --> 01:48:31,307
It's one of ours.

1535
01:48:31,308 --> 01:48:34,058
How do you want to contact them, sir?
Our radio still isn't transmitting.

1536
01:48:34,059 --> 01:48:37,614
Signal them. Get Harmon to the
conning tower. Stand by to surface.

1537
01:48:50,621 --> 01:48:53,012
Submarine surfacing port bow!

1538
01:48:54,542 --> 01:48:56,584
It's that pink sub!

1539
01:48:56,585 --> 01:48:58,921
- Surface action port!
- Surface action port!

1540
01:48:58,922 --> 01:49:01,516
- Fire when ready!
- Fire when ready!

1541
01:49:17,192 --> 01:49:20,237
Jesus Christ! Take her down!
Clear the bridge!

1542
01:49:20,238 --> 01:49:22,381
Take her down, fast!

1543
01:49:26,913 --> 01:49:29,804
Establish sonar contact.

1544
01:49:33,461 --> 01:49:36,465
All engines ahead full. Stand by
to fire depth charges.

1545
01:49:36,466 --> 01:49:38,774
Stand by to fire depth charges.

1546
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,522
They're coming in
for the kill, sir.

1547
01:49:49,523 --> 01:49:51,940
Rig for depth charges.
Silent running.

1548
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:53,656
Excuse me.

1549
01:50:23,271 --> 01:50:25,272
Flooding on number two periscope.

1550
01:50:25,273 --> 01:50:27,983
Flooding number two periscope, sir.

1551
01:50:27,984 --> 01:50:29,151
Clear the conning tower.

1552
01:50:29,152 --> 01:50:31,570
- Clear the conning tower.
- Clear the conning tower.

1553
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:33,665
Clearing below.

1554
01:50:39,706 --> 01:50:42,974
- Get on the sound gear and report developments.
- Yes, sir.

1555
01:50:48,215 --> 01:50:51,353
They don't have to hit us, sir.
They're going to shake us apart.

1556
01:51:04,484 --> 01:51:05,485
All stop.

1557
01:51:05,486 --> 01:51:06,953
All stop.

1558
01:51:18,334 --> 01:51:20,095
It's twins!

1559
01:51:20,295 --> 01:51:22,222
One of each!

1560
01:51:23,006 --> 01:51:27,557
Captain, Sonar says they're picking
up something like babies crying.

1561
01:51:27,678 --> 01:51:29,596
That's what they say, sir.

1562
01:51:29,597 --> 01:51:32,514
- Stay on that sound.
- Stay on that sound.

1563
01:51:32,515 --> 01:51:34,943
They may have a weapon
we know nothing about.

1564
01:51:38,106 --> 01:51:40,399
Keep them quiet.
That's an order.

1565
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,445
- What do you suggest we do?
- You are nurses. Make them stop.

1566
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:47,284
- We're trying.
- What is so difficult about keeping babies quiet?

1567
01:51:47,285 --> 01:51:48,534
Oh, you try.

1568
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:52,219
I can't. I have to go
back to the control room.

1569
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,960
- Here, try this one?
- Certainly.

1570
01:51:56,961 --> 01:51:58,641
Thank you.

1571
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,468
You'll be a wonderful father.

1572
01:52:03,469 --> 01:52:06,514
Don't bother trying.
He's already engaged.

1573
01:52:06,515 --> 01:52:08,491
To a super chief.

1574
01:52:16,149 --> 01:52:18,485
Hunkle, get all these
pillows and blankets.

1575
01:52:18,486 --> 01:52:21,281
- What's up, Chief?
- The skipper's wants them to think we're sinking.

1576
01:52:21,282 --> 01:52:23,491
We're sending up an oil slick and
everything that isn't tied down.

1577
01:52:23,492 --> 01:52:26,250
- Give us a hand, Dooley.
- Okay.

1578
01:52:26,371 --> 01:52:28,345
Sorry, ladies.

1579
01:52:29,416 --> 01:52:33,181
- And these life jackets, sir?
- Might as well. Throw them in.

1580
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:53,582
Tube three ready to fire, sir.

1581
01:53:04,164 --> 01:53:06,044
Captain, look!

1582
01:53:08,544 --> 01:53:10,460
We've sunk them.

1583
01:53:10,461 --> 01:53:12,391
Maybe.

1584
01:53:12,798 --> 01:53:15,091
Or they could be
pulling a fast one.

1585
01:53:15,092 --> 01:53:17,981
- Continue depth charges.
- Continue depth charges.

1586
01:53:26,482 --> 01:53:28,790
They're not buying it.

1587
01:53:36,659 --> 01:53:38,118
They got your girdle, Edna.

1588
01:53:38,119 --> 01:53:40,213
That's all right, Sam.

1589
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:45,433
You know? I spent a lot
of years disliking women.

1590
01:53:46,171 --> 01:53:47,969
But I don't dislike you.

1591
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,848
Really?

1592
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:51,766
You are different.

1593
01:53:52,303 --> 01:53:53,852
You're not a woman.

1594
01:53:54,346 --> 01:53:55,896
You're more than that.

1595
01:53:56,099 --> 01:53:57,731
You're a mechanic.

1596
01:53:58,142 --> 01:54:00,117
Thank you, Sam.

1597
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:15,619
Just when somebody comes up
with an idea how I can go home.

1598
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:18,164
- What idea, Hunkle?
- Lieutenant Reid, sir.

1599
01:54:18,165 --> 01:54:20,584
- She figured out what I can do about Gertie.
- Yes?

1600
01:54:20,585 --> 01:54:24,020
- Tattoo panties and a bra on her.
- Oh, that's nice.

1601
01:54:27,468 --> 01:54:29,693
Panties and a bra.

1602
01:54:30,596 --> 01:54:32,429
Panties and...

1603
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:35,702
Sir, we've been sending
up the wrong stuff!

1604
01:54:41,192 --> 01:54:42,527
This is the Captain.

1605
01:54:42,528 --> 01:54:46,197
Nurses will return to their
quarters and take off...

1606
01:54:46,198 --> 01:54:48,127
their undergarments.

1607
01:54:48,743 --> 01:54:51,881
Mr. Holden will be right
there to collect them.

1608
01:54:53,539 --> 01:54:54,840
Here.

1609
01:54:58,128 --> 01:54:59,678
Okay, lock it up.

1610
01:55:14,981 --> 01:55:18,416
Captain, off the port bow.
More debris.

1611
01:55:26,661 --> 01:55:28,637
That's debris?

1612
01:55:29,247 --> 01:55:31,757
Stand by with a grappling hook!

1613
01:55:49,896 --> 01:55:52,369
Come on, get that thing up here!

1614
01:55:56,488 --> 01:55:58,464
Come on, come on!

1615
01:56:03,996 --> 01:56:06,388
The Japanese have
nothing like this.

1616
01:56:06,498 --> 01:56:08,678
Cease fire!

1617
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:30,108
Captain, this is going
to be terrible.

1618
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:31,734
We should have come in at night.

1619
01:56:31,735 --> 01:56:34,529
I'm afraid it's too late, Chief.
We're already committed.

1620
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:36,949
- Fall in.
- Yes, sir.

1621
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:39,424
All right.
Fall in!

1622
01:56:53,093 --> 01:56:55,679
Sir, we're never going
to live this down.

1623
01:56:55,680 --> 01:57:00,611
We may be pink and coming in by the grace of
a woman's brassiere, but we're coming in.

1624
01:57:01,187 --> 01:57:04,029
- Show the colors!
- Show the colors!

1625
01:57:37,103 --> 01:57:38,478
Admiral.

1626
01:57:38,479 --> 01:57:41,064
The Captain's arriving, sir.
And we're ready get underway.

1627
01:57:41,065 --> 01:57:42,699
Thank you, Chief.

1628
01:57:48,824 --> 01:57:52,077
Chief, will you drive Mrs. Holden
and the boys back? Thank you.

1629
01:57:52,078 --> 01:57:53,247
Bye, baby.

1630
01:57:53,248 --> 01:57:54,746
- Bye, darling.
- Bye, boys.

1631
01:57:54,747 --> 01:57:56,379
Attention on deck!

1632
01:58:00,047 --> 01:58:01,762
Carry on.

1633
01:58:08,473 --> 01:58:11,230
- Good morning, Admiral.
- Morning, Captain.

1634
01:58:11,517 --> 01:58:14,491
- Any last-minute reprieve?
- No go.

1635
01:58:14,730 --> 01:58:19,067
- I hate to take her to the junkyard.
- Yes, I know.

1636
01:58:19,068 --> 01:58:22,196
A new atomic submarine comes
off the ways in a month;...

1637
01:58:22,197 --> 01:58:26,200
its the same name... "Sea Tiger".
It will be your next command.

1638
01:58:26,201 --> 01:58:27,994
That's great. Thank you, sir.

1639
01:58:27,995 --> 01:58:30,504
Here's something else.

1640
01:58:34,335 --> 01:58:37,548
- Did you put everything here?
- Yes, everything.

1641
01:58:37,549 --> 01:58:40,759
- I feel it will be in safer hands now.
- You know it will.

1642
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:44,896
I suggest you don't show it to your children
until they're old enough to understand.

1643
01:58:45,516 --> 01:58:48,405
- All right, Nick, take her away.
- Yes, sir.

1644
01:58:49,812 --> 01:58:53,698
- By the way, where is my wife?
- I don't know. She never showed.

1645
01:58:55,944 --> 01:58:58,003
Attention on deck!

1646
01:58:58,531 --> 01:59:01,450
Okay, Jack. Let's shove off.
Aye aye, sir.

1647
01:59:01,451 --> 01:59:04,619
Take in the brow!
Take in all lines!

1648
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:07,373
- Hi Uncle Matt.
- Hello guys, how are you?

1649
01:59:07,374 --> 01:59:09,042
What happened to her?

1650
01:59:09,043 --> 01:59:12,254
We waited as long as we could
and finally took a cab.

1651
01:59:12,255 --> 01:59:14,312
That must be her.

1652
01:59:23,351 --> 01:59:25,447
Yes, that's her.

1653
01:59:28,023 --> 01:59:31,030
Driver! The bumpers are hooked!

1654
01:59:32,068 --> 01:59:33,749
Stop!

1655
01:59:34,614 --> 01:59:36,460
Hey driver!

1656
01:59:36,784 --> 01:59:38,582
Stop!

1657
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:49,088
Darling, I 'm terribly sorry.

1658
01:59:49,089 --> 01:59:52,216
- I stepped on the brake...
- Leave it. Never mind.

1659
01:59:52,217 --> 01:59:55,011
- Yes, but your car...
- I know, dear. Don't worry...

1660
01:59:55,012 --> 01:59:56,941
they'll stop it at the gate.

1661
02:00:09,613 --> 02:00:12,614
Strange, still that
number one engine...

1662
02:00:12,615 --> 02:00:15,209
I guess they were
never able to fix that.
