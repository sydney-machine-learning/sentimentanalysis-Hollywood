- Someone now knows
that we're up here hiding.
- It's a thief.

go to the Green Police and say,

and I heard a noise above my head"?

is going to do that?
Yes, he will.

You're crazy.
I think that someday
the thief will be caught.

1159

He'll make a bargain
with the Gestapo.

1160

He'll say to the Gestapo,
"If you let me off,

some Jews are hiding."

01:58:18,884 --> 01:58:20,843
I looked back.

1308
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:23,554
He was standing,
staring at the bookcase.

1309
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:28,517
He said, "I thought
I remember a door up here.

1310
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:33,189
Was not there a door here
leading to the loft?"

1311
01:58:33,273 --> 01:58:36,734
Then he asked me for more money.
Twenty gilders more a week.

1312
01:58:36,818 --> 01:58:40,279
- Blackmail.
- Twenty gilders?
Very modest blackmail.

1313
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:42,531
That's just
the beginning.

1314
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:45,910
You know what I think?

1315
01:58:45,994 --> 01:58:49,455
He's the thief who was
down there that night.

1316
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:51,624
That's how
he knows we're here.

1317
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:54,126
How was it left?
What did you tell him?

1318
01:58:54,211 --> 01:58:56,504
I told him
I had to think about it.

1319
01:58:56,588 --> 01:58:58,589
What shall I do?
Pay him the money?

1320
01:58:58,673 --> 01:59:00,591
Take a chance
on firing him or what?

1321
01:59:00,717 --> 01:59:03,928
I do not know.
For heaven's sakes,
don't fire him.

1322
01:59:04,012 --> 01:59:07,598
Pay him what he asks.
Keep him here where you can
keep your eye on him.

1323
01:59:07,682 --> 01:59:10,935
Is it so much that he is asking?
I mean, what are
they paying nowadays?

1324
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:13,145
He could get it
in a war plant.
Mm-hmm.

1325
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:18,025
But this is not a war plant.
Mind you, I do not know
if he knows or not.

1326
01:59:22,447 --> 01:59:25,991
Offer him half.
Then we'll soon know
if it is blackmail or not.

1327
01:59:26,076 --> 01:59:29,954
And if it is,
we've gotta pay, haven't we?
[Chuckles]

1328
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:32,164
Whatever he asks,
we've gotta pay.

1329
01:59:32,249 --> 01:59:36,168
Let us decide that
when the time comes.

1330
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:38,337
This may be all my imagination.

1331
01:59:38,421 --> 01:59:42,508
You get to a point these days
where you suspect everyone
and everything.

1332
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,761
[Siren Wailing]
[Phone Rings]

1333
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:51,767
[Wailing Continues]
[Ringing Continues]

1334
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,695
What does that mean,
the telephone ringing
on a holiday?

1335
02:00:06,283 --> 02:00:10,494
That's my wife.
I told her I had to go over
some papers in my office,

1336
02:00:10,579 --> 02:00:12,705
to call me here
when she got out of church.

1337
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:15,124
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

1338
02:00:15,208 --> 02:00:17,209
Happy New Year.

1339
02:00:17,294 --> 02:00:19,753
[All]
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.

1340
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:21,755
[Ringing Continues]

1341
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:24,425
I will offer him half then.

1342
02:00:24,509 --> 02:00:26,510
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.

1343
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:32,641
[Ringing Continues]
[Dussel]
You can thank your son for this.

1344
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:34,643
[Ringing Continues]
[Dussel]
You can thank your son for this.

1345
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:37,730
Him and his damn cat.
That night. There.

1346
02:00:39,983 --> 02:00:44,486
I tell you, it's-it's-it's-
it's just a question
of time now.

1347
02:00:50,493 --> 02:00:54,163
Sometimes I wish the end would come,
whatever it is.

1348
02:00:54,289 --> 02:00:58,167
Margot!
Well, then at least
we'd know where we were.

1349
02:00:59,461 --> 02:01:02,546
You should be ashamed of yourself,
talking that way.

1350
02:01:03,548 --> 02:01:05,507
Think how lucky we are.

1351
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:11,597
Think of the thousands
dying in the war every day.

1352
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:14,683
Think of the people
in concentration camps.
What's the good of that?

1353
02:01:16,353 --> 02:01:20,522
What's the good of
thinking of misery when
you're already miserable?

1354
02:01:20,607 --> 02:01:23,025
That's stupid.

1355
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:25,611
We're young,
Margot and Peter and I.

1356
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,863
You grown-ups
have had your chance.

1357
02:01:30,033 --> 02:01:35,204
Look at us. If we begin
thinking of all the horror
in the world, we're lost.

1358
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:38,123
We're trying to hold on
to some kind of ideals,

1359
02:01:38,208 --> 02:01:42,670
when everything- ideals, hope-
everything is being destroyed.

1360
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:47,466
It isn't our fault
the world is in such a mess.

1361
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,510
We weren't around
when all this started.

1362
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:53,263
- Now you listen to me.
- So don't try to take it out on us.

1363
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,353
[Huffs]

1364
02:02:02,732 --> 02:02:06,068
[Mr. Van Daan]
She talks as if
we started the war.

1365
02:02:07,112 --> 02:02:09,279
Did we start the war?

1366
02:02:18,415 --> 02:02:20,416
You left this.

1367
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:23,419
Thanks.

1368
02:02:27,966 --> 02:02:30,175
I thought you were fine
just now.

1369
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,637
You know just how to talk to 'em.
I can never think when I'm mad.

1370
02:02:34,848 --> 02:02:37,474
I say too much.

1371
02:02:37,559 --> 02:02:39,893
I hurt people's feelings.

1372
02:02:42,313 --> 02:02:44,398
I think you're just fine.

1373
02:02:55,285 --> 02:02:57,286
Thank you, Peter.

1374
02:03:03,334 --> 02:03:07,129
That Dussel,
what he said about Mouschi,
about somebody eating him,

1375
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:09,465
all I could think is
I wanted to hit him.

1376
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:12,134
That's what I used to do
in school, but,

1377
02:03:12,218 --> 02:03:14,720
here a fight starts,
I just duck in my room.

1378
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:17,973
You're lucky
having a room to go to.

1379
02:03:18,058 --> 02:03:21,060
His Lordship is always in mine.

1380
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:25,230
When they start in on me,
I have to stand and take it.

1381
02:03:25,315 --> 02:03:28,233
You gave some of it
back to them just now.

1382
02:03:28,318 --> 02:03:31,278
I get so mad.

1383
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:33,864
They've formed their opinions.

1384
02:03:33,948 --> 02:03:35,866
About everything.

1385
02:03:36,868 --> 02:03:39,286
But we're still trying to find out.

1386
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:45,959
We have problems here that
no other people our age have ever had.

1387
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:49,505
And just as you think
you've solved them,

1388
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:52,132
something comes along
and, bang,

1389
02:03:54,302 --> 02:03:57,513
you have to start all over again.

1390
02:04:00,517 --> 02:04:02,518
I think your father's fine.

1391
02:04:02,602 --> 02:04:05,312
Oh, he is, Peter.
He is.

1392
02:04:05,396 --> 02:04:09,358
He's the only one
who's ever given me the feeling
that I have any sense.

1393
02:04:15,115 --> 02:04:17,199
Isn't it funny, you and I?

1394
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:21,328
Here we've been together all this time...

1395
02:04:21,412 --> 02:04:23,914
and this is the first time
we've ever really talked.

1396
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:30,838
It helps a lot to have someone
to talk to, doesn't it?

1397
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,091
It helps you let off steam.

1398
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:37,719
[Glass Clinks]

1399
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:53,986
Any time that...

1400
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:56,738
you want to let off steam,

1401
02:04:56,823 --> 02:04:58,991
you can come into my room.

1402
02:05:00,285 --> 02:05:03,620
I can get up
an awful lot of steam.
[Chuckles]

1403
02:05:03,705 --> 02:05:05,789
It's all right with me.

1404
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:08,917
Do you mean that?

1405
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:15,215
I said it, didn't I?

1406
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:31,732
Good night.
Good night.

1407
02:05:31,733 --> 02:05:33,775
Good night.
Good night.

1408
02:05:33,902 --> 02:05:36,528
Good night.
Good night.

1409
02:05:46,789 --> 02:05:51,585
May I come in?
No, Mr. Dussel.
I'm not dressed yet.

1410
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:53,629
Oh.

1411
02:06:18,154 --> 02:06:20,113
Margot.
Hmm?

1412
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:23,492
Tell me, am I terribly ugly?

1413
02:06:23,618 --> 02:06:25,661
Oh, stop fishing.
No. Tell me.

1414
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:29,790
Of course you're not.
You've got nice eyes...

1415
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:33,710
and a lot of animation
and- and-

1416
02:06:54,482 --> 02:06:56,692
- May I come in?
- Come in, Mother.

1417
02:06:57,777 --> 02:07:00,237
Mr. Dussel is impatient
to get in here.

1418
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:03,240
[Anne]
He takes the room
for himself the entire day.

1419
02:07:03,324 --> 02:07:06,159
You're not going in again
tonight to see Peter, hmm?

1420
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:09,579
That is my intention.

1421
02:07:12,834 --> 02:07:15,794
Aren't you afraid
you're disturbing him?

1422
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:18,171
Mother, I have some intuition.

1423
02:07:18,256 --> 02:07:20,424
Then may I ask you
this much, Annie?

1424
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:23,093
Please don't shut the door
when you go in.

1425
02:07:25,805 --> 02:07:28,307
You sound like
Mrs. Van Daan.

1426
02:07:28,391 --> 02:07:31,685
Oh, no. I don't mean
to suggest anything wrong.

1427
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:34,938
I only wish you wouldn't
expose yourself to criticism.

1428
02:07:35,023 --> 02:07:38,942
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm going to Peter's room.

1429
02:07:39,027 --> 02:07:42,821
I'm not going to let
Petronella Van Daan
spoil our friendship.

1430
02:07:48,703 --> 02:07:50,787
Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

1431
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:56,126
In my day the boys
called on the girls.

1432
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:59,921
[Mrs. Frank] You know how
young people are. Peter's room
is the only place they can talk.

1433
02:08:00,006 --> 02:08:02,007
Talk?

1434
02:08:02,091 --> 02:08:04,593
That's not what they called it
when I was a girl.

1435
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:11,099
I'm sorry, Margot,
that you have to be
the one left out.

1436
02:08:12,894 --> 02:08:15,520
I feel so guilty about you.

1437
02:08:15,605 --> 02:08:17,814
Why?

1438
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:22,444
I mean, every time
I go to Peter-

1439
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:26,239
into Peter's room,
I have the feeling
that I'm hurting you.

1440
02:08:27,909 --> 02:08:31,078
I know if it were me,
I'd be desperately jealous.

1441
02:08:33,915 --> 02:08:35,874
I am jealous a little.

1442
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:37,959
Not of you and Peter.

1443
02:08:39,253 --> 02:08:41,213
I'm-

1444
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:44,591
I'm only feeling sorry
that I haven't anyone...

1445
02:08:44,675 --> 02:08:47,552
with whom to-
to discuss my feelings.

1446
02:08:47,637 --> 02:08:49,554
Margot, I won't even-

1447
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:53,433
Listen, you've found
a companionship,
and I want you to enjoy it.

1448
02:08:53,518 --> 02:08:58,146
Only... in my heart I feel
that I've got a right to share
feelings with someone too.

1449
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:05,278
But I'm sure that Peter-
that that boy, he could just
never be that person for me.

1450
02:09:05,363 --> 02:09:07,280
[Knocking On Door]

1451
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:09,908
Maybe there's nothing
to be jealous about.

1452
02:09:11,494 --> 02:09:13,870
Maybe I'm just
taking the place of his cat.

1453
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:15,872
Will you please let me
in my room?

1454
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:19,501
[Anne]
Just a minute,
dear, dear Mr. Dussel.

1455
02:09:30,471 --> 02:09:33,265
Well, here I go...

1456
02:09:33,349 --> 02:09:35,308
to run the gauntlet.

1457
02:09:38,271 --> 02:09:40,313
Thank you so much.

1458
02:09:48,531 --> 02:09:50,532
[Heel Snaps]

1459
02:09:52,201 --> 02:09:54,619
Look at her.

1460
02:09:54,704 --> 02:09:58,373
A lot of good it did me
to have a son.
I never see him.

1461
02:10:00,209 --> 02:10:02,210
Just a minute, dear.

1462
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:07,382
I'd like to say
a few words to my son.
Do you mind?

1463
02:10:07,467 --> 02:10:11,052
Peter, I do not want you staying
up till all hours tonight.

1464
02:10:11,137 --> 02:10:13,180
You need your sleep.
You are a growing boy.

1465
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:16,850
Anne won't stay late.
She's going to bed
promptly at 9:00.

1466
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:20,812
Aren't you, Anne?
Yes, Mother. May we go now?

1467
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:23,190
[Mrs. Frank]

I was blindfolded.

It was at a party.
One of those kissing games.

Margot would never
kiss anyone unless
she was engaged to them.

And I'm sure too
that Mother never
touched a man before Father.

1975
02:50:08,407 --> 02:50:11,492
For the past two years
we have lived in fear.

1976
02:50:11,577 --> 02:50:13,578
Now we can live in hope.

And so it seems our stay here is over.

1982
02:50:40,480 --> 02:50:43,733
They've given us just a moment
to get our things.

1983
02:50:43,817 --> 02:50:45,943
We can each take a bag...

1984
02:50:46,028 --> 02:50:48,029
and whatever it will hold
of clothing.

1985
02:50:49,114 --> 02:50:51,866
Nothing else.

1986
02:50:51,950 --> 02:50:53,993
So, dear... Diary,

1987
02:50:55,996 --> 02:50:58,748
that means
I must leave you behind.

1988
02:51:00,375 --> 02:51:02,919
Good-bye for a while.

1989
02:51:04,046 --> 02:51:07,506
P.S.
Please, please, anyone,

1990
02:51:08,884 --> 02:51:11,510
if you should find this diary,

1991
02:51:11,595 --> 02:51:14,430
will you please
keep it safe for me,

1992
02:51:14,514 --> 02:51:16,849
because someday I hope that-

1993
02:51:20,771 --> 02:51:22,813
No more.

1994
02:51:24,024 --> 02:51:26,943
I had gone to the country
to try to find food.

1995
02:51:27,027 --> 02:51:29,987
When I got back,
the police were in the building.

1996
02:51:30,072 --> 02:51:33,115
We made it our business
to learn how they knew.

1997
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:35,117
It was the thief
who told them.

1998
02:51:35,202 --> 02:51:37,161
We know the thief.
He was-

1999
02:51:37,245 --> 02:51:39,872
It seems strange to me now,

2000
02:51:39,957 --> 02:51:44,293
but we were all so full of hope
in the camp here in Holland
where they first took us.

2001
02:51:44,378 --> 02:51:46,796
The news of the war was good.

2002
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:49,256
The British and Americans
were sweeping through France.

2003
02:51:49,341 --> 02:51:52,426
We felt sure they would
get to us in time to-

2004
02:51:54,388 --> 02:51:56,389
But...

2005
02:51:57,432 --> 02:51:59,392
in September
we were shipped to Poland.

2006
02:51:59,476 --> 02:52:02,645
The men to one camp,
the women to another.

2007
02:52:04,398 --> 02:52:08,693
From there...
they were sent to Belsen.

2008
02:52:08,777 --> 02:52:11,404
I stayed in Auschwitz.

2009
02:52:11,488 --> 02:52:14,782
In January we were freed,
the few of us who were left.

2010
02:52:16,076 --> 02:52:18,244
The war was not yet over, no.

2011
02:52:20,747 --> 02:52:24,000
It took us a long time
to get home.

2012
02:52:24,084 --> 02:52:26,752
Each time the train
would stop, we'd...

2013
02:52:26,837 --> 02:52:29,797
all get out, you know,
at a siding or a crossing, and...

2014
02:52:29,881 --> 02:52:32,091
walk from group to group.

2015
02:52:33,468 --> 02:52:35,594
"Where were you?"

2016
02:52:35,679 --> 02:52:37,596
"Were you at Belsen?"

2017
02:52:37,681 --> 02:52:39,890
"At Buchenwald?"

2018
02:52:39,975 --> 02:52:42,852
"At Mauthausen? Where?"

2019
02:52:42,936 --> 02:52:45,354
"Is it possible that
you ever knew my wife?"

2020
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:48,357
"Did you ever see
my husband, my son,

2021
02:52:48,442 --> 02:52:50,443
my daughter?"

2022
02:52:58,243 --> 02:53:01,537
That's how I found out
about my wife's death,

Anne-

2027
02:53:14,509 --> 02:53:16,635
I still hoped-

2028
02:53:17,637 --> 02:53:22,016
Yesterday I was in Rotterdam.

2029
02:53:22,100 --> 02:53:25,102
I met a woman there.

2030
02:53:25,187 --> 02:53:28,397
She'd been in Belsen...
with Anne.

2031
02:53:33,111 --> 02:53:35,112
I know now.

In spite of everything,

2034
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:56,425
I still believe that people
are really good at heart.

2035
02:53:56,510 --> 02:53:59,220
She puts me to shame.
