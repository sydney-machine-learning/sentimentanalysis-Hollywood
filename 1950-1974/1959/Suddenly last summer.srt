1
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,085
1937

2
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,208
Gentlemen, I wanna welcome
you medical schoolmen...

3
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,286
...to our new operating theatre.

4
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:31,282
As you can see,
it isn't exactly what you'd call new.

5
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,838
Used to be a library
when this was a school...

6
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,081
...and maybe before that
some kind of a sugar warehouse.

7
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:40,207
Makeshift or not, the important
thing is that we got it.

8
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,287
The first to be devoted
to psychosurgery in this state.

9
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,519
And that is a great step forward.

10
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,959
Now you're going
to witness an operation...

11
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,047
...never performed before
in this state.

12
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,927
A lobotomy on a woman's brain...

13
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:55,967
...suffering from acute
schizophrenic withdrawal.

14
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,161
Our new staff member,
Dr. John Cukrowicz from Chicago...

15
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,479
...will perform this operation.

16
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:41,638
Swab.

17
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,368
Sew up, will you?

18
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,638
You have just witnessed a delicate
operation on the human brain...

19
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,199
...performed under the most
primitive surgical conditions...

20
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,481
...that I hope any of you
will ever encounter.

21
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,441
Excuse us, please.

22
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,398
- Son, I know how you feel.
- For six months...

23
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,242
...I have listened to you
promise me this and that.

24
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,639
- But I am not...
- I know, I know, I know.

25
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:26,085
You are not the state board of health.
I am not a witch doctor.

26
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,604
I need properly trained assistants.

27
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:31,647
I need an operating room
that doesn't fall apart.

28
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,521
At least lights that stay lit.

29
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:36,163
I know, but this is a state hospital.

30
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,240
There just isn't
enough money for us.

31
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,843
I can't promise
that there ever will be enough.

32
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,248
I'll go back to Chicago
or someplace where there is.

33
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,398
John.

34
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,447
Before you do that,
read this.

35
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,121
Who is Violet Venable?

36
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,598
You reveal your ignorance
of our fair city...

37
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,203
...of which Mrs. Venable
is the richest lady.

38
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:09,567
At one time, her husband owned most of
it. Now she's a widow and she owns it.

39
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:13,284
"...and was very interested
in the work of your Dr. Cukrowicz."

40
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,247
She must have read your
write-up in the <i>H</i>e<i>rald.</i>

41
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,078
"And I wonder if the foundation
I am establishing...

42
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,519
...might be of some assistance."

43
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,565
Son, with one signature
on one check...

44
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,289
...she can solve
all the problems we got.

45
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,408
"Also there is a matter
of some urgency...

46
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:33,918
...I should like to discuss with him.

47
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,287
Would 4:30 on Tuesday be convenient?"

48
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:38,928
That's today.

49
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,241
What is her urgency, do you know?

50
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,606
No, but I know what ours is.
Lack of money. Her money.

51
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,208
She is serious?

52
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,286
4:30 this afternoon, you'll know.

53
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:49,922
I can tell you this much.

54
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,405
I've been trying for years
just to see the Venable lawyers.

55
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,806
You've been invited by her.
That's a command performance.

56
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,159
That's how serious I think it is.

57
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,326
And this is serious too.

58
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:06,045
More than 1200 mental cases
Lions View can't afford to handle.

59
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,638
Good afternoon.

60
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,084
- Dr. Cukrowicz.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,642
- Take a seat, please.
- Thank you.

62
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,798
Mrs. Venable?

63
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,887
I am Miss Foxhill,
Mrs. Venable's secretary.

64
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,040
And you are Dr. Cukrowicz?

65
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:51,047
- Your appointment was for...?
- 4:30.

66
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:54,764
You are 23 seconds early.
Sit down, please.

67
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:56,523
Thank you.

68
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,608
Sebastian always said,
"Mother, when you descend...

69
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,959
...it's like the goddess
from the machine."

70
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,601
- Mrs. Venable's on her way down.
- I feel just like an angel...

71
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,562
...coming to earth
as I float, float into view.

72
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,158
Sebastian...

73
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:17,960
...my son, Sebastian, was
very interested in the Byzantine.

74
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,404
Are you interested
in the Byzantine, Dr...?

75
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,804
Cukrowicz.

76
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:24,199
I don't know very much
about the Byzantine.

77
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:28,158
The emperor of Byzantium,
when he received people in audience...

78
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,889
...had a throne which,
during the conversation...

79
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:35,361
...would rise mysteriously in the air
to the consternation of the visitors.

80
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,521
As we are living in a democracy,
I reverse the procedure.

81
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,327
I don't rise. I come down.

82
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,168
How do you do, Dr...?
Oh, I'm sorry, your name?

83
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,398
Cukrowicz.

84
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,322
It's a Polish word meaning "sugar."

85
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:52,044
Am I only wearing one earring?
Have I forgotten my lip rouge?

86
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,001
Excuse me, I...

87
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,201
I guess I had been told
you were a widow.

88
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,559
I am. I'm in mourning.

89
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,124
White was my son's favourite colour.

90
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:04,684
Perhaps, Dr. Sugar...

91
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,039
...you expected an old widow.

92
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,723
With a garnet brooch, a cane
and an ear trumpet.

93
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,800
I have all that
to look forward to.

94
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,321
Life is a thief. Sebastian always
said, "Life steals everything."

95
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,440
I want to show you his garden.

96
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,918
Are you sure you should go out,
Mrs. Venable?

97
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,239
Quite sure.
They treat me like an invalid.

98
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:28,529
You see, last spring I had a tiny
convulsion of a tiny blood vessel.

99
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,202
What did your doctor call it?

100
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:31,643
A malady of living.

101
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:36,041
After all, I've buried a husband
and a son. I'm a widow and a...

102
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,326
Funny, there's no word.

103
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,645
Lose your parents, you're an orphan.

104
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,966
Lose your only son and you are...

105
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:46,518
...nothing.

106
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,164
Foxhill.

107
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,087
Where are they?

108
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,487
I put them in the patio.

109
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:58,523
They sent them parcel post from
Pensacola. That's why they were late.

110
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,204
Another day and we'd have starved
to death. Come on, doctor.

111
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,127
In your letter,
you said an urgent matter.

112
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,679
I must say, you're handsomer
than your photograph in the paper...

113
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:12,761
...without that awful paraphernalia
you doctors wear.

114
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,563
Your son's favourite colour, white.

115
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:18,044
Such extraordinary eyes.

116
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,968
So like his. You must...

117
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:25,640
I almost said, "You must meet
my son Sebastian." Force of habit.

118
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,202
Is he the son who died?

119
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,922
Yes, last July, in Europe.

120
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,721
He must have been young to die.

121
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,004
All poets...

122
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,679
...whatever age they may seem
to others, die young.

123
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:10,205
- It's unexpected.
- Like the dawn of creation.

124
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,206
It was Sebastian's idea.

125
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:15,879
Part of his lifelong war
against the herbaceous border.

126
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,798
Not unlike a well-groomed jungle
and, frankly, a little terrifying.

127
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,727
So was creation.

128
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,086
So is creation.
Listen to them buzz, buzz.

129
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,682
What's in there?

130
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:29,443
This way, before our poor lady
dies of hunger.

131
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,447
The Latin names to the plants
are printed on tags...

132
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,679
...attached to them,
but the print's fading.

133
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:37,647
Those ones there
are the oldest plants on earth.

134
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:41,239
Survivors from the age
of the giant fern forest.

135
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,121
And here's my poor lady.

136
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:45,528
They never get away.

137
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:50,519
The lady exudes this marvellous
perfume which attracts them.

138
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,358
They plunge into her chalice.
And they never come out.

139
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,204
This operation
you perform is called...?

140
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,444
Lobotomy.

141
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,645
- That's an unusual...
- I hate these flies.

142
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,003
Foxhill!

143
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,324
Foxhill!

144
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:08,239
She loves feeding our wicked lady.
Foxhill's rather a brute.

145
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,526
Such an extravagance, really,
from early fall to late spring...

146
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,486
...lady must be kept under glass...

147
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:17,079
...and we have to provide her
with flies flown in at great expense.

148
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,319
Foxhill, you do the honours.

149
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,999
- Lady's very hungry today.
- Of course, Mrs. Venable.

150
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,923
I've never seen an insectivorous
plant before. What is it called?

151
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:29,165
The Venus flytrap.

152
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,360
A devouring organism...

153
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:34,686
...aptly named
for the goddess of love.

154
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:38,999
What was your son's work?
I mean, aside from this garden.

155
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:42,206
As many times as I've had
to answer that question...

156
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:44,360
...it still shocks me
a little to realize...

157
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,407
...that Sebastian Venable the poet
was quite unknown...

158
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:50,686
...outside of a small coterie
of friends, including his mother.

159
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:54,046
- Your son was a poet?
- His life was his occupation.

160
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,763
Yes. Yes, Sebastian was a poet.

161
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,841
That's what I meant
when I said his life was his work.

162
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:04,561
Because the work of a poet
is the life of a poet. And vice versa.

163
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,964
I mean, you can't separate them.
I mean...

164
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:10,081
...a poet's life is his work.

165
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,441
And his work is his life,
in a special sense.

166
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:21,801
- Are you all right?
- Right as rain, however right that is.

167
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:25,048
This operation of yours,
does it really work?

168
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,207
Yes, yes, it does.

169
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,365
However, it is very experimental.

170
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,482
I was struck by something
you said in the paper.

171
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:36,362
About the sharp knife in the mind.

172
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,281
That kills the devil in the soul?

173
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,325
I'm afraid I got a bit carried away.

174
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,361
No, what you said
was almost poetic itself.

175
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,688
Mrs. Venable, the work
of a doctor is his life too.

176
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,326
But we need help, particularly
in a field as experimental as mine.

177
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,044
Particularly at a state hospital
like Lions View.

178
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,078
We have very little money,
practically none.

179
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:04,762
Yes, I know.

180
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:06,198
Doctor...

181
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,401
...I have a niece by marriage...

182
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,486
...at a place called St. Mary's.

183
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:11,963
I've heard of it.

184
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,325
It's a custodial home for the insane.

185
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,965
She suffers from something
called dementia praecox.

186
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,284
From dementia praecox?

187
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,287
Which is to say, she's mad
as a hatter, poor child.

188
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,519
Would you like to
see Sebastian's studio?

189
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:28,125
It's at the end of the jungle
in what used to be the <i>garçonnière</i>.

190
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:29,881
An old New Orleans convenience.

191
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,047
A place where the young men
could go to be private.

192
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,921
You're not from New Orleans?

193
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,361
No, Chicago. Actually, dementia
praecox is a meaningless phrase...

194
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:43,323
Chicago. I've always wanted
to see two places before I die.

195
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:44,683
Hong Kong...

196
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,527
...and Chicago.

197
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:49,000
Now I shall never see either.

198
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:53,083
Because I must use every inch and
ounce of what little strength I have...

199
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,638
...in doing just what I'm doing.

200
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,441
The foundation you referred to?

201
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,243
Building a memorial to my son.

202
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,681
You see, Sebastian had
no public name as a poet.

203
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,800
He didn't want one.

204
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,045
He refused to have one.

205
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:13,128
He abhorred the false values
that come from being publicly known...

206
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:16,924
...from fame,
from personal exploitation.

207
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,718
He'd say to me, "Violet, Mother,
you're going to live longer than me.

208
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,285
When I'm gone, it will be yours
to do whatever you please with."

209
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,442
Meaning, of course,
his future recognition.

210
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,640
- You're very like him, doctor.
- In what way?

211
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:34,602
Because you, a doctor, a surgeon...

212
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:37,562
...are dedicated to your art.

213
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,926
Yes, to your art.
It is an art, what you do.

214
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:43,165
Using people the way he did.

215
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,485
Grandly, creatively.

216
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:48,238
Almost like God.

217
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,838
I'm afraid my art is to help.

218
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,438
Not to use, but to be used.

219
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,122
Well, it comes to the same,
doesn't it?

220
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,479
I mean, in the end.

221
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:03,320
Oh, I don't know what I mean.

222
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:07,565
There is the atelier,
Sebastian's studio.

223
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,006
Most people's lives...

224
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,968
...what are they
but trails of debris?

225
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,364
Each day more debris, more debris.

226
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,879
Long, long trails of debris...

227
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,605
...with nothing to clean it all up
but, finally, death.

228
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,797
I guess...

229
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:29,043
...quiet desperation
is the word for most lives.

230
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,200
But ours were different.

231
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,525
Sebastian's and mine.

232
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:38,439
I know it sounds
hopelessly vain to say...

233
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,799
...but we were a famous couple.

234
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,842
People didn't speak of Sebastian
and his mother...

235
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,517
...or Mrs. Venable and her son.

236
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,566
They said, "Sebastian and Violet.

237
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,125
Violet and Sebastian are at the Lido.
They're at the Ritz."

238
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,965
And every appearance,
every time we appeared...

239
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,524
...attention was centred on us.

240
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,726
Everyone else eclipsed.

241
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,047
My son, Sebastian...

242
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,041
...and I...

243
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,160
...constructed our days.

244
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:12,442
Each day, we would carve each day
like a piece of sculpture.

245
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,204
We left behind us a trail of days...

246
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,639
...like a gallery of sculpture...

247
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,318
...until suddenly, last summer...

248
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,488
Your son died?

249
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:36,883
You say that your niece suffers
from dementia praecox.

250
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,364
There must have been
a more exact diagnosis.

251
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,643
Such a pretty name for a disease.

252
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,204
Sounds like a rare flower,
doesn't it?

253
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,877
Night-blooming dementia praecox.

254
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,198
What form does her disturbance take?

255
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:53,524
Madness.

256
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,806
Obsession, memory.

257
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,529
She lacerates herself with memory.

258
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,122
Memory of what?

259
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:02,604
Visions, hallucinations.

260
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,126
It all started last summer.

261
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:10,005
The first I knew, there was a cable
from this clinic in Paris...

262
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:13,201
...saying, "Your niece is out
of her mind. What shall we do?"

263
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,439
I was almost out of my mind
last summer.

264
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:19,079
Sebastian had just died, I was ill,
but I did everything I could.

265
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,008
I said, "Send her straight home
with a nurse."

266
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,769
So they put her on the <i>B</i>e<i>re</i><i>ngaria...</i>

267
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,803
...locked in her stateroom
like a wild animal.

268
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:30,164
She was taken straight to St. Mary's.

269
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,203
And now they can't keep her there,
they can't help her...

270
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,360
...or cope with her fits of violence.

271
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:40,005
Her babbling.
Her dreadful, obscene babbling.

272
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:44,043
- What kind of babbling?
- Fantastic delusions and babblings...

273
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,682
...of an unspeakable nature.

274
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:48,119
Mostly taking the form
of hideous attacks...

275
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,480
...on the moral character
of my son, Sebastian.

276
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:54,960
And now they tell me at St. Mary's...

277
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,000
...the Mother Superior tells me...

278
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,803
...that we must find
another place for her.

279
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,758
And then I read about you...

280
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,240
...about your operation,
and I thought:

281
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,724
"This may be the answer
to all our prayers."

282
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,245
You must realize
the operation I do...

283
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:16,082
...is only for the unapproachable,
for the hopeless.

284
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,446
If she isn't unapproachable
and hopeless, I don't know who is.

285
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,088
- The things she says.
- What?

286
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:23,319
- Terrible, obscene things.
- Such as?

287
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,241
Oh, anything.

288
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:26,637
Such as?

289
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,007
All right, you asked.

290
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,598
This happened recently at St. Mary's.

291
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:35,119
Catherine accused an elderly gardener
of making love to her.

292
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:37,559
They questioned the gardener,
an old man.

293
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,162
It was the other way around.

294
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:42,844
Catherine had made advances to him,
spoken obscenely to him.

295
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,887
When confronted with her lies,
she fought and screamed.

296
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,880
It took four nuns to control her.

297
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,758
Now I'm put on notice that they
won't keep her there after this week.

298
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,487
You see why I said urgent.

299
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,281
Yes, I do. I certainly do.

300
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,838
It's important I see her
as soon as possible.

301
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,648
And help her. If you can't,
I'm at my wits' end.

302
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,085
I can transfer her to Lions View.
She won't be as comfortable...

303
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,398
I understand.

304
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,679
But the important thing
is you, doctor.

305
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,363
You'll be happy to know
that at this very minute...

306
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,283
...my lawyers are working on the
Sebastian Venable Memorial Foundation...

307
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:17,959
...to subsidize the work
of young people like yourself...

308
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,081
...who are pushing out
the frontiers of art and science...

309
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:22,921
...but have a financial problem.

310
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:27,243
Mrs. Venable, loving your niece
as you do, you must know...

311
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:30,202
...there's great risk
in this operation.

312
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:34,681
When you enter the brain with a foreign
object, even a needle-thin knife...

313
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,119
...in the hands
of the most skilled surgeon...

314
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,762
...there still is
a great deal of risk.

315
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,438
But it does pacify them,
I've read that.

316
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,800
It quiets them down.
It makes them peaceful.

317
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,684
- Yes, that it does do, but...
- But what?

318
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:54,359
Well, it will be years before we know
if the benefits...

319
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:57,037
...of the operation are lasting...

320
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,684
...or maybe just passing
or perhaps...

321
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,003
There's a strong possibility that
the patient will always be limited.

322
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:07,485
Relieved of acute anxiety,
yes, but limited.

323
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:11,728
But what a blessing to them, doctor,
to be just peaceful.

324
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,126
To be just suddenly peaceful.

325
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,800
After all that horror...

326
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,165
...after those nightmares...

327
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:25,039
...just to be able to lift up
their eyes to a sky...

328
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,479
...not black with savage,
devouring birds.

329
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:30,806
You said a sky filled
with savage, devouring birds?

330
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:31,998
Did I?

331
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:35,724
How odd. I hadn't thought
about all that in years.

332
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,760
Now, why should I suddenly...?

333
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:42,042
Yes, we saw those birds
one summer in the Pacific.

334
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:46,037
You see, my son
Sebastian was looking for...

335
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:50,003
- Looking for what?
- Rare, hungry birds.

336
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:53,998
- That's not what you started to say.
- You're too quick for me.

337
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:58,361
I was going to say my son
Sebastian was looking for God.

338
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,447
I stopped myself.
I thought you'd think:

339
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:05,881
"What a pretentious young crackpot."
Which Sebastian was not.

340
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,446
This is something
I've never told anyone before.

341
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,287
Something so terrible.

342
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:15,641
Forgive me if I sound quite mad,
but it's true all the same.

343
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:18,807
Sebastian saw the face of God.

344
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,085
I'd like to hear about that.

345
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,917
Yes, yes.

346
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:29,241
One long ago summer,
sitting right here in this garden...

347
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,122
...Sebastian said,
"Mother, listen to this."

348
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,566
And he read me
Herman Melville's description...

349
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:39,358
...of the Encantadas,
the Galapagos Islands.

350
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:43,357
He read me that description
and said we had to go there.

351
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,639
So we did go there that summer...

352
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:48,204
...on a boat,
a four-masted schooner...

353
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,958
...the sort of boat that Melville
would have sailed on.

354
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,285
We saw the Encantadas.

355
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:57,003
But on the Encantadas
we saw something...

356
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:59,279
...that he hadn't written about.

357
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:02,527
We saw the sea turtles
crawl out of the sea...

358
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:04,685
...for their annual egg-laying.

359
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:07,881
Once a year, the female
of the sea turtles...

360
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:11,525
...crawls out of the sea
onto the blazing sand beach...

361
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:15,608
...of a volcanic island
to dig a pit in the sand...

362
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,243
...and deposit her eggs there.

363
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:22,442
It's a long and dreadful thing,
the depositing of the eggs in the sand.

364
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,247
And when it's finished...

365
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:29,967
...the exhausted female turtle
crawls back to the sea half-dead.

366
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,239
She never sees her offspring.

367
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,198
But we did.

368
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:38,880
Sebastian knew exactly when
the sea turtle eggs would be hatched.

369
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:42,081
- We returned in time for it.
- You went back?

370
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:47,238
In time to witness the hatching
and their desperate flight to the sea.

371
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:51,920
The narrow beach, the colour
of caviar, was all in motion.

372
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:55,519
The sky was in motion,
full of flesh-eating birds.

373
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,526
And the noise of the birds...

374
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,038
...their savage cries
as they circled...

375
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,285
...over the beach
of the Encantadas...

376
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:05,481
...while the new sea turtles
scrambled out...

377
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:08,078
...and started their race to the sea.

378
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,599
- Race to the sea?
- To escape the flesh-eating birds...

379
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,448
...that made the sky almost black.

380
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:19,598
And I said, "Sebastian, no.
No, it's not like that."

381
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,808
But he made me look.
He made me see that terrible sight.

382
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,364
- What was not like that?
- Life.

383
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:28,202
I said, " No.

384
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,765
No! That's not true!"

385
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:33,482
But he said it is.

386
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:37,398
He said, " Look, Violet.
Look, there on the shore."

387
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,921
And I looked and saw the sand
all alive, all alive...

388
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:45,246
...as the new-hatched sea turtles
dashed to the sea...

389
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:48,725
...while the birds hovered
and swooped to attack...

390
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:51,887
...and hovered and swooped to attack.

391
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:55,721
They were diving down
on the sea turtles...

392
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:01,003
...turning them over
to expose their soft undersides...

393
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,121
...tearing their undersides open...

394
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:08,278
...and rending and eating their flesh.

395
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,726
Sebastian guessed that possibly...

396
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,001
...only a hundredth
of one percent of their number...

397
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,961
...would escape to the sea.

398
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,605
Nature isn't created
in the image of man's compassion.

399
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,401
Nature is cruel!

400
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:30,319
Sebastian knew it all along,
was born knowing it, but not I.

401
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:35,000
I said, " No, no, those are
only birds, turtles, not us."

402
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:37,279
I didn't know then it was us.

403
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:42,165
That we are all of us trapped
by this devouring creation.

404
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:45,998
I couldn't, wouldn't face
the horror of the truth...

405
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,677
...even that last day
in the Encantadas...

406
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,686
...when Sebastian left me...

407
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:53,847
...and spent the whole
blazing, equatorial day...

408
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,564
...in the crow's-nest,
watching that thing on the beach...

409
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,879
...until it was too dark to see.

410
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:04,241
When he came down the rigging,
he said, "Now I've seen him."

411
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:07,839
- And he meant God.
- Do you believe he saw God?

412
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,519
He saw the whole thing there
that day on the beach.

413
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:14,402
But I was like you. I said no.

414
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:16,600
I refused to believe...

415
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,087
...until suddenly, last summer,
I learned my son was right.

416
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:25,437
What he had shown me
in the Encantadas was the horrible...

417
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:28,038
...the inescapable truth.

418
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:43,158
Violet, honey.

419
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,369
- You gave me a turn.
- Hi, Aunt Vi.

420
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,203
Why are you two here?

421
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:51,719
We came for Sebastian's
clothes, like you said.

422
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,638
- Remember? Like you said.
- So we just kind of let ourselves in.

423
00:27:55,849 --> 00:28:01,162
- I must have got hold of this letter.
- Caught on your sleeve probably.

424
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:06,284
That's Mrs. Holly, mother of the
St. Mary's girl, and that's her son.

425
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:10,118
Apparently, I said
he could have Sebastian's clothes.

426
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:14,607
You haven't forgotten what you said
at Elaine Tutweiler's?

427
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,481
Since I was going to college...

428
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:19,686
...I could have Cousin
Sebastian's clothes.

429
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:21,163
You did say that.

430
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,599
You said
that Son here could have...

431
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:27,399
I'm accused of generosity.
Now will you please...?

432
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,358
Aunt Violet is generous,
so generous to her family, Mr...

433
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:32,797
What's your name?

434
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:35,807
- Dr. Cukrowicz.
- Are you a doctor?

435
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:38,284
- Violet, you're not ill again?
- No, Grace!

436
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,888
I'm so relieved.

437
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:44,526
I was afraid you had another of those
strokes of yours. Those seizures.

438
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:49,962
I've never had a seizure nor a stroke.
We were discussing your daughter.

439
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:52,888
My poor lamb, my poor little girl.

440
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:56,081
- Can you help her?
- I'm gonna try to, if I can.

441
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,281
Mama, look here! White silk.

442
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,562
"Made in Rome."

443
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,727
Oh, boy, is this one gonna
pick up lipstick!

444
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,160
Take the clothes.
Don't flaunt them in my face.

445
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:11,247
Why don't you both let yourselves out?

446
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:16,000
- Get the rest another time.
- It won't take two seconds to finish.

447
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:20,680
It's impossible that Sebastian
won't walk through that door again...

448
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:23,961
...with all those bright people
he used to know.

449
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:25,921
All laughing, carrying on...

450
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:30,122
...saying those witty things
that were way over my poor head.

451
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,684
He was such a tease too.
You know...

452
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:36,279
...he told me that the piece of lace
on this table...

453
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:41,040
...was made by these blind nuns
in Belgium. Imagine!

454
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:44,559
- I thought I'd gone through everything.
- Who is that?

455
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:48,682
- It's the girl.
- Why, that's my poor angel, Catherine.

456
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:52,399
- I wonder why he put it there.
- Maybe he liked her.

457
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,684
George, take your plunder
and get out of here.

458
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:00,001
- Okay.
- This must've been taken last spring.

459
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,677
She's wearing her Mardi Gras gown.

460
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:06,802
Remember how lovely she was?
You loaned her your fur coat.

461
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:09,125
I remember everything.

462
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:12,961
I guess it was not exactly
a happy evening.

463
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:17,686
- What did happen?
- She was, she is a lovely girl.

464
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,562
And I must say, of all my relations...

465
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:25,240
...my delightful relations,
she was the one most like me.

466
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:27,560
That's why you've got to save her.

467
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:30,926
Because madness is the most horrible
doom on this earth.

468
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,917
Every item here has been inventoried
by the insurance people.

469
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:38,166
They'd be upset
if anything were missing.

470
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,925
- What do you think I am?
- On that subject, my lips are sealed.

471
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:45,359
Now, both of you, please go.

472
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:47,844
- It's almost 5:00.
- That's right.

473
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:50,688
Violet always has,
I mean, used to have...

474
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:53,687
...her 5:00 daiquiri
here with Sebastian.

475
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:55,607
Now I have it here alone.

476
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:58,443
Well, we must fly now.

477
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:02,198
I do pray you can help my poor Cathy.
Goodbye.

478
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,721
Violet, bye now.
Say thank you, George.

479
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:09,762
Bye, Aunt Violet.
Thanks for everything.

480
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:14,201
Aren't they awful?
Sebastian and I used to speculate...

481
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,445
...on how those Neanderthals...

482
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,800
...could've produced a girl
as rare as Catherine.

483
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,885
You would have liked Sebastian
and he would have been charmed by you.

484
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:28,798
He wasn't a family or a money snob,
but he was a snob.

485
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:32,285
He was a snob about loveliness
in things...

486
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:36,562
...about personal charm
and physical grace in people.

487
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,521
We always had a perfect troupe...

488
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:43,245
...of beautiful people around us
always, whenever we travelled.

489
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:47,007
- May I sit here?
- Sebastian's seat.

490
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,564
- Oh, well...
- No, no, please.

491
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,206
It's a court jester's chair.
A rare one, 500 years old.

492
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:56,799
Please, sit on it.

493
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:00,963
Say something funny.
Make me stop wanting to cry.

494
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:05,121
I'm afraid I'd make
a miserable jester.

495
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:08,919
I get concerned when
people stop wanting to cry.

496
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:11,597
Time for your medicine and daiquiri.

497
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:13,686
In that order.

498
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,687
Isn't it nice of the drugstore
to keep me alive?

499
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:19,208
- Thank you.
- Foxhill...

500
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:23,925
See the Hollys off the premises.
They're apt to remove the silver.

501
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:25,568
Yes, Mrs. Venable.

502
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,523
He would sit in his chair,
I in mine, at 5:00 every day...

503
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:33,358
...and we'd have daiquiris
with St. Sebastian brooding above us.

504
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,317
But you stayed here last summer.

505
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:39,925
I did. I wasn't well.
He took Catherine with him.

506
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:42,120
- And he died.
- Of a heart attack.

507
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,648
Was she with him?

508
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:48,400
She was there with him when he died,
and that day she lost her mind.

509
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:50,964
When will you see her, doctor?

510
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:53,405
As soon as I can.

511
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:58,480
What can I tell Dr. Hockstader
about your interest in helping us?

512
00:32:58,689 --> 00:33:00,998
Can't that wait until
you've met my niece...

513
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:04,679
...and decided if you think
your operation could help her?

514
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:06,845
Yes, of course it can wait.

515
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:09,517
Surely there's no connection between...

516
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:14,166
Aren't we more interested in something
that concerns us personally?

517
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,326
Aren't we, doctor?

518
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:18,681
I understand.

519
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,240
I can find my way out.

520
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,802
Millions of years ago, dinosaurs fed
on leaves of those trees.

521
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,842
They were vegetarians.
That's why they became extinct.

522
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,398
They were just too gentle
for their size.

523
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:36,886
Then the carnivores,
the ones that eat flesh...

524
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,603
...the killers inherited the earth.

525
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,085
But then they always do, don't they?

526
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,927
Catherine.

527
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:03,727
It's Sister Felicity, Catherine.

528
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,922
Please get up. You're to come with me.

529
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:07,480
Catherine.

530
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:11,044
I'm not being violent, Sister.

531
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:30,883
What are you doing, Catherine?

532
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:35,321
Just smoking a cigarette.

533
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:40,883
Now, you know we're not allowed
to smoke at St. Mary's.

534
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:44,001
- Please let me smoke. Please.
- Give it here.

535
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:47,804
- Don't be such a bully!
- Disobedience has to be paid for.

536
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:51,206
- I'll pay for it later.
- Now, Catherine.

537
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:53,843
I'm putting out my hand for it.

538
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:56,444
- All right, take it!
- You burned me!

539
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:59,163
- I'm sorry...
- You deliberately burned me.

540
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:02,805
- You said to...
- You stuck the lit end into my hand.

541
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:06,524
I'm so sick of being
bossed and bullied.

542
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,287
I'm sick of being...

543
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:12,280
You saw that.
Saw her deliberately burn me.

544
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:15,879
- You better put something on that.
- I can't leave.

545
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:19,440
- Patients classified as violent...
- Sister.

546
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:23,483
Very well, doctor. I'll wait outside.

547
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:28,483
Just outside the door.

548
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:33,765
You're very brave
being in the room alone with me.

549
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,881
- Do you plan to burn me too?
- Oh, much worse.

550
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,918
I'm classified as violent.

551
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:43,485
I'm apt to attack you
and then accuse you of rape.

552
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:48,128
- Do you do that sort of thing?
- That's why I'm in isolation.

553
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:52,444
I molested an elderly gardener
of great virtue.

554
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:56,358
When he refused my advances,
I denounced him as a lecher.

555
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:59,317
After that, I was punished.

556
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:00,922
Was it true?

557
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,365
That I was punished? Yes.

558
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:07,960
- That you accused him unjustly.
- Of course I accused him unjustly.

559
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:09,727
After all, I'm insane.

560
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:13,285
It's the sort of thing
an insane woman would do.

561
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:19,127
Besides, haven't you noticed
how oddly I've been looking at you?

562
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,438
Have you?

563
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:23,726
How I've been staring at your eyes.

564
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:27,724
Your beautiful, blue, frightened eyes.

565
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:31,001
Why are they so frightened?
Do you need help?

566
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,246
Do you want help from me?

567
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:37,044
I'm making you nervous.

568
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,365
You have every reason to be.

569
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:44,520
Because now I'm going
to attack you. Yes, attack.

570
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,685
It won't be for your beauty.

571
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,120
No, it's for these cigarettes.
Let me have one.

572
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,684
Of course. Help yourself.

573
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:56,080
You are good.

574
00:37:57,249 --> 00:38:00,685
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

575
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:03,284
- Sent by my aunt?
- Yes.

576
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,959
- As I haven't responded to treatment.
- So they say.

577
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:11,606
You've been invited to try
your hand at what is a hopeless case.

578
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:15,802
Is it hopeless? What do you think?

579
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,002
- Where are you from?
- Lions View.

580
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,885
The state asylum.

581
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,760
Where they have the Drum.

582
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:35,405
What you call the Drum
is not a torture chamber.

583
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:38,487
It's really a recreation hall.

584
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:41,688
They'll keep me there forever.

585
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,687
Like an animal in a cage.

586
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:48,766
- She is merciless, isn't she?
- Who?

587
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,762
Aunt Violet. Why else
do you think I'm here?

588
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,204
Where no one can see me, hear me?

589
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:57,128
You sound as if you think
she hates you.

590
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:58,398
Doesn't she?

591
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,679
Do you hate her?

592
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:02,965
What, hate?

593
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:06,684
No. I don't understand what hate is...

594
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,801
...or how anyone could hate
and still be sane.

595
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,523
I really do think I am sane...

596
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:15,926
...despite considerable evidence
to the contrary.

597
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:21,965
- Your aunt, Mrs. Venable...
- Can no more help herself than I could.

598
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:24,558
Help herself? How do you mean?

599
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:27,764
You see, we all loved Sebastian.

600
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:32,247
Women, men, children, animal,
mineral, vegetable...

601
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:35,885
Sebastian was a vocation, not a man.

602
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:40,007
Poor Aunt Vi was hooked
from the beginning.

603
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:43,201
Loved Sebastian and nobody else.

604
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:46,446
She gave up everything for Sebastian.

605
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,446
Even her husband.

606
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:51,447
What was Mr. Venable like?

607
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:54,038
Mr. Venable was a good man...

608
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:57,480
...but dull to the point of genius.

609
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,845
That was Sebastian talking.

610
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:03,927
From him,
it wouldn't have sounded cruel.

611
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:08,799
When I talk like him or when Aunt Vi
talks like him, we sound heartless.

612
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:12,922
And we're not really.
Though we do terrible things.

613
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:16,087
What do you consider terrible?

614
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:20,045
Aunt Vi let her husband die
because of Sebastian.

615
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:23,082
Killed him, some people thought.

616
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,524
How, killed him?

617
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:29,881
Once, Sebastian decided to give up
the torments of this world...

618
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:33,280
...and become a Buddhist monk.
That was in Tibet.

619
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:37,607
He shaved his head, was given
a wooden bowl and was happy.

620
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,527
Till Aunt Vi came.

621
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,640
Why? What did she do?

622
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:45,967
Lived in a hut, even took vows,
or whatever women do.

623
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:50,481
Anything to be near him,
to get to him, to make him come home.

624
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:52,799
While there, word came.

625
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:56,206
Mr. Venable was dying.
He had to see her.

626
00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:58,201
And she chose to stay?

627
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:02,883
She chose to let her husband
die alone.

628
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:07,287
If you'd known Sebastian, you'd
understand she had no choice...

629
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:12,563
...how none of us ever had a choice,
once Sebastian had decided we were...

630
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,487
...to be used.

631
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,042
Used?

632
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:18,968
You mean he used people?

633
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,682
Yes.

634
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:24,964
Isn't that what love is?
Using people?

635
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:29,845
And maybe that's what hate is.
Not being able to use people.

636
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:32,080
- Go on.
- Go on where?

637
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,007
Anywhere.

638
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:38,088
To the first memory you come to.

639
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:40,127
My first memory?

640
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:43,483
It was once at a Mardi Gras ball.

641
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:46,239
The Mardi Gras ball? Yes?

642
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:50,283
My very first memory.

643
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:52,679
It was last spring.

644
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:57,883
Before last spring,
I remember nothing. Nothing at all.

645
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:02,885
It's as if my life began
and ended that night.

646
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,760
Tell me about it.

647
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:10,678
At the ball...

648
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:16,203
I was taken there by some boy
who got too drunk to stand.

649
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,560
I wanted to leave.
My coat was in the cloakroom.

650
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:23,648
They couldn't find the check for it,
so I said, "Let it go"...

651
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:26,522
...and started out for a taxi.

652
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:29,602
Then somebody took my arm and said:

653
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:32,403
"I'll drive you home."

654
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:36,961
As we left, he took off his coat
and put it around my shoulders...

655
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:39,763
...and then I looked at him.

656
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:43,678
I don't think I've ever seen him
before then, really.

657
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:48,083
He took me home.
But he took me another place first.

658
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:52,318
Near the Duelling Oaks at the end
of Esplanade Street.

659
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:57,284
We stopped. I asked what for.

660
00:42:57,569 --> 00:42:59,525
He didn't answer.

661
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:02,448
Just struck a match
to light a cigarette...

662
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:06,881
...and I looked at him,
and I knew what for.

663
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:14,162
I think I got out of the car before
he got out of the car, and we...

664
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:19,443
...walked through the wet grass
toward the great misty oaks as if...

665
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:21,879
...as if somebody were...

666
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:25,286
...calling for help there.

667
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:31,005
And after that?

668
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:37,241
I lost him.

669
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,680
He took me home.

670
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:45,484
Then he said an awful
thing to me. He said:

671
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:48,125
"We'd better forget it.

672
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:52,880
My wife's expecting a child, and..."

673
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:59,277
I just entered the house
and sat there thinking a while.

674
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:04,167
I called a taxi and rushed
to the Roosevelt Hotel ballroom.

675
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,325
The ball was still going on.

676
00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:10,761
I thought I'd gone back
to pick up my coat. But I hadn't.

677
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:16,287
I hadn't gone back for that at all.
I'd gone back to make a scene.

678
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:20,562
I didn't pick up Aunt Violet's
silver fox in the coatroom.

679
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:25,240
I rushed right into the ballroom,
spotted him on the floor...

680
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:28,043
...ran up to him and started...

681
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:32,879
...to beat him in the face
and the chest with my fists till...

682
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:38,083
...Cousin Sebastian took me away.

683
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,280
Miss Catherine?

684
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,086
Miss Catherine?

685
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:55,283
She's here. Miss Catherine's here.

686
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:58,601
In spirit as well as flesh.

687
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:02,006
And now you want to play a game.
Look at pictures?

688
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:06,600
Tell you the first thing that comes
into my mind, my poor deranged mind.

689
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,401
All right.

690
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:13,917
That shadow on the wall.
What does it look like to you?

691
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,159
Like a shadow on a wall.

692
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:19,360
I thought we were gonna play a game.

693
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,038
All right.

694
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,682
I see forests.

695
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,164
Trees, a girl.

696
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:30,726
And those trees
are the Duelling Oaks...

697
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:35,726
...and that tormented figure
is the girl, Catherine, losing her...

698
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:37,123
...honour.

699
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,478
I'm trying to make you
feel sorry for her.

700
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:44,120
- I hope I am.
- I am sorry.

701
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,167
I believe you really are.

702
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:53,288
Tell me about your cousin, Sebastian.

703
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:57,961
He liked me, so I loved him.

704
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:01,241
How? I mean, in what way
did you love him?

705
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:04,000
The only way he'd accept.

706
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:11,718
- I tried to save him, doctor.
- Save him from what?

707
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:17,884
Completing a sort of image
he had of himself...

708
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,961
...as a sort of a sacrifice
to a terrible sort of a...

709
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:25,085
- God?
- Yes.

710
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:29,325
Sebastian, who was gentle, kind...

711
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:32,919
...saw something not gentle,
not kind, in the universe.

712
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:34,847
Something...

713
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:39,082
- Something terrible in himself.
- What was it? Can you tell me?

714
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:43,920
- One day at Cabeza de Lobo...
- Where?

715
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:50,357
That's where we were last summer.
That's where...

716
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:52,959
That's where Sebastian died?

717
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:55,004
Yes.

718
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:56,638
How did he die?

719
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:02,761
They say a heart attack,
but I don't remember. I really don't.

720
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:06,803
You see, afterwards,
I was hysterical, taut.

721
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:09,521
Said things I don't remember.

722
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:11,607
That's why I'm here.

723
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,159
Because I say things people don't...

724
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,167
...and then I don't even remember.

725
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,007
Try to remember.

726
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:27,602
You and Sebastian, last summer...

727
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,047
Try to remember.

728
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:41,365
The beach was very white.

729
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:44,839
Oh, how the sun burned.

730
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:50,560
It was like the eye of God
watching us.

731
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:53,165
Burning, burning.

732
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:56,404
There was no air that day.

733
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,362
The sun had burned up all the air.

734
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:04,322
Outside it was like inside a furnace.

735
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:10,806
- Then they came.
- Who came?

736
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,084
From all parts of the beach.

737
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:17,839
And that awful noise they made.

738
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:23,481
The noise of musical instruments
all made of tin.

739
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:25,363
Who is "they"?

740
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:30,408
And that, that music.

741
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:33,367
That awful music.

742
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:36,960
I hear that music!

743
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:39,760
I still hear it!

744
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:43,521
It's getting closer and closer!

745
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,923
Sebastian! Help!

746
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:54,879
- What happened? What happened then?
- I don't remember after that!

747
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:57,918
Stop that this minute.
Stop that noise.

748
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:00,649
- Doctor, I must see you at once.
- Get out of here.

749
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:04,325
Sister, get out and don't
come back until I call you.

750
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:14,327
I can't remember.

751
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:18,522
- I can't remember!
- It's all right.

752
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,087
- Don't worry, it's all right.
- But I have to, I want to!

753
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:24,682
Then you will.

754
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,408
Will you help me?

755
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:29,567
- Lf you let me.
- Yes.

756
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:35,447
I shouldn't have done that.

757
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:38,368
Why not?
It was a friendly kiss, wasn't it?

758
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:40,843
Maybe it wasn't.

759
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:44,039
Maybe now you'll think
that all those...

760
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:47,042
...stories about the gardener
are true.

761
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:49,444
Whatever's true, we'll find.

762
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:07,161
I want you to know that
I can look attractive...

763
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:09,680
...if I had my hair done and if...

764
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:13,929
When I'm at Lions View,
may I wear a pretty dress?

765
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:15,488
If you like.

766
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:22,322
Just imagine, once again
to be able to do...

767
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:25,123
...one thing I'd like.

768
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:48,647
Come out here, son.
I want you to see something.

769
00:50:55,729 --> 00:51:00,484
Take a good long look.
Tell me, what do you see?

770
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:04,837
Old tires, tin cans,
and a "Drink Nehi" sign.

771
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:06,846
That's the past you're looking at.

772
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:09,517
Thanks to a certain young man
from Chicago...

773
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:12,004
...there'll be a new building
on that lot...

774
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:16,919
...devoted to psychosurgery, dedicated
to the memory of Sebastian Venable.

775
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:19,880
I wish I were that optimistic.

776
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:24,328
I've been working with
the lawyers and accountants.

777
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,400
And we're getting, listen to this...

778
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:30,727
...in big, round, beautiful figures,
$1 million.

779
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:34,558
- Just like that, no strings attached?
- No strings attached.

780
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:38,125
She wants you, and nobody else,
to do the operation on her niece.

781
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,366
You can't blame her for that.
There isn't anybody better.

782
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:46,719
Something horrible happened
to that girl last summer.

783
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:51,925
Some dreadful, traumatic experience
of some kind.

784
00:51:52,129 --> 00:51:53,278
What?

785
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:55,919
I don't know.
I haven't found out yet.

786
00:51:56,649 --> 00:51:59,686
And she refuses to allow herself
to remember.

787
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:02,883
She's gonna have to be made
to remember.

788
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:05,518
Come in.

789
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:07,362
Excuse me, Dr. Hockstader.

790
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:10,561
Mrs. Holly and her son are here
to see the new patient.

791
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:13,124
Have them wait in my office, will you?

792
00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:15,439
- How's Miss Catherine?
- She looks lovely.

793
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:19,483
She had her hair done this morning.
She's wearing her own clothes.

794
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:23,682
I've never seen clothes like
that girl's got. From Paris! And...

795
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:27,361
Thank you, Miss Benson.
I'll be along.

796
00:52:28,169 --> 00:52:31,559
But she's a patient. You can't
let her wear her own clothes.

797
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:34,926
I put her in the nurses' wing.
I don't want her in the ward.

798
00:52:35,129 --> 00:52:36,801
The nurses' wing?

799
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:39,324
I know I'm taking a risk...

800
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:42,680
...but for a while I don't want her
to feel she's a patient.

801
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:46,848
I want her to feel she's free of
restrictions, free of being watched.

802
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:48,323
This is very unorthodox.

803
00:52:48,649 --> 00:52:50,605
So is insanity.
That's why we're here.

804
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:54,119
Seems your whole approach
has little to do with neurosurgery.

805
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:58,085
- For the time being.
- That's what this new building is for.

806
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:02,243
- Dedicated to neurosurgery.
- Yes, I know.

807
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:06,681
Mrs. Venable thinks you're prepared
to go ahead with the operation.

808
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:09,088
Yes, I know.

809
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:25,920
Cathy's in there?
George, hold me now.

810
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:29,161
I'm so nervous, I could jump
clear out of my skin.

811
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,439
Well, don't, Mama.

812
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,843
- Kitten!
- Miss Benson, you can go to lunch now.

813
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:46,486
- Thank you, doctor.
- My poor baby. My angel.

814
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:50,159
- In this place.
- It's all right, Mama. I'm just fine.

815
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:53,202
You look pretty good,
Cathy, considering.

816
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:56,481
- So do you, George, considering.
- We wanted to see you.

817
00:53:56,689 --> 00:53:59,487
But Violet said no,
not while you were at St. Mary's.

818
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:04,001
The doctors there didn't want
anybody to see you, so we didn't.

819
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:06,006
My, that's a pretty dress.

820
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,838
- When did you get that?
- In Paris. Sebastian bought it.

821
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:13,246
Yeah? I'm wearing one of his suits.

822
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:15,405
Yes, I recognize it.

823
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:18,681
Wasn't it sweet of Vi to give George
his wardrobe?

824
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:21,079
Not that she could've done
anything with it.

825
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:24,918
It's the thought behind the deed
that matters.

826
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:27,359
Have you seen Aunt Vi recently?

827
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:30,367
Yes, we saw her last night.
At her house.

828
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:33,208
She invited us to a private supper.

829
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:36,879
She's had this elevator installed.
Cutest thing you ever saw...

830
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:38,881
We've got business to talk about.

831
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:42,206
I know, son. You know
how children are. They're critical.

832
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:44,719
What did Aunt Vi say last night?

833
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:48,285
That you were
in extremely capable hands.

834
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,367
And I can tell they are capable too.

835
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:54,208
Mr. Brossard, the new lawyer we got...

836
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:57,128
Such a nice man too,
a tower of strength...

837
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,287
...in all these months
since Sebastian's been gone.

838
00:55:00,489 --> 00:55:03,765
It nearly killed Violet.
I know, I was there.

839
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:09,168
You didn't see her the way I did,
grieving like a madwoman.

840
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:13,048
I mean, like her heart would break.

841
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:18,762
He was her whole life. She worshipped
the ground beneath his feet.

842
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:22,678
When she got this letter
from that place with the funny name...

843
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:23,878
What letter?

844
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:28,287
From the authorities, telling about
what happened to him at...

845
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:31,526
What was the name of that place,
honey, where he passed on?

846
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:33,407
- Cabeza de Lobo.
- That's it!

847
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:35,167
- Did you see the letter?
- No.

848
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:38,845
But I guess it told about
how he had this heart attack...

849
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:42,644
...and how Catherine was
not quite herself, poor baby.

850
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:45,761
I'm myself now, Mama.
Aren't I, doctor?

851
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,728
Of course you are.

852
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,284
Don't worry a thing about
what people say.

853
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:53,327
Nobody in the city knows about
what you've been through.

854
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:55,167
Do they, George? Not a thing.

855
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:57,837
Nobody even knows you've come back
from Europe.

856
00:55:58,049 --> 00:55:59,880
When they question us
or inquire...

857
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:04,162
...we just say that you stayed abroad
to study something or other.

858
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:09,081
- Can we talk to Catherine alone?
- Yes, on a private family matter.

859
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:13,965
Just some papers gotta be signed.
Some business.

860
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:17,008
Is that all right?

861
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:21,367
Don't worry. Since I've been allowed
to smoke, I've become a perfect lamb.

862
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:25,363
My little girl was
always a perfect lamb.

863
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:28,561
Thank you.

864
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:40,288
- Cathy, Sebastian left a will.
- A generous, thoughtful will.

865
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:43,845
He bequeathed to us,
to you and to me, $50,000 each...

866
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,806
...after taxes are paid.

867
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:49,001
- Sebastian always was very kind.
- Isn't that the truth?

868
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:50,528
But there is a problem.

869
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:54,881
It's very complicated, but
Mr. Brossard, this new lawyer, is...

870
00:56:55,089 --> 00:56:59,162
...trying to get it through probate.
- Only it won't go through probate.

871
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:01,007
- Why not?
- Aunt Vi won't let it.

872
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:05,128
Well, you see, it has to do with you.
With your being ill.

873
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:10,400
- She doesn't trust me with the money?
- 50 grand is chickenfeed to Aunt Vi.

874
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:13,965
- Then what is it?
- When you went off your rocker...

875
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:18,048
Shut up, Mama. Cathy's not
that far gone. Are you, Cathy?

876
00:57:18,249 --> 00:57:21,559
- When I went off my rocker...?
- Yeah. You said something.

877
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:24,237
You made up some crazy story
about Sebastian.

878
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,804
- When she heard whatever it was...
- Last night...

879
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:30,479
...not a word would she say,
except that you babbled.

880
00:57:30,689 --> 00:57:34,602
That's her word for it. You babbled
some story about Sebastian...

881
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:37,846
...and how he lived and...
- Died...

882
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:41,157
...in a place called Cabeza de Lobo.

883
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,282
What you said gave her a real turn.

884
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:49,119
When doctors decided you were crazy,
she wanted you to stay at St. Mary's.

885
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:53,004
Or even right here.
This seems such a nice place too.

886
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:56,201
- With that nice, capable doctor.
- Go on.

887
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:58,877
Written permission was needed
to keep you here.

888
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:03,198
So that was the point
of the private supper.

889
00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:05,007
You've gotta understand...

890
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:07,808
This 100 grand is important to us.

891
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:10,887
It means George will have all sorts
of advantages now.

892
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:15,082
Things we couldn't give him, since 1929
killed your father and our nest egg.

893
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:18,087
Mother, you didn't sign those papers?

894
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:21,486
- You didn't commit me to Lions View?
- Not yet.

895
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:25,284
But, Cathy, the way Aunt Vi put it,
there was no choice at all.

896
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:26,763
Mama's gotta sign.

897
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:30,723
Besides, honey, it's not like
it was for always.

898
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:33,727
In no time,
after the little operation...

899
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:37,001
...you'll be able to...

900
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:40,362
What little operation?

901
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:42,161
Oh, Cathy!

902
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:48,518
There's only one little operation
they perform here.

903
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:51,766
It's on the brain.
It's called a lobotomy.

904
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:54,961
You may have heard of it
or read about it. I have.

905
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:58,127
It's that nice young doctor's
specialty.

906
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:01,487
In cases of hopeless lunacy...

907
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:05,477
...he bores holes into the skull
and operates on the brain!

908
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:09,563
Oh, honey, please don't
talk about it. Please!

909
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:13,728
- You can't let them!
- Stop. It's not the end of the world!

910
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:16,602
- Don't sign that paper!
- They say it don't hurt.

911
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:19,403
- Don't let them!
- No worse than tonsils.

912
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:23,158
And then, afterwards,
you're all right again.

913
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:24,362
Miss Catherine.

914
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:27,398
- Those faces!
- Look, for the love of...

915
01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:31,363
- You get her back to her room.
- What are you doing here?

916
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:37,325
We've just come from your office.

917
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:40,919
- What is all that noise? Is it fire?
- What happened?

918
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:45,247
I don't know. We were having this chat
about your treatment.

919
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:48,964
All of a sudden my poor baby flew
out of the room and down the hall.

920
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:53,321
I'm sure it's the right thing,
what you and Violet are doing.

921
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:55,645
- It is the right thing.
- Come on, Mama.

922
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,158
- We're so grateful to you.
- Come on.

923
01:01:58,369 --> 01:01:59,961
Having you look after her and...

924
01:02:00,169 --> 01:02:02,444
Will you get me Dr. Van Vitch?

925
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:03,764
- Yes.
- Thank you.

926
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:11,249
I'm sorry they upset you.

927
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:14,521
Miss Catherine, don't ever run away.

928
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:17,482
Where will you cut, doctor?

929
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:22,365
- I'm not at all sure that I will.
- Where will you cut my brain, doctor?

930
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:24,002
In front?

931
01:02:24,249 --> 01:02:28,561
Or further back?
I suppose I'm to have my head shaved.

932
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:33,248
It seems such a waste, seeing as how
I had my hair fixed this morning...

933
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:36,486
...then to have it all cut off
right after it.

934
01:02:36,689 --> 01:02:38,964
I tell you, it's funny.

935
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:44,528
And you were the one who was
going to help me. Help me.

936
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:45,918
Help me!

937
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,608
Don't talk like that.

938
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:50,562
Why not?
Now I sound insane, don't I?

939
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:53,158
- Are you trying to?
- No, and I'm not.

940
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,566
You've got to believe me, doctor.
I am not.

941
01:02:56,769 --> 01:03:00,239
Insane is such a meaningless word.

942
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:03,168
But lobotomy has a precise meaning,
hasn't it?

943
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:08,159
Are you going to operate? Tell me,
doctor, please, are you going to?

944
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:10,837
I don't know yet.

945
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:15,361
Poor doctor.

946
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:18,758
I bother you, don't I?

947
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,766
Yes, you do.

948
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:23,767
Well, I'll try not to anymore.

949
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,927
- Three cc, please.
- Yes, doctor.

950
01:03:30,129 --> 01:03:32,359
Must I take off my pretty dress?

951
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:34,161
Of course not.

952
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:40,399
I want to help you.

953
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:41,877
Trust me.

954
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:45,568
I want to trust you.

955
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:50,121
It seems to me that
I need help very much.

956
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:01,046
- His eyes are so blue.
- Who?

957
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:02,967
The doctor.

958
01:04:03,609 --> 01:04:05,804
Wonder why he isn't blond.

959
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:08,529
They usually are blond,
with eyes that blue.

960
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:10,685
- I'm blond.
- Are you?

961
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:14,677
Funny. We were going to blonds next.

962
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:17,244
Blonds were next on the menu.

963
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:21,761
You just relax now.
Let yourself go.

964
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:27,206
All last summer,
Sebastian was famished for blonds.

965
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,480
Fed up with the dark ones.

966
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:34,360
Famished for blonds.
The travel brochures he picked up...

967
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:38,608
...were advertisements of blond
northern countries.

968
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:42,961
Think he'd already booked us
to Stockholm and Copenhagen.

969
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:47,965
Fed up with the dark ones,
famished for the light ones.

970
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:52,362
That's the way he talked about people,
as if they were...

971
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:55,037
...items on a menu.

972
01:04:55,249 --> 01:04:58,161
That one's delicious-looking.

973
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:00,883
That one's appetizing.

974
01:05:01,089 --> 01:05:04,764
Or that one is not appetizing.

975
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:09,285
I think really he was half-starved...

976
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:12,640
...from living on pills and salads.

977
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:16,557
You just relax, now.

978
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:23,360
We'll fly north, little bird.

979
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:26,368
It's what he called me sometimes.

980
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:28,565
Little bird.

981
01:05:29,569 --> 01:05:35,166
We'll walk under those radiant,
cold northern lights.

982
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:39,962
I've never seen the aurora borealis.

983
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:43,362
Well...

984
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:48,159
He never saw those northern lights.

985
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:54,126
Who said, "We're all of us children...

986
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:57,162
...in a vast kindergarten...

987
01:05:57,409 --> 01:06:03,564
...trying to spell God's name
with the wrong alphabet blocks"?

988
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:25,957
Thank you.

989
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:30,844
Mrs. Venable, I do
want to speak with you...

990
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:34,598
Oh, this forgetfulness,
my greatest failing, doctor.

991
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:37,482
I have a little gift for you,
this book.

992
01:06:37,649 --> 01:06:39,162
Thank you.

993
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:42,528
- <i>Poe</i><i>m of Summ</i><i>er.</i>
- By my son, Sebastian Venable.

994
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:46,039
That volume contains only one poem,
as do the others I have.

995
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:49,559
Each with the title <i>Poe</i><i>m of Summe</i><i>r</i>
and the date of the summer.

996
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:52,329
If you like that one,
I'll bring the others.

997
01:06:52,529 --> 01:06:54,167
He wrote one poem a year?

998
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:57,725
One for each summer
that we travelled together.

999
01:06:57,929 --> 01:07:01,638
The other nine months of the year
were really only a preparation.

1000
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:03,282
Nine months?

1001
01:07:03,489 --> 01:07:05,320
The length of a pregnancy, yes.

1002
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:08,808
I gather the poem was hard to deliver.

1003
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:12,046
Even with me. Without me, impossible.

1004
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:16,925
- Doctor, he wrote no poem last summer.
- But he died last summer.

1005
01:07:17,129 --> 01:07:18,767
Without me, he died.

1006
01:07:19,009 --> 01:07:20,761
That was his last summer's poem.

1007
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:26,321
Mrs. Venable, how exactly
did your son die?

1008
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:30,081
I told you, a heart attack.

1009
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:32,723
Is that what the letter said?

1010
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:35,921
How did Catherine know
I received a letter?

1011
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:39,288
Catherine? She knows very little.

1012
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,081
She can't remember.

1013
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:45,407
That's her illness. She was there,
but she can't remember.

1014
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:48,806
- Mrs. Holly told me about it.
- So you've seen her too, have you?

1015
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:51,244
I must say, you have been observing.

1016
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:53,917
There was no letter,
only a death certificate.

1017
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:55,847
- I'd like to see that if...
- Why?

1018
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:00,607
I think it's important. I want to know
what happened the day your son died.

1019
01:08:01,129 --> 01:08:03,802
You shall have it tomorrow.

1020
01:08:04,009 --> 01:08:07,524
And tomorrow you shall also have
the permission to operate.

1021
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:09,321
And now I'd better go.

1022
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:11,884
I've got lawyers waiting for me.

1023
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:16,765
You'd think giving you a building was
simple. Apparently, I must sign papers.

1024
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:20,006
But I'm used to it.
Sebastian never signed anything.

1025
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:22,928
- He must have suspected...
- Mrs. Venable.

1026
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:24,724
Your son...

1027
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:26,843
What about my son?

1028
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:30,761
What sort of personal life
did he have?

1029
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:33,282
He was chaste.

1030
01:08:33,969 --> 01:08:37,962
- You mean he was celibate?
- Yes.

1031
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:41,085
You don't believe me, do you?

1032
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:43,757
- Do you believe that he never...?
- Yes, never.

1033
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:49,521
As strictly as if he'd taken a vow.
This sounds like vanity, doctor...

1034
01:08:49,729 --> 01:08:52,607
...but I was actually
the only one in his life...

1035
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:55,881
...that satisfied the demands
he made of people.

1036
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:58,808
Time after time, he'd let people go,
dismiss them...

1037
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:01,802
...because their attitude
toward him was not as...

1038
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:05,445
- As pure?
- As pure as my son demanded.

1039
01:09:05,769 --> 01:09:08,567
Would you want to see Catherine?

1040
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,564
Is that wise?

1041
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:12,248
It might help me.

1042
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:14,719
But the lawyer.

1043
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:18,080
Surely you've kept the lawyer
waiting before.

1044
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:20,359
Yes, I have.

1045
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:22,207
Such a strong...

1046
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:25,725
...such a persuasive doctor.

1047
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:44,878
She's been under sedation.
She's just coming out of it.

1048
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:48,442
She looks lovely, doesn't she?

1049
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:50,162
Doesn't she?

1050
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:00,481
- Miss Catherine?
- Where are we going?

1051
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:02,486
His eyes...

1052
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:05,567
This one's eyes are so blue...

1053
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:08,329
...such strange, frightened...

1054
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,248
I'm sorry. I must have been dreaming.

1055
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:19,566
Hello, Catherine.

1056
01:10:23,169 --> 01:10:27,082
I thought... we would have
seen each other before this.

1057
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:30,202
At St. Mary's, they wouldn't
let any of us see you.

1058
01:10:31,049 --> 01:10:33,324
Mama was here today.

1059
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:37,602
That was today, wasn't it? I lose
track of time with all these shots.

1060
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:39,447
You look very well, Catherine.

1061
01:10:40,009 --> 01:10:45,208
Mama told me how you got her
to agree to commit me here...

1062
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:48,281
...and then let them...
- She seems disturbed, doctor.

1063
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:52,682
Aunt Violet! I am disturbed.

1064
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:56,645
Don't you think I have
every reason to be?

1065
01:10:56,849 --> 01:10:59,488
Forcing my mother
into signing a paper...

1066
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,487
I've never forced anybody
to do anything.

1067
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:04,042
Oh, yes, you have.

1068
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:05,967
Always.

1069
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:08,724
And now you're holding $100,000...

1070
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:12,279
...under Mother and George's
poor greedy noses...

1071
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:16,164
...to force her to sign a paper
authorizing this doctor to...

1072
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:19,958
Doctor. I see no purpose in my
remaining here listening to this.

1073
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:22,763
I'll wait for you in that sun room.

1074
01:11:54,089 --> 01:11:56,728
Doctor, I wanted to speak
to you alone.

1075
01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:00,001
Miss Catherine wanted to see you again
before you left.

1076
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,800
I didn't want to take your place
last summer.

1077
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:06,318
Please believe that, Aunt Vi.

1078
01:12:06,529 --> 01:12:08,724
But Sebastian insisted. He said...

1079
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:12,922
...you weren't well enough to travel
with him, and he couldn't travel alone.

1080
01:12:13,089 --> 01:12:17,128
So he insisted that I go along
with him in your place last summer.

1081
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:19,605
And he died last summer.

1082
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:26,239
Aunt Violet, would you like me
to tell you...?

1083
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:47,882
You fell in love with Sebastian,
didn't you?

1084
01:12:48,089 --> 01:12:51,286
I tried to give him
what you had always given him:

1085
01:12:51,489 --> 01:12:54,083
The tender understanding
and the love you gave...

1086
01:12:54,289 --> 01:12:58,999
My son and I had a rare and wonderful
love and trust between us.

1087
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,927
A covenant between us...

1088
01:13:01,129 --> 01:13:04,007
- I know about the covenant.
- He broke that covenant...

1089
01:13:04,209 --> 01:13:07,679
...when he took her, not me,
to travel while he created his poem.

1090
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:11,279
Even when I was with him,
he'd sometimes be frightened.

1091
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:13,002
But I'd know what of.

1092
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:16,599
I'd reach across a table
and touch his hands.

1093
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,882
Say not a word, just look,
and touch his hands with mine.

1094
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:25,679
Then, in the morning, the summer poem
would be continued...

1095
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:27,322
...until it was finished.

1096
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:30,202
- I couldn't help him.
- Naturally not, he was mine.

1097
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:32,280
I knew how to help him.
You couldn't.

1098
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:33,717
- I tried.
- I'd force him.

1099
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:35,487
All right, I failed him.

1100
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:39,398
I knew that the day we flew down
to Cabeza de Lobo from...

1101
01:13:39,609 --> 01:13:41,679
...where he'd given off
writing his poem.

1102
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:45,199
- Because he had broken...
- Yes, something had broken.

1103
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:48,606
- That string of pearls old mothers...
- Old?

1104
01:13:48,809 --> 01:13:50,765
- Hold their sons by!
- Yes, from death.

1105
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,721
No! Hold them from life!

1106
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,397
You were the stranger, the destroyer.

1107
01:13:55,609 --> 01:13:58,043
- We were life.
- You fed on life.

1108
01:13:58,249 --> 01:13:59,967
Both of you. Taking!

1109
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:05,562
People were objects for your pleasure.
That's what you taught each other.

1110
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:10,047
- You were superior to mere mortals.
- We needed no one but one another.

1111
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:15,200
Sebastian only needed you
while you were still useful.

1112
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:19,163
- Useful?
- I mean young, able to attract.

1113
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:21,087
She's babbling and lying.

1114
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:23,928
- He left her home because she...
- You stole him!

1115
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:25,960
Lost her attraction!

1116
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:29,081
What would attraction have to do
with a son and mother?

1117
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:33,761
- Is there no way to stop these lies?
- Yes! Have my brain cut.

1118
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,288
This was a mistake.

1119
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:38,481
The mistake was my going
with Sebastian.

1120
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:41,999
- When he left her, she had a stroke.
- Not a stroke!

1121
01:14:42,209 --> 01:14:43,881
A hysterical stroke.

1122
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:47,087
Sebastian left her home
like a toy he tired of.

1123
01:14:47,289 --> 01:14:51,646
And he took me with him
like a new toy. On his last voyage.

1124
01:14:51,809 --> 01:14:54,767
- Lies. All lies.
- You see, doctor, we both...

1125
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:58,080
- We were decoys.
- Decoys?

1126
01:14:58,289 --> 01:15:01,281
For Sebastian. He used us as bait!

1127
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:06,320
When she was no longer able to lure
the better fish in, he let her go.

1128
01:15:06,529 --> 01:15:09,043
Bait? For what?
What were the better fish?

1129
01:15:09,249 --> 01:15:11,001
We procured for him.

1130
01:15:11,489 --> 01:15:15,880
She'd do it in the smart, fashionable
places they went before last summer.

1131
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:20,287
Sebastian was shy with people.
She wasn't. Neither was I.

1132
01:15:20,489 --> 01:15:23,447
But we both did
the same thing for him.

1133
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:25,719
We both made contacts for him.

1134
01:15:25,929 --> 01:15:30,400
I can't listen to this obscenity.
Stop her, doctor.

1135
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:34,118
Cut the truth out of my brain,
is that what you want?

1136
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:37,401
You can't. Not even God
can change the truth.

1137
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:39,839
- That we were nothing but a...
- Doctor!

1138
01:15:40,009 --> 01:15:42,682
- It's the truth!
- See how she destroys us?

1139
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:45,638
Cut this hideous story
out of her brain!

1140
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:49,683
How much are you willing
to pay for that, Aunt Vi?

1141
01:15:49,889 --> 01:15:52,528
Get me away from her. Out of here.

1142
01:15:52,729 --> 01:15:54,447
Out of this...

1143
01:15:57,769 --> 01:16:01,159
- Nurse, some spirits of ammonia.
- Yes, doctor.

1144
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:03,325
- What happened?
- She fainted.

1145
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:06,123
No. No, she didn't.

1146
01:16:06,689 --> 01:16:08,566
Just a little...

1147
01:16:08,769 --> 01:16:10,999
...dizziness, that's all.

1148
01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:14,838
Dr. Hockstader, will you
help me to my car?

1149
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:20,248
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Whether it is or not, I'm going home.

1150
01:16:38,369 --> 01:16:41,122
Tomorrow, I want that girl
operated on.

1151
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:46,278
That decision belongs to the doctor
in charge, who is also the surgeon.

1152
01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:50,482
I don't want to hear from you again
until the operation has been performed.

1153
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:04,759
No! No!

1154
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:08,604
Please, no!

1155
01:19:14,009 --> 01:19:17,240
- You trying to ruin this hospital?
- You know better than that.

1156
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:20,486
Can you imagine what would happen
to us if she'd jumped?

1157
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:21,963
She was frightened. She...

1158
01:19:22,169 --> 01:19:24,763
Patients are here
because they can't think.

1159
01:19:25,649 --> 01:19:27,526
After 24 hours observation...

1160
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,007
During which she tried to kill herself,
incited the men's day room to a riot...

1161
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:34,888
- She opened that door by mistake.
- Trying to get away.

1162
01:19:35,049 --> 01:19:39,440
There was a riot, and she caused it.
Don't invent excuses for her.

1163
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,719
And from that Paris clinic:

1164
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:44,439
Delusions the world
was devouring her...

1165
01:19:44,609 --> 01:19:47,840
...that she was being raped by a man
with duelling pistols.

1166
01:19:48,009 --> 01:19:50,569
- The Duelling Oaks.
- Here's more of her erotomania.

1167
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:53,044
At St. Mary's, they couldn't
keep her. Why?

1168
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:55,479
Because of her obscenity and violence.

1169
01:19:55,689 --> 01:19:58,078
She sexually attacked
a 60-year-old gardener.

1170
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:00,166
It was the other way around.

1171
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:03,526
She tried to burn one of the Sisters
with a cigarette.

1172
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:06,289
She was provoked.
I was there, I saw it.

1173
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:09,481
Provoked? Who would provoke
a disturbed patient?

1174
01:20:09,689 --> 01:20:11,042
You'd be surprised.

1175
01:20:11,249 --> 01:20:13,763
And to top it, she attempts suicide.

1176
01:20:13,929 --> 01:20:17,126
Cogent proof of sanity,
wouldn't you say?

1177
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,287
I need time.

1178
01:20:20,169 --> 01:20:23,081
When will you want
the operating room tomorrow?

1179
01:20:23,249 --> 01:20:26,127
I said I need more time.

1180
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:28,201
I heard you.

1181
01:20:32,649 --> 01:20:36,119
Get me Dr. Glen Kilmer
at the Seattle Clinic.

1182
01:20:36,689 --> 01:20:40,238
You know I want that building
as much as you do.

1183
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:42,087
I'll hold on.

1184
01:20:42,969 --> 01:20:47,645
Give me one more day to see if I can
break through that block to the truth.

1185
01:20:47,849 --> 01:20:49,601
This is a medical emergency.

1186
01:20:49,769 --> 01:20:51,043
I want to try something.

1187
01:20:51,249 --> 01:20:54,241
I want to try something tomorrow,
at Mrs. Venable's.

1188
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:56,725
- Why Mrs. Venable's?
- I don't know.

1189
01:20:56,889 --> 01:21:00,199
I feel somehow that in that garden...

1190
01:21:00,409 --> 01:21:04,322
...maybe in that jungle,
we might find...

1191
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:07,526
Look, you don't want Mrs. Venable
giving her money...

1192
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,924
...to the Seattle Clinic, do you?

1193
01:21:10,089 --> 01:21:14,241
And you don't want anybody to be able
to say that we acted hastily...

1194
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:16,644
...or unethically, do you?

1195
01:21:18,929 --> 01:21:19,998
Cancel the call.

1196
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:24,325
But be sure you know where
I can find Dr. Kilmer.

1197
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,405
Mrs. Venable will be right down.

1198
01:21:58,729 --> 01:22:02,563
- The others are here, as you asked.
- Show them into the sun room, please.

1199
01:22:02,969 --> 01:22:04,527
Of course, doctor.

1200
01:22:06,249 --> 01:22:07,364
Cathy, honey...

1201
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:09,082
Later, Mrs. Holly.

1202
01:22:09,289 --> 01:22:11,598
Doctor, I have the things you wanted.

1203
01:22:11,809 --> 01:22:14,277
- In the dining room.
- Oh, thank you.

1204
01:22:20,729 --> 01:22:22,401
What's going on here?

1205
01:22:23,009 --> 01:22:25,125
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Dr. Cukrowicz.

1206
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:28,361
I had to get those papers you wanted.
I mislay everything.

1207
01:22:28,809 --> 01:22:31,369
My son always said,
"Mother, if you..."

1208
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:35,840
What are you two doing here?
And where is Dr. Cukrowicz?

1209
01:22:36,049 --> 01:22:37,926
Why, I thought you invited us.

1210
01:22:38,129 --> 01:22:40,689
Dr. Cukrowicz asked me
to ask them to come.

1211
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:42,843
Of course.

1212
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:44,528
Dr. Hockstader...

1213
01:22:45,049 --> 01:22:47,563
...I want you to meet
my sister-in-law, Mrs. Ho...

1214
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:50,442
- Where is Catherine?
- In the sun room.

1215
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,921
Could Mrs. Holly and her son
wait for us in the garden?

1216
01:22:54,129 --> 01:22:55,926
Of course. Foxhill?

1217
01:22:56,329 --> 01:22:59,162
I don't know why everybody
is being so mysterious.

1218
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:02,327
I brought you some of Sebastian's
papers. Odds and ends.

1219
01:23:02,489 --> 01:23:05,765
- And this, the thing you wanted.
- Your son's death certificate?

1220
01:23:05,929 --> 01:23:09,444
- This must be painful for you.
- Lf you don't read Spanish, I have...

1221
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:11,162
I read Spanish.

1222
01:23:12,249 --> 01:23:13,921
Well, I have a translation.

1223
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,841
As you see,
there was no mystery...

1224
01:23:16,009 --> 01:23:19,206
...no matter what the girl said
at the time or any other time.

1225
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,599
It says the body was somewhat...

1226
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:23,999
...damaged in falling.
Where did he fall?

1227
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:27,724
On the ground. Where else do you fall
when you die in the hot sun...

1228
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:29,880
...in the street
of a godforsaken village?

1229
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:31,444
Did you see his body...?

1230
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:34,407
It was a primitive country.
The coffin came sealed.

1231
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:35,558
Sealed?

1232
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:37,117
Were there any rumours?

1233
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:40,361
There were no rumours.
His heart stopped and he fell.

1234
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:43,601
I'll wait in the garden now.
That is where you want me?

1235
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,327
Yes, if you will.

1236
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:47,683
Dr. Hockstader...

1237
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,762
...let me show you my son's garden.

1238
01:23:50,969 --> 01:23:55,121
It's very unusual.
Like the dawn of creation.

1239
01:23:57,769 --> 01:23:59,680
Sebastian's garden.

1240
01:24:01,689 --> 01:24:03,759
I can still cry.

1241
01:24:05,009 --> 01:24:06,840
Am I dreaming this?

1242
01:24:07,049 --> 01:24:09,085
It doesn't seem real.

1243
01:24:11,409 --> 01:24:15,641
Would you take off your jacket?
It's time for another injection.

1244
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:18,607
What is it this time?

1245
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:22,122
- Something different.
- The truth serum?

1246
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:25,241
Yes, except there is no such thing.

1247
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:26,757
As truth?

1248
01:24:26,969 --> 01:24:28,163
Or the truth serum?

1249
01:24:28,489 --> 01:24:31,606
There is truth, all right. Somewhere.

1250
01:24:32,009 --> 01:24:33,283
Sit down.

1251
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,248
Now you want me to start
counting backwards from 100?

1252
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:44,881
- Do you enjoy counting backwards?
- Oh, I love it. Just love it.

1253
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,202
100...

1254
01:24:49,409 --> 01:24:52,765
...99, 98, 97...

1255
01:24:52,929 --> 01:24:55,762
...96, 95...

1256
01:24:58,729 --> 01:25:00,685
I feel it already.

1257
01:25:00,849 --> 01:25:03,841
- How funny.
- Close your eyes for a minute.

1258
01:25:16,329 --> 01:25:18,524
I want you to give me something.

1259
01:25:18,729 --> 01:25:20,765
Name it, it's yours.

1260
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,479
I want you to give me
all your resistance.

1261
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:25,806
Resistance? To what?

1262
01:25:26,049 --> 01:25:27,038
To the truth.

1263
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:31,366
Truth is the one thing
I have never resisted.

1264
01:25:31,649 --> 01:25:34,447
People think they don't resist it,
but they still do.

1265
01:25:34,809 --> 01:25:36,606
Sebastian said:

1266
01:25:37,249 --> 01:25:40,924
"Truth is at the bottom
of a bottomless well."

1267
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:43,603
Why did...?

1268
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:48,081
Open your eyes.

1269
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:52,040
Why did you try to kill yourself?

1270
01:25:54,089 --> 01:25:56,159
Isn't that what everybody wants?

1271
01:25:56,329 --> 01:25:58,047
Me out of the way?

1272
01:25:58,769 --> 01:26:00,999
Mother and George
would get their money.

1273
01:26:01,209 --> 01:26:03,165
You'd get your building.

1274
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:04,597
Aunt Vi...

1275
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:06,438
Go on.

1276
01:26:07,889 --> 01:26:10,244
You know what I think
you're trying to do?

1277
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:13,804
I think you're trying
to hypnotize me.

1278
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:16,202
You're looking at me so...

1279
01:26:16,409 --> 01:26:17,683
...straight.

1280
01:26:18,369 --> 01:26:23,523
You're doing something strange
to me with your eyes. Your eyes...

1281
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:27,080
- Is that what you're doing?
- Is that what you feel I'm doing?

1282
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,243
I feel... peculiar.

1283
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,487
It doesn't just have to do
with what you gave me.

1284
01:26:39,169 --> 01:26:40,966
I'm putting out my hands.

1285
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:45,486
I want you to put your hands into mine
and give me all your resistance.

1286
01:26:45,649 --> 01:26:49,278
Pass all the resistance
from your hands into mine.

1287
01:26:50,649 --> 01:26:52,560
Here are my hands...

1288
01:26:53,089 --> 01:26:55,045
...but there's no resistance in them.

1289
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,688
You'll tell the true story?

1290
01:26:57,449 --> 01:26:59,246
Yes, I'll try.

1291
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:02,408
Nothing not spoken.
Everything told exactly?

1292
01:27:02,809 --> 01:27:04,800
Everything exactly.

1293
01:27:06,089 --> 01:27:08,159
Because I have to.

1294
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:14,518
Can I...?

1295
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:16,003
Can I get up?

1296
01:27:16,169 --> 01:27:19,639
Yes, of course, but be careful.
You'll feel a little dizzy.

1297
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:22,528
I can't.

1298
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:27,042
Tell me to.

1299
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:29,167
Then I think I could.

1300
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:30,961
Stand up.

1301
01:27:38,009 --> 01:27:39,442
Now I can.

1302
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:44,361
- Oh, I'm dizzy. Help me.
- It's all right. You're all right.

1303
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,001
Hold me.

1304
01:27:49,169 --> 01:27:51,239
I've been so lonely.

1305
01:27:55,529 --> 01:27:56,803
Let me.

1306
01:27:57,009 --> 01:27:58,124
Let me.

1307
01:28:05,929 --> 01:28:09,126
I suggest you bring her outside,
if you don't mind, doctor.

1308
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:10,961
We'll be right out.

1309
01:28:17,929 --> 01:28:19,487
Are you ready?

1310
01:28:33,929 --> 01:28:35,647
Hello, Catherine.

1311
01:28:36,609 --> 01:28:38,042
Now, Catherine...

1312
01:28:38,249 --> 01:28:40,717
...you're going to tell
the true story.

1313
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:44,558
- Where do I start?
- Wherever you think it started.

1314
01:28:45,129 --> 01:28:46,847
I think it started...

1315
01:28:47,009 --> 01:28:49,204
...the day Sebastian was born
in this house.

1316
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:50,597
- Cathy.
- I don't mind.

1317
01:28:50,809 --> 01:28:55,280
Let's start later than that.
Why don't we begin with last summer?

1318
01:28:55,489 --> 01:28:56,604
Last summer?

1319
01:28:56,809 --> 01:28:58,925
Last summer. How did it begin?

1320
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:00,722
It began...

1321
01:29:01,209 --> 01:29:02,562
...after the Duelling Oaks.

1322
01:29:02,769 --> 01:29:06,808
- Don't tell about that, Cathy...
- Mrs. Holly, don't interrupt.

1323
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:09,600
After that happened...

1324
01:29:09,889 --> 01:29:12,961
...the next morning,
I started writing my diary...

1325
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:15,245
...in the third person singular,
such as:

1326
01:29:15,449 --> 01:29:18,566
"She is still living this morning."

1327
01:29:19,009 --> 01:29:21,079
Meaning that I was.

1328
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:24,565
"What's next for her? God knows."

1329
01:29:25,049 --> 01:29:27,847
I couldn't go out anywhere.

1330
01:29:28,049 --> 01:29:30,244
That's true.
She wouldn't leave her room.

1331
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:31,802
Shut up, Mama.

1332
01:29:32,009 --> 01:29:35,524
I would write,
"She woke up early this morning.

1333
01:29:36,129 --> 01:29:38,882
She had her coffee, dressed...

1334
01:29:39,049 --> 01:29:40,482
...went for a brief walk."

1335
01:29:40,849 --> 01:29:42,919
- Who did?
- She did.

1336
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:45,763
I did.

1337
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:49,318
From Esplanade
to Canal Street...

1338
01:29:49,529 --> 01:29:52,680
...as though being pursued
by a pack of Siberian wolves.

1339
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:57,362
Went through all the stop signs.
Couldn't wait for the green signals.

1340
01:29:57,929 --> 01:30:02,320
"Where did she think she was going,
back to the Duelling Oaks?"

1341
01:30:04,929 --> 01:30:06,248
Everything...

1342
01:30:06,649 --> 01:30:08,605
...chilly and dim.

1343
01:30:09,769 --> 01:30:11,202
But that hot...

1344
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:12,643
...ravenous mouth.

1345
01:30:13,289 --> 01:30:15,359
He was a very ordinary married man.

1346
01:30:15,769 --> 01:30:16,758
And then?

1347
01:30:18,409 --> 01:30:22,038
One morning, Cousin Sebastian
came in and said, "Get up."

1348
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:27,004
Well, if you're still alive after
dying, then you're obedient. I got up.

1349
01:30:27,329 --> 01:30:30,401
He took me down to a place
where they take passport photos.

1350
01:30:31,249 --> 01:30:33,763
He said, " Mother can't go
with me this summer.

1351
01:30:34,049 --> 01:30:36,847
You're going with me this summer,
instead of Mother."

1352
01:30:37,049 --> 01:30:40,837
- Except that it was her idea, not his.
- Mrs. Venable.

1353
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:42,843
And your cousin?

1354
01:30:43,529 --> 01:30:45,918
He helped bring me back to life...

1355
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:48,802
...in Paris, Barcelona, Rome.

1356
01:30:48,969 --> 01:30:52,678
All those lovely foreign cities
I'd never seen, we saw together.

1357
01:30:52,849 --> 01:30:55,647
And those...
What did he call them?

1358
01:30:55,849 --> 01:30:57,760
Those sunshine days...

1359
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:01,444
...where it's always noon,
and we cast no shadows.

1360
01:31:01,649 --> 01:31:03,879
- But then...
- But then what?

1361
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:06,041
At Amalfi...

1362
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:10,762
...high above the Mediterranean,
in a garden, I took his arm.

1363
01:31:11,529 --> 01:31:13,167
You took his arm. Yes...?

1364
01:31:13,329 --> 01:31:16,605
It seemed like such a natural thing
to do, but he pulled away.

1365
01:31:16,809 --> 01:31:20,040
How he must have loathed
being touched by her.

1366
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:24,522
I only did it to try and show
my appreciation for his kindness.

1367
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,242
I didn't want to...

1368
01:31:26,889 --> 01:31:28,845
There was nothing else.

1369
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:31,922
Anyway...

1370
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:34,764
...it was there in Amalfi...

1371
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:38,803
...suddenly, last summer,
that he began to be restless and...

1372
01:31:39,689 --> 01:31:41,281
Go on.

1373
01:31:43,089 --> 01:31:44,647
He couldn't go on.

1374
01:31:44,849 --> 01:31:47,124
He couldn't write his summer poem.

1375
01:31:47,409 --> 01:31:50,321
I have his notebook here. See?

1376
01:31:50,529 --> 01:31:54,442
Title, <i>Poe</i><i>m of Summe</i><i>r</i>.
And the date of the summer: 1937.

1377
01:31:54,649 --> 01:31:58,562
And after that, blank pages,
blank pages. Nothing but nothing.

1378
01:31:58,729 --> 01:32:00,879
A poet's vocation rests
on something...

1379
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:03,119
...as fine and thin as a spider's web.

1380
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:05,724
It's all that holds him
out of destruction.

1381
01:32:05,929 --> 01:32:07,840
Very few are able to do it alone.

1382
01:32:08,009 --> 01:32:10,477
Great help is needed.
I did give it. She didn't.

1383
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,844
She's right about that.
I failed him.

1384
01:32:13,009 --> 01:32:15,239
I wasn't able to keep
the web from breaking.

1385
01:32:15,409 --> 01:32:17,445
I saw it breaking,
I couldn't save it.

1386
01:32:17,649 --> 01:32:21,437
Now the truth's coming out. Maybe
she'll admit what really happened.

1387
01:32:21,689 --> 01:32:24,806
- What did happen?
- How she killed him.

1388
01:32:24,969 --> 01:32:27,642
How she murdered him
at Cabeza de Lobo. Ask her.

1389
01:32:32,849 --> 01:32:34,680
What did really happen?

1390
01:32:35,169 --> 01:32:37,444
Suddenly, last summer...

1391
01:32:37,649 --> 01:32:39,605
...he wasn't young anymore.

1392
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:41,527
We went to Cabeza de Lobo...

1393
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:44,727
...suddenly, he switched
from the evenings to the beach.

1394
01:32:45,009 --> 01:32:46,328
Evenings to the beach?

1395
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:50,927
I mean, from the evenings
to the afternoons.

1396
01:32:51,129 --> 01:32:55,122
Suddenly, Cousin Sebastian changed
to the afternoons in the beach.

1397
01:32:55,489 --> 01:32:58,208
What kind of a beach was it?
Was it a public beach?

1398
01:32:58,409 --> 01:32:59,922
Yes, public.

1399
01:33:00,129 --> 01:33:02,643
Little statements like that
give her away.

1400
01:33:03,449 --> 01:33:07,203
After all I've told you about his
fastidiousness, can you accept...

1401
01:33:07,369 --> 01:33:10,998
...that Sebastian would go to some
dirty public beach near a harbour?

1402
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:14,246
Whatever she wants to say,
I want her to say it.

1403
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:15,918
Go on.

1404
01:33:16,489 --> 01:33:18,923
I don't want to go on.

1405
01:33:19,129 --> 01:33:23,600
Every afternoon, you and your cousin
would go to this free public beach?

1406
01:33:24,209 --> 01:33:28,282
It wasn't the free one.
The free one was right next to it.

1407
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:30,764
There was a fence
between the free beach...

1408
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:33,927
...and the beach that we went to
that charged admission.

1409
01:33:34,089 --> 01:33:36,444
Did anything happen there
that disturbed you?

1410
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:39,486
- Yes.
- What?

1411
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:42,965
He bought me a bathing suit
I didn't want to wear.

1412
01:33:43,169 --> 01:33:45,080
I laughed.
I said, " I can't wear that.

1413
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:48,361
Why, it's a scandal
to the jaybirds."

1414
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:50,764
What do you mean?
Was this suit immodest?

1415
01:33:50,969 --> 01:33:55,042
It was a one-piece bathing suit.
Made of white something.

1416
01:33:55,249 --> 01:33:57,365
But the water made it transparent.

1417
01:33:57,569 --> 01:34:00,242
I told him I didn't want
to swim in it...

1418
01:34:00,449 --> 01:34:03,839
...but he just grabbed my hand
and dragged me into the water...

1419
01:34:04,009 --> 01:34:05,727
...all the way in...

1420
01:34:05,929 --> 01:34:08,727
...and I came out looking naked.

1421
01:34:08,929 --> 01:34:12,365
Why did he do that?
Do you know why he did that?

1422
01:34:12,569 --> 01:34:14,048
Yes.

1423
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:18,128
- To attract attention.
- Because he thought you were lonely?

1424
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:21,686
Did he think he could shock you
out of your depression?

1425
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:25,924
You know why I was doing it.
I told you.

1426
01:34:26,089 --> 01:34:28,557
I was procuring for him.

1427
01:34:29,889 --> 01:34:32,926
Sebastian was lonely, doctor.

1428
01:34:33,129 --> 01:34:37,361
That empty blue jay notebook
got bigger and bigger.

1429
01:34:37,569 --> 01:34:39,878
So big, it was big and empty...

1430
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:43,837
...like that big, empty,
blue sea and sky.

1431
01:34:46,089 --> 01:34:50,287
And before long, when the weather
was warmer and the beach so crowded...

1432
01:34:50,489 --> 01:34:53,083
...he didn't need me anymore
for that purpose.

1433
01:34:53,809 --> 01:34:58,246
The ones from the free beach climbed
over the fence or swam around it.

1434
01:34:59,049 --> 01:35:03,042
So now he let me wear
a decent dark suit.

1435
01:35:03,209 --> 01:35:06,326
I'd go to a faraway end
of the beach and write post cards...

1436
01:35:06,489 --> 01:35:09,879
...and letters and keep up
my third person journal...

1437
01:35:10,089 --> 01:35:14,048
...until it was time to meet him
outside the bathhouses on the street.

1438
01:35:14,729 --> 01:35:17,721
He would come out... followed.

1439
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:19,887
Who'd follow him?

1440
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:24,685
The hungry young people that climbed
over the fence from the free beach.

1441
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:28,448
He'd pass out tips among them,
as if they'd all...

1442
01:35:28,649 --> 01:35:32,358
...shined his shoes
or called taxis for him.

1443
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:35,083
Each day the crowd got bigger...

1444
01:35:35,289 --> 01:35:38,201
...noisier, greedier.

1445
01:35:38,409 --> 01:35:41,446
At last, we stopped going out there.

1446
01:35:41,649 --> 01:35:45,324
And after that? After you stopped
going to the public beach?

1447
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:46,723
Then one day...

1448
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:51,320
...a few days after we'd stopped
going out to the beach...

1449
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:54,407
...it was a blazing white day.

1450
01:35:54,609 --> 01:35:58,966
Not a blazing hot blue day,
but a blazing hot white one.

1451
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:03,687
We had a late lunch at a shabby,
lonely restaurant by the sea there.

1452
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:06,198
Sebastian was white as the weather.

1453
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:11,119
He had on a white silk suit,
a white tie, a white Panama.

1454
01:36:11,449 --> 01:36:15,328
And he kept touching his face
and his throat here and there...

1455
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:17,440
...with a white silk handkerchief...

1456
01:36:17,609 --> 01:36:20,601
...popping little white pills
into his mouth all the time.

1457
01:36:20,769 --> 01:36:24,648
I knew he was having a bad time with
his heart and that it frightened him.

1458
01:36:24,849 --> 01:36:26,726
"Let's go north," he kept saying.

1459
01:36:26,889 --> 01:36:30,882
"I think we've done Cabeza de Lobo.
I think we've done it, don't you?"

1460
01:36:31,089 --> 01:36:32,488
I thought we'd done it.

1461
01:36:32,649 --> 01:36:35,721
Then there were those children
along the beach...

1462
01:36:35,929 --> 01:36:39,524
...which was fenced off with wire
from the restaurant.

1463
01:36:39,689 --> 01:36:43,728
Our table was less than a yard away
from the wire fence.

1464
01:36:43,929 --> 01:36:45,999
And those children...

1465
01:36:46,169 --> 01:36:48,399
There was a band of them.

1466
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:50,799
They looked like a flock
of plucked birds...

1467
01:36:51,009 --> 01:36:53,398
...and they came darting up
to the wire fence...

1468
01:36:53,569 --> 01:36:55,958
...as if they'd been blown
there by the wind...

1469
01:36:56,129 --> 01:36:58,643
...by the hot, white wind
from the sea.

1470
01:36:58,849 --> 01:37:02,239
They were all calling out,
"<i>Pan</i>! <i>Pan</i>! <i>Pan</i>!"

1471
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,007
They were calling for bread?

1472
01:37:04,209 --> 01:37:06,723
They made gobbling noises
with their mouths...

1473
01:37:06,889 --> 01:37:09,767
...stuffing their fists
into their mouths and making...

1474
01:37:09,929 --> 01:37:13,205
...gobbling noises
with frightful grins.

1475
01:37:14,249 --> 01:37:18,367
We were sorry we'd come to the place,
but it was too late to go.

1476
01:37:18,569 --> 01:37:20,207
Why was it too late to go?

1477
01:37:20,409 --> 01:37:25,437
I told you. Cousin Sebastian
wasn't well. His eyes looked dazed.

1478
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:28,521
But he said, " Don't look
at those little monsters.

1479
01:37:28,689 --> 01:37:31,044
Beggars are a social disease
in this country.

1480
01:37:31,209 --> 01:37:33,769
If you look at them,
you get sick of the country.

1481
01:37:33,929 --> 01:37:36,397
It spoils the whole country for you."

1482
01:37:37,689 --> 01:37:39,281
Go on.

1483
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:42,928
Go on.

1484
01:37:46,929 --> 01:37:48,521
Go on.

1485
01:37:49,049 --> 01:37:51,358
I am going on.

1486
01:37:51,569 --> 01:37:54,959
The band of children began
to serenade us.

1487
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,558
- Began to what?
- Play for us on instruments...

1488
01:37:57,769 --> 01:38:01,318
...make music, if you
could call it music.

1489
01:38:01,529 --> 01:38:05,727
Their instruments were the instruments
of percussion, know what I mean?

1490
01:38:05,929 --> 01:38:08,648
Yes, instruments of percussion,
like drums.

1491
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:13,479
As far as I could make out in
the white blaze of the sand beach...

1492
01:38:13,689 --> 01:38:17,364
...the instruments were tin cans
strung together...

1493
01:38:17,569 --> 01:38:20,003
...and bits of metal,
other bits of metal...

1494
01:38:20,209 --> 01:38:23,246
...that had been flattened out
and made into...

1495
01:38:23,729 --> 01:38:25,685
- Into what?
- Cymbals, you know?

1496
01:38:26,249 --> 01:38:28,717
- Brass plates hit together.
- That's right.

1497
01:38:28,929 --> 01:38:32,968
Tin cans flattened out
and clashed together. Cymbals.

1498
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:37,443
The others had other things.
All sorts of things.

1499
01:38:37,649 --> 01:38:42,404
Things that they'd made or picked up
on the beach to make a sort of noise.

1500
01:38:43,409 --> 01:38:45,923
A music made out of noise.

1501
01:38:46,089 --> 01:38:47,158
Go on.

1502
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:49,604
I am going on.
Nothing could stop me now.

1503
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:53,597
Your Cousin Sebastian, was he
entertained by this concert?

1504
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:55,879
- Terrified of it.
- Terrified, why?

1505
01:38:56,089 --> 01:38:59,638
I think he recognized some
of the musicians.

1506
01:38:59,849 --> 01:39:01,123
Some of the boys.

1507
01:39:01,889 --> 01:39:04,084
Between childhood and older.

1508
01:39:04,289 --> 01:39:06,598
Did he complain to the manager
about it?

1509
01:39:07,129 --> 01:39:10,644
What manager? God?
You don't understand my cousin.

1510
01:39:11,049 --> 01:39:12,038
How do you mean?

1511
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:17,408
He accepted all as how things are...

1512
01:39:17,609 --> 01:39:22,319
...and thought nobody had any right
to complain or interfere whatsoever.

1513
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:26,044
Even though he knew what
was awful was awful...

1514
01:39:26,249 --> 01:39:28,205
...that what was wrong was wrong.

1515
01:39:28,409 --> 01:39:32,925
He thought it unfitting to ever take
any action about anything whatsoever...

1516
01:39:33,129 --> 01:39:36,599
...except to go on doing
as something in him directed.

1517
01:39:36,809 --> 01:39:39,687
What did this something in him
direct him to do?

1518
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:43,922
He suddenly pushed himself
away from the table and said:

1519
01:39:44,089 --> 01:39:47,047
"They've got to stop.
Make them stop. I'm not a well man.

1520
01:39:47,209 --> 01:39:50,246
I have a heart condition.
It's making me sick."

1521
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:53,759
That was the first time that
Cousin Sebastian ever attempted...

1522
01:39:53,929 --> 01:39:56,489
...to correct a human situation.

1523
01:39:56,689 --> 01:40:01,285
I think that
that was his fatal error.

1524
01:40:01,449 --> 01:40:05,806
He stalked out of the restaurant after
throwing paper money on the table.

1525
01:40:06,009 --> 01:40:08,125
He fled from the place.

1526
01:40:08,289 --> 01:40:09,278
I followed.

1527
01:40:09,449 --> 01:40:13,761
It was all white outside.

1528
01:40:13,929 --> 01:40:16,204
White hot. A blazing white hot, it...

1529
01:40:16,409 --> 01:40:20,322
You followed Sebastian out of the
restaurant onto that hot, white street?

1530
01:40:20,529 --> 01:40:21,803
Running along the beach...

1531
01:40:22,009 --> 01:40:24,842
- You ran along the beach?
- No, no. We didn't.

1532
01:40:25,049 --> 01:40:26,562
We didn't move either way.

1533
01:40:28,889 --> 01:40:33,167
I rarely made any suggestion,
but this time I did.

1534
01:40:33,369 --> 01:40:34,927
What did you suggest?

1535
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:39,088
Sebastian seemed to be paralysed
near the entrance at the café.

1536
01:40:39,329 --> 01:40:42,287
So I said, "Let's go."
I remember I said:

1537
01:40:42,529 --> 01:40:45,805
"Down that way is the harbour,
we're likely to find a taxi there.

1538
01:40:46,049 --> 01:40:49,280
Or why don't we go back in
and have them call us a taxi?

1539
01:40:49,489 --> 01:40:51,957
Oh, let's do! Let's do that.
That's better."

1540
01:40:52,169 --> 01:40:56,208
And he said, "Are you mad?
Go back in that filthy place? Never!

1541
01:40:56,409 --> 01:41:00,038
That gang of kids shouted vile
things about me to the waiters."

1542
01:41:00,249 --> 01:41:02,922
I said, "Well, let's go down
towards the harbour.

1543
01:41:03,129 --> 01:41:07,680
Let's not try to climb that hill
in this dreadful heat."

1544
01:41:07,849 --> 01:41:10,488
And Cousin Sebastian shouted,
"Please shut up!

1545
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:14,602
Let me handle this situation, will
you? I want to handle this thing."

1546
01:41:15,929 --> 01:41:20,207
And he started up the steep street
with a hand stuck in his jacket...

1547
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:24,322
...where I knew he was having
a pain from his palpitations.

1548
01:41:24,529 --> 01:41:29,125
But he walked faster
and faster in panic.

1549
01:41:29,329 --> 01:41:30,887
The faster he walked...

1550
01:41:31,089 --> 01:41:34,047
...the louder and the closer it got.

1551
01:41:34,249 --> 01:41:36,968
- Closer what got?
- The music!

1552
01:41:37,129 --> 01:41:39,597
- The music again?
- The music!

1553
01:41:39,809 --> 01:41:42,164
The noise of the following band.

1554
01:41:42,369 --> 01:41:45,566
They were following.
They were following...

1555
01:41:45,769 --> 01:41:48,329
...up the blazing white street.

1556
01:41:48,529 --> 01:41:52,807
Up. Straight up. That was the only
way open, so he went that way.

1557
01:41:53,089 --> 01:41:55,762
He tried to escape from those streets?

1558
01:41:55,969 --> 01:42:00,042
He tried to escape
from those streets...

1559
01:42:00,209 --> 01:42:04,999
- He couldn't find a way out?
- He couldn't find a way out.

1560
01:42:05,209 --> 01:42:07,200
Did the band of children...?

1561
01:42:07,369 --> 01:42:10,327
When he tried to escape...

1562
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:12,361
...from those streets...

1563
01:42:13,049 --> 01:42:17,281
...down those little side streets,
between the buildings...

1564
01:42:17,449 --> 01:42:19,883
...they came from everywhere.

1565
01:42:20,089 --> 01:42:22,398
So the only way was up.

1566
01:42:22,609 --> 01:42:24,565
The only way was straight up...

1567
01:42:24,769 --> 01:42:26,646
...up those steep, white streets...

1568
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:31,081
...in the sun, that was like a great
white bone of a giant beast...

1569
01:42:31,249 --> 01:42:33,240
...that had caught on fire in the sky.

1570
01:42:33,449 --> 01:42:35,724
And Sebastian kept
running straight up.

1571
01:42:35,889 --> 01:42:38,278
I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran...

1572
01:42:38,449 --> 01:42:40,838
...but he ran and he ran and he ran...

1573
01:42:41,049 --> 01:42:43,438
...where it was whiter and emptier.

1574
01:42:43,649 --> 01:42:44,968
What was emptier?

1575
01:42:45,169 --> 01:42:48,479
The light. The sky and the light.

1576
01:42:48,649 --> 01:42:53,484
Those steep, white streets and the sun,
and everything blazed white and empty.

1577
01:42:53,649 --> 01:42:56,322
Where did those streets lead to?

1578
01:42:56,489 --> 01:42:57,478
Nowhere!

1579
01:42:57,649 --> 01:42:58,638
He never reached...?

1580
01:42:58,849 --> 01:43:03,320
He never reached the end.
They stopped nowhere! Never!

1581
01:43:03,529 --> 01:43:05,918
Except, except...

1582
01:43:06,089 --> 01:43:07,841
- Except?
- At the...

1583
01:43:08,209 --> 01:43:10,564
At the very top of the hill.

1584
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:15,086
Something. A place, a ruin.

1585
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,166
Broken stones. Like...

1586
01:43:17,369 --> 01:43:18,438
Like what?

1587
01:43:18,649 --> 01:43:22,085
Like the entrance...

1588
01:43:22,249 --> 01:43:25,924
...to a ruined temple...

1589
01:43:26,089 --> 01:43:29,638
...some ancient ruined temple...

1590
01:43:29,849 --> 01:43:32,522
...which he entered.

1591
01:43:34,249 --> 01:43:36,638
And they...

1592
01:43:36,929 --> 01:43:38,760
...overtook him.

1593
01:43:41,129 --> 01:43:43,085
There, in that...

1594
01:43:43,689 --> 01:43:46,522
And you, Catherine,
what did you do then?

1595
01:43:47,729 --> 01:43:49,959
I heard Sebastian scream.

1596
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,044
He screamed just once.

1597
01:43:57,449 --> 01:43:58,598
Then I...

1598
01:44:01,729 --> 01:44:03,447
Then I...

1599
01:44:04,369 --> 01:44:06,405
Help!

1600
01:44:07,449 --> 01:44:09,758
Help!

1601
01:44:10,169 --> 01:44:11,761
Help!

1602
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:13,928
And then? Then?

1603
01:44:14,089 --> 01:44:16,319
I ran. They let me run.

1604
01:44:16,489 --> 01:44:18,764
- They didn't even see me.
- Run where?

1605
01:44:18,929 --> 01:44:19,918
Down.

1606
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:23,007
The waiters, police, people...

1607
01:44:23,209 --> 01:44:26,201
...ran out of buildings,
back up to where...

1608
01:44:26,409 --> 01:44:30,038
...to where Cousin Sebastian...

1609
01:44:32,009 --> 01:44:36,161
He was lying naked...

1610
01:44:36,369 --> 01:44:39,008
...on the broken stones.

1611
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:43,686
And this you won't believe.

1612
01:44:43,849 --> 01:44:48,559
Nobody, nobody could believe it.

1613
01:44:51,729 --> 01:44:54,289
It looked as if...

1614
01:44:54,489 --> 01:44:57,720
...as if they had devoured him!

1615
01:44:58,809 --> 01:45:01,448
As if they had torn or cut...

1616
01:45:01,649 --> 01:45:05,005
...parts of him away
with their hands...

1617
01:45:05,609 --> 01:45:11,047
...or with knives or those jagged
tin cans they made music with.

1618
01:45:12,289 --> 01:45:15,565
As if they'd torn bits of him away...

1619
01:45:15,729 --> 01:45:21,008
...and stuffed them
in their own gobbling mouths!

1620
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:28,319
There wasn't a sound anymore.

1621
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:31,561
There was nothing...

1622
01:45:32,889 --> 01:45:35,198
...but Sebastian...

1623
01:45:37,769 --> 01:45:42,160
...lying on those stones...

1624
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:46,567
...torn and crushed.

1625
01:45:56,849 --> 01:45:58,521
Oh, Cathy.

1626
01:46:03,529 --> 01:46:05,121
Mrs. Venable.

1627
01:46:10,569 --> 01:46:12,525
There you are.

1628
01:46:12,729 --> 01:46:14,481
I thought you were still on deck.

1629
01:46:14,689 --> 01:46:19,046
And where's your hat?
Oh, dear, you'll get fever.

1630
01:46:19,209 --> 01:46:22,326
A whole day up there in the rigging
in the hot sun.

1631
01:46:22,529 --> 01:46:25,885
Watching those awful, hungry birds.

1632
01:46:26,089 --> 01:46:29,047
I don't know what you see
in such terrible sights.

1633
01:46:29,249 --> 01:46:32,559
It's too much for both of us,
my darling.

1634
01:46:32,769 --> 01:46:34,919
That horrible sun.

1635
01:47:02,969 --> 01:47:04,687
Of course God is cruel.

1636
01:47:04,889 --> 01:47:08,882
We didn't need to come to the
Encantadas to find that out, did we?

1637
01:47:09,049 --> 01:47:10,721
We've always known about him.

1638
01:47:10,889 --> 01:47:15,360
The savage face he shows to people,
and the fierce things he shouts.

1639
01:47:15,569 --> 01:47:20,324
It's all we ever see or hear
of him now. Nobody seems to know why.

1640
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:21,718
The difference is...

1641
01:47:21,889 --> 01:47:25,245
...we know about him, the others don't.
That's where we're lucky.

1642
01:47:25,409 --> 01:47:26,842
Go rest, my darling.

1643
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:28,960
Look out for that fever.

1644
01:47:29,129 --> 01:47:33,327
I'm going to see the captain and tell
him to change our course for home.

1645
01:47:33,529 --> 01:47:35,997
Oh, Sebastian.

1646
01:47:36,209 --> 01:47:39,838
What a lovely summer it's been.
Just the two of us.

1647
01:47:40,009 --> 01:47:41,727
Sebastian and Violet.

1648
01:47:41,929 --> 01:47:43,681
Violet and Sebastian.

1649
01:47:43,889 --> 01:47:46,403
Just the way it's always going to be.

1650
01:47:46,609 --> 01:47:49,077
Oh, we are lucky, my darling...

1651
01:47:49,249 --> 01:47:52,161
...to have one another
and need no one else, ever.

1652
01:48:05,609 --> 01:48:09,727
There's every possibility
that the girl's story is true.

1653
01:48:15,049 --> 01:48:17,517
George, tell her she's got
to come home with us.

1654
01:48:17,689 --> 01:48:19,680
- Doctor?
- Catherine will be all right.

1655
01:48:19,849 --> 01:48:22,238
- Can she come home?
- Don't worry, she will.

1656
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:26,243
- Why don't you take your mother?
- Sure. Come on, Ma.

1657
01:48:36,329 --> 01:48:37,318
Miss Catherine?

1658
01:48:38,409 --> 01:48:40,240
She's here, doctor.

1659
01:48:42,009 --> 01:48:44,000
Miss Catherine's here.
