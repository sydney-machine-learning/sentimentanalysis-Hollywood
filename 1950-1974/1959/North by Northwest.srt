00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,540
NORTH BY NORTHWEST

2
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,619
"Even if you accept the belief that a high
Trendex means a rising sales curve...."

3
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,099
-Mr. Thornhill?
-Good night, Eddie.

4
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,500
-Say hello to the missus.
-We're not talking.

5
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,419
"My recommendation is still the same.

6
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,419
"Spread the good word in as many
small time segments as we can.

7
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,139
"Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

8
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,899
"Let's colonize at the Colony
one day next week for lunch.

9
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,459
"Let me hear from you, Sam.
Happy thoughts, etc...."

10
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,060
You better walk me to the Plaza.

11
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,219
-I didn't put a coat on.
-Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

12
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,739
-Next?
-Gretchen Sabinson.

13
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:41,500
Oh, yes.

14
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,379
Send her a box of candy from Blum's.
$10. You know the kind.

15
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,859
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll think she's eating money.

16
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,579
Just tell her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours--"

17
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,619
-You sent that one last time.
-I did?

18
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,619
Put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts! "

19
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:57,619
I know.

20
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:58,899
Could we take a cab?

21
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,060
-For two blocks?
-You're late and I'm tired.

22
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,699
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

23
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,780
Here. Taxi.

24
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,419
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

25
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,659
Thank you very much.

26
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,179
Perfectly all right.

27
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,780
First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.

28
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,780
Poor man.

29
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,979
I made him a happy man.
I made him feel like a good Samaritan.

30
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,659
He knew you were lying.

31
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,619
In the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

32
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,979
There's only "the expedient exaggeration."
You ought to know that.

33
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,259
Do I look heavyish to you?

34
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,219
What?

35
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,579
I feel heavyish.

36
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,259
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin."

37
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:36,579
"Think thin."

38
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,379
Better make it the 59th Street entrance.

39
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,179
Okay.

40
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,060
Soon as you get back, call my mother.

41
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,419
Remind her we have theatre tickets
for tonight.

42
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,219
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

43
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:51,299
I'll have had two martini's at the Oak Bar
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

44
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,060
-She doesn't do that.
-Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

45
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,739
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first for tomorrow.
The Skin Glow rehearsal's at noon.

46
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,659
Then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

47
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,219
-Where was that?
-Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.

48
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,019
-Will you check in later?
-Absolutely not.

49
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,979
Here, Driver. Take this lady
back where she belongs.

50
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,979
-Right.
-That ought to cover it.

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,139
-Don't forget, call my mother right away.
-I won't.

52
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,819
-Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
-Good night.

53
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,459
Wait, Maggie! You can't call her.
She's at Mrs.--

54
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,219
Good evening, Mr. Thornhill.

55
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,620
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

56
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,339
Yes, sir. Right this way.

57
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,099
Herman.

58
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,819
-Hello, Roger.
-I'm a little late.

59
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,579
Roger Thornhill. Fanning Nelson.

60
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,699
-We've gotten a head start here.
-That won't last long.

61
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,019
I was saying that you may be slow
in starting, but there's nobody faster.

62
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,180
What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.

63
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,899
I told my secretary to call Mother and
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

64
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:11,860
Why not?

65
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,099
She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

66
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,779
-Your secretary?
-No. My mother.

67
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,740
Mr. Kaplan?

68
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,819
It's one of those new apartments,
wet paint and no telephone yet.

69
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,939
Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

70
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,300
Mr. George Kaplan?

71
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,180
Boy!

72
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,459
Kaplan.

73
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,979
I have to send a wire.

74
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,420
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,459
I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me....

76
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,699
-Will you excuse me?
-Go right ahead.

77
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,939
-Right through there, sir.
-Thanks.

78
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,259
Thank you, sir.

79
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,139
What's that supposed to be?

80
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,579
The car is waiting outside.
You'll walk between us saying nothing.

81
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,860
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go.

82
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,459
Go where? Who....

83
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:58,979
Who are you?

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,180
Mere errand boys,
carrying concealed weapons.

85
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,019
His is pointed at your heart, so, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

86
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,860
What is this? A joke or something?

87
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,259
Yes, a joke. We'll laugh in the car.

88
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,259
Come.

89
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,740
This is ridiculous.

90
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,860
Don't tell me where we're going.
Surprise me.

91
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,339
I left some friends
back there in the Oak Bar.

92
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,300
They'll think I'm awfully rude.

93
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,180
Could we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

94
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,339
...so that I could explain
I'm being kidnapped?

95
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,899
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

96
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
Locked.

97
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,779
TOWNSEND

98
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,699
Who's Townsend?

99
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,979
Really?

100
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,860
Interesting.

101
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,500
-Where is he?
-Upstairs, dressing.

102
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,019
-Tell him I'm here.
-The dinner guests are expected.

103
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."

104
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,379
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

105
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,060
-Is anyone in the library?
-No.

106
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,099
This way.

107
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
You will wait here.

108
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,339
Don't hurry. I'll catch up on my reading.

109
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,259
MR. LESTER TOWNSEND
169 BAYWOOD, GLEN COVE, N.Y.

110
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,740
Good evening.

111
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,220
Not what I expected. A little taller...

112
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,660
...a little more polished than the others.

113
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,340
I'm so glad you're pleased, Mr. Townsend.

114
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,700
But, I'm afraid, just as obvious.

115
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,900
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

116
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,900
Games? Must we?

117
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,940
Not that I mind a slight case of abduction,
but I have tickets for the theatre tonight.

118
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,780
To a show I was looking forward to.

119
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,220
I get unreasonable about things like that.

120
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,259
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theatre.

121
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,620
Leonard, have you met
our distinguished guest?

122
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,220
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

123
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,780
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

124
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,940
Elusiveness, however misguided--

125
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,379
Wait a minute.

126
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,460
Did you call me "Kaplan"?

127
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,740
I know you're a man of many names,
but I'll accept your current choice.

128
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,060
Current choice?

129
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,620
My name is Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

130
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,860
Of course.

131
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,379
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

132
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,180
Sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

133
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,340
I told you, I'm not Kaplan, whoever he is.

134
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

135
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,620
The guests are here, dear.

136
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,340
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

137
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,580
Now, shall we get down to business?

138
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,700
I'm all for that.

139
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,100
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

140
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,220
...and how you've come by
this information.

141
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,820
-I don't expect to get this for nothing.
-Of course not.

142
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,980
Don't misunderstand.

143
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,540
I don't expect you to fall in
with the suggestion...

144
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,820
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

145
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,900
What is that supposed to mean?

146
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,580
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

147
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,740
I've told you--

148
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,420
We know where you're headed for.

149
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,740
I know where I'm headed.
The Winter Garden Theatre in New York.

150
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,900
And I think I'd better get going.

151
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,140
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

152
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,020
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

153
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,660
I'm not Kaplan!

154
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,300
I do wish you would reconsider.

155
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,220
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

156
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,820
What contact?
I've never been in Pittsburgh.

157
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,020
On June 16, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

158
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,460
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

159
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,379
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

160
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,820
...in Philadelphia
as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

161
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,020
On August 11,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

162
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,980
On August 29, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

163
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,259
At present, you are registered
in Room 796...

164
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,780
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

165
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,500
In two days, you are due
at the Ambassador East in Chicago.

166
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,340
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

167
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,140
Not me!

168
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,180
There's no sense in maintaining
that you are deceiving us...

169
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,259
...any more than we are deceiving you.

170
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,340
I suppose it wouldn't do any good
to show you ID cards...

171
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,220
...a driver's license, things like that?

172
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,140
They provide you with such good ones.

173
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,220
It's getting late. I have guests.

174
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,140
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

175
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:46,420
A simple no.

176
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,420
For the simple reason that I simply
don't know what you're talking about.

177
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.

178
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,020
A pleasant journey, sir.

179
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,379
Scotch? Rye?

180
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,180
Bourbon? Vodka?

181
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,980
Nothing. I'll take a quick ride
back to town.

182
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,660
That has been arranged.

183
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,060
But first, a libation.

184
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,259
Bourbon!

185
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,700
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.

186
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,020
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, we'll have to insist.

187
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Cheers!

188
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,540
Don't worry about me. I'll take the bus.

189
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,819
Thanks for the lift.

190
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,620
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.

191
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,700
Really?

192
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,940
You see, they tried to kill me.

193
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,740
He won't listen to me.

194
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,019
In a big house. They tried to kill me.

195
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,100
-All right. Let's just go inside.
-I don't want to go inside.

196
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,539
Somebody call the police.

197
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,140
Come on. Come on now.

198
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,940
Okay.

199
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,420
Sit down.

200
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,819
I don't want to sit.

201
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,980
Perfectly all right. See?

202
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,180
We'll get 'em. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.

203
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,819
Assault with a gun and a bourbon
and a sports car.

204
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
We'll get 'em.

205
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,460
You'll be fine after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.

206
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,620
I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.

207
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,740
The car was just reported stolen.

208
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,980
A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.

209
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,779
I got to call someone. Where's the phone?

210
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,420
You're allowed one call.

211
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,980
Over here.

212
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Thanks.

213
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,860
You better make it your lawyer.

214
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,460
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

215
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,620
What am l, a telephone operator?

216
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,380
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

217
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,700
Just a minute, please.

218
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,299
-Here.
-Thank you.

219
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,860
Hello, Mother?

220
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:49,460
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.

221
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,740
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

222
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,660
Where am l?

223
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,660
Glen Cove Police Station.

224
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,340
Glen Cove Police Station.

225
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,539
No, Mother, I have not been drinking.

226
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,100
No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.

227
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,539
No, they didn't give me a chaser.

228
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,700
Come on, let's go.

229
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,019
-Wait, I'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are. Come on.

230
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,100
Mother, I got to go now.

231
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,100
Get my lawyer right away
and come and bail me out.

232
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,019
Tomorrow morning, tell her.

233
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,940
Tomorrow morning, he says.

234
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,460
I don't know. I'll ask him.

235
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,220
She wants to know who says.

236
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:36,059
Sergeant Emil Klinger.

237
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,819
Sergeant Emil....

238
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,340
Emil?

239
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,660
Sergeant Emil Klinger.

240
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,220
No. I didn't believe it either.

241
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,420
I'm all right, Mother. Good night.

242
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,539
That was Mother.

243
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,299
Let's go.

244
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:06,380
Here's your man, Doctor.

245
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,539
What's your name?

246
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,259
Roger Thornhill.

247
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Stick out your tongue and say: "ah."

248
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,059
You better move back.

249
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,420
Have you been drinking?

250
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,460
Doctor, I am gassed.

251
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,340
What were you drinking?

252
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,500
Well, bourbon. See, these two fellas--

253
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,140
-How much would you say you drank?
-What?

254
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,299
-How much would you say you drank?
-About this much.

255
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,460
Mr. Thornhill, my opinion
is that you are definitely intoxicated.

256
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,700
No question about it.

257
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,860
I won't ask your permission to draw blood.

258
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
How disgusting!

259
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,380
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made...

260
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,860
"...but if you do,
your license will be revoked."

261
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,259
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...

262
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:53,259
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...

263
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,259
...he, naturally, had to drive
as best he could under the circumstances.

264
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,019
How long have you known your client?

265
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,580
Seven years, Your Honor.

266
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,700
Do you know him to be a reasonable man?

267
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,180
Absolutely.

268
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,019
Mother!

269
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:11,059
Do you believe there is some credence
to this story?

270
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,380
Credence!

271
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,420
Yes, Your Honor. If my client says
this is what happened...

272
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,299
...I'm certain it must've happened.

273
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,220
Damn right.

274
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,500
I want this turned over
to the County Detectives for investigation.

275
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,740
Call them and have them
come here immediately.

276
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:25,860
Right, Your Honor.

277
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,500
Counselor, I'm going to set this over
for final disposition tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.

278
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,700
I expect you and the defendant to be here,
ready to go to trial.

279
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,740
In the meantime, the County Detectives'll
determine if his story has any basis in fact.

280
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,220
"Basis in fact"? lf I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe--

281
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,220
Wait a minute.

282
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:47,059
After all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?

283
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:50,779
That is precisely what were intending
to find out, Mr. Thornhill.

284
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,460
Remember me?

285
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,900
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

286
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,340
-Is Mr. Townsend at home?
-No, I'm sorry he's left for the day.

287
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,580
Mrs. Townsend?

288
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:20,140
-Who shall I say is calling?
-County Detectives.

289
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,620
Come in, please.

290
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,700
This way, please.

291
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,019
This is the room.

292
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,259
I'll call Madam.

293
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,259
You do that.

294
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,299
Here's the sofa where they held me down.

295
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,500
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.

296
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,140
Somebody must've cleaned them off.

297
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,819
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.

298
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,460
Scotch, gin, vodka....

299
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,580
And bourbon.

300
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,380
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.

301
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,700
Dear, we were so worried about you!

302
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
Did you get home all right?

303
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,220
Of course you did.

304
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,660
Let me look at you.
A little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?

305
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,299
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.

306
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,420
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.

307
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,500
Mrs. Townsend, I'm Capt. Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.

308
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,740
This is Lt. Harding.

309
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:37,539
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?

310
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,019
-Stop calling me Roger.
-Has he gotten into trouble?

311
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,340
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...

312
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,180
...incidentally, in a stolen car...

313
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,180
Stolen car!

314
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,620
...belonging to Mrs. Babson
of Twining Road.

315
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,019
Roger, you said you were going
to call a cab.

316
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:54,380
You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?

317
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,819
No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes!

318
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,180
Mr. Thornhill has told us that he was
brought here against his will last night...

319
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,900
...and forcibly intoxicated by some friends
of your husband and set out on the road.

320
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,900
Do you know anything about this?

321
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,700
Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.

322
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:12,660
She's lying.

323
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,980
And I'm afraid he became even worse
as the evening wore on.

324
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,140
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.

325
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,620
I knew I should've served dinner earlier.

326
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,100
What a performance!

327
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,740
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?

328
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,059
George Kaplan?

329
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,580
-No.
-I didn't think so.

330
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,220
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.

331
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:35,980
Is there any place he can be reached?

332
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,779
Yes. The United Nations.

333
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,580
He's addressing the General Assembly
this afternoon.

334
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,019
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.

335
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,779
-Sorry we had to bother you.
-No bother at all.

336
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:54,460
Now, wait a minute.

337
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,740
Do you want to get in touch
with my husband, Captain?

338
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,019
No, Mrs. Townsend,
that won't be necessary.

339
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,019
Do you mean you're not going
to do any more about this?

340
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,740
Pay the two dollars.

341
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,819
Goodbye.

342
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,500
-I don't see why you want me along.
-You lend a certain air of respectability.

343
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,259
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.

344
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,580
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.

345
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,299
Well, here it goes.

346
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,380
Hello, Operator.

347
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,940
Have you got a George Kaplan
staying here?

348
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,580
That's right.

349
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:22,220
You have?

350
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,580
Room 796.

351
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,259
Ring it, will you please?

352
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,299
-You see?
-I see.

353
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,019
I hope he clears up this silly business.
You're ruining my whole day.

354
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,220
Did he leave word when he'd be back?

355
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,420
Really?

356
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,819
Thank you.

357
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,819
That's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.

358
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,779
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.

359
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,740
Mother, do me a favor, will you?

360
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,140
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.

361
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,940
I wouldn't do such a thing!

362
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,220
-$10?
-Not for all the money in the world.

363
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,660
-$50?
-Roger, you are disgraceful.

364
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,180
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge...

365
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,059
...and now, house-breaking.

366
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,299
-No, hotel-breaking. There's a difference.
-Of five to ten years.

367
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,660
Just a minute, please.

368
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,700
Will you be wanting me
to change your bedding, sir?

369
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,660
Yes. Well, but not right now.

370
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,900
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...

371
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,900
...and I was wondering
if I ought to change the linens.

372
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,779
Thank you for your interest.

373
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,220
Come on.

374
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,779
She seemed to think I'm Kaplan.

375
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,500
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.

376
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,860
-Look who's here.
-Who? Where?

377
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,580
Our friend who's assembling
the General Assembly this afternoon.

378
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,779
Roger, I think we should go.

379
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Don't be nervous.

380
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,059
-I'm not. I'll be late for the bridge club.
-Good. You'll lose less than usual.

381
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,100
Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.

382
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,059
In that case, I think we should leave.

383
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,220
Too late.

384
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,380
-You rang for me, sir?
-Yes. Come in for a moment.

385
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,539
-What's your name?
-Elsie, sir.

386
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,580
-Do you know who I am?
-You're Mr. Kaplan.

387
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,779
When did you first see me?

388
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,180
Outside the door.

389
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:47,819
Out in the hall a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?

390
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,980
Is that the first time you laid eyes on me?

391
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,380
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?

392
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,380
Then how do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

393
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,539
-What?
-How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

394
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,980
Of course you are.

395
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,740
This is Room 796, isn't it?

396
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,740
So, you're the gentleman in Room 796,
aren't you?

397
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,140
All right, Elsie, thanks.

398
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,900
-Will that be all, sir?
-For the time being, yes.

399
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,539
Valet.

400
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,819
Yes, come in.

401
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,980
-Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes, please.

402
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,100
Tell me....

403
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,660
What time did I give you that suit?

404
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,660
Last night. Around 6:00.

405
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,180
-Did I give it to you personally?
-Personally?

406
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:39,660
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me.

407
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,900
Said it would be hanging in your closet.
Like you always do.

408
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,580
-Anything wrong?
-No, I'm just curious.

409
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,700
-Here. Thanks.
-Thank you.

410
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,940
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.

411
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,940
Isn't that the damnedest thing?

412
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:59,380
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.

413
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,340
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.

414
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,740
Let me see something.

415
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,259
I don't think that one does
anything for you.

416
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,700
Now, that's much better.

417
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,660
Obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.

418
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:34,660
-Should l?
-Certainly not.

419
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,740
Hold that.

420
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,700
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.

421
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,220
Who is this?

422
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:49,340
We met only last night and still
you do not recognize my voice.

423
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,259
I should feel offended.

424
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,580
Yes, I know who you are
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.

425
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,380
Of course not. You answer his telephone,
you live in his hotel room...

426
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,539
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.

427
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,220
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.

428
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,340
Now wait....

429
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,019
Operator?

430
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,860
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn....
Kaplan in 796.

431
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,660
Where did that call come from?
From the outside or from the lobby?

432
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,100
-Just a minute. I'll see.
-Hurry, please.

433
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,100
Who was it?

434
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,460
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.

435
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,100
We're back to that one, are we?

436
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,420
-That call was made from the lobby, sir.
-It was?

437
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,180
They're probably on their way up here.

438
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:34,660
-Let's get out of here.
-I think I'd like to meet these killers.

439
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,019
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?

440
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,259
Lobby, please. Watch your step.

441
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,380
Gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.

442
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,340
That's right. Come along. Good.

443
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,660
Roger, will you be home for dinner?

444
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,940
-Where to?
-I don't know. Just keep going.

445
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,740
-Take me to the United Nations.
-Right.

446
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:19,460
General Assembly Building.

447
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,500
Right.

448
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,380
-I'm being followed. Can you do anything?
-Yes, I can.

449
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,940
Do it.

450
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,420
-May I help you?
-Yes, please.

451
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,539
Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?

452
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,779
Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?

453
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,340
Did you have an appointment, sir?

454
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,700
Well, yes. He expects me.

455
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,259
Your name, please?

456
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,900
-My name?
-Yes, please.

457
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:12,099
Kaplan. George Kaplan.

458
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:15,980
One moment, please.

459
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,699
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.

460
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,699
If you'd give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.

461
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:37,500
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.

462
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,099
Page Mr. Lester Townsend, please?

463
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,980
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.

464
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:04,779
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

465
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,659
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

466
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:10,299
Please call at the communications desk
of the Public Lounge.

467
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,059
You paged me?

468
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:21,619
-Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes.

469
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:24,739
You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
This is Mr. Townsend.

470
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:26,579
How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?

471
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,739
This isn't Mr. Townsend.

472
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,099
Yes, it is.

473
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:33,500
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?

474
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:35,980
That's me. What can I do for you?

475
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:41,779
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?

476
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:44,019
That's right. Are we neighbors?

477
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:47,819
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?

478
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:49,299
That's the one.

479
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:52,059
Were you at home last night?

480
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,859
-You mean in Glen Cove?
-Yes.

481
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,659
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.

482
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,980
I always do when we're in session here.

483
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,419
What about Mrs. Townsend?

484
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:03,259
My wife has been dead for many years.

485
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:05,419
Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?

486
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:08,019
Who are those people living in your house?

487
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,460
What people?
The house is completely closed up.

488
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:13,739
There's just a gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

489
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:16,339
Now, Mr. Kaplan, tell me who you are
and what you want.

490
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,859
Do you know this man?

491
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:31,739
Look!

492
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,739
He's got a knife! Look out!

493
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,219
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.

494
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:42,859
-Call the police.
-Don't come any nearer!

495
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:43,939
Get back!

496
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,219
UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

"The photograph has been identified
as that of Roger Thornhill...

00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:10,460
"...a Manhattan advertising executive,

00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:14,980

Brother!

507
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,859
What about that?

508
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,899
Does anyone know this Thornhill?

509
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:40,460
No, not me.

510
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:41,739
Never heard of him.

511
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,259
Professor?

512
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:46,859
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.

513
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:50,500
How could he be mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

514
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,739
Don't ask me how it happened,
but obviously it happened.

515
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:57,460
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...

516
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,460
...using Lester Townsend's house.

517
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:02,739
And the unsuspecting Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.

518
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:05,339
C'est la guerre.

519
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,139
It's so horribly sad.
Why is it I feel like laughing?

520
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,859
What are we going to do?

521
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:10,779
Do?

522
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,779
About Mr. Thornhill?

523
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:15,819
We...do nothing!

524
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:17,579
Nothing?

525
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:19,460
That's right. Nothing.

526
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:23,980
We could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.

527
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,099
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...

528
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:32,939
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.

529
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,419
Yes, Professor.

530
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,779
How long do you think he'll stay alive?

531
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,259
That's his problem.

532
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,980
What Mrs. Finley means--

533
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:42,419
I know what she means.

534
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,579
We can't sit back calmly and wait to see
who kills him first!

535
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,539
Vandamm and company or the police?

536
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:52,139
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?

537
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,859
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?

538
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,579
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.

539
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,980
We didn't invent our non-existent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...

540
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:04,939
...establish elaborate behavior patterns
for him...

541
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:09,419
...move his prop belongings in and out
of hotel rooms, for our private amusement.

542
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,980
We created George Kaplan...

543
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,500
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...

544
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,379
...that this was our agent hot on his trail
for a desperately important reason.

545
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,619
Nobody's denying that!

546
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:21,939
Very well, then.

547
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,339
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there's no such agent as George Kaplan...

548
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:30,699
...give any hint to Vandamm he's pursuing
a decoy instead of our own agent...

549
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:33,980
...then our agent, working right under
Vandamm's very nose...

550
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,099
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...

551
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,299
...and assassination.

552
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,339
Like the two others who went before.

553
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,619
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are.

554
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,059
Train number 25...

555
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,619
...the 20th Century Limited...

556
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,619
...due to leave in 6:00 p.m. for Chicago....

557
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,899
Yes, dear. I know.

558
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,339
Now, listen to me, Mother,
I called the Plaza.

559
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:17,859
Kaplan checked out and went
to the Ambassador East in Chicago.

560
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:19,299
That's why I'm--

561
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:22,539
I can't go to the police. At least not yet.

562
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:25,339
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife.

563
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:28,379
I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and a murderer.

564
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:29,980
I wouldn't have a chance.

565
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,539
I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is about.

566
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,619
No, the train. It's safer.

567
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:41,059
Because there's no place to hide on a plane
if anyone should recognize me.

568
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,179
You want me to jump off a moving plane?

569
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:47,980
Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Goodbye.

570
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:03,019
MANHUNT ON FOR U. N. KILLER

571
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,899
Give me a bedroom
on the 20th Century, please.

572
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,460
It's leaving in five minutes.

573
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:31,219
I know. Will you make it snappy?

574
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:33,139
I think they're all sold out.

575
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,179
Sold out?

576
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,859
You can always go coach.

577
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:38,579
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?

578
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,500
Nothing till 10:00. You're in a hurry, huh?

579
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:44,619
Could you call them
and see what they have?

580
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,259
Something wrong with your eyes?

581
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:49,339
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?

582
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,779
Sure. Sure.

583
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:54,779
Don't go away!

584
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,500
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.

585
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:10,059
You're in luck, mister.

586
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,500
-Ticket?
-I'm just seeing some friends off.

587
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:22,699
I have to know their names.

588
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:24,859
Come here!

589
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:56,939
I'm sorry.

590
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,699
-I'm sorry.
-My fault.

591
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:00,659
Sorry.

592
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:11,859
He went that way. I think he got off.

593
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:14,019
All aboard!

594
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,859
-Thank you.
-Quite all right.

595
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:21,699
Seven parking tickets.

596
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:40,339
-Good evening, sir. One?
-Please.

597
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,259
A cocktail before dinner?

598
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:57,460
-Yes, please. A Gibson.
-Right away.

599
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,139
Here we are again.

600
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:09,819
Yes.

601
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,019
You recommend anything?

602
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:16,619
The brook trout.
A little "trouty" but quite good.

603
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,379
Sold.

604
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,739
"Brook...

605
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,980
"...trout."

606
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:25,179
-There you are.
-Yes, sir.

607
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,779
I know. I look vaguely familiar.

608
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:39,739
Yes.

609
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,460
You feel you've seen me
somewhere before.

610
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,980
I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

611
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:49,779
It's a nice face.

612
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:53,539
-You think so?
-I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

613
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,099
Oh, you're that type.

614
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:57,219
What type?

615
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:58,579
Honest.

616
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,179
Not really.

617
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:03,179
Good. Because honest women
frighten me.

618
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:04,179
Why?

619
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,379
Somehow they seem to put me
at a disadvantage.

620
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:10,619
-Because you're not honest with them?
-Exactly.

621
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,899
Like that business about
the seven parking tickets?

622
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,099
What I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

623
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:21,819
...l have to start pretending I've no desire
to make love to her.

624
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:24,219
What makes you think
you have to conceal it?

625
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:26,739
She might find the idea objectionable.

626
00:46:27,419 --> 00:46:29,219
Then again, she might not.

627
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:34,739
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

628
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:36,819
Luck had nothing to do with it.

629
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:38,019
Fate?

630
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:43,659
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.

631
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,219
Is that a proposition?

632
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:53,019
I never discuss love on an empty stomach.

633
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:55,139
You've already eaten.

634
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:56,899
But you haven't.

635
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:06,379
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?

636
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:09,899
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.

637
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:12,699
Now you know everything.

638
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:16,939
What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?

639
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:18,899
I'm an industrial designer.

640
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:21,819
Jack Phillips.

641
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:24,659
Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.

642
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:27,099
No, you're not. You're Roger Thornhill...

643
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,819
...of Madison Avenue...

644
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:31,819
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.

645
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,859
Don't be so modest.

646
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:37,699
Don't worry.

647
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,219
-I won't say a word.
-How come?

648
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,819
I told you.

649
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:44,379
It's a nice face.

650
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:46,259
Is that the only reason?

651
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,299
It's going to be a long night.

652
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:50,739
True.

653
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:53,379
I don't particularly like the book
I've started.

654
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:56,379
You know what I mean?

655
00:47:57,819 --> 00:47:59,179
Let me think.

656
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:04,619
I know exactly what you mean.

657
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,500
R.O.T.

658
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,539
That's my trademark. R.O.T.

659
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,659
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?

660
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:23,819
Nothing.

661
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:48,939
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.

662
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,339
A roomette?

663
00:48:50,419 --> 00:48:51,859
Nothing, not even a ticket.

664
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:55,579
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.

665
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,779
How awkward for you.

666
00:48:57,939 --> 00:48:58,899
Yes, isn't it?

667
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,139
No place to sleep.

668
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,699
I have a large drawing-room all to myself.

669
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,059
That doesn't seem quite fair.

670
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:08,500
Drawing-room E.

671
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:10,980
Car 3901 .

672
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:13,219
Such a nice number.

673
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:16,500
It's easy to remember.

674
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,019
3901 .

675
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:20,099
See?

676
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:22,539
No luggage.

677
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:26,859
So?

678
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:30,059
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra pair of pajamas, would you?

679
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,379
Wouldn't l?

680
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:35,539
I wouldn't order any dessert if I were you.

681
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:37,659
I get the message.

682
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:40,139
That isn't exactly what I meant.

683
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:43,219
The train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.

684
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:46,699
I saw two men get out of a police car
as we pulled into the station.

685
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:48,579
They weren't smiling.

686
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:12,659
You better go out
and tell those police to hurry.

687
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:14,259
Patience is a virtue.

688
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:15,819
So is breathing.

689
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:17,379
Just lie still.

690
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,699
Have you got any olive oil?

691
00:50:20,779 --> 00:50:21,939
Olive oil?

692
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:25,019
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm going to be a sardine.

693
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:27,460
Come in.

694
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:31,339
-Who are you?
-State Police.

695
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,939
Your name please?

696
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,299
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?

697
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,939
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.

698
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:40,619
Yes.

699
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:42,219
Friend of yours?

700
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,059
I never saw him before.

701
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:46,699
Is this the man?

702
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:50,980
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.

703
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:54,299
It's a wire-photo.
We just got it from the New York police.

704
00:50:54,379 --> 00:50:55,219
Police?

705
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:56,579
He's wanted for murder.

706
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:59,379
Good heavens, no!

707
00:50:59,859 --> 00:51:02,219
The steward said
you left the dining car together.

708
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:06,259
We might have happened to leave
at the same time but not together.

709
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:08,500
What did you two talk about?

710
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,419
Talk about?

711
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,419
The waiter said you were getting along fine
with this Thornhill.

712
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:15,099
Is that his name? Thornhill?

713
00:51:16,419 --> 00:51:17,699
He didn't tell you?

714
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:20,779
He didn't tell me anything.

715
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,139
All we did was chat about
different kinds of food...

716
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:27,179
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.

717
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:31,500
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.

718
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:33,059
Who did he kill?

719
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:34,899
He didn't say where he was going?

720
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:36,819
No.

721
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:38,500
I assumed Chicago.

722
00:51:38,899 --> 00:51:40,859
Perhaps he got off when you got on?

723
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,179
If you happen to see him again, Miss...

724
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:45,539
Kendall.

725
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,339
...will you let us know?

726
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:52,299
I'm going to bed and I'll lock my door.
I doubt if I'll see anybody else tonight.

727
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,859
In case you do, we'll be in
the observation car at the rear of the train.

728
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:58,259
It's comforting to know that.

729
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:00,779
Good night.

730
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:04,099
Still breathing?

731
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:06,379
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.

732
00:52:07,379 --> 00:52:10,699
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.

733
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:17,099
Hello, there.

734
00:52:17,379 --> 00:52:18,379
Hello.

735
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:32,500
Tell me, why are you so good to me?

736
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,699
Shall I climb up and tell you why?

737
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,699
I've been thinking...

738
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:55,179
...it's not safe for you to roam Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan...

739
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,219
...you've been telling me about.

740
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:01,099
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.

741
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:03,139
It's such a nice face, too.

742
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:10,500
Don't you think it'd be a better idea
if you stayed in my hotel room...

743
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,419
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?

744
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:17,779
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.

745
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:20,179
I'm a big girl.

746
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,899
Yeah, and in all the right places, too.

747
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:31,579
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?

748
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:32,539
Yes.

749
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:34,819
I mean, we've hardly met.

750
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:36,179
That's right.

751
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:39,019
How do I know you aren't a murderer?

752
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:40,739
You don't.

753
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:44,659
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.

754
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:46,619
Shall l?

755
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:49,059
Please do.

756
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,699
Beats flying, doesn't it?

757
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:14,500
We should stop.

758
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,099
Immediately.

759
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:18,579
I ought to know more about you.

760
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,819
What more could you know?

761
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:25,739
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.

762
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,500
That's right.

763
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,139
The train's a little unsteady.

764
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:33,379
Who isn't?

765
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:36,019
What else do you know?

766
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:40,460
You've got taste in clothes, taste in food....

767
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:45,980
And taste in women. I like your flavor.

768
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:56,179
You're very clever with words.

769
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,059
You can probably make them
do anything for you.

770
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:02,339
Sell people things they don't need...

771
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,419
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.

772
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:10,379
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.

773
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,659
Look out.

774
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:38,500
-Don't bother with the washroom.
-Yes, ma'am.

775
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,379
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?

776
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,500
Yes, ma'am. I've been looking for it.

777
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:45,619
-I'll wait outside.
-Thank you.

778
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,019
Thank you, Porter.

779
00:56:03,379 --> 00:56:05,139
Thank you, ma'am. Good night now.

780
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:06,419
Good night.

781
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:12,819
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

782
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:18,739
The porter.

783
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:22,099
So I see.

784
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,579
Where were we?

785
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:32,779
Here.

786
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,939
Nice of him to have opened the bed.

787
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,219
Only one bed.

788
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,739
That's a good omen, don't you think?

789
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:48,980
Wonderful.

790
00:56:50,379 --> 00:56:52,139
Do you know what that means?

791
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,179
What? Tell me.

792
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:57,859
It means you'll sleep on the floor.

793
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,659
A message from the lady in 3901 .

794
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:29,579
What do I do with him
in the morning? Eve.

795
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:05,339
-You keep walking. I'll catch up.
-Yes, ma'am.

796
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:08,179
Anything to report?

797
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:10,939
Yes. I had a fine night's sleep.

798
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:14,019
I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?

799
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,819
Mr. Thornycroft?

800
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:17,619
Thornhill.

801
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:21,139
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.

802
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:23,379
But good luck to you both.

803
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:30,899
-How are we doing?
-I may collapse at any moment.

804
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:34,059
Not yet. First we have to run the gauntlet.
Look.

805
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:43,460
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?

806
00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:45,980
-Bowling balls, naturally.
-Oh, naturally.

807
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:48,259
Which one of these has my suit in it?

808
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:50,619
The small one underneath your right arm.

809
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:53,019
Thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.

810
00:58:53,139 --> 00:58:55,379
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan won't mind
a few wrinkles.

811
00:58:55,579 --> 00:58:58,059
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?

812
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,500
9:10.

813
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,460
9:10! He may have left
his hotel room by now.

814
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,259
I'll call him for you as soon
as we get inside the station.

815
00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:06,699
Thank you. I can do it.

816
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:09,619
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.

817
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,619
All right. Do you know
what you'll tell him?

818
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:17,419
You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.

819
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,179
-No explanations.
-Right.

820
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:22,059
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.

821
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:25,460
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?

822
00:59:25,539 --> 00:59:27,739
I sort of had the men's room in mind.

823
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:29,259
Did you, now?

824
00:59:30,219 --> 00:59:33,579
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.

825
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:46,179
I think we made it.

826
00:59:49,899 --> 00:59:51,019
Where did he go?

827
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:53,219
-Which way did he go?
-Where did he go?

828
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:56,219
I don't know. He took my clothes.
He went up that way.

829
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:07,619
What took you so long?

830
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:10,899
I have a big face. Small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?

831
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:11,859
Yes.

832
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:13,419
Fine. What did he say?

833
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,419
He'll see you but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.

834
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,739
-He'll see you on the outside.
-Where? When?

835
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,219
-I've got it all written down for you.
-Thanks.

836
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:23,659
Take the Greyhound Bus
that leaves Chicago...

837
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:28,500
...for Indianapolis at 2:00 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41 .

838
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:31,460
Prairie Stop, Highway 41 . Good.

839
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,899
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.

840
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:35,219
Fine. I'll rent a car.

841
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:39,219
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.

842
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:42,219
All right. What'll I do when I get there?

843
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:44,659
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.

844
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:46,699
-How will I know him?
-He'll know you.

845
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:48,779
You made the Chicago papers, too.

846
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:52,619
Have you set your watch for Central time?

847
01:02:52,779 --> 01:02:54,539
Yes, I did that. Thanks.

848
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:56,819
What's the matter?

849
01:02:56,859 --> 01:02:57,619
Matter?

850
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:00,419
Yes, you seem.... I don't know.
You seem tense.

851
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,899
You better go before the police
run out of red caps.

852
01:03:03,419 --> 01:03:05,299
We'll see each other again, won't we?

853
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:07,739
Sometime, I'm sure.

854
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:11,219
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.

855
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:13,500
-Please go.
-But where will I find you?

856
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,099
I've got to pick up my bags now.

857
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,460
Yes. These are the checks
for the large cases.

858
01:03:19,539 --> 01:03:20,739
Wait a minute.

859
01:03:21,419 --> 01:03:22,419
Please.

860
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:25,139
They're coming.

861
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:43,659
-Hot day.
-I've seen worse.

862
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:48,980
Are you supposed
to be meeting someone here?

863
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:51,659
I'm waiting for the bus.
It's due any minute.

864
01:07:53,139 --> 01:07:56,379
Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich
if they live long enough.

865
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,539
Then your name isn't Kaplan?

866
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:05,179
Can't say it is, 'cause it ain't.

867
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:08,099
Here she comes. Right on time.

868
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:13,259
-That's funny.
-What?

869
01:08:13,899 --> 01:08:16,420
That plane's dusting crops
where there ain't no crops.

870
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:02,939
Get out of here! The other tank may blow!

871
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:15,059
What happened?

872
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,420
Come back!

873
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:43,979
Come back! Come back!

874
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:37,099
Could you let me have
Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?

875
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,300
Kaplan?

876
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:40,300
I think he checked out.

877
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,460
Checked out?

878
01:13:42,539 --> 01:13:45,260
That's right.
He checked out at 7:10 this morning.

879
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,779
7:10? Are you sure?

880
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:48,939
Yes. He left a forwarding address.

881
01:13:48,979 --> 01:13:51,899
Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,
Rapid City, South Dakota.

882
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:53,139
7:10?

883
01:13:54,019 --> 01:13:56,500
Then how come I got a message
from him at 9:00....

884
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:57,659
What's that?

885
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:02,220
Nothing.

886
01:14:29,139 --> 01:14:31,099
Sorry to bother you again.

887
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,220
Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.
She's in room four-something.

888
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,659
I've forgotten the number.
Would you mind?

889
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:48,139
-She's in 463.
-Yes, that's right. Thanks.

890
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:14,619
Hello.

891
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:21,819
Surprised?

892
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:23,819
Yes.

893
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,739
No getting rid of me, is there?

894
01:15:38,179 --> 01:15:39,859
I could use a drink.

895
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,899
I have some scotch.

896
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,619
With water. No ice.

897
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,779
Two Die As Crop-Duster Plane Crashes
Craft Hits Oil Tanker, Drivers Escape

898
01:15:53,139 --> 01:15:54,859
How did it go today?

899
01:15:58,019 --> 01:15:59,899
The meeting with Kaplan?

900
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:03,500
He didn't show up.

901
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:07,420
It's funny, isn't it?

902
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,139
Why funny?

903
01:16:09,779 --> 01:16:13,899
After all those explicit directions
he gave you on the phone.

904
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,099
Maybe I copied them down wrong.

905
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:21,460
I don't think you got them wrong.
I think you sent me to the right place.

906
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,300
Why don't you call him back again
and see what happened?

907
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,300
I did. He checked out.
Went to South Dakota.

908
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,619
South Dakota?

909
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:34,420
Rapid City.

910
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,939
What are you going to do next?

911
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:40,420
I haven't made my mind up yet.

912
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:42,539
It may depend on you.

913
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,099
On me?

914
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,460
Sure.

915
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:49,699
You're my little helper, aren't you?

916
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:51,019
Thank you.

917
01:16:51,099 --> 01:16:54,380
To us. To a long and lasting friendship.

918
01:16:55,019 --> 01:16:59,260
Meaning, from now on, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.

919
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,380
-I'm afraid you'll have to.
-Oh, no.

920
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:06,539
I do have plans of my own, you know.
And you do have problems.

921
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,739
Wouldn't it be nice if my problems
and your plans were somehow connected?

922
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:14,500
Then we could always stay close
to each other...

923
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:18,779
...and not have to go in separate directions.
Togetherness. You know what I mean?

924
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,539
Go ahead, it can't be for me.

925
01:17:35,779 --> 01:17:37,500
No, not yet. I'm not ready.

926
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,539
What time?

927
01:17:40,179 --> 01:17:42,380
I'll meet you. What's the address?

928
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:47,059
Yes. Goodbye.

929
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,380
Business?

930
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:52,539
Yes.

931
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:54,819
Industrial designing business?

932
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,979
All work and no play.

933
01:18:00,579 --> 01:18:05,139
You should be enjoying yourself tonight
instead of taking phone calls from clients.

934
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:09,260
What about having dinner with me?

935
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,579
You can't afford to be seen anyplace.

936
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:14,019
Let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.

937
01:18:14,099 --> 01:18:15,179
No, l....

938
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,420
I can't.

939
01:18:19,019 --> 01:18:20,139
I insist.

940
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:24,420
I want you to do a favor for me.

941
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:26,939
-A big, big favor.
-Name it.

942
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:29,899
I want you to leave right now.

943
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:33,099
Stay far away from me
and don't come near me again.

944
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,099
We're not going to get involved.

945
01:18:38,739 --> 01:18:41,220
Last night was last night
and that's all there was.

946
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:44,979
That's all there is. There won't be
anything more between us.

947
01:18:45,619 --> 01:18:46,819
So, please....

948
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,420
Goodbye.

949
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,420
Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.

950
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:52,899
Right away?

951
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,300
Yes.

952
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:56,300
No questions asked?

953
01:18:56,859 --> 01:18:57,659
Yes.

954
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,460
I can't do that.

955
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:01,619
Please.

956
01:19:02,139 --> 01:19:03,059
After dinner.

957
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,139
Now.

958
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,859
After dinner. Fair is fair.

959
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,539
All right.

960
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,579
On one condition.

961
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:16,340
That you let the hotel valet
do something with this suit first.

962
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,739
You belong in the stockyards
looking like that.

963
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:19,739
Okay.

964
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,859
There's the phone.

965
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:29,819
Valet service, please.

966
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,260
-Where are we?
-463.

967
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:41,139
Room 463.

968
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:44,260
How quickly can you get a suit
sponged and pressed?

969
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,380
Yes, fast.

970
01:19:46,099 --> 01:19:47,979
20 minutes? Fine.

971
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,659
Okay. 463.

972
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:54,340
He'll be right up.

973
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,579
Better take your things off.

974
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,659
Now, what could a man do
with his clothes off for 20 minutes?

975
01:20:02,739 --> 01:20:04,300
Couldn't he have taken an hour?

976
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,500
You could always take a cold shower.

977
01:20:06,579 --> 01:20:07,739
That's right.

978
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:12,340
When I was a little boy,
I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.

979
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,699
You're a big boy now.

980
01:20:18,139 --> 01:20:21,819
Tell me, how does a girl like you
get to be a girl like you?

981
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,340
Lucky, I guess.

982
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,659
Not lucky. Naughty. Wicked.
Up to no good.

983
01:20:28,059 --> 01:20:29,099
Ever kill anyone?

984
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,939
Because I bet you could tease a man
to death without half trying.

985
01:20:34,019 --> 01:20:35,420
So, stop trying.

986
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:47,340
Be with you in a minute.

987
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,619
Trousers, please.

988
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:02,220
Thank you.

989
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:05,939
Think I'll take that cold shower after all.

990
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:07,139
Good.

991
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,260
1212 N. MICHIGAN

992
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,819
This magnificent pair
of Louis Seize Fauteuils.

993
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:21,340
Original gilt finish.
Upholstered in pure silk damask.

994
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:24,460
How much may I say to start?
What am I bid?

995
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,019
-$100.
-$100 is bid. Thank you.

996
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,460
$150 is bid here. Say to $200?

997
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:31,220
Thank you. $200 is bid.

998
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,539
Say to $300? I have $300.

999
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,059
$400 by the little lady.

1000
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,300
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,819
$450 is bid for the pair. Can I hear $500?

1002
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:41,260
Will you say $500?

1003
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,059
Can I say the $500?

1004
01:22:43,579 --> 01:22:45,340
Fair warning and last call.

1005
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,819
Sold to Mr. Stone, second row. $450.

1006
01:22:53,859 --> 01:22:55,340
Lot number 103.

1007
01:22:56,779 --> 01:22:58,539
This lovely Aubusson settee.

1008
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:02,099
In excellent condition.
Please start the bidding.

1009
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:03,859
How much?

1010
01:23:04,659 --> 01:23:08,099
$800 is offered, thank you.
$800 is bid. Say the nine? Go $900.

1011
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,300
$900 is bid.

1012
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,019
Now who'll say $1,000?

1013
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,500
$1,000, thank you.

1014
01:23:12,579 --> 01:23:14,500
$1,000 at $1,000. Say $1,100.

1015
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:17,139
Can I hear $1,100? Selling at $1,000.

1016
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,019
The three of you together.

1017
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:22,099
Now, that's a picture
only Charles Addams could draw.

1018
01:23:22,179 --> 01:23:23,659
Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.

1019
01:23:23,739 --> 01:23:26,939
Before we start calling each other names,
you'd better tell me yours.

1020
01:23:27,019 --> 01:23:29,579
-I haven't had the pleasure.
-You disappoint me, sir.

1021
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,340
I was just going to say that to her.

1022
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:35,260
I've always understood you were
a shrewd fellow at your job.

1023
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:38,099
What possessed you to come
blundering in here like this?

1024
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:40,220
Could it be an overpowering
interest in art?

1025
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:42,380
Yes. The art of survival.

1026
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,420
Have you poured any good drunks lately?

1027
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:49,460
He followed me here from the hotel.

1028
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,899
He was in your room?

1029
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,579
Sure, isn't everybody?

1030
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:56,500
$150. Thank you. Now, say the two.

1031
01:23:56,659 --> 01:23:57,699
Do I hear two?

1032
01:23:57,779 --> 01:23:58,939
$200, thank you.

1033
01:23:59,019 --> 01:24:01,739
Now the three. Do I hear three?
$300, anyone?

1034
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:02,859
$300. Thank you.

1035
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:05,220
Now, the four. Do I hear four?
$400, anyone?

1036
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:06,899
$400 is bid.

1037
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:08,979
Say the five. I have $400.

1038
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:13,500
I didn't realize you were an art collector.
I thought you just collected corpses.

1039
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:15,699
$500.

1040
01:24:16,179 --> 01:24:17,420
$500. Thank you.

1041
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,619
I'll bet you paid plenty
for this little piece of sculpture.

1042
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,019
$700.

1043
01:24:23,139 --> 01:24:25,460
She's worth every dollar of it,
take it from me.

1044
01:24:26,539 --> 01:24:28,619
She puts her heart into her work.

1045
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,420
In fact her whole body.

1046
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:33,059
Sold to Mr. Vandamm at $700.

1047
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:37,539
Oh, Mr. Vandamm.

1048
01:24:38,779 --> 01:24:43,579
Has anyone told you that you overplay
your various roles rather severely?

1049
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:46,380
First, you're the outraged
Madison Avenue man...

1050
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,819
...who claims he's been mistaken
for someone else.

1051
01:24:48,859 --> 01:24:50,420
Then, you play the fugitive...

1052
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,099
...trying to clear his name of a crime
he didn't commit.

1053
01:24:53,979 --> 01:24:56,300
Now you play the peevish lover...

1054
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,220
...stung by jealousy and betrayal.

1055
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,179
It seems you fellows could stand
less training from the FBI...

1056
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,099
...and more from the Actors' Studio.

1057
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:08,779
Apparently, the only performance
that will satisfy you is when I play dead.

1058
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,500
Your very next role.
You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.

1059
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:15,579
Thank you. $375 is bid.

1060
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:17,420
I have $375, go to $400.

1061
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,699
$375, go four?

1062
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,179
$400 is bid.

1063
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:24,059
I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter
is next on the program.

1064
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,979
Am I to be dropped
into a vat of molten steel...

1065
01:25:27,059 --> 01:25:29,300
...and become part of a new skyscraper?

1066
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:33,859
Or are you going to ask this female
to kiss me again and poison me to death?

1067
01:25:36,859 --> 01:25:40,099
Who are you kidding?
You have no feelings to hurt.

1068
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:50,059
We've had just about enough of you.

1069
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:52,139
Then, why don't you send for the police?

1070
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:57,460
That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?
Me in the hands of the police.

1071
01:25:57,539 --> 01:25:59,340
There's something I might tell them.

1072
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,059
That's why you had her hustle me
on the train last night.

1073
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:06,019
Something tells me I've got a better
chance of survival if I go to the police.

1074
01:26:07,539 --> 01:26:10,260
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't think it wasn't nice.

1075
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:14,340
$1,200 there. $1,200 is bid. Say $1,300?

1076
01:26:14,579 --> 01:26:16,300
May I hear $1,300?

1077
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:19,179
They're selling at $1,200.
Do I hear $1,300, please?

1078
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,380
Last call.

1079
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:24,819
Sold. $1,200. Thank you.

1080
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:33,260
Catalogue number 109.

1081
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:37,659
This superb example
of this early 17th century master.

1082
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,460
It will enhance any collection of fine art.

1083
01:26:41,179 --> 01:26:43,460
What is your pleasure?
How much to start?

1084
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:45,779
$1,000.

1085
01:26:46,099 --> 01:26:47,380
$1,000 is bid.

1086
01:26:48,019 --> 01:26:49,939
$1,250 I have. Now $1,500.

1087
01:26:51,619 --> 01:26:53,260
$1,500 is bid. Thank you.

1088
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,380
$1,750?

1089
01:26:56,179 --> 01:26:57,500
I have $1,750.

1090
01:26:57,619 --> 01:26:58,539
$2,000.

1091
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:01,899
$2,000 is bid. I have $2,000.
Do I hear $2,500?

1092
01:27:03,099 --> 01:27:04,380
$2,500, anyone?

1093
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,340
$2,250 once.

1094
01:27:07,899 --> 01:27:09,139
$2,250 twice.

1095
01:27:09,779 --> 01:27:10,859
Last call.

1096
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,019
$1,500.

1097
01:27:13,539 --> 01:27:15,819
But the bid is already up to $2,250, sir.

1098
01:27:15,859 --> 01:27:17,300
I still say $1,500.

1099
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:21,420
I have $2,250.

1100
01:27:21,939 --> 01:27:23,340
Do I hear $2,500?

1101
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:26,059
$2,250 once, $2,250 twice.

1102
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,340
$1,200.

1103
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,500
Sold for $2,250. And now--

1104
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,539
$2,250, for that chromo?

1105
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,380
Number 1 10 in the catalogue.

1106
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:41,579
A Louis Quinze carved
and gilded lit de repos.

1107
01:27:42,099 --> 01:27:44,779
Would somebody start the bidding
at $750, please?

1108
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:47,939
How do we know it's not a fake?
It looks like a fake.

1109
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:54,859
One thing we know. You're no fake.
You're a genuine idiot.

1110
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,179
Thank you.

1111
01:27:56,979 --> 01:27:58,380
I wonder if I could...

1112
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:01,579
...ask the gentleman to get into the spirit
of the proceedings.

1113
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:03,340
All right. I'll start it at $800.

1114
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,579
$800. Thank you.

1115
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:06,939
$900?

1116
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:09,500
$1,000 is bid. Go $1,200.

1117
01:28:09,939 --> 01:28:10,699
$1,100.

1118
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:13,300
$1,100 is bid. Thank you. Go $1,200.

1119
01:28:14,059 --> 01:28:15,139
I have $1,100.

1120
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,939
Go $1,200. Who'll say $1,200?

1121
01:28:17,579 --> 01:28:19,500
$1,100 once. Who'll say $1,200?

1122
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:20,819
$1,100 twice.

1123
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:22,260
$1,200. Thank you.

1124
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,420
$1,200 is bid. I have $1,200. Go $1,300.

1125
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,739
Who'll say $1,300?

1126
01:28:25,779 --> 01:28:26,739
$13.

1127
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,659
You mean $1,300, sir.

1128
01:28:32,179 --> 01:28:34,460
No, I mean $13.
That's more than it's worth.

1129
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,699
I have $1,200.

1130
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:41,779
Go $1,300. Who'll say $1,300?

1131
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:44,340
Who'll say $1,250?

1132
01:28:46,899 --> 01:28:48,099
$1,200 once.

1133
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:49,179
$1,200 twice.

1134
01:28:49,779 --> 01:28:51,300
Last call. $1,200.

1135
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:52,340
$2,000.

1136
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,380
$2,000?

1137
01:28:58,579 --> 01:28:59,340
$2,100.

1138
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:02,179
I'm sorry, but we can't--

1139
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,619
Make it $2,500.

1140
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:11,300
Would the gentleman please cooperate?

1141
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,779
The last bid was $1,200.

1142
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,380
$2,500. My money is as good
as anybody's.

1143
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:18,699
I have--

1144
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,979
-What was it?
-$1,200.

1145
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:24,619
I have $1,200 once, $1,200 twice--

1146
01:29:24,979 --> 01:29:25,939
$3,000.

1147
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:27,019
Sold for $1,200.

1148
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,619
-I won't let you get away with that.
-You'd better leave, sir.

1149
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:35,739
Take your hands off me or I'll sue you.

1150
01:29:50,019 --> 01:29:52,380
-What took you so long?
-Let's take a little walk.

1151
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,300
Get moving.

1152
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:56,179
I haven't finished bidding yet.
$3,000. I bid $3,000.

1153
01:29:57,099 --> 01:29:59,500
I'm sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying.

1154
01:30:01,019 --> 01:30:02,340
Not so rough!

1155
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:12,619
-Handle with care, fellas.
-In there.

1156
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:14,380
-I'm valuable property.
-In.

1157
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:22,380
I want to thank you for saving my life.
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

1158
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,340
Save it for the stationhouse.

1159
01:30:28,859 --> 01:30:31,340
Let's have some smiles and good cheer.

1160
01:30:31,539 --> 01:30:34,179
You're about to become heroes.
Don't you know who I am?

1161
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,099
We'll find out as soon as we book you
for being drunk and disorderly.

1162
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,500
That's chicken feed. You've hit the jackpot.

1163
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:45,979
"Chicago police capture
United Nations killer."

1164
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,019
My name is Roger Thornhill.

1165
01:30:49,539 --> 01:30:50,460
Here.

1166
01:30:54,059 --> 01:30:56,659
-It's him.
-That's right. Congratulations.

1167
01:30:58,899 --> 01:31:01,019
This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm.

1168
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:05,139
We've got a man here who answers
to the description of Thornhill, Roger.

1169
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:07,019
Code 76.

1170
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,179
Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID.

1171
01:31:11,739 --> 01:31:13,260
Absolutely. No question.

1172
01:31:14,979 --> 01:31:17,939
Michigan Avenue. Proceeding north
to 42nd precinct.

1173
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:22,179
What?

1174
01:31:24,139 --> 01:31:24,979
Come again!

1175
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,619
Are you sure?

1176
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:31,380
Okay. Right.

1177
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:33,099
Yeah, I got it.

1178
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,979
1055, off and clear.

1179
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:39,539
-Where are we going?
-The airport.

1180
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:41,899
-For what?
-Orders.

1181
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:46,819
Airport? I'm not going to any airport.
I want to be taken to police headquarters.

1182
01:31:47,059 --> 01:31:48,139
You do, huh?

1183
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:50,500
Why do you think I sent for you?

1184
01:31:50,579 --> 01:31:53,059
How about this guy? He sent for us!

1185
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,260
Sit back!

1186
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,059
Didn't you hear? I want to be taken
to police headquarters.

1187
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:00,019
I'm a dangerous assassin.
I'm a mad killer on the loose!

1188
01:32:00,099 --> 01:32:02,220
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1189
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:17,699
NORTHWEST

1190
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:28,819
They said right here.

1191
01:32:28,899 --> 01:32:31,979
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.

1192
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:45,779
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.

1193
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,779
All right, men. Thank you.

1194
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:51,139
This way, Mr. Thornhill.
We haven't got much time.

1195
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:53,260
This way is more private.

1196
01:32:57,019 --> 01:32:58,699
I don't think I caught your name.

1197
01:32:58,899 --> 01:33:00,619
I don't think I pitched it.

1198
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,619
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?

1199
01:33:04,019 --> 01:33:07,579
FBI, CIA, ONI.
We're all in the same alphabet soup.

1200
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:12,300
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.

1201
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,220
-We know that.
-You know it?

1202
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,059
Then why did you let the police
chase me all over the map?

1203
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:20,739
We never interfere with the police
unless absolutely necessary.

1204
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,899
It has become necessary.

1205
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:25,739
Then, I take it I'm to be cleared.

1206
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:28,779
I wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.

1207
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:31,019
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?

1208
01:33:31,059 --> 01:33:33,019
Rapid City, South Dakota.

1209
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,179
Rapid City? What for?

1210
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:36,819
It's near Mt. Rushmore.

1211
01:33:36,899 --> 01:33:38,859
No, thank you. I've seen Mt. Rushmore.

1212
01:33:38,899 --> 01:33:40,819
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.

1213
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:42,859
Vandamm?

1214
01:33:43,539 --> 01:33:45,260
A rather formidable gentleman.

1215
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,659
What about that treacherous
little tramp with him?

1216
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:49,899
Miss Kendall?

1217
01:33:50,099 --> 01:33:52,260
His mistress. We know all about her.

1218
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:55,739
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?

1219
01:33:55,819 --> 01:33:58,539
You could say he's a sort
of importer-exporter.

1220
01:33:58,779 --> 01:33:59,779
Of what?

1221
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,939
Government secrets, perhaps.

1222
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,099
Then why don't you grab him?

1223
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:08,019
There's still too much we don't know
about his organization.

1224
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:11,619
I see. What's all this got to do
with Mt. Rushmore?

1225
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,139
Vandamm has a place near there.

1226
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:17,539
We think it's his jumping-off point
to leave the country tomorrow night.

1227
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:19,939
-Are you going to stop him?
-No.

1228
01:34:20,019 --> 01:34:21,420
Then why are we going there?

1229
01:34:21,939 --> 01:34:23,979
To set his mind at ease
about George Kaplan.

1230
01:34:25,579 --> 01:34:26,699
Oh, you, huh?

1231
01:34:26,739 --> 01:34:28,539
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?

1232
01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:31,260
There is no such person as George Kaplan.

1233
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,579
What do you mean? I've been in his room.

1234
01:34:33,619 --> 01:34:36,500
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff!

1235
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:38,500
Believe me, he doesn't exist.

1236
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:43,819
Which is why I'm going to have to ask you
to go on being him for the next 24 hours.

1237
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,539
Come on! We'll discuss it on the plane.

1238
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:12,139
You started the decoy business
without me, you finish it without me!

1239
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,380
We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

1240
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:18,099
You should give me a medal and a vacation
instead of asking me to be a target...

1241
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:20,859
...just so your special agent
doesn't get shot at!

1242
01:35:21,139 --> 01:35:23,380
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.

1243
01:35:23,659 --> 01:35:25,899
Once found out they're as good as dead.

1244
01:35:26,139 --> 01:35:29,300
Thanks to you,
clouds of suspicion are already forming.

1245
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:31,179
Thanks to me?

1246
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:33,899
You listen to me.

1247
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:36,340
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring!

1248
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,500
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

1249
01:35:38,579 --> 01:35:41,380
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

1250
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,460
...and I don't intend to disappoint them
by getting myself killed!

1251
01:35:44,979 --> 01:35:46,300
The answer is no.

1252
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:48,619
-Is that final?
-Yes.

1253
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,099
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

1254
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,979
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall...

1255
01:35:55,859 --> 01:35:57,779
...of whom you so obviously disapprove.

1256
01:35:57,859 --> 01:36:01,300
Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly-swatter.

1257
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:03,619
I suppose it doesn't matter to you...

1258
01:36:03,699 --> 01:36:07,579
...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

1259
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:09,979
To protect herself from what?

1260
01:36:10,059 --> 01:36:12,139
Exposure, assassination.

1261
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:15,859
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she's....

1262
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,340
She's one of our agents.

1263
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:20,260
Oh, no!

1264
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,899
I know you didn't mean it...

1265
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:25,779
...but I'm afraid you have put her
in an extremely dangerous situation.

1266
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:29,859
And much more than her life is at stake.

1267
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:45,220
Suppose they don't come?

1268
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:47,019
They'll come.

1269
01:36:48,579 --> 01:36:51,659
I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt
is looking at me.

1270
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:55,699
Perhaps he's trying to give you
one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

1271
01:36:55,739 --> 01:36:57,699
"Speak softly, and carry a big stick."

1272
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:01,619
He's trying to tell me not to go through
with this harebrained scheme.

1273
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:05,059
He doesn't know to what extent
you are the cause of our present trouble.

1274
01:37:05,139 --> 01:37:07,619
I don't know that I care
to accept that charge.

1275
01:37:07,899 --> 01:37:12,539
If you hadn't made yourself so attractive
to Miss Kendall that she fell for you...

1276
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:13,739
And vice versa.

1277
01:37:13,779 --> 01:37:16,939
...our friend Vandamm wouldn't be
losing faith in her loyalty now.

1278
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:21,179
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

1279
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,779
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

1280
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:27,979
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

1281
01:37:28,019 --> 01:37:30,539
I'm trying to remind you
that it's your responsibility...

1282
01:37:30,619 --> 01:37:33,179
...to help us restore her
to Vandamm's good graces...

1283
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:35,260
...until he leaves the country tonight.

1284
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:37,300
All right, all right.

1285
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:39,380
But, after tonight....

1286
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:42,260
My blessings on you both!

1287
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,220
Here they are!

1288
01:38:49,099 --> 01:38:50,500
Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.

1289
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:51,539
Not her!

1290
01:39:00,739 --> 01:39:03,420
Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

1291
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,619
We'll get to that later.

1292
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:08,500
I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

1293
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:12,179
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

1294
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:15,340
By the way, I want to compliment you
on your colorful exit...

1295
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,300
...from the auction gallery.

1296
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:18,779
Thank you.

1297
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:21,779
And now what little drama
are we here for today?

1298
01:39:21,859 --> 01:39:25,579
I don't for a moment believe that
you invited me to these gay surroundings...

1299
01:39:25,619 --> 01:39:27,819
...to come to a business arrangement.

1300
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:33,460
Suppose I tell you that I not only know
when you're leaving the country tonight...

1301
01:39:33,539 --> 01:39:35,979
...but the latitude and longitude
of your rendezvous...

1302
01:39:36,059 --> 01:39:38,059
...and your ultimate destination.

1303
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,019
You wouldn't care to carry my bags,
would you?

1304
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:44,260
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

1305
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,500
The price?

1306
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:47,500
For doing nothing to stop you.

1307
01:39:49,059 --> 01:39:51,260
How much did you have in mind?

1308
01:39:51,859 --> 01:39:52,939
I want the girl.

1309
01:39:55,779 --> 01:39:57,739
I want her to get what's coming to her.

1310
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:02,179
Turn her over to me. I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

1311
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:04,300
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.

1312
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,260
You do that,
and I'll look the other way tonight.

1313
01:40:08,779 --> 01:40:10,659
She really did get under your skin.

1314
01:40:11,019 --> 01:40:13,779
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.

1315
01:40:13,819 --> 01:40:17,019
-I'm offering you a chance to save it.
-To exchange it!

1316
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:19,579
Put it any way you like.

1317
01:40:20,059 --> 01:40:22,019
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.

1318
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:26,659
What made you think that my feelings
for her may have deteriorated...

1319
01:40:26,739 --> 01:40:29,939
...to the point where I would trade her in
for a little peace of mind?

1320
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,619
I don't deduce.

1321
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:33,899
I observe.

1322
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:39,659
Phillip, if you don't mind,
I'm going back to the house now.

1323
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:52,779
Just a second, you.

1324
01:40:52,819 --> 01:40:55,619
Stay away from me! Let go!
Let go of me!

1325
01:40:56,659 --> 01:40:58,579
Stay away from me! Let go!

1326
01:40:58,739 --> 01:40:59,939
Let go of me!

1327
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,899
Save the phony tears.

1328
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:03,380
You just get back.

1329
01:41:05,539 --> 01:41:06,579
You little fool!

1330
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:08,380
You just stay away from me.

1331
01:41:13,779 --> 01:41:15,899
No good. You can't get involved in this.

1332
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:22,300
-Don't touch anything.
-Stand back.

1333
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:23,500
Stand back.

1334
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:23,500
Don't be long.

1335
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:28,260
Hello.

1336
01:42:29,539 --> 01:42:30,539
Hello.

1337
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:32,659
Are you all right?

1338
01:42:33,859 --> 01:42:35,340
Yes, I think so.

1339
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:38,500
I asked the Professor
if I could see you again.

1340
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:42,659
There's not much time.

1341
01:42:44,059 --> 01:42:45,340
Isn't there?

1342
01:42:46,179 --> 01:42:48,019
I wanted to tell you....

1343
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,779
I mean, apologize.

1344
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,260
No need.

1345
01:42:53,619 --> 01:42:54,899
I understand.

1346
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,859
All in the line of duty.

1347
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:02,380
I did treat you miserably.

1348
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,139
I hated you for it.

1349
01:43:06,859 --> 01:43:08,819
I didn't want you to go on thinking....

1350
01:43:11,539 --> 01:43:13,899
I used some pretty harsh words, I'm sorry.

1351
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,899
-They hurt deeply.
-Naturally, if I'd known....

1352
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,859
I couldn't tell you.

1353
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:21,019
-Of course not.
-Could l?

1354
01:43:22,819 --> 01:43:24,139
No, I guess not.

1355
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:28,300
You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.

1356
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:30,260
Of course I was. How would you have felt?

1357
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:33,619
I mean in the cafeteria, when you fell.
When I shot you with the blanks.

1358
01:43:33,699 --> 01:43:35,139
Oh, that. No.

1359
01:43:36,019 --> 01:43:37,899
You did it rather well, I thought.

1360
01:43:37,939 --> 01:43:40,139
Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

1361
01:43:40,699 --> 01:43:43,179
Considering it's not really
your kind of work.

1362
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:47,739
No, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

1363
01:43:49,899 --> 01:43:53,579
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

1364
01:43:56,899 --> 01:43:59,699
I guess I had nothing to do that weekend...

1365
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:01,939
...so I decided to fall in love.

1366
01:44:02,539 --> 01:44:03,819
That's nice.

1367
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:09,380
Eventually, the Professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

1368
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:14,380
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

1369
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:19,139
...my relationship with him
made me "uniquely valuable" to them.

1370
01:44:20,779 --> 01:44:22,699
So you became a Girl Scout?

1371
01:44:23,899 --> 01:44:27,059
It was the first time anyone ever asked me
to do anything worthwhile.

1372
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:30,699
Has life been like that?

1373
01:44:33,819 --> 01:44:34,619
How come?

1374
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,460
Men like you.

1375
01:44:40,059 --> 01:44:42,260
What's wrong with men like me?

1376
01:44:42,539 --> 01:44:44,739
They don't believe in marriage.

1377
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:46,539
I've been married twice.

1378
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:47,859
See what I mean?

1379
01:44:50,019 --> 01:44:52,619
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.

1380
01:44:59,179 --> 01:45:00,699
Goodbye, darling.

1381
01:45:02,019 --> 01:45:03,139
Wait. Not so soon.

1382
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,260
I must get back and convince them...

1383
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:08,220
...that I took the long way
so nobody would follow me.

1384
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:12,460
Couldn't we stand like this
for just a few hours?

1385
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,979
Just this time you're supposed
to be critically wounded!

1386
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:16,659
I never felt more alive.

1387
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:18,260
Whose side are you on?

1388
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,739
Yours, always, darling.

1389
01:45:21,819 --> 01:45:25,220
Please don't undermine my resolve,
just when I need it most.

1390
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:37,139
I guess it's off to the hospital for me
and back to danger for you.

1391
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:38,979
I don't like it a bit.

1392
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:42,579
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

1393
01:45:43,139 --> 01:45:45,260
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

1394
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,939
All right. I won't.

1395
01:45:47,019 --> 01:45:50,099
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

1396
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:54,220
...we'll get together and do a lot of
apologizing to each other, in private.

1397
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:55,819
You know that can't be.

1398
01:45:55,859 --> 01:45:57,579
Of course it can be!

1399
01:46:00,699 --> 01:46:02,699
He has told you, hasn't he?

1400
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,380
Told me what?

1401
01:46:04,979 --> 01:46:06,380
You've got to get moving.

1402
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,420
-What didn't you tell me?
-Why didn't you?

1403
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:13,139
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

1404
01:46:15,099 --> 01:46:16,619
She's going off with Vandamm?

1405
01:46:16,659 --> 01:46:19,939
That's why we went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

1406
01:46:20,019 --> 01:46:22,739
So that Vandamm couldn't decline
to take her along.

1407
01:46:22,899 --> 01:46:25,699
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

1408
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,579
You lied to me!
You said that after tonight--

1409
01:46:28,779 --> 01:46:29,939
I needed your help.

1410
01:46:30,019 --> 01:46:31,260
You got it, all right.

1411
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,500
Don't be angry.

1412
01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:35,380
-You think I'll let you go through with this?
-She has to.

1413
01:46:35,699 --> 01:46:37,460
Nobody has to do anything!

1414
01:46:37,619 --> 01:46:39,539
I don't like the games you play!

1415
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,260
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

1416
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:46,460
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

1417
01:46:46,899 --> 01:46:49,699
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

1418
01:46:49,899 --> 01:46:51,500
...and probably never come back...

1419
01:46:51,579 --> 01:46:54,220
...perhaps you should learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

1420
01:46:54,819 --> 01:46:56,220
We're already doing that.

1421
01:47:03,579 --> 01:47:07,139
-I won't let you do this. Get out.
-Please don't spoil everything.

1422
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:16,500
...shot Mr. Kaplan twice in full view
of horrified men, women and children...

1423
01:47:16,579 --> 01:47:19,819
...who had come to the park
to see the famed Mt. Rushmore monument.

1424
01:47:19,859 --> 01:47:25,260
Witnesses described the assailant as
an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

1425
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:29,139
Kaplan, who was taken to the hospital
in critical condition...

1426
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:33,139
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

1427
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:35,699
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

1428
01:47:35,779 --> 01:47:38,819
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria...

1429
01:47:38,899 --> 01:47:41,739
...stated that he heard voices raised in--

1430
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:48,699
Here we are.

1431
01:47:49,739 --> 01:47:51,979
Slacks, a shirt and these.

1432
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,659
Thanks.

1433
01:47:53,739 --> 01:47:56,859
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

1434
01:47:57,819 --> 01:47:59,699
The next couple of days?

1435
01:48:00,859 --> 01:48:02,260
Hey, what's this?

1436
01:48:02,939 --> 01:48:06,059
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

1437
01:48:06,099 --> 01:48:08,420
You and your dopey schemes. Shooting.

1438
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:11,340
-Otherwise, feeling all right?
-Oh, yes. Fine.

1439
01:48:12,179 --> 01:48:15,260
Considering your driver has
a sledgehammer for a hand.

1440
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,179
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1441
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,779
That's all right. I guess I deserved it.

1442
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,739
I guess I deserve that locked door, too.

1443
01:48:22,819 --> 01:48:26,500
If you were seen wandering about healthy,
it could prove fatal to Miss Kendall.

1444
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:30,059
-I've begun to forget her already.
-Good.

1445
01:48:30,579 --> 01:48:32,659
-Better that way.
-Yeah, much.

1446
01:48:33,099 --> 01:48:35,179
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

1447
01:48:38,099 --> 01:48:39,899
How's everything out in Rapid City?

1448
01:48:39,979 --> 01:48:41,579
Everything's fine.

1449
01:48:41,939 --> 01:48:45,619
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has
acquired the authority of the printed word.

1450
01:48:46,099 --> 01:48:48,420
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

1451
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,819
Now you can include me.

1452
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,579
-I'm a cooperator.
-I'm most grateful.

1453
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:56,220
-Care to do me a favor in return?
-Anything.

1454
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,899
I'd like a drink.
Will you get me some bourbon?

1455
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:00,619
A pint will do.

1456
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:02,539
Can I join you?

1457
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:05,739
If you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

1458
01:49:05,779 --> 01:49:07,460
See you in a few minutes.

1459
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:11,739
-Stop!
-Excuse me.

1460
01:50:12,979 --> 01:50:13,939
Stop.

1461
01:50:37,139 --> 01:50:41,059
-Don't you want me to take you up there?
-No, thanks. Never mind. This is fine.

1462
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,420
-There's nothing to worry about.
-I just lost my head.

1463
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:25,659
I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

1464
01:53:25,819 --> 01:53:26,979
I mean it.

1465
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,420
I just didn't know what I was doing.

1466
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:32,019
He wants to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

1467
01:53:32,099 --> 01:53:33,539
But not endanger you!

1468
01:53:33,619 --> 01:53:34,539
Rubbish.

1469
01:53:35,099 --> 01:53:38,939
Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

1470
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,340
What's the situation, Leonard?

1471
01:53:42,579 --> 01:53:44,739
-About the plane, you mean?
-Of course.

1472
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:46,340
What was the last report?

1473
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:49,420
Over Whitestone on the hour.
6,000. Descending.

1474
01:53:49,659 --> 01:53:51,659
-About ten minutes?
-At the most.

1475
01:53:52,699 --> 01:53:53,739
And now....

1476
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,340
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

1477
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:58,579
Certainly.

1478
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:00,619
In private?

1479
01:54:02,059 --> 01:54:03,220
I'll get my things.

1480
01:54:05,779 --> 01:54:07,460
How does one say goodbye...

1481
01:54:07,779 --> 01:54:09,260
...to one's right arm?

1482
01:54:15,699 --> 01:54:18,139
In your case,
you'll wish you had cut it off sooner.

1483
01:54:22,699 --> 01:54:24,859
I know you're terribly fond
of Miss Kendall....

1484
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:10,340
It couldn't have been anything.

1485
01:55:13,579 --> 01:55:16,139
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

1486
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:18,579
And still do.

1487
01:55:18,899 --> 01:55:19,979
Rubbish.

1488
01:55:20,579 --> 01:55:23,019
Why else would you've decided
not to tell her that...

1489
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,899
...our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

1490
01:55:25,979 --> 01:55:28,500
You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

1491
01:55:28,579 --> 01:55:31,179
Sometimes the truth does taste
like worms.

1492
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:33,059
I've heard nothing but innuendoes.

1493
01:55:33,139 --> 01:55:36,699
Call it my "woman's intuition" if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

1494
01:55:36,779 --> 01:55:39,220
Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

1495
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,659
She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

1496
01:55:41,819 --> 01:55:43,619
You were there, you saw it yourself.

1497
01:55:43,859 --> 01:55:44,739
Yes.

1498
01:55:46,979 --> 01:55:50,899
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

1499
01:55:53,059 --> 01:55:55,779
A: She removed any doubts
you may have had about her.

1500
01:55:55,859 --> 01:55:58,380
What did you call it? Her "devotion"?

1501
01:55:58,619 --> 01:56:02,579
B: She gave herself an urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

1502
01:56:02,659 --> 01:56:04,739
...in case you decided to change your mind.

1503
01:56:07,179 --> 01:56:08,739
I think you're jealous.

1504
01:56:08,979 --> 01:56:11,019
No, I mean it. I'm very touched.

1505
01:56:14,699 --> 01:56:15,779
Leonard!

1506
01:56:22,939 --> 01:56:24,460
The gun she shot Kaplan with.

1507
01:56:25,139 --> 01:56:26,500
I found it in her luggage.

1508
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:31,619
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own
to show that you're not one of them.

1509
01:56:32,139 --> 01:56:34,819
They've just freshened it up a bit
with blank cartridges.

1510
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,579
What was that noise?

1511
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:55,220
Yes, we wondered what it was, too.
Didn't we, Leonard?

1512
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:58,539
Hurry down, darling. It's time to leave.

1513
01:56:58,979 --> 01:56:59,939
In a moment.

1514
01:57:08,859 --> 01:57:11,220
You're not taking her on that plane
with you?

1515
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:12,380
Of course I am.

1516
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,420
Like our friends,
l, too, believe in neatness, Leonard.

1517
01:57:17,179 --> 01:57:20,300
This matter is best disposed of
from a great height...

1518
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:22,380
...over water.

1519
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,579
How about a little champagne
before we go?

1520
01:58:09,659 --> 01:58:10,939
I'd love it.

1521
01:58:11,059 --> 01:58:12,579
It may not be cold enough.

1522
01:58:12,659 --> 01:58:14,340
On the rocks it'll be all right.

1523
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,500
Are you sure?

1524
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:27,179
R.O.T.

1525
01:58:42,539 --> 01:58:44,539
They're on to you.

1526
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:51,979
I'm in your room.

1527
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,380
To you, my dear...

1528
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:32,779
...and all the lovely moments
we've had together.

1529
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:34,659
Thank you.

1530
01:59:35,699 --> 01:59:36,539
There he is.

1531
01:59:44,139 --> 01:59:46,420
Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.

1532
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:48,260
There isn't time.

1533
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:50,739
You always were a spoilsport, weren't you?

1534
01:59:51,139 --> 01:59:52,979
One of my most valuable attributes...

1535
01:59:53,139 --> 01:59:54,420
...as it now turns out.

1536
01:59:56,819 --> 02:00:00,619
It would please me if you'd think of me
as being along on this journey...

1537
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:02,779
...if only in spirit.

1538
02:00:02,939 --> 02:00:03,899
I shall.

1539
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:14,500
He's heading pretty far out
on the north flag and awfully high.

1540
02:00:15,539 --> 02:00:18,699
I guess he's going to play it safe
with a long, slow descent.

1541
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:21,939
You couldn't ask
for a better night than this.

1542
02:00:22,019 --> 02:00:24,179
Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.

1543
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:28,340
There he goes, starting his turn.

1544
02:00:29,619 --> 02:00:31,179
We'd better get moving.

1545
02:00:33,019 --> 02:00:36,260
He should have his wheels on the ground
inside of three minutes.

1546
02:00:40,099 --> 02:00:41,859
-Come along, Eve.
-All right.

1547
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:47,460
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.

1548
02:01:00,059 --> 02:01:02,619
We can go through the window.
There's a car downstairs!

1549
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:04,859
What are you doing?
You'll ruin everything!

1550
02:01:04,939 --> 02:01:07,380
They know about the fake shooting!
They'll kill you!

1551
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:08,500
What?

1552
02:01:08,619 --> 02:01:10,699
Leonard found the gun in your luggage!

1553
02:01:10,819 --> 02:01:13,899
The figure they got at the auction
is filled with microfilm!

1554
02:01:13,979 --> 02:01:16,300
That's how he's been getting it.

1555
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:19,139
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane!

1556
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:29,300
Don't worry, Anna.
Arrangements have been made.

1557
02:01:29,539 --> 02:01:32,139
You and your husband will be
in Canada by morning.

1558
02:01:32,179 --> 02:01:34,059
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Be careful.

1559
02:01:34,099 --> 02:01:34,859
We will.

1560
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:36,220
God bless you!

1561
02:02:39,059 --> 02:02:40,179
Stay where you are!

1562
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:52,260
Sit down.

1563
02:02:56,939 --> 02:03:00,139
As soon as the plane leaves,
my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.

1564
02:03:27,099 --> 02:03:28,340
What is it?

1565
02:03:29,619 --> 02:03:31,340
I was wondering about my earrings.

1566
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:32,739
They'll turn up.

1567
02:03:37,059 --> 02:03:39,939
When you return to New York,
say goodbye to my sister.

1568
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:42,500
Thank her for her performance
as Mrs. Townsend.

1569
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:46,779
Tell your knife-throwing chum
that I've reassured his wife.

1570
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:48,539
That's all, Leonard.

1571
02:04:03,779 --> 02:04:04,939
Get that figure back!

1572
02:04:11,899 --> 02:04:14,220
The housekeeper had me pinned down
for five minutes...

1573
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,579
...before I realized
it was that silly gun of yours.

1574
02:04:16,659 --> 02:04:18,380
-I see you've got the pumpkin.
-Yes.

1575
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:58,859
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.

1576
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,979
-What'll we do?
-Climb down.

1577
02:05:18,059 --> 02:05:18,979
We can't.

1578
02:05:19,099 --> 02:05:21,179
Here they come. We have no choice.

1579
02:06:08,939 --> 02:06:10,779
If we ever get out of this alive...

1580
02:06:10,859 --> 02:06:13,220
...let's go back to New York
on the train together.

1581
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:14,380
All right?

1582
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:16,380
Is that a proposition?

1583
02:06:17,619 --> 02:06:19,340
It's a proposal, sweetie.

1584
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,859
What happened to the first two marriages?

1585
02:06:23,739 --> 02:06:25,460
My wives divorced me.

1586
02:06:25,979 --> 02:06:26,779
Why?

1587
02:06:26,859 --> 02:06:29,300
I think they said I led too dull a life.

1588
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:31,179
Come on.

1589
02:06:41,139 --> 02:06:42,179
Are you all right?

1590
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:53,260
Come on.

1591
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:37,859
Help!

1592
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:39,420
Help me!

1593
02:10:09,939 --> 02:10:11,059
Thank you, Sergeant.

1594
02:10:11,139 --> 02:10:13,779
That wasn't very sporting,
using real bullets?

1595
02:10:14,059 --> 02:10:15,460
Here, reach. Now.

1596
02:10:16,659 --> 02:10:17,739
I'm trying.

1597
02:10:17,939 --> 02:10:19,179
Come on, I've got you.

1598
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:21,260
-Up!
-I can't make it!

1599
02:10:21,619 --> 02:10:22,539
Yes, you can.

1600
02:10:22,579 --> 02:10:23,340
Come on.

1601
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,260
Pull harder!

1602
02:10:24,659 --> 02:10:26,220
Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.

1603
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:31,979
Roger, this is silly.

1604
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,260
I know, but I'm sentimental.

1605
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:45,059
THE END
NORTH BY NORTHWEST
