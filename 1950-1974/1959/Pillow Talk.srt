1
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,007
Brad. Brad, darling.

2
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,402
I love you.

3
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,403
I know.

4
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,480
I just had to call you.

5
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,406
I'll never forget
last night.

6
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,650
Especially when you
sang me your new song.

7
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,328
Our song, Eileen.
I wrote it for you.

8
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,526
Oh, Brad.

9
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,363
Would you sing it
to me again?

10
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,442
Oh, now?

11
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,125
Please.

12
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,686
All right.

13
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,085
<i>You are my
inspiration, Eileen</i>

14
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,280
<i>A perfect combination,
Eileen</i>

15
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,206
<i>Your eyes, your hair,
are beyond compare</i>

16
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,120
<i>So is it any wonder?</i>

17
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>You captured me and now
I'm under your spell</i>

18
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,328
<i>Eileen</i>

19
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,883
I do hate to interrupt, but would
you mind hanging up, please?

20
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,166
Who's that?

21
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,890
The other half
of my party line.

22
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,849
Just ignore her,
she'll go away.

23
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,082
You have been on this
phone for half an hour.

24
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,764
I've got an important
call to make...

25
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,411
I happen to consider
this an important call.

26
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,006
What, singing to a girl
at 9:00 in the morning?

27
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,641
It's none of your business
what he does to me, or when.

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,844
Would you please
get off this line?

29
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,043
I know it is early,
chÃ©rie.

30
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,726
But I just had
to talk to you.

31
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,604
Will I see
you tonight?

32
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,331
Oh, I'm sorry, Yvette.
I have to work.

33
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,561
Oh.

34
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,565
I have six songs to
write for the new show.

35
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,604
But you'll have to go out
and eat dinner, no?

36
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,764
Oh, I'll throw something
together here.

37
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,729
Oh, no, darling,
you mustn't.

38
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,041
You must keep up
your strength.

39
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,565
I'll come over and cook
something for you, yes?

40
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,281
Well, if you like.

41
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,924
Thank you, darling.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,331
It's nothing.

43
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,567
Brad?

44
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,721
Mmm-hmm?

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,324
Sing me a little
of our song.

46
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,084
Yvette.

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,491
Please.

48
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,966
Would you please
get off this phone?

49
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,566
Who is that woman?

50
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,086
Some little eavesdropper
on my party line.

51
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,527
She's always
listening in.

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,689
It's how she brightens up
her drab, empty life.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,810
If I could get a call through once in
a while, my life wouldn't be so drab.

54
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,604
Must you zoom up
so fast?

55
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,321
What are you, jet-propelled
or something?

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,561
Morning, Alm.

57
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,051
The laundryman's
coming by today.

58
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,731
And would you please tidy
up the cupboards for me?

59
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,201
Oh, would you call the office and
tell them I'll be a little bit late?

60
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,045
That's a peach of a hangover
she's got this morning.

61
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,327
I'm afraid so.

62
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,244
Why does she have to go out
and get stoned every night?

63
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,881
Oh, I don't know, Harry. Maybe
she's got a party line.

64
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,681
I hope you understand,
madam,

65
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,650
that your phone company wants
everyone to have a private phone.

66
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,768
We're putting in new trunk
lines as fast as we can.

67
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,207
But with all the construction
going on, it takes time.

68
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,282
We have hundreds
of applications,

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,283
which take precedence
over yours.

70
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,806
But there must be
some way to get one.

71
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,121
Well, if some emergency arose.

72
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,810
If you were to become
pregnant, for example,

73
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,486
why, you'd jump right
to the top of our list.

74
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,804
Mr. Conrad, being single, I'm not quite
ready for that kind of emergency.

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,530
Well, I wouldn't know
what else to suggest.

76
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,921
Oh, but I'm at my
wit's end, really.

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,445
You see, I'm an
interior decorator

78
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,284
and I do a lot
of work at home,

79
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,408
and so naturally there are
business calls that I must make

80
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,130
and I cannot get
a call through.

81
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,168
That man is always on the
phone with some woman.

82
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,605
Have you any idea
what it's like

83
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,570
to be on a party line
with a sex maniac?

84
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,931
That's a very serious
charge, madam.

85
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
Can you substantiate it?

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,810
Well, he sings love songs
at 9:00 in the morning.

87
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,691
Has he used objectionable
language on the phone?

88
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,881
No.

89
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,689
Or threats of any nature?

90
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,967
No.

91
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,168
Has he made immoral
overtures to you?

92
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,444
Well. Oh, not to me.

93
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,726
And you're bothered
by this?

94
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,801
Yes.

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,449
I mean, no. What do
you mean, bothered?

96
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,000
His carrying on with all these
other women disturbs you.

97
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,686
Mr. Conrad, please believe me,
I don't care what he does,

98
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,128
I just want him to stop
doing it on my phone.

99
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,448
Well, madam, we'll have one
of our inspectors stop by

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,521
and have a talk with him.

101
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,161
Oh, thank you very much.
I'd appreciate that.

102
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,567
If what you say
about this man is true,

103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,967
we may be forced
to disconnect him.

104
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,326
Good.

105
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,763
Haven't you reached
Jan yet?

106
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,361
Keep trying.

107
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,726
If she doesn't
get here soon,

108
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,486
that woman is going to
drive me out of my mind.

109
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,203
Ming dynasty in a rumpus room.

110
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,926
Mrs. Walters, be careful.
This is priceless.

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,889
Really? What is it?

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,009
A 14th-century
crematory urn.

113
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,202
Crematory urn?

114
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,251
Is anybody in it?

115
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,890
Not at the moment.

116
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,166
That's good.

117
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,811
Then we can drill a hole in the
bottom without anyone running out.

118
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,881
A hole?

119
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,644
So we can wire it
for a lamp.

120
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,766
Mrs. Walters, we do not wire
14th-century crematory urns.

121
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,968
I suppose not.

122
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,481
Jan.

123
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,321
Jan.

124
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,564
Hello, Jonathan.

125
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,320
Hi. I've got something
to tell you.

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,050
Oh? I was trying to
call you all morning,

127
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,009
but your line's been busy.
Oh, naturally.

128
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,004
I just drove her out of the showroom.
How do you like it?

129
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,969
It's marvelous.
Like the color?

130
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,850
Oh, it's just beautiful.
The upholstery?

131
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,365
It's yours.

132
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,646
Huh?

133
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,961
In grateful appreciation
of the very brilliant job

134
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,407
you've been doing
on my office.

135
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,486
What? Jonathan.

136
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,729
Jonathan, you just don't go
around giving girls cars.

137
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
I do.

138
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,041
This your car, Mac?

139
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,004
No, it's hers.
Oh!

140
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,081
Is this your car, Miss?

141
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,486
No, it's his.

142
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,165
Jonathan. Jonathan, you're
very sweet and very generous,

143
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,129
but I cannot accept
a gift like this.

144
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,089
Why not?
But... Well, it's too...

145
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,089
It's too personal.

146
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,525
This?
Yes.

147
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,528
If I gave you perfume, if I gave you
lingerie, that would be personal.

148
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,727
But a car?

149
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,768
Come on, Mac.
If it's yours, move it.

150
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,400
Here. Send me
the perfume.

151
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,730
Will you be stopping by
my office tomorrow?

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,801
In the afternoon.

153
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,927
Listen.

154
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,167
Are you sure you
don't want the car?

155
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,208
Yes, I'm sure, Jonathan.

156
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,924
See you tomorrow.

157
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,123
My analyst will
never believe this.

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,964
Neither will mine.

159
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,523
Good morning.
Oh.

160
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,125
Mrs. Walters,
I'm sorry to be so late.

161
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,247
That's all right, dear.

162
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,881
Mr. Pierot and I had a very fruitful morning.
Didn't we, Mr. P?

163
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,961
Very fruitful.

164
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,121
Good.

165
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,884
Well, what are you
doing with that?

166
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,530
I picked it out myself.

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,364
I thought it would
go wonderfully well...

168
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,044
Mrs. Walters,
a fertility goddess

169
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,726
is the last thing
you need in Scarsdale.

170
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,203
A fertility goddess?
My dear, I had no idea.

171
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,210
Now, don't forget,
I'm expecting you both

172
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,203
at the housewarming
tomorrow evening.

173
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,248
We'll be there.

174
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,131
Savage little thing,
isn't it?

175
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,362
That woman has the taste
of a water buffalo.

176
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,006
Well, then why do
business with her?

177
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,050
Well, because she happens to
be a very rich water buffalo.

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,846
But if you ever leave me
alone with her again...

179
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,884
Where were you? I tried
to reach you all morning.

180
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,611
Oh, lover boy got started
very early today.

181
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,691
Oh, really, Jan, there must be
some way to get a private line.

182
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,641
Tell them it's an emergency.

183
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,970
Thank you, Mr. P.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,288
I've reported him
to the phone company.

185
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,289
Well, it's about time.

186
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,608
They're sending
an inspector over.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,083
As far as I'm concerned,
whatever Mr. Allen gets,

188
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,281
he has coming to him.

189
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,600
Good.

190
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,049
Mr. Allen, I'm from
the telephone company.

191
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,406
Well, hello.

192
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,606
I...

193
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,484
I'm...
Yes?

194
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,169
I'm Miss Dickenson.
I'm an inspector.

195
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,804
What would you
like to inspect?

196
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,090
You. I mean, we've received
a complaint about you.

197
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,486
Well, I've never had
any complaints before.

198
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,210
Won't you come in?

199
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,924
Why, thank you.

200
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,209
You don't have to break the
sound barrier, you hot-rodder.

201
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,761
Alm?

202
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,686
Well, I heard from
the phone company.

203
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm the one who can't get a call
through, and they sent me this.

204
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,209
Listen, "Your complaint
has been found

205
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,931
"to be completely
unwarranted and untruthful.

206
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,530
"According to our inspector,
Miss Dickenson..."

207
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
Would you believe that?
They sent a woman.

208
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,130
It's like sending a marshmallow
to put out a bonfire.

209
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,725
Here, read it for yourself.

210
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,527
You know I never get
into focus until 10:00.

211
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,360
"Our inspector found Mr. Allen
to be extremely cooperative."

212
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,681
I'll just bet he was.

213
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,324
Hello?
Miss Morrow?

214
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,808
My name is Brad Allen.

215
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,927
Yes?

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,525
I've been advised
by the phone company

217
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,728
that there's a code number
for our party line.

218
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,529
It's 793.

219
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,881
Now, if you have any
future complaints to make,

220
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,760
I suggest you dial it and
complain to me personally.

221
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,047
Why, Mr. Allen,
if I hadn't complained,

222
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,001
the inspector would never have
found out how cooperative you are.

223
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,562
Miss Morrow, why are you so
fascinated with my personal affairs?

224
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,247
I'm not fascinated,
Mr. Allen. Revolted.

225
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,409
You don't see me going
down to the phone company

226
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,925
complaining about
your affairs.

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,241
I have none to
complain about.

228
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,446
It figures.

229
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,925
What do you mean,
it figures?

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,001
Well, obviously.

231
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,606
You're a woman who lives
alone and doesn't like it.

232
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,603
I happen to like
living alone.

233
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,808
Look, I don't know
what's bothering you,

234
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
but don't take your bedroom
problems out on me.

235
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,771
I have no bedroom problems.

236
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,366
There's nothing in my
bedroom that bothers me.

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,363
Oh, well,
that's too bad.

238
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,048
Mr. Allen, let's try
to be adult about this

239
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,804
and work out some
sort of schedule

240
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,564
where I can make
my business calls

241
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,881
and you can make your...

242
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,122
Whatever you call
the calls you make.

243
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,767
Now, from the hour to the
half-hour, the phone will be yours.

244
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,650
From the half-hour to the
hour, it will be mine.

245
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,610
Should either of us receive a call
during the other's half-hour,

246
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,288
he or she will terminate the
conversation as quickly as possible.

247
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,842
In emergencies, each will
exercise a little tolerance.

248
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,804
How does that sound?

249
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,326
Like a report from
the United Nations.

250
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,524
You mean, you disagree?

251
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,284
No, it might work.

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,805
Well, I hope so.
I understand that

253
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,450
we're going to have to
share this party line

254
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,726
for at least
another month.

255
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,531
We'll just have to try
living with one another.

256
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,481
Well?

257
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,043
I was waiting for you to
make some off-color remark.

258
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,483
Miss Morrow, is that all
you have on your mind?

259
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,085
Never mind my mind.

260
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,050
You stick to your half-hour
and I'll stick to mine.

261
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,765
You know, he makes
pretty good sense.

262
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,721
Were you listening in
again?

263
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,926
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,161
Alma, have you no shame?

265
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,446
No, ma'am,
he's brightened up

266
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,000
many a dreary
afternoon for me.

267
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,003
What did he say that
made such good sense?

268
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,924
If there's anything worse
than a woman living alone,

269
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,367
it's a woman saying
she likes it.

270
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,204
Well, I do like it.

271
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,568
I have a good job, a lovely apartment,
I go out with very nice men

272
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,051
to the best places,

273
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,849
the theater,
the finest restaurants.

274
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,285
What am I missing?

275
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,961
When you have to ask,

276
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,327
believe me,
you're missing it.

277
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,768
Well, what is a girl
supposed to do?

278
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,729
Go out on the street and ask
the first man she meets

279
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,847
to come home with her?

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,766
No, don't do that, ma'am.
it don't work.

281
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,130
Bedroom problems.

282
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,608
<i>Bedroom problems?</i>

283
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,529
<i>Bedroom problems.</i>

284
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,324
Over here, please.

285
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,161
Just set it down there.
No, the other way.

286
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,410
Thank you very much.

287
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,051
How's it look?

288
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,485
You look beautiful.

289
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,927
Oh, Jonathan, now really,
do you like it or...

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,082
Whatever you like, I like.

291
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,731
Jan, why won't you
marry me?

292
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,609
Jonathan,
I don't love you.

293
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,091
Well, that's absurd.

294
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,766
Well, I'm young,
I'm rich, I'm healthy.

295
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,444
I'm good-looking.
I'm very good-looking.

296
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,806
I've got everything.

297
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,350
Including three ex-wives.

298
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,010
on, that's what it is.

299
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,163
Jan, please don't
hold that against me.

300
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,527
Those marriages were just a
revolt against my mother.

301
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,604
I'm trying to work it out. I'm trying
to find out why I dislike her so.

302
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,966
I've been talking
to this psychiatrist

303
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
about my mother
for two years now.

304
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,124
And?
It's perfectly healthy.

305
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,601
He dislikes her as much as
I do and he's from Vienna.

306
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,802
This time it'll be different, Jan,you'll see.

307
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,166
We'll go to Mexico.

308
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,730
It'll be like starting
from scratch.

309
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,643
I've never been
married in Mexico.

310
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,688
Jonathan, I just don't
happen to love you.

311
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,125
Well, how do you know?

312
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,886
Love isn't an opinion,
it's a chemical reaction.

313
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,643
We've never even kissed.

314
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,561
Well, they didn't hit the moon with
the first missile shot either.

315
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,281
Oh, Jonathan.
I guess that's what I want.

316
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,971
To hit the moon.

317
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,129
Well...
I tell you what.

318
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,885
Let's have dinner tonight and then
we can try another countdown.

319
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,725
Can't do it. I have to go to a
housewarming party tonight.

320
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,165
One of our clients.

321
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,083
Well, I'll call you
tomorrow, then.

322
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,049
If I can ever get through
that busy signal.

323
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,090
Oh, call between the half-hour
and the hour.

324
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,161
How come?

325
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,208
I've signed a ceasefire
with my party line.

326
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,647
Jan, marry me and I'll smother
you with private phones.

327
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,450
I'd better leave.

328
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,604
That kind of talk could
sweep a girl off her feet.

329
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,051
Hi, Alm.

330
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,601
Any calls?

331
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,606
It's him.

332
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,930
Mr. Allen,
you're on my half-hour.

333
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,926
Party pooper.

334
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,281
Hello?

335
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,608
Don't ever do that again.

336
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,088
Mr. Allen,
we made an agreement.

337
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,525
You were on my time.

338
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,080
All right, so I overlapped
by a few measly minutes.

339
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,969
What am I supposed to do
when somebody calls me?

340
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,008
Be as rude as you are?

341
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,490
Have you anything
else to say?

342
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,211
Yes. Get off
my back, lady.

343
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,489
Stop living vicariously
in what you think I do.

344
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,164
There are plenty of warm
rolls in the bakery.

345
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,925
Stop pressing your nose
against the window.

346
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,088
Come on in, Jonathan.
The door's open.

347
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,491
Hi, Brad.

348
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,767
How's the show going?
Got any more songs ready?

349
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,763
Almost.
Hi.

350
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
Well, fine. Let's hear them.

351
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,441
Not now, Jonathan. I'm going out.
I'm in a hurry.

352
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,806
Now, just a minute, my boy.

353
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,281
I'm putting up $200,000
for this show.

354
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,771
We've got a theater
deadline to meet.

355
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,410
Jonathan,
you're hounding me.

356
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,811
No...

357
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,920
I don't know.

358
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,971
Money seems to have lost
its value these days.

359
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,640
With $200,000, my grandfather
cornered the wheat market

360
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,762
and started a panic in Omaha.

361
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,042
Today, you can't even
frighten songwriters with it.

362
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,282
Well, that's inflation
for you, Jonathan.

363
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,329
Pour yourself a Scotch.

364
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Thanks.

365
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,889
The trouble with you is
you're prejudiced against me

366
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,406
because I'm part
of a minority group.

367
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,484
What minority group?

368
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,485
Millionaires.

369
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,722
You outnumber us,
but you'll never get us.

370
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,280
We'll fight for our rights
to the bitter end.

371
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,925
We've got the money to do it.

372
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,765
Why, Jonathan,
you sound absolutely bitter.

373
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,731
Well, you don't know
what this show means to me.

374
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,041
Now, look at us, we went
through college together.

375
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,488
You worked your way through. You've
become an important songwriter.

376
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,289
You've had a couple
of big Broadway hits.

377
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,407
You started out with nothing

378
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,847
and you've really made
something out of yourself.

379
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,968
Me, I started out in college
with $8 million

380
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,486
and I've still
got $8 million.

381
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,922
I just can't seem
to get ahead.

382
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,405
Who's the girl?

383
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,121
What girl?

384
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,646
Oh, come on, now,
you can't kid me.

385
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,563
I've been through
three marriages with you.

386
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,369
You're like a fighter.

387
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,011
You're only ambitious when you're
getting ready to climb into the ring.

388
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,081
Yeah.

389
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,368
Well, there is a girl.

390
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,170
Brad, she is the sweetest,
she is the loveliest,

391
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,049
she's the most talented
person I've ever met.

392
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,009
That's what you said when
you married that stripper.

393
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,651
She was not a stripper.
She was an exotic dancer.

394
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,449
With trained doves.

395
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,124
When's the happy
occasion?

396
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,043
Well, I don't know
for sure.

397
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,646
She claims she doesn't
want to marry me.

398
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,326
But that's what all
my wives said at first.

399
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,121
Mind if I call her up?

400
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,964
No. Go right ahead.

401
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,445
What's her name?
Jan.

402
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,045
Jan who?

403
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,406
Jan...

404
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,961
Oh, no.
Not gonna tell you.

405
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,048
I may be neurotic,
but I'm not crazy.

406
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,360
Busy. I can never
get her on the phone.

407
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,408
She shares a party line
with some nut.

408
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,844
<i>It couldn't be.</i>

409
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,330
<i>Or could it?</i>

410
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,080
What kind of a nut?

411
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,321
Some guy...

412
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,449
Some guy with a phone fetish.

413
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,204
She had to make
a deal with him

414
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,408
where they use it on
alternate half-hours.

415
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,687
That's ridiculous.

416
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,643
A Pretty girl. huh?

417
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,370
Yeah.

418
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,691
Good figure?

419
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,807
Hmm.

420
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,201
And you won't tell me
who she is?

421
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,441
That's right.

422
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,084
I found this gold mine.

423
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,970
I'm not gonna tell an old claim
jumper like you how to get to it.

424
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,884
You sly dog, you-

425
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,921
Still busy. I must be
on the wrong half-hour.

426
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,966
Brad, as a friend...

427
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,405
Sit down, boy.

428
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,841
As a friend, I only hope one
day you find a girl like this.

429
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,321
You ought to quit all this
chasing around, get married.

430
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,925
Why?
Why?

431
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,844
You're not getting
any younger, fella.

432
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, sure, it's fun,
it's exciting.

433
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,643
Dancing, nightclubbing with a
different doll every night.

434
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,803
But there comes a time when a man
wants to give up that kind of life.

435
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,887
Why?

436
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,169
Because he wants to create a
stable, lasting relationship

437
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,844
with one person.

438
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,528
Brad, believe me, there is nothing
in this world so wonderful,

439
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,680
so fulfilling, as coming home
to the same woman every night.

440
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,401
Why?

441
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,490
Because that's what
it means to be adult.

442
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,211
A wife, a family, a house.

443
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,926
A mature man wants
those responsibilities.

444
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,767
Why?

445
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,841
Well, if you want to,

446
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,605
you can find tricky
arguments against anything.

447
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,564
I gotta get out of here.

448
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,206
What have you got against
marriage anyway?

449
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,610
Jonathan,

450
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,244
before a man gets married, he's
like a tree in the forest.

451
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,604
He stands there independent,
an entity unto himself.

452
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,971
And then he's chopped down,
his branches are cut off,

453
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,121
he's stripped of his bark

454
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,885
and he's thrown into the river
with the rest of the logs.

455
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,361
Then this tree is
taken to the mill.

456
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,962
And when it comes out,
it's no longer a tree.

457
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,044
It's the vanity table, the
breakfast nook, the baby crib,

458
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,964
and the newspaper that lines
the family garbage can.

459
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,969
No, no.

460
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,408
Look, if this girl weren't
something extra special,

461
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,641
then maybe I'd
agree with you.

462
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,245
But with Jan,

463
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,324
you look forward to having
your branches cut off.

464
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,169
Well, I gotta be going.

465
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,724
Listen, remember,
I need those songs.

466
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,564
I'll have them in
your office on Monday.

467
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,966
Good man.

468
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,567
Hello?

469
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,641
Miss Morrow.

470
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,007
This is Brad Allen.

471
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,602
I've just gone through an agonizing
reappraisal of our situation.

472
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,160
And I'm not very
proud of myself.

473
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,290
I have used the phone too much
and I've been extremely rude.

474
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,281
I'd like to apologize for
the way I've been acting

475
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,806
and I thought we
could get together.

476
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,729
Have a cup of coffee,
maybe.

477
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,370
Get acquainted.

478
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,727
We might find we have
a lot in common.

479
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,123
Mr. Allen, we have
nothing in common.

480
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,206
Not that meeting you
mightn't prove amusing.

481
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,686
But frankly, some jokes are
just too obvious to be funny.

482
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,161
Bradley, honey.

483
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,684
I've almost got it.
There.

484
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,885
I can't believe it.

485
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,164
A song for little old me.

486
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,766
Mmm-hmm.

487
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,009
<i>You are my inspiration</i>

488
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,845
<i>Marie</i>

489
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,644
<i>A perfect combination, Marie</i>

490
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,931
<i>Your eyes, your hair,
are beyond compare</i>

491
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,050
<i>So is it any wonder?</i>

492
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,644
<i>You captured me and now
I'm under your spell</i>

493
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,882
<i>Marie</i>

494
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,411
Oh, Brad.

495
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,004
What a pity you have
to leave so soon.

496
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,970
Yes, I have a very early
appointment in the morning.

497
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,366
You know, everyone thinks
the house is heaven.

498
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,681
Really?
Oh, I'm so glad.

499
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,885
Good evening, Mother.
How's the party going?

500
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,371
Oh, lovely, dear.

501
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,284
Miss Morrow, I want you
to meet my son Tony.

502
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,361
Hello, Tony.
Hello.

503
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,562
Tony's graduating from
Harvard this summer.

504
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,529
He's Phi Beta Kappa, you know.
Oh.

505
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,250
Oh, Mother, it's not
that big a deal.

506
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,886
If Tony has one fault,
it's that he's too modest.

507
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,247
You needn't wait
for a cab, Jan.

508
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,560
Tony can drive you
into town.

509
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,847
Oh, no. I wouldn't
want to impose. Really.

510
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,526
I'd be delighted to,
Miss Morrow.

511
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,806
Thank you.

512
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,405
I do hope Mr. P will feel
better in the morning.

513
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,642
I'm sure he will.
it was a marvelous time.

514
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,840
Thank you, dear.

515
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,649
I'll talk to you soon. Good night.
Yes, dear. Good night.

516
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,449
I won't be long, Mother.

517
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,690
Tony, don't drive too fast.

518
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,683
I won't, Mother.

519
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,922
What time do you have to be back
to the Copa for the next show?

520
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,843
Don't worry, darling.

521
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,322
We just got oodles
and oodles of time.

522
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,482
Tony, please.

523
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,451
Jan, you're so primitive.

524
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,802
Tony, control yourself.

525
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,804
Remember,
you're a Harvard man.

526
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,330
Not tonight, baby.
I'm on vacation.

527
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,888
Stop it.
You're only 21.

528
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,086
I dig older women.

529
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,321
Oh!

530
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,125
I've never seen a boy
with so many arms before.

531
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,124
Tony, so help me,
I'm gonna tell your mother.

532
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,003
It's your word
against mine.

533
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,967
Look, I've never belted
a Phi Beta Kappa...

534
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,168
Okay, okay.
I'll take you home.

535
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,241
Okay-

536
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,566
Only promise to stop
and have one drink with me.

537
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,005
No.
All right.

538
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,764
All right.

539
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,968
I'm certainly in no
condition for this.

540
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,771
Well, now, would you
please start this car?

541
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,725
Come on, come on.
Drink up.

542
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,245
You're still on
your first one.

543
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,642
Tony, your mother is going to
be terribly worried about you.

544
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,088
Now, what do you say I pour you
into a cab and send you home?

545
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,764
You know something?

546
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,525
You are being
very uncooperative.

547
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,526
Oh, come on, Jan. Finish your drink.
It's very nourishing.

548
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,246
Will you please stop
trying to get me drunk?

549
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,321
Drunk?

550
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,649
I'll have you know a Harvard man never
resorts to getting a woman drunk.

551
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,888
Except in an emergency.

552
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,049
And you, Miss Morrow,
are an emergency.

553
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,366
Tony, I want you
to get the check

554
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,171
and let's get out of here
and I mean it.

555
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,001
No.

556
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,242
I categorically refuse.

557
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,367
All right. You can stay
till AA comes for you.

558
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,601
I am leaving.

559
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,125
No, wait.

560
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,850
Just one dance and I'll go home.
I promise.

561
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,121
I don't believe you.

562
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,531
Scout's honor.

563
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,564
<i>So that's the other
end of your party line.</i>

564
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,650
<i>How are you gonna get on
friendly terms with that?</i>

565
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,609
Anything wrong, darling?

566
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,648
No. No.

567
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,084
Shouldn't you be getting
into your costume?

568
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,005
Well, it's not much to
get into, honey lamb.

569
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,411
I know.

570
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,921
But...

571
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,209
I want you to look
especially nice tonight.

572
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,804
I want to, too.

573
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,883
<i>Brad, my boy,
you haven't got a chance.</i>

574
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,282
<i>The minute you tell her who
you are, you are buck dead.</i>

575
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,011
<i>But maybe you don't have
to tell her, honey lamb.</i>

576
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,683
Are you all right?

577
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,964
I don't feel so good.

578
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,680
Do you mind if we
sit this one out?

579
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,001
No. Of course. Come on.
Thank you.

580
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,768
I really should
be getting home.

581
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,884
Tony. Get up. Tony.

582
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,122
Excuse me, ma'am.

583
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,686
I reckon it got a mite too close
in here for your partner.

584
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,167
Oh, yes.

585
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,966
I wonder if you would ask a couple
of waiters to help get him outside.

586
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,008
Why, shucks, ma'am.

587
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,282
No need to call
anybody else.

588
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,842
Why, come on, boy,
upsy-daisies.

589
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,760
I can't tell you how
embarrassing this is, Mr...

590
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,003
Stetson, ma'am.
Rex Stetson.

591
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,089
No call to be
embarrassed.

592
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,242
I'm afraid he's had
too much to drink.

593
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,086
We have a saying
back in Texas, ma'am.

594
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,171
"Never drink anything
stronger than you are."

595
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,365
Or older.

596
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,204
Your coat, ma'am.

597
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,602
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

598
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,330
I reckon we'd better get
your boyfriend home.

599
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,004
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

600
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,605
No, his mother is
a client of mine.

601
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,968
A client?
You a lawyer or something?

602
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,606
No, I'm an interior
decorator.

603
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,761
You are?

604
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,525
He was driving me home and
insisted on stopping for a drink.

605
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,046
Don't tell me this
young fella was trying

606
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,851
to force his attentions
upon you.

607
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,167
Well...

608
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,686
Well, that's one thing
I can't stand, ma'am,

609
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,161
a man who tries to take
advantage of a woman.

610
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,846
We make short work
of his kind back in Texas,

611
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,410
I can tell you.

612
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,083
2268 Gardner Drive,
Scarsdale, please.

613
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,929
Drive him slow and set him
down real easy, partner.

614
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,766
Now, how are you getting home, ma'am?
Thank you.

615
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,922
Well, I thought that
I would take his car

616
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,048
and then he could
pick it up tomorrow.

617
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,522
It's mighty late for a young
lady to be out driving alone.

618
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,045
It's not very far.

619
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,808
I'd feel a lot better if
you'd let me see you home.

620
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,725
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

621
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,244
Oh, that's it.

622
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,408
This bitty thing?

623
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,571
Why, back home we got
jackrabbits bigger than this.

624
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,564
How do you get
into this thing?

625
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,406
Well, it's a bit tricky. I think you'd
better put your right leg in first.

626
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,084
Oh, yeah.

627
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,886
Now sit down.

628
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,928
Where?

629
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,405
On the seat.

630
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,641
Yeah.

631
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,211
Can't you get
your other leg in?

632
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,520
I hope so, ma'am.

633
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,007
Sure hate to leave
without it.

634
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,886
Can you drive?

635
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,521
Well, I think I can
manage the steering,

636
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,691
but somebody else'll
have to work the pedals.

637
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,444
I think we should
call a cab.

638
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,124
I think so, too.

639
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,690
All right.

640
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,771
Ma'am...

641
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,688
You might have to call
the automobile club

642
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,286
to help get me
out of this thing.

643
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,205
You looked so funny.

644
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,567
There wasn't a thing
I could do.

645
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,007
<i>What a marvelous-looking
man.</i>

646
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,563
<i>I wonder if he's single.</i>

647
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,930
<i>I don't know how long
I can get away with this act.</i>

648
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,571
<i>But she's sure worth a try.</i>

649
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,969
<i>Well, don't just sit there
like a bump on a log.</i>

650
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,805
<i>Make some casual
conversation.</i>

651
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,931
It's a lovely evening,
isn't it?

652
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,241
Oh, yes, ma'am.
it sure is.

653
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,606
You married?

654
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,886
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

655
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,008
<i>You idiot. What are
you trying to do?</i>

656
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,730
<i>Scare the man away?</i>

657
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,484
No, ma'am, I'm not.

658
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,722
<i>This may take some fancy
broken-field running.</i>

659
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,964
All those buildings
filled with people.

660
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,691
Kind of scares a country
boy like me, you know it?

661
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,688
<i>Isn't that sweet?</i>

662
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,206
<i>So unpretentious
and honest.</i>

663
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,167
<i>What a relief after a couple
of monsters, like Tony Walters</i>

664
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,130
<i>and that Brad Allen.</i>

665
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,370
Everybody had a large
family but me, ma'am.

666
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,851
I'm the only Child.

667
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,048
Really? There were
six of us at home.

668
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,645
Four brothers
and two sisters.

669
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,961
Well, that's what I call
a nice-sized family, ma'am.

670
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,964
That's something you don't
see much of anymore.

671
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,847
Well, I believe in large families.
Don't you?

672
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,524
Oh, yes, indeedy.

673
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,410
Seems like folks nowadays have
just stopped having kids.

674
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,641
May I, ma'am?

675
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,960
Thank you.

676
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,721
I guess it's the
high cost of living.

677
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,370
Or else television.

678
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,129
Between The Late
Late Show at night

679
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,645
and Dave Garroway
in the morning,

680
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,088
why, it seems like
there ain't much time.

681
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,923
Would you like to come in
for some coffee?

682
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,809
No, ma'am.

683
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,691
I ain't used
to these hours.

684
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,321
Why, back home we'd be
just about getting up now.

685
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,689
Well, it's been
a real pleasure, ma'am.

686
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,845
Night.

687
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,161
Good night.

688
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,481
<i>Don't let him walk away without
your phone number, you goof.</i>

689
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,403
<i>You might never
see him again.</i>

690
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,404
Oh, Mr. Stetson.

691
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,006
Ma'am?

692
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,044
Seeing as how you're
all alone in New York,

693
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,964
well, if there's anything you
need and I can be of some help,

694
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,011
my number is Plaza 2-2748.

695
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,848
2-2748.

696
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,611
I'll remember that. Bye.

697
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,121
Bye.

698
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,960
<i>I'd say five or six dates
ought to do it.</i>

699
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,286
<i>It's so nice to meet a man
you feel you can trust.</i>

700
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,442
<i>He obviously respected you.</i>

701
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,364
<i>He didn't even
try to kiss you.</i>

702
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,847
<i>Or maybe you just
don't appeal to him.</i>

703
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,042
<i>He didn't write
your number down.</i>

704
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,730
<i>Why didn't you think to ask
where he was staying?</i>

705
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,167
Hello?

706
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,607
Ma'am,
this is Rex Stetson.

707
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,321
Oh!

708
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,367
Hello.

709
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,965
I hope I didn't
wake you up.

710
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,046
Not at all.

711
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,045
Well, I was just lying here thinking
about your generous offer and all,

712
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,683
to call you in case there
was anything I needed.

713
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,046
Uh-huh?

714
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,771
Well, I need to go out
to dinner tomorrow night

715
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,731
and I sure would enjoy seeing a
friendly face across the table.

716
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,844
Of course, if you're going
to be busy tomorrow night...

717
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,242
No, I always keep
tomorrow night open.

718
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,926
I mean, I
hadn't planned a thing.

719
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,365
Oh, I'd love to have
dinner with you.

720
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,442
Heho, heho, heho,
is anybody on this line?

721
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,921
Yes, I am on the line.
Would you please get off it?

722
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,923
All right, but you're
on my half-hour.

723
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,443
Rex? Rex, are you there?

724
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,091
Yes, ma'am. Who was that?

725
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,766
My party line.
A horrible little man.

726
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,729
He sure isn't
very well-mannered.

727
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,485
Mannered? He isn't even
worth talking about.

728
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,486
Now...

729
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,324
What were you saying?

730
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,886
I'll be stopping by
about 7:30.

731
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,645
All right.
That'll be fine.

732
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,681
Miss Morrow?

733
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,886
Uh-huh?

734
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,726
I've never been much on
making fancy speeches,

735
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,051
but I get a nice, warm feeling
being near you, ma'am.

736
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,491
It's like being around a potbellied
stove on a frosty morning.

737
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,327
Oh, Rex, what a
lovely thing to say.

738
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,324
Well, night, ma'am.

739
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,970
Good night.

740
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,402
<i>Like a potbellied stove
on a frosty morning.</i>

741
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,848
<i>He does like you.</i>

742
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,801
Hello?

743
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,120
Miss Morrow,
Brad Allen.

744
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,969
Hello? Hello?

745
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,521
Yes?

746
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,251
I couldn't help overhearing
part of your conversation.

747
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,486
I'm sure you couldn't.

748
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,641
And sharing a phone
together,

749
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,802
I feel a certain
responsibility for you.

750
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,166
Now, look,
take my advice.

751
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,725
Don't go out with that
man tomorrow night.

752
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,847
He's a phony.

753
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,206
Of course,
it's none of my business.

754
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,931
Oh, that's right, Mr. Allen,
it is none of your business.

755
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,646
Okay, only don't let
that yokel act fool you.

756
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,209
This ranch hand Romeo is just trying
to lure you into the nearest barn.

757
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,723
Don't judge other
people by yourself.

758
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,605
All right, if you won't
take a friendly warning...

759
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,491
But I can tell you exactly
what he'll do tomorrow night.

760
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,927
He'll take you
to dinner, dancing,

761
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,641
then he'll find some excuse to stop
off at his hotel room for a moment.

762
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,961
And that, Miss Morrow,
is where the payoff comes.

763
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,088
Good night, Mr. Allen.

764
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,325
Well, this is it.

765
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,842
This is what?
My hotel.

766
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,686
You don't mind if we stop off for
a minute, do you, to get my coat?

767
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,206
It's a little bit
chilly out.

768
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,884
<i>The payoff.</i>

769
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,401
One thing you gotta
give New York.

770
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,289
Nice, big hotel rooms.

771
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,767
And mighty comfortable beds.

772
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,884
Come on over here.

773
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,531
Now,

774
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,925
ain't that a pretty
view of Central Park?

775
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,171
Mighty romantic,
ain't it?

776
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,610
Well, let's go.

777
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,491
You really came up here
for your coat.

778
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,250
What did you think
I came up for, ma'am?

779
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,481
I thought...

780
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,483
Thought what, ma'am?

781
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,726
Well, I thought you
brought me up here to...

782
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,963
Oh, ma'am.

783
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,247
I'm sorry, Rex. I should have known
that you're not like the others.

784
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,209
But I had to make sure.

785
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,044
Will you forgive me?

786
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,565
Of course, ma'am.

787
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,889
I guess I can't blame you.

788
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,923
Living in bear country's bound to
make you wonder about strange caves.

789
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,721
Now, let's go
for that drive.

790
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,241
This way, ma'am.

791
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,966
I thought we were
going for a drive.

792
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,485
We are.

793
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,364
Back-home style.

794
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,605
You know something?

795
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,571
Whenever I wanna
feel close to home,

796
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,970
the only thing that helps
is getting behind a horse.

797
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,842
<i>There's something
so wholesome</i>

798
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,446
<i>about a man
who loves animals.</i>

799
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,766
<i>I hope this stupid horse knows
where he's supposed to go.</i>

800
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,362
<i>Hangs on to the reins
like a subway strap.</i>

801
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,247
<i>I don't know what he's up to, but I'm
sure glad she ain't my daughter.</i>

802
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,729
Now, over here
is the ranch house.

803
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,966
Right here is the corral,
that's where I keep my ponies.

804
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,611
And over here behind the
ranch house is a mountain.

805
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,089
Ain't a very big mountain,
but it's ours.

806
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,209
Texas must be
a wonderful place.

807
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,329
Oh, yes, ma'am, it is.
It is.

808
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,248
One minute, I'll check my
coat, then I'll be back.

809
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,531
I seem to be
out of cigarettes.

810
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,001
I wonder if you'd excuse me.
Bye, now.

811
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,286
Bye.

812
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,202
Fred, you gotta come down
here and help me out.

813
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,971
Fred, I'll make you a deal.

814
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,681
If you come down here
and take her off my hands...

815
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,161
Fred?

816
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,681
Fred.

817
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,490
Hey, Brad. Fred who?

818
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,009
Hey, Jonathan, old pal.
Good to see you, boy.

819
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,491
Sir, you forgot
your check.

820
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,561
Oh, thanks, Cathy.

821
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,722
Come on in. There's somebody
here I want you to meet.

822
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,801
Yeah, who?

823
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,006
This girl.

824
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,526
Friend of the family. She's visiting here.
Wonderful girl.

825
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,647
Uh-huh.

826
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,849
But I wanted to work on those
songs of yours tonight...

827
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,203
Say, why don't you take her over
for the rest of the evening?

828
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,441
Me?
Yeah.

829
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,567
Take her dancing maybe.

830
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,091
She's dying to learn
how to dance.

831
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,640
Wait. She doesn't
know how to dance?

832
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,848
Well, naturally, she doesn't get
out of the house very often.

833
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,888
What do you mean,
naturally?

834
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,042
Jonathan, believe me,
you and Moose...

835
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,645
I mean, Miss Taggett,
will get along...

836
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,688
Moose?
Oh, all right.

837
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,524
So a girl picks up
a nickname.

838
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,682
You know how cruel
kids can be.

839
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,206
Especially to someone
who's a little different.

840
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,170
Now, now just a minute.
How different?

841
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,130
Well, just...

842
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,449
Different. You know.

843
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,201
Wait.

844
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,281
Is that the one right
there? That one?

845
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,322
How can you tell?

846
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,448
See how nice and
friendly she is?

847
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,244
Mmm-hmm.

848
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,766
Jonathan.
Are you kidding?

849
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,046
Jonathan, you've
got to help me out.

850
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,167
Sorry, pal.

851
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,044
It's your moose.

852
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,290
Happy hunting.

853
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,242
Yes, indeedy.

854
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,046
Beatnik.

855
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,681
Hello?

856
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,286
Morning, Miss Morrow.
This is Rex.

857
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,889
Oh, good morning, Rex.

858
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,725
Ma'am, you done did
a terrible thing to me.

859
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,961
Oh?

860
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,162
You made me glad
I ain't in Texas.

861
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,445
Havel?
Mmm-hmm.

862
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,961
Every time I look at you,
I say to myself,

863
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,486
"We got all kinds of natural
resources back home,

864
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,847
"but we ain't got
nothing like that."

865
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,887
Oh, Rex.

866
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,530
Tell you something
else, too.

867
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,410
I kind of hated New York
when I first came here.

868
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,842
All those people.
Seemed so distant and all.

869
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,802
Don't feel that way now.

870
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,725
That's good.

871
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,767
It sure turned out
to be a friendly town.

872
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,641
You'll find that most people are
willing to meet you halfway,

873
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,725
if you let them.

874
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,530
Am I gonna see you
tonight?

875
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,968
Oh, I'd love to, Rex, but I
already have a date tonight.

876
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,404
Who with?
A client.

877
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,006
You don't know him.
Jonathan Forbes.

878
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,246
Of course.

879
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,451
You ain't the kind of gal
who'd break a date.

880
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,841
No, I'm not.

881
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,206
And I ain't the kind of guy
that'd ask you to.

882
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,089
I know you're not.

883
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,561
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

884
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,165
I'll be ready.

885
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,884
Oh, what a day.

886
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,124
Good morning, Alma.

887
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,645
Isn't it a beautiful day?

888
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,042
You can't go by me.
I haven't seen it yet.

889
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,801
Okay, I'll take
your word for it.

890
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,522
He must be pretty special if
you'd break a date for him.

891
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,640
He is.

892
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,484
What's he like?

893
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,845
Well, he's 6'6", handsome,

894
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,643
intelligent,
owns a mountain.

895
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,451
Well, don't just stand there
making with the toast.

896
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,767
Get that robe off
and go get him.

897
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,887
What?

898
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,363
6'6" of opportunity doesn't
come along every day, you know.

899
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,166
Alma, I hardly
know the man.

900
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,921
Takes only one sip of wine to
tell if it's a good bottle.

901
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,330
This is a good bottle.

902
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,571
Well, what are you
waiting for? Drink up.

903
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,729
Jan, answer me.

904
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,564
Are you evading
my question?

905
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,130
I'll have these initialed
if you like.

906
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,089
Why did you break our date?
Now tell the truth.

907
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,446
'Cause you got
another date, huh?

908
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,842
Go ahead, tell me. You're going
out with someone else, right?

909
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,921
Right.

910
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,729
That's a terribly
cruel thing to say.

911
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,290
I'm... Who is he?
What's his name?

912
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,691
Rex Stetson.
Do I know him?

913
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,127
No. He's visiting
here from Texas.

914
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,690
Texas?

915
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,366
Oh, Jan, how could you?

916
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,966
How could you ever fall
in love with a tourist?

917
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,770
I don't know, I just did.

918
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,411
You admit it. You just said it.
You love him.

919
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,531
I did, didn't I?

920
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,082
As many times as I'll be married,
I'll never understand women.

921
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,766
What a blow to my psyche.

922
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,245
To be rejected
for a cowboy.

923
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,925
He's not a cowboy.

924
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,650
All right, an oilman.

925
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,048
Jan, if you marry him, you'll
have to live out there.

926
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,090
Look at that. New York.

927
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,162
People jostling,
shoving, struggling,

928
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,891
milling, fighting for their
lives, and you're part of it.

929
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,522
In Texas there's nothing but a
bunch of prairie dogs and stuff.

930
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,126
And even the air out there,
there's nothing in it but air.

931
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,521
In New York you've got air
you can sink your teeth into.

932
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,284
It has character.

933
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,602
Jan, you can't
live in Texas.

934
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,490
Oh, Jonathan, we haven't
even talked about marriage.

935
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,210
Yeah, but it's that
look in your eye.

936
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,805
I've been married
often enough to know

937
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,531
when a girl's willing
to talk about it.

938
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,001
Do I look willing?

939
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,526
You look absolutely
disgusting.

940
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,529
I'm sorry. You know me.

941
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,967
I say an awful lot of
things I don't mean.

942
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,888
I just want you
to be happy.

943
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,805
If it's Rex Stetson
you want,

944
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,848
I hope it's Rex Stetson
you get.

945
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,164
Excuse me.

946
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,960
May I help you?

947
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,523
Yes. I'd like to make an
appointment for an examination.

948
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,926
For your wife?

949
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,604
No, I'm not married.

950
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,525
It's for myself.

951
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,931
You mean, you want the
doctor to examine you?

952
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,321
Yes. I haven't been
feeling too well.

953
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,846
Probably just
an upset stomach,

954
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,688
but a fellow can't
be too careful.

955
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,442
I'll tell the doctor
you're here.

956
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,520
Oh, there's no need
to break in on him.

957
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,809
I let it go this long, I can put
it off another few minutes.

958
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,360
No, I'm sure he'll
be very anxious to see you.

959
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,921
Um...

960
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,691
When she gets back, tell her
I'm feeling much better.

961
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,843
It's probably just
a false alarm.

962
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,485
Where is he?
He must have just gone.

963
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,401
Excuse me.

964
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,888
The man said he was going to have
a baby and you let him get away?

965
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,008
But he was obviously
a psychopath.

966
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,127
What if he weren't?

967
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,770
But, Dr. Maxwell...

968
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,041
Miss Resnick, medical science still
has many unknown regions to explore.

969
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,641
Look, you're the
detective agency.

970
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,610
All I know is that his name is
Rex Stetson and he's from Texas.

971
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,331
I want all the information
you can get on him.

972
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,529
You've helped me get
divorced three times.

973
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,682
Now let's see if you can
get me married once.

974
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,606
What? All right, if it'll save
any time, I'll be right over.

975
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,441
Yes?

976
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,724
Mr. Allen is here to see you.
I can't see him.

977
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,561
Sure you can. I herewith present
you three solid gold hit songs.

978
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,880
Leave them
on my desk.

979
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,086
Where are you going?

980
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,811
Listen, remember that gal
I told you about, Jan?

981
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,961
Who?
Jan.

982
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,769
The one with the party
line with the nut?

983
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,571
Oh, yeah. What about her?

984
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,291
Well, she meets this stupid
cowboy from Texas of all places

985
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,970
and she falls for him.

986
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,925
How do you know?
She told me so.

987
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,126
But don't worry,
I'll break it up.

988
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,401
You will?
Yeah.

989
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,447
How?
Leave it to me.

990
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,567
I don't know
how fast he moves,

991
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,008
but it takes an early bird to
get the best of a worm like me.

992
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,561
Hello?

993
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,529
Miss Morrow,
Brad Allen.

994
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,682
Look, I am in a hurry, Mr. Allen,
so if you don't mind...

995
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,964
Of course, but before you hang
up, just admit I was right.

996
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,127
About what?

997
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,440
Your Western gentleman.

998
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,251
He turned out to be a
prairie wolf, didn't he?

999
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,846
Mr. Allen, this may come
as a shock to you,

1000
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,967
but there are some men

1001
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,691
who don't end every sentence
with a proposition.

1002
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,049
Oh, come on, you mean, he didn't try
to get you up to his hotel room?

1003
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,770
Yes, he took me
to his hotel room.

1004
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,841
Uh-huh...

1005
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,365
He showed me Central Park.

1006
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,521
And then we left.

1007
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,806
And nothing else?

1008
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,041
Nothing.

1009
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,521
Hmm.

1010
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,649
That's even worse
than I thought.

1011
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,449
Worse? What do
you mean, worse?

1012
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,364
Oh, well,
must I spell it out?

1013
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,320
Either you're not
telling the truth or...

1014
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,045
Or what?

1015
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,211
Well, there are
some men who just...

1016
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,604
Well, they're very devoted
to their mothers.

1017
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,406
You know, the type that likes
to collect cooking recipes,

1018
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,562
or exchange
bits of gossip.

1019
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,722
What a vicious
thing to say.

1020
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,882
Oh, I hope I'm wrong,
but...

1021
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,041
Don't you think
you'd better make sure?

1022
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,804
You are sick.

1023
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,400
Why, this isn't Rex Stetson.
This is...

1024
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,123
My best friend.

1025
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,929
Yep, they're usually
the ones.

1026
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,801
Oh, I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1027
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,289
Hello? It's for you.

1028
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,521
Thank you.

1029
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,481
Graham.

1030
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,686
Uh-huh?

1031
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,004
Oh, good work.

1032
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,327
Get your coat, Mr. Forbes. Why?

1033
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,323
I've had one of
my men tailing him.

1034
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,007
He and the girl just went into a
little club known as The Hidden Door.

1035
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,764
The Hidden Door?

1036
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,404
Should've listened
to my psychiatrist.

1037
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,006
He told me never to
trust anyone but him.

1038
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,370
Is this <i>Roly Poly?</i>
Yes, it is.

1039
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,930
Oh, I love it.

1040
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,848
<i>There's a guy
in this old town</i>

1041
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,002
<i>I'm telling you a fact</i>

1042
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,321
<i>He measures 5' up and down</i>

1043
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,051
<i>And 5' front and back</i>

1044
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,122
He's a fat one.

1045
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,362
<i>Pleasing as they come</i>

1046
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,011
<i>He's a roly-poly baby</i>

1047
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,161
<i>A ton of fun</i>

1048
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,241
Everybody.

1049
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,368
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1050
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:55,369
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1051
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,767
<i>Ya, ya, Roly
Ya, ya, Poly</i>

1052
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,047
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1053
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,043
Come on, Miss Morrow,
you know this.

1054
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,246
I don't know
all the words.

1055
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,685
Go ahead, Jan, sing.

1056
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,728
<i>When I first laid eyes on him</i>

1057
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,041
<i>I laughed just like the rest</i>

1058
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,290
<i>The more I saw the more of him
the more I liked him best</i>

1059
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,241
<i>Got a roly-poly baby</i>

1060
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,561
<i>Point to him with pride</i>

1061
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,361
<i>He's my roly-poly baby,
I'm satisfied</i>

1062
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,523
<i>I call him
Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1063
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:32,683
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1064
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,081
<i>Ya, ya, Roly
Ya, ya, Poly</i>

1065
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,731
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1066
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,325
Come on, sing another one.

1067
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,601
Another one?

1068
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,447
<i>Just to put my arms
around him</i>

1069
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,443
<i>Takes about a week</i>

1070
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,887
<i>But when I get
my arms around</i>

1071
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,361
<i>We cuddle cheek-to-cheek</i>

1072
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,647
<i>Got a roly-poly baby</i>

1073
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,041
<i>Sweet as I can find</i>

1074
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,567
<i>He's just a roly-poly
But so am I</i>

1075
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,165
<i>I call her</i>

1076
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,924
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1077
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,088
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1078
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,367
<i>Ya, ya, Roly
Ya, ya, Poly</i>

1079
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,207
<i>Ya, ya, Roly Poly</i>

1080
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,281
Ya, ya...

1081
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,690
Thanks, Perry. Thank you.

1082
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,000
That's fun.
You like this club?

1083
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,809
Wasn't that fun?
I love that. I love that.

1084
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,721
Tell me about your job.
it must be very exciting,

1085
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,247
working with all them
colors and fabrics and all.

1086
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,165
Um...

1087
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,840
Rex...

1088
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,081
Hmm?

1089
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,849
Would you like some dip?

1090
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,725
I'd love to.

1091
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,891
Thank you.

1092
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,770
Mmm!

1093
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,929
Ain't these tasty?

1094
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,287
I wonder if I could
get the recipe.

1095
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:24,081
Sure would like to surprise
my ma when I go back home.

1096
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,601
Um...

1097
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,283
Rex, don't you
find me attractive?

1098
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,125
Why, yes, ma'am,
of course.

1099
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,287
Well, then, why
haven't you ever...

1100
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,566
Ever what?

1101
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,682
I'm sorry,
I feel so foolish.

1102
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,081
Oh, no. Now, go ahead.
What's on your mind?

1103
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,605
Well, in all the times that we've
been going out together...

1104
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,920
Mmm-hmm?

1105
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,604
You've been
a perfect gentleman.

1106
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,920
Oh, I hope I have.

1107
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,483
Oh, you have. Oh, and I appreciate
it, Rex, I really do. But...

1108
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,329
Yes?
Well...

1109
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,600
Being such a perfect
gentleman and all, it's...

1110
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,922
Well, it's not
very flattering.

1111
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,365
Well, ma'am, I wouldn't
want to do anything

1112
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,727
that might spoil
our friendship.

1113
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,010
Is that all it is with us?
Friendship?

1114
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,481
Ma'am, that's
a direct question.

1115
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,767
I think it deserves
a direct answer.

1116
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,246
<i>I need no atmosphere</i>

1117
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,687
<i>No day in June</i>

1118
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,524
<i>I need no rocket ship</i>

1119
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,331
<i>No trip to the moon</i>

1120
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,169
If you'll excuse me,

1121
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,965
I'd better go to
the powder moon...

1122
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,485
I mean, room.

1123
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,369
Fix my lipstick.

1124
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,121
There's our man.
Yes, I know him.

1125
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,681
I can handle it from here.

1126
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,923
Need a light, cowboy?

1127
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,890
When are you heading
back to the range, Tex?

1128
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,401
That's up to you.

1129
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,244
You've got two minutes.

1130
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,606
We'll do this nice and clean,
so no one's embarrassed.

1131
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,731
When she gets back,
you'll say goodbye.

1132
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,761
You'll put her in a cab.

1133
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,167
And we'll go home
and you'll pack.

1134
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,006
Where am I going?

1135
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,320
Connecticut.

1136
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,930
My summer house is perfect
for writing songs.

1137
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,884
No phone and 20 miles
to the nearest girl.

1138
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,404
Looks like I haven't
much choice.

1139
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,244
Sure looks like it.

1140
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,051
Remember,
I'll be watching you.

1141
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,726
Ma'am.

1142
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,847
Hello.

1143
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,289
You know, I'm sure going to miss
you, leaving New York and all.

1144
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,690
You're leaving?
Mmm-hmm.

1145
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,727
When?

1146
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,246
Tonight. I have to
mosey up to Connecticut.

1147
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,367
Didn't I tell you?
No.

1148
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,206
No, you didn't.

1149
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,807
Well, this friend of mine, a business
associate, has a house up there,

1150
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,486
and he practically
forced me to use it.

1151
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,281
I just couldn't
refuse him.

1152
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,481
Why must you...

1153
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,125
Well...

1154
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,569
I may be buying the place and I
kind of want to get the feel of it.

1155
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,001
Oh.

1156
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,285
How long will you be away?

1157
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,805
For the weekend.

1158
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,600
It's going to be
mighty lonely up there.

1159
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,487
Ma'am, I don't suppose
you would consider...

1160
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,130
Consider what?

1161
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,126
No, I'm afraid I couldn't
ask you that, ma'am.

1162
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,725
Don't be afraid, ask me.

1163
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,080
Well...

1164
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,962
Oh, no, ma'am,
it wouldn't be proper.

1165
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,168
Rex, we're both over 21.

1166
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,040
I mean...

1167
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,362
Well, I certainly should be
able to trust you by now.

1168
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,966
Ma'am, if I sent you
home in a taxi,

1169
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,646
how long do you think it would
take you to get packed up?

1170
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,085
About an hour.

1171
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,525
Forty-five minutes?

1172
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,009
We're wasting time.

1173
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:14,081
<i>You lied, you dog</i>

1174
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,208
<i>And you'll be sorry</i>

1175
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,928
<i>You lied, you hound</i>

1176
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:31,280
<i>And that's not fair</i>

1177
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,041
Hello?

1178
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,201
Mr. Allen.

1179
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,202
Just so you'll realize how wrong
you are about Rex Stetson,

1180
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,523
he has just asked me to go
away with him for the weekend.

1181
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,965
He didn't.

1182
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,801
Are you going?

1183
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,769
That, Mr. Allen, is something
you'll never know.

1184
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,484
<i>You are my inspiration</i>

1185
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,645
<i>Jan Morrow</i>

1186
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,840
All set?

1187
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,805
All set.
Ah.

1188
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,925
Just to make sure you do
plenty of scoring up there.

1189
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,286
I'll do my best.

1190
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,646
You'd better.

1191
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,691
Off you go.

1192
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,965
<i>Gosh, I feel guilty.</i>

1193
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,089
<i>I practically tricked him
into taking me along.</i>

1194
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,211
<i>You know, you've gone out with
a lot of men in your time.</i>

1195
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,124
<i>But this...
This is the jackpot.</i>

1196
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,167
You cold?

1197
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,248
No. It's wonderful.

1198
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,051
<i>If he only knew
what I was thinking.</i>

1199
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:00,290
<i>Hold me tight
and kiss me right</i>

1200
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,401
<i>I'm yours tonight</i>

1201
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:11,007
<i>My darling, possess me</i>

1202
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:18,121
<i>Tenderly and breathlessly</i>

1203
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,767
<i>Make love to me</i>

1204
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:28,450
<i>My darling, possess me</i>

1205
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,765
<i>Near to me</i>

1206
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,324
<i>When you are near to me</i>

1207
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,201
<i>My heart forgets</i>

1208
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:48,128
<i>To beat</i>

1209
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:55,366
<i>Stars that shine
make dreams divine</i>

1210
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,762
<i>So say you're mine</i>

1211
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:05,803
<i>And, my darling,
possess me</i>

1212
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,400
What did you say?

1213
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,686
Hmm?

1214
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,201
Didn't you say something?

1215
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,089
Who, me? No.

1216
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,721
Oh.

1217
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,567
May I help you, sir?

1218
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,041
Yes. I've
been trying to call...

1219
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,841
To phone Miss Morrow for some time
now and there's been no answer.

1220
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,686
I just wondered if anything
could possibly be wrong.

1221
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,250
Oh, I hardly think so, sir.

1222
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,529
She's just gone to
Connecticut for the weekend.

1223
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,920
Connecticut?

1224
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,766
There's no phone number, but
I have a forwarding address.

1225
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,729
241 Stonybrook Road?

1226
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,766
Why, yes, sir.

1227
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,286
And you let her go?

1228
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,647
Well, it wasn't my place...

1229
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:03,408
No, it's my place.
And I helped him pack.

1230
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,084
Remember when I said
that being near you

1231
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,131
is like being near a potbellied
stove on a frosty morning?

1232
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,441
Yes.

1233
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,485
I was wrong.

1234
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,365
You were?

1235
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,482
More like a forest fire,
completely out of control.

1236
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,209
You know something?

1237
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,044
Out here in the country
you're very different.

1238
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,760
I reckon I feel more at
home, for the first time.

1239
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,082
A man who owns a mountain
doesn't belong in the big city.

1240
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,400
Mmm-mmm.

1241
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,090
Fire's nearly out.

1242
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,247
I'd better get
some more logs.

1243
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,770
For later.

1244
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,285
Hurry back.

1245
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,364
Quicker than a cowpoke
chasing a chuck wagon.

1246
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,281
Jan, I...

1247
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,681
Jan, please.

1248
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,091
Stop.
Jonathan.

1249
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,367
His name isn't Rex
Stetson, it's Brad Allen.

1250
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,441
I know that.

1251
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,244
He's a sneaking,
double-crossing rat.

1252
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,049
I know that, too.

1253
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,281
Will you please
take me home?

1254
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,004
Of course.

1255
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,568
Bedroom problems.

1256
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,283
At least mine can be
solved in one bedroom.

1257
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,806
You couldn't solve
yours in a thousand.

1258
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,681
You cad.

1259
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,004
At least you could have had the
decency to bring your own champagne.

1260
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,560
Jan, you've been crying
for 60 miles now.

1261
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,004
I know it.

1262
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,171
Well, don't you think it's
about time you stopped?

1263
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,571
I can't.

1264
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,686
Come on.

1265
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,683
A cup of coffee will
make you feel better.

1266
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,761
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

1267
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,604
That's all right, come on.

1268
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,885
Two coffees, please.

1269
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,126
Try to control
yourself, Jan.

1270
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,009
I've never done anything
like this before.

1271
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,082
All right, there has
to be a first time.

1272
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,162
You don't have to go
to pieces over it.

1273
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,684
I'm so ashamed.

1274
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,046
Poor kid.

1275
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,841
Guy drives a big car with
all the optional extras.

1276
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,331
Thinks he can get away
with anything.

1277
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,724
I thought we were
going to get married.

1278
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,325
Forget it.

1279
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,000
Jan, you're becoming
hysterical.

1280
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,608
I can't help it.

1281
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,162
I hate to do this, Jan, but
this is for your own good.

1282
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,448
You see? You see?

1283
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,126
Jonathan!

1284
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,005
Jonathan!

1285
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,208
Your coffee,
Mr. Forbes.

1286
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,964
Hello, Jonathan.

1287
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,809
What happened to you?

1288
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,804
I was jumped upon by
five or six ruffians.

1289
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,927
What?

1290
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,650
That's all right, Lois,
just put it down.

1291
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,848
By rights, these loose
teeth belong to you.

1292
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,046
You made her cry.

1293
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,049
I was only trying to stop her.
Cry?

1294
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,167
Did she cry?

1295
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,366
Cry?

1296
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,530
I never knew a woman that size
had that much water in her.

1297
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,965
Have you seen her, Jonathan? No.

1298
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,087
Have you talked to her?

1299
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,486
No, I've decided
to give her up

1300
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,688
on the advice of
my psychiatrist.

1301
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,046
Also my dentist.

1302
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,441
Where have you been
the last three days?

1303
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,410
I stayed up there,
working on the new songs.

1304
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,006
What have you got?

1305
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,127
This.

1306
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,410
And this. And this.

1307
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,005
What, what, what?

1308
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,491
Couldn't come up
with a thing.

1309
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,325
I just sat there,
feeling guilty.

1310
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,524
Guilty? You?

1311
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,610
I once saw you work on three
sisters at the same time.

1312
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,842
And you came up with
some of your best songs.

1313
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,241
All of a sudden, why does one
girl make you feel guilty?

1314
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,368
I don't know. I just do.

1315
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:36,089
Well, what do you know?
You're in love.

1316
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,770
The mighty tree
has been toppled.

1317
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,765
For years I've been waiting to
hear them yell "timber" over you.

1318
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,201
You could be right.

1319
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,611
You're darn right
I'm right.

1320
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,684
You love her and she can't
stand the sight of you.

1321
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,446
That's wonderful.

1322
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,170
That's what it is,
it's wonderful.

1323
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,481
It's almost makes these
loose teeth worthwhile.

1324
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,441
Yeah?

1325
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,726
<i>Miss Morrow
is here to see you.</i>

1326
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,164
Tell her to come in.

1327
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,965
Is there a back way out of here?
Uh-uh.

1328
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,691
We're gonna have
some fun around here.

1329
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,921
Thank you.
Good morning, Jonathan.

1330
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,001
Jan.

1331
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,361
Here's the painting I was
telling you about. Ah...

1332
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,727
Well, let's get on with
the hanging, shall we?

1333
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,361
I believe you're acquainted
with Brad Allen, the ex-Rex?

1334
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,811
The end tables are coming at 4:00, Jonathan.
I'll see you then.

1335
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,721
Jan.

1336
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,051
Jan, wait.

1337
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,087
Look, I don't blame
you for hating me.

1338
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,084
I'm trying to apologize.

1339
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,845
Excuse me.

1340
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,370
Well, where did he go?

1341
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,967
I don't know, but he
came out of there.

1342
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,690
And you let him
get away again?

1343
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,131
Well, now, surely, Doctor,
you don't believe...

1344
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,362
Miss Resnick,
a prejudiced viewpoint

1345
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,568
never advanced
the cause of science.

1346
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,242
Somewhere in this building, there may be
a man who has crossed a new frontier.

1347
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,201
Jonathan, how do
I get her back?

1348
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,169
You don't.
That's the beauty of it.

1349
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,969
You suffer and I watch.

1350
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,407
Got to be a way.
There's got to.

1351
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,084
What a delightful
situation.

1352
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,970
The great Brad Allen,
chopped down to size,

1353
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,088
floating down the river
with the rest of us logs.

1354
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,170
When you want to get on friendly terms
with a girl, you're nice to her dog.

1355
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,241
No dog.

1356
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,802
Well, if there's no dog, then
you're nice to her mother.

1357
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,723
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

1358
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,008
Well, if worse comes to
worst, you work on her maid.

1359
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,562
Alma? You couldn't get
to first base with her.

1360
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,406
Alma.

1361
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,085
Thanks a lot.

1362
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,960
Uh, uh, excuse me.

1363
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,326
May I talk to you?

1364
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,481
Yes.

1365
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,244
My name is Brad Allen,
and I...

1366
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,766
Mr. Allen, of course.

1367
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,806
Get lost.

1368
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,444
I'd know that voice
of yours anywhere.

1369
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,363
You know me?

1370
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,684
<i>You are my inspiration, Alma</i>

1371
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,728
Oh, the telephone.

1372
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,565
I'm one of your most
devoted listeners.

1373
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,130
Why, thank you.

1374
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,567
That's all right.

1375
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,130
Oh, well, couldn't we...

1376
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,645
It's a little
chilly out here.

1377
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,882
Couldn't we stop in and
have a drink somewhere?

1378
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,406
Oh, no, I don't usually...

1379
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,721
Well, I might have one,
just to be sociable.

1380
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,040
Good. Good.

1381
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,606
I know a nice little bar
right down the street.

1382
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,489
I know a better one.

1383
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,328
You ready for
another one?

1384
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,927
No?

1385
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,047
No.

1386
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,489
Now, let's take this
problem from the beginning.

1387
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,331
You're in love with her and
you want to win her back.

1388
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,485
The first thing you gotta do
is to get her to talk to you.

1389
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,607
Right?

1390
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,727
Right.

1391
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,526
Really very simple.

1392
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,681
Very simple.

1393
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,321
You've got an apartment.
She decorates apartments.

1394
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,321
You hire her
to do your place.

1395
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,046
Two people decorating an
apartment, that's pretty intimate.

1396
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,361
Intimate.
She's gotta talk to you.

1397
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,601
Clever?

1398
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,727
Clever.

1399
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:06,969
And once you start talking,
it's only a matter of time.

1400
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:12,890
Now, remember, you hire her
to decorate your apartment.

1401
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,523
Okay?
Okay.

1402
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,404
Happy?
Happy.

1403
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,049
Would you care for a
little snack of some kind?

1404
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,526
Hi, there, slugger.
This'll fix you up.

1405
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,126
How do you feel?

1406
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,361
Oh, boy.

1407
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,004
I've had hangovers before,

1408
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,209
but this time
even my hair hurts.

1409
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,328
And you were gonna
get her drunk, huh?

1410
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,721
I stayed with her through
a bottle of Scotch.

1411
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,723
I lost her halfway
through the vodka.

1412
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,247
This'll fix you up. It's got
a lot of olive oil in it.

1413
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,970
The State Department
could use her.

1414
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,003
What a party girl
she'd make in Moscow.

1415
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,570
And two raw eggs.

1416
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,130
Oh, go away.

1417
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,491
Didn't you find out
anything from her?

1418
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,723
All I remember is this
voice swimming towards me

1419
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,928
through a sea of Scotch.

1420
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,203
"You've got an apartment.
She decorates apartments.

1421
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,884
"Right?"
Right.

1422
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,450
Of course.

1423
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,563
What's the name of that
place where she works?

1424
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,564
Pierot's. But she
won't talk to you.

1425
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,887
But Pierot will.
You know the number?

1426
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,246
Yeah.

1427
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,486
Dial it.

1428
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,726
Not so loud.

1429
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,171
What do you think?

1430
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,364
But you threw out
all my ideas.

1431
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,801
Well...
Jan, I hate to say this,

1432
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,087
but you were
absolutely right.

1433
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,525
This is much better.

1434
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,683
Of course, if you repeat that
to anyone, you're fired.

1435
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,168
Tilda, as soon as you get
back from the post office,

1436
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,926
call Brad Allen back

1437
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,604
and tell him it's impossible.

1438
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,763
He'll have to get another
decorator to do his apartment.

1439
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,001
Yes, sir.

1440
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,566
You mean, you're
turning him down?

1441
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,005
I have to.

1442
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,121
But why?

1443
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,771
Because I haven't the
time to do his place.

1444
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,763
And I certainly
can't send you,

1445
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,366
not with the way
you feel about him.

1446
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,724
But it's not fair for you
to lose a commission

1447
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,126
because of my
personal feelings.

1448
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,647
I couldn't subject you
to such an experience.

1449
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,684
It might be, how would
you say, traumatic.

1450
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,850
Now, that's silly.
Now, look.

1451
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,251
Once, I had the mumps.

1452
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,890
It wasn't very pleasant,
but I got over it.

1453
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,007
The mumps?

1454
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,526
I look upon Brad Allen
like any other disease.

1455
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,206
I've had him. It's over.
I'm immune to him.

1456
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,362
All right, Jan, if you
think you can handle it.

1457
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,771
I certainly can.

1458
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,490
It's your decision.

1459
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,084
Mr. Allen? Pierot.
She's coming over.

1460
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,682
Why, Miss Morrow,
I was expecting Mr. Pierot.

1461
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,520
Mr. Pierot is unavailable
at this time.

1462
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,568
However, if you'd rather
wait until he's free...

1463
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,563
Oh, no, no.
You'll do just fine.

1464
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,971
Please come in.

1465
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,527
It's just that, well,
it's a little embarrassing.

1466
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,841
Mr. Allen, I'm a decorator,
you're a client.

1467
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,322
I'm here because you are paying
for my professional services.

1468
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,603
Now, what style
did you have in mind?

1469
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,001
Nothing in particular.

1470
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,323
I'm leaving that
entirely up to you.

1471
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,811
Mmm-hmm.

1472
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,651
Now, here...

1473
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,282
This is where I do my work.

1474
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:31,921
Living room. Over here is the
kitchen, dining room over there.

1475
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,130
And up here?

1476
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,611
The bedroom.

1477
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,041
And these?

1478
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,966
Light switches.

1479
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,529
Just switches.

1480
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,403
Aren't they rather
inconvenient?

1481
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,403
Why, no.

1482
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:56,490
The man that lived here
before me had very long arms.

1483
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,770
Over here...

1484
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,524
Mr. Allen, if I'm going
to redo the apartment,

1485
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,251
I have to know what
everything is for.

1486
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,448
Now, this is the fireplace.

1487
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,727
But I'd like to see what
the other switch does.

1488
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,802
It's just a light switch. I
wouldn't pay any attention to it.

1489
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,564
Mr. Allen, please.

1490
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,566
Jan, I...

1491
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,165
Why redecorate?

1492
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,527
It's so functional
for your purposes.

1493
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,729
Not anymore.

1494
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,643
That's why I want you
to redecorate.

1495
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,851
That bed is the first thing
I want you to get rid of.

1496
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,571
And anything else that you
think is in bad taste,

1497
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,210
throw it out.

1498
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:57,011
I want you make this
the type of place that,

1499
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,322
well, you'd feel
comfortable in.

1500
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,051
I'll keep that in mind.

1501
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,241
Good.

1502
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,962
You go right ahead
and take over,

1503
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,082
and I'll stay here
and do my work.

1504
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,528
I'm sorry, Mr. Allen, once we get
started you'll have to move out

1505
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,329
and stay away
until I'm finished.

1506
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,640
Move out?

1507
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,131
The men are going
to be working here.

1508
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,009
You'll just be in the way.

1509
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,129
But there might be things that
you want to discuss with me.

1510
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,486
On a job like this,
Mr. Allen,

1511
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,284
you'll have to give me
carte blanche.

1512
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,771
But I... Well, if you
feel that way...

1513
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,411
No. No. No.
I'll leave.

1514
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,564
Just do the place
the way you'd like it.

1515
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,246
I will.

1516
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:05,523
Tilda, call these shops and tell
them I'll be coming by, will you?

1517
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,808
I want to pick up
a few things.

1518
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:11,009
But, Miss Morrow, we don't
deal with any of these shops.

1519
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,048
Well, you know what
their stuff is like.

1520
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,724
You bet I do.

1521
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,768
You should have seen
that man's apartment.

1522
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,922
He's got it down
to a science.

1523
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,644
He pushes a button and the couch
becomes a bed with baby blue sheets.

1524
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,121
Really?

1525
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:29,166
And him acting
so embarrassed.

1526
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,211
Big phony.

1527
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,560
He's like a spider and he expects
me to redecorate his web.

1528
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,647
Ha!

1529
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,248
Eileen? Brad.

1530
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,404
Dear, I want you to
be the first to know.

1531
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,968
I've met this girl,
I've fallen in love with her,

1532
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,690
and I'm planning
to marry her.

1533
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,726
Oh, nonsense, dear, you have
everything to live for.

1534
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,923
No. It's not
nauseating enough.

1535
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:03,007
That one, with
the two heads.

1536
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,571
You're not serious.

1537
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,687
Wrap it.

1538
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,602
Marie? Brad.

1539
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:13,367
Dear, I want you to
be the first to know.

1540
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,847
With big velour tassels.

1541
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,206
Tassels?

1542
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,327
Tassels.

1543
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,008
Goodbye, my dear.

1544
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,642
Yes. Yes, Mr. Allen, your apartment will
be ready first thing in the morning.

1545
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:43,086
There's just one final touch
I want to give it.

1546
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:46,720
Goodbye.

1547
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,921
Behold, Jonathan. The
work of a woman in love.

1548
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,446
Oh, no.

1549
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,722
I hope you saved those
telephone numbers.

1550
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,921
What?

1551
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,443
That chair, it bit me.

1552
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,807
Get your clothes on.

1553
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,960
You get out of here.

1554
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,042
We're going to my apartment.
I've seen it.

1555
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,690
You'll see it again.
Now, put your clothes on.

1556
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,801
I won't.

1557
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,724
Are you getting out of that bed
or am I coming in after you?

1558
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,484
You wouldn't dare.

1559
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,924
Oh, how dare you?

1560
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,049
Oh, you put me down.
I said, put me down.

1561
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,487
I said, put me down.

1562
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:12,124
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

1563
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,365
I'm warning you, put me
down or I'll scream!

1564
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,044
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Wilson.
Good morning.

1565
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,731
Now, you put me
back in my bed.

1566
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,245
Down, please.

1567
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,805
Harry, would you be so kind
as to call the police?

1568
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,001
Harry.

1569
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,366
Alma, Alma, stop him.

1570
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,320
You wouldn't take me
out in the street.

1571
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,249
If I ever get on my
feet again, look out.

1572
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,561
Alma.

1573
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,649
That man just inspired me to do
something I should have done long ago.

1574
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,200
You're too nice
a looking woman

1575
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,964
to go out drinking
every night.

1576
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:15,522
You know, what you need
is a man to take care of.

1577
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,524
Then you wouldn't have
so much time to drink.

1578
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,368
Why, Harry,
you're so strong.

1579
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:35,405
They'll never believe this
back in Wichita Falls.

1580
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,005
Officer, arrest this man.

1581
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,650
He's taking me up
to his apartment.

1582
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,768
Can't say as I
blame him, Miss.

1583
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,205
How's it going, Brad?

1584
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,566
Fine, Kelly.

1585
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,370
Mommy, where's that man
taking that lady?

1586
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,807
Shh! I'll tell you
when you're older.

1587
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,321
All right, you got me up
here to see the apartment.

1588
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,004
Now will you kindly
put me down?

1589
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,449
It's customary for the groom to carry
the bride across the threshold.

1590
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,611
What bride?

1591
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,003
How's it feel, returning
to the scene of the crime?

1592
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,047
What bride?

1593
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,447
Why did I spend a fortune having
this apartment done over?

1594
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,887
Why did I cut myself off
from every girl I know?

1595
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,485
Why does any man
destroy himself?

1596
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,961
Because he thinks
he's getting married.

1597
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,371
And what does it get me?
What bride?

1598
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,441
This.

1599
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,520
Well, you did yourself
a great job.

1600
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,844
And as far as I'm concerned, you can
stay here and charge admission.

1601
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,324
Doctor, look. It's him.

1602
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,441
Him?

1603
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,285
Just a moment, sir.

1604
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,089
Would you mind
stepping into my office?

1605
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,605
Not now, I have to see
a friend of mine.

1606
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,569
Yes, but I want to talk
to you for just a moment.

1607
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,085
But I have some
important news to tell.

1608
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,241
It will only take
a few minutes.

1609
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,527
But you don't understand,
I'm going to have a baby.

1610
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,250
Of course you are.

1611
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,529
Wait a minute.
Jonathan!

1612
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,046
Jonathan!
