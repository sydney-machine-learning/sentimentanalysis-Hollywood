1
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:23,748
Town hall, please.

2
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,411
Very good, sir.

3
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,662
It's valuation,
but it's kind of complicated

4
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,872
because part of the property
is outside the boundary.

5
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,165
Is it type one or type two?

6
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,409
- Oh, Mr Barnes.
- I thought it would be Mr Barnes.

7
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:48,455
- Yes, love?
- My name is Lampton, Joe Lampton.

8
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,542
Oh, yes, you're coming to work here,
aren't you?

9
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,082
One moment, please.

10
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,867
I'm sorry, sir,
what were you saying?

11
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,741
Mr Hoylake will see you right away.

12
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,787
My name's Young.
Thanks very much.

13
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,997
Come in.
We didn't expect you until Monday.

14
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:20,958
Sit down.

15
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,992
We're not accustomed
to such an excess of zeal.

16
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,242
Well, it's not exactly that,
Mr Hoylake. I...

17
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,539
I'm not surprised that you wanted
to leave Dufdon as soon as possible.

18
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:37,410
You'll find big differences here,
you know? Not only the work.

19
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,374
You'll meet a different class of people.

20
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:43,456
We pride ourselves on being civilised
here in Warnley.

21
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,955
Dufdon's not much of a place, but...

22
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,791
we're not exactly savages there,
you know, Mr Hoylake.

23
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,366
You think not?

24
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,705
Well, what did you come
to see me about?

25
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,074
Well, I thought perhaps...

26
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,658
You see, I have to get fixed up in digs.

27
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,991
You shouldn't have any difficulty.

28
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,244
- Soames.
- 'Yes, sir?'

29
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,537
- You might come in.
- 'Right, Mr Hoylake.'

30
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,121
You'll be working with Soames,
internal audits.

31
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,699
He's got digs somewhere near Top.

32
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,667
Top's the fashionable district.

33
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,328
He's very comfortable, I believe.

34
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,994
Come in.

35
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,956
Charles Soames, Joe Lampton.
Lampton's the new man.

36
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,415
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

37
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:34,000
He hasn't got anywhere to live.
Can you help him?

38
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,241
Oh, I think so.

39
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,249
I'll leave it to you, then.

40
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,207
We'll have a long session later on.

41
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,201
I'll keep an hour
on Monday morning for you.

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,162
This is it.
And that's your desk.

43
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:48,249
Well, he didn't keep you long
in the firing line.

44
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,367
Joe, this is Miss Samson,
better known as June.

45
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,459
Joe Lampton, latest addition
to Treasurer's Department chain gang.

46
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,165
I think I'm going
to enjoy my sentence.

47
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,972
I don't mind you enjoying it,
but you don't have to smack your lips.

48
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,329
Got a hot tip, Charles.
Dog in the second race tonight.

49
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,495
- Interested?
- No! But hold on a minute.

50
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,617
Meet new boy Joe Lampton.
Teddy Merrick.

51
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,366
God help you. I got to run.

52
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,020
Well, Charles?
How about those reports?

53
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,996
Oh, aye, Stampton reports.
Now, where did I put them?

54
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,414
Somewhere in here. Have you tried
looking under your skirt?

55
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,659
- What do you mean?
- You're sitting on them, love.

56
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,751
Oh, what a thing
I have to put up with!

57
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,411
Be seeing you.

58
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,499
She belong to us?

59
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,867
Where did you get
that proprietorial plural?

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,457
I meant the Treasurer's Department.

61
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,623
No, she's Health's typist.
We have our own talent.

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,949
Now... digs.

63
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,829
Mabel, would you get me
an outside line?

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,492
No, dear, it's not a personal call.

65
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,208
Look, Mabel,

66
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,559
I don't want to argue with you,
just get me an outside line

67
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,303
or I'll put tuppence in your moral
little slot next time I'm passing.

68
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,410
Constipated bitch! You'd think
she had shares in the corporation.

69
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,791
Warnley 4-3-1-5.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,037
That's not for you, lad.

71
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,287
- But I can look, can't I?
- Not like that, you can't.

72
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,750
There's a law against
undressing women in the street.

73
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,743
Hello, is that you, Mrs Thompson?
Charles Soames here.

74
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,913
I was wondering if I might bring
a Mr Lampton to see you?

75
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,576
We'll be at the house long before that.
Thank you, Mrs Thompson.

76
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,746
Well, that's as good as fixed,
and at the best digs in Warnley, too.

77
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,249
Is that what you really want?

78
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,415
A clerk's dream?
A girl with a Riviera tan and a Lagonda?

79
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,867
That's what I'm going to have.

80
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,662
Come on, let's go.

81
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,205
Nobody ever goes to Dufdon.

82
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,495
They just pass through it.

83
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,582
A Sunday treat of fish and chips,

84
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,041
wrapped in a greasy
"News of the World".

85
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,533
And for chaps like me,

86
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:58,115
prospects as appetising
as yesterday's fish-paste sandwich.

87
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,531
You know, when I was a POW,

88
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,330
at least there was a limit
to the time that you serve,

89
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,576
but Dufdon, that seemed
like a lifetime sentence.

90
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,244
You shouldn't be so nostalgic

91
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,334
on your first day away
from the home fires, you know?

92
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,700
I was looking at your river.

93
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,120
Kids fishing and swimming in it.

94
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:23,287
In Dufdon the canal's like a sewer.

95
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,118
Kids never had a chance
to fish or swim, and the people...

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,458
well, I suppose
they never had a chance either.

97
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,499
And somehow here,

98
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,948
well, it's so different.

99
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,540
You wouldn't believe it, Charles.

100
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:45,412
But you make Warnley sound
so special, Joe, so very special.

101
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,285
It is special. It's not Dufdon.

102
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,125
Not everybody admires
the view from here.

103
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,540
Look, Joe, there's the Top.
That's where the money is.

104
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,205
Lots of lovely houses up there,
you know, Joe.

105
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,541
I'll have one of those.

106
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,159
- I'm going to have the lot.
- Oh, no, you're not!

107
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,285
Not in local government you're not.
Did you ever work it out, brother?

108
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,830
In 20 years' time
you could be sitting in Hoylake's chair.

109
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,290
That's as high as you can go.

110
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,662
And that means Â£1,000 a year,

111
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,580
a semi-detached downtown,
a second-hand Austin

112
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,393
and a wife to match,
if you know what I mean.

113
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:21,411
I know damn well what you mean.
That's why I'm going to have the lot.

114
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,750
Oh, no.

115
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,709
Oh, by the way, what do you do
for entertainment around here?

116
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,325
Well, there are the flicks, of course.

117
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,825
Teddy Merrick and I play snooker
on Friday nights.

118
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,290
- Do you play?
- Badly.

119
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,376
Oh, and then we have our amateur
dramatic society, the "Thespians".

120
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,742
- Are you interested in the theatre?
- Yes.

121
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,743
Look, it's only two weeks away.

122
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,041
And Charlie Soames here,
being a power among the Thespians,

123
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,454
can probably still get
you a ticket for opening night.

124
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,496
- And then he went back to bed?
- Yes.

125
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,618
- To his own bed?
- Val, what's wrong with you?

126
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,872
Did you really think I wouldn't know
the minute I saw you two together?

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,207
There's nothing to know.

128
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,201
Val, I've no idea
what you're talking about.

129
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,203
You're all upset.

130
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,791
I certainly am upset!
I happen to be...

131
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:07,917
Who is she?

132
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,908
You should have seen her
in "The Playground".

133
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,788
Sex, terrific.

134
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,829
Alice Aisgill. She's French.

135
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,284
That's her husband, lucky devil,
at the end of the front row.

136
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:22,286
- Val, let's stop this.
- I'll stop it when I get the truth.

137
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,035
Till then I refuse to go to the courtroom.

138
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,703
You can't do that to him.

139
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,120
But she's not married,
she couldn't be.

140
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,912
He means Susan.

141
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,034
- Oh, Susan Brown.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,204
She's the daughter
of old millionaire Brown.

143
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,620
He owns most of Warnley.

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,912
- Have a jujube.
- Thanks.

145
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,874
Joe, don't waste your time.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,959
Susan's out of your reach,
way up in the top drawer.

147
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,416
Speaks as if she had a couple
of hot potatoes in her mouth,

148
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,080
as if her finishing school
hadn't quite finished with her.

149
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,450
Hello, June. Hello Teddy.
Didn't you think she was super?

150
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,326
I don't know who you're talking about,
but I thought she was super.

151
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,041
This is Joe Lampton. Didn't you think
she was absolutely super?

152
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,001
- Oh, absolutely super.
- I thought you were all absolutely super!

153
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,805
Well, children?
What was it like out front?

154
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,875
- Where's June?
- There she is, talking to Bernard,

155
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,203
the foolish virgin.

156
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,013
- What did you think, Joe?
- It wasn't bad.

157
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:16,535
Oh, damning us with faint praise!
Come and meet some of the company.

158
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,829
I want you to meet Alice Aisgill,
our leading lady.

159
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,915
- Alice, this is Joe Lampton.
- How do you do?

160
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,749
How do you do?
You're new here, aren't you?

161
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,241
I've been here a couple of weeks.

162
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,559
- He's in our department.
- It's Susan Joe wants to meet.

163
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,449
- He's got a thing for Susan.
- Hey, Bernard!

164
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,245
Come and meet Bernard,
our producer.

165
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,287
Bernard, this is Joe Lampton.
Hello, June.

166
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,453
How do you do?

167
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,575
What did you think
of Charles's dawn effect, June?

168
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,199
It came up like thunder.

169
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,199
That's the trouble
with these literal minds.

170
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,825
The playwright's instructions said
"crack of dawn".

171
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,165
That's exactly what we got.

172
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,409
It was a damn good dawn.
You both know it.

173
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,033
Says you!

174
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,874
Come on, Joe.

175
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,912
Hello, Charles. Was I terrible?

176
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,114
You were very good, as a matter of fact.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

177
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,708
Joe Lampton, Susan Brown.
He liked the show very much.

178
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,075
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

179
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,575
- Where's Jack?
- Oh, he went to fetch his car.

180
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,825
Oh, Charles, you know that scene,
the love scene?

181
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,684
I tried to remember what Bernard said.
Do you think I did it any better?

182
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,244
You were fine.

183
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,495
Jenny, you don't have to take that home.
We might need it again tomorrow night.

184
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,505
- Why don't you just leave it for Tilly?
- You know, if I'd only known...

185
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,327
- If you'd known what?
- If I'd known you'd be so beautiful,

186
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,162
I would have brought you some flowers.

187
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,124
- There you are, Jack.
- Here I am.

188
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,970
You coming for a drink, darling?
We haven't been properly introduced.

189
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,575
I'm Eva, Eva Kent.
And you're Joe, aren't you?

190
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,074
We're going up to the Clarence.

191
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,074
Jack and I have to go home for dinner.

192
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,915
- Oh, what a pity. Cyril!
- Yes?

193
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,204
Joe this is Cyril.
He's my husband, believe it or not.

194
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,414
Cyril, this is Joe.

195
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,623
- Hello.
- Hello again.

196
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,742
Teddy was telling me about you,
Teddy Merrick.

197
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,411
I hope you're gonna like it here.

198
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,033
I know I am.

199
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,203
You don't beat about the bush, do you?
I should look out if I were you, Jack.

200
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,371
I think you'll find you have a rival
for Susan's lovely hand.

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,616
Joe, this is Jack Wales.

202
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,912
Jack, this is Joe something
from the Treasurer's.

203
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,829
Lampton, Joe Lampton.

204
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,951
You two ought to have a lot in common,
both being intrepid birdmen.

205
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,949
Oh, that. What outfit?

206
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,200
- Wellington's.
- Ah.

207
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,326
- Sergeant Observer, eh?
- Yes, how did you know?

208
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,451
Oh, I can tell.
Didn't you ever get beyond Wellington's?

209
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,031
No, I was shot down early,
spent most of the war in a prison camp.

210
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:28,205
Mm, is that so?
Must have been rough.

211
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,117
- Well, as a matter of fact...
- Come on, Sue.

212
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,833
22:40 precisely.
Operation Supper to begin.

213
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,678
What a stink.
I don't know how you stand it.

214
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,032
- Come on, Sue.
- Do come and have a drink with us first.

215
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,605
We'd love to,
but you know Papa Brown.

216
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,507
He likes you there on the dot.
Some other time.

217
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,916
Good night, all.
Good night, Sergeant.

218
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,534
You must tell me about
your POW experiences,

219
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,875
but some other time.

220
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,287
I'll remember the flowers next time.

221
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,867
Good night... sir!

222
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,079
Fricking officer.

223
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,825
Jack Wales was a POW, too.

224
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,574
He escaped.

225
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,704
- Are you nearly ready, darling?
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,454
Hello, Sergeant.

227
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,119
Shopping for lingerie?

228
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,000
What size are you? 44?

229
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,492
Listen, do me a favour, will you?

230
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,283
I know all about you now.

231
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,205
I know you were a squadron leader
with a distinguished war record,

232
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,246
the DSO and all the rest of it,
but just do me a favour:

233
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,583
the war's over,
stop calling me Sergeant!

234
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,915
I'll try to remember.

235
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,250
But, Sergeant,
you're selling me short.

236
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,742
Didn't anyone tell you about my DFC?

237
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,499
He just stood there,
the chinless wonder,

238
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,708
gloating over her
like a bloody watchdog.

239
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,905
All phony accent, putting on
the squadron-leader act with me.

240
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,658
He even threw the DFC at me.

241
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,160
If we'd done whatever it was he did,
we'd have only got the DFM.

242
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,830
- Just medals, no crosses for us.
- Different brands of courage!

243
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,701
Oh, there's Charlie Sales.
I'll see what he's on.

244
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,914
Here, isn't that Susan's father's works?

245
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,499
Joe, you're wasting your time.

246
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,582
These two families,
the Browns and the Waleses,

247
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,701
they've as much brass
as the rest of Warnley rolled together.

248
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,495
Hey, what do you think of that one?

249
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,207
Mm, not bad,

250
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,915
but not grade one.

251
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,158
What do you mean by that?

252
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:26,080
Time I filled you in
on the Lampton report on love.

253
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,450
I've got a foolproof method
for grading women.

254
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:33,123
Partly money, partly background,
partly J. Lampton's instinct.

255
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,663
- Now, take Susan Brown.
- Are you offering her to me?

256
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,990
No, seriously, Susan is grade one
on every count.

257
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,726
- You just have to look at her to know.
- Susan's not for you, lad.

258
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,434
- It just so happens that I like her.
- You lust after her, you mean.

259
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,495
No, no, no.
It's not that at all.

260
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,743
Well, it's partly that,
but not just that.

261
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,368
You see, she's so, well...
she's so wholesome.

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,116
Do you think
you'd find her as wholesome

263
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,617
if her old man didn't have
a million in the bank?

264
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,037
There are plenty of other
wholesome girls in Warnley.

265
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,749
Like who? Like June?

266
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,366
Yes, like June.

267
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,662
Have you got you some kind
of understanding with her?

268
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,249
Me? Lord, no!

269
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,833
June's a good kid,
but she's got an invalid mother.

270
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,449
And they live off June's salary

271
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,542
so whoever marries June
marries an invalid mother, too.

272
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:19,241
What you and me should be looking for
is a nice girl with no ties

273
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,288
and a nice family business
in the background, a shop even.

274
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,491
Joe! Two, track two.
We got four to one.

275
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,082
What are you on?

276
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,282
Grade one. I put my two bob
on grade one every time.

277
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,369
Two number two to win, please.

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,992
How about that baby?

279
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,208
That one? She's grade ten.

280
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,413
Grades nine and over only indulge
on Saturday nights.

281
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,980
You want to keep
miles away from them.

282
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,328
Hello. Four to win, please.

283
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,951
Now, grades one like my girl,
they're something really special in bed.

284
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,824
They've almost nothing else to do.

285
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,371
- One to win, please.
- Come on, Joe, there's the bell.

286
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,495
That Brown, he must coin it, you know?

287
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,582
All those chimneys, that's money.

288
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,906
Beautiful, beautiful brass, belching out
every minute of the day and night.

289
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:05,455
- Come on.
- You know, Charles, I've been thinking.

290
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,666
- About that dramatic club.
- Well?

291
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,660
Remember you said you needed men,
fresh blood and all that?

292
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,454
- Did you mean it?
- I certainly did.

293
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,540
Well, I don't know
if I'll be any good, mind,

294
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,283
- but I'd like to try.
- Oh, I get it.

295
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,329
You're not interested in dramatics,
it's Susan.

296
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,246
Oh, I know.
"You're wasting your time, Joe."

297
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,309
- Do you want to bet on it?
- Did somebody say bet?

298
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,393
I'll bet you never get
the length of a date with her.

299
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,500
- A dollar on it then.
- Right, then. Cut it.

300
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,124
Hello, Susan.

301
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,833
Hello.

302
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,871
You know, I never seem
to get a chance to speak to you.

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,287
And, well, I only joined the club
because of you

304
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,785
and now, well, I hear
you're not even in the new play.

305
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,330
Somebody else has to have a chance.
It's only fair.

306
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,121
- Gwen is awfully good.
- Quiet, please!

307
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,741
- Damn!
- Quiet, everyone.

308
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,573
- What are you doing after rehearsal?
- We've got a party at home tonight.

309
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,870
Jack's coming to collect me.
He'll be here any minute.

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,414
- I thought he was back at Cambridge.
- Oh, he came for the weekend.

311
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,249
Come on, Joe.

312
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,038
Now, er... Same positions.
Come on, Joe, we're wasting time.

313
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,578
Take your coat off.

314
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,079
Come on, Joe, speed it up.
Up to the top of the sofa.

315
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,201
Alice, love, I want to go from the scene
where you defend your lover.

316
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,950
It's the top of page 12.
Now, stand there.

317
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,200
There we are.
"I don't see why..."

318
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,246
Don't forget, love, there's the audience.
Push it right out.

319
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,583
Now, from when I say go.

320
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,199
Ready?

321
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,665
Right!

322
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't see why.

323
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,708
He didn't even know my late husband.

324
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,871
I assure you, Inspector,
he has nothing to do with it.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,287
He's something to do
with you, though, hasn't he?

326
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,034
- Really?
- Just what do you mean by that?

327
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:43,160
I meant you're a friend of hers, sir.
You are, aren't you?

328
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,500
I tell you, I didn't see anything.

329
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,208
It was pitch dark
and the only sign of life

330
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,656
was this old workman
or nightwatchman

331
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,203
sitting by his brassiere.

332
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,200
B-Brazier.

333
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,414
What a wonderful thought.
Erotic vices among the working class.

334
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,573
Let me tell you,
I am working class.

335
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,950
- I didn't mean...
- Working class and proud of it!

336
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,415
You're nothing of the sort!

337
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:28,661
You're a stockbroker and Alice's lover
and suspected of murder in the play.

338
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,705
Now, shut up, the lot of you.
We'll start again.

339
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,790
When you come to say,
"What's the point?"

340
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:37,285
I want you to make a turn,
a half-turn towards the window.

341
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:56,786
Yes, it was funny.

342
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,285
- I didn't mean to snap at you.
- Oh, forget it.

343
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,952
- Will you have a coffee with me?
- No, but you may buy me a drink.

344
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,201
- Can you drive?
- Yes, oddly enough.

345
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,448
Of course, I never owned a car,
but I learned to drive in the RAF.

346
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,289
Here.

347
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,665
You're very touchy, aren't you?

348
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,494
- Where to?
- To the St Clair. It's quiet.

349
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,450
That's the Browns' place.

350
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,291
Yes, I know. I walked past it.

351
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,208
Hmm, they seem
to have something on tonight.

352
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,666
Susan told me
they were having a party.

353
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:03,035
What a place! It's like a castle.

354
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:06,659
Charles tells me
they've even got a swimming pool.

355
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,242
They've got just about everything,
haven't they?

356
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,249
I wouldn't say that.

357
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,952
I thought you were coming
the lady of the mansion over me.

358
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,656
My father didn't own
an engineering works or a mill.

359
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,125
He never even owned his own house.

360
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,869
But that doesn't mean I can't drive a car
or pronounce bra... brazier.

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,117
But who cares about these things?

362
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,082
Some people do.

363
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,540
It's Susan, isn't it?

364
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,704
That's what's bothering you.

365
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,870
It's Jack Wales really.

366
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,413
That type, they make me mad.

367
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:48,785
The boys with the big mouths
and the silver spoon stuck in them.

368
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:53,161
They think they can take everything
worth having by a sort of divine right.

369
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,125
Calling me Sergeant!

370
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,661
It is Susan.

371
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,250
- Alf, can we have the same again?
- Right, Mrs Aisgill.

372
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,375
You're jealous.

373
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,957
I suppose I am.

374
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,365
Well, why don't you phone the girl
and ask her to go out with you, then?

375
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,915
Why don't you?

376
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:17,366
You feel inferior to Jack Wales?

377
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,241
No, I don't.

378
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:26,623
I've a feeling, and I know I'm right.
I know she doesn't want him.

379
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,992
I suppose you think I'm conceited.

380
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,826
Young and terribly inexperienced.

381
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,116
But not conceited.

382
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,914
Well, if that's the way
you really feel about her,

383
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:43,954
then you must be right.

384
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,576
Your trouble is
you don't believe enough in yourself.

385
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,162
I'll tell you something, Alice.

386
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,078
I like you.

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,663
I don't mean sex, I mean "like" you.

388
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,040
I like to talk to you.

389
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,457
I just like you.

390
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:12,286
You look about 18 sometimes.
Do you know that?

391
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,369
You remind me of a boy I used to know
at the university in Paris.

392
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,667
It must be funny being French
here in Warnley.

393
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:29,748
No.

394
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,870
It's not funny.

395
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,745
Are you very unhappy, Alice?

396
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,207
Not very.

397
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,120
Come on.

398
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:57,831
- Susan, there's a telephone call for you.
- Oh, damn. Who is it?

399
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,996
It's a gentleman.
I think he said Mr Lampton.

400
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,039
What will I tell him?

401
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,126
- Oh, it's all right, Mary. I'll take it.
- Very well, Miss Susan.

402
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,916
Hello? Susan Brown.

403
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,787
Oh, hello, Joe.
I didn't know it was you.

404
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,412
Saturday evening?
I'd love to, but...

405
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,661
Hold on a minute.

406
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,996
Hello, Joe?
I've just looked up in my book

407
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,368
and I've got another engagement
on Saturday.

408
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,583
Yes, I'd love to some other time.

409
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,791
Gosh, here's Mummy. Bye!

410
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,785
- Who was that telephoning, Susan?
- Joe Lampton.

411
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,000
- I met him at the Thespians.
- What did he want?

412
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,037
He wanted to take me
to the cinema on Saturday.

413
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,750
But we don't know him, do we?
Socially, I mean.

414
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,333
Oh, I don't suppose so.
He works at the town hall.

415
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,458
Really!

416
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,291
Oh, it's all right, Mummy,
I told him I had a previous appointment.

417
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,205
But only because I had.
He's very nice really.

418
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:01,247
- What did you say his name was?
- Lampton, Joe Lampton.

419
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,617
Curious names
some of these people have.

420
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,579
Listen, Alice, tell me,

421
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:10,247
well, supposing you were a girl,
I mean a young girl,

422
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,243
and I asked you out,
I mean, would you hang up in a hurry

423
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,207
just because your mother
came into the room?

424
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,620
Look, Joe,
if I had a mother like Mrs Brown,

425
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,333
I would hang up in a great hurry
whenever she came into the room.

426
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,165
Aren't you two coming?
Where's Charles?

427
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:24,033
He'll be over in a minute.

428
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,830
I still think she was trying
to give me the brush-off.

429
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,998
Well, supposing she was?
Keep trying, call her again.

430
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,583
- Do you really mean it?
- Of course.

431
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,744
Why not?

432
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,906
Oh, while I'm handing out advice,

433
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,079
do you mind if I tell you
about our last scene,

434
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,540
the bedroom one?

435
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,458
Oh, I know, I...
I made a muck of it.

436
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,574
You're not frightened of me, are you?

437
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:51,958
No.

438
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,791
Well, you must take hold of me
as if you meant it.

439
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:58,079
I'm not fragile, you know?
I won't break.

440
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,583
I'll try, Alice.

441
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,824
Is it so difficult?

442
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:10,706
Another bitter, a gin and tonic
and two gins and lime.

443
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,825
- Have you got any crisps?
- I think so, sir.

444
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,708
Hello, Alice.
I was just telling them about Gwen.

445
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,473
Bernard and I were talking to her
after the rehearsal the other day

446
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:23,532
and she said, "I'd take him on myself,
but I can't bear bandy-legged men."

447
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,245
Good evening.
Bernard said you'd be here.

448
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:32,034
Hello, George.
This is a surprise.

449
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,749
It's not a social call.

450
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,574
- I think you know everybody.
- I think so.

451
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,542
And of course this is Joe Lampton,
my lover in the play.

452
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,579
The war hero.

453
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,542
Well, I'm always glad
to meet one of Alice's lovers.

454
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,535
Let me have the keys, will you?
I've got to take the CitroÃ«n.

455
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,579
- Why?
- My ignition's gone

456
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,995
and I've got to get
over to Leeds tonight.

457
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,366
So late?

458
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,787
Something cropped up unexpectedly.

459
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,499
I'll be away a couple of days.

460
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,574
But, er...

461
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,041
What about the car for tomorrow?

462
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,625
What about it?

463
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,289
You know I was going to take Elspeth
to Manchester to the ballet.

464
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,704
You know I arranged it weeks ago.

465
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:20,448
Well, you'll just have to make it
some other time, won't you?

466
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,700
Enjoy yourselves, everybody.

467
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,249
Good night, dear.

468
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:37,285
I thought you said you were going
to be word-perfect tonight.

469
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,457
- I thought I were till I got on stage.
- Bernard...

470
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,207
You know what that means?

471
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,620
A couple of days'
hard labour with his secretary.

472
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,242
Yeah. Darn shame.

473
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,369
Shall I see you home?

474
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,789
No.

475
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,125
Alice, I hate to see you hurt.

476
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,832
I'm not hurt.

477
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,450
You sure you don't want me
to take you home?

478
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,074
I'd like to.

479
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,449
I'd rather not.

480
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,324
Good night, Joe.

481
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,620
- Joe!
- Shh!

482
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,208
What are you doing here?
I was just thinking about you.

483
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,665
You were?

484
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:09,284
I was thinking about you
when I passed the town hall

485
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,033
and the thought stuck on.

486
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,740
Like a hangover?
What were you thinking about me?

487
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,709
Nothing exactly.
What are you doing here?

488
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:21,372
Oh, I often come down here
to do the library accounts.

489
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:23,994
You know, Susan...

490
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,120
...you're looking very pretty.

491
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,037
Thank you kindly, sir.

492
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,658
Do you think this is any good?

493
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,792
I wanted the new Bates,
but there's a waiting list.

494
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,368
If you could wait for about ten minutes,
we can go and have coffee together.

495
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,742
I can't, I'm meeting my mother for lunch.

496
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:44,448
Oh, well... they tell me
there's a very good film on at the Regal.

497
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,119
The musical? Super!

498
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,250
- Have you seen it?
- No.

499
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,476
- Would you like to go?
- Yes.

500
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,832
When?

501
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,742
- Oh.
- You know, Susan...

502
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,618
...you're not only pretty,
you're beautiful.

503
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:03,869
Tonight, then.

504
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,583
Oh, tonight will do
like no other night has ever done.

505
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,083
I'll pick you up at your house,
at seven o'clock.

506
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,791
No, I'd rather meet you there.

507
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,159
Seven o'clock at the Regal.

508
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,413
Seven o'clock, then, at the Regal.

509
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,199
- Charles!
- Yeah?

510
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,040
- Charles, lend me a quid.
- What for?

511
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,284
- Come on, I'm late. I'll explain later.
- All right.

512
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,033
Hurry up, man! Thank you.

513
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,910
By the way, do you remember
that bet I made you the other day?

514
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,954
- Which one?
- At the dog track, remember?

515
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,826
Well, you've lost,
so I only owe you 15 bob.

516
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,950
- No!
- Yes!

517
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,781
You know, you're the sort of girl
I like to take out.

518
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,658
- Why?
- Well...

519
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,626
there's your shape
and your size and...

520
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,083
the sheen in your hair,

521
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,450
a sort of light in your eyes.

522
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:02,281
Oh, but... most important
because I think you're a dear kipper.

523
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:05,125
- A what?
- A dear kipper.

524
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,832
What a lovely word!
What does it mean?

525
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,416
My mother called me that
every time I asked her for something

526
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,205
that cost more than she could afford.

527
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,746
I'd like to meet your mother.
She sounds fun.

528
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,741
She's dead.

529
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,703
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,701
My mother and my father
were both killed in an air raid.

531
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,541
I don't even know
if it was an air raid.

532
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,626
The only bombs ever
to have dropped on Dufdon.

533
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,742
Probably by mistake.

534
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:37,001
Anyhow, they...
they had to fall on our house.

535
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,617
Joe, how awful for you!

536
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,662
I'm terribly sorry.

537
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,075
It's all right.

538
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:48,076
It happened a long time ago.

539
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,531
- Evening! Aren't you gonna offer me a drink?
- Jack!

540
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:54,705
I thought you were washing
your hair tonight. Waiter!

541
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,040
You're not a hairdresser, too?

542
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,454
No, I'm not a hairdresser
and I'm not your bloody batman.

543
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,915
A large Scotch for me, please.

544
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:02,204
- Don't let us keep you.
- Not at all, it's a pleasure.

545
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,213
As a matter of fact, I've wanted
to have a chat with you for a long time,

546
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,869
about your acting actually.

547
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,993
I think you have
distinct comic possibilities.

548
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,661
Don't you agree, Susan?

549
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,661
If you'll excuse me...

550
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:21,031
If I live to be 100, Jack,
I'll never forgive you for this.

551
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:23,910
I thought you were going
to wash your hair tonight.

552
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,367
Well, I don't know
who you think you're dealing with,

553
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,492
but you can take that away for a start.

554
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,288
I want to build an administration block,
not a ladies' lavatory.

555
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:37,206
We make machine tools at Brown's,
remember? Not silk stockings.

556
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,791
You should never have let
this young man get so far with it.

557
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,115
I only saw a sketch, Mr Brown.
It looked very handsome.

558
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,833
You come back tomorrow
with some designs that I can use

559
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:48,416
or don't bother to come back at all,
either of you.

560
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:49,749
Go on, get out!

561
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,333
Miss Fisher!
What's happened to that London call?

562
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,745
- 'It's engaged, sir.'
- Will you try the other number?

563
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,788
- I must get those shares on the market.
- 'Very good, sir.'

564
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,948
- Hello. What are you two doing here?
- Susan's just told me she's going out.

565
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,826
- I want you to tell her not to.
- Oh, why?

566
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,291
For one thing, we have guests
and it will upset my table.

567
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:11,330
For another,
it's that Joe Lampton again.

568
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,166
Can't you put him off for once, Susan,
just to please your mother?

569
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,828
No, I can't.

570
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,199
It isn't just tonight.

571
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,371
Mother doesn't like him.
She doesn't think he's suitable.

572
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,208
Do you?

573
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,620
I don't know about suitable,
but I like him.

574
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,582
He calls me "a dear kipper".

575
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,790
A what?

576
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,409
You explain to Mother, Daddy.
I'm sure you know.

577
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:35,035
Goodbye, I'm late, and don't be cross.
You know I love you both.

578
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,205
That doesn't get me anywhere
with my dinner party.

579
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,832
Why didn't you stop her?

580
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,878
Stopping her from seeing this young man
isn't the way to put an end to it.

581
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,540
Then what is?

582
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,956
Or don't you mind her getting mixed up
with a small-town nobody?

583
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,996
Small-town nobodies
sometimes do well enough.

584
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,833
You saw nought wrong
with one once, Mother.

585
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,416
I happen to be Susan's mother,
not yours.

586
00:33:58,542 --> 00:33:59,999
Now, listen,

587
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,368
will you stop bothering your head
about Joe Lampton

588
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,616
and just leave it to me?

589
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,036
Get me the town hall.

590
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:11,007
I have a minute or two.
I thought we might have a little chat.

591
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,700
You've picked up the work very quickly.

592
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,905
- Six months now, isn't it?
- Not quite.

593
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:20,456
You're a bright lad, Lampton,
and you've also a lot of sense.

594
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:26,115
Sense enough, I'm sure, not to resent
what I'm going to say to you.

595
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:30,827
This is a small town, Lampton.
I've lived in it all my life.

596
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,915
I know the people,
I know their business.

597
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:36,831
Councillor Brown, for instance,
I went to school with him.

598
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,410
You know, of course, he's chairman
of the establishment committee.

599
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:44,786
- Yes, but I don't quite see...
- He's a powerful man, Lampton.

600
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,156
That engineering works of his,
built it up from nothing.

601
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:51,750
Now it's the biggest
of its kind in Warnley.

602
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,082
Ruthless!

603
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,746
Well, I suppose you've got
to be ruthless in business.

604
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,537
He knows what he wants
and he gets it.

605
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,750
He can drive a coach-and-four
through that committee

606
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,457
anytime he wants.

607
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,787
Every council's the same.

608
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,876
There's always one strong man,

609
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,574
a danger man
as far as the officials are concerned.

610
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,826
Mind you, no matter how influential
any councillor may be,

611
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:19,781
he can't touch our jobs,
he can't downgrade us.

612
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:24,036
But when it comes to promotion,
there's the rub.

613
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,454
That's a different matter.

614
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,121
- You follow me, Joe?
- I follow you.

615
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,832
I thought you would.

616
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:34,743
Do you mind if I give you
a word of advice, Joe?

617
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,662
It's this.

618
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:41,241
- Find a girl, a girl of your own...
- Class? Is that what you mean?

619
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,741
A girl of my own class?

620
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,413
Well, let's say background.

621
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,580
Plenty of nice girls in Warnley,
pretty ones, too.

622
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:55,291
You find the right kind of girl, Joe,
you'll go a long way here in Warnley.

623
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:00,580
You wouldn't believe it!
Who the hell he thinks he is,

624
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,166
sitting there like Al Capone
putting the finger on me!

625
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:06,660
Oh, I got the works, the chairman
of the establishment committee.

626
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,626
As neat a job of blackmail
as you ever saw.

627
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,584
"You follow me, Joe?"
Yes, he even called me Joe.

628
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,108
"If you don't leave Susan alone,
there will be no promotion."

629
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,368
I told you months ago,
I warned you, she's not for you!

630
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:19,830
Another couple of minutes,
I would have taken his promotion

631
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,166
and shoved it up his... waistcoat.

632
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:25,706
- Fares, please.
- Two to Warnley Theatre, please.

633
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,824
What's the matter?

634
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,699
Nothing.

635
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,040
Just mood.

636
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,791
I have bad moods sometimes.

637
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,701
- Don't you?
- Damnable moods.

638
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,916
Take today for instance.

639
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:58,915
Here.

640
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,911
You need a drink.

641
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,082
No.

642
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:11,250
You want me to drive you home?

643
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,158
No.

644
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:17,956
- I'd like to go to Sparrow Hill.
- It's cold up there.

645
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,870
That's what I want.

646
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,583
Somewhere cold and clean.

647
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:26,156
With no people, no dirty people.

648
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,575
- Something going on there?
- Well, you know Alice.

649
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,744
Don't be catty, darling.

650
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,117
Alice is a very charming
and very long-suffering person.

651
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,242
Alice is all woman.

652
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,491
George is away for the weekend.

653
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,992
He is often away for weekends.

654
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,493
- How did you meet him?
- I was a teacher,

655
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,833
what you call an exchange teacher.

656
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:09,077
I came over for one year in '37
and I met George.

657
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,041
Can't imagine you as a teacher.

658
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:20,204
I was a good teacher.

659
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,162
Oh, Alice!

660
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,915
Don't say anything.

661
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,701
This is a very moral kind of a girl.

662
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,915
Morning, Charles.

663
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:10,455
I don't understand this.
I hardly know the man.

664
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:18,332
Hmm, seems a good job,
and in Dufdon.

665
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,077
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I don't know. See him, I suppose.

666
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,246
Chances are, my days at the Treasurer's
Department are numbered anyway.

667
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,412
Oh, don't be daft!

668
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,791
Why don't you look at it
as a free trip home.

669
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:33,000
Home? My home's a bombsite.

670
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,082
This is my house.

671
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,203
It's my house.

672
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,491
It used to be mine, too.

673
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,037
I lived here once upon a time.

674
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,787
A bomb fell from the sky.

675
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,579
I know.

676
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,370
Do you want to see my garden?

677
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,039
Aye.

678
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,039
Look!

679
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,535
Oh, they're pretty.
What are they called?

680
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,829
Flowers. They're called flowers.

681
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:41,951
Ethel? Ethel, come here at once.

682
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,665
My mother.

683
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,328
At once, Ethel.

684
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,245
Come here at once.

685
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:51,000
If I've told you once,
I've told you a dozen times.

686
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,582
- You must be new here.
- No.

687
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,791
But you weren't here
in the old days.

688
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:57,625
- I was just looking at the house.
- Go on, into the house!

689
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,458
I just don't like her
talking to strangers, that's all.

690
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,199
But I'm not really a stranger.

691
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,746
- Vera!
- All right, all right.

692
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,742
- Uncle Nat.
- Is that you, Joe?

693
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,036
Yes, Auntie.

694
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:55,535
Come and tell us all about it.
Did you see Mr Darnley? Was he nice?

695
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,704
I haven't seen him yet.
My appointment's for four.

696
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:01,247
Oh, well, that's fine.
I've just made tea.

697
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:04,868
It's nice to have you back,
just like old times.

698
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,287
Nat can move in with Ruben.

699
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:10,410
Then you can have
your own room back.

700
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,158
Window's all right.

701
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,911
Your cousin finally stirred himself
and mended that broken pane.

702
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,621
Here, we've...
we've missed you, lad.

703
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:26,164
It's right grand
to have you back home again.

704
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,909
I'm not sure if I'm going
to take that job, Auntie.

705
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,707
Why ever not?

706
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,366
Well...

707
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,744
- It isn't that I wasn't happy here.
- I know that.

708
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,161
Good and thick.

709
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:46,955
Aye, so that the spoon stands up in it.

710
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,579
Well, it's just that...

711
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,246
Warnley's a different kind of a town.

712
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,492
There's a different sort of people.

713
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,457
Got a girl, Joe?

714
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,291
- Aye, I have.
- Go on.

715
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:03,875
Hear that, Nat?

716
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,617
Her name's Susan, Susan Brown.

717
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,163
Go on, you great lummocks!

718
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:14,415
She's... Well, she's sort of special,
you know?

719
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:17,990
Her father owns a factory.
He's on the council.

720
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,082
Warnley Council, that is.

721
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,250
Sounds like lot of brass.

722
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,537
Aye, he's rolling in money.

723
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,448
You know, this is the first right cup of tea
I've had since I've left here.

724
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,413
I asked you about the girl

725
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:39,365
and all you tell me
is about her father and his brass.

726
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,744
Joe, you wouldn't sell yourself
for a handful of silver.

727
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:46,703
You know I wouldn't do that.

728
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,491
Money marries money, lad.

729
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:54,164
What's the good of a girl like that to you?
She'll only break your heart.

730
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,583
Stick to your own people, Joe.

731
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,997
Oh, that's old-fashioned,
all that class stuff.

732
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,333
Things have changed since the war.

733
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,203
If I want her, I'll have her.

734
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:10,156
You sure it's the girl you want, Joe,
not the brass?

735
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,375
What's wrong with wanting both?

736
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,330
I'm as good as the next man.

737
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:20,622
I'm entitled to be in love with any girl.

738
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,788
You may or you may not.

739
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:26,455
I don't know about that.

740
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:29,781
But you're not entitled
to be in love with her money, lad.

741
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:34,576
Where are you going?
You haven't finished your tea.

742
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,995
If I don't hurry, I'll be late.

743
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,450
I haven't made up me mind yet.

744
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,290
If the money's good...

745
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,993
well, I'll see
what Mr Darnley has to say.

746
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,492
Well, I daresay
this automation is a good thing,

747
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,116
but I must have it proved to me.

748
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,458
I must break even within four years.

749
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,451
Aye, but that's your problem.
Well, lad, what do you say?

750
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:07,499
I'd like to think about it, Mr Darnley.

751
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,491
You staying here in Dufdon?

752
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,082
Just for the weekend, at my aunt's.

753
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,495
Aye, well, 24 hours should be enough.

754
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:14,991
Ring me tomorrow.

755
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:18,448
I remember your father well.
He was a good man was Lampton.

756
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,745
Worked here for 35 years.

757
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,912
Ey, that meeting. Late already.

758
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:25,329
- Harry will show you out.
- Goodbye, sir.

759
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:28,659
Kind of old Darnley
to think of me for that job.

760
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:31,956
Well, lad, let's say
you come highly recommended.

761
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:34,875
Oh?

762
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,823
You've got a powerful friend in Mr Brown.
He's praised you to the skies, I'm told.

763
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,823
We do a lot of business
with his firm in Warnley.

764
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,289
Something wrong?

765
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,411
No.

766
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,625
Tell your boss
I've gone back to Warnley.

767
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:03,041
- Yes, but I'm afraid she's not...
- Who is it, Mary?

768
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,749
It's that Mr Lampton, madam.

769
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,787
Oh, I'll take it.

770
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:09,409
- Yes, madam.
- Thank you.

771
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:13,159
Hello, this is Susan's mother.

772
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,750
Oh, can I speak to Susan, please?

773
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,709
No, I'm afraid you can't.
She's in the south of France.

774
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,449
Can you tell me
where I could write to her?

775
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:25,873
I'm afraid I can't give you her address.
You see, she's touring.

776
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:29,542
- 'But thank you for calling, Mr...'
- Lampton!

777
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,660
And thank you again
for being so very kind to Susan.

778
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:35,750
- 'Goodbye.'
- Goodbye!

779
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,094
Charles, you wouldn't believe it.
They're playing right into my hands.

780
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,245
They've sent her away
and they're scared of me.

781
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:52,368
Watch out! Do you want me to drop
these unspeakably delicious sausages?

782
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Me!

783
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:58,040
- Who has sent who away?
- Susan of course! Susan's parents.

784
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,784
How can people get to be so stupid?

785
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,449
All I have to do now is sit under the tree
and wait for the apple to drop.

786
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,543
For a chap who's been separated
from his lady love

787
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,283
you don't seem
to be taking it very hard.

788
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:13,285
Why should I care?
I've got compensations

789
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,082
Come on, eat.

790
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,492
Oh, darling, it's late.

791
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,995
And Elspeth will be here in a minute.

792
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,119
Come on.

793
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:44,499
Put that on.

794
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,666
Oh, you are...

795
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,954
- What's that Yorkshire word?
- Insattable.

796
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,369
That's it.

797
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,832
That's what you are.

798
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,995
Old Man Insattable.

799
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:59,371
- You want coffee?
- Tea.

800
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,583
Poor Elspeth.

801
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:05,281
She lends us her flat
and we pinch all her food.

802
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:12,239
You know, I hate you
to put your clothes on.

803
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,951
It's very sweet of you, honey,
but I'm too old to walk about in my girdle.

804
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,416
- Oh, you're not old.
- Oh, yes, I am.

805
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,249
Much older than you.

806
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:25,992
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

807
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:28,959
I'm 25 and I've had
a lot of experience.

808
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,574
I'm sure you have.

809
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:33,667
Well, my love,
you're very old and very mature.

810
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:35,789
You know, I...

811
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,333
I never dreamed
it could ever be like this.

812
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:44,324
So good.

813
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,075
There never was anyone
so good to me before.

814
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,661
I'm alive now.

815
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:53,704
All of me is alive.

816
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,950
It hurts sometimes,

817
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,665
but I don't care.

818
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,708
Why did you marry him?

819
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,665
Let's not talk about that.

820
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,166
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

821
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,875
Iron Guts they used to call me.

822
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,539
Well, take these through,
will you, Iron Guts?

823
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,374
- And the pickles.
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>

824
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,287
I'll cut some bread.

825
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,871
Oh, I cut my finger.

826
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,870
I'm all right.

827
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,333
I like you doing things for me.

828
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,575
I like doing things for you.

829
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,458
Anything.

830
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,499
- I'll go and get the tea.
- No.

831
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,495
It's so good for me.

832
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,790
Is it good for you, too?

833
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:17,874
I can't tell you how good.

834
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,037
Elspeth!

835
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,874
Don't be so bourgeois!

836
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:25,034
- Hello, Elspeth.
- Oh, hello, dears.

837
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,578
I hope I haven't disturbed you.

838
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,826
I do try and be discreet,
but I had to come in.

839
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:33,076
- It was cold outside.
- I've made you some tea.

840
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,074
- Hello, Elspeth.
- What an afternoon I've had.

841
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,325
Voice production, my goodness!

842
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,324
Some of those girls...

843
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:43,031
I don't know why they ever went in
for this sort of thing, I don't, really.

844
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:46,740
âª Don't put your daughter on the stage,
Mrs Worthington... âª

845
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,413
If you're gonna give us a concert,
you'd better have some food.

846
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,953
Oh, lovely, dear.

847
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,954
You're a lucky young man, Joe.

848
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,996
Alice is an angel, a perfect angel.
Heart of gold.

849
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:58,366
Cigarette?

850
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,664
Of course, I don't blame her.
You're the sort of man I like.

851
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:04,250
Too many pansies about these days.

852
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:06,583
I knew a lot of real men once.

853
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:09,906
They're all dead now
and a little mess like me carries on.

854
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:14,286
Do you love Alice?

855
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:16,869
Yes.

856
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,957
I thought so.

857
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:24,490
She's crazy about you.
You know that, I suppose.

858
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:27,909
She doesn't know it herself yet.

859
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,578
Don't hurt her, Joe.

860
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,119
Don't ever hurt her.

861
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,911
No, I wouldn't hurt her.

862
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,790
I hope not.

863
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,574
- It's for you, Joe.
- Thank you, Charles.

864
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,789
Come on!

865
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,290
- We've made it.
- Aye!

866
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:15,250
"Having a wonderful time.

867
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:17,116
"Missing Warnley a lot."

868
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,491
Huh!

869
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,708
Dear Susan!
Imaginative, isn't she?

870
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,450
You know what that means?
Missing you.

871
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,370
And she's put the address on again.

872
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,913
That can only mean one thing:
she wants you to write to her.

873
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:29,624
- Well, I'm not going to.
- Why not?

874
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,662
Well, one reason is
because she expects me to.

875
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,909
Second, because
I wouldn't know what to write.

876
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:38,370
You're getting pretty keen
on Alice, aren't you?

877
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,162
You worry me, Joe.
You can't do it.

878
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:43,251
You can't run two women,
not in a town this size.

879
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,037
Do you ever think of George Aisgill?

880
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:47,033
- No. Why should I?
- Because he's dangerous.

881
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:48,703
Dangerous? Aisgill? Come on!

882
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:52,782
If he ever goes after you,
well, God help you, that's all I say.

883
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,283
Come on.

884
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:44,039
Darling...
Will you tell me something?

885
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:46,500
- Will you?
- What, love?

886
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:50,869
Supposing you had met me
when I was ten years younger,

887
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,832
would you have taken me seriously?

888
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,699
You know I would.

889
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,573
Imagine me as I was ten years ago

890
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,916
and you as you are now.

891
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,120
There were no lines then.

892
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,790
Would you have loved me
and wanted to marry me?

893
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:12,533
Yes.

894
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:16,035
- But I'll tell you something.
- What?

895
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,750
I like you the way you are now.

896
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:23,076
You'd like me much more
when I was your age.

897
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,325
I've never known anyone like you.

898
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,208
Oh, I'd like to sleep with you.

899
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,292
I mean, truly sleep

900
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,830
and wake up beside you
in the morning.

901
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:43,166
How's the time? Mm.

902
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,082
Alice, you're beautiful.

903
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,200
I'd like a picture of you like that.

904
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,416
There is a picture of me
in the nude somewhere.

905
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:07,410
- You're joking.
- No, there really is.

906
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:10,825
I was at university at the time

907
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:13,166
and I met an artist at a party.

908
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:17,536
He wanted a model. I don't suppose
it was even a good painting.

909
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,580
- How often did you do this?
- Only once.

910
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,616
Are you sure?

911
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,241
Of course I'm sure.

912
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,082
I don't tell lies, you know that.

913
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,868
You never told me.
Why didn't you tell me?

914
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,117
Because I had forgotten about it.

915
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,207
Oh, darling, what a fuss.

916
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,620
I didn't sleep with him
if that's what you're thinking.

917
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,832
But why?

918
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,200
Why did have to do it?

919
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:49,952
There are millions of women
a lot poorer than you ever were

920
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:54,032
who'd rather die than expose themselves
for a few lousy, rotten shillings.

921
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,370
Damn you to hell.
I feel I'd like to beat you black and blue.

922
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,537
But what's it to do with you?

923
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,125
It was long before I met you.

924
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,368
I must remember your beastly little
provincial mind doesn't like nudity.

925
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,913
You stupid bitch, it isn't that at all.

926
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:14,080
It's the idea of other people
looking at your nakedness that I hate.

927
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,200
It's not decent. Don't you see?

928
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:22,208
Oh, I understand now
what makes men kill women like you.

929
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:26,657
Oh, you're very brave and very moral
all of a sudden.

930
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,624
That's what you like, isn't it?

931
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,242
Leg-show and lingerie.

932
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,662
It isn't decent
for me to pose for an artist

933
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:35,875
who sees me as an arrangement
of light and colour,

934
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,333
but it's perfectly OK
for you to kiss me all over

935
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,700
and lie for an hour
just looking at me!

936
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,334
I suppose it gave you a thrill.

937
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:45,790
A dirty little thrill.

938
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:49,539
I suppose you see me
as your own private dirty postcard.

939
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,659
You can't imagine that a man
could look at a naked woman

940
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:55,125
without wanting
to make love to her, can you?

941
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,541
If you want to know, I can't.

942
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:02,160
Elspeth isn't rich, you know?
You needn't drink all her gin.

943
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,746
Give that to her
and tell her I broke the bottle.

944
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:13,200
To think I ever let you touch me.

945
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:17,537
Now, listen,

946
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:20,705
I own my own body,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

947
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,746
And I'm not ashamed
of anything I've ever done.

948
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,333
If you'd mixed with intelligent people,

949
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,997
you wouldn't be glaring at me
as if I had committed some crime.

950
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:32,749
Oh!

951
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:35,492
Some of the things
you told me about yourself.

952
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:40,492
I can just see you in Dufdon now,

953
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:45,076
looking at nudes in a magazine,

954
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:47,074
drooling over them,

955
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,084
saying you wouldn't mind
having a quick bash.

956
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:54,827
That's one of your words, isn't it?
But blackguarding the girls,

957
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:57,166
- calling them shameless whores.
- Oh, shut up!

958
00:58:57,292 --> 00:59:00,831
You make a great to-do
about your humble beginnings,

959
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,792
but you've never really been hard up.

960
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:07,035
- You've never gone hungry.
- What do you think a POW gets to eat?

961
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:08,954
Mm...

962
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,416
Even then you didn't starve.

963
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:15,035
There's always been somebody
to take care of our Joe.

964
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,582
Got extra.

965
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,620
You told me yourself.

966
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,367
Because you got along so well
with the guards.

967
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,334
Why didn't you have the guts to escape?

968
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,912
Like Jack Wales.

969
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,330
Don't mention that swine's name to me.

970
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,492
It was all right for him to escape.

971
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:47,073
He had a rich father to look after him
and buy him an education.

972
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,285
Those three years were
the only chance I'd get to be qualified.

973
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:54,785
Let those rich bastards
who have all the fun be heroes.

974
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,374
Let them pay for their privileges.

975
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,617
If you want it straight
from the soldier,

976
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,208
I was bloody well pleased
when I was captured.

977
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,869
I didn't like being a prisoner,

978
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,333
but it was a damn sight better
than being dead.

979
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,708
Come to that,

980
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:12,952
what did you do 50 years ago
back in the Great War?

981
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:29,409
You want some tea?

982
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:33,199
I don't want anything.

983
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,492
It was good while it lasted.

984
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,415
I mean that.

985
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,495
I'm sorry it had to end like this.

986
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,249
I'm sorry, too.

987
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:16,000
Goodbye, Alice.

988
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,866
Goodbye.

989
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:59,325
- Ah, Cinderella's arrived.
- Hello, Charles.

990
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,995
Yes, he's impossible!

991
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:09,708
He's always interfering.
Always interfering.

992
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:12,041
- Whisky, please.
- Yeah, whisky for the gentleman.

993
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:15,456
Oh, here, that reminds me,
did you hear about the chap

994
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,825
who asked a girl
if she wanted a whisky and sofa?

995
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,745
She said, "I don't want one of them,

996
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,207
"but I'll have a gi...

997
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,037
"I'll have a gin and platonic."

998
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,792
Whisky and sofa, gin and platonic!

999
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,829
It's a play on words.

1000
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,449
Oh, well, you don't understand it.

1001
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,324
Ooh, I wet you there.
Sorry about that.

1002
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,450
Harry, have you heard this one?

1003
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,416
This chap and this girl,
and he says...

1004
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:43,249
Whisky and sofa!

1005
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,083
"I don't want
a whisky and sofa."

1006
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,164
So, she said,
"I'd like a gin and platonic."

1007
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,079
Good evening, Susan.

1008
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,949
I hope you had a nice holiday.

1009
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,665
Hello, Joe.

1010
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:04,875
Have you met my father and mother?

1011
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,538
- This is Mr Lampton, Mother.
- How do you do, Mr Lampton?

1012
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:09,329
I've seen you at the town hall, lad.

1013
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,996
You know His Worship the Mayor,
the Mayoress?

1014
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,742
One of our bright young men
in the Treasurer's Office.

1015
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,082
Well, what are you drinking?

1016
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,870
- Scotch, please.
- Make it a large one.

1017
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,492
- By the way, weren't you at Mildenhall?
- Yes, 551 Squadron.

1018
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,585
- I had a good friend in that squadron.
- I remember the Steppes all right.

1019
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:25,745
My trouble is
to know when to take 'em!

1020
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,662
Well, give me the Lancers every time.

1021
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,033
Darrow. Chick Darrow.

1022
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:31,500
He was a nice chap.
I went to school with him.

1023
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,207
No, I don't remember him.

1024
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:37,156
But you must remember Chick!
Old Chick, why, you couldn't miss him.

1025
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,874
No, no, I've never met him.

1026
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,286
You come from Dufdon, don't you?

1027
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,283
- It was Dufdon, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:46,205
Yes. Must be quite a change for you.

1029
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,869
How's Cannon Jones?

1030
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,664
I haven't seen him in...
oh, must be nearly two years.

1031
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:53,624
Oh, you'll know Cannon Jones,
won't you?

1032
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,662
Leddersford.

1033
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:57,408
No, I'm afraid, I don't.

1034
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,740
Charming wife and terribly like
Lucy Saunders, don't you think?

1035
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,958
You'll know J.C. Brotherton,
I'm sure of that.

1036
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:07,326
I know him in much in the same way
as I know the Prime Minister.

1037
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,117
My father used to work in one of his mills
as an overlooker.

1038
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,165
Now, that's nice, don't you think?

1039
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:17,534
I've noticed with this orchestra,
year after year,

1040
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:20,250
the older the piece,
the happier they are with it.

1041
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:23,914
Well, speaking of Dufdon,
extraordinary chap, that Clevely.

1042
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:27,456
Chucking his money around all right.
He's well on his way to his knighthood.

1043
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,223
He drove Father to a meeting last month.
He's got a large Mercedes.

1044
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:33,364
Father said he drove like a maniac.
You know him, don't you?

1045
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,491
I don't know any tallymen.

1046
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,957
- Oh, come now.
- I don't follow you, old man.

1047
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,911
A tallyman is...

1048
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,624
Well, he sells clothes on credit,

1049
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,787
money-lending
at fantastic high interest rates.

1050
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,537
It's business.
You wouldn't refuse the profits.

1051
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:50,245
It's dirty business.

1052
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:53,823
Henry, I don't know if you're aware of it
or not, but this is our dance.

1053
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:55,244
Good night, Mr Lampton.

1054
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:58,288
- Elsie, are you gonna risk it with me?
- Yes, of course.

1055
01:04:58,417 --> 01:04:59,498
Come on, Sue.

1056
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,415
See you later, Sergeant.

1057
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,288
Don't worry about the way
the world's run, lad.

1058
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:11,875
Enjoy it while you're young.

1059
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,206
Hmm.

1060
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,661
Joe...

1061
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,660
If you're free, I could see you
the dance after next.

1062
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:37,535
Joe, why didn't you write?

1063
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,375
You didn't write either,
only postcards.

1064
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,116
I was waiting for you to write.

1065
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:44,658
A girl can't write first.

1066
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,825
Well, she can't
if she has any pride.

1067
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,412
Why did you go away
without letting me know?

1068
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:55,784
I had to. They sent me away.

1069
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:59,872
- Don't you believe me?
- Oh, I believe you.

1070
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,083
But that's why I didn't write.

1071
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,290
Because I knew how hopeless it was.

1072
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:09,330
- Why?
- You know it's hopeless, Susan.

1073
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,539
Tell me, Joe. Please.

1074
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,499
You saw them in there
when I met your parents,

1075
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:15,368
the way they were needling me,
and you couldn't do anything about it.

1076
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,334
- I wanted to, really I did.
- One day they'll say,

1077
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:21,121
"You mustn't see
that vulgar person again."

1078
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,912
They wouldn't dare.

1079
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:26,166
I won't ever let them come between us.

1080
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,957
It's useless, Susan.

1081
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,415
You know it is.

1082
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,741
Let me kiss you.

1083
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:42,874
Just this once.

1084
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,370
Don't you care about me?

1085
01:06:58,292 --> 01:07:02,616
Maybe... it's because I care too much.

1086
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,750
I love you, Joe.

1087
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,749
I love you.

1088
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:18,741
I love you, too.

1089
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:21,665
Do you really?

1090
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:25,250
Oh, Joe, how much?

1091
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:29,120
Very much.

1092
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,624
No!

1093
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,199
I'm sorry, Joe.

1094
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,165
Really I am.

1095
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,207
Gosh, I'm hot!

1096
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,450
You shouldn't feel hot.

1097
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,199
You've nothing on.

1098
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:12,038
Is that better?
Is that what prim Joe wants?

1099
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,124
No, that's not what Joe wants.

1100
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,871
You know what Joe wants.

1101
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,208
It's what all the Joes want.

1102
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:22,832
Oh, Joe.

1103
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:28,495
You know, sometimes when you kiss me,
I feel as if you weren't really there.

1104
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:31,038
I'm here all right, and I can prove it.

1105
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:34,285
Seriously, Joe,
there's something wrong, isn't there?

1106
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:38,161
- Don't you like the way I make love?
- Oh, I like it very much.

1107
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:40,249
It reminds me of a good set
of mixed tennis.

1108
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:43,101
- That's not a very kind thing to say.
- I sometimes don't feel very kind.

1109
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:45,242
- Why?
- Well, your mother and father,

1110
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,367
were they kind to me the other night?

1111
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,617
I can just see your mother now,

1112
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,709
saying, "You mustn't see
that vulgar Lampton boy again,

1113
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,667
"the one with the bulging shirt
and the chromium cufflinks."

1114
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,914
Then there's you. You lead me on so far
and then you stop me.

1115
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:04,158
What do you think I'm made of?

1116
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:06,705
It's not that I don't want to.

1117
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:07,949
It's just...

1118
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:10,416
well, I suppose I'm scared.

1119
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:15,745
I do love you, Joe, I do!
I'd do anything for you, Joe, anything!

1120
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:22,368
Except what any girl would do
for the man she loves.

1121
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,660
Joe, how much do you love me?

1122
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:28,664
Very much.

1123
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,708
About a million pounds' worth.

1124
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:39,041
Joe, be gentle with me.

1125
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,868
âª Out in the pale moonlight

1126
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,957
âª It wasn't your pa

1127
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,324
âª It wasn't... âª

1128
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:53,491
Oh, let's face it, darling,
he was a brute, a coarse brute!

1129
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,575
Oh, I know it's hell right this minute,

1130
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,997
but the way I look at it,
he's the loser.

1131
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:24,333
Come on, Susan.
I think we'd better be going now.

1132
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,624
I don't want to go.

1133
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,833
I don't ever want to go.

1134
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,458
Isn't it super, Joe?

1135
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,575
Now we really belong to each other.

1136
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:40,826
Really and truly, till death do us part.

1137
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,582
Wasn't it wonderful?

1138
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:49,031
Wasn't it absolutely
the most wonderful thing

1139
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:50,783
that ever happened to you?

1140
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,500
- Wasn't it, Joe?
- Yes.

1141
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:59,658
Come on, let's go.

1142
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:01,875
Oh, must we really go?

1143
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,038
You know we must.
Besides, your mother...

1144
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:07,250
Poor Mummy, if only she knew.

1145
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:09,533
That's quite a thought.

1146
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:15,831
Joe, do you know
I don't really feel any different?

1147
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:19,030
I thought I'd feel terribly different
and I don't.

1148
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:21,409
Joe, do you feel different?

1149
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,666
You don't really want
to talk about it, do you?

1150
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:28,079
You're not very sentimental, are you?

1151
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,825
No, I'd rather not talk about it.

1152
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,326
Joe, do you know something?
I do believe you're a prig.

1153
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,292
You're really shier than I am, aren't you?
Aren't you really?

1154
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:40,074
I expect I am.

1155
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:43,366
Do I look different?

1156
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,662
- Do I, Joe?
- No.

1157
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:50,991
I don't feel different.
I feel just the same, only better.

1158
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:54,659
I thought I'd feel so terribly different.

1159
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:57,249
It's funny.

1160
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,867
Are you sure
I don't look different, Joe?

1161
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,458
Just the tiniest bit? Really sure?

1162
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:11,409
Hey! Come on, Joe,
what are you waiting for?

1163
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:14,159
I think I'll hang on for a bit.
I've got some work to do.

1164
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,252
- But it's Friday!
- You can get along without me.

1165
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,559
The last few days
you've been lower than a snake's belly.

1166
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,783
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1167
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,768
You ought to be sitting pretty. You said
Susan was your tenner on the pools.

1168
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:25,309
Well, you're home, lad. You won
first dividend or near as damn it.

1169
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,325
- Everything's going my way.
- Ready, chaps?

1170
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,290
You go ahead.
I don't think I'll come tonight.

1171
01:12:29,417 --> 01:12:31,079
What's the matter with him?
What's wrong?

1172
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:33,688
Nothing's the matter.
I just don't happen to feel like boozing.

1173
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:35,499
Come along, Teddy.

1174
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,867
Call in later, Joe, if you feel like it.

1175
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:10,949
Nothing has changed.

1176
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:15,994
Nothing at all.

1177
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,333
Oh, I don't care about them.

1178
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,495
I don't either.

1179
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,533
I couldn't do without you.

1180
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:41,033
I love you, Alice.

1181
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,332
I love you.

1182
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:46,991
Remember...

1183
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,162
What was it you once said?

1184
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,999
"Loving friends", you said.

1185
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:53,704
"Let's be loving friends."

1186
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:58,660
I didn't want to fall in love with you.

1187
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:01,250
I tried to fall in love with Susan.

1188
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:06,875
What are we gonna do?

1189
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,457
I don't know.

1190
01:14:09,667 --> 01:14:11,909
It's been hell these last weeks.

1191
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,579
I want you all the time.

1192
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,745
Not just stolen meetings.

1193
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:22,243
Oh, Alice.
Listen, couldn't we...?

1194
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:26,039
Well, I have a fortnight
starting next month on the 15th.

1195
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:29,001
Charles says he knows of a cottage,
belongs to a friend of his.

1196
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:33,121
We could have it for a few days
for next to nothing.

1197
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:36,625
And there'd be nobody
for miles around.

1198
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,415
Just us.

1199
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,158
Together.

1200
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,165
Oh, Alice, couldn't we?

1201
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:15,167
No!

1202
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:18,329
I've never done this before.

1203
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,700
The next time I do it,

1204
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:23,416
I tell you, woman,
it's going to be legitimate.

1205
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:26,995
Darling, you sound like a lawyer.

1206
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:29,287
I feel more like a Billingsgate porter.

1207
01:15:29,417 --> 01:15:30,578
Hmm!

1208
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:32,165
Not very flattering.

1209
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,537
Oh, it's nice here.

1210
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,244
There.

1211
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:58,324
Thank you.

1212
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:04,125
- You know something?
- Hmm?

1213
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,165
I feel quite shy suddenly.

1214
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,916
As if I really were a young bride.

1215
01:16:12,042 --> 01:16:14,034
I feel rather shy myself.

1216
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,958
Oh, but it's a good feeling.

1217
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:19,199
Yes.

1218
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,199
No.

1219
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:30,456
No, I don't want to smoke
and I don't want to drink.

1220
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:34,076
Because cigarettes and drink,
they dull you.

1221
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,163
I want every minute of these four days.

1222
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:41,535
And I want them sharp and clear.

1223
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,366
Alice?

1224
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:55,034
You and George, do you still...?

1225
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:59,409
Tell me, I want to know. Do you?

1226
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:04,198
Very well.
The answer is yes, sometimes.

1227
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:07,953
But...

1228
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,620
Joe...

1229
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:13,333
You don't know about these things.

1230
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:17,156
They are not as simple as that.
It's all mixed up.

1231
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:19,579
- You don't love him.
- No.

1232
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,741
You and him, it's...

1233
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,832
Well, it's not like us, is it?

1234
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:28,165
No, it's not.

1235
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,908
You're such a honest person.

1236
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:39,329
Why the hell do you have
to be so honest?

1237
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,950
Darling, I'm glad you're so honest.

1238
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:56,995
I love you for it.

1239
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,082
Do you have to go tomorrow?

1240
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,494
You know I have.

1241
01:18:27,292 --> 01:18:28,578
You know...

1242
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,834
I used to think it was
a lot of romantic nonsense,

1243
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,166
one man, one woman.

1244
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:37,991
Not long ago I'd have said...

1245
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:42,535
...a man could be happy
with any one of a hundred women.

1246
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:48,958
Now I know you're my woman, Alice.

1247
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:52,622
My rush. All the love
I'll ever get now or evermore.

1248
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:56,626
And you've got all the love
I'll ever have to give.

1249
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:04,167
You've changed so much, Joe.
You know that?

1250
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:05,499
So have you.

1251
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:08,618
Yes, I've no more defences.

1252
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,665
How have I changed?

1253
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:14,158
Oh, I don't know how to say it.

1254
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,538
You're... You're stronger now,

1255
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:21,205
more sure of yourself.

1256
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:25,156
I was so angry with you at first
when you wanted Susan.

1257
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,948
You seemed to want things
for all the wrong reasons.

1258
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:35,539
And you didn't see how you were
damaging yourself as a person.

1259
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:40,081
You weren't proud to be you,
just to be yourself.

1260
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:43,704
But you're proud now, aren't you?

1261
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,750
Oh, yes.

1262
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:50,743
Right now I'm the proudest man
in the world.

1263
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,784
You've got so much, Joe.

1264
01:19:57,917 --> 01:19:59,658
Everything.

1265
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:02,375
You don't ever have to pretend.

1266
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,288
You just have to be yourself.

1267
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:08,865
"This above all:

1268
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,119
"To thine own self be true.

1269
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,866
"And..." And...

1270
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,286
- And?
- I've forgotten the rest.

1271
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:19,581
"And it must follow,

1272
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:22,200
"as the night the day.

1273
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,666
- "Thou then canst..."
- "Thou canst not then..."

1274
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:27,864
"Thou canst not then
be false to any man."

1275
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:33,077
You're an educated and moral witch, Alice,
and I love you.

1276
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,955
Oh, I've something for you.

1277
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,370
Oh, no, it's much too nice for me.

1278
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,867
I want you to have it.

1279
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,617
To remind you
of the happiness we had.

1280
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:02,579
You talk like a requiem.

1281
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,950
This is only the beginning.

1282
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,579
Are you sure?

1283
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,413
I can't live without you.

1284
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:19,374
I've tried and I can't.

1285
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,366
I need you.

1286
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:30,116
Do you really mean it?

1287
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:34,784
Do you want me to divorce George?

1288
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,783
Yes.

1289
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:38,408
But would you?

1290
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:44,121
- What's so funny?
- You.

1291
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,700
I'm frightened.

1292
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:53,827
Nobody was ever meant
to be as happy as I am now.

1293
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,745
It can't last.

1294
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:59,243
It's like... like a bubble
that's going to burst

1295
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,913
when I get on that train tomorrow.

1296
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:05,579
Mm... That train.

1297
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:12,284
Change your mind, Joe,
and come with me.

1298
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:16,331
No, it's best as we arranged.
I'll take the next train

1299
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:19,292
and see you when I get back
from Dufdon at Elspeth's.

1300
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:22,495
It's only ten days.

1301
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:25,449
It's only a lifetime.

1302
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:34,456
We'll work it out so that we can spend
the rest of our lives together.

1303
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:38,450
Give me a cigarette, darling.

1304
01:22:40,792 --> 01:22:44,240
I have a feeling
that this is all we're gonna have.

1305
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,787
This is only the beginning.

1306
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,666
Please walk away now, darling.

1307
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:08,658
Walk away and don't look back.

1308
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,207
Think of me.

1309
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,581
Yes?

1310
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,242
- Mr Aisgill, what can I...?
- Sit down.

1311
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,245
What can I do for you?

1312
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,332
Cigarette?

1313
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,324
Nice case you have there.

1314
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,579
You know why I'm here.

1315
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:11,750
Alice tells me she wants to divorce me.

1316
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:13,915
- Well, I'm not agreeable.
- You haven't any choice.

1317
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,868
She's my wife and she's going
to remain my wife.

1318
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,913
I want to make this quite clear to you.
She has no grounds for divorce.

1319
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:23,410
Everybody knows the way you treat Alice,
about you and your women.

1320
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:25,249
But nobody can prove anything.

1321
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:29,618
The difference between you and me
is that I haven't been indiscreet enough

1322
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,707
to leave evidence lying around.

1323
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:33,949
- Meaning what?
- Just this.

1324
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,166
If she brings an action for divorce,
I'll fight it.

1325
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:39,285
I'll smear you both across the headlines.

1326
01:24:39,417 --> 01:24:40,749
It will make fine reading.

1327
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,161
Elspeth's flat,

1328
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:45,330
the naked bathing in Dorset
and all the rest of it.

1329
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:48,246
- How did you know?
- I make it my business to know.

1330
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:52,574
It'll break you because you can't stand
a scandal like that, and you know it.

1331
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:56,201
And you won't get Alice either,
because I still won't let her go.

1332
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,491
You can't hold her.

1333
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,601
Maybe she can't divorce you,
but she can leave you.

1334
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,163
- You can't stop her from leaving you.
- Can you keep her?

1335
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:06,909
I can keep her
because I love her.

1336
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:10,206
She's ten years older than you
and she hasn't a penny of her own.

1337
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,620
If she leaves me,
I'll sue you for enticement.

1338
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,662
Then you won't be able
to support even yourself.

1339
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:20,163
You've got everything
pretty well worked out, haven't you?

1340
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:22,662
I have. There are no loopholes.

1341
01:25:22,792 --> 01:25:25,034
Get it clear: from now on
you leave Alice alone.

1342
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,284
- Understand me?
- Why won't you let her go? Why?

1343
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:30,285
Because she's my wife, that's why.

1344
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,120
Are you trying to tell me
you still love her?

1345
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,583
I'm not trying to tell you anything.

1346
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,575
I've let you off lightly.

1347
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:46,121
There will be no more warnings.

1348
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:56,417
Say that again.

1349
01:25:56,542 --> 01:26:00,081
June and I have decided to go steady.
I wanted you to be the first one to know.

1350
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:03,042
- That's just wonderful.
- Oh, Joe, show some enthusiasm.

1351
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:06,205
Well, I seem to remember
you wanted a girl with no responsibilities

1352
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,791
and a small family business
in the background.

1353
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:10,704
That don't seem
to matter much anymore.

1354
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,909
Oh, and what about the invalid mother?

1355
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:15,328
Oh, I get it!

1356
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:18,121
She's died and left you
a large insurance policy.

1357
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,582
Oh, Joe!

1358
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,824
No, seriously,
what about her invalid mother?

1359
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:26,247
That don't seem to matter much either.

1360
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,788
June's a fine kid.
You couldn't have done better, Charles.

1361
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:32,410
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of settling down myself.

1362
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,912
That might be June.
I'll be right with you, Joe.

1363
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:43,494
Hey, Joe.

1364
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:45,582
It's for you. Mr Brown.

1365
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:46,915
Who?

1366
01:26:47,042 --> 01:26:48,999
God almighty! Brown, that's who.

1367
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:50,411
He wants to talk to you.

1368
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:53,125
Tell him my mother sent me
touring on the Riviera.

1369
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,617
Oh, no, Joe.
Come on, quick. He's waiting.

1370
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,208
- Well, let him wait.
- Joe, what's got into you lately?

1371
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:01,781
- I've had enough threats for one day.
- Well, come on!

1372
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:04,909
Oh, all right, I'm coming.

1373
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:11,290
Yes?

1374
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:14,910
Are you sure it's me
you want to speak to, Mr Brown?

1375
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:16,249
Oh...

1376
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,786
Yes, sir.

1377
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:32,124
What did he want?

1378
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,118
He wants me to lunch with him
at the Conservative Club at one o'clock.

1379
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,367
Sit down. You're late.

1380
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,537
He'll have the game soup.

1381
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,909
It's the first time
you've been in this club, is it?

1382
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:14,284
This or any other Conservative Club.

1383
01:28:14,417 --> 01:28:17,785
My father would turn in his grave
if he could see me now.

1384
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:21,536
So would mine,
but we're not bound by our fathers.

1385
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,038
Now, I've got a proposition for you.

1386
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:26,999
You're a clever young man.

1387
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:30,243
You don't want to stay in the town hall
the rest of your life, do you?

1388
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:33,163
Now's the time that accountants
can do well for theirselves.

1389
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:37,201
Now, I'm willing
to set you up in business,

1390
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,575
buy you a partnership.

1391
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:41,700
Well, what do you say?

1392
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:44,786
There's a catch somewhere.

1393
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,287
Not a catch, but a condition.

1394
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:52,285
I'll set you up on condition
that you never see Susan again

1395
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:53,783
or communicate with her.

1396
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:58,955
Now, just what's so funny
about that, young man?

1397
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:01,749
Nothing I could explain.

1398
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,450
If you agree,
I'll make you a rich man.

1399
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:09,161
You'll be a damn sight better off
than you'll ever be in local government.

1400
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:11,537
Well, what do you say?

1401
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,745
Are you trying to buy me off?

1402
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:17,457
That's right.

1403
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:21,202
I'm buying you off
and I'm paying a damn fine price for it.

1404
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,040
Come on, now, use your head.

1405
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:26,660
You want to improve yourself,
you want to get in among the money.

1406
01:29:26,792 --> 01:29:29,159
All right, I don't blame you for that.

1407
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,242
But you're not getting
at my brass through Susan.

1408
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:35,413
You wouldn't talk to me like that
if I were Jack Wales

1409
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:37,249
and had a rich daddy behind me.

1410
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:39,833
I don't give a damn for Jack Wales.

1411
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,792
A nice little business merger
between the two families.

1412
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:44,499
I don't barter my daughter.

1413
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,492
- You're trying to barter her now.
- That's enough!

1414
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,038
I told you my offer.
It's the best chance you'll ever have.

1415
01:29:52,167 --> 01:29:54,204
Now, take it or leave it,

1416
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,370
but get this into your head:

1417
01:29:57,208 --> 01:30:00,246
if you refuse it,
I'm going to break you.

1418
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,451
And what's more,
I shall run you out of Warnley!

1419
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,708
Everybody wants to run me
out of Warnley.

1420
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:15,956
Let's say you kick me out
and I take Susan with me.

1421
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:18,699
She's in love with me, you know?

1422
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:20,950
Susan's too young
to know her own mind.

1423
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,699
She'll do as I tell her.

1424
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,325
If she disobeys me,
I shall cut her off without a penny.

1425
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:28,117
You mean throw her out?

1426
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,411
If necessary.

1427
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,866
I thought that might interest you.

1428
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:35,165
No!

1429
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:40,167
I say "nah" to your bloody rotten offer!

1430
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:41,908
Wait a minute!

1431
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:51,166
Now I'll tell you
what you're going to do.

1432
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:56,241
Sit down.

1433
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:05,497
You're marrying her
with my consent, right quick.

1434
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,742
- Am I?
- That's right.

1435
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:11,791
But I... I don't understand.

1436
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:15,035
Don't you?
The reason's very simple.

1437
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:19,117
Yes, I'm glad
you have the grace to blush.

1438
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,242
But... but why didn't she tell me?

1439
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:28,372
Chicken again?
I'll be turning into one soon.

1440
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,914
- We'll have the pie.
- I'll have a scotch, please, a large one.

1441
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:33,123
She didn't tell you

1442
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,643
because she didn't want you
to wed her out of her sense of duty.

1443
01:31:35,667 --> 01:31:37,829
And I didn't tell you
because I wanted to try you out.

1444
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,291
- Hmm.
- No need to laugh like that, young man.

1445
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:45,114
This isn't the way I planned
to have my daughter wed.

1446
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,698
Now, listen, you're gonna throw up
your job at the town hall.

1447
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:51,374
I need somebody
to reorganise the office.

1448
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,493
I want some efficiency
in that side of the business.

1449
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:01,708
Well?

1450
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,289
How about salary?

1451
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,491
Thousand a year to start with.

1452
01:32:29,167 --> 01:32:30,908
Nought if you don't make a success of it.

1453
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:34,575
And there's just one other matter
to be cleared up.

1454
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:36,199
If you don't, it's all off.

1455
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:39,367
You've been too ruddy long
about it already.

1456
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:43,201
Leave off Alice Aisgill.

1457
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,540
Now!

1458
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:47,284
I'm not gonna have my daughter
hurt anymore,

1459
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:50,489
and I'm not gonna have my son-in-law
in the divorce courts either.

1460
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:52,241
Not on account
of an old whore like that.

1461
01:32:55,625 --> 01:32:57,662
There's no need
to talk about her in that way.

1462
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:00,330
I use words that fit.

1463
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:04,156
Now, get done with her.
I'll not have it put off anymore.

1464
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:07,621
Bring coffee for two.

1465
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,082
I'm driving over to Leddersford.

1466
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:12,076
I'll drop you off at the house,
Susan wants to talk to you.

1467
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:14,200
But... I've got to get back
to the office.

1468
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:17,201
I told Hoylake you were taking
the afternoon off.

1469
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,291
You can fix just about anything,
can't you?

1470
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:24,324
Just about.

1471
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,708
I'll tell Miss Susan you're here.

1472
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:11,373
Joe!

1473
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:22,950
Joe, isn't it wonderful?

1474
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:24,790
I'm so happy.

1475
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:27,791
Now we're really going to be married.

1476
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,291
Why didn't you tell me
about the baby?

1477
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:36,373
Oh, I don't know,
you've seemed so strange lately,

1478
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,537
as if you didn't like me very much.

1479
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:41,415
But it's all right now, isn't it, Joe?

1480
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:43,283
Yes.

1481
01:34:43,417 --> 01:34:45,625
Yes, it's all all right now.

1482
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,039
Joe?

1483
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:59,539
People have told me,
even Daddy said that you were...

1484
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:03,205
that you were having an affair
with Alice Aisgill.

1485
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:07,033
How could you?

1486
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:09,250
She's so... old!

1487
01:35:11,542 --> 01:35:15,411
Just an old whore like her?
That's what you mean, isn't it?

1488
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:17,408
Well, it's all over now,

1489
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,078
so just forget about it.

1490
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:21,700
- How do I know that?
- Because I'm telling you.

1491
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,244
Listen, Joe,

1492
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:26,334
if you so much as look at her again,
we're through.

1493
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:28,745
I don't care about the baby
or anything. I mean it.

1494
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,582
I won't be second best!

1495
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:32,415
Promise me
you'll never ever see her again.

1496
01:35:32,542 --> 01:35:33,874
I can't do that.

1497
01:35:35,667 --> 01:35:39,456
I'm going to see her just one more time
and tell her about us.

1498
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:42,326
- You could write to her.
- I'm going to see her!

1499
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,581
Joe...

1500
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:53,450
You do love me, don't you?

1501
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:59,951
May I come in?
Oh, hello, Mr Lampton.

1502
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:03,451
I suppose now I'd better call you Joe.

1503
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:07,031
Well, the sooner we get on
with the arrangements, the better.

1504
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:11,161
We've decided on a white wedding
in spite of the circumstances.

1505
01:36:11,292 --> 01:36:14,660
The first thing I'll require from you
is a list of the guests.

1506
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:38,792
Darling, I thought you'd never come.
You're so late.

1507
01:36:38,917 --> 01:36:40,533
Come on.

1508
01:36:43,542 --> 01:36:45,158
I've got a surprise for you.

1509
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,787
Come on, open it.

1510
01:36:47,917 --> 01:36:48,998
Oh...

1511
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:54,499
Don't like it?

1512
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:56,616
Yes, I... I like it very much, but...

1513
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:59,242
If you don't like it,
you can change it for another colour.

1514
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,662
What's wrong?
You look so serious.

1515
01:37:02,792 --> 01:37:04,909
No, I... I like the colour.

1516
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,831
Alice...

1517
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:09,412
Alice, sit down.

1518
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:11,625
You won't be hurting my feelings.

1519
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,163
I'm not touchy about things like that.

1520
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:23,457
I'm going to marry Susan.

1521
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:28,951
Everything's fixed, even the date.

1522
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:34,033
I'm going to marry her.

1523
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:44,492
I've put her in the family way.

1524
01:37:48,292 --> 01:37:50,909
Well, what did you expect me to do?
Run away?

1525
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:58,664
No, but that doesn't mean
you have to marry her.

1526
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,704
I've got to marry her!

1527
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:04,702
- You'll be telling me next you love her.
- Look, Alice, please.

1528
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:07,041
Please don't let's have a scene.

1529
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:10,574
We were loving friends, remember?

1530
01:38:10,708 --> 01:38:14,748
Right from the start you said
we were only loving friends.

1531
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:22,365
It wasn't possible anyway, you and me.
You know it wasn't.

1532
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,366
Well, George wouldn't let you go.

1533
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:27,018
If you'd have taken him to court,
he'd have thrown more muck at us

1534
01:38:27,042 --> 01:38:28,533
than either of us could stand.

1535
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:31,159
I would have lost my job.

1536
01:38:31,292 --> 01:38:32,999
What could we have lived on?

1537
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:43,906
You're a timid soul, aren't you?

1538
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:50,167
I suppose you are going
to work for Brown.

1539
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:54,744
Yes.

1540
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:00,583
You've done very well
for yourself, Joe.

1541
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:05,156
Finally, you've got
everything you wanted.

1542
01:39:06,083 --> 01:39:07,199
Haven't you?

1543
01:39:15,167 --> 01:39:18,615
There is something
you have never understood, Joe.

1544
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,912
These people at the top,

1545
01:39:21,042 --> 01:39:22,999
they are the same as anybody else.

1546
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:27,911
But you had it inside of you
to be so much bigger than any of them.

1547
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:31,913
You just had to be yourself.

1548
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:34,995
That was all.

1549
01:39:36,792 --> 01:39:39,034
With me you were yourself.

1550
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:41,783
Only with me.

1551
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,742
Don't you understand
what you've done?

1552
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,866
Look, Alice...

1553
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,624
I'm going to marry Susan.

1554
01:39:54,667 --> 01:39:57,080
All right, maybe I do love you,

1555
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:58,665
but I'm going to marry her.

1556
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:01,409
Now, please don't make it
any more difficult for us both.

1557
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:03,158
Oh, to hell with you!

1558
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:07,869
Do you think our love
is just like a layer of dirt?

1559
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,787
That I can wash it off?

1560
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:12,453
I believe in our love.

1561
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:14,449
What else have I got?

1562
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,415
It's all I have to believe in.

1563
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,833
You ask me not to make it difficult.

1564
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:23,702
But I'm not like your aunt in Dufdon.
Why shouldn't I make it difficult for you?

1565
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:26,200
Because it won't do you any good,
that's why.

1566
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:29,576
- I'm going to marry Susan.
- Don't say it again.

1567
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:31,870
Please don't say it again.

1568
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:39,791
I think we need a little drink.

1569
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,992
Look, Alice,

1570
01:40:45,125 --> 01:40:47,242
I wish you'd face facts.

1571
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,866
I'll never love anyone else,

1572
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,708
but there just isn't any future
for us together.

1573
01:40:53,792 --> 01:40:55,954
What a pretty speech.

1574
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:59,326
I suppose you worked that out
before you came, didn't you?

1575
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:02,872
I'm never going to see you again.
That's what I came to tell you.

1576
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:05,783
I'm going now.

1577
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:06,998
No!

1578
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,616
Goodbye, Alice.

1579
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:46,409
Are you all right, Mrs Aisgill?

1580
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:53,081
- She's had a skinful.
- I've never seen her like that before.

1581
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:56,042
She'll be all right.
She knows her way around.

1582
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:47,911
Good morning.

1583
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:50,455
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Lampton.

1584
01:43:50,583 --> 01:43:52,119
Oh, Miss Beth?

1585
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,038
I'd like to get everything outstanding
settled as soon as possible,

1586
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:56,248
starting with the gas.

1587
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:58,415
How about the profit and loss
appropriation account?

1588
01:43:58,542 --> 01:43:59,703
Oh, it can wait.

1589
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:03,076
Mr Lampton, I would like
to congratulate you.

1590
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:05,074
Mr Hoylake told Gladys and...

1591
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:07,370
Well, you know
how these things get about.

1592
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,459
- I hope you'll be very happy together.
- Thank you very much.

1593
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:13,826
- Did you hear about the accident?
- Have you set the date of the wedding?

1594
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:16,120
- No, not definitely.
- Alice Aisgill. She's dead.

1595
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,242
It will be the wedding of the year,
I'm sure.

1596
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:20,162
- Who's dead?
- Alice Aisgill.

1597
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:21,749
- I hope so.
- And Miss Brown,

1598
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:24,115
if you don't mind my saying so,
will make a lovely bride.

1599
01:44:24,167 --> 01:44:26,284
She ran her car
into the cliff at Sparrow Hill.

1600
01:44:26,417 --> 01:44:27,874
Heard she was drunk.

1601
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,036
What's that?

1602
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:31,033
Alice Aisgill, Mr Lampton.

1603
01:44:31,167 --> 01:44:34,706
They say that the car was bent like that
and blood all over the place.

1604
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:36,745
What was she doing
up on Sparrow Hill anyway?

1605
01:44:36,875 --> 01:44:39,208
Oh, goodness knows.
She'd been drinking all right.

1606
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:41,416
Probably didn't know where she was.

1607
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:42,908
- There he is!
- Joe!

1608
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:45,580
Congratulations, lad. It couldn't
have happened to a nicer chap.

1609
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:47,976
He was trying to tell me the other night.
Weren't you, Joe?

1610
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,868
Come on, bring that through now.
We've got a surprise for you, Joe.

1611
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,662
Come on, lad, quick!

1612
01:44:52,792 --> 01:44:54,704
Well, unwrap it!

1613
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:58,406
Oh, come here!
Look, Joe, champagne!

1614
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:00,454
âª Here comes the bride

1615
01:45:00,583 --> 01:45:02,324
âª All dressed in white

1616
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:05,872
âª Da, da, da-da, da,
da-da-da-da-da, da-dee... âª

1617
01:45:11,042 --> 01:45:12,453
It's the real stuff, you know?

1618
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:20,496
Hello! There you are, Joe.

1619
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:23,868
So, you're to be leaving us, are you?
Marrying into big business.

1620
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,323
Well, well, congratulations.
What's the matter?

1621
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:29,745
We were just talking
about the accident, Mr Hoylake.

1622
01:45:29,875 --> 01:45:32,333
- What accident?
- Alice Aisgill's dead.

1623
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:34,495
Her car crashed last night.

1624
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:36,287
- No!
- Nasty business.

1625
01:45:36,417 --> 01:45:39,740
I met Dr Everett. He told me.
You knew her well, didn't you, Joe?

1626
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,374
Yes, I knew her.

1627
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,913
Wouldn't have been so bad
if she'd died outright.

1628
01:45:48,042 --> 01:45:49,842
Good-looking woman, too.
It's hard on Aisgill.

1629
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:51,934
Is it true they didn't find her
till this morning?

1630
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:53,809
I'm afraid so.
She was terribly mutilated.

1631
01:45:53,833 --> 01:45:55,476
I heard it was
a farm labourer found her.

1632
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,913
She was crawling about the road
in her own blood.

1633
01:45:58,042 --> 01:45:59,328
It doesn't bear thinking about.

1634
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:01,666
Apparently she'd been struck
by the steering wheel.

1635
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:06,916
What is it? What's the matter?

1636
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:58,494
You low, rotten chiseller!
You murdering little fancyman!

1637
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:00,537
Are you happy now, you swine?

1638
01:47:00,667 --> 01:47:04,160
- You got rid of her nicely, didn't you?
- You don't understand.

1639
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:06,124
You bastard! You bastard!

1640
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:09,038
You dirty, filthy bastard!

1641
01:47:09,167 --> 01:47:10,908
She was in your way, wasn't she?

1642
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:13,329
Get out of here,
you filthy little bloodsucker!

1643
01:47:15,833 --> 01:47:18,576
Oh, Joe, how could you do it?

1644
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:22,161
She loved you so.

1645
01:47:23,292 --> 01:47:24,908
How could you do it?

1646
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:35,575
- I said, what's your name, dear?
- Eh?

1647
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:37,950
- What's your name?
- Jack Wales.

1648
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:39,949
And what do you really sell?

1649
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:43,531
I told you,
I specialise in ladies' underwear.

1650
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:48,076
Ooh, you're a devil, Jack.
Ooh, you really are.

1651
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:49,790
Come along, Mavis. Let's go.

1652
01:47:49,917 --> 01:47:52,876
Oh, go away.
We were all right till you came.

1653
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,866
Look, I couldn't help being late.

1654
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,913
You see, I was working
over at the factory, love.

1655
01:47:58,042 --> 01:48:00,442
Look, you bloody well stop that.
You're coming along with me.

1656
01:48:00,542 --> 01:48:02,158
Leave her alone!

1657
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:04,908
Look here.

1658
01:48:05,042 --> 01:48:07,034
You stick to your own class!

1659
01:48:07,167 --> 01:48:09,159
You come moaning in here,
you and your money,

1660
01:48:09,292 --> 01:48:10,624
think you can buy the place.

1661
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,288
Look, I've seen your type before,
you know.

1662
01:48:13,417 --> 01:48:16,410
- Now, just you keep out of this!
- I've told you, leave her alone!

1663
01:48:16,542 --> 01:48:19,455
Look, I warned you.
I'll slit your bloody gizzard.

1664
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:21,575
Take your hands off her!

1665
01:48:34,792 --> 01:48:37,956
He's not really my boyfriend.
Not really, Jack.

1666
01:48:38,083 --> 01:48:40,325
Just because he's taken me out
a couple of times,

1667
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:42,666
thinks he owns me, he does.

1668
01:48:42,792 --> 01:48:45,535
But he don't know
how to treat a girl proper.

1669
01:48:45,667 --> 01:48:47,203
He's not like you, Jack.

1670
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,450
Here! Oi, same again.

1671
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:52,291
You don't want any more to drink,
really you don't.

1672
01:48:52,417 --> 01:48:53,624
Don't I?

1673
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:57,458
What you need is some fresh air.

1674
01:48:57,583 --> 01:48:59,040
Come on.

1675
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,331
Alice.

1676
01:49:05,708 --> 01:49:07,449
Oh, Alice...

1677
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:09,950
It's Mavis is my name.

1678
01:49:12,458 --> 01:49:15,781
Oh, you're wonderful.

1679
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,083
Oh, you really are.

1680
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:22,992
Oh, you've such lovely hands.

1681
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,416
- Like a gentleman.
- Oh, shut up!

1682
01:49:26,542 --> 01:49:27,953
Jack...

1683
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:32,322
I've always wanted
to meet someone like you.

1684
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:34,074
I always have.

1685
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:39,542
Here, you wouldn't pass out on me?

1686
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:42,159
You mustn't go to sleep.

1687
01:49:42,292 --> 01:49:44,500
Jack. Come on, Jack.

1688
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,161
No.

1689
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:54,749
Are you all right now, Jack?

1690
01:49:54,875 --> 01:49:56,366
I...

1691
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:00,414
Now, you turn left, remember,
and go straight on down the canal.

1692
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,117
Have you enough for a taxi?

1693
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,699
Oh, God, they've woken up.

1694
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:10,749
Good night, Jack.

1695
01:50:10,875 --> 01:50:12,491
It's been lovely.

1696
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,616
Really it has.

1697
01:51:30,542 --> 01:51:31,578
That's enough.

1698
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:49,908
Joe! Joe!

1699
01:53:04,125 --> 01:53:06,117
Time to come home, Joe.

1700
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,208
It's all right, love.

1701
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:13,370
Everything's all right now.

1702
01:53:17,458 --> 01:53:18,494
I've...

1703
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,993
- ...murdered her.
- Oh, shush!

1704
01:53:24,125 --> 01:53:25,912
I've killed her.

1705
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:30,167
- Everybody knows I've killed her.
- Don't take on so.

1706
01:53:30,292 --> 01:53:32,875
I wasn't there, but I killed her.

1707
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:35,912
Nobody's blaming you, Joe.

1708
01:53:36,542 --> 01:53:39,865
You don't see it now,
but she'd have ruined your whole life.

1709
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:43,580
Oh, no, nobody will ever blame you, Joe.

1710
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:50,541
Nobody but... me.

1711
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:56,708
That's the trouble.

1712
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:12,618
I require and charge you both,

1713
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:16,664
as ye will answer
at the dreadful Day of Judgement

1714
01:54:16,792 --> 01:54:20,832
when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed,

1715
01:54:20,958 --> 01:54:23,701
that if either of you know any impediment

1716
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:27,782
why ye may not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony,

1717
01:54:27,917 --> 01:54:29,749
ye do now confess it,

1718
01:54:30,667 --> 01:54:32,533
for be ye well assured

1719
01:54:32,667 --> 01:54:37,332
that so many as are coupled together
otherwise than God's words doth allow

1720
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:39,950
are not joined together by God,

1721
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:42,621
neither is their matrimony lawful.

1722
01:54:44,042 --> 01:54:45,328
Joseph,

1723
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:49,292
wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife,

1724
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:53,405
to live together after God's ordinance

1725
01:54:53,542 --> 01:54:55,704
in the holy estate of matrimony?

1726
01:54:56,667 --> 01:55:01,992
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honour and keep her

1727
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,367
in sickness and in health

1728
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:08,708
and, forsaking all other,

1729
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:11,996
keep thee only unto her

1730
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:15,291
so long as ye both shall live?

1731
01:55:25,958 --> 01:55:26,994
I will.

1732
01:55:42,583 --> 01:55:44,495
Good luck, Joe.

1733
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:18,746
Joe, wasn't it absolutely
the most wonderful wedding?

1734
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:25,413
Now we really belong to each other,

1735
01:56:25,542 --> 01:56:27,158
"till death us do part".

1736
01:56:32,458 --> 01:56:34,370
Darling, you're crying.

1737
01:56:35,083 --> 01:56:38,281
I believe you really are
sentimental after all.
