1
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:57,954
<i>In the year of our Lord...</i>

2
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:03,076
<i>... Judea, for nearly a century,</i>
<i>had lain under the mastery of Rome.</i>

3
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,964
<i>In the seventh year of the reign</i>
<i>of Augustus Caesar...</i>

4
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,628
<i>... an imperial decree</i>
<i>ordered every Judean...</i>

5
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,298
<i>... each to return</i>
<i>to his place of birth...</i>

6
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,837
<i>... to be counted and taxed.</i>

7
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:18,720
<i>Converging ways of many of them led</i>
<i>to their capital city, Jerusalem...</i>

8
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:21,972
<i>... the troubled heart of their land.</i>

9
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:25,730
<i>The old city was dominated</i>
<i>by the fortress of Antonia...</i>

10
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,318
<i>... the seat of Roman power...</i>

11
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,650
<i>... and by the great golden temple...</i>

12
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:34,116
<i>... the outward sign of</i>
<i>an inward and imperishable faith.</i>

13
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,033
<i>Even while they obeyed</i>
<i>the will of Caesar...</i>

14
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,414
<i>... the people clung proudly</i>
<i>to their ancient heritage...</i>

15
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:44,627
<i>... always remembering</i>
<i>the promise of their prophets...</i>

16
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,129
<i>... that one day there would be</i>
<i>born among them a redeemer...</i>

17
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:51,924
<i>... to bring them salvation</i>
<i>and perfect freedom.</i>

18
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,720
You'll be counted at Hebron.

19
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,973
- Name?
- Samuel.

20
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:06,229
- What city?
- Joppa.

21
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,854
- What family?
- Michael.

22
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,897
- Move on. Move on.
- Yes.

23
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,692
- Name?
- Joseph.

24
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,449
- What city?
- Nazareth.

25
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,076
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.

26
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,492
And the woman?

27
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,030
My wife.

28
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:21,579
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

29
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,253
Come on, come on.

30
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,895
What village is this?

31
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,315
Nazareth.

32
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:51,568
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

33
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:13,627
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

34
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,053
We've seen Romans before.

35
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,381
Yes...

36
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:20,557
...and we will see them again.

37
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,646
My table is not finished.

38
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,402
Where is your son?

39
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:30,942
He's walking in the hills.

40
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,858
He neglects his work, Joseph.

41
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,328
No.

42
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:42,156
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

43
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,047
"I must be about my father's business."

44
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:47,788
Then why isn't he here, working?

45
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,463
He's working.

46
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,677
Trumpeters of the legion!

47
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:03,453
Welcome, Messala.

48
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,337
The command is yours.

49
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:06,953
Thank you.

50
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:09,961
Thank you for relieving me.

51
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:20,890
Drusus...

52
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,234
...when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

53
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:32,148
Now the wheel has turned.

54
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:34,781
I am in command.

55
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,505
Attention!

56
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,800
Aisle one, face right!

57
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,222
Forward!

58
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,890
I'd forgotten the heat.

59
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,190
If it were only the heat.

60
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:09,318
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.

61
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,021
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.

62
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:15,783
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

63
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:19,574
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

64
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,751
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

65
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,914
I asked to be sent here.

66
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,133
You'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

67
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,006
In what way?

68
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:38,428
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome...

69
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:42,060
There's nothing new in all that.

70
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,140
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

71
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,274
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

72
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:52,687
Punish them.

73
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:56,361
We do.

74
00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:59,324
When we can find them.

75
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,252
Find the leaders.

76
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:05,794
You don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

77
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:08,378
There are strange forces
at work here.

78
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:10,086
This "messiah" business...

79
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:12,971
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

80
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,055
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

81
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:19,762
Makes your head spin.

82
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,855
There's a wild man
in the desert named John...

83
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:25,063
...who drowns people in water.

84
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:29,225
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

85
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:31,895
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

86
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,322
No, no, no. This man is different.

87
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:38,196
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

88
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,335
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

89
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,247
You've been too long away from Rome.

90
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:48,925
Go back, Sextus.

91
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:51,584
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

92
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:54,970
...and forget that
God is in every man.

93
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:59,174
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.

94
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,893
The emperor is displeased.

95
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:06,100
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

96
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:09,521
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.

97
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:14,281
How? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

98
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,697
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?

99
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,741
Especially a new idea.

100
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,418
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

101
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:29,836
I assume he has a name.

102
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:34,215
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!

103
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,851
Tell him I will join him.

104
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:41,306
Yes, tribune.

105
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:43,470
Centurion!

106
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:52,823
This was his country
before it was ours.

107
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:54,440
Don't forget that.

108
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,360
Yes, tribune.

109
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,163
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

110
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,883
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

111
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,050
We were friends as boys.

112
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,345
We were like brothers.

113
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:17,965
Sextus...

114
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:21,978
...you ask how to fight an idea.

115
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,182
Well, I'll tell you how.

116
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,398
With another idea.

117
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:08,020
I said I'd come back.

118
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,398
I never thought you would.

119
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:14,867
I'm so glad.

120
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:25,336
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

121
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:28,796
You've come back a tribune.

122
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,006
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

123
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:35,634
We'll drink another now.

124
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,766
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.

125
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:41,895
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

126
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:43,481
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.

127
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,443
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

128
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:49,108
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

129
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,480
I can't wait to see them.

130
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:54,196
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

131
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,197
Or have you become too dignified?

132
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:18,434
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!

133
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:29,272
Where the beams cross?

134
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:44,253
Good.

135
00:24:03,148 --> 00:24:05,022
After all these years!

136
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:07,985
Still close.

137
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:09,861
In every way.

138
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,235
I hope so.

139
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:17,246
I know.

140
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,407
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...

141
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,337
...whose life you once saved.

142
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,131
The best thing I ever did.

143
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,052
Judah...

144
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,764
...it will be very difficult
to govern here.

145
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,603
I'm going to need help.

146
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,681
Your help. Your advice.

147
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,194
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.

148
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,820
Withdraw your legions.

149
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,790
Give us our freedom.

150
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:06,547
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

151
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,045
He's particularly fond of Judea.

152
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,094
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

153
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,922
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

154
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,053
My quarters.

155
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,525
A bit grim.

156
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,152
Not grim.

157
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,899
Austere. Virtuous.

158
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:31,657
Roman.

159
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:40,492
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

160
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:43,034
He's coming in a few days
with more legions.

161
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,249
Then the rumors are true.

162
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:53,508
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

163
00:25:54,223 --> 00:25:57,639
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

164
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:05,228
But you and your family
need have no concern.

165
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:08,236
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

166
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:11,446
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!

167
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:15,156
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

168
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,745
- They're my people. I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.

169
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:23,037
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

170
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:25,088
You've changed.

171
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:28,797
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

172
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,758
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber...

173
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:34,680
...was chosen to rule the world.

174
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:36,592
Your legions.

175
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,641
It wasn't just our legions.

176
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:45,354
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

177
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:46,647
Oh, no.

178
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:52,023
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

179
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:55,277
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

180
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:58,953
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

181
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,573
I believe in the future of my people.

182
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:05,460
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

183
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:07,923
How?

184
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:10,498
You're an aristocrat.

185
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:14,052
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.

186
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,933
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

187
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:19,633
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

188
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:23,186
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

189
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,771
It is worse than stupid, futile!

190
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:29,484
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

191
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:37,997
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

192
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:40,828
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

193
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,418
Then we're agreed!

194
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:46,627
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

195
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:51,379
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.

196
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:55,347
And now for our toast.

197
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,470
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

198
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,147
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

199
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,309
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

200
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:14,322
It's an insane world.

201
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:18,278
But in it there is one sanity:

202
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,406
The loyalty of old friends.

203
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:26,084
Judah, we must believe in one another.

204
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:28,542
Will you drink to that?

205
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,465
With all my heart.

206
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,989
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

207
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,988
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

208
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:04,420
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

209
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:07,998
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.

210
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:10,298
I would have that time again.

211
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,966
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

212
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,638
Except for the fountain.

213
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:19,011
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.

214
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:23,976
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

215
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,768
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?

216
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,525
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

217
00:29:32,742 --> 00:29:35,067
With great responsibilities.

218
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:37,329
Come.

219
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:41,950
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

220
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,123
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

221
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:53,300
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

222
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:56,515
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan. I was there last year.

223
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,267
A tremendous campaign.

224
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:01,928
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

225
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:05,350
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

226
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,436
Or was, till we destroyed it.

227
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,482
Now it's nothing but ashes.

228
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:16,032
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

229
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:20,159
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

230
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,331
Thank you for this.

231
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:26,494
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

232
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,731
What do you think of it?

233
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,860
Magnificent.

234
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:52,365
It's Arabic.

235
00:30:52,658 --> 00:30:55,992
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

236
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,864
Let me try him sometime.

237
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:00,572
Whenever you like. He's yours.

238
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,670
Do you mean you'll give me this?

239
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,006
Oh, Judah.

240
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:13,834
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

241
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:22,807
Judah, tell me, did you...

242
00:31:23,524 --> 00:31:24,983
...think about what I said?

243
00:31:25,193 --> 00:31:27,897
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

244
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:30,817
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

245
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:32,900
Most of the men agree with me.

246
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,116
Most? Not all?

247
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,198
No, not all.

248
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,659
Who does not agree?

249
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,829
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

250
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:44,088
Who are they?

251
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:50,295
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

252
00:31:57,351 --> 00:32:00,221
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

253
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,596
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

254
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:05,650
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

255
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,353
Patriots?!

256
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:19,159
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

257
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:24,586
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

258
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:27,709
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

259
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,416
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

260
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:33,922
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

261
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

262
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,056
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

263
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:42,014
I swear, this is the time.

264
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:46,063
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

265
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:49,776
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

266
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:55,566
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God. The only God.

267
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:59,832
He is power,
real power on earth, not...

268
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,954
Not that.

269
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:06,749
Help me, Judah.

270
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,963
I would do anything
for you, Messala...

271
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:15,474
...except betray my own people.

272
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:20,269
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

273
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:27,979
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

274
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:33,690
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

275
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,614
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

276
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:39,500
Future? You are a conquered people.

277
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:45,244
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

278
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:47,629
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

279
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,094
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

280
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:54,676
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

281
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,849
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

282
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,969
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

283
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:03,606
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

284
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:05,855
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

285
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,855
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

286
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:12,025
- I warn you...
- No! I warn you.

287
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,985
Rome is an affront to God.

288
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:17,571
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

289
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,242
But not forever.

290
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:23,207
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom...

291
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,172
...such as the world
has never heard before.

292
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:39,138
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

293
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:42,475
You're either for me or against me.

294
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:50,229
If that is the choice...

295
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,530
...then I am against you.

296
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,641
There they are.

297
00:35:24,317 --> 00:35:25,811
Where's Messala?

298
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,403
- Where's...?
- He's gone.

299
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:31,114
Gone?

300
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:34,444
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.

301
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,112
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.

302
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:41,119
Come. Let us have dinner.

303
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,303
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world...

304
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,926
...who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

305
00:36:07,486 --> 00:36:09,941
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

306
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:16,696
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

307
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:09,631
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.

308
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,344
Simonides.

309
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,805
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.

310
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,593
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

311
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:24,649
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

312
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,733
And for the master, Iberian wine.

313
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,862
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence.

314
00:37:30,072 --> 00:37:33,856
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

315
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:36,650
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.

316
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,663
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.

317
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:40,249
And what of Numidia?

318
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:44,077
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

319
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,872
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

320
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,926
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

321
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:53,001
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

322
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,838
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

323
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:59,427
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

324
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,388
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.

325
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:05,600
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

326
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:09,401
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

327
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:13,315
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

328
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:17,277
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

329
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:20,867
If it is the Lord's will,
I shall rejoice.

330
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:58,412
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

331
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:18,681
You're eager to marry, Esther?

332
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:22,931
It is my father's wish.

333
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:28,185
Your husband will be fortunate.

334
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,364
What is his name?

335
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,323
David, son of Mathias.

336
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:36,160
Of what house?

337
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:39,583
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.

338
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:42,575
Tell me more about him.

339
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:46,290
I have seen him only once.

340
00:39:46,507 --> 00:39:48,630
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

341
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,340
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

342
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:55,469
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

343
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,601
You are generous, master.

344
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,818
Do you love this man?

345
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,493
I will learn to love him.

346
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,805
You have my permission to marry.

347
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,973
We'll drink to your happiness.

348
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,429
And a safe return to Antioch.

349
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:10,086
I disturbed you.

350
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:11,761
No.

351
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,138
What were you thinking?

352
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:17,466
I was saying goodbye...

353
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:19,763
...to this city...

354
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,390
...and this house.

355
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,687
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

356
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,529
My father sometimes brought me here...

357
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,405
...when I was little.

358
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:41,582
It was a house
where I was always happy.

359
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,039
Except once.

360
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:50,336
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy...

361
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,636
- Messala.
- Yes.

362
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,548
You had been out hunting...

363
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,472
...and they brought you home injured.

364
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:03,888
I touched your face
as you lay there...

365
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:12,355
...and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die."

366
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:20,492
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

367
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:23,582
Yes, master.

368
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,253
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

369
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:33,251
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

370
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:40,091
And now...

371
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:43,432
...I hardly feel free.

372
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:49,560
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon...

373
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:51,898
...if there was among his slaves...

374
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,903
...some girl who filled his eyes...

375
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:58,247
...he could choose her out
from the rest...

376
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:00,959
...and take her to him.

377
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:04,125
Wise days of Solomon.

378
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:07,298
Different days.

379
00:43:10,344 --> 00:43:11,839
And long ago.

380
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:23,393
If you were not a bride...

381
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:26,689
...I should kiss you goodbye.

382
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:31,523
If I were not a bride...

383
00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:34,654
...there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

384
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,793
Your slave ring.

385
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:55,013
Fair exchange.

386
00:43:56,725 --> 00:43:59,929
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

387
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:02,015
You will wear it?

388
00:44:09,656 --> 00:44:12,277
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

389
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,119
Until then.

390
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,593
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

391
00:45:57,811 --> 00:46:01,061
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

392
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:02,975
Thank you, tribune.

393
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,519
I see no delegation from the city.

394
00:46:07,737 --> 00:46:09,896
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?

395
00:46:10,156 --> 00:46:12,481
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

396
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,488
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

397
00:46:16,162 --> 00:46:17,704
Let us proceed.

398
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:22,189
There's Messala.

399
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:35,194
He saw you, Judah.

400
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:06,318
The new governor.

401
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:23,664
Stand back!

402
00:48:25,756 --> 00:48:28,164
- Stand back.
- You, come!

403
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:30,294
Had to be the Jews!

404
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:39,471
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

405
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,732
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

406
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:55,826
Open up in the name of the law!

407
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:59,157
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.

408
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,533
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.

409
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:05,371
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

410
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,667
Open the gates!

411
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:15,390
I'll speak to them.

412
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:18,514
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.

413
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:21,011
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!

414
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:23,315
It was an accident.

415
00:49:25,401 --> 00:49:28,984
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

416
00:49:29,238 --> 00:49:32,738
- This is the man, sir. We saw him.
- It was an accident.

417
00:49:33,993 --> 00:49:35,321
- Accident?
- I swear it.

418
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:38,822
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

419
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,868
Take him. Take all of them.

420
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:44,999
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me! Let them go!

421
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:47,048
Attention!

422
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:53,842
Messala.

423
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,014
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

424
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,319
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

425
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,197
It was an accident.

426
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:26,712
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

427
00:50:32,388 --> 00:50:33,847
Let the servants go.

428
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:36,725
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

429
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:07,152
Come.

430
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,685
Where?

431
00:52:09,614 --> 00:52:10,657
Tirus.

432
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,650
Tirus?

433
00:52:15,912 --> 00:52:17,703
I've had no trial.

434
00:52:18,373 --> 00:52:21,244
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

435
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,165
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

436
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:27,672
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

437
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:29,377
Tie his hands.

438
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:35,547
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

439
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:07,924
Get along. Keep moving.

440
00:53:23,149 --> 00:53:24,394
Jailer!

441
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,066
Guard, in there!

442
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:30,445
Up the stairs!

443
00:53:30,823 --> 00:53:31,938
Jailer!

444
00:53:33,826 --> 00:53:34,941
Jailer!

445
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,408
To the right.

446
00:54:32,795 --> 00:54:35,037
- Wait!
- Send them out.

447
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:45,558
Go!

448
00:54:50,606 --> 00:54:51,685
The door.

449
00:55:00,408 --> 00:55:02,615
Where are my mother and sister?

450
00:55:14,464 --> 00:55:15,507
Where are they?

451
00:55:18,718 --> 00:55:20,925
Here, within these walls.

452
00:55:22,138 --> 00:55:24,676
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

453
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:28,969
Of course, they will be sentenced.

454
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,434
Is it possible?

455
00:55:37,612 --> 00:55:40,568
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

456
00:55:40,784 --> 00:55:42,907
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

457
00:55:46,164 --> 00:55:49,331
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!

458
00:55:53,672 --> 00:55:56,792
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!

459
00:55:57,009 --> 00:55:58,669
I know you're not.

460
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:01,928
You know?

461
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:07,174
You are evil.

462
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:10,135
No, Judah, I am not evil.

463
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:12,599
I wanted your help.

464
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:15,268
Now you've given it to me.

465
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:19,361
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

466
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:23,607
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

467
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:28,407
But not my family.

468
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:31,542
Let them go.

469
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,213
Please.

470
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:38,088
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?!

471
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:43,344
Didn't I beg you?

472
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:51,522
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

473
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:54,641
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die...

474
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,185
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

475
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:00,942
Go on, Judah.

476
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:03,280
Kill me!

477
00:57:16,216 --> 00:57:18,505
May God grant me vengeance.

478
00:57:18,718 --> 00:57:22,550
I will pray that
you live till I return.

479
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:24,641
Return?

480
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,261
Take him.

481
00:58:07,311 --> 00:58:08,353
Sentries, salute.

482
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,231
The tribune will see you now.

483
00:58:44,683 --> 00:58:48,302
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

484
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:51,099
I remember you.

485
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:55,189
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

486
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:59,193
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

487
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:00,985
Better than you.

488
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:05,703
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

489
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:08,162
The prisoners have been sentenced.

490
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:10,618
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.

491
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:14,335
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

492
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:17,335
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

493
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:19,839
In your heart, you must know it.

494
00:59:25,183 --> 00:59:26,346
Drusus.

495
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:34,649
This man had better be kept here
until we can question him.

496
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,335
Hold!

497
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,346
Water for the soldiers.

498
01:01:29,688 --> 01:01:31,480
Soldiers first!

499
01:01:34,193 --> 01:01:36,980
Get away from that well.
No water for them!

500
01:01:37,488 --> 01:01:40,062
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

501
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:43,160
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

502
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:50,036
- Water. Water.
- Soldiers first!

503
01:01:58,886 --> 01:01:59,886
Here.

504
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:23,952
Wait.

505
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,739
No water for him.

506
01:02:48,729 --> 01:02:49,929
God...

507
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,897
...help me.

508
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,661
You! I said no water for him!

509
01:04:24,078 --> 01:04:26,119
All right, on your feet, all of you!

510
01:04:26,373 --> 01:04:27,749
Get them on their feet!

511
01:04:28,876 --> 01:04:30,999
Back in line, you dog!

512
01:04:44,058 --> 01:04:45,468
On your feet!

513
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:47,310
Get them going!

514
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:53,849
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

515
01:04:56,904 --> 01:04:58,896
Forward, you dogs!

516
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:06,632
Soon, the counselor's barge
will be coming alongside.

517
01:06:06,852 --> 01:06:08,726
Be ready to raise oars.

518
01:06:14,943 --> 01:06:17,143
Raise oars!

519
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:22,282
Down oars!

520
01:06:40,888 --> 01:06:42,631
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

521
01:07:03,078 --> 01:07:05,913
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.

522
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,958
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.

523
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:47,037
This man is ill. Replace him.

524
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,414
- Change him.
- Right, sir.

525
01:07:55,299 --> 01:07:58,999
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.

526
01:07:59,303 --> 01:08:01,260
That will stop.

527
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:27,454
What service have you seen?

528
01:08:29,418 --> 01:08:30,829
Forty-one.

529
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:35,039
A month's less a day in this ship.

530
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:39,465
You keep an exact account.
And before?

531
01:08:39,678 --> 01:08:43,178
Three years in other ships.

532
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:46,557
Three years.

533
01:09:07,832 --> 01:09:10,288
You have the spirit to fight back...

534
01:09:10,919 --> 01:09:13,161
...but the good sense to control it.

535
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:20,376
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.

536
01:09:20,805 --> 01:09:24,968
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

537
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:27,136
It gives him strength.

538
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:30,896
Now, listen to me, all of you.

539
01:09:31,232 --> 01:09:35,775
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

540
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:42,491
So row well...

541
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:44,995
...and live.

542
01:09:53,547 --> 01:09:56,252
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.

543
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,950
Strike oars!

544
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,859
You know a fleet
of Macedonian galleys...

545
01:10:23,078 --> 01:10:25,866
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

546
01:10:26,457 --> 01:10:29,411
The emperor has honored us
with the task...

547
01:10:29,627 --> 01:10:32,248
...of seeking out and destroying them.

548
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:05,952
Battle speed, hortator.

549
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:10,491
Battle speed!

550
01:11:41,076 --> 01:11:42,274
Attack speed.

551
01:11:42,786 --> 01:11:44,577
Attack speed!

552
01:12:24,955 --> 01:12:26,153
Ramming speed.

553
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,000
Ramming speed!

554
01:13:43,161 --> 01:13:44,161
Rest.

555
01:13:44,997 --> 01:13:45,997
Halt!

556
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:48,666
Rest!

557
01:14:52,191 --> 01:14:53,353
Why are you here?

558
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,019
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

559
01:14:59,156 --> 01:15:00,756
Oh, yes.

560
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:02,992
I'd forgotten.

561
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,452
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

562
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:13,829
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

563
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,458
I'm not ready to die.

564
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:18,800
What do you think will save you?

565
01:15:19,262 --> 01:15:21,634
The God of my fathers.

566
01:15:23,224 --> 01:15:25,181
Your God has forsaken you.

567
01:15:25,393 --> 01:15:28,596
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

568
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:32,645
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

569
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:34,317
I might.

570
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:37,731
Does that interest you, 41?

571
01:15:39,782 --> 01:15:41,859
I can see that it does.

572
01:15:43,161 --> 01:15:46,328
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments...

573
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,327
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

574
01:15:49,543 --> 01:15:52,663
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

575
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:55,086
Would you like to become one of them?

576
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:57,464
To die as your slave?

577
01:15:57,884 --> 01:16:00,210
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

578
01:16:00,846 --> 01:16:02,885
I will not be here forever.

579
01:16:04,308 --> 01:16:05,308
No?

580
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,269
What would you do if you escaped?

581
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:17,519
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister...

582
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,980
...though they were innocent.
I won't rest...

583
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:22,027
Do not say that you were innocent.

584
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,530
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.

585
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:30,875
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

586
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:35,298
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

587
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:38,468
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these years...

588
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,421
...to die chained to an oar.

589
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:44,256
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep...

590
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,345
...to believe that
existence has a purpose.

591
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,773
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

592
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:53,476
As you have.

593
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,311
What drove it out of you?

594
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,443
Go back to your oar, 41.

595
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:19,049
Consul, enemy sighted.

596
01:17:20,137 --> 01:17:22,593
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

597
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,267
All the watch to battle posts.

598
01:17:37,196 --> 01:17:39,355
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.

599
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:40,984
Hurry, quick!

600
01:17:43,495 --> 01:17:46,282
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

601
01:17:51,878 --> 01:17:54,001
Raise oars!

602
01:17:55,215 --> 01:17:57,215
Down oars!

603
01:17:57,926 --> 01:17:58,969
Chain rowers!

604
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:23,069
Guard.

605
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,325
Unlock 41.

606
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,998
No! I don't want to die!

607
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,002
I don't want to die!

608
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:05,661
41, why did he do that?

609
01:19:06,457 --> 01:19:07,868
I don't know.

610
01:19:10,628 --> 01:19:13,629
Once before, a man helped me.

611
01:19:14,548 --> 01:19:16,625
I didn't know why then.

612
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:20,652
Normal speed!

613
01:19:57,509 --> 01:19:59,715
Number 1, flame.

614
01:20:00,846 --> 01:20:01,846
Fire.

615
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:15,569
Fire!

616
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:17,321
Fire!

617
01:20:23,037 --> 01:20:24,994
Hold withdrawal on command.

618
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:29,286
Lift oars! Raise!

619
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,501
Withdraw!

620
01:20:34,089 --> 01:20:35,169
Steersman, right.

621
01:20:42,973 --> 01:20:44,681
Extend oars!

622
01:20:46,393 --> 01:20:47,393
Fire!

623
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:10,669
- Watch out!
- Fire!

624
01:21:27,311 --> 01:21:30,312
Steersman, ram course! Order below!

625
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:32,765
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!

626
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:46,742
Consul, barge on ramming course.

627
01:21:54,339 --> 01:21:57,957
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

628
01:26:53,068 --> 01:26:54,478
Why did you save me?

629
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,818
Why did you have me unchained?

630
01:27:20,513 --> 01:27:23,051
What is your name, 41?

631
01:27:25,309 --> 01:27:26,887
Judah Ben-Hur.

632
01:27:27,895 --> 01:27:29,804
Judah Ben-Hur...

633
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,769
...let me die.

634
01:27:36,028 --> 01:27:39,314
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

635
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,282
Row well and live.

636
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,540
Is the sail square?

637
01:28:00,555 --> 01:28:02,464
I can't tell.

638
01:28:03,933 --> 01:28:06,471
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

639
01:28:07,895 --> 01:28:08,975
My death.

640
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,272
Your freedom.

641
01:28:15,945 --> 01:28:18,068
It's a Roman sail.

642
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:49,313
Face rear!

643
01:28:49,522 --> 01:28:53,567
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

644
01:28:56,947 --> 01:28:58,109
Water.

645
01:29:02,578 --> 01:29:04,535
The fleet, all lost?

646
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:06,413
Five galleys.

647
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:10,374
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.

648
01:29:10,753 --> 01:29:12,128
You have a victory.

649
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,752
- It was a victory?
- Complete.

650
01:29:34,443 --> 01:29:36,685
In His eagerness to save you...

651
01:29:36,946 --> 01:29:40,564
...your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

652
01:30:15,069 --> 01:30:17,469
Hail Arrius!

653
01:30:20,241 --> 01:30:22,365
Right oars!

654
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:20,343
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

655
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:24,673
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

656
01:33:32,525 --> 01:33:35,526
This man riding beside you, who is he?

657
01:33:35,945 --> 01:33:39,029
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

658
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,280
Is that all you know about him?

659
01:33:43,746 --> 01:33:48,539
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

660
01:33:48,751 --> 01:33:50,625
But he was innocent.

661
01:33:50,837 --> 01:33:53,624
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man...

662
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,252
...who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

663
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:02,174
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

664
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:34,796
We have all the information
on this man...

665
01:34:35,007 --> 01:34:37,462
...a man of some influence
in his own country.

666
01:34:37,843 --> 01:34:42,008
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

667
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:45,094
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

668
01:34:45,518 --> 01:34:48,934
Consul, allow us to continue.

669
01:34:50,106 --> 01:34:52,514
Allow us to be generous.

670
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:56,985
As a reward to you
for your great victory...

671
01:34:57,322 --> 01:35:01,022
...we shall not send him back to
the galleys. Take him as your slave.

672
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:07,870
Such is the will of the senate...

673
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:10,666
...and the people of Rome.

674
01:36:31,295 --> 01:36:33,537
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

675
01:36:33,756 --> 01:36:36,544
...with a young man
who had saved my life.

676
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,963
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

677
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,679
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

678
01:36:50,023 --> 01:36:54,685
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

679
01:36:55,737 --> 01:36:58,406
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements...

680
01:36:58,865 --> 01:37:01,023
...which I thought
I should never have again.

681
01:37:06,499 --> 01:37:08,622
Nothing could make stronger
our bond...

682
01:37:08,834 --> 01:37:11,372
...but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

683
01:37:12,546 --> 01:37:16,496
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

684
01:37:16,717 --> 01:37:19,884
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name...

685
01:37:20,096 --> 01:37:22,302
...and the heir to my property.

686
01:37:26,936 --> 01:37:29,343
This ring of my ancestors...

687
01:37:29,939 --> 01:37:31,978
...would have gone to my son.

688
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:36,029
So now it is yours.

689
01:37:57,051 --> 01:38:01,797
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life...

690
01:38:02,598 --> 01:38:04,176
...a new home...

691
01:38:05,143 --> 01:38:06,637
...a new father.

692
01:38:08,146 --> 01:38:10,269
It brought me here.

693
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:12,933
It may take me away.

694
01:38:13,735 --> 01:38:15,526
But wherever I may be...

695
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:19,942
...I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

696
01:38:20,491 --> 01:38:23,612
With gratitude and affection...

697
01:38:24,872 --> 01:38:26,200
...and with honor.

698
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:48,348
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

699
01:38:48,605 --> 01:38:51,772
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

700
01:38:51,983 --> 01:38:53,976
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

701
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:56,482
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

702
01:38:56,696 --> 01:38:59,152
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.

703
01:38:59,366 --> 01:39:02,153
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

704
01:39:02,369 --> 01:39:04,279
Not for Judeans.

705
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:11,250
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

706
01:39:11,504 --> 01:39:13,247
- Of Judea?
- Yes.

707
01:39:13,464 --> 01:39:14,923
I asked for Alexandria.

708
01:39:15,132 --> 01:39:18,003
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

709
01:39:18,219 --> 01:39:21,303
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

710
01:39:21,514 --> 01:39:24,965
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

711
01:39:25,226 --> 01:39:27,633
Goats and Jehovah.

712
01:39:46,165 --> 01:39:47,541
You're leaving.

713
01:39:50,712 --> 01:39:52,112
I must.

714
01:39:53,589 --> 01:39:56,045
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

715
01:39:57,593 --> 01:40:02,054
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

716
01:40:02,265 --> 01:40:06,013
But still, my counsel is to wait.

717
01:40:06,227 --> 01:40:08,683
Gratus is to be replaced.

718
01:40:08,938 --> 01:40:12,105
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

719
01:40:15,945 --> 01:40:16,945
When?

720
01:40:17,572 --> 01:40:19,031
Very soon.

721
01:40:19,615 --> 01:40:21,904
It's very much to our purpose.

722
01:40:23,078 --> 01:40:27,657
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

723
01:40:30,837 --> 01:40:35,084
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

724
01:40:42,057 --> 01:40:44,345
Will Rome see you again?

725
01:40:51,483 --> 01:40:55,017
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

726
01:40:56,613 --> 01:40:58,440
I shall remember it.

727
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:06,073
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

728
01:41:06,999 --> 01:41:08,410
They have their way.

729
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:50,683
Forgive me.

730
01:42:51,066 --> 01:42:53,272
You're a stranger here.

731
01:42:54,527 --> 01:42:56,935
Would you be from Nazareth?

732
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:00,610
Why do you ask?

733
01:43:01,117 --> 01:43:02,160
I thought...

734
01:43:03,746 --> 01:43:06,035
...you might be the one...

735
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:11,625
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

736
01:43:15,591 --> 01:43:18,047
He would be about your age.

737
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,220
Who?

738
01:43:23,766 --> 01:43:25,594
When I find Him...

739
01:43:26,979 --> 01:43:28,521
...I shall know Him.

740
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:37,229
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

741
01:43:37,489 --> 01:43:39,945
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.

742
01:43:40,826 --> 01:43:42,617
Sack of flesh without brains!

743
01:43:42,828 --> 01:43:45,580
No! No! Not the whip!

744
01:43:47,166 --> 01:43:48,246
That is my host.

745
01:43:48,459 --> 01:43:49,622
Gently! Gently!

746
01:43:50,253 --> 01:43:53,752
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

747
01:43:53,965 --> 01:43:57,334
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood.

748
01:43:57,552 --> 01:44:01,680
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

749
01:44:06,894 --> 01:44:10,394
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

750
01:44:11,232 --> 01:44:12,477
Beautiful horses.

751
01:44:24,164 --> 01:44:26,619
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

752
01:44:33,381 --> 01:44:35,837
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

753
01:44:38,011 --> 01:44:39,411
No! No!

754
01:44:42,432 --> 01:44:44,590
Abadon, stop him!

755
01:44:46,603 --> 01:44:47,978
Stop that whip!

756
01:44:48,188 --> 01:44:50,180
I'll kill him! I'll kill...!

757
01:44:55,695 --> 01:44:58,862
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

758
01:45:01,951 --> 01:45:04,704
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?!

759
01:45:06,207 --> 01:45:09,042
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

760
01:45:09,293 --> 01:45:10,871
Get off, idiot!

761
01:45:16,217 --> 01:45:17,794
Drive goats, not horses!

762
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:20,169
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

763
01:45:20,388 --> 01:45:23,639
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

764
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,514
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

765
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:30,141
Not a team?

766
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:33,192
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

767
01:45:33,402 --> 01:45:35,690
- Antares.
- The slow one?

768
01:45:35,904 --> 01:45:40,233
He should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

769
01:45:45,999 --> 01:45:49,414
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

770
01:45:49,627 --> 01:45:51,501
In the circus in Rome.

771
01:45:53,548 --> 01:45:56,121
You have driven in the great circus?

772
01:45:57,844 --> 01:46:02,173
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

773
01:46:02,432 --> 01:46:03,974
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

774
01:46:04,183 --> 01:46:06,259
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

775
01:46:06,519 --> 01:46:08,595
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

776
01:46:08,813 --> 01:46:10,971
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

777
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:14,559
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

778
01:46:16,446 --> 01:46:20,396
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

779
01:46:20,617 --> 01:46:23,287
No other animal has
descended so in scale...

780
01:46:23,495 --> 01:46:26,070
...from the first innocent falling
of the world.

781
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:30,874
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

782
01:46:31,087 --> 01:46:34,539
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

783
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:37,042
Judah Ben-Hur.

784
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,095
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

785
01:46:40,305 --> 01:46:41,305
Yes.

786
01:46:43,058 --> 01:46:47,055
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

787
01:46:47,896 --> 01:46:50,517
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

788
01:46:50,732 --> 01:46:53,305
We might have achieved wonders!

789
01:46:53,526 --> 01:46:55,353
You have to go.

790
01:46:59,783 --> 01:47:01,822
I make a journey which will not wait.

791
01:47:02,035 --> 01:47:04,361
Ah, well, then perhaps
you will come back.

792
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,988
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

793
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,916
I have no wives.

794
01:47:09,168 --> 01:47:11,077
No wives at all?

795
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,709
I have six, no, seven.

796
01:47:13,923 --> 01:47:15,583
I've counted eight.

797
01:47:15,883 --> 01:47:19,087
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

798
01:47:19,304 --> 01:47:22,673
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

799
01:47:22,891 --> 01:47:25,560
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!

800
01:47:25,811 --> 01:47:30,188
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

801
01:47:30,524 --> 01:47:32,481
It is not generous.

802
01:47:37,739 --> 01:47:41,488
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.

803
01:47:53,464 --> 01:47:55,374
Thank you. Thank you.

804
01:47:55,591 --> 01:48:00,253
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

805
01:48:01,472 --> 01:48:05,055
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

806
01:48:05,727 --> 01:48:08,514
When ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

807
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:11,565
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

808
01:48:12,108 --> 01:48:14,433
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.

809
01:48:14,652 --> 01:48:16,609
Stay and see them.

810
01:48:30,503 --> 01:48:33,421
Come, my children. Come.

811
01:48:39,512 --> 01:48:41,172
Strangers make them shy.

812
01:48:42,515 --> 01:48:43,515
Come.

813
01:48:43,892 --> 01:48:46,727
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

814
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:54,565
There, my children.

815
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:57,738
They are descended from
the Arabians of the Pharaohs...

816
01:48:57,947 --> 01:49:00,273
...and I have named them
for the stars.

817
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:03,571
Come, Antares.

818
01:49:03,829 --> 01:49:07,364
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

819
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:10,121
What? Yes, yes.

820
01:49:10,336 --> 01:49:14,120
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

821
01:49:14,382 --> 01:49:15,581
Come, Rigel.

822
01:49:15,801 --> 01:49:19,501
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

823
01:49:19,888 --> 01:49:21,086
There's my good Rigel.

824
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:25,675
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

825
01:49:26,978 --> 01:49:29,470
The day's work done for you, eh?

826
01:49:30,774 --> 01:49:33,146
Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

827
01:49:33,402 --> 01:49:35,809
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

828
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:41,151
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

829
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:45,076
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

830
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:49,997
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

831
01:49:50,211 --> 01:49:52,204
You should see their mother, Mira.

832
01:49:52,422 --> 01:49:55,458
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

833
01:49:55,675 --> 01:49:57,632
All right, all right.

834
01:50:02,015 --> 01:50:05,799
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

835
01:50:06,561 --> 01:50:10,143
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

836
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:15,188
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

837
01:50:15,946 --> 01:50:18,437
You must be strong and swift.

838
01:50:18,657 --> 01:50:21,113
Go, my children. Go.

839
01:50:25,498 --> 01:50:28,583
At Jerusalem, they'll race
the world's finest teams...

840
01:50:28,793 --> 01:50:32,542
...and the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

841
01:50:32,756 --> 01:50:34,416
He stops at nothing to win.

842
01:50:34,674 --> 01:50:37,509
- Messala? In the circus?
- Yes.

843
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:39,379
You knew him?

844
01:50:40,472 --> 01:50:41,670
I know him.

845
01:50:42,057 --> 01:50:44,263
Perhaps without much liking.

846
01:50:47,812 --> 01:50:49,604
My people are praying for a man...

847
01:50:49,814 --> 01:50:52,352
...to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

848
01:50:52,567 --> 01:50:54,690
You could be that man, the one...

849
01:50:54,903 --> 01:50:57,026
...to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

850
01:50:57,238 --> 01:51:00,358
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them...

851
01:51:00,617 --> 01:51:04,236
...one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

852
01:51:04,455 --> 01:51:06,198
It's not possible.

853
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,124
That is a pity.

854
01:51:10,127 --> 01:51:12,168
Think of it. To break his pride...

855
01:51:12,381 --> 01:51:15,880
...to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

856
01:51:16,093 --> 01:51:20,636
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

857
01:51:21,264 --> 01:51:23,423
I know it is not possible.

858
01:51:23,809 --> 01:51:26,560
Does it not delight your imagination?

859
01:51:28,021 --> 01:51:30,346
Does it not answer your purpose?

860
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,606
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

861
01:51:34,277 --> 01:51:36,436
And your way is to kill him.

862
01:51:40,242 --> 01:51:43,112
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes.

863
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:47,708
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to kill him.

864
01:51:48,126 --> 01:51:50,498
He will be punished inevitably.

865
01:51:51,587 --> 01:51:53,212
I don't believe in miracles.

866
01:51:54,257 --> 01:51:56,166
But all life is a miracle.

867
01:51:56,384 --> 01:51:58,709
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

868
01:52:01,597 --> 01:52:03,507
You do not believe in miracles.

869
01:52:04,392 --> 01:52:07,428
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness...

870
01:52:07,645 --> 01:52:10,314
...and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem...

871
01:52:10,524 --> 01:52:13,608
...where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

872
01:52:13,819 --> 01:52:15,693
And God lived in this child.

873
01:52:16,822 --> 01:52:20,689
By now, He is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

874
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:22,611
That is why I have returned here...

875
01:52:22,828 --> 01:52:25,616
...so that I may be at hand
when He comes among us.

876
01:52:27,834 --> 01:52:29,412
He is near.

877
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:34,038
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

878
01:52:34,591 --> 01:52:38,505
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

879
01:52:39,179 --> 01:52:41,337
Perhaps He is a shepherd...

880
01:52:41,556 --> 01:52:44,427
...a merchant, a fisherman.

881
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:46,642
But He lives...

882
01:52:46,853 --> 01:52:51,182
...and all our lives from now on
will carry His mark.

883
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,111
There are many paths to God, my son.

884
01:52:57,238 --> 01:52:59,480
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

885
01:53:10,337 --> 01:53:12,164
I'm ready for sleep.

886
01:53:26,603 --> 01:53:29,011
Balthasar is a good man...

887
01:53:29,231 --> 01:53:33,478
...but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

888
01:53:33,777 --> 01:53:35,853
And our intention true.

889
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:38,774
So I must leave you.

890
01:53:40,992 --> 01:53:42,866
One last thought.

891
01:53:43,078 --> 01:53:45,784
There is no law in the arena.

892
01:53:46,666 --> 01:53:48,493
Many are killed.

893
01:53:51,254 --> 01:53:52,582
I hope to see you again.

894
01:54:08,564 --> 01:54:10,936
Fine Damascus silk.

895
01:54:11,233 --> 01:54:13,558
Fine Damascus silk.

896
01:56:20,701 --> 01:56:22,076
Esther?

897
01:56:33,631 --> 01:56:35,375
It's Judah.

898
01:56:43,641 --> 01:56:45,551
You are alive.

899
01:56:46,603 --> 01:56:48,845
You are alive.

900
01:56:50,607 --> 01:56:54,557
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

901
01:57:03,996 --> 01:57:05,326
I'm here.

902
01:57:07,292 --> 01:57:08,455
I'm with you.

903
01:57:14,966 --> 01:57:16,626
Where's your father?

904
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:25,472
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

905
01:57:25,936 --> 01:57:27,727
They tortured him.

906
01:57:28,188 --> 01:57:32,731
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

907
01:57:34,194 --> 01:57:38,939
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

908
01:57:39,574 --> 01:57:41,781
You never went back to Antioch?

909
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,160
No.

910
01:57:43,578 --> 01:57:47,992
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

911
01:57:54,549 --> 01:57:56,506
Where are my mother and sister?

912
01:58:06,145 --> 01:58:08,184
Let me tell him first.

913
01:58:26,708 --> 01:58:27,906
Father.

914
01:58:29,169 --> 01:58:31,873
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

915
01:58:33,214 --> 01:58:35,290
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.

916
01:58:36,718 --> 01:58:40,051
He has come home. He is here.

917
01:58:57,739 --> 01:58:58,939
Judah.

918
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:03,235
Judah Ben-Hur.

919
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:08,074
My dear old friend.

920
01:59:10,087 --> 01:59:12,044
Let me look at you.

921
01:59:12,589 --> 01:59:14,131
Let me see you.

922
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:18,504
Yes, yes. It is true.

923
01:59:19,262 --> 01:59:22,845
Praise God for His mercy.

924
01:59:44,413 --> 01:59:45,789
Where are they?

925
01:59:46,999 --> 01:59:50,203
Since that terrible day...

926
01:59:51,129 --> 01:59:53,667
...there has been no word of them.

927
02:00:09,523 --> 02:00:11,516
You should have been less loyal.

928
02:00:11,734 --> 02:00:13,726
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

929
02:00:13,944 --> 02:00:16,980
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

930
02:00:18,532 --> 02:00:22,660
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

931
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:24,947
We were released on the same day.

932
02:00:25,165 --> 02:00:29,992
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

933
02:00:30,211 --> 02:00:32,619
Since then, I have been his tongue...

934
02:00:32,839 --> 02:00:34,499
...and he has been my legs.

935
02:00:34,716 --> 02:00:37,919
Together, we make a considerable man.

936
02:00:39,846 --> 02:00:41,471
Old friend.

937
02:00:42,932 --> 02:00:45,720
She always said you would return.

938
02:00:45,935 --> 02:00:48,261
She never gave up hope.

939
02:00:50,357 --> 02:00:52,930
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

940
02:00:54,235 --> 02:00:58,068
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

941
02:00:59,408 --> 02:01:01,697
But suppose that isn't possible.

942
02:01:01,911 --> 02:01:04,484
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

943
02:01:05,415 --> 02:01:07,538
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

944
02:01:07,751 --> 02:01:10,668
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

945
02:01:10,879 --> 02:01:11,994
It is there still...

946
02:01:12,214 --> 02:01:15,630
...to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

947
02:01:18,929 --> 02:01:21,254
That's not why I came back.

948
02:01:21,515 --> 02:01:24,432
Judah, they are dead.

949
02:01:24,851 --> 02:01:29,513
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

950
02:01:34,277 --> 02:01:37,195
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

951
02:01:37,906 --> 02:01:40,112
Yes, it is true.

952
02:01:42,452 --> 02:01:45,252
Judah Ben-Hur.

953
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:51,707
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

954
02:01:51,921 --> 02:01:55,041
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

955
02:01:55,259 --> 02:01:56,587
- Let us laugh.
- We will.

956
02:01:56,802 --> 02:01:58,676
There will be joy again
in this house.

957
02:01:58,887 --> 02:02:01,841
We will celebrate among the dust.

958
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:16,279
I will take him.

959
02:02:47,854 --> 02:02:49,811
We stood here before.

960
02:02:53,068 --> 02:02:55,108
A long while ago.

961
02:02:56,238 --> 02:02:57,649
Four years.

962
02:03:01,535 --> 02:03:03,327
But now it seems as if...

963
02:03:03,954 --> 02:03:05,865
...only yesterday...

964
02:03:07,793 --> 02:03:09,287
I was saying:

965
02:03:11,546 --> 02:03:15,295
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye."

966
02:03:17,344 --> 02:03:19,467
"If I were not a bride...

967
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:22,467
...there would be
no goodbyes to be said."

968
02:03:33,193 --> 02:03:35,020
I am not a bride.

969
02:04:06,979 --> 02:04:09,221
Why did you never marry?

970
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:13,191
My father needed me.

971
02:04:17,948 --> 02:04:19,323
And also...

972
02:04:28,251 --> 02:04:30,244
It's still on my finger.

973
02:04:32,589 --> 02:04:37,334
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

974
02:04:44,267 --> 02:04:46,936
It's become a part of my hand.

975
02:04:55,738 --> 02:04:58,774
If Messala once knew you were here...

976
02:04:59,241 --> 02:05:00,652
As he must.

977
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:03,201
He will know where they are.

978
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:12,998
And if you should find...?

979
02:05:15,759 --> 02:05:19,459
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.

980
02:05:25,018 --> 02:05:28,268
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

981
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:31,062
My father is burned up with it.

982
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:37,778
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater...

983
02:05:37,989 --> 02:05:40,825
...and love more powerful than hatred.

984
02:05:41,952 --> 02:05:43,446
I believe it.

985
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:45,989
- Esther.
- Judah.

986
02:05:46,541 --> 02:05:48,201
Stay alive.

987
02:05:48,793 --> 02:05:50,751
Keep away from Messala.

988
02:05:51,004 --> 02:05:53,840
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

989
02:05:55,968 --> 02:05:57,960
That time isn't yet come.

990
02:05:58,178 --> 02:06:02,674
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

991
02:06:03,183 --> 02:06:05,888
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

992
02:06:06,103 --> 02:06:08,309
This time you will be destroyed.

993
02:06:08,522 --> 02:06:10,064
You'll die.

994
02:06:53,903 --> 02:06:57,437
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

995
02:06:57,656 --> 02:07:00,326
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

996
02:07:00,534 --> 02:07:02,610
Thank him. Bring him to me.

997
02:07:03,454 --> 02:07:08,746
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.

998
02:07:09,086 --> 02:07:10,705
Why is he presenting me with gifts?

999
02:07:12,672 --> 02:07:15,045
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.

1000
02:07:16,968 --> 02:07:18,676
It's magnificent.

1001
02:07:18,887 --> 02:07:20,796
And from a man I've never met.

1002
02:07:21,014 --> 02:07:23,054
You're wrong, Messala.

1003
02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:50,627
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

1004
02:07:51,964 --> 02:07:54,253
You were the magician, Messala.

1005
02:07:54,466 --> 02:07:56,755
You condemned me to the galleys.

1006
02:07:57,511 --> 02:08:00,298
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

1007
02:08:12,526 --> 02:08:14,151
You know his seal?

1008
02:08:26,166 --> 02:08:28,075
Now I have come back...

1009
02:08:28,376 --> 02:08:30,748
...as I swore I would.

1010
02:08:36,259 --> 02:08:40,471
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

1011
02:08:41,514 --> 02:08:44,219
You suggest I use it on myself?

1012
02:08:45,728 --> 02:08:49,595
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

1013
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:56,397
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

1014
02:08:57,073 --> 02:08:58,401
Find them, Messala.

1015
02:08:59,909 --> 02:09:02,447
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed...

1016
02:09:02,661 --> 02:09:06,197
...with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

1017
02:09:09,795 --> 02:09:12,879
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.

1018
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:14,132
Then get it.

1019
02:09:19,054 --> 02:09:21,260
I will come back tomorrow.

1020
02:09:22,182 --> 02:09:24,969
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1021
02:09:39,866 --> 02:09:41,526
What became of them?

1022
02:09:41,827 --> 02:09:45,363
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

1023
02:09:45,582 --> 02:09:48,204
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1024
02:09:48,419 --> 02:09:50,625
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!

1025
02:10:05,602 --> 02:10:08,687
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter."

1026
02:10:08,897 --> 02:10:11,435
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

1027
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:13,276
E section...

1028
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:16,064
...lower level.

1029
02:10:17,197 --> 02:10:20,447
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

1030
02:10:38,136 --> 02:10:39,299
Water.

1031
02:10:39,846 --> 02:10:40,961
Water.

1032
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:42,879
Let me out!

1033
02:11:18,512 --> 02:11:21,382
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.

1034
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:25,684
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

1035
02:11:28,939 --> 02:11:30,647
The food disappears.

1036
02:12:05,102 --> 02:12:06,477
Lepers.

1037
02:12:35,759 --> 02:12:38,630
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

1038
02:12:38,888 --> 02:12:40,512
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1039
02:13:27,312 --> 02:13:28,854
Is someone there?

1040
02:13:34,486 --> 02:13:36,609
There is someone there.

1041
02:13:49,962 --> 02:13:51,207
Who are you?

1042
02:13:54,341 --> 02:13:56,132
Don't come any closer.

1043
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:00,472
Who are you?

1044
02:14:03,851 --> 02:14:04,893
Esther.

1045
02:14:06,854 --> 02:14:08,182
It's Miriam.

1046
02:14:08,731 --> 02:14:09,845
Miriam.

1047
02:14:12,192 --> 02:14:13,473
Miriam?

1048
02:14:16,155 --> 02:14:18,313
Stay where you are.

1049
02:14:20,534 --> 02:14:22,408
You have come home.

1050
02:14:24,163 --> 02:14:26,240
Stand back, Esther.

1051
02:14:34,924 --> 02:14:36,384
We are lepers.

1052
02:14:49,982 --> 02:14:51,607
Oh, Esther.

1053
02:14:53,527 --> 02:14:54,808
Tirzah.

1054
02:15:03,579 --> 02:15:05,038
Esther...

1055
02:15:06,792 --> 02:15:09,117
...is Judah living?

1056
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,755
Yes, he is alive.

1057
02:15:13,548 --> 02:15:15,256
He is here.

1058
02:15:18,095 --> 02:15:19,137
Where?

1059
02:15:21,056 --> 02:15:24,472
He is searching for you now.

1060
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:27,727
I must find him and tell him.

1061
02:15:27,938 --> 02:15:29,136
- No!
- Tell my father.

1062
02:15:29,356 --> 02:15:30,356
No.

1063
02:15:31,483 --> 02:15:33,191
Tell no one.

1064
02:15:35,905 --> 02:15:39,356
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

1065
02:15:39,784 --> 02:15:41,326
We won't return.

1066
02:15:44,539 --> 02:15:46,663
Judah has to be told.

1067
02:15:47,126 --> 02:15:48,126
No.

1068
02:15:51,171 --> 02:15:52,286
Please.

1069
02:16:11,608 --> 02:16:14,064
I couldn't see his face.

1070
02:16:15,863 --> 02:16:17,487
Is it changed?

1071
02:16:20,409 --> 02:16:23,493
No, he is not changed.

1072
02:16:29,169 --> 02:16:30,960
He's not changed.

1073
02:16:33,299 --> 02:16:35,375
You love him, Esther.

1074
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:48,228
Promise me...

1075
02:16:48,856 --> 02:16:50,932
...on your love for him...

1076
02:16:52,193 --> 02:16:54,862
...you will never tell him
you've seen us.

1077
02:17:03,954 --> 02:17:05,913
Is he never to know?

1078
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,493
Let him remember us as we were.

1079
02:17:14,091 --> 02:17:15,289
Promise me.

1080
02:17:25,977 --> 02:17:29,263
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1081
02:17:30,315 --> 02:17:31,976
Only this.

1082
02:17:39,117 --> 02:17:40,825
I promise.

1083
02:17:44,914 --> 02:17:46,658
I am content.

1084
02:18:06,061 --> 02:18:07,061
Wait.

1085
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:55,483
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

1086
02:18:55,696 --> 02:18:59,776
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

1087
02:18:59,992 --> 02:19:01,866
He'll free them.

1088
02:19:02,078 --> 02:19:04,200
He wants to survive.

1089
02:19:05,706 --> 02:19:07,499
He cannot free them, Judah.

1090
02:19:11,379 --> 02:19:12,422
What do you mean?

1091
02:19:21,515 --> 02:19:22,557
I saw them.

1092
02:19:22,974 --> 02:19:24,634
You saw them?

1093
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:26,014
Where?

1094
02:19:26,228 --> 02:19:27,889
When did you see them?

1095
02:19:33,528 --> 02:19:34,986
They were dead.

1096
02:19:37,573 --> 02:19:39,233
They were dead.

1097
02:19:41,369 --> 02:19:42,369
When?

1098
02:19:44,038 --> 02:19:46,411
When? When?!

1099
02:19:48,752 --> 02:19:50,163
In the prison.

1100
02:19:52,381 --> 02:19:55,251
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

1101
02:19:59,888 --> 02:20:01,680
Why didn't you tell me?

1102
02:20:07,396 --> 02:20:08,807
I couldn't tell you.

1103
02:20:10,065 --> 02:20:11,809
Nor even you, Father.

1104
02:20:13,485 --> 02:20:15,893
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala...

1105
02:20:16,697 --> 02:20:19,947
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

1106
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:21,534
It's over now.

1107
02:20:22,035 --> 02:20:23,035
Over?

1108
02:20:24,163 --> 02:20:25,740
- Judah.
- Over?

1109
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,479
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

1110
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:12,298
Gentlemen.

1111
02:26:12,518 --> 02:26:13,561
Officers.

1112
02:26:15,263 --> 02:26:17,977
Defenders of great Rome's Imperium...

1113
02:26:19,066 --> 02:26:20,726
...may I enter?

1114
02:26:21,402 --> 02:26:22,896
Certainly, sheik.

1115
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:25,313
You do us an unexpected honor.

1116
02:26:26,449 --> 02:26:28,821
The noble tribune is most gracious.

1117
02:26:38,419 --> 02:26:39,462
And now...

1118
02:26:39,587 --> 02:26:41,414
...the question you're asking:

1119
02:26:41,630 --> 02:26:43,290
Why am I here?

1120
02:26:43,758 --> 02:26:45,715
As you know, I am a gambling man.

1121
02:26:45,926 --> 02:26:47,208
The games approach.

1122
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:52,506
I am racing my whites against the
noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

1123
02:26:52,726 --> 02:26:54,884
I will back my own poor horses.

1124
02:26:55,103 --> 02:26:56,597
No limits?

1125
02:27:13,705 --> 02:27:15,247
- Mark me first!
- And me!

1126
02:27:15,457 --> 02:27:16,951
- What odds?
- A moment, please...

1127
02:27:17,167 --> 02:27:20,203
...my lords, protectors
of the far flung marshes.

1128
02:27:20,462 --> 02:27:21,873
May I first sit down?

1129
02:27:22,089 --> 02:27:23,916
Sit. How much will you wager?

1130
02:27:24,133 --> 02:27:26,968
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.

1131
02:27:27,178 --> 02:27:29,087
A bench, quickly.

1132
02:27:30,139 --> 02:27:31,468
Thank you.

1133
02:27:34,852 --> 02:27:36,975
- Now.
- 1000 <i>denarii.</i>

1134
02:27:37,188 --> 02:27:39,679
- 2000!
- Mark me!

1135
02:27:39,899 --> 02:27:44,691
Your spirit does you credit, but do
not be impatient. There is time.

1136
02:27:45,113 --> 02:27:48,197
First gentlemen, the odds.

1137
02:27:48,699 --> 02:27:52,199
The tribune has won many times. The
odds should be in the same measure.

1138
02:27:53,287 --> 02:27:55,494
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?

1139
02:27:56,624 --> 02:27:57,904
Two to one.

1140
02:27:59,795 --> 02:28:03,875
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,
masters of the Earth...

1141
02:28:04,091 --> 02:28:07,709
...where is the courage
that made Rome master of the world?

1142
02:28:07,928 --> 02:28:10,633
I can get better odds
on any street market.

1143
02:28:11,473 --> 02:28:12,884
Three to one.

1144
02:28:13,392 --> 02:28:15,634
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

1145
02:28:15,894 --> 02:28:19,228
In four years, the tribune has won
four victories in the circus.

1146
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:21,681
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.

1147
02:28:22,776 --> 02:28:25,896
We know you have good horses,
but who is your driver?

1148
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:31,990
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.

1149
02:28:32,202 --> 02:28:34,195
The Prince of Hur.

1150
02:28:35,915 --> 02:28:38,453
Judah Ben-Hur.

1151
02:28:38,710 --> 02:28:40,334
Prince of Hur?

1152
02:28:41,296 --> 02:28:44,297
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.

1153
02:28:44,507 --> 02:28:46,714
Returned? Impossible.

1154
02:28:46,926 --> 02:28:50,426
The divine Tiberius is merciful
as always.

1155
02:28:53,141 --> 02:28:54,141
Well?

1156
02:28:54,434 --> 02:28:58,728
Will no one back the noble tribune
against a Jew, a galley slave?

1157
02:29:02,233 --> 02:29:04,559
Perhaps I made a mistake
in coming here.

1158
02:29:08,490 --> 02:29:09,984
You, tribune...

1159
02:29:10,283 --> 02:29:12,277
...will you give me four to one?

1160
02:29:16,582 --> 02:29:17,910
Four to one.

1161
02:29:18,167 --> 02:29:19,167
Good.

1162
02:29:19,877 --> 02:29:24,705
Four to one, sheik. The difference
between a Roman and a Jew.

1163
02:29:24,924 --> 02:29:26,501
Or an Arab.

1164
02:29:32,348 --> 02:29:34,008
Bravely spoken.

1165
02:29:36,102 --> 02:29:40,479
Now we will settle the amount
of our wager. I will venture...

1166
02:29:51,368 --> 02:29:53,277
A thousand talents?

1167
02:29:54,913 --> 02:29:58,993
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.

1168
02:30:04,798 --> 02:30:06,707
Of course, if it is too much...

1169
02:30:08,218 --> 02:30:10,294
A thousand talents it will be.

1170
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:11,919
Agreed.

1171
02:30:59,146 --> 02:31:01,719
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.

1172
02:31:13,368 --> 02:31:14,946
You're good fellows.

1173
02:31:15,287 --> 02:31:17,280
If only men were this good.

1174
02:31:19,666 --> 02:31:20,911
Remember, Altair...

1175
02:31:21,126 --> 02:31:23,796
...nine times around the circus.

1176
02:31:26,173 --> 02:31:27,418
Aldebaran.

1177
02:31:31,386 --> 02:31:33,509
Rigel, did you hear?

1178
02:31:33,722 --> 02:31:35,632
Nine lives to live.

1179
02:31:37,435 --> 02:31:39,428
My swift fellow.

1180
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:43,681
You must not win the race
the first time around.

1181
02:31:44,359 --> 02:31:46,731
You win the last time around.

1182
02:31:48,071 --> 02:31:52,234
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.

1183
02:31:55,370 --> 02:31:57,695
Steady Antares.

1184
02:31:57,956 --> 02:31:59,450
Like a rock.

1185
02:32:00,959 --> 02:32:02,786
You will be our anchor.

1186
02:32:10,343 --> 02:32:13,049
I thought they'd never love
another as they love me.

1187
02:32:13,264 --> 02:32:15,636
They have taken me into their family.

1188
02:32:16,642 --> 02:32:18,516
Rest well, my stars.

1189
02:32:18,769 --> 02:32:20,809
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

1190
02:32:21,689 --> 02:32:25,817
Then if you defeat Messala and
the new governor there to see it...

1191
02:32:26,068 --> 02:32:28,939
...the news will scorch the streets
of the Roman world.

1192
02:32:29,196 --> 02:32:30,239
Pontius Pilate here?

1193
02:32:30,448 --> 02:32:32,440
Yes, and ready to grind
his heel into us.

1194
02:32:32,658 --> 02:32:35,992
You will make him see
what men are born in this land.

1195
02:32:36,620 --> 02:32:39,989
I only know that
I race against Messala.

1196
02:32:56,266 --> 02:32:57,725
Look for the yoke.

1197
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:01,562
Ease that strap.

1198
02:33:42,605 --> 02:33:47,350
God forgive me for seeking vengeance,
but my path is set.

1199
02:33:47,568 --> 02:33:52,029
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.

1200
02:34:07,464 --> 02:34:09,256
The Star of David.

1201
02:34:09,466 --> 02:34:12,586
To shine out for your people
and my people together...

1202
02:34:12,803 --> 02:34:14,926
...and blind the eyes of Rome.

1203
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:18,392
They are ready.

1204
02:34:47,255 --> 02:34:49,248
Easy, girl, easy.

1205
02:35:28,881 --> 02:35:30,589
Number five.

1206
02:35:31,634 --> 02:35:33,792
Where is number five?

1207
02:36:04,584 --> 02:36:08,499
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.

1208
02:36:08,839 --> 02:36:12,172
Yes, this is the day.

1209
02:36:15,387 --> 02:36:18,423
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

1210
02:36:34,866 --> 02:36:38,448
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.

1211
02:36:50,089 --> 02:36:53,505
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

1212
02:40:33,777 --> 02:40:36,483
Watch your line! Keep your places!

1213
02:41:00,763 --> 02:41:03,433
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.

1214
02:41:24,997 --> 02:41:26,278
Citizens...

1215
02:41:27,208 --> 02:41:31,916
...I welcome you to these games
in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

1216
02:41:32,546 --> 02:41:35,168
We dedicate them to his glory...

1217
02:41:35,382 --> 02:41:37,920
...and to the glory of Rome...

1218
02:41:38,135 --> 02:41:40,805
...of which you are all part.

1219
02:41:44,099 --> 02:41:47,304
Let us honor those
who race for us today.

1220
02:41:47,813 --> 02:41:50,350
They come here from Alexandria...

1221
02:41:50,565 --> 02:41:51,763
...Messina...

1222
02:41:52,025 --> 02:41:53,353
...Carthage...

1223
02:41:53,568 --> 02:41:54,813
...Cyprus...

1224
02:41:55,028 --> 02:41:56,191
...Rome...

1225
02:41:56,530 --> 02:41:57,644
...Corinth...

1226
02:41:57,948 --> 02:41:59,276
...Athens...

1227
02:41:59,533 --> 02:42:00,731
...Phrygia...

1228
02:42:00,951 --> 02:42:02,694
...and Judea.

1229
02:42:10,877 --> 02:42:14,127
To the best of these,
a crown of victory.

1230
02:42:14,881 --> 02:42:17,004
The race begins.

1231
02:42:17,634 --> 02:42:19,876
Hail, Caesar!

1232
02:46:23,387 --> 02:46:25,463
Come, my children, come!

1233
02:46:42,490 --> 02:46:44,068
The Roman pig!

1234
02:53:16,520 --> 02:53:17,849
Salute.

1235
02:53:32,495 --> 02:53:34,238
A great victory.

1236
02:53:34,455 --> 02:53:37,076
You are the people's one true god...

1237
02:53:37,291 --> 02:53:38,916
...for the time being.

1238
02:53:39,502 --> 02:53:41,245
Permit us to worship.

1239
02:53:49,179 --> 02:53:51,670
I crown their god.

1240
02:54:11,618 --> 02:54:15,402
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.

1241
02:54:16,122 --> 02:54:20,334
A long life, young Arrius
and the good sense to live it.

1242
02:54:45,486 --> 02:54:47,728
We cannot wait, tribune.

1243
02:54:47,989 --> 02:54:50,277
He will come. He will...

1244
02:54:58,416 --> 02:55:00,493
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

1245
02:55:00,711 --> 02:55:02,454
He will come!

1246
02:55:06,008 --> 02:55:07,466
He will come.

1247
02:55:08,218 --> 02:55:11,670
I've sent for him, and he will come.

1248
02:55:12,055 --> 02:55:16,267
If you wish us to keep you alive,
we have to go to work now, tribune.

1249
02:55:17,019 --> 02:55:18,347
Do you understand?

1250
02:55:18,562 --> 02:55:20,685
To hack the legs off me?

1251
02:55:20,939 --> 02:55:24,640
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

1252
02:55:25,235 --> 02:55:27,691
I don't receive him with half a body.

1253
02:55:41,544 --> 02:55:42,544
No!

1254
02:55:50,470 --> 02:55:53,506
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

1255
02:55:53,890 --> 02:55:55,514
Here he is.

1256
02:56:31,137 --> 02:56:33,674
Triumph complete, Judah.

1257
02:56:34,431 --> 02:56:37,468
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

1258
02:56:42,606 --> 02:56:44,682
I see no enemy.

1259
02:56:46,318 --> 02:56:48,146
What do you think you see?

1260
02:56:48,363 --> 02:56:51,281
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

1261
02:56:53,952 --> 02:56:57,701
There's enough of a man
still left here for you to hate.

1262
02:57:02,919 --> 02:57:04,746
Let me help you.

1263
02:57:19,269 --> 02:57:22,555
You think they're dead,
your mother and sister.

1264
02:57:23,441 --> 02:57:26,193
Dead. And the race over.

1265
02:57:28,488 --> 02:57:30,813
It isn't over, Judah.

1266
02:57:31,699 --> 02:57:32,862
They're not dead.

1267
02:57:38,539 --> 02:57:40,366
Where are they?

1268
02:57:51,886 --> 02:57:53,380
Where are they?

1269
02:57:57,225 --> 02:57:58,802
Where are they?!

1270
02:58:02,606 --> 02:58:04,314
Look for them...

1271
02:58:04,608 --> 02:58:08,309
...in the Valley of the Lepers...

1272
02:58:10,322 --> 02:58:13,027
...if you can recognize them.

1273
02:58:28,215 --> 02:58:29,875
It goes on.

1274
02:58:31,301 --> 02:58:33,424
It goes on, Judah.

1275
02:58:35,598 --> 02:58:37,009
The race...

1276
02:58:39,394 --> 02:58:43,594
The race is not over.

1277
03:00:35,039 --> 03:00:36,913
Is there a way down here?

1278
03:00:37,250 --> 03:00:40,370
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.

1279
03:01:29,345 --> 03:01:30,345
Man.

1280
03:01:35,519 --> 03:01:39,351
I'm searching for two women,
a mother and daughter.

1281
03:01:42,984 --> 03:01:45,060
There are many women.

1282
03:01:46,696 --> 03:01:49,069
Of the family of Hur.

1283
03:01:50,992 --> 03:01:53,281
We have no names here.

1284
03:02:52,765 --> 03:02:53,807
For them?

1285
03:02:59,104 --> 03:03:02,022
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.

1286
03:03:02,232 --> 03:03:06,360
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?

1287
03:03:06,695 --> 03:03:08,403
Not to see them?

1288
03:03:08,697 --> 03:03:09,812
They are coming.

1289
03:03:10,032 --> 03:03:14,741
Love them in the way they must need
to be loved. Not to look at them.

1290
03:03:14,953 --> 03:03:17,658
Let them be as if you had
never come here. Please!

1291
03:04:32,032 --> 03:04:33,361
Is Judah well?

1292
03:04:34,702 --> 03:04:36,742
Is he happy?

1293
03:04:37,956 --> 03:04:40,957
Yes, he is well.

1294
03:04:44,212 --> 03:04:46,882
Your mind can be at rest for him.

1295
03:04:47,507 --> 03:04:49,167
He is well, Miriam.

1296
03:04:59,144 --> 03:05:00,638
God be with you.

1297
03:05:37,058 --> 03:05:38,469
They have gone.

1298
03:05:45,400 --> 03:05:46,943
We can go back.

1299
03:05:51,448 --> 03:05:54,153
Go back to what?

1300
03:05:56,578 --> 03:05:59,069
Judah, they have one blessing left.

1301
03:05:59,456 --> 03:06:02,706
To think you remember them
as they were...

1302
03:06:04,044 --> 03:06:06,037
...and live your own life.

1303
03:06:08,757 --> 03:06:10,501
Forget what is here.

1304
03:06:10,717 --> 03:06:11,916
Forget?

1305
03:06:14,888 --> 03:06:16,632
It's as though
they're alive in a grave.

1306
03:06:16,849 --> 03:06:19,553
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.

1307
03:06:19,768 --> 03:06:23,221
How could you have suffered them
to come here? I must see them.

1308
03:06:23,440 --> 03:06:25,977
No, Judah, please! Judah!

1309
03:06:30,321 --> 03:06:34,699
Think, Judah, think. It would
tear them apart if they see you.

1310
03:07:43,188 --> 03:07:47,102
He is here. I have found Him.
The child has become a man.

1311
03:07:47,359 --> 03:07:51,606
And the man, I know it now,
is the Son of God.

1312
03:07:55,784 --> 03:07:57,575
The promise is true.

1313
03:07:58,829 --> 03:08:02,613
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.

1314
03:08:02,833 --> 03:08:04,909
Life has been answered.

1315
03:08:05,168 --> 03:08:07,042
God has answered it.

1316
03:08:22,103 --> 03:08:24,095
Come. Come with me.

1317
03:08:27,442 --> 03:08:29,897
When the Romans were marching me
to the galleys...

1318
03:08:30,111 --> 03:08:32,187
...thirst had nearly killed me.

1319
03:08:32,405 --> 03:08:35,157
A man gave me water to drink.

1320
03:08:35,408 --> 03:08:37,116
I went on living.

1321
03:08:37,493 --> 03:08:40,862
I should have done better
if I had poured it into the sand.

1322
03:08:41,080 --> 03:08:42,080
No.

1323
03:08:42,915 --> 03:08:44,458
I am thirsty still.

1324
03:08:45,209 --> 03:08:47,037
Come and listen.

1325
03:08:49,047 --> 03:08:51,087
I have business with Rome.

1326
03:08:52,926 --> 03:08:54,966
You insist on death.

1327
03:09:00,184 --> 03:09:01,726
Goodbye, Judah.

1328
03:10:55,010 --> 03:10:56,052
You sent for me?

1329
03:10:56,178 --> 03:10:59,179
I hope I bring you
a good conclusion to your victory.

1330
03:10:59,389 --> 03:11:02,556
I have a message for you
from the consul, your father.

1331
03:11:04,644 --> 03:11:07,729
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.

1332
03:11:07,939 --> 03:11:10,228
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

1333
03:11:14,113 --> 03:11:16,236
Do you say nothing to this?

1334
03:11:19,035 --> 03:11:22,368
I have just come
from the Valley of Stone...

1335
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:26,447
...where my mother and sister live
what's left of their lives.

1336
03:11:26,667 --> 03:11:31,543
By Rome's will,
lepers, outcasts without hope.

1337
03:11:31,798 --> 03:11:36,127
I have heard this. There was great
blame there, very deeply regretted.

1338
03:11:36,385 --> 03:11:41,047
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.

1339
03:11:41,265 --> 03:11:43,887
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.

1340
03:11:44,102 --> 03:11:47,554
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.

1341
03:11:47,773 --> 03:11:50,643
Before the cruelty of Rome
spread in his blood.

1342
03:11:50,859 --> 03:11:55,272
Rome destroyed Messala as surely
as Rome has destroyed my family.

1343
03:11:55,489 --> 03:11:59,736
Where there is greatness,
great government or power...

1344
03:11:59,952 --> 03:12:02,240
...even great feeling or compassion...

1345
03:12:02,496 --> 03:12:04,952
...error also is great.

1346
03:12:05,165 --> 03:12:07,241
We progress and mature by fault.

1347
03:12:07,459 --> 03:12:11,124
Rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future.

1348
03:12:11,422 --> 03:12:12,880
There are other voices.

1349
03:12:13,090 --> 03:12:16,589
The voice, for instance, of Arrius
waiting for you in Rome.

1350
03:12:16,802 --> 03:12:19,293
He would tell you,
if I may speak in his place...

1351
03:12:19,805 --> 03:12:22,973
...not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment...

1352
03:12:23,184 --> 03:12:25,307
...or impossible loyalties.

1353
03:12:25,520 --> 03:12:27,845
Perfect freedom has no existence.

1354
03:12:28,064 --> 03:12:30,982
A grown man knows the world
he lives in.

1355
03:12:31,192 --> 03:12:34,644
And for the present, the world is Rome.

1356
03:12:35,697 --> 03:12:38,069
Young Arrius, I am sure,
will choose it.

1357
03:12:40,160 --> 03:12:42,069
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

1358
03:12:54,215 --> 03:12:56,789
I cross this floor
in spoken friendship...

1359
03:12:57,010 --> 03:12:59,217
...as I would speak to Arrius.

1360
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:03,345
But when I go up those stairs,
I become the hand of Caesar...

1361
03:13:03,559 --> 03:13:06,097
...ready to crush those
who challenge his authority.

1362
03:13:06,896 --> 03:13:09,054
There are too many men
of envy and ambition...

1363
03:13:09,315 --> 03:13:11,473
...who try to disrupt
the government of Rome.

1364
03:13:11,692 --> 03:13:14,266
You have become the victor
and hero to those people.

1365
03:13:14,862 --> 03:13:18,990
They look to you,
their one true god, as I call you.

1366
03:13:19,450 --> 03:13:23,400
If you stay here, you will find
yourself part of this tragedy.

1367
03:13:24,371 --> 03:13:27,408
I am already part of this tragedy.

1368
03:13:33,839 --> 03:13:35,916
Return this to Arrius.

1369
03:13:37,469 --> 03:13:40,007
I honor him too well
to wear it any longer.

1370
03:13:49,731 --> 03:13:51,938
Even for Arrius' sake,
I cannot protect you...

1371
03:13:52,150 --> 03:13:54,820
...from personal disaster
if you stay here.

1372
03:13:55,654 --> 03:13:57,693
You are too great a danger.

1373
03:14:13,506 --> 03:14:15,333
Leave Judea.

1374
03:14:17,176 --> 03:14:19,050
You have my word.

1375
03:14:53,297 --> 03:14:55,704
I was afraid
you would never come back...

1376
03:14:55,924 --> 03:14:58,213
...afraid of what would happen to you.

1377
03:15:00,012 --> 03:15:02,004
But I see you again.

1378
03:15:04,475 --> 03:15:07,013
Your father's waiting for me.

1379
03:15:11,356 --> 03:15:12,555
Where is he?

1380
03:15:15,402 --> 03:15:16,683
What do you mean to do?

1381
03:15:27,957 --> 03:15:30,164
Rest, sleep.

1382
03:15:30,376 --> 03:15:33,662
For a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace.

1383
03:15:33,880 --> 03:15:35,080
Peace?

1384
03:15:35,423 --> 03:15:37,380
Love and peace.

1385
03:15:37,592 --> 03:15:40,593
Do you think I don't long for them
as much as you do?

1386
03:15:40,929 --> 03:15:42,043
Where do you see them?

1387
03:15:43,598 --> 03:15:45,638
If you had heard this man
from Nazareth.

1388
03:15:45,850 --> 03:15:47,131
Balthasar's word.

1389
03:15:49,020 --> 03:15:51,594
He is more than Balthasar's word.

1390
03:15:52,148 --> 03:15:56,146
His voiced traveled
with such a still purpose.

1391
03:15:56,528 --> 03:15:58,604
It was more than a voice.

1392
03:15:59,532 --> 03:16:01,738
A man more than a man.

1393
03:16:05,454 --> 03:16:09,452
He said, " Blessed are the merciful...

1394
03:16:09,667 --> 03:16:11,956
...for they shall obtain mercy.

1395
03:16:12,837 --> 03:16:15,125
Blessed are the peacemakers...

1396
03:16:15,339 --> 03:16:18,459
...for they shall be called
the children of God."

1397
03:16:19,051 --> 03:16:20,296
Children of God?

1398
03:16:21,345 --> 03:16:24,180
In that dead valley
where we left them?

1399
03:16:24,390 --> 03:16:28,174
I tell you every man of Judea is
unclean and will stay unclean...

1400
03:16:28,436 --> 03:16:31,602
...until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth...

1401
03:16:31,814 --> 03:16:34,020
...of being at the mercy of tyranny.

1402
03:16:34,483 --> 03:16:38,067
No other life is possible
except to wash this land clean.

1403
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:40,023
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!

1404
03:16:42,242 --> 03:16:44,069
I know there is a law in life.

1405
03:16:44,286 --> 03:16:48,235
That blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog.

1406
03:16:48,498 --> 03:16:50,574
Death generates death...

1407
03:16:50,792 --> 03:16:53,414
...as the vulture breeds the vulture.

1408
03:16:54,171 --> 03:16:56,744
But the voice I heard today
on the hill said:

1409
03:16:56,965 --> 03:16:58,673
"Love your enemy.

1410
03:16:59,009 --> 03:17:02,175
Do good to those who
despitefully use you."

1411
03:17:02,888 --> 03:17:06,387
All who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done.

1412
03:17:06,600 --> 03:17:08,888
As you make us do now.

1413
03:17:12,565 --> 03:17:14,937
Are we to bear nothing together?

1414
03:17:16,736 --> 03:17:18,064
Even love?

1415
03:17:21,783 --> 03:17:24,356
I can hardly draw breath...

1416
03:17:24,786 --> 03:17:27,027
...without feeling you in my heart.

1417
03:17:28,331 --> 03:17:29,790
But I know...

1418
03:17:31,501 --> 03:17:33,956
...that everything I do
from this moment...

1419
03:17:34,170 --> 03:17:37,337
...bears greater pain
than you have ever suffered.

1420
03:17:38,716 --> 03:17:40,875
It is better not to love me.

1421
03:17:42,470 --> 03:17:47,014
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?

1422
03:17:47,476 --> 03:17:50,430
You seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy...

1423
03:17:50,646 --> 03:17:55,106
...giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.

1424
03:17:55,317 --> 03:17:57,226
It's as though
you had become Messala.

1425
03:18:05,953 --> 03:18:08,029
I've lost you, Judah.

1426
03:19:10,644 --> 03:19:12,388
No further.

1427
03:19:13,355 --> 03:19:14,684
What are you doing here?

1428
03:19:15,441 --> 03:19:17,979
I was here last evening
waiting for you.

1429
03:19:18,194 --> 03:19:20,649
I have waited all night.
What has happened?

1430
03:19:21,572 --> 03:19:23,031
Where is Tirzah?

1431
03:19:26,243 --> 03:19:28,035
Leave the food.

1432
03:19:29,163 --> 03:19:31,915
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

1433
03:19:32,124 --> 03:19:34,496
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.

1434
03:19:34,920 --> 03:19:37,541
I've heard Him again,
the man from Nazareth.

1435
03:19:37,756 --> 03:19:42,133
If ever words were from God,
they are in everything He says.

1436
03:19:42,385 --> 03:19:45,470
I cannot bear that
you should have never known...

1437
03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:49,512
...this hand of quiet
reaching towards us.

1438
03:19:49,935 --> 03:19:52,971
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.

1439
03:19:53,188 --> 03:19:55,596
Bring Tirzah
and we can go together to find Him.

1440
03:19:58,527 --> 03:20:00,733
Tirzah is dying.

1441
03:20:07,160 --> 03:20:09,698
Leave the food and go.

1442
03:20:11,916 --> 03:20:13,576
It's Judah.

1443
03:20:17,797 --> 03:20:19,920
Why did you tell him?

1444
03:20:20,716 --> 03:20:22,626
Yes, Judah, yes.

1445
03:20:23,261 --> 03:20:26,464
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

1446
03:20:26,681 --> 03:20:27,723
Mother.

1447
03:20:30,643 --> 03:20:33,597
Wait, Mother, wait.

1448
03:20:33,813 --> 03:20:34,928
Let me talk with you.

1449
03:20:35,148 --> 03:20:36,548
Please.

1450
03:20:36,774 --> 03:20:39,348
No, no further. Please.

1451
03:20:39,569 --> 03:20:43,269
No, Judah. Son, no.

1452
03:20:44,031 --> 03:20:47,033
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

1453
03:20:47,244 --> 03:20:48,287
Tirzah is dying.

1454
03:20:58,922 --> 03:21:02,126
Judah, if they would see Jesus
of Nazareth they will know...

1455
03:21:02,342 --> 03:21:04,335
...that life is everlasting...

1456
03:21:04,553 --> 03:21:08,218
...and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith.

1457
03:21:10,851 --> 03:21:12,511
I will take them to Him.

1458
03:21:14,605 --> 03:21:15,605
No!

1459
03:21:16,565 --> 03:21:18,107
God, no!

1460
03:21:31,873 --> 03:21:34,790
No, no, dear son.

1461
03:21:35,835 --> 03:21:37,033
Mother...

1462
03:21:39,798 --> 03:21:41,340
...where is Tirzah?

1463
03:21:44,552 --> 03:21:45,595
Judah, no.

1464
03:21:47,180 --> 03:21:48,971
Judah, no.

1465
03:21:57,732 --> 03:22:00,604
You must not go to her, dear son.

1466
03:22:01,946 --> 03:22:03,274
Please.

1467
03:22:03,864 --> 03:22:05,406
Dear son.

1468
03:22:56,668 --> 03:22:58,328
I am afraid.

1469
03:22:59,296 --> 03:23:00,920
No cause.

1470
03:23:02,382 --> 03:23:04,790
The world is more than we know.

1471
03:23:41,005 --> 03:23:44,208
Tirzah, it's Judah.

1472
03:23:46,762 --> 03:23:48,589
No, Judah.

1473
03:24:32,267 --> 03:24:34,888
Alms for the blind?

1474
03:24:35,937 --> 03:24:38,606
Alms for the blind?

1475
03:24:41,734 --> 03:24:44,404
Alms for the blind?

1476
03:24:46,239 --> 03:24:50,533
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.

1477
03:24:50,743 --> 03:24:53,151
Trial? Whose trial?

1478
03:24:53,371 --> 03:24:56,657
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.

1479
03:24:56,875 --> 03:24:58,999
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?

1480
03:25:00,463 --> 03:25:01,791
What has he done?

1481
03:25:02,006 --> 03:25:05,754
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.

1482
03:25:05,968 --> 03:25:07,877
Help for the blind.

1483
03:25:08,095 --> 03:25:10,254
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!

1484
03:25:11,640 --> 03:25:14,310
Get away! Stay away!

1485
03:25:15,644 --> 03:25:16,925
Go away!

1486
03:27:36,372 --> 03:27:38,495
Lepers! Lepers!

1487
03:28:00,064 --> 03:28:02,270
How can this be?

1488
03:28:11,367 --> 03:28:13,692
I know this man.

1489
03:28:27,842 --> 03:28:29,715
Will someone help Him?

1490
03:28:37,227 --> 03:28:38,507
Take pity on Him.

1491
03:28:45,944 --> 03:28:47,771
Have mercy.

1492
03:29:09,926 --> 03:29:11,837
In His pain...

1493
03:29:12,513 --> 03:29:14,885
...this look of peace.

1494
03:29:16,976 --> 03:29:18,850
Watch over them, Esther.

1495
03:29:56,892 --> 03:29:58,172
We must go back.

1496
03:29:58,393 --> 03:30:00,766
I brought you here to this...

1497
03:30:01,480 --> 03:30:03,188
...when I hoped...

1498
03:30:06,110 --> 03:30:08,482
You haven't failed, Esther.

1499
03:30:27,048 --> 03:30:29,622
Hail King of the Jews!

1500
03:33:07,671 --> 03:33:11,206
This is where your search
has brought you, Balthasar.

1501
03:33:18,015 --> 03:33:19,806
He gave me water...

1502
03:33:20,601 --> 03:33:22,594
...and a heart to live.

1503
03:33:25,565 --> 03:33:27,439
What has He done to merit this?

1504
03:33:29,652 --> 03:33:33,401
He has taken the world
of our sins onto Himself.

1505
03:33:34,657 --> 03:33:37,528
To this end He said He was born...

1506
03:33:38,787 --> 03:33:40,696
...in that stable...

1507
03:33:41,414 --> 03:33:43,537
...where I first saw Him.

1508
03:33:47,170 --> 03:33:50,503
For this cause,
He came into the world.

1509
03:33:57,263 --> 03:33:59,008
For this death?

1510
03:34:01,811 --> 03:34:03,305
This beginning.

1511
03:34:35,846 --> 03:34:37,922
I have lived too long.

1512
03:35:09,045 --> 03:35:12,131
As though He were carrying
in that cross...

1513
03:35:12,341 --> 03:35:14,548
...the pain of the world.

1514
03:35:16,012 --> 03:35:20,555
So fearful, and yet why is it...

1515
03:35:20,766 --> 03:35:23,055
...I'm not afraid anymore?

1516
03:35:32,320 --> 03:35:34,645
The shadow of a storm.

1517
03:36:00,265 --> 03:36:02,507
A strange darkness...

1518
03:36:02,726 --> 03:36:04,683
...but still day.

1519
03:36:13,654 --> 03:36:15,860
His life is over.

1520
03:36:37,137 --> 03:36:38,417
What is it?

1521
03:36:47,522 --> 03:36:49,146
This tearing.

1522
03:36:50,066 --> 03:36:51,940
I am in pain.

1523
03:36:52,902 --> 03:36:54,942
I feel it too.

1524
03:37:39,826 --> 03:37:41,618
Do you see your hand?

1525
03:40:20,074 --> 03:40:22,529
Almost at the moment He died...

1526
03:40:24,036 --> 03:40:27,535
...I heard Him say,
"Father, forgive them...

1527
03:40:27,748 --> 03:40:30,073
...for they know not what they do."

1528
03:40:32,294 --> 03:40:33,837
Even then.

1529
03:40:34,088 --> 03:40:35,548
Even then.

1530
03:40:41,221 --> 03:40:45,717
And I felt His voice take
the sword out of my hand.

1531
03:42:22,450 --> 03:42:24,536
