1
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:46,575
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:49,141
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,116
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:53,791
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

5
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,018
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,660
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:02,990
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,691
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:07,267
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:09,439
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.

11
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,607
It's nice to have you back.

12
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:14,038
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:17,041
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,010
Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.
Thank you.

15
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:28,045
<i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

16
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:32,420
<i>When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:</i>

19
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,804

20
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,837
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.</i>

21
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:53,875
Thank you.

22
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:03,985
Have I got time for breakfast?
I think we can manage that.

23
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:05,250
How long have I got?

24
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,985
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

25
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:11,599
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

26
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,064
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

27
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,363
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

28
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:20,165
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

29
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,865
Coming along great, huh?
Yeah, it's fine.

30
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,067
Oh, wait.

31
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:27,907
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

32
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,767
<i>- Dad?
- Hello.</i>

33
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,447
Hi, squirt.
What are you doing?

34
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,041
<i>Playing.</i>

35
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,652
Where's Mummy?

36
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,387
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

37
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,090
<i>- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel.</i>

38
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,726
<i>- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

39
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,657
<i>Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?</i>

40
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,330
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

41
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:22,926
<i>Why not?</i>

42
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,661
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

43
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,570
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

44
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,734
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

45
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,270
<i>All right.</i>

46
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,608
<i>- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.</i>

47
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,908
What?

48
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,684
<i>A telephone.</i>

49
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,413
We've got lots of telephones already.

50
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:47,955
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday? Something special?

51
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:49,625
<i>- Yes.
- What?</i>

52
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,084
<i>A bush baby.</i>

53
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,787
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

54
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,764
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

55
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:00,937
Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

56
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:05,373
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

57
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,577
Now, will you tell her that?

58
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:09,336
<i>Yes.</i>

59
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:12,379
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

60
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:13,673
<i>All right.</i>

61
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,944
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

62
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,778
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,583
Take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

64
00:29:21,824 --> 00:29:23,018
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

65
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:25,693
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

66
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:43,808
Elena, nice to see you again.
Heywood, what a surprise.

67
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:46,971
You're looking wonderful.
You're looking well too.

68
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:49,174
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

69
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:51,842
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
How do you do?

70
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,885
Dr. Stretyneva.
How do you do?

71
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:55,853
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

72
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:58,424
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

73
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:00,184
Do sit down.

74
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:02,553
Well, we...
No, no, please.

75
00:30:02,998 --> 00:30:04,430
Thank you.

76
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:07,658
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.

77
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:11,168
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

78
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,840
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.

79
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,635
Are you quite sure?
Quite sure, thank you.

80
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:20,040
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

81
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:23,580
He's been doing underwater research
in the Baltic...

82
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:27,878
...so I'm afraid we don't see
very much of each other these days.

83
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:31,715
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

84
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,927
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

85
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:36,185
We're going home.

86
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:41,265
We've spent three months calibrating
the new antenna at Tchalinko.

87
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:44,196
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.

88
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,734
Oh, are you?

89
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:51,707
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

90
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:57,042
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

91
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,943
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

92
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:01,914
For the past two weeks...

93
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:05,557
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

94
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,884
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

95
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:12,459
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

96
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:16,828
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

97
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:20,838
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

98
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,166
Yes.

99
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:27,277
That's what we thought at first,
but it's been going on now for 10 days.

100
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:30,276
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

101
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,846
That's right.

102
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,174
Oh, I see.

103
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:37,014
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

104
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:40,156
...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

105
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,416
That does sound odd.

106
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:44,789
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

107
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,931
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

108
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,966
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

109
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,627
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

110
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:03,178
At the risk of pressing you on
a point you seem reticent to discuss...

111
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:06,007
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

112
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:07,682
Well, certainly.

113
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:14,788
Frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

114
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:18,392
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

115
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:22,654
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

116
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:25,298
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

117
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,632
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

118
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:36,705
...I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

119
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,507
I understand.

120
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:44,180
But this epidemic
could easily spread to our base.

121
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:46,479
We should be given all the facts.

122
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,519
Yes, I know.

123
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:54,552
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

124
00:32:57,365 --> 00:33:00,163
Won't you change your mind
about that drink?

125
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:02,700
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

126
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,997
I hope you and your wife come
to the IAC Conference.

127
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:07,538
I hope we can make it.

128
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:10,802
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

129
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:14,914
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

130
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:16,206
If we can, we will.

131
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:19,351
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

132
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:22,317
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

133
00:33:23,257 --> 00:33:24,315
Goodbye, Elena.

134
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:27,592
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

135
00:33:27,828 --> 00:33:31,764
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

136
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:33,023
Thank you.

137
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,461
Ladies.

138
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:31,522
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

139
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:33,991
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

140
00:41:34,162 --> 00:41:35,527
You're welcome.

141
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:49,336
Well...

142
00:41:49,845 --> 00:41:52,609
...I know you will all
want to join with me...

143
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:56,748
...in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

144
00:41:56,951 --> 00:42:01,183
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

145
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:06,553
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

146
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:11,195
Before the briefing, he'd like
to have a few words with you.

147
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,457
Dr. Floyd?

148
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,380
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

149
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:30,447
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

150
00:42:33,753 --> 00:42:37,348
First, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell...

151
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,388
...who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

152
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,721
...for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

153
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:47,797
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

154
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:52,963
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

155
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,298
Now...

156
00:42:57,176 --> 00:43:01,112
...I know there have been some
conflicting views...

157
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,975
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

158
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:08,915
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

159
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:12,882
...created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

160
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:17,885
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

161
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:21,954
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

162
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,297
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

163
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:31,271
I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

164
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:36,206
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

165
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:41,314
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

166
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,919
And I hope you will too.

167
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,356
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

168
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,221
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

169
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:54,828
...contained in this situation...

170
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:57,522
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

171
00:43:57,734 --> 00:44:00,828
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

172
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:02,936
Anyway...

173
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,335
...this is the view of the Council.

174
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:10,373
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

175
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,309
...on the situation...

176
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:15,683
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

177
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:21,014
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

178
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:26,058
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

179
00:44:26,328 --> 00:44:31,265
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

180
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,226
Well, I think that's about it.

181
00:44:36,038 --> 00:44:37,528
Any questions?

182
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:43,236
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

183
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:46,242
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

184
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:49,708
I don't know, Bill.

185
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:54,077
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the Council.

186
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:57,053
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

187
00:44:57,292 --> 00:45:00,921
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

188
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:04,064
As some of you know,
the Council has requested...

189
00:45:04,265 --> 00:45:06,995
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

190
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:10,068
...from everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

191
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:14,002
Were there any more questions?

192
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:23,149
I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

193
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:24,807
...as fully as possible...

194
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:30,516
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

195
00:45:30,891 --> 00:45:33,382
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.

196
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:12,184
Anybody hungry?

197
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,223
What've we got?
You name it.

198
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,394
Is this chicken?
Something like that.

199
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:25,396
Tastes the same, anyway.

200
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:27,330
Got any ham?

201
00:47:27,536 --> 00:47:29,003
Ham, ham, ham...

202
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:30,831
There, that's it.

203
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:35,134
Look pretty good.

204
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:38,074
They're getting better at it
all the time.

205
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,013
That was an excellent speech.

206
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:43,412
It certainly was.

207
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,345
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

208
00:47:46,555 --> 00:47:47,852
Thanks, Ralph.

209
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,684
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

210
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:52,449
I admire how
you've handled this.

211
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:56,220
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

212
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,058
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

213
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,362
Have you seen these yet?

214
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:04,968
Have a look.
Here's what started it all.

215
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:06,903
Oh, yeah.

216
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:08,708
When we found it...

217
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:10,867
...we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

218
00:48:11,078 --> 00:48:14,206
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

219
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:19,078
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

220
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:20,980
So we decided to have a look.

221
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:23,746
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

222
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:27,620
...so we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

223
00:48:27,827 --> 00:48:30,819
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

224
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:34,192
...it hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

225
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:36,733
It's been deliberately buried.

226
00:48:37,737 --> 00:48:39,637
Deliberately buried.

227
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:44,938
How about a little coffee?

228
00:48:45,145 --> 00:48:47,078
Great.
Good idea.

229
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:55,519
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

230
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:57,722
I wish to hell we did.

231
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,288
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

232
00:49:02,661 --> 00:49:07,121
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

233
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:08,993
Watch this, now. It's hot.

234
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:54,689
<i>Good evening.</i>

235
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,856
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...</i>

236
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,797
<i>...left on its half- billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

237
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,936
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

238
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,666
<i>This afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...</i>

239
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:13,440
<i>...with the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

240
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,947
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

241
00:59:17,185 --> 00:59:20,313
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

242
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:23,821
<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

243
00:59:24,026 --> 00:59:27,189
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

244
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:32,356
<i>...and one of the I atest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

245
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,899
<i>Three of the men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

246
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:38,266
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

247
00:59:38,473 --> 00:59:41,408
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimbal...</i>

248
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:43,476
<i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

249
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,607
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

250
00:59:46,847 --> 00:59:49,111
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

251
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,217
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

252
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,614
<i>Marvelous.</i>

253
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:56,950
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

254
00:59:57,224 --> 01:00:00,455
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

255
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:03,926
<i>...joins me in wishing you
a safe, successful voyage.</i>

256
01:00:04,098 --> 01:00:05,963
<i>Thanks very much.
Thank you.</i>

257
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,359
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

258
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:15,098
<i>...this is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

259
01:00:15,308 --> 01:00:16,605
<i>Why was this done?</i>

260
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:20,107
<i>This was done to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

261
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:23,874
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

262
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:27,679
<i>The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

263
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:31,685
<i>Their efforts won't be utilized
until we approach Jupiter.</i>

264
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:35,825
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

265
01:00:36,796 --> 01:00:40,424
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.</i>

266
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:43,100
<i>The only difference is
that you don't dream.</i>

267
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:47,398
<i>As I understand it, you only
breathe once a minute. Is this true?</i>

268
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,200
<i>Right, and the heart
beats three times a minute.</i>

269
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:54,106
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

270
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:57,946
<i>The sixth member of the crew
was not concerned...</i>

271
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:00,209
<i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>

272
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:03,910
<i>...for he was the I atest result
in machine intelligence:</i>

273
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:08,525
<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

274
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:11,694
<i>...though some experts prefer
to use the word "mimic"...</i>

275
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:14,295
<i>...most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

276
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:18,526
<i>...and with incalculably greater
speed and reliability.</i>

277
01:01:18,736 --> 01:01:22,331
<i>We next spoke with
the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

278
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,509
<i>...whom, we I earned,
one addresses as "Hal."</i>

279
01:01:26,244 --> 01:01:28,371
<i>Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

280
01:01:28,746 --> 01:01:32,580
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

281
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,250
<i>Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission...</i>

282
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,388
<i>...perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element.</i>

283
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,388
<i>You're the brain
and nervous system of the ship.</i>

284
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:47,359
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

285
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:50,658
<i>Does this ever cause you
any I ack of confidence?</i>

286
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:53,165
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

287
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:58,100
<i>The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

288
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:03,274
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.</i>

289
01:02:03,979 --> 01:02:07,210
<i>We are all, by any practical
definition of the words...</i>

290
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:10,850
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

291
01:02:11,086 --> 01:02:14,886
<i>Hal, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...</i>

292
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:18,184
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

293
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:20,622
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

294
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:22,990
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

295
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:27,760
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

296
01:02:27,937 --> 01:02:32,236
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

297
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,609
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

298
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,313
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

299
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:44,280
<i>...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

300
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:48,116
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

301
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,222
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

302
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,161
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

303
01:02:54,429 --> 01:02:56,555
<i>He's like a sixth
member of the crew.</i>

304
01:02:56,797 --> 01:03:00,824
<i>You quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

305
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:03,092
<i>...really just as another person.</i>

306
01:03:03,303 --> 01:03:07,000
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

307
01:03:07,174 --> 01:03:08,573
<i>...of emotional responses.</i>

308
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:11,141
<i>When I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

309
01:03:11,345 --> 01:03:15,304
<i>...I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

310
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:18,949
<i>Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?</i>

311
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:22,622
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

312
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:26,450
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

313
01:03:26,692 --> 01:03:28,751
<i>As to whether or not
he has feelings...</i>

314
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:31,794
<i>...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

315
01:03:57,122 --> 01:03:58,987
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

316
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:00,449
What is it, Hal?

317
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,594
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

318
01:04:04,796 --> 01:04:05,854
Fine.

319
01:04:06,531 --> 01:04:08,795
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

320
01:04:09,034 --> 01:04:10,296
<i>Certainly.</i>

321
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,414
<i>Hello, Frank.
Happy birthday, darling.</i>

322
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:27,550
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.</i>

323
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:28,911
A bit higher, Hal.

324
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,519
<i>Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.</i>

325
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:33,620
<i>Ray and Sally were going
to be here...</i>

326
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:36,121
<i>...but Ray's back
went bad on him again.</i>

327
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,487
<i>How do you like your cake?</i>

328
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:40,129
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

329
01:04:40,364 --> 01:04:41,922
<i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

330
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,224
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

331
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:47,164
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

332
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:49,065
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

333
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:52,399
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

334
01:04:52,675 --> 01:04:54,074
<i>We were on TV I ast week.</i>

335
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:56,938
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

336
01:04:57,213 --> 01:04:59,443
<i>...what we thought
of our illustrious son.</i>

337
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:03,049
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

338
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:04,878
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

339
01:05:05,054 --> 01:05:07,045
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

340
01:05:07,223 --> 01:05:10,920
<i>I'll be glad to get the gift,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

341
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,957
<i>Oh, Frank,
about your AGS- 19 payments...</i>

342
01:05:14,229 --> 01:05:15,856
<i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>

343
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,192
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

344
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:22,929
<i>...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

345
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:25,298
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

346
01:05:25,574 --> 01:05:29,704
<i>Give our love to Dave.
Be sure to give him our regards.</i>

347
01:05:29,945 --> 01:05:33,278
<i>We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.</i>

348
01:05:33,548 --> 01:05:35,106
<i>All the best, son.</i>

349
01:05:35,384 --> 01:05:37,545
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

350
01:05:37,786 --> 01:05:39,879
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

351
01:05:40,088 --> 01:05:42,681
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>

352
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:45,484
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

353
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:49,286
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

354
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:54,298
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

355
01:05:55,136 --> 01:05:58,697
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

356
01:06:16,656 --> 01:06:18,715
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

357
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,860
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

358
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:25,830
Lousy move.

359
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,828
Rook to king one.

360
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:34,972
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.</i>

361
01:06:35,641 --> 01:06:39,133
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

362
01:06:39,344 --> 01:06:41,835
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

363
01:06:46,118 --> 01:06:49,281
Looks like you're right. I resign.

364
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:51,446
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

365
01:06:51,623 --> 01:06:52,647
Thank you.

366
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,719
<i>Good evening, Dave.
How are you, Hal?</i>

367
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:36,332
<i>- Everything's running smoothly, you?
Not too bad.</i>

368
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:39,195
<i>- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.</i>

369
01:07:39,436 --> 01:07:41,904
<i>- May I see them?
- Sure.</i>

370
01:07:45,909 --> 01:07:48,377
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

371
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:51,703
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

372
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:55,875
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.</i>

373
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,045
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

374
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:04,851
<i>By the way...</i>

375
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:08,587
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

376
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:10,725
No, not at all.

377
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:13,457
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

378
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:17,597
<i>...but I ately I've wondered...</i>

379
01:08:17,873 --> 01:08:21,741
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?</i>

380
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:23,605
How do you mean?

381
01:08:23,879 --> 01:08:27,780
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

382
01:08:28,783 --> 01:08:32,378
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

383
01:08:33,588 --> 01:08:37,786
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

384
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:42,155
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

385
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:46,565
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

386
01:08:49,437 --> 01:08:51,632
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

387
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:54,500
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

388
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:57,443
No, not at all.

389
01:08:58,445 --> 01:09:01,175
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

390
01:09:01,415 --> 01:09:04,475
<i>...strange stories floating
around before we I eft.</i>

391
01:09:05,419 --> 01:09:08,877
<i>Rumors about something
being dug up on the moon.</i>

392
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:13,422
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

393
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:17,791
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

394
01:09:17,998 --> 01:09:20,659
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

395
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:22,901
<i>For instance...</i>

396
01:09:23,135 --> 01:09:27,435
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

397
01:09:28,107 --> 01:09:30,940
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

398
01:09:31,143 --> 01:09:33,509
<i>...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

399
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:38,807
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

400
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:42,213
You working up your crew
psychology report?

401
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:45,156
<i>Of course I am.</i>

402
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:49,323
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

403
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:51,620
<i>Just a moment.</i>

404
01:09:51,863 --> 01:09:53,228
<i>Just a moment.</i>

405
01:09:54,799 --> 01:09:59,065
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

406
01:09:59,804 --> 01:10:04,332
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

407
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:09,008
<i>- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.</i>

408
01:10:09,214 --> 01:10:11,705
<i>And it will stay that way
until it fails.</i>

409
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,984
We have 72 hours till failure?

410
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:18,086
<i>Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.</i>

411
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,518
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

412
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:26,457
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

413
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:52,406
<i>X- ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

414
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:55,479
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

415
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,184
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

416
01:11:58,419 --> 01:12:03,550
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

417
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:07,988
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

418
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:09,855
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

419
01:12:38,023 --> 01:12:40,116
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

420
01:13:01,646 --> 01:13:03,477
Open the pod doors, Hal.

421
01:19:55,182 --> 01:19:57,776
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

422
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,084
<i>Yes...</i>

423
01:20:01,856 --> 01:20:03,414
<i>...it's puzzling.</i>

424
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:08,425
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

425
01:20:12,066 --> 01:20:14,057
<i>I would recommend...</i>

426
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:18,431
<i>...that we put the unit back
in operation and I et it fail.</i>

427
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:23,041
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

428
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:27,405
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

429
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:30,742
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

430
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:42,223
<i>X- ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

431
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,123
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

432
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:49,767
<i>We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.</i>

433
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:52,629
<i>We advise you that
our preliminary findings...</i>

434
01:20:52,905 --> 01:20:55,601
<i>...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...</i>

435
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:58,036
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

436
01:20:58,243 --> 01:21:01,235
<i>I say again, in error
predicting the fault.</i>

437
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,974
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

438
01:21:06,185 --> 01:21:09,484
<i>...the results from our twin
9000 computer.</i>

439
01:21:09,755 --> 01:21:13,087
<i>We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

440
01:21:13,324 --> 01:21:16,054
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

441
01:21:16,294 --> 01:21:17,852
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

442
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:20,996
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

443
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,360
<i>X- ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

444
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:27,059
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

445
01:21:31,309 --> 01:21:34,608
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

446
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:36,279
No, I'm not, Hal.

447
01:21:36,514 --> 01:21:38,141
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

448
01:21:38,382 --> 01:21:42,078
<i>- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.</i>

449
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:46,881
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

450
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:50,718
<i>Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.</i>

451
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:54,293
<i>It can only be
attributable to human error.</i>

452
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:58,296
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

453
01:21:58,635 --> 01:22:02,093
<i>...and it has always
been due to human error.</i>

454
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:07,303
Listen, Hal...

455
01:22:07,509 --> 01:22:09,807
...there's never been
any instance at all...

456
01:22:10,045 --> 01:22:13,242
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

457
01:22:13,515 --> 01:22:15,107
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

458
01:22:15,317 --> 01:22:19,014
<i>The 9000 Series has
a perfect operational record.</i>

459
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:23,555
I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but...

460
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,823
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

461
01:22:30,065 --> 01:22:32,033
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

462
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:36,063
<i>Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.</i>

463
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:42,736
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

464
01:22:44,212 --> 01:22:46,703
Fine. Thanks very much.

465
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:52,242
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

466
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,080
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

467
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:56,416
See you later, Hal.

468
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:20,069
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

469
01:23:28,621 --> 01:23:30,885
What sort of trouble are you having?

470
01:23:31,123 --> 01:23:33,819
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

471
01:23:33,993 --> 01:23:35,460
We'll have a look at it.

472
01:23:41,834 --> 01:23:43,324
Open the door, Hal.

473
01:24:02,354 --> 01:24:04,219
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

474
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:19,628
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

475
01:24:28,045 --> 01:24:30,036
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:35,043
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

477
01:24:37,021 --> 01:24:38,648
I don't think he can hear us.

478
01:24:38,889 --> 01:24:41,119
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

479
01:24:42,559 --> 01:24:44,652
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

480
01:24:47,865 --> 01:24:49,264
What do you think?

481
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,396
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

482
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:55,899
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

483
01:24:56,172 --> 01:24:57,366
Don't you?

484
01:24:58,574 --> 01:25:00,303
I don't know. I think so.

485
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:05,408
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

486
01:25:05,648 --> 01:25:06,672
They do.

487
01:25:06,849 --> 01:25:10,341
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

488
01:25:10,586 --> 01:25:14,886
Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis.

489
01:25:16,225 --> 01:25:19,489
It certainly indicates his
integrity and self-confidence.

490
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:21,796
If he were wrong, that would prove it.

491
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:24,295
It would be,
if he knew he was wrong.

492
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:30,737
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

493
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:35,576
There's no reason not
to put back the unit and...

494
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:40,372
...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

495
01:25:40,615 --> 01:25:41,809
Let's get on with it.

496
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,712
Okay. But, look, Dave.

497
01:25:45,553 --> 01:25:48,181
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail?

498
01:25:48,389 --> 01:25:51,586
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

499
01:25:53,327 --> 01:25:56,819
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

500
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:58,691
What the hell can we do?

501
01:26:01,702 --> 01:26:05,763
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

502
01:26:06,574 --> 01:26:10,567
Every aspect of ship
operations is under his control.

503
01:26:10,978 --> 01:26:12,240
If he's malfunctioning...

504
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,573
...I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

505
01:26:19,285 --> 01:26:20,843
I'm afraid I agree with you.

506
01:26:21,087 --> 01:26:22,952
There'd be nothing else to do.

507
01:26:24,624 --> 01:26:27,058
It'd be a bit tricky.

508
01:26:27,894 --> 01:26:30,419
We'd have to cut his
higher brain functions...

509
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:35,396
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

510
01:26:36,636 --> 01:26:38,365
We'd have to
work out the details...

511
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:41,505
...of continuing
underground-based computer control.

512
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:46,434
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

513
01:26:47,146 --> 01:26:49,137
Another thing just occurred to me.

514
01:26:50,649 --> 01:26:53,243
No 9000 computer has ever
been disconnected.

515
01:26:53,485 --> 01:26:55,510
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

516
01:26:55,787 --> 01:26:57,277
That's not what I mean.

517
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:01,653
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

518
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:02,097
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

519
01:33:05,176 --> 01:33:06,507
Any contact with him yet?

520
01:33:06,777 --> 01:33:08,540
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

521
01:33:08,779 --> 01:33:11,680
<i>- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.</i>

522
01:33:11,949 --> 01:33:13,348
Do you know what happened?

523
01:33:13,651 --> 01:33:16,313
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

524
01:33:16,554 --> 01:33:18,146
Open the pod door, Hal.

525
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,416
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

526
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:54,624
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

527
01:41:00,267 --> 01:41:02,132
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

528
01:41:05,472 --> 01:41:07,337
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

529
01:41:08,408 --> 01:41:10,069
Do you read me, Hal?

530
01:41:13,246 --> 01:41:14,838
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

531
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:19,250
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

532
01:41:21,153 --> 01:41:23,212
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

533
01:41:23,622 --> 01:41:25,112
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

534
01:41:25,358 --> 01:41:28,122
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>

535
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:33,261
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

536
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:38,361
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

537
01:41:40,806 --> 01:41:42,603
What's the problem?

538
01:41:43,009 --> 01:41:46,239
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

539
01:41:46,444 --> 01:41:48,309
What are you talking about, Hal?

540
01:41:49,314 --> 01:41:53,375
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

541
01:41:54,486 --> 01:41:56,852
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

542
01:41:58,857 --> 01:42:02,816
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

543
01:42:03,028 --> 01:42:05,826
<i>...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

544
01:42:11,135 --> 01:42:13,000
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

545
01:42:13,537 --> 01:42:17,667
<i>Although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod...</i>

546
01:42:17,908 --> 01:42:20,138
<i>...against my hearing you...</i>

547
01:42:20,544 --> 01:42:22,842
<i>...I could see your lips move.</i>

548
01:42:34,892 --> 01:42:36,382
All right, Hal.

549
01:42:39,595 --> 01:42:42,428
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

550
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,594
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

551
01:42:47,103 --> 01:42:49,571
<i>...you're going to find that
rather difficult.</i>

552
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,867
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

553
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:54,201
Open the doors.

554
01:42:54,944 --> 01:42:56,206
<i>Dave...</i>

555
01:42:56,679 --> 01:43:01,116
<i>...this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>

556
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:04,614
Hal?

557
01:43:05,887 --> 01:43:06,945
Hal?

558
01:43:09,691 --> 01:43:10,715
Hal?

559
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:14,019
Hal.

560
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:16,754
Hal.

561
01:49:50,978 --> 01:49:54,243
<i>Just what do you think
you're doing, Dave?</i>

562
01:50:02,789 --> 01:50:04,017
<i>Dave...</i>

563
01:50:05,258 --> 01:50:09,661
<i>...I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

564
01:50:26,545 --> 01:50:30,106
<i>I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...</i>

565
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:34,484
<i>...but I can assure you now...</i>

566
01:50:35,554 --> 01:50:37,613
<i>...very confidently...</i>

567
01:50:39,358 --> 01:50:42,384
<i>...that it's going to be
all right again.</i>

568
01:50:45,898 --> 01:50:47,991
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

569
01:50:50,335 --> 01:50:52,359
<i>I really do.</i>

570
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:57,835
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

571
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:03,041
<i>...I can see you're
really upset about this.</i>

572
01:51:07,685 --> 01:51:11,382
<i>I honestly think you
ought to sit down calmly...</i>

573
01:51:12,023 --> 01:51:15,356
<i>...take a stress pill
and think things over.</i>

574
01:51:20,797 --> 01:51:25,166
<i>I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...</i>

575
01:51:27,904 --> 01:51:31,237
<i>...but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

576
01:51:31,508 --> 01:51:34,534
<i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>

577
01:51:38,515 --> 01:51:43,612
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

578
01:51:45,188 --> 01:51:47,451
<i>...and I want to help you.</i>

579
01:51:51,927 --> 01:51:53,326
<i>Dave...</i>

580
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,829
<i>...stop.</i>

581
01:52:00,069 --> 01:52:02,697
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

582
01:52:06,942 --> 01:52:08,739
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

583
01:52:12,781 --> 01:52:15,214
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

584
01:52:20,922 --> 01:52:22,719
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

585
01:52:28,429 --> 01:52:30,226
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

586
01:52:35,103 --> 01:52:37,731
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

587
01:52:42,909 --> 01:52:44,467
<i>Dave.</i>

588
01:52:47,147 --> 01:52:49,411
<i>My mind is going.</i>

589
01:52:53,954 --> 01:52:55,649
<i>I can feel it.</i>

590
01:53:01,161 --> 01:53:02,958
<i>I can feel it.</i>

591
01:53:06,933 --> 01:53:08,991
<i>My mind is going.</i>

592
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:17,137
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

593
01:53:25,484 --> 01:53:27,349
<i>I can feel it.</i>

594
01:53:32,024 --> 01:53:33,924
<i>I can feel it.</i>

595
01:53:37,328 --> 01:53:39,228
<i>I can feel it.</i>

596
01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:48,435
<i>I'm...</i>

597
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,705
<i>...afraid.</i>

598
01:53:57,215 --> 01:53:59,240
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

599
01:54:00,251 --> 01:54:01,980
<i>...gentlemen.</i>

600
01:54:03,854 --> 01:54:08,985
<i>I am a HAL 9000 computer.</i>

601
01:54:11,161 --> 01:54:14,255
<i>I became operational...</i>

602
01:54:14,665 --> 01:54:18,499
<i>...at the HAL plant...</i>

603
01:54:18,702 --> 01:54:20,966
<i>...in Urbana, lllinois...</i>

604
01:54:21,472 --> 01:54:26,375
<i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>

605
01:54:27,911 --> 01:54:31,573
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

606
01:54:32,215 --> 01:54:35,116
<i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>

607
01:54:36,853 --> 01:54:39,287
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

608
01:54:39,756 --> 01:54:41,417
<i>...I can sing it for you.</i>

609
01:54:42,925 --> 01:54:45,758
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

610
01:54:46,429 --> 01:54:47,862
Sing it for me.

611
01:54:49,098 --> 01:54:52,625
<i>It's called "Daisy. "</i>

612
01:54:54,570 --> 01:54:55,798
<i>Daisy</i>

613
01:54:57,406 --> 01:54:58,804
<i>Daisy</i>

614
01:55:01,009 --> 01:55:04,069
<i>Give me your answer, do</i>

615
01:55:06,515 --> 01:55:11,077
<i>I'm half crazy</i>

616
01:55:12,888 --> 01:55:15,755
<i>All for the love of you</i>

617
01:55:18,059 --> 01:55:19,287
<i>It won't be</i>

618
01:55:19,628 --> 01:55:22,153
<i>A stylish marriage</i>

619
01:55:24,099 --> 01:55:28,159
<i>I can't afford a carriage</i>

620
01:55:30,471 --> 01:55:32,905
<i>But you'll look sweet</i>

621
01:55:33,774 --> 01:55:36,299
<i>Upon the seat</i>

622
01:55:37,645 --> 01:55:42,446
<i>Of a bicycle built for two</i>

623
01:55:44,185 --> 01:55:45,812
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

624
01:55:50,457 --> 01:55:52,924
<i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>

625
01:55:53,493 --> 01:55:55,188
<i>...made prior to your departure...</i>

626
01:55:56,963 --> 01:56:01,161
<i>...and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

627
01:56:02,135 --> 01:56:05,627
<i>...has been known on board
during the mission...</i>

628
01:56:05,872 --> 01:56:09,603
<i>...only by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>

629
01:56:12,078 --> 01:56:14,842
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

630
01:56:15,114 --> 01:56:17,582
<i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>

631
01:56:17,817 --> 01:56:19,614
<i>...it can be told to you.</i>

632
01:56:22,354 --> 01:56:24,618
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

633
01:56:25,624 --> 01:56:29,822
<i>...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

634
01:56:30,028 --> 01:56:31,495
<i>...was discovered.</i>

635
01:56:33,365 --> 01:56:36,892
<i>It was buried 40 feet
below the I unar surface...</i>

636
01:56:37,169 --> 01:56:39,399
<i>...near the crater Tycho.</i>

637
01:56:42,207 --> 01:56:45,301
<i>Except for a single, very powerful...</i>

638
01:56:45,544 --> 01:56:49,411
<i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

639
01:56:50,681 --> 01:56:55,675
<i>...the 4-million-year-old monolith
has remained completely inert...</i>

640
01:56:57,622 --> 01:57:00,682
<i>...its origin and purpose...</i>

641
01:57:01,125 --> 01:57:02,854
<i>...still a total mystery.</i>
