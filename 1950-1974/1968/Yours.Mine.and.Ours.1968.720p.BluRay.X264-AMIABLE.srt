1
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,156
<i>09.00.</i>

2
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,745
<i>In a few short hours,
I was going into combat...</i>

3
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,697
<i>against my own children.</i>

4
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:43,747
<i>Anyone who has a child
knows what I'm talking about.</i>

5
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:47,871
<i>That's the real war:
Our generation against theirs.</i>

6
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:52,055
<i>Standing on that deck,
surrounded by thousands of men...</i>

7
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:57,263
<i>I suddenly felt smaller and lonelier
than I'd ever felt in my life.</i>

8
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:00,519
<i>I'd been through this same Golden Gate
when Frances had died...</i>

9
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,096
<i>and I'd come home on emergency leave.</i>

10
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:05,480
<i>Now I was back for good.</i>

11
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,059
<i>I'd left more than my heart
in San Francisco:</i>

12
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:10,230
<i>Ten children, to be exact.</i>

13
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,989
<i>As we sailed under that bridge, I didn't
know I was passing under my future...</i>

14
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,782
<i>because while I was going home
to face my family...</i>

15
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,998
<i>Helen was bringing hers
to a new life in a new city.</i>

16
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,041
<i>And don't think I wasn't frightened.</i>

17
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,788
<i>I had become a Navy widow.</i>

18
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,839
<i>I thought it was a good idea
to get a fresh start...</i>

19
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,580
<i>where the surroundings
wouldn't remind me of Dick.</i>

20
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:34,135
<i>But four of my surroundings
looked exactly like him.</i>

21
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:36,096
<i>What troubled me more than anything...</i>

22
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:39,883
<i>was the kids seemed more upset
about leaving their friends in Seattle...</i>

23
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,852
<i>than by the loss of their father.</i>

24
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,520
<i>It took me a long time to learn
how little I knew about children...</i>

25
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,767
<i>especially my own.</i>

26
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,903
<i>As the ship sailed into the bay,
I took a good look around...</i>

27
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,859
<i>because I knew I'd completed
my last tour aboard her.</i>

28
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,862
<i>My brother and his wife
had been taking care of my kids...</i>

29
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,320
<i>but now it was Daddy's turn.</i>

30
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,574
<i>So I started down the gangplank...</i>

31
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,870
<i>certain I was doing the right thing...</i>

32
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,833
<i>nobly sacrificing myself
for my children...</i>

33
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,755
<i>giving up my world for theirs.</i>

34
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:17,174
<i>Pulling away forever from ships
and oceans and homecomings...</i>

35
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,091
<i>to take up shore duty.</i>

36
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,093
<i>Papa came marching home...</i>

37
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:23,594
<i>secure in the knowledge
that they needed me...</i>

38
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,688
<i>and would be overjoyed
I'd come back to take care of them.</i>

39
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:29,977
<i>But they controlled
their feelings beautifully.</i>

40
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:32,939
<i>It was the sort of welcome
that could make any father...</i>

41
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:36,981
<i>review his position on
the entire question of birth control.</i>

42
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,485
<i>Incredible as it may sound,
they blame me...</i>

43
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,069
<i>for neglecting their mother
all those years.</i>

44
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,035
<i>But it seemed to me
there was enough physical evidence...</i>

45
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>that I hadn't neglected her completely.</i>

46
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:51,747
<i>What they really couldn't understand
was why I was allowing my brother...</i>

47
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,542
<i>and his wife to take Germaine
and Joan away from the family.</i>

48
00:04:56,637 --> 00:05:00,717
Here you go, baby.
Come on, come with Uncle Howard.

49
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:05,641
Oh, you couldn't take care of
two little babies, Frank. Not yet.

50
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:07,889
They'll be happier with us for a while.

51
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:10,639
I hope you can learn to manage the rest.

52
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,570
You've hardly been home long enough
to learn their names.

53
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:16,988
I'm home now. I'll manage.
Don't you worry.

54
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:22,324
Goodbye, pumpkin. Bye, baby.
Don't give them any trouble.

55
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,329
If you live through this...

56
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,535
the Navy's going to have to get
a new kind of medal for you.

57
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,580
- Good luck, Frank.
- Good luck. You're gonna need it.

58
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:34,170
- Goodbye, Joan. Goodbye, Germaine.
- Goodbye.

59
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,016
Well, let's get something to eat.

60
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,353
They're not going to an orphanage,
you know.

61
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,146
They'll be half a mile away.
You can see them any time.

62
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,648
Susan, Louise, come on.

63
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,561
It's only until I get things
straightened out here.

64
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,944
And then what? You planning on
auctioning off the rest of us?

65
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:05,618
Where would I find a bidder? Come on,
in the kitchen. Let's get dinner.

66
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,707
Which one of us do you wanna cook?

67
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,671
The war was on.

68
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:22,386
<i>I put an ad in the paper
for a housekeeper that brought results.</i>

69
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,964
<i>The first one lasted an entire day.</i>

70
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:40,111
<i>The second one lasted seven days.</i>

71
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,773
<i>We discovered she was hiding
from the police.</i>

72
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,363
<i>After a week with us,
she turned herself in.</i>

73
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:56,997
<i>No wonder men go down to the sea in ships.</i>

74
00:06:57,174 --> 00:07:00,258
<i>I'd have gone back in a life raft.</i>

75
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,596
<i>I had rented an ideal house
close to the Navy base...</i>

76
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:08,098
<i>so I could work part-time
in the dispensary, close to the school...</i>

77
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:12,764
<i>close to the playground and a little
too close to the boy next door.</i>

78
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,019
<i>I was broad-minded about it, though.</i>

79
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,319
<i>I was gonna give that boy
two more seconds...</i>

80
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,444
<i>before I went out there and broke it up.</i>

81
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:30,655
I hate ants. I hate ants. I hate ants!

82
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,287
Come on, this is really stupid.

83
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:38,162
Listen, what are you doing? What
are you...? You hate ants. Never mind.

84
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,751
Now, that belongs to her.

85
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:43,294
What is the matter with you?
You've been acting like this all week.

86
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:46,596
Mother, how's a person supposed to hear?

87
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,597
Colleen, I'd like to know what's going
on between you and that boy.

88
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,438
And I don't care if he does look like
Paul Newman.

89
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:56,185
- Is the spanking over?
- No, it is not over.

90
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,185
Listen, what's gotten into you lately?

91
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,851
Where is that good little boy
that used to live here?

92
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,025
I'll never be a good boy again.
I'm never gonna be good.

93
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,275
I don't wanna die.

94
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,320
What are you talking about?

95
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:12,665
Nicky told me that the good die young,
and that's why Daddy died.

96
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:18,201
You can hit me and you can hit me,
but I'll never be a good boy again.

97
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,882
<i>Funny. Beginning of the school year...</i>

98
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:25,844
<i>had never been a problem to Frances.</i>

99
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,764
<i>The girls passed their dresses down
from one to another...</i>

100
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:31,257
<i>and it all sort of came out even.</i>

101
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:41,686
<i>Have you ever been 5 years old
and forced to appear in public...</i>

102
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:47,022
<i>in a dress that had three former
owners, restyled by an old sail maker?</i>

103
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:50,907
<i>Five years old and no future at all.</i>

104
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:45,122
<i>And then one day, Frank and I just
happened to run into each other.</i>

105
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:56,512
<i>I'd been wrapped up in my children
for so long that getting this close...</i>

106
00:09:56,686 --> 00:10:02,392
<i>to an attractive woman set my
early warning radar pulsing frantically.</i>

107
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:08,104
<i>I was glad to have a reason
for a second look myself.</i>

108
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,863
You requisition those Fresnel lenses?

109
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:18,241
I'll answer that tomorrow.
The working day has ceased.

110
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,990
Just starting for me.
Drop me at the house.

111
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,541
Frank, do you realise
that at this very hour...

112
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:26,833
the Officers' Club is jam-packed
with two-legged goodies.

113
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:29,677
We owe it to our brethren at sea
to do unto others...

114
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:32,929
as they would if they had our chance.

115
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,093
Darrell, it may come as a shock...

116
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,558
but there are other things besides girls.

117
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,723
Yeah, women.

118
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,892
Now, don't tell me it isn't on your mind.

119
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:49,066
Any fella who has 10 children
just doesn't quit cold turkey.

120
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,240
And if you'd only just...

121
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:55,777
Why don't you watch where you're...
Oh, hello.

122
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,454
Hi.

123
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:01,833
Well, old Sam the hermit gets out
of the cave once in a while, huh?

124
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,205
She had my Cream of Wheat
and I had her Post Toasties.

125
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,831
- What?
- Saw her at the commissary, that's all.

126
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:10,384
Frank, what's wrong with you?

127
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:12,758
You gonna be an old maid
the rest of your life?

128
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,502
You really think that's what Frances
would've wanted?

129
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,555
Probably not, but give me time.

130
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,560
Time? You're a borderline case already.

131
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:23,729
You may only have a few more
cruises left in you.

132
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:34,116
- Come on in. I'll buy you a beer.
- I thought you'd never ask me.

133
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:38,567
You can stop worrying about me.
Things are looking up.

134
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:42,447
I finally found a housekeeper
who seems to have staying power.

135
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,705
Soon I'll ask you to loan me
your little black book, but right now...

136
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:48,955
Where you going, Mrs. Anderson?

137
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,041
Mrs. Anderson was last week.

138
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:55,464
I'm Mrs. Ferguson,
and you can mail me my check.

139
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:58,385
She left her broomstick.

140
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:05,553
All right, what happened this time?

141
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:08,436
Who did what to Mrs. Ferguson?

142
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,851
All right, one at a time. One at a time.

143
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,146
- She and Louise had a fight.
- A bad fight.

144
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:16,158
Louise wouldn't come out
of the bathroom for an hour.

145
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,443
She went in, and they were yelling.

146
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,241
- Is that strawberry jam on your hands?
- Raspberry.

147
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:24,492
I guess she started shaking her...
Or she slipped on the soap.

148
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,870
- Anyway, she fell.
- She didn't fall, she fainted...

149
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,670
right on the floor.

150
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:33,665
When Mrs. Ferguson came out, I was
kind of mad, and I had to push her.

151
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:39,591
Wait a minute. Hold it!
Louise fainted? Where is she?

152
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:42,091
She's in her room crying,
and she won't come out.

153
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:43,643
We tried.

154
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,222
I think she's dying.

155
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,435
- And what have you been playing with?
- Ink.

156
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,484
Indelible.

157
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:57,238
Louise.

158
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,820
Louise, what in the world happened
between you and Mrs. Ferguson?

159
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,201
I don't wanna talk about it.
Leave me alone.

160
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,448
Mary said you fainted. Is something wrong?

161
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,373
No. I just wish I could get out of this
house and drown myself, that's all.

162
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,502
At least I'd be alone.

163
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:14,507
Let me take you to the dispensary,
have them check you out.

164
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:18,044
No. I don't wanna see any doctors,
and I don't want them to see me!

165
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,972
- But, Louise...
- No, please. I don't want to.

166
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,713
No, stop it! I don't want to.

167
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:27,725
No, put me down! I don't wanna go, please.

168
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:29,936
Stop it, I don't want to.

169
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,397
Mr. Beardsley?

170
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:40,152
- How is she?
- Oh, she's fine.

171
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:42,318
Nothing to worry about. May I talk to you?

172
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,490
Privately.

173
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,286
I forgot my Post Toasties.

174
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,080
We've scarcely met, but I feel
that I must talk to you about this.

175
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:56,586
Of course.

176
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,882
Your daughter tells me
that you're a widower?

177
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,804
Yes, that's right.

178
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm awfully sorry.

179
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:08,185
Louise seems to feel the loss
of her mother very deeply.

180
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:13,431
On top of that, she's going through
a very trying time emotionally.

181
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:16,349
I don't quite understand.
Am I being stupid?

182
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:22,531
No, you're being a man,
which is sometimes the same thing.

183
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:25,741
You can learn to do
the shopping for the family...

184
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:28,748
and maybe even do the dishes...

185
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,580
but that doesn't exactly
make you a mother.

186
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,625
Well, I'm not really cut out for the job.

187
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,710
Well, it seems that it's not been easy...

188
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:44,425
for Louise to explain to you that...

189
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,391
You know...

190
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:55,347
a tree can blossom in the middle
of a busy city...

191
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:57,518
but a young girl needs privacy...

192
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,613
and she hasn't been able
to find it at home.

193
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:04,945
So if she's been emotional or upset
or even a little bit hysterical...

194
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:10,160
it's because she's growing up
and suddenly changing.

195
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,658
Is that all? Why didn't she tell me?

196
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,410
Because you would've said, "Is that all?"

197
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,458
She said that she's been very upset...

198
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:23,382
about having to share
her room at home, and...

199
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,471
Today, when the maid walked in
while she was taking a bath...

200
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,760
- ...she was so embarrassed that she...
- Poor Louise.

201
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:32,640
Stopped being a little girl,
and I never noticed.

202
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:37,060
Well, if it's any help, I understand.

203
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:40,769
I'm a widow, and I have
the same problem in reverse.

204
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:44,397
Now I'm sorry.
Have you been alone very long?

205
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,823
Forever.

206
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,407
Almost a year now.

207
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,409
I know what you mean.

208
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:57,334
Dick was a navigator.
He crashed, routine training flight.

209
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,715
- Navy?
- What else is there?

210
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:04,299
Children?
They say it's toughest on the kids...

211
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,337
- ...but they haven't convinced me.
- I know.

212
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:10,848
And right now I think you have...

213
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:13,687
a rather difficult assignment
with your daughter.

214
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:16,689
I think you should go in
and talk to her and take her home.

215
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,274
Thank you, Mrs?

216
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,228
North. Helen.

217
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,815
Thank you, North Helen.

218
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:29,025
- When are you on duty here?
- Afternoons. Five days a week.

219
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:33,200
Any of my kids get sick on
the weekend, I'll hold them over.

220
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,755
Hi.

221
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,424
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.

222
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:49,596
- Can I go home now?
- Sure.

223
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:52,716
Turn around.

224
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,981
- Hello.
- Oh, is this North Helen?

225
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,454
- Yes. Who is this?
- This is Frank Beardsley.

226
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,160
Oh, are you having more problems?

227
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:45,126
No, no. I just called to thank you for
helping me with my daughter today.

228
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:48,831
Well, now, that's the worst reason
I ever heard...

229
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,093
for calling a woman at 11:00 at night.

230
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:55,014
Well, I'm a little out of practise.

231
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:58,592
Well, as a matter of fact, so am I.

232
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:02,022
Oh, for heaven's sake,
ask her out to dinner.

233
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,517
Who's that?

234
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,059
- What are you doing on this phone?
- I have to make an important call...

235
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:10,189
and he gets off duty
at the taco stand at 11:15.

236
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:13,033
Colleen, hang up.

237
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,408
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

238
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:17,865
I could never have done it without her.

239
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,371
How about dinner? Tomorrow night.

240
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,829
Well...

241
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,041
Mother, it's 11:14.

242
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,039
What time would you like to pick me up?

243
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,124
- About 1900?
- Aye, aye, sir.

244
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,423
- Good night, Helen.
- Good night, Frank.

245
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,385
Good night, Colleen.

246
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:43,471
Mother, don't blink.
You've got to let the glue dry.

247
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:46,979
But I look ridiculous
with all this goop on my eyes.

248
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,818
- Mommy, you're beautiful.
- You sure are.

249
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:53,686
Thank you, but is it necessary
that I wear these eyelashes?

250
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,655
I got your father without them.

251
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:58,196
- But you were younger then.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:01,737
- Here. Here goes the other side.
- Hold steady.

253
00:20:02,623 --> 00:20:05,458
Okay, let me take it now.

254
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,413
- Mother.
- What?

255
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:11,999
Is he handsome?
I mean, in an old sort of way.

256
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:15,044
- Gee, I can hardly wait to meet him.
- Me too.

257
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:19,634
Let's not overwhelm him with family.
Not the first date, huh?

258
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:23,471
- You mean he doesn't know about us?
- Of course he does, darling.

259
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,932
All of us?

260
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,762
Mother, that's so romantic.

261
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,858
- You lied to him.
- I did not lie to him.

262
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:34,779
I just didn't have the nerve
to tell him the whole truth.

263
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:40,189
I understand. No man wants a liaison
with a woman with eight children.

264
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,694
- What's a liaison?
- An affair.

265
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,279
- That's what I thought.
- Me too.

266
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,826
I am not having an affair,
and I'm not having a liaison.

267
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:50,331
I'm merely going to dinner.

268
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:52,164
As soon as I tell him about you...

269
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:55,708
he'll bring me home
in plenty of time for dessert.

270
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:03,923
Mike, see that it's lights out by 10:00.

271
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:07,018
- Ten o'clock?
- We're back in kindergarten?

272
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:10,847
- They stay up later in prison.
- Would you like to move?

273
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,815
When you finish with the slot cars...

274
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,024
spend 10 minutes with your geometry book.

275
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:16,523
Flowers, Pop?

276
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:20,439
Is that corny. How do you expect
to make any time with that approach?

277
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,825
We are just going to dinner.
It isn't going to be a love-in.

278
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:26,575
- You can say that again.
- No such luck.

279
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,411
Did you tell the lady
you have 10 little children...

280
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:33,084
- ...two of them given away?
- You bet he didn't.

281
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:36,125
He'll hand her those flowers,
then give her a snow job...

282
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,294
- ...on how lonely it is here at home.
- You listen to me.

283
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:44,840
Every time in the last year that I've
dared take a woman to dinner...

284
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:47,851
or been reckless enough
to bring her home to meet you...

285
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,471
you've done all you could to make
her unwelcome. Well, I've had it.

286
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:54,139
I'm doing all I can for you,
little as that is...

287
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,559
I think I deserve some consideration.

288
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,978
I suppose I'm being unfair. Who did this?

289
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:02,407
My generation is the givers,
your generation, the takers.

290
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:05,742
Well, it's time to strike a blow
for freedom.

291
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:08,747
From now on,
I intend to think of myself first.

292
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:11,620
If this be treason, make the most of it.

293
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:15,826
- But are you gonna tell her?
- Yes, I'm going to tell her.

294
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:22,091
You're gonna be a knockout tonight, Mom.

295
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:26,094
- Yeah, Mom, you're beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.

296
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:29,304
Good heavens,
what did you do to this dress?

297
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:31,933
Mother, it was practically an antique.

298
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,765
We just shortened it a little.

299
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,649
- A little? I look like a teenybopper.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

300
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,860
- I can't go out in this.
- Why not?

301
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:42,774
Your legs are better than mine.

302
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:46,199
It'll be okay as soon as we shorten
the slip. Give me those pins.

303
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,409
Oh, heavens. Jean, run downstairs...

304
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,783
and tell Tommy to whistle
the minute he sees Mr. Beardsley.

305
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,081
- But I wanna watch.
- Please, Jean.

306
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:57,206
- The minute he sees Mr. Beardsley.
- Will you stand still?

307
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,172
You'll get this pin stuck in you.

308
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,214
I'm put together with pins and glue.

309
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:04,338
If there's a strong wind, I'm in trouble.

310
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:07,964
- There he is. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- He's coming!

311
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:11,018
- Look at him.
- Wow, look at that car!

312
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:13,262
- He's in the Navy.
- Look at that jacket.

313
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,143
Look at those stripes.
He's got flowers for Mom.

314
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:20,444
- Yeah, blue eyes.
- Boy, I bet you that guy's rich.

315
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:25,189
- All right.
- No!

316
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,909
- Pass it on.
- The door.

317
00:23:27,076 --> 00:23:28,405
Get away from the door.

318
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:34,248
Get away from that door. Get away.
Get back. Get back.

319
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:39,248
- Hello there.
- Hello.

320
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:42,542
Well, we better hurry. I know
how you like to get places on time.

321
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,591
- I do?
- Yeah. Where are we going?

322
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:47,252
San Francisco. Little place...
I brought you flowers.

323
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,636
Thank you. Why, they're beautiful.

324
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,096
Shouldn't you put them in the house,
in water?

325
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:55,471
Of course.
I don't know what I was thinking.

326
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,773
They're my favourite.

327
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:02,398
Beautiful night, isn't it?

328
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:05,480
<i>I had a wonderful time at dinner.</i>

329
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,982
<i>I didn't know whether it was the food
or Frank...</i>

330
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,567
<i>or the fact that I didn't have
to do the dishes.</i>

331
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:13,865
<i>I couldn't stop talking. I told her
about Frances, the Navy...</i>

332
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,124
<i>about the new carrier
landing system I was working on.</i>

333
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:19,915
<i>I told her about everything
but the children.</i>

334
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,792
<i>Funny how that never came up.</i>

335
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:27,259
<i>I guess I figured it would be easier
over an Irish coffee.</i>

336
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:35,510
<i>While Frank was getting the drinks...</i>

337
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:40,598
<i>I was trying to figure out the most
graceful way to break it to him.</i>

338
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:52,490
By the way, I have eight children.

339
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,912
Speaking of eight children,
that's what I have.

340
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:07,757
Have I mentioned
that I have eight children?

341
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:14,009
I have eight children.

342
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:18,133
Well, don't look at me. I just got here.

343
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:22,896
Excuse me, please.

344
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:26,313
Pardon me.

345
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:27,946
That's all right.

346
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:32,443
- That's why I come in this place.
- What's your excuse?

347
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,700
Pardon me, sir.

348
00:25:44,422 --> 00:25:46,960
- I'm sorry, I...
- That's all right.

349
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:49,671
- That's why I come to this place.
- What?

350
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:53,295
That's a line I picked up
on my way back from the bar.

351
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:56,677
I don't know, you may have
to drink this through your ear.

352
00:25:56,851 --> 00:26:01,311
Frank, there's something I wanna tell you.

353
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,354
What?

354
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,518
That was a wonderful dinner
we had tonight.

355
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:12,231
- I enjoyed all eight courses.
- So did I.

356
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:15,113
- Speaking of children...
- We weren't speaking of children.

357
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:17,693
- Thank goodness.
- Tonight, there are no children...

358
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:21,371
in the world.
We're all alone on this desert island.

359
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:25,492
Just you and me
and a native who makes Irish coffee.

360
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:28,495
I'll drink to that.

361
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:35,637
- Helen.
- Yes, Frank?

362
00:26:35,806 --> 00:26:38,214
There's something I've been meaning
to tell you.

363
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:41,429
- What?
- No, I want you to look at me first.

364
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:45,346
No, look at me.

365
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:50,104
- Just a moment.
- May I have a light?

366
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:56,327
Not on your life, sweetheart.

367
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:08,169
Ridiculous.

368
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:15,255
- Something wrong?
- No.

369
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,671
No, no. What did you want to tell me?

370
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:21,513
Well, this is the last time
I'm going to bring up the subject...

371
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:23,892
but you do like children, don't you?

372
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:27,099
- Yeah. Yeah, within reason.
- In that case, the hell with it.

373
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:29,350
No. No, no,
as long as you brought it up...

374
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:31,934
there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

375
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:35,066
- What?
- Well...

376
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,114
What?

377
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,783
- What's the matter?
- I beg your pardon.

378
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:45,241
- Something wrong?
- Yes. Yes, Frank...

379
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:47,789
I have this terrible craving
for a cigarette.

380
00:27:47,962 --> 00:27:51,377
I don't know what I'll do if I don't get
a cigarette. I may have a fit.

381
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:53,671
Could you get me a pack from the machine?

382
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,512
What brand? King-size or regular?
Filter or non-filter?

383
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,137
- Yeah, wonderful.
- What?

384
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,974
- And hurry.
- Well, here, hold this.

385
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:11,349
Hello, nurse.

386
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,770
- Darrell.
- Well, Helen.

387
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:18,273
Hello, Darrell.

388
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:20,781
Your Irish coffee is winking at me.

389
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:23,159
- Darrell, help me.
- Does this happen often...

390
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,781
- ...or only during the moulting season?
- Hurry, please.

391
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:30,078
Now, don't you worry, honey.
I'm very good at this.

392
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:33,836
I've got an admiral with a loose toupee.

393
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,423
Coming through.

394
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:42,798
Pardon me.

395
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:44,802
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:47,978
Back for seconds?

397
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:56,101
Darrell, what are you doing here?
Chaperoning?

398
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,696
Oh, no, I've been here since yesterday.
Haven't been able to get out.

399
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,444
You mean you haven't been trying.

400
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:05,118
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

401
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:08,826
- What did you do to your eye?
- What did you do to my eye?

402
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,492
Don't listen to him. It's perfect.

403
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,544
Let's drink to the perfect couple.

404
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:16,465
Two people who have so much in common.

405
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,041
It's positively nauseating.

406
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,761
To our nurse.

407
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,841
You know, I just found out
that she has a family of...

408
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:28,345
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

409
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,016
Over at Frank's, when they pass
the soup, it's like Niagara Falls.

410
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:36,027
He probably hasn't mentioned it,
but he happens to have a...

411
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:38,816
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Sure is a rough sea tonight.

412
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:40,981
Yeah, it's very crowded in here.

413
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,400
Yeah, speaking of crowds...

414
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:46,993
you know, you two kids
really belong to each other.

415
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:49,322
I just found out
that she's the mother of...

416
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:52,666
Squeezing through... Who pushed me?

417
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:56,039
- Here, let me help you.
- Hey, if you two wanna be alone...

418
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:58,752
- ...give a guy a hint.
- Let's get out of here.

419
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:00,254
Sorry.

420
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:16,352
Frank.

421
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,234
What? How could you lose your slip?

422
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,904
Don't ask questions.
It's back there someplace.

423
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:27,361
Do something about that floating eyelash.

424
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:50,135
Oh, you are a tiger, aren't you?

425
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:09,571
Frank, before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

426
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:12,118
- Now what fell off?
- No, no, nothing like that.

427
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,781
I wish it were something that trivial.

428
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:19,834
Frank, I have eight children.

429
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:23,708
- Eight children!
- Four boys, four girls.

430
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:26,091
Different ages.

431
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:30,304
Frank. Frank, we're on a cable car.

432
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:33,802
- Of course.
- I get sick on cable cars.

433
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,392
- Wait till you hear what I tell you.
- What?

434
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:40,609
- I have 10 children.
- Ten?

435
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:44,277
Ten? Ten!

436
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,448
Three boys, five girls.

437
00:31:48,284 --> 00:31:52,329
- That's only eight.
- And two on loan-out.

438
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:55,577
Frank, eight and 10 is...

439
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,034
Ridiculous.

440
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:03,502
Helen, let's get off this damn thing.
Now I'm feeling sick.

441
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:19,437
Frank, what do you mean,
"two on loan-out"?

442
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,399
Well, a man alone...

443
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:25,435
I just haven't been able to keep
a family that large together.

444
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:28,567
My brother and sister-in-law
have the two youngest.

445
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:32,193
- That's awful.
- That's what my kids keep telling me.

446
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,664
They hate me for it,
and I'm on their side.

447
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:53,094
I wish you had known Dick.

448
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:56,386
- What was he like?
- Like you, in many ways.

449
00:32:56,561 --> 00:33:00,641
All wrapped up in the Navy
and his children.

450
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,437
And in you?

451
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:21,329
Frank, I wanna thank you
for a wonderful evening.

452
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,875
It was nice knowing you.

453
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,621
It was nice knowing you.

454
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:32,761
- You know what?
- What?

455
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,801
- I'd like to buy you something.
- Oh, that isn't necessary.

456
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:39,558
Souvenir of our first and last date.

457
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:48,522
- How about that Buddha?
- Oh, no.

458
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,772
That looks like real jade.

459
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:54,816
- How about that little fan?
- Fifty-five cents' worth of memories?

460
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:57,865
That's a pretty little lady.

461
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,836
- You have excellent taste.
- Thank you.

462
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:09,129
This is a Chinese goddess...

463
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,918
who confers her magical powers
on all who gaze upon her.

464
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,171
- What is she called?
- Kuan Yin.

465
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:18,930
- What does that mean?
- Joyous symbol of fertility.

466
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,657
Wave him off. Bring him around again.

467
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,994
3-4-Paddles. Wave it off
and bring it around again.

468
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,329
Why didn't you tell me she had eight kids?

469
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,828
Why didn't I tell you?

470
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,919
I got third-degree Irish coffee burns
trying to tell you.

471
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:49,246
But don't you worry about a thing.

472
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,341
I've got a few less-crowded ladies
who'll knock your hat off.

473
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,752
Let's drop the subject. I've had it.

474
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,886
You haven't, and that's what worries me.

475
00:34:57,056 --> 00:35:00,306
- You've been in dry dock too long.
- Ask him to move the ball around.

476
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:03,014
Come in low, check the red cell
and come on in.

477
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,180
3-4-Paddles, move the ball around.

478
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,183
Check the red cell and bring it on in.

479
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:10,402
It's no use. What girl is gonna want
to spend an evening...

480
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,606
- ...with a man who has 10 children?
- A girl who doesn't know it.

481
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,489
- Want me to lie?
- Of course not.

482
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,694
- Don't bring the subject up until after.
- Here he comes.

483
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:32,539
3-4-Paddles. Nice pass.

484
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:35,338
Now, I know a quiet little
Japanese restaurant.

485
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,800
I'll make the reservations.

486
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,848
Madeleine Love.

487
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,384
Now, there is a girl
who is definitely not a talker.

488
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,811
What sort of a girl is she?

489
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:59,065
Does that answer your question?

490
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:05,038
No, Darrell, and stop trying
to arrange my life.

491
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,247
Helen, I'm surprised you haven't met him.

492
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:08,746
Make a fist.

493
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,919
I haven't done anything yet.

494
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,876
I was practising.
He's a wonderful doctor...

495
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,794
the kind who scrubs for a date.

496
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,425
Tremendous reputation. Nine handicap.

497
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,174
Now.

498
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,263
No more dates.

499
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:28,306
Don't think of him as a date,
think of him as a meal.

500
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,150
Now, I know a quiet little
Japanese restaurant.

501
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:33,309
I'll make the reservations.

502
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,110
Don't rush me.

503
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:39,651
What does he look like?

504
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,276
I hate to use the word "Adonis,"
but there's no other way to say it.

505
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:46,704
A touch of grey at the temples,
very distinguished.

506
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,038
Is he tall?

507
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,745
He used to be a basketball player.

508
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,881
I had to lie, of course.

509
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:01,171
But anybody who knew Frank and
Helen knew they belonged together.

510
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:05,131
All I had to do was let them stumble
over each other a few times.

511
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,847
You have to do that
with the marrying kind of people.

512
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,267
<i>So I told her that Dr. Ashford
was about 6'2", 6'3".</i>

513
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,185
<i>A harmless little white lie.</i>

514
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,316
<i>I wondered if the doctor would
be so attentive if I told him...</i>

515
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:24,742
<i>I had three children taller than he was.</i>

516
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,460
<i>Darrell's arrangement for my
evening hadn't uttered a word...</i>

517
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:36,499
<i>since I pick ed her up. I had
no idea what was on her mind...</i>

518
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:39,710
<i>until we drew up in front
of the restaurant.</i>

519
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,098
There. I hate suspense, don't you?

520
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,926
Now you know and I know.

521
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,509
Let's have a quick dinner.

522
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:58,275
Keep the motor running.

523
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,914
Darrell said we had a lot in common.

524
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,384
After all, you're a nurse, I'm a doctor.

525
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,722
What's your specialty?

526
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,050
Obstetrics.

527
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:33,263
<i>Darrell had a malicious sense of humour.</i>

528
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:43,105
<i>I was upset that Frank
had seen me with Dr. Ashford.</i>

529
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:45,191
<i>I don't know why.</i>

530
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:55,032
<i>For some stupid reason,
I had the feeling I was being unfaithful.</i>

531
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,246
<i>And Madeleine had only taken off my shoes.</i>

532
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:02,414
<i>The doctor's bedside manner
was a little previous.</i>

533
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:09,723
<i>I was embarrassed to think
that Frank might be watching.</i>

534
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:11,220
<i>He was.</i>

535
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,433
You're not worshipping me.

536
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:23,737
Thank you.

537
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:29,284
Helen, I might as well be honest.

538
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:35,242
I'm a very lonely man. There are times
that I feel I could kick over the traces.

539
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:38,122
- I'm not lonely at all.
- Give up this race for money.

540
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:41,664
- I'm the mother of eight children.
- Travel to all the romantic places.

541
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,757
- I have eight.
- If I could find someone to go with me.

542
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,215
- Doctor. Doctor.
- I'd like to find places...

543
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,676
I don't think you've
been paying attention.

544
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:54,142
I said, I am the mother of eight children.

545
00:39:57,355 --> 00:40:01,400
I've always admired a woman
with a sense of humour.

546
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:11,701
<i>Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
it was round-up time.</i>

547
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,370
That's a very handsome family.

548
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,114
- Very handsome.
- Thank you.

549
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:20,914
Excuse me a moment, please?

550
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:22,795
Oh, of course.

551
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,519
Dr. Ashford?

552
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,077
Wasn't that your date?

553
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,747
Yes, it was.

554
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,461
He had an emergency.

555
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,882
- Come on, I'll take you home. Hop in.
- Oh, no, I wouldn't dream...

556
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,887
- Madeleine doesn't mind, do you?
- Are you kidding?

557
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,344
- You see?
- Well...

558
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:40,824
She's my oldest girl. She's going
with this boy who rides a motorcycle.

559
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,289
Has hair practically
down to his shoulders...

560
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,584
and I think it's bleached.

561
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,415
She never talks to me about him,
never brings him in so I can meet him.

562
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:52,546
- I hardly know what to do.
- You can't tell her not to see him.

563
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,390
- It's like shooting off the starting gun.
- I know.

564
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:59,222
You know, she's barely 16, and when
he brings her home at night...

565
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:02,015
they stay outside
for about half an hour, kissing.

566
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,679
Heavens to Betsy!
What will they think of next?

567
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,435
My Veronica, she's 7.

568
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:10,773
She's so boy crazy, I'm afraid she's
gonna get married before she's 9.

569
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:17,486
She doesn't care about school.
Only thing she can read are pictures.

570
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,497
Yeah, yeah. Well, Tommy's
almost 9. He can hardly read.

571
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,203
But Jean, who's only 7,
reads better than he does.

572
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,656
I have that in spades.

573
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:27,124
Louise is 12,
she corrects Rusty's spelling.

574
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:30,132
Well, Tommy can help
Colleen and Janette with their math...

575
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:33,550
- ...but he can't read.
- I don't believe this conversation.

576
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,297
Did you put something in my sugar?

577
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:38,009
I have a strange feeling
I'm taking a trip.

578
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:40,009
- How many kids do you have?
- Ten.

579
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,760
Helen, there's no reason for us
to avoid seeing each other.

580
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:48,061
Well, I think we certainly
could be friends.

581
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:51,899
The fact I'm a man and you're a woman
doesn't have anything to do with it.

582
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:54,313
And then the papa bear
said to the mama bear:

583
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,112
"Who's been sleeping in my bed?"

584
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,408
Oh, come on, drop me off at the exit.

585
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:02,995
Then you two can work yourselves
up to a wild game of post office.

586
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,957
No, I couldn't do that to you.

587
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:08,411
Oh, please, daddy, I'd prefer it.
Ten kids?

588
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:10,829
I'm nervous just sitting next to you.

589
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:12,875
- Helen.
- Yes?

590
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,799
Why am I pretending? I want to see
you again, and not just to be friends...

591
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,845
and not just to talk about children.

592
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:21,470
- I want to see you again too.
- Know something else?

593
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:24,762
In spite of all the aggravation
and the misery and the yelling...

594
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:28,140
- ...I'm glad I have 10 children.
- And I'm glad I have my eight.

595
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:31,233
And I'm glad I'm careful.

596
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,563
<i>Between our work and the children...</i>

597
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,487
<i>we somehow were able
to steal a few hours alone.</i>

598
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:29,510
<i>When every place we went was better
because we were together...</i>

599
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:32,473
<i>and I suddenly realised
the emptiness was gone...</i>

600
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,098
<i>and the world just might
be worth living in again...</i>

601
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,897
<i>I knew it was time for the acid test.</i>

602
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,190
<i>I invited Helen to my house
to meet my mafia.</i>

603
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,777
Here she comes! Here she comes!

604
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,281
What does she look like?

605
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,539
Mean. You can see it in her eyes.

606
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,002
Frank, I'm frightened.

607
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,083
Now, don't worry.

608
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,544
I had a long talk with the children.
They're going to love you.

609
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,172
Who locked the door?

610
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,722
Sorry, Dad.

611
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,932
I'll talk to you later.

612
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,647
Well, group, this is Mrs. North.

613
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,813
- Helen.
- You know Louise.

614
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,483
- Oh, yes. Hello, Louise.
- Hi.

615
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:25,985
- And Mike.
- Mike.

616
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,950
- And Rusty and Rosemary.
- Hello.

617
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,447
- Susan.
- Hello, Susan.

618
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,949
- Veronica.
- Hello, Veronica.

619
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,320
- And Greg.
- Greg.

620
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,827
You've met the family...

621
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,791
- ...why don't we have a drink.
- Frank.

622
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,831
- Yeah?
- This is only seven.

623
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,960
Mary. Where's Mary?

624
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,675
She's hiding.

625
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,300
Mary, come on, let's not play games.

626
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,680
Hello, Mary. I'm Aunt Helen.

627
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,639
You are not! I don't want another mother!

628
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,565
I don't want another mother!

629
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,523
Frank, I think I'm ready
for that drink now.

630
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:07,105
Mike, you think you can handle the bar?

631
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,157
What would you like, Aunt Helen?

632
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,363
I'd like a light screwdriver, please.
Very light.

633
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,447
That's orange juice with a shot of vodka.

634
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,375
- I know, Dad.
- I'm sorry. I'll have Scotch and water.

635
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,002
I know, Dad.

636
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,875
I keep forgetting Mike is 18.

637
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,502
Frank, do you really think it was
a good idea, my coming here?

638
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,840
Of course. If you hadn't,
you might have been hit by a truck.

639
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,007
Everything's gonna be all right.

640
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,474
You're sitting on my painting!

641
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,435
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

642
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,643
It's all right.

643
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,757
- You wanna fill that with orange juice?
- Who's it for?

644
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,047
- Aunt Helen.
- Mike, these are finished.

645
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,842
Susan's gonna help you.

646
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,632
Susie, take these in there, will you?
Thank you.

647
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,969
Okay, I'm gonna put these on the table.

648
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,859
Hey, Rusty.

649
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:37,114
- You wanna be a cocktail waitress?
- All right. Which is which?

650
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,703
Aunt Helen, Uncle Daddy.

651
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,063
- What's this?
- An alligator.

652
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,150
- A flying alligator?
- See the two little babies?

653
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,854
Two little babies.
And these are from Mars, I suppose.

654
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,566
They're very good. Oh, thank you. Rusty?

655
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,570
Hold it, Susan.

656
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,201
How about a toast to our guest, everybody.

657
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:23,746
Through the teeth and over the gums.
Look out, stomach, here it comes.

658
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,457
Hold the Dylan Thomas till later, Greg.

659
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,955
To our charming dinner guest...

660
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,299
- ...welcome aboard.
- Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,785
It's delicious.

662
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:10,590
That's just wonderful.
And where was Veronica born?

663
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,417
- In Japan.
- In Japan.

664
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:17,005
I call her my little fortune cookie
because she came right after dinner.

665
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,766
That's funny.

666
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,565
Where's the fire?

667
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,063
Dinner is served.

668
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,565
Oh, dinner is served.

669
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,655
I want you to know Rosemary
and Louise cooked this dinner.

670
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:40,153
Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
That's absolutely wonderful, Rosemary.

671
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,033
- I'm Susan.
- Oh, of course you are.

672
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,872
- And don't you ever change, honey.
- Let's go, Susan.

673
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,374
You have a wonderful family.

674
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,046
They're all just wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.

675
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,543
Wonderful, wonderful, beautiful children.

676
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,048
Just so wonderful.

677
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,845
Watch that first step. That's a dilly.

678
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,092
Greg, will you hold
the chair for our guest?

679
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,597
Sure.

680
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,264
Thank you, Greg.

681
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,560
Thank you, Greg.

682
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,940
- I'm hungry!
- Veronica.

683
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,152
Bless us, O Lord...

684
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,031
Pardon me.

685
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,323
And these, thy gifts,
which we are about to receive...

686
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,457
Pardon me.

687
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,378
From thy bounty through Christ our Lord.

688
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,211
Amen.

689
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:42,218
- You all right?
- Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

690
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,260
I'm hungry. Can I have a potato?

691
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,356
Pass it around.

692
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,113
- I'm hungry!
- I want some bread.

693
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,451
- Hey, come on, I want the bread.
- Can I have some milk?

694
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,991
Here, want some milk?

695
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,875
I can do it myself.

696
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,163
Sure, you can do it yourself.
Certainly you can.

697
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,832
Sure you can.

698
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,422
Boy, is it warm in here!
Don't you think it's warm in here?

699
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,467
- Want some potatoes?
- Yes.

700
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,180
There we go.

701
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,673
- You want some potatoes?
- Okay.

702
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,634
- Okay, there you are.
- Hey! You got it on my dress!

703
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,814
I'm...

704
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,318
Oh, good heavens!

705
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,412
Oh, I'm so...

706
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:53,158
I'm sorry, honey. Oh, I'm so sorry. I...

707
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,418
Rosemary, help Veronica get cleaned up.

708
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,424
- I didn't mean it.
- I'll clean her up.

709
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,174
I'm sorry.

710
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

711
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,844
What a terrible thing to do.

712
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,598
I'm...

713
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,688
I'm sorry.

714
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,364
Dick, I feel sick again.

715
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,569
- It's Frank.
- Oh, Lord, what have I done?

716
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,784
- You haven't done anything.
- Yes, I have.

717
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,528
I've fallen in love,
that's what I've done.

718
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,243
I promised myself
I'd never fall in love again.

719
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,125
And I wanted to make such
a good impression on you...

720
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,880
and your children, and now
I've been acting like an idiot.

721
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,759
And I don't know why.

722
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:46,419
I don't know why.

723
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,843
I just feel...

724
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,385
Oh, if this damn room would stop
rolling around, maybe I could find...

725
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,684
- ...someplace to be sick.
- Louise...

726
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,271
you better show Mrs. North
the bathroom and help her.

727
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,481
- This way.
- I don't know why.

728
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:01,941
I don't know why.

729
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,328
The court of inquiry is now in session.

730
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:35,975
You didn't have to wait dinner for me.

731
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,934
We've decided to use our company manners.

732
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:42,442
Helen, the boys have
something to tell you.

733
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,610
Mrs. North, I apologise for putting
all that gin in your drink.

734
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,534
Oh, that's what did it.

735
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:51,861
And I apologise for all that vodka.

736
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,616
And I apologise for the Scotch.

737
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,951
Scotch, vodka and...

738
00:54:57,126 --> 00:55:00,080
Helen, you've been the victim
of an alcoholic Pearl Harbor.

739
00:55:00,254 --> 00:55:02,212
It's amazing you survived at all.

740
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,458
Your bartenders will be dealt with later.

741
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,840
Oh, please.
Please, Frank, don't blame them.

742
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:08,671
At least what they did was honest.

743
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:12,262
They don't want another mother,
and I don't blame them.

744
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,881
And you, Frank...

745
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,598
Frank, I think you should
be on your ship at sea.

746
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,598
That's where you belong.

747
00:55:19,273 --> 00:55:21,943
And if the children don't
want me, I understand.

748
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,269
Now, hear this.

749
00:55:24,445 --> 00:55:28,739
My interest in you has nothing to do
with securing a mother for my children.

750
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,865
They don't deserve anyone as good as you.

751
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:34,486
Furthermore, I have no desire
to go back to sea.

752
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,949
In fact, if you'll have me, Helen...

753
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,202
I'll be happy to remain ashore forever...

754
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,169
because I happen to love you.

755
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,876
And nobody put anything in my drink.

756
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:47,920
- Frank, do you mean that?
- Of course I mean it.

757
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,715
That's why I said it in front
of so many witnesses...

758
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:53,095
untrustworthy though they may be.

759
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,303
Oh, Frank.

760
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,108
I give it six months.

761
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,467
<i>It was a typical wedding.</i>

762
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:39,010
<i>Enemies of the bride on the right,
enemies of the groom on the left.</i>

763
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:42,140
<i>I've seen firing squads
with more compassion.</i>

764
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,272
<i>When I saw all the children lined up...</i>

765
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:48,190
<i>I wondered if Frank and I really
had the right to do this to them.</i>

766
00:56:48,362 --> 00:56:52,656
<i>All you had to do was look at those
faces to guess what they were thinking.</i>

767
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:54,818
<i>All those photographers outside...</i>

768
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,445
<i>they're gonna plaster our pictures
all over the newspapers and TV.</i>

769
00:56:58,622 --> 00:57:01,244
<i>We won't be a family,
we're going to be a freak show.</i>

770
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:05,201
<i>When the kids at school find out
about this, I'm gonna kill myself.</i>

771
00:57:05,379 --> 00:57:07,206
<i>I wonder why they're getting married.</i>

772
00:57:07,381 --> 00:57:10,715
<i>Can there possibly be a physical thing
between them too?</i>

773
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,924
<i>At their age?</i>

774
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,433
<i>She has mean eyes.</i>

775
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,845
<i>How can I do it to them?
How can I do it to Frank?</i>

776
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,480
<i>All I have to do is be very calm,
turn around and run.</i>

777
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:28,271
<i>On your mark, get set...</i>

778
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:30,021
Helen.

779
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:37,033
Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead.

780
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,609
- Here.
- What do you do with this?

781
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,692
Throw it, stupid.

782
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:19,823
Hey!

783
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:31,916
Cut it out!

784
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:42,884
The snow came a little early this year.

785
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:49,607
He started it!

786
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:54,394
That's no way to act at a wedding.
That's not nice!

787
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:56,730
Don't worry.
We'll take care of the children.

788
00:58:56,907 --> 00:58:59,612
- Sure. Even if it kills us.
- It's only for the weekend.

789
00:58:59,785 --> 00:59:02,276
We'll be back Monday. Goodbye, Janette.

790
00:59:02,454 --> 00:59:04,079
- Goodbye, Mommy.
- Be a good girl.

791
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:05,872
- Goodbye, Tommy.
- See you.

792
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,416
Goodbye, Greg.

793
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:09,287
Goodbye, Mike.

794
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:14,125
Goodbye, Jean.

795
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:16,672
Goodbye, Veronica. Goodbye, Mary.

796
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,631
Goodbye, Louise. Bye, Jean.

797
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:21,252
You already kissed me.

798
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:22,594
Oh, I'm sorry.

799
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:26,100
By the time they finish saying goodbye,
the honeymoon will be over.

800
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,476
Goodbye, Colleen.
Take care of the little ones.

801
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,220
Goodbye, Phillip. What's that?

802
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,728
Nothing.

803
00:59:34,194 --> 00:59:35,605
Maybe pneumonia.

804
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:37,855
Oh, good heavens. Frank. Frank?

805
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:40,439
Frank, tell me if you
think he has a fever.

806
00:59:40,742 --> 00:59:42,652
I do it back here.

807
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:44,322
- He might.
- Oh, dear.

808
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:48,281
- Do I have to go to school?
- Frank, I can't leave if Phillip's sick.

809
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:52,752
Never in our entire married life will all
of our kids be healthy at the same time.

810
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,626
But last year he had asthma.
His lungs haven't been too...

811
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:58,290
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong with Phillip.

812
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:00,924
Get him to bed. Call the doctor.
We'll phone you...

813
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:03,801
soon as we check
into our hospital. I mean, our hotel.

814
01:00:03,974 --> 01:00:07,924
If it's the flu, call me right away. If it's
anything more serious, I'll call you.

815
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:11,768
No, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't know.
Well, I better call you every hour.

816
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,894
Make him stay in bed,
and until you're sure what he has...

817
01:00:15,068 --> 01:00:17,227
keep the other children out of the room.

818
01:00:17,404 --> 01:00:20,939
Be sure and tell the doctor
that he's allergic to penicillin...

819
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:23,654
all of the sulphas and some of the mycins.

820
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:27,030
- Also tell him that last year he had...
- Helen.

821
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:29,198
We'll go away some other time.

822
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:32,281
Oh, Frank, thank you.

823
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:46,802
<i>I thought I saw the house cringe
as we drove up.</i>

824
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,842
<i>It had been a dignified old Victorian
home when Frank and I found it.</i>

825
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:54,141
<i>The only one large enough
that we could afford.</i>

826
01:00:54,316 --> 01:00:57,436
<i>The plumbing wasn't the most modern,
the roof had to be repaired.</i>

827
01:00:57,611 --> 01:01:01,822
<i>But we had both fallen in love with it
when we learned it had four bathrooms.</i>

828
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:13,121
<i>So in we marched: The bride, the groom...</i>

829
01:01:13,293 --> 01:01:15,333
<i>one bottle of champagne...</i>

830
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:17,829
<i>And 16 children.</i>

831
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:24,052
Come on, darling, finish your tea.
Mother's tired and wants to go to bed.

832
01:01:26,556 --> 01:01:28,348
Now, is there anything else you want?

833
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,509
Yeah, I wanna go home.

834
01:01:30,685 --> 01:01:33,011
We are home, dear.
This is where we live now.

835
01:01:33,188 --> 01:01:36,142
Then why can't I be Phillip anymore?

836
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:38,059
Well, who says you can't be?

837
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:40,108
That man.

838
01:01:42,113 --> 01:01:43,857
- Frank?
- Yes.

839
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:46,274
And he says my name is 12-Blue-D.

840
01:01:46,451 --> 01:01:50,579
And if I forget I'm 12-Blue-D,
I can't get into the bathroom.

841
01:01:50,747 --> 01:01:55,243
Well, now, that's nothing
to be upset about, darling.

842
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:58,205
That's just a system
that he learned in the Navy.

843
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,004
Now, you stop worrying.

844
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:03,507
I'm going to find out what's keeping
that doctor. You stay in bed.

845
01:02:04,594 --> 01:02:08,426
There you are, Janette. You are 8-Red-B.

846
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:13,893
And, Mary, you are 14-Red-C.

847
01:02:14,062 --> 01:02:16,351
- Veronica.
- What am I, again?

848
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:17,554
You're 14-Red-C.

849
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:20,567
Everybody's got a number
from the oldest to the youngest.

850
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:23,736
All the bathrooms are a colour,
all the bedrooms are a letter.

851
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:28,152
And that makes you number 14,
bathroom Red and room C.

852
01:02:28,326 --> 01:02:30,651
And this chart shows you where it all is.

853
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:32,537
Could you just point?

854
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:35,078
It's right around the corner,
down the hall, love.

855
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,281
Thank you.

856
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:40,160
And, Veronica, you are 13-Red-A.

857
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:41,880
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

858
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,088
Well, skipper, how goes the battle?

859
01:02:44,259 --> 01:02:46,666
They're fighting it,
but you can't beat the system.

860
01:02:46,845 --> 01:02:50,842
- I'm sorry if I upset your wedding night.
- I thought it was yours too.

861
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:53,471
I didn't wanna sound anxious.

862
01:02:53,643 --> 01:02:56,561
Susan, you are 9-Red-A.

863
01:02:56,729 --> 01:02:58,722
If I can find it.

864
01:02:58,898 --> 01:03:00,274
Champagne iced?

865
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:03,526
Yes, it's in our bedroom,
in a shiny new bucket.

866
01:03:03,695 --> 01:03:07,111
- Louise, you are 7-Red-C.
- All right.

867
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:10,615
If we stay on schedule, my system
will have these kids bedded down...

868
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:13,572
in a half-hour, and it's our turn next.

869
01:03:13,746 --> 01:03:16,119
Greg, you are 6-Blue-B.

870
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:19,375
Aye, aye, sir.
I'll send up a flare if I get lost.

871
01:03:19,544 --> 01:03:21,702
- How's Phillip?
- That's what I'd like to know.

872
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,205
- What's keeping that doctor?
- Probably the rain.

873
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:27,003
Tommy, you are 10-Blue-D.

874
01:03:27,176 --> 01:03:29,667
Why can't I have my own room
to myself, like Mike?

875
01:03:29,846 --> 01:03:31,174
You're not the oldest. Next.

876
01:03:31,347 --> 01:03:33,803
You mean because I'm not in your family.

877
01:03:33,975 --> 01:03:36,133
- Tommy!
- Now, look, you're all in my family.

878
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:39,929
You have a beautiful room, D. It's
around the corner, down the main hall.

879
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:41,897
Honey, wait. That's where Phillip is.

880
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:43,229
- Phillip?
- Yes.

881
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:45,109
Yes, number 12. You're right.

882
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:47,769
I know he has the flu.
No one should sleep in there.

883
01:03:47,947 --> 01:03:49,607
That's the beauty of this system.

884
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,740
It can be changed in an instant.

885
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,700
All right, now hear this. Now hear this.

886
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,159
All C's and D's report to the quarterdeck.

887
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:00,332
There's been a slight rearrangement.
It may affect B.

888
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:02,209
Everybody back!

889
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:07,544
All right, lights are out
for a minute. Don't worry...

890
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:10,469
we have some emergency
candles right in here.

891
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,636
- Helen.
- Yes, dear.

892
01:04:15,558 --> 01:04:19,852
Frank, do you think there's a power
failure all over or just in the house?

893
01:04:25,443 --> 01:04:28,776
Greg, take these downstairs.
Get some light downstairs.

894
01:04:32,283 --> 01:04:33,694
Where's 6-Blue-B?

895
01:04:33,868 --> 01:04:36,703
I found my room, but there's rain
coming through the roof.

896
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:39,409
That's not possible.
They just finished re-shingling.

897
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:41,325
Well, they'll finish on Monday.

898
01:04:41,501 --> 01:04:44,170
- I'll go get some pots and pans.
- How old is this house?

899
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:46,045
Never mind. It's gonna be beautiful.

900
01:04:46,214 --> 01:04:49,250
- Take care of the little ones.
- Sister's locked in the bathroom.

901
01:04:49,425 --> 01:04:51,833
- What sister?
- I don't know her name yet.

902
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:56,887
But she can't get out
and we can't get in. And it's my turn.

903
01:05:11,572 --> 01:05:13,731
Oh, my God, I'm too late.

904
01:05:13,908 --> 01:05:16,660
No, doctor, we're not praying.
The lights went out.

905
01:05:16,827 --> 01:05:18,701
Come on in. I'll give you a candle.

906
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:20,991
What happened to the key?

907
01:05:21,165 --> 01:05:24,581
It fell out and the lights went out
and I can't find it.

908
01:05:24,752 --> 01:05:28,251
- Well, light your candle.
- I came in here before the candles.

909
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:34,007
Well, look, I'm gonna pass
you a match through the keyhole.

910
01:05:34,178 --> 01:05:37,214
You light it, find the key
and unlock the door, okay?

911
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,588
Okay.

912
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:41,387
Here comes the match. You see it?

913
01:05:43,437 --> 01:05:45,596
- Got it?
- I got it.

914
01:05:45,898 --> 01:05:47,807
- Well, light it.
- I can't.

915
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:49,015
Why not?

916
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:51,316
Mommy won't let me play with matches.

917
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:54,523
- Helen!
- Yes, dear, I'm coming.

918
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:58,241
Tell her it's all right to light a match,
find the key, open the door.

919
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:00,154
- Who's in there?
- One of yours.

920
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:02,536
The one that's not allowed
to light matches.

921
01:06:02,707 --> 01:06:07,036
Oh, Jean. Jean, darling, it's all right
to light a match this time, sweetheart.

922
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:09,832
All right, show's over.
Everybody back to your room.

923
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:12,247
Go back to your room.
You go back. You go back.

924
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:14,998
- I'm the doctor.
- Hold your candle higher, will you?

925
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:18,262
Jean? Jean, darling.

926
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:23,267
I did it, I did it.

927
01:06:23,436 --> 01:06:25,677
- You certainly did.
- Here's your flashlight.

928
01:06:25,855 --> 01:06:27,479
Now, go to your room, dear.

929
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:32,691
I'm 11-Red-A. I'm 11-Red-A. I'm 11-Red-A.

930
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,439
Concussion?

931
01:06:34,613 --> 01:06:38,825
Oh, no, no. It's not her, it's my...
Our boy Phillip.

932
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:42,029
I don't know whether I'm 14-Red-X or what.

933
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:44,909
How do you get any food around here?

934
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:47,407
What's the name of this organisation?

935
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:50,455
No, I'm sorry it's a little confusing,
but, you see...

936
01:06:50,629 --> 01:06:52,254
we were just married today.

937
01:06:53,424 --> 01:06:57,256
Congratulations. The next
20 years ought to be a lulu.

938
01:06:57,428 --> 01:06:59,835
- It's our room!
- Get out!

939
01:07:00,014 --> 01:07:03,465
Oh, no. You'll have to excuse me.
You go right down there.

940
01:07:05,936 --> 01:07:07,728
You can say that again.

941
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:10,566
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

942
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:12,642
It's our room!

943
01:07:13,694 --> 01:07:15,568
What are you two boys doing in here?

944
01:07:15,738 --> 01:07:17,398
- It's our room.
- Yeah, room B.

945
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:19,447
Janette, Colleen, I'm surprised at you.

946
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:22,534
- Get out of the boys' room this instant.
- But it's our room.

947
01:07:22,703 --> 01:07:24,031
It's on that board!

948
01:07:24,204 --> 01:07:25,912
We're on the board too, you know!

949
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:27,955
Get out of our room!

950
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,622
Hey, knock it off!
What's going on in here?

951
01:07:30,794 --> 01:07:32,205
What is this?

952
01:07:32,379 --> 01:07:36,044
Your blues and greens are wonderful,
but your he's and she's are mixed up.

953
01:07:37,885 --> 01:07:39,842
Thank goodness. Let there be light.

954
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,921
All right, boys, pack your gear together.

955
01:07:42,097 --> 01:07:44,505
We'll straighten this out.
Get your stuff together.

956
01:07:44,683 --> 01:07:47,221
- Girls, come on, get to bed.
- I can't find my pyjamas.

957
01:07:47,394 --> 01:07:50,929
- Well, sleep without them one night.
- I'd rather die.

958
01:07:51,106 --> 01:07:53,597
You don't care what happens
to our family, do you?

959
01:07:53,776 --> 01:07:56,397
- Colleen.
- Mommy! Mommy!

960
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:59,108
There's a man trying to take
everybody's temperature.

961
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:03,065
- Oh, good heavens.
- All right, come on, let's get organised.

962
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:12,830
Oh, you found him, doctor.

963
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:16,870
No, that's not him. This one
doesn't have a temperature either.

964
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:19,255
But that's Phillip.
He's the one that's sick.

965
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:23,755
Pulse, normal. Blood pressure,
normal. Temperature, 98.6.

966
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:27,181
In medical school,
they told us that means healthy.

967
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:30,311
Phillip.

968
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,314
I feel better now. He's a good doctor.

969
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:39,184
Good news, Mr. Beardsley.
Your son's not sick at all.

970
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:40,940
Oh, great. But keep it quiet.

971
01:08:41,114 --> 01:08:44,199
I'll never get the C's and D's
back into B.

972
01:08:44,868 --> 01:08:46,528
Sorry.

973
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:48,779
Would you do me a favour
and call my wife...

974
01:08:48,956 --> 01:08:51,411
and tell her I'm on the way home?

975
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,991
- Tell her thank you.
- For what?

976
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:55,913
We don't have any children.

977
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:30,486
- Is this the Beardsleys' new house?
- We've come to deliver the babies.

978
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:34,076
Have a heart.

979
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,872
Leave them on somebody else's doorstep.

980
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,508
Here we go.

981
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:47,548
Dad! Dad! Come quick!

982
01:09:47,723 --> 01:09:49,929
They've brought Joan and Germaine home.

983
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,808
Come on. Come on.

984
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:57,179
Joan! Germaine!

985
01:09:57,482 --> 01:09:59,309
Hi, everybody.

986
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,730
It sure was nice of you
to bring them in the rain.

987
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:10,573
Blame your crazy father. He insisted
the family had to be complete tonight.

988
01:10:10,954 --> 01:10:14,240
When he used that Navy voice,
we didn't wanna be court-martialed.

989
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:17,785
They can't argue, and I needed
someone here on my side.

990
01:10:18,003 --> 01:10:20,375
- Let me see that little angel.
- Bye-bye.

991
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:23,998
- We'll bring their things in the morning.
- Thank you, Nancy. Good night.

992
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:26,417
Good night, Helen. Good luck, Frank.

993
01:10:26,595 --> 01:10:28,587
What a little doll.

994
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:32,213
Well, Murderers' Row is now complete.

995
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:36,093
- Can I hold my sister?
- Let's get one thing straight.

996
01:10:36,271 --> 01:10:39,058
There's no more "mine"
and there's no more "yours."

997
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:42,435
From now on,
everyone and everything is ours.

998
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:45,691
All right, troop, to bed, to bed.

999
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:50,114
- Is this our house now?
- Yes, dear.

1000
01:10:50,285 --> 01:10:52,823
Can we invite some friends over?

1001
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:22,640
Mrs. Beardsley.

1002
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:29,812
Hey, you look beautiful.

1003
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:33,989
- You mean for a mother of 18?
- I mean for a bride.

1004
01:11:48,218 --> 01:11:52,465
Frank, this is gonna sound silly,
but you know something?

1005
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:56,008
- I'm nervous.
- You know something? So am I.

1006
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:04,186
What did that girl say about you?
You are a tiger.

1007
01:12:06,444 --> 01:12:10,987
A slightly grey, slightly middle-aged,
but very much in love tiger.

1008
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,745
Oh, Frank. Frank, do you think
it can work out?

1009
01:12:16,913 --> 01:12:19,914
Will we ever, ever really be
just one family?

1010
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:25,160
Of course, but it's up to you and me
to set an example...

1011
01:12:25,338 --> 01:12:28,837
tonight, in togetherness.

1012
01:12:38,309 --> 01:12:40,101
There's rain coming in our room.

1013
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,677
- Can we sleep here?
- Please?

1014
01:12:49,195 --> 01:12:52,398
Hey. I'm not gonna sleep
in that big room all alone...

1015
01:12:52,573 --> 01:12:54,732
if I'm not even sick.

1016
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,256
Togetherness.

1017
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:16,387
<i>Every morning at four bells,
our day began.</i>

1018
01:13:16,555 --> 01:13:19,342
<i>After all, running a family
of 18 children isn't simple...</i>

1019
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:23,217
<i>but it can be done.
The secret is organisation.</i>

1020
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:26,230
<i>A job for everyone
and everyone on the job.</i>

1021
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:29,601
<i>I was always the first one
to spring into action.</i>

1022
01:13:41,413 --> 01:13:45,790
<i>Mutiny was simply not tolerated.
My crew grumbled but obeyed.</i>

1023
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:49,245
<i>They knew their captain only did what
was best for all.</i>

1024
01:13:49,421 --> 01:13:53,004
<i>Up anchor, man the mizzen,
fire when ready.</i>

1025
01:14:00,682 --> 01:14:02,591
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

1026
01:14:04,603 --> 01:14:06,975
<i>Tommy's job was to check
the weather report...</i>

1027
01:14:07,147 --> 01:14:09,554
<i>to determine the uniform of the day.</i>

1028
01:14:09,733 --> 01:14:11,975
Twenty percent chance of rain.

1029
01:14:15,655 --> 01:14:18,229
<i>My job was to brush my teeth.</i>

1030
01:14:19,826 --> 01:14:21,866
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

1031
01:14:43,475 --> 01:14:47,307
<i>Maybe if he'd helped me sooner,
they wouldn't be falling out.</i>

1032
01:14:48,021 --> 01:14:51,105
<i>Even without teeth,
breakfast at the Beardsleys' included...</i>

1033
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:53,183
<i>5 pounds of bacon...</i>

1034
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,395
<i>2 gallons of oatmeal...</i>

1035
01:14:56,988 --> 01:14:58,780
<i>three dozen eggs...</i>

1036
01:15:04,412 --> 01:15:07,781
<i>and 40 pieces of toast, unless I missed.</i>

1037
01:15:09,793 --> 01:15:12,331
<i>And that was only to hold them
until lunch.</i>

1038
01:15:12,545 --> 01:15:15,250
<i>Which they couldn't prepare
without the old skipper.</i>

1039
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:20,299
<i>After 20 happy years in the Navy,
I had at least learned how to deal.</i>

1040
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:49,032
<i>Breakfast was the best meal of the day,
if you had long arms.</i>

1041
01:15:49,874 --> 01:15:53,077
<i>I don't care much for eggs anyway.</i>

1042
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:01,505
<i>And I can live without bacon if I have to.</i>

1043
01:16:02,303 --> 01:16:04,711
<i>Although some people are pigs about it.</i>

1044
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:10,927
<i>But if a fellow can't even have a piece
of toast, he's finished.</i>

1045
01:16:11,104 --> 01:16:13,346
<i>I could starve to death
right at this table...</i>

1046
01:16:13,523 --> 01:16:15,765
<i>and nobody would even stop eating.</i>

1047
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:20,940
- School bus is coming.
- Get your rain boots on!

1048
01:16:27,704 --> 01:16:30,989
Phillip, stop dawdling.
Now, come on, dear.

1049
01:16:31,165 --> 01:16:35,578
<i>There was nothing else to do.
I had to invent the oatmeal sandwich.</i>

1050
01:16:37,171 --> 01:16:38,500
Come on, Phillip.

1051
01:16:38,673 --> 01:16:41,543
<i>This is where my system proved
so valuable.</i>

1052
01:16:41,718 --> 01:16:45,846
<i>The rain boots were all in one closet,
where they could be reached instantly.</i>

1053
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:50,058
<i>We had learned to buy boots and shoes
and clothes in wholesale lots.</i>

1054
01:16:50,226 --> 01:16:53,725
<i>Sizes didn't matter, because eventually
everything fit everybody.</i>

1055
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:56,979
<i>Almost everybody.</i>

1056
01:17:12,206 --> 01:17:14,662
Don't worry, fella, just keep growing.

1057
01:17:14,834 --> 01:17:17,123
Someday you can fill my boots.

1058
01:17:21,424 --> 01:17:23,215
That's my brother.

1059
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:43,810
We got some wild things planned.
You've gotta come. It'll be out of sight.

1060
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:46,027
- Hi, Larry.
- Hey.

1061
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:50,069
The gang is throwing a freak-out
tonight at the beach house.

1062
01:17:50,244 --> 01:17:52,700
Tell your parents we're going to a movie.

1063
01:17:52,872 --> 01:17:54,200
Oh, Larry, I couldn't.

1064
01:17:54,415 --> 01:17:57,831
Here we go again. Why not?

1065
01:17:58,044 --> 01:18:01,578
- I heard about those parties.
- I can't wait to find out if it's true.

1066
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:03,624
Well, I'm not going.

1067
01:18:03,799 --> 01:18:06,125
- You are unbelievable.
- I am?

1068
01:18:06,302 --> 01:18:08,176
It's that ridiculous family of yours.

1069
01:18:08,346 --> 01:18:11,050
You're medieval.
You're so hung up, it's pathetic.

1070
01:18:11,223 --> 01:18:13,097
Do you know what you are? A sex maniac.

1071
01:18:13,309 --> 01:18:17,722
If I'm a sex maniac, I'm the most
frustrated sex maniac in the world.

1072
01:18:17,897 --> 01:18:21,432
- And I'm almost out of high school!
- Big deal!

1073
01:18:30,242 --> 01:18:32,449
That's fine. All right, children...

1074
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:36,487
finish up your problems
and bring in your papers.

1075
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:49,084
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Phillip.

1076
01:18:50,304 --> 01:18:52,462
You didn't sign your paper properly.

1077
01:18:52,681 --> 01:18:55,766
- Your name is Phillip North.
- I'm Phillip Beardsley.

1078
01:18:55,935 --> 01:18:58,426
We all went to church
and we were all married.

1079
01:18:58,604 --> 01:19:01,890
- I'm Phillip Beardsley.
- No, dear, not legally...

1080
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:05,933
and we must sign our legal names
in school, mustn't we?

1081
01:19:06,153 --> 01:19:08,858
- Beardsley.
- No, dear, North.

1082
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:12,649
- North! North! North!
- Beardsley! Beardsley! Beardsley!

1083
01:19:35,766 --> 01:19:39,100
I got here as fast as I could,
Sister Mary. What is it this time?

1084
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,013
Why don't you ask Phillip.

1085
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,148
Phillip.

1086
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:49,481
- Darling, what happened?
- Nothing.

1087
01:19:49,655 --> 01:19:52,572
- Who did that to you?
- One of the kids.

1088
01:19:52,741 --> 01:19:54,615
She started it.

1089
01:19:55,077 --> 01:19:58,493
- She says I'm not legal.
- What?

1090
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:02,786
- And Mike isn't my brother.
- Of course he's your brother.

1091
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,961
- Then my name is Phillip Beardsley.
- Phillip North.

1092
01:20:07,172 --> 01:20:09,212
There she goes again.

1093
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:16,470
Sister, couldn't you just call him
Phillip Beardsley?

1094
01:20:16,682 --> 01:20:21,095
I'm sorry, but the school requires
that we use their legal names.

1095
01:20:21,311 --> 01:20:23,351
Let's go to another school.

1096
01:20:25,107 --> 01:20:30,101
I understand your legal problem,
but you must try to understand mine.

1097
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:34,739
You see, I'm trying to bring
two families together...

1098
01:20:35,784 --> 01:20:39,948
and this is the first sign
that I may be succeeding.

1099
01:20:40,122 --> 01:20:43,906
I really would appreciate it if you'd let
Phillip sign his name Beardsley.

1100
01:20:44,126 --> 01:20:46,451
But legally it's North.

1101
01:20:48,046 --> 01:20:51,996
But it's more important
that emotionally it's Beardsley.

1102
01:20:52,843 --> 01:20:54,836
North.

1103
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:57,763
- Beardsley.
- North.

1104
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:01,474
Beardsley! Beardsley! Beardsley!

1105
01:21:01,685 --> 01:21:03,725
Watch out, Mom. You might get a black eye.

1106
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:12,102
You mean, I adopt your children
and you want to adopt mine?

1107
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:15,482
Yes, that way we'll really be one family.

1108
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:18,731
Your children will have a mother,
legally...

1109
01:21:18,911 --> 01:21:23,039
and mine will have a father, legally.
That way they'll be protected.

1110
01:21:23,207 --> 01:21:27,453
You know, in case anything should
happen to either one of us.

1111
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,461
- Strawberry or raspberry?
- Apricot.

1112
01:21:34,676 --> 01:21:39,422
Do you know that in California
it costs $250 just to adopt one child?

1113
01:21:39,598 --> 01:21:42,219
- Really?
- That's a lot of money for a formality.

1114
01:21:42,434 --> 01:21:44,890
A black eye isn't a formality.

1115
01:21:47,397 --> 01:21:49,437
- How much milk?
- Twenty quarts.

1116
01:21:49,691 --> 01:21:52,858
Sixteen, 18, 20.

1117
01:21:53,028 --> 01:21:55,104
What we ought to adopt is a cow.

1118
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:59,277
These are for Dad.

1119
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:12,873
Two hundred and fifty times 18 is $4500.

1120
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:16,883
- How did you figure that out so fast?
- Sheer panic.

1121
01:22:17,094 --> 01:22:18,837
Well, hello, Mr. Beardsley.

1122
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:21,135
Should I wrap it,
or you gonna eat it here?

1123
01:22:21,348 --> 01:22:24,100
All right, Harry,
just call out the reserves.

1124
01:22:24,309 --> 01:22:27,678
Dave, Jack, it's an emergency.
The Beardsleys are here. More boxes.

1125
01:22:27,896 --> 01:22:31,063
Frank, you know what I'd like
for Christmas?

1126
01:22:31,233 --> 01:22:32,857
- What?
- Don't buy me anything.

1127
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:36,231
The most expensive gift in the world
is when a wife says:

1128
01:22:36,404 --> 01:22:39,773
- "Don't buy me anything."
- Look, if we didn't...

1129
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:43,650
give each other Christmas gifts,
and if we didn't get the new car...

1130
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:46,201
and we cut down
on all the little things...

1131
01:22:46,373 --> 01:22:50,287
the things we don't really need,
the little luxuries...

1132
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,165
couldn't we afford to adopt our kids?

1133
01:22:59,928 --> 01:23:03,878
Thank you, Dad. Would you put these
back there, please?

1134
01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:25,030
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1135
01:23:34,796 --> 01:23:36,374
Would you care to check it?

1136
01:23:42,511 --> 01:23:45,595
How could you decide something
like that without asking us?

1137
01:23:46,265 --> 01:23:49,681
Colleen, we thought you children
would be happy to be adopted.

1138
01:23:49,893 --> 01:23:52,431
Happy to forget our real father's name?

1139
01:23:52,604 --> 01:23:56,436
- Get lost in a jungle full of Beardsleys?
- Now, just a minute.

1140
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:59,853
Mother, that's the most awful thing
I've ever heard.

1141
01:24:00,028 --> 01:24:02,519
He's gone a year,
and you're trying to wipe him...

1142
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:04,904
out of your life as if he never existed.

1143
01:24:05,534 --> 01:24:07,823
And I thought you loved him.

1144
01:24:21,008 --> 01:24:23,629
- I like Beardsley.
- You be quiet!

1145
01:24:23,802 --> 01:24:27,670
- And no, I don't want any dessert.
- I'll take his.

1146
01:24:30,976 --> 01:24:33,930
Sorry, I didn't think I was
committing a federal offence.

1147
01:24:34,104 --> 01:24:36,097
Thought they'd want me for a father.

1148
01:24:36,315 --> 01:24:38,603
Yeah, well, now you know
what they think of you.

1149
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:41,313
Stay out of it. It's their problem.

1150
01:24:41,528 --> 01:24:44,695
Now, wait a minute, Rosemary.
It's not just their problem.

1151
01:24:44,865 --> 01:24:47,819
I was planning on adopting
all you children too.

1152
01:24:48,035 --> 01:24:50,241
- Was that part of the deal?
- Yes.

1153
01:24:50,412 --> 01:24:54,410
I thought everybody understood that.
We want this to be one family.

1154
01:24:55,792 --> 01:24:57,370
Excuse me.

1155
01:24:59,254 --> 01:25:02,588
- What's the matter with him?
- What do you think?

1156
01:25:02,758 --> 01:25:04,252
I gotta do my homework.

1157
01:25:06,053 --> 01:25:09,007
Homework? He's really shook.

1158
01:25:09,306 --> 01:25:11,133
Why shouldn't he be?

1159
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,968
We loved our mother just as much
as they loved their father.

1160
01:25:15,145 --> 01:25:17,054
I know that, Rosemary.

1161
01:25:17,272 --> 01:25:19,514
And now you're asking us
to bury her again?

1162
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:21,399
Who's getting buried?

1163
01:25:22,277 --> 01:25:26,227
- Come on, we'll get you washed.
- Excuse me.

1164
01:25:27,366 --> 01:25:30,402
I can't eat if everybody's gonna cry!

1165
01:25:35,165 --> 01:25:38,249
Frank, how could we have been so wrong?

1166
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:41,918
- I feel like a murderer.
- Merry Christmas, everybody!

1167
01:25:43,465 --> 01:25:45,956
Merry, merry, merry...

1168
01:25:49,554 --> 01:25:51,214
Merry.

1169
01:25:52,182 --> 01:25:53,724
What a let-down.

1170
01:25:54,101 --> 01:25:57,220
I walked in here,
full of the old Christmas spirit...

1171
01:25:57,395 --> 01:26:00,313
ready to tell you the good news,
and it's a disaster area.

1172
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:02,973
What's the good news?
I could use some right now.

1173
01:26:03,151 --> 01:26:05,025
- Didn't Frank tell you?
- No.

1174
01:26:05,195 --> 01:26:07,353
Didn't you know you married Edison,
the man?

1175
01:26:07,531 --> 01:26:10,069
- I am?
- That Fresnel-lens landing system...

1176
01:26:10,242 --> 01:26:13,112
Frank and I worked on
has been accepted by the Navy.

1177
01:26:13,286 --> 01:26:16,572
- Frank, that's wonderful!
- It's only been accepted for testing.

1178
01:26:16,748 --> 01:26:19,120
Well, it's going on shake-down
on the Big E.

1179
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:21,664
- Hey, that's cool.
- When are you taking it out?

1180
01:26:21,837 --> 01:26:23,461
I'm not taking it out.

1181
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:27,295
Since your father is anchored here,
I volunteered to handle it for him.

1182
01:26:27,509 --> 01:26:29,834
But, Dad,
how come you're not taking it out?

1183
01:26:30,011 --> 01:26:33,096
It just might be I felt it wasn't right
to leave my family.

1184
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,596
But a shake-down,
that's only a couple of weeks.

1185
01:26:37,102 --> 01:26:38,596
You always used to.

1186
01:26:38,812 --> 01:26:41,599
- Well, things are a little different now.
- That stinks.

1187
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:44,727
- That really stinks.
- I'd rather not talk about it, okay?

1188
01:26:46,653 --> 01:26:48,610
Big mouth.

1189
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,784
- Frank.
- You really sank the Navy, didn't you?

1190
01:27:09,634 --> 01:27:11,426
- Frank.
- Yeah?

1191
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:14,512
You really do wanna go to sea again,
don't you?

1192
01:27:15,432 --> 01:27:19,346
I'm not going to pretend.
There's no halo on me.

1193
01:27:19,519 --> 01:27:22,010
Sure, I suppose I'm a little envious
of Darrell.

1194
01:27:22,188 --> 01:27:26,897
But when I signed on for this cruise,
I knew it was for the duration.

1195
01:27:27,193 --> 01:27:30,479
You make me feel as if I'm World War III.

1196
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:32,066
Well, you shouldn't.

1197
01:27:33,158 --> 01:27:36,527
Helen, I want you to know something,
if you don't already know it.

1198
01:27:36,703 --> 01:27:39,408
I'm happier than I've ever been
in my life.

1199
01:27:39,581 --> 01:27:42,119
I've already gotten
what I want for Christmas.

1200
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:43,834
Thank you.

1201
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,003
- I'm glad you adopted me.
- So am I.

1202
01:28:05,023 --> 01:28:08,107
He's been here! He's been here!
Santa Claus has been here!

1203
01:28:08,276 --> 01:28:10,767
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.

1204
01:28:10,945 --> 01:28:14,694
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.

1205
01:28:14,866 --> 01:28:16,693
- Santa Claus!
- Let me out!

1206
01:28:16,868 --> 01:28:19,655
Get out! Let me get to the Christmas tree!

1207
01:28:19,829 --> 01:28:22,118
Let me out!
I wanna get to the Christmas tree!

1208
01:28:32,383 --> 01:28:36,381
Frank! Frank, where are you?
You're missing Christmas!

1209
01:28:36,971 --> 01:28:38,430
Frank!

1210
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:43,554
Frank! Where are you?
You're missing everything.

1211
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:49,108
Frank, you're missing it! Where are you?

1212
01:28:56,616 --> 01:28:58,858
Frank, what are you doing in here?

1213
01:28:59,035 --> 01:29:02,202
- I'm an elf.
- But you haven't been to bed at all.

1214
01:29:02,372 --> 01:29:06,120
I've had six scooters, three wagons,
a fire engine. This is the last bicycle.

1215
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:09,542
- General Motors couldn't have kept up.
- Well, hurry up, dear.

1216
01:29:11,923 --> 01:29:14,496
Does anybody know where
the package is for your dad?

1217
01:29:14,675 --> 01:29:17,167
- The red- and-white package.
- Here it is!

1218
01:29:17,345 --> 01:29:21,010
- Oh, thank you, darling. Thank you.
- Hey, what do you know?

1219
01:29:21,182 --> 01:29:24,633
Santa Claus brought so many presents
he had to leave some in the closet.

1220
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:27,183
Does it have my name on it?
For Phillip North?

1221
01:29:27,355 --> 01:29:30,060
I wrote him my legal name.
I didn't want any trouble.

1222
01:29:30,233 --> 01:29:32,439
Let's see, it says
" Phillip North Beardsley."

1223
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:35,979
- That takes care of the situation.
- Oh, boy!

1224
01:29:42,453 --> 01:29:45,123
It had my name on it, all right.

1225
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:48,118
We'll get an elf over here
to fix it up. Greg.

1226
01:29:48,292 --> 01:29:50,748
Get off it, darling. He'll fix it.

1227
01:29:51,712 --> 01:29:53,788
- You're not an elf.
- Well, I'm practising.

1228
01:29:53,965 --> 01:29:55,542
All right, come on.

1229
01:29:57,552 --> 01:30:00,671
Frank, this is for you.

1230
01:30:03,558 --> 01:30:05,052
Well, go ahead, open it.

1231
01:30:05,226 --> 01:30:09,271
- Mommy, look what I got!
- That's beautiful, darling.

1232
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:26,071
Susan, don't eat the ornaments
off the tree until later.

1233
01:30:26,247 --> 01:30:29,367
I think Santa Claus made a mistake.
Maybe this is for Tommy, huh?

1234
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:32,163
No, dear, I think this is for you.

1235
01:30:34,171 --> 01:30:36,709
- I don't get it.
- Bon voyage.

1236
01:30:36,882 --> 01:30:38,341
What are you talking about?

1237
01:30:38,509 --> 01:30:41,925
Everybody else got what they really
wanted for Christmas. Why not you?

1238
01:30:42,096 --> 01:30:44,634
- Dad can go on the Enterprise?
- That's great!

1239
01:30:44,807 --> 01:30:47,927
Just a minute. Did it ever occur
to anybody that I might know...

1240
01:30:48,102 --> 01:30:52,052
where my duty lies and prefer
to stay here, look after my family...?

1241
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:55,102
Complain for a few more minutes,
dear, before you agree.

1242
01:30:55,276 --> 01:30:57,731
I'm gonna answer the phone.

1243
01:30:59,572 --> 01:31:02,145
- If she thinks I have any intention of...
- How long?

1244
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:04,151
About six weeks.

1245
01:31:05,786 --> 01:31:08,787
Well, when are we gonna sing
Christmas carols, huh?

1246
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:15,204
Doctor, this is Christmas,
not April Fool. Are you sure?

1247
01:31:15,379 --> 01:31:19,247
My dear Mrs. Beardsley, the reason
I am in my office on Christmas Day...

1248
01:31:19,425 --> 01:31:22,545
is because I wanted
to check the lab report personally.

1249
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,883
You do not have indigestion,
ileitis or diverticulitis.

1250
01:31:27,057 --> 01:31:30,142
<i>What you have is a simple case
of pregnancy.</i>

1251
01:31:30,311 --> 01:31:32,102
<i>P- R-E-G...</i>

1252
01:31:32,271 --> 01:31:35,391
Doctor, if anybody knows
how to spell it, I do.

1253
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:39,484
- Thanks for calling.
- Merry Christmas.

1254
01:31:54,627 --> 01:31:57,378
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

1255
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,827
<i>And so the skipper went back to sea...</i>

1256
01:32:42,006 --> 01:32:44,793
<i>protesting until the ship
was out of hearing.</i>

1257
01:32:48,179 --> 01:32:51,180
<i>Darling, always the same, days speed by...</i>

1258
01:32:51,349 --> 01:32:53,721
<i>but the nights go very slowly.</i>

1259
01:32:53,893 --> 01:32:57,938
<i>You missed a wonderful day today.
Susan stopped eating.</i>

1260
01:32:58,106 --> 01:33:02,933
<i>A boy invited her to her first dance,
and she insisted on buying this dress.</i>

1261
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:04,771
<i>As you can see by the picture...</i>

1262
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:08,065
<i>she's still got a few pounds
to go before Saturday night.</i>

1263
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:11,076
<i>Oh, what we girls go through for our men.</i>

1264
01:33:20,211 --> 01:33:21,753
<i>Dearest mother of 18:</i>

1265
01:33:21,921 --> 01:33:26,215
<i>Military security being what it is,
I can't tell you where we are...</i>

1266
01:33:26,384 --> 01:33:28,957
<i>but the enclosed photograph
of Darrell and me...</i>

1267
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:32,422
<i>may give you some idea. I'm the sexy one.</i>

1268
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:37,351
<i>Mike's letter was from the president
of the United States.</i>

1269
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,975
<i>It said, "Greetings..."</i>

1270
01:33:43,442 --> 01:33:46,693
Deep breath. Hold it. Exhale.

1271
01:33:46,862 --> 01:33:48,405
That's fine, son. Name.

1272
01:33:48,573 --> 01:33:50,649
- Michael Francis Beardsley.
- Hello, Mike.

1273
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:53,232
Hi, doc. What are you doing
at the draft board?

1274
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:55,984
Sacrificing one afternoon a week
for my country.

1275
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,785
- How's your mother feeling?
- You mean my stepmother.

1276
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:00,832
She's fine, I guess.

1277
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:06,538
- No morning sickness?
- No, doc, I feel fine.

1278
01:34:07,049 --> 01:34:08,508
Not you, your mother.

1279
01:34:08,718 --> 01:34:12,300
Now, why should she have...?
Morning sickness!

1280
01:34:13,055 --> 01:34:16,555
- We need a sample of your blood.
- Take it all.

1281
01:34:20,104 --> 01:34:22,725
Hi, Mike. How did the physical go?

1282
01:34:22,898 --> 01:34:25,983
Well, they took inventory.
I had enough parts.

1283
01:34:26,152 --> 01:34:29,603
Mike, how do you really feel
about the whole thing?

1284
01:34:30,322 --> 01:34:32,362
Yeah, I understand.

1285
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:36,742
Where are the girls? Should you do that?

1286
01:34:36,912 --> 01:34:39,154
Why shouldn't I?
What's the matter with you?

1287
01:34:39,331 --> 01:34:43,032
Nothing with me, but I think
you're out of your mind.

1288
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:46,081
Does it show that much?

1289
01:34:46,255 --> 01:34:48,828
No, but guess who the doctor was
at the draft board.

1290
01:34:49,008 --> 01:34:52,128
Oh, I ought to report him
to the Medical Association.

1291
01:34:52,303 --> 01:34:54,342
No, he's gonna report you.

1292
01:34:55,764 --> 01:34:58,256
Bring that over for me, will you?

1293
01:35:02,271 --> 01:35:05,188
You knew about it Christmas Day,
didn't you?

1294
01:35:05,649 --> 01:35:08,603
- And you still let Dad ship out?
- Yes.

1295
01:35:08,777 --> 01:35:10,153
Why?

1296
01:35:10,321 --> 01:35:12,397
He wanted so much to go.

1297
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:16,238
Two people can't live with an ocean
between them for the rest of their lives.

1298
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:20,075
- If you write him about it, I'll shoot you.
- You would, too.

1299
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:23,332
I'd just as soon he didn't know
about this draft thing either.

1300
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,493
Why not? Can't we tell him anything?

1301
01:35:25,669 --> 01:35:30,082
No, I'm thinking about the Marines.
That would drive him out of his skull.

1302
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,586
Okay.

1303
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:37,506
- Do you really want this baby?
- Very much.

1304
01:35:37,723 --> 01:35:41,887
You see, he won't have to worry
whether he's a Beardsley or a North.

1305
01:35:47,524 --> 01:35:50,728
<i>The Navy, like a woman,
has a way of changing its mind.</i>

1306
01:35:50,903 --> 01:35:55,565
<i>Our short cruise was extended
so often, we lost all track of time...</i>

1307
01:35:55,741 --> 01:35:59,821
<i>until one day when the mail plane
caught up with us.</i>

1308
01:36:06,919 --> 01:36:09,588
- Darrell, we're pregnant!
- We're what?

1309
01:36:09,755 --> 01:36:12,507
Mike's letter! Helen and I,
we're gonna have a baby.

1310
01:36:12,716 --> 01:36:14,543
- Our first.
- Your first? Wait a minute.

1311
01:36:14,718 --> 01:36:17,672
You can't even count. No wonder
it happened. When is she due?

1312
01:36:17,846 --> 01:36:20,337
When is she due?
The idiot, he doesn't say.

1313
01:36:20,516 --> 01:36:22,555
- Oh, no.
- Let me read Helen's letter again.

1314
01:36:22,726 --> 01:36:25,051
- Open some of those for me.
- Yeah, okay.

1315
01:36:25,229 --> 01:36:27,305
Here's one from Mary.
I can tell by the jam.

1316
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,972
- Helen doesn't mention it.
- Phillip gave you a tooth.

1317
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:32,143
Thanks. Colleen's in love.

1318
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:34,988
What, again? Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

1319
01:36:35,155 --> 01:36:38,192
You've had enough training.
Can't you figure out the date?

1320
01:36:38,367 --> 01:36:40,443
It can't be soon. Helen would've told me.

1321
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:42,908
Now, maybe she doesn't
tell you everything.

1322
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,745
Unless Veronica is an impressionist,
number 19 is about to be launched.

1323
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:54,339
I've gotta get on that mail plane
before it takes off.

1324
01:38:07,413 --> 01:38:11,363
<i>Veronica's artistic endeav our
was not quite accurate.</i>

1325
01:38:11,542 --> 01:38:14,211
<i>A month later, we were still waiting
for the stork.</i>

1326
01:38:14,378 --> 01:38:17,747
<i>Every night we would go to bed
wondering if this were D-day.</i>

1327
01:38:17,965 --> 01:38:20,421
<i>Naturally, Helen was the most
nervous of all...</i>

1328
01:38:20,593 --> 01:38:24,175
<i>and it was compounded by
the tension about Mike and the draft.</i>

1329
01:38:24,346 --> 01:38:28,510
<i>She kept getting more excitable,
anxious and emotional.</i>

1330
01:38:28,684 --> 01:38:31,140
<i>Why can't a woman be more like a man?</i>

1331
01:38:32,855 --> 01:38:34,349
- Frank?
- What?

1332
01:38:34,523 --> 01:38:37,097
Don't make so much noise,
you'll wake the children.

1333
01:38:37,276 --> 01:38:39,565
I just want a glass of water.

1334
01:38:41,697 --> 01:38:44,651
- Why are you making that terrible face?
- I have indigestion.

1335
01:38:44,825 --> 01:38:46,699
How often do you have that indigestion?

1336
01:38:46,869 --> 01:38:49,027
- About every 15 minutes.
- That's it!

1337
01:38:49,205 --> 01:38:51,114
Stay calm. Everything's organised.

1338
01:38:53,959 --> 01:38:56,629
Don't worry, everything's...
I've laid it all on.

1339
01:38:56,795 --> 01:38:59,333
Don't rush, now, Frank. I'm all right.

1340
01:38:59,506 --> 01:39:02,424
- There's plenty of time, but hurry!
- We'll get you there.

1341
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:10,098
Stay calm.

1342
01:39:10,267 --> 01:39:12,675
Red alert! Red alert!

1343
01:39:12,895 --> 01:39:15,516
Red alert! Red alert!

1344
01:39:19,068 --> 01:39:21,689
Mike! Get the car out of the garage
and warm it up.

1345
01:39:21,862 --> 01:39:24,649
- Nicky, get her bag, quickly.
- We've done this before.

1346
01:39:24,823 --> 01:39:26,152
Rosemary, Louise, Tommy...

1347
01:39:26,325 --> 01:39:28,697
get blankets and pillows
for the station wagon.

1348
01:39:28,869 --> 01:39:31,360
- Phillip, what are you doing?
- Going to the bathroom.

1349
01:39:31,538 --> 01:39:34,456
- What, is the stork coming?
- Maybe a whole flock of storks.

1350
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:36,534
I never thought of that.

1351
01:39:36,794 --> 01:39:39,581
- Hey, Mike! What...?
- What's happened?

1352
01:39:39,755 --> 01:39:42,293
Hey, stop it! Hey, Mike!

1353
01:39:42,883 --> 01:39:44,342
What is this?

1354
01:39:44,885 --> 01:39:47,341
Will you knock it off. Now, listen...

1355
01:39:47,513 --> 01:39:51,842
Larry, what are you...? Mike! Break
it up. Knock it off. What is all this?

1356
01:39:52,017 --> 01:39:54,140
Larry, why are you in our house
at this hour?

1357
01:39:54,311 --> 01:39:56,636
- Dad, Mom wants you right away.
- Get the car.

1358
01:39:56,814 --> 01:40:00,858
I'm hysterical enough without your
help. What's going on around here?

1359
01:40:01,193 --> 01:40:04,028
Nothing. That's the whole problem
with your daughter.

1360
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:09,279
Mike! Will you cut it out.
Look at you. You two, are you crazy?

1361
01:40:09,451 --> 01:40:11,527
My bike!

1362
01:40:11,703 --> 01:40:13,411
You all right?

1363
01:40:17,084 --> 01:40:19,622
What happened? Hey, man,
don't you know how to drive?

1364
01:40:19,795 --> 01:40:22,582
- Look what you did to my bike.
- My mother's having a baby.

1365
01:40:22,756 --> 01:40:25,674
The bike's jammed under the car.
We may never get it loose.

1366
01:40:25,843 --> 01:40:29,627
Dad! Mom said they're coming
six minutes apart!

1367
01:40:29,847 --> 01:40:32,966
- What are we gonna do?
- Get a crowbar and pry it loose.

1368
01:40:33,141 --> 01:40:36,178
- What?
- Not you!

1369
01:40:39,398 --> 01:40:42,434
- Daddy, can I go to bed now?
- Of course.

1370
01:40:42,609 --> 01:40:46,061
Please, I can't talk to Mother right now.
I've got to talk to somebody.

1371
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:47,649
Well, talk fast.

1372
01:40:47,823 --> 01:40:51,358
Well, Larry says he'll never speak
to me again unless I grow up.

1373
01:40:51,535 --> 01:40:54,904
He says I'm being ridiculous,
and I don't love him. But I do love him.

1374
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,452
- Am I ridiculous?
- You're not being ridiculous.

1375
01:40:57,624 --> 01:41:00,115
Well, do all the other girls,
like Larry says?

1376
01:41:00,294 --> 01:41:02,001
And am I just being old-fashioned?

1377
01:41:02,212 --> 01:41:05,462
The same idiots were passing
the same rumours when I was your age.

1378
01:41:05,716 --> 01:41:09,001
If all girls did, how come I always
ended up with ones who didn't?

1379
01:41:09,177 --> 01:41:10,588
But it's all different now.

1380
01:41:10,762 --> 01:41:14,262
They wrote Fanny Hill in 1742, and they
haven't found anything new since.

1381
01:41:14,433 --> 01:41:18,347
- Who's Fanny Hill?
- Go to bed, that's who Fanny Hill is.

1382
01:41:20,731 --> 01:41:23,815
- Ready, honey?
- Thank you, dear. Oh, boy, am I ready.

1383
01:41:23,984 --> 01:41:26,653
Frank, I think maybe you're
gonna have to help me.

1384
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:29,228
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right, dear.

1385
01:41:31,408 --> 01:41:34,528
I know this is a terrible time
to talk about it, but Larry said...

1386
01:41:34,703 --> 01:41:38,119
I've got a message for Larry.
You tell him this is what it's all about.

1387
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:40,697
- This is the real happening.
- Come on, Tommy.

1388
01:41:40,876 --> 01:41:43,912
If you wanna know what love really is,
take a look around you.

1389
01:41:44,087 --> 01:41:46,792
- What are you talking about?
- Take a look at your mother.

1390
01:41:46,965 --> 01:41:48,424
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

1391
01:41:48,592 --> 01:41:50,383
It's giving life that counts.

1392
01:41:50,552 --> 01:41:53,173
Till you're ready for it,
the rest is just a big fraud.

1393
01:41:53,346 --> 01:41:56,929
All the crazy haircuts in the world
won't keep it turning.

1394
01:41:57,142 --> 01:42:00,392
Life isn't a love-in, it's the dishes
and the orthodontist...

1395
01:42:00,562 --> 01:42:02,436
and the shoe repairman...

1396
01:42:02,606 --> 01:42:04,812
and ground round instead of roast beef.

1397
01:42:04,983 --> 01:42:06,358
I'll tell you something else.

1398
01:42:06,526 --> 01:42:08,815
Going to bed with a man
doesn't prove your love.

1399
01:42:08,987 --> 01:42:12,237
It's getting up in the morning
and facing the drab, miserable...

1400
01:42:12,407 --> 01:42:14,815
wonderful everyday world
with him that counts.

1401
01:42:14,993 --> 01:42:16,867
- Are you all right, Mother?
- Yes, dear.

1402
01:42:17,037 --> 01:42:20,156
- Now, you kids get back to bed. Go on.
- Go to bed.

1403
01:42:20,332 --> 01:42:23,202
- Good night, Mommy.
- Bye, Mommy. Bye.

1404
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,580
You all right?

1405
01:42:27,047 --> 01:42:30,463
I suppose having 19 kids
is carrying it a bit too far.

1406
01:42:30,634 --> 01:42:33,884
But if we had it to do over,
who would we skip? You?

1407
01:42:34,554 --> 01:42:38,054
- All together, now. One, two, three!
- Come on, this is light.

1408
01:42:38,225 --> 01:42:40,680
- You got it out?
- God, that's a heavy bike.

1409
01:42:41,186 --> 01:42:43,511
- Okay, we got it out, Dad.
- Take it easy.

1410
01:42:43,688 --> 01:42:45,348
I'll get your legs.

1411
01:42:47,776 --> 01:42:51,524
Thank you, Frank. I never quite knew
how to explain it to her.

1412
01:42:51,696 --> 01:42:55,990
If we don't get you to the hospital fast,
the rest of it will be explained here.

1413
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:05,285
See you later, Dad.

1414
01:43:08,254 --> 01:43:12,466
- Where's he going?
- Hey, Dad, the hospital is that way!

1415
01:43:19,683 --> 01:43:21,058
- Bye!
- Bye!

1416
01:43:25,814 --> 01:43:28,565
You'd think that was their first one.

1417
01:43:29,067 --> 01:43:32,400
Why don't you get a haircut!

1418
01:43:36,032 --> 01:43:39,567
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank, I'll ask the nurse.

1419
01:43:39,744 --> 01:43:42,947
- They won't let the children in.
- I told you, hospital rules.

1420
01:43:43,123 --> 01:43:45,614
Could you hold him up
to the window so they can see?

1421
01:43:45,792 --> 01:43:48,876
- My husband says they're waiting.
- Of course.

1422
01:43:51,756 --> 01:43:53,250
Is my family out there?

1423
01:43:53,716 --> 01:43:56,883
Not only the family, he must have
brought the whole neighbourhood.

1424
01:43:57,303 --> 01:43:59,545
That neighbourhood is my family.

1425
01:44:00,723 --> 01:44:03,012
Honey, you'd better lie down.

1426
01:44:03,184 --> 01:44:05,758
And if I were you, I wouldn't get up
for three months.

1427
01:44:12,235 --> 01:44:14,109
Is he my brother or your brother?

1428
01:44:14,279 --> 01:44:16,152
He's both our brothers.

1429
01:44:16,322 --> 01:44:20,569
- Even to a nun, like Sister Mary?
- Even to Sister Mary.

1430
01:44:20,743 --> 01:44:23,199
Boy, is he lucky.

1431
01:44:29,043 --> 01:44:32,495
Petitioner Francis Louis Beardsley,
step forward, please.

1432
01:44:39,429 --> 01:44:41,884
You are married to the mother
of these children?

1433
01:44:42,056 --> 01:44:44,382
- Yes, sir.
- Has your wife consented...

1434
01:44:44,559 --> 01:44:48,343
- ...to adoption of the minor children?
- It was her idea.

1435
01:44:48,563 --> 01:44:51,101
If I'm gonna be adopted, why can't I talk?

1436
01:44:51,274 --> 01:44:55,603
Don't question the workings
of a democracy, young man.

1437
01:44:55,862 --> 01:44:58,234
At least until you're 7.

1438
01:45:00,325 --> 01:45:03,491
- Has your wife consented?
- Yes, sir.

1439
01:45:04,078 --> 01:45:07,494
Will you execute an agreement
in the presence of the court...

1440
01:45:07,665 --> 01:45:11,663
that the children shall
be treated in all respects as your...?

1441
01:45:13,671 --> 01:45:15,794
All right. Thank you.

1442
01:45:17,842 --> 01:45:21,792
That the children shall be treated in
every respect as your lawful children...

1443
01:45:21,971 --> 01:45:26,598
and shall hereafter be known
as Colleen Marie Beardsley...

1444
01:45:26,768 --> 01:45:29,472
Janette Dean Beardsley...

1445
01:45:29,645 --> 01:45:32,682
Nicholas Richard Beardsley...

1446
01:45:32,857 --> 01:45:35,526
Thomas Roderick Beardsley...

1447
01:45:35,693 --> 01:45:38,314
Jean Louise Beardsley...

1448
01:45:38,488 --> 01:45:41,607
- ...Phillip Anthony Beardsley...
- I'm legal.

1449
01:45:44,410 --> 01:45:47,245
Gerald Joseph Beardsley...

1450
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,783
and Teresa Rose Beardsley.

1451
01:45:52,502 --> 01:45:56,084
Will you hand these to the clerk,
please? Thank you.

1452
01:45:58,466 --> 01:46:00,340
Helen North Beardsley.

1453
01:46:00,551 --> 01:46:02,295
Yes, sir.

1454
01:46:05,056 --> 01:46:07,547
There's been great fear expressed
by many people...

1455
01:46:07,725 --> 01:46:11,224
that no one woman can give
this large number of children...

1456
01:46:11,395 --> 01:46:13,353
sufficient attention and affection...

1457
01:46:13,522 --> 01:46:16,014
to allow them to grow up
in a healthy atmosphere.

1458
01:46:16,234 --> 01:46:20,148
But in this court's investigation of your
home, the reverse seems to be true.

1459
01:46:20,321 --> 01:46:24,401
All the children seem to be happy,
well-fed and normal...

1460
01:46:24,575 --> 01:46:26,947
the house amazingly clean
and in good order.

1461
01:46:28,496 --> 01:46:31,865
My wife has two children,
one poodle and a full-time maid...

1462
01:46:32,041 --> 01:46:34,828
and can't seem to manage anything.
What is your secret?

1463
01:46:35,461 --> 01:46:38,996
Well, sir, a great deal of love...

1464
01:46:39,173 --> 01:46:41,249
a little discipline...

1465
01:46:41,425 --> 01:46:43,751
and a husband who doesn't criticise.

1466
01:46:46,722 --> 01:46:49,178
Michael Francis Beardsley...

1467
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:52,055
Charles William Beardsley...

1468
01:46:52,603 --> 01:46:57,265
and so forth and so forth Beardsley.
Will the minors step forward, please?

1469
01:47:01,529 --> 01:47:04,198
- Michael Francis Beardsley, do you...?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1470
01:47:04,365 --> 01:47:06,404
I haven't asked the question yet.

1471
01:47:06,575 --> 01:47:10,027
I leave for Camp Pendleton in an hour.
I was trying to speed things up.

1472
01:47:10,663 --> 01:47:13,154
Besides, it doesn't matter much
what this court does.

1473
01:47:13,332 --> 01:47:15,325
You see, we held our
own meeting yesterday.

1474
01:47:15,501 --> 01:47:18,668
If you're interested in democracy,
Helen North Beardsley...

1475
01:47:18,838 --> 01:47:22,337
was unanimously elected
our mother, for life.

1476
01:47:22,508 --> 01:47:24,797
Three cheers for Helen North Beardsley.

1477
01:47:30,266 --> 01:47:32,258
Mommy, pick me up!

1478
01:47:34,895 --> 01:47:36,354
Mommy, pick me up!

1479
01:47:42,778 --> 01:47:45,316
- Oh, here he comes.
- Here he comes.

1480
01:47:48,117 --> 01:47:50,904
Well, let's not get sticky about this.

1481
01:47:51,245 --> 01:47:53,284
Never saw you carry a bag for your mother.

1482
01:47:53,455 --> 01:47:56,207
- Mom's not in the Marines.
- That's what you think.

1483
01:47:56,375 --> 01:48:00,836
Mike, I know this sounds crazy, but it's
gonna be lonesome around here.

1484
01:48:01,005 --> 01:48:03,163
With this mob?

1485
01:48:04,758 --> 01:48:08,127
Good luck. You sure you don't want
us to drive you to the bus station?

1486
01:48:08,304 --> 01:48:10,842
No, thanks, Dad. I'd rather walk.

1487
01:48:11,849 --> 01:48:13,473
Bye, Mike.

1488
01:48:17,396 --> 01:48:18,724
So long, Mike.

1489
01:48:18,897 --> 01:48:21,471
- Now, you take it easy, Phillip.
- Okay.

1490
01:48:34,997 --> 01:48:36,277
I don't know what to say.

1491
01:48:36,749 --> 01:48:39,703
How about Washington's farewell
to the troops?

1492
01:48:41,754 --> 01:48:44,671
Well, so long.
Don't everybody write at once, huh?

1493
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,757
- So long, Mike.
- Goodbye, Mike.
