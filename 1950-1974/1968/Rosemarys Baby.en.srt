1
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,558
Are you a doctor?

2
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:21,559
Yes. Yes.

3
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,061
He's an actor.

4
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,562
Oh, an actor.

5
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,272
We're very popular
with actors.

6
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,566
Have l, uh,
seen you in anything?

7
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,402
Let's see. I did Hamlet a while back,
didn't l, Liz?

8
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,072
And then we did, the, uh,
The Sand piper.

9
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,740
He's joking.
He was in Luther

10
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,242
and Nobody Loves An Albatross

11
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,577
and a lot of television
plays and commercials.

12
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:42,080
Well, that's where the money is,
isn't it? Commercials.

13
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,706
And the artistic thrills, too.

14
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,965
7, Diego.

15
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,716
Originally,
the smallest apartment was in 9.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,219
They've been broken up
into four, fives, and sixes.

17
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,221
Now, 7-E is a four,

18
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,306
originally the back
part of a 10.

19
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,142
It has the original dining room
for its living room,

20
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,061
another bedroom
for the bedroom,

21
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,563
and two servants' rooms
thrown together

22
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,815
for a dining room
or a second bedroom.

23
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,358
Do you have children?

24
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,861
Uh, we plan to.

25
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,282
We must oil that gate,
Diego.

26
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,952
This way, please.

27
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,795
The previous tenant,
Mrs. Gardenia,

28
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,922
passed away
just a few days ago,

29
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,549
so nothing
has been moved yet.

30
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,718
Her son asked me to say
that some of the furniture

31
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,095
could be picked up
practically for the asking.

32
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,597
Did she die
in the apartment?

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,723
Not that it makes
any difference.

34
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
In a hospital.

35
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,603
She'd been in a coma
for weeks.

36
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,104
After you, please.

37
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,606
Thank you.

38
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,608
She was very old

39
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,110
and passed away
without ever waking.

40
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:59,115
I'd be grateful to go that way myself
when the time comes.

41
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,368
Oh, no, no, no, not
in the apartment, no.

42
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,662
She was chipper
right to the end,

43
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,290
Been one of the first women
lawyers in New York state.

44
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,042
Did a little gardening on
the side, too.

45
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,002
She was quite a woman.

46
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,504
Oh, closet.

47
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,923
Oh, plenty of closets.

48
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,510
Oh, nice view of the park.

49
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,012
Oh, very nice view.
"I can no longer associate myself"

50
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,305
Now, this room, for instance,

51
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,806
it would make
a lovely nursery.

52
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,517
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,519
would brighten it
tremendously.

54
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,521
What are all
these things here?

55
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,022
Herbs, mostly.

56
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,899
A nice large bathroom.

57
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,526
Mmm. Mint, basil.

58
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,694
Yeah. No marijuana?

59
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,579
The, uh, master bedroom.

60
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,622
Oh, yes.

61
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:50,083
Here we are,
back at the hallway again.

62
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,459
There.

63
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:56,047
Oh...
Oh, Guy!

64
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,048
Yeah.

65
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,049
Ohh!

66
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,968
The fireplace works,
Of course.

67
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:00,969
Great.

68
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,470
Oh!

69
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,515
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!

70
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:06,975
See what she's trying
to do?

71
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,476
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent, see?

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,979
Yes. Well, we'd raise it
if we were allowed.

73
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,898
Apartments with
this kind of charm--

74
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,570
Why, that's odd.

75
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,034
There's a closet
behind that secretary.

76
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:28,037
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.

77
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,040
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.

78
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,754
She moved it.
It used to be there.

79
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:45,555
Give me
a hand, will you?

80
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,537
I see now why she
went into a coma!

81
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:14,918
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
She was 89!

82
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,503
Should we open it?

83
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,046
Maybe her son should.

84
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,134
I'm authorized
to show the apartment.

85
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:25,637
Well!

86
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,639
Whatever she locked in
got out.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,141
Well, perhaps she didn't need
five closets.

88
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:34,145
Why would she cover up
her vacuum cleaner and her towels?

89
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:36,272
I don't suppose
we'll ever know.

90
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:38,608
Maybe she was becoming
senile after all.

91
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,776
Is there anything else?

92
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,111
Yes, please.
What about the laundry facilities?

93
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,696
It's bigger
than the other one.

94
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,908
Yeah. It's more expensive, too,
you know?

95
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,409
It's better located.

96
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,911
Yeah, well, God knows,

97
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,080
I could walk to all
the theaters from here.

98
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,207
Oh, Guy, let's take it,
please?

99
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,625
That living room
could be--

100
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,835
Oh, please,
let's take it.

101
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,754
O.K., darling,
we get out of the other lease, O.K.

102
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,756
I was tempted
to write the management

103
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,092
that you were drug addicts
and litterbugs.

104
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,593
Instead, I decided to lie

105
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,595
and tell them you
were wonderful tenants.

106
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,097
Oh, you're great, Hutch.

107
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,099
Wish I could talk
you out of it, though.

108
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,600
He's pulling
your leg, Ro, honey.

109
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:14,102
Indeed I'm not.

110
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:15,979
Now, that looks great.
That is--

111
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,981
Are you aware
that the Bramford

112
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,651
had rather an unpleasant reputation
around the turn of the century?

113
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,653
It's where
the Trench sisters

114
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,655
conducted their little
dietary experiments,

115
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:28,491
and Keith Kennedy
held his parties.

116
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:31,452
Adrian Marcato lived there, too.
So did Pearl Ames.

117
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,538
- Who was Adrian Marcato?
- Who were the Trench sisters?

118
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,708
The Trench sisters were two proper
Victorian ladies.

119
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,711
They cooked and ate several
young children, including a niece.

120
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,712
Oh, lovely.

121
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,131
Adrian Marcato
practiced witchcraft.

122
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,800
He made quite a splash
in the nineties

123
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,761
by announcing that he'd
conjured up the living devil.

124
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,263
Apparently,
people believed him,

125
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,515
so they attacked
and nearly killed him

126
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,184
in the lobby
of the Bramford.

127
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,226
You're joking?

128
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,437
Later, the Keith Kennedy
business began,

129
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,689
and by the twenties,
the house was half empty.

130
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,399
I knew about
Keith Kennedy.

131
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,942
I didn't know that Marcato
lived there.

132
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,360
And those sisters.

133
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,571
World War Il filled
the house up again.

134
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,572
Terrific.

135
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,823
What? The house?

136
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:09,824
The lamb.

137
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:10,825
Oh.

138
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,619
They called it
Black Bramford.

139
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:16,706
But, Hutch, awful things happen
in every apartment house.

140
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,126
Ah, but this house has a high incidence
of unpleasant happenings.

141
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:23,588
In '59, a dead infant was found,

142
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,132
wrapped in newspaper
in the basement.

143
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,968
Mmm! You really
rouse my appetite.

144
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,054
Have some more wine.

145
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,092
Roman!

146
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:12,595
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!

147
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,465
Hey, these are shelves.

148
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,898
Hey...

149
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,482
Iet's make love.

150
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,110
Shh!

151
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,614
I think I hear
the Trench sisters chewing.

152
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,116
Oh!

153
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,796
Straight up
to the left.

154
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:54,257
Here in Daytona, Florida,

155
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,593
it's the 250-CC
100-Mile Classic

156
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,053
with Yamaha leading
the pack on the final lap...

157
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:02,682
and winning it, as Yamaha takes 7
of the top 10 places.

158
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,519
It's the third straight year for Yamaha,
a clean sweep.

159
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,646
Yamaha is race bred
from champions,

160
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,939
and, as you can see,

161
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,858
we have a model for
every kind of riding.

162
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:15,195
You know,you really should
Discover the swingin' world of Yamaha.

163
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,529
Why don't you get on,
have a ride?

164
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:17,780
Come on. Get on.

165
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,824
O.K., come on.
Let'sgo.

166
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,414
Look.

167
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,005
It's great.

168
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:54,150
I'm sorry. I thought
you were Victoria Vetri, the actress.

169
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,151
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,945
That's all right.

171
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,738
A lot of people
think I'm Victoria.

172
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,240
I don't see
any resemblance.

173
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:01,741
Do you know her?

174
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:02,742
No.

175
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,412
My name's
Terry Gionoffrio.

176
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:09,415
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

177
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,751
Uh, we--we're
new tenants here.

178
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,753
I'm staying with the Castavets,
seventh floor.

179
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,256
I'm their guest, sort of,
Since June.

180
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,466
Our apartment used to be
the back part of yours.

181
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,592
Oh, for goodness sakes.

182
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,386
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs., uh...

183
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,221
Yeah, um, Miss, uh...
Gard--Gardenia.

184
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,264
Gardenia. Yeah.

185
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,057
She was a good friend
of the Castavets.

186
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,643
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
and things for her to cook with.

187
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,686
I saw those plants.

188
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,604
Yeah. Well, now,
she grows her own things.

189
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:35,191
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.

190
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,359
What does
your husband do?

191
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,360
He's an actor.

192
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:39,654
No kidding?
What's his name?

193
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,322
Guy Woodhouse.

194
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:44,325
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves an Albatross,

195
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,995
and he does a lot
of television and radio.

196
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:49,330
Gee, I watch TV
all day long.

197
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:50,999
I bet I've seen him.

198
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,001
Wow!

199
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:54,335
Ooh!

200
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,837
I hate this basement.

201
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,338
Yeah, me, too.

202
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,174
It gives me the creeps.

203
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,009
Listen, why don't we come down here
regular together

204
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,302
and do our laundry?

205
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,803
O.K., that would be great.

206
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:05,138
I have a good luck charm.

207
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,266
It might work
for both of us.

208
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,767
Oh, that's beautiful.

209
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:10,768
Isn't it?

210
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,104
Mrs. Castavet
gave it to me.

211
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,230
It's good luck.

212
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,773
Anyway, it's supposed to be.

213
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,775
It's got some
stuff inside.

214
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,115
I'm not mad about
the smell either.

215
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,450
I hope it works.

216
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,784
It's a beautiful charm, though.

217
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,786
I've never seen
anything like it.

218
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,163
European.

219
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,373
The Castavets are the most wonderful
people in the world,

220
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:33,291
bar none.

221
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,168
You know, they picked me up
Off the sidewalk, literally?

222
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,169
You were sick?

223
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,088
I was starving and on dope

224
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,423
and doing a lot
of other things.

225
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:41,925
They're childless, though.

226
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,426
I'm like the daughter
they never had.

227
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,595
At first, I thought they
wanted me for some kind of sex thing,

228
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,097
but they've turned out to be
like real grandparents.

229
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,017
It's nice to know
there are people like that

230
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,394
when you hear
so much about apathy

231
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,438
and people who are afraid
of getting involved.

232
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,899
I'd be dead now
if it wasn't for them.

233
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:00,652
That's an absolute fact,
dead or in jail.

234
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,863
You don't have any family
that could have helped you?

235
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:05,031
A brother in the Navy.

236
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:08,368
Why, it's impossible
to be 100% sure!

237
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,161
If you want my opinion,

238
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,413
we shouldn't tell her at all!

239
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,498
That's my opinion!

240
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,583
That must be
the partition.

241
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,754
That's the back part
of the original 10 with a dining room,

242
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:22,048
and there's--
there's a closet over here,

243
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,551
and then there's
a closet over here.

244
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:04,257
Stay back, huh, lady?

245
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:13,808
Get back now,
will you, please?

246
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:15,768
Get back.
There's nothing to see.

247
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,563
Get back,
will you, please?

248
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:21,858
Jesus.

249
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,026
Get back!

250
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,527
We know her.

251
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:26,029
What's her name?

252
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,363
Terry.

253
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,448
Terry what?

254
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:30,491
Ro?

255
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,495
What was her name again?
Terry what?

256
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,830
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.

257
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:38,333
She was staying with some people
named Castavet,

258
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,334
7-E.

259
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,211
Yeah. We got that already.

260
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,046
Short and sweet.

261
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,007
She stuck it to the window sill
with a band-aid.

262
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,883
Come on. Get back.

263
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,384
Theresa Gionoffrio.

264
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:49,552
Move on!

265
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:50,678
Move on!

266
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:53,890
You knew her?

267
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:54,891
Only slightly.

268
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,893
Come on, Ro baby.
Let's go.

269
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:58,520
Oh! Here they come.

270
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,067
You folks the Castavets
on the seventh floor?

271
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,068
We are.

272
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,446
You have a young woman named
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?

273
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,615
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?

274
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,117
You'd better brace yourself
for some bad news.

275
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,118
She's dead.

276
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,871
Jumped out
of the window.

277
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:19,374
That's not possible!
It's a mistake!

278
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:24,212
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?

279
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,090
I knew this would happen.

280
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:30,176
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

281
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:33,137
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

282
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:37,058
Well, that--that doesn't
mean she killed herself.

283
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,685
She was a very happy girl

284
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,687
with no reason
for self-destruction.

285
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,231
She must have been cleaning
the windows or something.

286
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,191
She wasn't cleaning
windows at midnight.

287
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,693
Why not? Maybe she was!

288
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,194
Is that her handwriting?

289
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:51,698
Yeah.

290
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,949
Definitely.
Absolutely.

291
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:54,242
Thank you.

292
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,703
I'll see this gets back
to you when we're done with it.

293
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,122
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

294
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:00,623
She was so happy.

295
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:02,542
Who's the next-of-kin?

296
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,252
She's all alone.
She didn't have anybody,

297
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:05,253
only us.

298
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:06,754
Didn't she
have a brother?

299
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:07,755
Did she?

300
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,258
She said she did.
In the Navy.

301
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,759
News to me.

302
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:13,761
Do you know where he's stationed?

303
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:14,929
No, I don't.

304
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:18,141
She mentioned him to me
in the laundry room.

305
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:19,601
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

306
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,103
Uh, we're in,
uh, 7-E.

307
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,606
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs. Castavet.

308
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:27,108
She seemed so happy
and full of--

309
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:30,111
She said wonderful things about you
and your husband,

310
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:31,112
how grateful she was.

311
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:32,697
Thank you.

312
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,616
You know anything else
about this brother

313
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:35,700
except he's
in the Navy?

314
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:36,743
No, I don't.

315
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,620
It should be easy
to find him.

316
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,415
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.

317
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:43,374
It's such a pity.

318
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,376
Well, thank you.

319
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:29,796
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.

320
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:38,888
Please don't tell me
what Laura-Louise said

321
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,390
because I'm not interested.

322
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,684
If you'd listened to me,

323
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,060
we wouldn't have
had to do this!

324
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:45,687
We'd have been
all set to go now

325
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,523
instead of having to start
all over from scratch!

326
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,692
I told you not to
tell her in advance!

327
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,736
I told you she wouldn't
be open-minded!

328
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:58,783
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,

329
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,535
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

330
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,744
Otherwise, we would--

331
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:11,129
Hello. How are you?

332
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:12,714
Fine. May I come in a minute?

333
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,174
Yes, of course. Please do.

334
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:15,675
I just come over
to thank you

335
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,177
for saying those nice things to us
the other night.

336
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,678
Oh, no, please.
There's--

337
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:20,847
Poor Terry. We thought
maybe we'd failed her some way,

338
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,600
although her note made it crystal clear
we hadn't.

339
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:25,476
You'll never know
how helpful it was

340
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,103
in such a shock moment.

341
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:29,314
So I do thank you.
Roman does, too.

342
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:30,356
Roman's my hubby.

343
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:32,692
You're welcome.
I'm glad I could help.

344
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:36,321
Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday.

345
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:38,573
Now we got to forget and go on.
It won't be easy.

346
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:40,492
We don't have any children of our own.
You have any?

347
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,493
No, we don't.

348
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:42,994
Oh, well,
there you have it.

349
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:46,831
Ohh! Oh...
that's a nice--

350
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:49,542
Look how you put the table!
Now, isn't that interesting?

351
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:50,793
I saw it in a magazine.

352
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,213
Oh, my. Nice paintjob.

353
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:54,380
I know.

354
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,216
Ahh...well.

355
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,885
That's nice. What is that?
That's the TV room?

356
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,178
Yeah, well,
only temporarily.

357
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,013
It's going
to be a nursery.

358
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,181
Oh, you're pregnant?

359
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:04,349
No, not yet.

360
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,309
I hope to be as soon
as we're settled.

361
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,894
Wonderful.
Well, you're young and healthy.

362
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,187
You ought to have
lots ofchildren.

363
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:10,688
We plan to have three.

364
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,482
I'm dying to see what you did
to this apartment.

365
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,692
The woman who had it before
was a dear friend of mine.

366
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,194
I know.
Terry told me.

367
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:17,529
Well, did she?

368
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:20,031
You two had some long talks together
in the laundry room.

369
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:21,074
Only one.

370
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,575
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

371
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:25,078
Ah ha ha!
It looks so much brighter.

372
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:29,207
What do you pay
for a chair like that?

373
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:33,002
Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.

374
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,214
What does your hubby do?

375
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:37,715
He's an actor.

376
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:41,219
I knew it!
I said it to Roman yesterday.

377
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,012
He's so good-looking.

378
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:45,014
What movies was he in?

379
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:45,932
No movies.

380
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,725
He was in two plays
called Luther

381
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,310
and Nobody Loves an Albatross

382
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,229
and a lot of television
and radio.

383
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:52,230
Listen, Rosemary...

384
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:54,774
I got a 2-inch thick
sirloin steak

385
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,693
sitting defrosting
right this minute.

386
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:59,070
Why don't you and Guy come over,
have supper with us tonight?

387
00:21:59,112 --> 00:21:59,988
What do you say?

388
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:01,489
Oh, no. We couldn't.

389
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:02,657
Why not?

390
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,742
No, really, that's very kind of you.
Listen--

391
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,662
It would be a real help to us.
Oh...

392
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,664
first night we'll be alone since...

393
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:13,251
Oh, are you sure it wouldn't be
too much trouble for you?

394
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:15,628
Oh, honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask you.

395
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,380
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.

396
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,715
I'll have to check with Guy,
though.

397
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,302
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer!

398
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:23,845
Oh! Here's your mail!

399
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:24,846
Oh! Ads!

400
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:25,847
Thank you.

401
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:37,066
Yoo-hoo!

402
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,986
Hey.

403
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:41,654
Mmm!

404
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,336
Donald Baumgart
got that part.

405
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,433
It's a bad play anyway.

406
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:11,935
Yeah. Even if it folds out of town,

407
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,312
it's the kind of part
that gets noticed.

408
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:21,945
Mrs. Castavet was here

409
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:25,949
to thank me for what
I said about Terry.

410
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,285
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.

411
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,205
You know she actually
asked the prices of things?

412
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,456
No kidding.

413
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,794
She invited us to have dinner
with them tonight.

414
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:39,546
I told her I'd have
to check with you,

415
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,422
but that it would
probably be O.K.

416
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:44,509
Oh, Jesus! We don't have to do that,
do we, honey?

417
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:45,677
I think they're lonely.

418
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,263
We get friendly with
an old couple like that,

419
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:49,222
and we'll never
get rid of them.

420
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,932
They're right
across the wall.

421
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:53,560
I told her she
could count on us.

422
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:58,273
You don't have
to sulk about it.

423
00:23:58,356 --> 00:23:59,649
I'm not sulking.

424
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:01,818
I see exactly
what you mean.

425
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:02,819
Hell, we'll go.

426
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,320
No, no. What for?

427
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:05,488
We'll go!

428
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:08,741
No. We don't have to
if you don't want to.

429
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:11,995
That sounds so phony,
but I really mean it, really, I do.

430
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,123
Be my good deed
for the day.

431
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,252
O.K., but only if you want to.

432
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,713
We'll make it clear that it's just
for this one night

433
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,923
and not the beginning
of anything, all right?

434
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:26,426
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come on in.

435
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,928
Roman's fixing us
some vodka blushes.

436
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,639
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.

437
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:34,142
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

438
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,894
Look, dinner isn't ready
just yet,

439
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,395
but sit down there
anywhere.

440
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:38,563
Take a seat
on the couch.

441
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:40,106
You'll find yourself
very comfortable.

442
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,442
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.

443
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,444
No, no, no.
Don't get up.

444
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:48,072
Generally, I pour these out precisely
as a bartender, don't l, Minnie?

445
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:49,115
Just watch
the carpet.

446
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,950
But this evening I made
a little too much,

447
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,453
and rather I'm afr--
Oh, there we are.

448
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:54,621
No, no, no.
Sit down, please.

449
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:55,955
Now, Mrs. Woodhouse...

450
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,375
Uh, Mr. Woodhouse,
uh, vodka blush?

451
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,376
Yes, thanks.

452
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,878
Have you ever
tasted one?

453
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,379
No, no.
I haven't.

454
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:04,422
It looks delicious.

455
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:06,883
Minnie. They're very
popular in Australia.

456
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,552
Now, to our guests--
welcome to our home.

457
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:10,553
Hear, hear.

458
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:11,554
Cheers.

459
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:12,680
Mmm.

460
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,393
The carpet.

461
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:18,811
Oh, dear.

462
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:20,396
Brand-new carpet.

463
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,733
This man
is so clumsy!

464
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:25,902
Do you come
from Australia?

465
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:29,405
Oh, no, no. I'm from
right here in New York city.

466
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:30,907
I've been there, though.

467
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,408
I've been everywhere,
literally.

468
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:35,411
You name a place,
and I've been there.

469
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:36,913
Go ahead. Name a place.

470
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:38,414
Fairbanks, Alaska!

471
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:40,917
I've been there,
been all over Alaska--

472
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,296
Yes--Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

473
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,090
I spent four months
there in '38--

474
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:48,258
Where are
you folks from?

475
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:49,759
Well--Well, l--

476
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:52,262
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

477
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:54,430
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is, too.

478
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,850
Do you travel
for business?

479
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,768
Well, business
and pleasure both.

480
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:01,896
I'm 79, and I've been going one place
or another since I was 10.

481
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:04,065
You name a place,
I've been there.

482
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:05,233
Ah! Steak's ready.

483
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:07,235
Don't rush your drinks, now.

484
00:26:08,027 --> 00:26:09,988
Roman, take your pill!

485
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:14,075
No Pope ever visits a city where
the newspapers are on strike.

486
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,911
I heard he's going to postpone
and wait till it's over.

487
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:18,913
Well, that's show biz.

488
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,458
That's exactly what it is.

489
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,419
All the costumes
are rituals,

490
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,587
all religions.

491
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,964
Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary.

492
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:28,756
No, no.

493
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:30,925
No, you're not religious,
my dear, are you?

494
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,969
Well, l--I was brought up a Catholic.

495
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:34,470
Now I don't know.

496
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:35,972
You looked
uncomfortable.

497
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:37,473
Well, he is the Pope.

498
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:39,976
Now, you don't need
to have respect for him

499
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:41,936
because he pretends
that he's holy.

500
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,188
Now, that's a good point.

501
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:46,691
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

502
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:50,695
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion

503
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:52,238
was given, I thought,
in Luther.

504
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,033
Did you ever get to play
that leading part, Guy?

505
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,242
Me? No.

506
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:58,495
Weren't you Albert Finney's
understudy?

507
00:26:58,828 --> 00:26:59,871
No.

508
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,122
Well, that's strange.

509
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:03,291
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

510
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:04,792
and checking in the program

511
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:06,294
to see who you were.

512
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:08,046
Um, what gesture
was that?

513
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,883
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction--

514
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,303
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

515
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:17,347
It was a kind of
involuntary reach.

516
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:21,643
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.

517
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,562
Oh, come on.
-No, no. I mean it!

518
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:27,065
My father was
a theatrical producer,

519
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:29,859
and my early years
were spent in the company

520
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,904
of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,
Modjeska.

521
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:34,072
Guy?

522
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,573
Oh, yes, please.

523
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:38,743
You have a most interesting
inner quality, Guy.

524
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,162
It appears in your
television work, too.

525
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:43,081
It should take you
a long way, indeed,

526
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:46,376
provided, of course,
that you get those initial breaks.

527
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:49,504
Are you preparing
for a show now?

528
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:52,507
Um, well,
I'm up for a couple parts.

529
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,009
Well, I can't believe
that you won't get them.

530
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:56,427
Well, I can.

531
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:59,430
I'd like to have
a spice garden someday.

532
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:01,850
I guess I'm a country girl
at heart.

533
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:04,102
You come from a big family?

534
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:05,895
Three brothers
and two sisters.

535
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,397
Your sisters married?

536
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:09,691
They have children?

537
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:11,693
One has two,
the other has four.

538
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:14,195
There's a chance you'll have
lots of children, too.

539
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,697
We're fertile, all right.

540
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:18,992
I've got 16
nieces and nephews.

541
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:20,577
Oh, my goodness!

542
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:28,293
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?

543
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:29,878
Oh, no.
That's fine, dear.

544
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:41,264
Now, Roman, will you stop
bending Guy's ears

545
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:42,765
with your Modjeska stories?

546
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,268
He's only listening
'cause he's polite.

547
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,270
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castavet.

548
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:49,981
Minnie!
I'm Minnie, he's Roman, O.K.?

549
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:51,399
O.K.?

550
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:52,567
O.K.

551
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,735
O.K.!

552
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:55,236
Terrific.
Just terrific.

553
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,196
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye.

554
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,363
Thank you
for having us.

555
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:59,157
Yeah, it was lovely.
Oh, bless you.

556
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,325
Minnie!

557
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:01,868
Minnie, ya good kid, ya.

558
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,662
Ooh!
About that steak, huh?

559
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,664
Oh, my God!
And the cake.

560
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:09,375
How did you eat two pieces?
It was weird.

561
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,002
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.

562
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:12,253
Out of politeness.

563
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:16,257
Only three dinner plates
that matched.

564
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:17,926
Shh!

565
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,678
And all that beautiful,
beautiful silver.

566
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,597
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.

567
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,682
Oh!
Yeah.

568
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:26,518
Guess what they have
in their bathroom.

569
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:27,685
A bidet.

570
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,187
Jokes for the John.

571
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,355
No.

572
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:32,357
A book on a hook
right next to the toilet.

573
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,610
Roman's stories are pretty damned
interesting, though.

574
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:36,736
Yeah?

575
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:39,614
Never even heard
of Forbes-Robertson before.

576
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,616
I'm going to go over there
again tomorrow night

577
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:43,117
and hear some more.

578
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,202
You are?

579
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:45,286
Yeah. He asked me.

580
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,038
Here. Do this damn thing for me,
will you?

581
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,207
I thought we were going to do something
With Joan and Dick Jellico.

582
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,626
- Was that definite?
- Well, it wasn't definite.

583
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:53,878
We'll see them next week.

584
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,131
You don't have to come along
If you don't want to.

585
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:58,633
You can stay here.

586
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:03,137
Yeah, I think I will stay here.

587
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:05,139
He knew Henry lrving, too.

588
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,308
I mean,
really interesting, you know?

589
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:10,311
Why did they take
their pictures down?

590
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:11,479
What do you mean?

591
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:13,398
Their pictures.
They took them down.

592
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,900
The hooks in the wall
and clean spaces

593
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:18,736
and the one picture
that is there doesn't fit.

594
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,155
I didn't notice that.

595
00:30:58,026 --> 00:30:59,861
Hi, dear.
We're not bothering you, are we?

596
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:01,863
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,

597
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:03,364
Lives up on 12.

598
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:05,867
Laura-Louise,
this is Guy's wife Rosemary.

599
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,410
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram!

600
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:10,413
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you, too.

601
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:11,915
Could we come in?

602
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:13,416
Uh, of course. Please do.

603
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,418
There you are.
Go ahead.

604
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:18,254
Oh, look what you got.
There's a light.

605
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:22,592
Oh, gosh!
Isn't that beautiful!

606
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,344
It came this morning.

607
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:26,179
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.

608
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:29,182
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.

609
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:30,767
And you're up and around?

610
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,769
On my first day,
I experienced such pain,

611
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,270
I couldn't move, eat,
or anything.

612
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:38,775
Dan used to give me gin
through a straw to kill the pain.

613
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:41,694
Girls today take things
much more in their stride.

614
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:43,696
They're much healthier
than we were,

615
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,241
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care.

616
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:48,409
What are those things over there,
seat covers?

617
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:50,328
Um, cushions for the window seats.

618
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:51,955
Oh, yeah.

619
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,002
Oh, before I forget.

620
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:02,298
This is for you
from Roman and me.

621
00:32:02,382 --> 00:32:03,842
For me?

622
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,886
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.

623
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,720
There's no reason--

624
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:10,265
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.

625
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,357
It's lovely.

626
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,360
Yeah. The green inside
is called tannis root.

627
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:23,862
That's for good luck.

628
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:27,407
It's lovely, but l--
I can't accept it.

629
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,908
You already have.

630
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:31,536
Put it on.
-Yeah.

631
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:36,583
Ah, you'll get used to the smell
before you know it.

632
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,126
Yeah, go on.

633
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:42,338
Ohh, yes.

634
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:46,342
Well, were his stories
as interesting as last night?

635
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:48,386
Yes. Did you have a good time?

636
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:49,554
All right.

637
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:51,055
I got a present.

638
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:54,392
It was Terry's.

639
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:55,560
No kidding?

640
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,061
Kind of pretty, though.

641
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,318
Aren't you going to wear it?

642
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:04,485
It smells.

643
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:07,197
There's stuff in it
called tannis root

644
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,698
from her greenhouse.

645
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,200
Not too bad, though.

646
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,252
Tannis, anyone?

647
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,004
Well, if you took it,

648
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:25,381
you ought to wear it.

649
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:44,108
Hello.

650
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,276
Yes.

651
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,778
This is he.

652
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:55,495
Oh, God, no.

653
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,040
Oh, the poor guy.

654
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,292
And, uh...

655
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:04,295
They don't have any idea
what's causing it?

656
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,297
Oh, my God.
That's awful.

657
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:07,882
That's just awful.

658
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:11,469
Yes, I would.

659
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,471
I mean, yes, I am.

660
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:17,934
I hate to get it
that way, but...

661
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:22,063
Well, you'd have
to speak to my agent

662
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:24,148
about that end of it.

663
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:27,068
Alan Stone.

664
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,778
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
Mr. Weiss,

665
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,322
not as far as
we're concerned.

666
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:33,658
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.

667
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:39,164
Guy?

668
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:42,542
What is it?

669
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:49,674
Donald Baumgart--
he's gone blind.

670
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:53,178
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.

671
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,304
Oh, no.

672
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,347
Oh, I've got the part.

673
00:34:57,557 --> 00:35:00,768
It's a hell of a way
to get it.

674
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:06,566
Listen, uh...

675
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:08,109
I have to get out
and walk around.

676
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,611
I understand.
Go ahead.

677
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:23,500
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.

678
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:27,170
It's a fascinating part.

679
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:29,172
He'll really
be noticed this time.

680
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:31,174
He also has an offer
for a lead

681
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:33,676
in a television
series, Miami Beach.

682
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,178
He's suddenly very hot.

683
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:38,723
Mm-hmm. I understand
why you're so overjoyed.

684
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:42,185
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life.

685
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:43,353
A challenge.

686
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:45,522
I see.

687
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:47,023
You know how actors are.

688
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:49,526
They're all a bit
self-centered.

689
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:51,528
I'll bet even
Laurence Olivier

690
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:53,530
is vain
and self-centered.

691
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,199
It's a difficult part.

692
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:58,701
He's got to work
with crutches

693
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:01,162
and, naturally,
he's preoccupied.

694
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,664
And he...

695
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:05,500
well, preoccupied.

696
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:10,588
I see you had another suicide
up there at happy house.

697
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,090
Oh, didn't I tell you?

698
00:36:12,131 --> 00:36:13,591
No, you didn't.

699
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,260
It was that girl
I told you about,

700
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:18,304
the drug-addict who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castavets.

701
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:19,764
I'm sure I told you that.

702
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:22,308
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully,

703
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,601
it seems.

704
00:36:44,873 --> 00:36:46,332
I've been a creep.

705
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,669
It's from worrying if Baumgart
would regain his sight,

706
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,171
rat that I am.

707
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:51,963
Oh, it's natural.

708
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,840
You're bound to feel
two ways about it.

709
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:55,842
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
for the rest of my days,

710
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:57,844
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

711
00:36:57,886 --> 00:36:58,678
You haven't been.

712
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,304
Yes, I have.

713
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:02,098
I've been tearing my hair out
over my career.

714
00:37:02,265 --> 00:37:04,184
Let's have a baby.
All right?

715
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:07,770
Let's have three babies, one at a time,
all right?

716
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:09,272
A baby. You know.

717
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:11,274
Mama, dada, poo-poo.
you know?

718
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:12,775
You mean it?

719
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,277
Sure, I mean it.

720
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,112
I mean, I even figured out
the right time to start,

721
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:17,280
Look.

722
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:19,782
You mean it, really?

723
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:24,370
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.

724
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:27,332
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake,
don't cry.

725
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:30,335
I won't. I won't.

726
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:35,673
Here goes nothing.

727
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:48,811
Mmm-unh! The paint!

728
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:50,522
The paint!

729
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:51,898
Good grief.

730
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:04,494
Nobody, but nobody
has a fire tonight.

731
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,501
Isn't it gorgeous?

732
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:14,546
I hope we have
the coldest winter ever.

733
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,063
Oh, shit!

734
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,030
Hi, Guy! How are ya?

735
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:43,032
No, don't let her in.

736
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:44,033
Not tonight.

737
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:47,036
Oh, that's very kind of you.

738
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,003
Oh, are you sure
you don't want to come in?

739
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,587
No! I don't want
to bother you.

740
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,923
Good.

741
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:01,634
Good.

742
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,762
Who says
there's nothing to ESP?

743
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:07,640
Madame and monsieur shall
have ze dessert after all!

744
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:09,100
Mousse au chocolat.

745
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,603
Or as Minnie calls it--
chocolate mouse.

746
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,064
I was afraid she'd stay
all evening.

747
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,066
She just wanted us
to try it.

748
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,611
Seein' it's one of her specialities.

749
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,237
It was sweet of her, really.

750
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:22,572
We shouldn't
make fun of her.

751
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,616
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

752
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:39,380
Mmm! It's good.

753
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:57,565
Has an undertaste.

754
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:59,776
A chalky undertaste.

755
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,238
I don't get it.

756
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:07,242
That's silly, honey.
There is no undertaste.

757
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:08,493
There is.

758
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:12,664
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

759
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:14,707
-I don't like it.
-It's delicious.

760
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,459
Here. You can have mine.

761
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:18,795
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.

762
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:22,340
Oh, if it's going to turn
into a big thing--

763
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:23,675
Look, if you really
can't stand it,

764
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:25,176
just don't eat it.

765
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,180
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

766
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:32,934
Would you turn
the record over, please?

767
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:48,575
There, Daddy,
do I get a gold star?

768
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:50,577
You get two of them.

769
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,537
I'm sorry
if I was stuffy.

770
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,080
You were.

771
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:56,124
...is making a full circle
of the ball park...

772
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,625
It's the Pope
at Yankee Stadium!

773
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,460
...to his specially built
canopy at second base.

774
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:00,962
Put him out!

775
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:02,964
Listen to that crowd roar.

776
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:04,966
Everywhere the Pope
Has been today,

777
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,467
he's received this type
of reception.

778
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:08,970
As one man put it
This afternoon,

779
00:41:09,012 --> 00:41:10,972
"Perhaps we are being
undignified,

780
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,473
but this is
a special day. "

781
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:13,975
And a special day
it has been.

782
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:16,978
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.

783
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:21,149
I'd like to give you
a brief summary

784
00:41:21,232 --> 00:41:22,650
of today's
historic happening.

785
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,653
Pope Paul VI arrived
at 9.:27A.M.

786
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:28,990
What is it?

787
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:31,993
Dizzy.

788
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:37,999
Hey.

789
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,669
No wonder.

790
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:43,171
All that booze.

791
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:48,635
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?

792
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:55,183
Hey.

793
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:56,976
Hey.

794
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,292
Nice.

795
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:22,961
Sleep is what you need.

796
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:24,462
A good night's sleep.

797
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:27,173
We have to make a baby.

798
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:30,176
Oh, we'll...
we'll do it.

799
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:33,888
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.

800
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:35,723
Just a nap.

801
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,556
Why are you
taking them off?

802
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,558
To make you
more comfortable.

803
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:20,518
I am more comfortable.

804
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:22,896
Sleep, Ro.

805
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,396
Isn't Hutch
coming with us?

806
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:06,606
Catholics only,

807
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:10,610
I wish we weren't bound by these
prejudices,

808
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:13,363
but, unfortunately...

809
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:59,409
Easy, easy.

810
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:01,327
You got her too high.

811
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:03,329
Typhoon!
Typhoon!

812
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:06,332
It killed 55 people
in London

813
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:09,669
and it's heading this way!

814
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:17,886
You better
go down below, Miss.

815
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,617
She's awake.
She sees.

816
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,409
She don't see.

817
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:24,077
As long as
she ate the mouse,

818
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:27,038
She can't hear.
She's like dead. Now sing.

819
00:46:37,674 --> 00:46:40,677
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.

820
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,012
It's only the mouse bite.

821
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:45,598
You'd better have
your legs tied down

822
00:46:45,682 --> 00:46:47,433
in case of convulsions.

823
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:51,104
Yes, I suppose so.

824
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:54,149
There's always a chance
it was rabid.

825
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,441
lf the music bothers you,

826
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:58,444
Iet me know,
and I'll have it stopped.

827
00:46:58,486 --> 00:46:59,863
Oh, no, no, no.

828
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:02,699
Please don't change
the program on my account.

829
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:04,868
Try to sleep.

830
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:08,288
We'll be waiting up on deck.

831
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:49,078
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

832
00:47:58,213 --> 00:48:00,673
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

833
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:03,676
Yes. That's why I couldn't come
to see you.

834
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:04,844
That's all right.

835
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:08,806
We wouldn't want you
To jeopardize your health.

836
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:11,309
Am I forgiven, father?

837
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:14,896
Oh, absolutely.

838
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:29,077
Hey, it's after 9:00.

839
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,163
Uhm.

840
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:35,708
Five minutes.

841
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:38,711
I have to be at Alan's
at 10:00.

842
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:40,880
Eat out.

843
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:42,465
Like hell I will.

844
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:55,353
What time is it?

845
00:48:55,395 --> 00:48:57,272
It's 10 after 9:00.

846
00:48:58,398 --> 00:49:00,733
What time did I go to sleep?

847
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:02,735
You didn't go to sleep.

848
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,237
You passed out.

849
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,739
From now on you get
cocktails or wine,

850
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:09,450
Not cocktails and wine, hmm?

851
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:12,078
The dreams I had.

852
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:19,627
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.

853
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:23,089
I didn't want to
miss baby night.

854
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:25,842
A couple of my nails were ragged.
-While I was out?

855
00:49:25,884 --> 00:49:29,179
And it was kind of fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.

856
00:49:31,764 --> 00:49:35,935
I dreamed
someone was raping me.

857
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:37,937
I don't know,
someone inhuman.

858
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,981
Thanks a lot!

859
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:45,111
What's the matter?
-Nothing.

860
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,781
I didn't want
to miss the night.

861
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:51,784
We could've done it
this morning or tonight.

862
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:54,287
Last night wasn't
the only split second.

863
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,790
I was a little bit loaded myself,
you know?

864
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,187
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?

865
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,896
Oh, yeah.

866
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:22,357
I think I put a little too much
cream de cocoa in it.

867
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,525
No, no.
It was delicious.

868
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:24,859
You'll have to give me
the recipe.

869
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:26,861
Yeah, love to.
Oh, listen, you going shopping?

870
00:50:26,945 --> 00:50:28,446
Do me a teeny favor,
will ya?

871
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,032
Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
I'll pay you later.

872
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:32,534
Right. Bye-bye.

873
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:45,255
Don't you think we ought
to talk about it?

874
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:46,381
About what?

875
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:49,008
The way you haven't
been looking at me.

876
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,219
What are you talking about?
I've been looking at you.

877
00:50:51,302 --> 00:50:52,428
You haven't.

878
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,930
Why, sure, I have.

879
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:56,933
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?

880
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:00,812
Nothing. Never mind.

881
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:03,064
No, no. Don't say that.
What is it?

882
00:51:03,148 --> 00:51:04,232
Nothing.

883
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:06,234
Look, honey, l--

884
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:08,570
I know I've been preoccupied
with the part and all,

885
00:51:08,653 --> 00:51:10,071
but it is important.

886
00:51:10,155 --> 00:51:12,574
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

887
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:29,257
It was due on Friday.

888
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:31,843
It was?

889
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:35,471
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.

890
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:36,806
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.

891
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,183
- A quarter.
- O.K.

892
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:39,434
You're going to lose.

893
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:40,685
Shut up, will you?

894
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:41,686
You're getting me
all jumpy.

895
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:43,897
It's only been two days.

896
00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:45,857
When will I know?

897
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,359
I'll call you just as soon as I
get the results.

898
00:51:48,443 --> 00:51:50,528
I like to do
a general examination

899
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:52,530
just to know
something more...

900
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:57,118
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended
you to me, Doctor.

901
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:58,203
Oh, yes.
How is she?

902
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:01,122
She's fine. And the boys are great.
Did you deliver all of them?

903
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:03,249
No, just the last.

904
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,084
Universal hemoglobin.

905
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:07,253
Yes, Doctor.

906
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:21,100
We went to see
The Fantasticks.

907
00:52:21,142 --> 00:52:23,228
-Did you?
-Mmm.

908
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:24,938
Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah.

909
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:26,064
Good.

910
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:33,279
Hello?

911
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:34,280
Mrs. Woodhouse?

912
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:35,240
Dr. Hill?

913
00:52:35,323 --> 00:52:36,407
Congratulations.

914
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:38,743
-Really?
-Really.

915
00:52:41,454 --> 00:52:42,497
Are you there?

916
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,999
Uh, yes, um,
what happens now?

917
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,502
You come see me
next month.

918
00:52:47,585 --> 00:52:49,504
You get those Natalin pills.
One a day.

919
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:52,006
I'll mail you forms
for the hospital.

920
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,008
Uh, when will it be?

921
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:56,010
It works out
to be June 28th.

922
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:59,472
-That sounds so far away!
-It is.

923
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:00,932
One more thing,
Mrs. Woodhouse,

924
00:53:00,974 --> 00:53:02,934
we'd like another
blood sample.

925
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:04,435
Oh, yes, of course.

926
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:05,562
What for?

927
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:07,564
The nurse didn't take enough,

928
00:53:07,647 --> 00:53:09,649
so would you
drop by and see her?

929
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:11,609
But I am pregnant,
aren't l?

930
00:53:11,693 --> 00:53:15,613
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--
Blood sugar and so forth.

931
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:17,282
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.

932
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:19,868
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.

933
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:21,452
All right.
Don't forget the pills.

934
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:22,495
No, I won't.

935
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:24,831
-Goodbye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
-Goodbye, Dr. Hill.

936
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:28,543
Blood sugar?

937
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,810
What's that?

938
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,190
Oh!

939
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:51,316
That's great.

940
00:53:51,399 --> 00:53:52,942
That's just great.

941
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:53,943
Father.

942
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,069
Mother.

943
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,324
Guy, Guy, listen.

944
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:02,410
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, O.K.?

945
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:04,746
A new openness in
talking to each other,

946
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:06,915
because we haven't been open.

947
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:10,210
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.

948
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:11,794
That's what
the whole trouble is.

949
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:14,047
You know I love you,
don't you, Ro?

950
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,381
I do. I swear to God

951
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:16,758
I'm going to be
as open and--

952
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:18,134
It's my fault
as much as yours.

953
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:19,969
No, bull, it's mine.
Now you bear with me.

954
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:21,804
I'll try and do better,
you hear?

955
00:54:21,888 --> 00:54:23,556
Oh, Guy.

956
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:33,900
What?

957
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:35,235
It's...

958
00:54:35,276 --> 00:54:38,446
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

959
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,490
Hey...

960
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:42,075
know what I'd love to do?

961
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:43,076
What?

962
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,702
Tell Minnie and Roman.

963
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:47,080
Oh, I know, I know.

964
00:54:47,163 --> 00:54:48,414
It's, uh...

965
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:51,584
it's, uh, supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,

966
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:54,337
but I already told them
that we were trying.

967
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,923
They were so pleased.

968
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:58,800
Tell them.

969
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:00,844
Back in two minutes?

970
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:14,232
You're pregnant.

971
00:55:16,985 --> 00:55:18,444
Another blood sample.

972
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,529
Ta-da!

973
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:22,782
Now, that's what
I call good news.

974
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:25,869
Aw, honey,
congratulations.

975
00:55:25,952 --> 00:55:26,870
Thank you.

976
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:29,664
-Best wishes, Rosemary.
-Thank you very much.

977
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:31,416
We are more pleased
than we can say.

978
00:55:31,499 --> 00:55:32,959
We didn't have any
champagne on hand,

979
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:34,794
but this will do
just as nicely.

980
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:35,837
When are you due, dear?

981
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:37,255
June 28th.

982
00:55:37,338 --> 00:55:38,798
Oh, it's going
to be so exciting.

983
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:40,425
Listen, dear,
you got a good doctor?

984
00:55:40,508 --> 00:55:41,801
Oh, yes,
a very good one.

985
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:43,344
One of the top
obstetricians

986
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:45,597
is a dear friend of ours,
Abe Sapirstein.

987
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,807
Delivers all
the society babies.

988
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:49,017
Abe Sapirstein?

989
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,102
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

990
00:55:51,186 --> 00:55:53,146
Wasn't he on Open End
a couple of years ago?

991
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:54,147
That's right.

992
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,399
Ro?

993
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,943
Uh...
well, what about Dr. Hill?

994
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:00,612
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.

995
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:01,905
You know me.

996
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:04,115
Listen, I won't let you
go to no Dr. Hill

997
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,617
nobody ever heard of.

998
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,660
The best is what you're going to have,
young lady.

999
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:09,162
Where's your telephone, huh?

1000
00:56:09,204 --> 00:56:10,622
It's in the bedroom.

1001
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:11,915
He's a brilliant man.

1002
00:56:11,998 --> 00:56:13,124
Very sensitive.

1003
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:15,168
Ro, sit down, sit down.

1004
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,628
No, I'm fine.

1005
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:19,047
Abe, Minnie. Fine.

1006
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,548
Listen, Abe,
a dear friend of ours

1007
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:22,884
just found out today
she's pregnant.

1008
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:25,803
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.

1009
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:28,014
We told her you'd be glad
to take care of her.

1010
00:56:28,097 --> 00:56:31,267
You wouldn't charge her none of
your fancy society prices neither.

1011
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:32,811
Well, just wait a minute.

1012
00:56:32,852 --> 00:56:35,230
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?

1013
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:36,189
All right.

1014
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:37,774
Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe.

1015
00:56:37,857 --> 00:56:40,944
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, you, too.

1016
00:56:41,027 --> 00:56:43,071
No, no, no, no,
not at all.

1017
00:56:43,154 --> 00:56:44,322
All right.
Well, let's hope so.

1018
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:46,074
Goodbye.

1019
00:56:46,157 --> 00:56:47,992
Well, there you are.

1020
00:56:48,076 --> 00:56:49,536
Thanks a million, Minnie.

1021
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:51,371
I don't know how to thank you.
Both of you.

1022
00:56:51,454 --> 00:56:53,832
Just have a fine,
healthy baby, that's all.

1023
00:56:54,874 --> 00:56:57,961
My, I can't wait to tell
Laura-Louise.

1024
00:56:58,002 --> 00:56:59,212
Oh...

1025
00:56:59,295 --> 00:57:02,590
uh, please don't tell anyone else,
not right away.

1026
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:05,134
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.

1027
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,054
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.

1028
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:10,139
-Hear, hear.
-Hear!

1029
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:13,017
Andy.

1030
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:17,438
or Susan.

1031
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:20,441
Susan.

1032
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,989
Please don't read books.

1033
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:11,910
No pregnancy was ever exactly
like the ones described in the books.

1034
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:15,413
And don't listen
to your friends, either.

1035
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:18,666
No two pregnancies
are ever alike.

1036
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:22,253
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
-No pills.

1037
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:25,215
Minnie Castavet
has a herbarium.

1038
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:27,342
I'm going to have her
make a daily drink for you

1039
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:29,677
that'll be fresher, safer,
and more vitamin-rich

1040
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:32,096
than any pills
on the market.

1041
00:58:33,306 --> 00:58:35,850
Any questions you have,
call me night or day.

1042
00:58:35,934 --> 00:58:38,812
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

1043
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:41,439
-Here.
-What's in it?

1044
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:44,359
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.

1045
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:46,319
That's fine,
but what if we want a girl?

1046
00:58:46,402 --> 00:58:47,612
Do you?

1047
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,490
It would be nice if the first one
were a boy.

1048
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:54,160
Well, there you are.

1049
00:58:55,411 --> 00:58:57,497
No, really, what is in it?

1050
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,207
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.

1051
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,792
Tannis root?

1052
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:03,670
Some of that along
with some other things.

1053
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:07,131
Don't be so violent, Harry.
If you want to be stupid,

1054
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:08,716
be nonviolent stupid,

1055
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,261
I'm in love with no one.

1056
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:13,221
Especially not
your fat wife.

1057
00:59:13,304 --> 00:59:15,557
I'm a hopeless cripple...

1058
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:19,352
What's that?

1059
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:22,981
I-I've been
to Vidal Sassoon.

1060
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:26,484
Don't tell me
you paid for that.

1061
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,069
Guy,

1062
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:29,654
I have a pain.

1063
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:30,697
Where?

1064
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,990
Here.

1065
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:33,449
Just now?

1066
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:34,784
Since Monday.

1067
00:59:35,451 --> 00:59:36,661
A sharp pain.

1068
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:38,037
Did you see Sapirstein?

1069
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:39,497
I'm seeing him
on Wednesday.

1070
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:40,665
This is ridiculous.

1071
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,083
Why don't you see Sapirstein?

1072
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,543
Why didn't you say anything?

1073
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:45,795
I see him Wednesday
regular.

1074
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,548
An entirely natural
expansion of the pelvis.

1075
00:59:48,631 --> 00:59:50,258
You can fight it
with ordinary aspirin.

1076
00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:52,927
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

1077
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:54,220
Ectopic?

1078
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,723
I thought you weren't
going to read books, Rosemary.

1079
00:59:56,806 --> 01:00:00,059
-It was staring at me in the drugstore.
-All it did was worry you.

1080
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:02,353
Will you go home
and throw it away, please?

1081
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:04,606
The pains will
be gone in two days.

1082
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:07,692
Ectopic pregnancy!

1083
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,279
I look awful.

1084
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:57,575
What are you talking about?
You look great!

1085
01:00:57,408 --> 01:01:00,203
It's that haircut
that looks awful.

1086
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:01,329
You want the truth, honey,

1087
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:04,332
that's the worst mistake
you ever made.

1088
01:01:38,575 --> 01:01:39,450
My God!

1089
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:43,204
It's Vidal Sassoon.
It's very in.

1090
01:01:43,288 --> 01:01:44,914
What's wrong with you?

1091
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:46,457
Do I look that bad?

1092
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:47,584
Terrible!

1093
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,836
You're not on one
Of those Zen diets, are you?

1094
01:01:49,919 --> 01:01:50,837
No.

1095
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,005
Then what is it?

1096
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:53,256
Have you seen a doctor?

1097
01:01:54,132 --> 01:01:58,011
Hutch, I might
as well tell you.

1098
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:56,509
I'm pregnant.

1099
01:01:56,593 --> 01:01:57,719
Oh, rubbish.

1100
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:01,514
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

1101
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:03,183
I don't sleep well.

1102
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:06,144
I have stiff joints or something,
so I get a pain.

1103
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:07,187
Nothing serious.

1104
01:02:07,896 --> 01:02:09,939
Well, congratulations.

1105
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:11,733
You must be very happy.

1106
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:14,027
Oh, I am.
We both are.

1107
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:15,904
Who's your obstetrician?

1108
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:17,697
Abraham Sapirstein.

1109
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:21,075
Oh! He delivered two
of my daughter's babies.

1110
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:22,911
He's one of the best
in the city.

1111
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:24,204
When did you
see him last?

1112
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:25,705
Um, yesterday.

1113
01:02:25,747 --> 01:02:26,664
And?

1114
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,958
And he says
it's fairly common.

1115
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,295
How much weight
have you lost?

1116
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,632
Uh, 3 pounds.

1117
01:02:35,715 --> 01:02:37,675
Nonsense. You've lost
far more than that.

1118
01:02:38,301 --> 01:02:40,553
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.

1119
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:42,180
Later on, I'll be gaining.

1120
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:43,681
Well...

1121
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:47,644
we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
knows where of he speaks.

1122
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:49,687
He should.
He charges enough.

1123
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,189
We're getting
bargain rates.

1124
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:53,191
Our neighbors are
close friends of his.

1125
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:55,026
I'll go.

1126
01:02:55,068 --> 01:02:55,985
Stay where you are.

1127
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:58,363
It hurts less
when I move around.

1128
01:03:00,865 --> 01:03:03,117
Oh, I was just
talking about you.

1129
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:04,369
Favorably, I hope.

1130
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,870
Do you need anything
from outside?

1131
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:07,497
No. Thank you for asking.

1132
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,998
Is Guy home already?

1133
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:10,792
He won't be home till 6:00.

1134
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:11,793
Oh.

1135
01:03:11,876 --> 01:03:14,546
A friend of ours is here.

1136
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:16,840
Would you--
would you like to meet him?

1137
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:18,716
If I won't
be intruding.

1138
01:03:18,716 --> 01:03:20,218
No. Please come in.

1139
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:34,357
Hutch, this is Roman Castavet.

1140
01:03:34,649 --> 01:03:35,608
Edward Hutchins.

1141
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,651
How do you do?

1142
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:37,777
Oh, how are you, sir?

1143
01:03:37,819 --> 01:03:39,696
I was just telling Hutch
that it was you and Minnie

1144
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:41,114
who sent me
to Dr. Sapirstein.

1145
01:03:41,156 --> 01:03:43,199
Oh, so Rosemary has told you
the good news.

1146
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:44,284
Yes, she has.

1147
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:46,161
We must see that
she gets plenty of rest.

1148
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:48,371
I was a bit alarmed
by her appearance.

1149
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:50,081
Well, she has lost
some weight,

1150
01:03:50,123 --> 01:03:52,083
but that's quite normal
for the early months.

1151
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,003
Later on, she'll gain,
probably far too much.

1152
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:56,004
So I gather.

1153
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:57,547
Please sit down.

1154
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,466
Mrs. Castavet makes
a vitamin drink for me every day

1155
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,010
from fresh herbs
she grows.

1156
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:04,888
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's
directions, of course.

1157
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:06,931
He's inclined
to be suspicious

1158
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:09,517
of commercially prepared
vitamin pills.

1159
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:11,978
Indeed?
But surely they're manufactured

1160
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:13,521
under every imaginable
safeguard.

1161
01:04:13,605 --> 01:04:15,857
That's quite true,
but commercial pills

1162
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,942
can sit for months
on a druggist's shelf

1163
01:04:18,026 --> 01:04:20,737
and lose a great deal
of their original potency.

1164
01:04:20,778 --> 01:04:21,905
I hadn't thought of that.

1165
01:04:21,946 --> 01:04:24,407
I like the idea of having everything
fresh and natural.

1166
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:28,411
I'll bet expectant mothers
chewed bits of tannis root

1167
01:04:28,495 --> 01:04:30,497
when nobody'd even heard
of vitamin pills.

1168
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:31,581
Tannis root?

1169
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:33,625
It's one of the herbs
she puts in the drink.

1170
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,960
Or is it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?

1171
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:38,630
You sure you don't mean anise
or orris root?

1172
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:39,631
No, tannis.

1173
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:43,426
Look.

1174
01:04:45,136 --> 01:04:47,847
It's good luck, too.

1175
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:49,974
Ish!

1176
01:04:51,976 --> 01:04:54,479
Doesn't look like,
uh, root matter,

1177
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:57,148
more like mold or fungus
of some kind.

1178
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:00,318
Is it ever called
by any other name?

1179
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:02,320
Not to my knowledge, no.

1180
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:06,950
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopedia.

1181
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:09,828
What a pretty holder
or charm or whatever it is.

1182
01:05:09,911 --> 01:05:11,329
The Castavets gave it to me.

1183
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,872
You and your wife

1184
01:05:12,914 --> 01:05:14,666
seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary

1185
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:15,750
than her own parents.

1186
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:18,336
We're very fond of her.
And of Guy, too.

1187
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:20,463
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to go.

1188
01:05:20,547 --> 01:05:22,257
My wife is waiting for me.

1189
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,675
It's a pleasure
to have met you.

1190
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:25,093
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.

1191
01:05:25,218 --> 01:05:27,720
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

1192
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:32,517
I just noticed
he has pierced ears.

1193
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:36,229
Pierced ears
and piercing eyes.

1194
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:37,981
What's she like?

1195
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:41,317
Nosy.
Funny.

1196
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,111
Guy's gotten
very close to them.

1197
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:44,612
I suppose they've become

1198
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:47,031
sort of parent figures for him.

1199
01:05:48,783 --> 01:05:49,993
And you?

1200
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:52,620
I--I don't know.

1201
01:05:52,745 --> 01:05:55,540
Sometimes I think they're too friendly
and helpful.

1202
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,751
Hey, what a surprise.

1203
01:05:58,793 --> 01:05:59,836
How are you, Hutch?
Good to see you.

1204
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:01,171
You're the surprise.
What happened?

1205
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:03,840
They stopped for a rewrite,
those dumb bastards.

1206
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:06,718
Ah, stay where you are.
Nobody move.

1207
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:08,386
Would you like some coffee?

1208
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:09,470
Love some!

1209
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:16,102
Loot!

1210
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:18,813
Seems congratulations
are in order.

1211
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:20,064
Yeah, it's wonderful,
isn't it?

1212
01:06:20,148 --> 01:06:21,232
When's the baby due?

1213
01:06:21,316 --> 01:06:22,567
June 28th.

1214
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,402
Did you know
that Dr. Sapirstein

1215
01:06:24,444 --> 01:06:26,654
delivered two of
Hutch's grandchildren?

1216
01:06:26,738 --> 01:06:27,989
-Really?
-Mmm.

1217
01:06:28,072 --> 01:06:29,532
I met your neighbor.

1218
01:06:29,574 --> 01:06:30,533
Roman Castavet.

1219
01:06:30,575 --> 01:06:32,035
Oh, did you?

1220
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:33,453
Funny old duck,
isn't he?

1221
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:35,538
Did you ever notice
he has pierced ears?

1222
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,916
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not. I saw.

1223
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:39,918
It's a shame we haven't
seen more of you lately,

1224
01:06:39,959 --> 01:06:43,171
but with me being so busy
and Ro being the way she is,

1225
01:06:43,254 --> 01:06:44,422
we really haven't
seen anyone.

1226
01:06:44,464 --> 01:06:46,257
Perhaps we can have dinner
together soon.

1227
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:47,258
You're not going,
are you?

1228
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,593
Thanks for the coffee, my dear.

1229
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:50,637
Thank you for coming,
my dear.

1230
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:57,769
This isn't mine.
It must be yours, right?

1231
01:06:57,852 --> 01:06:58,853
Right you are.

1232
01:06:58,937 --> 01:07:01,314
Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?

1233
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,149
Andrew or Douglas
if it's a boy,

1234
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:04,651
Melinda or Sarah
if it's a girl.

1235
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:05,985
Sarah? What happened to Susan?

1236
01:07:06,027 --> 01:07:08,112
Say, is there another
of these around?

1237
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:09,656
Oh.

1238
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:15,703
I don't see it, Hutch.

1239
01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:17,580
No, it's not here.

1240
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:19,874
I probably left it
at the City Center.

1241
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,334
I'll stop back there.

1242
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:23,086
Let's really have that dinner,
shall we?

1243
01:07:23,127 --> 01:07:24,087
Definitely.

1244
01:07:24,128 --> 01:07:25,088
Next week.

1245
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:26,089
Bye.

1246
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,090
Goodbye.

1247
01:07:27,131 --> 01:07:28,091
- Bye.
- Bye.

1248
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,892
It was a nice surprise.

1249
01:07:37,976 --> 01:07:40,228
Guess what he said.

1250
01:07:40,979 --> 01:07:41,896
What?

1251
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,398
I look terrible.

1252
01:07:44,315 --> 01:07:45,150
Good old Hutch.

1253
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:47,277
He's spreading cheer
wherever he goes.

1254
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,529
I'm going to get a paper,
honey.

1255
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:52,407
He's a professional crepehanger.

1256
01:07:52,365 --> 01:07:54,075
He's not a professional
crepehanger.

1257
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:56,119
Then he's one of the top-ranking
amateurs.

1258
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:09,257
Hello.

1259
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,051
Oh, uh, she's not
feeling too well.

1260
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:15,096
Well, I think she's asleep.

1261
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,431
All right.

1262
01:08:17,474 --> 01:08:20,393
Oh, she could be, yeah.

1263
01:08:20,477 --> 01:08:22,937
All right,
can you hold on a minute?

1264
01:08:26,065 --> 01:08:27,859
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.

1265
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:28,943
Oh.

1266
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:33,698
I told him you were resting,
but he said he couldn't wait.

1267
01:08:40,413 --> 01:08:41,247
Hutch?

1268
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:43,708
Tell me, dear,
do you go out at all?

1269
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:47,337
Well, I--I haven't been going out,
why?

1270
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,422
Can you meet me
tomorrow morning at 11:00

1271
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:51,633
in front of
the Time-Life building?

1272
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:53,259
Yes, if you want me to.

1273
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:55,553
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?

1274
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:56,805
I'd rather not.

1275
01:08:56,846 --> 01:08:59,098
We can have an early lunch
if you like.

1276
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:00,225
That would be nice.

1277
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:01,226
Good. 11:00 then?

1278
01:09:01,309 --> 01:09:02,227
O.K.

1279
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,728
Oh, did you find your glove?

1280
01:09:03,812 --> 01:09:05,063
No, they didn't have it.

1281
01:09:05,146 --> 01:09:06,648
Good night, Rosemary.
Sleep well.

1282
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:08,566
You, too.
Good night.

1283
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:10,568
What was that?

1284
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,153
He wants to talk to me.

1285
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:13,154
What about?

1286
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:14,906
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.

1287
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:17,367
I think those
boys' adventure stories

1288
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:18,910
are going to his head.

1289
01:09:21,246 --> 01:09:22,872
Where are you meeting him?

1290
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:26,960
Uh, Time and Life building
tomorrow at 11:00.

1291
01:09:29,629 --> 01:09:30,922
This is ridiculous.

1292
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:33,299
You're pregnant,
I've got the yens.

1293
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:34,759
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?

1294
01:09:34,843 --> 01:09:36,344
Yeah, I'd love one.

1295
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:37,470
Vanilla?

1296
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:38,471
O.K.

1297
01:09:38,596 --> 01:09:39,514
O.K.

1298
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:02,871
Hi.

1299
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:04,122
Minnie, I'm going out now,

1300
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:05,874
so I won't have
my drink at 11:00.

1301
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:07,458
That's fine, dear.
Take it later.

1302
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,460
Buzz me when you get back,
huh?

1303
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:40,366
Pain, be gone.
I will have no more of thee.

1304
01:11:15,652 --> 01:11:16,778
Yes?

1305
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:18,738
Is this Edward Hutchins'
apartment?

1306
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:20,073
Yes. Who is this, please?

1307
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:22,158
My name is
Rosemary Woodhouse.

1308
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,868
I had an appointment
with Mr. Hutchins.

1309
01:11:23,952 --> 01:11:26,329
Is he there?

1310
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:27,330
Hello?

1311
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:30,458
He was taken ill
this morning.

1312
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:32,669
-Taken ill?
-Yes.

1313
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,338
He's in a deep coma at St. Vincent's
hospital.

1314
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:37,423
That's awful.

1315
01:11:37,507 --> 01:11:41,594
I--I--I just spoke to him
last night about 10:30.

1316
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:43,304
I spoke to him
at 11:00.

1317
01:11:43,346 --> 01:11:44,806
Who is this?

1318
01:11:44,848 --> 01:11:46,266
You don't know me,
Rosemary.

1319
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:48,101
I'm Grace Cardiff,
Hutch's friend.

1320
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:51,020
Um, do they know
what's causing it?

1321
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:52,772
No, they don't know yet.

1322
01:11:52,856 --> 01:11:54,983
At the moment, he's
totally unresponsive.

1323
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:58,319
Oh, I'm going
to the hospital now.

1324
01:11:58,361 --> 01:11:59,779
Is there anything
I can do?

1325
01:11:59,863 --> 01:12:00,905
Not really.

1326
01:12:02,323 --> 01:12:04,367
All right, um,
thank you.

1327
01:12:32,937 --> 01:12:34,189
No!

1328
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,941
This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

1329
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:42,363
I said to myself,
as long as Rosemary's going out,

1330
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:45,408
I might as well go out and do
a little bit of Christmas shopping.

1331
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,870
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?

1332
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:51,247
Aw, darling,
what's the matter?

1333
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:53,666
You feel all right?

1334
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,920
Aw...
aw, you poor thing.

1335
01:12:56,961 --> 01:12:58,463
You know
what I think?

1336
01:12:58,505 --> 01:13:00,340
I think we better
be going home now.

1337
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:01,424
What do you say?

1338
01:13:01,508 --> 01:13:03,343
No, no, you have
your shopping to do.

1339
01:13:03,384 --> 01:13:05,678
Ah, shoot,
there's two more weeks.

1340
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:25,031
It'll stop any day now.

1341
01:13:25,073 --> 01:13:28,451
It's like a wire inside me
getting tighter and tighter.

1342
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:31,538
Usually older women
with less flexible joints

1343
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:33,540
have this sort of trouble.

1344
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:34,999
I'm not going out anymore.

1345
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:36,084
You don't have to.

1346
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,336
One minute to go!

1347
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:42,048
Rosemary,
I want you to meet Dr. Shand.

1348
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,342
He used to be
a famous dentist.

1349
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:46,302
He made the chain
For your charm.

1350
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:47,804
Oh, how do you do?

1351
01:13:47,887 --> 01:13:49,305
Come on, sweetie.

1352
01:13:49,389 --> 01:13:51,015
Put this wonderful hat on.

1353
01:13:51,099 --> 01:13:53,226
Doctor, come over here.

1354
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:54,227
Minnie, Minnie.

1355
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:55,728
Happy New Year.

1356
01:13:55,812 --> 01:13:57,856
Have a good year.

1357
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,357
Happy New Year.

1358
01:14:01,985 --> 01:14:04,487
To 1966!

1359
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:06,614
The Year 1 !

1360
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,919
What the hell are you doing?

1361
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,004
Planning the menu.

1362
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:06,966
We're having a party
a week from Saturday.

1363
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,593
It's for our old--

1364
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:10,553
I mean, our young friends.

1365
01:15:10,595 --> 01:15:12,722
Minnie and Roman
are not invited.

1366
01:15:12,806 --> 01:15:14,766
Neither is Laura-Louise.

1367
01:15:14,808 --> 01:15:16,476
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.

1368
01:15:16,559 --> 01:15:18,061
It's going to be
a very special party.

1369
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:20,480
You have to be
under 60 to get in.

1370
01:15:26,611 --> 01:15:27,862
Well.

1371
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:29,280
For a minute there,

1372
01:15:29,364 --> 01:15:31,074
I didn't think
I was going to make it.

1373
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:32,617
You'll make it,
all right.

1374
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:34,118
You can be bartender.

1375
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,787
Oh, swell.

1376
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:38,540
Do you really think
it's such a good idea?

1377
01:15:38,581 --> 01:15:41,125
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.

1378
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:44,128
Don't you think you ought to check
with Dr. Sapirstein first?

1379
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:46,214
What for?
I'm just giving a party.

1380
01:15:46,297 --> 01:15:48,132
I'm not going to swim
the English Channel.

1381
01:15:48,174 --> 01:15:49,634
What about the pain?

1382
01:15:51,427 --> 01:15:52,887
Oh, haven't you heard?

1383
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:54,806
It'll go away
in a day or two.

1384
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:57,392
That looks interesting.
What's it for?

1385
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:59,394
We're having some people
over on Saturday.

1386
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:01,729
Oh, you feel up
to entertaining?

1387
01:16:01,813 --> 01:16:03,398
Yes, I do.
These are old friends

1388
01:16:03,481 --> 01:16:04,941
I haven't seen
in a long time.

1389
01:16:05,066 --> 01:16:07,068
They don't even know yet
that I'm pregnant.

1390
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:08,444
I'll give you a hand
if you like.

1391
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,029
I'll help you
dish things out.

1392
01:16:10,155 --> 01:16:12,240
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

1393
01:16:12,323 --> 01:16:13,992
It's going
to be a buffet,

1394
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:15,827
and we're getting
a bartender, so...

1395
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:17,245
I'll help you
take the coats.

1396
01:16:17,328 --> 01:16:21,207
No, really,
you do too much for me as it is.

1397
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:25,587
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

1398
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:27,380
Drink your drink now.

1399
01:16:27,422 --> 01:16:28,882
I'd rather not.

1400
01:16:29,591 --> 01:16:31,176
Not right this minute.

1401
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:33,261
I'll drink it
in a little while.

1402
01:16:33,344 --> 01:16:34,929
It don't do
to let it stand.

1403
01:16:35,013 --> 01:16:36,514
No, I won't wait too long.

1404
01:16:36,598 --> 01:16:39,309
You go on back, and I'll bring
the glass back to you later.

1405
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:40,894
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.

1406
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:43,313
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous

1407
01:16:43,396 --> 01:16:44,731
when people
watch me cook.

1408
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:45,732
Now, scoot.

1409
01:16:45,773 --> 01:16:47,358
Don't let it
stand too long.

1410
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:49,360
It's going to lose its vitamins.

1411
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:04,167
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!

1412
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:06,461
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1413
01:17:07,879 --> 01:17:09,339
-Hey, Rosie.
-Yeah?

1414
01:17:09,422 --> 01:17:11,466
Bob and Leo got stuck
at another party, dear,

1415
01:17:11,508 --> 01:17:12,926
but they'll be over
right away.

1416
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:13,885
Oh, fine.

1417
01:17:14,135 --> 01:17:17,472
Oh Rosie, you're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.

1418
01:17:20,183 --> 01:17:22,894
Hi.
It's been so long!

1419
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:26,147
You look like
a piece of chalk!

1420
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:28,858
You make him
feed you, luv.

1421
01:17:31,653 --> 01:17:34,280
-Adrian Marcato lived here.
- Yeah, and the Trench sisters.

1422
01:17:34,322 --> 01:17:36,449
-Trent sisters?
-Trench. They ate little children.

1423
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:39,077
He doesn't just mean
they ate them.

1424
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,412
He means
they ate them.

1425
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,795
I made their first one strong
to get them happy,

1426
01:17:48,878 --> 01:17:50,463
then I go light
and conserve, eh?

1427
01:17:50,547 --> 01:17:54,634
Rosie, do you feel O.K.?
You look a little tired.

1428
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:56,970
Thanks for the understatement.

1429
01:17:59,764 --> 01:18:02,100
How do you like C.C. Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

1430
01:18:02,183 --> 01:18:04,018
Mm-hmm, but I--I--

1431
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,353
I'm not going to him.

1432
01:18:06,271 --> 01:18:07,272
You're not?

1433
01:18:07,355 --> 01:18:11,234
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein, an older man.

1434
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:12,735
Oh, congratulations, Papa.

1435
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:14,320
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.

1436
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:15,864
Ro, I'm going to take
that dip inside.

1437
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:18,700
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?

1438
01:18:18,783 --> 01:18:19,742
Yeah.

1439
01:18:20,243 --> 01:18:21,786
Elise, will you give me a hand?

1440
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:23,329
Oh, yeah, sure.

1441
01:18:28,918 --> 01:18:30,128
Hey, whatever happened
to the other guy?

1442
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,630
-Is he still blind?
-Donald Baumgart?

1443
01:18:32,672 --> 01:18:34,048
Well, you know who he is.

1444
01:18:34,132 --> 01:18:35,800
He's the boy that Zoe Piper
lives with.

1445
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:37,343
He's writing a play.

1446
01:18:37,385 --> 01:18:38,845
-Is he still blind?
-Excuse me.

1447
01:18:39,637 --> 01:18:40,972
Yeah. He's going through hell

1448
01:18:41,014 --> 01:18:42,807
trying to make
the adjustment.

1449
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:44,851
He dictates
and Zoe writes.

1450
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:54,319
Are you all right?

1451
01:18:56,613 --> 01:18:58,031
Yeah, I'm fine.

1452
01:18:58,114 --> 01:19:00,325
I just had a cramp
for a minute.

1453
01:19:00,366 --> 01:19:01,326
Don't cry.

1454
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:03,703
It's all right. It's good for her.
Let her cry it out.

1455
01:19:03,745 --> 01:19:05,371
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.

1456
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:06,915
Sit down, sit down.

1457
01:19:12,795 --> 01:19:14,756
-Hey, let me in.
-Sorry, girls only.

1458
01:19:14,839 --> 01:19:16,925
-I want to talk to Rosemary.
-You can't. She's busy.

1459
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:18,009
I have to wash these--

1460
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,260
Use the bathroom.

1461
01:19:24,349 --> 01:19:25,809
It hurts so much!

1462
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:28,102
I'm so afraid
the baby's gonna die.

1463
01:19:28,144 --> 01:19:30,563
When did the pain start?

1464
01:19:30,605 --> 01:19:32,065
Um...

1465
01:19:32,106 --> 01:19:34,067
in, uh, November.

1466
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:35,568
November?

1467
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:36,569
What?

1468
01:19:36,653 --> 01:19:39,072
You have been in pain
since November,

1469
01:19:39,113 --> 01:19:41,074
and he's not doing anything
to help you?

1470
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:43,076
He says it's gonna stop.

1471
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,495
Why don't you go
to see another doctor?

1472
01:19:45,537 --> 01:19:46,996
No, he's very good.

1473
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:49,833
He was on Open End.

1474
01:19:49,874 --> 01:19:52,335
He sounds like
a sadistic nut.

1475
01:19:52,377 --> 01:19:54,337
Rosemary,
pain like that

1476
01:19:54,379 --> 01:19:57,841
is a warning that
something isn't right.

1477
01:19:57,882 --> 01:19:59,843
Go see Dr. Hill.

1478
01:19:59,884 --> 01:20:02,345
Go see anybody
besides that...that...

1479
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:03,346
That nut.

1480
01:20:03,388 --> 01:20:05,640
You can't go on
suffering like this.

1481
01:20:05,723 --> 01:20:07,183
I won't have
an abortion.

1482
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:09,185
Nobody's telling you
to have an abortion.

1483
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:11,896
Just go to see another doctor,
that's all.

1484
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:23,908
The thing to do now
is move.

1485
01:20:23,992 --> 01:20:24,909
Guy?

1486
01:20:24,993 --> 01:20:25,994
Yeah?

1487
01:20:26,077 --> 01:20:29,539
I'm going to Dr. Hill
Monday morning.

1488
01:20:30,456 --> 01:20:33,668
Dr. Sapirstein is either lying,
or he's...

1489
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:35,920
I don't know,
out of his mind.

1490
01:20:36,004 --> 01:20:38,423
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

1491
01:20:38,506 --> 01:20:39,549
Rosemary...

1492
01:20:39,632 --> 01:20:42,427
and I'm not drinking
Minnie's drink anymore.

1493
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:45,472
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.

1494
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,600
I haven't drunk it
for the last three days.

1495
01:20:48,683 --> 01:20:49,726
I've thrown it away.

1496
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:50,685
You've what?

1497
01:20:50,768 --> 01:20:52,729
I've made
my own drink.

1498
01:20:54,355 --> 01:20:57,108
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

1499
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:00,153
And is that
their hint for today?

1500
01:21:00,195 --> 01:21:01,196
They're my friends--

1501
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:03,615
They're a bunch of
not very bright bitches

1502
01:21:03,698 --> 01:21:05,783
who ought to mind
their own goddamn business!

1503
01:21:05,825 --> 01:21:08,244
All they said was
get a second opinion.

1504
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:09,746
Rosemary, you got the best doctor
in New York.

1505
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:11,206
You know
who Dr. Hill is?

1506
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:12,707
He's a Charlie Nobody.

1507
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:13,917
That's who he is!

1508
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:17,712
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr. Sapirstein is.

1509
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:20,882
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein,
we'll have to pay Hill.

1510
01:21:20,924 --> 01:21:22,342
It's out of
the question.

1511
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:23,843
No, I'm not changing.

1512
01:21:23,927 --> 01:21:26,888
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill
and get a second opinion.

1513
01:21:27,138 --> 01:21:29,057
I won't let you do it, Ro.

1514
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,059
I mean,
because it's, uh...

1515
01:21:31,142 --> 01:21:33,561
it's not fair
to Sapirstein.

1516
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:36,064
Not fair to...

1517
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:38,066
What are you
talking about?

1518
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:40,360
What about
what's fair to me?

1519
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:41,820
You want
a second opinion?

1520
01:21:41,903 --> 01:21:45,949
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.

1521
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,409
No! I want Dr. Hill!

1522
01:21:48,493 --> 01:21:50,411
At least have
that much courtesy--

1523
01:21:50,495 --> 01:21:52,914
If you won't pay,
then I'll...

1524
01:21:56,084 --> 01:21:58,002
Ro?

1525
01:21:58,044 --> 01:21:59,462
Rosemary?

1526
01:21:59,546 --> 01:22:00,964
What is it?

1527
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,259
It stopped.

1528
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:06,511
What?

1529
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:09,013
The pain stopped
just like that.

1530
01:22:09,097 --> 01:22:10,932
Stopped?
-Stopped.

1531
01:22:13,017 --> 01:22:15,937
What was in
that drink you made?

1532
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:18,481
Uh...

1533
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:22,110
eggs, milk, sug--

1534
01:22:22,193 --> 01:22:23,611
sugar.

1535
01:22:23,695 --> 01:22:25,113
What else?

1536
01:22:28,283 --> 01:22:29,701
What else?

1537
01:22:29,784 --> 01:22:34,706
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?

1538
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,250
It's alive!

1539
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,252
Guy, it's moving!

1540
01:22:39,294 --> 01:22:41,754
It's alive!
It's all right!

1541
01:22:41,796 --> 01:22:42,755
Feel.

1542
01:22:42,839 --> 01:22:43,756
Feel.

1543
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,258
Oh, yeah, I felt it.

1544
01:22:45,341 --> 01:22:47,177
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.

1545
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,679
It's wonderful.
It really is.

1546
01:22:49,762 --> 01:22:51,681
I feel it kicking.

1547
01:22:51,764 --> 01:22:53,183
It's alive!

1548
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:55,185
It's moving!

1549
01:22:59,272 --> 01:23:02,192
I'll, uh, clean up
some of this mess.

1550
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:20,668
Watch the walls.

1551
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:31,679
Thanks, boys.
Have one on the baby.

1552
01:23:31,721 --> 01:23:33,181
Thank you very much.

1553
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:03,962
What's that for?

1554
01:24:04,003 --> 01:24:06,464
This is
my hospital suitcase.

1555
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:08,967
Honey,
you got three weeks.

1556
01:24:14,973 --> 01:24:15,890
Yes?

1557
01:24:15,974 --> 01:24:17,892
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.

1558
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:21,396
No.

1559
01:24:22,981 --> 01:24:24,399
Oh, my God.

1560
01:24:26,484 --> 01:24:27,902
Oh, my God.

1561
01:24:27,986 --> 01:24:30,405
Yes, of course I will.

1562
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,835
Hutch is dead.

1563
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:50,884
I feel awful.

1564
01:24:50,967 --> 01:24:54,387
All this time,
I didn't even think of him.

1565
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:17,243
Doris, we'll see you later.

1566
01:25:17,327 --> 01:25:18,745
I beg your pardon.

1567
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:21,247
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

1568
01:25:21,331 --> 01:25:22,749
Oh, so you're Rosemary.

1569
01:25:22,832 --> 01:25:23,750
I'm terribly sorry.

1570
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,793
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.

1571
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:26,753
How do you do?

1572
01:25:26,836 --> 01:25:28,254
And my husband.

1573
01:25:28,338 --> 01:25:29,255
How do you do?

1574
01:25:29,339 --> 01:25:30,256
I'm sorry to be late.

1575
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,257
Excuse me.

1576
01:25:31,341 --> 01:25:32,258
Yes?

1577
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:33,259
I'm Grace Cardiff.

1578
01:25:33,343 --> 01:25:34,761
I was hoping to meet you.

1579
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:36,262
Thank you for calling me.

1580
01:25:36,346 --> 01:25:37,388
I was going to mail this,

1581
01:25:37,472 --> 01:25:38,765
but then I thought you
were going to be here.

1582
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,892
What is it?
-A book.

1583
01:25:40,975 --> 01:25:43,269
Hutch regained consciousness
at the end,

1584
01:25:43,353 --> 01:25:45,271
and he thought it was
the next morning.

1585
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:46,981
You know,
when you had the appointment.

1586
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:47,941
Oh, yes.

1587
01:25:49,025 --> 01:25:50,652
I wasn't there,
but he told the doctor

1588
01:25:50,693 --> 01:25:53,112
to make sure you got the book
that was on his desk.

1589
01:25:53,196 --> 01:25:54,531
Thank you.

1590
01:25:55,949 --> 01:25:57,951
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.

1591
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,744
The name of the book?

1592
01:26:00,286 --> 01:26:01,538
Apparently.

1593
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:04,916
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.

1594
01:26:29,983 --> 01:26:30,942
I heard you come in.

1595
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:32,402
It certainly
wasn't very long.

1596
01:26:32,485 --> 01:26:34,154
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.

1597
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:35,613
Oh, what a shame.

1598
01:26:35,697 --> 01:26:37,615
Oh, you got mail already?

1599
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:39,617
Somebody gave it to me.

1600
01:26:39,701 --> 01:26:42,120
Here. I'll hold it.

1601
01:26:42,203 --> 01:26:43,830
Book.

1602
01:26:44,914 --> 01:26:47,959
Oh, I know that house.
The Gilmores used to live there.

1603
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:49,544
Oh?
-Yeah.

1604
01:26:49,752 --> 01:26:51,337
I've been there
lots of times.

1605
01:26:51,421 --> 01:26:53,840
Grace-- That's one
of my favorite names.

1606
01:26:53,923 --> 01:26:54,841
Yes.

1607
01:26:54,924 --> 01:26:56,342
You need anything?

1608
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:57,343
Nothing, thank you.

1609
01:26:57,427 --> 01:26:58,344
Take a nap,
why don't you?

1610
01:26:58,428 --> 01:26:59,345
I'm going to.

1611
01:26:59,429 --> 01:27:00,346
Yeah. Goodbye.

1612
01:27:42,597 --> 01:27:45,016
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1613
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:47,519
He was soon after
brought to New York.

1614
01:27:47,602 --> 01:27:50,522
He resided for several years
in the United St--

1615
01:27:50,605 --> 01:27:55,026
He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."

1616
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:58,571
Outside, not in the lobby.

1617
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:08,873
There are no witches.

1618
01:28:08,957 --> 01:28:10,333
Not really.

1619
01:28:13,419 --> 01:28:15,338
The name is an anagram.

1620
01:29:38,296 --> 01:29:40,423
Now, that really makes sense.

1621
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:43,927
Poor Hutch.

1622
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,317
Ro?

1623
01:30:45,905 --> 01:30:47,323
What's with the chain?

1624
01:30:51,077 --> 01:30:52,537
What's the matter?

1625
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,499
You all right?
-I'm fine.

1626
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,001
Oh.

1627
01:30:58,084 --> 01:30:59,544
Oh, why, thank you.

1628
01:30:59,586 --> 01:31:01,546
How was the funeral?

1629
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:02,714
O.K.

1630
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,258
Got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

1631
01:31:10,263 --> 01:31:12,056
I got that shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

1632
01:31:12,682 --> 01:31:14,100
That's nice.

1633
01:31:14,184 --> 01:31:16,102
Do you know
who Roman really is?

1634
01:31:16,186 --> 01:31:17,312
What do you mean,
honey?

1635
01:31:17,353 --> 01:31:18,771
He's Adrian Marcato's son.

1636
01:31:18,855 --> 01:31:19,772
What?

1637
01:31:19,856 --> 01:31:21,274
Come here.

1638
01:31:21,357 --> 01:31:24,277
I want to show you something.

1639
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:28,281
Roman Castavet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.

1640
01:31:29,866 --> 01:31:31,284
It's from Hutch.

1641
01:31:37,874 --> 01:31:38,791
Look.

1642
01:31:40,376 --> 01:31:41,794
And look here.

1643
01:31:41,878 --> 01:31:43,797
There he is when he was 13.

1644
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,298
See the eyes?

1645
01:31:47,884 --> 01:31:48,802
Coincidence.

1646
01:31:48,885 --> 01:31:50,303
In the same house?

1647
01:31:50,386 --> 01:31:51,805
And look. Look here.

1648
01:31:51,888 --> 01:31:54,307
"Soon after that
in August, 1886,

1649
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:56,309
his son Steven
was born."

1650
01:31:56,392 --> 01:31:57,811
1886. Got it?

1651
01:31:57,894 --> 01:31:59,813
That makes him 79 now.

1652
01:31:59,896 --> 01:32:01,314
No coincidence.

1653
01:32:06,402 --> 01:32:07,821
No, I guess not.

1654
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:11,825
He's Steven Marcato,
all right.

1655
01:32:11,908 --> 01:32:12,826
Poor old geezer.

1656
01:32:12,909 --> 01:32:14,118
With a crazy father
like that,

1657
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,579
no wonder he switched
his name around.

1658
01:32:16,663 --> 01:32:18,581
You don't think
he's the same?

1659
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:20,583
What do you mean,
a witch?

1660
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:22,085
Ro, are you kidding?

1661
01:32:22,168 --> 01:32:23,586
Oh, Ro, honey.

1662
01:32:25,338 --> 01:32:28,633
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?

1663
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:30,593
Honey, it's 1966.

1664
01:32:30,677 --> 01:32:33,429
This was published
in 1933.

1665
01:32:33,555 --> 01:32:34,764
There were covens
in Europe.

1666
01:32:34,806 --> 01:32:37,642
That's what they're called--
the congregation.

1667
01:32:38,059 --> 01:32:40,520
Covens in Europe, in America,
and in Australia,

1668
01:32:40,562 --> 01:32:42,981
and they have one right here,
that whole bunch.

1669
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:45,608
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,

1670
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:47,485
those are esbats or sabbaths
or whatever they're called.

1671
01:32:47,527 --> 01:32:48,653
Honey, don't get excited.

1672
01:32:48,695 --> 01:32:50,113
Read what they do, Guy.

1673
01:32:50,196 --> 01:32:52,115
They use blood
in their rituals.

1674
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:55,118
The blood that has the most power
is baby's blood.

1675
01:32:55,201 --> 01:32:57,120
And they don't just use the blood,
they use the flesh, too.

1676
01:32:57,203 --> 01:32:58,621
Rosemary,
for God's sakes!

1677
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,457
They're not setting foot
in this apartment ever again.

1678
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:03,960
They're not coming within 50 feet
of the baby.

1679
01:33:04,002 --> 01:33:04,919
They're old people.

1680
01:33:05,003 --> 01:33:06,421
They have a bunch
of old friends.

1681
01:33:06,504 --> 01:33:08,923
Dr. Shand happens
to play the recorder.

1682
01:33:09,007 --> 01:33:11,885
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.

1683
01:33:11,926 --> 01:33:13,386
We're gonna sublet
and move out.

1684
01:33:13,428 --> 01:33:14,888
We are not.
-Oh, yes we are!

1685
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:16,848
We'll talk about it later.

1686
01:33:19,934 --> 01:33:22,479
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1687
01:33:23,313 --> 01:33:25,857
-Just this last chapter.
-Not today, honey.

1688
01:33:27,025 --> 01:33:29,360
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.

1689
01:33:29,402 --> 01:33:31,196
Read it tomorrow.
-Guy!

1690
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:32,739
I mean it, now.

1691
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,240
Give it to me.

1692
01:33:41,664 --> 01:33:44,584
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

1693
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:46,294
What'd you say the name was,
"Marchado"?

1694
01:33:46,336 --> 01:33:47,462
Marcato.

1695
01:33:47,504 --> 01:33:49,881
He told me his father
was a coffee importer.

1696
01:33:50,131 --> 01:33:51,591
He told Guy
he was a producer.

1697
01:33:51,633 --> 01:33:53,343
I understand
how disturbed you must be

1698
01:33:53,384 --> 01:33:54,844
to have him for
a close neighbor.

1699
01:33:54,886 --> 01:33:57,347
I don't want anything more
to do with him or Minnie.

1700
01:33:57,388 --> 01:34:00,850
I can't take even the slightest chance
for the baby's sake.

1701
01:34:00,892 --> 01:34:03,353
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.

1702
01:34:03,394 --> 01:34:05,355
Is there
any chance at all

1703
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,357
that maybe Minnie put something
harmful in those drinks

1704
01:34:07,398 --> 01:34:08,858
or in those
little cakes?

1705
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:12,278
No, Rosemary, I'd have seen evidence
of it long ago.

1706
01:34:13,154 --> 01:34:14,906
I won't take anything else
from them.

1707
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:15,907
You won't have to.

1708
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:17,408
I can give you some pills

1709
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:20,411
that'll be adequate
these last few weeks.

1710
01:34:20,495 --> 01:34:23,414
In a way,
this may be the answer

1711
01:34:23,498 --> 01:34:25,416
to Minnie's and
Roman's problem, too.

1712
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,918
What do you mean?

1713
01:34:27,001 --> 01:34:28,419
Roman's very ill.

1714
01:34:28,503 --> 01:34:32,423
In fact, confidentially, he has
no more than a month or two left.

1715
01:34:32,507 --> 01:34:33,925
I had no idea.

1716
01:34:34,008 --> 01:34:36,427
He wanted to pay a last visit
to a few of his favorite cities.

1717
01:34:36,511 --> 01:34:37,428
They didn't want
to offend you

1718
01:34:37,512 --> 01:34:39,430
by leaving before
the baby's birth.

1719
01:34:40,056 --> 01:34:41,975
I'm sorry to hear
that Roman isn't well.

1720
01:34:42,058 --> 01:34:43,476
He'd be
extremely embarrassed

1721
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,979
if he knew
what you found out.

1722
01:34:46,062 --> 01:34:46,980
Suppose we do this.

1723
01:34:47,063 --> 01:34:48,565
I'll tell him
to leave on Sunday.

1724
01:34:48,606 --> 01:34:50,692
I'll say I spoke to you
and you understand.

1725
01:34:51,025 --> 01:34:53,444
Are you sure they'll
leave on Sunday?

1726
01:34:53,528 --> 01:34:54,946
I'll see to it.

1727
01:34:57,615 --> 01:34:59,075
No matter
where we are,

1728
01:34:59,117 --> 01:35:00,702
our thoughts are gonna be with you
every minute

1729
01:35:00,785 --> 01:35:03,037
till you're all
happy and thin again.

1730
01:35:03,121 --> 01:35:06,124
Your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.

1731
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:07,625
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1732
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,044
Yeah. You make Guy
send us lots of pictures, ya hear?

1733
01:35:10,128 --> 01:35:11,546
Yes, I will.

1734
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:13,047
Now, I'm not going
to wish you good luck

1735
01:35:13,131 --> 01:35:14,549
because you
won't need it.

1736
01:35:14,632 --> 01:35:17,051
You're going to have
a happy, happy life.

1737
01:35:17,135 --> 01:35:19,554
Have a good trip
and come back safely.

1738
01:35:19,637 --> 01:35:23,558
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara

1739
01:35:23,641 --> 01:35:25,101
or maybe Majorca.

1740
01:35:25,143 --> 01:35:27,103
We shall see,
we shall see.

1741
01:35:27,145 --> 01:35:28,104
Come back.

1742
01:35:28,146 --> 01:35:29,105
Bye, Minnie.

1743
01:35:29,147 --> 01:35:30,106
Yeah, goodbye.

1744
01:35:30,148 --> 01:35:31,566
Goodbye, Roman.
Bye-bye.

1745
01:35:31,691 --> 01:35:33,109
Take care now.

1746
01:35:33,193 --> 01:35:35,236
Kennedy Airport,
Pan Am Building.

1747
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,613
Bye!

1748
01:35:36,696 --> 01:35:37,906
Bye, Roman.

1749
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:41,993
Oh, boy.

1750
01:35:48,249 --> 01:35:49,250
Guy?

1751
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:49,876
Hmm?

1752
01:35:49,959 --> 01:35:51,544
Where's my book?

1753
01:35:51,628 --> 01:35:55,131
Oh, I put it
in the garbage.

1754
01:35:56,674 --> 01:35:57,592
What?

1755
01:35:57,675 --> 01:36:00,428
I didn't want you
upsetting yourself anymore.

1756
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,472
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.

1757
01:36:02,514 --> 01:36:03,973
He left it to me.

1758
01:36:04,015 --> 01:36:05,475
I wasn't thinking
about that.

1759
01:36:05,517 --> 01:36:06,976
That's a terrible thing to do.

1760
01:36:07,018 --> 01:36:09,979
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1761
01:36:16,486 --> 01:36:18,404
Hey, watch out, lady!

1762
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:17,922
"Some cultures believed that a personal
possession of the victim is necessary

1763
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:19,799
and spells cannot be cast

1764
01:37:19,841 --> 01:37:22,760
without one of the victim's
belongings."

1765
01:37:22,844 --> 01:37:23,761
Yeah?

1766
01:37:24,512 --> 01:37:25,930
Is this Donald Baumgart?

1767
01:37:26,014 --> 01:37:26,931
That's right.

1768
01:37:27,682 --> 01:37:29,559
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,

1769
01:37:29,642 --> 01:37:31,060
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

1770
01:37:31,144 --> 01:37:32,061
Oh, yes.

1771
01:37:32,145 --> 01:37:33,563
I want to know--

1772
01:37:33,646 --> 01:37:36,065
You must be
a happy little lady,

1773
01:37:36,149 --> 01:37:38,568
living in the Bram,
rows of uniformed lackeys.

1774
01:37:38,651 --> 01:37:40,069
I wanted to know
how you are,

1775
01:37:40,153 --> 01:37:41,154
if there's been
any improvement.

1776
01:37:41,237 --> 01:37:42,655
Well, bless your heart.

1777
01:37:44,657 --> 01:37:46,075
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?

1778
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,577
Well, I'm splendid.

1779
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:51,080
I only broke
six glasses today.

1780
01:37:52,165 --> 01:37:54,584
Guy and I
are both very unhappy

1781
01:37:54,667 --> 01:37:59,088
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1782
01:38:00,632 --> 01:38:02,550
Aw, what the hell.

1783
01:38:02,634 --> 01:38:05,553
That's the way it goes, right?

1784
01:38:05,637 --> 01:38:10,058
I'm sorry I didn't come along that day
he came to visit you.

1785
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:11,976
V-Visit?

1786
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:15,480
Oh, you mean the day
we met for drinks?

1787
01:38:16,022 --> 01:38:18,441
Yes, that's what I meant.

1788
01:38:19,108 --> 01:38:21,945
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.

1789
01:38:22,028 --> 01:38:23,446
What do you mean?

1790
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:25,448
Don't you know?

1791
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,449
No.

1792
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:28,952
Didn't you miss anything
that day?

1793
01:38:30,411 --> 01:38:33,456
You don't mean my tie,
do you?

1794
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,207
Yes.

1795
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:37,544
Oh, well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.

1796
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:39,796
He can have it back.

1797
01:38:39,879 --> 01:38:41,047
I'm sorry.

1798
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:44,801
Doesn't matter to me now
what color tie I'm wearing.

1799
01:38:44,884 --> 01:38:47,303
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.

1800
01:38:47,387 --> 01:38:50,306
Oh, no.
It was a trade.

1801
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:51,808
Or...

1802
01:38:51,891 --> 01:38:53,810
do you think
he stole it?

1803
01:38:53,893 --> 01:38:55,812
I have to hang up now.

1804
01:38:55,895 --> 01:38:58,815
I just wanted to know if there'd been
any improvement.

1805
01:38:58,898 --> 01:39:00,316
No, no, there isn't.

1806
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,319
It was nice of you to call. Bye.

1807
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:42,317
You aren't in labor,
are you?

1808
01:39:42,358 --> 01:39:44,319
No, but I have
to see the doctor.

1809
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,320
It's very important.

1810
01:39:45,361 --> 01:39:46,821
But he has to leave
at 5:00,

1811
01:39:46,863 --> 01:39:48,823
and there is Mrs. Byron.

1812
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:50,825
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.

1813
01:39:50,867 --> 01:39:51,826
Thank you.

1814
01:40:13,848 --> 01:40:15,767
How is it out there?

1815
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:18,228
Oh, awful. 94.

1816
01:40:18,311 --> 01:40:19,270
Ugh!

1817
01:40:19,354 --> 01:40:21,272
See you next week.
Make an appointment.

1818
01:40:21,356 --> 01:40:22,774
Yes, I will.

1819
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,698
You're due any day now,
aren't you?

1820
01:40:30,782 --> 01:40:31,324
Tuesday.

1821
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:34,327
You're smart to get it over with
before August.

1822
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:36,579
Mrs. Byron.

1823
01:40:37,747 --> 01:40:40,166
He'll see you right after.

1824
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,252
Well, let's see, um...

1825
01:40:42,293 --> 01:40:43,753
July the 10th?

1826
01:40:43,795 --> 01:40:45,171
What time?

1827
01:40:45,255 --> 01:40:46,172
4:00?

1828
01:40:46,256 --> 01:40:47,173
Fine.

1829
01:40:47,257 --> 01:40:48,675
All right.
See you then.

1830
01:40:48,758 --> 01:40:50,093
Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

1831
01:40:50,135 --> 01:40:51,094
Good luck.

1832
01:40:51,136 --> 01:40:52,345
Thank you.

1833
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:02,438
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?

1834
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:05,316
Oh, my--

1835
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,819
It's called detchema.

1836
01:41:07,902 --> 01:41:09,571
Well, it's a big improvement
on your regular,

1837
01:41:09,654 --> 01:41:11,030
if you don't mind
my saying.

1838
01:41:11,072 --> 01:41:12,532
That wasn't a perfume.

1839
01:41:12,574 --> 01:41:13,825
That was a good luck charm.

1840
01:41:13,867 --> 01:41:14,826
I threw it away.

1841
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:15,952
Good.

1842
01:41:16,744 --> 01:41:20,206
Maybe the doctor will follow
your example.

1843
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:25,670
Dr. Sapirstein?

1844
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:27,172
Yes. The aftershave.

1845
01:41:27,213 --> 01:41:29,174
Well, it isn't, is it?

1846
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:31,551
I don't think he has
a good luck charm.

1847
01:41:31,634 --> 01:41:34,095
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while.

1848
01:41:34,971 --> 01:41:36,931
When he does--
Oh, boy.

1849
01:41:37,807 --> 01:41:39,559
Haven't you ever noticed?

1850
01:41:39,642 --> 01:41:41,102
No.

1851
01:41:41,144 --> 01:41:44,397
Well, maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.

1852
01:41:44,481 --> 01:41:46,941
What is it,
a chemical thing?

1853
01:41:47,859 --> 01:41:50,195
Will you excuse me a moment,
please?

1854
01:41:50,278 --> 01:41:51,613
My husband
is waiting outside.

1855
01:41:51,696 --> 01:41:53,615
I have to go
and tell him something.

1856
01:41:53,698 --> 01:41:55,533
I'll be back in a minute.

1857
01:42:43,748 --> 01:42:45,208
Dr. Hill's office.

1858
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,209
Dr. Hill, please.

1859
01:42:46,251 --> 01:42:47,710
This is his
answering service.

1860
01:42:47,752 --> 01:42:50,213
Would you like
to leave a message?

1861
01:42:50,255 --> 01:42:54,217
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1862
01:42:54,259 --> 01:42:55,718
Woodhouse.

1863
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,223
And would you ask him to call me back
right away, please?

1864
01:43:00,265 --> 01:43:05,228
Uh, my number is
475-2598.

1865
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:07,730
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1866
01:43:07,772 --> 01:43:08,731
All right.

1867
01:43:18,741 --> 01:43:21,661
Quickly, please,
Dr. Hill, call me.

1868
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:30,170
Oh, oh, really?

1869
01:43:30,253 --> 01:43:32,172
Did he really say that?

1870
01:43:32,255 --> 01:43:34,674
Oh, he didn't say that.

1871
01:43:34,757 --> 01:43:37,677
What else was it
that he said?

1872
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,179
Oh, that's wonderful.

1873
01:43:39,262 --> 01:43:41,681
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.

1874
01:43:42,765 --> 01:43:43,683
Yes. Dr. Hill?

1875
01:43:43,766 --> 01:43:44,684
Did I get the name right?

1876
01:43:44,767 --> 01:43:46,186
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?

1877
01:43:46,269 --> 01:43:47,187
Yes.

1878
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:49,189
Are you Dr. Hill's patient?

1879
01:43:49,272 --> 01:43:50,231
No.

1880
01:43:50,315 --> 01:43:53,693
Um, yes, I mean,
well, I've seen him once.

1881
01:43:53,776 --> 01:43:56,821
Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.

1882
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:57,780
It's important.

1883
01:43:58,656 --> 01:44:00,158
Tell him to call me, hmm?

1884
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,118
-All right.
-Thank you.

1885
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:10,460
All of them.

1886
01:44:10,543 --> 01:44:11,961
All of them.

1887
01:44:12,045 --> 01:44:13,963
All in it together.

1888
01:44:14,047 --> 01:44:15,465
All of them.

1889
01:44:15,548 --> 01:44:17,467
All of them witches.

1890
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:19,969
Don't you worry,
little Andy or Jenny,

1891
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:23,473
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

1892
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,478
Yes. Dr...

1893
01:44:28,561 --> 01:44:29,479
Mrs. Woodhouse?

1894
01:44:29,562 --> 01:44:30,522
Yes!

1895
01:44:30,605 --> 01:44:33,483
Oh, thank you,
Thank you for calling me.

1896
01:44:33,566 --> 01:44:34,984
Thought you were
in California.

1897
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:38,488
No. No, I've been
to another doctor,

1898
01:44:38,571 --> 01:44:40,990
and he isn't good,
Dr. Hill.

1899
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,992
He's been lying to me

1900
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:46,996
and giving me unusual kinds
of drinks and capsules.

1901
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,998
The baby's due
on Tuesday.

1902
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:50,500
Remember you told me
June 28th?

1903
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,502
Well, I want you
to deliver it.

1904
01:44:52,585 --> 01:44:54,003
Mrs. Woodhouse...

1905
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:56,005
Please let me
talk to you.

1906
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:59,008
Let me come and explain
what's been going on.

1907
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:01,010
I can't stay too long here.

1908
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:03,513
They'll be coming,
looking for me.

1909
01:45:03,596 --> 01:45:04,514
Dr. Hill?

1910
01:45:04,597 --> 01:45:06,516
Dr. Hill,
there's a plot--

1911
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:08,518
I know that sounds crazy.

1912
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:10,019
You're probably thinking,

1913
01:45:10,103 --> 01:45:11,980
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped,"

1914
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:14,983
but I haven't flipped,
Dr. Hill, I swear.

1915
01:45:15,024 --> 01:45:16,734
By all the saints,
I haven't.

1916
01:45:16,818 --> 01:45:19,279
There are plots against people,
aren't there?

1917
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,780
Yes, I suppose there are.

1918
01:45:20,822 --> 01:45:24,284
Well, then there's one against me
and my baby.

1919
01:45:25,869 --> 01:45:28,454
Come to my office
tomorrow after 5:00.

1920
01:45:28,496 --> 01:45:29,455
No!

1921
01:45:29,497 --> 01:45:30,498
Right now.

1922
01:45:31,374 --> 01:45:33,251
Mrs. Woodhouse,
I'm not at my office now.

1923
01:45:33,334 --> 01:45:35,253
I'm home. I've been up
since yesterday morning.

1924
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:36,754
I beg you.

1925
01:45:36,796 --> 01:45:38,256
I beg you.

1926
01:45:39,549 --> 01:45:42,010
I can't stay here.

1927
01:45:42,844 --> 01:45:45,805
My office at 8:00.
-Yes, thank you.

1928
01:45:45,847 --> 01:45:46,973
Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?

1929
01:45:47,015 --> 01:45:47,974
Yes?

1930
01:45:48,016 --> 01:45:50,477
My husband may call you,
asking--

1931
01:45:50,518 --> 01:45:53,480
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1932
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:54,481
Thank you.

1933
01:46:28,389 --> 01:46:30,016
Keep the change.

1934
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:32,268
Uh, driver, please,

1935
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:36,940
could you wait and watch until--
until I'm inside the door?

1936
01:46:52,497 --> 01:46:53,832
He lied to you.

1937
01:46:53,832 --> 01:46:55,750
He said we were
going to Hollywood.

1938
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,793
The worst thing of all,

1939
01:46:56,876 --> 01:46:58,336
he's involved
with them as well.

1940
01:46:59,254 --> 01:47:00,755
He sleeps in pajamas now.

1941
01:47:00,797 --> 01:47:02,132
He never used to before.

1942
01:47:02,173 --> 01:47:03,925
He's probably
hiding a mark.

1943
01:47:04,008 --> 01:47:06,136
You know they give you marks
when you join--

1944
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:07,846
All sorts of rituals.

1945
01:47:07,929 --> 01:47:09,722
They hold sabbaths there.

1946
01:47:09,806 --> 01:47:11,683
You could hear them singing
through the wall.

1947
01:47:11,766 --> 01:47:14,853
Guy, my husband Guy
said it was Dr. Shand,

1948
01:47:14,936 --> 01:47:17,063
one of these people
playing a recorder.

1949
01:47:17,147 --> 01:47:19,774
Now, how did he know
it was Dr. Shand

1950
01:47:19,858 --> 01:47:22,193
unless he was there
with them?

1951
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:25,363
Um, they're very clever people.

1952
01:47:25,446 --> 01:47:27,532
They planned everything right
from the beginning.

1953
01:47:27,615 --> 01:47:30,535
They probably made
some sort of deal with Guy.

1954
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:34,289
They gave him success,
and he promised them our baby

1955
01:47:34,372 --> 01:47:36,708
to use in their rituals.

1956
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:38,418
I know
this sounds crazy,

1957
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:42,130
but I've--I've got books here.
Look.

1958
01:47:43,214 --> 01:47:46,801
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,

1959
01:47:46,843 --> 01:47:48,553
and they put
a spell on him.

1960
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:51,014
They cast a spell on him
and made him blind

1961
01:47:51,097 --> 01:47:53,016
so that Guy
could get his part.

1962
01:47:53,099 --> 01:47:55,059
Look, here.

1963
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,439
I had this friend
Edward Hutchins.

1964
01:47:59,522 --> 01:48:01,274
Maybe you heard of him,
a writer.

1965
01:48:01,357 --> 01:48:02,859
He wrote stories
for boys.

1966
01:48:02,942 --> 01:48:04,360
Anyway, he was my good friend

1967
01:48:04,444 --> 01:48:05,820
since I first came
to New York.

1968
01:48:05,904 --> 01:48:07,197
May I keep this?

1969
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,867
Yes, please,
and, look, anyway,

1970
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,786
once Mr. Hutchins
came to visit me--

1971
01:48:13,828 --> 01:48:17,916
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1972
01:48:17,999 --> 01:48:22,045
I was suffering so-- You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,

1973
01:48:22,086 --> 01:48:24,005
and they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.

1974
01:48:24,047 --> 01:48:27,425
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

1975
01:48:27,509 --> 01:48:30,595
Also witches' stuff,
tannis root.

1976
01:48:30,678 --> 01:48:33,807
Hutch came, and he immediately saw
something was wrong.

1977
01:48:33,848 --> 01:48:35,767
He--He knew about witches,
you see.

1978
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,812
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup
still on,

1979
01:48:38,853 --> 01:48:40,021
which he never did.

1980
01:48:40,104 --> 01:48:42,649
They probably
called him to come home

1981
01:48:42,732 --> 01:48:44,609
and steal one of
Hutch's belongings,

1982
01:48:44,692 --> 01:48:46,528
which he did.
Took his glove,

1983
01:48:46,611 --> 01:48:48,571
and they put a spell
on him, too.

1984
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:52,992
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.

1985
01:48:53,034 --> 01:48:55,537
Now, maybe all of this
is coincidence,

1986
01:48:55,578 --> 01:48:56,913
but one thing
is for sure.

1987
01:48:56,996 --> 01:48:59,165
They have a coven
and they want my baby.

1988
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,504
Certainly seems that way.

1989
01:49:14,556 --> 01:49:16,891
I was afraid you
wouldn't believe me.

1990
01:49:16,975 --> 01:49:18,560
I don't believe
in witchcraft,

1991
01:49:18,643 --> 01:49:22,230
but there are plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

1992
01:49:22,313 --> 01:49:23,982
The doctor's name is Shand,
you say?

1993
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:27,443
N-No, Dr. Shand is
one of these people.

1994
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:29,529
The doctor's name
is Sapirstein.

1995
01:49:30,446 --> 01:49:32,699
Abraham Sapirstein?

1996
01:49:33,032 --> 01:49:35,493
Yeah.

1997
01:49:35,577 --> 01:49:36,744
Do you know him?

1998
01:49:36,786 --> 01:49:39,038
I've met him once or twice.

1999
01:49:39,122 --> 01:49:40,874
To look at him,
you'd never think he--

2000
01:49:40,915 --> 01:49:43,626
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

2001
01:49:44,335 --> 01:49:46,254
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai right now,

2002
01:49:46,296 --> 01:49:47,922
this evening?

2003
01:49:48,006 --> 01:49:51,551
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

2004
01:49:51,634 --> 01:49:53,887
It's difficult,
but we'll try.

2005
01:49:54,637 --> 01:49:57,432
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

2006
01:49:57,474 --> 01:49:58,475
Yes.

2007
01:49:58,558 --> 01:50:01,811
Anything they've got,
even a broom closet'd be fine.

2008
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:04,314
I hope we can
do better than that.

2009
01:50:10,278 --> 01:50:14,115
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.

2010
01:50:16,326 --> 01:50:17,702
Oh, should I undress now?

2011
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:20,497
No. It'll take me about
a half-hour on the telephone.

2012
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,624
You just lie down, rest.

2013
01:50:24,626 --> 01:50:25,543
O.K.?

2014
01:50:25,627 --> 01:50:26,711
O.K.

2015
01:50:35,136 --> 01:50:37,430
God bless Dr. Hill.

2016
01:50:43,353 --> 01:50:46,981
Everything's going to be O.K. now,
Andy or Jenny.

2017
01:50:47,065 --> 01:50:50,443
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital

2018
01:50:50,485 --> 01:50:52,445
with no visitors.

2019
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:56,074
Oh.

2020
01:51:13,508 --> 01:51:15,260
Monsters.

2021
01:51:18,096 --> 01:51:19,389
Monsters.

2022
01:51:23,017 --> 01:51:25,478
Unspeakable.

2023
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,313
Unspeakable.

2024
01:51:58,887 --> 01:52:00,680
I was sleeping.

2025
01:52:14,903 --> 01:52:17,280
Come with us quietly,
Rosemary.

2026
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:19,407
Don't argue or make a scene

2027
01:52:19,491 --> 01:52:21,910
because if you say anything more about
witches or witchcraft,

2028
01:52:21,951 --> 01:52:24,370
we're going to be forced to take you
to a mental hospital.

2029
01:52:24,454 --> 01:52:26,498
You don't want that,
do you?

2030
01:52:26,581 --> 01:52:27,749
So put your shoes on.

2031
01:52:27,832 --> 01:52:30,168
Wejust want
to take you home.

2032
01:52:30,251 --> 01:52:31,377
No one's going
to hurt you.

2033
01:52:31,419 --> 01:52:34,881
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.

2034
01:52:52,816 --> 01:52:54,234
She's fine now.

2035
01:52:54,609 --> 01:52:56,611
We're going to go home and rest.

2036
01:52:56,694 --> 01:52:57,946
That's all it takes.

2037
01:52:58,029 --> 01:52:59,447
Thank you for your trouble,
Doctor.

2038
01:52:59,489 --> 01:53:01,157
Glad I could be of help, sir.

2039
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:03,159
It's a shame you had to come in here.

2040
01:53:56,421 --> 01:53:58,423
Good evening,
Mrs. Woodhouse.

2041
01:54:13,938 --> 01:54:15,899
Mrs. Woodhouse!

2042
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,901
Mrs. Woodhouse!

2043
01:54:42,967 --> 01:54:43,968
Uhh!

2044
01:55:22,090 --> 01:55:23,133
Ro!

2045
01:55:23,216 --> 01:55:24,592
Ro!

2046
01:55:24,634 --> 01:55:25,927
Ro!

2047
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:29,264
Ro, baby, Ro!

2048
01:55:29,305 --> 01:55:30,515
Ro!

2049
01:55:33,768 --> 01:55:34,894
Come on, open up, Ro.

2050
01:55:34,936 --> 01:55:36,020
Go to hell!

2051
01:55:36,104 --> 01:55:37,063
Come on, honey.
No one's going to hurt you.

2052
01:55:37,147 --> 01:55:39,399
You promised them the baby,
get out!

2053
01:55:39,482 --> 01:55:40,817
No, I didn't promise
them anything.

2054
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:41,860
What are you talking about?
Promised who?

2055
01:55:41,943 --> 01:55:42,861
Rosemary, you're--

2056
01:55:42,944 --> 01:55:45,238
You, too! Get away!

2057
01:56:17,228 --> 01:56:18,188
Hello.

2058
01:56:18,229 --> 01:56:18,938
Elise?

2059
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:19,981
Mrs. Dunstan is out.

2060
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,816
-Who is this?
-The babysitter.

2061
01:56:21,858 --> 01:56:22,817
Do you know
where she went?

2062
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:24,110
They went
to the movies.

2063
01:56:24,736 --> 01:56:27,572
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary

2064
01:56:27,614 --> 01:56:29,073
the second
she gets home.

2065
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:32,160
It's terribly urgent.
Don't-- Don't forget.

2066
01:56:32,243 --> 01:56:33,828
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.

2067
01:56:33,912 --> 01:56:35,079
Thank you.

2068
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:43,421
We don't want
to hurt you, Ro.

2069
01:56:45,215 --> 01:56:46,841
We're your friends,
Rosemary.

2070
01:56:46,925 --> 01:56:48,551
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Rosemary.

2071
01:56:48,635 --> 01:56:50,178
Honest and truly there isn't.

2072
01:56:50,261 --> 01:56:53,431
This is nothing but a mild sedative
to calm you down.

2073
01:56:53,515 --> 01:56:55,892
You know I wouldn't
let any--

2074
01:56:55,975 --> 01:56:56,935
Ro.

2075
01:56:57,018 --> 01:56:57,936
Aah!

2076
01:56:58,019 --> 01:56:59,437
Ro, Ro!

2077
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:00,647
Help me!

2078
01:57:00,730 --> 01:57:01,648
Oh, Ro, baby.

2079
01:57:01,731 --> 01:57:04,692
Somebody help me!

2080
01:57:04,776 --> 01:57:05,777
Aah!

2081
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:16,538
Wait a minute.

2082
01:57:17,455 --> 01:57:19,666
Wait a minute now.

2083
01:57:24,879 --> 01:57:26,714
We happen to be
in labor here.

2084
01:57:26,756 --> 01:57:27,715
Here?

2085
01:57:27,757 --> 01:57:28,299
Here.

2086
01:57:28,383 --> 01:57:29,467
You're all right, baby.

2087
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:30,969
You're going to be
perfectly all right.

2088
01:57:31,052 --> 01:57:32,095
I swear to God you will.

2089
01:57:32,178 --> 01:57:34,848
There were supposed
to be doctors, hospitals!

2090
01:57:34,889 --> 01:57:35,849
Doctors, hospitals!

2091
01:57:37,016 --> 01:57:40,353
Everything--
Everything's clean and sterile!

2092
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:42,981
No, she isn't here, Elise.

2093
01:57:43,064 --> 01:57:45,024
I'll have her
call you back.

2094
01:57:50,822 --> 01:57:52,282
Oh, Andy...

2095
01:57:52,365 --> 01:57:54,993
Andy or Jenny...

2096
01:57:55,076 --> 01:57:59,038
I--I'm sorry,
my little darling.

2097
01:57:59,122 --> 01:58:00,748
Forgive me.

2098
01:58:11,843 --> 01:58:13,303
Hi.

2099
01:58:18,475 --> 01:58:19,601
Hi.

2100
01:58:21,603 --> 01:58:24,814
Is it all right?

2101
01:58:25,607 --> 01:58:29,110
Yes, it's fine.

2102
01:58:30,612 --> 01:58:32,989
What is it?

2103
01:58:33,072 --> 01:58:34,616
A boy.

2104
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:41,706
Really?
A boy?

2105
01:58:51,049 --> 01:58:53,051
And it's all right?

2106
01:58:53,134 --> 01:58:54,803
Yes.

2107
01:59:14,405 --> 01:59:16,366
Where is it?

2108
01:59:16,449 --> 01:59:17,450
Ohh!

2109
01:59:17,534 --> 01:59:19,035
Oh, my goodness.

2110
01:59:19,077 --> 01:59:21,788
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.

2111
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:23,206
The baby, where is it?

2112
01:59:23,289 --> 01:59:26,793
Oh, uh, you wait
here one minute.

2113
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,547
Where's my baby?

2114
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:33,091
Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe.

2115
01:59:33,133 --> 01:59:34,634
Ju-Just wait.

2116
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:52,527
Where's the baby?

2117
01:59:56,114 --> 01:59:57,615
Where is it?

2118
01:59:57,657 --> 01:59:59,826
Honey...

2119
02:00:00,368 --> 02:00:01,703
There were complications,
Rosemary,

2120
02:00:01,744 --> 02:00:03,663
but nothing that will affect
future births.

2121
02:00:07,083 --> 02:00:08,793
It's...

2122
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:11,296
Dead.

2123
02:00:11,379 --> 02:00:12,797
It was in
the wrong position.

2124
02:00:12,881 --> 02:00:14,299
In the hospital
I might have been able

2125
02:00:14,382 --> 02:00:15,925
to do something about it,
but you wouldn't listen.

2126
02:00:16,009 --> 02:00:18,970
Honey, we can have others
as soon as you're better. I promise you.

2127
02:00:19,053 --> 02:00:21,639
Absolutely. You can start on another
in a very few months.

2128
02:00:21,723 --> 02:00:23,057
As soon as
you're better.

2129
02:00:23,099 --> 02:00:24,267
No.

2130
02:00:25,977 --> 02:00:28,438
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

2131
02:00:28,521 --> 02:00:30,523
You're lying!
It didn't die!

2132
02:00:30,565 --> 02:00:31,649
You took it!

2133
02:00:31,733 --> 02:00:32,984
You're lying!

2134
02:00:33,067 --> 02:00:34,694
You're witches!

2135
02:00:34,777 --> 02:00:35,778
You're lying!

2136
02:00:35,862 --> 02:00:37,322
You're lying!

2137
02:00:37,405 --> 02:00:39,324
You're lying!

2138
02:00:39,407 --> 02:00:41,075
You're lying!

2139
02:00:49,751 --> 02:00:53,254
Abe says it's called
pre-partum.

2140
02:00:53,338 --> 02:00:56,216
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

2141
02:00:57,175 --> 02:01:01,095
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.

2142
02:01:03,515 --> 02:01:08,853
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,

2143
02:01:09,437 --> 02:01:14,609
but, um, how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?

2144
02:01:17,445 --> 02:01:20,949
Um, let's face it, darling.

2145
02:01:19,531 --> 02:01:23,910
You had the pre-partum crazies.

2146
02:01:24,452 --> 02:01:28,832
Now you're going to rest,
and you're going to get over them.

2147
02:01:28,915 --> 02:01:32,585
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

2148
02:01:32,669 --> 02:01:35,004
but from now on,
everything's going to be roses.

2149
02:01:35,088 --> 02:01:37,048
Paramount's within an inch
of where we want them,

2150
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:39,342
and suddenly Universal's
interested, too,

2151
02:01:39,425 --> 02:01:40,677
and we're going
to blow this town,

2152
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:42,887
and we're going to be
in the beautiful Hills of Beverly

2153
02:01:42,971 --> 02:01:46,391
with a pool, a spice garden,
the whole schmeer,

2154
02:01:46,432 --> 02:01:48,101
and the kids, too, Ro.

2155
02:01:48,184 --> 02:01:51,104
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.

2156
02:01:54,941 --> 02:01:57,819
Now, I got to run now
and get famous.

2157
02:02:00,655 --> 02:02:03,116
Let me see your shoulder.

2158
02:02:06,035 --> 02:02:07,871
Let me see your shoulder.

2159
02:02:07,954 --> 02:02:08,955
Are you kidding?

2160
02:02:09,038 --> 02:02:11,833
Your left shoulder.

2161
02:02:11,916 --> 02:02:14,294
All right.
Anything you say.

2162
02:02:17,338 --> 02:02:20,675
I generally prefer
doing this to music.

2163
02:02:20,758 --> 02:02:22,260
Left shoulder.

2164
02:02:25,305 --> 02:02:26,389
Right shoulder.

2165
02:02:29,684 --> 02:02:33,605
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.

2166
02:02:37,609 --> 02:02:39,486
The high pressure area
that we see here

2167
02:02:39,569 --> 02:02:41,946
has been causing this
extreme heat and humidity.

2168
02:02:42,572 --> 02:02:45,200
And unfortunately
will be staying with us city dwellers

2169
02:02:45,283 --> 02:02:46,826
through the rest of the week.

2170
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:50,038
It will be hot and over cast
upstate New York as well

2171
02:02:50,121 --> 02:02:53,541
with the possibility of thunder showers
tonight and tomorrow

2172
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:56,085
withg radual clearing
by tomorrow night.

2173
02:02:56,127 --> 02:03:00,590
All you people leaving the city this
upcoming weekend should find it hot.

2174
02:03:24,614 --> 02:03:28,159
Do you hear a baby crying?

2175
02:03:28,243 --> 02:03:30,703
Why, no, I don't, dear.

2176
02:03:30,787 --> 02:03:32,580
Now, you come
and get into your bed now.

2177
02:03:32,622 --> 02:03:35,542
It's time for you
to take your pill.

2178
02:03:44,801 --> 02:03:46,761
Did you turn the air
conditioner off?

2179
02:03:46,803 --> 02:03:47,595
Mm-hmm.

2180
02:03:47,637 --> 02:03:49,681
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.

2181
02:03:49,764 --> 02:03:52,725
Why, people are actually dying,
it's so hot.

2182
02:04:07,866 --> 02:04:09,576
What do you do
with the milk?

2183
02:04:10,076 --> 02:04:12,871
Why, uh,
throw it away.

2184
02:04:12,954 --> 02:04:14,622
Your pill, Rosemary.

2185
02:04:24,007 --> 02:04:25,341
Hello, girls.

2186
02:04:25,425 --> 02:04:28,928
Whew. 95 out.

2187
02:04:29,012 --> 02:04:32,307
Some new people
moved on in up in 8.

2188
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:34,726
Do they have a baby?

2189
02:04:36,603 --> 02:04:37,979
How'd you know that?

2190
02:04:38,062 --> 02:04:41,107
I heard it crying.

2191
02:04:42,442 --> 02:04:43,902
Oh, wait a minute.

2192
02:04:47,322 --> 02:04:50,116
Oh, no.
Don't do that.

2193
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:51,743
Why not?

2194
02:04:51,826 --> 02:04:55,288
Uh, a little messy, that's all.

2195
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:47,210
Easy, easy.

2196
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:07,105
Got her too high.

2197
02:08:26,583 --> 02:08:29,878
Not if he's still waiting
for a plane, he isn't.

2198
02:08:32,547 --> 02:08:34,299
Oh, hell, now, Hayato.

2199
02:08:34,382 --> 02:08:35,675
You're just
making fun of me.

2200
02:08:35,717 --> 02:08:38,386
You're pulling my leg,
like we say.

2201
02:09:03,536 --> 02:09:06,664
Aah!

2202
02:09:07,373 --> 02:09:09,626
Rosemary,
go back to bed.

2203
02:09:09,751 --> 02:09:12,128
You know you're not supposed
to be up and around.

2204
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:13,129
Is the mother?

2205
02:09:13,213 --> 02:09:14,339
Uh, Rosemary--

2206
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:17,842
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

2207
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:05,390
What have you
done to it?

2208
02:10:05,431 --> 02:10:07,559
What have you done
to its eyes?

2209
02:10:07,642 --> 02:10:09,144
He has his
father's eyes.

2210
02:10:14,482 --> 02:10:18,111
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.

2211
02:10:18,153 --> 02:10:21,281
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?

2212
02:10:21,322 --> 02:10:23,783
Satan is his father,
not Guy.

2213
02:10:24,534 --> 02:10:28,163
He came up from hell and begat a son
of mortal woman.

2214
02:10:28,204 --> 02:10:29,122
Hail, Satan.

2215
02:10:29,205 --> 02:10:30,206
Hail, Satan.

2216
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:33,710
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.

2217
02:10:33,793 --> 02:10:37,046
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

2218
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:40,467
He shall redeem the despised
and wreak vengeance

2219
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:44,012
in the name of the burned
and the tortured!

2220
02:10:44,053 --> 02:10:45,013
Hail, Adrian!

2221
02:10:45,054 --> 02:10:46,014
Hail, Adrian!

2222
02:10:46,055 --> 02:10:48,141
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!

2223
02:10:48,224 --> 02:10:49,893
Hail, Satan!

2224
02:10:49,976 --> 02:10:51,811
He chose you
out of all the world.

2225
02:10:51,895 --> 02:10:54,314
Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

2226
02:10:54,397 --> 02:10:56,107
He arranged things
because he wanted you

2227
02:10:56,191 --> 02:10:57,609
to be the mother
of his only living son.

2228
02:10:57,692 --> 02:11:00,028
His power is stronger
than stronger!

2229
02:11:00,069 --> 02:11:02,822
His might shall last
longer than longer!

2230
02:11:02,906 --> 02:11:04,741
Hail, Satan!

2231
02:11:05,283 --> 02:11:07,035
No!

2232
02:11:07,076 --> 02:11:09,871
It can't be!

2233
02:11:09,954 --> 02:11:11,748
No!

2234
02:11:11,831 --> 02:11:13,249
Go look at his hands.

2235
02:11:13,333 --> 02:11:14,709
And his feet.

2236
02:11:16,711 --> 02:11:19,088
Oh, God!

2237
02:11:20,173 --> 02:11:22,050
God is dead!

2238
02:11:22,091 --> 02:11:23,426
Satan lives!

2239
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:25,303
The year is one!

2240
02:11:25,345 --> 02:11:26,554
- Hail, Satan!
- Hail, Satan!

2241
02:11:26,638 --> 02:11:28,348
The year is one,
and God is done!

2242
02:11:28,431 --> 02:11:29,516
Oh, God!

2243
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:31,142
The year is one!

2244
02:11:31,184 --> 02:11:33,895
Hail, Adrian!

2245
02:11:33,978 --> 02:11:36,439
Hail, Satan!

2246
02:11:36,815 --> 02:11:38,691
Why don't you help us out,
Rosemary?

2247
02:11:39,818 --> 02:11:42,070
Be a real mother to Adrian.

2248
02:11:41,319 --> 02:11:43,446
You don't have to join
If you don't want to.

2249
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:46,658
Just be a mother
to your baby.

2250
02:11:47,492 --> 02:11:51,079
Minnie and Laura-Louise
are too old.

2251
02:11:51,162 --> 02:11:52,705
It's not right.

2252
02:11:54,833 --> 02:11:56,626
Think about it, Rosemary.

2253
02:12:10,348 --> 02:12:11,891
Oh, God!

2254
02:12:11,975 --> 02:12:13,351
Oh, shut up with your oh, Gods,

2255
02:12:13,393 --> 02:12:14,811
or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.

2256
02:12:14,853 --> 02:12:15,979
You shut up.

2257
02:12:16,062 --> 02:12:20,066
Rosemary's his mother,
so you show some respect.

2258
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:22,777
Come, my friend.

2259
02:12:22,861 --> 02:12:25,613
Come see him.
Come see the child.

2260
02:12:35,748 --> 02:12:38,835
What would you
like to drink?

2261
02:12:38,877 --> 02:12:41,379
They, uh, promised
me you wouldn't be hurt,

2262
02:12:41,421 --> 02:12:44,090
and you haven't
been, really.

2263
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:49,554
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.

2264
02:12:49,637 --> 02:12:51,598
Wouldn't that
be the same?

2265
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:54,726
And we're getting so much
in return, Ro.

2266
02:13:05,069 --> 02:13:09,574
Oh, Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.

2267
02:13:09,616 --> 02:13:12,202
How proud you must be.

2268
02:13:12,285 --> 02:13:13,745
Is this the mother?

2269
02:13:13,787 --> 02:13:14,954
Why in the name of--

2270
02:13:14,996 --> 02:13:17,040
Here, drink this.
You'll feel a little better.

2271
02:13:17,123 --> 02:13:18,583
What's in it?
Tannis root?

2272
02:13:18,666 --> 02:13:19,584
Nothing's in it.

2273
02:13:19,667 --> 02:13:21,377
Just plain,
ordinary Lipton's tea.

2274
02:13:21,461 --> 02:13:22,879
You drink it.

2275
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,620
Get away from here.

2276
02:13:55,703 --> 02:13:56,871
Roman.

2277
02:13:56,955 --> 02:13:58,957
You're rocking him too fast.

2278
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,875
Sit down.
Get her out of here.

2279
02:14:00,875 --> 02:14:02,127
Put her where she belongs.

2280
02:14:02,210 --> 02:14:03,795
You're rocking him too fast.

2281
02:14:03,878 --> 02:14:04,879
That's why he's crying.

2282
02:14:05,004 --> 02:14:05,839
Oh, mind your own business.

2283
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,132
Let Rosemary rock him.

2284
02:14:08,216 --> 02:14:10,802
Go on, sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.

2285
02:14:10,844 --> 02:14:11,886
Well, she's liable to--

2286
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:14,889
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.

2287
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,441
Rock him.

2288
02:14:28,194 --> 02:14:31,489
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.

2289
02:14:31,573 --> 02:14:33,575
Aren't you his mother?

2290
02:16:41,411 --> 02:16:41,578
END
