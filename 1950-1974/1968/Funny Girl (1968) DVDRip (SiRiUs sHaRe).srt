1
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:15,808
SUBS: LFBS

2
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,640
Miss Fanny?

3
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:15,043
- Miss Fanny?
- Down here, Emma. Third row.

4
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,040
I came in early to tidy up,
and the doorman said you were in.

5
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:20,682
What you doing out there?

6
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,798
The one place in the theatre
I've never sat.

7
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:31,238
Maybe things look different from here.

8
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,526
This is the day, isn't it?

9
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:36,844
Yeah.

10
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:39,608
Any word yet?

11
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,845
No. The wire just said tonight.

12
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,798
You nervous?

13
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,248
Nervous, happy, scared, excited...

14
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:56,282
I'm going to make a fresh pot
of coffee. You coming?

15
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:59,804
I think I'll just sit here
for a while, okay?

16
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:03,548
Well, I'll be in
the dressing room if you want me.

17
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:09,549
Mr. Ziegfeld wants to see you.
When you feel like it, he says.

18
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,350
He'll be waiting in his office.

19
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,551
Thanks, Em.

20
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,952
Did you hear that, Mrs. Strakosh?

21
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,353
Ziegfeld is waiting for me.

22
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,754
For me.

23
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:39,355
See, you were wrong, Mrs. Strakosh.

24
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:46,256
No, Fanny, darling, I'm not wrong.

25
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,057
For a girl, for average,
you're a pleasure.

26
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,958
But when people pay good money
in the theatre...

27
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,959
...especially the male element,
they want something extra to look at.

28
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,160
But if a girl isn't...

29
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:02,561
If a girl isn't what?

30
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:46,549
Don't worry, Mrs Strakosh, they'll look at me.

31
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,650
The whole world will
look at me and be stunned.

32
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:53,851
It was all right when you were
a child and made funny faces.

33
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:58,252
- Then, you were cute.
- My condolences, darling, you're no longer cute.

34
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:05,953
Hey, wait a minute.
No, it's all right. I'm one of the 8 Beautiful Girls 8.

35
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, the makeup helps a lot.

36
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,000
Really.

37
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:25,201
Sell it, sell it.

38
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,102
Get in there, Fanny.

39
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:53,000
Knees high. High! Way up there.

40
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,801
Go.

41
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,502
Hold it, Eddie.

42
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:08,003
Hold it!

43
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,604
You, with the skinny legs.

44
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:15,105
You. Yes, you, with the bloomers!

45
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:17,406
Yeah?

46
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,044
- You're fired.
- What?

47
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,245
You call that a replacement?
What's the matter, Ed? Did you owe somebody a favour?

48
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:27,846
- It seemed like a funny idea.
- What's funny about it?

49
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:28,947
- What do I say?
- Everybody back at 4.

50
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:32,648
But listen, you're making a mistake.

51
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,349
I got a lot of experience, honest.
I've been on the stage since I was 10.

52
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,350
Amateur contests,
Gottlieb's Southern Repertory...

53
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:43,051
...professional companies. Lassie...
I doubled six parts.

54
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,990
I played a daughter and her father.
A 60-year-old Indian chief.

55
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,371
Listen, girlie...
- Hau.

56
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:51,672
Please, you've got to face facts.
You don't look like the other girls.

57
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:54,000
- I know, but...
- You got skinny legs, you stick out.

58
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:55,301
And you are out!

59
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,302
I'm just trying to tell you something...

60
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,803
- Sorry, kid.
- Why don't you give me a chance?

61
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,157
Look! I do a terrific time step! Watch!

62
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:02,958
Out! Out!

63
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:09,559
Look Mr. Keeney. Suppose all you ever had for breakfast
was onion rolls.

64
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,260
Now, all of a sudden, one morning in walks a bagel.

65
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,000
So, I mean, you take a look at it and say,
"What is that?"...

66
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,001
...until you tried it.
That's my trouble.

67
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:22,002
What's your trouble?
I'm a bagel on a plate full of onion rolls!

68
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,203
Nobody recognizes me. Listen:

69
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:12,904
No autographs, please.

70
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,705
Hau? What did she say?

71
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:17,206
You think beautiful girls are gonna stay stars forever?

72
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:18,207
I should say not. Any minute now thye're gonna be out.

73
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,218
You're no chorus girl.

74
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,539
You're a singer.

75
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,040
And a comic.

76
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,522
With skinny legs.

77
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,323
So why did you try out for the chorus?

78
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,124
'Cause that's what you were looking for.

79
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,125
If you'd been looking for a juggler, I would have been a juggler.

80
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:09,726
I just gotta get on a stage somehow.

81
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:14,227
How come you hired me?

82
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,828
Because you wanted it so much.

83
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,329
Are you sure you're tough enough for business?

84
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,130
Maybe not.

85
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,431
- Say, can you roller skate?
- Why, you had a sudden urge to go skating?

86
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:36,932
No, I'm trying out a novelty number tomorrow.
If you can skate, be here at noon.

87
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:40,933
Yeah, but what about Keeney?
- He won't be in till night. By then the number'll be in the show.

88
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,134
But he'll kill you. He might even fire you.

89
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,635
Not if you're good.

90
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,336
Are you sure you can roller skate?

91
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:54,337
Can I roller skate?

92
00:21:59,438 --> 00:22:02,638
- I thought you said you could skate.
- I didn't know I couldn't.

93
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,739
Nora.  Sandra.
Cherry.  Wilma.

94
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,940
Ruthie. Polly.
Fanny.

95
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,741
Go. Get out there.

96
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,742
Thanks, mister, I really...

97
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:48,243
Hey, you!

98
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:01,244
- Lady, back inside.
- What are you doing?

99
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:06,845
Fanny, they liked you. Go back out
there, Fan. Go ahead, honey.

100
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,046
- You, stay back.
- It's my show!

101
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,147
No, you don't.

102
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:21,948
Her. On her. Over there!

103
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,849
Smile.

104
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,550
Eddie, they liked it!
Did you hear that...?

105
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,851
- Mr. Keeney...
- Get the next act on.

106
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:21,152
What do you think I'm paying you for?
So they shouldn't like it?

107
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,153
I didn't know you were paying me.

108
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:24,654
I don't know what you pay me,
but I bet it isn't enough.

109
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:28,955
Listen girlie, when I get around to thinking
about you, I'll let you know.

110
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,456
Well, if it isn't Miss Roller Skates.

111
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:41,657
- Listen, I'm really sorry, girls.
- Oh, sure you are.

112
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:43,058
We heard the applause.

113
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,359
I'm sorry I loused up the number,
but I couldn't help it.

114
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,360
As long as I did, I'm glad it was a hit.

115
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:51,961
Who do you think will see you in this dump?
Florenz Ziegfeld?

116
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,762
Why not? You think the word can't spread?
I'll spread it myself.

117
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:58,063
I know a lady who knows the lady
who makes his shirts.

118
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:02,064
He's gonna hear about me.

119
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:05,065
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm telling you something.

120
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:08,666
One night, you'll be sitting around here laughing
and kidding, just like that...

121
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,267
...and there's gonna be a knock on the door.

122
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:13,768
You see? And there
he'll be: Ziegfeld!

123
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,669
Sorry to disappoint you,
but the name's Arnstein.

124
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,470
- Did you want to see someone?
- Yes.

125
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:30,071
You.

126
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:36,072
Gorgeous.

127
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:39,673
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I mean, your shirt.

128
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:43,474
It's absolutely the most gorgeous
thing I've ever seen in my life.

129
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:44,975
What's it made out of?

130
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:49,276
French handkerchief linen.
It goes very limp, though.

131
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:53,277
Yeah. I can see.
Except, it's really beautiful.

132
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,578
All the tailcoats I've seen,
I mean...

133
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:57,979
...well, they were rented, you know...

134
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,280
...they all got these stiff shirts.

135
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,881
Well, this one's just for fun.

136
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:06,182
You've probably heard this so often that it's boring...

137
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:09,000
...but I had to come back to tell you how much I enjoyed what you did.

138
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:13,246
It's not so boring. You'd be
surprised how boring it isn't.

139
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,347
You're going to be a big star some day, Miss...

140
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,048
Brice. Fanny Brice.

141
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,849
Fanny Brice.

142
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,850
I'll look for it in lights.

143
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,751
- What did you say your name was?
- Nick Arnstein.

144
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:39,752
- Come around thinking about me, Mr. Keeney?
- It's you. Hello, Arnstein.

145
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:42,653
I'll give you $25 a week.
Take it or leave it.

146
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:44,254
- I'll take it.
- Leave it.

147
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,555
I'm offering 35.

148
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:50,000
What do you mean you're offering? Since when are you...?

149
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,101
In show business? I'm not.

150
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:54,902
But one of your competitors authorized me to deal for him...

151
00:29:54,903 --> 00:29:58,403
...whenever I ran across a talent I considered really unique.

152
00:29:58,404 --> 00:30:00,000
So...

153
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,501
...$35 a week?

154
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:02,802
- 40.
- 45.

155
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:03,903
50.

156
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:07,000
Well, I wasn't authorized to go over 50.

157
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:10,501
She's yours for $50 a week.
Congratulations.

158
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:11,902
Yeah.

159
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:18,003
$50 a week?

160
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:21,304
$50 a week? I'm almost a millionaire!

161
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:24,405
- Hey, who's the competitor?
- There's no competitor.

162
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,606
What do you mean, you were bluffing?
Like in a poker game?

163
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,707
- What if Keeney had stopped first?
- You'd have lost.

164
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:35,908
- I would've lost a job.
- I was willing to take a chance.

165
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:37,609
With my job?

166
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,110
Hey, Nicky.

167
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:44,811
- Come on. We're waiting. Hurry up.
I'll be with you in a minute.

168
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,312
Wow. Are those yours?

169
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm just minding them for a friend.

170
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,701
Look, we're going to Delmonico's for supper.
Won't you join us?

171
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,802
We'd be happy to wait while you change.

172
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:02,203
I'd have to change too much. Nobody could wait that long.

173
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,404
I'd have a much better time and a lot more laughs.

174
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,705
Well...

175
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,706
...thanks anyway...

176
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:15,407
...but I'm meeting some people in my mother's saloon.

177
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,208
Honest.

178
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,709
You want a few jokes to take with you?

179
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,010
I'll wait till the next time we meet, which will be soon, I hope.

180
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:43,611
Hey!

181
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:49,912
Whoever washes your shirt, tell them to put a little starch in the last rinse.

182
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,913
That way, it won't go so limp.

183
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:54,114
Oh.

184
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:56,915
A little starch...

185
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,716
...in the last rinse.

186
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,817
Thank you. I won't forget.

187
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:32,018
It's a telegram! There's a telegram for Mrs. Brice!

188
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,719
A telegram for the Brices!
The Western Union man.

189
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,920
That's life for you. Somebody's dead.

190
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,721
Come on, telegram!

191
00:33:07,922 --> 00:33:11,622
- What do you think of my new song?
- I like the old one better.

192
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:15,523
Yeah, but I'm tired of it.
I've been singing it for six months.

193
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:17,324
- So?
- So?

194
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,225
What?

195
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:21,226
What's that?

196
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:36,127
- Oh, look, here's Fanny now.
- Let her mama tell her.

197
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:37,528
Rosie.

198
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:42,829
Who is it, Mama?

199
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,430
Auntie Blanche or Lou?

200
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,231
Ziegfeld.

201
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:51,332
He died?

202
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,333
"Dear Miss Brice. Stop.

203
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:58,000
Please meet me
at the New Amsterdam Theatre...

204
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:01,401
...on Thursday at 11:00 a.m. Stop.
Florence Ziegfeld."

205
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:03,402
See? By heart, like the Pledge of Allegiance.

206
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:06,703
Mazel tov, Fanny, darling. Mazel tov.

207
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,404
- I knew you'd do it.
- My stomach aches.

208
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:14,305
I wonder how a mother could call a boy Florence.

209
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:16,206
It's "Florenzzzzz."

210
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:19,207
I wonder how a mother could call a boy Florenzzzzz.

211
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,592
You think it's a job or an audition?
A job.

212
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,893
You know what I think?
Somebody talked to him about me.

213
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:29,494
See, I met this guy backstage
one night with a ruffled shirt on.

214
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:32,095
Just the kind you figure to know Ziegfeld.

215
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:35,696
I bet you he said a word.
That's what must have happened.

216
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:39,897
Oh, my head aches.
Nothing aches. You're built like a horse.

217
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:41,798
I have nothing to wear.

218
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,899
What's she been walking around in
all this time? Towels?

219
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,700
It's coming too easy.
That's what's got me scared.

220
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:52,000
Where's all the suffering you're supposed to do  before you click?

221
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:56,101
And the hard knocks, the setbacks
you're supposed to learn from?

222
00:34:56,102 --> 00:35:00,002
This is too quick.
I haven't suffered enough yet.

223
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:08,000
You haven't goy the job yet either.
Who says if you get it in a week you can't lose it?

224
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:12,601
Cheer up. Maybe you'll suffer later.
I guarantee you if you're as bossy with Ziegfeld as you are with...

225
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:15,202
I am not bossy with you or anyone.

226
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:17,603
And even if I was...

227
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:20,204
...Ziegfeld isn't just anyone.

228
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:25,605
And believe me... ...whatever Mr Ziegfeld tells me to do,
that's what I'm gonna do.

229
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,606
Bravo, Miss Brice! Perfectly charming,
and I'm delighted.

230
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:38,907
John, will you get the bride music for Miss Brice, please?

231
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:41,708
- Yes, sir.
- You mean I'm hired?

232
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,209
Uh-Huh.
- I'm a Ziegfeld Girl?

233
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,800
- That's exactly what you are.

234
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,990
I'm a Ziegfeld Girl.

235
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:54,691
Miss Brice, you will do "Second Hand Rose" in the first act...

236
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:57,230
...and you will sing this new number in the finale.
Alright?

237
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:59,066
Anything you say, Mr Ziegfeld.

238
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:02,367
And just go along with Tony, and he'll teach it to you.
OK.

239
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:08,468
John, I want to see the second act opening right from the top.

240
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:11,069
I'll watch it from the balcony.
Turn on the rails.

241
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,170
Bill, will you turn on the rails for Mr. Ziegfeld, please?

242
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:18,000
We'll do the second act opening, kids.

243
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,701
This way, miss.

244
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:32,102
Hey!

245
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,103
Paul. Paul?

246
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:38,904
Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Ziegfeld?
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ziegfeld?

247
00:37:38,905 --> 00:37:40,905
Mr. Ziegfeld?

248
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:45,306
Georgia, you're late.

249
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:46,807
Sorry, Flo.

250
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:50,108
- Where is he?
- He's up above. Like God.

251
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,309
Mr. Ziegfeld?

252
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,400
Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Ziegfeld?

253
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,001
Yes, Miss Brice?

254
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:04,302
I don't want to be in the finale.

255
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:12,303
What was that you said?

256
00:38:13,904 --> 00:38:15,704
Well, I just...

257
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:22,305
I can't sing words like: "I am the beautiful reflection
of my love's affection." I mean...

258
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Why not?

259
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:29,000
Well, it's embarrassing.

260
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:32,301
Listen, why don't I just do my first act number ...and we'll call it a night, okay?

261
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:35,602
- No, it's not okay.
- Why not?

262
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:39,203
Miss Brice, may I remind you that you're in my theatre?

263
00:38:39,204 --> 00:38:42,304
So nobody argues with the landlord?

264
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,905
Just wait right there. I'm coming down.

265
00:38:47,806 --> 00:38:51,806
Take five. Take five, everybody.

266
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,107
Just take...

267
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:55,808
...five.

268
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:03,909
Is that bad, he's coming down?
Only if you want to stay in the show.

269
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,110
Look, what's your name?
Fanny Brice.

270
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,511
Georgia James.
Hi.

271
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,012
Tell him you were wrong.
But I'm not.

272
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:14,313
In that case, it was nice to have met you.

273
00:39:14,314 --> 00:39:15,914
Miss Brice?

274
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:25,400
Now what is all this?
Not two minutes ago you said: "Anything you say, Mr. Ziegfeld." Remember?

275
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:27,901
Yes, and I'm very sorry.
But if I come out opening night...

276
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:31,402
...telling the audience how beautiful I am,

277
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,903
I'll be back at Keeney's before the curtain comes down.

278
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,904
I assure you that won't happen.

279
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:38,405
But I need a strong voice in the finale.

280
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:41,506
But please take me out of it, Mr Ziegfeld.

281
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:48,707
Miss Brice, if I take you out of the finale
l'll also take you out of the Follies.... It's just that simple.

282
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:58,608
Okay, you win.

283
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:02,000
Thank you.

284
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,310
You don't win fair, but you win.

285
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:13,000
John, forget the second act opening.
I want to see the bride number right from the top with Miss Brice.

286
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,401
She can walk through it.
Right, sir.

287
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,402
All right kids, this'll be the bride number.

288
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:19,303
Mr. Ziegfeld?

289
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,999
Mr. Ziegfeld!

290
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,300
Now what?

291
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,485
Listen, can I hum it?

292
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:33,786
You will sing the words exactly as written.

293
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:38,987
And that, Miss Brice,
is the end of this discussion.

294
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:43,288
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.

295
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,489
Whatever you say, Mr. Ziegfeld.

296
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,490
I'm sorry.

297
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,491
The winter bride is typified...

298
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:06,192
by Christmas, frost and fairies...

299
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:08,793
And though the weather's changeable...

300
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,494
Her virtue never varies.

301
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:24,795
The springtime bride is stary-eyed

302
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:26,796
And poets often say...

303
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:31,797
No other bride would dare to dream the dreams that April...

304
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:32,598
May.

305
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,000
The summer bride is glorified by Merlin's magic touch...

306
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:40,224
A lucky man receives the love of...

307
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,525
June
July
And such.

308
00:43:42,526 --> 00:43:47,526
The autumn bride is prude and wise at sweet sixteen or twenty...

309
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:50,627
And as a wife in future life...

310
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,228
She'll hold the horn of plenty.

311
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,888
And now a singing bride who vocally encompasses

312
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:08,289
the happiness and harmony

313
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,690
that marriage truly promises.

314
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:50,091
My friend the showstopper.

315
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:52,000
- Listen, you could have told me about it.
- I didn't know about it...

316
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:55,301
...until a minute before when I was in my dressing room,
and I saw...

317
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:57,602
I had to do something.

318
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:04,503
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.

319
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:07,704
It went beautifully.
You were all very good...

320
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:09,805
...and I am proud of you.

321
00:47:17,906 --> 00:47:20,406
Congratulations, Flo.
Thank you.

322
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:23,507
Wonderful, Flo.
That finale topped everything.

323
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,208
Mr. Ziegfeld, l...
Be quiet.

324
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:33,000
The bride number was wonderful, Mr Ziegfeld.
Yes, that was fun, wasn't it?

325
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:38,701
All right, Miss Brice.

326
00:47:42,702 --> 00:47:45,700
I'm waiting.
Mr Ziegfeld, I don't blame you for being mad.

327
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:49,701
But I didn't do it out of spite, honest.
I didn't plan it.

328
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:50,702
I was just sitting here and... uhhh

329
00:47:50,703 --> 00:47:52,203
"Oh, look. What do you know?"

330
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:55,504
I couldn't do it straight as if I thought I was like one of those other girls.

331
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:56,805
They would have laughed.

332
00:47:56,806 --> 00:48:00,306
And they did.
Yes, but it was my joke. You see?

333
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:05,007
They laughed with me, not at me.
Because I wanted them to laugh.

334
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,308
But, I mean...
You know what I mean.

335
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:10,009
No, explain it to me.

336
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,510
Miss Brice can't see anyone.
Oh, not even her mama?

337
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:18,811
Mama...
Darling, everybody's talking.

338
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,112
You were wonderful.

339
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:23,113
You know, we're so proud of you,
we're ready to bust.

340
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:27,014
Proud, yes. But surprised, no.

341
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:30,515
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is my mother.
Oh, the big boss.

342
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:34,416
Oh, Mr Ziegfeld.
You have a hit on your hands.

343
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:36,317
Especially with my daughter Fanny.

344
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,018
This is Mrs. Strakosh,
our neighbour.

345
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,419
And this is Eddie Ryan. He's my friend.

346
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, Mr Ziegfeld. How do you do?

347
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:49,001
Mr. Ziegfeld, you're a genius.

348
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:54,202
To put a beautiful wedding gown on a girl that's in the family way.

349
00:48:54,203 --> 00:48:56,603
Who would think of such a thing?

350
00:48:56,604 --> 00:48:58,804
Only one person I know.

351
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:02,805
We'd better go. Mrs. Brice is expecting half the neighbourhood.

352
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,306
Half? All.

353
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:06,507
Free beer. You come, huh?

354
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:07,908
Beer?

355
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:10,409
Mama, I'll come home soon as soon as I can.

356
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,510
Take your time. I'm gonna be so busy showing off.

357
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:17,611
How many mothers on Henry Street are the mother of a Ziegfeld star?

358
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:21,212
Bye.
I'll see you later.

359
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:31,013
Well, you have a charming mother, and I have a problem.

360
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:34,614
I ought to fire you. But I love talent.

361
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:39,915
And it's hard to quarrel with five curtain calls.
Six.

362
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:43,316
There you are. That's my problem.

363
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:47,217
So I guess I'll have to give you another chance.

364
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,718
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!

365
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:52,419
Did he fire you?
Not yet.

366
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,520
But I'll ring the curtain
down on you...

367
00:49:57,521 --> 00:49:59,721
...if you ever disobey an order of mine again.

368
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:03,522
I won't. I won't. Never, ever.
I'll do it straight tomorrow night.

369
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:05,123
I mean...

370
00:50:05,124 --> 00:50:08,624
...without the pillow.

371
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:13,225
You'll do it exactly as you did tonight and that's an order.
- You mean you liked it?

372
00:50:13,226 --> 00:50:18,000
No! But the audience did. That's why I'm going to give you another number.

373
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,701
I'll choose a new song for you.

374
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:24,602
Thank you, Mr. Ziegfeld!
The only thing is, about that song.

375
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:27,803
A song, you know, it's a very, very intimate thing.

376
00:50:27,804 --> 00:50:31,104
I mean, it's really between me and the audience.

377
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:34,505
So?
So uhhh...

378
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:38,106
one of the things I really feel definite about is choosing my own.

379
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,007
Choosing your own what?
Songs. Songs.

380
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:54,808
Good evening. And congratulations. Both of you.
Hello, Nick.

381
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:58,709
It's you, my first ruffled shirt.
Good to see you. How're they running?

382
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,310
Ahead, Flo, just like you and this little girl.

383
00:51:02,311 --> 00:51:05,111
First time I saw her, I had a hunch you two belonged together.

384
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:08,612
I have the same hunch. And it's aging me...

385
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:11,113
...fast.

386
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:14,314
I knew it. I was sure it was you who told him about me.

387
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:16,315
- I'm afraid not. I wish I had.
- I don't believe you.

388
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:18,616
Have it your own way.

389
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,817
And you had it your own way on that stage tonight, didn't you?

390
00:51:21,818 --> 00:51:24,418
Six curtain calls.

391
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,219
Only five.

392
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:32,120
But you stopped the show.
I did! I stopped the Ziegfeld Follies!

393
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:35,221
I knew you would. I wrote the card
with your flowers before the curtain went up.

394
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:38,222
What?
The yellow roses.

395
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:42,223
I didn't even have a chance to look!

396
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:46,324
Oh, they're beautiful.

397
00:51:47,925 --> 00:51:52,825
"Dear Star, I told you so."
Don't forget, I saw you work out.

398
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:54,626
Where would you like to go?

399
00:51:54,627 --> 00:51:58,000
Luchow's? Delmonico's? A party? Two parties?

400
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:01,201
I can't. I gotta meet a gang of people...
" At my mother's saloon ".

401
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,902
Not again. Can't you skip it?
No, it wouldn't be nice and...

402
00:52:04,903 --> 00:52:07,703
It's sort of a party for me.

403
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:10,504
You want to come?
I'd love to.

404
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:13,305
- You mean it?
- Of course.

405
00:52:13,306 --> 00:52:15,806
You'd better think it over. I mean, it's a neighbourhood thing.

406
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:17,607
It might waste the whole evening for you.

407
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:20,208
I'll be with you, won't I?

408
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,209
Go ahead, get dressed.

409
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,610
Candidly, Mrs. Brice,
that's a good-looking fellow.

410
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:13,211
Gorgeous. He reminds me of
Fanny's papa, my ex, also gorgeous.

411
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:16,912
Wherever he is, he should only stay there, huh?

412
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:24,213
What do you do anyway?
I mean, between my opening nights?

413
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:26,914
Live.
Everybody does that.

414
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:31,815
Hardly anyone does. But I do. And on the side, I gamble.

415
00:53:31,816 --> 00:53:34,116
You just gamble?

416
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:36,617
Yes. Like you did tonight.

417
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:47,999
You married?
No, Mrs. Strakosh, I'm not married.

418
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,999
So you're Mrs. Strakosh's married daughter, Sadie.

419
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,400
To a dentist.

420
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:04,701
Mr. Arnstein, could I interest you
in a friendly little game of poker?

421
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:06,402
Three-cent limit.

422
00:54:07,503 --> 00:54:10,903
I was hoping you'd ask me.
Oh, good.

423
00:54:10,904 --> 00:54:13,504
Deuces, 10s and jokers wild.
What?

424
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:15,805
We're out for blood.

425
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:22,106
Would you care to deal?
All right.

426
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:23,907
Oh, look!

427
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:27,408
That's marvellous.

428
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:31,809
I think he's played a game of poker before, that Mr. Arnstein.

429
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,310
The way he looks to home.

430
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:35,911
He's a gentleman.

431
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:40,912
A gentleman fits in any place.
A sponge fits in any place.

432
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:45,313
To me, when a person's a stranger, they should act a little strange.
Oh, Mom...

433
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:46,514
I bet.

434
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:49,315
I call.
I call.

435
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:11,716
I'm afraid you're too good for me.

436
00:55:11,717 --> 00:55:15,217
I see. I got two pair.

437
00:55:15,218 --> 00:55:16,818
It's yours.

438
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:19,219
Oh, I win, I win, I win!

439
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,020
How much do I owe?
I think 27 cents.

440
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:25,000
Fine bunch of crooks I introduced you to.

441
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:28,601
We had a little more practice, that's all.

442
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:33,402
Oh, Fanny, darling, I'm so happy for your success.

443
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:37,103
Only one thing could make me happier.
What?

444
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:39,104
To dance at your wedding.

445
00:55:39,105 --> 00:55:42,005
Come on, children, sit down.

446
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,906
Talk a little.

447
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:54,407
Should I murder her now
or wait till the party's over?

448
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Now.
No, I like her.

449
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:02,401
Besides, I've been waiting all evening
for a chance to be alone with you.

450
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,102
Where does that go?

451
00:56:04,103 --> 00:56:06,503
It's the alley.

452
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:10,404
Come.

453
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:21,705
Alone at last.

454
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:25,006
Fanny, congratulations!
- Thanks, Mrs. Nadler.

455
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,107
I had to get up on account of the baby.

456
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:30,608
He's a regular midnight fisherman!
He'll outgrow it.

457
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,209
Alone at last.

458
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,310
That's Henry Street. You're never alone.
Everybody worries about everybody.

459
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:43,911
But it's my home and  I love having people care about me.

460
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:48,012
But I don't see how anyone could help caring about you.

461
00:56:49,813 --> 00:56:51,713
Why, because I'm funny?

462
00:56:51,714 --> 00:56:53,914
Well, that's part of it.

463
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:02,715
It's a funny thing. I've imagined you practically all over the world:

464
00:57:02,716 --> 00:57:06,000
Paris, London, the Delaware Water Gap.

465
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:10,501
Everyplace. Everyplace except Henry Street. And here you are.

466
00:57:10,502 --> 00:57:12,602
You've imagined me?

467
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:16,303
Well, I mean, I thought about you a lot.

468
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:18,304
Maybe it was your ruffled shirt.

469
00:57:18,305 --> 00:57:23,705
Anyway, you're like a character in a book to me.

470
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,406
And I hadn't read many books, see?

471
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:27,207
So that makes you kind of...

472
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:30,808
- I talk a lot, don't I?
- Yes.

473
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:35,309
But it's one of the things I like best about you.

474
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,210
Boy, have you got good manners.

475
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:43,911
- It's your turn. Say something.
- All right.

476
00:57:43,912 --> 00:57:48,812
With all these people who care about
you by the blockfull and theatrefull...

477
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:53,013
...doesn't it ever narrow down
to just one special person?

478
00:57:54,314 --> 00:57:55,914
You mean, like a boyfriend?

479
00:57:57,615 --> 00:57:59,615
I haven't had time.

480
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:02,616
But don't get me wrong. I mean, I know a million guys.

481
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:06,317
- After all, I am in the theatre.
- Oh, yes.

482
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:12,218
Well, see, I've been very busy and...

483
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:16,019
How about you?

484
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,520
Hundreds of girls, huh?
Oh, thousands!

485
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:21,321
All gorgeous.

486
00:58:21,322 --> 00:58:23,322
All gorgeous.

487
00:58:23,323 --> 00:58:25,223
Well, tonight should be a nice change for you.

488
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:29,724
It is.

489
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:39,125
Thousands. Wow!

490
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:41,326
Well. that way, I don't get too involved.

491
00:58:41,327 --> 00:58:44,227
I like to feel free.

492
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:48,028
You can get lonesome being that free.

493
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:51,129
You can get lonesome being that busy.

494
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,830
Now, who would think to look at us that we got the same problem?

495
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:06,887
Fanny, you're an enchanting girl.
I wish I could get to know you better.

496
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:09,988
So give me six good reasons why not?

497
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:13,489
Just one.

498
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,390
I have to catch a train for Kentucky early in the morning.

499
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:20,891
What's in Kentucky?

500
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:25,000
A half interest in a little farm. I breed horses.

501
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:27,201
What's the matter, they can't do it alone?

502
01:02:31,102 --> 01:02:34,902
Hey, you all packed?
So, what are you doing around here?

503
01:02:34,903 --> 01:02:36,903
It's late. It's practically morning. I'll walk you to the car.

504
01:02:36,904 --> 01:02:39,804
I' should go in and say good night.
No, it's all right. I'll say it for you.

505
01:02:46,205 --> 01:02:47,905
You know, if you weren't in a show...

506
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:50,506
...I think I'd have asked you to come with me.

507
01:02:50,507 --> 01:02:52,307
Too bad, isn't it?

508
01:02:52,308 --> 01:02:56,708
I don't know. What with the Follies and an indecent proposal...

509
01:02:56,709 --> 01:02:58,109
...it's been quite a night.

510
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,510
It was indecent, wasn't it?

511
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:05,811
Very.
Thank God. At least I can tell Mrs. Strakosh things are looking up.

512
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:11,612
- May I call you when I come back?
- Sure. When's that?

513
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:17,013
I don't know exactly. I may go right on to Europe or the Coast...

514
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:20,914
You see, I never have definite plans.

515
01:03:20,915 --> 01:03:22,815
They make me feel too tied down.

516
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,916
But I'll call you.

517
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,017
Goodbye.

518
01:06:16,818 --> 01:06:17,518
Watch your step.

519
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,819
- You the Ziegfeld Girls? - You can't tell?

520
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,920
All right, dear, line up over here.

521
01:06:25,421 --> 01:06:28,421
Conductor, baby. What time is it, and where are we?

522
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:32,722
It's 7 a.m., miss, and we're in Baltimore.

523
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:34,423
Baltimore?

524
01:06:36,424 --> 01:06:40,724
Okay, girls, that's it. Smile pretty. Hold it.

525
01:06:43,425 --> 01:06:45,825
Good. All right, girls. Hold it, hold it.

526
01:06:45,826 --> 01:06:47,726
Now, where's that new star...

527
01:06:48,927 --> 01:06:50,327
...Fanny Brice?

528
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,928
Enter the star.

529
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:54,329
Miss Brice?

530
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,730
Hold it. Perfect. This'll just take a minute, Miss Brice.

531
01:07:00,931 --> 01:07:03,131
How about a smile, Miss Brice?

532
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:14,632
So shoot the picture.

533
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,033
Now.

534
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:18,534
Oh, very good.

535
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,035
- Great. - Yes, wasn't it? I loved it.

536
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Fanny!

537
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:50,301
How wonderful to see you.

538
01:07:50,302 --> 01:07:53,002
And how wonderful you look.

539
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:56,803
You look good too. The first time I've seen you in broad daylight.

540
01:07:58,104 --> 01:08:01,204
You haven't changed. And I'm glad.

541
01:08:01,205 --> 01:08:04,505
Do you know how long it's been?
Just a year.

542
01:08:04,506 --> 01:08:06,206
And two weeks.

543
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:09,307
What are you doing here?

544
01:08:09,308 --> 01:08:11,508
I'm waiting for the train from New York.

545
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:13,909
My train?
That's right.

546
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:17,410
Fanny, will you have dinner with me tonight?

547
01:08:17,411 --> 01:08:21,211
Tell me all about Mrs. Strakosh, and about you.

548
01:08:21,212 --> 01:08:24,512
When a fellow gets up at 7 a.m. To meet a girl's train...

549
01:08:24,513 --> 01:08:28,013
I came here to meet another girl, named Elsie.

550
01:08:29,914 --> 01:08:32,914
That's good, because I have plans, so you can have dinner with her.

551
01:08:32,915 --> 01:08:34,315
It'll be very dull.

552
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,916
There she is now.

553
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:47,917
Thanks, Jack. I'll see you at the stables.

554
01:08:47,918 --> 01:08:51,018
- That's my girl Elsie. - Skinny legs, just like mine.

555
01:08:56,419 --> 01:08:59,419
How about dinner? Will you, Fanny?

556
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,020
You always ask me out, don't you?

557
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:05,321
Whenever you happen to run into me.

558
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:08,922
- I've never known anyone so polite.
Fanny, l...

559
01:09:08,923 --> 01:09:13,123
But I still have other plans. And I really must go.

560
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:14,724
Thanks anyway.

561
01:09:15,425 --> 01:09:18,425
Fanny, I can't give up this easily.

562
01:09:18,426 --> 01:09:22,026
I want to see you too much. We've such a lot to catch up on.

563
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:24,427
Where are you staying? Majestic?

564
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:27,628
There's a nice little private dining room downstairs.

565
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:31,029
I'll reserve it for 8:00. I'm going to hope you'll change your mind.

566
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,030
I'll be waiting.

567
01:09:34,031 --> 01:09:36,231
No law against waiting.

568
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:38,232
People do it all the time.

569
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:48,233
"No law against waiting," I said.

570
01:09:48,234 --> 01:09:50,134
"People do it all the time."

571
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:53,735
You should have heard me. I was a regular Theda Bara.

572
01:09:53,736 --> 01:09:57,336
For once in my life, I didn't say too much, I didn't say too little.

573
01:09:57,337 --> 01:09:59,937
I said just enough, then I walked.

574
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:04,638
You like these flowers in my hair?

575
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:08,000
Why should I have dinner with him? I'm not hungry.

576
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:10,201
You like these earrings?

577
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:12,502
Even if I was hungry, I don't need him to buy my dinner.

578
01:10:12,503 --> 01:10:14,703
Then why are you going?

579
01:10:17,704 --> 01:10:20,704
- I said, why...? - Who said I was going?

580
01:10:45,905 --> 01:10:48,005
Won't you please come in?

581
01:10:56,506 --> 01:10:58,906
May I take your wrap?

582
01:11:03,707 --> 01:11:06,507
That colour looks wonderful with your eyes.

583
01:11:06,508 --> 01:11:09,808
Just my right eye. I hate what it does to the left.

584
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,209
You planning to make advances?

585
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:30,010
I wasn't planning it, but it does seem possible.

586
01:11:32,211 --> 01:11:34,711
Before dinner or after dinner?

587
01:11:35,912 --> 01:11:38,012
You look beautiful.

588
01:11:40,313 --> 01:11:43,313
You don't have to make leading lady dialogue for me. I'm a comic.

589
01:11:43,314 --> 01:11:46,314
On-stage.
That's where I live, on-stage.

590
01:11:47,315 --> 01:11:49,315
Then you're missing too much.

591
01:11:51,316 --> 01:11:53,416
You said we had a lot to catch up on.

592
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:57,017
So let's start. I'm here touring with the Follies.
A week here, then a week in Chicago.

593
01:11:57,018 --> 01:12:01,118
Then we rehearse a new show after that. What about you?

594
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:05,019
My girl Elsie's running in the Baltimore Handicap next Friday.

595
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:09,120
After that, I'm not sure because...
You never had definite plans.

596
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,921
I remember.

597
01:12:12,822 --> 01:12:14,822
Somebody laid an egg on your table.

598
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:19,723
What is it?
A blue marble egg.

599
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:22,000
I got it in Rome ages ago.

600
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:26,701
It's one of my favourite things, so I thought you might like to have it.

601
01:12:31,902 --> 01:12:35,502
A blue marble egg, and yellow roses...

602
01:12:35,503 --> 01:12:39,103
You went to a lot of trouble even though you weren't sure I'd show up.

603
01:12:40,304 --> 01:12:42,504
I hoped you would.

604
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:46,405
Just as I hope you like very dry sherry.

605
01:12:46,406 --> 01:12:48,406
I wouldn't know dry from wet.

606
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:21,807
What are you so angry about?

607
01:13:21,808 --> 01:13:23,608
Who's angry?

608
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:27,809
Who's angry?

609
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:31,610
I'm sorry if I'm disappointing you in some way, but what did you expect?

610
01:13:31,611 --> 01:13:34,111
You didn't answer my question.

611
01:13:34,112 --> 01:13:38,612
Why are you so angry?
I am not angry! Why don't you answer a question?

612
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:42,713
Do you think I should be flattered because this time
your train isn't leaving in the morning?

613
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:48,314
This time you have a few days to kill.
Well I'm not a kid in Sweeney's. You're not slumming anymore.

614
01:13:48,315 --> 01:13:50,615
I never was and you know it.
Don't holler at me!

615
01:13:50,616 --> 01:13:53,916
I'm not hollering. You are.
That's different.

616
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:57,417
I'm a natural hollerer. Anyway, I answered your silly question.

617
01:13:57,418 --> 01:14:01,118
Look, why don't we cut through all this and get to the point, which is:

618
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:05,419
Why didn't I call you when I got back from Kentucky?

619
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,720
You got busy.

620
01:14:08,721 --> 01:14:10,421
You forgot.

621
01:14:10,422 --> 01:14:12,722
There could be a hundred reasons.

622
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:14,623
Just one.

623
01:14:16,124 --> 01:14:19,024
I wanted to stay away from you.

624
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:28,425
We were heading to something you couldn't possibly have known how to handle.

625
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:36,000
What makes you think I do now?

626
01:14:38,001 --> 01:14:40,201
If you don't...

627
01:14:40,202 --> 01:14:42,302
...it's time you learned.

628
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:54,703
Maybe we should order now?
Yes.

629
01:15:05,604 --> 01:15:08,104
Are you sure you want to stay?

630
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,405
Well...

631
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,806
...might as well have dinner.

632
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:16,407
Very sensible.

633
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:18,708
Come in.

634
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:23,109
Paul, I think we're about ready now.

635
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,710
Madame.

636
01:15:26,211 --> 01:15:28,811
Caviar, to begin with?

637
01:15:28,812 --> 01:15:30,512
No, I don't think so.

638
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:34,313
Pâté Strasbourg?

639
01:15:34,314 --> 01:15:36,314
Good.

640
01:15:38,515 --> 01:15:40,915
Then we'll have filet de boeuf, sauce bordelaise.

641
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,616
Saignant?
Saignant.

642
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,817
Pommes Soufflées, salade d'indives...

643
01:15:45,818 --> 01:15:48,318
Avec du vinaigre et un peu de moutard dedans?

644
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,219
Very good, Paul. Thank you.
Et comme dessert?

645
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:53,220
Fraises des bois?
Very good. Thank you.

646
01:15:54,521 --> 01:15:55,721
All right?

647
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:58,122
I would have ordered roast beef and potatoes.

648
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,423
I did.

649
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:08,524
What's the matter?

650
01:16:08,525 --> 01:16:10,325
If I can't tell when you're ordering roast beef and potatoes...

651
01:16:10,326 --> 01:16:12,926
...how will I know when you're making advances?

652
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:17,127
You'll know. I'll be much more direct.

653
01:20:38,728 --> 01:20:40,628
I'm calling you. What have you got?

654
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:44,629
Ace of diamonds...

655
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:51,430
...jack of spades, nine of hearts...
...four of clubs and two of diamonds.

656
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,731
Take it. I thought you were bluffing.

657
01:20:57,032 --> 01:20:59,232
What do you hear from Fanny?

658
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:02,833
This morning she telephoned, long-distance.

659
01:21:02,834 --> 01:21:04,534
Oh, yeah? How did she sound?

660
01:21:04,535 --> 01:21:07,535
Two shows in a row, three months on the road.

661
01:21:07,536 --> 01:21:10,236
How do you think she sounded? She sounded tired.

662
01:21:10,237 --> 01:21:14,237
She didn't sound tired.
Excuse me, I made a mistake.

663
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:16,338
She sounded silly, she kept laughing.

664
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:18,539
Maybe something strike her comical.

665
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,140
A mother says, "How are you?" That's so comical?

666
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:23,641
She breaks out laughing.

667
01:21:23,642 --> 01:21:26,742
Another thing about Fanny. On the road, she lives like a mouse.

668
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:30,543
All day in the hotel, all night in the theatre, never a drop of fresh air.

669
01:21:30,544 --> 01:21:33,344
But suddenly in Baltimore, MD, she's running...

670
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:38,045
...up streets, down streets, museums, racetracks, graveyards yet.

671
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:43,846
- Do you think it could be a fellow?
Think? I know.

672
01:21:43,847 --> 01:21:45,447
Who? Who is it?

673
01:21:47,948 --> 01:21:50,348
The ruffled shirt!
The ruffled shirt.

674
01:21:56,949 --> 01:22:01,049
Lady, if you're game for this one, he's on the house.

675
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,350
Nobody in history ever had three.

676
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:07,851
Start boiling the water.

677
01:22:18,252 --> 01:22:23,252
I'm proud to think that I'm the man who introduced you to your first lobster....

678
01:22:23,253 --> 01:22:25,053
Among other things.

679
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:27,654
Behave yourself!

680
01:22:35,055 --> 01:22:41,055
I get so mad when I think of what I missed before I met you.

681
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:46,256
I played Baltimore before but never realized
it was the most beautiful city in the whole world.

682
01:22:47,957 --> 01:22:50,357
It makes me wish you'd come with us tomorrow.

683
01:22:50,358 --> 01:22:52,558
See what you can do for Chicago.

684
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:56,159
I was going to, I decided yesterday.

685
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,460
Now I can't.

686
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:02,861
Yesterday you could now you can't,
What happened between yesterday and now?

687
01:23:02,862 --> 01:23:08,362
You were there. Elsie lost the Baltimore Handicap.
I lost Elsie and my shirt.

688
01:23:10,863 --> 01:23:14,663
But I was watching you. You didn't blink an eye.

689
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:16,864
You didn't lose your ruffled shirt.

690
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:19,065
No, darling. I never lose that.

691
01:23:19,066 --> 01:23:22,266
Nor my gambling money. Just about everything else.

692
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:24,367
So...

693
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:27,868
...I have to take a train for New York at midnight...

694
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:30,369
...and the Berengaria for Europe tomorrow night.

695
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:38,570
Stop boiling the water. I just lost my appetite.

696
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:45,471
What's in Europe?
It's what's on the boat to Europe.

697
01:23:45,472 --> 01:23:49,672
A lot of bored men who have nothing to do for eight days but play cards.

698
01:23:52,973 --> 01:23:57,173
You are going to Europe so you can play cards on the boat?

699
01:23:57,174 --> 01:24:04,874
Fanny, that's how I live. I told you that on Henry Street
and the first night we were here.

700
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:07,175
Yes, I know....

701
01:24:07,176 --> 01:24:09,176
I know it by heart.

702
01:24:10,577 --> 01:24:12,177
And...

703
01:24:12,978 --> 01:24:15,978
...you don't have to worry. You're not involved.

704
01:24:15,979 --> 01:24:17,879
But I am involved...

705
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:23,780
...with a girl who has her own work, is too busy to get lonesome.

706
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:29,281
So we wave to each other from boats and trains.

707
01:24:32,882 --> 01:24:34,782
I better get to the theatre.

708
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,483
Yes, sir.

709
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:59,084
Fanny, please don't look sad.

710
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,485
You walk back into my life, change everything and walk right out again.

711
01:25:04,486 --> 01:25:06,586
How should I look? Happy?

712
01:25:06,587 --> 01:25:09,287
But I'll be back in your life again, darling. Very soon.

713
01:25:09,288 --> 01:25:11,088
Like last time.

714
01:25:11,089 --> 01:25:13,589
Not a bit like last time.
So, what's different?

715
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,590
I love you.

716
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:21,191
Do you mean that?

717
01:25:23,092 --> 01:25:25,792
You're not just trying to be polite?

718
01:25:33,293 --> 01:25:35,493
You do mean it.

719
01:25:35,494 --> 01:25:37,394
What do you know?

720
01:25:40,795 --> 01:25:43,695
It's been the most beautiful week in my whole life.

721
01:25:49,196 --> 01:25:55,096
Fanny, I should hurry if I'm to drop you,
get packed and catch that train for New York.

722
01:25:55,097 --> 01:25:58,697
Pick me up at the theatre at 11...

723
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:00,798
...and I'll go to the station with you.

724
01:26:00,799 --> 01:26:04,099
Oh, why not? Are you afraid I'll cry?

725
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,400
No. I'm afraid I will.

726
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:40,401
So where have you been since 6:00 this morning?

727
01:26:40,402 --> 01:26:42,100
Walking.

728
01:26:42,901 --> 01:26:44,701
Just walking.

729
01:26:44,702 --> 01:26:49,202
If you're gonna die whenever you say goodbye to a man...

730
01:26:49,203 --> 01:26:52,803
Calling Miss Brice, Miss Fanny Brice.
Right here.

731
01:26:54,104 --> 01:26:56,104
Miss Brice?
Yeah?

732
01:27:02,505 --> 01:27:05,669
You feel better now?
Yeah. Yeah.

733
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:08,170
Better.

734
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:10,371
Thank you.

735
01:27:10,372 --> 01:27:11,572
Wait a minute.

736
01:27:13,073 --> 01:27:17,673
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

737
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:19,774
Ten dollars?
Thank you!

738
01:27:19,775 --> 01:27:22,575
From Fanny? The last of the five-cent tippers?

739
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:24,276
Yeah, I should have made it 20.

740
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:26,577
Emma. Emma. Where's Emma?

741
01:27:26,578 --> 01:27:27,978
What is it, Fanny?

742
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:33,079
I am not going to die. That's all.

743
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,180
And I'm not going to Chicago, either.

744
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:38,881
Are you out of your mund? What are you gonna tell Ziegfeld?

745
01:27:38,882 --> 01:27:41,782
I don't know. I'd better find out.
Would you please get him on the phone for me, Georgia.

746
01:27:41,783 --> 01:27:44,183
Where's Emma? Have you seen Emma?

747
01:27:44,184 --> 01:27:46,084
Where is she? Em?

748
01:27:46,085 --> 01:27:49,285
Miss Fanny?
Be an angel and help me. Hold these.

749
01:27:49,286 --> 01:27:54,586
I'm only gonna take that bag and that one. I'm not going to Chicago.

750
01:27:54,587 --> 01:27:56,987
What do you mean, you're not going to Chicago?

751
01:27:56,988 --> 01:27:58,988
Where are you going?

752
01:27:58,989 --> 01:28:04,189
Empire Limited departing for New York at 8:30 a.m.

753
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:07,690
... now boarding at track 14.

754
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:08,691
Fanny... I told him.

755
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:12,392
Please talk to her, Miss Georgia.

756
01:28:12,393 --> 01:28:16,093
You can't talk to Fanny about anything.
Once Fanny makes up her mind, she makes up her mind.

757
01:28:16,094 --> 01:28:18,094
But somebody has to talk to her.

758
01:28:18,095 --> 01:28:19,695
- Who is it? - Ziegfeld.

759
01:28:19,696 --> 01:28:22,296
You don't need me in Chicago. You still have four other good names...

760
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,097
...besides the tour is over in two weeks anyway.

761
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:27,498
You've said a lot of idiotic things.
No, Flo.

762
01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:31,999
That's the most unprofessional thing I've ever heard in my entire life!

763
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,300
Hello?

764
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:38,601
Flo, will you simmer down before your ulcer starts flaring up.

765
01:28:38,602 --> 01:28:41,202
That's funny coming from you. You gave me that ulcer.

766
01:28:41,203 --> 01:28:44,703
Now, listen, Flo, I love the theatre.

767
01:28:44,704 --> 01:28:48,304
I love to hear an audience applaud,
but you can't take an audience home with you!

768
01:28:48,305 --> 01:28:52,505
I want a personal life too and I'm gonna have it.
Why don't you just wish me luck?

769
01:28:59,306 --> 01:29:01,306
She can't stop in the middle... What did he say?

770
01:29:01,307 --> 01:29:04,407
He hung up.
Let me have that phone.

771
01:29:05,008 --> 01:29:08,408
Ladies of the ensemble, adieu.

772
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:10,609
- Where are you going? - New York.

773
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:12,910
- Why?
Because I'm going to Europe with Nick Arnstein.

774
01:29:12,911 --> 01:29:15,000
What?
Fanny, you've got to be kidding!

775
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:17,901
I told you, when I meet a guy I want, I won't make jokes.

776
01:29:17,902 --> 01:29:20,102
Fanny, did Nick ask you to go with him?

777
01:29:21,503 --> 01:29:23,503
No, but...

778
01:29:23,504 --> 01:29:25,404
...when he sees me, he'll be glad.

779
01:29:25,405 --> 01:29:26,905
I hope.

780
01:29:30,806 --> 01:29:35,506
One ticket on the Empire Limited departing
for New York at 8:30 a.m. now boarding at track 14.

781
01:29:35,507 --> 01:29:37,507
Fanny what's the matter with you? Haven't you any pride?

782
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:40,508
I love the guy he loves me, I want to be with him. It's that simple.

783
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:45,009
Fanny, you're making a fool of yourself.
Georgia, when something's right for me I do it and this is right for me.

784
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:48,410
Have you asked yourself if it's right for Nick?
I'll make it right for him!

785
01:29:48,411 --> 01:29:51,611
Don't stick your neck out this way!
Don't do it! Don't do it!

786
01:29:51,612 --> 01:29:53,212
Don't. You mustn't do it.

787
01:35:27,813 --> 01:35:29,213
Would you like all of these out, sir?

788
01:35:29,214 --> 01:35:32,714
- Oh, no. Just these two, please. - Thank you, sir.

789
01:35:50,615 --> 01:35:52,615
Fanny.

790
01:35:52,616 --> 01:35:54,916
Darling!

791
01:36:07,717 --> 01:36:10,417
If you hadn't looked exactly the way you did...

792
01:36:10,418 --> 01:36:12,818
...this could have been embarrassing.

793
01:36:16,919 --> 01:36:19,519
You crazy girl.

794
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,020
What are you doing here?

795
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:26,521
I figured that if I waited for you to make your fortune...

796
01:36:26,522 --> 01:36:29,522
...how would you know that I wasn't after you for your money?

797
01:36:32,023 --> 01:36:34,523
I promise I'll never tie you down. I promise.

798
01:36:41,024 --> 01:36:42,424
Will that be all, sir?

799
01:36:42,425 --> 01:36:44,225
Yes, steward. Thank you.

800
01:36:44,226 --> 01:36:45,926
Thank you, sir.

801
01:36:46,927 --> 01:36:50,627
I say, I caught your show the last time I was in port.

802
01:36:50,628 --> 01:36:52,000
You were simply marvelous.

803
01:36:52,001 --> 01:36:54,101
- Oh, thank you. - Thank you.

804
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:56,802
Ring if you need me, Mr. Brice.

805
01:37:28,903 --> 01:37:31,903
Thank you.
Courvoisier, Mr. Arnstein?

806
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,004
Yes, perfect. And a...

807
01:37:34,005 --> 01:37:36,105
...crème de menthe frappé. - Yes, sir.

808
01:37:36,106 --> 01:37:38,706
All right?
Oui, oui, mon chérie.

809
01:37:40,907 --> 01:37:44,207
I like that beard on that captain. Makes him look so trustworthy.

810
01:37:44,808 --> 01:37:47,608
He wants me to bring you to his cabin tomorrow for cocktails.

811
01:37:47,609 --> 01:37:51,109
You're a great success, Fanny, and that's off-stage.

812
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:53,010
I'm with you, that's all.

813
01:37:54,911 --> 01:37:57,011
I don't know how I ever thought of going without you.

814
01:37:57,012 --> 01:37:58,312
Me neither.

815
01:37:59,713 --> 01:38:01,513
- Nick... - Yes?

816
01:38:02,414 --> 01:38:03,714
Go on, say it.

817
01:38:04,615 --> 01:38:08,615
You went to good schools. I went to practically no schools.

818
01:38:08,616 --> 01:38:12,816
You're Park Avenue, I'm Lower East Side.
Now, now. Don't be a snob..

819
01:38:13,817 --> 01:38:17,117
No, no. What I am trying to say is...

820
01:38:18,818 --> 01:38:22,618
And you don't have to... I mean, I'm all yours anyway, but...

821
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:27,319
Well, where I come from on Henry Street...

822
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:32,420
...when two people sort of love each other...

823
01:38:34,021 --> 01:38:37,321
Oh, never mind, never mind.

824
01:38:37,322 --> 01:38:42,922
Well, what do they do when they sort of love each other?

825
01:38:46,223 --> 01:38:49,623
One of them says, "Why don't we get married?"

826
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,324
Is that so?

827
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:55,525
And sometimes it's even the man.
Really?

828
01:38:55,526 --> 01:38:59,226
Forget the whole thing. Just forget I mentioned it. Wipe it out.

829
01:38:59,227 --> 01:39:01,127
All right.

830
01:39:01,128 --> 01:39:02,928
Thank you.

831
01:39:04,929 --> 01:39:05,929
You know...

832
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:09,230
...it's pretty much the same where I come from.

833
01:39:13,331 --> 01:39:17,431
Well, why don't you stop making jokes and say it so that I can say...

834
01:39:17,432 --> 01:39:20,332
...I have to think it over, or ask my mother, or turn you down.

835
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:22,533
I've got a better idea.

836
01:39:22,534 --> 01:39:24,334
What's that?

837
01:39:25,535 --> 01:39:27,635
Have your drink.
Have my drink.

838
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:32,636
Look, why don't we get married?

839
01:39:34,837 --> 01:39:38,537
When? Here? Tonight? When?

840
01:39:38,538 --> 01:39:40,038
The captain looks like a rabbi.

841
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:43,839
How? When? tonight? Right now?
When I make a bankroll.

842
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,340
No, I don't care about that.
I do.

843
01:39:46,341 --> 01:39:49,141
I intend to be the head of this family.
You will. You're smarter.

844
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:52,242
It'll be the way I say or not at all.

845
01:39:53,443 --> 01:39:56,043
Could you win what you need in that poker game tonight?

846
01:39:56,044 --> 01:39:59,244
It's possible.
Well what are you doing here? Go ahead, go play cards.

847
01:39:59,245 --> 01:40:01,245
Wait.
I want to be a Sadie.

848
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:03,000
A what?

849
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:07,301
You met Mrs. Strakosh's married daughter, Sadie.

850
01:40:07,302 --> 01:40:10,002
That's a married lady.
I see.

851
01:40:10,003 --> 01:40:12,003
Can I come and watch with you?

852
01:40:13,504 --> 01:40:17,104
Look, my whole future depends on it. Please!

853
01:40:20,305 --> 01:40:23,605
Can you watch with no expression at all?

854
01:40:23,606 --> 01:40:25,106
Whatever happens?

855
01:40:26,807 --> 01:40:29,907
Can I watch with no expression?

856
01:40:31,908 --> 01:40:32,608
I pass.

857
01:40:35,009 --> 01:40:36,409
I'll call.

858
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:41,110
- I'll call. - I pass.

859
01:40:41,111 --> 01:40:42,411
Call.

860
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:44,312
I'll call.

861
01:40:44,313 --> 01:40:45,813
Cards?

862
01:40:45,814 --> 01:40:49,214
Just one, please. Thank you.

863
01:40:53,715 --> 01:40:54,815
Three here.

864
01:40:54,816 --> 01:40:55,816
Three.

865
01:40:55,817 --> 01:40:58,717
- Two. - Two.

866
01:40:58,718 --> 01:41:01,218
The dealer takes three.

867
01:41:04,419 --> 01:41:06,119
Up to the opener.

868
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,220
Opener checks.

869
01:41:14,521 --> 01:41:16,521
I'll bet a thousand.

870
01:41:19,922 --> 01:41:21,422
I'm out.

871
01:41:27,523 --> 01:41:28,923
All right.

872
01:41:28,924 --> 01:41:32,024
One thousand and...

873
01:41:33,025 --> 01:41:35,825
...two thousand more.

874
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,126
I'm out.

875
01:41:54,127 --> 01:41:58,027
Well, I think you are bluffing, Mr. Arnstein.

876
01:42:06,028 --> 01:42:08,028
So I'll see you.

877
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:11,729
Well, I've got three kings here.

878
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:20,330
I thought you were bluffing.
In this distinguished and expert company?

879
01:42:20,331 --> 01:42:21,931
I wouldn't dare.

880
01:42:24,132 --> 01:42:26,532
I'm afraid this is getting rather dull for you, darling.

881
01:42:26,533 --> 01:42:29,933
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

882
01:42:29,934 --> 01:42:31,534
Good night.
Good night.

883
01:42:35,935 --> 01:42:37,735
Quit, quit, quit!

884
01:42:37,736 --> 01:42:41,336
It's against my religion to break a winning streak.

885
01:42:44,737 --> 01:42:46,737
Goodbye, Sadie.

886
01:42:49,938 --> 01:42:51,538
Sorry, gentlemen.

887
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,039
Your deal.

888
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,000
What happened?

889
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:23,401
It's a beautiful night.

890
01:43:23,402 --> 01:43:27,402
I had a stroll around the deck. Did me a lot of good.

891
01:43:27,403 --> 01:43:28,903
Nick!

892
01:43:32,804 --> 01:43:36,004
It's terribly late, Sadie.
You should have been in bed ages ago.

893
01:43:36,005 --> 01:43:41,005
How could I go to bed?
I've been sitting here waiting, hour after hour.

894
01:43:47,306 --> 01:43:49,306
Did you say "Sadie"?

895
01:46:16,507 --> 01:46:20,607
Honey, if this is a hotel, I don't think they're ready for us.

896
01:46:24,508 --> 01:46:26,908
Oh, Nick. Oh, Nick.

897
01:46:26,909 --> 01:46:28,909
It must have cost a fortune.

898
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:31,410
I made a fortune on the Epsom Derby, didn't I?

899
01:46:31,411 --> 01:46:36,011
I expect to make another with this Florida deal.
So there's nothing to worry about, is there?

900
01:46:36,012 --> 01:46:39,712
So who's worried? Anyway, it's the perfect house for a millionaire.

901
01:48:17,913 --> 01:48:20,713
Nice baby. Open your eyes, look at your daddy.

902
01:48:23,614 --> 01:48:25,214
Baby.

903
01:48:28,815 --> 01:48:34,115
I bought her something. Sort of an add-a-pearl necklace.
An add-a-tooth necklace would be...

904
01:48:34,116 --> 01:48:37,216
Nick, you are absolutely crazy.

905
01:48:37,217 --> 01:48:39,917
She won't be able to wear this until she's grown up.

906
01:48:39,918 --> 01:48:42,518
But she'll know she has it. It'll give her confidence.

907
01:48:42,519 --> 01:48:44,919
Besides, if you play your cards right...

908
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:47,920
...she might loan it to you until then.

909
01:48:47,921 --> 01:48:51,221
You bet she will. Won't you?

910
01:48:51,222 --> 01:48:53,822
- Fifteen. One more. - Oh, please!

911
01:48:53,823 --> 01:48:54,923
Sixteen.

912
01:48:54,924 --> 01:48:58,324
Look at me. I'm breathing like a whale.

913
01:48:58,325 --> 01:49:01,625
The way that baby slowed me down, I ought to sue her.

914
01:49:01,626 --> 01:49:03,826
She's pretty, isn't she, Eddy?

915
01:49:03,827 --> 01:49:06,727
Frances? She's the cutest little thing I ever saw.

916
01:49:06,728 --> 01:49:09,228
Alive, alert...
But she's pretty.

917
01:49:09,229 --> 01:49:14,629
Yes, Fan, she's pretty. Very pretty. Come on.

918
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:16,830
Ziegfeld made no mistake hiring you.

919
01:49:18,531 --> 01:49:19,731
Heard from Nick lately?

920
01:49:19,732 --> 01:49:23,000
Yeah, he calls me every night.
From Oklahoma?

921
01:49:23,001 --> 01:49:25,601
Sure. With the phone bills we're getting, he better strike oil.

922
01:49:27,502 --> 01:49:28,802
Come on, let's try this.

923
01:49:29,503 --> 01:49:30,903
Let's go.

924
01:49:30,904 --> 01:49:35,404
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three, four.

925
01:49:35,405 --> 01:49:39,305
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three, four.

926
01:49:50,006 --> 01:49:51,406
Nick!

927
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,007
Nick!

928
01:50:06,608 --> 01:50:09,208
I can't believe it.

929
01:50:09,209 --> 01:50:14,309
There you are.
Thank you very much.

930
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:17,410
Is that ghastly sound coming from my daughter?

931
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:22,511
What is it, honey? What is it, sweetheart? Are you wet?

932
01:50:22,512 --> 01:50:26,012
Welcome home, Mr. Arnstein.
It's good to see you.

933
01:50:26,013 --> 01:50:28,013
What happened? What happened to the baby?

934
01:50:28,014 --> 01:50:32,214
Look who's here, honey.
Frances, that isn't very attractive, dear.

935
01:50:32,215 --> 01:50:33,915
I wish you'd stop.

936
01:50:35,716 --> 01:50:37,416
Thank you, sweetheart.

937
01:50:38,917 --> 01:50:41,517
You've stayed blond, you clever girl.

938
01:50:41,518 --> 01:50:44,318
I hate to say it, Miss Fanny, but we're going to be late for rehearsal.

939
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:46,119
Just a few more minutes.

940
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,920
Em, would you take the baby up to Hilda for me?

941
01:50:48,921 --> 01:50:51,921
Sure.
Goodbye, my love.

942
01:50:51,922 --> 01:50:53,222
Say bye-bye.

943
01:50:58,023 --> 01:50:59,523
You know what?

944
01:50:59,524 --> 01:51:03,224
This time I think you lost your ruffled shirt.

945
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:09,725
We struck sand and rock and water.

946
01:51:09,726 --> 01:51:12,526
I think we even struck champagne.

947
01:51:12,527 --> 01:51:14,627
The one thing we didn't strike was oil.

948
01:51:14,628 --> 01:51:20,628
You'll think of something bigger and better
while lying in a hammock at your beautiful country house.

949
01:51:24,029 --> 01:51:26,229
It is beautiful, isn't it?

950
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:37,000
Nick, it's been absolutely murder dragging myself
back and forth to that theatre every day....

951
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
You guessed it.

952
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:45,801
We better start looking for an apartment in town...

953
01:51:45,802 --> 01:51:49,002
...on 5th Avenue. - Even on 6th. I wouldn't be insulted.

954
01:51:49,003 --> 01:51:52,003
You know what bothers me more than losing the house?

955
01:51:52,004 --> 01:51:55,504
It's the fact that I seem to have lost my poker face.

956
01:51:55,505 --> 01:51:57,705
Just to me, honey. Come on.

957
01:52:22,906 --> 01:52:25,206
Nick.
Tom.

958
01:52:25,207 --> 01:52:27,307
The place looks wonderful.

959
01:52:27,308 --> 01:52:31,308
As you say, a church can look cute, but a gambling house has to look honest.

960
01:52:31,309 --> 01:52:33,309
And be honest.

961
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:35,210
Come on in here.

962
01:52:35,211 --> 01:52:38,511
Joe, a Scotch and water for Mr. Arnstein.

963
01:52:39,512 --> 01:52:41,212
When did you get back?

964
01:52:41,213 --> 01:52:43,000
A couple of weeks ago.

965
01:52:44,001 --> 01:52:46,001
It's good to see you, Tom.

966
01:52:46,002 --> 01:52:48,802
Well, what took you so long to drop in if it's so good to see me?

967
01:52:48,803 --> 01:52:51,803
We've been moving into a new apartment in town.

968
01:52:51,804 --> 01:52:54,104
I've been helping with the legwork.

969
01:52:54,105 --> 01:52:56,305
My wife has a show opening tonight.

970
01:52:57,106 --> 01:53:00,606
Say, Nick, I'm sorry to hear about those oil wells.

971
01:53:03,207 --> 01:53:05,207
Is it all over town, Tom?

972
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:07,308
Even made the papers.

973
01:53:08,209 --> 01:53:10,409
But that doesn't mean anything.

974
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:12,110
It's funny, though.

975
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:18,311
I once dropped 20,000 on Monday, picked up 30 on Tuesday all in absolute privacy....

976
01:53:18,312 --> 01:53:21,112
The news travels much faster these days.

977
01:53:21,913 --> 01:53:25,413
That big spotlight on your wife lights you up too.

978
01:53:31,814 --> 01:53:36,014
Any action in the backroom?
Now? Yeah, there's a game, but...

979
01:53:36,015 --> 01:53:37,715
Nick.

980
01:53:39,016 --> 01:53:42,716
Just by way of limbering up. Besides, I've got an hour to kill.

981
01:53:42,717 --> 01:53:44,917
I hear they haven't been running too well.

982
01:53:44,918 --> 01:53:47,018
It'll change.

983
01:53:50,019 --> 01:53:55,519
He's not in his seat. I looked down during the number. He's not in his seat.

984
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:59,820
So maybe the guy's late, ran into an old friend or his watch stopped.

985
01:53:59,821 --> 01:54:03,321
You're getting yourself excited over nothing.
Nothing? People get run over, don't they!

986
01:54:03,322 --> 01:54:05,922
I mean, they have accidents, don't they?

987
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:10,423
Emma, go call the hospitals. Every one of them.
He could be lying in a street someplace.

988
01:54:10,424 --> 01:54:12,224
Where's my eyeliner? Have you seen my eyeliner?

989
01:54:12,225 --> 01:54:14,825
Hurry up and get dressed, will you?

990
01:54:19,526 --> 01:54:21,626
I'll call 300.

991
01:54:28,427 --> 01:54:30,927
500. Bettor.

992
01:54:59,728 --> 01:55:01,828
No, not for me.

993
01:55:11,929 --> 01:55:15,729
Have a bite, gentlemen. Keep your strength up. Food and liquor right over there.

994
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:24,430
Nick, it's after 9:00.

995
01:55:24,431 --> 01:55:27,431
Why don't you get out?

996
01:55:27,432 --> 01:55:29,932
No, Tom. Thank you. I'll watch it.

997
01:55:29,933 --> 01:55:34,733
Telephone for you, Mr. Arnstein, in the bar.
It's your wife's maid at the theatre.

998
01:55:36,134 --> 01:55:44,434
Look, tell her I've been detained.
I'll be there in time for the second act. Thank you.

999
01:56:55,935 --> 01:56:58,435
What are you going to do? Shoot the swans?

1000
01:56:58,436 --> 01:57:00,436
These lovelies?

1001
01:57:00,437 --> 01:57:03,637
My swan girls? What are you, dumb?

1002
01:57:25,638 --> 01:57:27,338
Prince!

1003
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:30,539
Was that necessary?

1004
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:33,240
You couldn't walk over here like a person?

1005
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:36,441
Where was I? Oh... I was here.

1006
02:00:07,942 --> 02:00:09,542
I'm sorry, darling.

1007
02:00:13,943 --> 02:00:15,843
How did it go?

1008
02:00:18,344 --> 02:00:20,344
Good reviews?

1009
02:00:29,545 --> 02:00:31,145
Wow!

1010
02:00:31,146 --> 02:00:34,946
"All any show needs is Fanny Brice."

1011
02:00:38,447 --> 02:00:42,447
"New York audiences continue their love affair with Fanny."

1012
02:00:43,448 --> 02:00:45,648
Darling, I'm so happy for you.

1013
02:00:51,049 --> 02:00:52,849
How was the party?

1014
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:57,650
How was the party?

1015
02:00:58,851 --> 02:01:01,451
There was no party.

1016
02:01:02,052 --> 02:01:06,552
The guests didn't think the hostess was in the mood for a party.

1017
02:01:06,553 --> 02:01:08,953
Not without the host.

1018
02:01:09,854 --> 02:01:11,954
Look, let's not fight about this.

1019
02:01:11,955 --> 02:01:13,055
Why not?

1020
02:01:14,056 --> 02:01:16,756
Isn't just spoiling my opening night worth fighting about?

1021
02:01:17,957 --> 02:01:20,857
How do you think I felt out there trying to be funny?

1022
02:01:22,058 --> 02:01:24,058
I'm trying to make them laugh.

1023
02:01:24,459 --> 02:01:27,259
My own husband not caring enough to be there!

1024
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:31,060
You didn't let your audience suffer because of me.

1025
02:01:31,061 --> 02:01:32,561
You're damn right I didn't!

1026
02:01:32,562 --> 02:01:36,862
How do you think I felt afterwards in my dressing room,
with people asking me where you were?

1027
02:01:37,563 --> 02:01:42,063
How could I say to them that a lousy poker game
was more important than my opening night?

1028
02:01:42,064 --> 02:01:44,064
To hell with your opening night!

1029
02:01:44,065 --> 02:01:47,765
Why shouldn't the poker game be just as important to me as your opening night?

1030
02:01:47,766 --> 02:01:52,066
It's my work, and I haven't had a smash hit for a long time.

1031
02:01:52,067 --> 02:01:53,967
But tonight I was winning.

1032
02:01:53,968 --> 02:01:56,168
I wouldn't have left that game for anything...

1033
02:01:56,169 --> 02:02:01,069
...because I thought maybe, finally, at last my luck had changed.

1034
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:07,070
Only it hadn't.

1035
02:02:12,971 --> 02:02:14,871
So it'll change tomorrow.

1036
02:02:15,972 --> 02:02:18,472
The way it has a hundred other times.

1037
02:02:21,773 --> 02:02:25,113
Everyone has a run of bad luck now and then. It doesn't mean anything.

1038
02:02:27,014 --> 02:02:29,614
How would you know, darling?

1039
02:02:29,615 --> 02:02:31,515
You never lose.

1040
02:02:58,016 --> 02:03:00,316
That was my crazy husband on the phone.

1041
02:03:00,317 --> 02:03:05,117
A guy with a deal for me offered Nick a thousand to put in a word.
He took the money......

1042
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:07,718
...and gave it to a waiter he never saw before in his life.

1043
02:03:09,319 --> 02:03:11,019
And he just put in a word.

1044
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,620
You want to play? Get a deck.

1045
02:03:26,521 --> 02:03:30,421
Fanny, I never butted in your life, did I?

1046
02:03:32,422 --> 02:03:35,422
Sure, when I was a kid, you made me wear long underwear to school.

1047
02:03:36,023 --> 02:03:39,123
Some day when your children grow up and you want to talk serious...

1048
02:03:39,124 --> 02:03:41,324
...I hope they make jokes.
I'm sorry, mom.

1049
02:03:41,325 --> 02:03:44,025
I thought you were gonna start in on Nick.

1050
02:03:44,026 --> 02:03:48,526
Where would I come to criticize Nick? It's you I'm surprised at.

1051
02:03:51,427 --> 02:03:52,927
Why?

1052
02:03:52,928 --> 02:03:57,728
Because when you look at him, you only see what you want to see.

1053
02:03:57,729 --> 02:04:01,329
I see him as he is. I love him as he is.

1054
02:04:01,330 --> 02:04:04,130
Fanny, love him a little less.

1055
02:04:04,131 --> 02:04:06,031
Help him a little more.

1056
02:04:07,932 --> 02:04:12,032
Mama, he doesn't need any help. He's not a child.

1057
02:04:12,033 --> 02:04:14,633
The man is drowning. He owes money everywhere.

1058
02:04:14,634 --> 02:04:16,734
He doesn't know which way to turn.

1059
02:04:18,935 --> 02:04:20,135
What?

1060
02:04:21,436 --> 02:04:26,000
How do you know that?
Everybody knows. Only you don't know.

1061
02:04:26,001 --> 02:04:31,000
Fanny, are you so wrapped up in the show you can't see anything else?

1062
02:04:31,001 --> 02:04:36,301
Why wouldn't he tell me? He knows he can have anything I've got.

1063
02:04:36,302 --> 02:04:38,502
That's not what he needs.

1064
02:04:38,503 --> 02:04:43,203
Darling, you are his wife.
You've gotta sit down with him, talk to him...

1065
02:04:43,204 --> 02:04:45,904
...think together what he should do.

1066
02:05:01,905 --> 02:05:03,505
Some of that for me, Nick?

1067
02:05:03,506 --> 02:05:07,806
Won't make a dent in what I owe you, Peterson. But if you can't wait...

1068
02:05:07,807 --> 02:05:10,507
I could wait. I could even forget it.

1069
02:05:12,008 --> 02:05:13,608
In return for what?

1070
02:05:15,909 --> 02:05:18,909
I need a front man, someone like you...

1071
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:22,710
...who can talk, for a bond deal I'm putting together.

1072
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:28,311
It's a big one, Nick. You could make yourself a mint.
Thanks, but I don't think so.

1073
02:05:28,812 --> 02:05:32,412
I guess when you have Fanny Brice for a meal ticket...

1074
02:05:32,413 --> 02:05:34,013
...you don't get very hungry. Nick!

1075
02:05:37,514 --> 02:05:39,714
I'm sorry, Peterson.

1076
02:05:41,015 --> 02:05:44,515
Meal tickets... ...that's my joke.

1077
02:05:45,916 --> 02:05:47,416
Sure.

1078
02:05:59,917 --> 02:06:03,217
Is Mr. Branca here yet?
Not yet, Mr. Arnstein.

1079
02:06:03,218 --> 02:06:04,918
I expect him any minute.

1080
02:06:04,919 --> 02:06:10,619
This yelled through the window from FAO Schwarz:
"Take me home to Frances," it said. So I did.

1081
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:12,120
Will you give it to her for me, please?

1082
02:06:12,121 --> 02:06:14,221
Yes, Mr. Arnstein.
Thank you.

1083
02:06:14,222 --> 02:06:19,922
Oh, Hilda. You and the cook have been very patient...

1084
02:06:19,923 --> 02:06:21,923
...but it's high time I paid your salaries.

1085
02:06:21,924 --> 02:06:23,924
I owe you for two months, I believe.

1086
02:06:24,325 --> 02:06:29,525
Miss Brice paid us, sir. All that was owed and three months in advance.

1087
02:06:29,526 --> 02:06:32,026
I mean, Mrs. Arnstein paid us.

1088
02:06:32,027 --> 02:06:34,427
Miss Brice paid you.

1089
02:06:37,228 --> 02:06:38,828
I'll get it, thank you.

1090
02:06:41,229 --> 02:06:43,429
There you are.
Am I late?

1091
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:46,830
No, I just beat you in. Let's go in here.

1092
02:06:46,831 --> 02:06:49,531
I'll mix us a drink. You can tell me what you have in mind.

1093
02:06:49,532 --> 02:06:52,732
Hey, nice place, Nick.

1094
02:06:52,733 --> 02:06:55,533
It's comfortable and very convenient.

1095
02:06:55,534 --> 02:07:00,034
Water or soda, Tom?
Straight. Look, Nick, I haven't got much time.

1096
02:07:00,035 --> 02:07:02,735
The place is getting crowded earlier and earlier these days.

1097
02:07:02,736 --> 02:07:05,236
When you do that well, it's called good trouble.

1098
02:07:05,237 --> 02:07:07,137
That's what I want to talk to you about.

1099
02:07:07,138 --> 02:07:11,238
Nick, I didn't know you were home.
Hello, darling.

1100
02:07:11,239 --> 02:07:14,339
Mr. Branca, I haven't seen you for ages.

1101
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,540
I've been dying to see your show, Mrs Arnstein, but I've been so busy.

1102
02:07:17,541 --> 02:07:20,441
I just dropped by to make Nick a little proposition.

1103
02:07:20,442 --> 02:07:23,942
If it's some new way of marking cards, Nick, don't listen.

1104
02:07:23,943 --> 02:07:28,243
Aside from that, I'll leave you. Although I'm dying of curiosity.

1105
02:07:28,244 --> 02:07:32,144
Come back, silly. Get yourself a drink and sit down.

1106
02:07:32,145 --> 02:07:35,145
- All right with you, Tom?
Of course. It's all in the family.

1107
02:07:35,946 --> 02:07:39,446
Sit down and start propositioning.
All right.

1108
02:07:41,947 --> 02:07:48,147
Well, as I told you, the place... No, thanks.
The place is doing awfully well.

1109
02:07:48,148 --> 02:07:52,348
So well in fact that a couple of money men approached me
about opening another one on the East Side.

1110
02:07:52,949 --> 02:07:54,749
You know, it's getting very fashionable.

1111
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:57,750
I'd like to, Nick. I think it would go.

1112
02:07:57,751 --> 02:08:01,851
But I can't possibly run two places single-handed.

1113
02:08:01,852 --> 02:08:04,552
And those people don't know the first thing about this business.

1114
02:08:04,553 --> 02:08:06,553
So I told them about you.

1115
02:08:06,554 --> 02:08:09,954
The long and short of it is, we want you as a partner.

1116
02:08:09,955 --> 02:08:14,055
With an extra cut for running the place. How's it strike you?

1117
02:08:14,056 --> 02:08:17,056
Pleasantly. I'm flattered, naturally.

1118
02:08:17,057 --> 02:08:23,157
And it's no secret there's no place I'd rather be than a gambling club....

1119
02:08:23,158 --> 02:08:25,258
Except the theatre on opening night.

1120
02:08:27,859 --> 02:08:30,559
Anyway it does sound like something you'd be awfully good at.

1121
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,860
I've always had a little yen to run a club. And lots of ideas for it.

1122
02:08:33,861 --> 02:08:37,761
Well, then, great. Then it's a deal.
Wait, wait a minute.

1123
02:08:38,962 --> 02:08:45,062
It would have to depend on how much
I'd have to put up for the partnership, because...

1124
02:08:45,063 --> 02:08:48,363
Nick, we don't need your money. We need you.

1125
02:08:48,364 --> 02:08:51,764
Well how much are you and the others putting in?

1126
02:08:53,065 --> 02:08:55,065
Fifty thousand.

1127
02:08:55,966 --> 02:08:57,866
And for me it's free?

1128
02:08:57,867 --> 02:09:02,067
Tom, I can't let you put up my share.

1129
02:09:02,068 --> 02:09:05,068
I'm not. I swear I'm not.

1130
02:09:05,769 --> 02:09:09,869
Look, our thinking is that with your know-how and your...

1131
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:12,870
...well, class is the only word I can use...

1132
02:09:12,871 --> 02:09:16,571
...you'll draw all the right people. We'll make our money back in no time.

1133
02:09:21,172 --> 02:09:26,372
A full partnership for nothing? Oh, except my "class."

1134
02:09:26,373 --> 02:09:28,973
Plus a cut for running the place.

1135
02:09:29,674 --> 02:09:32,074
That's a very generous offer.

1136
02:09:34,475 --> 02:09:36,275
Too generous.

1137
02:09:39,676 --> 02:09:41,076
Fanny...

1138
02:09:44,077 --> 02:09:46,677
How much were you going to put in?

1139
02:09:55,678 --> 02:09:57,778
Fifty thousand.

1140
02:10:12,179 --> 02:10:14,979
Tom, I'm sorry your time's been wasted.

1141
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:19,780
Nick, it is a good idea.
Was a good idea.

1142
02:10:19,781 --> 02:10:23,281
Please don't blame Tom. I talked him into it.

1143
02:10:24,682 --> 02:10:26,382
Thanks for everything.

1144
02:10:55,883 --> 02:11:00,042
Nick, I was just trying to help.
I don't want that kind of help!

1145
02:11:00,043 --> 02:11:02,943
I don't want anyone going around behind my back...

1146
02:11:02,944 --> 02:11:05,244
...sinking money into me to make me look good.

1147
02:11:06,945 --> 02:11:08,245
Fanny, l...

1148
02:11:11,046 --> 02:11:13,246
I just wish you hadn't done it.

1149
02:11:15,047 --> 02:11:18,947
You'd better go. You'll be late for the theatre.

1150
02:11:20,648 --> 02:11:24,748
I can't go. Not like this.

1151
02:11:25,949 --> 02:11:27,849
Darling, listen. Please.

1152
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:32,050
Once I saw how unhappy you are...

1153
02:11:32,051 --> 02:11:33,951
...I knew I had to do something.

1154
02:11:33,952 --> 02:11:37,552
I guess I did it wrong. You know how dumb I can be.

1155
02:11:37,553 --> 02:11:40,353
You don't have to tell me that everything you did you did it out of love.

1156
02:11:40,354 --> 02:11:42,054
Believe me, I know that.

1157
02:12:53,955 --> 02:12:56,455
Murray Hill 4119.

1158
02:12:59,856 --> 02:13:01,656
Peterson?

1159
02:13:03,557 --> 02:13:05,357
Arnstein.

1160
02:13:33,258 --> 02:13:36,458
Something wrong?

1161
02:13:38,659 --> 02:13:40,159
It's Nick.

1162
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,960
He's hurt?

1163
02:13:42,961 --> 02:13:45,361
No, no. He's in trouble.

1164
02:13:46,062 --> 02:13:49,062
He's gotten himself mixed up in a phony bond deal.

1165
02:13:52,963 --> 02:13:54,263
So...

1166
02:13:54,264 --> 02:13:59,264
...what do I do? I call a lawyer or...?
He's got a lawyer.

1167
02:13:59,265 --> 02:14:02,365
Branca got him Bill Fallon.

1168
02:14:02,366 --> 02:14:06,066
And Fallon's the best criminal attorney in New York City.

1169
02:14:06,567 --> 02:14:08,167
Criminal?

1170
02:14:09,568 --> 02:14:13,768
Fanny, embezzlement is a criminal charge.

1171
02:14:13,769 --> 02:14:18,269
Now Fallon advised him to give himself up, and he did. A few hours ago.

1172
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:22,370
He gave himself up?

1173
02:14:27,471 --> 02:14:30,771
You mean he's in jail?
Uh-huh.

1174
02:14:35,572 --> 02:14:37,072
I've got to see him.

1175
02:14:37,073 --> 02:14:39,073
You can't, honey. They won't let you.

1176
02:14:40,174 --> 02:14:42,074
I just gotta.
Look...

1177
02:14:42,075 --> 02:14:45,675
Miss Fanny, is there something I can do?
Fanny, Fanny look.

1178
02:14:47,076 --> 02:14:49,376
He doesn't want to see you.

1179
02:14:49,377 --> 02:14:52,977
It's understandable, dear. The man's humiliated, ashamed...

1180
02:14:52,978 --> 02:14:56,278
Ashamed of what? This is Nick Arnstein, not some hood!

1181
02:14:56,279 --> 02:14:59,500
If these bonds were phony, you don't think he knew it, do you?

1182
02:15:01,201 --> 02:15:05,401
That's the line Fallon is going to use, that he was a victim, an innocent dupe.

1183
02:15:05,402 --> 02:15:08,302
- Fallon is going to call you in a little while at home.
I'd better go.

1184
02:15:08,303 --> 02:15:11,003
There are a whole bunch of reporters out there backstage...

1185
02:15:11,004 --> 02:15:14,204
Come on to my office and go out through the front of the house.

1186
02:15:15,805 --> 02:15:18,705
Why? There's nothing to hide.

1187
02:15:18,706 --> 02:15:21,306
You want me to go with you, Fan?

1188
02:15:21,307 --> 02:15:22,507
No.

1189
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:43,208
Will you answer some questions, Miss Brice?
Sure, but I don't talk very good yet.

1190
02:15:43,209 --> 02:15:45,909
Hold it that pose.
! Did you know Nick was gonna give himself up?

1191
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:48,110
That man will do anything to keep him from coming home for dinner.

1192
02:15:48,111 --> 02:15:52,711
Peterson says Nick masterminded the whole swindle, what do you say?

1193
02:15:52,712 --> 02:15:55,512
He couldn't mastermind an electrical light bulb out of a socket!

1194
02:15:56,713 --> 02:15:58,213
What about these stocks?

1195
02:15:58,214 --> 02:16:01,414
Stock? The only stock I know about is summer stock.

1196
02:16:01,415 --> 02:16:03,615
What's your husband's story?
There is no story.

1197
02:16:03,616 --> 02:16:07,816
My dope was an innocent dupe! Or, my dupe was an innocent dope?

1198
02:16:07,817 --> 02:16:11,417
Did he try to sell you any of the bonds?
That much of a dope he ain't.

1199
02:16:11,418 --> 02:16:16,218
You realise he might go to prison for this?
At least I'll know where he is nights.

1200
02:16:16,219 --> 02:16:18,319
You still love him, Miss Brice?

1201
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,920
The name is Arnstein.

1202
02:16:20,921 --> 02:16:22,521
Mrs. Arnstein.

1203
02:16:23,422 --> 02:16:25,822
Mrs. Arnstein, do you still love him?

1204
02:16:56,023 --> 02:16:57,823
Next case.

1205
02:16:57,824 --> 02:17:02,724
"The People vs. Arnstein. The grand jury has returned an indictment charging the defendant...

1206
02:17:02,725 --> 02:17:06,925
...with embezzlement, according to statute 119, Section A of the penal code."

1207
02:17:06,926 --> 02:17:09,126
The defendent has heard the charge. How does he plead?

1208
02:17:09,127 --> 02:17:12,027
Your Honour, I move for a postponement of the arraignment.

1209
02:17:12,028 --> 02:17:13,028
Why, Mr. Fallon?

1210
02:17:13,029 --> 02:17:17,029
My client's been in custody only 24 hours. I've seen him only once.

1211
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:19,300
I've been unable to acquaint him fully with the charges.

1212
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:23,301
Therefore I submit he's unable to enter a plea without full understanding...
Your honour...

1213
02:17:23,302 --> 02:17:25,402
Nick, please.
Sorry, Bill.

1214
02:17:25,403 --> 02:17:29,403
Your honour, there's no need for a postponement. I understand the charge.

1215
02:17:29,404 --> 02:17:32,204
I knew exactly what I was doing.
Nick.

1216
02:17:32,905 --> 02:17:34,905
So I wish to plead guilty.

1217
02:17:48,306 --> 02:17:52,306
I'll see the deputy D.A. And Mr. Fallon in my chambers.

1218
02:18:03,307 --> 02:18:04,707
I'm sorry.

1219
02:18:06,308 --> 02:18:09,508
You have only a few minutes.
Thank you.

1220
02:18:21,909 --> 02:18:24,009
What happened in there?

1221
02:18:25,010 --> 02:18:27,710
The minimum sentence, two years.

1222
02:18:28,711 --> 02:18:31,411
With luck, I'll be out in 18 months.

1223
02:18:34,012 --> 02:18:36,012
With luck.

1224
02:18:37,513 --> 02:18:39,013
Why, Nick?

1225
02:18:39,914 --> 02:18:41,714
You had a chance.

1226
02:18:42,015 --> 02:18:45,115
All you had to do was say that Peterson tricked you.

1227
02:18:46,516 --> 02:18:48,916
I couldn't say that.
Why not?

1228
02:18:48,917 --> 02:18:50,817
Because he didn't.

1229
02:18:52,018 --> 02:18:54,318
I want you to divorce me.

1230
02:18:58,319 --> 02:19:00,319
What are you saying?

1231
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:07,520
We're just no good for each other, that's all. Everybody knows that.

1232
02:19:09,521 --> 02:19:13,221
Look, my darling, I may not be good for you...

1233
02:19:13,222 --> 02:19:15,722
...but nobody has the right to say what's good for me.

1234
02:19:15,723 --> 02:19:17,423
Not even you.

1235
02:19:20,324 --> 02:19:24,924
Look, you think I don't know that everything that went wrong was my fault?
I know that.

1236
02:19:24,925 --> 02:19:26,425
It's no use, Fanny.

1237
02:19:28,026 --> 02:19:32,126
Look, I've tried to tell myself I'll catch up with you.

1238
02:19:32,127 --> 02:19:33,827
It'll be all right.

1239
02:19:33,828 --> 02:19:36,328
But there's no way I can catch up with you.

1240
02:19:36,329 --> 02:19:41,229
I don't want to run anymore. Not in a race I can't win.

1241
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:46,730
Let me go, Fanny. Let me be myself again.
I can't.

1242
02:19:46,731 --> 02:19:49,231
I can't just let you go off to prison and say that's that.

1243
02:19:49,232 --> 02:19:52,932
Why not? Wouldn't the publicity be good?

1244
02:20:02,333 --> 02:20:04,933
I'll be with you in a minute.

1245
02:20:07,934 --> 02:20:12,534
I'm sorry, darling. That's what I've turned into.

1246
02:20:13,635 --> 02:20:19,035
Nick, you think you mean this, and maybe you do.

1247
02:20:19,036 --> 02:20:22,236
But maybe it's just because of all that's happened.

1248
02:20:23,437 --> 02:20:27,037
So why don't we just leave it for now...

1249
02:20:27,038 --> 02:20:30,738
...and if you still feel the same way when you come home...

1250
02:20:30,739 --> 02:20:33,039
...I won't fight you.

1251
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,740
Okay?

1252
02:20:39,941 --> 02:20:41,541
Okay.

1253
02:20:56,942 --> 02:20:59,542
Listen, you take care of yourself.

1254
02:20:59,543 --> 02:21:03,243
Go out, see people, do things, enjoy yourself.

1255
02:21:04,044 --> 02:21:06,444
I don't worry about you.

1256
02:21:06,445 --> 02:21:10,000
The moment you're out there on that stage, nothing bothers you.

1257
02:21:10,701 --> 02:21:12,701
Nothing.

1258
02:21:14,902 --> 02:21:18,602
The strongest woman in the whole world, that's what you are.

1259
02:21:18,603 --> 02:21:20,403
Did you know that?

1260
02:21:20,404 --> 02:21:22,504
Yeah, sure.

1261
02:21:23,505 --> 02:21:25,305
Everybody knows that.

1262
02:21:47,906 --> 02:21:50,406
So long, funny girl.

1263
02:24:44,007 --> 02:24:46,107
It cleaned up fine.

1264
02:24:52,508 --> 02:24:54,908
You been sitting in that theatre all this time?
Uh-huh

1265
02:24:51,609 --> 02:24:52,609
You all right?
Uh-huh

1266
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:58,010
Then would you see Mr. Ziegfeld? He's waiting outside.
Yeah.

1267
02:24:58,011 --> 02:25:00,511
Flo, come on in.

1268
02:25:00,512 --> 02:25:03,112
I'll get your props for you.

1269
02:25:03,113 --> 02:25:05,113
Any word from Nick?

1270
02:25:05,114 --> 02:25:06,714
No, not yet.

1271
02:25:08,415 --> 02:25:10,515
I've been worried about you, Fanny.

1272
02:25:10,516 --> 02:25:12,516
I'm sorry you've been worried.

1273
02:25:16,417 --> 02:25:19,117
Flo, I don't even know if Nick wants us to go on...

1274
02:25:21,018 --> 02:25:22,918
...but if he does...

1275
02:25:24,519 --> 02:25:27,219
...I don't want to make the same mistakes.

1276
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:31,820
So if it means giving up the theatre, I hope you'll be a sport about it.

1277
02:25:32,921 --> 02:25:34,721
Well, I won't be.

1278
02:25:34,722 --> 02:25:38,022
But I won't worry about it until it happens.

1279
02:25:38,023 --> 02:25:41,023
- Fifteen minutes, Miss Brice. - Thank you.

1280
02:25:41,924 --> 02:25:44,224
I'll let you get dressed.

1281
02:25:48,025 --> 02:25:50,125
Be happy, dear

1282
02:26:27,426 --> 02:26:29,526
Hello, Fanny.

1283
02:26:38,927 --> 02:26:41,927
You must be that fella I met at Keeney's one night.

1284
02:26:44,428 --> 02:26:47,428
You must be that girl from Henry Street.

1285
02:26:56,229 --> 02:26:58,629
I feel like a kid on a blind date.

1286
02:27:42,230 --> 02:27:45,030
Did you see the baby, darling?

1287
02:27:45,031 --> 02:27:48,531
No. I came straight here.

1288
02:27:48,532 --> 02:27:51,332
She's gorgeous.

1289
02:27:53,933 --> 02:27:55,233
Getting to look just like you.

1290
02:27:58,934 --> 02:28:01,134
Who says I'm not lucky?

1291
02:28:09,935 --> 02:28:11,935
Fanny, l...

1292
02:28:14,836 --> 02:28:18,236
I've had 18 months to think about us.

1293
02:28:18,237 --> 02:28:20,737
You want to hear something funny?

1294
02:28:21,438 --> 02:28:24,938
I've had the same 18 months, and I never thought about us.

1295
02:28:27,939 --> 02:28:32,639
I mean, I simmered, I stewed...

1296
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,140
...I cried my eyes out...

1297
02:28:35,441 --> 02:28:39,041
...but I never really thought.

1298
02:28:41,942 --> 02:28:43,842
Not until today.

1299
02:28:54,943 --> 02:28:57,343
Then I saw that you were right.

1300
02:29:04,444 --> 02:29:06,644
You did a lot for me, Nick.

1301
02:29:07,945 --> 02:29:10,145
That's what I'm going to remember.

1302
02:29:12,246 --> 02:29:15,000
What did I ever do for you, darling?

1303
02:29:16,001 --> 02:29:19,601
What did I ever give you that you couldn't have gotten for yourself?

1304
02:29:24,002 --> 02:29:26,102
A blue marble egg.

1305
02:29:28,003 --> 02:29:30,803
No one would have given me that but you.

1306
02:29:32,004 --> 02:29:33,504
And you...

1307
02:29:34,605 --> 02:29:37,605
You made me feel sort of...

1308
02:29:39,206 --> 02:29:41,106
...beautiful, you know...

1309
02:29:41,107 --> 02:29:42,907
...for a very long time.

1310
02:29:54,008 --> 02:29:56,208
You are beautiful.

1311
02:30:09,809 --> 02:30:11,409
Five minutes.

1312
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:17,010
There are lots of people waiting for you.

1313
02:30:30,911 --> 02:30:32,711
Goodbye, Fanny.

1314
02:30:44,912 --> 02:30:46,412
Goodbye, Nick.

1315
02:34:16,413 --> 02:34:22,413
