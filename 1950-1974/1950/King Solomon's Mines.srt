1
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,706
Hold on.
You've got yours.

2
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,132
What are they doing?

3
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,135
They're trying to lift him up
and carry him off.

4
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,511
Gallant fools.

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,304
I missed mine.

6
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,808
You wounded yours. It took off.
We'll go after it later.

7
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,437
We have to get rid
of these others. Look out.

8
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,906
You stay here.
Come on.

9
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,890
I'll bet the big fellow
of mine breaks a record.

10
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,851
What do you think, Quatermain?

11
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,895
Well, they're all right.

12
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,397
You don't seem to have much zest
for hunting yourself.

13
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,191
My job is to take you out,
find you the game,

14
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,609
and let you do the shooting.

15
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,611
Don't tell me
your respect for animals

16
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,072
has turned into sentiment.

17
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,866
There are times when
I prefer them to humans.

18
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,721
Very sorry Qually died.
Bad hunters?

19
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,391
No worse than usual.
It's bad luck, that's all.

20
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,269
Speak to his wife.
I'll see her in the morning.

21
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,281
Hello, Lulu.

22
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,909
How's my girl, huh?

23
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,340
- Hello, Allan.
- Oh, hello, Eric.

24
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,968
Come on. Sit down.

25
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,387
- Bad trip?
- No. I was paid.

26
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,310
I hear you lost Qually.
He was a good man.

27
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,230
Yes, the best. I'll miss him.
He was with me eight years.

28
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,860
Want to take on another party?
Had an inquiry today.

29
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,612
No, not this time, Eric.

30
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,655
These people seem
pretty decent.

31
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,532
And willing to pay
almost anything.

32
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,827
No, not anymore.
I've had enough.

33
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,829
I think I'm through.

34
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,332
Perhaps I'll do this house up,
send for my son.

35
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,628
Bring the boy out here?
It's no life for a child.

36
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,879
How old is he now?

37
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,172
He's almost 7.

38
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,174
I can understand
your wanting to see him.

39
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,343
But isn't he better off
where he is?

40
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,886
English schools, all that.

41
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,763
Or perhaps I'll go back
to England for good.

42
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,972
I've thought of that, too.

43
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,432
What would you do there?

44
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,143
Become a shopkeeper?
This is a mood, Allan.

45
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,896
I've seen it growing on you
the past few months.

46
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,190
You've been alone too much.

47
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,275
England's no place for you.

48
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,028
You've built a career here.
Don't toss it away.

49
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,989
The happiest, finest fate
a man can have in this world

50
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,033
is to be the best at something.

51
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,077
You may not realize it,
but your reputation's

52
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,120
spread to England, too.

53
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,914
- Have another drink.
- I mean it.

54
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,916
Today, that pair from London
who were looking for a guide,

55
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,001
they knew your name.

56
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,171
Ever meet a man called
Curtis? Henry Curtis?

57
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,798
No.

58
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,717
Curtis?

59
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,387
Yes, there was a fellow about
18 months ago, an Englishman.

60
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,139
Tried to get me to go west
into unexplored country.

61
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,059
Had some crazy sort of notion
about a lost diamond mine.

62
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,435
That's the man.

63
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,812
Yeah, well,
I turned him down.

64
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,230
It sounded like romantic
foolishness.

65
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,107
Is he the fellow wants
to go hunting now?

66
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,609
- No.
- Had a letter from him about

67
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,236
seven or eight months ago.

68
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,238
No, it was asking about him.
It didn't make any sense.

69
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,700
It was his wife, Mrs. Curtis,
who tried to engage you today.

70
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,203
A woman? A woman on safari?
No, thank you.

71
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,997
- She seemed very --
- Listen, any woman who wants

72
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,415
to go traipsing through jungle

73
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,250
must have something
the matter with her.

74
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,293
Besides, I really
am fed up, Eric.

75
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,465
I'll tell her so.

76
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,843
If you're serious about England,
stop in at the office tomorrow.

77
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,386
Perhaps I can be of service.

78
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,929
Hmm.

79
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,056
Get some sleep.

80
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,359
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't --
- Come in, Allan. Come in.

81
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,987
- I dropped in for a talk.
- John Goode, Allan Quatermain.

82
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,906
- Hello.
- How do you do?

83
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,491
Mr. Goode insisted on
waiting to see you.

84
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,950
I told him it was useless.

85
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,368
I refuse to give up.

86
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,162
I've come all the way
from England.

87
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,622
I thought at the very least

88
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,248
you might be able to give me
some information.

89
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,708
I see. I thought you said
it was a woman.

90
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,377
There are two of us.
My sister and I.

91
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,298
Two years ago, her husband,
Henry Curtis, left England.

92
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,342
His last letter
came from here.

93
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,011
He was headed west
into unknown territory.

94
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,514
We never heard from him again.
We want to find him.

95
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,599
I'm afraid I can't give you
any information other than

96
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,268
he asked me to go with him,
and I declined.

97
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,437
He was tracking down
some queer legend about

98
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,524
a fabulous diamond mine
far into the interior.

99
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,485
Such stories are constantly
cropping up in Africa.

100
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,904
No, Henry Curtis' project
was a bit too thick for me.

101
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,489
- I advised him against it.
- Why?

102
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,157
Because nobody's ever been
in that region before.

103
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,283
At least, nobody's
ever been there

104
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,535
and lived to tell about it.

105
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,245
You mean, returned
to tell about it.

106
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,871
You must admit, as far as you
or anyone else can say,

107
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,665
Henry Curtis
may still be alive.

108
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,543
Well, perhaps as a captive,
but the chances are very slim.

109
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,129
My sister feels as long
as there's a chance at all,

110
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,131
she must pursue it.

111
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,050
She's had a bad time lately.

112
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,219
Can't sleep nights.
Wakes up screaming.

113
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,013
Dreams about him wandering in
the jungle, that sort of thing.

114
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,558
Surely you must have made
other inquiries.

115
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,060
I was able to establish
that he headed north

116
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,437
and west toward the Kaluana
country in the dark area.

117
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,608
The Kaluana country?
Well, there you have it.

118
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,612
How would you proceed?
The Kaluana country lies there.

119
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,781
We'd have great difficulty
getting even that far.

120
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,199
Then where would you go?

121
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,118
Thousands and thousands
of square miles

122
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,786
where no white man has ever been
and even the natives

123
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,996
are afraid to go.

124
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,205
In which direction
would you begin?

125
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,416
- We have a map.
- A map?

126
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,251
Henry's last letter was
addressed to me.

127
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,421
In it, he enclosed a copy of
the map he intended to follow.

128
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,464
There are no maps.
There isn't a native village

129
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,509
or a river recorded beyond
the Kaluana region.

130
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,603
This sort of thing is constantly
being peddled to greenhorns

131
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,313
from Timbuktu to Johannesburg.

132
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,814
You may be right.

133
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,316
Henry said he bought
the original of the map

134
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,234
to King Solomon's Mines
from an Arab trader

135
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,403
who claimed
it was 400 years old.

136
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,574
Kaluana village, desert,
water, White Twins...

137
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,288
King Solomon's Mines.
The Flying Dutchman.

138
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,081
Captain Kidd's treasure.

139
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,251
Alright. Perhaps
there is no diamond mine.

140
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,961
But at least this map tells us
where to look for Henry

141
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,504
because he followed it.

142
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,465
So we'll follow it.
With your help.

143
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,718
This safari is not child's play,
Mr. Goode, especially with a...

144
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,595
well, shall we say
an overwrought woman?

145
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,180
Elizabeth knows that.
So do I.

146
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,057
I assure you, you have
absolutely no idea

147
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,433
of the dangers of such a trip.

148
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,644
Neither have I.
But I at least can guess.

149
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,980
Allan knows the country better
than anyone else, you see.

150
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,107
But that's exactly why
we want him.

151
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,944
That, and because I can see

152
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,821
you'd be fair and honest
with us.

153
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,824
Well, thank you, but I'm sorry,
I can't undertake it.

154
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,160
My advice is to take
your sister back to England

155
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,288
and both of you pray that
eventually her husband turns up.

156
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,333
It was nice to have met you.

157
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,168
- Bye, Eric.
- Bye, Allan.

158
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,462
Sorry, I couldn't have been
more help to you.

159
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,773
Mrs. Curtis, I believe.

160
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,109
Won't you come in?

161
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,663
Oh, excuse me.

162
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,210
Now, this is Lulu.

163
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,045
Lulu, this is Mrs. Curtis.

164
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,172
Oh, she's enchanting.
She's a charmer.

165
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,758
She knows it.
And she makes use of it.

166
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,143
Lulu and I enjoy having
visitors, Mrs. Curtis,

167
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,477
but I think I ought to warn you

168
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,438
you've come on
a hopeless errand.

169
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,356
My brother told me
your reasons.

170
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,108
There was one argument
he neglected to use.

171
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,901
Oh, what was that?

172
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,029
Money.

173
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,531
That's a very good argument.

174
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,618
I'm willing to pay anything.
Beyond reason, of course.

175
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,246
Why are you so determined
to go on with this?

176
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,957
I can understand your planning
it before you knew its dangers,

177
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,876
but now, your brother
must've told you.

178
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,378
Are you sure you aren't
exaggerating the dangers?

179
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,880
With proper equipment
and your services,

180
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,466
we should be able to manage.
I'm not afraid.

181
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,468
Your courage does you
no credit, Mrs. Curtis.

182
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,553
It's the result
of ignorance.

183
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,348
What is your usual fee
for a safari, Mr. Quatermain?

184
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,224
200 pounds and all expenses.

185
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,310
I wouldn't undertake
this one for 500.

186
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,773
Would you for 5,000?

187
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,071
- That's a great deal of money.
- I mean it.

188
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,241
That's more than I could save
in a lifetime.

189
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,120
- Would you pay it, win or lose?
- Of course.

190
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,747
Even though you backed out

191
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,540
before we'd gone
a tenth of the way?

192
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,251
Yes. You expect me
to back out, don't you?

193
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,587
Frankly, yes.

194
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,174
I'll pay the 5,000 in advance
and a bonus of 500 at the end

195
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,593
whether I back out or not.

196
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,227
You're weakening, aren't you?
You've half decided to go.

197
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,145
Oh, I've fully decided to go.

198
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,356
My reasons are
entirely mercenary.

199
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,775
Nobody's been in the region
beyond the Kaluanas before,

200
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,778
but I'm willing to try it
for cold, hard cash.

201
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,822
Apparently, you're not so
certain after all

202
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,824
that we'd never return.

203
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,409
I'm just as certain as ever.

204
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,494
And yet you'd go?

205
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,123
Mrs. Curtis, the average life
of a man in my profession

206
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,999
is approximately eight years.

207
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,668
Now, I've been at it for 15.

208
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,504
So, you see, I'm living
on borrowed time.

209
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,340
My wife died here
six years ago.

210
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,218
Sooner or later, an animal
or an unfriendly native

211
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,138
or a tropical disease
will get me.

212
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,098
I have a son in England.

213
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,016
There will be very little money
for him if anything should

214
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,686
happen to me in the ordinary
course of events.

215
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,729
But the money you're offering
would provide very nicely

216
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,190
for the boy until he's old
enough to take care of himself.

217
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,359
- I see.
- So, I'll take on your safari.

218
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,695
But before we leave, I'd like to
send the 5,000 pounds

219
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,321
to London for my son.

220
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,115
You can pay me the bonus
when we return.

221
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,616
You mean, <i>if we return.</i>

222
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,869
<i>From now on, we'll say
when we return.</i>

223
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,996
What I privately think
mustn't color the mood

224
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,999
of this fine safari.

225
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,002
It isn't just the danger
of the undertaking

226
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,670
that's making you
so antagonistic.

227
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,965
There's something else.
What is it, Mr. Quatermain?

228
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,719
I don't understand
your motives.

229
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,138
I think you mean
you don't believe them.

230
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,682
- Frankly, I don't.
- Why?

231
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,643
Well, it's wiser if we don't
discuss this, Mrs. Curtis.

232
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,811
Why?

233
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,354
Well, because on a safari,

234
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,773
it's better to travel
with people one likes.

235
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,319
In that case, you better tell me
now and give me time to recover.

236
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,404
What about my motives?

237
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,198
Very well.

238
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,450
It occurred to me that since
your husband's body was never

239
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,410
found, you can't
inherit his money until

240
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,245
you prove that he's dead.

241
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,706
That could be the reason
for this visit.

242
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,382
One of the reasons my husband
went looking for that

243
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,843
diamond mine was the possibly
foolish hope of finding

244
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,762
a fortune of his own.

245
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,015
You see, I hold all the wealth
there is in the family.

246
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,269
Well, then I still
don't understand.

247
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,606
What? That I'd be willing to
risk my life for my husband?

248
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,275
That you're proposing to throw
it away. That's not normal.

249
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,944
It has a smell of sickness
about it.

250
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,904
I happen to love my husband.

251
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,615
Perhaps that's an emotion you
are incapable of understanding.

252
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,200
Perhaps.

253
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,619
Perhaps you've never known
a woman truly in love.

254
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,539
Perhaps, but I have known people
who make elaborate sacrifices

255
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,124
for reasons they themselves
don't quite understand.

256
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,877
Sometimes it's to expiate
a feeling of guilt. Sometimes --

257
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,630
If I were you, I'd examine my
own motives, Mr. Quatermain.

258
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,715
A man who doesn't care
whether he lives or dies

259
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,343
is not exactly
a wholesome specimen.

260
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,637
I'm risking my life
for a man I love.

261
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,806
You're doing it for money.

262
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,141
- Mrs. --
- No, no, no, not your son.

263
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,601
There are things
you can do for him

264
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,563
other than toss your life away.

265
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,148
What's your sickness,
Mr. Quatermain?

266
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,359
Nothing to live for?

267
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,118
I'll meet you in Eric Masters'
office in the morning.

268
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,039
I haven't thanked you
for taking on this safari.

269
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,167
I'm wondering what made you
change your mind?

270
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,210
I didn't know Elizabeth
could be all that persuasive.

271
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,048
There's something very
persuasive about 5,000 pounds.

272
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,091
She's quite a nice girl, really.

273
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,219
Oh, she does have definite ideas
of her own about certain things.

274
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,180
Those clothes, for example.

275
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,973
I gather from the way you
looked at them this morning,

276
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,475
you don't quite approve.

277
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,061
- I don't.
- Why didn't you tell her so?

278
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,396
No need.
She'll find out.

279
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,539
- What's wrong?
- Mrs. Curtis is sick.

280
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,793
What's the matter?

281
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,296
Oh, I think I'd like
to walk for a while.

282
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,047
You all right, Beth?

283
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,800
This old wagon, it's not
very comfortable. It rocks.

284
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,887
-  She's seasick.
-  I'm perfectly all right.

285
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,889
Let's go on.

286
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,348
Now, just a moment.

287
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,851
What are you doing?

288
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,312
Mrs. Curtis, out here,
perspiration has got to be given

289
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,939
time to evaporate,
or you won't last two hours,

290
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,691
and you're sealed up
like a tin of pears.

291
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,443
Khiva, get that box!

292
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,236
Now, this may be the just
the costume for

293
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,655
shooting pheasant in Sussex,
but it won't do out here.

294
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,199
Now, go behind those bushes
and change.

295
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,201
And take off those corsets.

296
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,374
Impertinent, wretched man.

297
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,169
To think I would...
Terrible.

298
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,345
Unbearable behavior. Really.

299
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,570
That's a very becoming
outfit, Beth.

300
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,113
I hate it!

301
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,122
If you'll keep
absolutely still...

302
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,711
<i>Oh.</i>

303
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,856
Don't shoot. Stand still.

304
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,653
That was a close call.

305
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,196
No, not really.

306
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,656
They're not dangerous
unless they're hungry.

307
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,283
Well, how do you know
when they're hungry?

308
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,577
Well, if they eat you,
they're hungry.

309
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,370
Seriously, Allan,
how did you know?

310
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,205
Look.

311
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,968
Why didn't you shoot?

312
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,844
Why, do you want a trophy
to take home?

313
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,388
No, but it might have
killed us!

314
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,264
Well, if it had tried,
I'd have shot it.

315
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,600
Otherwise, there's not
much point, is there?

316
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,936
I didn't tell you to run!

317
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,397
A man's heart can stand
still, so can you.

318
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,723
How far have we gone,
Mr. Quartermain?

319
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,057
Well, we started here,

320
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,059
and now we're somewhere
about here.

321
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,937
That took us seven days?

322
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,231
We have to head for the
Kaluana village, which is there.

323
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,109
Now, Curtis' map starts
where the large map ends --

324
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,902
at the Kaluana village,
and that in itself is

325
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,571
quite a long trip.

326
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,865
We know where the Kaluana tribe
is, but know very little

327
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,283
else about them except
that they're said

328
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,784
to be pretty dangerous.

329
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,411
You've never been among them?

330
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,079
No, I'm a hunter,
not an explorer.

331
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,457
In fact, to my knowledge,
no white man has been near

332
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,542
the Kaluanas for five years.

333
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,210
Nowadays, they're feared
as much by the natives

334
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,004
as they are by the whites.

335
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,131
We're gonna have trouble getting
our own boys to get that far.

336
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,133
We can't be sure that
Henry got that far.

337
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,178
No. We'll inquire of other
tribes on the way, of course,

338
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,638
but we've got to go
to the Kaluana.

339
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,892
This is the only place we know
that Curtis was trying to reach.

340
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,310
How long will it take us
to get there?

341
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,353
Weeks. Months, perhaps.
I don't know.

342
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,273
I've never taken a woman
on a safari with me before.

343
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,193
Have I been a handicap?

344
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,112
Why, no, Mrs. Curtis,
but the fun hasn't started yet.

345
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,075
When it does, I'm sure
we'll all enjoy it.

346
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,232
What do they sing about?

347
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,027
Oh, about all sorts of things.
About their work.

348
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,779
About all the money they're
gonna earn on this job.

349
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,198
About their wives
and sweethearts.

350
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,992
Everything they're gonna do
when they get home.

351
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,501
What are they singing
about now?

352
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,920
Now, they're singing about
Mrs. Curtis.

353
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,672
They call her the...

354
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,924
That means "the lady
with the flaming hair."

355
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,176
<i>Oh.</i>

356
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,970
What else?

357
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,723
Well, they say you're very
fortunate because Bwana Allani

358
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,018
will protect you from lions,
leopards, elephants,

359
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,938
and all the terrors
of the jungle.

360
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,031
What are they saying now?

361
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,703
Well, they say that
I'm very fortunate, too.

362
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,699
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
It was one of those...

363
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,453
It was a dream again.
I'm sorry, truly I am.

364
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,379
Oh!

365
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,858
- Where are they going?
- They're going back.

366
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,401
This is as far as it goes.

367
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,111
I wondered how we were
going to get over that.

368
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,155
From now on, we've got to do
without a few luxuries.

369
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,950
Oh, by the way, did you hear
anything last night?

370
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,869
I thought I heard a scream.

371
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,497
A human scream,
as a matter of fact.

372
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,416
I didn't hear anything.
You must have been dreaming.

373
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,128
Come on, let's get going.

374
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,382
Beth.

375
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,385
You sure you don't
want to go with them?

376
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,369
Lovely, isn't it?

377
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,914
It has a sort of majesty,
a feeling of forever.

378
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,458
Forever's quite correct.

379
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,793
- Looks completely peaceful.
- It isn't.

380
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,921
It's been tearing its own throat
for a million years.

381
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,008
In this one small area here,
there are 1,000 creatures,

382
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,302
living, reproducing,
killing, being killed,

383
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,887
eating, being eaten.

384
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,221
There's not a square inch
that doesn't have war

385
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,431
if you look for it.

386
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,141
Look.

387
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,393
Ooh!

388
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,229
And look there.

389
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,481
I don't see anything.

390
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,274
Now wait a minute.
It will move.

391
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,613
Ooh!

392
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,491
That's a mamba. One nip
from that, and you stay here.

393
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,124
Much of the forest
lives up there.

394
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,460
The vines keep reaching
up to the sun.

395
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,212
They make that layer up there
thicker and thicker

396
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,798
until in some places, they shut
out the sun so completely

397
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,759
nothing green will
ever grow down here.

398
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,844
Look. There's a sight.

399
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,141
Oh, look!

400
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,435
Yeah, a scavenger.

401
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,980
Everybody knows about vultures,
but there are others,

402
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,067
all sorts of others in the great
forest that keep it clean.

403
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,529
Hey, careful!

404
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,866
Safari ants.
They attack in thousands.

405
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,369
Give them half the chance,
they'll eat you, too.

406
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,624
Anteater.

407
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,671
Eating and being eaten.

408
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,256
There isn't a creature
in the forest that isn't

409
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,716
hunted by something else,
except the elephant.

410
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,343
They're all afraid of him.
He's king.

411
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,303
The elephant, not the lion?

412
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,305
No, no, not the lion.
Not in Africa.

413
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,765
He's not brave enough
or clever enough.

414
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,016
Elephant's the king.

415
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,351
And man?

416
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,353
He's just meat
like everything else.

417
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,021
There are no souls
in the jungle,

418
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,190
very little justice,
and no ethics.

419
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,733
In the end, you begin
to accept it all.

420
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,278
You watch things hunting
and being hunted,

421
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,530
reproducing, killing, and dying.

422
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,782
It's all endless and pointless.

423
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,743
Except, in the end, one small
pattern emerges from it all.

424
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,579
The only certainty.

425
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,664
One is born, one lives for
a time, and then one dies.

426
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,000
That's all.
All the rest is <i>yuet saba.</i>

427
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,043
What's that?

428
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,920
<i>Yuet saba?</i>

429
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,797
Oh, it's a game
the natives play.

430
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,425
It doesn't make sense.
It's quite pointless.

431
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,387
A chases B,
B chases C, C chases A.

432
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,139
Then they turn around
and go the other way,

433
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,807
and make a great fuss about
trying to get things

434
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,309
away from each other.

435
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,811
Bits of nothing.
Twigs and leaves.

436
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,022
It's quite senseless.

437
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,399
Except that the fellow
who is here has satisfied

438
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,401
his desire to be over there.

439
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,070
Everybody's had the fun
of running after something.

440
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,740
Everybody's grabbed a handful
of stuff that they wanted

441
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,451
because everybody else
wanted them.

442
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:19,456
And, well, it's endless.
It's quite pointless.

443
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,583
It's a silly game,
<i>yuet saba.</i>

444
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,503
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

445
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,630
You are sick of life,
aren't you?

446
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,673
What are you talking about,
Elizabeth?

447
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,509
Motives.

448
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,135
You're being confoundedly
enigmatic.

449
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,970
No, she's not.

450
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,181
She's making very good sense.

451
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,581
Look.

452
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,376
Meat for the Zavonbardes.

453
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,736
I saw a face over there
in the bushes watching us.

454
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,738
That's right.

455
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,700
Look, there's another.

456
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,827
What do they want?
Are they surrounding us?

457
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,328
No.

458
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,122
They're so quiet.
Why don't they say something?

459
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,582
There's nothing to say.
They know who I am.

460
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,458
They're just checking.

461
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,760
Did you see those fellows
peeping at us?

462
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,846
They're acquaintances
of Mr. Quatermain's

463
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,056
with nothing to say,
just checking.

464
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,870
Where are they?
What happened to them?

465
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,789
Get the meat and the salt.

466
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,542
I have a feeling
they're about somewhere.

467
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,878
They're about, all right.

468
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,846
Go ahead.

469
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,644
I thought it was always beads.

470
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,520
If you had to live here,
you'd find a bag of salt

471
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,481
is worth 100 times
its weight in beads.

472
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,858
They're not stupid, you know.

473
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,402
What happens next?

474
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,238
Well, I'll drive a bargain with
them for the use of their boats.

475
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,074
The Zavonbarde River
lies beyond this village.

476
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,742
We've got to cross it.

477
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,161
How can you make a bargain
with people you can't see?

478
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,538
I can see them.

479
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,844
Khiva.

480
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,053
How long will this take?

481
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,430
Not long.

482
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:49,142
Maybe two hours,
six hours. Not know.

483
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,587
Do they seem friendly to you?

484
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,005
I've got the oddest feeling

485
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,673
we're going to get
cooked in that pot.

486
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,779
They don't seem
to be getting on.

487
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,864
Khiva, what are they saying?

488
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,700
Seven boat go over river.

489
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,077
Is that all?

490
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,579
Yes. Only got seven boats.

491
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,661
He says he's seen dozens
of hunters since he's been here

492
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,037
in the last two years,
but he claims that he

493
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,873
remembers Henry Curtis.

494
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,458
Says he had an odd looking
bearer with him.

495
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,128
Chap with one eye and a soar
on his cheek. I hope so.

496
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,546
Why?

497
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,131
Because I know that fellow
with the one eye.

498
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,674
He's a first-class bearer,
tough, knows the country.

499
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,302
Curtis was in good hands.

500
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,012
I wonder what that is?

501
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,180
I don't care.
I'm famished.

502
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,316
Better get her out of the sun
if we're gonna stop here.

503
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,193
We're not going to stop.

504
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,917
<i>Oh. Ow.</i>

505
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,762
- Beth?
- Yes, Jack?

506
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,430
Hmm.

507
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,684
Beth, I've been thinking.
What would you sa --

508
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,978
If there's one thing that
bothers me more than

509
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,980
anything else,
it's those centipedes.

510
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,107
I've counted 40 varieties.

511
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,568
Have you noticed the one
that leaves a slimy trail?

512
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,111
It's that long.

513
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,988
I think I'll have one
stuffed and mounted.

514
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,740
It'll make a far more
interesting trophy

515
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,366
than the usual lions
and panthers.

516
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,535
Yes, I've seen them.
I'll take a panther any day.

517
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,329
Or Allan Quatermain.

518
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,374
He's not a bad sort, Beth.

519
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,589
What's wrong between you two?

520
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,592
- Something seem wrong?
- You keep watching each other.

521
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,137
Each of you seems to be hoping
the other will fall on his face.

522
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,683
Beth, I've made a decision.

523
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,644
I think we should turn back.

524
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,812
I've discussed it
with Quatermain.

525
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,605
He's willing if you are.

526
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,315
Mr. Quatermain would like
nothing better

527
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,733
than to see me give up.

528
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,068
Today I'm sure he took us

529
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,694
through that swamp
intentionally.

530
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,446
That's not true, Beth.
He had asked me this morning

531
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,740
if I thought you were up to it.
You're being unfair.

532
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,367
Nevertheless,
we made a poor choice

533
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,203
in our selection of a guide.
His heart's not in it.

534
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,247
I wonder.

535
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,210
Oh, I've lost all my hairpins,
and my hair seems to be a trap

536
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,672
for every fly, every mosquito,
every ant in the forest

537
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,216
and they -- and they bite.

538
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,760
Why don't you try pigtails?

539
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,972
I remember when you wore them,
and very attractive they were.

540
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,932
I'm a grown woman, Jack.

541
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,226
Sometimes I wonder
about that, too.

542
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,938
I think you owe
that man an apology.

543
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,898
And some gesture
of friendliness.

544
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,089
What happened?

545
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,716
There was an animal,
a large animal!

546
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,094
- Where? In here?
- No, there. Outside!

547
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,599
What is it?

548
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,478
Nothing, she's been
dreaming again.

549
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,731
It was not a dream. The animal
tried to get into my tent.

550
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,442
I asked you not to shoot unless
it was absolutely necessary.

551
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,110
Do you mean I'm lying?

552
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,528
It dug its claws
right through the tent.

553
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,322
Look at it.

554
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,333
Well, I don't think you hit it.
The bullet holes are too high.

555
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,669
Oh, so there was an animal.

556
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,462
You turn in. I'll keep watch
the rest of the night.

557
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,880
Next time, call me.

558
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,674
I did call you.

559
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,426
You go to bed.

560
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,012
Good night, Beth.

561
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,139
Oh, he's a dreadful man.

562
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,198
- Quick, get her behind there.
- What is it?

563
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,534
Go on! Never mind.
Get behind there!

564
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,625
What are they running for?

565
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,877
Bush fire. They're stampeding.

566
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,462
Look.

567
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,174
That's what started it.

568
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,985
Alright, now, fire.
Keep on firing. Scatter them.

569
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,617
Hey, come back!

570
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,745
No!

571
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:16,120
What a waste of time
and equipment and lives.

572
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,832
This ridiculous safari.
I hope the lady enjoyed it.

573
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,681
Wait here. Come on.

574
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,366
<i>- Calecapesa.
- Calecapesa?</i>

575
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,913
Curtis...

576
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,673
He apparently said
the Kaluanas are that way.

577
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,301
- Far that way.
- What does <i>Calecapesa mean?</i>

578
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,845
It means "unpleasant."
Come on.

579
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,359
What have you done
to your hair?

580
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,611
What?

581
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,489
What have you done
to your hair?

582
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,830
Oh, I cut it.

583
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,374
What?

584
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,752
I cut it.

585
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,046
Ah, good idea.

586
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,797
What?

587
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,883
Good idea.

588
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,510
Lunch is ready.

589
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,888
Lunch.

590
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,599
<i>Oh.</i>

591
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,205
Oh, look. There's our lunch.

592
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,459
Is it an ostrich egg?

593
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,753
Well, not exactly.

594
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,049
Look.

595
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,760
Watch. It's hatching.

596
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,261
See?

597
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,222
It's a crocodile.

598
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,072
Good heavens,
what a strange-looking man.

599
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,740
Who the devil is that?

600
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,409
I don't know. He says
he wants to talk to me.

601
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,537
He must be 7 feet tall.
That face and hair.

602
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,622
Never seen a native
who looked like that.

603
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,374
Neither have I, not in all
my years in Africa.

604
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,591
What's he saying?

605
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,265
He wants to join our safari.

606
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,100
Says he's willing to
act as bearer or

607
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,601
without pay
if we'll take him along.

608
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,186
- How'd he get this far alone?
- I don't know.

609
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,604
But he needs the help of our
guns to get through

610
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,857
the dark country.
He can't make it alone.

611
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,526
Why would he want to go
into the dark country?

612
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,032
- I don't like him.
- Why?

613
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,577
His form of dress.
He's too elegant by half.

614
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,662
He says he didn't
ask us our reasons.

615
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,248
Perhaps you've grown too
accustomed to subservience.

616
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,666
I like him.

617
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,918
Going to turn him down?

618
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,297
No. It's better to have him
with us than tracking us.

619
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,761
Are you sure he said he wanted
to go into the dark region?

620
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,263
Perhaps, he meant
he was willing.

621
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,808
He said he wanted to go.
I don't know why.

622
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,905
- What was all that about?
- Oh, it was nothing.

623
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,157
Look, I've given Umbopa to you
as your gun bearer.

624
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,327
You look after the rear and keep
your eye out for deserters.

625
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,787
Right.

626
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,250
- You're coming with me.
- Why were they so frightened?

627
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,585
Oh, they claim that that's
a Kaluana rattle.

628
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,754
They decided
it's time to go home.

629
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,715
What about you?

630
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,245
They're singing as usual.

631
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,289
They don't seem to be
frightened.

632
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,207
They're singing to keep
their spirits up.

633
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,542
They're scared to death really.

634
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,798
Four of them have left already.
Cleared off without pay.

635
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,758
Took some of our supplies.

636
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,428
It doesn't matter.

637
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,930
With fewer boys, we couldn't
carry it all anyway.

638
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,689
I'd like to know
what's on that fellow's mind.

639
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,317
He often stands
alone, brooding like that.

640
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,943
He never joins the others.

641
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,945
Well, they seem to like him,
and he likes them.

642
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,406
Have you found out any more
about him? Where's he from?

643
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,782
He grew up
in the Karabda village.

644
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,034
That's miles from
where we found him.

645
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,660
Doesn't say
he was born there.

646
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,870
Just that he lived there
with his mother,

647
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,580
and when she died, he left.

648
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,665
I've had several talks with him
in the last two weeks,

649
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,375
but all I have been able
to get out of him

650
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,003
is a vague connection between
the death of his mother

651
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,213
and his determination to visit
the dark area.

652
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,300
He made her a promise
or something of that sort.

653
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,719
Have you ever noticed
the shape of his eyes?

654
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,638
Hmm, they're strange,
aren't they?

655
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,224
The only other place I ever saw
eyes like that was in a museum.

656
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,269
He's like the ghost
of an ancient Egyptian king.

657
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,091
What's up?

658
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,511
Check the supplies.
See what they've taken.

659
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,221
Check the ammunition.

660
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,806
Well, the boys have gone,
cleared off.

661
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,766
All except Umbopa and Khiva.

662
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,726
That means we can take only
the medicine chest,

663
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,728
the rifle, and ammunition,
and the bare essentials.

664
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,897
All the rest must remain here.

665
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,274
Well, we have a decision
to make. Shall we go on?

666
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,777
I don't know.
What do you think?

667
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,113
Well, I'm being paid.
I haven't finished my job yet.

668
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,073
Well, that's scarcely
the right answer.

669
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,950
Beth, this is no time
for an emotional outburst.

670
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,326
We've got to weigh our chances.

671
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,203
Well, from now on,
the conditions of travel

672
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,163
will be the same whether we go
on or whether we turn back.

673
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,623
- Won't they?
- To begin with, yes.

674
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,166
But if we turn back now,
we may be able to pick up

675
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,418
some bearers from
the friendly tribe.

676
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,128
And if we go ahead?

677
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,671
Well, we may be able to pick
them up from the Kaluanas.

678
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,006
- I don't know.
- We're close to

679
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:30,799
- them now, aren't we?
- Yes.

680
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,135
Well, we've come all this way
just to get to the Kaluanas.

681
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,178
You said yourself
that among the Kaluanas,

682
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,722
we might get the first
believable news

683
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,765
of Henry, good or bad.

684
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,396
How about you?

685
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,857
We haven't done so badly
so far.

686
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,444
No one likes to give up
before he's beaten.

687
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,572
Alright. We'll have
to remake the packs, Khiva.

688
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:57,284
Take that, and that
and the medicine chest.

689
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,202
Come on. Umbopa?

690
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,957
I pray that we're doing
the right thing.

691
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,293
We none of us want
to turn back now, Beth.

692
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,296
Not even Allan,
though he hasn't said so.

693
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,757
Thank you, Jack.

694
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,843
Did you ever dream
that you were crying out?

695
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,596
That you were in dreadful
trouble and crying for help

696
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,306
and people were going by

697
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,558
and nobody heard
and nobody cared.

698
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,311
That's how I think
about Henry.

699
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,481
Alive somewhere,
hoping help will come,

700
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,649
but forsaken.

701
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,360
That last year in London,
before he left for Africa,

702
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,322
I used to feel very sorry
for him sometimes.

703
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,116
Sorry for him? Whatever for?

704
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,702
Someday I'll tell you.

705
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,580
Or perhaps,
someday you'll tell me.

706
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:47,918
I'd better help Allan.

707
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,074
<i>Oh.</i>

708
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,732
Oh!

709
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,536
Stay here. Keep quiet.

710
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,715
She says the Kaluana village
is straight ahead.

711
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,636
Well, this is it.

712
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,598
She says a white man's living
in the Kaluana village.

713
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,205
- Speak English?
- I speak English.

714
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,082
My name's Allan Quatermain.

715
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,668
This is Mrs. Curtis,
and this is John Goode.

716
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:38,296
- This is your entire party?
- Yeah, for the moment, yes.

717
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,591
Lost your bearers, huh?
Come in.

718
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,012
Khiva.

719
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,836
I haven't seen a white face
for five years.

720
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,630
You've been here
five years, Mr...

721
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,009
Smith.

722
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,805
Yes, for five years and more.

723
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,724
I like it here.

724
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,183
What are you doing
in these parts?

725
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,685
Just looking for trouble?

726
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,230
No. We're looking
for a man called Curtis.

727
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,526
Henry Curtis.

728
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,737
He was here?

729
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,448
About a year ago,
with only one bearer.

730
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,742
A fellow with one eye
and a scarred face.

731
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,535
Where is Curtis now?

732
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,247
I haven't anything better
to offer you.

733
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:58,043
This is poka.
It's a vile drink.

734
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,211
Do you know where he is?
Please tell us.

735
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,010
You don't happen
to have anything better

736
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,511
than this with you, do you?

737
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,765
We have. Got a bottle
of brandy outside.

738
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,852
Brandy! I haven't
tasted brandy in years.

739
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,403
Give me the brandy.

740
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,116
That fellow Quatermain.
I've heard of him. He's...

741
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,002
Where is Curtis?

742
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,421
He stayed with me
for a day and left.

743
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,966
Had a notion there was
a desert in the northwest.

744
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,469
His bones are probably moldering
in the jungle by now.

745
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,846
Is there a desert
to the northwest?

746
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,474
I don't know. Nobody ever
goes as far as that.

747
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,600
Why?

748
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,643
Taboo. Legends.

749
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,019
About what?

750
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,479
Monsters, gods,
and terrible animals.

751
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,356
- Not about desert?
- No.

752
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,775
Not even about diamond mines.

753
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,993
I know. That's what that Curtis
fellow was after. The fool.

754
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:17,497
I knew he couldn't last long
in there, so I let him go.

755
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:18,998
Are you saying you let Curtis go

756
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,625
<i>because you were sure
he would die?</i>

757
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,377
It wasn't my business!

758
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,170
That's not what you said.

759
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,484
You say you've been here
five years.

760
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,486
You must know
these fellows pretty well.

761
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,155
Are the stories
of murder true?

762
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,449
They are naturally warlike.

763
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,498
Have you heard any rumors
about Curtis after he left

764
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,250
- from the natives?
- Nothing.

765
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,878
Unless you believe what One-Eye
said when he came back.

766
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,005
- Came back?
- Yes.

767
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,299
Alone, after about three weeks.

768
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,427
What did he say?

769
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,683
Tell us about One-Eye.

770
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,521
He came back here.
Staggered back.

771
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:27,317
He was dying, lasted about
four hours. Died right here.

772
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,652
And we buried him.

773
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,446
I think we buried him.

774
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,407
I won't guarantee
that my people didn't...

775
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,661
They're very short of meat here.

776
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,705
There's not much game
in this region.

777
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,583
What there is, we can't get
without ammunition.

778
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,427
What did One-Eye say
before he died?

779
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,596
He was out of his head.

780
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,141
Rambled about burning sun and
burning earth again and again.

781
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,185
Did he say anything
about Curtis?

782
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,604
I gather he deserted him
and came back.

783
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,611
- Have another drink.
- Oh.

784
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,369
Now, you're gonna get us
out of here.

785
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,162
What do you think
you're doing?

786
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,956
You had no intention of letting
us leave this place alive.

787
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,207
Your name's Van Brun.

788
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,625
I've had your description
for years.

789
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,001
He's wanted for murder
in Nairobi.

790
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,336
He can't afford for anyone
to get away

791
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,088
with an account
of his whereabouts.

792
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,215
Yes, he said he let Henry go
because he was sure to die.

793
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,217
Yes, but you're not so sure
about us, are you?

794
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:36,052
Get out. Go away.

795
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,845
You're gonna get us
out of here before those

796
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:40,515
fellows outside start warming up
and carrying out your orders.

797
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,600
I'm not sure
I can control them now.

798
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,769
We will soon find out.

799
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,541
Stay close behind me. Alright.

800
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,475
Go on.

801
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:29,123
Stop. Keep up here with me.

802
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:32,335
I can't keep up.
I just can't.

803
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,588
Khiva. Keep him covered.

804
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,174
Come on, you must try.

805
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,814
Khiva.

806
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,191
Goode, give me a hand
here, will you?

807
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,242
Let's get out of here.

808
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,047
Is he coming?

809
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,720
Oh, God.

810
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,949
I told him to leave
a false trail.

811
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,047
Alright, we're going up here.

812
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,799
Goode, get up that tree.
Keep a lookout for us.

813
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,050
Come on. You're coming with me.

814
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,551
- Oh, no, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

815
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,512
Now, wait here.

816
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,475
Give me your hand.
Alright, come on.

817
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,520
- Hold on to there.
- Yes. Alright.

818
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,355
Oh!

819
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,940
I got you.

820
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,819
Oh!

821
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:04,904
I got you. Alright.

822
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:40,875
Oh!

823
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,385
Ahh!

824
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,539
Well, there's the desert.

825
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,625
The map was right.

826
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,378
Well, we'll stay here until dark
and go on by night.

827
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,422
It'll be too hot
to travel by day.

828
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:11,590
There may be a diamond mine
out there.

829
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,175
The map was right
about the desert.

830
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,844
It may be right
about the mine.

831
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:17,221
I'll be happier if it's right
about the water hole.

832
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,976
That fellow's probably heard
about the mines.

833
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,437
That would explain him.

834
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,814
But he's got a long way to go
to get to them.

835
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,108
There's the problem
of getting back.

836
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,986
Well, we could always sprout
wings and fly back to England.

837
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,363
You're awfully
cheerful about it.

838
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,449
Well, I for one don't care.
I want to see what's out there.

839
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,909
Everything on the map
is correct so far.

840
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,953
And I have a feeling that
when the mists clear,

841
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,372
we're gonna see the mountains
marked on that map.

842
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,583
One-Eye babbled to Smith
about burning earth

843
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,043
and burning sun.

844
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:48,919
That means that Curtis
reached this desert.

845
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,505
And if the water is where
it's marked on the map,

846
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,424
he may have reached that, too.

847
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,150
There they are, the mountains.

848
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,028
The White Twins. You see them,
those two peaks?

849
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,490
Now, if we head
straight for them,

850
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:20,159
we should see the water
indicated on the map.

851
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,079
I'll take a bearing while
I can still see them.

852
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,789
What does a water hole
look like?

853
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,583
Well, it can look
like an oasis,

854
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,835
or it can look like that.

855
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,464
I should think it would
take us about five days to get

856
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,216
to the mountains.

857
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,546
Now, two swallows, no more.

858
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,466
We'll rest here until
the sun goes down.

859
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,011
Get some sleep.

860
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,336
Oh!

861
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,006
Good heavens, it's like
English countryside.

862
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,508
Temperate country
in the heart of Africa.

863
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,301
That's because
it's a plateau.

864
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,346
Must be thousands of feet higher
than the jungle or the desert.

865
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,358
Some natives bury
their dead that way.

866
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,300
It's Curtis'.

867
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,636
Got a message on it.

868
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:10,723
"Ammunition gone,
heading northwest.

869
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:14,268
Inform Elizabeth Curtis,
73 Grosvenor Square, London.

870
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,522
Henry Curtis."

871
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,733
He's alive.

872
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,693
Out there somewhere.

873
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,000
You said someday
you'd tell me.

874
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,085
You send <i>you'd tell me.</i>

875
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,090
You weren't in love with Henry,
and you treated him badly.

876
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,176
That's why he ran off
to Africa.

877
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,304
That's about it.

878
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,098
Hasn't this trip been
penance enough?

879
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,934
More than enough.

880
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,604
In more ways than you
can guess, Jack.

881
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,564
I'm not blind.

882
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,777
The human heart's
a strange thing.

883
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,780
When I started on this trip,
I was very confused.

884
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,449
I thought my motives
were so noble but...

885
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,827
Allan guessed the truth,
the first time I met him.

886
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,788
It was guilt.

887
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,082
I know it now, and I'm better
for knowing it.

888
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,209
The nightmares are over.

889
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:24,671
But another sort of nightmare
seems to be beginning.

890
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,508
What are we to do?

891
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,593
Can't we face that
when we come to it?

892
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,813
Alright, let's go.
Come on.

893
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,735
Look.

894
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:52,533
That's the first game
we've seen in weeks.

895
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,660
Dare we invest a bullet
in some fresh meat?

896
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,703
I have exactly
three shots left.

897
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,832
- Let's vote on it.
- I'm awfully hungry.

898
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,292
Alright.

899
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,378
Don't miss.

900
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,889
Allan!

901
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,417
What are they saying?

902
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:44,835
I don't understand
a word of it.

903
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,378
It's a dialect
I've never heard before.

904
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,338
This explains Umbopa.

905
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,257
He's come home.
These are his people.

906
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,053
He says there was
a white man here.

907
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,514
Could've been Curtis. In fact,
it's almost a certainty.

908
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,932
Why?

909
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,893
Because they've never
seen a gun before.

910
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,769
Curtis had no gun.

911
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,401
I think your magic
frightened that one.

912
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,154
My guess is he's gone ahead
to warn the others.

913
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,268
It appears we've been
traveling with a king.

914
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:44,811
A what?

915
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,231
A king in rags, returning
home to claim a kingdom

916
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,024
that was stolen from him.

917
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,570
He says it's
the mark of a king.

918
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:56,949
Every time a king is born,
they carve that snake on him.

919
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,620
Says they belong to a tribe
called the Watussi.

920
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,497
They've offered
to lead us there.

921
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,462
The present king's Umbopa's
cousin, called Twala.

922
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,173
They say he's not a very nice
fellow. Bad king, cruel.

923
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,675
King Twala is not going to be

924
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,260
happy at the sight
of that snake.

925
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,637
We do seem to be traveling
with a cargo of dynamite.

926
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:21,056
It promises to be exciting.

927
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,392
Exciting?

928
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,519
I'm sorry.

929
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,960
He says there's a lot of
discontent here already.

930
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,546
Kafa, that's the old boy,
and some of the others

931
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,339
are fed up with
the present king.

932
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:55,841
There's a civil war brewing.

933
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,802
With Umbopa returning,
it may come to a head.

934
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,098
Incredible!

935
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,142
- I've seen them before.
- Where?

936
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:08,520
On the walls of Egyptian tombs,
exactly such cattle.

937
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,231
The old man said the Watussi
came here from the north.

938
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,358
The north could be Egypt.

939
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,325
Umbopa's gone.

940
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,201
It's unlike him
to have deserted us.

941
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,413
Do you suppose those two
were in league with the king?

942
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,877
Our reception committee.

943
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:34,004
So, Blue-Stripes
did announce our arrival.

944
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,464
Jack, you better shove

945
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:36,757
your half of the ammunition
up the spout.

946
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,300
How do we behave?

947
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,135
Friendly but aloof
and dignified.

948
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,221
They've heard about the magic of
our weapons, so show your guns.

949
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:50,687
Don't know what you're

950
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,606
talking about, old chap,
but lead on.

951
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,143
That's either
a speech of welcome

952
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,895
or an announcement
of our imminent death.

953
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,501
That wasn't very successful.

954
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,837
They don't understand
the usual dialects.

955
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:44,301
Have you seen white man?

956
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:47,220
White man? Curtis?

957
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,441
Wait a minute,
this is the place. This is it.

958
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:02,277
Look. Look on
the king's forehead.

959
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,698
You know what that is?
That's an uncut diamond.

960
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,703
Look. The old witch doctor's
wearing one, too.

961
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:17,167
If we're ever gonna find Henry
Curtis, this is the place.

962
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,472
Oh!

963
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,851
- Good shot.
- Now, we know their intentions.

964
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,478
They also know
the power of our gun.

965
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,355
But they don't know we've only
got one bullet left.

966
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,331
Curtis.

967
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:58,500
- Curtis?
- Curtis.

968
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,639
I hope that means he's gonna
take us to Curtis.

969
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,015
That's a chance
we'll have to take.

970
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,059
We've no other choice.

971
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,134
King Solomon's Mines.

972
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,349
Come on, get back!

973
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:31,796
Uh, it's hopeless.

974
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:34,174
We'll never dig
our way out of here.

975
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,093
The only end to this
is suffocation.

976
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,031
Torches.

977
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,783
We've been in here for ages.

978
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,035
The torches should be dying
for lack of air.

979
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,290
There's some air
coming in here somewhere.

980
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:20,303
It's here. Hold this.

981
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:24,182
Come on, pull.

982
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:31,291
Take a deep breath, all right?

983
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,624
- The drums of the Watussi.
- Celebrating our death.

984
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:14,083
Look, Elizabeth, can you go on?

985
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,752
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

986
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:17,253
- Quick. Come on.
- Poor Umbopa.

987
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:18,922
He was very nearly a king.

988
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:24,594
Quick.

989
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,142
It's Umbopa.

990
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,654
The insurrection has started.
These are the rebels.

991
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:46,324
Well, we were expecting
a civil war, weren't we?

992
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:49,035
Umbopa says that according
to the customs of his people,

993
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,370
two claimants to the throne
must settle it by

994
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:51,746
hand-to-hand combat.

995
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,665
They discovered it saves
war and bloodshed.

996
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,167
- Do we go along?
- It'll be safer with them.

997
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:59,212
Here, take this. It's not
loaded, but nobody will know.

998
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,130
Come on.

999
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,112
This is where
the fun begins.

1000
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:02,473
Look out!

1001
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:24,870
It's all right now.
It's all over.

1002
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:30,126
It seems we're gonna live.
