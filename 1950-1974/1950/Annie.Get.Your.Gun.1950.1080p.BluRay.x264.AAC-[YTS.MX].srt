What's going on here?

63
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,146
Indians!

64
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:47,922
Now look here.
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,312
Well, I'm busy now. You'll have
to make an appointment.

66
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:55,734
- Hey, stop that.
- My good man...

67
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,115
Are you suggesting
we keep the people of this town

68
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,809
in ignorance about
the grandest show on earth?

69
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,473
I'm suggesting
that you clear out of here.

70
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,479
This is my hotel. I won't
have any signs tacked up.

71
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,835
Why, you must be, uh, uh...

72
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:06,922
Uh, uh, don't tell me.

73
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,338
Uh, Mr. Wilson.

74
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:09,540
Well, how do you do, sir?

75
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:10,749
This is a great pleasure.

76
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,004
Allow me to introduce myself.

77
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,301
I'm Charles Davenport

78
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:14,866
personal manager
for Buffalo Bill Cody.

79
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,492
Well, I'm glad to
know you, but you can't...

80
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,035
When we'll hold our
shooting match this afternoon

81
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,720
everybody in town
will be here watching.

82
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,414
Why, it's the greatest
advertising in the world.

83
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:22,598
Hey, what shooting match?

84
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,129
Frank Butler against
your local shot.

85
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,397
We do it in every town.

86
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:26,974
Not here, you don't.
This is my hotel

87
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,275
and my lawn, and you're
not holding any match on it.

88
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,273
Mr. Wilson,
we're taking ten of your room.

89
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,854
For all the cowboys and Indians?

90
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,281
For the headliners. The Indians
can sleep in the lobby.

91
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,596
- Indians! Oh, boy!
- Yeah, okay.

92
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,156
I don't want any actors.

93
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,578
I just had Pawnee Bill
and his far east show here.

94
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,810
And some of them chase my guest
up and downstairs on horseback.

95
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,495
Now take you stuff and get.

96
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,747
Hey, nice lawn you got here.
I'll rent it from you.

97
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:48,149
Twenty five dollars
for the afternoon.

98
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,709
- No. No.
- Fifty dollars.

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,791
How about fifty dollars
in cash and two squaws?

100
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,045
No. No.

101
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:54,876
How about 50 squaws
and $2 in cash?

102
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,006
- No.
- No?

103
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,257
No, no, kid.

104
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:58,701
Look, I'm gonna
feed you to the Indians.

105
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,216
Indian! Oh, boy!

106
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:04,929
- Hey, uh, Charlie.
- Yeah?

107
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,809
Looks a little small
for the contest though.

108
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,377
- Oh, you don't like it, huh?
- Not much.

109
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,016
That's good
'cause you haven't got it.

110
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:12,067
- Who says so?
- He does.

111
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,318
Get that horse out of here.

112
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,774
He seems to think
it's his hotel.

113
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,154
Oh, did you mention my name?

114
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,703
He stood up under it.

115
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,157
Well, girls...
Here's some passes for the show.

116
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,788
- Thank you, Frank.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:28,288
Don't miss my entrance, huh?

118
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,792
Alright, Frank.
Don't forget dinner now.

119
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,418
- Bye, Frank.
- I'll be there.

120
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:33,669
- Alright.
- Bye.

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,250
Bye.

122
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,087
I'm Frank Butler.
You've heard of me?

123
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,701
Yes, you're the fellow
without a place to sleep.

124
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:42,636
Wait a minute.

125
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,012
I'm here to do you a favor.

126
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,220
I'm gonna give you
a chance to win a $100.

127
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:47,429
Yeah, how?

128
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:48,809
Just get the local champion up

129
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,016
and I'll give you
a side bid of a $100

130
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,726
against ten rooms
for our actors.

131
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,652
No, sir.

132
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:57,260
Now clear all this stuff off the
porch before I call the marshal.

133
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,866
- You sure charmed him.
- Yeah, we don't need him.

134
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,199
Tell the boys to
start packin' up.

135
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,684
We'll hold the match
back at the fairground.

136
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,948
Yes, your majesty.

137
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,704
- See you later.
- Yes, your majesty.

138
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,707
Alright, fellas,
start loadin' up.

139
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,129
We're movin' back to town.

140
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,756
I'll go back and break
the good news to Buffalo Bill.

141
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:20,462
Hey, Dolly!

142
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:21,672
Dolly!

143
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,176
Dolly, come on, we're movin'.

144
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:26,760
Movin'? I'm not movin'
again for anybody!

145
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:29,767
Alright, you stay here
and come back in with the boys.

146
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,868
I've been shot.

147
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,488
Indians!

148
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,040
Indians?

149
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,540
That's my bird.

150
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:56,590
Did you fire that shot?

151
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,007
It wasn't nothin'.

152
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,459
It wasn't nothing?

153
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:00,760
You could have killed me!

154
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,127
- Give me that bird.
- It's mine.

155
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,388
I shot it.

156
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,137
You shot it right off my hat.

157
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,388
How did it get up there?

158
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,186
I sewed it up there.

159
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,013
What for? It ain't no good.

160
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,439
Ain't got no meat on it.

161
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,811
It's not an eating bird.

162
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:18,236
- It's a wearing bird.
- Oh.

163
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,967
Well, alright, ma'am,
but around these parts

164
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,469
you're gonna have
to keep sewing it on

165
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:23,012
'cause folks are gonna
keep shooting it off.

166
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,197
You've ruined it!

167
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,950
Yeah, it sure looks beat, ma'am.

168
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,577
Here, have one of mine.

169
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:32,375
Oh, get that
filthy thing away from me!

170
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:33,622
She ain't filthy.

171
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,044
She looks better than you do

172
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,042
and she's got
a bullet in her head.

173
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,339
I heard shooting.

174
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,962
This creature
tried to murder me.

175
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,918
- Is that gun loaded?
- Sure.

176
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,550
- But I can empty it quick.
- Oh, no!

177
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,632
Wait for me!

178
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,842
Oh, I wouldn't
have really shot her.

179
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:51,394
Oh, that's mighty
civilized of you.

180
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,722
Say, a fellow down
the road a piece tells me

181
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,307
this here's a boarding hotel.

182
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,767
Yeah, well, what if it is?

183
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:58,692
Well, maybe you and me
can do some trading.

184
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,236
What have you got to trade?

185
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,564
Well, I got quails, wild
ducks and I got grouses...

186
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,320
No, I can get
all the game I want.

187
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,527
Yeah, but when folks eat
the kind of game you get

188
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:08,452
they keep spitting out buckshot.

189
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,371
Teeth, sometimes too.

190
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,119
Mine's different.

191
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,042
Come on out, now.
The man won't chase you.

192
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,756
Come on. It's alright.

193
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,004
Honest.

194
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,883
Oh, kid sisters
and little brother

195
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:27,339
ain't used to people yet.

196
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,141
They never been out
of Darke county before.

197
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,015
Come on. Shake your tails!

198
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,438
The man's a-waiting on you.

199
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,316
Hurry up!

200
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,315
He can't wait all day.

201
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,322
They, uh, look
a little dusty, don't they?

202
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,624
We're in business together.

203
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:56,292
I pop 'em, she plucks 'em

204
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,744
she picks 'em,
and she pulls 'em.

205
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,420
- Well, who is he?
- Little Jake.

206
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,623
Oh, he's my bird dog.

207
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,128
Jake, stop your sniffing.

208
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,631
What you got a sleeve for?

209
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,050
Here you are, mister.

210
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,347
Look it over.

211
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,844
Lift up its wings.

212
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,471
No buckshot in that bird.

213
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:14,928
Just one little
tiny hole in its head.

214
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,979
Mighty pretty shooting.

215
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,728
Mighty pretty eating, too.

216
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,104
And for every one you take
you've got to give me, uh,

217
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,732
two nickels and a dime.

218
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,484
Alright, I'll take two dozen.

219
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,281
How many is that?

220
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,699
Twenty-four.

221
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,243
Who do we know
can count up to 24?

222
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,870
I can count up to 20.

223
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,997
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

224
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,454
I can only give you 20.

225
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,504
Alright.
Leave the Bill with 'em.

226
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,047
- What's a Bill?
- Why? Bill's a voucher.

227
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:49,220
Don't you keep books?
Don't any of you read or write?

228
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:52,765
We don't read
as good as everybody.

229
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,264

Get on over to the house
with them birds.

284
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah, the kitchen's
around the back.

285
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,636
And be sure you don't
count more than 20 now.

286
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:44,811
Don't worry. He can't.

287
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,730
Go on. Get along with you.

288
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,354
Say, that was mighty pretty.

289
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,275
Thanks. I like to sing.

290
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,899
'Course,
shooting's a lot more fun.

291
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,981
I've been shooting
since I was 10 years old.

292
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:55,315
Fancy shooting?

293
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,617
I could shoot
the fuzz off a peach.

294
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,319
See that rooster up there?

295
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:00,745
Yeah.

296
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,746
- Now you don't.
- Jumping Jehoshaphat!

297
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:08,328
How would you like to make $5?

298
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:09,663
Doing what?

299
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:11,068
There's a swollen
headed stiff here

300
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,628
from the wild west show.

301
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,835
Oh, I don't shoot people!

302
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,157
No, no, he challenges anybody in
the county to a shooting match.

303
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,512
Well, where is he? I can hit

304
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,260
anything he can hit
standing on my head!

305
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,057
- Watch this.
- No, no, no, I believe you.

306
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:24,431
I believe you. Now I'll go
make the arrangements.

307
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:25,762
Uh, you wait here.

308
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:27,393
- What's your name?
- Annie Oakley.

309
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,974
Annie Oakley.

310
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,936
Come on, grandma.
I got to get you shined up.

311
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,742
How'd you get
your nose so dirty?

312
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,743
What's that you got there?

313
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,119
What's it look like?

314
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,370
It beats me.

315
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:48,747
It's not a rifle, is it?

316
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:50,419
Ain't you got eyes?

317
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,426
Yeah.

318
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,380
You got eyes.

319
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:01,827
Well, you shouldn't
be fooling around

320
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,933
with an old piece
of junk like this.

321
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,760
You could get hurt.

322
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:08,847
Well, this thing's liable to
explode and blow your ears off.

323
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,397
You give this back to your pappy

324
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:13,272
and get yourself
a couple of knitting needles.

325
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,691
Hey, hey, mister.

326
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,866
Do you, do you reckon I could
keep it till this afternoon?

327
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,034
Well, it makes
no difference to me.

328
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,157
I just don't want you
to hurt yourself. That's all.

329
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:25,658
I just want to
keep it long enough

330
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,081
to win a shooting contest

331
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,749
off of a big
swollen headed stiff

332
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:31,293
out of the wild west show.

333
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:32,712
You mean Frank Butler?

334
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,960
They didn't say his name.

335
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,258
Just that he was
a swollen headed stiff, huh?

336
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,506
- Yeah.
- Well, he's champion.

337
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,383
- What's that?
- He's the best.

338
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,759
He was.

339
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,551
You're kinda set
on yourself, aren't you?

340
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,682
About that, I am, but...

341
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,764
Soon as I try
to shine up to folks

342
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,814
I'm gawky as a scrub oak.

343
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,191
- Ain't I?
- Oh.

344
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:58,771
I don't know.

345
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,231
Well, I've seen worse than you.

346
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,658
- Honest?
- Sure.

347
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,736
Well, uh, good luck
in the shooting match.

348
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,321
I'll see you there.

349
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,031
Hey, hey, mister.

350
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:13,169
- Don't you like girls?
- Well, sure.

351
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:18,215
- I'm a girl.
- That's fine.

352
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:21,385
Is there, uh, any special
kinda girl that you like?

353
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:23,133
Yeah.

354
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:26,557
I like the kind that you,
you see in picture magazines.

355
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:30,387

gather 'round, gather 'round.

435
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,478
Now, without further ado

436
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,151
it gives me great pleasure

437
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:31,103
and it's a great privilege
to introduce to you

438
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:32,813
colonel William F. Cody.

439
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:35,741
Loved by you all
and known to you all as...

440
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,989
Buffalo Bill!

441
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:44,121
My young friends,

442
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,623
it always gives me
great pleasure

443
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:50,002
to return to my
favorite state, Ohio.

444
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:52,549
I am here today
to referee a contest

445
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:54,297
of fancy shooting

446
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:57,175
between the best marksman
your county offers

447
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,882
and one of the greatest
sharp-shooters

448
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:02,810
the world has ever known...

449
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:04,387
Frank Butler.

450
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:16,945
Aided and abetted
by his charming assistant

451
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,027
Miss Dolly Tate.

452
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,828
Is, uh,
Mr. Butler's opponent here?

453
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:28,419
- Is the contestant ready?
- Yep.

454
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:32,340
Good, ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

455
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:35,463
for the thrill of a lifetime.

456
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,170
Two men of steel
pitted against each other

457
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:41,974
in a savage struggle
of skill and stamina.

458
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:45,143
Uh. What's his name?

459
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,765
- What's his name?
- Annie.

460
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,065
Annie?

461
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,271
What's so funny?

462
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,482
Say, you tryin' to make
a fool of us or something?

463
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,237
Frank Butler can't shoot
against a girl.

464
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,694
- You said anyone, didn't you?
- Yes, I know I did.

465
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:03,099
What's the matter?
You afraid of a little girl?

466
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:04,988
No, it isn't that, but just...

467
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:09,744
- What do we do, B.B.?
- Wh-why, nothing.

468
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,375
The little lady
accepted the challenge.

469
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,205
She is entitled to her chance.

470
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,006
Are you really Buffalo Bill?

471
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,839
- Why, yes, little lady.
- I'm Annie Oakley.

472
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,471
Well, Miss Oakley, I am honored.

473
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,762
You are?

474
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:30,769
Frank, your opponent is ready.

475
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,524
Howdy.

476
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,277
I told you, I'd see you here.

477
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:40,699
You didn't tell me

478
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,152
you was the big
swollen-headed stiff.

479
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,547
Ain't we got
a tablecloth somewhere?

480
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,140
- Are you ready, Mr. Butler?
- Ready.

481
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:06,592
Are you ready, my dear?

482
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:07,914
Yeah, but what are we
shootin' at?

483
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:10,224
- Birds.
- Birds?

484
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,056
Where are they?
I don't see any birds.

485
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,233
Well, these are
Clay birds, my dear.

486
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,935
They come
out of a trap, in front.

487
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,318
The contest will continue
until the first miss.

488
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,195
When you are ready, my dear,
just say "pull."

489
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,526
Pull?

490
00:24:30,794 --> 00:24:31,909
Hit!

491
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:35,746
Pull.

492
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,673
Hey, it's wonderful!
They got a gadget out there.

493
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:44,721
All you have to do
is holler, "pull."

494
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,637
Hit!

495
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,976
I don't want any advantage.
Here, honey, try this one.

496
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:00,988

497
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,407

508
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:14,428

Where's my money?

523

Nice work.

524
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,210
Thanks. Wasn't nothin'.

525
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,632
It was easy as pie.

526
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,135
- I am sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

527
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,759
You're just good, that's all.

528
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,385
You ain't mad at me, are you?

529
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:33,761
Why, of course not.

530
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,058
Anybody can miss a shot.

531
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:36,180
I can't.

532
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,768
- Oh, Frank.
- Excuse me.

533
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,100
Here's your five dollars, Annie.
I'm proud of you.

534
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,356

535
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:48,063
Well, I don't know.
Back to Darke county, I guess.

536
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:52,405
He sure is pretty.

537
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,986
Well, goodbye, Annie.

538
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:55,183
- Goodbye, Mr. Wilson.
- Good luck.

539
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,492
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, kids.

540
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,061
You kids get on
and get them supplies now.

541
00:27:58,085 --> 00:28:00,076
- Hurry on. Hurry on.
- Okay, Annie.

542
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,786
I-I tell you, my boy,
she'd be a sensation.

543
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,859
They've never seen a girl
who could shoot like that.

544
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,339
What makes you think
she's so great?

545
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:08,007
Just because she got
one up on me?

546
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:09,489
She couldn't do it again
in a million years.

547
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,219
We haven't got a million years.

548
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:13,547
Business keeps up like this,
we're gonna have to fold up.

549
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,257
Pawnee Bill is
beating us every town.

550
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,593
- Yes, she'd be a novelty.
- I don't want any partners.

551
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:19,415
Well, we'll make her
your assistant.

552
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,084
Maybe once in a while,
you'll let her take a potshot.

553
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:22,769
Now look here,
you-you could break her in.

554
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,603
And you know, she-she's
quite a pretty... girl.

555
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:28,312
She's alright.

556
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,738
'Course, she looks
terrible now...

557
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:32,032
- But we can dress her up.
- Oh, yes.

558
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,555
She couldn't
look worse than Dolly.

559
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,889
She wouldn't be
willing to join us

560
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,120
just to hand me things.

561
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:39,914
- Oh, yes, I would, Mr. Butler.
- Well, looky here.

562
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:44,662
Just so as I could be near you.

563
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,420
You ever been
away from home before?

564
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,175
Oh, do I gotta leave home?

565
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,827
Oh, I think you'd find that
quite fascinating, my dear.

566
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:57,512
We travel all over the country.

567
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,764
Why, certainly. Have you ever
been on a railroad train?

568
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:02,834
You know anything
about show business?

569
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,315
Show business? What's that?

570
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:07,438

Who gave you Indians
permission to use this car?

610
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,410
Annie Oakley.

611
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:37,837
I might have known it.

612
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:42,088
Mrs. little horse, this is
our car and this is my section.

613
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,716
And I'll thank you
not to do your laundry in it.

614
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:46,546
Look at this place.
It's a disgra...

615
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,058
Sharp.

616
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,353
This is what I mean,
Mr. Davenport.

617
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,305
Look at this car. The woodwork.

618
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,937
Hey, you Indians,
stop that cutting that thing up.

619
00:33:58,028 --> 00:34:00,861
Look what they've done
to our curtains here.

620
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:02,633
Looks like the battle
of bull run, don't it?

621
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:04,739
They've done
a $100 worth of damage.

622
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,282
Alright, who told you Indians

623
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:07,555
you could pitch
a village in here?

624
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,035
I did.

625
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:10,558
They're only sitting
till the smoke clears.

626
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,368
- What smoke?
- Back in their coach.

627
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:14,996
They was cooking a little supper
and they had a small fire.

628
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,873
Oh, a small fire. A small fire!

629
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,750
Alright, you Indians,
break up camp

630
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:22,378
and get back to your car now.
Hurry up. Go on.

631
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,754
Come on, now.

632
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:24,845
Get.

633
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,759
- Annie, what gets into you?
- I'm sorry, Charlie.

634
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,090
I don't mean anything.

635
00:34:30,185 --> 00:34:32,346
And I wanna apologize
for little Jake

636
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,849
and the girls
unhitching the caboose.

637
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,852
If they only hadn't
done it on a hill.

638
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,309
Oh, I... cut this
out of the paper.

639
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:42,359
- It's about you.
- 'bout me?

640
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,062
Gee, thanks.

641
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:46,523
First call for supper.

642
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,483
First call for supper.

643
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:02,585
Phew! That was a close call.
Are you alright?

644
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:03,756
Yup.

645
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:06,751
Hey, you, come back here.

646
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:08,574
While they're eating, we're
gonna have our reading lesson.

647
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:10,509
- Now?
- Yes, now.

648
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,931
Have you got your book?

649
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,349
Let's see now.

650
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,442
What's that word?

651
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:26,654
Are you sure that's a word?

652
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:30,404
How can I learn you
if you don't do no homework?

653
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,735
Oh, Jake, you've gotta learn me

654
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,324
and you've gotta learn me fast.

655
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:36,282
What would Frank think
if he knew I couldn't read?

656
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:40,293
I know what it is. It's "the."

657
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,711
Keep it goin'.

658
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:50,384
"The boy had a dog.”

659
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:51,588
Go on.

660
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:57,932
"The dog's name were

661
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,729
was..."

662
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:01,397
What's that, Jake?

663
00:36:01,484 --> 00:36:02,815
Sound it out.

664
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:11,029
Furr-ae-ng-kh.

665
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,030
Now that I did it, what is it?

666
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,412
Frank.

667
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:18,410
That's a pretty name.

668
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,837
"The boy's name was...

669
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:30,168
"S-t-e...

670
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:34,677
P-h-e-n."

671
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:36,383
What's that, Jake?

672
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:42,768
Joe.

673
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:45,350
That seems
an awful lot for just Joe.

674
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:48,278
Well, readin's
kind of funny sometimes.

675
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:49,480
Come on.

676
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:56,028
"The dog was...

677
00:36:56,122 --> 00:37:00,991
Ss-Kerr-ae-ch-ch..."

678
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:06,984
Bless you.
Not catching cold, are you?

679
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,373
Heh, no, I'm just trying to

680
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:10,299
learn little Jake here
his reading lesson.

681
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:13,094
I sure am thick-headed,
ain't I, Annie?

682
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:15,451
You get along into the eating
car now and have your supper.

683
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:18,091
Annie reads good.
Show him, Annie. Start here.

684
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:20,598
You get along now. Get. Get.

685
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:27,776
Oh, Charlie gave me
this newspaper clipping.

686
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:30,569
- Would you like to read it?
- No, you read it to me.

687
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:32,693
Um, you read it, I-I wanna hear

688
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,775
how it sounds when you speak it.

689
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,944
Uh, "Mr. Butler's assistant

690
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,620
whose name is not on the program

691
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,074
performed only one trick,
but she promises to become

692
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:45,080
a fine marksman." Nice.

693
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:46,877
That's pretty nice
of that paper man.

694
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,251
Oh, people are beginning
to notice you, Annie.

695
00:37:49,342 --> 00:37:51,112
I told Charlie to put
your name on the Billboard.

696
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,467
- You did?
- Yep.

697
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,434
I got a real fancy trick
I've been practicing up

698
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:55,754
to surprise you with.

699
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,716
- What is it?
- Oh, I can't tell you.

700
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,095
It's a surprise.

701
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:03,391
That's fine.

702
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,972
I like you to be ambitious.
I want you to improve.

703
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,773
But it'll take some time.

704
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:10,318
All I want to be is
a pink and white lady

705
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:12,487
like the kind
you said you liked.

706
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:14,940
You're getting pinker
and whiter every day.

707
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:16,774
That ain't pig-wash, is it?

708
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,201
What would you say if someday

709
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:20,574
I might even be willing
to make you my partner?

710
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,747
Oh, Frank!

711
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,450
Butler and Oakley.

712
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:27,536
Never thought I'd ask a girl
to be my partner.

713
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,837
Oakley and Butler.

714
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:33,003
Butler and Oakley.

715
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:34,755
Well, what's the difference?

716
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,758
Well, you... you gotta do it
in alphabetical order.

717
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,511
You know, there's, uh,

718
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,810
gonna be
a wishing moon out tonight.

719
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,681
Back home, I used to wish
for a lot of things

720
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:51,735
but, lately, they sure have been
catching up to me.

721
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,028
Annie, uh...

722
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:55,821
You ever love anybody?

723
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,991
You mean,
somebody who loved me back?

724
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:00,614
- Yeah.
- Then, I ain't.

725
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,320

Well, I, uh,

774
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:10,318
better mosey on back to my car.

775
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:12,244
Do you mind if I walk you home?

776
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:13,491
You better go on to bed.

777
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,289
Goodnight.

778
00:43:15,376 --> 00:43:16,707
Goodnight.

779
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:22,004
Hurry! Hurry,
ladies and gentlemen!

780
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:23,456
Step this way and see the...

781
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,462
Charlie, Charlie, my boy.

782
00:43:25,553 --> 00:43:27,009
Something is wrong.

783
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:30,213
Here we've been parading
around all morning and...

784
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,468
How do you do, my dear?

785
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:33,174
And still the customers
don't come.

786
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:34,884
Maybe you need
some new attractions.

787
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,437
No, no, no. What we need
is just one good attraction.

788
00:43:38,524 --> 00:43:41,482
Something that will make
'em sit up and take...

789
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:43,685
Take notice.

790
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,065
Pawnee Bill!

791
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,441
The two-timing double crosser...

792
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:47,988
That's where
all your business is.

793
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:49,907
Opening in St. Paul
is like opening next door.

794
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,972
He's been doing this to us
all the way across the country.

795
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,796
But this time he ain't
gonna get away with it!

796
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:54,975
Yeah, well,
who's gonna stop him?

797
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,160
I am! I've got an idea.

798
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,116
Come on! Let's see Annie.

799
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:00,952
Move on. Uh, Annie...

800
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:02,983
Annie, you remember that stunt
you've been practicing?

801
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,338
- Uh-huh.
- Well, now...

802
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,961
Charlie and I thought that, uh,

803
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:09,135
this afternoon,
you-you might, uh...

804
00:44:09,222 --> 00:44:12,760
Well, well, th-that's
a very good stunt, huh?

805
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,340
What he means is, we wants you

806
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:16,266
to do it in the show
this afternoon.

807
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,935
Oh, I couldn't do that!

808
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,478
Frank might not like it!

809
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:22,307
Oh, of course, he would.
It'll surprise him, uh...

810
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:23,516
You like him, don't you?

811
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:24,817
Oh, I like him a heap.

812
00:44:24,904 --> 00:44:26,735
Uh, has he asked you
to marry him?

813
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:29,735
Not yet. He ain't broke out
in a cold sweat enough for that.

814
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:31,466
Well, that's why we're
doing this for you.

815
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:33,948
This is your big chance!
You'll dazzle him!

816
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,224
Why, when you walk
out there in front

817
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:36,433
of that audience this afternoon

818
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:37,697
in that beautiful new costume

819
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:39,032
with the music under you

820
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:40,367
and you try that new trick

821
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:42,167
that you've been saving
for him...

822
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:44,399
He'll be so proud of me, he'll
bust out in that cold sweat.

823
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:45,754
That's it.

824
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:47,069
Charlie, Buffalo,
wait till I tell him.

825
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:48,333
Oh, no, wait. Now, Annie, look.

826
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:50,251
We-we, we wanna
surprise him, you see.

827
00:44:50,346 --> 00:44:52,699
He's going to expect you to do
that old trick where you shoot

828
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,259
the egg off the poodle's head.

829
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:58,389
Instead, instead, you come on

830
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:01,767
you do the new trick,
you save the show

831
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:03,769
and you marry Frank!

832
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,691
Just like in a fairy tale!

833
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:07,393
Oh, you're sure he'll like it?

834
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:10,821
Well, y... yes, I... I think
he will... I think he will.

835
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,025
Uh, Mr. Frank Butler
is in for a real surprise.

836
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:23,201
Look at that business.

837
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:24,581
This will fix that Pawnee Bill.

838
00:45:24,672 --> 00:45:26,037
When word gets around
about Annie

839
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:27,338
he won't have enough customers

840
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,961
to get up a two-handed
poker game.

841
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:30,712
You're right, BB.

842
00:45:30,803 --> 00:45:34,170
That dirty two-timing
double-crossing

843
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,347
treacherous,
thieving, stealing...

844
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:37,674
Well, Buffalo Bill!

845
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:41,386
Well, Pawnee Bill, my old pal.

846
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,311
You are a sight for sore eyes.

847
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:44,835
Well, we were just
talking about you.

848
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,724
Weren't we, Charlie?
Just this minute.

849
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:48,589
We were just saying,
we don't see enough of you.

850
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:50,524
Well, I get a little bit
lonely, too, BB.

851
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,151
Any time during
the past six months

852
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:53,677
you wanted to see us,
all you had to do

853
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:54,781
was turn around and spit.

854
00:45:57,163 --> 00:45:58,778
Same old Charlie,
hasn't changed a bit.

855
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:02,865
Oh, you haven't met big chief
sitting bull, have you?

856
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,996
Well, well, no. I haven't.

857
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,332
Why, sure, everybody knows

858
00:46:10,426 --> 00:46:13,384
big chief sitting Bill
who defeated general Custer

859
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,257
at the battle
of the little bighorn!

860
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:16,758
And the man who tonight

861
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:18,885
will be the guest of honor
in St. Paul

862
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,217
of none other than Pawnee Bill!

863
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,597
Alright, folks.

864
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:25,100
Now don't lose
your place in line.

865
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:27,182
The great Annie Oakley
is on the inside...

866
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:28,356
Oh, Annie Oakley?

867
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:29,900
See, I'm anxious to see her.

868
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,773
- I'll get some tickets.
- Oh, hold on here.

869
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:33,400
I wouldn't have it in here.

870
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,777
Couple of passes
to my own private box.

871
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:39,156
Well, well, punched
right through the center.

872
00:46:39,247 --> 00:46:40,783
Annie Oakley shot them out.

873
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:41,913
- Annie Oakley?
- Oh, yeah.

874
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,323
Well, we've got Annie Oakley's.

875
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:45,032
And I'll see you inside.

876
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:46,407
There you are, chief.
Come along.

877
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:51,873
I better follow him. He's likely
to steal the benches.

878
00:46:56,931 --> 00:46:59,217
Uh, how's business, chief?
Going back on the warpath soon?

879
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:01,640
No, on way home from Washington.

880
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:03,183
Oh, okay.

881
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:06,763
Go see great white father
about Indian territory.

882
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,577
Say, they gave you
bad shuffle on that land.

883
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:10,770
Well, maybe you can farm it.

884
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,977
Nothing will grow.

885
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:15,438
Too much oil.

886
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,366
- Fifty thousand barrel a day.
- Fifty thousand...

887
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:21,618
Say now, that's too bad, chief.

888
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,183
Uh, how are you gonna live?
You can't eat oil.

889
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,118
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

890
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,245
No put money in show business.

891
00:47:27,336 --> 00:47:29,122
- Oh, you can have a lot of fun.
- No!

892
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,857
Twenty thousand dollars, chief.
We could have a...

893
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,293
Sitting bull lives
by three rule.

894
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,922
Keep bow tight, keep arrow sharp

895
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:40,221
no put money in show business.

896
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,809
How did we ever get
the country away from them?

897
00:47:46,314 --> 00:47:47,770
Hi, Charlie!

898
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,097
The bidders look...

899
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:51,769
Well, who put that up there?

900
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:54,147
Yeah, it looks great, don't it?

901
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,757
I told you to put
her name up some place.

902
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,021
Not to make a star out of her.

903
00:47:57,116 --> 00:47:58,731
That's ridiculous!

904
00:47:58,826 --> 00:48:00,804
She's only doing a couple
of little tricks, isn't she?

905
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:02,534
- Well, yeah, Frank.
- Isn't she?

906
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:03,906
Well, sure!

907
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,289
I don't understand you.

908
00:48:07,376 --> 00:48:09,207
- You like her, don't you?
- Sure, I like her.

909
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:10,705
And I want to keep liking her.

910
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:12,661
- Where's Buffalo Bill?
- Inside.

911
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,221
Jumping buffalo!

912
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:30,729
It's... it's me!

913
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,934
Have I been up there
all the time?

914
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:36,314
Do you like it?

915
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:39,484
Like it?

916
00:48:39,575 --> 00:48:42,112
Oh, Charlie,
I can't believe this.

917
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:46,028
- Wait till Frank sees it.
- Yeah.

918
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:48,284

Charlie, please?

I've been around
here about four years

942
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:11,852
and you finally managed
to give me a spot...

943
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,037
Well, that's what
we always had. We..

944
00:50:14,128 --> 00:50:15,243
How about this?

945
00:50:15,337 --> 00:50:16,747
Oh, Frank, look up there.

946
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:18,454
Ain't I grown
in the last few days?

947
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,085
Yeah, shot up like a ragweed.

948
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:21,507
You know, I still can't believe.

949
00:50:21,594 --> 00:50:23,004
Well, don't try too hard, honey

950
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:25,177
because it ain't gonna
be there next week.

951
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:27,471
- Why?
- Well, that's show business.

952
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:28,785
I give you a few
extra tricks to do

953
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:29,953
but they don't rate
a star billing.

954
00:50:29,977 --> 00:50:31,717
Even I don't get that.

955
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:33,732
Some day maybe, honey.
But it's gotta be gradual.

956
00:50:33,814 --> 00:50:35,214
Well, if that's the way
you want it.

957
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:36,889
That's the way I want it.

958
00:50:39,695 --> 00:50:41,731
You ain't sore, are ya?

959
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,737
Oh, I'm not sore, honey.

960
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,660
You be sure and watch me
this afternoon.

961
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,113
Now don't be nervous.

962
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,977
I seen you do that poodle trick
a dozen times.

963
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:56,287
Oh, I know. But today
I'm not gonna...

964
00:50:56,378 --> 00:50:58,994
I mean, I'm gonna...

965
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:03,549
Well, when you see me out there
with the music and everything...

966
00:51:03,636 --> 00:51:05,376
Well, you'll... you'll...

967
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:07,052
What'll I do?

968
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,755
Well, you'll start to
bust out in a cold sweat

969
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,557
and, and then
just like in a fairy tale

970
00:51:12,645 --> 00:51:13,851
you're gonna be so proud of me

971
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:15,724
that you're gonna ask me
to do something

972
00:51:15,814 --> 00:51:19,773
and be somebody and I'm gonna
do it and be it.

973
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,816
Honey, I could ask you
that right now.

974
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,690
You sure look elegant.

975
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,112
Not now, Frank.

976
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,110
That ain't the way I planned it.

977
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,862
Besides, you can't
kneel down here.

978
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,096
Then I'll come back
to your dressing tent

979
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,360
after I come off.

980
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,241
Yeah, and then you can
take your time

981
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:36,290
and ask me real slow, like.

982
00:51:36,377 --> 00:51:39,119
Well, I better get in.

983
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:41,169
Would you like
to touch me for luck?

984
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:50,963

For the surprise feature

1039
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:15,519
of the Buffalo Bill
Wild West Show.

1040
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:18,276
For the first time in any arena

1041
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:20,198
we will witness this afternoon

1042
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:22,367
a feat of marksmanship

1043
00:56:22,454 --> 00:56:24,069
daring and bravery

1044
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,325
never before attempted

1045
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,997
in all the world!

1046
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:35,376
Ladies and gentlemen,
we proudly present,

1047
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:37,924
Miss Annie Oakley!

1048
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:46,743
Look.

1049
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:55,064
Look here, Frank, I don't
want you to blame Annie.

1050
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:57,191
She wouldn't, she, she was
only trying to surprise you.

1051
00:57:57,215 --> 00:57:59,752
- She wouldn't cross anybody.
- Yeah! That's what I thought.

1052
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,505
I thought she was such
a sweet, simple little girl.

1053
00:58:02,596 --> 00:58:05,963
Simple? Why, in two weeks
I'd wind up being her assistant.

1054
00:58:06,058 --> 00:58:07,798
Look who's talking?

1055
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:10,680
I've watched you push her
around for months now.

1056
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:12,762
Handing you your guns.

1057
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,222
Grateful for any crumb
the great Frank Butler

1058
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:17,023
would deign to drop!

1059
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,339
Why you're so conceited, if you
fell in love with anybody else

1060
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:21,228
it'd be a triangle.

1061
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:23,359
Oh, now.

1062
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,031
Maybe you'd like to hit me, too.

1063
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:27,905
Charlie here was talking
for both of us.

1064
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:33,991
Oh, Frank, I've been
looking all over for you.

1065
00:58:34,086 --> 00:58:35,792
Did you see me?
Were you surprised?

1066
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,106
It was the surprise of my life.

1067
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:38,836
Oh, I knew you'd like it.

1068
00:58:38,924 --> 00:58:41,791
Now if you two will get,
we wanna be alone.

1069
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,092
Watanya Cecilia!

1070
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:45,760
Watanya Cecilia.

1071
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:47,428
- Get away!
- Watanya Cecilia.

1072
00:58:47,516 --> 00:58:49,410
You've been chasing me
all the way from the big tent!

1073
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:50,995
- Watanya Cecilia.
- Make him stop saying that!

1074
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:52,246
Don't worry, now, it's alright.

1075
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,665
- What does it mean?
- It's alright.

1076
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:55,771
It's alright, honey.
That's a compliment.

1077
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:57,813
In the Sioux language,
"Watanya Cecilia” means

1078
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:58,981
Little Sure Shot.

1079
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,934
Of course, he wants to meet you.

1080
00:59:01,029 --> 00:59:03,771
Miss Annie Oakley, may I
present Chief Sitting Bull.

1081
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:07,357
I'm, uh, glad
to meet you, Mr. Bull.

1082
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:11,160
Thank you kindly.

1083
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:13,534
I want you to meet
my best friend.

1084
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:17,413
- Mr. Frank Butler.
- You in show too?

1085
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:20,416
In a show? Oh, he's a star!

1086
00:59:20,507 --> 00:59:23,670
- Star?
- That means he's the best!

1087
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:31,761
Not. You best. Good girl.

1088
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:33,913
Oh, that's alright, honey.
He wants you to be his friend.

1089
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,849
Not friend.
I make her my daughter.

1090
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,805
- What?
- Oh, that's a great honor.

1091
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,231
He wants to adopt you.

1092
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:42,309
I've called
Sioux tribe together.

1093
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:45,066
- We have big ceremony.
- When, chief?

1094
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:46,613
- Now.
- Oh, not now.

1095
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,941
I have to contact
the newspapers, send some wires.

1096
00:59:49,036 --> 00:59:51,322
- That'll take a little time.
- Now!

1097
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:53,074
Well, that's what I said, now.

1098
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:55,156
To be near daughter...

1099
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,784
Sitting Bull break rule.

1100
00:59:58,879 --> 01:00:00,915
Put money in show business.

1101
01:00:01,006 --> 01:00:03,122
- You all hear that?
- Now we can go to New York.

1102
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:05,153
- Madison Square Garden.
- Yeah, we'll tour Europe.

1103
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:06,292
We'll tour the whole world.

1104
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:07,967
Everything's happening so fast.

1105
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:09,511
First, I get me a new papa
and...

1106
01:00:09,598 --> 01:00:11,839
Now if you two will get,
I could get me a husband.

1107
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:14,140
Couldn't I, Frank?

1108
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:17,515
Frank? Frank.
Oh, where did he go?

1109
01:00:17,606 --> 01:00:19,437
Well, he probably
went out to change.

1110
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,107
Hey, now. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1111
01:00:23,195 --> 01:00:25,811
Buffalo! Charlie! Help!

1112
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:07,561
Come.

1113
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:21,620
Say after me.

1114
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,282
Teeth of many bear.

1115
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,463
Am I an Indian yet?

1116
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:14,795
Not yet.

1117
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,879
Am I an Indian yet?

1118
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:37,256
Not yet.

1119
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:01,409
Am I an Indian yet?

1120
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:04,199
Come.

1121
01:04:08,253 --> 01:04:10,039
Watanya Cecilia.

1122
01:04:11,256 --> 01:04:12,462

1150
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:52,186
we take in a new member?

1151
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:58,728
Annie, Annie.

1152
01:05:58,822 --> 01:06:00,278
Here's a letter for you, Annie.

1153
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,404
For me?

1154
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:04,983
Thanks.

1155
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:08,744
I ain't never had
a letter before.

1156
01:06:13,586 --> 01:06:18,501
Frr... Frank!

1157
01:06:18,591 --> 01:06:21,048
Frank. Your best friend.

1158
01:06:21,136 --> 01:06:24,344
Papa bull, can you read writing?

1159
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:27,093
Papa bull writing book.

1160
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,764
Well, can you make this out?

1161
01:06:31,563 --> 01:06:34,054
"Dear, Annie. I'm leav..."

1162
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,310
What's the matter?

1163
01:06:39,112 --> 01:06:40,648
"I'm leaving tonight

1164
01:06:40,738 --> 01:06:43,195
to join Pawnee Bill's show.

1165
01:06:43,283 --> 01:06:44,819
I am going to do

1166
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:48,652
my old act with Dolly."

1167
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:50,737
But why?

1168
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:54,745
"You put over
greatest trick I ever saw.

1169
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:57,498
You are a smart girl, Annie.

1170
01:06:57,589 --> 01:07:00,831
Too smart for me.

1171
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:02,210
Good luck to you.

1172
01:07:02,302 --> 01:07:05,169
And goodbye. Frank.”

1173
01:07:05,263 --> 01:07:07,629
Oh, what... what does he mean?

1174
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:10,010
Too smart for...

1175
01:07:10,101 --> 01:07:13,434
It... it must be
some sort of joke.

1176
01:07:13,521 --> 01:07:16,809
It was gonna, it was gonna
be Butler and Oakley.

1177
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,811
I was gonna...

1178
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:21,268
Are you sure you can read?

1179
01:07:21,362 --> 01:07:23,694
You want him killed?

1180
01:07:23,781 --> 01:07:27,114
Papa bull, we was gonna
be married tonight.

1181
01:07:27,202 --> 01:07:29,318
Me and Frank.

1182
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:32,779
I was gonna be a lady
for him and everything.

1183
01:07:32,874 --> 01:07:35,160
I was trying so hard.

1184
01:07:37,337 --> 01:07:39,293
You great lady, Annie.

1185
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,463
You best shot in whole world.

1186
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,165
Oh, papa bull.

1187
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,467
I wish I had never seen a gun.

1188
01:08:14,832 --> 01:08:16,572
And you kids
be good and do everything

1189
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:19,205
that Miss Willoughby
tells you to do.

1190
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,456
Where's little Jake?

1191
01:08:21,548 --> 01:08:22,663
Jake!

1192
01:08:23,883 --> 01:08:24,883
Jake!

1193
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:28,421
Jake!

1194
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,387
Jake.

1195
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:47,524
Oh, little Jake.

1196
01:08:47,615 --> 01:08:51,073
Annie, it's awful important
that I go with you.

1197
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,616
Honest, it is.

1198
01:08:52,704 --> 01:08:54,865
Oh, I wish you
could, little Jake.

1199
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:57,038
But you gotta take Jessie
and Minnie and Nellie

1200
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,581
back to Ohio.

1201
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:01,205
But who's gonna
teach you to read?

1202
01:09:01,296 --> 01:09:03,332
I guess I'll have
to learn myself.

1203
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:08,174
Come on. Goodbye, kids.

1204
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:09,446
Take good care
of them, Miss Willoughby...

1205
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,835
I will, ma'am.

1206
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:13,387
- Goodbye, Annie.
- Hurry up back, Annie!

1207
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:16,136
- I will. I will. Bye.
- Don't worry, Ms. Oakley.

1208
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,935
Take good care
of your shooting arm, Annie.

1209
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:25,392
I will, Jake. Bye.

1210
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:31,468
There it is, Annie,
time to get aboard.

1211
01:09:31,492 --> 01:09:32,803
- Oh, buffalo. Not yet.
- What's the matter?

1212
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:34,283
- Something wrong?
- Maybe.

1213
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,701
- Maybe what?
- Well...

1214
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:37,403
Wouldn't you think
people would come down

1215
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:40,410
and say goodbye to people
when people are going to Europe?

1216
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,992
Oh, no, Annie, maybe... maybe
he couldn't make it.

1217
01:09:43,087 --> 01:09:44,748
You mean...

1218
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:46,249
Maybe he didn't want to.

1219
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:49,590
I don't care.

1220
01:09:49,677 --> 01:09:51,292
He don't mean nothing to me.

1221
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,673
Come on, I'm gonna be
the biggest hit

1222
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:55,096
in the whole world,
I'm gonna win

1223
01:09:55,183 --> 01:09:57,390
every shooting medal
ever invented.

1224
01:09:57,477 --> 01:10:00,184
Then Mr. Frank Butler wouldn't
be so proud and mighty!

1225
01:10:00,271 --> 01:10:02,057
- I'll show him!
- Yes, now, come on.

1226
01:12:48,606 --> 01:12:52,190
Miss Oakley, you're a very
remarkable young lady.

1227
01:13:03,037 --> 01:13:05,403
My daughter Annie,
many fine medals.

1228
01:13:05,498 --> 01:13:07,298
Hey, hello, Charlie.
Great success, wasn't it?

1229
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,769
Oh, great,
another success like that

1230
01:13:08,793 --> 01:13:09,953
and we'll go broke.

1231
01:13:10,044 --> 01:13:11,159
What are you talking about?

1232
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:12,414
These command performances

1233
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:13,870
are costing us our shirts.

1234
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:15,546
They command, we perform...

1235
01:13:15,633 --> 01:13:17,749
- No one pays!
- Yeah, well, now look here.

1236
01:13:17,844 --> 01:13:20,051
We got enough money to meet
our payroll this week?

1237
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:22,549
Meet it? We're not close
enough to even wave at it.

1238
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,755
Oh, no.

1239
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,511
Maybe we'll break
even in Sweden.

1240
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,842
They only have one king
and he's on a vacation.

1241
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:29,498
Now, look here, Charlie,
what would you think about

1242
01:13:29,522 --> 01:13:31,854
pullin' up stakes here
and headin' home?

1243
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,977
Heading home? We got
a whole tour ahead of us.

1244
01:13:34,068 --> 01:13:35,629
Now is our chance
to make a little money.

1245
01:13:35,653 --> 01:13:37,314
This is all just
been a build up.

1246
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:39,646
Yeah. Well, I wasn't
thinking about the money.

1247
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,401
Uh, I didn't hear you.

1248
01:13:41,492 --> 01:13:44,450
Have you, uh, have been
watching Annie lately?

1249
01:13:44,537 --> 01:13:47,574
I watch her every show.

1250
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:49,030
She's a great
little sharpshooter.

1251
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,853
Yes. Well, I don't think
that's enough for Annie.

1252
01:13:50,877 --> 01:13:52,538
Well, we'll build up
her act a little.

1253
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:55,415
- Oh, now, Charlie. Talk sense.
- What do you expect me to say?

1254
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:59,249
That she'd be happier back
with the great Frank Butler?

1255
01:13:59,343 --> 01:14:01,925
I'd rather see her
elope with sitting bull.

1256
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:03,991
At least she'd always be sure
of having a tent over her head.

1257
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:05,880
Now, you listen to me.
Frank is alright.

1258
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:09,217
Well, the important thing is
Annie's in love with him.

1259
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:11,098
Well, now that's
where you're wrong.

1260
01:14:11,188 --> 01:14:13,053
Annie is as happy
as a little lark.

1261
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:16,933
Here comes your happy
little lark, hmm.

1262
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:25,233
Annie? Annie?

1263
01:14:26,537 --> 01:14:28,903
The...

1264
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:30,784
Show went swell, didn't it?

1265
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:32,615
Oh, you were superb, my dear.

1266
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,871
You knocked 'em out
of their seats, honey.

1267
01:14:34,962 --> 01:14:36,953
Do you think I thanked
the queen enough?

1268
01:14:37,048 --> 01:14:38,379
You certainly did.

1269
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:41,048
Why, you gave a great show!

1270
01:14:41,135 --> 01:14:44,298
It's, uh, fun traveling around
Europe like this, isn't it?

1271
01:14:45,723 --> 01:14:47,213
Isn't it?

1272
01:14:47,308 --> 01:14:49,344
Oh, oh, sure.

1273
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:51,096
You get to travel all around,

1274
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:53,599
meet a lot of interesting
people, I love it.

1275
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,021
Well, I'm all packed.

1276
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:57,314
Where are we headin' now?

1277
01:14:57,401 --> 01:14:58,937
- Well...
- North, south?

1278
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:00,393
We haven't decided.

1279
01:15:00,488 --> 01:15:03,230
Uh, we were
talking about Sweden.

1280
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:05,565
Oh. That's nice.

1281
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,697
And then of course we
could go back to America.

1282
01:15:08,788 --> 01:15:10,574
We could...

1283
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,953
Uh! Buffalo.
Do you really mean it?

1284
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:16,250
Would you like that, honey?

1285
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:18,919
Oh, I love Europe but

1286
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:20,871
I've been dying to go home.

1287
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:22,628
That's what we figured.

1288
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,959
I get to see the kids again.

1289
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:27,921
Oh, yes.
Now wouldn't that be nice?

1290
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:32,721
Of course, I can't wait
till a certain

1291
01:15:32,812 --> 01:15:35,019
Mr. somebody sees this.

1292
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:45,400
Oh, aren't they cute?

1293
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:47,402
Yeah, but if we're so rich

1294
01:15:47,493 --> 01:15:49,484
what are we doing
on a cattle boat?

1295
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,739
We thought it'd be nice to keep
the animals company.

1296
01:15:51,831 --> 01:15:55,665
Annie, our European tour
was an artistic success.

1297
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:56,751
He means we're broke.

1298
01:15:56,836 --> 01:15:58,326
Oh, you don't mean to tell me

1299
01:15:58,421 --> 01:15:59,773
the king of Italy
and the kaiser couldn't

1300
01:15:59,797 --> 01:16:01,128
dig up a buck and a half?

1301
01:16:01,215 --> 01:16:03,331
My dear child,
king's don't handle money.

1302
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:05,041
Same as us.

1303
01:16:05,136 --> 01:16:06,467
I'll give it to you briefly.

1304
01:16:06,554 --> 01:16:08,115
We had a choice of
traveling on this boat

1305
01:16:08,139 --> 01:16:10,346
or getting our
feet very wet. Shut up!

1306
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:13,425
It cost a lot of money to travel
a big troupe up and down Europe.

1307
01:16:13,519 --> 01:16:15,319
Why, sure, you remember
what happened in Paris

1308
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:18,061
when the Indians
discovered French pastry.

1309
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:20,811
Sixty-two thousand
chocolate eclairs!

1310
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:24,018
Sixty-two thousand five hundred.

1311
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,195
Now, now, you see that?
That cost a heap of money.

1312
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:28,898
But, papa bull,
what happened to your heap?

1313
01:16:28,993 --> 01:16:32,611
Government put papa bull
on small allowance.

1314
01:16:32,705 --> 01:16:35,742
- 32.50 a week.
- But why?

1315
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,519
Because in the eight months
that he's been with us

1316
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:39,704
he's drawn $300,000.

1317
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,356
And he hasn't got
anything to show for it

1318
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,747
except an opera hat
and a shoe box full of our IOUs.

1319
01:16:44,842 --> 01:16:46,924
That's show business.

1320
01:16:47,011 --> 01:16:48,717
I'll give it to
you straight, Annie.

1321
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,199
I don't think we can keep the
show up. It cost too much money!

1322
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:53,509
But you can't break up the show.

1323
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:56,934
I go back to reservation.

1324
01:16:57,021 --> 01:17:01,936
Reservation very quiet
after show business.

1325
01:17:02,026 --> 01:17:03,687
What's gonna happen
to you, Buffalo Bill?

1326
01:17:03,778 --> 01:17:06,690
Who me? Oh, I'll be alright.
Dime museums, side shows.

1327
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:08,487
Everything is gonna
be alright, honey.

1328
01:17:08,574 --> 01:17:11,987
Only just now we gotta
raise a little bit of cash.

1329
01:17:12,078 --> 01:17:14,319
Hey! Let's turn
this into a pirate ship.

1330
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,369
- Oh.
- Sitting bull hungry.

1331
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:18,288
Yes, Buffalo Bill hungry too.

1332
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,991
I'd settle right now for...

1333
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:22,497
I'd settle right...

1334
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:28,420
Annie, do you think
you can shoot one of those?

1335
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:30,422
Which one do you want
and where you want him?

1336
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:32,128
Uh, get the one
with the meat on him.

1337
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,512
Now you see?

1338
01:17:37,603 --> 01:17:39,434
Everything finally
turns out alright.

1339
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:40,762
Take this down to the chef.

1340
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,938
- What for?
- A seagull sandwich.

1341
01:17:44,902 --> 01:17:47,609
Well, I guess I'll mosey
on back to my stall.

1342
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,732
Time to milk my roommate.

1343
01:17:56,914 --> 01:17:58,745
Annie, Annie. Come here to me.

1344
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,949
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

1345
01:18:04,296 --> 01:18:05,957
There she is.

1346
01:18:10,094 --> 01:18:15,134
Board! Heaving to
the boarding instructions.

1347
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:17,180
Come aboard by port bow.

1348
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:25,022
Hey, Bill, Annie.
We got a visitor.

1349
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:26,315
Who is it?

1350
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:29,394
It looks like, uh, Frank Butler.

1351
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:31,149
Well, well, so it does.

1352
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,801
Well come on, Annie.
Take a look.

1353
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:34,190
I don't wanna look.

1354
01:18:34,285 --> 01:18:36,617
And if he's comin' on
this boat, I'm leaving.

1355
01:18:36,704 --> 01:18:39,070
- No, no, no, Annie.
- Stay. Talk.

1356
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:41,781
Maybe I will.

1357
01:18:43,377 --> 01:18:45,789
Sure. I'll talk to him.

1358
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,996
I'll say, "what are
you doing here

1359
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:52,003
"you big swollen-headed
stiff? Get!"

1360
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:57,088
Then he'll say, "I just come
down to meet ya, honey."

1361
01:18:57,183 --> 01:19:02,143
And I'll say, "I don't wanna get
met by you. Get away from me.

1362
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:04,470
Take your hands off me.
I hate ya!”

1363
01:19:06,859 --> 01:19:11,193
Then he'll say, "now, honey."

1364
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:15,364
And then I'll say,
"don't honey me!

1365
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:16,987
"You thought I
double-crossed ya.

1366
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:19,068
You thought I tried
to show you up.

1367
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:20,869
When you did find
out I only done the trick

1368
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,696
just so you'd love me.

1369
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,873
Why didn't you love me?
Why did you leave?

1370
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,076
Why didn't you write?"

1371
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:32,582
Then he'll say, "'cause I...

1372
01:19:34,178 --> 01:19:35,714
'Cause I was ashamed.

1373
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:41,140
Besides, not writin' don't mean

1374
01:19:41,227 --> 01:19:43,388
somebody don't love somebody."

1375
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:48,772
Then I'll say, "well, anyways...

1376
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,896
You could have writ."

1377
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:55,104
And then he'll say...

1378
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,440
"Annie, I've been
eating my heart out for you.

1379
01:19:57,534 --> 01:20:00,742
I can't work, I can't sleep.”

1380
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:04,742
Then, of course,
then if he says that...

1381
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,949
I guess I'll just have to say...

1382
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:10,873
"I ain't slept much too."

1383
01:20:12,383 --> 01:20:16,626
Then by rights, he ought to say,

1384
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,053
"Annie, we both
just gotta get some sleep!

1385
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:23,599
I loves you so!”

1386
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:29,688
Then I don't know hows
I'll stop myself from sayin'...

1387
01:20:33,153 --> 01:20:35,269
"I loves you too."

1388
01:20:38,242 --> 01:20:39,357
Frank!

1389
01:20:40,828 --> 01:20:42,068
Frank!

1390
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:46,447
- You ain't Frank!
- Well, nobody said I was.

1391
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,811
Then why'd you
come out here and pretend

1392
01:20:47,835 --> 01:20:49,325
and get me to kiss you and all?

1393
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,273
- He didn't do anything, baby.
- Oh, yes, he did.

1394
01:20:51,297 --> 01:20:53,162
He gave me an appetite
I didn't wanna get!

1395
01:20:53,257 --> 01:20:55,964
Oh, no, Annie. Who are you, son?

1396
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,737
Well, I'm workin' over
at Madison square garden.

1397
01:20:57,761 --> 01:20:59,239
- I'm in the Pawnee Bill show.
- Pawnee Bill...

1398
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:00,878
- How?
- How!

1399
01:21:00,973 --> 01:21:03,840
- No, no, how's business?
- Oh, we're packin' 'em in.

1400
01:21:03,934 --> 01:21:06,016
- They're mostly society ladies.
- Society ladies?

1401
01:21:06,103 --> 01:21:07,309
Sure, that Frank Butler

1402
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,261
he's, uh, catnip
for those debutantes.

1403
01:21:09,356 --> 01:21:11,472
Debutantes, what's that?

1404
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:13,808
Ladies with
long white gloves, dear.

1405
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:17,019
Them, uh, long white gloves
you're talkin' about,

1406
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:18,820
is there any
special pair he likes?

1407
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,273
We can't keep track of him.
Colonel, sir...

1408
01:21:21,368 --> 01:21:22,595
I have a letter here
from Pawnee Bill to you.

1409
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:23,859
Hmm. Thank you, son.

1410
01:21:23,954 --> 01:21:25,490
We were expecting
you in on the, uh,

1411
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:27,037
on the great eastern.

1412
01:21:27,124 --> 01:21:28,955
Well, of course,
I... I don't like

1413
01:21:29,043 --> 01:21:30,999
to be separated from my cattle.

1414
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,372
I... Charlie, show
the gentleman below.

1415
01:21:33,464 --> 01:21:36,206
Uh, could I interest you
in a tub of nice, fresh milk?

1416
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,791
- Let me read it.
- Well, certainly.

1417
01:21:38,886 --> 01:21:41,252
"Dear old pal.

1418
01:21:41,347 --> 01:21:45,260
Welcome home, you millionaires.

1419
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:52,100
We want to give you all
a big reception

1420
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:58,357
at the hotel brrr..."

1421
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:00,984
No, no, no. Honey, Brevoort.

1422
01:22:01,075 --> 01:22:04,192
I can read, lately.

1423
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:09,406
"The hotel bre-e-voort.

1424
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:14,415
Tomorrow night, the town's
dying to meet you.

1425
01:22:14,505 --> 01:22:18,965
Frank's bringing all
his society friends."

1426
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:21,292
Alright, turn over.

1427
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:24,595
"Please tell my messenger

1428
01:22:24,681 --> 01:22:26,763
that you will come.

1429
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:32,891
So we can start
to ice the champaginee.”

1430
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,391
Champagne.

1431
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:36,644
"Ice the champagne.

1432
01:22:36,735 --> 01:22:39,477
Your old pal, Pawnee Bill."

1433
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:42,028
Champagne at the Brevoort,
why that old tenderfoot

1434
01:22:42,116 --> 01:22:43,856
must be filthy rich!

1435
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:47,239
Good! Pawnee Bill,
possible sucker.

1436
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:51,698
- What are you talking about?
- Buffalo Bill, poor, but good.

1437
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:54,374
Pawnee Bill, bad, but rich.

1438
01:22:54,461 --> 01:22:57,419
Put together,
make good and rich.

1439
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:58,817
You know, he may
have something there.

1440
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:00,377
We... we could merge, you know.

1441
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:03,004
We've got the prestige
and he's got the money.

1442
01:23:03,095 --> 01:23:05,336
We could combine
our shows. We...

1443
01:23:05,431 --> 01:23:07,092
Annie, how would you like that?

1444
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:09,298
Oh, Buffalo Bill.

1445
01:23:09,393 --> 01:23:11,884
If the two shows could merge

1446
01:23:11,979 --> 01:23:14,265
me and Frank would just have
to work together every day

1447
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,892
and then, pretty soon

1448
01:23:15,983 --> 01:23:18,190
maybe him and me
could do some mergin'.

1449
01:23:18,277 --> 01:23:20,609
Yes. Well, I'd better go
find that messenger.

1450
01:23:23,115 --> 01:23:26,073
Now, you'll be
with your friend Frank.

1451
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:30,199
Oh, papa bull, he'll make you
a wonderful son-in-law.

1452
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,289
Maybe, maybe he's gone
and fallen in love

1453
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,458
with one of those
pink and white ladies

1454
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:38,126
he's always talkin' about.

1455
01:23:39,631 --> 01:23:42,623
When you fall
in love with Frank?

1456
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,550
First time I seen him.

1457
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:49,429
He took to me, right away.

1458
01:23:49,516 --> 01:23:51,507
He sung me a love song.

1459
01:23:51,602 --> 01:23:54,685
He just spit his heart
right out at me.

I'm giving a weekend party
at my estate.

1485
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,827
- Oh, that's fine, that's fine.
- I'll be expecting you.

1486
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,370
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I don't think

1487
01:25:57,394 --> 01:25:59,009
I could leave my horses.

1488
01:25:59,104 --> 01:26:02,346
- Horses?
- Uh, uh, excuse me.

1489
01:26:02,441 --> 01:26:04,523
- Frank, don't forget our dance.
- Oh, I won't.

1490
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:07,105
Oh, isn't this our dance?

1491
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,777
I'm sorry but, uh, I promised
this one to Pawnee Bill.

1492
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:11,776
- Excuse me.
- Will you excuse us, please?

1493
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,108
Oh, Frank, isn't it
a lovely party?

1494
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:16,193
Yeah.

1495
01:26:16,288 --> 01:26:18,950
- It is a nice party, isn't it?
- If you like witches.

1496
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:21,361
What's the idea sending that
faded Gibson girl to fetch me?

1497
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:23,021
And you picked the night
when I'm half out of my mind

1498
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:24,564
worrying if Annie
will even talk to me.

1499
01:26:24,588 --> 01:26:26,374
Well, I'll have to tell you.

1500
01:26:26,465 --> 01:26:28,151
We're at the end of our line,
we owe everybody.

1501
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:29,485
I don't understand it,
we're pulling in

1502
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:30,840
in a fortune,
down at the garden.

1503
01:26:30,927 --> 01:26:32,196
Yeah, with the sheriff
at the door of the

1504
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,551
box office pulling it out again.

1505
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:35,074
Well, if we're so broke,
what are you givin'

1506
01:26:35,098 --> 01:26:36,451
this big party
for Buffalo Bill for?

1507
01:26:36,475 --> 01:26:37,619
It's an investment, I'm trying

1508
01:26:37,643 --> 01:26:39,679
to promote a partnership.

1509
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,476
You mean, put the
two shows together?

1510
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:43,679
Yes.

1511
01:26:43,774 --> 01:26:46,732
Hey, that's wonderful.
Then she'd have to talk to me.

1512
01:26:46,818 --> 01:26:48,854
I knew I could count on you.

1513
01:26:48,945 --> 01:26:51,812
Colonel William F. Cody.

1514
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:53,522
- Oh!
- Where are you goin'?

1515
01:26:53,617 --> 01:26:54,948
I... I got a surprise for her.

1516
01:26:55,035 --> 01:26:56,571
I'll be right back.

1517
01:26:58,538 --> 01:27:01,746
Mr. Charles Davenport
and their company.

1518
01:27:06,546 --> 01:27:09,629
Well, well. My old pal, Bill!

1519
01:27:09,716 --> 01:27:12,753
Pawnee Bill, my old pal.
What a reunion!

1520
01:27:12,844 --> 01:27:15,130
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

1521
01:27:15,222 --> 01:27:17,053
You know, you look wonderful?

1522
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:18,755
- I look wonderful?
- Yes!

1523
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:20,995
I look terrible. You look
wonderful. Doesn't he, Charlie?

1524
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:22,680
He never looked this good to me.

1525
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:24,727
- Tell me, where's Annie?
- Oh, she's on her way.

1526
01:27:24,815 --> 01:27:27,522
I'm anxious to see her
and let's have a drink, eh?

1527
01:27:29,361 --> 01:27:32,023
- Well, Bill, here's to you.
- No, no, no, here's to you.

1528
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:34,480
- Oh, no. To you.
- No, no, I insist.

1529
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:36,405
- Here's to you.
- Let's drink to me! Hm?

1530
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:42,324
No. Later.

1531
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:45,283
I read about your European tour.

1532
01:27:45,377 --> 01:27:46,562
Biggest show
they ever seen over there.

1533
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:49,373
- Oh, we, uh, we got by.
- Uh-huh.

1534
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:51,125
I hear you're doing
fine at the garden.

1535
01:27:51,216 --> 01:27:53,502
Oh, well, you know,
making a living.

1536
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:59,220
Um, let's have another drink.
The real stuff is in there.

1537
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:00,513
Yeah!

1538
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:05,560
Mighty nice of you
to give us this fine party.

1539
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:08,810
Oh, nothin' at all.
Why, we are buddies, aren't we?

1540
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:11,266
As a matter of fact,
we cut off our European tour

1541
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:13,067
so Annie could be with Frank.

1542
01:28:13,155 --> 01:28:16,272
Is that so? Well, I wonder
how we could manage that.

1543
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:18,126
You know, I've been
wondering the same thing.

1544
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,492
Uh, let me propose a toast.

1545
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:22,240
To the two greatest
showmen in America.

1546
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,664
- Oh, oh, please.
- Pawnee Bill and Buffalo Bill.

1547
01:28:26,752 --> 01:28:28,834
What a combination. Yes.

1548
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,172
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1549
01:28:34,259 --> 01:28:35,544
We could merge the shows

1550
01:28:35,635 --> 01:28:37,280
and then Annie and Frank
could be together.

1551
01:28:37,304 --> 01:28:40,011
Oh, now, now,
why didn't I think of that?

1552
01:28:40,098 --> 01:28:42,134
I'm sure this calls
for a real celebration.

1553
01:28:42,225 --> 01:28:43,505
Let me fill 'em up
again for you.

1554
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,597
- Bill, darling.
- Beat it!

1555
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:48,644
Well...

1556
01:28:48,732 --> 01:28:50,393
- Well...
- There we are.

1557
01:28:50,484 --> 01:28:52,224
Here's to the new Buffalo Bill

1558
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:53,855
Pawnee Bill wild west show.

1559
01:28:53,945 --> 01:28:56,025
Hold on there. No, sir,
here's to the new Pawnee Bill

1560
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:57,482
Buffalo Bill wild west show.

1561
01:28:57,574 --> 01:28:59,690
Oh, no, you come first,
you come first.

1562
01:28:59,785 --> 01:29:01,741
I bet they're going
to serve dove for dinner.

1563
01:29:01,828 --> 01:29:04,319
Oh, this is a night
I will always remember.

1564
01:29:04,414 --> 01:29:06,621
Uh, me too, BB.

1565
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:10,292
- Now, if we had $100,000...
- If we only had a $100,000...

1566
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:11,959
A hundred thousand what?

1567
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:13,412
I was gonna say,
if we had $100,000

1568
01:29:13,507 --> 01:29:15,998
we could pay off our debts.

1569
01:29:16,092 --> 01:29:18,549
- What were you going to say?
- The same thing.

1570
01:29:18,637 --> 01:29:22,095
- Why, you dirty crook!
- What do you mean me?

1571
01:29:22,182 --> 01:29:23,763
Miss Annie Oakley.

1572
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,806
Chief sitting bull.

1573
01:29:25,894 --> 01:29:27,976
- Do you see him yet?
- He'll be here.

1574
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:40,738
Miss Oakley, enchanted.

1575
01:29:40,826 --> 01:29:42,657
You're a friend
of Frank Butler's, ain't you?

1576
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:46,157
- How'd you know?
- White gloves.

1577
01:29:46,248 --> 01:29:48,239
- Charmed.
- Enchanted.

1578
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:50,244
- Enchanted.
- Charmed.

1579
01:29:50,335 --> 01:29:52,200
- Oh, charmed.
- Oh, enchanted.

1580
01:29:52,295 --> 01:29:54,502
- Enchanted.
- Oh, charmed.

1581
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,420
- Delighted.
- Oh, no.

1582
01:29:56,508 --> 01:29:58,169
You either got
to be charmed or enchanted.

1583
01:29:59,553 --> 01:30:01,134
May I get you
some chicken salad?

1584
01:30:01,221 --> 01:30:02,381
You sure can.

1585
01:30:02,472 --> 01:30:03,825
I don't know what's
ailin' me lately

1586
01:30:03,849 --> 01:30:05,805
but I'm always hungry.

1587
01:30:05,892 --> 01:30:09,009
- I wonder what that's from.
- From not eatin'.

1588
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:12,596
All those medals, I read
they were worth $100,000.

1589
01:30:12,691 --> 01:30:14,773
Oh, what is that big one for?

1590
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:17,602
For shooting the apple
off of the crown prince's head.

1591
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:19,311
And-and this little one?

1592
01:30:19,406 --> 01:30:21,647
For shootin' the worm
out of the apple.

1593
01:30:21,741 --> 01:30:23,402
Isn't she heavenly?

1594
01:30:23,493 --> 01:30:25,734
Oh, Miss Oakley, won't you
shoot something for us?

1595
01:30:25,829 --> 01:30:27,319
- Oh, yes.
- Please do.

1596
01:30:27,414 --> 01:30:29,746
Oh, if only I had brung
my gun, I'd love to.

1597
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:31,243
I'd love to shoot all of you.

1598
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:35,077
Pawnee Bill!

1599
01:30:35,171 --> 01:30:36,502
Waiter, drop that tray

1600
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:38,080
and throw the guests
of honor out!

1601
01:30:38,174 --> 01:30:39,630
What's the matter,
ain't we mergin'?

1602
01:30:39,718 --> 01:30:41,754
The merger's off.
Alright, come on, everybody.

1603
01:30:41,845 --> 01:30:43,631
What, what?

1604
01:30:43,722 --> 01:30:46,008
They haven't got as much money
as we haven't got.

1605
01:30:46,099 --> 01:30:47,714
Oh, papa bull,
you gotta do somethin'!

1606
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,765
Wait!

1607
01:30:49,853 --> 01:30:52,640
Two shows must go together.

1608
01:30:52,731 --> 01:30:55,097
Annie want Frank,
Annie get Frank.

1609
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:57,557
- Papa bull find money.
- Where?

1610
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:00,894
Me know paleface
with many diamonds, much gold.

1611
01:31:00,989 --> 01:31:02,229
Who?

1612
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:04,861
- You.
- Me?

1613
01:31:04,951 --> 01:31:07,283
Oh, but I can't sell my medals.

1614
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:10,362
No sell medals,
no money for merger.

1615
01:31:10,457 --> 01:31:14,416
- No merger, nobody merge.
- Oh, but we gotta merge!

1616
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,288
There's too many
white gloves around here.

1617
01:31:16,379 --> 01:31:17,915
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1618
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:20,167
If I can keep 'em
until Frank sees 'em

1619
01:31:20,258 --> 01:31:21,293
you can have 'em.

1620
01:31:23,094 --> 01:31:25,210
Well, my old partner!

1621
01:31:25,305 --> 01:31:27,887
Oh, it'll be great to be working
together again, Bill.

1622
01:31:27,974 --> 01:31:30,511
And, waiter, champagne
for all the guests of honor.

1623
01:31:30,602 --> 01:31:32,513
Come on, come on, everybody.

1624
01:31:32,604 --> 01:31:34,790
Annie, you realize you just
gave up your whole bankroll.

1625
01:31:34,814 --> 01:31:36,099
Ah, shucks. I don't care.

1626
01:31:36,191 --> 01:31:37,772
I've got what I had
when I started.

1627
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,851

Frank.

1680
01:34:36,496 --> 01:34:37,952
Oh, don't move or I'll fall.

1681
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,449
I ain't ever movin' again.

1682
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,747
What you got spilled on you?

1683
01:34:44,838 --> 01:34:46,123
Eau de Cologne water.

1684
01:34:47,132 --> 01:34:48,542
It's powerful, ain't it?

1685
01:34:51,427 --> 01:34:54,339
Oh, Frank, look, look.

1686
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:55,761
Polish!

1687
01:34:55,849 --> 01:34:57,589
- Oh, you look wonderful.
- Oh, do I?

1688
01:35:00,186 --> 01:35:04,020
Do I... do I dazzle you?

1689
01:35:04,107 --> 01:35:06,098
Yeah, I couldn't have
stood it much longer.

1690
01:35:06,192 --> 01:35:09,400
Am I... am I drivin' you crazy?

1691
01:35:09,487 --> 01:35:11,443
Plumb.

1692
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:13,442
- I love you, Annie.
- Oh, I love you back.

1693
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:21,241
Oh, why didn't you write to me?

1694
01:35:21,332 --> 01:35:22,726
Well, I figured
you'd be all tied up

1695
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,332
with them European
counts and Dukes.

1696
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:29,333
I've been hearin' about your
collection of white gloves.

1697
01:35:29,424 --> 01:35:32,006
- I missed you every minute.
- Keep talkin'.

1698
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:33,237
Didn't like livin' without you.

1699
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:34,546
Keep talkin'.

1700
01:35:34,637 --> 01:35:35,906
You're everybody
in the world, Annie.

1701
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:38,262
- Keep talkin'.
- I don't wanna talk.

1702
01:35:40,894 --> 01:35:42,259
I just wanna hold you like this.

1703
01:35:46,024 --> 01:35:48,015
Annie? Annie?

1704
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:49,974
Annie? Annie!

1705
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:54,528
Annie, I want you
to have somethin'.

1706
01:35:58,661 --> 01:36:00,526
Oh, Frank!

1707
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:02,328
I can't take 'em.
Honest I can't!

1708
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:03,905
Oh, go on, honey.

1709
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,840
A little jewelry
will look good with that ring.

1710
01:36:10,089 --> 01:36:11,420
Go on.

1711
01:36:11,507 --> 01:36:14,374
- Pin 'em on.
- Uh, where?

1712
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:17,176
Well, I got a little piece
of space left between...

1713
01:36:18,306 --> 01:36:19,842
France and Switzerland.

1714
01:36:19,933 --> 01:36:21,469
How come you got
that vacant lot there?

1715
01:36:21,559 --> 01:36:23,595
Oh, I didn't wear 'em all.

1716
01:36:23,686 --> 01:36:25,267
Well, what you waitin' for?

1717
01:36:25,355 --> 01:36:26,765
No, you don't want these.

1718
01:36:26,856 --> 01:36:28,187
Haven't got any stones in 'em.

1719
01:36:28,274 --> 01:36:30,481
Oh! I got all the stones I want.
Go ahead, Frank.

1720
01:36:30,568 --> 01:36:32,399
No, these are too plain for you.

1721
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:34,193
They just got writin'
on the back.

1722
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:37,192
"To Frank Butler, the champion
sharpshooter of the world."

1723
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,695
Of what world?

1724
01:36:40,787 --> 01:36:42,152
The old world or the new world?

1725
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:43,407
The whole world!

1726
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:44,516
I got all these
that says you ain't!

1727
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:45,559
They don't prove anything!

1728
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,073
I ain't been beat yet!

1729
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:48,771
If you are referrin'
to that time back in Cincinnati

1730
01:36:48,795 --> 01:36:49,855
that was just beginner's luck.

1731
01:36:49,879 --> 01:36:50,879
- What?
- You heard me!

1732
01:36:50,922 --> 01:36:51,941
I thought maybe that nonsense

1733
01:36:51,965 --> 01:36:53,501
had been knocked out of you!

1734
01:36:53,591 --> 01:36:55,152
Why, it couldn't happen again
in a million years!

1735
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:57,667
Oh, no? It's going to
happen again tomorrow!

1736
01:36:57,762 --> 01:36:59,502
- Charlie! Charlie!
- Yes, yes?

1737
01:36:59,597 --> 01:37:01,758
Find someplace where we can
have ourselves a match.

1738
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:04,056
- Who?
- Me and old potshot here!

1739
01:37:04,143 --> 01:37:05,474
Oh, a love match.

1740
01:37:05,561 --> 01:37:07,039
Ah, there ain't no love
in a shootin' woman.

01:37:07,063 --> 01:37:08,678
What a wife she'd make!

1742
01:37:08,773 --> 01:37:10,542
Instead of tendin' a house,
she'd be tending her guns.

1743
01:37:10,566 --> 01:37:12,336
Instead of stayin' home sewin',
she'd be out hitting targets.

1744
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,505
- Yeah, you'd be missin' 'em!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1745
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:16,465
That's not the right spirit
to start working together.

01:37:16,489 --> 01:37:18,696
- We're not workin' together!

for the championship

1830
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:31,732
Between Miss Annie Oakley...

1831
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:36,200
And Mr. Frank Butler!

1832
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,707
Straight shooting,
using clay targets

1833
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:43,753
the best out of 100 shots

1834
01:41:43,839 --> 01:41:45,545

1835
01:41:46,551 --> 01:41:47,757

Ooh, this one fixed.

1844
01:42:06,362 --> 01:42:08,102
Unless he'd like a handicap.

1845
01:42:08,197 --> 01:42:09,562

1846
01:42:09,657 --> 01:42:11,739

01:42:11,826 --> 01:42:13,987
And I've only got
a half hour to beat her.

1848
01:42:14,078 --> 01:42:15,568
- Now, Frank...
- Beat me?

1849
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:17,516

tin badges of yours!

1855
01:42:27,133 --> 01:42:28,748
Annie, you can't
bet away $100,000.

1856
01:42:28,843 --> 01:42:30,128

sharpshooter in the world.

1912
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,296
Annie, you don't know
what you're doin'.

1913
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,605
- Oh, yes I do.
- Ow!

1914
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:37,402
- Pardon me!
- It just ain't no use.

1915
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,822
I-I ain't the champion anymore.

1916
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:42,070
I'm only second best.

1917
01:45:42,161 --> 01:45:43,742
Ain't that right, papa bull?

1918
01:45:43,829 --> 01:45:45,740
That's right, little sure shot.

1919
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:47,446
I don't know
what's gonna happen to me.

1920
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:50,749
I guess I'll have to
go back to Darke county.

1921
01:45:50,836 --> 01:45:53,077
Well, uh, go on!
He won the match, Charlie.

1922
01:45:53,172 --> 01:45:54,753
Give him the medals. Charlie!

1923
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,125
Give him those medals.

1924
01:45:59,845 --> 01:46:02,131
- Annie, these belong to you.
- No.

1925
01:46:02,223 --> 01:46:04,339
You won 'em. You keep 'em.

1926
01:46:04,433 --> 01:46:06,344
We're gonna be partners.

1927
01:46:06,435 --> 01:46:08,721
Partners? Oh, Frank!

1928
01:46:08,813 --> 01:46:10,019
