1
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,250
I would like to say a few words
about weddings.

2
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,213
I've just been through one.

3
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,545
Not my own. My daughter's.

4
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,100
Someday in the far future
I may be able to remember it

5
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,102
with tender indulgence, but not now.

6
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,641
I always used to think
that marriage was a simple affair.

7
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,611
Boy and girl meet,
they fall in love, get married.

8
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,732
They have babies,
eventually the babies grow up,

9
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,902
meet other babies,
they fall in love and get married,

10
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,903
so on and on and on.

11
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,076
Looked at that way, it's not only simple,
it's downright monotonous.

12
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,579
But I was wrong.
I figured without the wedding.

13
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,841
Now you fathers will understand.
You have a little girl.

14
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:51,301
She looks up to you. You're her oracle.
You're her hero.

15
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,017
And then the day comes when
she gets her first permanent wave

16
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,678
and goes to her first real party,

17
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,432
and from that day on
you're in a constant state of panic.

18
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,484
If the boys swarm around,
you're in a panic

19
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,566
for fear she'll marry one of them.

20
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,939
If they don't swarm around, why,

21
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,736
of course you're in another
kind of a panic,

22
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,446
and you wonder what's the matter with her.

23
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,781
So you don't worry about it.

24
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,784
You say to yourself, "I've got
plenty of time to worry about that.

25
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,999
"I'll just put off thinking about it."

26
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,461
And then suddenly it is upon you.

27
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,137
It was just three months ago,
exactly three months ago,

28
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,172
that the storm broke here.

29
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,305
It was an ordinary day,
very much like any other day.

30
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,516
I had caught the commuters' train home,
as usual.

31
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,144
It was late, as usual.

32
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,483
We own our own home in the suburbs,
at least we almost own it.

33
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,737
Had it built when my law firm
made me a full-fledged partner.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,199
As usual it was Ellie
who was the first to greet me.

35
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,660
She asked me what kind of a day I'd had,

36
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,333
and I asked her
what kind of a day she'd had.

37
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,294
And our Delilah, she was always the same.

38
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,503
Another kitchen crisis,
but that's routine.

39
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,469
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

40
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,172
May I have the keys to the car?

41
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,306
- Yeah. Be careful now.
- Okay.

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,305
Good night.

43
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,516
As usual, Ben wanted the car.

44
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,353
Ben's a nice, steady boy in college,
studying engineering.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,187
Hi, Pop.

46
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,148
- How you doing?
- Hi.

47
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,236
And Tommy. No worry about him,
except to try to keep him fed.

48
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,154
It was "hi" and "goodbye" that night,
but I'm used to that.

49
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,040
I was wondering if my daughter
had deserted us too,

50
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,667
when I heard her voice.

51
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,044
Pops! Pops!

52
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,039
- Hi, Pops.
- Kay was our only daughter.

53
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,633
I know a father's
not supposed to have favorites,

54
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,918
but when it's Kay...

55
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,012
- Mmm, you smell good.
- You like it?

56
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,550
- What's that?
- An atomizer.

57
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,218
- Where'd you get it? A present?
- Mmm-hmm.

58
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,062
- Who from?
- Oh. Somebody.

59
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,654
What's happened to you?
You look different.

60
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,740
- I do?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,987
You look all lit up inside.

62
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,789
You're not wearing
your usual deadpan look,

63
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,451
that "how did I ever
get into this family" look.

64
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,959
Oh, Pops.

65
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,376
I know. You've been taking
those vitamins that Dr. Gray sent you.

66
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,711
That's right.

67
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,312
I guess I'll get me
some of those vitamins.

68
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,066
I'll get it, Delilah!

69
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,991
What's the matter with her?
She seems kind of queer.

70
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,864
I don't know. Maybe she's in love.

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,500
- In love. Who would she be in love with?
- I haven't the wildest idea.

72
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,832
You must have some idea
or you wouldn't have mentioned it.

73
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,584
Well...

74
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,836
Buckley.

75
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,717
- Who?
- Buckley.

76
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,961
- Buckley who?
- You know that boy.

77
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,009
Buckley something-or-other.
I don't know his last name.

78
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,302
Never heard of him.

79
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,057
Oh, of course you have.
He's been here again and again.

80
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,387
- That doesn't mean anything.
- All right, I'm wrong.

81
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,894
Sorry. Forgive me.

82
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,484
- Who was it, dear?
- Buckley.

83
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,821
- He's coming for me in a few minutes.
- I'll get your coffee.

84
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,781
- Where did the boys go?
- Ben had some date,

85
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,449
and Tommy went for basketball practice.

86
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,909
Oh, Delilah, will you bring
the coffee, please?

87
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,167
Yes, Miss Banks.

88
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,796
Wouldn't you think those boys
would stay home once in a while?

89
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,340
Ben's not a boy, Pops. He's a man.

90
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,339
- He's old enough to have a family.
- At 19?

91
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,055
Buckley says that's not too young
for a man to marry.

92
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,846
I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.

93
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,852
Oh, I know, Pops,
but that was millions of years ago.

94
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,229
Look at all the men
in Ben's class at college.

95
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,065
Loads of them are married
and have children.

96
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,224
GI's.

97
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,820
Buckley says everyone should marry young.

98
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:25,245
Did Buckley happen to mention who was
going to finance these child marriages?

99
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,410
Oh, he says the family
should support them.

100
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,662
He says it's really economy
in the long run.

101
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,127
The men work better
and the babies are healthier.

102
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,333
From the way she talked
about this Buckley,

103
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,046
you'd think he was Moses and
Einstein and Gallup all rolled into one.

104
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,214
I tried to remember which one he was.

105
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,887
There'd been so many boys
who had beat a path to our door.

106
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,548
Which one of them was Buckley?

107
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,058
Was it the boy with the teeth?

108
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,562
Or the guy with the porcupine hair?

109
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,233
Or the English teacher,
that poop-a-doop that Ellie liked?

110
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,196
I hoped he wasn't that muscle-bound ham
with the shoulders.

111
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,946
And she'd never fall for that bebop hound.

112
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,622
It couldn't be that genius
who said he'd fix my radio.

113
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,415
She couldn't do that to me.

114
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,912
Couldn't be the radical.
He hadn't been on a picket line in years.

115
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,042
Surely my daughter wouldn't fall
for any of them, or would she?

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,718
Since the country's in better shape...

117
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
She was still going on about him.

118
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,797
Buckley has it all figured out.

119
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,259
He says there isn't going to be
any depression.

120
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,309
Oh, that reminds me.
I won't be home for the weekend.

121
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,480
- Where are you going, dear?
- I'm spending it with Buckley's family.

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,775
Uh, are you going to marry this character?

123
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,529
I guess so.

124
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,865
And just when are you planning
on getting married?

125
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,953
Well, I really don't know yet, Mother.

126
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,038
It all depends on Buckley's plans.

127
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,171
Maybe months, maybe a few weeks,
or maybe any time at all.

128
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,835
We can't tell yet.

129
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,625
But there's one thing,
we won't be pinned down.

130
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,632
Buckley's very decided
about that sort of thing.

131
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,634
He just won't be pinned down.

132
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,515
I hope that Buckley
won't think I'm too nosy

133
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,642
if I ask a few simple questions.

134
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,479
Okay, Pops.
I suppose we have to go through this.

135
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,478
- It seems to me...
- Who is this Buckley anyway?

136
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,655
- Now listen, Pops...
- And what's his last name?

137
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,449
- I hope it's better than his first one.
- Now listen...

138
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,322
Where the devil does he come from,

139
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,073
and who does he think
is going to support him?

140
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,284
If he thinks I am,
he's got another thing coming.

141
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,911
- I don't give a hoot...
- Stanley!

142
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,706
Stanley, you don't have to shout.
Nobody's deaf.

143
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,330
It's mortifying, with...
Right in there. Please.

144
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,301
The idea, acting like an outraged father.

145
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,423
Sorry. You broke it to me so casually,
over the ice cream.

146
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,516
You might have at least waited
until I got the coffee.

147
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,352
Thanks, Delilah. I'll pour it.

148
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,227
- You don't give Kay a chance.
- Now listen, Pops.

149
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,403
I'm 20, and Buckley's 26,
and we're grown people.

150
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,653
And as far as your supporting Buckley,
I'll tell you this right now.

151
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,947
He's the kind
that wouldn't let anyone support him.

152
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,365
He'd rather die first.

153
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,196
That's the kind of a person he is.

154
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,373
He's a wonderful person.

155
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,209
He's the kind of a person
that's absolutely...

156
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,583
I mean, absolutely independent.

157
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,836
Buckley wouldn't come to you for help,

158
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,126
not even if we were starving
in the gutter.

159
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,139
And his name is Dunstan.

160
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,801
That's what it is. Buckley Dunstan.

161
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,303
And he's a wonderful businessman.

162
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,268
I mean, a really wonderful businessman.

163
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,899
- And he has a wonderful job.
- Doing what?

164
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,774
I don't know, Pops. He makes something.

165
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,359
Does it really matter what it is?

166
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,700
He's the kind of a person
that can do anything, anything at all.

167
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,112
He's... He's...

168
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,807
Absolutely terribly wonderful.

169
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,918
Stanley, you've hurt her.

170
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,924
You know, while she was talking,
all I could think of was a little girl

171
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,130
in brown pigtails and dirty overalls,

172
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,632
flying at the boys
when they pushed her too far.

173
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,178
Seems like such
an incredibly short time ago.

174
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,893
Go speak to her. I'm afraid she's crying.

175
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,064
Kay.

176
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,993
And as for his parents,
I'll tell you this right now, Pops.

177
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,447
They're just as good as you and Moms.

178
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,287
They're fine people,
and they live in Westbridge.

179
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,751
I guess you'll agree that Westbridge
is just as good a place as Fairview Manor.

180
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,125
Oh, I don't see
what that has to do with it anyway.

181
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,345
Okay, kitten. I love him already.

182
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,599
What'd you say his last name was?

183
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,718
Oh, Pops!

184
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,938
Stanley! Come away from that window.

185
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,611
I want to get a peek at this Superman.

186
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,763
How nice. Come in.

187
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,345
- Stanley.
- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.

188
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,386
Kay will be down in a minute.
She went up to get her things.

189
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,221
Won't you come in and sit down?

190
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,565
- Well, I...
- Stanley?

191
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,059
Stanley.

192
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,532
Darling, you remember Mr...
Somehow I can't call you Mr. anything.

193
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,284
You won't mind if I call you Buckley,
will you?

194
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,534
Please do.

195
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,328
Good evening, sir.

196
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,869
- How are you?
- Fine.

197
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,659
- And you?
- Fine.

198
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,171
Kay's just been telling us
some very exciting news.

199
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,546
I hope you don't mind.

200
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,800
No, indeed. We're delighted.
Aren't we, Stanley?

201
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,840
It's wonderful, so exciting,
having a romance right under our...

202
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:20,050
That is, well, you might say,
right in our midst, isn't it, Stanley?

203
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,311
- Stanley.
- Hmm? Oh, yes.

204
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,142
I'm afraid it was a little sudden,
but I couldn't...

205
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,036
- Hello there.
- Hello.

206
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,456
- Was I too early?
- Oh, no.

207
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,082
Better put on your heavy coat,
there's no warmth in that thing.

208
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,378
Pops, I'd die in that heavy coat.
I'd simply smother to death.

209
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,301
- Just the same, I'd wear it.
- Oh, Pops, don't fuss.

210
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,463
- I'll be perfectly all right.
- I think you'd better take it.

211
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,266
- You do?
- Yes.

212
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,226
Okay.

213
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,653
Right then I realized
that my day was over.

214
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,616
She'll always love us, of course,
but not in the old way.

215
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,952
From here on her love will be doled out

216
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,410
like a farmer's wife
tossing scraps to a family rooster.

217
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,125
- Good night, Moms.
- Good night, dear.

218
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,628
Good night, Pops. Oh, don't wait up.
We'll probably be late.

219
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,289
- Good night.
- Good night.

220
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,969
I don't like him.

221
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,008
Oh, darling, I know he isn't
good enough for Kay.

222
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,303
But then no one is or ever will be.

223
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,059
At least he's head and shoulders
above all her other beaus.

224
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,690
That's certainly a great recommendation.

225
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,521
Now, Stanley, she's old enough
to know her own mind.

226
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,814
Old enough? That child?

227
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,195
You didn't mind that I was only 18
when I married you.

228
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,486
- Oh, that's different.
- That's different.

229
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,656
Oh, she'll make a beautiful bride.

230
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,243
She has just the coloring and figure.

231
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,205
I know exactly the dress she should wear.
It was in last month's Vogue.

232
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,504
I couldn't believe it.
Ellie was as happy as a lark.

233
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,129
She wasn't worrying about this Buckley.
Her mind was on the wedding.

234
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,001
Some of them can make you look
simply ghastly.

235
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,760
But this was perfect.
I'll find it for you.

236
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,092
It had just a touch of eggshell pink.

237
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,929
What's the matter, darling?
Can't you sleep?

238
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,310
- No.
- You want some hot milk?

239
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,597
- No.
- Well, then, good night.

240
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,895
- You're wonderful.
- Thank you, darling.

241
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,904
If Kay was out
at some little dance somewhere,

242
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,410
you wouldn't close your eyes
until you heard her come in.

243
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,576
Now, when it's a question of whether
she's gonna eat for the rest of her life,

244
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,410
- you go to sleep like a baby.
- Eat? You want something to eat?

245
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,455
I am talking about Kay, Ellie. Kay.

246
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,627
She sits there tonight and says, "I'm
going to marry Buckley. Isn't he cute?"

247
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,923
And we all dance and make faces.
What do we know about him?

248
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,968
Darling, if you're gonna sit up,
you better put on your robe.

249
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
We don't know a thing about him.
Not a darn thing.

250
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,686
Not where he comes from,
what he makes, or what he makes making it.

251
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,436
Only thing we know about him is his name,
and you weren't too sure about that.

252
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,570
Yet he walks in, and we hand him Kay.

253
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,107
Darling, you only have to look at him
to know that he's nice

254
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,900
and that he comes from a nice family.

255
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,038
He calls you "sir"
and holds my chair for me.

256
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,290
That reminds me, I must call
his family tomorrow morning,

257
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,243
tell them how happy we are.

258
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,456
Is that all you need?
Is that all you need?

259
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,463
That he holds your chair for you
and that he says "sir" to me?

260
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,838
Is that all you want?
Well, it isn't all I want!

261
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,128
I want to know whether
he's going to make her happy.

262
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,467
Whether he's going to make a home for her,
can he support her?

263
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,598
You heard his ideas on marriage,
didn't you?

264
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,555
He thinks the family should support them.

265
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,512
And you know which family he means,
don't you, honey?

266
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,021
He means us.

267
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,316
Sure, sure, he figures
on moving in with us.

268
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,525
Then when the food gets a little bad,
he'll dump the kids on us and skip.

269
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,487
Probably done it before.
Probably got a wife somewhere else.

270
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,992
Read about those things all the time.

271
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,661
Fellas have wives
in three or four places. Families.

272
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,788
How do we know?
Maybe he's got a criminal record.

273
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,663
Fella might be a counterfeiter
or a confidence man.

274
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,963
Those are the ones,
those smooth-talking ones

275
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,714
that have the manners.

276
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,550
Manners are their stock-in-trade. Yeah.

277
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,758
Those soft-spoken fellas
who look you right in the eye

278
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,515
and would put a bullet in the back
of her neck and never turn a hair.

279
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,678
You mark my words,
this is going to end in tragedy.

280
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,815
But, Stanley, I...

281
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,443
I got it off my chest.

282
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,576
Funny, the minute you get someone else
worrying, you stop worrying yourself.

283
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,845
Come in.

284
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,223
Well, you're an early bird.

285
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,605
How you could sleep last night
I don't know.

286
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,525
I couldn't close my eyes.
I was so upset about Kay.

287
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,409
Kay? What's Kay done now?

288
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,570
Oh, I kept thinking about what you said.

289
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,042
Suppose he is a good-for-nothing.
Suppose he doesn't mean to make a home...

290
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,623
Oh, now, stop worrying, Ellie.

291
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,711
Stanley, you've got to have a talk with
him before this thing goes any farther.

292
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,127
You've got to come right out and ask him
about what he has and everything.

293
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,045
Oh, darling, I can't do that.

294
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,881
I can't walk up and say,
"How's your bank balance, kid?"

295
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,720
- Why not? You're her father.
- I know, but even a father...

296
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,765
Stanley, I believe you're afraid of him.

297
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,979
- Well, that's a fine remark, I must say.
- Stanley, Kay's up.

298
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,944
You tell her you want to see this boy
and see him right away.

299
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,626
- Finished?
- Mmm.

300
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,134
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.

301
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,639
- How are you?
- Fine.

302
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,266
Uh, Kay?

303
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,265
Uh... About Buckley.

304
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,474
What about him?

305
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,235
Oh, I think he's great. Fine.
Nice clean-cut chap.

306
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,816
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

307
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,153
I thought, you know,
we might have a little talk.

308
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,615
I thought I'd talk to him about
what he's earning, you know.

309
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,826
You're kidding.
I didn't believe they really did that.

310
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,458
- Thought it was just a gag.
- Well, you know, after all,

311
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,118
when a man's only daughter
is gonna be married...

312
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,286
Okay.

313
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,330
If you want to go through
all that old-fashioned rigmarole,

314
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,630
it's okay with me.

315
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,260
- When do you want to see him?
- Well, what about tonight?

316
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,173
- We have a date at 9:00.
- Why don't you ask him to dinner?

317
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,261
Then we can talk before dinner.
About 6:30?

318
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,222
Okay. I'll deliver him.

319
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,854
Kay, you know, tell him
we're just gonna have a little chat.

320
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,608
Don't make it sound too formidable.
I don't want to frighten the boy to death.

321
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,735
Oh, don't worry about Buckley.

322
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,487
He's big enough to take it.

323
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,714
Hi.

324
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,382
Hi.

325
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,590
Oh.

326
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,272
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.

327
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,686
I hope you'll forgive us.

328
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,896
It's Delilah's night out,
and Kay and I are cooking dinner.

329
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,443
We might even put you to work.
I have an apron...

330
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,106
Oh, not now, Mother.
Let him get his talk with Pops over first.

331
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,277
- Talk? You're gonna have a talk?
- Yes, a talk.

332
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,945
- Oh.
- Where's Pops?

333
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,573
- He's in the living room, I think.
- Come on.

334
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,081
- Here he is, Pops.
- Oh, hello.

335
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,342
- Good evening, sir.
- Make it snappy.

336
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,093
Dinner is in half an hour.

337
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,970
- Sit down, sit down.
- Thanks.

338
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,223
- I'll take that.
- Thanks, but I'll need the papers.

339
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,761
- Okay.
- Kay said you wanted to talk to me.

340
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,429
Yeah. Would you like to have
a little drink first?

341
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,642
No, sir.

342
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,100
- Smoke, then?
- I have some, thanks.

343
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,236
- Will you?
- No, thanks. I'll smoke a pipe.

344
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,441
Wonderful thing, a pipe. You smoke a pipe?

345
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,605
No, sir.

346
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,364
I like a pipe,
especially after a hard day.

347
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,780
All the rush and fuss.
It sort of changes your pace.

348
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,948
- Rests you.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,995
- Are you comfortable there?
- Yes, sir.

350
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,505
I brought some papers
that I wanted you to...

351
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,134
Oh, I suppose you think it's
kind of silly, this financial talk,

352
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:01,048
but I want to tell you that I wish
my father-in-law had sat down with me

353
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,305
before Ellie and I got married.

354
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,717
- I think it sort of clears the air.
- You're right, sir.

355
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,140
You sure you wouldn't like a little drink?

356
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,475
- Yes, sir.
- You would?

357
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,516
- I mean, yes, sir, I'm sure I won't.
- Oh.

358
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,812
- Where were we?
- Oh...

359
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,697
We were talking about your father-in-law.

360
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,826
Oh, yes. Well, someday...

361
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,578
I think that I probably understand,

362
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,913
you know, the problems of young couples,
what they're up against, of course.

363
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,210
Matter of fact,
the parents are up against it too,

364
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,919
what with high prices
and high taxes and everything.

365
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,676
The long and short of it is,
I think that probably you're entitled

366
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,214
to know what you can expect from me
just as I'm entitled to know

367
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,224
what I can expect from you.
Sort of get to know about each other.

368
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,885
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

369
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,813
So, my proposal is this.

370
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,099
I thought I'd tell you
a little about my set-up,

371
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,109
and then we could go
into your financial picture.

372
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,360
Yes, sir.

373
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,237
Well, in the first place, Buckley,

374
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,691
you look around at this house
and everything,

375
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,867
and you probably think,
"Well, he's pretty well-off."

376
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,329
But let me tell you, my boy,
that doesn't mean a thing.

377
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,083
The day I married Ellie,
my position with the law firm

378
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,541
of Bartham, Henderson and Peck
was as nebulous...

379
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,214
In half an hour,
I told him more about my affairs

380
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,341
than I had told Ellie in a lifetime.

381
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,880
Well, you take all of those things,
the insurance, the mortgages,

382
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,890
the kids' schooling,
straightening Tommy's teeth,

383
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,677
they all sound tough,
but as I look back upon it

384
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,221
I think it was good to assume
some responsibility.

385
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,016
- Gives you something to work for.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,987
Now, if you'd like to look
at some of these papers that I brought...

387
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,239
Come on, you two. Soup's on the table.

388
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,823
We'll have to go into that another time.
We mustn't keep Kay waiting any longer.

389
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,113
- Did you have a nice talk?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

390
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,246
I feel much better about everything.
Don't we, son?

391
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,699
- Yes, sir.
- Run along now, son.

392
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,908
Don't keep Kay waiting.

393
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,418
He's a smart boy.

394
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,746
Got a good head on his shoulders.
Fine business sense.

395
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,752
I should say he has.
When Kay told me he'd saved $5,000,

396
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,133
and being the head of his own company
at his age.

397
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,296
You see how silly we were to worry?
Come on.

398
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,093
This is the street.

399
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,393
Too bad Kay couldn't have picked
her in-laws from somebody we knew

400
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,932
instead of somebody we never laid eyes on.

401
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,767
362, 364.

402
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,612
- Bet they won't even have a drink.
- What makes you think they won't?

403
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,985
Mmm, just that kind of people, I'll bet.

404
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,617
What if they don't?
You're not an alcoholic, are you?

405
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,322
I don't know why you get yourself
in such a lather

406
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,863
at the thought of meeting
the Dunstans, anyway.

407
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,907
I'm not in a lather. Who's in a lather?

408
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,748
- Ought to be around here someplace.
- Bet it's a shack.

409
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,128
Here it is. 394.

410
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,716
There's your shack.

411
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,639
I have a feeling they're behind
those curtains watching us.

412
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,982
- Good afternoon.
- Good...

413
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,071
May I have your coat?

414
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,036
Thank you.

415
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,008
- Hello.
- Hi.

416
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,341
- Good to see you.
- How do you do, Mrs. Banks?

417
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,302
Well, well, look at this.

418
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,717
There's the wedding, sure has gotten us.

419
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,602
I can't tell you how crazy
we are about your Kay.

420
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,139
We feel just the same way about Buckley.

421
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,057
Yes, he's a wonderful boy.

422
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:44,024
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
he's a lucky boy to get a girl like Kay.

423
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,690
- Would you like to wash your hands?
- I washed them before I came.

424
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,733
- Shall we go in?
- Yes, will you...

425
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,279
We did more bare-faced lying
in those few minutes

426
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,039
than we had done in our entire lives.

427
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,251
I sent Kay and Buckley out to dinner.

428
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,130
I thought we could get better acquainted
if it were just the four of us.

429
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,380
It's much cozier this way.

430
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,837
I don't know how you feel about it,

431
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,967
but would you like a little snifter
before dinner?

432
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,676
- I beg your pardon?
- I have some Madeira here.

433
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,762
Put it down 25 years ago.
Been saving it for a special occasion.

434
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,307
I must say, I don't know of
a more special occasion than this.

435
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,180
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

436
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,523
I think we should drink
to the bride and groom.

437
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,275
Hear! Hear!

438
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,031
Not too sweet, yet not too dry.

439
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,073
I've been trying to decide

440
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,204
whether Buckley looks like you,
Mrs. Dunstan, or Mr. Dunstan.

441
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:42,370
Oh, do please call us Doris and Herbert,
not Mr. and Mrs. Dunstan.

442
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,917
Stanley and Ellie.

443
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,507
- Play golf, Herbert?
- Well, I play at it, Stanley.

444
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,133
Well...

445
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,974
- I love your house, Doris.
- Oh, thank you, Ellie.

446
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,187
I'm crazy to see yours.
Buckley's always talking about it.

447
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,474
- A little more, Stan?
- Just to help you out, Herb.

448
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,399
There we are. Now that we're all friends,
I'll tell you something.

449
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,273
- I was scared stiff about this meeting.
- Herbert.

450
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,614
Big argument this morning.

451
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,616
Should we or should we not
offer you a drink?

452
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,616
I was all for it, to break the ice,
but Doris was against it.

453
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,281
Afraid you wouldn't approve.
Stickly situation, you know.

454
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,666
We didn't want to start off
on the wrong foot.

455
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,496
Now I'll tell you something funny.

456
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,586
Ellie here must have
changed her clothes three times.

457
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,626
- Stanley.
- Well, you did, didn't you?

458
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,965
I wasn't so scared
I had to stop and get a martini.

459
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,635
- Martini? Is that your drink?
- Well, I...

460
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,846
Then why are we wasting time with this?

461
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,640
Come on!

462
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,737
Now, then.

463
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,868
Well, well, well! Look at that.
Look at that, Ellie.

464
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,153
Well, well, what do you know.

465
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,491
- Can I help you, Herb?
- Well, thanks, Stan.

466
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,170
The minute I laid eyes on your boy,
I liked him.

467
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,920
And now that I've met his mother
and father, I like him even more.

468
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:15,012
I'm sure that the Dunstan-Banks family
are gonna be as one from now on.

469
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,431
And now I want to hear
all about our new daughter.

470
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,891
- There's nothing to tell, really.
- Oh, nonsense!

471
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,227
Would you like to hear
about the time Kay was a baby

472
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,688
and Ellie left her out in front
of the grocery store in the carriage,

473
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,318
went home and forgot all about her?

474
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,069
- It's the truth, though.
- There's a drop left, Stan. How about it?

475
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,778
Kay was about nine months old.

476
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,945
I know every father thinks
his daughter is wonderful,

477
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,863
but I want to tell you,
Kay was really something.

478
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,621
She was five years old
when I gave her her first swimming lesson.

479
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,707
She was absolutely wonderful.
Not frightened a bit.

480
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,124
You know how Ellie is about the water.
Kay takes after me.

481
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,887
After all, a daughter takes after the
father and the father takes... Vice versa.

482
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,137
- Isn't that so, Edith?
- Doris.

483
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,178
- Huh?
- Doris, dear.

484
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:04,057
Doris, yes. Oh, Doris!

485
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,389
Oh, imagine. I said Edith. Where did I...

486
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:11,060
Well, anyway,
she just took like a duck to water.

487
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,274
Like a... When she was about six,

488
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:17,567
I started taking her out to the raft
with the other kids and throwing her in.

489
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,238
Yeah.

490
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,742
She'd just plop in.
Diving in, she calls it.

491
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,036
She was only 15
when the boys started crowding in.

492
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,251
They were all over the house.
I used to come home at night

493
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,088
and find a stranger sleeping
on the sofa in the living room

494
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,762
and one in the hammock
on the porch and one...

495
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,931
And then, all of a sudden,
she seemed to lose interest in them.

496
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,593
- And then...
- Then she met Buckley.

497
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:48,435
- Now you must tell us all about Buckley.
- Yeah, tell us all about Balky.

498
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,068
Well, Buckley was always a good boy.

499
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,154
A thoughtful, sweet boy.

500
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,946
Even when he was only five
I remember him saying,

501
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,612
"Mummy..." That's what
he used to call me, Mummy.

502
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,330
He said, "Mummy, you won't ever die,
will you, Mummy?"

503
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,709
How sweet.

504
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,454
He was a good boy but he wasn't any angel.

505
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,090
He could hold his own
with any of the kids in the block.

506
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,922
And he loved sports.
How that boy loved sports...

507
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,504
It is the duty of the bride's family

508
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,848
to give a party
to announce the engagement.

509
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,472
Apparently this is done
only after everyone knows it.

510
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,930
- Ready?
- It's only 5:00.

511
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,185
You got everything you need?
I borrowed every glass ever made.

512
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,646
Oh, everything's fine, everything's fine,
everything's fine.

513
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,652
In fact, I made a lot of martinis.

514
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,273
That's all anybody ever drinks
at these things, you know, martinis.

515
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,905
Now, Ellie, after I bring in the drinks,

516
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,324
and everybody's got a drink
and something to eat,

517
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,707
then I'm gonna come in ringing the bell.
Oh, yes, ringing the bell.

518
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,834
And you call for silence,
then I'll make the speech.

519
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,667
What do you think of this?
I thought I'd start out,

520
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,653
"Uh, friends, when I was
a very young lawyer..."

521
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,422
They're starting to come. Excuse me, dear.

522
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,340
Oh, they're coming?

523
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:12,857
Friends, when I was a young lawyer,
I made a speech and the man got 10 years.

524
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,855
Now with today's... Oh! Oh!

525
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,814
Well, I see I found the right place.
How are you, Banks?

526
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,365
How about a couple of old-fashioneds
to start things off?

527
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,619
- How about a couple of martinis...
- No, thanks. That's very kind of you,

528
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,155
but a couple of old-fashioneds
would be fine.

529
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,494
I just fixed these up to take out there.

530
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,705
Well, well...

531
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,042
- Tom Collins, please.
- Bourbon and soda.

532
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,754
Wouldn't you like a martini?
Martinis are awful nice.

533
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,835
I hope you have better luck than I did.

534
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,300
I spent 5,000 on my daughter's wedding.

535
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,888
Six months later she was on her way
to Reno. Thanks.

536
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,718
Two old-fashioneds.

537
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,764
Dixon, old boy, how've you been?
Hiya, Stanley.

538
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,648
I see they got you working at last.
Two bourbons in plain water.

539
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,484
How about a nice martini?

540
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,401
- Stanley, Doris and Herbert are here.
- Doris and Herbert who?

541
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,858
- Hello, hello!
- How are you?

542
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,369
- How are you?
- I've got your drinks all ready.

543
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,996
If you don't mind, I think
it's a little early for a martini.

544
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,242
- We'll have scotch.
- I don't think I've got any scotch.

545
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,083
No scotch? Bourbon? Yes, of course. Sure.

546
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,589
Too early for a martini?

547
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,883
- Hi there, Stan.
- Hello, hello. Hi.

548
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,428
The girls want three old-fashioneds.

549
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,431
What do they think I'm doing in here,
filling prescriptions?

550
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,220
Where are the drinks
for the Dunstans, Mr. Banks?

551
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,229
Right here. There you are, Delilah.

552
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,270
Now, four old-fashioneds.

553
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,665
- When are you going to make your speech?
- Soon as I can get in there.

554
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,832
Enjoy your minute in the limelight.
It'll be your last.

555
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,622
From now on the gals take over.

556
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,791
You think they can't add two and two.

557
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,178
When it comes to weddings,
they're giants of industry.

558
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,593
They put it on like
a big theatrical production, too.

559
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,591
The bigger the better.

560
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:16,017
From now on,
your only function is to pay the bills.

561
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,690
No, no, this is going to be
a very simple wedding.

562
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,318
I'm warning you, keep it with family.

563
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,525
Weddings are either confined
to the bosom of the family

564
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,737
or held in Madison Square Garden.
Got my drinks ready?

565
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,867
- Yes, right here.
- Thank you.

566
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,073
- Here.
- Thank you.

567
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,079
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

568
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,615
Nice party, isn't it?

569
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,078
I don't know,
I haven't been out there yet.

570
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,915
Now what do you want?
Couple of dozen frozen daiquiris?

571
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,963
No, I'd like a couple of martinis, sir,
if it's not too much trouble.

572
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,337
Did you say martinis?

573
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,298
Here. Here. Have a couple
and pass the rest around.

574
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,886
- Why, thank you, sir.
- Say, could I have a couple of Cokes?

575
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,182
- Couple of what?
- Cokes.

576
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,677
Couple of Cokes.

577
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,689
Couple of Cokes.

578
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,524
Here, sir, let me.

579
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,252
Thank you, sir.

580
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,687
Five mint juleps, if you please.

581
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,857
Can I help? It'll speed things up.

582
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,821
Oh, no. No. No.

583
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,745
No, I like doing this. It's my hobby.

584
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,828
You were right about that.
Tom Collins, please.

585
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,958
I'll have four rum and Cokes.

586
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,460
Another bourbon and soda.

587
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,462
Good night, Ellie.

588
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,419
Wonderful party. Wonderful.

589
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,634
Well, you're a big help, I must say.
Where have you been?

590
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,098
Where do you think I've been,
shooting pool?

591
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,968
Why must you always
leave everything on my shoulders?

592
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,520
- Has everybody gone?
- Of course. It's almost 8:00.

593
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,269
- I haven't made my speech.
- Well it's too late now.

594
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,688
Now, now, Ellie.
You can't do that to Stan.

595
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,359
You can't deny this man the right
to announce his daughter's engagement.

596
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,445
You don't realize
what a delicate condition he's in.

597
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,450
He's about to become a grandfather.

598
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,196
Come on, Stan. Let's hear your speech.

599
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,208
"As I look at all the old faces
I used to shake hands with...

600
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,128
"Wait for the laugh."

601
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,257
Come on. Let's get one of those martinis.

602
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,137
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

603
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,300
We finally got around
to discussing the wedding.

604
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,520
Well, then, we're all agreed.
It's going to be a small wedding.

605
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:07,897
Ellie?

606
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,315
Small wedding, huh?

607
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,064
Yes, of course, that's what
we all want, a small wedding.

608
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,237
- A small wedding and a small reception.
- Mmm.

609
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,195
That's what I want, too.

610
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,495
- Oh, come on, Buckley. We've got...
- Kay, you're not leaving now?

611
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,410
I've got a million things
to talk to you about.

612
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,417
I never get you two alone.
We've got to make plans.

613
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,542
We've got to set the date, we've got to
make the arrangements about the church...

614
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,005
The church? The what?

615
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,921
- You're not planning on a church wedding?
- Of course.

616
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,343
You weren't married in a church.

617
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,757
We were married in your front parlor
in a blue suit.

618
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,516
- That's just it.
- Just what?

619
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,723
Look, whose wedding are you talking about,
yours or Kay's?

620
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,730
Haven't you got some schoolwork to do?

621
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,605
- Why not May or July?
- May's too early.

622
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,190
- Ellie, what do you mean?
- I'm going to camp in July.

623
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,156
This isn't a kids' party.
It's my wedding and my friends.

624
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,654
No one has to raise a finger.
When the time comes, I'll do everything.

625
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,570
I mean everything.

626
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,908
Ellie! Buckley!

627
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,288
Now, look here, young man.

628
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,166
If you insist upon a church wedding,
you can count me out.

629
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,337
- I wash my hands of the whole affair!
- Stanley!

630
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,173
You two run along.
We'll talk about it tomorrow night.

631
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,213
Don't worry about it. It'll be all right.

632
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,565
Stanley, I don't know
what's the matter with you.

633
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,068
We're having a simple little talk about
the wedding and you fly off the handle.

634
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,359
Now, Ellie, you heard Buckley.
You heard Kay, didn't you?

635
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,573
You said yourself
it was going to be a small wedding.

636
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,079
I know, darling, and it's going to be
a small wedding.

637
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,247
With the things you're talking about?

638
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:50,128
Bridesmaids and churches and automobiles
and flowers and heaven knows what.

639
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,002
But, Stanley, all her friends
are given weddings like that.

640
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,917
If her friends want to go out and bankrupt
themselves, that's their business,

641
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,254
not mine, but we've always lived
very simply, within our means.

642
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,718
Now here, what are we going to do?

643
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,051
Put on a big show,
a big flashy show that we can't afford?

644
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,517
Stan,

645
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,776
there's only one time in a girl's life
that she can be married in a bridal dress.

646
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,616
Just once, and I don't want Kay
to miss it the way I did.

647
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,411
Miss it? Miss it?

648
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,455
Don't you think I wanted a wedding
with all the trimmings?

649
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,075
Then why didn't you have it?

650
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,161
Because you didn't want it,
so I pretended I didn't either.

651
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,131
And you've been brooding about it
all this time?

652
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,300
No, of course not,
but I have thought about it.

653
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,138
You go on out
and buy yourself a wedding dress

654
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:46,302
- and I'll marry you all over again.
- I'll be satisfied to see Kay in one.

655
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:51,018
Stanley, I don't know how to explain,
but a wedding, a church wedding,

656
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,892
it's what every girl dreams of.

657
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,563
A bridal dress, orange blossoms,
the music.

658
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,032
It's something lovely
for her to remember all her life,

659
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,865
and something for us to remember, too.

660
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,206
From then on, I was a dead duck.

661
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,833
You should've seen it from the back.

662
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,586
- The look on the poor man's...
- Hi, Pops.

663
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,796
Hello, darling.
I'm sorry we're so late getting home.

664
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,341
- We had a very busy day.
- Pops, just wait until you see these.

665
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,302
Delilah, did the dress come for me today?

666
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,755
There were six or seven packages.
I left them upstairs.

667
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,473
Pops, wait till you see this one.

668
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,675
How about I show you these slippers?
They were such a bargain.

669
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,721
Yes, darling, look, if you could let
the clothes carnival go for a minute.

670
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,355
- Have you got the list yet?
- The list?

671
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,183
Yeah, the list. I have to have it
to give Miss Bellamy at the office.

672
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,814
She has to get the order in for
the invitations and the announcements.

673
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,194
Aren't these pretty?

674
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,654
- The list, darling. Have you got the list?
- Yes, I have it right here in my bag.

675
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,531
The bag is here. Here's the bag.

676
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,663
Look, Stanley, isn't that lovely?

677
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,456
That's what the bridesmaids
are going to wear.

678
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,622
- Aren't you afraid of the cops?
- It should give the idea of spring,

679
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,128
of wood nymphs and glades.

680
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,586
- Like the girl on the White Rock bottle.
- Here's the list.

681
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,795
- Kay, Kay!
- Two...

682
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,049
- Kay? Kay? Hi. Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

683
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,723
- Kay, what did you get today?
- Come up, see my new evening dress.

684
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,057
"Two spectator sports suits,
one spectator sport..."

685
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,272
This is no list.
This is something to do about clothes.

686
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,778
"Two country suits, trousers,
suit and shoes to match.

687
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,780
"Two town suits, trousers, shoes to match.

688
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,737
"Two afternoon dresses,
shoes, bags to match.

689
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,573
"Evening dress, shoes and bags to match.
Jewelry to match.

690
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,410
"One hostess dress, four negligees,
hats, furs, six snuggeries,

691
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,915
"raincoat, a dozen slippers..."

692
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,621
- What is this?
- Wrong list.

693
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,289
- It's her trousseau.
- Her trousseau?

694
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,420
- Is she going to get all that?
- Of course, dear.

695
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,674
- But her closets are bulging already.
- She can't wear those old things.

696
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,253
Darling, you know what "trousseau" means?
It's from the French.

697
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,550
It means a little bundle that the bride
carries under her arm to her new home.

698
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,931
How sweet. I've got good news for you.
The church is free.

699
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,938
The church is...
Well, I'm glad something's free.

700
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,316
I mean it's available on the 10th of June.

701
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,101
You mean we pay for the church?

702
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,737
There were some telephone messages.
I left them on your desk.

703
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,489
A man called about doing the flowers
for the church and the reception,

704
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,408
and Mrs. Gibbons
left the name of her dressmaker,

705
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,031
- and the candid cameraman called...
- Candid cameraman?

706
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,282
- Thanks, Delilah. I'll look at them later.
- The candid cameraman?

707
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,074
Ben!

708
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,869
How do I look?

709
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,374
If you take your hands out of your pocket,

710
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,585
I could tell. Come down, let me see.

711
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,253
Turn around.

712
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,422
Oh, it fits perfectly. That reminds me.

713
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,424
I've got to get yours
out of that trunk in the attic.

714
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,297
- Like it, Pop?
- What are you doing?

715
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,133
- Are you getting a trousseau, too?
- Didn't we tell you?

716
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,851
- Buckley asked Ben to be his best man.
- Oh, he did, huh? $150?

717
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,978
Why didn't he pick on
one of his own friends?

718
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,067
I thought it was swell of him.
I hardly know the guy.

719
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,815
It's only two syllables
from Banks to bankruptcy.

720
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,827
Hello? The what?

721
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,660
- An orchestra? You got the wrong number.
- Wait, Stanley.

722
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,833
Hello, are you the orchestra
Mrs. Parkman recommended?

723
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,666
How many of you are there?
That sounds very nice.

724
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,420
The 10th of June.
I'll be hearing from you then. Goodbye.

725
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,255
Stanley, from now on,
don't answer the phone.

726
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,088
- An orchestra? Are you out of your head?
- For the reception, darling.

727
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,928
We have to have some music,
and it only costs $85.

728
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,848
Oh, only $85? Oh, only $85?

729
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,433
What are people gonna say
when I'm in the gutter

730
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,190
because I tried to put on a wedding
like a Roman emperor?

731
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,524
While my secretary went over
the list of wedding guests,

732
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,188
I went over the bills.

733
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,408
Yeah.

734
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,868
Before I order the invitations,
I thought you ought to know

735
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,829
how many people Mrs. Banks is asking.

736
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,703
- A hundred?
- 572.

737
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,877
572? There must be some mistake.

738
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,834
Of course, Mrs. Banks doesn't mean
to ask them all to the reception,

739
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,753
only 280 of them.

740
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,637
The rest just get asked to the church.

741
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,052
Only 280 come to the house?

742
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,018
The house won't hold 280 people.

743
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:02,475
I was talking to our accountant.
He's married off four daughters.

744
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,813
He breaks each of his wedding guests
down into units,

745
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,569
reception units and church units.

746
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:11,362
Each reception unit includes
the cost of champagne, caterers,

747
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,069
- tips, flowers, extra insurance...
- Insurance?

748
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,447
Oh, breakage and fire, cigarette burns,
that sort of thing.

749
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,661
Broken down that way, he said the cost
of each reception unit comes to $3.75.

750
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,631
- A couple?
- A head.

751
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,089
$3.75 a head?

752
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,143
Thank you, Miss Bellamy, and good night.

753
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,480
$3.75 a head.

754
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,602
I want to tell you one thing,
there are going to be 150 people

755
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,395
invited to this house for the reception
and not one more.

756
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,656
I don't care how many
you invite to the church,

757
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,441
pack them in,
build a grandstand if you want to,

758
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,610
but the 151 st person
who comes into this house

759
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,995
is going to be thrown out on his neck.

760
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,949
They're not my friends.
I wanted a small wedding.

761
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,123
Stanley, there are loads and loads of
people you just can't ask to the church.

762
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,502
They'd be insulted.

763
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,004
It's no longer a question
of insulting people.

764
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,506
This is a question of survival.

765
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,833
Now come on, let's put an "x"
next to the names of the people

766
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,303
we have to absolutely invite
to the reception, we throw the rest out.

767
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,925
Come on now, let's get to work.

768
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,298
I can't be any help.

769
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,759
I've already cut my list
absolutely to the bone.

770
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,096
Here's someone, the Sandways.
We never see them anyway.

771
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,103
As for that woman with the dyed hair,
I don't care if I ever see her again.

772
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,982
Harry Sandway just happens to be one
of the best friends I have in the world,

773
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,359
besides being one of my very best clients.

774
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,565
Oh, Pops, a client.

775
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:39,112
Harry Sandway would go to the ends
of the earth for me, and I for Harry.

776
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,080
What about cutting down a little bit
on this Garden Club of yours?

777
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,919
We could get along without them.

778
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,508
Stanley, we have to ask them.
They're running me for president.

779
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,882
Oh, I thought a wedding
was supposed to be a joyous occasion.

780
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,840
This is a business convention.

781
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,641
- What's the matter with her?
- She's nervous.

782
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,847
All women are nervous.

783
00:46:20,602 --> 00:46:22,630
Yes? Come in.

784
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,624
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.

785
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,085
I'm sorry about the way I acted.

786
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,295
That's all right.
It's my fault. I was a little tough.

787
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,587
We're all unstrung
by this wedding business.

788
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,710
All this fuss and worry.

789
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,472
I never wanted anything like this.
I just wanted a small wedding.

790
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,679
That's what we all wanted,
but it kind of got out of hand, didn't it?

791
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,557
All this money. I feel horribly.

792
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,937
- You know, kitten, I had an idea.
- What is it?

793
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,603
I don't know if it's any good or not,
but I thought...

794
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:58,195
I was wondering,
if I gave you and Buckley about $1,500,

795
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,156
how would you like to elope?

796
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:03,492
Elope?

797
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,658
Yeah, you know, tomorrow
or the next day you run off somewhere...

798
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,203
Pops, eloping, sneaking off
and getting married,

799
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,750
I'd feel sort of, well,
as if something were wrong.

800
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,344
As if you didn't like Buckley
and didn't want me to marry him.

801
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,972
- Oh, kitten, I don't think it would...
- To get married by the justice of peace

802
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,973
in some dirty little office
with you and Moms not there?

803
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,062
I don't know, Pops, but...

804
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,433
I don't think I'd feel as if
I were really getting married.

805
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,732
- Well, it was just an idea.
- Stanley.

806
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,239
Forget about... I'm coming, Ellie.

807
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,943
- Pops, if you're worried about the money...
- No. Just forget all about it.

808
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,778
Forget I ever mentioned it. Forget it.

809
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,116
Stanley, you've just got to help me.

810
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,122
I'm going crazy
trying to cut this thing down.

811
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,282
Take Bob and Betty, for instance.

812
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,575
If we ask them, we have to ask the Dixons.

813
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,460
If we ask the Dixons,
we have to have the Warners.

814
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,044
Mother, let's call the whole thing off.
Let's not have the wedding.

815
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,504
- Kay, what are you talking about?
- Buckley and I could run off.

816
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,792
- We could elope.
- Elope?

817
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,638
Look, I told you that I didn't want you to
talk about that eloping nonsense anymore.

818
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,799
Now stop it. Stop it. The poor kid.

819
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,717
She's worried,
afraid I'm spending too much money.

820
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,139
Kay, you wouldn't do that.

821
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,054
You wouldn't elope.
Why, it would break my heart.

822
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,440
- Why, of course she wouldn't.
- But Pops, you...

823
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,565
Now I've heard all about this I care to
hear. Stop it. Stop it, really.

824
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,152
Look, we're not going to
cut these down at all.

825
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,484
Not cut them down at all.
We're going to invite all of them.

826
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,785
- Oh, Stanley, can we afford it?
- Of course we can afford it!

827
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,663
After all, what is money for
if it isn't to give my daughter

828
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,699
the finest wedding that's ever...

829
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,493
What are you trying to do,
get me in trouble?

830
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,509
Ellie had dug up
one of those little caterers.

831
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:44,301
He was willing to take the whole
reception over and take us over, too.

832
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,016
This has been a very successful cake.

833
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,435
We made that for Brenda Santanya.

834
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,138
You know, the daughter
of the Princess Schwazese,

835
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,853
- by her second husband.
- Yes, the Princess.

836
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,976
- Delightful person, isn't she?
- Yes, charming.

837
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,438
This is another we made for
the Stoppenshutts for their nuptials.

838
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,614
- Do you like that, Mrs...
- Banks.

839
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,201
Perhaps I better get your name
and the date first.

840
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,238
- Will you step over here, please?
- Ellie, Ellie, Ellie.

841
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,997
Just for the cake.

842
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,375
Will you sit here, please?

843
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,382
- Now, then...
- Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Banks.

844
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,548
24 Maple Drive, Fairview Manor.

845
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,140
- And the wedding is June 10th.
- June 10th. Very good.

846
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,435
- Now, about the reception.
- We're not having a large one, I'm afraid.

847
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,351
Small and sedate. I understand perfectly.

848
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,024
And we don't want a cake.

849
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,235
- What, you don't want a cake?
- No.

850
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,200
- Why?
- I think cakes are cheap.

851
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,985
Every Tom, Dick and Harry has one.
We don't want one.

852
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,992
I understand perfectly.

853
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,703
It's true that very select weddings
no longer have them,

854
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,751
but for the ordinary run of people
we have to show them.

855
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,829
Now, um, about the food, let's see.

856
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,001
What about a large salmon
at either end of the table?

857
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,420
With salads in great bowls in the center?

858
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,262
Another very dramatic arrangement is
cold sturgeon in the middle of the table.

859
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,935
Now, for the ices, we pride ourselves
on a very special effect,

860
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,889
with colored lights embedded...

861
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,599
We didn't intend on having
that kind of a reception.

862
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,319
What did you have in mind, madam?

863
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,902
Well, we thought we'd have
some assorted sandwiches,

864
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:34,453
different kinds, you know.
And some ice cream and little cakes.

865
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,744
Of course you can have
just what you wish, madam,

866
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,751
but that's what we usually serve
for children's parties.

867
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,419
That's what we want.

868
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:48,638
This 24 Maple Drive.
Is it a club or a country estate?

869
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,223
It's our home.

870
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,313
- What attendance are you anticipating?
- About 250.

871
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,521
- Is it a large house?
- No, it's a small house.

872
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,024
Oh, then, of course, you'll be planning
for a marquee on the terrace.

873
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,901
- This, for instance.
- We don't happen to have a terrace.

874
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,492
If they overflow the house,
they can tramp around out on the lawn.

875
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,654
I tell you what I'll do.

876
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,661
I'll get one of our field engineers
to go over the property.

877
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,747
We always have to do that anyway.

878
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,840
The next Saturday, I finally
got around to trying on my old cutaway.

879
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,849
Ellie!

880
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,732
- Ellie!
- Yes, dear?

881
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,653
- Ellie, look, look, look!
- What is it?

882
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,032
- I'm in it.
- Well, well.

883
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,207
Not so bad, huh? A little snug.

884
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,251
Maybe I can... Maybe I could take off
a pound or two before the wedding.

885
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,090
Are you standing naturally?

886
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,469
You look as though you might have been
strapped up by a surgeon.

887
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,642
I was wondering...
Do you think you ought to get a new one?

888
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,974
- I mean, with Ben getting a new one...
- Oh, nonsense!

889
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,107
What are you talking about?
I've only worn this thing twice.

890
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,812
- Stanley...
- Do you realize that most men

891
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,899
couldn't even get into their cutaway
after 20 years?

892
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,069
If that button gives way
it's going to put out somebody's eye.

893
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,490
You know, sometimes
they wear them unbuttoned.

894
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,205
Ah. I kind of like it unbuttoned,
don't you?

895
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,832
Like it better that way.

896
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,668
Just wait, just wait.

897
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,331
Wait till I have this thing
let out just a little.

898
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,167
You'll be surprised. You wait and see.

899
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,134
Oh, Stanley, I want you to look at these.

900
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,850
Aren't they lovely?
They're Kay's presents to the bridesmaids.

901
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,886
You'd never dream they cost only $15,
would you?

902
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,896
- $15?
- And this is what she's giving Buckley.

903
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,649
She's giving...
She's giving that to Buckley?

904
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,436
The bride always gives the groom
a present.

905
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,447
Stanley, that reminds me, can you arrange
to meet me in town again on Saturday?

906
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,526
We just have to pick out the flat silver
if we're going to get it marked in time.

907
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,535
- The what?
- Kay's flat silver. The table silver.

908
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,573
Now you know perfectly well we give
Kay the flat silver and the linen...

909
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:47,035
Yes, yes, yes, I know. What does
Buckley's family give, just Buckley?

910
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,501
Just Buckley.

911
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,999
- Mom?
- Yes, dear?

912
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,627
There's a Mr. Massoula and
another guy downstairs to see you.

913
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,667
That's the fellow with the cake.

914
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,821
- Say, come here.
- What's wrong?

915
00:55:01,455 --> 00:55:05,953
I just happened to think, you're going
to get married pretty soon, aren't you?

916
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,057
And then it'll be my turn,
my turn to present you

917
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:13,144
to the father of the bride
as my one and only contribution.

918
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,229
- I feel better, son.
- Stanley.

919
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,775
An experienced caterer

920
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,869
can make you ashamed
of your house in 15 minutes.

921
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,035
Ellie was on the verge of tears.

922
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,579
These doors, they'll have to be
taken off and stored.

923
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,712
You'd be surprised how much circulation
you lose on account of doors,

924
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,006
especially doors like that.

925
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,639
All I know is you can't get
more than 125 in the house.

926
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,600
Squash them in
like a lot of bugs if you did.

927
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:50,018
We were planning to take some
of this furniture upstairs into the attic.

928
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,270
Yes, we were going to take up
the small chairs

929
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,275
and the small tables
and the standing lamp,

930
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,027
and we were even thinking
of taking up the rug.

931
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,235
Taking up the rug, lady,
ain't going to give us any more room.

932
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,576
- Have you any suggestions?
- Yes, madam, I have.

933
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,162
Even with the marquee out there,
you're going to be cramped.

934
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,247
Joe, go out in the back
and measure for that marquee.

935
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,615
Right.

936
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,577
You see, madam,
circulation is your big problem.

937
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,956
Now, the first thing you've got to do
is clear this room of all furniture.

938
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,632
- You mean the settee and the armchairs...
- And the piano.

939
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,131
And in the dining room,
the same thing, too.

940
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,555
What do you think I have upstairs,
a cold storage warehouse?

941
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,799
I have an attic that's full now.

942
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,185
I suggest you do
what our other clients do.

943
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,971
Hire a moving van to take the things out
before the reception

944
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:34,312
and bring them back when it's over.
Now, the marquee.

945
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,480
Um, we'll attach the marquee
to this French door.

946
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,485
It's stuck. It's stuck.

947
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,317
I'll say it is.

948
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,074
Yes, I've been meaning to get it fixed.

949
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,577
Doesn't matter.
They've got to come off anyway.

950
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,951
It's really quite simple.
All you have to do is push...

951
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:56,001
Look, you stop! Stop! Just stand still.

952
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,021
I decided after all I might
as well get a new cutaway.

953
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,862
Every mail brought a new terror.

954
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,571
- The Cramptons are coming.
- Uh-huh.

955
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,787
The Lewises, the Quincy Browns
and the Gaylords.

956
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,578
Apparently Kay picked a day
for her wedding

957
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,711
when nobody within 400 miles
has got anything to do.

958
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,042
- Oh, how nice.
- Somebody refuse?

959
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,839
No, the Whiteheads were asked
to another wedding

960
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,966
and gave it up to come to ours.
Isn't that sweet?

961
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,547
How nice... The Whiteheads?

962
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,512
They live in Pittsburgh.

963
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,219
What crust, coming all the way
from Pittsburgh.

964
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,518
Moms! Pops! Look, I got a present!

965
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,851
A wedding present! Look, a tray.

966
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,732
A lovely hand-painted tray. Delilah!

967
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,152
Delilah, come and see.
Look, I've got a present.

968
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,022
We were not accustomed to such bounty.

969
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,404
The idea anyone should actually go out
and purchase a gift with hard money

970
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,864
filled us with tender gratitude.

971
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:14,367
For a few days, it looked as if this
might be the last as well as the first,

972
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,410
but then they began to come in.

973
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,581
A thin trickle at first,
then more and more.

974
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,605
Given enough ointment,
there's always a fly.

975
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:48,450
Given enough presents,
there's bound to be a stinker.

976
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,742
- Who sent that?
- "With love from Aunt Hattie."

977
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,962
- Aunt Hattie.
- Kay was expecting a nice, fat check.

978
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,583
When I think of all the guff
I've taken from that old...

979
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,965
- What are we going to do with it?
- Would you really like me to tell you?

980
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,380
You could always drop it.

981
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,345
Oh, Kay! Kay, come take a look
at what Aunt Hattie sent you.

982
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,761
- Yeah.
- You can send it back.

983
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,688
Darling, no one would take that back
once they got rid of it.

984
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,313
You can send them all back.
The wedding's off.

985
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,228
Kay, what are you saying?

986
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,529
Just that. I'm not going to marry Buckley.

987
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,654
I found out something about him
that's unforgivable.

988
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,578
- What could have happened?
- I don't know.

989
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:41,537
Ellie, let me go to her.

990
00:59:47,936 --> 00:59:49,451
Kitten?

991
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,772
Please, Pops, it's no use talking.

992
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,356
I'm not going to talk, honey.

993
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,351
I just wanted to tell you
everything's all right.

994
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,362
Whatever you choose to do,
it's okay with us, you know.

995
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:09,944
Thank you, Pops.

996
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,251
You know,

997
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:26,374
you always used to talk about
taking a little trip to Europe.

998
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,458
Why don't I fix that up tomorrow?

999
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,551
You could take
one of your friends with you.

1000
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,214
Oh, Pops, I couldn't.

1001
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,933
Not after all you've been through.

1002
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,144
All this horrible expense and everything.

1003
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,805
Oh, heavens, that doesn't matter.

1004
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:45,567
Nothing matters, except your happiness.

1005
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,773
We can arrange everything.

1006
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,397
We'll make some excuse,
say that you're ill or something.

1007
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,235
We'll send back the presents,
notify the people...

1008
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,201
Aw, don't.

1009
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:07,422
Oh, he should have told me before.
He shouldn't have kept it from me.

1010
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,341
He had this thing come out of the blue.

1011
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,342
There, there, there. Don't cry, kitten.

1012
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,924
Nova Scotia for our honeymoon.

1013
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,930
A camp in Nova Scotia,

1014
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,855
so he can fish for some
horrible salmon or something.

1015
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,272
He knew I bought millions
of evening clothes and things.

1016
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,692
That didn't matter to him. Oh, no.

1017
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:35,784
He loves to go fishing,
so he decides we're going fishing.

1018
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,280
Well, after all...

1019
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,625
What do you mean?

1020
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,164
Well, I mean, I thought it was
something even worse than that,

1021
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,624
maybe like another girl or something.

1022
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,838
A girl wouldn't be so bad.

1023
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,297
At least you can get your teeth in a girl.

1024
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,761
But this, this is our whole life.
It's our whole future.

1025
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,099
If he's just this selfish now, so mean
when it's a question of our honeymoon,

1026
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,435
what's he gonna be like
after we're married?

1027
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,151
- Had you talked it over?
- Of course we had.

1028
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,447
I told him I wanted to go
someplace romantic,

1029
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:22,493
but he said there was nothing as romantic
as a fishing shack in Nova Scotia.

1030
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,707
We had a horrible fight.

1031
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,789
I said terrible things to him.

1032
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,675
And he called me a spoiled brat.

1033
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,964
I made him stop the car,
and I jumped out and left him right there.

1034
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,099
Buckley's here.

1035
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,686
The poor boy's stricken.
He looks terrible.

1036
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,027
- Will you see him?
- No.

1037
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,825
I never saw anyone who was suffering so.

1038
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,744
He'll get over it.

1039
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,386
- Good evening, sir.
- Won't see you, Buckley.

1040
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,050
- If I could speak to her...
- It's no use, son.

1041
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,015
Will you tell her that I'm sorry,
that she's right about the whole thing?

1042
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,065
I was selfish and pigheaded.
I didn't realize. I should have asked her.

1043
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,443
I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything.
Just tell her that I'm sorry.

1044
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,237
I'd give anything to take back
what I said. Will you tell her?

1045
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:40,651
Yes, I'll tell her. I'll tell her. Yes.
Go on home, now. Pull yourself together.

1046
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,404
- What'd you do to your hand?
- Nothing!

1047
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,832
Kay slammed the car door on it.

1048
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,368
- Buckley!
- Let's get some...

1049
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:53,464
- Buckley! Darling! Oh, darling!
- Darling!

1050
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,924
- Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
- No, it was my fault.

1051
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,005
- No, it wasn't.
- Forgive me. No, it was mine.

1052
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,215
It wasn't your fault, it was mine.

1053
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,716
I was selfish and pigheaded. I was stupid.

1054
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,265
- I did act like a spoiled brat.
- I'll go anywhere you want to go.

1055
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,393
Darling, does it hurt? I'm sorry.

1056
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,846
It doesn't matter,
just as long as we're together.

1057
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,226
Anywhere you want to go.

1058
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,857
I'm sorry, darling. It was all my fault.

1059
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,477
I'll never do that again,
I promise you I won't.

1060
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:16,819
It's all right.

1061
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,906
By the time we got
to the wedding rehearsal,

1062
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,489
everyone but me
seemed to have lost interest.

1063
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,492
And to make it even worse,
it was raining cats and dogs.

1064
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,410
Now, you have to take the bride's party.

1065
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:31,289
You're the only one who knows
the Banks family and where to put them.

1066
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,789
Now, the usher for the groom
is Edward Owen. Edward Owen.

1067
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,420
He couldn't come tonight, Mr. Banks,
but I'll see him tomorrow.

1068
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,593
- Oh, he couldn't come tonight, huh?
- No, sir.

1069
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:41,795
Great.

1070
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,093
Now, boys and girls, listen.

1071
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:48,377
Now I'm sure that you want this
to come off perfect in every detail...

1072
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,853
God bless you. Just as I do.

1073
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,432
So, what we're going to do
is just stick here tonight

1074
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,646
until we get it right,
even if it takes all night.

1075
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,980
Kay, it's about time.

1076
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,982
- I'm sorry.
- Where's Buckley?

1077
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,150
I just got through
talking to him on the phone.

1078
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,035
He said he'd try to be here
as soon as he could.

1079
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,951
- He'd try to be here?
- What do you say we start rehearsing?

1080
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:12,117
- Good evening.
- The bridegroom isn't here.

1081
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,830
Half of the wedding party isn't here.

1082
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,246
Half of the wedding party never is here.
It's quite all right.

1083
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,795
We can't very well go on
without the minister.

1084
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,500
It doesn't matter. I take the rehearsal.

1085
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,510
Everything will be all right.
Just don't worry.

1086
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,046
Now come on, boys and girls,
take your places.

1087
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:27,512
Shouldn't you be up front?
Why don't you go?

1088
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,468
Come on, let's get going.

1089
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,353
Pops, the bride never rehearses.
It's bad luck.

1090
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,144
Ben, there's no reason
why you shouldn't rehearse.

1091
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,858
Come on, get up front.

1092
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,439
- Who's this?
- He belongs up at the altar here.

1093
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,359
Yes, of course. Up at the altar.

1094
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,946
Get back there. Two girls in front.

1095
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:48,829
You go over here, and you there.
There, that's right.

1096
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:52,123
Now then, now we want a bride.
You'll do for the bride.

1097
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,039
You come over here,
take Mr. Banks' arm like that.

1098
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,834
- We won't need that.
- It'll be fine tomorrow, I'm sure.

1099
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,254
Go right back, please, Mr. Banks.
There we are.

1100
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:06,885
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- There, that's fine.

1101
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,887
All right, then.
Now then, as for the simple step.

1102
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,972
The simple step you have to do
is perfectly easy.

1103
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,516
You'll all get the hang of it.
Just watch me.

1104
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,431
Girls, watch me very carefully.

1105
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:20,102
Step, stop, and step, stop.

1106
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,479
Step, stop, and... See, that's all it is.

1107
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,530
That's all there is to it.
This is perfectly easy, isn't it?

1108
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,316
Now then, boys,
when I give you the word "go",

1109
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,573
start off with the right foot.
All right, Fritz. Fritz!

1110
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,999
Now then, right... Don't hesitate.

1111
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,414
Just an ordinary walk,
just a dignified walk.

1112
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,505
Come on, get a move on. Little faster.
That's right. Come on, come on.

1113
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,129
Another boy with you there.
Come on, girls.

1114
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,343
When I tell you to go.
Listen to the music.

1115
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,429
Now... Wait, wait. Right foot.

1116
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,308
Are you by yourself? Come on, here.

1117
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,103
Come on, get a move on. Go.

1118
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,694
- It's all going too fast.
- Now the bride and the father.

1119
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:10,810
Now, the right foot, Mr. Banks.
The right foot. Here we go.

1120
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,699
- Never mind that. Right foot.
- All right, all right.

1121
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,284
The right foot first, please.

1122
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,123
It's quite simple,
it is really simple, Mr. Banks.

1123
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,336
Good heavens! What's going on up there?
What are you doing here?

1124
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,639
- I'm the best man.
- The best man has got to be by the altar.

1125
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,725
Now, then, boys and girls,
each side of the aisle.

1126
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,478
No, boys over there.
Bridesmaids, that's right.

1127
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,935
Come on, over here. The boys on the right.

1128
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,601
There you are. That's right.

1129
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,395
You really must practice
at home, Mr. Banks.

1130
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,940
Come on, there we are. That's right.
You stay there.

1131
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,325
Now, then. So, so, so-so-so, so-so.

1132
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,987
Then after "Who giveth?" "I do."
Then you go back and join Mrs. Banks.

1133
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:57,407
No, you back gracefully.
Doesn't matter which foot first.

1134
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,828
Then you slide in. That's right.
When the ceremony's over,

1135
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,588
the bridegroom takes the bride
down the aisle.

1136
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,341
- I'll be the bridegroom.
- Where are you going?

1137
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,973
Then you take the lady of honor...
She's gone now.

1138
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,719
She'll be here tomorrow.

1139
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,268
Each bridesmaid takes an usher,
and away you go.

1140
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,350
That's right. That's right.

1141
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,935
You got it? Yes, you've got it. Splendid.

1142
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,192
Yes, you be here tomorrow.

1143
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:28,480
Now, let's get down to brass tacks
and have a real good rehearsal.

1144
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,658
- But I thought it was fine.
- Fine? That was a rat race.

1145
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,781
Well, you should've...

1146
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,499
All through, I see.
That means that I'm just in time, eh?

1147
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,377
I'm so sorry, I had a meeting.
Tringle here is an old hand.

1148
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,210
- They all know their stuff, Tringle?
- Oh, good, good.

1149
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:50,172
I'm sure everything will go smoothly
and be a beautiful wedding.

1150
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,344
Now, if you'll forgive me,
I have a meeting.

1151
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,469
Just a moment, Reverend Galsworthy.
We haven't had a rehearsal.

1152
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,804
The groom isn't here.

1153
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:00,587
Oh, the groom isn't very important,
is he, my dear?

1154
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,648
You're not nervous, are you, my dear?
She's not nervous.

1155
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,479
Have your young man
call me in the morning.

1156
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,854
I'll put him through his paces.
Now, I must run.

1157
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,192
I hate to, but I must.

1158
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,990
Don't worry, because everything
will go beautifully tomorrow.

1159
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,947
I know. I've done it before.

1160
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,403
Good luck, my dear.
Such a beautiful bride.

1161
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,039
I'm sure you'll be very happy. Goodbye.

1162
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,373
Chaos.

1163
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,247
Don't worry, darling.
You'll have Kay with you.

1164
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,963
She's been a bridesmaid so many times
she could walk up the aisle blindfolded.

1165
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,261
Absolute complete chaos.

1166
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,897
When I finally got to sleep that night,
I dreamed of the wedding.

1167
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,195
I was late.

1168
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,611
Somehow I couldn't seem to move my feet.

1169
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,503
Hi, Pops.

1170
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,552
What are you doing here?

1171
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,014
I couldn't sleep. What are you doing?

1172
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,641
I was hungry.

1173
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,323
Pops, I know I'm a fool,

1174
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:02,865
but if I tell you something,
you won't think I'm silly, will you?

1175
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,284
Of course not, kitten.
What's bothering you?

1176
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,250
I'm scared, Pops. Scared to death.

1177
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:15,089
Why, what are you scared of?
There's nothing to be scared of.

1178
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:18,297
- Marriage is the most normal thing...
- Oh, I know, Pops.

1179
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:22,051
I'm not scared of marriage.
It's much sillier than that.

1180
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,592
See, it's this way.

1181
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:29,558
You know how I wanted a simple wedding,
out in the country somewhere.

1182
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,811
Well, that's out.
We don't live in the country, period.

1183
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,936
But this thing's gotten bigger
and bigger and bigger.

1184
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,023
I know it's ungrateful of me.

1185
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,784
Sometimes it scares
the living daylights out of me.

1186
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,577
You mean, walking down the aisle, huh?

1187
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:52,711
Yeah. Every time I think about it,
I break into a cold sweat.

1188
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:57,215
Suppose my knees got shaking
just as I started.

1189
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,794
Suppose they shook
till finally they let me down entirely,

1190
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,472
you had to drag me down the aisle
like a sack of meal.

1191
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,645
We could always take a short snort
just before the show begins.

1192
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,104
Oh, Pops.

1193
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,521
Now, look, kitten.
Get this into your head.

1194
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,608
There is nothing to worry about.
Not a thing.

1195
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,984
Whenever you've been bothered,
I've always been around, haven't I?

1196
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,112
I'll be around when
that Wedding March starts, too.

1197
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:33,456
All you have to do is take my arm
and lean against me and relax.

1198
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,416
I'll do the rest.

1199
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,790
Oh, you are wonderful.

1200
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,427
Nothing ever fazes you, does it?

1201
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,270
The day of the wedding dawned at last.

1202
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,524
Haven't you got this stuff
out of here yet?

1203
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,526
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were
in a hurry. We were just relaxing.

1204
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,779
The quicker you get it out
the better off we'll all be.

1205
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,283
No flowers! Take them out of here!

1206
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:08,327
Hold it, hold it! Hello?

1207
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,289
Hello, Aunt Hattie!

1208
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,872
Well, Aunt Hattie.
Yes, this is the day, Aunt Hattie.

1209
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,046
Sorry you couldn't make it.
What? Oh, you're here.

1210
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,171
- Well, yeah. Just a minute.
- From Aunt Hattie.

1211
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,219
Where are you, Aunt Hattie?
Where? At the depot?

1212
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,427
Oh, Ben! Ben, Ben. Thank you.

1213
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,392
Aunt Hattie's down at the depot.
Take the car and go down and get her.

1214
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:38,182
Oh, I can't, Pop. I gotta collect
Buckley's things and bring them here.

1215
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:41,523
I thought it was understood that your
domestic staff is to stay out of the kitchen.

1216
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,859
My domestic staff is getting me
a bicarbonate of soda.

1217
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,280
Make your choice.

1218
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,901
Wedding banquet or bicarbonate of soda,
you can't have both.

1219
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:51,079
Aunt Hattie. Hello? Hello, Aunt Hattie.

1220
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,321
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1221
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,412
- If you'll just wait outside the station...
- Mr. Banks, where's Kay?

1222
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,618
- I've got to see her right away.
- Upstairs, upstairs.

1223
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,504
Somebody will pick you up. Yes. Yes.

1224
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,299
Tommy! Aunt Hattie is down at the station.

1225
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,302
Forget it, Pop. I can't.
I gotta borrow a white shirt.

1226
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,213
Hello, Joe.

1227
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,683
- What are you trying to do, trip me up?
- I'm sorry, sorry.

1228
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,895
Joe? Joe? Take the pipe lane,
turn off at Durand.

1229
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:19,186
- Yeah. Follow Durand for two miles...
- Why don't you look where you're going?

1230
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,105
Do you want this stuff moved out
or don't you?

1231
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,481
- Yeah, of course, I do.
- Then tell this guy to keep his pots...

1232
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,487
Ask at the gas station!

1233
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,406
I'll tell you what you can do...

1234
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,444
- We've been here...
- Why don't you wait with your pots?

1235
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,866
And let all these ferns and things
wilt out there in that sun?

1236
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,409
You know how much these things cost?

1237
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,825
You're not buying this stuff, Mac,
you're just renting it.

1238
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:40,788
How do you like the nerve of this guy?
There's your boss! He's my boss, too!

1239
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,455
Gangway...

1240
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,005
Gangway!

1241
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,971
By 3:00, I was dressed.

1242
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:02,816
I took the precaution
of wearing a belt and suspenders.

1243
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:07,445
Ellie.

1244
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,783
Ellie, do you know what time it is?
Quarter past 4:00.

1245
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,444
We should be there right now. Hurry up.

1246
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,657
Where's this automobile?

1247
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,165
Well, I'll be a...

1248
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,839
Hello? Hello?

1249
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,926
Operator, will you get me
Jake's Garage, please?

1250
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:33,844
Well, keep on trying, will you? Please?

1251
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:39,020
We've got a wedding
and no way to get to the church. No cars.

1252
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:43,308
- Will you do that? Thanks very much.
- Don't worry, darling.

1253
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,819
There's one thing we know,
they can't start without us.

1254
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,690
I knew I'd never be able to
remember what Ellie wore that day.

1255
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,239
But I also knew I'd never forget
the way she looked

1256
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,738
with all the beauty
of her own wedding day on her.

1257
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,205
Ellie.

1258
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,499
- Ellie, you look...
- Thank you, darling.

1259
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,040
You don't have to say another word.

1260
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,220
You have no right to look like this.
It isn't fair to the bride.

1261
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,682
Hello? Hello? Is this Jake's Garage?

1262
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,851
What? Holy smoke,
Aunt Hattie, where are you?

1263
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,892
They're here, the cars are here.
Never mind.

1264
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,565
- Kay, Delilah, the cars are here.
- Just a minute.

1265
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,946
It's Aunt Hattie. She's been
at the station all morning,

1266
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,490
wants to know how to get to the church.

1267
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,317
We'll take the first car.
You follow with Kay.

1268
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,574
Ellie, Ellie! What am I gonna tell her?
This is your relative.

1269
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,200
Tell her to jump in a lake.

1270
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:41,624
Aunt Hattie, go outside the station,
there's a lake...

1271
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:45,411
There's some taxis out there. Take one,
go to the church. I'll pay for it later.

1272
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,626
All right, Aunt Hattie. All right.

1273
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,674
Kay! Kay, you know what time it is?

1274
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,930
- Kay, Kay, Kay, it's 4:20.
- I'm ready. Come in.

1275
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,516
She looked like the princess
in a fairy tale.

1276
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:08,143
I wouldn't have been surprised
if she'd held out her hand for me to kiss.

1277
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:16,109
You're wonderful, kitten. Just wonderful.

1278
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,537
Thanks, Pops.

1279
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:25,831
- Well, on to the slaughter.
- Yeah. This is it, isn't it?

1280
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:30,877
- All right. Take this, your bouquet.
- Thanks, Pops.

1281
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,133
Thanks. Thanks. Goodbye.

1282
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,224
- Hello, I'm Duffy, the candid cameraman.
- You just store that thing.

1283
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:55,193
Here they are.

1284
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,721
Kay! She's beautiful!

1285
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,396
Ushers, come on. All the ushers.
Quickly, come.

1286
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,895
Remember, right foot forward. Go.

1287
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,035
Bridesmaids, come on. Take your place.

1288
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:43,370
Now, Mr. Banks, this is the Wedding March.

1289
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,245
Get ready.

1290
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:51,329
Right, stop. Left, stop.

1291
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,637
Well, Pops, we're off.

1292
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:07,808
Get ready.
Remember, the right foot forward.

1293
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,889
Right foot. Right.

1294
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,225
Right. Right.

1295
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,154
Right.

1296
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,820
Hold it, Pops.

1297
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,020
Kay overwhelmed me.

1298
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,106
She waited for the proper moment
with the calmness of a general

1299
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,602
watching his forces deploy into battle.

1300
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,355
Buckley, on the other hand,
had the haggard look

1301
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,700
of a man who had just completed
a dangerous bombing mission.

1302
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:04,951
Ready?

1303
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,846
Dearly beloved,

1304
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,678
we are gathered together here
in the sight of God

1305
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,468
and in the face of this company

1306
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,353
to join together this man and this woman

1307
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,231
in holy matrimony,
which is an honorable estate,

1308
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,518
instituted of God, signifying unto us

1309
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:22,109
the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his church.

1310
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:25,820
All I could think of
was the part I had to play.

1311
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:27,951
I knew I had a cue coming.

1312
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,989
When the Reverend Galsworthy
got to the place where he asked,

1313
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:34,538
"Who giveth this woman?"
I had to say "I do."

1314
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:37,661
It was my only line in the show
and I wanted to get it right.

1315
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,880
Then I was supposed
to drop back a step, turn,

1316
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,875
and join Ellie in the front pew.

1317
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:46,007
I couldn't remember
what was immediately in my rear.

1318
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:50,349
I began to explore.
I didn't want to trip or fall.

1319
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:54,019
People are so quick to attribute
such things to alcohol.

1320
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,390
While I was still exploring, it was on me.

1321
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:00,563
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

1322
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,311
I do.

1323
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,452
"Who giveth this woman?"

1324
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,545
"This woman?"

1325
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,419
But she's not a woman,
she's still a child,

1326
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,254
and she's leaving us.

1327
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,254
What's it going to be like
to come home and not find her?

1328
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:31,974
Not to hear her voice calling,
"Hi, Pops" as I come in.

1329
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,395
I suddenly realized what I was doing.
I was giving up Kay.

1330
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,014
Something inside me began to hurt.

1331
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,809
I, Buckley Dunstan...

1332
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,069
I, Buckley Dunstan...

1333
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:48,115
- ...take thee, Katherine Banks...
- ...take thee, Katherine Banks...

1334
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:50,989
- ...to my wedded wife.
- ...to my wedded wife.

1335
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,992
- To have and to hold...
- To have and to hold...

1336
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:57,242
- ...from this day forward.
- ...from this day forward.

1337
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:08,795
- With this ring I thee wed.
- With this ring I thee wed.

1338
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,596
- In the name of the Father...
- In the name of the Father...

1339
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,674
- ...and of the Son...
- ...and of the Son...

1340
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:18,225
- ...and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
- ...and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

1341
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,520
For as much as Buckley Dunstan
and Katherine Banks

1342
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,985
have consented together in holy wedlock,

1343
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,358
I pronounce that they are man and wife

1344
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:32,030
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

1345
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:40,580
God the Father, God the Son,
God the Holy Ghost

1346
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,462
bless and preserve and keep you.

1347
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,464
The Lord mercifully
with his favor look upon you

1348
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,544
and fill you with all spiritual
benediction and grace

1349
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,591
that ye may so live together in this life

1350
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:57,180
that in the world to come
ye may have life everlasting.

1351
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,057
Amen.

1352
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,937
Now the race was on, to get back
to the house and the free champagne.

1353
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,283
The house was bursting at the seams.

1354
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,665
Everywhere I looked there were faces,
most of them I'd never seen before.

1355
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:05,627
I wondered if someone had broadcast
a general invitation by radio.

1356
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,507
The temperature under the marquee

1357
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,551
was midway between a Turkish bath
and a greenhouse.

1358
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:21,802
No one was listening to the orchestra.
Ellie could have saved that 85 bucks.

1359
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,568
The caterer was having his trouble, too.

1360
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,779
Something was wrong,
very wrong, with his circulation.

1361
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,777
Yes. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen,

1362
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,031
I must insist that you pass
through the door into the parkway. Please.

1363
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,875
But there was nothing wrong
with the waiters.

1364
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,044
The moment a person tilted a glass,

1365
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:50,293
they were waiting at his elbow
with a fresh supply.

1366
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,884
Never have I seen men
more devoted to their work.

1367
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,718
I was looking for Kay.
I still hadn't kissed the bride.

1368
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:03,849
Well, you know, Miss Cale's daughter
moved into the palace...

1369
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:06,225
Where's Kay? I can't find her.

1370
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,432
Oh, they're in the garden,
having their pictures taken.

1371
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:11,151
Stanley, first will you see
about the champagne? I'm worried.

1372
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,271
Yeah, the way they're handing it out, you'd
think they were working on the piece basis.

1373
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,315
- See about it, will you?
- All right. All right.

1374
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,993
How's the champagne holding up?

1375
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:31,375
Okay, okay, mister, don't worry.
You'll get yours.

1376
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:35,376
Edith! Edith! Hurry up!
Kay's going to throw the bouquet.

1377
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,887
Kay! Pardon, miss. Kay!

1378
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,177
I want to see this.

1379
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,860
- Where's Pops? I don't see him.
- I haven't seen him either.

1380
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,032
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

1381
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,842
Stanley, where on earth have you been?
Kay just threw her bouquet.

1382
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:24,767
Ellie, look, look, please be nice to me.
For once in your life be nice to me...

1383
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,269
No, you can't go up now.
She's changing her clothes.

1384
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,389
The reception had turned into a party.

1385
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:34,769
I was skulking around the edges,
still waiting for a chance to see Kay.

1386
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,441
They're going! They're going!
Come and get your confetti.

1387
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,154
Get out of my way, Pop!

1388
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,491
Get your confetti.

1389
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:50,580
All of you, get your confetti.
Get it while it lasts. It's going fast.

1390
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:40,088
She was gone. My Kay was gone.

1391
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,591
And I'd been too late
to say goodbye to her.

1392
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,938
When the last guest had gone,

1393
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:59,065
and the last glass of champagne had
been drunk, we surveyed the wreckage.

1394
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:03,323
I suppose we better clean up and not
leave this mess for Delilah tomorrow.

1395
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:07,319
I'll go up and change my dress.
Would you get the vacuum, darling?

1396
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,780
Hmm. Oh.

1397
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:13,788
Funny how empty a house
can suddenly get, isn't it?

1398
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,994
Oh, I'm sorry you missed
saying goodbye to her.

1399
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,495
It's all right.

1400
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:20,875
I think she's going to be happy with him.
That's the important thing, isn't it?

1401
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,671
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

1402
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,883
Ellie, look.

1403
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,521
Hello?

1404
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:42,737
Hello, kitten!

1405
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:45,319
Where are you?

1406
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,905
New York. Our train's leaving in a second,

1407
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:50,491
but I just couldn't leave
without saying goodbye to you.

1408
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:52,371
I'm coming.

1409
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:56,501
Pops, say goodbye again to Moms,
and thank her for all she did.

1410
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:00,339
And, Pops, you've been just wonderful.

1411
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,336
I love you.

1412
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,418
I love you very much.

1413
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:07,425
Goodbye, kitten.

1414
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,052
Catch a lot of fish.

1415
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:11,634
Bye-bye.

1416
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:22,065
All right now?

1417
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,738
Nothing's really changed, has it?

1418
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,406
You know what they say.

1419
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,239
My son's my son until he gets him a wife,

1420
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:37,200
but my daughter's my daughter
all of her life.

1421
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,582
All of our life.
