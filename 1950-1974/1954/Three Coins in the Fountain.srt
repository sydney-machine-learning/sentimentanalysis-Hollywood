Pardon me. Are you Maria Williams?

21
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,358
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, I'm Anita Hutchins.

22
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,447
- Hi.
- Hi.

23
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,194
Mr. Burgoyne sent me down to meet you.

24
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,445
- I'm with the agency.
- Oh.

25
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,572
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Thank you.

26
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,619
We're over here. Come on.

27
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,230
- This is your apartment?
- You like it?

28
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,316
I'm awed!

29
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,196
Secretaries live very well in Rome.

30
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,198
You'll get spoiled after a while. Frances!

31
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,449
Yes?

32
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,951
I'm having breakfast
on the balcony. Come on out.

33
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,745
- Welcome to Rome.
- Thank you.

34
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,319
Did you have any trouble finding her?

35
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,044
No. I picked her out the first try.

36
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,592
- Have you had any breakfast?
- I can't remember.

37
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,886
Then have some with us. Anna!

38
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,089
Oh, my, oh, my!

39
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,887
Oh, what a beautiful way to live.

40
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,163
I'm glad you like it.

41
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,664
When Anita leaves,
I was going to suggest...

42
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,931
- I've already told her.
- Anna. This is Miss Williams.

43
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,857
<i>Buon giorno, signorina.</i>

44
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,230
How do you do?

45
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,904
What would you like?

46
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,607
Oh, anything, thank you.

47
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,321
I don't think I could afford
anything as elegant as this,

48
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,496
or even half of it.

49
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,417
I promise you can. You're paid
at the agency in dollars.

50
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,540
The rate of exchange is in your favor.

51
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,746
- Are you with the agency too?
- No.

52
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,298
I'm John Frederick Shadwell's secretary.

53
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,384
The man who wrote <i>Winter Harvest?</i>

54
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,756
- Mm-hmm.
- No less.

55
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,338
Mm. He's a great writer, isn't he?

56
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,548
He's a great man.

57
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,967
I thought he was dead.

58
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,719
Most people do,

59
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,573
that's because he hasn't been
back to America

60
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,847
since his early 20s.

61
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,399
Frances has been with him for 15 years.

62
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,478
Gosh. Oh, when do I meet my boss?

63
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,946
After breakfast. We'll all
drive to work together.

64
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,489
You'll meet him in plenty of time.

65
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,237
There's nothing rushed in Rome.

66
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,700
Oh, I'm going to like Rome,
at any rate of exchange.

67
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,664
What's that?

68
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,314
That's the Fountain of Trevi.

69
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,838
Do you want to see it?

70
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,475
If you throw a coin into the pool,

71
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,927
you're supposed to get your wish.

72
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,396
Only the wish must always be
the same thing.

73
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,398
That you'll return again to Rome.

74
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,525
I've tossed a coin
into the fountain every April

75
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,489
for the last... 15 years.

76
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,660
It's my spring ritual.
It's time to throw one in again.

77
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,031
- Don't you want to wish?
- Oh, yes.

78
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,120
Keep me in Rome at least a year,
Mr. Fountain.

79
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,250
No! No, no.

80
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,582
You have to turn around.
Throw it over your shoulder.

81
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,838
Oh.

82
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,762
Bring me... another year of contentment,

83
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,886
whatever gods are listening.
A penny's worth of hope.

84
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,268
Aren't you going to wish?

85
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,973
No. I don't want to come back to Rome.

86
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,808
Anita's going home to be married.

87
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,485
Oh, then I don't blame you.
Don't tempt fate.

88
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,341
- Good morning, Eleanor.
- Good morning, Anita.

89
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,342
This is my desk.

90
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,469
You'll share it with me
for the time being.

91
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,930
Oh, when do I meet Mr. Burgoyne?

92
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,136
I'll see if he's in.

93
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,645
<i>Yes?</i>

94
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,892
Good morning, Mr. Burgoyne.

95
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,702
Miss Williams is here.
Shall I bring her in?

96
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,374
<i>Not at all. I'll come out.</i>

97
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,106
Boss loves to make a good impression.

98
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,438
Oh, any particular instructions?

99
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,026
No. Just be yourself.

100
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,408
Well, well, well, Miss Williams.
Welcome to U.S.D.A.

101
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,329
I abbreviate the name of the agency.

102
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,622
It's the age of the alphabet.

103
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,290
Oh, I see. Thank you.

104
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,869
We hope you like Rome
and the agency, Miss Williams.

105
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,212
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.
- Good, good, good.

106
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,581
I thought I'd spend the morning

107
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,291
showing Maria how we operate here.

108
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,173
Fine, fine, fine. Oh!

109
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,093
Mrs. Burgoyne is giving
a cocktail party this afternoon.

110
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,225
Anita, if you and Miss Williams
are not otherwise occupied,

111
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,393
Mrs. Burgoyne would like
to meet Miss Williams.

112
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,516
Thank you. I'd love to meet Mrs. Burgoyne.

113
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,892
We'll expect you, then.

114
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,643
<i>- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno, signorina.</i>

115
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,155
Oh. Good morning.

116
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,371
I didn't think you'd be up.

117
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,120
- I've been up all night.
- I must say, you look it.

118
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,540
Well, you might show
a little more consideration

119
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,747
for a man who's just written 20,000 words.

120
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,675
You've started it.

121
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,212
I got home at midnight
intoxicated with an idea.

122
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,340
I worked myself into a creative hangover.

123
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,971
- Let me fix you some coffee.
- No. No, thanks.

124
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,096
While you type these up,
I'm going to fall into bed.

125
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,898
Well, I'm glad you've
given up writing articles

126
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,059
and started back to work
on a novel, again.

127
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,154
- I was afraid you were afraid.
- What do you mean by that?

128
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,573
Oh, nothing. I was worried
for fear the critics

129
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,776
had intimidated you after that last one.

130
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,452
- I should have known better.
- Of course you should have.

131
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,701
I write for myself, not the critics.

132
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,786
You'll be pleased to know

133
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,659
the old master is back in stride again.

134
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,797
I'm rather anxious to hear
what you think about the start.

135
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,509
Not only do I consider it magnificent,

136
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,762
but I have a sneaking suspicion
it's pretty good.

137
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,722
Get some sleep.

138
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,598
I'll knock on your door in time for you

139
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,365
to make it to the Burgoyne cocktail party.

140
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,472
Not I.

141
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,762
I have no intention of exposing myself

142
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,392
to that dreary assemblage.

143
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,317
When I get up, I'm gonna stroll
through the gardens of

144
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,606
the Villa Borghese
in solitary contentment.

145
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,989
But I've already accepted
the invitation in your name.

146
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,195
Then jolly well make an excuse in my name.

147
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,821
Do you know what people say
when I mention I work for you?

148
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,827
Something envious, I presume.

149
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,284
They say, "Oh, I thought he was dead."

150
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,790
Do they, indeed?

151
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,043
You can't be as antisocial as you are

152
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,424
and still expect people
to know you're alive.

153
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,798
So they think that I'm dead, do they?

154
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,969
Hmm.

155
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,260
Well, well.

156
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,512
Wake me at 4:00.

157
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,973
I'll make an appearance to prove my public

158
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,349
only half right.

159
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,477
When these come in from Washington,

160
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,355
they have to be translated into Italian.

161
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,647
By me?

162
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,562
Oh, no. We have interpreters here.

163
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,240
Giorgio, would you come in
for a minute, please?

164
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,449
Giorgio handles our translations for us.

165
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,902
Then they're given to Mr. Burgoyne

166
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,079
for clearance with the Italian bureau.

167
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,373
- Good morning, Miss Anita.
- Oh. Good morning.

168
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,577
Maria, this is Giorgio Bianchi.
Giorgio, this is Maria Williams.

169
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,620
She'll be taking my place when I leave.

170
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,255
If I can be of any help, please call me.

171
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,543
I heard you were returning
to America, Miss Anita.

172
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,428
I shall... We shall miss you.

173
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,973
Oh. Thank you.

174
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,510
Here, would you make
a translation of these

175
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,932
- for Mr. Burgoyne, please?
- Yes, Miss Anita.

176
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,362
Well!

177
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,778
I forgot to tell you.
There's a policy here.

178
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,867
Secretaries are not allowed
to go out with local employees.

179
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,119
Mr. Burgoyne's policy, if you please.

180
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,075
How do you manage it, then?

181
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,699
Giorgio?

182
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,473
We've never exchanged more than two words.

183
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,790
- He's just part of the office.
- Oh.

184
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,668
Does his hand always shake
when he gets near to you?

185
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,625
You're imagining things.
He doesn't even know I exist.

186
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,177
Oh! He doesn't know anyone else exists.

187
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,846
He didn't even notice whether
I was a blonde or a brunette...

188
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,344
Well, you're wrong.

189
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,642
Call him in.

190
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,640
I just want to look at those
beautiful brown eyes again.

191
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,645
- Not brown, they're blue.
- Oh.

192
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,853
I mean... It's a good thing
I'm going home.

193
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:06,983
With you around here,

194
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,860
I'd be in a puddle of trouble in no time.

195
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,566
Here, sit down and open those up for me.

196
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,087
Mr. Shadwell, I don't care
what the critics said.

197
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,264
I want you to know
I just adored your last novel.

198
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,717
Unfortunately,
there were not enough of you.

199
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,098
Tell me, do you get
your best ideas at night?

200
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,349
I always do.

201
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,478
Invariably, but hardly
material to write about.

202
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,232
My husband declares that I
was simply born to be a writer.

203
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,905
He says if anyone just took
a pencil and followed me around,

204
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,282
they'd have a novel.

205
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,449
My dear lady,

206
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,119
I should be delighted
to get behind you with a pencil.

207
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,366
Excuse me.

208
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,984
We've learned from long experience

209
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,000
this is the best way to pass the time.

210
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,712
So, this is Rome,
where the pigeons eat caviar.

211
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,592
And the secretaries eat alone.

212
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,100
Look, did you ever see
such a handsome car?

213
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,764
You ever see such a handsome man?

214
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,189
- It's Prince di Cessi.
- A prince? Do you know him?

215
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,109
He's a friend of Mr. Shadwell's.
Part of the Roman scene.

216
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,902
Um, eligible?

217
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,063
Dino is handsome, wealthy,

218
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,194
and has one of
the oldest titles in Europe.

219
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,900
As long as he has the first two,

220
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,434
you won't catch him getting married.

221
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,278
Oh, what a shame.

222
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,114
Oh!

223
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,449
What's the matter?

224
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,499
Oh, I knocked my purse off the railing.

225
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,997
I'll ask Dino to get it for you.

226
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,122
Oh, no. Please don't.
He'll think I did it on purpose.

227
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,583
- He won't mind. Dino?
- Yes?

228
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,476
We dropped a purse
from the balcony.

229
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,048
Would you mind bringing it up?

230
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,471
With the greatest of pleasure,
Miss Frances.

231
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,514
You sure you didn't
knock it off on purpose?

232
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,976
Oh, no, believe me, I didn't.
I'm not that quick-witted.

233
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,399
Well, just in case it was instinct,

234
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,285
perhaps we'd better warn
our friend about Dino

235
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,648
before she meets him.

236
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,980
He's known as "the predatory prince."

237
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,282
And girls who are seen
in his company more than once

238
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,904
are known as Venice Girls.

239
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:17,994
Why?

240
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,200
The time comes when he asks you
to fly to Venice with him.

241
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,747
Once you're known as a Venice Girl,

242
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,074
you might as well go home.

243
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,083
I hope nothing was broken.

244
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,789
Thank you. It belongs to my friend.

245
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,421
Maria, this is Prince di Cessi.
This is Miss Williams.

246
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,127
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

247
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,634
Fresh from the States.
Of course, you know Anita.

248
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,885
Oh, yes. We met when I first came to Rome.

249
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,389
Yes, yes. I remember it with sadness.

250
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,306
People said bad things about me,

251
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,476
and you would not permit me
to show you Rome.

252
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,518
Have they been telling you
disgraceful things about me too?

253
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,819
- Oh, no.
- That's too bad.

254
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,189
If only half the things
said about me were true,

255
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,819
I'd be a happy man.

256
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,238
- I suspect half of them are.
- You see?

257
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,069
There is a conspiracy against me in Rome.

258
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,370
You must excuse me.

259
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,164
I haven't spoken to my host yet.
I'll be back.

260
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,294
He's nice.

261
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,088
Oh, I don't believe he's the wolf you say.

262
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,966
Why, he looks as innocent as a little boy.

263
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,543
Oh, that he does.

264
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,220
But don't try taking him
on your lap to mother him.

265
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,007
You'll find yourself suddenly
screaming for the police.

266
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,024
Well, so much for your
first cocktail party in Rome.

267
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,602
- Shall we walk home or ride?
- Let's walk.

268
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,116
Do you know something strange?

269
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,993
Except for that handsome prince,

270
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,830
not one attractive man
came near us at the party.

271
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,003
Well, I guess now is as good a time as any

272
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,379
to disillusion you.

273
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,463
If you're romantic,
Rome is not the city for you.

274
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,592
Why not?

275
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,715
Well, wealthy Italians

276
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,971
don't waste their time on secretaries,

277
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,554
and the Italians that work
at the agency are too poor.

278
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,103
Oh. No wonder you're
going home to be married.

279
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,851
I'm not even engaged.

280
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,561
I just gave that as an excuse
at the agency for leaving.

281
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,813
But at least I'm going back to a country

282
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,900
where I hope some nice guy will ask me.

283
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,868
That's why I didn't throw a coin
in the Fountain of Trevi.

284
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,071
Oh, dear. It looks as though I've wasted

285
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,077
a perfectly good penny.

286
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,466
Well, which way?

287
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,798
This way looks sort of
interesting. You want to try it?

288
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,758
It doesn't look very respectable.

289
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,309
Good. Let's have a look.

290
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,332
- Anita, somebody pinched me.
- Don't look back.

291
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,754
It's considered an encouragement.

292
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,081
Just pretend you didn't notice.

293
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,054
Are you kidding?
I'll kick him in his antipasto.

294
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,174
Oh, let's go.

295
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,730
- Giorgio!
- Oh. Miss Anita.

296
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,033
We've been waiting for you.
I thought you said 7:00.

297
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,530
What detained you?

298
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,744
I've been showing Maria the city,

299
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,961
and he followed us.

300
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,881
You shouldn't be in this section
unescorted, Miss Anita.

301
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,334
Things can happen that
American girls don't understand.

302
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,714
We understand, all right.

303
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,171
A pinch is a pinch in any man's language.

304
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,137
As long as you are here
and I am here, Miss Anita,

305
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,347
would you allow me to show you my Rome?

306
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,228
- We'd love to.
- Well, sure.

307
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,807
<i>Bene</i>.

308
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,274
It's strange.

309
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,194
We have seen each other
every day for two years,

310
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,029
and yet this is the first time

311
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,701
I have ever really talked to you.

312
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,904
I always thought
you didn't like Americans.

313
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,327
Oh, no. I thought you
didn't like Italians.

314
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,079
Isn't that silly?

315
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,663
What's that monastery?

316
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,250
Oh no, it's not a monastery.

317
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,672
It's a <i>palazzo.</i>

318
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,758
A <i>palazzo?</i>

319
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,466
- Oh, that's a palace, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,588
Who owns it?

321
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,091
It's the home of the prince,
Dino di Cessi.

322
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,347
Oh. Well, you two just drink your wine.

323
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,470
I'm gonna sit here
and look at the <i>palazzo.</i>

324
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,981
- Does he live there all alone?
- Oh, no.

325
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,354
Oh.

326
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,811
He lives with his mother, the <i>principessa.</i>

327
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,692
Oh, how sweet.

328
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,112
But he must get lonely.
What does he do for amusement?

329
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,740
Oh, he has diversions.
He plays the piccolo.

330
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,114
- He plays what?
- The piccolo.

331
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,495
He's an excellent piccolo player.

332
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,994
My cousin is his teacher.

333
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,171
Well, that does it.

334
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,108
I think I'll have some wine
with you after all.

335
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:26,376
Good! This is the wine
that we drink on our <i>festa.</i>

336
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,555
Have you ever been to
an Italian <i>festa,</i> Miss Anita?

337
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,926
No, I don't think so.

338
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,098
We are having one at our farm, tomorrow,

339
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,264
to celebrate my sister's engagement.

340
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,730
You shouldn't go back to America
without seeing an Italian <i>festa.</i>

341
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,358
Uh... If you would like
to come too, Miss Williams...

342
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,810
No, thank you. I have to stay
and write some letters.

343
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,854
All my family expect a report from me,

344
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,861
and I can't disappoint them.
Why don't you go, Anita?

345
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,735
Well, I'd love to,
but I don't think I could.

346
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,071
I know. It's against the agency rules.

347
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,030
Oh, but it's only this once.

348
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,825
You're not gonna let some silly
old rule stand in your way.

349
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,036
Well, it isn't that. I have packing to do.

350
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,583
My cousin has a truck.

351
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,211
He is driving in to pick up
our relatives in Rome.

352
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,381
We could ride in the truck,
if you didn't mind.

353
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,720
Oh, all right, Giorgio.

354
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,640
I'll be darned if I'll spend
my last weekend in Rome alone.

355
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,250
Giorgio, you're not giving it wine?

356
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,248
Oh, no, no, Miss Anita. Water.

357
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,916
I am sorry to be late,

358
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,713
but unfortunately, a wheel came off.

359
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,174
<i>Andiamo</i>.

360
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,004
- This is my cousin, Enrico.
- How do you do?

361
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,474
What?

362
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,164
- These are all your cousins?
- Oh, yeah.

363
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,270
Cousins, brothers, nieces.
I will introduce you later.

364
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,145
<i>Andiamo!</i>

365
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,592
My cousin has no brakes, nor horn.

366
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,139
Did we frighten you?

367
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,388
Oh, no. I'm all right, I think.

368
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,099
When the driver gives the signal,

369
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,226
we must all toot like horns.

370
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,628
But, Giorgio, don't you think
it's a little dangerous

371
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,689
to drive without brakes
and without a horn?

372
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,815
Oh, no.

373
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,318
We hang a St. Christopher medal
on the windshield.

374
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,899
Nothing can happen to us.

375
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,204
Did you ever ride in a truck before?

376
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,879
No, I haven't.

377
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,923
Whoa!

378
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,479
- Giorgio, what happened?
- Oh, nothing.

379
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,108
Nothing? It's an accident.

380
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,545
Isn't that Anita, your secretary,

381
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,799
in that truck?

382
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,223
And with the interpreter from the office.

383
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,128
<i>Pronto</i>. Why, yes, she is. Just a moment.

384
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,459
It's for you, Maria.

385
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,631
I don't know anyone in Rome, yet.

386
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,716
Hello? Yes.

387
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,591
Yes. It's that Prince di Cessi.

388
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,968
Dino? How did he ever find this number?

389
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,604
Well, how did you ever find the number?

390
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,477
Oh, one has ways.

391
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,943
I was planning on flying
my plane to Venice this morning.

392
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,523
Have you been to Venice?

393
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,739
He wants to know
if I'll fly with him to Venice.

394
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,941
What'll I say?

395
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,993
- Say no.
- Yes, I'd love to,

396
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,036
but I'm sorry. I can't.

397
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,241
Y... Um...

398
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,878
He says we could fly there
and be back by tonight.

399
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,083
That's what he always says,

400
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,970
and then he'll have trouble
with his propeller,

401
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,808
and you'll have trouble
with your reputation.

402
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,923
- Thank him kindly, but hang up.
- Yes, I'd love to, but...

403
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,635
It's very kind of you,
but I'm sorry. I can't.

404
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,932
- Say yes.
- Yes?

405
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,511
- Yes.
- Just a moment. Why?

406
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,970
You want to see Venice.

407
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,101
But tell him you have
to be back by tonight.

408
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,071
- But you just said...
- Never mind what I said.

409
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,317
Tell him you'll go.

410
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,614
You will?

411
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,108
Oh, I promise you
I will get you back tonight.

412
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,782
And I will do everything I can
to see that you enjoy your trip.

413
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,699
Can you be ready in a half hour? Good.

414
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,370
I shall be there.

415
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:10,855
You are ready!

416
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,472
This is the first time in my life

417
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,808
I have not been kept waiting.
It's a good omen.

418
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,296
- Good morning, Miss Frances.
- Good morning.

419
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,714
- It's very nice to see you.
- Thank you.

420
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,132
At the prospect of going to Venice,

421
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,425
I could be ready in five minutes.

422
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,735
Oh, I can promise you

423
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,817
it will be a trip
that you shall long remember.

424
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,447
So let us not waste any time.

425
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,824
Oh, you don't mind giving
Miss Frances a lift, do you?

426
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,373
Not at all. Where shall
I drop you, Miss Frances?

427
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,575
Venice.

428
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,253
Venice?

429
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,250
Well, if it's not too much trouble.

430
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,876
Yes, you see, Miss Frances

431
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,628
was going to Venice herself this weekend,

432
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,552
and I thought it might be fun
if she came along with us.

433
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,763
- Oh.
- You don't mind, do you?

434
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,636
Oh, not at all. Not at all.

435
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,894
But, well, my plane is not a large one

436
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,141
and, well, I'm afraid

437
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,064
it would be most uncomfortable,
Miss Frances.

438
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,893
Well, I suppose I had better
take the train after all.

439
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,606
Oh, that is too bad.

440
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,404
Well, I certainly couldn't
let you make that trip alone.

441
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,733
So I'll go on the train with you,

442
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,318
and I can meet you in Venice.
Is that all right?

443
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,014
- Mama!
<i>- Caro!</i>

444
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,437
This is my mother, Anita.
I told her all about you.

445
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,480
<i>Buon giorno, signora. Come sta?</i>

446
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,530
She talks too fast. What'd she say?

447
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,699
- She said you're very pretty.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

448
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,947
- This is my father.
<i>- Come sta, signore?</i>

449
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,696
<i>Bravo, Giorgio.</i>

450
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,451
<i>Quando il matrimonio, eh?</i>

451
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,869
- What did he say?
- Oh, nothing.

452
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,421
My father means well,
but he misunderstands.

453
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,749
This is my sister, Angela.

454
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,176
We are celebrating her engagement today.

455
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,924
Oh, <i>ciao,</i> Angela.

456
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,568
Dinner is ready!

457
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,772
Bravo!

458
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,568
Off there is Rome.

459
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,524
I used to sit here when I was small

460
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,196
and dream someday
of going away to the city.

461
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,036
When I first came to Rome as a boy,

462
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,160
I threw a coin in the Fountain of Trevi.

463
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,537
I wanted to return and become a lawyer.

464
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,045
- What do you think?
- You got your wish.

465
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,174
No.

466
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,883
There is something more
to the dream than I asked for.

467
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,837
Well, you'll be a lawyer.

468
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,717
You'll be a very good one, too, I know.

469
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,218
I've always liked lawyers.

470
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,509
That's not what I meant.

471
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,606
The man you are going back
to America to marry,

472
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,021
is he, by any chance, a lawyer?

473
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,317
Well, the truth of the matter is...

474
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,826
Actually, it embarrasses me
to have to tell you, Giorgio,

475
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,286
but I guess I do owe you an explanation.

476
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,329
No, you owe me nothing, Miss Anita.

477
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,370
I have no right to cross-examine you.

478
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,996
It was not judicial.

479
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,169
- But I...
- No, no. Please.

480
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,507
What's in the valley below?

481
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,883
The bottom of the hill.

482
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,265
But there is also a pool and a stream.

483
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,176
- Very shady and beautiful.
- Hmm.

484
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,725
I've always liked streams.
Could we go down?

485
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,230
But of course. Uh... Shall we
take my cousin's truck?

486
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,441
- I'll honk when you signal.
- All right.

487
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,533
You wouldn't believe it, I know,

488
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,920
but this car and I are the same age.

489
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,505
Hmm. I believe it.

490
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,132
Okay.

491
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,266
- Oh! Are you hurt?
- Put the car in gear!

492
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,889
- Giorgio!
- Jump, Anita! Jump out!

493
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,144
Giorgio! Giorgio!

494
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,656
Giorgio!

495
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,528
Anita, put it in gear!

496
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,245
Anita!

497
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,041
Anita! Anita, jump!

498
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,501
- Jump out!
- I can't!

499
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,427
Anita! Anita!

500
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,477
- Giorgio!
- Anita, did you get hurt?

501
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,893
No. No.

502
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,985
No, I'm all right. I... I
just couldn't get it into gear.

503
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,027
You could have been killed, Anita.

504
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:19,992
No.

505
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,950
Anita. Anita.

506
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,911
I love you so much.

507
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,244
I want to tell you that I love you.

508
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,385
What are they shouting?

509
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,343
They want to know if we are all right.

510
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,894
You tell them
we're quite all right...

511
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,017
for the moment.

512
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,444
Look.

513
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:08,804
Look.

514
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,729
It's been a wonderful day, Dino.
It really has.

515
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,148
I'm glad that you enjoyed it.

516
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,602
I'm sorry I was 15 years late
in accepting your invitation.

517
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,229
Perhaps we can do it again,
in another 15 years.

518
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,564
<i>Scusi, signor.</i>

519
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,399
Oh, <i>grazie.</i>

520
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,367
Will you excuse me a second?

521
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,447
Something tells me he's angry.

522
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,625
I don't blame him. It was a mean trick.

523
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,827
Pity is, I really like him,

524
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,774
and now he'll probably
never want to see me again.

525
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,238
I really should have stayed at home.

526
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,467
Nonsense. We agreed this
was my chance to see Venice.

527
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,634
Why don't I take the train back tonight,

528
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,173
and you can stay on an extra day?

529
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,101
- If you want to. Do you want to?
- Well...

530
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,935
It was the airport.

531
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,024
My plane is ready to take off at any time.

532
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,394
I was just trying to convince Maria

533
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,229
that she ought to stay over another day.

534
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,611
Well, of course,
if you two wish to remain,

535
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,905
but I really have
to get back tonight, you see.

536
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,203
It is regrettable,

537
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,408
but I have a meeting with
some of my tenants tomorrow.

538
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,665
Oh, well that settles it,
if both of you are leaving,

539
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,209
there's no point in
my staying on here alone.

540
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,296
Alone?

541
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,088
Under the circumstances,

542
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,854
I'm sure that I can make
some arrangements.

543
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,293
Oh, no. I don't want you
to disappoint your tenants.

544
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,109
Well, where were you?

545
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,787
I was just wondering how it would feel

546
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,035
to ride to work
on the handlebars of a bicycle.

547
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,328
Why?

548
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,041
Yes, Mr. Burgoyne?

549
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,359
<i>Maria, will you come</i>

550
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,669
<i>into the office at once, please?</i>

551
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,759
Yes, sir.

552
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,426
He must have slept here.

553
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,389
Yes, Mr. Burgoyne?

554
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,387
I want to talk to you, Maria.

555
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,232
Uh...

556
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,979
We feel, here, at the agency,
that Americans abroad

557
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,026
have a responsibility to their country.

558
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,567
They should always conduct
themselves with dignity.

559
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,365
If you mean about my going
to Venice, Mr. Burgoyne,

560
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,451
I assure you...

561
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,323
I was referring to Anita, Miss Williams.

562
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:39,997
Oh.

563
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,286
As you know, it is the policy
of our agency

564
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,665
that our secretaries do not
go out with the local employees.

565
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,005
Yes, sir.

566
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,002
Anita has been violating
that rule, hasn't she?

567
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,718
Why, whatever makes you
think that, Mr. Burgoyne?

568
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,130
I saw her going out
of the city with Giorgio.

569
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,349
Oh.

570
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,678
Well, there was some sort
of festival in the country and...

571
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,057
She spent the weekend with him?

572
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,981
But she's going back to America
to be married.

573
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,519
Oh, no, she isn't. She only used that
as an excuse...

574
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,155
You...

575
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,152
You mean that the situation is
such that it became necessary

576
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,949
for her to create this deception?

577
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,840
Well, of course, you don't have to
answer that, if you prefer not to.

578
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,490
I'd gladly answer it, Mr. Burgoyne.

579
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,660
Anita has done nothing wrong,
I promise you.

580
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,545
Why don't you ask her yourself?

581
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,213
I will.

582
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,046
Thank you for your reassurance,
Miss Williams.

583
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,553
It's only that my interest
in my girls here

584
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,631
transcends official obligation.

585
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,058
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

586
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,522
Yes.

587
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,696
Yes, but you see,

588
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,064
we haven't had any official
notification of it yet.

589
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:03,033
Yes, sir. Yes. All right.

590
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,080
<i>Via Condore.</i>

591
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,243
Fifty-one, yes.

592
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,679
I can't understand why she said

593
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,385
she was going home to get married.

594
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,645
Do you know if she's seen a doctor?

595
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,978
Such a thing would never occur to me.

596
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,268
She seems like such a nice girl.

597
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,561
Nice girls are human, my dear.

598
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,292
Hi.

599
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,133
- What are you doing?
- I'm moving.

600
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,545
Anita, what's happened?

601
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,551
How could you have done this to me?

602
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,640
- How could you?
- Do what?

603
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,342
I don't know what you're talking about.

604
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,098
What business was it of yours

605
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,895
if I went to the country with Giorgio?

606
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,644
What right had you to tell Burgoyne

607
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,975
or explain to him I'm not
going home to get married?

608
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,401
Well, he asked me why...

609
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,228
I only thought I was helping you.

610
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,279
Did you think you were helping
by telling him

611
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,686
I spent the weekend with Giorgio?

612
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,449
I didn't say it that way.

613
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,614
Well, he asked me if I wanted
to consult his doctor.

614
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,242
He said the office would be
very happy to pay for it.

615
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,744
He wanted to know how long
this had been going on.

616
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:35,955
Anita, I...

617
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,919
I'm sorry.

618
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:44,047
Well... I'm going home
in a few days anyway,

619
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,474
so in the meantime,
you stay here in the apartment.

620
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,264
I'm going to stay someplace by myself.

621
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,896
Anita, will you please listen to me?

622
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,141
Look, I can't remember what
I said to Mr. Burgoyne,

623
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,733
but believe me, it's been distorted.

624
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,560
Well, he fired Giorgio!

625
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,771
Oh, no.

626
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,949
He fired him without a recommendation.

627
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,611
Jobs are hard to get
without a recommendation.

628
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,780
He wanted to be a lawyer. Now he can't.

629
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,625
We certainly left him with
something to remember us by.

630
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,789
Anita!

631
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,265
- Hello, Giorgio.
- Anita.

632
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:15,471
You should not have come here.
How did you find this place?

633
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,855
I looked your address up
in the office files.

634
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,397
- I cannot ask you in.
- Please.

635
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,986
It's not a good place.

636
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,156
Burgoyne told me why he fired you.

637
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,541
I knew the rules. I broke them.

638
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,207
I cannot honestly say I regret it.

639
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,129
What are you going to do?

640
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,503
I shall try for another position.

641
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,006
Failing that, I can always
return to my family.

642
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,796
It's not hopeless.

643
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,510
If you'll have to go home,

644
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,309
you won't be able
to continue your studies.

645
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,557
Perhaps I shouldn't be a lawyer

646
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,889
if I cannot honor simple office rules.

647
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,145
Look, don't justify Burgoyne!

648
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,226
This could cost you your career.

649
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,023
I'm not gonna let him do it to you.

650
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,237
Anita.

651
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,783
You must not be angry.
I knew what I was doing.

652
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,907
This happened. I will accept
the consequences.

653
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,284
I'm gonna go back to him
and make him take you back.

654
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,702
You will only convince him

655
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,454
he acted wisely in the first place.

656
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,415
But I can't just go away,

657
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,672
leaving you here to face
a problem I created for you.

658
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,464
You will go back to America,
as you have to,

659
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,047
and I will return to our farm, if I must.

660
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,559
Giorgio,

661
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,561
I have a day or two left
before I have to go back.

662
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:43,017
Would it help you at all
if we spent them together?

663
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,148
Anita.

664
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,525
Oh, <i>cara.</i>

665
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,212
No. What could I offer you?

666
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,014
I have no job. In the end,
you have to leave anyhow.

667
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,342
You are not free.

668
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,392
I'm free to do anything I please!

669
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,186
You are going home to be married.

670
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,515
I'm not going to be married.
I'm not even engaged.

671
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,643
I only told Burgoyne that

672
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,773
as an excuse for leaving the agency.

673
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,566
There is no one?

674
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,534
There's no one.

675
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,890
- Come in, <i>signorina.</i>
- Thank you.

676
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,563
- Frances!
- Yes?

677
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,975
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello.

678
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,397
Should I have phoned?

679
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,092
No, of course not. Thank you, Louisa.

680
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,231
- What is it?
- I can't find Anita.

681
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,487
I've checked all the hotels.

682
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,618
She hasn't been back,
she hasn't been to the office.

683
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,580
I'm just worried sick.

684
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,658
Well, I don't think
we need worry about it.

685
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,204
Anita's hurt and unhappy,

686
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,878
and she probably wants to
be alone for a few days.

687
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,001
She'll show up. Did you talk to Burgoyne?

688
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,216
He won't take Giorgio back.

689
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,339
Oh! He's a fool.

690
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,342
- What can we do?
- Nothing at the moment.

691
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,429
Now, stop worrying about it.
It wasn't your fault.

692
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,928
Look, do you think Mr. Shadwell

693
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,975
could get Giorgio's job back for him?

694
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,849
- That would help.
- Well, we'll see.

695
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,314
I'm going over to the museum
to pick him up now.

696
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,024
Why don't you come along?

697
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,475
You haven't been to
the museum yet, have you?

698
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,535
No.

699
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,459
Museums I can do without.
I was born in one.

700
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,251
- You were?
- Sure.

701
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,750
My dad had an Indian museum
on the highway,

702
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,206
next to his gas station.

703
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,626
It was free with ten gallons of gas.

704
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,697
Well, this one has a different
kind of an attraction.

705
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,928
What?

706
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,301
For one thing, Prince Dino
is there with Shadwell

707
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,220
discussing some paintings he's donating.

708
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,391
Oh.

709
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,018
Wouldn't you like to see him again?

710
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,933
Hmm, he'd just love to see me.

711
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,730
You could discuss art with him.

712
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,143
Oh, that would be a change.
What does he collect, nudes?

713
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,402
No, as a matter of fact,
he's mad about modern paintings.

714
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,653
Oh, that's a side I'd never suspect.

715
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,575
Why don't you show him you have a side

716
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:40,778
he'd never suspect?

717
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,035
Show him you have a mind.

718
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,117
Oh, I love you,
but I couldn't fool a fool.

719
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,793
I don't know anything about art.

720
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,086
Give it a try.

721
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,913
You might end up meeting his mother.

722
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,167
And why should I want to meet his mother?

723
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,379
Meeting Mama in Italy
is the first step to the altar.

724
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:05,349
Oh. Well, um...
Let's discuss art some more.

725
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,152
Don't forget, Neo-Impressionism.

726
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,236
Neo-Impressionist. Neo-Impressionist.

727
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,197
Neo-Impressionist.

728
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,368
Harmony of color... and infinity.

729
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,622
You'll do.

730
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,344
How can you say it bores you?

731
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,922
You, with your heritage.

732
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,762
My heritage included
a castle with no plumbing,

733
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,850
but I happen to prefer
running water and modern art.

734
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,002
You'll forgive me if I don't
take your opinion seriously.

735
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,296
Don't forget, I knew you when
you were still running around

736
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,811
in three-cornered pants.

737
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,730
Hello. I'm Maria Williams.

738
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,531
We met at the Burgoyne's, Mr. Shadwell,

739
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,491
but I'm sure you don't remember me.

740
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,912
You're quite wrong.
I remember you very well.

741
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,826
It's the party I've forgotten.

742
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,873
- How do you do, Miss Williams?
- Hello.

743
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,618
I drove over with Miss Frances.

744
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,072
She asked me to tell you that
she's waiting for you outside.

745
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,043
Punctuality is the vice of virtuous women.

746
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,499
May I drop you?

747
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:18,925
No, thank you. I have my car.

748
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,761
Dino, take the advice of an old friend.

749
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,766
Don't treat a work of art
as you do an automobile,

750
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,175
turning it in for a new model every year.

751
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,970
Oh, we can't live in
the past forever, Mr. Shadwell.

752
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,805
- Exactly.
- Nonsense.

753
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,061
We live in the past
from the moment we're born.

754
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,486
Well, personally, I think that heritage
can sometimes shackle art.

755
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,738
Not to forget plumbing.

756
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,320
- Good day, Miss Williams.
- Good day.

757
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,151
I shall leave heretics to their heritage.

758
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,243
Well, it's very nice to see you again.

759
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,047
Oh, I wonder,

760
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,878
do you know if the museum
has any modern art?

761
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,126
Modern? In what sense?

762
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,299
Now, you really will think I'm a heretic,

763
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,299
but I'm passionately
interested in the, uh...

764
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,262
Neo-Impressionists.

765
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,312
You are?

766
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,638
Oh, I thought you'd be outraged.

767
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,349
But, yes, I'm mad about them.

768
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,148
As a matter of fact,
I'm a Neo-Impressionist myself.

769
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,902
There's a fine collection here.
May I show you the room?

770
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,610
- Well...
- This way.

771
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,581
Unless I missed my guess,

772
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,829
sending that girl in to get me

773
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,880
was a feminine intrigue of yours.

774
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,542
Am I right?

775
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,342
Whatever makes you think that?

776
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,636
Don't be evasive.

777
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,007
Dino told me
of your interference in Venice.

778
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,134
What are you trying to be? Mother Goose?

779
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,853
- Maria is a friend of mine.
- And Dino is a friend of mine.

780
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,348
Let people lead their own lives.

781
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,899
They have absolutely nothing in common.

782
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,068
You'd be surprised.

783
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,946
Dino's fond of art,
and Maria was born in a museum.

784
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,779
- She was born where?
- Ask her yourself.

785
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,577
Her father is curator
of a museum, out west.

786
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,369
You're right. I am surprised.

787
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,845
- Do you like it?
- How can you ask?

788
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,257
Well, does it speak to you?

789
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,471
Oh, yes, definitely.

790
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,974
Well then, what does it tell you?
What does it say?

791
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,726
Well, different pictures
say different things

792
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,067
to different people.

793
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,271
Yes, but the right paintings
say the right things

794
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,939
to the right people.

795
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,195
Yes, and you're so right.

796
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,822
Well, this...

797
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:56,412
Now, this seems to have a...
A feeling of space.

798
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,962
Those lines that carry you off
into the distance.

799
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,546
Oh, infinity is... Is so lonely.

800
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,552
Yes, it makes me want to cry.

801
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,343
You surprise me.

802
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,516
I could not have put it better myself.

803
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,847
Oh, well, you mustn't let me keep you.

804
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,982
I'm just going to sit here
a while and absorb it.

805
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:25,900
If I may, I'll sit here and absorb also.

806
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,095
It was such an enjoyable afternoon.

807
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,714
What are you going to do now?

808
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,431
Now?

809
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,097
Well, I'm going to go inside and sit down

810
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,019
and just think quietly

811
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,972
about all those lovely paintings.

812
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,227
You must think me silly
to feel so deeply about art.

813
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,109
Oh, not at all. One seldom meets
an American girl with your sensitivity,

814
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,612
your sense of appreciation.
It's wonderful.

815
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,113
Ah, well, if that is so,

816
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,195
it's probably because I'm half Italian.

817
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,790
- You are half Italian?
- Well, actually, three-quarters.

818
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,914
But I resemble my Irish grandmother.

819
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,667
Now, imagine! Three-quarters.

820
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,628
Mm, well, that's why
I took this job in Rome. I...

821
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,922
I wanted to be near my own kind.

822
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,796
Well, thank you again
for dropping me here.

823
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,660
I must hurry in.
My friends are waiting for me.

824
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:36,891
Now, I shall see you again?

825
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:41,100
I don't know. You see,
I'm rather afraid of you.

826
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,055
Afraid? Of me?

827
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,312
Oh, not because of your reputation.

828
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:49,146
But, you see, I've discovered
you have an exciting mind.

829
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,943
Something that handsome men rarely have.

830
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,902
And the combination might be too much

831
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,203
for someone as responsive as I am.

832
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,289
Well, goodbye, and thank you again.

833
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,653
You sent for me<i>, signorina?</i>

834
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,240
Yes. I'm told that
the Prince Dino di Cessi

835
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,692
often dines here.

836
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,451
He is a friend of the <i>signorina's?</i>

837
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,579
Oh, yes.

838
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,955
And I'm giving a small
dinner party for him,

839
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,865
and I thought you might be able to tell me

840
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,792
what his favorite dish is.

841
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Of course.

842
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,497
He is particularly fond of
<i>saltimbocca alla Romana.</i>

843
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,877
Oh. Just a moment.

844
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,503
<i>- Saltimbocca...
- Alla Romana.</i>

845
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,839
<i>- Alla Romana.</i>
- And his favorite wine?

846
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,971
Oh... Oh, yes. Lacrima Christi.

847
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,058
Lacrima Christi.

848
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,481
Thank you. Thank you very much.

849
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,605
Would the <i>signorina</i> like to order now?

850
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,904
Yes. I'll have a cup of coffee, please.

851
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,402
A cup of coffee.

852
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,407
It is his favorite opera,
<i>signorina</i>. This I know.

853
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:23,115
Oh, no. No, I know
that he likes, uh... Wagner.

854
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:27,327
Wagner? That is impossible!
He likes Italian opera.

855
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,084
I heard, myself, him say many times

856
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,549
that German music
assails the ear with its fist.

857
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,962
Italian caresses with its fingertips.

858
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,012
Well, thank you.

859
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,753
Will you excuse me?
I'll join you presently.

860
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:53,881
Yes, of course.

861
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,335
<i>Buona sera, Dino. Come stai?</i>

862
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,709
Ah, my friend. You must sit with us.

863
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,051
I can only stay a moment.

864
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,260
I'm with the Burgoynes,

865
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,027
and I wouldn't want
to inflict them on you.

866
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,433
- How do you do, Miss Williams?
- How do you do?

867
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,929
I saw you at the opera. Did you enjoy it?

868
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,597
Rossini is one of her favorites.

869
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,690
Indeed.

870
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,276
I do wish Alvarez were
less limited in his tessitura.

871
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,065
Don't you?

872
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,731
Do you?

873
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:23,443
- No. No, not at all.
- I don't either.

874
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,073
But surely you disagree

875
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,246
about the various tempi of the conductor?

876
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,166
Why?

877
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,494
Now, my friend, we found
no fault with this performance.

878
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,545
You cannot spoil it for us.

879
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,668
Oh, I'm sure Mr. Shadwell
wouldn't do that.

880
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,797
I... It's just that he's a perfectionist.

881
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,344
- Thank you.
- I know that from your books.

882
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,381
- Which one?
- All of them.

883
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,057
Well, you've certainly
covered a lot of territory.

884
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,222
Dino, you're in the hands of an expert.

885
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,939
Good evening, Miss Williams.
<i>Arrivederci, caro.</i>

886
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,028
<i>Ciao.</i>

887
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,157
He likes you.

888
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,993
And I'm glad, because he's my friend.

889
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,322
Now, what shall we have?

890
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,958
Well, I know this is mad,

891
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,958
but I would just love some
<i>saltimbocca alla Romana.</i>

892
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,048
Excellent!

893
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,420
<i>Saltimbocca alla Romana</i>
is a favorite of mine.

894
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,964
Now, what would you like to drink with it?

895
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,636
Do you suppose they'd have
some Lacrima Christi?

896
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:28,887
But of course!

897
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,434
Now, you know, Maria,

898
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,682
it is astounding
how much we have in common.

899
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,355
Well, you're very kind.

900
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,025
Italians certainly have
mastered the art of gallantry.

901
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,111
But it's true.

902
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,192
Well, it's very sweet of you to say so,

903
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,532
but you needn't pretend
that you like everything I like.

904
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,489
- It's too tiresome for you.
- But I swear it's true.

905
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:51,456
I can think of nothing on which
we disagree. It's amazing.

906
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,662
You really are a nice person.

907
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,206
You try so hard to make a girl feel that

908
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,208
she's chosen the right thing.

909
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,755
And whether it's true or not,
isn't important.

910
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,549
It's the motive that counts.

911
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,506
- Don't you think so?
- Of course.

912
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,758
Which proves that we agree on everything.

913
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,939
<i>Grazie.</i>

914
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,443
What's the matter?

915
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,077
Maria...

916
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,945
there is something I want.

917
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,873
Well, what?

918
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,332
I should like to have you meet my mother.

919
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,251
Well, if you like.

920
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:42,633
Sunday?

921
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:44,963
So soon?

922
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,179
I shall call for you.

923
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,131
Oh, you're early.

924
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,471
You play the piccolo too?

925
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,095
No, but I've always wanted to learn.

926
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,547
If you're going to study music,
Rome is the place to do it.

927
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,271
But I also play the piccolo!

928
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,940
Now, Dino, you must stop saying

929
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,814
that you like everything I like.

930
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,743
You're going to make me
think you're insincere.

931
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,737
But I <i>do</i> play the piccolo. Look.

932
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,250
- You see?
- But you play like an angel.

933
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,834
Perhaps someday we can play duets.

934
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,508
I should like that.

935
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,386
Well, I think that we should not
keep my mother waiting.

936
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,282
Maria?

937
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,823
- Maria, this is my mother.
- How do you do?

938
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,864
It was good of you to come to see me.

939
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,412
Thank you.

940
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,295
- Isn't she lovely, Mother?
- You failed to do her justice.

941
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,252
Dino, bring my blue shawl. It is chilly.

942
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,178
Uh... But, Mother,
you have your blue shawl.

943
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,389
Take it away. It is warm.

944
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,307
Go away, Dino.

945
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,353
I want to talk to Maria alone
for a moment.

946
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,359
- Will you have a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

947
01:05:56,286 --> 01:06:00,280
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

948
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,582
I want to tell you,
I was predisposed to like you.

949
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,163
You were? Why?

950
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,996
You have made my son happy.
For that, I am grateful.

951
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,380
Oh, I shall not live forever.

952
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,174
It was a matter of concern to me

953
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,502
that he should depend
on me for understanding.

954
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,596
Well, I really haven't...

955
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,297
My son tells me you are half Italian.

956
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,264
Oh, yes, uh... Actually three-quarters.

957
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:24,894
Your father?

958
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,809
Yes, but, um...

959
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,143
I... I really didn't know him.
He died when I was a baby.

960
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,317
A pity.

961
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,234
My son also lost his father
when he was a child.

962
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,358
You both have an early tragedy
in your lives.

963
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:41,116
Oh, it is good that two people
should start with understanding.

964
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,161
Yes, I... I guess so.

965
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,788
Dino, you are much too quick.

966
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,870
Now, Mother,

967
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,046
I shall tell you something
that will amaze you.

968
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,046
Do you know that she plays the piccolo?

969
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,798
I am amazed.

970
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,301
Well, I don't, really. I'm just beginning.

971
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,847
Oh, you are modest.

972
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,518
Dino, bring us some wine.
We shall drink a toast.

973
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,095
And do you know what wine she likes?

974
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,355
- Lacrima Christi!
- No!

975
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,145
- Yes.
- Yes?

976
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:11,902
Yes.

977
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,312
- No.
- Yes!

978
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,910
I'm very glad that you like my mother.

979
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,162
How could I help but like her?

980
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,957
She's the only woman
I've ever trusted completely.

981
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,284
Until I met you.

982
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:30,337
Oh.

983
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,530
There is something I would
like to say to you, Maria.

984
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,037
Yes?

985
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:07,831
But first I should like
to explain to you that

986
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,206
what experiences
I have had in my life before

987
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,959
have left me... suspicious.

988
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,548
But you're not the least bit suspicious.

989
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,917
That's one of the things I like about you.

990
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,469
I hide it well.

991
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,132
But always beneath... there was cynicism.

992
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,886
I say "was," because
since knowing you, it is gone.

993
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,348
Oh, Maria, it is good to be free of doubt,

994
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,901
to find someone
that you can trust completely.

995
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,399
- Dino, I... I think...
- No, wait.

996
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,773
First I want to tell you something.

997
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:46,029
Here, where the heart
asks only to be trusted,

998
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,642
I must tell you, Maria, that I...

999
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,374
Dino, please don't say anything more.

1000
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:56,297
Could it be possible that
I misunderstood how you feel?

1001
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,624
- Oh, no.
- Well, then why should I not speak?

1002
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,720
Because there's something
I have to tell you first.

1003
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,758
This may hurt you, but I must say it.

1004
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,395
Oh, Dino.

1005
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,686
I've lied to you
from the first moment we met.

1006
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,073
I've done nothing to restore
your faith or your trust.

1007
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,451
I went after you
with a well-organized system.

1008
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,573
- You are making a joke.
- No, I'm not.

1009
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,911
Look. Look, I... I...

1010
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:40,299
I made a record of everything about you.

1011
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,336
What pleased you, what displeased you.

1012
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,176
And then I pretended to like
everything that you liked.

1013
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:51,931
Music and food, everything.

1014
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,315
And you...

1015
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:59,815
You were as trusting as a lamb.
You didn't have a chance.

1016
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,111
- I cannot believe this.
- Well, it's true.

1017
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,407
Look, I don't know opera from boogie

1018
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:13,119
or Lacrima Christi from Corpus Christi.

1019
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,371
And I loathe the piccolo.

1020
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,246
Dino, if...

1021
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,921
I'm sorry.

1022
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,523
- Anita! When did you get back?
- Last night.

1023
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,438
- Does Maria know?
- Yes.

1024
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,269
Oh, darling, I'm glad to see you.

1025
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,362
We've looked for you
in every hotel in Rome.

1026
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,690
Maria told me.

1027
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,318
I've been in the country
with Giorgio's family.

1028
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,404
We're trying to get Burgoyne
to take Giorgio back.

1029
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,908
I'm sure he'll apologize to you

1030
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,582
for all those nasty suspicions
before you leave.

1031
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,126
He owes me no apology.

1032
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,709
Anyway, I'm going home as planned.

1033
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,381
What about Giorgio?

1034
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,088
What about him?

1035
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,841
Had you thought of staying
and marrying him?

1036
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,349
He doesn't think we should.

1037
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,635
But you're obviously in love with him.

1038
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,887
Well, he's dreadfully poor.

1039
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,562
Even with his job,
he can barely support himself.

1040
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:22,943
He'd have to give up his studies

1041
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,645
or take me to live with his people.

1042
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,860
And he says either way it wouldn't work.

1043
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,489
Well, how do you feel about it?

1044
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,070
Oh, my darling!

1045
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,205
I'm so sorry.

1046
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,786
Is there anything I can do?

1047
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,835
Just leave me alone, please.

1048
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,729
- Well, what are you doing?
- Packing.

1049
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,849
I can see that. But why?

1050
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:03,934
I'm going home.

1051
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:06,562
I'm going back with Anita.

1052
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,490
He hasn't even tried to see me.

1053
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:12,828
Oh, dear.

1054
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,532
Never knew I could feel this way.

1055
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,285
It's pretty awful.

1056
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,584
I know it is. It's awful, for both of you.

1057
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,381
Well, I hope you won't mind
being alone in the apartment,

1058
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,053
but I couldn't stay on, you know.

1059
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,506
Of course not.

1060
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,228
I'm glad I'm not young
and vulnerable anymore.

1061
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,157
Yes?

1062
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,618
I have brought the <i>signorina</i> a present.

1063
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,788
Why, Louisa, how nice of you. Thank you.

1064
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,540
Why, Louisa!

1065
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,538
Whatever made you do this?

1066
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:06,463
Oh, he's a dear little thing.

1067
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,713
We have worried about
your being alone, <i>signorina.</i>

1068
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,711
Is he old enough to be
taken away from his mother?

1069
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:16,014
Oh, yes. My sister say the age is right.

1070
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,969
She's... How do you say? Oh. A maiden lady.

1071
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:23,226
Oh, she has many cats.
She would not be without one.

1072
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,187
She talks to them from morning till night,

1073
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,484
just as if they were people.

1074
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,021
Does she, indeed?

1075
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,524
I will bring you a box to take it home in.

1076
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,779
Thank you, Louisa.

1077
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,931
Oh, no, my friend.

1078
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,605
It hasn't come to that yet.
You're dear and small.

1079
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,487
But I'm not going to turn to you
out of loneliness.

1080
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,486
- Good morning, Miss Frances.
- Good morning.

1081
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,698
- Where did that come from?
- Louisa gave it to me.

1082
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,495
- Why?
- Why shouldn't she?

1083
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,497
All the old maids in Rome have cats.

1084
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,170
I've seen them in the evening,
sitting in the courtyard,

1085
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,918
feeding them leftover spaghetti.

1086
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,091
That sounds rather waspish.

1087
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,793
Will you be able to type up

1088
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,323
last night's pages for me this morning?

1089
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,347
Yes.

1090
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,095
- Is anything the matter?
- No.

1091
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,639
You seem a bit curt this morning.

1092
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,637
I've come to a reluctant decision.

1093
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,017
I'll talk to you about it later.

1094
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:48,315
Moral cowardice?

1095
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:49,818
Very well.

1096
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,562
I've decided I want to go back to America.

1097
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,196
Why?

1098
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,112
Well, why shouldn't I?

1099
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,485
Have I done anything to offend you?

1100
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,579
No.

1101
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,409
Then you have no possible reason

1102
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,956
for wanting to go back to America.

1103
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,409
I've been away for 15 years.
I want to go home.

1104
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,000
- Would you like a holiday?
- No.

1105
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,127
I'd like to finish this work for you.

1106
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,696
Then I'd like to go to the consulate
and have my passport checked.

1107
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,461
Now, see, here, this is nonsense.

1108
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,597
What would you go back to?
You've no relations.

1109
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,099
You'd live alone in a hotel room,

1110
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,392
go to concerts on Sunday,

1111
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,141
and work for some dull-witted
business executive.

1112
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,139
What is attractive about that prospect?

1113
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,608
Nothing.

1114
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,648
- Nevertheless, I am going home.
- Oh.

1115
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:35,938
What about me?

1116
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,398
How am I going to get along without you?

1117
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,943
I've come to depend upon you.

1118
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,784
I dislike change. I dislike new faces.

1119
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,999
Friends of mine are going back,
and I want to go with them.

1120
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,626
Maybe a hotel room alone in New York

1121
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,999
will be hard to take.

1122
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:55,628
But the prospect of becoming
a lonely old maid

1123
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:59,302
with a life behind her,
a stranger in a foreign country,

1124
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,046
isn't much to look forward to either.

1125
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,385
And who knows?

1126
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,765
Perhaps some nice old man
will want to marry me after all.

1127
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:12,099
Have you ever considered
the possibility of marrying me?

1128
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,942
Every woman considers that prospect

1129
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,233
- with every man she meets.
- I'm quite serious.

1130
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,649
I would guarantee you
the companionship you want.

1131
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,868
You've certainly had time
to get used to me.

1132
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,786
There would be no surprises
in store for you.

1133
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,034
You know me too well.

1134
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,661
I have enormous respect for you.
You add greatly to my comfort.

1135
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:36,001
In fact, you're about
the only woman I know

1136
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,004
to whom I would make such a rash offer.

1137
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,724
A marriage... based on friendship?

1138
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,556
The Chinese marry as total strangers.

1139
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:50,182
At least we met.

1140
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,439
And suppose you should
wake up one bright morning

1141
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,439
and discover that I was
desperately in love with you.

1142
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,233
Wouldn't you find that rather disturbing?

1143
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,237
The possibility of arousing
unsuspected passion at my age

1144
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,865
would be not only disturbing,
but rather miraculous.

1145
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,165
Would you care to think this
over for a day or two?

1146
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,248
Are you sure you wouldn't?

1147
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,957
The offer is quite genuine,
if a bit casual.

1148
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:23,466
Then my acceptance is quite casual,

1149
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:25,680
but a bit genuine.

1150
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,683
Thank you.

1151
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,480
I'm sure we'll be quite compatible.

1152
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,983
<i>- Grazie,</i> Anna.
<i>- Prego, signorina.</i>

1153
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,786
- Hi!
- Hi.

1154
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,377
I'm just writing my folks
that I'm bringing you home

1155
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,828
to stay a while with us.

1156
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,671
But I'm not going home after all.

1157
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,917
- But you said this morning...
- That was a hundred years ago.

1158
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:04,669
I've decided to stay and get married.

1159
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,598
- No!
- Isn't it ironic?

1160
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:11,802
You're both so... so young and so lovely,

1161
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,604
but of the three of us
I'm to be the bride.

1162
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,223
- Shadwell?
- Who else?

1163
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,354
No!

1164
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:21,353
Oh, that's wonderful. How did it happen?

1165
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,821
I don't know. I really don't know.

1166
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,361
After being in love with him for 15 years,

1167
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:29,069
this silly man has asked me to marry him.

1168
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,951
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd?

1169
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,033
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Louisa.

1170
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,451
I brought these flowers.

1171
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,112
Will you put them in a vase, please?

1172
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,697
Is Mr. Shadwell up yet?

1173
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:59,201
He's up and gone out. His door was open.

1174
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,456
Have breakfast ready for him.

1175
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,082
He's probably just gone for a walk.

1176
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,708
Yes, <i>signorina</i>.

1177
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,424
Oh, the <i>signorina</i> has a new dress!

1178
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,547
It is very pretty.

1179
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,763
Maybe a little too young.

1180
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:15,308
Oh, it is spring, <i>signorina!</i>

1181
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:32,613
You should have come to me

1182
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,786
the first time this happened, my friend.

1183
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,049
That would hardly
have been possible, Doctor.

1184
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,831
I've had headaches all my life.

1185
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,167
What do I do now?

1186
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,582
I would advise you to go to America.

1187
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,379
Dr. Weisner is there now.

1188
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,415
He has managed, in these cases, to delay...

1189
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,625
No, thank you.

1190
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,003
I have no desire to prolong uncertainty.

1191
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,712
Think about it a while.

1192
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,513
I prefer to think how best to spend

1193
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,057
this year allotted me.

1194
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,681
One is not infallible in matters of time.

1195
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,055
I don't think I should
work today, Dr. Martinelli.

1196
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:07,318
There's never any preparation
for a death sentence, is there?

1197
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,062
There is a lifetime.

1198
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,112
That sounds like something
I might have written.

1199
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,113
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Goodbye.

1200
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,326
Thank you.

1201
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:39,792
<i>Come.</i>

1202
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,457
Mr. Hoyt, there's a gentleman
here to see you about something.

1203
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:43,767
Come in, sir.

1204
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,858
- Thank you. Mr. Hoyt?
- That's me, sir.

1205
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,172
- I'm John Frederick Shadwell.
- Here, won't you sit down?

1206
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,196
Thank you.

1207
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,112
That's interesting.
Same name as the writer.

1208
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:53,406
I am the writer.

1209
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:56,030
You are? Well, I'm one of your fans.

1210
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,406
That's good to hear.

1211
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,474
Looking for material
for a new novel, Mr. Shadwell?

1212
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,705
Just information.

1213
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,579
I want to know what must be done
to ship a body to America.

1214
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:06,795
Well, you've come to the
right man. That's my specialty.

1215
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,248
I handle former citizens.

1216
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,925
- You seem to enjoy your work.
- Oh, I don't mind it.

1217
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,132
Other vice-consuls
have clients who talk back.

1218
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,463
Mine don't.

1219
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,014
An obvious advantage.

1220
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,637
Now then, I should like to know

1221
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:23,344
the exact procedure
in having a body shipped home.

1222
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:26,398
Well, first I must have a letter
making the request.

1223
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,443
- Who writes the letter?
- That's a good question.

1224
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,527
Who writes the letter?

1225
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,318
The regulations say a close relative.

1226
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,030
Then I must have a certificate
from the doctor,

1227
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,025
a notarized report
for the American port of entry,

1228
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,152
then permission from the city of Rome

1229
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:40,866
and an export license.

1230
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,322
It sounds quite complicated.

1231
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,999
Dead or alive, there's still
a lot of red tape to it.

1232
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,616
Well, thank you, Mr. Hoyt.
I shan't detain you any longer.

1233
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:50,209
I assume that this is all just
for a new story of yours.

1234
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,299
- There actually is no body.
- Oh, there's a body, all right.

1235
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,965
- Is there? Whose?
- Mine.

1236
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,591
Good day, sir.

1237
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,558
You were up early this morning.

1238
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,102
- You want your breakfast?
- Not at the moment.

1239
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,279
- I finished these pages.
- Thank you.

1240
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,398
Is anything the matter?

1241
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,363
Miss Frances, I've had a very bad night.

1242
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:20,864
Let me get you some coffee.

1243
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,287
I was quite concerned over
this impulsive discussion we had

1244
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:24,705
about marriage yesterday.

1245
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,449
And this morning I realized

1246
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,409
you could not possibly
have taken me seriously.

1247
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,836
Why not?

1248
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,791
Because you have too much self-respect

1249
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:33,498
to consider seriously the offer of a man

1250
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,632
who is interested only
in keeping his secretary.

1251
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,378
You handled it extremely well,

1252
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,796
and my admiration for your tact
is boundless.

1253
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,391
Should I have reacted otherwise?

1254
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:45,685
No.

1255
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,621
But of course you should
go home, since it is so important to you.

1256
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:51,645
In fact, the sooner you can
make arrangements,

1257
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,317
the more convenient it'll be for me.

1258
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,478
I want to go to Capri for the summer,

1259
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,359
and I'd like to get away
as soon as possible.

1260
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,573
Aren't you going to finish the novel?

1261
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,160
No, I seem to have lost interest
in it at the moment.

1262
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,453
So, if you can book passage,

1263
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,660
I promise not to place
any more embarrassing obstacles

1264
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,036
in your path.

1265
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,253
And you do forgive me
for my selfish panic?

1266
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,123
Of course.

1267
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,240
Yes, <i>signore?</i>

1268
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,073
I should like
a bottle of scotch, some ice,

1269
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,370
and a siphon of soda.

1270
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,039
Sorry, sir. No bottles.

1271
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:13,495
Why not?

1272
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,411
Drinks, yes, but no bottles.

1273
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:18,750
Very well, my friend.

1274
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:22,254
Bring me six double scotches,
and line them up before me.

1275
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,297
Very good, sir.

1276
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,898
Are you, by any chance,
following me, Miss Frances?

1277
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,483
- Yes.
- May I ask why?

1278
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:55,116
Dr. Martinelli called after you left.

1279
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,581
I see.

1280
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,916
Is what you learned from him

1281
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,339
the reason you changed your mind about us?

1282
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,093
I suppose it's quite natural
for you to assume that.

1283
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,387
But the truth is,
it had nothing to do with it.

1284
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,637
It was one of those
unfortunate coincidences.

1285
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,103
Oh.

1286
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:18,932
He told me he suggested
you return to America.

1287
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,651
You will go.

1288
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,231
My dear Miss Frances, my life, my career

1289
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,946
has been founded on
facing facts as I discover them,

1290
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,531
never by wishful thinking.

1291
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,780
I've no intention of seeking
a dubious year of grace.

1292
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,661
But in an extra year's time

1293
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,914
perhaps the doctors will
have discovered an answer.

1294
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,783
Cures must be discovered sometime.

1295
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,119
I shall accept my fate
with as much good grace

1296
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,453
as I can muster.

1297
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,676
What do you intend to do with those?

1298
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,212
I intend to get drunk.

1299
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,424
- Why?
- I've been cautious too long.

1300
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,107
I'm sorry that you've learned about this.

1301
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:03,277
But since you have,

1302
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,769
you can be of great service to me.

1303
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,197
I intend to spend the time
I have left here in Rome,

1304
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:09,740
where I've lived most of my life.

1305
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,369
But, oddly enough,
I want to be buried in America.

1306
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,281
There are numerous details involved

1307
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,411
that I should like to leave
in your capable hands.

1308
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:19,834
Please don't.

1309
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,288
I can't listen when you talk like this.

1310
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,757
Then I shall turn the matter
over to someone less emotional.

1311
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,630
Your greatest asset, Miss Frances,

1312
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,508
has always been your detachment,

1313
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,260
your freedom from sentimentality.

1314
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:36,889
It'd be a pity if you shattered
that record at the end.

1315
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:42,682
And now, if... If you don't mind, I...

1316
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,943
I'd like to be left alone.

1317
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,545
Does the <i>signora</i> care to order?

1318
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:07,665
Yes. Bring me six double scotches, please.

1319
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,505
- Six?
- Six.

1320
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,344
Very good, <i>signora.</i>

1321
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,768
May I ask what you intend to do
with six double scotches?

1322
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:21,812
I intend to drink them.

1323
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:25,058
May I suggest that
you'll live to regret it?

1324
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:26,232
You may.

1325
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,857
- But why six?
- I suspect a trick.

1326
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,191
The Americans have thought of a scheme

1327
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:35,868
to outwit us of our tips.

1328
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,744
I must figure this out.

1329
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:41,578
- How can one save on six drinks?
- Well...

1330
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,558
That'll be all.

1331
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,135
Shall I slap you on the back,
Miss Frances,

1332
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,866
or shall I call the waiter to do it?

1333
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:17,614
Neither.

1334
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:21,618
Shouldn't you be at your desk
attending to my work?

1335
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,743
You've given up. Why shouldn't I?

1336
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:30,001
I had no idea you went in
for this sort of thing.

1337
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,170
I don't, as a rule.

1338
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:34,593
To the Fountain of Trevi.

1339
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,425
To the lovely, romantic Fountain of Trevi,

1340
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,177
where hope can be had for a penny.

1341
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,600
- People are looking at you.
- Well, high time.

1342
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,601
- Do you really think you should?
- I really think I should.

1343
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,056
- Why?
- Because...

1344
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,438
my life is ending.

1345
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,616
<i>Bambino.</i>

1346
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,995
Don't hug the shore with it.
Be... Be reckless.

1347
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,129
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

1348
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:13,749
See what the world is like.

1349
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:19,547
Oh! All right. All right, all right.

1350
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,263
Here, take it.

1351
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:29,269
Take it home
and play with it in the bathtub,

1352
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,108
my brave little adventurer.

1353
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,864
- What do you want?
- Really, Miss Frances.

1354
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,775
Don't you think you're a bit
too old to go wading in public?

1355
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,201
I'm not too old.

1356
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,779
I'm not too old
to do anything I want to do.

1357
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,288
Allow me to assist you

1358
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,624
from that ludicrous and liquid posture.

1359
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,334
Go away. Go away, please.

1360
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:01,673
Give me your hand, then.

1361
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,903
This'll make you feel much better.

1362
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,873
I want my mother.

1363
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,541
You haven't got a mother.

1364
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:32,586
I haven't got anybody.

1365
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:37,542
Nobody cares what happens to me.

1366
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,877
Why didn't you let me drown?

1367
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:44,140
A pity you didn't reveal your
capacity for vice earlier.

1368
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,311
The years would've seemed
much shorter, and well-spent.

1369
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,225
You needn't flatter me.

1370
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,023
Miss Frances, please lie back.

1371
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,975
You're going to feel dreadful later on.

1372
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,440
I feel dreadful now.

1373
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,356
- I've gotta get up.
- Why?

1374
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,075
I've gotta help my friends. They love me.

1375
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:05,448
- Yes. I know.
- They love me very much.

1376
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:08,246
- Oh, poor Giorgio.
- Poor who?

1377
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,416
Oh, don't pretend you don't know.

1378
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,205
I've got to get to Mr. Burgoyne

1379
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,958
and make him give Giorgio his job back.

1380
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:18,416
Anita loves Giorgio,
and Giorgio loves Anita.

1381
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,342
- Yes.
- But you wouldn't understand.

1382
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:23,011
You hate everybody!

1383
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,825
Well, I should certainly
hate to see you make

1384
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,135
a daily habit of this.

1385
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,717
And I've got to talk to Dino.

1386
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:29,677
I want my Maria to have her prince.

1387
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:33,481
Every girl should have a prince.
At least one.

1388
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,524
My dear Miss Frances,

1389
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,192
please try and get a little rest.

1390
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,691
I'll do what I can later,
but in the meantime

1391
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,272
it's important for you to sleep.

1392
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,483
Sing to me.

1393
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,445
The only song I know would
hardly be appropriate.

1394
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,996
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1395
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:51,240
You'd have to stand up, and...

1396
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,713
Do you think you're going to be all right?

1397
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:02,675
Miss Frances?

1398
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:16,978
Sleep.

1399
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:48,718
<i>Signor</i> Shadwell.

1400
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,094
Show him in.

1401
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,308
- Well, John!
- Hello, Dino.

1402
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,394
I come bearing presents.

1403
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,810
You've always wanted
these first editions of mine.

1404
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:02,631
I've decided to give them to you.

1405
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:03,987
But I cannot accept.

1406
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:05,614
But you will.

1407
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:07,278
Well, I'm overwhelmed, John.

1408
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:10,160
Why are you doing this?
Saves my packing them.

1409
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:13,823
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Oh. Off to Capri again, huh?

1410
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:18,332
America. I'm going home
after 15 years. To be married.

1411
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:21,626
- Miss Frances?
- How did you know?

1412
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:25,589
For years, all of Rome has
known how Miss Frances felt.

1413
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:27,965
Should I be surprised?

1414
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:30,965
You should be ashamed.
You might have told me.

1415
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:33,267
It is much better
that you waited, my friend.

1416
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,597
No man should marry until
he is at least your age.

1417
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:39,940
I shall accept that as a compliment.

1418
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,351
- To your happiness.
- Thank you.

1419
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:48,157
Now, at my age, you see,
we have no judgment.

1420
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:51,862
- We feel too deeply.
- I can understand how you feel.

1421
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,530
After all, you've just had a narrow escape

1422
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,365
with that girl at the agency, haven't you?

1423
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,539
- You know about this?
- Oh, all of Rome has known.

1424
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:02,246
She almost tricked you
into marrying her, I understand.

1425
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,422
Do you know what that girl did?

1426
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,629
Kept a little black book
on you, I believe.

1427
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,506
Listed all your likes and dislikes.

1428
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,882
Even to the piccolo!

1429
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:11,801
Only a woman could sink that low.

1430
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:15,475
The duplicity
of this grasping girl!

1431
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,811
Of course, we all grasp at happiness,

1432
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:20,480
but there are such things as rules.

1433
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:23,730
Exactly! I knew you would understand.

1434
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,006
And you're quite right in
letting her go back to America

1435
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,111
without a word.

1436
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,065
She deserves to be unhappy.

1437
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,609
She's going back to America?

1438
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,788
Oh, she knows she did wrong,
so let her suffer for it.

1439
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,708
You're well out of it, my boy.
You've acted like a man.

1440
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:45,210
She deceived me. She... She lied to me.

1441
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,337
Why can't women play the game properly?

1442
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,634
Everyone knows that in love affairs

1443
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,253
only the man has the right to lie.

1444
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:52,428
Naturally.

1445
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:54,552
She was very stupid to confess she lied.

1446
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,386
She didn't have to. Very stupid.

1447
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:02,147
See, to... To disillusion me so...

1448
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:03,849
These girls in love never realize

1449
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,684
they should be honestly dishonest

1450
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,895
instead of being dishonestly honest.

1451
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:12,157
- Do you know what I mean?
- Hmm? Oh, certainly.

1452
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:16,119
So don't let anyone convince you

1453
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:18,322
that you should be flattered
she went to such lengths

1454
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,702
to capture your interest.

1455
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,541
Don't worry. I won't.

1456
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:24,871
Of course, I would be highly flattered.

1457
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,251
But then, I'm an older man.

1458
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,541
- Not much.
- Thank you.

1459
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,758
Well, I'm glad that I leave you
in this happy frame of mind.

1460
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,053
You know what you want, Dino.
Take care of yourself.

1461
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,501
She'll be out of your life tomorrow,

1462
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,269
and you'll never be bothered by her again.

1463
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,579
- Home, <i>Signor</i> Shadwell?
- Not yet.

1464
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:04,125
To the Burgoyne villa. And hurry.

1465
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:05,212
<i>Si, signor.</i>

1466
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:24,059
- I guess that's everything.
- Mm-hmm.

1467
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,899
Well, goodbye, beautiful apartment.

1468
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,269
Goodbye, romantic Rome.

1469
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,029
Goodbye.

1470
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,326
Hello?

1471
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:47,998
Oh, hello.

1472
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,380
Where?

1473
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:53,918
Oh, all right, dear.

1474
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,378
Uh-huh. We were just leaving.

1475
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,348
Bye.

1476
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,133
That was Frances.

1477
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,932
She wants us to meet her
at the Fountain of Trevi.

1478
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:32,423
Why do you suppose Frances
wanted to meet us here?

1479
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:34,591
Oh, maybe she decided
to go back with us after all.

1480
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:36,384
Well, she'd better hurry up.

1481
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,303
Our train leaves in half an hour.

1482
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:40,384
Why, it's empty.

1483
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:50,561
<i>Signor, per che niente acqua?</i>

1484
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,567
<i>- Lo puliscano.</i>
- Oh.

1485
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,270
Why isn't there any water?

1486
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,487
He says they're cleaning the pool.

1487
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:01,573
Clean out the old dreams.
Make way for the new ones.

1488
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:03,782
That fountain is a fraud.

1489
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,539
When I tossed my coin in,

1490
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:09,289
I wished I could stay for a year in Rome.

1491
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,500
And here I am, leaving after a month.

1492
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,673
Well, I'm afraid there's no refund.

1493
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,754
We can't wait around here much longer.

1494
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:18,380
We're going to miss our train.

1495
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:21,050
Oh, here she is.

1496
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,137
Well, what happened to you?
We've been waiting hours.

1497
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:26,844
You couldn't have.
I only phoned you an hour ago.

1498
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,388
You were mighty mysterious.
What's this all about?

1499
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:30,810
It's a surprise.

1500
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:39,899
