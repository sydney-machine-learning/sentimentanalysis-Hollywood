1
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,961
Wow! Bob, take it easy!

2
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:38,473
- Easy? Where does that get you?
- On dry land, I hope!

3
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:47,274
It's doing 150 or better.

4
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,452
He's coming in, believe it or not.

5
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,167
Help Miss Daniels off.

6
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,677
- I'm making another run.
- It's not safe out there!

7
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,310
That's why you'll just watch.

8
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:28,222
- It's starting to kick up, Mr Merrick.
- You keep this engine toned, that's all.

9
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:47,448
What's wrong with him?
Hasn't he got any brains?

10
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:50,544
He doesn't have to.
He's got four million bucks.

11
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,568
He must be doing
better than 180 now.

12
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:27,708
I knew that would happen!

13
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:31,375
Miss Daniels, phone Emergency right
away! Come on, Joe, hurry up!

14
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:47,100
- He's starting to breathe, Bill.
- I'll switch off the ventilator.

15
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:50,306
- That was a close one.
- Bob Merrick just lives right.

16
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,686
- Is that the ambulance?
- Yeah. Nothing more we can do here now.

17
00:03:55,778 --> 00:04:00,025
All right, everybody. There's nothing
to see. You can take off now.

18
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:03,532
181. Come in, 181. 181, come in.

19
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,528
Go ahead.

20
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:11,166
Return the resuscitator to Dr Phillips'
home as soon as possible. Emergency.

21
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,711
181. Understood.

22
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,500
They want the resuscitator
right away, Bill.

23
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,504
Leaving assignment now. Victim being
picked up by a hospital ambulance.

24
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,215
- Return the resuscitator...
- Yes, I know.

25
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,974
Returning the resuscitator
to Dr Phillips.

26
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:40,688
- Did they say why they wanted it?
- Just to rush it back to Dr Phillips' house.

27
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,327
Hurry. Dr Phillips. An accident.

28
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,672
- What's the trouble, Miss Ashford?
- Take it inside to Dr Phillips, Bill.

29
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,424
- Did you see Mrs Phillips' car anywhere?
- No, we didn't.

30
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,051
Oh, I hope they get back in time.

31
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,217
181 reporting.
We're at Dr Phillips'.

32
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,974
Is it too chilly to eat on the terrace? We
could fix the tables with hurricane lamps.

33
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:21,695
Helen, it's a lot of swank for practically
no reason. You bought out half the town.

34
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,197
Isn't a wedding anniversary
enough reason to have a party?

35
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,404
- Wait till you get married.
- But a six months anniversary?

36
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:32,873
I've never been married six months before
and I want to tell the world that I love it.

37
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,830
Shouldn't you have
given Dad some hint?

38
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,503
I should say not! He'd have
nine reasons at the hospital

39
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,667
why he couldn't come
home for dinner.

40
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,128
Wayne can invent an emergency
operation at the drop of a hat

41
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,306
if he knows he's to be the guest
of honour at a dinner party.

42
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,680
Now what's the matter?

43
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,556
I was just thinking of the
toast I'd give you two.

44
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:58,771
To Wayne Phillips, a great surgeon,
a fine man and my wonderful father.

45
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,565
And to you. Love and
affection to my mother.

46
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,525
Mother? Oh, Joyce, you wouldn't.

47
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,863
You married my father. You're certainly
the only mother I've ever known.

48
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,195
And I'm all in favour
of the arrangement.

49
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,167
I sure feel sorry for them.

50
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,433
Oh, Joyce, it's so pleasant. We can have
dinner outside without any trouble at all.

51
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,138
- Helen...
- Nancy, what are you doing over here?

52
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,473
- Oh, Helen...
- What's the matter?

53
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,061
- It's Wayne.
- What?

54
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,394
He's had an accident.
Dr Dodge is with him.

55
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:46,157
- Where is he?
- Here. Oh, Helen...

56
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,072
Helen...

57
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:59,034
- Wayne had an attack and...
- No.

58
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,204
Dad!

59
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,835
Those poor girls.

60
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:15,432
He was such a wonderful man.

61
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,726
He did so much for people.

62
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:23,229
Why, Dr Dodge? Why?

63
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,439
How many times I've been
asked that question.

64
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,856
I've never learned the answer.

65
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:34,151
Nancy, you go in with her.

66
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,295
Joyce, I know there's
nothing I can say.

67
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,959
What happened, Derwin?

68
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:53,181
Nancy and I had come from the hospital
to go sailing with him this afternoon.

69
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,967
He must have had the occlusion just
a few minutes before we got here.

70
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:00,680
We saw him down at the
pier, all slumped over.

71
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:06,737
- The resuscitator didn't help at all?
- No. It wasn't here.

72
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,695
- It wasn't here?!
- No.

73
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:13,740
But Dad's kept it here for years because
he had a coronary. You knew that.

74
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,319
In heaven's name, where was it?

75
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,450
Bob Merrick capsized his boat
at the other end of the lake.

76
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:23,706
- The police came for it just before this...
- Bob Merrick!

77
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:28,038
Oh, you don't know him. I do.

78
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:33,296
He's a stupid, spoilt darn fool.

79
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,770
And now, to think Bob Merrick is
alive because of Dad's resuscitator

80
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,179
and Dad is dead...

81
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,349
I could kill him!

82
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,484
Helen...

83
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,950
Helen...

84
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:07,463
I loved him so much, Derwin.

85
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,218
With all my heart.

86
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:14,169
And we only had these few
short months together.

87
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:48,584
I don't know how you're supposed to do it.
Just take the barge out and get her up.

88
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:51,294
Don't bother me with
excuses. Get it done.

89
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,136
When does Campbell
get in from Detroit?

90
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,589
I don't want anybody else touching
those engines. Don't argue.

91
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:02,261
- If I may take your temperature.
- Nonsense. I'm not even lukewarm.

92
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:07,015
That's better. And have Jerry call me as
soon as he hears about the insurance.

93
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,773
- Am I getting out of here today?
- The very instant you're able to leave

94
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,151
we shall be happy to
sign your discharge.

95
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:16,359
- But first...
- This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy.

96
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:20,947
A small respiratory infection, a slight
concussion, but no subdural clot.

97
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,416
A subdural clot, Doctor, is a haematoma
anywhere in the cranial cavity.

98
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:29,546
Thank you. I merely wondered where
you acquired that piece of information.

99
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:32,585
Let me have a line. I was in med
school when my father died.

100
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,335
I haven't wasted all my time.

101
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,752
Why did you quit?
Too rough for a Merrick?

102
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,468
I'll tell you why.
My father died at 42...

103
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,301
Hello. Val?

104
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,851
Who?

105
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,394
No.

106
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:48,773
Suddenly it seemed sensible to enjoy life
while I could. Let me have another line.

107
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:52,227
My, how you've succeeded

108
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:59,192
Hello, Val. How have
you been, baby?

109
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:04,867
Don't go in, Nancy. You have to make a
formal request to take his temperature.

110
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,662
When I think Dr Phillips died
so that he could live.

111
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,124
Yes. What a complete waste.

112
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,080
- Have you talked to Helen today?
- No. Not since yesterday.

113
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:18,759
She's coming over this morning to
go through the doctor's things.

114
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,262
You can count on it, baby.
It's a date. Goodbye.

115
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:29,814
Would you do me a favour? Get Dr Phillips
down here to look at me so I can get out.

116
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,315
- Here.
- Look, I haven't got a temperature.

117
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,645
It's immaterial to me, Mr Merrick,

118
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:40,696
but I'm going to take your
temperature one way or another.

119
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,620
- A human being.
- Under the tongue, please.

120
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,781
Where have you been all week?

121
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:48,874
What kind of an establishment
is this? Will you tell me?

122
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,661
I've been here five days and I'm
treated like a leper. No visitors.

123
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,507
- It seemed advisable.
- My doctor doesn't even come.

124
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,083
No, when Dr Albert
talked to Dr Dodge,

125
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:02,222
he agreed the case didn't warrant his
coming up. He's very busy in New York.

126
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,806
Then why don't I get Wayne Phillips?
It's his hospital, isn't it?

127
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:08,266
It's obvious I get to pay his bill.

128
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:13,396
- Don't look shocked. I'm used to it.
- I wasn't shocked, Mr Merrick.

129
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,189
- I was only thinking.
- You were thinking what?

130
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,442
I was thinking, when your father left
you the Merrick Motor Company millions,

131
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:24,697
what a pity he couldn't also bequeath
you a little common courtesy.

132
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:28,322
I don't know where you got those
pyjamas, or these cigarettes...

133
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,370
your pharyngitis is bad
enough without them.

134
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:36,039
In words of one syllable, Mr
Merrick, you talk too much.

135
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:41,471
Now that's settled, how about getting Doc
Phillips to give me my separation papers?

136
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:45,599
The reason the staff may have
seemed so distant, Mr Merrick,

137
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:48,518
is that Dr Phillips
died a few days ago.

138
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:53,598
It was rather sudden and he was
quite admired by all of us.

139
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:58,400
- All you had to do was tell me.
- It hasn't been easy to talk about.

140
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:02,023
When will I get out? I have too
many things to do that can't wait.

141
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:05,034
I can't say. Perhaps in a few days.

142
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,457
Wanna bet?

143
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,044
Brightwood Hospital.

144
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:22,925
- Miss Phillips, these came this morning.
- Oh, thanks.

145
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,676
- Is Mrs Phillips in?
- Yes, she is.

146
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:32,056
They're still coming. Amazing,
isn't it? Oh, I'm sorry.

147
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:36,559
Yes, thank you. All right,
we'll see you. Goodbye.

148
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,111
That was Tom. He's in the
village and coming over.

149
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,652
He seemed a little more
urgent than he had to be.

150
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,034
I suspect that lawyer of mine just
wanted to spend the afternoon with you.

151
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,820
Dottore Vittorio Laradetti, Rome.

152
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:55,376
I had no idea there were so many
people who respected Dad so much.

153
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:58,961
And who felt so much in his debt.
From all over the country.

154
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:01,124
From all over the world.

155
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,843
Listen to this, Joyce.

156
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:08,970
"Dear Mrs Dr Phillips, you don't know me,
but I owe everything to Dr Phillips."

157
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,051
Yes, come in.

158
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,770
Sorry, but there's another lady
here to see you. A Mrs Eden.

159
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,933
She says she has to talk to you.

160
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:22,070
- Want me to talk to her?
- No... Have her come in, Nancy.

161
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,732
- Mrs Eden.
- Thank you.

162
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,314
- Mrs Phillips, Mrs Eden.
- How do you do, my dear?

163
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,493
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

164
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,538
We'll have to be very firm
about visitors, for her sake.

165
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:38,789
Yesterday afternoon there were eight.
This morning it's beginning again.

166
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,916
Apparently Dad had helped
them meet some crisis.

167
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:45,424
- Money?
- No, not always. Sometimes just advice.

168
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:50,173
But when you try to pin them down as
to how they became indebted to Dad,

169
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:55,890
they stammer and dodge, as though they
belonged with him to some secret society.

170
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,602
It's strange.

171
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:03,152
Dr Phillips insisted
that it be kept secret.

172
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:07,366
But now that he's dead, I suppose
I can talk about it, don't you?

173
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,648
Certainly.

174
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:13,868
It came to $4,000 all together,
and I want to pay you back.

175
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,792
Why didn't you return
it to Dr Phillips?

176
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,913
Oh, my dear, I tried so many
times, but he wouldn't take it.

177
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:23,124
He'd become excited and say,
"You haven't told anyone?"

178
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:25,588
I'd say, "Of course not.
You told us not to."

179
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:31,347
Then he'd say, "That's right, Mrs Eden.
Any help I give you is just between us."

180
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:36,260
- And he wouldn't let you repay it?
- He said he couldn't because...

181
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,975
he'd already used it all up.

182
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:42,730
And then he'd say to invest it.
"Invest in what?" I'd say.

183
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,274
And he'd say, "Any poor devil."

184
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:47,901
Wasn't that strange?

185
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:52,154
Mrs Eden, what did he mean
when he said "used it all up"?

186
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:55,365
I've tried to think so many times.

187
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:58,208
Don't you know, Mrs Phillips?

188
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:03,667
No. It's very odd. In four letters this
week, there's exactly the same expression.

189
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,710
But it is a debt, and I
want to take care of it.

190
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,375
You don't owe me
anything, Mrs Eden.

191
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,136
If Dr Phillips couldn't accept
this, then neither can I.

192
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:17,269
Well... if that's what you
want, Mrs Phillips, but...

193
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:20,888
You keep it and use it...
for any poor devil.

194
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:23,224
All right.

195
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,102
He was a very remarkable
man, wasn't he?

196
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:29,273
Yes, he was.

197
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:35,321
Perhaps more remarkable
than any of us knew.

198
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:04,768
- Hello, darling. How are you?
- Much better now that you're here.

199
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,062
- How's Helen feeling?
- Oh, you know.

200
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:12,900
- Oh, golly, Tom. I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

201
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,244
Hello, Tom. Thank you for
coming all this way.

202
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,716
Helen. I wish I'd been able to come
up Sunday, but I've been swamped.

203
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:34,550
I wanted to talk to both
of you about the estate.

204
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,308
The estate? I hadn't
even thought of it.

205
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:40,179
Neither had I. I should have
been a better attorney.

206
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,644
I've made a complete survey
of Wayne's finances, and I...

207
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:51,902
- I doubt you'll have any money at all.
- Not even insurance?

208
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,237
Wayne had a $100,000 policy,
but he borrowed the maximum on it.

209
00:17:56,327 --> 00:18:00,455
- The rest might pay the taxes and debts.
- But what happened, Tom?

210
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,457
But some of Dad's fees...
the Talleyrand operation...

211
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:08,501
When Wayne removed the neoplasm from
the Talleyrand boy, he received $25,000.

212
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,465
It was all withdrawn within seven weeks
in four cheques, all made out to "cash".

213
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:18,131
The account's full of cash withdrawals.
Where did all this money go, Helen?

214
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:21,593
Wayne didn't discuss money with me.
I really wouldn't know.

215
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:24,936
That leaves you and Joyce with
the house and little else.

216
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:28,273
And the hospital is liable to
be in very rocky shape too.

217
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,732
Can't something be worked out, Tom?

218
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,652
I want to go over his records and find
out what other assets he might have.

219
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:37,232
Those you'll let me
collect for you, that is.

220
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:40,826
And after that, well, we'll
see where you stand exactly.

221
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:43,914
Well, thank you very much
for all your trouble.

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
And you do as you feel best.

223
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:49,288
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

224
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,007
I have to go to the house. The gardener's
confused about what bulbs to lift this fall.

225
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:57,047
I promised I'd do it.
It can't wait any longer.

226
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,890
I'll see you both at the house.

227
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:25,072
- Can I help?
- I suspect you could help... tremendously.

228
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,659
Are you all right?

229
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,285
Adequate as can be.

230
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:34,417
- Going to the village?
- Yes. Can I give you a lift?

231
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,133
You certainly can.

232
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,710
I'll make it. I'll make it.

233
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:48,394
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Long story. You wouldn't be interested.

234
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:55,518
You live around here?

235
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,942
Yes.

236
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,116
I should have collapsed on
one of these roads long ago.

237
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,865
- I meant it in the nicest way.
- I'm sure you did.

238
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:07,953
- You don't sound like it.
- I'm sorry, but I have a lot on my mind.

239
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,118
That's all right. So do I.

240
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,545
Can't we talk about it better
after I take you to lunch?

241
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,707
I think not.

242
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:24,172
Before you decide I'm just a character
who stumbled out of the woods, Miss P...

243
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:27,517
Monogram on your purse.
20/20. Always keep 'em open.

244
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:30,605
My name is Phillips...
Mrs Wayne Phillips.

245
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,726
Oh.

246
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,441
I'm sorry, Mrs Phillips.

247
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,362
You know, I just heard
about your husband.

248
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:45,947
I'm really sorry. He must have
been a really great person.

249
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,708
It's a rough way to go.

250
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,365
Maybe they'll get another
resuscitator now.

251
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,331
Resuscitator? Did they
try to use one on him?

252
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:57,873
We'd have had his at the house, but
there was an accident on the lake

253
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,375
and the police took it there.

254
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,676
You mean...

255
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:05,302
the accident Bob Merrick had?

256
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:08,722
Yes. Bob Merrick.

257
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:14,270
So...

258
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,977
Bob Merrick is alive,

259
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,941
and only because your husband...

260
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,196
Let me out up here, will you?

261
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:32,450
- Thanks.
- Are you sure you're all right?

262
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:57,810
He can't have just disappeared.
Miss O'Malley, flash Dr Dodge.

263
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:00,227
All right, thanks.

264
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:01,863
There's work to do.

265
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:06,242
Have Dr Dodge report to the
front desk immediately.

266
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:12,531
- Helen. What's the matter?
- I just gave a man a ride on the lake road.

267
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,951
He's in shock or exhausted.
He's in the car.

268
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:17,120
Frank, get a stretcher.

269
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,253
It's Bob Merrick.

270
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,172
Who?

271
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:33,850
Come on. I want you to rest
a little while, Helen.

272
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:38,018
It's... It just came
before I was ready for it.

273
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,185
I know, darling.

274
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:45,194
- I'm all right, Nancy.
- Don't talk about it.

275
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:50,072
Come in and lie down
a little while.

276
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:56,251
I don't know, Nancy.
Maybe it's just as well.

277
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,916
I'll never have to see him again.

278
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,677
Brightwood Hospital.

279
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:15,468
Mrs Phillips?
I'm sorry, I can't ring her.

280
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,761
Yes, Mr Merrick?

281
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,730
- Is my bill ready?
- Yes, sir.

282
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:23,028
Mrs Phillips is in Dr Phillips' office
and she's asked me to hold her calls.

283
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:26,944
Thank you. I will give Mrs
Phillips your message.

284
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:30,360
Your bill, Mr Merrick.

285
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,046
You've answered so many questions that
have been puzzling me, Mr Randolph.

286
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:53,385
Several people in the last few days
have mentioned Wayne's way of life.

287
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:58,601
And when they talk about "using it all up",
I had no idea what they meant.

288
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,062
I'm so happy that
you could tell me.

289
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,517
You don't talk much
about this belief.

290
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,984
When someone's ready for
it, they accept it.

291
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:12,447
Perhaps Wayne felt you weren't ready...
or that you were pretty perfect without it.

292
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,411
Well, I must be going.

293
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:18,329
Wayne mentioned so many times how
anxious he was for me to meet you.

294
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:20,743
I'm sorry it was under
these circumstances.

295
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:25,380
I flew up from Mexico as soon as I heard.
I thought possibly I might be able to...

296
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:28,337
Make it a little easier for me?
Well, you have.

297
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:29,708
Thank you.

298
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:33,754
- We'll be seeing you very soon, I hope.
- Yes. I'll be back in my studio now.

299
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,262
Mrs Phillips,
I want to talk to you.

300
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,929
- I'm very busy.
- Oh, I was just leaving.

301
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,895
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, and thank you.

302
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,240
You and I don't have
anything to talk about.

303
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:57,164
- I know how you feel about me.
- Please leave me alone.

304
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,324
Your husband was an
eminent surgeon.

305
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:04,542
Everybody's saying that a character like me
is still around while your husband is...

306
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,707
Here.

307
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:13,002
- And what is that supposed to do?
- Supposed to do?

308
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:15,173
Most people'd be
very glad to get it.

309
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:17,971
Will paying thousands help
you forget it happened?

310
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:22,390
It's all very simple to you... a cheque
can take care of anything, any time.

311
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:25,317
Most people would be very
happy to receive $25,000.

312
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,355
Was it my fault? I didn't ask
you for your resuscitator.

313
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,818
Smash up somebody's car,
write out a cheque.

314
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:33,362
Get in a mess with a showgirl,
write out a cheque.

315
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:37,401
And when a man dies, write out a cheque
to his widow... account paid in full.

316
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,988
- Listen...
- Leave me alone!

317
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:55,174
When you go to Mexico City,
you must hear Rosario.

318
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:59,476
His voice is just divine.
It does things for me.

319
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:03,095
Good for you. But he doesn't
sound like my type.

320
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:04,220
Pardon me.

321
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:07,649
It's one of the most beautiful
things I've ever seen.

322
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,820
- The owner must have spent a fortune.
- Good for him.

323
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:15,199
It's got all kinds of gadgets.
It's got... red-spoke wheels...

324
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:22,072
What did they do to
you in that joint?

325
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:26,116
I know your big trouble, honey.
You need Val to take care of you.

326
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,166
The principal
difficulty seems to be,

327
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:35,046
the anaesthetics you get in these bars are
never as effective as the customer hopes.

328
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,258
- What, honey?
- Good night, baby.

329
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:46,311
- How about a drink, Val?
- No, thank you.

330
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:54,606
- Don't you want to take me home?
- That's an interesting idea.

331
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:57,819
I'll call you.
So long and farewell.

332
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:33,499
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you this time of night.

333
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,294
I just clobbered my car
in the ditch. Look.

334
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:39,053
That's all right. Come in.

335
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:42,387
Thank you for your hospitality.

336
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:46,720
It's a nice place you have here.
A very nice place indeed.

337
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:50,145
- Are you all right?
- Me? Of course.

338
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:54,063
It takes more than pranging up a car
to incapacitate old Bob Merrick,

339
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:55,895
pride of the Merrick clan.

340
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,861
You're Bob Merrick, eh?

341
00:28:57,947 --> 00:29:00,355
- Who are you?
- Edward Randolph.

342
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,494
- How do you... Who?
- It's all right. I live here.

343
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:11,293
Edward... may I please bother you...
for a telephone, please?

344
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:12,955
- Of course.
- Wait a minute.

345
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,963
Gotta call somebody to
come and pick me up.

346
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,667
- Must tell 'em to wear their safety belts.
- Right back here.

347
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:22,252
- Where?
- Right back here.

348
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:24,423
Oh.

349
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,678
Go slow.

350
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:36,944
Hello?

351
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,606
Hello there.

352
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:42,315
- Ed, did you do these pictures?
- Yes.

353
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:43,440
Nice.

354
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:46,108
As far as I'm concerned,
Art is just a guy's name.

355
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,280
- Williams?
- Shouldn't you dial?

356
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:50,033
Shh! Williams.

357
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,829
This is Robert Merrick Esquire.

358
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,913
I had a little trouble with my car. Would
you come over and pick me up, please?

359
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,881
Williams?

360
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:03,668
Don't snore, old man. Wake up.

361
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:07,262
Hardest thing these days,
getting good help.

362
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,553
Very nice job.

363
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:16,066
Where have we met? Don't tell
me, don't tell me. I met you...

364
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:21,900
- Is that?
- It's a portrait I did of Wayne Phillips.

365
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,066
Phillips.

366
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:26,985
Phillips.

367
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:31,580
He's the man who's haunting me.

368
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,709
You know what?

369
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:40,007
I almost drowned, but a resuscitator
saved me. Whose is it? Dr Phillips'.

370
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:44,219
They shoot me to a hospital to make old
Merrick good for another 20,000 miles.

371
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,759
Whose hospital? Dr Phillips'.

372
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:50,264
Then I meet her. A girl.
A girl who is...

373
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,593
a very beautiful girl.

374
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:56,305
Whose wife is she? One guess, pal.

375
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,566
- Now look here, Merrick...
- Tell me where we've met.

376
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,487
In the hospital.
In Dr Phillips' office.

377
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:04,648
Dr Phillips.

378
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,026
You see?

379
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:11,242
He is haunting me.

380
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:06,134
- I'm glad you made it.
- I'm not sure I have.

381
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:08,295
Try this anyway.

382
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:15,720
Do you mind telling
me what happened?

383
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,141
Oh... I wrecked the
car, in a ditch.

384
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:24,859
Yes. The right front wheel. I called your
house and asked someone to come over.

385
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:27,567
- I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

386
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:30,230
- Think a shower'd help?
- I certainly do.

387
00:32:30,326 --> 00:32:33,446
Make it a cold one. Up those
stairs and to the right.

388
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,614
Thanks a lot.

389
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,872
I hope I wasn't too much
trouble last night.

390
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:49,637
When I pass out, I usually
like to be in my own bed.

391
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:51,345
No trouble.

392
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:56,223
Oh, I know where I saw you.
With Helen Phillips.

393
00:32:56,311 --> 00:33:00,143
That's right, Merrick.
Will you take these?

394
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:08,062
- Have you known her long?
- No.

395
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:12,070
But Wayne Phillips was
the best friend I had.

396
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,903
Coffee's ready.

397
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:16,486
Yes, the portrait you did of him.

398
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,333
It's really good.
You're quite a painter.

399
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:21,623
Well, maybe I am now.

400
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:25,839
If so, I have Phillips to thank. He's
the one who unlocked everything.

401
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:28,331
- Phillips did?
- Yes. I met him some years ago

402
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:32,376
when I was still trying to find my
way in painting, getting nowhere.

403
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:36,801
I spent my life making fairly
adequate copies of the masters.

404
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:39,562
I always wanted to
create like they did.

405
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,934
But I just never could.

406
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:44,644
Until Phillips showed me
how to get what I wanted.

407
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:47,605
How did he do that?
How could a surgeon help?

408
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,771
Well, he taught me...

409
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:54,857
He showed me how to establish contact
with a source of infinite power.

410
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:57,989
That sounds fine.
What does it mean?

411
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,453
Well, let me put it this way.

412
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,535
This lamp isn't working now.

413
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:08,586
It's cold, and it's dark. All the parts
are there, it's a perfect light, but...

414
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:10,584
- It's just not turned on.
- Right.

415
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:14,840
But if I turn the switch
and establish contact,

416
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:17,552
the bulb will draw power
from the powerhouse

417
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:20,678
and it'll do what it was meant
to do, which is to make light.

418
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,139
So you're saying that people
have a sort of powerhouse too.

419
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:27,767
Establish contact with that and you
can do what you're meant to do.

420
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:32,772
- You can fulfil your destiny.
- I can turn on a light.

421
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:35,902
I don't think that's your destiny.

422
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:39,363
- Do you?
- No, I guess not.

423
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:44,794
Assuming there is a power of some kind,
how do you establish contact with it?

424
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,006
It's very simple: Just be
of real service to people.

425
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,498
Find people who need
help, and help them.

426
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:54,344
But always in secret.
Never let it be known.

427
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,587
And never ask to be repaid.

428
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,137
But why does it have
to be kept secret?

429
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:03,934
That's probably the most
important part of this belief.

430
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:06,347
Let's go back to the powerhouse.

431
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:10,818
If the wires in the dynamo are
not protected by insulation,

432
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,940
the power will be dissipated.
The same goes for us.

433
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:18,029
Most personalities are just grounded.
That's all that ails them.

434
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,037
I see. You mean keeping
these good deeds secret

435
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:23,827
is like insulating the
power of your personality.

436
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:29,871
- Yeah, that's near enough.
- If it works, fine. Obviously it helped you.

437
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,634
Isn't there anything in
the world that you need

438
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:35,504
that you haven't been able
to get in the ordinary way?

439
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:37,671
Not a thing.

440
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,465
Except...

441
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,513
I'd like to square myself
with Helen Phillips.

442
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:45,517
Oh?

443
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:51,690
But if I just help out some poor joker, why
does it follow that she'll listen to me?

444
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:55,194
I think you might be
surprised at what follows

445
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:57,855
after trying this way of life.

446
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:06,205
Well, if it's as simple as all that,
why, I'll certainly give it a chance.

447
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,579
Wait, Merrick.

448
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,047
Don't try this unless you're ready. You
can't just try it for a week like a new car.

449
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:17,296
And if you think you can feather your
own nest with it, just forget it.

450
00:36:17,387 --> 00:36:20,590
Besides, this is dangerous stuff.

451
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,555
One of the first men who used it

452
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:28,476
went to the cross at the age of 33.

453
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,937
Excuse me.

454
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,860
- Won't you come in, please?
- I understand that Mr Merrick...

455
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:45,618
- I'm here, Williams.
- Good morning, Mr Merrick.

456
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:52,045
Well, goodbye. And thanks. You take
good care of a drunk and his hangover.

457
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,795
I ought to know how by this time.
I've been there myself.

458
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:24,076
Mr Merrick! It's good to
see you around again.

459
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:25,989
Hello, Dan.

460
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,156
No. Another look you owe me.

461
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:31,914
- How's the family?
- Not so hot. We lost the baby, you know.

462
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:34,708
- Oh?
- The missus is still in the hospital.

463
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:39,625
- The bills are pretty rough.
- I'm sorry to hear it, Dan.

464
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:53,606
- Say, Dan.
- Yes, Mr Merrick?

465
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:56,396
How much do you need
for all the expenses?

466
00:37:56,486 --> 00:37:58,977
About $300 would do it.

467
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:03,651
- Mr Merrick...
- It's yours. On two conditions.

468
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:05,819
- Anything.
- Don't tell anybody.

469
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:08,699
- I've got to tell my wife.
- No, not even your wife.

470
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,791
And never try to pay it back.
I don't want it.

471
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:13,536
- Anything you say.
- Good.

472
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:16,997
But this is sure a funny way
to help a guy out, isn't it?

473
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,007
I think you're absolutely right.

474
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:28,047
- I don't believe it!
- Your order, Mr Merrick?

475
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:30,472
It does work.

476
00:38:30,562 --> 00:38:34,939
Thank you, Phyllis. Joyce and I will see
you again soon. We won't hibernate.

477
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,562
- I'm glad of that.
- Goodbye.

478
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:42,906
Mrs Phillips. This is more than just a
coincidence. I've got to talk to you.

479
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:46,525
- I was just leaving.
- You have two minutes, haven't you?

480
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,412
Perhaps I wasn't as diplomatic as I could
have been, but I did mean well, really.

481
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:55,331
We've all been under a strain. Sorry
if I said anything I shouldn't have.

482
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,627
What I can't understand is how we've
avoided knowing each other before this.

483
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,709
It wasn't intentional,
I assure you.

484
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:05,922
I think we ought to correct
that mistake. Don't you?

485
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:08,172
Of course. I'm very late.

486
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:11,009
Mrs Phillips.

487
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:14,553
We haven't decided where we're
going to have dinner tonight.

488
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:18,182
I have a previous engagement.
Excuse me.

489
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:22,232
Please don't go!

490
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:25,192
I'd like to ask you... about
this theory of Dr Phillips'

491
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:27,739
that Edward Randolph
was telling me about.

492
00:39:27,827 --> 00:39:31,492
- Why would he talk to you about it?
- I guess he believes in it.

493
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,154
I guess I'm starting to,
after meeting you here.

494
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,243
What has meeting me
got to do with it?

495
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:39,206
Well, I... I just did something.

496
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,958
I'm going to go find somebody that
needs a couple of thousand bucks

497
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:45,843
and my worries will be over.

498
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:51,054
I think you've twisted my husband's
beliefs into something very cheap.

499
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:53,218
Taxi!

500
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:56,054
Wait a minute!

501
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:01,065
- 15 Lake Drive, please.
- Mrs Phillips.

502
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:06,280
- I wouldn't offend you for the world.
- Just drive on.

503
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,699
- Wait here. Mrs Phillips...
- Please don't start a scene.

504
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:12,573
I'm only trying to tell you that...

505
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,207
Look out!

506
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:33,348
Brightwood Hospital.

507
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:36,139
The line is busy. Will you hold?

508
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:40,514
I'll try to locate him for you.

509
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,726
Brightwood Hospital.

510
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:44,895
I'll take a message.

511
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,530
I can connect you now.

512
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,862
Brightwood Hospital.

513
00:40:57,292 --> 00:41:00,079
- Is there any chance at all?
- No.

514
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:03,999
How about the x-ray findings?

515
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,957
They leave no hope.
She's lucky to be alive.

516
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:10,341
Will you tell them, Nancy?

517
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,299
- All right.
- Thank you.

518
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,929
Miss Ashford...

519
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:21,974
Joyce.

520
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:24,392
She's going to live.

521
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:27,652
And she'll be all right in time?

522
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:30,656
Not completely. There's
an inoperable lesion.

523
00:41:30,742 --> 00:41:33,149
- What is it?
- Where?

524
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:35,118
Well... Her eyes.

525
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:37,778
Tell me, Nancy.
Let me have it straight.

526
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:39,534
She'll be blind.

527
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:42,295
- Blind?
- It can't be.

528
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,915
Oh, no!

529
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:51,800
- Miss Ashford, could I see her?
- Haven't you done enough?!

530
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:55,506
- Joyce...
- It's the truth. Why shouldn't I say it?

531
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:02,053
She'll never see again, thanks to you.
Write a cheque for that, Mr Merrick!

532
00:42:24,462 --> 00:42:27,167
No, Nancy. No.

533
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:30,507
Darling, don't you think if
you just talk to him once...

534
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:35,054
What good would it do?
What could he possibly say?

535
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:38,093
And what difference
would it make now?

536
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:44,098
I don't blame him for
anything, Nancy.

537
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,270
It's just that I feel it's better
if I don't see him at all.

538
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:51,860
Well... I'll send him away.

539
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:05,994
I'm sorry, Mr Merrick.

540
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,373
She won't see you.

541
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:29,352
Nancy?

542
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:31,602
Yes, darling.

543
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,483
I know I'm right.

544
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:36,780
He'll finally give up.

545
00:44:00,391 --> 00:44:03,428
- Your things are on the beach, Helen.
- Thank you, Nancy.

546
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,845
- Is Judy there?
- Yes. She's waiting for us.

547
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:08,726
- Call me when you're ready to go down.
- I will.

548
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:11,105
- Some more tea, Helen?
- Yes, thank you.

549
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:12,937
- Is Nancy staying with you?
- No.

550
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:16,113
She comes and takes me down
to the beach, picks me up later,

551
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,868
whenever she can get
away from the hospital.

552
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:22,949
- I'm going to miss you terribly, Ed.
- Well, I hate to say goodbye.

553
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:25,328
But I've refused the
gallery so many times,

554
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:28,287
and I do have to be in Chicago
at least once this year.

555
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:33,040
You've been wonderful all these months,
and I apologise for being a handful.

556
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:35,006
Uh-uh, Helen. Quiet.

557
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:38,793
Well, I'd have thrown me in the
drink if I were me. Thank you.

558
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:44,390
But, Ed, I get so tired of
learning how to eat and dressing

559
00:44:44,477 --> 00:44:46,802
and finding out where
the heck things are.

560
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:51,357
I get so tense, and then I'm
a problem to everybody.

561
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:54,479
Of course you have to have
people around to help you.

562
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:57,240
So do several geniuses
that I could mention.

563
00:44:57,323 --> 00:44:59,695
But you're such a good friend.

564
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:02,405
- And don't forget that.
- No.

565
00:45:02,495 --> 00:45:05,282
Sorry I had to miss Joyce.
Say goodbye for me.

566
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:08,908
Yes, I will. She's in town. It's
about that accident insurance.

567
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:11,374
Thank goodness for that.
It's kept us going.

568
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:14,167
Well, goodbye.
You'll be hearing from me.

569
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:15,917
God bless you.

570
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:18,167
- I'll get Nancy.
- No, not yet.

571
00:45:18,261 --> 00:45:20,669
Where's my radar?

572
00:45:21,598 --> 00:45:26,260
No, no, no. As a farewell present for
you, I'm going to try something.

573
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:32,103
For the first time, in your honour,
down to the cove all by myself.

574
00:45:32,192 --> 00:45:36,141
- But you've never gone down there alone.
- Well, it's about time I start.

575
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:39,902
- I'd better go partway with you.
- Oh, no. Just stay and watch.

576
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:42,743
I know these steps by heart.

577
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:45,152
One...

578
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:47,702
two...

579
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,822
three...

580
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:51,493
Helen?

581
00:45:52,545 --> 00:45:54,621
Where did Helen go?

582
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:04,465
- That's progress for you.
- It's remarkable!

583
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:11,847
Judy!

584
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,016
Hi, Helen!

585
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:18,985
Say, what do you know!

586
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:22,405
- You started exploring by yourself!
- How about that!

587
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:26,324
- I'm sorry I'm late, Judy.
- Me too. I gotta get back early.

588
00:46:26,412 --> 00:46:30,244
I thought you weren't coming, so I
went ahead and read the whole chapter.

589
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:33,251
Serves me right for being late.
What happened?

590
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:37,464
Well, old Huckleberry's on
this crazy raft with Jim,

591
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:40,503
and they run into this
old, deserted houseboat.

592
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,511
- Huck... Here's a step.
- Oh. Thank you.

593
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:46,266
One, two, three, four, five steps.

594
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,350
Now let's see.
Where was I? Oh, yes.

595
00:46:49,435 --> 00:46:52,009
Huck thinks maybe they
can scrounge something,

596
00:46:52,105 --> 00:46:56,399
so he starts to investigate in
all this dirt and disorder.

597
00:46:56,484 --> 00:47:01,645
He opens this door and finds two fellas
talking in a very rough fashion.

598
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:05,405
Well, here we are.
Take it easy, now.

599
00:47:06,953 --> 00:47:09,989
These characters are
very hostile indeed.

600
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:11,492
And?

601
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:15,082
Tune in tomorrow,
same time, same station.

602
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,961
Shall do.

603
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,169
What's going on out
on the lake, Judy?

604
00:47:19,257 --> 00:47:21,962
Oh, I'd say there's
about a ten-knot blow,

605
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,551
and about a half-dozen
snipes having a race.

606
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:29,303
And a couple of stars foolin'
around by the yacht club.

607
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:33,472
And a real gone daddy zoomin'
around with his inboard.

608
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:38,355
Aw, some babe's water-skiing.
Not so hot. She's usin' both hands.

609
00:47:38,443 --> 00:47:41,563
- Sounds like a big day.
- Yeah!

610
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:44,988
Hate to rush, Helen, but OK
if I do the newspaper now?

611
00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:46,948
Sure. But what's the hurry?

612
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:50,569
Mother stuck me with Susan
Shacker's birthday party.

613
00:47:50,663 --> 00:47:53,700
Can you imagine me in a dress?

614
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:57,575
Well... In Europe,
things aren't so hot.

615
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,624
In the Pacific,
things aren't so hot.

616
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,340
And in Washington...

617
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:06,589
If you want to know my opinion,
things are pretty fouled up all over.

618
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:13,175
Page 3. Here's a girdle and bra ad... which
I won't be needing for quite a while.

619
00:48:14,062 --> 00:48:18,059
I'm a dog to run off, I know. But what
can you do with parents, eh, Helen?

620
00:48:18,149 --> 00:48:20,854
Nothing, I guess. But we'll
be together tomorrow.

621
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:22,829
Sure. Want me to
take you back up?

622
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:25,547
No, I think I'll sit here for
a while. I'm all right.

623
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:28,320
OK. You're a big girl now.

624
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:30,034
- See you!
- Bye.

625
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:41,043
Hey, handsome!

626
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,838
Yeah, you, Tarzan!

627
00:48:42,924 --> 00:48:47,004
I'm stuck! Wanna help
me launch my boat?

628
00:48:51,558 --> 00:48:57,810
A girl's in real tough shape when she's
got no figure and no muscles either.

629
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:05,107
Thanks! Stick around!
I think we can use you!

630
00:49:05,196 --> 00:49:07,070
Bye, Helen!

631
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:08,236
Goodbye!

632
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,700
Thank you for your help.

633
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:20,997
Sure.

634
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:25,132
I didn't know anyone else was here.
Do you come to the cove often?

635
00:49:25,884 --> 00:49:29,087
Well... lately a little.

636
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:32,797
I've noticed you and
Judy a few times.

637
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,382
Well, I'm Mrs Phillips.

638
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:41,397
And I hope any friend of
Judy's is a friend of mine.

639
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,274
How do you do, Mrs Phillips?

640
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,606
- And you're?
- Rob... My name's Robinson.

641
00:49:48,448 --> 00:49:52,825
Well, you know, it's a bit
chillier than I thought.

642
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:56,860
Oh, dear. I'm sorry, but would you
help me find my shawl? I don't see.

643
00:49:56,956 --> 00:49:58,700
Of course.

644
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:02,872
I'm very awkward, I guess, but
Judy's a wonderful builder-upper.

645
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:06,877
I don't think anybody could come
through any better than you have.

646
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:12,387
- With a subdural haematoma like yours...
- That's where I met you. At the hospital.

647
00:50:12,472 --> 00:50:16,635
- You're a doctor.
- No. We've never met.

648
00:50:18,186 --> 00:50:22,764
I know a little about medicine.
I studied to be a surgeon once.

649
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:27,852
- But I have heard your voice, haven't I?
- I don't think so, Mrs Phillips.

650
00:50:29,614 --> 00:50:35,237
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No, thank you. I'm very comfortable.

651
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:38,448
Mrs Phillips, I wonder...

652
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:43,706
Would it be all right if
I came by occasionally?

653
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:47,045
Just for launching outboards
and general morale purposes?

654
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:49,420
- I hope I'm not imposing.
- Of course not.

655
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:51,632
We'll hope to see you
again very soon.

656
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:53,795
Yes. Soon.

657
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:56,715
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

658
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:27,085
I hope that I've been able
to make myself clear.

659
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:30,837
What you say you want to do is the
best news that anyone could tell me.

660
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:34,425
But I warn you, the investment
of one's life in others

661
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:38,889
and the alignment of oneself with
the forces that lead up and on,

662
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:41,846
- this does not come cheap.
- I don't expect it to be.

663
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:46,598
Once you go into it, you're bound.
You'll never be able to give it up.

664
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:52,030
You'll find this furnishes your
motive power. It will obsess you.

665
00:51:52,113 --> 00:51:56,905
But, believe me, it'll be
a magnificent obsession.

666
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,390
- Thank you, Williams.
- A Mr Masterson is here.

667
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:24,311
- Any mail?
- Yes, sir. On your desk.

668
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:28,395
- Sorry I'm late.
- I haven't waited long.

669
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:30,772
- Cigarette?
- Yes. Thank you.

670
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,063
How are plans developing?

671
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:37,275
I made the last deposit to
Mrs Phillips' account today.

672
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,612
Sit down.

673
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:40,990
That completes the
amount you wanted paid.

674
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:43,996
- Good. Any problems?
- No, but...

675
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:47,786
Joyce asked some very
pertinent questions.

676
00:52:47,877 --> 00:52:51,329
It is a lot of money. But they're
both convinced it was insurance.

677
00:52:51,422 --> 00:52:53,830
- You haven't mentioned this to anyone?
- No.

678
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:55,882
Good.

679
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:58,673
- You don't approve of me, do you?
- Well, I...

680
00:52:58,763 --> 00:53:02,262
Perkins and Little have been the
Merrick attorneys for years.

681
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,841
So I thought it strange
you called me last month.

682
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:09,183
That's why. Nobody would suspect anything
from you as originating with me.

683
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:13,437
And you can start practising some more,
because here comes a high, fast one.

684
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,817
I talked to Dr Giraud
at the medical centre.

685
00:53:15,905 --> 00:53:19,440
- The brain man?
- Yes. Best diagnostician in the country.

686
00:53:19,534 --> 00:53:21,194
I once studied with him.

687
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:25,283
He says there's some chance...
a very, very small chance...

688
00:53:25,373 --> 00:53:28,374
that Helen Phillips' prognosis
may not be hopeless.

689
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:29,289
Really?

690
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:33,754
He says if doctors like Emil Hofer in
Zürich, Fuss in Vienna, Lehman in Munich

691
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:39,047
could be persuaded to take her case, they
might be able to devise a way to operate.

692
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:43,174
But you couldn't get them all
over here in a million years.

693
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:48,142
We could get her over there. Hofer won't
leave Zürich, so it has to be Switzerland.

694
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:52,393
Today Dr Giraud heard from Fuss. He
and Lehman could be there this spring

695
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:54,393
for periodic consultations.

696
00:53:54,485 --> 00:54:00,654
They're willing to tell her they're taking
the case as a gesture to her late husband.

697
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:04,574
You get all kinds of people to do
what you want, don't you, Merrick?

698
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:10,083
That's fine, but... the expense. Somebody
will have to be with her all those months.

699
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:12,623
Persuade her and Joyce
to sell the house.

700
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:13,743
Who'd buy it?

701
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,207
I know somebody who needs a
place exactly like that.

702
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,214
He'll pay what some people might
think is a lot more than it's worth.

703
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:25,432
Think it over. Figure out the best
way to present it all to her.

704
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:29,431
Of course, don't let anyone
know about this either.

705
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:33,055
- No one.
- No, of course not.

706
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:38,024
Um... What are you going
to do with the house?

707
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:42,525
I don't want any part of it.
You'll find a worthy use for it.

708
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,693
Merrick, I, uh...

709
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:48,736
I take back a lot of things
I thought about you.

710
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,039
That's nice of you to say so.

711
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:56,965
- What's all this?
- False knots.

712
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:59,586
One of the first things
you learn in med school.

713
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:04,219
You are wrapped up in this. Well,
goodbye. I'll be talking to you.

714
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:06,631
Thanks. I'll find my way out.

715
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:20,984
What you're asking is to change your manner
of living... which is your business...

716
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:24,322
but also to pick up a
career which you dropped.

717
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:27,326
Probably the most demanding
career you could choose.

718
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:31,706
If you don't go on this time, we've tied
up good people and priceless facilities...

719
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,911
- which is my business.
- I'm still asking it.

720
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:41,752
If I can go back and graduate, will you
let me intern here at the medical centre?

721
00:55:47,432 --> 00:55:50,101
All right, Bob Merrick.
We'll try it.

722
00:55:50,185 --> 00:55:53,803
I've done a lot of things in medicine
I was warned were impossible.

723
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:55,272
You won't regret it.

724
00:55:55,356 --> 00:55:59,057
When you studied with me years ago,
why weren't you so enthusiastic?

725
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:04,490
- What a lot of time you've wasted!
- Yes, what a lot of time.

726
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:07,484
Thank you, Doctor.

727
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:14,240
The marshal gets on his white horse
and rides off with Wise Eagle.

728
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:18,830
The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon
them varmints'll head through the pass?"

729
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:21,210
- Wise Eagle says...
- "Ug!"

730
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:24,383
The marshal says, "We gotta
head 'em off. Come on."

731
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:27,386
Next picture's the sheriff's office.
The marshal says:

732
00:56:27,472 --> 00:56:32,300
"Sheriff, what idea you got in that ornery
head of yours to stop them desperadoes?"

733
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:34,185
The sheriff says...

734
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:39,098
"Marshal, I don't like using shootin'
irons, but if I gotta use shootin' irons,

735
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:42,228
I tell you, there ain't no
hombre this side of the Pecos

736
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,191
is any better with shootin'
irons, less'n it's you."

737
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:46,775
And Wise Eagle says...

738
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:49,274
Oh. "Ug!"

739
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:51,112
We're gettin' better!

740
00:56:51,204 --> 00:56:56,162
Listen, you two. Forget about the funnies.
I can't keep quiet any longer.

741
00:56:56,251 --> 00:56:59,999
- Silence, Judith.
- OK, Helen. Shoot.

742
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:04,216
First of all, some of the best eye
doctors in Europe are interested in me,

743
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,960
because of my husband, I guess.

744
00:57:06,052 --> 00:57:08,625
They want me to come
over for a consultation.

745
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:12,589
- Helen, I couldn't be happier.
- Gee, that's marvellous! For free?

746
00:57:12,684 --> 00:57:16,302
Practically. But not the trip itself...
that's the other good news.

747
00:57:16,396 --> 00:57:18,721
So many wonderful
things have happened.

748
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:22,978
We have the most fabulous offer for
the house and the lake frontage.

749
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:25,145
Enough for an income
for Joyce and me.

750
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:30,030
If the buyer takes the Brightwood acreage,
the hospital will be in good shape too.

751
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:32,075
It's about time your life turned.

752
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:38,200
It's ironic... I've never been to Europe,
and when I go, I won't be able to see it.

753
00:57:38,293 --> 00:57:41,294
But what a place to open your eyes.

754
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:44,582
I have to leave by the end of
the month for Switzerland.

755
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:47,675
I'll miss you two, for a long time.

756
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,596
Heck, Helen. I'll write.

757
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:54,348
Heck, Helen. I'll write.

758
00:57:54,434 --> 00:58:00,519
Switzerland sounds dreamy! You can get
a Swiss watch and learn to yodel!

759
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:04,818
She's practically lived on the beach.
This Robinson must be a dreamboat.

760
00:58:04,903 --> 00:58:09,611
- Haven't you met him yet?
- She's keeping him all to herself.

761
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:14,444
I think it's wonderful. It looks as if
they really mean a lot to each other.

762
00:58:14,537 --> 00:58:17,871
You know, it's very strange
knowing you only like this.

763
00:58:17,957 --> 00:58:21,042
So well, it seems, and yet...

764
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:25,460
I've never seen your face.

765
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:30,127
- Hi, Joyce!
- Hi, Judy!

766
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,635
- Any room left on the beach for us?
- Sure. You kiddin'?

767
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:38,266
Helen, the news sounds just wonderful,
but I'm afraid I have to go.

768
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:43,430
Oh, no. No, don't go. It's Joyce, and
now you'll have a chance to meet her.

769
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:45,316
Joyce!

770
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:48,521
Happy Sunday, Helen.
Joyce dragged me along.

771
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:52,860
At long last, everybody. This is
Joyce Phillips, Tom Masterson,

772
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:56,616
and this is Robbie Robinson I've
been telling you so much about.

773
00:58:56,704 --> 00:59:00,073
- Hello.
- How do you do, Mr... Robinson?

774
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:01,791
How do you do?

775
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:06,040
I'm sorry. I'm just on my way to the
village. I'm glad to have met you.

776
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,206
Don't forget tomorrow.

777
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:12,293
Goodbye, Helen.

778
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:14,463
Goodbye.

779
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:18,430
- Mr Robinson!
- Joyce!

780
00:59:18,518 --> 00:59:20,178
Could I ask you a favour?

781
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,179
- Tom!
- Yes, Helen?

782
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:25,308
- Tom, what's wrong?
- Why, nothing, Helen.

783
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,267
- What is this?
- Look, Joyce, you don't understand.

784
00:59:29,362 --> 00:59:33,739
I sure don't. Hasn't she had enough trouble
from you without this fantastic lie?

785
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:38,701
Believe me, I'm only trying to make
her life a little less lonely.

786
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:43,746
Fine. Wouldn't it be wonderful for her to
fall in love with someone named Robinson

787
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:46,124
and then open her eyes
and see that it's you?

788
00:59:46,212 --> 00:59:49,961
That would make us all glad
we're living, wouldn't it?

789
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:54,296
Get out, Merrick. Get out
of her life and stay out.

790
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:00,842
So long, pardner!

791
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:13,481
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Goodbye, Tom.

792
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:15,032
Come on, Helen.

793
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:16,907
- Goodbye, Tom.
- Goodbye, Nancy.

794
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:18,820
Hurry up, Joyce.

795
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:20,703
I love you, darling.

796
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:24,707
I'm coming.

797
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:27,081
- Bye, darling.
- Goodbye, dear.

798
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,636
Hello, Merrick.

799
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,934
Everything's going to be all right.

800
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:04,390
Now, Mrs Phillips, tell me
if you see a little light.

801
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:11,311
Do you?

802
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:13,475
No.

803
01:02:18,323 --> 01:02:20,481
Do you notice a light now?

804
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:23,742
No, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

805
01:02:37,717 --> 01:02:40,920
Mrs Phillips, do you
have headaches?

806
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:43,128
Yes.

807
01:02:43,223 --> 01:02:46,556
Constantly, or periodically?

808
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:48,931
- Periodically.
- Mm-hm.

809
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,392
Where?

810
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:54,054
In the back of my head.

811
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,226
Any dizzy spells?

812
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,363
Occasionally.

813
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:01,736
Difficulties in walking?

814
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:05,662
No... No.

815
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:10,620
Well, I think that
does it for today.

816
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:13,959
Well, Doctors? What's the verdict?

817
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:17,331
You must be patient, Mrs
Phillips, you know.

818
01:03:17,423 --> 01:03:19,796
There are tests and tests.

819
01:03:19,884 --> 01:03:22,506
We are making progress.

820
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:27,969
But I did distinguish some light yesterday,
and it was the same test, wasn't it?

821
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:29,518
What does it mean?

822
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:34,264
If you can bear with us, madame,
in time we'll find out.

823
01:03:54,586 --> 01:03:58,286
Oh, I don't know how
they dare call this tea.

824
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:00,919
Back home it'd be a
six-course lunch.

825
01:04:03,136 --> 01:04:06,053
Why did I ever memorise
that calorie chart?

826
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:09,674
I'm glad that's finished. Now I'm
only three letters behind Tom.

827
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:12,389
- Want some tea, dear?
- Yes, thank you, Nancy.

828
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:14,555
- Joyce?
- Yes?

829
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:20,483
I'd like to send a note to Robbie Robinson,
if it wouldn't be too much trouble.

830
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:21,981
Well, no.

831
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:26,021
- Aren't you tired? It can wait, can't it?
- You should rest and relax,

832
01:04:26,117 --> 01:04:31,574
- not worry about your social obligations.
- It's no obligation. He'll be interested.

833
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:34,868
And I want it to make the next
plane... just a note, Joyce.

834
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:37,533
And you can say...

835
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:39,752
that the tests have started

836
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,674
and we're all very optimistic.

837
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:46,803
And, uh... tell him
that I miss him...

838
01:04:46,888 --> 01:04:50,387
and to say hello to Judy...

839
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:55,386
and the only part of Switzerland that
we've encountered is a hospital.

840
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,315
is a hospital.

841
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:09,699
How do you explain it, Doctor? Her letter
sounds so optimistic, yet your reports...

842
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:14,033
Now, now, Bob. How long has
she been there? A few weeks?

843
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:16,697
Only Fuss and Hofer
have seen her so far.

844
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,960
Naturally their reports to us
are going to sound cautious.

845
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:23,296
Cautious? I'd say they
were pessimistic.

846
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:28,923
Don't worry so much. Everything which
can be done for her is being done.

847
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:30,342
I know.

848
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:37,478
After all, we never anticipated more
than a medical possibility, did we?

849
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:41,983
A medical possibility.

850
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:53,490
Mrs Phillips! Good morning.

851
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,987
- You're Dr Fuss?
- Yes. Dr Fuss.

852
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:59,498
- Please, sit down, Mrs Phillips.
- Oh, and you're Dr Hofer.

853
01:05:59,586 --> 01:06:01,662
- Jawohl.
- Good morning, madame.

854
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:03,996
- And you're Dr Lehman.
- You're right.

855
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,755
You see? I'm beginning
to recognise all of you.

856
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:10,335
Well, at long last, the great day.

857
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:13,633
I want you to know that
I've shot the works, too.

858
01:06:13,725 --> 01:06:18,054
That's American slang. That
means a new dress, a new hat...

859
01:06:21,441 --> 01:06:24,857
Now I want to know when you're going
to make a new girl out of me.

860
01:06:24,944 --> 01:06:28,693
Mrs Phillips, you have been close
to medicine for a few years.

861
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:32,482
You know the relationship
of doctor and patient.

862
01:06:32,577 --> 01:06:38,829
You know that there is very little to
be gained by not facing the facts.

863
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:40,993
Why, of course.

864
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:44,452
By all means, face the facts.

865
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:48,624
What are they?

866
01:06:48,718 --> 01:06:51,339
We are very sorry, Mrs Phillips,

867
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:55,723
but we are agreed that, for the
present, we can do nothing.

868
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,596
No operation?

869
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:05,313
- Nothing?
- We've searched every avenue, I believe.

870
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:08,237
That's not to say there is no hope.

871
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:11,238
In a case like yours, after
several years sometimes...

872
01:07:11,324 --> 01:07:12,984
Several years, Doctor?!

873
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:18,746
We feel that it would be unwise and
unkind to submit you to surgery now.

874
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:22,615
But you know that I'll let you experiment
if there's any chance at all...

875
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,917
the longest chance in the world.

876
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:29,465
We regret to say, but the
indications are not there.

877
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,587
Oh.

878
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,674
Well, if the indications
aren't there, then...

879
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:41,259
I guess that's that.

880
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:46,391
You've done everything
that you could.

881
01:07:46,484 --> 01:07:49,189
It was a gamble.

882
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:53,407
We all knew that it was
a gamble and I just...

883
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:56,065
well, I just lost, that's all.

884
01:07:57,328 --> 01:08:01,575
But... I want to thank you.

885
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:05,533
I want to thank you for
being so kind to me and...

886
01:08:05,628 --> 01:08:08,582
and giving me all your time.

887
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:12,836
I really can't thank you enough.

888
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,501
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

889
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:18,514
- And...
- Goodbye, Mrs Phillips.

890
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:22,717
The last must be Dr Lehman.

891
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:25,303
My child...

892
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:28,150
I am so sorry.

893
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:33,904
Well, I... I thought I was
going to get rid of these.

894
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:38,451
Isn't it nice that... that
I didn't throw them away?

895
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,136
She's sound asleep.

896
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:10,848
What has she done that
all this happens to her?

897
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:14,483
Golly. How she took it today...

898
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:19,824
I don't know how she stands
up under everything.

899
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:24,039
If it happened to me, I'd go to pot
in a handbasket. I think I'd even...

900
01:09:24,123 --> 01:09:27,290
I'm proud of you, Joyce.

901
01:09:27,377 --> 01:09:31,125
It hasn't been an easy
year for you either.

902
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:36,125
Well, I'll go get these drops and
this new prescription filled.

903
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:41,095
- Nancy, do me a favour.
- Of course. What?

904
01:09:41,182 --> 01:09:45,678
Stay away from here for a while
and relax yourself for a change.

905
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,765
All right. I do need some fresh air.
I'll be back in an hour.

906
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:14,297
- Darling. I thought you were asleep.
- I heard the door. Was it Nancy?

907
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:19,009
Yes. She went out for a while. I can get
you one of your pills and some hot milk.

908
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:21,669
Joyce, I don't need any sleep.

909
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:26,385
Oh, yes, I do too.

910
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:29,513
It's so awful in bed.

911
01:10:31,608 --> 01:10:35,985
It's funny, but... the
night-time is the worst time.

912
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,740
It does get darker, you know.

913
01:10:39,991 --> 01:10:43,407
And then, when I finally
do get to sleep,

914
01:10:43,494 --> 01:10:48,571
I know that, when I wake up in the
morning, there won't be any dawn.

915
01:10:51,503 --> 01:10:52,961
Joyce...

916
01:10:53,046 --> 01:10:55,715
Joyce, forgive me.

917
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:59,464
I didn't mean to
parade my emotions.

918
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:04,384
Maybe I do need a pill.

919
01:11:04,474 --> 01:11:07,143
Would you mind getting
me some warm milk?

920
01:11:07,227 --> 01:11:09,800
Of course not.

921
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:12,387
Just sit down here.

922
01:11:15,276 --> 01:11:17,068
I'll only be gone a moment.

923
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:22,029
I'll just go down to the hotel
kitchen and warm some milk.

924
01:11:29,082 --> 01:11:32,700
- Are you all right?
- Yes, dear, I'm all right.

925
01:13:45,176 --> 01:13:46,421
Joyce?

926
01:13:48,137 --> 01:13:50,214
No.

927
01:13:54,018 --> 01:13:56,094
It's Rob.

928
01:13:57,564 --> 01:13:59,640
Rob?

929
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:13,952
Oh, I can't believe it.

930
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:17,039
- It's been so long.
- Much too long.

931
01:14:19,127 --> 01:14:23,705
When you didn't come to the plane,
and you hardly wrote all these months...

932
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:26,716
Oh, I'm so glad you're here!

933
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,257
You must have known how
much I need you now.

934
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:30,626
Darling.

935
01:14:32,015 --> 01:14:35,763
Robbie, my trip has been wasted.

936
01:14:36,895 --> 01:14:41,640
- I found out today my case is hopeless.
- Don't talk about it.

937
01:14:41,733 --> 01:14:45,066
I came to tell you you're gonna
have the time of your life with me.

938
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:49,649
I'll take you all the places you've been too
busy to visit, show you how to have fun.

939
01:14:49,741 --> 01:14:52,777
- But I'll be such trouble.
- Listen, Helen.

940
01:14:52,869 --> 01:14:57,863
You used to let me read you the funnies.
Let me be your eyes again.

941
01:14:57,957 --> 01:15:01,825
Now get dressed. Something
to bowl everybody ever.

942
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,917
I'm not only gonna show you the town,
I'm gonna show the town you.

943
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:08,083
Oh, Robbie.

944
01:15:13,306 --> 01:15:14,551
Joyce?

945
01:15:15,058 --> 01:15:16,600
Joyce?

946
01:15:16,684 --> 01:15:19,389
Yes, Helen?

947
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:24,022
Look who's here. Robbie Robinson.
It's like Old Home Week.

948
01:15:24,108 --> 01:15:25,900
This is a surprise.

949
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:27,645
- Hello.
- Hello.

950
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:32,399
We're gonna get dressed up to the teeth.
I'm going to initiate that new net dress.

951
01:15:34,244 --> 01:15:37,659
Joyce, will you please
come and help me?

952
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:39,279
Oh!

953
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:42,707
Oh, I'm all right.
I won't be very long.

954
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:54,342
- I'll be back in just a moment, Helen.
- All right, Joyce.

955
01:15:58,226 --> 01:16:00,681
Bob Merrick, I...

956
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,846
I want to apologise.

957
01:16:04,065 --> 01:16:05,310
You? For what?

958
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:11,153
That girl you just saw is quite a
change from the girl this afternoon.

959
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:14,109
They told her she's
never going to see.

960
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,865
I know. I just came
from the institute.

961
01:16:17,954 --> 01:16:20,789
They've been keeping
in touch with me.

962
01:16:20,874 --> 01:16:24,741
Anybody that can do what you've
done for her is OK with me.

963
01:16:24,836 --> 01:16:27,541
I never believed names
were too important anyway.

964
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,919
- Joyce!
- Coming!

965
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:44,437
It's wonderful being with you.

966
01:16:44,522 --> 01:16:47,938
I don't want it to end, ever.

967
01:16:48,026 --> 01:16:51,359
Let's not think of it.
Tonight is our night.

968
01:16:51,446 --> 01:16:53,735
Yes, tonight is our night.

969
01:16:55,074 --> 01:16:59,452
Oh, and the fragrance
in the air... What is it?

970
01:16:59,537 --> 01:17:01,660
- Lilacs?
- Mm-hm.

971
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:05,911
And there's a moon...
as there should be.

972
01:17:06,002 --> 01:17:11,245
Oh, and just ahead there's
lights of a little old town.

973
01:17:11,341 --> 01:17:14,757
Just as there should be.

974
01:17:24,646 --> 01:17:26,722
Excuse me a second, darling.

975
01:17:31,569 --> 01:17:34,606
- Ich nehme diesen hier.
- Danke.

976
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,944
I thought you might like these.

977
01:17:39,035 --> 01:17:41,407
- Lilacs?
- Mm-hm. For luck.

978
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:44,698
And more lilacs.

979
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,031
What's going on?

980
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:48,325
Let's find out.

981
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:50,661
Wenn ich das erklären darf?

982
01:17:50,755 --> 01:17:53,791
- Das ist ein lokales Volksfest.
- It's a local festival.

983
01:17:53,883 --> 01:17:56,588
- Man verbrennt die Hexe.
- They're burning a witch.

984
01:17:56,678 --> 01:17:59,548
- Damit wir eine gute Ernte haben.
- For a good harvest.

985
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:02,759
- Mit Musik und Feuerwerk.
- With music and fireworks.

986
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:31,211
There she is, darling. Way up on top of
a pile of branches about 20 feet high.

987
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:35,245
Poor old gal's stuffed with straw,
just like our scarecrows back home.

988
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:40,418
And on the ground just below her, boys
and girls in peasant dress are dancing.

989
01:19:05,371 --> 01:19:08,159
Now they're setting fire to her.

990
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:16,456
There she goes.

991
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,389
Fireworks bursting
all over the place.

992
01:19:34,526 --> 01:19:38,144
- Now everybody's starting to dance.
- I'd like to dance too.

993
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:39,898
You would?

994
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:43,275
I always dance with my
eyes closed anyway.

995
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:35,125
- I won't tell you what time it is.
- I don't want it to stop.

996
01:20:35,211 --> 01:20:38,829
I don't want to lose this place,
or the music, or the night.

997
01:20:38,923 --> 01:20:40,880
You don't have to lose it.

998
01:20:40,967 --> 01:20:44,134
I'd forgotten how happy I could be.

999
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,847
You've helped me know that the world
isn't such a bad place after all.

1000
01:20:48,933 --> 01:20:52,551
- You don't hate it any more?
- Not any more.

1001
01:20:53,438 --> 01:20:56,522
Could you... forgive anything now?

1002
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:58,351
I think so.

1003
01:20:58,443 --> 01:21:00,519
Yes.

1004
01:21:00,612 --> 01:21:02,688
Even... Bob Merrick?

1005
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:06,733
Why...

1006
01:21:10,455 --> 01:21:12,447
Yes, Bob.

1007
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,200
Of course.

1008
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:16,368
How long have you known?

1009
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:21,965
I don't really remember when I first had
the feeling that... Does it really matter?

1010
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:26,344
I love you, and I
want to marry you.

1011
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,348
Darling, if we only could.

1012
01:21:30,433 --> 01:21:34,645
But I couldn't have you pitied
because of me. I love you too much.

1013
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:39,806
- Helen, I need you more than anything.
- Bob... Tomorrow.

1014
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:44,488
Let me tell you tomorrow.

1015
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:47,482
All right.

1016
01:21:48,576 --> 01:21:51,826
Starting tomorrow,
we'll never be apart.

1017
01:21:53,248 --> 01:21:55,324
Tomorrow.

1018
01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:11,682
Well... it's really
good night this time.

1019
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:13,972
Oh, I wish it weren't.

1020
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:29,365
There's a brand-new
day in a few hours.

1021
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,075
Even better.

1022
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,652
Nothing could be better, darling.

1023
01:22:33,746 --> 01:22:35,822
I love you.

1024
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:37,991
Oh, Bob.

1025
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:43,747
Oh. The key.

1026
01:22:46,759 --> 01:22:48,835
The key.

1027
01:22:55,685 --> 01:22:57,761
Helen!

1028
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:01,268
- Did you have a good time?
- A wonderful time.

1029
01:23:01,357 --> 01:23:02,900
How pretty.

1030
01:23:02,984 --> 01:23:05,689
- Good night.
- Good night.

1031
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:08,779
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yes.

1032
01:23:11,034 --> 01:23:13,951
- Good night.
- Good night, Nancy.

1033
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:24,789
I'll take the flowers, Helen.

1034
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,798
Oh, they're so pretty.

1035
01:23:27,884 --> 01:23:30,801
It was too wonderful, Nancy.

1036
01:23:30,887 --> 01:23:33,378
He wants to do so much for me.

1037
01:23:33,473 --> 01:23:36,758
Helen, what's the matter?

1038
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:40,677
He wants to marry me, Nancy.

1039
01:23:40,772 --> 01:23:43,227
I love him. I can't let him do it.

1040
01:23:43,316 --> 01:23:47,100
- Well, if you love him and he loves you...
- I don't know. I don't know.

1041
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:49,401
I don't know anything any more.

1042
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:52,490
- Nancy, please don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.

1043
01:23:52,575 --> 01:23:54,651
You've got to help me.

1044
01:24:11,135 --> 01:24:13,212
Helen?

1045
01:24:14,305 --> 01:24:16,381
Nancy?

1046
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,176
Where is everybody?

1047
01:24:27,527 --> 01:24:29,603
Hello?

1048
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:32,990
Oh, yes, please. Have him come up.

1049
01:24:33,074 --> 01:24:34,699
Helen, Rob...

1050
01:24:57,974 --> 01:25:01,141
Hello? Get me the desk, please.

1051
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:09,358
Come in.

1052
01:25:09,444 --> 01:25:10,475
I see.

1053
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:13,690
Good morning. Couldn't order
a better day if we tried.

1054
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:16,070
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1055
01:25:17,076 --> 01:25:20,825
Is Helen dressed? I hope
you're not allergic to lilacs.

1056
01:25:20,914 --> 01:25:24,579
Bob... What happened
to you two last night?

1057
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:30,207
- Did you tell her who you were?
- Yes. But she knew anyway. Joyce...

1058
01:25:30,298 --> 01:25:32,836
I, uh... I asked her to marry me.

1059
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,337
Oh, Bob.

1060
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:42,216
- She's gone.
- She's?

1061
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,145
- Where?
- I don't know.

1062
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:48,100
Away with Nancy,
early this morning.

1063
01:25:48,191 --> 01:25:51,311
Oh, here. She left
this note for you.

1064
01:25:59,536 --> 01:26:02,655
"Dear Bob. Goodbye."

1065
01:26:02,747 --> 01:26:06,033
"I'm sure this is
best for both of us."

1066
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:10,289
"You have your study and work now,
and I could only be a burden."

1067
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,297
"If you love me,
don't try to find me."

1068
01:26:13,383 --> 01:26:18,009
"Just know you made me happier than
I dreamed I could ever be again. Helen."

1069
01:26:20,431 --> 01:26:24,429
I phoned downstairs. Nobody
knows where she went.

1070
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:26,595
- We've got to go after her.
- But, Bob...

1071
01:26:26,688 --> 01:26:30,021
We'll talk about it on the way.
We've got to find her.

1072
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:36,396
Miss Phillips, Mr Merrick, we are
doing everything to trace them...

1073
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:38,612
as are the police all over Europe.

1074
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:43,575
But from Milano... nothing to report.
Paris... no findings. Rome... nothing.

1075
01:26:43,663 --> 01:26:46,699
You'd think in five weeks we'd
be able to find some trace.

1076
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:48,285
I am truly sorry, sir.

1077
01:26:48,376 --> 01:26:50,665
But, you know,
even in your country,

1078
01:26:50,753 --> 01:26:54,537
if someone really wants to
disappear, it is not too difficult.

1079
01:26:56,009 --> 01:27:00,505
- However, we shall not give up.
- Thank you, Captain. Goodbye.

1080
01:27:02,891 --> 01:27:06,094
I know what a sense of loss and
disappointment you both have,

1081
01:27:06,186 --> 01:27:07,810
but look at these telegrams.

1082
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:11,395
Our Inter-Europa Agency has
tried everything, I assure you.

1083
01:27:11,482 --> 01:27:14,234
Da ist ein Telegramm für mich?
Dankeschön.

1084
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:18,981
We have exhausted
all possibilities.

1085
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:20,354
Inter-Europa.

1086
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:24,364
Oui, madame. Lundi,
cinq... Exactement.

1087
01:27:24,454 --> 01:27:26,446
Pas de quoi, madame.

1088
01:27:32,545 --> 01:27:36,329
But we will be in touch
with our New York people.

1089
01:27:36,424 --> 01:27:38,962
And I will keep on the lookout here

1090
01:27:39,052 --> 01:27:41,673
for the two of them booking
passage to America.

1091
01:27:41,763 --> 01:27:45,677
Here are your tickets.
Bon voyage. Have a nice trip.

1092
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:48,340
It was a pleasure serving you.

1093
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,328
Darling, you're home.

1094
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:13,493
Oh, am I glad to see you!

1095
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:17,626
- Welcome home, Bob.
- Hello, Tom. Good to see you.

1096
01:28:17,715 --> 01:28:21,250
- Nothing? No trace?
- None.

1097
01:28:21,344 --> 01:28:26,136
She must come back to the States.
Sooner or later they'll get in touch.

1098
01:28:26,224 --> 01:28:29,924
- Strange how things work out, isn't it?
- Yeah, strange.

1099
01:28:30,019 --> 01:28:31,977
What are your plans?

1100
01:28:32,063 --> 01:28:37,270
I don't know. I guess I'll...
go up to Brightwood for a while.

1101
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:04,210
The marshal gets on his white horse
and rides off with Wise Eagle.

1102
01:29:04,304 --> 01:29:08,432
The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon
them varmints'll head through the pass?"

1103
01:29:08,516 --> 01:29:10,473
- Wise Eagle says...
- "Ug"

1104
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,459
- Mr Merrick?
- Yes.

1105
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:39,078
Mr Randolph had to leave
Brightwood for a few months.

1106
01:29:39,172 --> 01:29:42,256
Will you excuse me? I just came
over to close up the house.

1107
01:29:42,342 --> 01:29:44,418
Yes, certainly.

1108
01:30:01,152 --> 01:30:05,280
Once you go into it, you're bound.
You'll never give it up.

1109
01:30:05,365 --> 01:30:09,943
You'll find it'll furnish your motive
power. It will obsess you.

1110
01:30:10,036 --> 01:30:14,081
But, believe me, it'll be
a magnificent obsession.

1111
01:30:59,169 --> 01:31:01,494
- Chris, here's Doctor.
- Dr Merrick!

1112
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:03,960
- All ready to leave us, Chris?
- All set.

1113
01:31:04,048 --> 01:31:06,124
- Good!
- I wanna show you something.

1114
01:31:06,217 --> 01:31:08,293
Oh. All right.

1115
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:11,421
Look at me.

1116
01:31:12,098 --> 01:31:14,969
Not dizzy or anything. You
sure know how to operate!

1117
01:31:15,059 --> 01:31:17,597
Dr Barnes had more to
do with it than I did.

1118
01:31:17,687 --> 01:31:23,808
Now I can go to that new school out in
the country. They got horses and dogs.

1119
01:31:23,902 --> 01:31:26,819
That's just fine. Goodbye, Chris.

1120
01:31:26,905 --> 01:31:30,902
Just a minute, Doctor. Chris,
I want to talk to Doctor a minute.

1121
01:31:30,992 --> 01:31:33,198
Dr Merrick, you've
been wonderful to us.

1122
01:31:33,286 --> 01:31:35,113
Not just here in the hospital.

1123
01:31:35,205 --> 01:31:40,032
You arranged that school for Chris,
and my husband's job at the plant.

1124
01:31:40,126 --> 01:31:44,171
- You haven't told him that I?
- No. That's just between us, like you said.

1125
01:31:44,255 --> 01:31:47,505
But in a few years, when Chris
understands about money...

1126
01:31:47,592 --> 01:31:50,344
No, Mrs Miller. I told you
there's nothing to repay.

1127
01:31:50,428 --> 01:31:52,753
In a few years it'll
be all used up anyway.

1128
01:31:52,847 --> 01:31:56,382
- All used up?
- That's right, Mrs Miller. Goodbye.

1129
01:32:00,605 --> 01:32:05,979
I had quite an experience at the golf club.
After 20 years I almost got a hole in one.

1130
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:11,063
I took her to a beautiful French restaurant,
but all she wanted was spaghetti.

1131
01:32:11,157 --> 01:32:12,651
Bob Merrick!

1132
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:15,114
Dr Giraud! For heaven's sake!
How are you?

1133
01:32:15,203 --> 01:32:18,287
- You're underweight, but you look fine.
- I feel fine.

1134
01:32:18,373 --> 01:32:22,322
Doctors, please! This
is a very tense moment.

1135
01:32:22,919 --> 01:32:23,950
Check.

1136
01:32:24,045 --> 01:32:26,002
Say, what are you doing here?

1137
01:32:26,089 --> 01:32:30,039
Just been seeing your chief. He told me
you did a nice job on that trephining.

1138
01:32:30,134 --> 01:32:34,179
I told him I taught you all you know.
You'll be a real neurosurgeon after all.

1139
01:32:34,264 --> 01:32:35,722
That's the idea, Doctor.

1140
01:32:35,807 --> 01:32:38,594
Never hurts to take time off
to build up the batteries.

1141
01:32:38,685 --> 01:32:42,184
I took a week off. Went to Joyce
and Tom Masterson's wedding.

1142
01:32:42,272 --> 01:32:44,145
- When was that?
- Well, let's see.

1143
01:32:44,232 --> 01:32:48,099
She's in Maternity now with her first baby.
It must have been a year ago.

1144
01:32:48,194 --> 01:32:50,768
Maybe work is the best answer.

1145
01:32:51,531 --> 01:32:54,448
You... never heard anything again?

1146
01:32:54,534 --> 01:32:59,362
No. I never heard from her. Supposedly
she and Nancy came back to the States.

1147
01:32:59,455 --> 01:33:01,448
Dr Merrick, please.

1148
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:04,411
You're being paged. Must be
an important man, Doctor.

1149
01:33:04,502 --> 01:33:08,749
Don't stay away so long, Doctor.
We need critics around here. Goodbye.

1150
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,637
The book says if they don't
gain it back in five days...

1151
01:33:16,723 --> 01:33:21,135
Book, shmook. There ought to be a law
new fathers couldn't read anything.

1152
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:23,516
Come in.

1153
01:33:23,813 --> 01:33:25,188
- Hello, Doctor.
- Tom.

1154
01:33:25,273 --> 01:33:27,515
- How's the little mother?
- A lot littler.

1155
01:33:27,609 --> 01:33:32,152
I have a formal complaint. Some nurse
came and took my baby away.

1156
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:36,817
All you can supply is psychological
nourishment, which she doesn't need yet.

1157
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,483
- Everything all right?
- Fine. I go home Monday.

1158
01:33:39,579 --> 01:33:42,200
Good. I'll look in on you tomorrow.

1159
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:46,240
- Give little Helen an extra hug for me.
- Sure.

1160
01:33:48,004 --> 01:33:50,293
Goodbye, Doctor.

1161
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:52,754
He's doing his life
over the hard way.

1162
01:33:52,842 --> 01:33:57,006
I imagine any other way
would be the hard way now.

1163
01:34:03,686 --> 01:34:08,265
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening, Williams. Thank you.

1164
01:34:14,322 --> 01:34:17,572
- Hello, Bob.
- Edward Randolph. Good to see you.

1165
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:20,197
How long have you been here?

1166
01:34:20,286 --> 01:34:23,786
I phoned the hospital. They
said you were on your way home.

1167
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:25,782
And...

1168
01:34:26,751 --> 01:34:28,791
What is it?

1169
01:34:28,878 --> 01:34:31,500
Helen.

1170
01:34:31,589 --> 01:34:34,080
- Do you know where she is?
- Nancy called.

1171
01:34:34,175 --> 01:34:37,260
Said she was breaking her word...
thank goodness she did.

1172
01:34:37,345 --> 01:34:40,631
- Helen must be desperately ill, Bob.
- What?!

1173
01:34:40,723 --> 01:34:44,851
They're afraid of pneumonia,
other complications.

1174
01:34:45,728 --> 01:34:48,765
- Where are they?
- In a little hospital in New Mexico.

1175
01:34:48,857 --> 01:34:50,933
Shadow Mountain.

1176
01:34:54,654 --> 01:34:57,489
I've already called about tickets.

1177
01:34:57,574 --> 01:35:02,816
- How soon can we leave?
- The 9:00 plane. We'll get there at dawn.

1178
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:18,631
Doctor, that's their car.

1179
01:35:33,985 --> 01:35:35,728
- At last you're here.
- Finally.

1180
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:38,655
- I've only done what she asked me.
- I know. How is she?

1181
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:41,860
In a coma. No change since
you called from the airport.

1182
01:35:41,951 --> 01:35:47,159
- Dr Allan, Dr Merrick, Mr Randolph.
- How do you do? This way, Doctor.

1183
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,993
Nancy...

1184
01:35:58,468 --> 01:36:00,959
She was admitted a month ago.

1185
01:36:24,661 --> 01:36:27,234
May I see the history, please?

1186
01:36:33,586 --> 01:36:36,124
It's the pneumonococcus now.

1187
01:36:36,214 --> 01:36:39,001
When she was admitted,
headaches, nausea,

1188
01:36:39,092 --> 01:36:41,298
not connected with her
blindness at all.

1189
01:36:41,386 --> 01:36:43,924
It's pressure. Have you
done a spinal puncture?

1190
01:36:44,013 --> 01:36:48,722
One. Starting yesterday, she
deteriorated so fast, we had to.

1191
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:53,602
Another odd thing. This apparent paralysis
of the left arm and the respiratory centre.

1192
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:57,770
Couldn't be a stroke.
The onset was so gradual.

1193
01:36:57,861 --> 01:37:01,609
No. But it could be a fibroma.

1194
01:37:01,698 --> 01:37:03,525
Her old injury.

1195
01:37:03,616 --> 01:37:06,534
I know something about it.
It might have caused a clot

1196
01:37:06,619 --> 01:37:08,778
which became organised
and fibrotic.

1197
01:37:16,254 --> 01:37:17,914
I...

1198
01:37:19,007 --> 01:37:21,295
always dance...

1199
01:37:21,384 --> 01:37:24,883
with my eyes closed.

1200
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:30,256
Well, Doctor? What do you suggest?

1201
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:33,555
If we could only get Henry
Giraud to fly out here.

1202
01:37:33,646 --> 01:37:35,935
There isn't time for that.

1203
01:37:38,151 --> 01:37:40,393
Is there?

1204
01:37:43,656 --> 01:37:46,326
No, there's no time for that.

1205
01:37:46,409 --> 01:37:49,743
I agree. We should operate
as soon as possible.

1206
01:37:49,829 --> 01:37:51,656
Let's have a look at Surgery.

1207
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:55,786
- Doctor...
- This way?

1208
01:37:55,877 --> 01:37:59,328
Doctor, I couldn't do it.
I've never used a Hudson Burr.

1209
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:04,131
- Isn't there anyone else?
- Here? This is just a private sanatorium.

1210
01:38:04,219 --> 01:38:09,177
Four of us on the staff. Not one of
us could take that responsibility.

1211
01:38:09,265 --> 01:38:11,341
- Do you want it?
- I?

1212
01:38:12,477 --> 01:38:15,229
I don't have enough experience.

1213
01:38:15,313 --> 01:38:18,100
- You can't expect me to...
- Bob.

1214
01:38:21,736 --> 01:38:24,144
A chance in a thousand.

1215
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,397
A chance in a million.

1216
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:29,408
You've got to give it to her.

1217
01:38:33,998 --> 01:38:36,205
Edward, I can't.

1218
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:40,919
You're not gonna let everything you've
lived for all these years slip away?

1219
01:38:41,005 --> 01:38:44,457
You've gone so far, Bob. So far.

1220
01:38:46,761 --> 01:38:49,881
I'd give my life to save her.

1221
01:38:49,973 --> 01:38:54,635
You just give your skill.
You're ready for it.

1222
01:38:54,727 --> 01:39:01,394
Now you're gonna repay that old, old
debt in a way that you never imagined.

1223
01:39:15,582 --> 01:39:18,286
Nancy, will you help scrub?

1224
01:39:18,376 --> 01:39:20,250
I'll be glad to, Doctor.

1225
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:16,099
Remove the dressing.

1226
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:22,888
2cc of Pentothal sodium.

1227
01:40:31,741 --> 01:40:33,817
We're almost ready, Doctor.

1228
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:35,986
Dr Merrick?

1229
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:46,333
- What's the trouble?
- Doctor, you begin. I'll stand by.

1230
01:40:46,422 --> 01:40:48,748
Just a moment, please, Doctor.

1231
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:53,669
You can't let that girl down.
You just can't!

1232
01:40:53,763 --> 01:40:56,254
Nancy, I'm not up to it.

1233
01:40:57,517 --> 01:40:59,675
I just won't be able to...

1234
01:41:14,617 --> 01:41:16,277
Nancy, let's start.

1235
01:41:20,665 --> 01:41:23,500
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

1236
01:41:23,585 --> 01:41:25,661
All right, Doctor.

1237
01:42:37,534 --> 01:42:42,279
It was the longest and
roughest operation I ever saw.

1238
01:42:42,372 --> 01:42:45,657
Pretty feathery there
for a while, wasn't it?

1239
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:49,582
It's going to be feathery
until she comes to.

1240
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:46,594
- You'd better get some rest now.
- No.

1241
01:43:46,686 --> 01:43:49,806
Thank you, Nancy,
but I couldn't sleep.

1242
01:43:50,732 --> 01:43:54,480
- I'll make some coffee for you.
- All right.

1243
01:44:35,818 --> 01:44:37,895
Doctor.

1244
01:44:41,741 --> 01:44:43,983
Nancy?

1245
01:44:44,077 --> 01:44:46,746
Nancy's here. I'm here.

1246
01:44:47,747 --> 01:44:50,368
- Doctor?
- Yes.

1247
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:52,866
You must be quiet.

1248
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,996
It doesn't hurt so much.

1249
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:01,415
You're going to get better.

1250
01:45:02,345 --> 01:45:04,421
Who is it?

1251
01:45:06,307 --> 01:45:08,383
Who's here?

1252
01:45:10,228 --> 01:45:12,304
It's Bob.

1253
01:45:14,065 --> 01:45:16,141
Bob?

1254
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:20,651
Oh, Bob, I'm so glad you're here.

1255
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:25,029
Hold me.

1256
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:27,194
Hold me close.

1257
01:45:29,163 --> 01:45:31,240
I didn't know.

1258
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,284
You didn't tell me.

1259
01:45:35,336 --> 01:45:37,412
Lie still. Please.

1260
01:45:44,345 --> 01:45:46,836
What is that?

1261
01:45:46,931 --> 01:45:49,683
Helen, you've got to be quiet.

1262
01:45:50,935 --> 01:45:53,224
But I think I see some light.

1263
01:45:54,272 --> 01:45:56,728
Are you sure?

1264
01:45:56,816 --> 01:45:59,983
You mustn't talk. Just rest.

1265
01:46:01,112 --> 01:46:04,730
But I'm going to see! I know I am!

1266
01:46:06,701 --> 01:46:08,777
Am I?

1267
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:11,159
Yes, my darling.

1268
01:46:11,247 --> 01:46:13,785
You are going to see.

1269
01:46:15,043 --> 01:46:16,751
I can see you.

1270
01:46:18,046 --> 01:46:21,628
Please lie still. You must.

1271
01:46:22,926 --> 01:46:25,547
Don't get excited. Not today.

1272
01:46:27,472 --> 01:46:31,801
May I... May I get excited tomorrow?

1273
01:46:32,894 --> 01:46:34,139
Yes.

1274
01:46:35,813 --> 01:46:37,605
And you'll be with me?

1275
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:42,103
Yes, darling. I'll be
with you tomorrow.

1276
01:46:46,241 --> 01:46:48,482
Starting tomorrow,

1277
01:46:48,576 --> 01:46:50,652
we'll never be apart.

1278
01:46:51,621 --> 01:46:53,080
Tomorrow.

1279
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:56,366
Tomorrow.

1280
01:46:58,545 --> 01:47:00,621
Oh, tomorrow.

1281
01:47:06,344 --> 01:47:10,591
Once you find the
way, you'll be bound.

1282
01:47:10,682 --> 01:47:12,805
It'll obsess you.

1283
01:47:12,892 --> 01:47:17,353
But, believe me, it'll be
a magnificent obsession.
