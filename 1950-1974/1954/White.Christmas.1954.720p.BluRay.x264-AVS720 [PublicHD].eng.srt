1
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,843
Stop the Jeep, Sergeant.

2
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:19,429
What's this all about, Captain?

3
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,140
A little entertainment for the men, sir.
Tonight's Christmas Eve.

4
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,643
These men are moving up tonight,
General Waverly.

5
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,603
They should be lined up
for full inspection.

6
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,899
You're absolutely right. There's
no Christmas in the Army, Captain.

7
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,192
Yes, sir.

8
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,070
There's always a slip-up or two
during a change in command.

9
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,322
The men get a little loose.

10
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,576
- I know I'm leaving them in good hands.
- Thank you, General.

11
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,079
Sergeant, take me
to headquarters immediately.

12
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,706
You'll have those men
turned out on the double.

13
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:49,918
- Sergeant, take the shortcut.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:00,970
That's not the way back to headquarters.

15
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:05,724
Joe, you know that and I know that,
but the general doesn't know it.

16
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,852
At least he won't
for about an hour and a half.

17
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,479
That sergeant will be a private
in the morning.

18
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,648
Yes. Isn't he lucky?

19
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:40,842
<i>~ I'm dreaming ~</i>

20
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,763
<i>~ Of a white Christmas ~</i>

21
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,187
<i>~ Just like the ones I used to know ~</i>

22
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:59,193
<i>~ Where the treetops glisten ~</i>

23
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,989
<i>~ And children listen ~</i>

24
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,993
<i>~ To hear sleigh bells ~</i>

25
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,371
<i>~ In the snow ~</i>

26
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:20,172
<i>~ I'm dreaming ~</i>

27
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,344
<i>~ Of a white Christmas ~</i>

28
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:30,015
<i>~ With every Christmas card ~</i>

29
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:33,310
<i>~ I write ~</i>

30
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,689
<i>~ May your days be merry ~</i>

31
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:42,985
<i>~ And bright ~</i>

32
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:49,867
<i>~ And may all your Christmases ~</i>

33
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:54,121
<i>~ Be white ~</i>

34
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,965
Well, that just
about wraps it up, fellas.

35
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,718
Certainly too bad General Waverly
couldn't have been here

36
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:10,638
for this little
Yuletide clambake, but...

37
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:14,683
'Cause we really had a slam-bang finish
cooked up for him.

38
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,559
I guess you know by now

39
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,561
that he's being replaced
by a new commanding general

40
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,730
fresh out of the Pentagon.

41
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:23,900
That's not a very nice
Christmas present, is it,

42
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,736
for a division like us that's moving up?

43
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:29,197
The old man's moving toward the rear.

44
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:33,743
That's a direction
he's never taken in his entire life.

45
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:38,790
Well, all I can say is we owe
an awful lot to General Waverly...

46
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,333
Attention!

47
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:53,220
Captain Wallace, who's responsible

48
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:55,597
for holding a show
in this advanced area?

49
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,933
- Well, sir, as a matter of fact...
- It was me, sir.

50
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,477
Me, sir. It was my idea, sir.

51
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:02,938
I mean,
when you've got an entertainer, sir,

52
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:04,773
of the caliber
of Captain Wallace, sir...

53
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,028
I mean, sir,
it's Christmas Eve, sir, and...

54
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:12,990
Well, sir, I mean that
if you were in New York, sir,

55
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:15,784
you'd have to pay $6.60
or even $8.80 to see

56
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,078
or hear a great singer
like Captain Wallace, sir.

57
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:21,749
I'm well aware
of Captain Wallace's capabilities.

58
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,584
- Who are you?
- Phillip Davis, sir.

59
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:25,294
Private first class, sir.

60
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:28,588
- Well, at ease, Davis.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:31,966
I said, "At ease!"

62
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,970
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

63
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:41,309
This division is now under the command
of General Harold G. Carlton.

64
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:44,520
I don't want you to forget it,
not that he'll let you.

65
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:48,232
He's tough,
just what this sloppy outfit needs.

66
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,818
He'll have you standing inspection
night and day.

67
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:52,653
You may even learn how to march.

68
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,363
And if you don't give him
everything you've got,

69
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,617
I may come back and...
fight for the enemy.

70
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:02,996
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

71
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:07,167
Well, I guess all I can say
is how much I...

72
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,671
What a fine outfit.

73
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:14,966
How am I going...?

74
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:21,098
Don't just stand there.
How do I get off?

75
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:23,225
Just happen to have
a slam-bang finish, sir.

76
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:24,726
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,818
<i>~ We'll follow the old man ~</i>
<i>~ Wherever he wants to go ~</i>

78
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,863
<i>~ Long as he wants to go ~</i>
<i>~ Opposite to the foe ~</i>

79
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:40,908
<i>~ We'll stay with the old man ~</i>
<i>~ Wherever he wants to stay ~</i>

80
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:44,411
<i>~ Long as he stays away ~</i>
<i>~ From the battle's fray ~</i>

81
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,666
<i>~ Because we love him ~</i>
<i>~ We love him ~</i>

82
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:52,795
<i>~ Especially when he keeps us on the ball ~</i>

83
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:56,549
<i>~ And we'll tell the kiddies ~</i>
<i>~ We answered duty's call ~</i>

84
00:07:56,716 --> 00:08:00,553
<i>~ With the grandest son of a soldier ~</i>
<i>~ Of them all ~</i>

85
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,233
<i>~ We'll stay with the old man ~</i>
<i>~ Wherever he wants to stay ~</i>

86
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:18,695
<i>~ Long as he stays away ~</i>
<i>~ From the battle's fray ~</i>

87
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:23,241
<i>~ Because we love him ~</i>
<i>~ We love him ~</i>

88
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,911
<i>~ Especially when he keeps us on the ball ~</i>

89
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,999
<i>~ And we'll tell the kiddies ~</i>
<i>~ We answered duty's call ~</i>

90
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:36,629
<i>~ With the grandest son of a soldier ~</i>
<i>~ Of them all ~</i>

91
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:13,582
- Look out. It's about to come down.
- Get down!

92
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,796
Put me down!

93
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,306
You all right, Davis?

94
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:32,558
Yeah, I'm all right, sir.
It's just my arm, sir.

95
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:33,726
What do you...?

96
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:37,063
- This looks pretty bad.
- Yeah, it's nothing but a scratch.

97
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:47,031
- Hey, Davis, how you feeling?
- Pretty good, Captain.

98
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,909
I just dropped by to thank you
for saving my life.

99
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:52,828
- Well, it was a life worth saving, sir.
- Well, I appreciate it.

100
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,163
I want you to know something, Davis.

101
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:57,416
Anytime I can do anything for you,
anytime, any place,

102
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,919
- you just pick up a phone.
- Thank you, sir.

103
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:03,713
- So long, Davis. Sorry. I'll see you.
- That's all right, Captain.

104
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:08,134
Captain, you could do
one little tiny favor for me.

105
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:10,512
- What's that?
- Well, sir,

106
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,305
I've kind of written a little song,
you see,

107
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,890
and I thought perhaps
when we get back to the States,

108
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:17,060
when this is all over, you know,
I thought maybe if you put this song

109
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:18,520
in your act,
it might be a big hit for you.

110
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:21,815
- Why, sure. Just pick up the phone.
- Yeah. Captain,

111
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:23,358
I just happen to have it
with me right here.

112
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,901
- This it?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,861
Well, this is for two people.
It's a duet.

114
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,656
Yeah. It needs two people,
two dynamite entertainers.

115
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,658
But I work alone. I do a single.

116
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,785
Who do you figure on
for the other hunk of dynamite?

117
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:36,246
Well, I happen
to know a fellow, Captain.

118
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:40,958
He's pretty funny in living rooms, kind
of has a fair voice, you know, and I...

119
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:45,045
- How about me?
- Well, I do a single, you see.

120
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:47,715
Yeah, well... That's all right, Captain.

121
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:51,719
I wouldn't want you to feel
any special obligation in any way.

122
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:57,224
Oh, well.
OK, Dynamite, we'll give it whirl.

123
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,768
- OK, Captain. Bye.
- Good luck.

124
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:26,586
<i>~ We're having a heat wave ~</i>
<i>~ A tropical heat wave ~</i>

125
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:29,255
<i>~ Well, now the temperature's rising ~</i>
<i>~ It isn't surprising ~</i>

126
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,883
<i>~ She certainly can ~</i>
<i>~ Can-can ~</i>

127
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,436

128
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,731
<i>~ With crazy words that roll along ~</i>

129
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,903
<i>~ And if my song can start you laughing ~</i>
<i>~ I'm happy, happy ~</i>

130
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:29,397

<i>~ Blue skies smiling at me ~</i>

131
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:33,651

132
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,321
<i>~ Bluebirds ~</i>
<i>~ Singing a song ~</i>

133
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,574
<i>~ Nothing but bluebirds, bluebirds ~</i>
<i>~ All day long ~</i>

134
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:45,955
<i>~ I never saw the sun shining so bright ~</i>
<i>~ Never saw things going so right ~</i>

135
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:47,623

00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,462
<i>~ Blue days, all of them gone ~</i>
<i>~ Long gone ~</i>

138
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,260
<i>~ Nothing but blue skies from now on ~</i>

139
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,095
Keep it bubbling now, girls.

140
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:03,555
- Phil, can I see you for a minute?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:04,848
- Hello, honey. Hi.
- Hi.

142
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,015
- You know Doris?
- Yeah.

143
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,184
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Fine.

144
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,228
On stage, girls! On stage. Finale.

145
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:11,813
Albert, did you get the notice drawn up?

146
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,190
- Yes, sir. Show lays off tonight.
- Good boy.

147
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,192
Cast and crew get ten days off with pay.

148
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,154
Gee, they'll go wild. Nicest Christmas
present anybody ever had.

149
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:20,947
Well, they deserve it.
You got the tickets for New York?

150
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:22,699
Well, a little rough
for the holiday traffic,

151
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,743
but I pulled a few strings,
got you and Mr. Davis on the 1:00 train.

152
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,036
- Tickets are on the way over.
- Good enough.

153
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:29,038
- Put that on the bulletin board.
- Sign this, Bob.

154
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,707
OK. Say, if you want us
for anything in New York,

155
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,709
we'll be at Radio City.
We'll be rehearsing there

156
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,210
- for the Ed Harrison Television Show.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:36,044
Too bad you and Mr. Davis
couldn't get a little rest.

158
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,713
Oh, man,
I wasn't about to turn this down.

159
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,132
This is a great big, fat plug
for the show.

160
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,884
- Bring the tickets when they come.
- Yes, sir.

161
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,553
- Edna, the light of my life!
- Bob?

162
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,263
Can I see you a minute?

163
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:49,183
- You know Doris, friend of Rita's.
- Another one?

164
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,561
- How do you do?
- Mutual, I'm sure.

165
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:55,564
I thought before train time,
we'd get a bite to eat

166
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,192
- and have a few laughs or something.
- No, I can't make it.

167
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,652
I'm afraid you can't either.
We got some business to take care of.

168
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,738
- What kind of business?
- We got to go look at an act.

169
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,782
- Look at an act?
- Some other time, I hope?

170
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,120
Well, I like that! Without so much
as a "Kiss my foot" or "Have an apple!"

171
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:12,788
That does it. That's the last time
I'm gonna dig up a date for him.

172
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,082
And from now on,
you can do your dirty work yourself.

173
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,752
Yeah, well, excuse me one minute,
will you, kids?

174
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:21,672
Wallace, I think it's time
you and I had a little talk.

175
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,342
Yeah, it's a good idea, buster.
If you don't mind, I'll lead off.

176
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,093
- Now, wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.

177
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:27,970
You know something,
for about three months now,

178
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,473
you've been clumsily trying
to entangle me with some female.

179
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,975
- All I'm trying to do...
- Fat ones, tall ones, thin ones.

180
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:35,269
Doesn't make any difference,
as long as they're wearing skirts,

181
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:38,105
a little mascara and still breathing,
you ran them at me.

182
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:39,440
Believe me, it's for your own good.

183
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,609
- For my own good?
- Yeah. Let's face it, Bob,

184
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,028
- you're a lonely, miserable man.
- What?

185
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:47,614
And you're unhappy, too,
and when you're unhappy, I'm unhappy.

186
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:51,034
After all, I feel a strong sense
of responsibility to you, Bob,

187
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:54,955
- ever since the day I...
- Not again with that life-saving bit.

188
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:58,542
- Well, if you'd rather forget it...
- How can I? You won't let me.

189
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,461
Since you saved my life,
you decided you had the right to run it.

190
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,880
You've ootzed me along
every step of the way.

191
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:06,132
You've hammered, drove,
pushed, shoved.

192
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,592
And if that wasn't enough,

193
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,011
you'd look at me
with those great big cow eyes of yours,

194
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:12,681
point at that phony arm,
and I'd melt and go along!

195
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,724
- I don't expect any gratitude.
- You're gonna get it.

196
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:16,643
We did great, and I'm grateful.

197
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:20,063
So, thank you. Thank you, Phil Davis,
from the bottom of my heart.

198
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:21,648
Now, will you let
the rest of my life alone?

199
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,023
- No, I won't.
- Well, why not?

200
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,276
Because you're a miserable,
lonely, unhappy man.

201
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,319
You're whacky. I'm a very happy man.

202
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,988
Well, then,
you're happy for the wrong reasons.

203
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:32,783
And that's the same as being lonely
and miserable, except it's worse.

204
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:35,202
You know something, you're off
your nut about a mile and a half.

205
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,620
I've got everything in life I want.

206
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,539
- I'm off my nut a mile and a half.
- At least.

207
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,749
You've got everything you want
except the most important thing.

208
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,835
- What's this?
- A girl.

209
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:46,213
Well, I'll get around to that
one of these days.

210
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:48,757
My dear partner,
when what's left of you

211
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:52,136
gets around to what's left to be gotten,
what's left to be gotten won't be worth

212
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,221
getting whatever it is you've got left.

213
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,599
When I figure out what that means,
I'll come up with a crushing reply.

214
00:15:56,766 --> 00:16:00,101
- What's back all this, anyway?
- Nothing. Only your happiness.

215
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,186
- My happiness?
- Yeah.

216
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:05,356
You know, when you get an idea that's
for my sole and ultimate happiness,

217
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,609
there's always lurking behind it
a little angle for you.

218
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,527
- Now, what is it?
- Do you really want to know?

219
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:11,487
- Yes, I really want to know.
- All right, I'll really tell you.

220
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:12,697
Then lay it on me, will you?

221
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,074
Ever since the day we became
producers, you were a changed man.

222
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,577
You've gone absolutely berserk
with work.

223
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,205
The strange thing is you liked it.
You like being Rodgers & Hammerstein.

224
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:23,541
- It was your idea, you know? Yeah.
- Well, sure it was my idea.

225
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:25,668
But I didn't think
I was going to create a Frankenstein.

226
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,046
From that day on, I haven't had
one minute I could call my own.

227
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,631
What do you want me to do about it?

228
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:32,884
I want you to get married.
I want you to have nine children.

229
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:36,887
And if you only spend five minutes
a day with each kid, that's 45 minutes,

230
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:40,599
and I'd at least have time to go out
and get a massage or something.

231
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,934
You don't expect me to get serious
with the kind of characters

232
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,646
- you and Rita have been throwing at me.
- There've been some nice girls, too.

233
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:50,025
Yeah, yeah. Like that nuclear scientist
we just met out in the hall.

234
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:54,237
All right. They didn't go to college.
They didn't go to Smith.

235
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:57,157
Go to Smith? She couldn't even spell it.

236
00:16:57,325 --> 00:17:01,953
That's very funny. The crooner
is now becoming the comic.

237
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,500
Phil, let me tell you something.

238
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:10,586
There's a lot of sense in what you say,
and I have to admit it.

239
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:13,506
But the kind of girls
you and I meet in this business,

240
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:17,718
they're young and they're ambitious.
They're full of their own careers.

241
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:21,889
Not interested in getting married,
settling down, raising a family.

242
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:25,059
That's funny, Bob. I never heard you
open up like that before.

243
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,395
Someday, the right girl
is gonna come along,

244
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,897
and if she'll have me,
we'll get married. We'll settle down.

245
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:32,108
We'll start having
those nine kids for you.

246
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,485
Forty-five minutes going to be enough?

247
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,613
- If I need any more, I'll tell you.
- Come in!

248
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,616
Your railroad tickets, sir.
Drawing Room A, Car 207.

249
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,952
- Thanks. Grab those, will you, Phil?
- Here.

250
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,870
We'll go right over to the station
from Novello's

251
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,580
- after we audition this act.
- What kind of an act is it?

252
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,417
- It's a sister act.
- We don't need any sister act.

253
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:51,710
What are we wasting time for?

254
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,254
Well, I got a letter from Benny Haynes.
They're his sisters.

255
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,673
Do you remember Benny Haynes,
the old mess sergeant?

256
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,800
Freckle-Face Haynes,
the dog-faced boy?

257
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,468
- That's the kid. Yeah.
- He's got sisters?

258
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,345
- Claims he's got them.
- Come on now.

259
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,889
How can a guy that ugly
have the nerve to have sisters?

260
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:06,558
Very brave parents, I guess.

261
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:08,309
- Bob, will you do me one favor?
- What's that?

262
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:10,437
Give me one reason, one good reason,

263
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:12,897
why we should spend
our last two hours in Florida

264
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:16,484
looking at the sisters of Freckle-Face
Haynes, the dog-faced boy.

265
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:19,320
Let's just say we're doing it
for a pal in the Army.

266
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,197
Well, it's not good, but it's a reason.

267
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,794
- Hey, Novello.
- Good evening, Mr. Wallace, Mr. Davis.

268
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,421
Say, have the Haynes Sisters
been on yet?

269
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,090
No, sir, not yet.
They'll be on in about 15 minutes.

270
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,509
- Tell them we're here, will you?
- Certainly, Mr. Wallace.

271
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:45,679
Luigi, show these gentlemen
to their table.

272
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:51,643
This is ridiculous. We could have
been out with Doris and Rita

273
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,853
having some laughs.

274
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,731
Phil, when are you gonna learn
girls like that are a dime a dozen?

275
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:59,734
Please, don't quote me the price
when I haven't got the time.

276
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:03,112
- Who is it?
- It's me. Novello.

277
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,243
Bob Wallace and Phil Davis
are out front to catch your act.

278
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,704
- Wallace and Davis?
- They got a letter from your brother.

279
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:13,873
He asked them to take a look
and give you some advice.

280
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,042
Come on now. You'd better hurry.

281
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,338
Isn't that fabulous?
Wallace and Davis here to see us.

282
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:21,881
Yeah, fabulous.

283
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,593
Who'd have thought that of Benny?
What a brother!

284
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:29,222
- What a sweet, wonderful guy!
- Amazing.

285
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,600
I wonder whatever gave him the idea.

286
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,643
Well, he probably knew we were here,
you know,

287
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,853
and that they were in town
with the big show.

288
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:38,522
He probably figured

289
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:42,234
we were too shy to take advantage
of an old Army friendship to call...

290
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,861
Judy, did you read Mother's letter
this morning?

291
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:48,740
- No. Why?
- Benny's got a job in Alaska.

292
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:51,993
He's been out of the country
for three months.

293
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:56,081
Well, he could have written from Alaska.

294
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:57,916
But he didn't, did he?

295
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:03,213
- He might have.
- Judy, why did you write the letter?

296
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:05,924
Well...

297
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,593
Because it's good business.
You can't leave everything up to fate.

298
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:13,722
Just like honesty needs a little plus,
fate needs a little push.

299
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,891
Judy, next time,
will you talk to me first

300
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,894
before you push us and plus us
right out of show business?

301
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:20,896
You needn't sound so patronizing.

302
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:24,567
You sound just like a mother hen
looking after a little chick.

303
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:27,069
Well, little chick needs
plenty of looking after.

304
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,154
Until someone else comes along
who can do it better,

305
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:32,032
mother hen's gonna stick pretty close
to the coop.

306
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,743
- All right, girls, five minutes.
- Thank you.

307
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:37,955
Honey, you look beautiful tonight.
He'll be crazy about you.

308
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:39,623
Which one?

309
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,793
What does it matter?
They're both famous.

310
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,632
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Haynes Sisters.

311
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:07,233
Can you imagine Freckle-Face
having sisters as cute as that?

312
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:08,526
It's incredible!

313
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:12,655
<i>~ Sisters, sisters ~</i>

314
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:16,159
<i>~ There were never such devoted sisters ~</i>

315
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:19,787
<i>~ Never had to have a chaperone no, sir ~</i>

316
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:23,332
<i>~ I'm here to keep my eye on her ~</i>

317
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,919
<i>~ Caring, sharing ~</i>

318
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:30,505
<i>~ Every little thing that we are wearing ~</i>

319
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:34,051
<i>~ When a certain gentleman ~</i>
<i>~ Arrived from Rome ~</i>

320
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:37,679
<i>~ She wore the dress ~</i>
<i>~ And I stayed home ~</i>

321
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:41,099
<i>~ All kinds of weather ~</i>
<i>~ We stick together ~</i>

322
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:44,853
<i>~ The same in the rain or sun ~</i>

323
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:48,231
<i>~ Two different faces ~</i>
<i>~ But in tight places ~</i>

324
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,027
<i>~ We think and we act as one ~</i>

325
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:55,405

326
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:59,075
<i>~ Know that not a thing ~</i>

327

00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,502
<i>~ Lord help the mister ~</i>

329
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,047
<i>~ Who comes between me and my sister ~</i>

330
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:16,592
<i>~ And Lord help the sister ~</i>

331
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,887
<i>~ Who comes between me and my man ~</i>

332
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:40,615
- How about those big brown eyes?
- No, they're blue.

333
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,034
Brown.

334
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,745
Blue.

335
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,418
Yeah, deep blue.

336
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:04,931
- Hello.
- Hello.

337
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,100
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

338
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:09,560
Won't you sit there,
and you sit right here?

339
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:12,688
There, that's cozier, isn't it?
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

340
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:14,565
Well, I'm Betty,
and this is my sister, Judy.

341
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,276
And you're Phil Davis,
and you're Mr. Wallace.

342
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:20,070
- Guilty on both counts, I guess.
- Isn't this nice?

343
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:22,072
Mr. Wallace was just saying
how remarkable it was

344
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,118
that Benny Haynes' sisters
should have eyes... I mean, blue eyes.

345
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:30,164
- That is, eyes...
- Nice out.

346
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:31,707
That's quite an act you kids have there.

347
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,543
It's a funny thing Benny never told us
there's so much talent in the family.

348
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,003
Well, to be perfectly honest...

349
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:39,298
Benny didn't want to take advantage
of an old Army friendship.

350
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:43,052
You know how shy he is,
so modest and retiring.

351
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:47,096
- It's a family characteristic.
- I have a recent snapshot here.

352
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:56,272
He always was a good-looking kid.

353
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,650
Speaking of families,

354
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:02,779
I read an article just the other day
about citrus fruit

355
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:05,531
and its effect on children's teeth.

356
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:10,787
Are you interested in families
or children

357
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:13,164
- or things like that, Miss Haynes?
- Yes, I suppose so.

358
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:15,666
- Oh, man, nix, nix.
- Isn't that amazing?

359
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,418
Imagine a girl in show business today,

360
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:20,212
wanting to settle down
and raising a family.

361
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:23,090
- It's so refreshing, isn't it?
- Pushing, pushing.

362
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:26,176
- Well, would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

363
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:28,678
I, for one,
would like a little free advice.

364
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:32,015
Mr. Wallace, do you have
any suggestions for the act?

365
00:24:32,183 --> 00:24:34,392
No. Just keep plugging away.

366
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:39,022
But there must be something.
Should we both be blondes?

367
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,733
Maybe Betty's hair
should go a shade darker?

368
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:45,904
Or should she maybe change the style?
A little more off the face?

369
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,661
- No. I wouldn't change a thing.
- Would you care to dance?

370
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:56,580
- Don't you think we should discuss...
- Let's say it with music.

371
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:57,957
All right.

372
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:02,545
Now, promise you won't say anything
important till I get back. Bye, now.

373
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:11,929
- They look well together, don't they?
- Yes.

374
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:15,432
Say, I was sure surprised to get
Benny's letter today. I didn't know...

375
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
Look, Mr. Wallace, before you
go any further, I must tell you,

376
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,564
you were brought here tonight
under false pretenses.

377
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:24,150
Benny didn't write the letter,
my sister did.

378
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:25,317
Judy?

379
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:27,570
She figured you'd never come
to see us if we asked you,

380
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:30,156
and you might if Benny did.
As simple as that.

381
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:34,159
How do you like that? Even little
Judy there's got an angle going.

382
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,911
- She didn't mean anything by it...
- You don't have to apologize.

383
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,080
Everybody's got an angle.

384
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:43,459
- That's a pretty cynical point of view.
- Come, come now, Miss Haynes.

385
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,254
Surely you knew that everybody's got
a little larceny operating in them.

386
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:47,755
- Didn't you know?
- Just for the record,

387
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,757
I want you to know that
my sister and I don't play angles.

388
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,427
Well, if that letter wasn't an angle,
I'd like to know what it was.

389
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:55,597
- I don't like your whole inferences.
- I've got no squawks, no beefs.

390
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,557
The kid played a percentage,
it worked and we're here.

391
00:25:57,725 --> 00:26:01,102
Let's not make
a whole big mish-mosh out of it.

392
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,732
- They're getting along just fine.
- And so quickly, too.

393
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Isn't that nice?

394
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,026
All I'm saying is, when you've been
around show business

395
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,529
as long as I have, you just get used
to people working angles, that's all.

396
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,781
Mr. Wallace, as the chance
of our seeing each other again

397
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:19,286
is extremely remote, I don't think it's
important for us to go on arguing.

398
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:23,081
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- Be my guest.

399
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,962
Hey, if this keeps up, we'll practically
be in-laws before the dance is over.

400
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,006
Well, I don't mind, if you don't.

401
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,383
Yeah, it's too bad
we're leaving town tonight.

402
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:37,846
That is a shame,
but we're leaving tomorrow, anyway.

403
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,182
- Where are you going?
- Vermont.

404
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,851
- We're booked for the holidays.
- Vermont?

405
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,855
Vermont should be beautiful this time
of the year, with all that snow.

406
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:52,818
- Yeah... You know something?
- What?

407
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,821
Vermont should be beautiful
this time of year.

408
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,784
- All that snow.
- That's what I just said.

409
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,787
We seem to be getting a little mixed up.

410
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:07,291
- Maybe it's the music.
- Maybe it isn't only the music.

411
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:30,188
<i>~ The best things happen ~</i>
<i>~ While you're dancing ~</i>

412
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:36,027
<i>~ Things that you would not do at home ~</i>
<i>~ Come naturally on the floor ~</i>

413
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:43,535

00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:57,589

418
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:09,226

419
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:20,237

00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:23,407

<i>~ Happen while you dance ~</i>

431
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:42,834
What is this?
The best two out of three?

432
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:47,046
- I guess I got carried away.
- Yeah, she carried me right with her.

433
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:48,923
I don't weigh very much.

434
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:51,134
We'd better change for the last number.

435
00:30:51,302 --> 00:30:53,219
- See you after the show.
- The sheriff's here.

436
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,721
He's in my office with a warrant
to arrest both of you.

437
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,390
- The sheriff?
- What's up? What's the trouble?

438
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:00,350
The landlord claims
we burnt a hole in the rug,

439
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,728
and he's trying to hold us up for $200.

440
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,730
No, not that old rug routine.

441
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:07,441
And on top of that,
we sneaked our bags out of our room.

442
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,151
- Where are they?
- In our dressing room.

443
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,278
Dressing room. Look, I'll tell you what.

444
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:13,322
You girls go and pack.
Bob and I'll take care of this.

445
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,240
No, no, no, no.
We don't want to cause you any trouble.

446
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:17,451
- It's no trouble, honey.
- I know, but Mr. Wallace already...

447
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:19,286
Will you stop worrying
about Mr. Wallace?

448
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:20,871
We like to take care of our friends.

449
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,874
- We're practically strangers.
- We'd like to take care of that, too.

450
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,585
But you might get yourself
in an awful jam. Why should you?

451
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:30,338
- I mean, what's in it for you?
- Forty-five minutes all to myself.

452
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:31,589
- What?
- Now, come on. Will you hurry, girls?

453
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,842
Come on. Come on. Go on. You go back
to the office and stall the sheriff.

454
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,595
- But, Mr. Davis, how will I stall...
- Make up a story. Tell him anything.

455
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,681
Tell him the girls have
to finish the show or something.

456
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:46,229
Bob. All right, Bob, the girls
are in jam. We'll have to help them.

457
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:48,773
- What's the beef?
- Come on. They're in big trouble now.

458
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:52,610
- What's the picture?
- Somebody is trying to get... Come on.

459
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:57,323
Let me ask you something.
Why don't we pay the fellow the $200?

460
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:59,534
Are you kidding?
Pay off a chiseling rat like that?

461
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,911
Will you send a cab out back,
and I'll meet you in the dressing room?

462
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,246
I don't know how I get mixed up
in these things.

463
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:04,997
Why do I listen to you?
Give me one good reason.

464
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:07,958
Let's just say we're doing it
for an old pal in the Army.

465
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,378
- It's not good, but it's a reason.
- Will you go on?

466
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,673
You kids get down to the station
and hop on a train.

467
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,966
- Here, Phil.
- We can't.

468
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,592
Our tickets aren't good until tomorrow.

469
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,970
But you've got to get out tonight.

470
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:24,182
Tickets. Wait a minute. Here,
take these. Now, get going. Come on.

471
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,309
We can't take your tickets.
What will Mr. Wallace think?

472
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,603
Well, honey, it was his idea.
Now, will you please get going?

473
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:30,397
- His idea? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:31,648
He won't think
it's some kind of an angle?

475
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:36,027
I told you it was his idea.
Now, come on. Upsy-daisy. Here we go!

476
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:37,445
That's right.

477
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,739
We'll pay you back.
Where can we reach you?

478
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:41,865
Don't worry. We'll be in touch. Come on.

479
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,201
Our trunks, our phonograph
and the recording.

480
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:47,329
Honey, we'll get them to you. Would
you please go? The taxi is coming.

481
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:48,956
- Don't stop for anything. Bye.
- Bye, Phil.

482
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:50,541
- Here.
- Here.

483
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,336
- Open the door. Bye.
- Bye, now.

484
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:03,345
And I can't stall him much longer.

485
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,347
Hey, whatever happened
to paying the $200?

486
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:07,891
Well, we've got to give the girls
five or ten minutes' start.

487
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,059
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

488
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:11,145
If you could just stall him
for just a few minutes.

489
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,188
I'll try, but he's eating me
out of business already.

490
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,649
- Well, keep punching, will you?
- OK.

491
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:17,191
Come on, Bob, I think this will work.

492
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,693
I got a feeling I'm not gonna like it.

493
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:20,111
I got a feeling you're gonna hate it.

494
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,821
- What am I doing it for?
- Let's just say

495
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:23,323
we're doing it for a pal in the Army.

496
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know. I've heard that...

497
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:30,622
Listen, Sheriff, I haven't got all night
to wait here while you eat free food.

498
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,207
You got your warrant,
now arrest those girls.

499
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,877
Now, we agreed to let them finish
their show first.

500
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:38,963
I didn't agree. It was his idea.

501
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:40,757
I got some rights, too.

502
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:43,092
You don't get those girls
till after they've done their number.

503
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,470
Well, how long is it going to take?

504
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,349
Well, it'll only be...
Wait a minute, there's their music.

505
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:54,561
- How's your coffee holding up? Yeah.
- Warm it up a little.

506
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:58,899
Ladies and gentlemen,
an impromptu surprise for you.

507
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:01,818
The Haynes Sisters.

508
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:13,914
<i>~ Sisters, sisters ~</i>

509
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:17,751
<i>~ There were never such devoted sisters ~</i>

510
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,505
<i>~ Never had to have a chaperone no, sir ~</i>

511
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:25,008
<i>~ I'm here to keep my eye on her ~</i>

512
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,761
<i>~ Caring, sharing ~</i>

513
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,431
<i>~ Every little thing that we are wearing ~</i>

514
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,102
<i>~ When a certain gentleman ~</i>
<i>~ Arrived from Rome ~</i>

515
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:39,438
<i>~ She wore the dress ~</i>
<i>~ And I stayed home ~</i>

516
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:43,401
<i>~ All kinds of weather ~</i>
<i>~ We stick together ~</i>

517
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:46,445
<i>~ The same in the rain or sun ~</i>

518
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:50,700
<i>~ Two different faces ~</i>
<i>~ But in tight places ~</i>

519
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:53,577
<i>~ We think and we act as one ~</i>

520
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:58,165
<i>~ Those who've seen us ~</i>

521
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,919
<i>~ Know that not a thing ~</i>
<i>~ Could come between us ~</i>

522
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:06,339
<i>~ Many men have tried to split us up ~</i>
<i>~ But no one can ~</i>

523
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:12,637
<i>~ Lord help the mister ~</i>

524
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:16,266
<i>~ Who comes between me and my sister ~</i>

525
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:19,978
<i>~ And Lord help the sister ~</i>

526
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:23,273
<i>~ Who comes between me and my man ~</i>

527
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:28,157
<i>~ Sisters! ~</i>

528
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:31,558
<i>~ Sisters! ~</i>

529
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:38,163
<i>~ Sister, don't come between me ~</i>
<i>~ And my man ~</i>

530
00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:52,301
Hey, we're a smash. Let's take a bow.

531
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:56,221
Are you crazy? We'll be taking a bow
down at the jailhouse. Come on.

532
00:35:57,223 --> 00:36:00,184
- Hey! Hey, you!
- The sheriff!

533
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,231
- Open up! Come on. Open up.
- You've done it again.

534
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:09,568
It was your fault.
If we get out of this...

535
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:14,198
Let's go.

536
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:16,199
Taxi!

537
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:21,788
- Boy, girl, boy, girl.
- Let's get over the... Hold this.

538
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,378
Here we go.

539
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,053
You gentlemen made it just in time.

540
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:39,472
- Is this the right car...
- You say you have space on this train?

541
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,307
Show him the tickets, buster.

542
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:42,892
- Tickets?
- The tickets.

543
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,686
- Tickets. Yeah.
- Yes.

544
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:47,563
Hold this just a minute.

545
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,774
- What's the matter with you?
- No. I'm looking for the tickets.

546
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,608
- Get them up.
- I'll get them.

547
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,901
- Railroad tickets...
- Yeah.

548
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:56,613
I have the... No, it's...

549
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,074
I don't seem to have them.
Maybe you've got them, Bob.

550
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:01,952
Me? You crazy?
I saw you put them in your pocket.

551
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,247
Well, they're gone. They're gone.
I must have left them in my girdle.

552
00:37:05,414 --> 00:37:07,249
Gentlemen, either you have tickets
or you haven't tickets.

553
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:08,917
We've got a drawing room.

554
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:11,378
Every available space
on this train is occupied.

555
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:13,380
However, if you care
to purchase tickets,

556
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:15,382
you can sit up all night
in the club car.

557
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,677
Well, that's fine.
How much are two fares to New York?

558
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:21,847
Now, let me see. $97.24.

559
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:25,308
- How much more is it to Vermont?
- Vermont? We're going to New York.

560
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,894
It must be beautiful this time of year
in Vermont, Bob. All that snow?

561
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:31,230
- Two tickets to New York.
- How much more to Vermont?

562
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:33,065
Vermont? Who cares?
Who's going to Vermont?

563
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:36,694
We are. I mean, we should.
It'll do us a lot of good, Bob,

564
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:40,781
all that snow and the fir trees
and the clean fresh air and...

565
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,324
Great change of pace,
just what we need.

566
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:46,704
- Two tickets to New York.
- It's still $97.24 though.

567
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:51,041
- OK, buster, get it out. Come on.
- I don't seem to have any cash.

568
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:54,795
What did you do with that?
Leave it in your snood? Here.

569
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:58,632
- $97.24.
- OK. There you are.

570
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,594
- Where are you going?
- It's for breakfast.

571
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,469
- Breakfast! Get some peanuts.
- All right.

572
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:04,846
- Club car's straight ahead.
- OK.

573
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,472
Excuse me, gentlemen.

574
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,142
I certainly don't get this.
We had space in our names.

575
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,768
They're not allowed to give it away
to somebody else.

576
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:14,939
Well, with the holiday rush and all
there could have been a slip-up.

577
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:18,151
- Excuse me.
- The club car's in there, I think.

578
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,826
Well, this is great, just great.

579
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:29,495
We've paid for our tickets twice,
and now we've got to sit up all night.

580
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:30,830
What are you screaming about?

581
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:33,124
If we took a plane,
we'd be sitting up all night.

582
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,293
We're not taking a plane.
We're taking a train,

583
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,587
a train on which we had tickets.

584
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:41,340
Tickets for a drawing room with
two nice, warm, soft comfortable beds,

585
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:44,009
where, at this very moment, two...

586
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:49,973
No, you wouldn't do this to me.

587
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,478
- Wouldn't do what?
- After you dressed me up like a dame,

588
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:55,771
you get me involved with a sheriff.

589
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:59,900
I almost lose my life
trying to catch a train. I know...

590
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:02,694
I just know on top of all that,

591
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:06,239
you wouldn't take away
my nice warm bed

592
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:09,618
and let me spend the night
out here in a drafty old club car.

593
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,538
You wouldn't do this to old Bob,
would you?

594
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:15,498
Whatever are you talking about?

595
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,961
I'm going down there to Drawing
Room A, I'm gonna open up that door,

596
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:23,297
and if I find those two Haynes sisters
there, I'm gonna take them by the hair

597
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:25,716
and with these two hands I'm...

598
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:28,636
Mr. Wallace,
how can we ever thank you?

599
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,888
It was really so sweet
and generous of you.

600
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:33,599
Mr. Davis told us you insisted
on giving us the tickets,

601
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,559
and, well, it was just wonderful of you.

602
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:39,230
Wasn't there something
you wanted to say to the girls?

603
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:44,402
Yeah. Won't you have a drink
or a sandwich or something?

604
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:45,736
- Let's sit down.
- Yeah, sit down.

605
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:47,113
Can we have some club sandwiches?

606
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,699
- I'd like lemonade, please.
- I'll have a malt, please.

607
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:53,994
- We're emceeing the joint.
- This is cozy, boy, girl, girl, boy.

608
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,499
Tell me, where are you kids
going to stay in New York?

609
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,960
We're not staying in New York.
We're booked for over the holidays.

610
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:05,171
- Where?
- The Columbia Inn, Pine Tree, Vermont.

611
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:12,929
That sounds very Vermont-y.

612
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:14,806
Should be beautiful this time
of the year in Vermont,

613
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:17,225
- all that snow and everything.
- Yeah, yeah, beautiful.

614
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:20,311
The fir trees, the clean pine air.

615
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,022
Very beautiful. Just what we need.

616
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:25,692
Wonderful. Could you come up
for a couple of days?

617
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,109
Well, I don't know...

618
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:29,778
I wish you could.
It would be awfully nice.

619
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,495
Miss Haynes,
if you're ever under a falling building

620
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,789
and somebody runs up
and offers to pick you up

621
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:43,584
and carry you to safety, don't think,
don't pause, don't hesitate a moment,

622
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:45,627
just spit in his eye.

623
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:48,422
- What did that mean?
- It means we're going to Vermont.

624
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,132
Oh, boy!

625
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,426
Might not be bad at that, you know.

626
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:55,471
The snow-covered slopes, the skiing,

627
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:59,141
Christianas and the stemming
and the platzing and the schussing.

628
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:02,810
Hot buttered rum,
light on the butter, snow.

629
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:09,260
<i>~ - Snow, snow ~</i>
<i>~ - Snow, snow ~</i>

630
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,161
<i>~ Snow ~</i>

631
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:16,240
<i>~ It won't be long ~</i>
<i>~ Before we'll all be there with snow ~</i>

632
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:19,994
<i>~ Snow, snow ~</i>

633
00:41:20,162 --> 00:41:24,832
<i>~ I want to wash my hands ~</i>
<i>~ My face and hair with snow ~</i>

634
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:30,797
<i>~ Snow, I long to clear a path ~</i>

635
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:33,841
<i>~ And lift a spade of snow ~</i>

636
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:37,678
<i>~ Snow, oh ~</i>

637
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:42,766
<i>~ To see a great big man ~</i>
<i>~ Entirely made of snow ~</i>

638
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,434
<i>~ Snow ~</i>

639
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:48,522
<i>~ Where it's snowing all winter through ~</i>

640
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:51,525
<i>~ That's where I want to be ~</i>

641
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:55,028
<i>~ Snowball throwing ~</i>
<i>~ That's what I'll do ~</i>

642
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:57,989
<i>~ How I'm longing to ski ~</i>

643
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:00,826
<i>~ - Through the snow ~</i>
<i>~ - Snow ~</i>

644
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:05,705
<i>~ Those glistening houses ~</i>
<i>~ That seem to be built of snow ~</i>

645
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:09,543
<i>~ Snow, oh ~</i>

646
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,547
<i>~ To see a mountain covered ~</i>
<i>~ With a quilt of snow ~</i>

647
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:20,010
<i>~ - What is Christmas with no snow? ~</i>
<i>~ - What is Christmas with no snow? ~</i>

648
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:25,057
<i>~ - No white Christmas with no snow ~</i>
<i>~ - No snow ~</i>

649
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:27,309
<i>~ - Snow ~</i>
<i>~ - Snow ~</i>

650
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:31,272
<i>~ I'll soon be there with snow ~</i>

651
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:34,775
<i>~ I'll wash my hair with snow ~</i>

652
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:37,486
<i>~ And with a spade of snow ~</i>

653
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:41,365
<i>~ I'll build a man that's made of snow ~</i>

654
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:45,786
<i>~ I'd love to stay up with you ~</i>
<i>~ But I recommend a little shuteye ~</i>

655
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:48,956
<i>~ Go to sleep ~</i>

656
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:52,292
<i>~ And dream ~</i>

657
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:55,795
<i>~ - Of snow ~</i>
<i>~ - Snow ~</i>

658
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:57,589
<i>~ - Snow, snow ~</i>
<i>~ - Snow, snow ~</i>

659
00:42:57,756 --> 00:43:01,843
<i>~ Snow ~</i>

660
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:23,031
Pine Tree. Coming in to Pine Tree.

661
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,658
- Hi.
- Good morning, merry sunshine.

662
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:28,493
- How did you sleep?
- Like a baby.

663
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:29,912
I always love sleeping on trains.

664
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,623
Yeah? You remember
Nanook of the North.

665
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,792
You wound up on the shelf?
Must've lost the toss.

666
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
- Let me help you down.
- All right.

667
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,254
- Let's go visit the firemen.
- Yes.

668
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:48,472
- Your strategy's a little obvious.
- You don't really mind, do you?

669
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,973
- But I got a flash for you.
- What?

670
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:51,350
She's a real slow mover.

671
00:43:51,517 --> 00:43:54,728
Honey, I got a flash right back for you.
She's in there with the champ.

672
00:43:54,896 --> 00:43:56,313
Looks like our work's cut out for us.

673
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:59,399
Will you leave it to me?
I've got a whole plan worked out.

674
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,108
Come on, let's go.

675
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:08,741
Hey! Hey, Bob, Betty, Judy, come here.

676
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:10,201
I think we took the wrong train.

677
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:11,369
- What?
- What's the matter?

678
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:13,287
Well, it's all green out here.

679
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,499
We're still in Carolina.

680
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:26,676
They must have
grass-covered igloos up here.

681
00:44:26,843 --> 00:44:28,636
- Here, honey.
- Let me help you with that.

682
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:32,223
- This is warmer than Florida.
- Where's the beach?

683
00:44:32,391 --> 00:44:33,557
We should have brought
our bathing suits.

684
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:35,184
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

685
00:44:35,352 --> 00:44:37,769
Is this Vermont,
New England's winter playground?

686
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:40,855
- You sure this is the right Vermont?
- This must be southern Vermont.

687
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:43,191
- I just don't understand it.
- Ask Cisco here.

688
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,653
Where's the snow? This is supposed
to be America's snow playground.

689
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:50,865
We haven't had snow since
Thanksgiving. Sixty-eight yesterday.

690
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,367
Car for Columbia Inn this way.

691
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:53,618
- That's us. Let's go.
- Yeah.

692
00:44:53,786 --> 00:44:56,288
Well, must be wonderful up
in Vermont this time of the year.

693
00:44:56,455 --> 00:44:57,956
All that underwear!

694
00:44:58,124 --> 00:45:00,041
Gosh, I hope
I can take the electric blanket back.

695
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:01,710
- Where do you got that?
- Under the underwear.

696
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:04,087
You'll get a nice tan.

697
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:07,992
<i>~ - Snow, snow ~</i>
<i>~ - Snow, snow ~</i>

698
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:09,493
<i>~ Snow ~</i>

699
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,720
<i>~ It won't be long ~</i>
<i>~ Before we'll all be there with... ~</i>

700
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:14,680
<i>~ Little old snowflakes ~</i>
<i>~ Eskimo pie ~</i>

701
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:17,349
<i>~ Chocolate and vanilla for you and I ~</i>

702
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,750
- Well...
- It's real nice.

703
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:44,376
- Aren't you glad you came now?
- Very Vermont-y.

704
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:47,546
You'll be able to do all the schussing
and the platzing and everything, see?

705
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:50,590
We hope to find the snow here.

706
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:53,926
Welcome to Columbia Inn. What sort
of accommodations would you like?

707
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:58,014
I can offer you a fairly wide choice.
Any room in the inn, including mine.

708
00:45:58,182 --> 00:46:01,100
We're not here as guests.
We're the Haynes Sisters.

709
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,978
My friend and I are guests.
We came up for the snow.

710
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:07,440
- Where are you keeping it?
- Well, we take it in during the day.

711
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:10,276
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid
we won't be able to use you.

712
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,570
We'll pay you the half salary
for canceling.

713
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:14,489
Well, are things really that bad?

714
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:17,658
We're using the ski tow
to hang the wash on.

715
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,285
You aren't gonna stay either, are you?

716
00:46:19,453 --> 00:46:23,873
Well, if the girls are leaving,
I'll just get the luggage here.

717
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:26,083
Thank you, sir.

718
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,918
General Waverly!

719
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,046
- Sir.
- At ease.

720
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:36,218
- How are you, Captain?
- I'm fine, General, but...

721
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:39,304
We just try to keep
the "general" part quiet.

722
00:46:39,472 --> 00:46:42,265
Why? Begging your pardon, sir.

723
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,644
Well, to put it in one sentence,

724
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:49,648
people don't expect a major general
to carry firewood.

725
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:52,317
Bob, I was just thinking... Hi. I was...

726
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,029
Private Davis, sir.

727
00:46:56,864 --> 00:46:58,198
At ease, Davis.

728
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:02,576
General Waverly! A janitor!

729
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:06,247
- Never thought I'd make it?
- Yes, sir. Sir.

730
00:47:06,415 --> 00:47:08,707
You could do anything
you put your mind to, sir.

731
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,502
But a janitor!

732
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,673
Matter of fact, it's worse than that.
I own this hotel.

733
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:19,677
- A landlord.
- He got it in a shrewd business move.

734
00:47:19,845 --> 00:47:22,430
If I start the introductions,

735
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:26,142
- can I get to meet these young ladies?
- Why, sure.

736
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:30,229
My housekeeper, Miss Emma Allen.
My granddaughter, Susan Waverly.

737
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:31,397
- Susan.
- Hello.

738
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:34,316
- We're the Haynes Sisters.
- Your floor show.

739
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,485
Don't worry, I've already told them
we'd have to cancel.

740
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:40,530
Why? We have a floor, haven't we?

741
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:44,033
Last time I looked.
But who are they gonna sing to?

742
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,619
Well, even if it's only to you and me,
it'll be well worth it.

743
00:47:46,787 --> 00:47:50,206
Besides, there'll be six inches of snow
tonight. We'll be full up tomorrow.

744
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:51,833
Is that the weather forecast?

745
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,587
No, but if there was one thing I learned
in the Army, it was to be positive,

746
00:47:55,754 --> 00:47:59,132
especially when you don't know
what you're talking about.

747
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,302
General Waverly, we want you to know
that you needn't feel obligated.

748
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,972
- I mean, since there's no snow...
- Nonsense. We've made a contract.

749
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,601
Your first performance
is tonight at 8:00.

750
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:12,978
- Be there or I'll sue!
- Here.

751
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:18,734
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm on KP.

752
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:20,569
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

753
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:28,368
<i>~ Those who've seen us ~</i>

754
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:31,663
<i>~ Know that not a thing ~</i>
<i>~ Could come between us ~</i>

755
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:36,376
<i>~ Many men have tried to split us up ~</i>
<i>~ But no one can ~</i>

756
00:48:38,421 --> 00:48:41,215
<i>~ Lord help the mister ~</i>

757
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:44,510
<i>~ Who comes between me and my sister ~</i>

758
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:47,803
<i>~ And Lord help the sister ~</i>

759
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:50,765
<i>~ Who comes between me and my man ~</i>

760
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:59,607
We ate, and then he ate.
We slept, then he slept.

761
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:03,194
Yeah, then he woke up
and nobody slept for 48 hours.

762
00:49:03,987 --> 00:49:05,050
<i>~ Sisters ~</i>

763
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:08,451
<i>~ Sisters ~</i>

764
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:16,999
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

765
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,834
You know what?
I think Bob and I could give you

766
00:49:19,002 --> 00:49:21,128
some pointers on that Sister number.

767
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:24,381
- I don't like the wardrobe.
- But it's so purdy.

768
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,927
Isn't this awful? It's like
taking money under false pretenses.

769
00:49:29,095 --> 00:49:31,846
Emma, couldn't you talk him into
letting us work for half salary?

770
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,808
Not Light Horse Harry.
"Advance, advance, never retreat."

771
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:37,310
- He's advancing into bankruptcy.
- How deep's he in here?

772
00:49:37,478 --> 00:49:39,437
He sunk everything,
his pension, his life savings,

773
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:41,147
everything in remodeling this place!

774
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:44,859
It used to be a gristmill and a barn.
Now, it's a Tyrolean haunted house.

775
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:47,195
Well, eat hearty!

776
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,990
There ought to be
something we can do about it.

777
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,450
Well, there is. We're going
to New York in the morning.

778
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:54,494
- New York?
- But you just got here!

779
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:56,329
We got some connections there,
some good ones.

780
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:57,831
We can dig him up a spot somewhere.

781
00:49:57,999 --> 00:50:00,749
Yeah, but that takes too long.
The problem is here, now.

782
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:03,002
We've got to stay up here
and dream up some way

783
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:04,628
of getting people
to come into this place.

784
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:07,172
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

785
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,092
It should be something unusual,
some kind of a novelty...

786
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,137
Tell me, brainstorm, what do you think
would be a novelty up here in Vermont?

787
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:16,056
Who knows?
Maybe we can dig up a Democrat?

788
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,850
They'd stone him!

789
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:21,812
Well, if you ask me, what this place
really needs is a dynamite act.

790
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,857
Now, you're talking.
If we could get something really big.

791
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:27,318
- Something sock, like...
- Like Wallace and Davis.

792
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,695
No, honey, you couldn't get them.
They're too big.

793
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:32,406
Wait a minute. Wallace and Davis.
How about that, Bob?

794
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:36,075
We could do our old nightclub act,
fit the girls in here and there.

795
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:38,786
- Might be wonderful. What do you say?
- I think you got something.

796
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:41,372
It's a great idea.
It's half a great idea, anyhow.

797
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,043
Will you excuse me? Young lady,
get me the New York operator.

798
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,337
OK, Mr. Wallace. This way.

799
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:52,884
I don't know what he's up to,
but he's got that

800
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:54,761
Rodgers & Hammerstein look again.

801
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:58,431
- Is that bad?
- Not bad, but always expensive.

802
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:00,767
Excuse me.

803
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:07,565
I know it sounds crazy, Al,
but you're working for crazy people.

804
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:10,776
Now, get this straight. I want
the whole show up here in three days.

805
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:14,404
Yeah, the whole show. Sets, costumes
and all the cast you can round up.

806
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,781
Hey, wait a minute.
What's this gonna cost?

807
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,408
Everybody gets an extra week's pay
and you get a bonus, Al.

808
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,078
- What's this gonna cost?
- We open Christmas Eve.

809
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,163
The tab! How much?

810
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:27,042
Al, what's this gonna set us back?

811
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,962
- Wow!
- How much is "wow"?

812
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,965
Well, OK, Al, do the best you can.
Good luck.

813
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,010
- How much is "wow"?
- We got a big job, buster, a big job.

814
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,304
Whatever acts we can't get,
we fill in with the Haynes Sisters.

815
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:44,142
- How much is "wow"?
- Right in between "ouch" and "boing."

816
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,894
- Wow! I'm right behind you.
- Come along.

817
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,607
I won't tell the general,
you do it your own way,

818
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,443
but I think bringing your show up here
is just one of the nicest...

819
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,653
How did you know?

820
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,780
Well, like any decent,
self-respecting housekeeper,

821
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,950
I listen in on the other phone.
I just don't know what to say.

822
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,288
- He thought of it.
- Well, it was a lovely thought.

823
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,502
- Wow!
- Let's get hold of yourself. Come on.

824
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,799
Hurry up, kids. Check in the lobby
for your room numbers.

825
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,884
Put your bags backstage.

826
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,305
Everybody grab his own suitcases.
Let's not get mixed up now.

827
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:26,891
The wardrobe trunk's in the hall.

828
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:30,562
Let's go, let's go, we got to get
started hanging those drapes.

829
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:33,398
All right, kids, find your rooms,
get settled.

830
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:37,152
Get your rehearsal costumes on. We
start rehearsals right after breakfast.

831
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:43,575
I still don't understand it. You mean
you brought your whole show up here?

832
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,828
- Well, most of it, sir.
- Well, it's still not clear to me. Why?

833
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:49,581
Well, we have this show. Now,
we have to close down for the holidays,

834
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,291
lay the cast off, and business is bad...

835
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,043
I know about business being bad. Go on.

836
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,297
Well, we figured
since we had a chance to rehearse,

837
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,047
we might as well do
our rehearsing up here.

838
00:52:59,215 --> 00:53:00,340
Why here?

839
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:02,176
Well, you've got this nice
big empty ski lodge,

840
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:05,053
and the minute Phil and I saw it, we
decided it was ideal. Didn't we, Phil?

841
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:08,056
That's right, Bob. Ideal.
That's exactly the word we used, too.

842
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:11,351
Ideal. We looked at this big ski lodge
and we said, "Isn't it ideal?

843
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,437
- Absolutely ideal." Didn't we?
- Ideal.

844
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:15,814
We've established the fact
the lodge is ideal.

845
00:53:15,982 --> 00:53:18,859
And it gives us a chance, you see,
sir, to test new material.

846
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:20,110
- On what?
- On the audience.

847
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:22,070
We use them like guinea pigs.

848
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:25,741
Pigs, we can get for you.
I'm not so sure about people.

849
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,618
Well, with all due modesty, sir,

850
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:30,704
Wallace and Davis never had
any trouble packing them in, sir.

851
00:53:30,872 --> 00:53:34,582
- People that is, not pigs.
- Well, go ahead, if you want to.

852
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,710
Apparently, there's quite a bit about
show business I don't understand.

853
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:40,046
- It'll come to you, sir.
- Just takes time.

854
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:42,632
Sure. We wouldn't be
any good as generals.

855
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,009
You weren't any good as privates.

856
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:49,055
All right, kids,
take it from the top once again.

857
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:54,393
That's right, that's it.
All right, keep it lively.

858
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:03,110
All right, let's keep it going.
That's good.

859
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:05,196
Keep it up there, honey.

860
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:07,782
Move that lumber over, fellas.

861
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:10,575
Take it over on the other side.

862
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:34,641
<i>~ I'd rather see a minstrel show ~</i>

863
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:37,936
<i>~ Than any other show I know ~</i>

864
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:41,189
<i>~ Oh, those comical folks ~</i>

865
00:54:41,357 --> 00:54:43,316
<i>~ With their riddles and jokes ~</i>

866
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,611
<i>~ Here is the riddle that I love the best ~</i>

867
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:49,321
<i>~ Why does a chicken go... ~</i>

868
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:50,781
<i>~ - You know the rest ~</i>
<i>- Yes, sir</i>

869
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:53,492
<i>~ I'd pawn my overcoat and vest ~</i>

870
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,288
<i>~ To see a minstrel show ~</i>

871
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:15,389
<i>~ Mr. Bones, Mr. Bones ~</i>

872
00:55:15,557 --> 00:55:17,892
<i>~ How do you feel, Mr. Bones? ~</i>

873
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:19,059
Rattling

874
00:55:19,227 --> 00:55:20,686
<i>~ Mr. Bones feels rattling ~</i>

875
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:23,354
<i>~ Ha, ha, that's a good one ~</i>

876
00:55:23,522 --> 00:55:25,982
<i>~ Tell a little story, Mr. Bones ~</i>

877
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,152
<i>~ A funny little story, Mr. Bones ~</i>

878
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:32,697
<i>~ How can you stop an angry dog ~</i>
<i>~ From biting you on Monday? ~</i>

879
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:35,825
<i>~ That joke is old ~</i>
<i>~ The answer is to kill the dog on Sunday ~</i>

880
00:55:35,993 --> 00:55:38,953
<i>~ That's not the way to stop a dog ~</i>
<i>~ From biting you on Monday ~</i>

881
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:41,456
<i>~ How would you bring the thing about? ~</i>

882
00:55:41,624 --> 00:55:43,666
<i>~ Have the doggie's teeth pulled out ~</i>

883
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,669
<i>~ Oh, Mr. Bones, that's terrible ~</i>

884
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:49,631
<i>~ Yes, Mr. Bones, that's terrible ~</i>

885
00:55:56,513 --> 00:55:59,181
<i>~ - Mr. Interloc'ter ~</i>
<i>~ - What is wrong with you? ~</i>

886
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:02,476
<i>~ - Well, I know of a doctor ~</i>
<i>~ - Tell about him, do ~</i>

887
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:04,686
<i>~ Sad to say one day he fell ~</i>

888
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:07,898
<i>~ Right into a great big well ~</i>

889
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:10,859
- Oh, that's too bad
- But not at all

890
00:56:11,027 --> 00:56:13,862
<i>~ Why speak in such a tone? ~</i>

891
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:17,824
<i>~ He should have attended to the sick ~</i>
<i>~ And let the well alone ~</i>

892
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:19,743
<i>~ That's a joke ~</i>

893
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:21,286
<i>~ That was told ~</i>

894
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:23,622
<i>~ In the minstrel days we miss ~</i>

895
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,583
<i>~ When Georgie Primrose used to sing ~</i>

896
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:29,044
<i>~ And dance to a song like this ~</i>

897
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:31,901
<i>~ Mandy ~</i>

898
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,001
<i>~ Mandy ~</i>

899
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:40,902
<i>~ Mandy ~</i>

900
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:47,228
<i>~ Mandy ~</i>
<i>~ There's a minister handy ~</i>

901
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:50,523
<i>~ And it sure would be dandy ~</i>

902
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:53,442
<i>~ If we let him make a fee ~</i>

903
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,570
<i>~ So don't you linger ~</i>

904
00:56:56,738 --> 00:56:59,782
<i>~ Here's a ring for your finger ~</i>

905
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,952
<i>~ Isn't it a humdinger? ~</i>

906
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,579
<i>~ Come along and let the wedding chimes ~</i>

907
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:09,958
<i>~ Bring happy times for Mandy and me ~</i>

908
00:57:10,251 --> 00:57:15,630
<i>~ Mandy, what a gal ~</i>
<i>~ Oh, Mandy ~</i>

909
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,758
<i>~ There's a minister handy ~</i>

910
00:57:18,926 --> 00:57:21,970
<i>~ And it sure would be dandy ~</i>

911
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,680
<i>~ If we let him make a fee ~</i>

912
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:25,598
<i>~ He's got his rent to pay ~</i>
<i>~ So don't delay ~</i>

913
00:57:25,766 --> 00:57:27,976
<i>~ It's not a day to linger ~</i>

914
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:31,312
<i>~ Here's a ring for your finger ~</i>

915
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,106
<i>~ Isn't it a humdinger? ~</i>

916
00:57:33,274 --> 00:57:36,526
<i>~ We advise to live and love ~</i>
<i>~ And honor and obey ~</i>

917
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:41,197
<i>~ Before he gets away ~</i>
<i>~ Make it Mandy and me ~</i>

918
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:56,045
<i>~ The wedding chimes ~</i>

919
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:57,463
<i>~ Bring happy times ~</i>

920
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,174
<i>~ For Mandy and me ~</i>

921
00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:56,162
<i>~ So don't you linger ~</i>

922
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:59,039
<i>~ Here's a ring for your finger ~</i>

923
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:02,168
<i>~ Isn't it a humdinger? ~</i>

924
01:00:02,335 --> 01:00:04,628
<i>~ Come along and let the wedding chimes ~</i>

925
01:00:04,796 --> 01:00:06,005
<i>~ Bring happy times ~</i>

926
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:11,259
<i>~ For Mandy and me ~</i>

927
01:00:19,476 --> 01:00:22,687
- Wonderful!
- This will bring business in, Grandpa.

928
01:00:28,444 --> 01:00:29,944
- Loved it!
- Was everything all right, really?

929
01:00:30,112 --> 01:00:33,448
- All right? Wait till tonight...
- It was sensational!

930
01:00:33,616 --> 01:00:36,743
Judy, was the tempo a little slow
for you right here, honey?

931
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,037
<i>~ Mandy ~</i>

932
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:41,372
<i>~ There's a minister handy ~</i>

933
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,999
Yeah, but you got to drive it there.
You've got to keep it flowing.

934
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:48,962
<i>~ So listen, Mandy ~</i>
<i>~ There's a minister hand... ~</i>

935
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,507
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, I can see that's... better.

936
01:00:52,675 --> 01:00:54,009
That's much better.

937
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,595
Much, much better.

938
01:01:01,017 --> 01:01:03,477
Mandy

939
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:05,646
There's a minister...

940
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,658
Mandy

941
01:01:17,825 --> 01:01:21,077
There's a minister handy

942
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:23,496
- Anything wrong?
- No, I'm just restless.

943
01:01:23,664 --> 01:01:27,708
- Anything on your mind?
- Just restless.

944
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:29,543
Maybe you'd sleep better
if you had something to eat.

945
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:31,295
No, honey, I'm not hungry.

946
01:01:31,463 --> 01:01:33,839
Emma said she left some sandwiches
down in the snack bar.

947
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:36,968
- Judy, go to sleep.
- And some buttermilk.

948
01:01:37,135 --> 01:01:40,137
- Good night, Judy.
- Good night.

949
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:44,934
They say if you eat something right
before you go to bed, it helps to...

950
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,186
- Judy.
- No, no,

951
01:01:47,354 --> 01:01:49,021
it drains the blood from the head,

952
01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:53,025
in case you're thinking of anything
or anybody or just anything.

953
01:01:53,193 --> 01:01:55,777
All right. Fine, OK, swell.

954
01:01:55,945 --> 01:02:00,282
I'll go and get something to eat.
Not because I want something to eat,

955
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:03,535
but because if I don't get something
to eat, you won't go to sleep.

956
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:05,704
- Good night.
- Good night.

957
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:34,189
Hi.

958
01:02:34,357 --> 01:02:38,736
- Well, hello. What's doing?
- I couldn't sleep.

959
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:40,571
You're a little young for that route,
aren't you?

960
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:43,073
Well, I heard something
about sandwiches and buttermilk.

961
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:46,452
Sister, this is the place.
We is loaded here.

962
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:50,831
We got New England blue plate
or the Vermont smorgasbord.

963
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:52,750
Not as flashy as Toots Shor's probably,

964
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:54,626
but I think you'll
find the price is right.

965
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:56,503
- What'll you have?
- Anything.

966
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,922
Tell me what you want to dream about,
I'll know what to give you.

967
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,717
- What's that?
- I got a whole big theory about it.

968
01:03:01,885 --> 01:03:04,636
Different kinds of food
make for different kinds of dreams.

969
01:03:04,804 --> 01:03:06,721
Now, if I have ham and cheese
on rye like that,

970
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:10,808
I dream about a tall cool blonde.
Sort of a first sacker type, you know.

971
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:13,853
Turkey, I dream about a brunette.
A little on the scatback side,

972
01:03:14,021 --> 01:03:16,272
but sexy, sexy.

973
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,609
- What about liverwurst?
- I dream about liverwurst.

974
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:24,447
- It's a little chilly in here, isn't
- it? I got just the spot for you.

975
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:25,948
Here, grab the cow,

976
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:28,785
- and we'll gather round the fire.
- All right.

977
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:33,706
Got a nice open-hearth job here
with some Vermont logs burning briskly.

978
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:35,500
- Isn't this nice?
- Wonderful.

979
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:37,710
- Glad you came?
- It's better than a picnic.

980
01:03:37,878 --> 01:03:40,880
Why, certainly. No sand
or yellow jackets buzzing around.

981
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:42,506
I can't understand what's wrong with me.

982
01:03:42,673 --> 01:03:44,674
I usually don't
have any trouble sleeping.

983
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:47,803
Well, you've come to the right fellow.
Here, sit down.

984
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,181
You know,
I have a theory about that, too.

985
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:53,558
- Would you like to hear it?
- Very much.

986
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:58,230
<i>~ When I'm worried and I can't sleep ~</i>

987
01:03:58,398 --> 01:04:01,358
<i>~ I count my blessings ~</i>

988
01:04:01,526 --> 01:04:04,486
<i>~ Instead of sheep ~</i>

989
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:07,989
<i>~ And I fall asleep ~</i>

990
01:04:08,157 --> 01:04:11,326
<i>~ Counting my blessings ~</i>

991
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:19,333
<i>~ When my bankroll is getting small ~</i>

992
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:24,004
<i>~ I think of when I had none at all ~</i>

993
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:28,592
<i>~ And I fall asleep ~</i>

994
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,764
<i>~ Counting my blessings ~</i>

995
01:04:34,558 --> 01:04:37,685
<i>~ I think about a nursery ~</i>

996
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:41,564
<i>~ And I picture curly heads ~</i>

997
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:46,527
<i>~ And one by one I count them ~</i>

998
01:04:46,695 --> 01:04:51,740
<i>~ As they slumber in their beds ~</i>

999
01:04:53,868 --> 01:04:56,369
<i>~ If you're worried ~</i>

1000
01:04:56,537 --> 01:04:59,956
<i>~ And you can't sleep ~</i>

1001
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:02,709
<i>~ Just count your blessings ~</i>

1002
01:05:02,877 --> 01:05:06,087
<i>~ Instead of sheep ~</i>

1003
01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:10,550
<i>~ And you'll fall asleep ~</i>

1004
01:05:10,718 --> 01:05:16,097
<i>~ Counting your blessings ~</i>

1005
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:27,317
Do you mind if I say something
just for the record?

1006
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:29,027
Of course not.

1007
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:30,569
I think what you're doing
for the general

1008
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:34,239
is one of the most decent,
unselfish things I've ever heard of.

1009
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:36,783
- No angle?
- No angle.

1010
01:05:36,951 --> 01:05:40,204
I want to apologize
for the way I sounded in Florida.

1011
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:42,164
I guess I've always been
kind of a silly schoolgirl.

1012
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:46,001
You know the bit, the lady fair
and the knight on the white horse.

1013
01:05:46,169 --> 01:05:48,170
Let me tell you something,
it's kind of dangerous

1014
01:05:48,338 --> 01:05:50,881
putting those knights
up on white horses.

1015
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:55,302
- They're likely to slip off, you know.
- I think mine's here to stay.

1016
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:57,596
That's sure good to know.

1017
01:05:57,764 --> 01:06:00,057
Makes a fellow feel a little shaky
to hold up there all alone

1018
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:01,808
on one of those bleached chargers.

1019
01:06:01,976 --> 01:06:04,186
- Are you worried?
- Kind of.

1020
01:06:04,354 --> 01:06:06,979
<i>~ If you're worried ~</i>

1021
01:06:07,147 --> 01:06:09,565
<i>~ And you can't sleep ~</i>

1022
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:12,235
<i>~ Just count your blessings ~</i>

1023
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,321
<i>~ Instead of sheep ~</i>

1024
01:06:15,489 --> 01:06:20,409
<i>~ And you'll fall asleep ~</i>

1025
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:25,581
<i>~ Counting your blessings ~</i>

1026
01:06:33,048 --> 01:06:35,132
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1027
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:39,554
I was just after a little something
for a sweet tooth.

1028
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:42,556
I see you've beaten me to it.

1029
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:45,475
You'll find the Vermont smorgasbord
very good, General.

1030
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:47,936
- It'll make you sleep like a baby.
- Thank you.

1031
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:54,859
So you know something?
You still haven't eaten anything.

1032
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:57,237
I know exactly what
I'm going to dream about tonight.

1033
01:06:57,405 --> 01:06:58,822
Good for you.

1034
01:07:12,003 --> 01:07:14,254
Hold your fire, men. I'm coming through.

1035
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:20,342
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning, General.

1036
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:22,469
Looks like you're on active duty.

1037
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:25,347
Yeah, Emma drafted me
for a few chores.

1038
01:07:25,515 --> 01:07:28,267
And I picked up the handbills
for the new show.

1039
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:31,020
Look pretty good?

1040
01:07:31,187 --> 01:07:35,524
Well, that ought to bring in
quite a few guinea pigs.

1041
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:38,068
You ever hook up with the fellows
in the horseshoe game?

1042
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:41,113
No. No, I'm a little too young
for that sort of thing.

1043
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:43,324
Figure a fellow ought to hold off
on horseshoes

1044
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:45,534
till after the parade's passed him by.

1045
01:07:45,702 --> 01:07:47,161
That'll be some time, sir.

1046
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,204
- You get it?
- Thank you.

1047
01:07:49,372 --> 01:07:53,166
Look, Bob, I still don't know too much

1048
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:55,710
about show business and guinea pigs,

1049
01:07:55,878 --> 01:07:59,714
but in case you and Phil
are worried about the welfare

1050
01:07:59,882 --> 01:08:02,675
of a certain Vermont innkeeper,
you needn't be.

1051
01:08:02,843 --> 01:08:07,221
- His inn-keeping days are numbered.
- I wouldn't say that.

1052
01:08:07,389 --> 01:08:10,516
The percentage is gonna catch up
with the weatherman one of these days.

1053
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:13,227
I've been watching those clouds,
and there's snow in them.

1054
01:08:13,395 --> 01:08:16,230
Those are cumulus clouds,
elevation 7,000 feet.

1055
01:08:16,398 --> 01:08:19,525
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be surprised
if it snowed overnight.

1056
01:08:19,693 --> 01:08:22,695
I want to tell you something
I haven't even told the womenfolk.

1057
01:08:22,863 --> 01:08:25,114
- I'm going back in the Army.
- Really?

1058
01:08:25,282 --> 01:08:29,201
- I've applied for active duty.
- Well, that's wonderful news, sir.

1059
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:32,496
I got an idea they may try to palm off
one of those desk jobs on me,

1060
01:08:32,664 --> 01:08:33,664
but they'd better not.

1061
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:36,750
I'm holding out for a training command
or something overseas.

1062
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:37,918
When will you hear, sir?

1063
01:08:38,086 --> 01:08:40,545
I expect a letter
from Washington any day now.

1064
01:08:40,713 --> 01:08:44,091
Holy smoke, I'm really on the boil!
I got the mail right here,

1065
01:08:44,258 --> 01:08:46,134
and I think
there's a letter for you, General.

1066
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:48,929
Yeah. Here it is, from Washington, too.

1067
01:08:49,097 --> 01:08:52,349
- It looks like the one.
- War Department, see?

1068
01:08:52,517 --> 01:08:54,768
I left my... My glasses are in my room.

1069
01:08:54,936 --> 01:09:00,107
I would like to read this by myself,
but I'm a little anxious.

1070
01:09:00,274 --> 01:09:03,318
- Read it, son, slowly.
- All right.

1071
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,403
I'm starting to play
trombone a little, too.

1072
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:08,364
Let's see if I can get focused in here.

1073
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:12,410
- "Dear Tom, why you dirty old..."
- Skip that word.

1074
01:09:13,995 --> 01:09:15,955
"Certainly was a surprise
hearing from you.

1075
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:19,166
Your amusing letter was appreciated
more than you imagine.

1076
01:09:19,334 --> 01:09:21,460
Of course, you've got plenty of time
to be amusing,

1077
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:25,464
sitting on that porch, rocking away,
while we put in a full day's work.

1078
01:09:25,632 --> 01:09:29,135
You always were a lucky stiff,
and I envy you.

1079
01:09:29,302 --> 01:09:32,263
A few years more, I was saying
to Edie the other evening,

1080
01:09:32,431 --> 01:09:34,932
and I'll be able
to take it easy like old Tom."

1081
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,268
Old Tom.

1082
01:09:39,062 --> 01:09:41,104
"Oh, well.
Some people have all the luck.

1083
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:43,481
Everything's fine here.
Carol had the mumps..."

1084
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:46,985
The rest of the letter
is about the family.

1085
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:52,824
He's telling me that they can't use me.
No place for me.

1086
01:09:52,992 --> 01:09:55,160
We're not fooling each other.

1087
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:58,496
Bob, it wouldn't be too hard to

1088
01:09:58,664 --> 01:10:00,623
learn this game of horseshoes.
Now, would it?

1089
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,584
It'd be a cinch.
Begging your pardon, sir,

1090
01:10:02,752 --> 01:10:05,170
but there's really
a lot to be said for leisure.

1091
01:10:05,337 --> 01:10:07,338
Of course, you've always been active,
but in time...

1092
01:10:07,506 --> 01:10:09,674
Never kid a kidder, son.

1093
01:10:10,968 --> 01:10:12,469
See you later.

1094
01:10:15,055 --> 01:10:16,722
That's a good one!

1095
01:10:30,069 --> 01:10:32,362
Fine, fine.
All right, kids, take a rest.

1096
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,698
- I'm sure it's a great...
- Bob? Phil?

1097
01:10:34,866 --> 01:10:36,366
Ready to run through
the Choreography number.

1098
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:37,659
I'll be with you in a minute.

1099
01:10:37,827 --> 01:10:39,369
It's the craziest thing I ever heard of!

1100
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:41,622
How are you gonna get a whole
division up here by Christmas Eve?

1101
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,081
So we don't get a whole division.

1102
01:10:43,249 --> 01:10:45,042
But there must be enough guys
in New England alone

1103
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:47,002
from the old man's outfit
to fill a town this size.

1104
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,338
At least enough guys
to let him know he's not forgotten.

1105
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:51,131
Don't you think
putting the show on will do it?

1106
01:10:51,299 --> 01:10:52,882
Phil, if you'd seen the look in his eyes

1107
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:55,426
when he read that letter
you'd know it wouldn't.

1108
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:57,178
It's gonna take five days
to put the show on, is it?

1109
01:10:57,346 --> 01:10:58,346
That's right.

1110
01:10:58,514 --> 01:11:00,056
How are we gonna get in touch
with all the fellows?

1111
01:11:00,224 --> 01:11:03,142
Television. Ed Harrison.
I'm gonna go put a call in to him now.

1112
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:05,645
I'll go on down to New York, and if I
can swing it, I'll get on his show

1113
01:11:05,813 --> 01:11:07,855
and make a pitch to the guys myself.
What do you think of it?

1114
01:11:08,023 --> 01:11:10,691
I think it's impossible,
ridiculous and insane.

1115
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:14,737
- Anything else?
- Yeah. I wish I'd thought of it first.

1116
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:17,532
You rehearse the number.
I'll put the call in, Bob.

1117
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:20,117
Hey, Johnny, get the kids
for a dress rehearsal, will you?

1118
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,581
Emma? Could you put in
a long-distance call for me?

1119
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,625
I want to get Ed Harrison,
New York City.

1120
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:30,085
- The television Ed Harrison?
- That's the fellow, yeah.

1121
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,670
You'll catch him at Radio City, I think.

1122
01:11:31,838 --> 01:11:34,422
And let's keep it quiet.
This is kind of a personal thing.

1123
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:39,469
Sure, sure. Ed Harrison, television.
Radio City, gee.

1124
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,352
All right, fellas. From the top.

1125
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:35,399
The theater, the theater

1126
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:38,277
What's happened to the theater

1127
01:12:38,445 --> 01:12:42,822
Especially where dancing is concerned?

1128
01:12:44,909 --> 01:12:48,494
<i>~ Chaps ~</i>
<i>~ Who did taps ~</i>

1129
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:54,000
<i>~ Aren't tapping anymore ~</i>
<i>~ They're doing choreography ~</i>

1130
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:58,838
<i>~ Chicks ~</i>
<i>~ Who did kicks ~</i>

1131
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:04,761
<i>~ Aren't kicking anymore ~</i>
<i>~ They're doing choreography ~</i>

1132
01:13:05,971 --> 01:13:10,016
<i>~ Heps ~</i>
<i>~ Who did steps ~</i>

1133
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:14,520
<i>~ That would stop the show ~</i>
<i>~ In days that used to be ~</i>

1134
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:19,024
<i>~ Through the air they keep flying ~</i>

1135
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:21,777
<i>~ Like a duck that is dying ~</i>

1136
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:25,697
<i>~ Instead of dance ~</i>
<i>~ It's choreography ~</i>

1137
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:40,870
Ed, Ed, I know it's a long shot,

1138
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:43,331
but there's no other way
to reach the men in a hurry.

1139
01:15:43,499 --> 01:15:45,041
How does it sound?

1140
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,461
I love the idea of doing
something for the old man.

1141
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:52,215
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't know how to peel a potato!

1142
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:55,051
Look, why don't you go all out?
Put the whole show on TV?

1143
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:58,513
I'll come up there myself,
bring the camera, the crew, the works.

1144
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,892
- Thanks, Ed, but that's not the idea.
- Well, it's a great idea.

1145
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:07,814
Put the show on the whole network
right from Pine Tree. Play it up big.

1146
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,357
A real Christmas Eve show,

1147
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:12,568
all about how you're playing
Santa Claus to the old man, you know.

1148
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:14,861
Plenty of schmaltz, lots of heart.

1149
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:18,031
Would be worth over $100,000
in free advertising for you and Phil.

1150
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,033
And, yeah,
we'll put the old boy on himself,

1151
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:23,745
you know, the forgotten-man angle.
Tear their hearts out.

1152
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,040
Here's the laundry, Emma.

1153
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,127
I'm sorry, Ed. Sorry, but that's out.

1154
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,839
We're not commercializing
on the old man's hard luck. No chance.

1155
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:37,968
All I want to do is go on your show
and make a little pitch. OK?

1156
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:42,430
Wonderful. Wonderful.
See you Sunday night then. Bye.

1157
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,809
- Take it upstairs, Susan.
- All right.

1158
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:54,733
Emma?

1159
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,531
- Was there a telegram for me?
- What?

1160
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:04,743
Yeah! Just an offer
from the Carousel Club in New York,

1161
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,245
anytime you and Judy are available.

1162
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,414
What's your technique?
Holding them up to the light?

1163
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,793
- That's for amateurs. I use steam.
- You're quite a pro.

1164
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,337
I'm thinking of turning in my uniform.

1165
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,047
Stick your nose
in other people's business

1166
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:19,258
and eventually you find out things
you wish you hadn't.

1167
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,260
Anything specific?

1168
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,597
Did you know the boys are planning
to put this whole show on television?

1169
01:17:24,764 --> 01:17:26,598
- Television?
- Right from here, on Christmas Eve.

1170
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:29,976
I just heard Bob fix it with
Ed Harrison. It's a big deal.

1171
01:17:30,144 --> 01:17:32,061
Real schmaltz, I think they called it.

1172
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:35,565
- They're even gonna put the general on.
- I just can't believe it.

1173
01:17:35,733 --> 01:17:38,401
That'll make him a pathetic figure
from coast to coast.

1174
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:40,945
What's it gonna do to his pride?

1175
01:17:41,113 --> 01:17:43,948
Of course, you know it means
over $200,000 worth of free publicity

1176
01:17:44,116 --> 01:17:47,619
- for Davis and Wallace.
- Emma, that's a terrible thing to say.

1177
01:17:47,786 --> 01:17:50,413
I didn't say it. Bob Wallace said it.
I just heard him.

1178
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:54,626
No. Bob wouldn't be involved in a thing
like that. I'm sure you're wrong.

1179
01:17:54,793 --> 01:17:57,420
Well, if I am, I'll resign as president
of the New England chapter

1180
01:17:57,588 --> 01:18:01,548
of Busybodies Anonymous.
Oh, dear, my nerves. It's the phone.

1181
01:18:05,136 --> 01:18:06,678
Hi, Betty. Have you seen Bob?

1182
01:18:06,846 --> 01:18:09,056
Do you know whether he made that
phone call to New York or not, Emma?

1183
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:11,308
- I understand he did.
- Good.

1184
01:18:11,476 --> 01:18:12,851
I hear that television's
entered the picture.

1185
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:15,479
- Then he worked it out?
- Beautifully.

1186
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:18,482
- It's a great, little angle, isn't it?
- Brilliant.

1187
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,442
Listen, keep this under your hat,
will you?

1188
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,945
We wouldn't want the general
to know about it, because it's...

1189
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:24,112
I can understand that.

1190
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,242
Betty, that was Bob. He's waiting
to rehearse in the dining room.

1191
01:18:28,493 --> 01:18:31,536
- Anything wrong?
- Tell him I'm on the way.

1192
01:18:32,872 --> 01:18:34,915
- Hi, hon. How about some lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

1193
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:37,625
- But Betty...
- I said I'm not hungry.

1194
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:43,714
- What's with her?
- I'm not sure, but I have an idea.

1195
01:18:43,882 --> 01:18:44,966
I want to think about it.

1196
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:47,843
Yeah, well, let's think about it over
a sandwich, kid. I'm starving to death.

1197
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:50,012
- Change the routine...
- That other rehearsal's

1198
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,514
got me crazy. I don't know...

1199
01:18:51,682 --> 01:18:54,350
Let's set up the next number.

1200
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:09,031
Howdy. I was just going over
this Blessings number.

1201
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,702
Something we could do together.
Want to try it from the release?

1202
01:19:12,869 --> 01:19:16,371
<i>~ When my bankroll is getting small ~</i>

1203
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:19,666
<i>~ I think of when I had none at all ~</i>

1204
01:19:19,834 --> 01:19:23,545
<i>~ And I fall asleep counting my blessings ~</i>

1205
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:27,841
What's the matter? A bad key for you?

1206
01:19:28,009 --> 01:19:29,551
Look, I don't think
I'm right for this song.

1207
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:32,220
Of course you are. Lays great for you.
Come on, now, let's try it.

1208
01:19:32,388 --> 01:19:36,141
- No, I don't think I'm right for it.
- Don't be silly.

1209
01:19:36,309 --> 01:19:38,518
What I'm trying to say is
I don't feel like doing this song.

1210
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:42,272
I don't want to do this song. In fact,
I'm not sure I want to do the show.

1211
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,400
Well, what is this?
You sleep well last night or what?

1212
01:19:45,568 --> 01:19:48,361
I'd rather not discuss last night,
if you don't mind.

1213
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:51,405
Come now, I admit I was
a little carried away and everything,

1214
01:19:51,573 --> 01:19:54,241
but there's no use getting all upset
with just a simple little kiss.

1215
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:56,368
Nobody signed a contract.

1216
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:58,287
There's certainly nothing
for you to feel guilty about.

1217
01:19:58,455 --> 01:20:01,332
- Look who's talking about guilt.
- What do you mean by that?

1218
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:05,586
I mean, you shouldn't mix fairytales
with liverwurst and buttermilk.

1219
01:20:05,754 --> 01:20:08,172
- What did you have for lunch today?
- I didn't have lunch.

1220
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,423
Well, maybe you ought to eat something.

1221
01:20:09,591 --> 01:20:11,800
Why is everybody suddenly
so concerned about my eating habits?

1222
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:16,347
- Why don't people leave me alone...
- Time, time, cut!

1223
01:20:16,514 --> 01:20:19,099
Let's get off the merry-go-round.
If you got something to say, say it.

1224
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:22,686
Otherwise, let's get to work. I got
a lot of details here to take care of.

1225
01:20:22,854 --> 01:20:26,272
Well, then, let's just skip all this.
I certainly wouldn't want to interfere

1226
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,775
with the business plans
of the great Wallace and Davis.

1227
01:20:28,942 --> 01:20:32,570
- That's quite a remark.
- I'm sorry. It's the best I can do.

1228
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:35,156
Look, Betty,
I've got no time for games today.

1229
01:20:35,324 --> 01:20:37,200
Now, are you gonna
sing this song or not?

1230
01:20:37,368 --> 01:20:39,786
- I don't want to sing the song.
- Well, nobody's twisting your arm.

1231
01:20:39,953 --> 01:20:42,663
- Is that all, Mr. Wallace?
- Yes, that's all, Miss Haynes.

1232
01:20:56,136 --> 01:20:57,804
Yours ought to be done by now.

1233
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:24,037
- How do you figure that?
- I'm not sure,

1234
01:21:24,205 --> 01:21:26,331
but daylight's beginning to glimmer.

1235
01:21:26,499 --> 01:21:29,793
Last night she couldn't sleep.
Today she won't eat.

1236
01:21:29,961 --> 01:21:32,712
- She's in love.
- If that's love, somebody goofed.

1237
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,173
It's love all right, but she's
deliberately putting up barriers.

1238
01:21:35,341 --> 01:21:36,674
I'd bet my bottom dollar on it.

1239
01:21:36,842 --> 01:21:38,676
- Why?
- Because of me.

1240
01:21:38,844 --> 01:21:41,554
She's always felt that she's mother hen
and I'm her little chick.

1241
01:21:41,721 --> 01:21:44,181
She'll never leave the roost
until I'm taken care of.

1242
01:21:44,349 --> 01:21:47,518
- That's funny. Are you sure?
- I should've known.

1243
01:21:47,686 --> 01:21:50,271
She'll never get involved with anyone
until I'm married

1244
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:54,900
- or engaged or something.
- Well, I guess that's the end of that.

1245
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:59,738
Unless I get myself engaged
or something real fast.

1246
01:21:59,906 --> 01:22:01,991
That's ridiculous.
Even if it made any sense at all,

1247
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,869
you're up here in the wilderness.
There's nobody around here.

1248
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,495
I don't know.

1249
01:22:06,663 --> 01:22:10,583
Be realistic. Who could you find up here
to get yourself engaged to?

1250
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:14,002
Well, I suppose it ought
to be someone that I know.

1251
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,462
That always helps.

1252
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:18,548
- Of course, it's got to be a man.
- That's an absolute must.

1253
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:22,218
No, no, no. I mean a mature man.
One with talent and experience.

1254
01:22:22,386 --> 01:22:23,887
- Talent, experience...
- One that's witty,

1255
01:22:24,054 --> 01:22:26,389
- gay, charming, attractive.
- Witty, gay, charming, sure.

1256
01:22:26,557 --> 01:22:29,392
Where are you gonna find
such a super man?

1257
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,021
- Don't be so modest.
- Honey, fellas like that don't...

1258
01:22:35,357 --> 01:22:38,401
- Me?
- Well, you're not exactly Superman,

1259
01:22:38,569 --> 01:22:42,238
- but you're awfully available.
- Yeah, now, don't get any ideas, Judy.

1260
01:22:42,406 --> 01:22:45,533
- I'm not the marrying kind.
- It's just an engagement.

1261
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:48,494
Yeah, well,
I'm not the engaging kind, either.

1262
01:22:48,661 --> 01:22:49,912
Well, what kind are you?

1263
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:52,748
Well, I'm more the "I don't mind
pushing my best friend into it,

1264
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:56,335
but I'm scared stiff when I get
anywhere close to it myself" kind.

1265
01:22:56,503 --> 01:22:58,795
How terrible could it be for a few days?

1266
01:22:58,963 --> 01:23:02,591
- You do like me, don't you?
- Sure, I do.

1267
01:23:02,759 --> 01:23:07,054
- I mean, I'm not exactly repulsive.
- Of course not.

1268
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:12,267
And you do find me gay, amusing,
good company, fun to be with?

1269
01:23:12,435 --> 01:23:15,896
Sure, but I feel the same way
about my cocker spaniel.

1270
01:23:16,606 --> 01:23:21,235
Well, let's just skip it.
I was only thinking of Betty and Bob.

1271
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:23,736
Betty and Bob, yeah.

1272
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:27,114
Look, it would only be temporary?

1273
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,577
Well, of course. Well,
you don't think I'm the kind of girl

1274
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:34,121
that goes around throwing myself
at a man, do you?

1275
01:23:34,289 --> 01:23:38,292
Of course not. Nobody thinks that.
Well, look, let me figure this out.

1276
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:42,797
Now, it would only last two or three
weeks at the worst. At the most, I mean.

1277
01:23:42,965 --> 01:23:44,966
Well, of course.

1278
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:48,135
And we wouldn't have to
announce our engagement

1279
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:50,805
till it was absolutely necessary.

1280
01:23:50,973 --> 01:23:54,141
Absolutely necessary.

1281
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:56,602
Well, OK, it's a deal.

1282
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:04,317
But don't you think
we ought to kiss or something?

1283
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:08,697
Not until it's absolutely necessary.

1284
01:24:25,506 --> 01:24:28,258
Isn't it a wonderful party?

1285
01:24:59,581 --> 01:25:02,166
Bob, would you like to dance?

1286
01:25:02,334 --> 01:25:04,335
- I'm game if you are.
- Thank you.

1287
01:25:04,502 --> 01:25:07,546
Hey, Betty. How about some exercise?
Come on.

1288
01:25:09,924 --> 01:25:13,384
<i>~ The best things ~</i>

1289
01:25:13,552 --> 01:25:16,679
<i>~ Happen while you're dancing ~</i>

1290
01:25:16,847 --> 01:25:19,307
<i>~ Things that you would not do at home ~</i>

1291
01:25:19,475 --> 01:25:23,227
<i>~ Come naturally on the floor ~</i>

1292
01:25:24,563 --> 01:25:28,149
<i>~ - For dancing ~</i>
<i>- Pardon me.</i>

1293
01:25:28,317 --> 01:25:31,069
<i>~ Soon becomes romancing ~</i>

1294
01:25:31,236 --> 01:25:34,864
Hi. OK.

1295
01:25:39,828 --> 01:25:43,206
<i>~ Even guys with two left feet ~</i>

1296
01:25:43,374 --> 01:25:46,958
<i>~ Come out all right if the girl is sweet ~</i>

1297
01:25:47,126 --> 01:25:50,420
<i>~ If by chance their cheeks should meet ~</i>

1298
01:25:50,588 --> 01:25:52,422
<i>~ While dancing ~</i>

1299
01:25:53,424 --> 01:25:55,175
Mr. Herring, this is Miss Lennis.

1300
01:25:55,343 --> 01:25:57,636
- How do you do?
- Mutual, I'm sure.

1301
01:25:57,804 --> 01:25:59,346
- Bye.
- May I?

1302
01:26:20,368 --> 01:26:24,787
- Looks like it's absolutely necessary.
- What... You mean, I...

1303
01:26:26,623 --> 01:26:30,126
Hold it a minute, fellas.
Give me a little ching-a-ring, will you?

1304
01:26:30,293 --> 01:26:32,128
Folks, I have an announcement to make.

1305
01:26:32,295 --> 01:26:35,464
An announcement, and I want you all
to be the first to know.

1306
01:26:35,632 --> 01:26:38,134
I don't know whether the best things
happen while you're dancing

1307
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:40,970
or whether they just happen
in Vermont...

1308
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:46,809
...but Judy has just agreed to...

1309
01:26:46,977 --> 01:26:49,645
Well, I mean that she just asked me...

1310
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,940
That is, she just said...

1311
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:56,152
What I'm trying to say
is that Judy and I are engaged.

1312
01:27:01,031 --> 01:27:05,326
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1313
01:27:05,494 --> 01:27:08,705
- I sure wish it would happen to me!
- Yeah, I do, too!

1314
01:27:15,838 --> 01:27:19,174
It's just wonderful, darling.
I'm so happy for you.

1315
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:22,635
I hoped you would be.
Is everything all right?

1316
01:27:22,803 --> 01:27:25,472
Sure, sure, it's all right. I'm fine.

1317
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:28,850
You realize you're getting the best girl
in the whole wide world?

1318
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:32,437
- I... Yeah. Sure.
- You take care of her.

1319
01:27:32,605 --> 01:27:35,981
- I'd say this calls for champagne.
- I'll help you, Emma.

1320
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:41,987
- Congratulations, kids!
- Thanks, Bob.

1321
01:27:42,155 --> 01:27:44,364
I don't know what you see
in this long drink of charged water,

1322
01:27:44,532 --> 01:27:47,117
but, honestly, after you get
to know him, he's almost endurable.

1323
01:27:47,285 --> 01:27:48,994
- You're gonna settle down, buster?
- Yeah.

1324
01:27:49,162 --> 01:27:52,080
- Pipe, slippers... All the best, boy.
- Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Bob.

1325
01:27:52,248 --> 01:27:55,167
By the way, the water's fine.
Why don't you take a little plunge?

1326
01:27:55,335 --> 01:27:57,544
I don't know.
It seemed a little icy today.

1327
01:27:57,712 --> 01:28:00,923
That's today. I've a feeling
by tomorrow it'll warm up just fine.

1328
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:03,217
Well, you sold me. I'll go.

1329
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:08,680
Well, don't just stand there.
Aren't you going to kiss the bride?

1330
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:10,473
Kiss... Yes, sir.

1331
01:28:12,017 --> 01:28:13,434
Yes, sir!

1332
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:17,063
Now, that didn't hurt too much, did it?

1333
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:20,817
You know, in some ways, you're
far superior to my cocker spaniel.

1334
01:28:20,984 --> 01:28:22,777
At ease, General.

1335
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,538
- Champagne?
- Yeah, I think I will.

1336
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:36,666
Champagne?

1337
01:28:39,628 --> 01:28:42,797
Here. Let's drink to their happiness.

1338
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:45,716
To buttermilk and liverwurst

1339
01:28:45,883 --> 01:28:49,177
and getting things back
to where they were yesterday.

1340
01:29:12,243 --> 01:29:15,412
I know we always said
we'd never break up the act,

1341
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:18,206
but that wasn't really very realistic.

1342
01:29:18,374 --> 01:29:22,126
I mean, well,
we both knew that someday one of us

1343
01:29:22,294 --> 01:29:24,211
or both of us would want to be free.

1344
01:29:24,379 --> 01:29:27,214
Besides, now that I'm taken care of,

1345
01:29:27,382 --> 01:29:29,758
you don't have to feel responsible
for me anymore.

1346
01:29:29,926 --> 01:29:34,138
I mean, well, if there's anything
special you want to do,

1347
01:29:34,306 --> 01:29:37,933
you can just feel free now
to go ahead and do it.

1348
01:29:38,101 --> 01:29:42,730
Isn't that true? I say, isn't that true?

1349
01:29:44,357 --> 01:29:46,859
Betty, honey, are you asleep?

1350
01:29:51,156 --> 01:29:52,489
Good night.

1351
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,798
Thanks, General.

1352
01:30:10,966 --> 01:30:13,885
When you get back to the inn,
would you give this to Judy?

1353
01:30:14,053 --> 01:30:15,178
It explains everything.

1354
01:30:15,346 --> 01:30:18,222
I can't help feeling
this is a tactical error.

1355
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:20,683
I kept watching you and Bob last night.

1356
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:24,145
I say what you two need
is a good talking to.

1357
01:30:24,313 --> 01:30:27,649
No, General, this is a private war.
Don't do anything.

1358
01:30:28,734 --> 01:30:32,070
I promise. Good luck.

1359
01:30:36,366 --> 01:30:38,951
Sure, I know about that,
but on Christmas Eve

1360
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:41,036
we're gonna have a lot
of special trains coming in here,

1361
01:30:41,204 --> 01:30:44,206
from Boston, Philadelphia and New York.
Now, can you handle it OK?

1362
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:45,916
I'll call the traffic manager.

1363
01:30:46,084 --> 01:30:48,585
Good, but remember,
strictly off the record.

1364
01:30:48,753 --> 01:30:50,212
- Yes, Mr. Wallace.
- That's great.

1365
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:51,880
All aboard!

1366
01:30:55,677 --> 01:30:56,843
Betty!

1367
01:31:02,392 --> 01:31:03,767
What's this?
Where do you think you're going?

1368
01:31:03,935 --> 01:31:06,770
- I'm going to New York. I've got a job.
- You've got a job. Where?

1369
01:31:06,938 --> 01:31:09,563
Goodbye, Bob. Good luck. I hope
you have great success with the show.

1370
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:13,234
Betty, about yesterday,
if I said anything, I didn't mean it.

1371
01:31:13,402 --> 01:31:14,402
Goodbye.

1372
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,488
I was so busy with other things,
I must have sounded like an idiot...

1373
01:31:17,656 --> 01:31:21,075
- Goodbye.
- ...but I didn't mean... Betty.

1374
01:31:25,414 --> 01:31:28,916
Judy. Hey, Judy. John.
Come on up here.

1375
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:31,419
Let's run through the Abraham number.
Watch the tempo on the last part.

1376
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:33,587
Keep it rocking, will you, fellows?

1377
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:06,928
That's wonderful.

1378
01:33:07,096 --> 01:33:08,096
That's great, Johnny.

1379
01:33:08,263 --> 01:33:10,681
Listen, all right, kids, come on up
here. I want the boys in the back.

1380
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:15,937
Excuse me, Judy.
It's for you from Betty.

1381
01:33:16,105 --> 01:33:19,649
- She gave it to Grandpa at the station.
- At the station?

1382
01:33:39,919 --> 01:33:41,837
Phil! Phil!

1383
01:33:42,755 --> 01:33:45,632
- What's the matter?
- Phil, it's from Betty.

1384
01:33:53,391 --> 01:33:55,851
How could you be stupid enough
to try a stunt like this?

1385
01:33:56,018 --> 01:33:59,062
Phony engagements
and messing around with people's lives.

1386
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:00,397
You ought to be horse-whipped.

1387
01:34:00,565 --> 01:34:03,066
First you, and then you,
and then you again.

1388
01:34:03,234 --> 01:34:05,277
Gee whiz, Bob,
I only did it for your own good.

1389
01:34:05,444 --> 01:34:07,445
Yeah, because I'm a lonely,
miserable, unhappy man.

1390
01:34:07,613 --> 01:34:11,615
That's right, and when you're unhappy,
I'm unhappy. After all, Bob, I...

1391
01:34:11,783 --> 01:34:14,618
Oh, no. You're not gonna start again
with that life-saving bit.

1392
01:34:14,786 --> 01:34:16,495
Well, I told you,
I don't expect any gratitude.

1393
01:34:16,663 --> 01:34:17,997
I'm not even sure you saved my life.

1394
01:34:18,165 --> 01:34:19,540
Sometimes I wish
the wall had fallen on me.

1395
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:23,252
- Don't say that.
- And you, her own sister,

1396
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,920
how could you do such a thing?

1397
01:34:25,088 --> 01:34:27,840
It's always that
she's been a kind of a mother hen...

1398
01:34:28,008 --> 01:34:30,301
Yeah, we wanted the mother hen
to leave the roost,

1399
01:34:30,468 --> 01:34:32,678
so that the little chick could...

1400
01:34:32,846 --> 01:34:35,181
- Well, I guess we laid an egg.
- An egg?

1401
01:34:35,348 --> 01:34:37,433
Brother, you laid a Vermont volleyball!

1402
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:39,977
I'm going to New York
and try and square it with Betty.

1403
01:34:40,145 --> 01:34:41,604
You ought to consider yourself
plenty lucky.

1404
01:34:41,771 --> 01:34:44,606
You might have been stuck
with this weirdsmobile for life!

1405
01:34:45,608 --> 01:34:47,650
- Judy!
- Leave the kid alone.

1406
01:34:47,818 --> 01:34:49,110
You've got her confused
enough already.

1407
01:34:49,278 --> 01:34:50,695
Bob, you don't understand one thing.

1408
01:34:50,863 --> 01:34:52,655
Boy, you've mixed
things up beautifully, you have.

1409
01:34:52,823 --> 01:34:54,199
- Listen to me...
- No! You listen to me.

1410
01:34:54,366 --> 01:34:58,119
I got a job for you to do, if you think
you can get one simple thing straight.

1411
01:34:58,287 --> 01:34:59,287
- Try me.
- OK.

1412
01:34:59,455 --> 01:35:01,623
The general always listens
to the Ed Harrison Show, right?

1413
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:03,291
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be on about 9:00.

1414
01:35:03,459 --> 01:35:04,459
- 9:00.
- Tell Emma about it.

1415
01:35:04,627 --> 01:35:06,502
Maybe she can help you.
But the big thing is

1416
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:09,130
don't let the general anywhere near
that television set. You get me?

1417
01:35:09,298 --> 01:35:11,799
Don't worry, Bob. I'll keep him away
from that television set

1418
01:35:11,967 --> 01:35:13,134
if I have to break my arm.

1419
01:35:13,302 --> 01:35:16,804
Break your arm, your ankle or your neck,
but don't break anything valuable.

1420
01:35:16,972 --> 01:35:21,808
OK, Bob. You can depend on me.
Let's see, break the arm...

1421
01:35:31,486 --> 01:35:33,278
- Good evening, Mr. Wallace.
- Marcel, how are you?

1422
01:35:33,446 --> 01:35:35,239
Fine, thank you.
I have a table all ready for you, sir.

1423
01:35:35,406 --> 01:35:36,531
Good.

1424
01:35:41,663 --> 01:35:44,539
- Has Betty Haynes been on yet?
- Not yet. In a few minutes.

1425
01:35:44,707 --> 01:35:48,335
Good. I'm expecting Eddy Harrison, too.
Show him to the table.

1426
01:35:48,503 --> 01:35:50,504
- Certainly, Mr. Wallace.
- Thanks.

1427
01:36:10,023 --> 01:36:11,482
- Dick.
- Yes, honey.

1428
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:13,693
Let's not do the number
we rehearsed this afternoon.

1429
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,986
Play Blue Skies. Anything.

1430
01:36:15,153 --> 01:36:16,529
The number sounded great in rehearsal.

1431
01:36:16,697 --> 01:36:17,863
I know it did, but I just...

1432
01:36:18,031 --> 01:36:21,325
It's a wonderful number, honey.
Come on. Let's do it. Please, do it.

1433
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,230
<i>~ Love ~</i>

1434
01:36:52,398 --> 01:36:56,276
<i>~ You didn't do right by me ~</i>

1435
01:36:58,404 --> 01:37:03,241
<i>~ You planned a romance ~</i>
<i>~ That just hadn't a chance ~</i>

1436
01:37:03,409 --> 01:37:06,202
<i>~ And I'm through ~</i>

1437
01:37:07,912 --> 01:37:10,414
<i>~ Love ~</i>

1438
01:37:10,582 --> 01:37:14,793
<i>~ You didn't do right by me ~</i>

1439
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:21,050
<i>~ I'm back on the shelf ~</i>
<i>~ And I'm blaming myself ~</i>

1440
01:37:21,217 --> 01:37:23,886
<i>~ But it's you ~</i>

1441
01:37:25,347 --> 01:37:27,723
<i>~ My one love affair ~</i>

1442
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:32,061
<i>~ Didn't get anywhere from the start ~</i>

1443
01:37:34,564 --> 01:37:36,523
<i>~ To send me a Joe ~</i>

1444
01:37:36,691 --> 01:37:40,903
<i>~ Who had winter and snow in his heart ~</i>

1445
01:37:41,071 --> 01:37:43,613
<i>~ Wasn't smart ~</i>

1446
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:46,282
<i>~ Love ~</i>

1447
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:50,953
<i>~ You didn't do right by me ~</i>

1448
01:37:51,121 --> 01:37:55,458
<i>~ As they say in the song ~</i>

1449
01:37:55,626 --> 01:38:00,588
<i>~ You done me wrong ~</i>

1450
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:08,429
<i>~ My one love affair ~</i>

1451
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:11,974
<i>~ Didn't get anywhere ~</i>

1452
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:16,979
<i>~ From the start ~</i>

1453
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,649
<i>~ To send me a Joe ~</i>

1454
01:38:20,817 --> 01:38:25,070
<i>~ Who had winter and snow in his heart ~</i>

1455
01:38:25,238 --> 01:38:27,030
<i>~ Wasn't smart ~</i>

1456
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,326
<i>~ Oh, love ~</i>

1457
01:38:31,494 --> 01:38:35,622
<i>~ You didn't do right by me ~</i>

1458
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:39,918
<i>~ As they say in the song ~</i>

1459
01:38:40,086 --> 01:38:44,756
<i>~ You done me wrong ~</i>

1460
01:38:44,924 --> 01:38:49,386
<i>~ Yes, Mr. Love ~</i>

1461
01:38:49,554 --> 01:38:53,807
<i>~ You done me wrong ~</i>

1462
01:39:14,202 --> 01:39:17,204
Surprise! What brings you here?

1463
01:39:17,372 --> 01:39:19,415
I had a little business
to take care of.

1464
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:24,044
- I see.
- Some of it concerns you.

1465
01:39:24,212 --> 01:39:28,549
- Really?
- Yeah. It sort of boils down to this.

1466
01:39:28,717 --> 01:39:31,468
You didn't have to break up the act
or run out of town,

1467
01:39:31,635 --> 01:39:33,470
because Judy and Phil's engagement
was phony.

1468
01:39:33,637 --> 01:39:35,180
A phony?

1469
01:39:35,347 --> 01:39:37,891
Seems they were trying
to figure out some way

1470
01:39:38,058 --> 01:39:41,144
to get rid of any barriers
between you and the altar.

1471
01:39:41,312 --> 01:39:44,731
Seems like they thought you and I
were serious about each other.

1472
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:46,858
It just shows you
how foolish people can be.

1473
01:39:47,026 --> 01:39:48,818
Yeah.

1474
01:39:48,986 --> 01:39:51,696
Why do people have to stick their noses
in other people's business?

1475
01:39:51,864 --> 01:39:54,908
- Well, that's Phil for you, I guess.
- That's Judy for you.

1476
01:39:55,075 --> 01:39:56,910
The two of us were having
some laughs together

1477
01:39:57,077 --> 01:40:00,288
and they thought we were
in love with each other.

1478
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:02,999
- Ridiculous.
- Sure.

1479
01:40:04,084 --> 01:40:07,794
They're sorry about it now,
and Judy wants you to come back.

1480
01:40:09,255 --> 01:40:12,591
Matter of fact,
I'd like to see you come back myself.

1481
01:40:12,759 --> 01:40:14,343
- Well, I don't know...
- Betty.

1482
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:19,723
I know that knight of yours
has slipped off his charger.

1483
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:23,268
Why, I don't know,
but I'd like to do all I can

1484
01:40:23,436 --> 01:40:25,103
to get him back up there again for you.

1485
01:40:25,271 --> 01:40:28,690
- Mr. Wallace has been expecting you.
- Thank you very much.

1486
01:40:29,192 --> 01:40:32,569
- Bob, come on. It's 8:30.
- This is Ed Harrison. Miss Haynes.

1487
01:40:32,737 --> 01:40:34,112
- How do you do?
- Hi.

1488
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,615
Boy, what I went through for you,
sponsors, network,

1489
01:40:36,783 --> 01:40:38,951
but I finally got it squared away
just the way you wanted it.

1490
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:41,786
- That's swell, Ed. Listen...
- I got a cab waiting. We're late.

1491
01:40:41,954 --> 01:40:43,788
Just a second, Ed. I want to...

1492
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:46,791
Looks like I've got to scoot.
Could I see you later tonight maybe?

1493
01:40:46,959 --> 01:40:48,751
- I'm sorry, I have a date.
- What about tomorrow?

1494
01:40:48,919 --> 01:40:51,587
- No, I'll be busy all day.
- Come on, will you?

1495
01:40:51,755 --> 01:40:53,881
You'd better go.
You're keeping Mr. Harrison.

1496
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:55,675
- What will I tell Judy?
- I don't know.

1497
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,177
I have to think about it.
Goodbye, Bob.

1498
01:41:04,476 --> 01:41:07,311
Think Phil will be able to keep the
old man away from the television set?

1499
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:08,688
I have complete confidence in him.

1500
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:12,149
When it comes to conniving or
finagling, you can't beat this boy.

1501
01:41:12,985 --> 01:41:14,318
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.

1502
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:15,820
You have the right station?

1503
01:41:15,988 --> 01:41:17,571
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1504
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:21,032
Grandpa, the battery's dead on the Jeep.
It's stuck...

1505
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:25,829
I'll fix it later. I don't want
to miss the Ed Harrison Show.

1506
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:27,163
Judy.

1507
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,001
Should be a very good show tonight.

1508
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,006
- General, come quickly.
- What's this?

1509
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:39,092
It's a terrible thing. Fell down the
stairs. I tell you it's an awful thing.

1510
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,802
Mercy! Go see if you can help him.

1511
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,847
What is it? What is it?
Did you fall down the stairs?

1512
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:45,682
- Yes, sir.
- Are you hurt?

1513
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,312
I'm all right, sir. Probably just
a small compound fracture, sir.

1514
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:54,148
- There we are. How does it feel?
- It feels pretty good, sir.

1515
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:58,277
- Put your weight on it.
- My weight. Right here, sir.

1516
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:04,825
- Susan, call a doctor.
- Please don't do that, sir.

1517
01:42:04,993 --> 01:42:08,037
It's probably just a small
internal muscular hemorrhage, sir.

1518
01:42:08,204 --> 01:42:09,246
It'll be all right.

1519
01:42:09,414 --> 01:42:11,790
You'll feel better if we take you
where you can be comfortable.

1520
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:13,876
- Yes, sir.
- Let's just go back in here

1521
01:42:14,044 --> 01:42:16,462
and you can watch the television.

1522
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:19,590
- Sir.
- I'm going to call a doctor.

1523
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:24,094
Please, sir, don't bother. If you'll
just help me back to the bungalow,

1524
01:42:24,262 --> 01:42:26,847
- I'm sure I'll be all right, sir.
- OK.

1525
01:42:27,015 --> 01:42:31,267
Thank you, sir. I wouldn't want
to faint in front of the women, sir.

1526
01:42:35,648 --> 01:42:36,898
I'll be all right!

1527
01:42:37,066 --> 01:42:40,151
- Don't put your weight on it.
- No, no, no, sir.

1528
01:42:42,404 --> 01:42:44,197
Fine, sir.

1529
01:42:46,075 --> 01:42:47,158
Thank you. Thank you.

1530
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:50,536
And now it's a great privilege
to present my special guest,

1531
01:42:50,704 --> 01:42:52,580
an old pal from Army days,

1532
01:42:52,748 --> 01:42:56,292
a great guy and a great entertainer,
Bob Wallace!

1533
01:43:02,508 --> 01:43:04,925
Bob's got a special message tonight
for all you guys

1534
01:43:05,093 --> 01:43:07,928
who were a part of the 151st Division.

1535
01:43:08,096 --> 01:43:10,430
It's about someone
who's very close to all of us,

1536
01:43:10,598 --> 01:43:12,933
and he's gonna tell you about it
in his own special way.

1537
01:43:13,101 --> 01:43:15,310
- Bob?
- Thanks, Eddy.

1538
01:43:16,729 --> 01:43:21,274
<i>~ When the war was over ~</i>
<i>~ Why, there were jobs galore ~</i>

1539
01:43:21,442 --> 01:43:25,862
<i>~ For the GI Josephs ~</i>
<i>~ Who were in the war ~</i>

1540
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:30,117
<i>~ But for generals ~</i>
<i>~ Things were not so grand ~</i>

1541
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:36,248
<i>~ And it's not so hard to understand ~</i>

1542
01:43:37,959 --> 01:43:40,544
<i>~ What can you do with a general ~</i>

1543
01:43:40,711 --> 01:43:43,295
<i>~ When he stops being a general? ~</i>

1544
01:43:43,463 --> 01:43:48,634
<i>~ Oh, what can you do ~</i>
<i>~ With a general who retires? ~</i>

1545
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:52,304
<i>~ Who's got a job for a general ~</i>

1546
01:43:52,472 --> 01:43:54,974
<i>~ When he stops being a general? ~</i>

1547
01:43:55,142 --> 01:43:59,812
<i>~ They all get a job ~</i>
<i>~ But a general no one hires ~</i>

1548
01:44:01,022 --> 01:44:03,232
<i>~ They fill his chest with medals ~</i>

1549
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,985
<i>~ While he's across the foam ~</i>

1550
01:44:06,153 --> 01:44:08,487
<i>~ And they spread the crimson carpet ~</i>

1551
01:44:08,655 --> 01:44:11,282
<i>~ When he comes marching home ~</i>

1552
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:16,287
<i>~ The next day someone hollers ~</i>
<i>~ When he comes into view ~</i>

1553
01:44:16,454 --> 01:44:18,830
<i>~ "Here comes the general" ~</i>

1554
01:44:18,998 --> 01:44:22,333
<i>~ And they all say, "General who?" ~</i>

1555
01:44:22,501 --> 01:44:25,587
<i>~ They're delighted that he came ~</i>

1556
01:44:25,755 --> 01:44:29,132
<i>~ But they can't recall his name ~</i>

1557
01:44:30,092 --> 01:44:32,510
<i>~ Nobody thinks of assigning him ~</i>

1558
01:44:32,678 --> 01:44:35,805
<i>~ When they stop wining and dining him ~</i>

1559
01:44:35,973 --> 01:44:40,852
<i>~ It seems this country never has enjoyed ~</i>

1560
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:45,565
<i>~ So many one and two and three ~</i>

1561
01:44:45,733 --> 01:44:51,321
<i>~ And four-star generals unemployed ~</i>

1562
01:44:55,533 --> 01:44:59,620
Like Eddy told you,
that song is for the 151st Division.

1563
01:44:59,788 --> 01:45:01,872
The officers and the men
under the command

1564
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:06,043
of Major General Tom Waverly.
I hope a lot of you guys were listening,

1565
01:45:06,211 --> 01:45:09,004
because I have something
I want you to do for me.

1566
01:45:09,339 --> 01:45:10,547
Don't you want to sit down?

1567
01:45:10,715 --> 01:45:13,383
No, no, sir. If you'll just walk me
around the barn a few times,

1568
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:16,512
I think it'll be fine, sir. Yes.

1569
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:20,641
It's a little too fast, sir.
If we just slow down a little bit, sir.

1570
01:45:21,559 --> 01:45:25,604
I know it's murder asking you to
leave your homes on Christmas Eve,

1571
01:45:25,772 --> 01:45:27,731
and certainly
a trip like this is no bargain.

1572
01:45:27,899 --> 01:45:28,981
It shouldn't be too tough

1573
01:45:29,149 --> 01:45:31,317
for the fellows who live in the
New England area, but remember this,

1574
01:45:31,485 --> 01:45:34,070
nobody connected with the show
is getting anything out of it,

1575
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:36,739
nothing at all.
Except what we're offering you,

1576
01:45:36,907 --> 01:45:40,493
a chance to give the nicest
Christmas gift he'll ever get

1577
01:45:40,661 --> 01:45:42,620
to the nicest guy we'll ever know.

1578
01:45:42,788 --> 01:45:46,082
Remember, then,
your objective is Pine Tree, Vermont.

1579
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:49,252
Synchronize your watches then
for Operation Waverly.

1580
01:46:21,033 --> 01:46:22,742
Hey, listen, men,
when I give you the signal,

1581
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:26,121
I want you to fall in single file
on each side of the stage.

1582
01:46:26,289 --> 01:46:27,539
And I want you to fall in at attention

1583
01:46:27,707 --> 01:46:30,709
like that day at Montecatini when
Clark came through. You remember?

1584
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:35,338
It was a big day for you. You got a lot
of that stuff hung on you. Remember?

1585
01:46:35,506 --> 01:46:38,341
I'm gonna have you face the general.
When I give you the command to march,

1586
01:46:38,509 --> 01:46:40,634
I want you to step right out,
just like you used to.

1587
01:46:40,802 --> 01:46:42,887
- All right, Captain.
- OK, boys.

1588
01:46:43,054 --> 01:46:47,474
- Captain, these things have shrunk.
- Your appetite hasn't shrunk.

1589
01:46:47,642 --> 01:46:49,101
Who's there?

1590
01:46:54,065 --> 01:46:55,733
They're sure gone.

1591
01:46:56,318 --> 01:46:58,485
How could you have sent
all my suits to the cleaners?

1592
01:46:58,653 --> 01:46:59,945
You've only got two.

1593
01:47:00,113 --> 01:47:02,948
Well, I think you'd send
one at a time then, in that case.

1594
01:47:03,116 --> 01:47:05,659
- Why can't you wear your uniform?
- Yes!

1595
01:47:05,827 --> 01:47:07,286
I won't appear in uniform.

1596
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:09,955
- Please, Gramps.
- Absolutely not.

1597
01:47:10,123 --> 01:47:11,665
Very well, I'll explain to Bob and Phil

1598
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:14,335
that you didn't care to
come to the show tonight.

1599
01:47:14,502 --> 01:47:18,338
- I'll have you court-martialed.
- Susan. You're not obliged to go.

1600
01:47:18,505 --> 01:47:20,006
They haven't done much for you,
hardly anything.

1601
01:47:20,174 --> 01:47:22,133
Emma, I'll make my own decisions.

1602
01:47:22,301 --> 01:47:24,177
I got along very well in the Army
without you.

1603
01:47:24,345 --> 01:47:27,138
It took 15,000 men to take my place.

1604
01:47:27,306 --> 01:47:30,516
- Susan.
- Fifteen thousand men.

1605
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:37,899
I hope he comes down.
That'd be awful if he wouldn't.

1606
01:47:38,067 --> 01:47:39,442
It's Betty!

1607
01:47:40,861 --> 01:47:43,154
- Welcome home, Betty!
- Hello, Emma.

1608
01:47:43,364 --> 01:47:44,447
How are you?

1609
01:47:44,615 --> 01:47:45,615
- Hi, Susie.
- Hi, Betty.

1610
01:47:45,783 --> 01:47:47,617
- Where's Judy?
- She's coming.

1611
01:47:47,785 --> 01:47:52,079
- Honey. I'm so glad you came.
- Hello, Judy.

1612
01:47:52,246 --> 01:47:54,665
You didn't say anything to Bob, did you?

1613
01:47:54,832 --> 01:47:56,917
Hurry up now.
You haven't got much time to get ready.

1614
01:47:57,085 --> 01:48:01,046
If I weren't such a mean old biddy,
I'd break right down and cry.

1615
01:48:13,309 --> 01:48:14,559
Grandpa!

1616
01:48:16,354 --> 01:48:18,105
You look wonderful.

1617
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:21,817
You didn't expect me to
come down in my bathrobe, did you?

1618
01:48:21,985 --> 01:48:23,026
No.

1619
01:48:39,251 --> 01:48:40,626
Ten-hut!

1620
01:49:29,091 --> 01:49:32,844
<i>~ We'll follow the old man ~</i>

1621
01:49:33,012 --> 01:49:36,639

<i>~ Opposite to the foe ~</i>

1622
01:49:36,807 --> 01:49:40,601

<i>~ Wherever he wants to stay ~</i>

1623
01:49:40,769 --> 01:49:44,104

<i>~ From the battle's fray ~</i>

1624
01:49:44,272 --> 01:49:48,650
<i>~ Because we love him ~</i>
<i>~ We love him ~</i>

1625
01:49:48,818 --> 01:49:52,237
<i>~ Especially when he keeps us on the ball ~</i>

1626
01:49:52,405 --> 01:49:56,283
<i>~ And we'll tell the kiddies ~</i>
<i>~ We answered duty's call ~</i>

1627
01:49:56,451 --> 01:50:00,162

1629
01:50:04,959 --> 01:50:08,253

<i>~ Of them all ~</i>

1632
01:50:19,598 --> 01:50:21,557
Troops are ready for inspection, sir!

1633
01:50:23,185 --> 01:50:24,852
Just routine, sir.

1634
01:50:39,493 --> 01:50:43,329
I am not satisfied
with the conduct of this division.

1635
01:50:43,497 --> 01:50:45,039
Some of you men
are under the impression

1636
01:50:45,207 --> 01:50:47,750
having been a non-CO
entitles you not to wear neckties.

1637
01:50:47,918 --> 01:50:51,503
Well, you're wrong.
Neckties will be worn in this area.

1638
01:50:51,671 --> 01:50:55,465
And look at the rest of your appearance.
You're a disgrace to the outfit.

1639
01:50:55,633 --> 01:50:58,635
You're soft. You're sloppy.

1640
01:50:58,803 --> 01:51:01,221
You're unruly. You're undisciplined.

1641
01:51:03,891 --> 01:51:07,644
And I never saw anything
look so wonderful in my whole life.

1642
01:51:08,604 --> 01:51:10,147
Thank you all.

1643
01:51:26,538 --> 01:51:28,414
- Thanks, Phil.
- General.

1644
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:32,793
- I'm grateful, Captain.
- You're welcome.

1645
01:51:35,589 --> 01:51:37,131
Ten-hut!

1646
01:52:24,803 --> 01:52:28,264
<i>~ When I was mustered out ~</i>

1647
01:52:28,432 --> 01:52:31,392

<i>~ With all my care and strife ~</i>

1648

1649
01:52:35,731 --> 01:52:39,107

1650
01:52:39,275 --> 01:52:42,653
<i>~ Gee, I wish I was back in the Army ~</i>

1651
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:46,323
<i>~ The Army wasn't really bad at all ~</i>

1652
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:49,868
<i>~ Three meals a day, free ~</i>
<i>~ For which you didn't pay ~</i>

1653
01:52:50,036 --> 01:52:53,580
<i>~ Uniforms for winter, spring and fall ~</i>

1654
01:52:53,748 --> 01:52:57,084
<i>~ There's a lot to be said for the Army ~</i>

1655
01:52:57,252 --> 01:53:00,629
<i>~ The life without responsibility ~</i>

1656
01:53:00,797 --> 01:53:04,174
<i>~ A soldier out of luck ~</i>
<i>~ Was really never stuck ~</i>

1657
01:53:04,342 --> 01:53:07,302
<i>~ There's always someone higher up ~</i>

1658

1659

<i>~ Gee, I wish I was back in the Army ~</i>

1660
01:53:23,986 --> 01:53:27,530
<i>~ The Army was the place to find romance ~</i>

1661
01:53:27,698 --> 01:53:30,950
<i>~ Soldiers and WACs ~</i>
<i>~ The WACs who dressed in slacks ~</i>

1662
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:34,578
<i>~ Dancing cheek to cheek ~</i>
<i>~ And pants to pants ~</i>

1663
01:53:34,746 --> 01:53:38,082
<i>~ There's a lot to be said for the Army ~</i>

1664
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:41,294
<i>~ A gal was never lost for company ~</i>

1665
01:53:41,461 --> 01:53:45,047
<i>~ A million handsome guys ~</i>
<i>~ With longing in their eyes ~</i>

1666
01:53:45,215 --> 01:53:48,134
<i>~ And all you had to do was pick the age ~</i>
<i>~ The weight, the size ~</i>

1667
01:53:48,302 --> 01:53:52,220
<i>~ Oh, gee, I wish I was back in the Army ~</i>

1668
01:53:59,854 --> 01:54:03,231

1669
01:54:03,399 --> 01:54:06,901
<i>~ The shows we got, civilians couldn't see ~</i>

1670
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:10,572
<i>~ How we would yell ~</i>
<i>~ For Dietrich and Cornell ~</i>

1671
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:13,742

1674
01:54:21,584 --> 01:54:24,794

1675
01:54:24,962 --> 01:54:28,255

Come on, Phil.

1686
01:55:45,415 --> 01:55:46,998
- Lookit here!
- Isn't this great?

1687
01:55:47,166 --> 01:55:50,085

Hey! Merry Christmas!

01:55:57,218 --> 01:55:59,344
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1692
01:56:03,015 --> 01:56:05,851
Remember, kids, hold those candles up
good and high for me, aren't you?

1693
01:56:06,018 --> 01:56:07,185
Keep a nice straight line
when you go out there.

1694
01:56:07,353 --> 01:56:08,478
Don't go straggling all over the stage.

1695
01:56:08,646 --> 01:56:11,106
- How's your voice, Bobby?
- I'm Bobby.

1696
01:56:11,274 --> 01:56:13,482
Pardon me. Well, how's your voice?
You all right?

1697
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:15,359
Give me a nice clear tone.
Let me hear it.

1698
01:56:17,028 --> 01:56:18,028
Those were the days.

1699
01:56:18,196 --> 01:56:20,197
OK, now, turn around.
We're gonna go on in a minute.

1700
01:56:20,365 --> 01:56:25,161
Watch your space. Don't get far apart.
Everybody the same distance. That's it.

1701
01:56:25,328 --> 01:56:28,164
Keep the candles up.
Keep them way up high.

1702
01:56:28,415 --> 01:56:29,748
OK, Byron.
