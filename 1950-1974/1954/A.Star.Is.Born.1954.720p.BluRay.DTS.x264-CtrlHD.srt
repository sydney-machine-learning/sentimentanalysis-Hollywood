1
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,300
This is a great
night in Hollywood, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,010
I might even say
a fabulous Hollywood night.

3
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,260
This is the Shrine Auditorium's
great evening...

4
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,310
...for the Motion Picture Relief Fund...

5
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,100
...the benefit show called
Night of the Stars, for Hollywood's own.

6
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,980
The motion-picture stars
never forget their own.

7
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,070
And tonight, all the proceeds will go
to the Motion Picture Relief Fund.

8
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,670
Wait a minute, folks. I think l see--

9
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,090
Yes, it is, it is.

10
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,510
Oliver Niles' car is just driving up.

11
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,850
And waving to her fans is Lola Lavery.

12
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,070
Lola, nice to see you. So wonderful.
Oliver Niles, the famous producer.

13
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,580
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present lovely Lola Lavery.

14
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you, George, sweetie.
It's so divine being here tonight.

15
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,960
And l know you're all looking forward
to seeing your favorite star and mine.

16
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,460
And, of course, you know,
Norman Maine is the great attraction...

17
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,050
...here at the Shrine Auditorium tonight.

18
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,050
And of course,
wherever Norman Maine goes...

19
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,930
...lovely little Lola is sure to be there.

20
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,980
-Joan, doesn't she look beautiful?
-She looks gorgeous.

21
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,480
-Good to see you.
-How are you? Isn't she adorable?

22
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,770
You're looking divine.
What are you wearing?

23
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,070
She's wearing a black sheath.
Isn't it divine?

24
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,150
And a white fox.
And the diamonds in the hair.

25
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,450
Did you ever? It's adorable.

26
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,120
Joan!

27
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,790
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had the pleasure...

28
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,290
...of having lovely Lola Lavery
at our microphones.

29
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,790
Did you ever see anyone so sweet,
so unspoiled and down-to-earth?

30
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,590
-She's a darling girl.
-Definitely.

31
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,380
Lola, please, just one shot.

32
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,800
Thank you.

33
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,130
-Hello, Lola.
-Libby, darling.

34
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,970
-Norman's not here. Not a sign.
-Didn't you call for him?

35
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,970
-That was the plan.
-Wasn't there. l've been all over town...

36
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,100
...the usual places.
Not a sign of him.

37
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,150
Libby, Normie loves being late.
He's always late with me.

38
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,900
You're not exactly a public performance,
my dear.

39
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,820
-You know where l'm sitting.
-l'll check backstage.

40
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,200
- He's here.
- Good.

41
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,290
He's drunk.

42
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,540
-How bad?
-Very. What do you want me to do?

43
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,210
Keep him off.

44
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,210
-Don't let him go on.
-ls anything wrong? ls Normie all right?

45
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,970
It's all right.

46
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,520
Norman Maine.

47
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
Probably drunk.

48
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,330
Let go, you're breaking my camera.

49
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,850
Norman.

50
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,510
Norman, we have our cue.

51
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,020
- Take it easy. Please.
- What? Oh, yes.

52
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,940
Where are you going, Norman?

53
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,230
Hey, grab him. Grab him quick.

54
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,280
A horse!

55
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,780
A horse for my kingdom.

56
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,990
- Hey!
- Get him here. Get him here.

57
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,250
Get him off the stage.

58
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,590
What are we gonna do, Libby?

59
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,800
-What's the act that follows Maine?
-The Glenn Williams' Orchestra.

60
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,010
-They here?
-Yes.

61
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,970
-Ready? All right.
-Yes.

62
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,980
On the stand, we're on next.
Will you help rush them up, please?

63
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,860
In your places, we're on next. Snap it up.

64
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,070
Who didn't show?

65
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,990
Regular opening, verse and chorus?

66
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,740
Yeah, that's right.

67
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,990
Get a load of Norman Maine, will you?

68
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,200
-Where?
-Look.

69
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,170
Mr. Maine is feeling no pain.

70
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,670
Oh, how I hate benefits.

71
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,510
Better make it snappy, Esther.
Neil, is all the music out?

72
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,090
I'll get it now.

73
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,680
Hi, Norman.

74
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,770
Hello, Matt, old boy.

75
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,560
We seem to have missed each other.
Been searching for me?

76
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,560
That's all right. I knew you'd turn up.

77
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,860
Touching, your faith in me, Matt.
Touching.

78
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,150
Mr. Libby looks after me like a fond mother
with a good sense of...

79
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,780
...double-entry bookkeeping.

80
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,030
Mr. Libby, I should explain,
is in charge...

81
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,660
...of the public relations at the studio.
How is the AP and the UP--

82
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,830
Fine, fine.
Norman, I got some of the boys--

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,670
How many lies have you told
the public today?

84
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,710
A couple of hundred.
I need you for an interview and pictures.

85
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,550
I don't need more pictures,
I don't need more interviews...

86
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,880
-...because the public loves me.
-Sure they do.

87
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,140
-But just a few. l promised the boys.
-Take your hands off me.

88
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,730
And don't make any promises for me
for l will break them. A horse!

89
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,190
My kingdom for a horse.

90
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,690
-l'll tell you what, Libby.
-What?

91
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,030
I'm thirsty. I need a drink before I go on.

92
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,610
If you get me a drink,
I'll let you take a picture.

93
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,870
-That's a deal.
-Two drinks, two pictures.

94
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,700
Three drinks, three pictures.

95
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,370
Three pictures.

96
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,160
You're not a bad fellow, Libby.

97
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,830
Why do you disgust me?
Why do l hate you so, Libby?

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,380
I wouldn't know about that, Norman.

99
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,940
- Just one more.
- Smile.

100
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,270
- Let's have another one.
- That does it.

101
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,310
- Give us more.
- l said, that does it.

102
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,780
But you've got plenty of time.
All right, all right, no more pictures.

103
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,490
Get your pencils out, boys.

104
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm sorry, gentlemen, no time.

105
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,950
-You got plenty of time.
-Come on.

106
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
-Plenty of time.
-Are you trying to stop me?

107
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,950
You trying to stop me from going on?

108
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
-ls that it?
-No.

109
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,790
- What a story this will make.
- This guy is stoned.

110
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,910
What a spot this
Not so hot this

111
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,040
Hey, there, shy one
Come be my one

112
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,000
Please don't rush off
Want no brush-off

113
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,510
I can't compel you to buy
What I'd sell you

114
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,510
But l'd like to tell you
Like so

115
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,560
You wanna have bells that'll ring

116
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,400
You wanna have songs that'll sing

117
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,360
You want your sky of baby blue

118
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,400
You gotta have me go with you

119
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,910
Hey, you fool, you
Why so cool, you?

120
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,530
When I'm ready
To go steady

121
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,830
You wanna have eyes that'll shine

122
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,660
You wanna have grapes on the vine

123
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,670
You want a love that's truly true

124
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,710
-You gotta have me go with you
-You gotta have me

125
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,380
-Why the hold out?
-And me

126
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,050
Have you sold out?

127
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,340
Time you woke up

128
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,430
Time you spoke up

129
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,930
This line I'm handing you

130
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,180
Is not a handout

131
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,730
As a team, we'd be a standout
Ba-dop

132
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,980
You wanna live high on a dime

133
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,320
You wanna have two hearts in rhyme

134
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,110
-Gotta have me go with you
-Don't forget about baby

135
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,910
-You gotta have me
-Gotta have me

136
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,070
Gotta have me

137
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,370
All the time

138
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,370
-Ba-ba-bah
-Ba-ba-bah

139
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,920
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba

140
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,340
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bah

141
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,430
Bah

142
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,350
Ooh-ah
Boo-de-boo

143
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,600
Why the hold out?

144
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,770
Have you sold out?

145
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,940
Time you woke up

146
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,060
Time you spoke up

147
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,670
Want your sky of baby blue

148
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,960
You gotta have me go with you

149
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,800
Why the hold out?

150
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,890
Have you sold out?

151
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,140
Time you woke up

152
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,020
Time you spoke up

153
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,640
This line I'm handing you

154
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,980
Is not a handout

155
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,440
As a team, we'd be a standout

156
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,650
You wanna live high on a dime

157
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,940
You wanna have two hearts in rhyme

158
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,660
Gotta have me go with you

159
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,830
All the time

160
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,270
- Esther?
- Yes.

161
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,190
Hi, girls.

162
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,190
- Esther, if you hurry we can have coffee.
- All right.

163
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,820
-Good night.
-Goodbye.

164
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,530
-Danny.
-Yeah?

165
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,910
-Wait-- Here, wait just a second.
-Okay.

166
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,700
I think I must've chewed
my lips off wondering...

167
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,710
...if he was gonna come
staggering back.

168
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,380
I've never been so frightened.
My knees were shaking--

169
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,040
-Was l on key? I couldn't hear.
-On pitch all the way.

170
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,210
It's a wonder.

171
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,550
And it's a wonder to me
Mr. Norman Maine is still in pictures.

172
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,010
It is indeed.

173
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,020
In fact, l ask it myself every morning
when l'm shaving.

174
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,230
I say, "Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the greatest star of them all?"

175
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,820
Do you know what the mirror answers?

176
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,400
Norman Maine?

177
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,660
Absolutely correct, Miss....

178
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,160
Blodgett. Esther Blodgett.

179
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,660
You must've been born with that name.
Couldn't have made it up.

180
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,420
-l was born with it.
-Excuse me.

181
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,630
You wouldn't make up a name like that,
would you?

182
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,050
-Oh, it's a brand-new lipstick.
-To mark the occasion when...

183
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,140
...Esther Blodgett...

184
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,600
...saved Norman Maine...

185
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,610
...from making even more
of a fool of himself than usual.

186
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,110
I thank you.

187
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,610
My studio thanks you.
All the legions and codes...

188
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,410
...that watch over our industry
will be equally pleased, I'm sure.

189
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,700
-Would you take supper with me?
-Oh, I--

190
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,700
And all the people with you too.

191
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm afraid we can't, Mr. Maine.
You see, we're working at the Grove.

192
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,790
-This is Danny McGuire, our pianist.
-Oh, bring your piano along, Mr. McGuire.

193
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,050
Nobody can object to a good,
clean-living American piano.

194
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,800
But l insist on your taking supper
with me.

195
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,130
Come on.

196
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,850
Don't you try to stop me, Mr. McGuire.
I know myself extremely well.

197
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,060
I'm just near the fighting stage
at the moment.

198
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,610
If l don't get my way, l'll begin to break up
people and things at this moment.

199
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,070
-You understand, don't you?
-Yes, I understand.

200
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Why don't we have supper
sometime later?

201
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,200
Maybe tomorrow or the next night.
I'll tell you what l'll do.

202
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,500
I'll lay in a whole supply of lipsticks
and we'll celebrate all over the walls.

203
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,290
-Please, Miss Blodgett.
-Good night.

204
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,090
I think I see your friends, Mr. Maine.
Let's hit the road.

205
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,670
-Oh!
-Pumpkin, you were divine. Simply divine.

206
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
-Wonderful, Normie.
-You were swell.

207
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,970
Everyone around me was saying it.

208
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,100
You know, drunk or not, he's nice.

209
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,390
-He's awful nice.
-Just darling. Come on.

210
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,740
When he goes off like that,
he's good for the night, Mr. Libby.

211
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,540
He'll smile in his sleep in a minute.

212
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,210
Like a child.

213
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,460
Like a child with a blowtorch.

214
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,090
What, sir?

215
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,720
Nothing.

216
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,390
Mr. Maine's charm escapes me.

217
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,890
It always has.

218
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,890
Now, you understand, 6:00 sharp.
Have him dressed and ready.

219
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,890
Yes. Yes, sir.

220
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,440
Here are his car keys.
Hide them, will you?

221
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,230
I've had enough of Mr. Maine
for one night.

222
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,910
He's good for the night.

223
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,370
Six o'clock sharp.

224
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,710
He'll sure be surprised when he finds
himself on location in the morning.

225
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,810
-Good evening, Mr. Maine.
-Hello, Bruno. How are you?

226
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,730
-All right.
-There's a little dark girl...

227
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,980
...sings with
the Glenn Williams' Orchestra.

228
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,150
The Glenn Williams' Orchestra
finishes at 1 :30, Mr. Maine.

229
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,740
Then the rumba band takes over.
They finished about an hour ago.

230
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,200
Well, it doesn't matter, Bruno.
The whole thing seems rather silly now.

231
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,200
I'll tell you something, Mr. Maine.

232
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,670
All the bands that play here,
the musicians, you know...

233
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,670
...they go to a little place
on Sunset Boulevard after they finish.

234
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,630
And maybe the girl could be there.
They're crazy people, you know.

235
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,630
They blow their heads off here all night.

236
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,220
And instead of going to bed,
they go to this place...

237
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,520
...and blow their heads off there
for themselves for nothing.

238
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,020
Would you like a table, sir?

239
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,480
Not unless you wish
to rumba with me, Bruno.

240
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,020
Is there anyone here that l know?

241
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,770
Well, now, let's see.

242
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,280
There's a new little girl from Paramount.

243
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,660
That one there, yes.

244
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,910
She's very pretty, Mr. Maine.

245
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,620
She's with someone, isn't she?

246
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,580
Only her agent.

247
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,090
He'll be glad to leave.

248
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,300
Too young.
I had a very young week last week.

249
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,390
She's not worth it.

250
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,550
Is there anyone else?

251
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,270
I, uh....

252
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,600
Miss Sheldon.

253
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,650
She's very beautiful tonight, Mr. Maine.

254
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,980
No. She hit me over the head
with a bottle.

255
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,110
Yes, yes. l remember it.
Happened right here.

256
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,820
-l thought everything was all right by now.
-Nope, they only hit me once.

257
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,080
Little girl in the green dress.

258
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,080
No, Mr. Maine.

259
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,750
Pasadena.

260
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Leave it alone.

261
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,420
Will you excuse me, please?
I'll be right back.

262
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,340
Go ahead.

263
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,530
Take it, honey. Come on.

264
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,410
Take it from the top.

265
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,410
- From the top?
- Yeah.

266
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,550
Doo, doo-dee-dee

267
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,930
Uh-huh-huh

268
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
The night is bitter

269
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,310
The stars have lost their glitter

270
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,730
The winds grow colder

271
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,150
Suddenly, you're older

272
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,780
And all because of the man

273
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,870
That got away

274
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,290
No more his eager call

275
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,550
The writing's on the wall

276
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,550
The dreams you've dreamed have all

277
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,770
Gone astray

278
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,310
The man that won you

279
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,730
Has run off and undone you

280
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,030
That great beginning

281
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,030
Has seen a final inning

282
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,740
Don't know what happened

283
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:46,080
It's all a crazy game

284
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:52,550
No more that all-time thrill

285
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,930
For you've been through the mill

286
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,940
And never a new love will

287
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,070
Be the same

288
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,780
Good riddance, goodbye

289
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,740
Every trick of his

290
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,040
You're on to

291
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,920
But fools will be fools

292
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:36,800
And where's he gone to?

293
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,810
The road gets rougher

294
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,680
It's lonelier and tougher

295
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,940
With hope you burn up

296
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,480
Tomorrow he will turn up

297
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,150
There's just no letup

298
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,320
The livelong night and day

299
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:05,660
Ever since this world began

300
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,750
There is nothing sadder than

301
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,720
A one-man woman looking for

302
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,890
The man that got away

303
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:33,980
The man that got

304
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:41,160
Away

305
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,470
- Wonderful.
- That's great.

306
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,720
Pretty good, we finished together--

307
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,970
Oh, no. No.

308
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,520
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

309
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,480
Your dancing partner has returned.

310
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,320
How do you suppose
he ever found us here?

311
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,120
-l'll get rid of him.
-No, I'll do it.

312
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,210
Hello, Mr. Maine.

313
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,040
You turn up in the strangest places.

314
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,040
Don't l, though?

315
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,920
And you're cold sober.

316
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,010
Well, you'd better make the most of it.
Sit down for a moment.

317
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,390
Do you always sing like that?

318
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,510
-Like what?
-The way you sang just now.

319
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,680
Why?

320
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,600
I never heard anybody sing
just the way you do.

321
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,440
What do you mean? Good or bad?

322
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,440
Yeah.

323
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,950
You ever go fishing?

324
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,330
Well, do you like prize--?
Ever watched a great fighter?

325
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,800
-l....
-l'm trying to tell you how you sing.

326
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,300
Do you mean like a prizefighter
or a fish?

327
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,180
Look.

328
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,550
Here.

329
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,430
There are certain pleasures
that you get....

330
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,860
There are certain pleasures you get,
little jabs of pleasure.

331
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,660
When a swordfish takes the hook,
or when you watch a great fighter...

332
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,240
...getting ready for the kill, see?

333
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,790
You don't understand
a word l'm saying, do you?

334
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,370
No, not yet.
Why don't you try bullfights?

335
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,670
You're joking,
but that's exactly what l mean.

336
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,880
If you'd never seen a bullfight,
you'd know a great bullfighter...

337
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,880
...the moment he stepped in the ring
from the way he stood...

338
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,340
...from the way he moved.

339
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,680
Or a dancer.
You don't have to know about ballet.

340
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,550
That little bell rings inside your head...

341
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,980
...that little jolt of pleasure.

342
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,810
Well, that's what happened to me
just now.

343
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,150
You're a great singer.

344
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,480
Who, me?

345
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,320
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?

346
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,360
No, Mr. Maine,
no one's ever told me that before.

347
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,580
Maybe you're not quite as sober
as we both thought you were...

348
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,780
...but thank you.

349
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,370
I'm as sober as a judge
and l know exactly what I'm saying.

350
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,920
You've got that little something extra
that Ellen Terry talked about.

351
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,050
Ellen Terry, great actress
long before you were born.

352
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,470
She said that's what star quality was,
that little something extra.

353
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,720
Well, you've got it.

354
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,020
Now, what are you doing wasting
your time singing with this band?

355
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,980
Wasting my time?

356
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,980
I'm not wasting my time.

357
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,230
You don't know how many years
it's taken me to get this far.

358
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,490
-l'm doing fine, Mr. Maine. Just great.
-You're wasting your time.

359
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,240
Now, tell me about yourself.
Where'd you come from?

360
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,200
-How did you start singing?
-Oh, I--

361
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,410
- Have you got a family? You married?
- Esther.

362
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,990
- No.
- Esther.

363
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,540
We're breaking it up.

364
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,920
-Why, hello, Mr. McGuire.
-Mr. Maine.

365
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,090
Ready to go home?

366
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,380
-Yes.
-Good.

367
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,880
-l'll see that Esther gets home.
-Oh, you're k--

368
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,420
-All right, Esther?
-Yes.

369
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,720
In you go.

370
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,550
I'll see you at the bus
in the morning, Danny.

371
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,140
Yeah, at 6:00.

372
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,970
Okay.

373
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,520
-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

374
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,270
Yeah.

375
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,990
Well, go on. Go ahead.

376
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,990
Do you know the only thing
I can think of right now?

377
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,240
The only thought that comes into
my mind is the way I wash my hair.

378
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,460
You see, when anything happens to me,
good or bad...

379
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,630
...l make straight for the shampoo bottle.

380
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,800
Why would l have to think of that now?

381
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,050
I understand that perfectly.
With me, it's golf balls.

382
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,640
If l'm happy or if I'm miserable,
I putt golf balls around the living room.

383
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,640
It makes perfect sense. Go ahead.

384
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,640
I'm afraid I'm no good
at talking about myself, Mr. Maine.

385
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,650
Everything just runs together.

386
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,360
Runs together? How?

387
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,150
All over the place.

388
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,240
Washing out my gloves
in crummy hotel rooms...

389
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,280
...and winning a contest on the radio,
singing in joints.

390
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,160
You see how my mind works?
It's all jumbled.

391
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,490
I can sort it out.

392
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,460
Can you?

393
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,370
I can't.

394
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,630
I can remember my first job
singing with the band.

395
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,470
And then, one-night stands
clear across country by bus.

396
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,180
Putting on nail polish in the ladies'
rooms of gas stations.

397
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,980
Waiting on tables....

398
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,690
Whoa, that was a low point.

399
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,070
I'll never forget it...

400
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,200
...and l'll never, never do that again.

401
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
No matter what.

402
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,080
But l had to sing.

403
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:21,580
I somehow feel most alive
when l'm singing.

404
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,580
It's like....

405
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,340
You don't wanna hear all this, do you?

406
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,380
Do you mind?

407
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,130
Mind? No, l'm having a wonderful time.

408
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Here, we turn here. l live on that street.

409
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Is there anything more l should know
about your fascinating life?

410
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,150
There must be more.

411
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,320
Oh, there is. A whole scrapbook full.

412
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,900
Oh.

413
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,610
Come in.

414
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,580
Well, have you had enough,
as the Republicans used to say?

415
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,080
You know about as much about me now
as l do of myself.

416
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,750
But you see how long it's taken me
to get this far.

417
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,380
Now, all I need is just a little luck.

418
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,680
-What kind of luck?
-Oh....

419
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,510
The kind of luck that every girl singer
with a band dreams of.

420
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,930
One night a talent scout
from a big record company will come in.

421
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,940
And he'll let me make a record.

422
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,270
Yes, and then?

423
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,400
Oh, the record'll become number one
on the hit parade.

424
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,940
Be played on the jukeboxes
all over the country.

425
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,160
And l'll be made.

426
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,780
End of dream.

427
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,410
-There's only one thing wrong with that.
-l know. lt won't happen.

428
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,250
No, it might happen very easily.
Only the dream isn't big enough.

429
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,960
How long will you be playing
at the Grove?

430
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,380
Well, tonight was our last night.
We leave for San Francisco in the morning.

431
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,090
Don't go.

432
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,220
-What?
-Quit. Leave the band. Stay on here.

433
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,980
Let me see what I can do for you
at the studio. l'll talk to Niles right away.

434
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,020
It's just a chance, but take it.

435
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,320
A chance?

436
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,400
Do you realize l'd be giving up
everything I ever worked for?

437
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,660
That's right. But it's served its purpose.
Listen to me, Esther.

438
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,990
A career is a curious thing.
Talent isn't always enough.

439
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,160
You need a sense of timing,
an eye for seeing the turning point...

440
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,920
...or recognizing the big chance
when it comes along and grabbing it.

441
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,840
A career can rest on a trifle like....

442
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,340
Like us sitting here tonight.

443
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,510
Or it can turn on somebody's
saying to you:

444
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,510
"You're better than that.
You're better than you know."

445
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,310
Don't settle for the little dream.
Go on to the big one.

446
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,980
Scared? Scared to take the plunge?

447
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,240
Yes.

448
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,700
Say, what makes you so sure about me?

449
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,950
I heard you sing.

450
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,210
-Yeah, but that--
-l know, just my word.

451
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,710
But you know yourself, don't you?

452
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,590
You just needed somebody to tell you.

453
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,800
Well, l'm certainly mixed up now.

454
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,220
-l thought l was doing just fine.
-Don't look so miserable.

455
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,680
You don't have make up your mind now.
Sleep on it.

456
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,730
I'll call you first thing in the morning.

457
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,230
Sleep on it.
You fixed me for sleep, all right.

458
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,440
Whether you do it or not,
don't ever forget how good you are.

459
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,570
Hang on to that.

460
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Because I'm right.

461
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,740
Good night, Esther.

462
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:47,160
Good night, Mr. Maine. Thank you.

463
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,130
-Hey.
-Hm?

464
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,340
I just wanna take another look at you.

465
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,290
- Hello. Who is it?
- Oliver?

466
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,790
Who? Norman.

467
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
Oliver, just hold on a moment.

468
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,720
-Are you in jail? What have you done?
-Yeah, yeah, no....

469
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,840
No, no, l'm not.

470
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,310
This girl, it turns out,
she's a fabulous singer.

471
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,310
-You heard a girl sing.
-No, this girl--

472
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,600
-Well, isn't that nice?
-No. Don't make me mad.

473
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,060
-Do you know what time it is?
-Wonderful talent. Now, listen, please.

474
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,230
-Yes, yes, l hear you.
-All right.

475
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,650
Every word.

476
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,450
You heard a girl sing.
What do you want me to do, applaud?

477
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,990
Yes.

478
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,250
Yes, l hear you. Yup.

479
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,330
Anything.

480
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,170
Well, thanks, Oliver.

481
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,800
Now, you go on back to sleep...

482
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,890
...because I want you to be nice and fresh
in the morning when l bring her around.

483
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,060
Who is it?

484
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,440
It's me.

485
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,150
Are you asleep, Danny?

486
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,900
Not anymore. What's the matter?

487
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,860
I'm sorry, but I had to see you.

488
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,740
Something wrong? Hand me a cigarette.

489
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,410
A cigarette. Over there.

490
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,120
Oh, sure.

491
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm quitting the band, Danny.
I'm not going on to Frisco in the morning.

492
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
-You crazy or something?
-Maybe.

493
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,470
Maybe, but I'm quitting.

494
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,720
Why? What happened?

495
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,770
Norman Maine is gonna get me
a screen test.

496
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,820
Go on back to bed, will you, Esther?

497
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,820
Well, it's true.

498
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,740
You been drinking with him?

499
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,320
-Of course not.
-Okay, then when we get to Frisco...

500
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,160
...l'll take you to a doctor
and have your head examined.

501
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:57,120
What's the matter with you, Esther? He was
making a conventional pass, that's all.

502
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,660
No. No, it wasn't that, Danny.

503
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,710
What else is it? He follows bands
around and gives singers screen tests?

504
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,840
What's got into you?

505
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,930
He gave me a look at myself
I've never had before.

506
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,180
He saw something in me
nobody else ever did.

507
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,060
And he made me see it too.

508
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,440
He made me believe it.

509
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,940
Believe what?
It's taken all these years for you...

510
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,610
...to get with a big-name outfit.
You gonna toss it all in the ashcan?

511
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,690
And for what?

512
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,320
For a chance at being something...

513
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,040
...something bigger
than l ever dreamed of.

514
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,710
And l'm not gonna turn back now.

515
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,460
Ever.

516
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,680
Coffee's almost ready.

517
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,600
I don't want any coffee.
I'm wide awake now.

518
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,730
Oh, Danny.

519
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,520
Don't be mad at me.

520
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,320
I....

521
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,490
I'll be up in time to see you off
in the morning.

522
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,750
I guess I'd better go.

523
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,080
How much money have you got, Esther?

524
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,370
Money?

525
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,960
Oh. A little.

526
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,880
Enough to last for a couple of weeks.

527
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,670
Oh, you'll be all signed up
and in front of the cameras by then.

528
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,970
Oh, you fool.

529
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,260
You fool.

530
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,260
You think so?

531
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,270
Then why do I feel like this?

532
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,660
- Goodbye, honey.
- Bye-bye.

533
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,280
Good luck to you.

534
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,200
- Wait a minute, Danny.
- Bye.

535
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,040
Wish me luck.

536
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,130
Luck? You silly....

537
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,290
All right, go ahead and say it.

538
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,170
No, no use. You're going for the ride.

539
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,970
Okay. Good luck.

540
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,140
And don't forget who makes
better vocal arrangements for you...

541
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,810
...better than anybody else in the world!

542
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,320
In his usual wonderful shape, huh?

543
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,490
He'll sleep it off on the plane.
Any idea how long you'll be gone?

544
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,580
Oh, about five or six weeks at least.
This one's being shot mostly on location.

545
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,250
It's a big sea epic.

546
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,790
He won't see anything for a long time
but the stuff he hates, water.

547
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,130
So long.

548
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,650
All right, cut!

549
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,690
That's the one. Wrap it up.

550
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,070
- All right.
- Bring us in.

551
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,030
They got it.

552
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,910
Bring them on in here.
Bring them straight on in.

553
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,870
Very nice.

554
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,430
- Thank you. Eddie. Eddie.
- Drink that coffee.

555
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,350
- Where's Eddie?
- Talk to Eddie later.

556
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,930
Oh, there you are, Eddie.
Any luck? Did you find it?

557
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,390
Mr. Maine,
there's about 300 bungalow courts...

558
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,980
...around Sunset and Highland.

559
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,690
- Can't you remember the number?
- Just the neighborhood.

560
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,780
Go ahead, take that telephone book
and ring all 300. Go on.

561
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,610
Norm, will you go down
and dry off?

562
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,740
- l need you in the cabin shot.
- Yeah, yeah.

563
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,570
What's with this phone-book routine?

564
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,620
The usual, some dame.

565
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,330
Eddie. Hey, Eddie.

566
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,250
It has the name of a flower on the side.
A poinsettia or zinnia or something.

567
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,290
Get the studio to have someone
take a car and cruise around there!

568
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,460
For two days if necessary!

569
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,720
But find that place!

570
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,130
Four days?

571
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,140
But you're behind schedule now, Bob.

572
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,760
Is Maine drunk?

573
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,100
Tell me the truth. Don't cover for him, Bob.
I want to know.

574
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,730
Okay, we'll shoot around him.

575
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,100
Try and make up the time
as soon as he's up.

576
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,940
Cut some corners, Bob.
You've got to bring it in on time.

577
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,150
You know how tough things are
right now.

578
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,990
They're on my neck from New York
every day.

579
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,820
Okay, l understand.

580
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,280
What's so amusing?

581
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,660
Maine sick?

582
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,660
Bad case of flu, 1 03 temperature.

583
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,750
Kept him on the water too long, l'll bet.

584
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,130
Water would have a bad effect on him.

585
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,360
Oh, Esther,
somebody called you about a job.

586
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,530
Said to call right back.
The number's on the phone over there.

587
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,360
Thanks.

588
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,370
Mr. Blake?

589
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,710
Yes.

590
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,630
Singing?

591
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,010
Yes. On the set at 9.

592
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,470
Thank you very much.

593
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,840
It's very nice

594
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,970
It's a bargain at double the price

595
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,520
Try it and find as long as you live

596
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,070
Your crowning glory
Will be most attractive

597
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,490
If you want to be a girl
That the men run to

598
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,950
Use Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo

599
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,250
Take my advice

600
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:01,750
It's a bargain at double the price

601
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,380
l'm gonna talk quick.
We took a break, I've gotta get back.

602
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,930
Listen, l squared it with Williams.
He'll take you back.

603
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,600
I'll wire the dough for the fare,
join us in Cleveland.

604
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,600
Give me that address again.

605
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,430
I don't get it.

606
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,350
Do you know what the odds are
against you?

607
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,230
Danny, you're wasting
your breath. l haven't--

608
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,940
I don't think about him.
I forgot him weeks ago.

609
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,450
But he did show me the way
and that's what I'm sticking to.

610
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,120
- l don't care if I have to scrub floors--
- Your order's ready. Pick it up.

611
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,120
Danny, l've gotta go.
All right. Goodbye. Thank you.

612
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,800
Here you go.

613
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,140
-Good evening.
-Well, what's good to eat today?

614
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,180
Cheeseburgers, nut burgers,
banana burgers, chicken burgers...

615
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,810
...lobster burgers, tuna burgers,
chop-suey burgers...

616
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,810
...and the super-duper super burger.

617
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,190
What's in that?

618
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,270
Everything in the place. All burgered.

619
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,990
You haven't any idea? The
faintest idea where she might have gone?

620
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,740
I told you, sir. l told you three times.

621
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,160
That when people can't afford
the moderate rates--

622
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,620
Yes, yes. Thank you.
Thank you so very much.

623
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,830
Oleander Arms.

624
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,080
Well, no wonder
I couldn't remember the name.

625
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,460
Why can't you call
your place something like--?

626
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,670
What?

627
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,920
Never mind.

628
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,050
I bet you've never seen an oleander
in your life.

629
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,010
Normie. Pumpkin.

630
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,600
Oh, pumpkin, now, really.

631
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,020
You just can't lie here
on a lovely day like this.

632
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,690
l can so just lie here
on a lovely day like this.

633
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,570
What's the matter, Normie,
have I offended you?

634
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,150
Well, if I have, darling,
I'm really terribly sorry.

635
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,490
All I did was remember
what you promised me.

636
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,620
What did I promise you?
Was it a blue mink or a white mink?

637
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,910
Or have they done something else
to the poor minks while I was away?

638
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,710
Normie, darling, it's not presents
I want. lt's you, pumpkin, just you.

639
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,210
It's a bargain at double the price

640
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,510
Don't you remember?

641
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,630
You said as soon as you finished
that nasty old picture we'd go to Honolulu.

642
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,970
Now what's the matter?

643
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,470
- That singing.
- Singing?

644
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,970
Yeah, on this television
while you were talking.

645
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,600
- Singing something.
- Television?

646
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,850
It's just an old commercial, silly.

647
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,310
Normie?

648
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,150
For heaven's sake, Norman.

649
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,050
Miss Barker! Hey, Miss Barker!

650
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,550
Who do you think just went upstairs?

651
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,420
Hey! Get away from that car!
Get away from that car!

652
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,050
Hey! Hey!

653
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,140
Hey!

654
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,810
- Hello!
- Oh!

655
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,270
Come on up.

656
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,980
All right.

657
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,490
Oh, l look so terrible.

658
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,200
Never mind how you look, listen
to me. I got shanghaied away. Location.

659
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,830
I tried, believe me, I tried....

660
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,830
Get away from that car! l'm gonna
beat your brains out when I get down!

661
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,790
Get away!

662
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,460
Oh, this is so awful.

663
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,130
You could stand a good dinner.

664
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,180
l could, and in a place
with tablecloths too.

665
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,890
What about a drive to the beach?

666
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,930
We could stop off for a hamburger
on the way and then have a late supper.

667
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,180
What's the matter? What is it, Esther?

668
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,060
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

669
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,470
It's the nose. The nose is the problem.

670
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,230
-Maybe a corrective in the nostril.
-No.

671
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,650
-Could I--?
-Please, little lady, Mr. Ettinger's thinking.

672
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,440
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Just about time for one of his miracles.

673
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,710
Do you think maybe...?

674
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,930
Do you think maybe
the Dietrich eyebrows?

675
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,600
No. The nose is still the problem.

676
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,600
Suppose we try the Crawford
mouth. Take attention away from the nose.

677
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,440
No. No.

678
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,100
Do you think maybe a hair job?

679
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,860
Yes.

680
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,480
I think that'd be fine.

681
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,380
Mr. Maine.

682
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,670
-Sorry, l'm late for an appointment.
-But--

683
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,840
-Catch me in the commissary later.
-Mr. Maine.

684
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,350
Oh, no.

685
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,770
No.

686
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,980
What's the matter with it?

687
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,110
I don't think that's very nice.
Go ahead, laugh your head off.

688
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,990
I've been sitting in that chair
since 6:00 this morning.

689
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,040
You sat an hour too long, honey.

690
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,460
Come on.

691
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:33,290
Now, sit down in that chair.

692
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,080
Here?

693
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,050
Well, first things first.

694
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,850
Now, what else is there?

695
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,230
Is that you?

696
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Off it comes.

697
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,360
Now, wait, don't-- Don't-- Don't....

698
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,570
My nose is very bad.

699
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,450
Now, take every bit of that junk
off your face.

700
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,750
But my eyes are all wrong
and my ears are too big and...

701
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,290
...l've got no chin.

702
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,750
I know.

703
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Come on, take it off.

704
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,920
Then put on your eyebrows and lipstick
the way you always do and l'll do the rest.

705
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:28,590
Come on, you've gotta be made up
and ready to shoot that test by 9:00.

706
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,260
-But, Mr. Maine--
-l think at this critical moment...

707
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,140
...you might call me Norman.

708
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:39,100
Norman, what difference does it make
how well l sing if my face is so awful?

709
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,480
Your face is just dandy.

710
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,650
Now, wipe it off.

711
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,630
Once more unto the breach, dear friends.

712
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,550
Once more.

713
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,810
Hey, you're shivering.
Let me get you something to....

714
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,640
Here, put this around you.

715
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,810
Norman, I've got the willies.

716
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,810
I'm scared stiff.

717
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,570
I don't think l could sing a note.

718
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,070
Nothing would come out.

719
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,660
Of course you're scared. We all are.
What makes you think you wouldn't be?

720
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,950
Look, forget the camera.

721
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,330
It's the Downbeat Club
at 3:00 in the morning...

722
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,120
...and you're singing for yourself
and for the band.

723
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,170
Mainly for yourself, the way I heard you.

724
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,750
Just keep that picture in your mind.

725
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,590
And if that doesn't do it, think of
a man in a car eating a nut burger.

726
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:55,100
That did it. Come on.

727
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,710
-Miss Markham?
-Yes?

728
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,210
I was told to see you.
I'm Esther Blodgett.

729
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,970
Oh, yes? l expected a blond.

730
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,720
I don't know why.

731
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,390
-You've just signed a contract with us?
-Yes, I have.

732
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,890
-Good. Good. Glad to have you with us.
-Thank you.

733
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,980
We'll have to get
what you've done so far.

734
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,520
-Where you came from and so forth.
-l brought my scrapbook with me.

735
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,570
-And I thought that maybe--
-Thanks, dear. Very nice.

736
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,280
I'll have to turn you over
to Miss Fusselow of Fashions.

737
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,240
This layout has got to get out
to three magazines.

738
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,410
-Come along, dear. Come along.
-Yes, ma'am.

739
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,330
- Glad to have you with us.
- Thank you.

740
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:00,540
Nora?

741
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,460
Take care of this for me, will you?
New contract player. Norman Maine.

742
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,290
-Hello, honey, nice to have you with us.
-Hello.

743
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,420
Soon as l get some background on you,
I must do a fashion style.

744
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,090
-Well, l brought a scrapbook--
-Oh, not now, dear.

745
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,970
I've gotta get these dresses
right down to Photo.

746
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,430
Come along, honey.

747
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,430
All right.

748
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,820
I'll tell you what to do, honey.
Why don't you go in and see Mr. Libby?

749
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,110
-Mr. Libby?
-His office is right over there.

750
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,570
He's head of the department.

751
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,490
-Glad to have you with us.
-Thank you.

752
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,450
Your hand a little higher. That's good.

753
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,040
-Get out of the way.
-Oh, say--

754
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,160
-Would you get out of the way?
-Yes, I'm--

755
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,250
-Just get out of the way.
-Please excuse--

756
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,630
Leave them alone. They're all right.
That's all right. Out of the way.

757
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,010
- Yes.
- Would you lie back?

758
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,180
Let's take this picture.
Raise your hand....

759
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,390
Mr. Libby?

760
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,930
-l'm Esther Blodgett.
-Uh-huh.

761
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,140
-Uh, Miss Fusselow--
-Glad to have you with us.

762
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,480
Well, it certainly is a thrill to be here.

763
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,780
I brought my scrapbook along in case--

764
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,860
Care to say hello to the big boss?
That's the usual procedure.

765
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,700
-Come, I'll take you to him.
-Fine.

766
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,320
May be the only chance
you get to meet him.

767
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,660
What's the matter?
You afraid of heights?

768
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,670
No, no. I--

769
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,180
- Mr. Niles.
- Libby?

770
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,350
-l'm running a picture.
-You ought to meet this lady.

771
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,890
She just signed a contract.

772
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,810
The one that Mr. Maine
arranged the test for, you remember?

773
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,730
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

774
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,060
Nice to see you, dear.

775
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,690
Glad to have you with us.

776
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,780
Well, it's a thrill to be here.

777
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,370
Show Miss.... How to get out of here.

778
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,750
Good luck to you, dear.

779
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,510
Take care of yourself.

780
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,140
-Oh, Mr. Libby?
-What?

781
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:33,060
-What do I do next?
-Well, the gate's right down there.

782
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,230
-What did you say your name was again?
-Esther Blodgett.

783
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,320
-What?
-Esther Blodgett.

784
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:42,070
Well, we'll have to do something about
that right away. Don't worry about it.

785
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,660
We'll have a new name for you
by the end of the week.

786
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,120
Paul, will you swing your arc
over here, please?

787
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,620
That's good. Hold it.

788
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,700
-George.
-Can we make it?

789
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,000
All ready, sir.

790
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,420
- Get the girl.
- Yes, sir.

791
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,090
- George?
- Oh, Esther.

792
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,380
- Pull that one down a couple of turns.
- Esther.

793
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,970
Esther. Waiting for you on the set.

794
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,180
Okay, boys, let's go. Everybody works.

795
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,140
-Right up there. Up the steps.
-Okay.

796
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,470
Stand by, everybody.

797
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,640
All right, sir.

798
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,520
-Now, you know what l want.
-Yes.

799
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,480
Put your arm out the window like this
and you wave goodbye.

800
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,730
-Give it everything you've got.
-All right.

801
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,530
-Okay, get over there.
-Okay.

802
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,820
- All right, let's take a try at it.
- Here we go. Hit your lights.

803
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,660
Hit your wind.

804
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,330
Hit your snow.

805
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,170
Hit your steam.

806
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,930
Roll them.

807
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,430
Speed. Action.

808
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,120
-We're getting her face.
-Cut.

809
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,700
- Hold it.
- We saw her face.

810
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,660
We saw your face.

811
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,790
-We saw her face.
-We saw your face.

812
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,040
-We saw your face.
-l'm sorry.

813
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,370
- Watch it, Esther.
- l will.

814
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,170
- Let's try it again.
- Watch it.

815
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,960
-l will.
-Now, be careful this time.

816
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,340
Just the arm and the hand.

817
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,550
-l don't want to see your face.
-l'm sorry.

818
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,470
- Let's try it again.
- Hit everything.

819
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,930
- Come on.
- Speed.

820
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,890
Action.

821
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,900
Esther Blodgett, please.

822
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,240
Go to L.

823
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,660
-What?
-Go to L.

824
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,450
-Now--
-Go to window marked L.

825
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,620
You're listed under L.

826
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,790
Oh. Thank you.

827
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,750
-Esther Blodgett, please.
-New here?

828
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,210
-Yes.
-Just a moment.

829
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,590
Okay. Your name is Vicki Lester.

830
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,550
-What?
-Your name is Vicki Lester.

831
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,010
Vicki Lester. V-l-C-K-I L-E-S-T-E-R.
Get it?

832
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,230
Move on, please.

833
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,810
Oh, yes. Thank you.

834
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,070
Vicki Lester?

835
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:21,710
Vicki Lester.

836
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,150
Why couldn't you come over to my office
to see me, Norman?

837
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:45,820
What's so hush-hush
that you have to drag me down here?

838
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:49,940
Every time l lie down on this sofa,
I get stabbed in the back.

839
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:53,360
-Well, what do you want?
-That's what I wanna talk to you about.

840
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,740
Come, l want you to sit in this chair.
The place gives me the creeps.

841
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,620
-What's with you?
-Hasn't been decorated in centuries. Sit.

842
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,670
Now, isn't that the most
uncomfortable chair you ever sat in?

843
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,250
Don't l deserve a dressing room...

844
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,380
-...that's cheerful, modern, safe?
-You got me down here to talk about this?

845
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,590
When I give an interview,
I feel ashamed.

846
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,300
I have a whole studio sitting on me
and you get me down here for this?

847
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,800
-Don't you feel ashamed?
-Don't you realize...

848
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,680
...l have a production shut down
in the middle of shooting?

849
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,350
That's what you got me away from.

850
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,270
I'm being stabbed by a singer
in New York, not just a sofa.

851
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,820
You had to stop because you couldn't
get her here. What are you gonna do?

852
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:31,490
I don't know. l don't know
what I'm going to do except go crazy.

853
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,700
That woman, she swore
her contract was up for the show.

854
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,450
Our lawyers are talking about it
to New York this afternoon.

855
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,290
Why do they have to play that stuff
so loud?

856
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,920
You better leave it open, Oliver,
we'll be suffocated.

857
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,250
- -crazy game

858
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,710
What is it, anyway?

859
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,710
It's just somebody running some tests.

860
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,800
I can hardly hear myself think.

861
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,850
I suppose there's nobody around here.

862
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,520
-What?
-You'd think there'd be somebody here...

863
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,020
...you could take a chance on, rather than
close down a picture, things being tough.

864
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,770
Who, for instance? Name someone.

865
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,900
--be the same

866
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,650
I don't know, Oliver.

867
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,400
New actors.

868
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:16,950
You think all there is to running a studio
is pressing buttons.

869
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,870
It's not quite that easy, believe me.

870
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,540
--every trick of his

871
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,250
Say, who is that singing, anyway?

872
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,080
It must be one of the contract girls.

873
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,090
Not bad.

874
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,840
No.

875
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:38,340
And where's he gone to?

876
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:39,760
Not bad.

877
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,350
The road gets rougher

878
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,850
It's lonelier and tougher

879
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,100
Not bad at all.

880
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,600
--you burn up

881
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,320
Tomorrow he will turn up

882
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,530
There's just no letup

883
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,780
A light begins to break. Very dumb of me.

884
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,870
All right, l get it.

885
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,620
A little late, that's all.

886
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,960
Is she still around?

887
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:08,960
Indeed, indeed.

888
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,460
Esther?

889
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,070
Very good. Thanks, Esther.
Except right down here, l think--

890
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,740
I shouldn't go that far.

891
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,330
Well, use our hands.
Fine, let's all do it again. Ready?

892
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,000
l've been through this
a hundred times, Esther.

893
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,670
My own previews
as well as other people's.

894
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
And the thing to remember
about a preview...

895
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:58,550
...is first and foremost,
pay absolutely no attention...

896
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,340
...to the sights and sounds
going on around you.

897
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,140
If the picture before the preview
is a stinker...

898
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,140
...then your picture
gets off to a good start, but....

899
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,440
Anyway, they always go out
for fresh popcorn...

900
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,860
...so that the first few reels always sound
like the Marines landing on Iwo Jima.

901
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,440
- And the thing to do--
- Norman?

902
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:17,740
Yes?

903
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,360
Would you stop the car, please?

904
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,020
Are you all right?

905
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,940
Fine. l wish I was dead.

906
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:09,950
Come on.

907
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,760
-We're in luck, Esther. We're in luck.
-Why? Did the theater burn down?

908
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:31,390
That picture of mine is so bad,
anything they see after will seem great.

909
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,770
You're starting lucky.

910
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,780
Swanee, how l love ya

911
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:47,030
How I love ya
My dear old Swanee

912
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:52,250
The folks up north will see me no more

913
01:08:52,410 --> 01:09:03,260
When l get to that Swanee shore

914
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:42,090
Thank you. Thank you very much.

915
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,800
I can't express it any other way.

916
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:51,310
For, with this awful trembling
in my heart...

917
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,270
...l just can't find another thing to say.

918
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,860
I'm happy that you liked the show.

919
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,730
I'm grateful you liked me.

920
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:07,910
And l'm sure to you,
the tribute seemed quite right.

921
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:13,490
But if you knew of all the years

922
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:18,250
Of hopes and dreams and tears

923
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:22,710
You'd know it didn't happen

924
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:29,340
Overnight

925
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,600
Overnight.

926
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,480
I was born in a trunk

927
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,480
In the Princess Theater

928
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:51,910
ln Pocatello, ldaho

929
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:59,250
It was during the matinee on Friday

930
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,710
And they used a makeup towel

931
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,010
For my didee

932
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,180
When l first saw the light

933
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,600
It was pink and amber

934
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,480
Coming from the footlights

935
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,060
On the stage

936
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,230
When my dad carried me out there

937
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,240
To say hello

938
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:36,790
They tell me
That I stopped the show

939
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:43,790
So I grew up in a crazy world
Of dressing rooms

940
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,710
And hotel rooms and waiting rooms

941
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,840
And rooms behind the scenes

942
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:56,310
And l can't forget the endless rows

943
01:11:56,470 --> 01:12:00,140
Of sleepless nights and eatless nights

944
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,730
And nights without a nickel

945
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:09,150
In my jeans

946
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,950
But it's all in the game

947
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,490
And the way you play it

948
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:24,290
And you've gotta play the game, you know

949
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,630
When you're born in a trunk

950
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:33,510
At the Princess Theater

951
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,010
In Pocatello

952
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:44,190
Idaho

953
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:51,110
At first I just stood
And watched from the wings

954
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,160
That's all my mom and dad would allow

955
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:02,080
But as l got older
I got a little bolder

956
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:07,710
And snuck out for their second bow

957
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,380
They kept me in the act
Because they needed me to milk applause

958
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:19,720
Until one night
They did a crazy thing

959
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,770
They left me out there all alone

960
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,900
Mama said,
"You're on your own"

961
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:31,190
And Papa shouted,
"This is it kid, sing"

962
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:44,250
I'll get by

963
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:49,250
As long as l

964
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,260
Have you

965
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:58,640
Though there be rain

966
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,890
And darkness too

967
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:07,690
I'll not complain

968
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:14,190
I'll see it through

969
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:19,700
I learned very quickly
The tricks of the trade

970
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:25,450
I practiced after everyone was gone

971
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,500
And with the tricks
I learned traditions

972
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:32,460
And the hardest one of all

973
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:34,840
Is no matter what

974
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:40,640
The show must go on

975
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:46,810
As time went by
I looked for jobs

976
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:51,150
And was kicked from pillar to post

977
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,650
I haunted all the agents' offices

978
01:14:57,070 --> 01:15:01,740
And l almost ended up a ghost

979
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,960
I'm a sentimental sap
That's all

980
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,960
What's the use of trying not to fall

981
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,340
I have no will
You made your kill

982
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,550
'Cause you took advantage of me

983
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,470
No.

984
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,900
I'm just like an apple on the bough

985
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,980
And you're gonna
Shake me down somehow

986
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:39,280
So, what's the use
You cooked my goose

987
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:41,360
'Cause you took advantage of me

988
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:43,240
No.

989
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,880
I'm so hot and bothered
That I don't know

990
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,210
My elbow from my ear

991
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,550
Suffer something awful each time you go

992
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,050
But much worse when you're near

993
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,050
Here am I with all my bridges burned

994
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,760
Just a babe in arms
Where you're concerned

995
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,640
So lock the doors
Call me yours

996
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:15,020
'Cause you took advantage of me

997
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,610
Yes.

998
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,900
No.

999
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,450
So I got into a tap show

1000
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,460
All l did was kick my feet

1001
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,000
You'd hardly call it a chance to sing

1002
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:42,300
But at least it was a chance to eat

1003
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,850
They call it black bottom

1004
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,060
A new twister

1005
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,230
But sure got him
An old sister

1006
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:56,150
They clap their hands
And do the raggedy trot

1007
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,650
Hot
Ooh!

1008
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,280
Old fellows with lumbago

1009
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,610
And young fellows, away they go

1010
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,620
They jump right in
And give it all that they've got

1011
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,790
Then one night something happened.

1012
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,250
Dame fortune showed her face.

1013
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:19,380
The star got sick
and l was told to go on in her place.

1014
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,390
But she recovered.

1015
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,230
Oh, well.

1016
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,770
Black bottom
A new rhythm

1017
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,150
When you spot 'em
You go with 'em

1018
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,400
And do that
Black, black, black, black bottom

1019
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,490
You won't be blue
When you have got 'em

1020
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:48,240
If you do that
Black, black, black, black bottom all day

1021
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,830
But finally l got an offer
To sing in New York

1022
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,290
And I wired, "I'm on my way"

1023
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:05,010
I had visions that this would be
A fabulous, famous cafe

1024
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:11,260
Filled with high society
Elegance and spruce

1025
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:15,430
And l pictured me
The epitome

1026
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,810
Of a very chic chanteuse

1027
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,700
Peanuts

1028
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,490
Through every city, town
And country lane

1029
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,080
You'll hear him sing
His plaintive little strain

1030
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,290
And as he goes by
To you he'll say

1031
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,370
Sing "Melancholy Baby."

1032
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:44,880
Peanuts

1033
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,260
The little children like to trail along

1034
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:49,800
They like to hear
The peanut vendor's song

1035
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:52,890
They all laugh with glee
When he will say

1036
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:56,060
-Sing "Melancholy Baby."
-"Melancholy Baby."

1037
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,390
Come to me

1038
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:04,980
My melancholy

1039
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:09,400
Baby

1040
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,410
Cuddle up

1041
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:18,040
And don't be blue

1042
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,250
All your fears are foolish fancy

1043
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,840
Shh.

1044
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,550
Maybe

1045
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,930
You know, dear

1046
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:43,650
That I'm in love with you

1047
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:50,490
Every cloud must have

1048
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:57,660
A silver lining

1049
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,790
Wait

1050
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:10,050
Until the sun shines through

1051
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:17,310
Smile, my honey dear

1052
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:21,940
While I kiss away

1053
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:27,230
Each tear

1054
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:33,030
Or else I shall be

1055
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:39,290
Melancholy

1056
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,830
Too

1057
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:51,010
My benefactor appeared with his card.

1058
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:53,840
And at first, l thought he was fresh.

1059
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,010
Fresh?

1060
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:59,260
He was fresh from heaven
All right

1061
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:03,520
He produced the show
That gave me the chance

1062
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:08,730
To sing for you tonight

1063
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,490
Swanee, how l love ya

1064
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:16,700
How I love ya
My dear old Swanee

1065
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,370
I'd give the world to be

1066
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,750
Among the folks in

1067
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:27,420
D-I-X-I-Even now my mammy's
Waitin' for me

1068
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:31,510
Prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee

1069
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:35,680
The folks up north will see me no more

1070
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,390
When l get to that Swanee shore

1071
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:43,230
Swanee

1072
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:47,600
I'm coming back to Swanee

1073
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,900
Mammy

1074
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:53,360
l love the old folks at home

1075
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:59,320
I love ya, Swanee

1076
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,830
How I love ya
How I love ya

1077
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,910
My dear old Swanee

1078
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:10,840
I'd give the world if l could only be

1079
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,210
Sittin' on my mammy's knee

1080
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:18,260
l love the old folks
I love the young folks

1081
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:22,470
Oh, my honey lamb
You love 'em all in Alabamy

1082
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,770
Mammy

1083
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,520
My dear old mammy

1084
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:33,860
Your wanderin' child
Will wander no more

1085
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:39,950
When l get to that Swanee

1086
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:48,500
Shore

1087
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,890
So I can't quite be called

1088
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:06,810
Overnight sensation

1089
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:13,980
For it started many years ago

1090
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:19,200
When l was born in a trunk

1091
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,950
In the Princess Theater

1092
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,160
In Pocatello

1093
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:37,670
Idaho

1094
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,740
-Wait, wait.
-Oliver. Oliver.

1095
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,820
What about Vicki
for the Morgan script?

1096
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,200
Starts shooting next week.

1097
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:32,080
Where's Norman?

1098
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,910
Vicki, l want you to read
this script because....

1099
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:41,300
-Vicki.
-Oliver....

1100
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,720
Thank you.

1101
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,810
Is nobody buying anybody a drink
on the strength of all this success?

1102
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:54,850
I heard a few comments about my film
which makes me feel the need of one.

1103
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:58,980
-Vicki, we'll see you over at my house.
-All right. All right, fine.

1104
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:08,240
Ray. Hey, your score was
out of this world, the greatest.

1105
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Say, l've never seen preview cards
like this in my life.

1106
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,420
I waited for the breakdown.

1107
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,010
Ninety-seven percent say
you got yourself a new star.

1108
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,260
Read these, gentlemen,
and enjoy yourselves.

1109
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,800
I'll need a lot of stuff on you, Vicki.
Be in my office tomorrow morning.

1110
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:33,010
- That is, if you can make it.
- Now, here. Here, this is just....

1111
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,890
Read this part.

1112
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,560
This is what I was telling you about.
This is very interesting.

1113
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:41,940
They all say her performance was excellent.
Get a load of these. See?

1114
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:44,360
Every one says the same thing.

1115
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:53,410
It's all yours, Esther.

1116
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:02,460
And l don't mean just the Cadillacs
and the swimming pools.

1117
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,500
It's all yours.

1118
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:06,720
In more ways than one.

1119
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,680
I hope....

1120
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,260
Yes, Norman, go ahead.
Say what you.... Would you?

1121
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,430
You're gonna be a great star.
Don't let that change you too much.

1122
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,480
Don't let it take over your life.

1123
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,480
You're very dear.

1124
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,740
Norman, you make this sound
like the end of something...

1125
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,120
...instead of the beginning.
You make it sound like goodbye.

1126
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,580
I've done all I can for you.

1127
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:36,620
You've come along the road with me
as far as you should.

1128
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:38,910
Let's leave it that way.

1129
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:45,550
Norman, don't you know
how l feel about you?

1130
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:46,920
Yes. Yes, l do.

1131
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:49,800
Don't you know nothing about you
could make any difference?

1132
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,930
-lt's too late.
-No, it isn't. It is not--

1133
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:54,430
It is, l tell you.

1134
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,600
-Norman, there's nothing you can--
-Listen to me--

1135
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:01,440
-l love you. I will not--
-l destroy everything I touch. l always have.

1136
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,980
-No.
-Forget me, I'm a bad lot.

1137
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,900
You've come too late.

1138
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,700
I don't believe that.

1139
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,910
It's not too late.
Not for you, not for me.

1140
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,540
Don't say that, Esther.

1141
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,330
I might begin to believe it.

1142
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,040
Please, believe it. Believe it.

1143
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,760
Believe it. Believe it.

1144
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:38,260
-l think they're all rehearsed.
-Fine, Jeff.

1145
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:48,150
- We're ready whenever you are.
- Okay.

1146
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:14,840
What am I here for?

1147
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:18,720
It's time you knew

1148
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:22,730
Here's what l'm here for

1149
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:26,860
I'm here for you

1150
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,980
Can you forgive me?

1151
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:34,900
Am l too late?

1152
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,370
All the years that I wandered

1153
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:44,710
And pondered were squandered

1154
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,540
My heart insisted

1155
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:53,210
I seek you out

1156
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,220
That you existed

1157
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:01,390
My heart had no doubt

1158
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,680
To share a journey

1159
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:10,730
That leads to heaven's door

1160
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:18,870
You'll find is what I'm here

1161
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:22,200
For

1162
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:31,460
What am I here for?

1163
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:35,420
It's time you knew

1164
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,260
Here's what l'm here for

1165
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:42,930
I'm here for you

1166
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:46,640
Can you forgive me?

1167
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:49,980
Am l too late?

1168
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:53,480
All the years that I wandered

1169
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:59,070
And pondered were squandered

1170
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:03,450
My heart insisted

1171
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:08,960
I seek you out

1172
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,750
That you existed

1173
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,670
My heart had no doubt

1174
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,470
Cut. That's it. Wonderful.

1175
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:19,800
Maestro, very good.
Esther, listen to this one.

1176
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,300
Come on.

1177
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,850
Okay, let's have the playback.

1178
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,350
Just the last eight.
I want the chorus arrangement.

1179
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,980
- Take a smoke, boys.
- My, it sounded really good.

1180
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,850
Sounded real good.

1181
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:38,820
My heart had no doubt

1182
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:42,160
To share a journey

1183
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:48,500
That leads to heaven's door

1184
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:57,340
You'll find is what I'm here

1185
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:01,340
For

1186
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,430
What am I here for?

1187
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,890
- How'd I sound?
- Just adequate.

1188
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,560
Best-friend-severest-critic
department, huh?

1189
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,020
What is this?

1190
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:17,940
Listen to the arrangement Danny made.

1191
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:19,320
-Oh, come on.
-Turn it off.

1192
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:20,530
I wasn't listening.

1193
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,950
I was thinking about another kind
of arrangement.

1194
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,240
Another kind?

1195
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:27,120
Uh-huh. Domestic. Will you marry me?

1196
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,040
No, thank you.

1197
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,370
And l wandered and pondered--

1198
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,330
Why not?

1199
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,960
Well, you're irresponsible.

1200
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:36,750
Oh, l'm sorry.

1201
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:40,090
- Go ahead. Stop that.
- Get out of here.

1202
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,340
What else?

1203
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,090
You drink too much

1204
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,470
Suppose l quit drinking?

1205
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:51,890
Suppose l become absolutely
dependable on all occasions?

1206
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,980
You wouldn't be Norman Maine.
I'd be marrying the wrong man.

1207
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,900
- Quiet.
- Norman.

1208
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,610
Yes?

1209
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:06,700
Darling, would you do all that
for me if I said l'd marry you?

1210
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:11,040
No. l've had a chance to think it
over with all that humming and singing.

1211
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,410
It's too much to ask.

1212
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,000
You see?

1213
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,250
Well, goodbye. Goodbye, everyone.

1214
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,590
Oh, now, wait a minute, my boy.
That's much too public a proposal...

1215
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,090
...for me to say no to. l accept.

1216
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,720
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

1217
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,850
Oliver, we're gonna get married.

1218
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,940
I guess I didn't read that line right.
I'll try again.

1219
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,860
We're going to get married.

1220
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,320
-Both of us.
-To each other. What do you think of that?

1221
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:47,870
What's the matter?

1222
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,080
He's trying to decide
if it's good for the studio.

1223
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:54,460
Well, is it?

1224
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:57,460
-lt is. My blessings.
-Thank you.

1225
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:59,130
A little unsteady, but thank you.

1226
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,960
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Libby.

1227
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:03,210
How long a honeymoon
are you going to give us?

1228
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,970
Now, let's see.

1229
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,180
I'll want you back by the ninth.

1230
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,390
No, make it the tenth.

1231
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,010
Now, don't let your heart run away
with your head.

1232
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:16,140
I'll have to call Production and see how
long l can stall off Vicki's wardrobe tests.

1233
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:20,770
While you're settling the details, is it
all right if I go out and buy the lady a ring?

1234
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,650
Sure, we want everything legal.

1235
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:24,570
-Thank you.
-Bye.

1236
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,650
Bye, Oliver.

1237
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,910
- Goodbye, Libby.
- Bye. Bye, Libby.

1238
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:34,660
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

1239
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:39,500
That was quite a decision
you made just now, Oliver.

1240
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:41,590
Decision?

1241
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:45,800
Letting that girl walk into a booby trap.

1242
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,680
Vicki's business is her own.

1243
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,390
Is it?

1244
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:53,600
She's the hottest piece of property
the studio has right now.

1245
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:56,480
This might make the difference
to Norman.

1246
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,690
This might be it.

1247
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:01,270
Any bets?

1248
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,990
Well, l better start the wheels grinding.

1249
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:09,360
A front-page splash on the wedding
would help his slipping box office.

1250
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:12,240
Hello, this is Matt Libby.
Get me my office.

1251
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,830
- Mr. Libby's office.
- Hello. Hello, Markham?

1252
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,830
-Yes, Mr. Libby.
-Lester and Maine are getting married.

1253
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, look, I want all stops pulled.

1254
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,960
Full coverage, every department.
The wedding to end all weddings.

1255
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,380
-Yes, sir.
-All right. Now, see if you can get...

1256
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:30,640
...the mayor to close school that afternoon.
I'll get you the date.

1257
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,390
Get newsreel and television coverage
started right away.

1258
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:38,520
Yeah. Get all traffic routed out of Beverly
Hills for two miles each side of the church.

1259
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,730
Which one?

1260
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,860
The big one. And tell the Life, the TIME,
the AP and the UP boys...

1261
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:48,490
...that l'll set up restricted coverage
with each one of them, personally.

1262
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:51,450
Yeah. The bleachers and everything.
The full treatment.

1263
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,780
Now, if any man can show just cause
why these two...

1264
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:59,750
...may not be lawfully joined together,
let him now speak or else hereafter...

1265
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,580
...forever hold his peace.

1266
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,920
Do you, Ernest Sidney Gubbins,
take this woman for your wedded wife?

1267
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:10,130
I do.

1268
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,590
Will you love, comfort, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...

1269
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,390
...as long as you both shall live?

1270
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,720
I will.

1271
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:21,850
Do you, Esther Blodgett,
take this man for your wedded husband?

1272
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:25,150
- l do.
- Will you obey, serve, love, honor...

1273
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:28,780
...and keep him in sickness and in health
as long as you both shall live?

1274
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:33,490
-l will.
-Now, place the ring on her finger.

1275
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,950
By virtue of the powers vested in me...

1276
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,870
...as justice of peace
of San Verdo township...

1277
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:46,290
...county of Los Angeles,
I pronounce you man and wife.

1278
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:52,260
-Good luck.
-Hooray!

1279
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:58,310
I must exercise my prerogatives of office.

1280
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,850
I wish you all the happiness, miss.

1281
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,190
Thank you so much.

1282
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,270
Same to you.

1283
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,650
-And now, if you'll just sign this.
-Oh, yes.

1284
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:14,070
You know, I'd swear
I'd seen you before, Mrs. Gubbins.

1285
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,280
Oh, really?

1286
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:20,160
Well, l think this is the first time
I've ever been in San Verdo.

1287
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:24,250
You know, your face looks familiar too,
Mr. Gubbins.

1288
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:27,170
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1289
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,960
Thank you.

1290
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:31,170
Here's your receipt.

1291
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,840
-Goodbye.
-Oh, goodbye.

1292
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:35,340
-Bye.
-Bye.

1293
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,800
-Here.
-Thank you.

1294
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:39,850
-l think we got by with it.
-lt was close.

1295
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,520
That J.P. was just beginning
to remember us.

1296
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,020
At least we got away from Libby.

1297
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:46,150
Libby doesn't even know we left town.

1298
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:48,110
All the luck.

1299
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:58,870
Well, if you'll be kind enough to glance
between my shoulder blades...

1300
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:00,530
...Mr. and Mrs. Gubbins...

1301
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,580
...you'll find there a knife,
on its handle are your initials.

1302
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,460
-Oh, now, don't be angry.
-lt's been delightful seeing you.

1303
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,170
- Wait! Wait a minute!
- Goodbye!

1304
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,210
-l've got--
-Bye.

1305
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,590
Well, l wish them joy.

1306
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,180
Wait till they see the press.
It won't be so funny.

1307
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:23,310
-They've a right to get married quietly.
-No, they haven't. He knows better.

1308
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,850
Mr. Public Nuisance could stand
some decent publicity for a change.

1309
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:28,900
I've spent ten years covering up for him.

1310
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:32,440
Killing bad stories, sucking up
to columnists to smooth away his insults.

1311
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:37,070
Who do you think they'll blame for not
letting them cover this today? Him? No. Me.

1312
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,910
I'll look just like a fool.

1313
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:41,830
Double-crossed by a cruddy actor.

1314
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:45,290
Well, he needs this, believe me,
more than I do.

1315
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,250
Okay.

1316
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,880
Just wait your turn, l always say.

1317
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,460
What do you always say, McGuire?

1318
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,290
Ooh.

1319
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:42,140
Well, the first thing to do, l think...

1320
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,970
...is to go and wash your face.
It's quite dirty.

1321
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:49,520
I know my face is dirty. But you didn't
want anybody to recognize us, did you?

1322
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:51,690
No, that's right.

1323
01:39:53,110 --> 01:39:55,520
But you can unmask now.

1324
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:59,570
I paid my $2, l wanna see what l got.
There it is.

1325
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,530
Nice.

1326
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:12,670
Oh. Heh.

1327
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:33,100
And now, folks, Vicki Lester...

1328
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:37,150
...singing the title song
from her new picture It's a New World.

1329
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,820
This is the number one tune
of the hit parade...

1330
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:43,660
...and the number one favorite
on the jukeboxes all over the country.

1331
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:47,660
Vicki Lester, "lt's a New World."

1332
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:50,200
Well, there it is, Esther.

1333
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:54,750
You've got it,
just the way you dreamed it.

1334
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,800
No, I've got more.

1335
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:04,090
Much more.

1336
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:07,850
Hey.

1337
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:10,680
That's for ordinary folks
who have to turn on the radio...

1338
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:14,440
...and put a nickel in the jukebox.
I've got a private copyright of my own.

1339
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,810
Including the Scandinavian.

1340
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:20,900
I've got the built-in original right
in the house, every time l want to hear it.

1341
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:23,070
And l want it now.

1342
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,700
No, you don't.

1343
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:27,120
To kind of celebrate.

1344
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:29,700
All right.

1345
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:36,580
How wonderful that l'm beholding

1346
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:41,420
A never-never land unfolding

1347
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:44,380
Where we polish up the stars

1348
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:47,430
And mountains we move

1349
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:53,060
In a life where all the pleasures

1350
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:58,940
We will prove

1351
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:07,410
It's a new world I see

1352
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:16,330
A new world for me

1353
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:26,090
The tears have rolled off my cheek

1354
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:31,010
And fears fade away

1355
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:37,100
Every time you speak

1356
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:40,650
A new world

1357
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:47,490
Though we're in a tiny room

1358
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:52,240
What a vision of joy

1359
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:58,120
And blossom and bloom

1360
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:03,380
A newfound promise

1361
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:07,260
One that will last

1362
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:11,890
So I'm holding on

1363
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:19,730
And l'm holding fast

1364
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:23,480
You've brought

1365
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:34,030
A new world to me

1366
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:40,710
And that it'll always

1367
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,050
Always

1368
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:51,720
Be

1369
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,480
Well, l've been preparing them.

1370
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,570
You have?
Do you want to see your picture?

1371
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:11,110
-l'd like to.
-Why don't you go and get a good seat?

1372
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,370
-They want to see the black and white.
-Oh, all right, fine.

1373
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:21,620
-Now, listen to this--
-Oh, hello.

1374
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:23,750
-Would you like to see a movie?
-Wonderful.

1375
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,630
We're going to run one.
We feel so classy with a projector.

1376
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,380
You have to put up with
this sort of thing.

1377
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:39,060
-Yeah, can l get you a drink?
-l'm fine, thanks.

1378
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:47,440
All right.

1379
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,960
Stunts and speed
mark the National Air Show.

1380
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:07,250
Vampire jets of the Royal Canadian
Air Force flash overhead.

1381
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:11,590
Marilyn Rich, the helicopter girl,
does her stuff...

1382
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:16,930
...from one of the highest perches
ever used by an acrobat. And no net.

1383
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,560
Now U.S. jets zoom overhead.

1384
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:33,900
Watch them burst apart like a fountain.

1385
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:35,700
Red Grant is the outdoor type.

1386
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:38,990
He prefers to do his flying
on the wing despite a 30-mile wind....

1387
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,740
Traitor.

1388
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:44,790
There's a fight on l wanted to catch a bit of.
I've seen the picture anyway.

1389
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,750
Why didn't you say something?
We could've run something else.

1390
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,170
That doesn't matter.
It's a good picture. You'll all enjoy it.

1391
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:53,550
Go on back, Norman,
I think the newsreel's over.

1392
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,930
Are you feeling all right?
You haven't said a word the whole evening.

1393
01:45:57,100 --> 01:46:00,930
Sure, l'm all right.
Just one of my silent evenings.

1394
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,770
Go ahead, you'll miss the beginning.

1395
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:05,520
There's no hurry.
These credits will run forever.

1396
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:08,730
I thought you were the one
who never took the studio home with you.

1397
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,480
This is different. l'm not at home.

1398
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:17,240
Has this got anything to do with me?
What you're worrying about?

1399
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:19,030
Well, has it?

1400
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:23,290
I'll tell you all about it at the studio
on Monday. Have lunch with me.

1401
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:24,960
How about telling me now?

1402
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:28,210
This isn't the time or the place, Norman.
You have guests inside--

1403
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:32,050
Oliver, we've known each other too long
to start playing games with each other.

1404
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:35,590
What's sticking in your throat
that you can't tell me?

1405
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:44,220
The New York boys have been out here
for the past week.

1406
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:47,810
-They want me to take a salary cut?
-No, Norman.

1407
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,230
Well, l guess the only way to say it,
is to say it.

1408
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:57,820
They've instructed me to buy up
the rest of your contract.

1409
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:59,070
Pay you off.

1410
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,820
Pay me off?

1411
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:04,080
Why? My last two pictures haven't
grossed as big as they used to...

1412
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,830
...but neither has anybody else's.

1413
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,080
-They know that.
-Well, what is it, then?

1414
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:11,790
Can you take it?

1415
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,750
Go ahead.

1416
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:18,760
They can't afford you anymore, Norman.
You're too big a risk.

1417
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:22,720
Those big, fat lush days when a star
could get drunk and disappear...

1418
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:26,140
...and hold up production
for two weeks are over.

1419
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:32,610
Even if you hadn't slipped a little,
they still wouldn't take the chance.

1420
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:35,360
Your record's too bad.

1421
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:40,160
No one can afford it anymore.
Things are too tough.

1422
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:43,830
I tried, Norman.

1423
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:46,450
I tried very hard.

1424
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:49,290
I see.

1425
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:56,840
Well, don't look so miserable, Oliver.
There are other studios, you know.

1426
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:00,510
Only bad thing is
I shan't be working for you anymore.

1427
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:04,390
Well, we had a long roll of the dice,
didn't we, Oliver?

1428
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,720
Can't complain now.

1429
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,100
Hey, by the way...

1430
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:12,440
...can you keep this under wraps
for a while?

1431
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:16,020
-l'd like to tell Esther about it my own way.
-Of course.

1432
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:24,320
Have you seen this, Oliver?

1433
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:35,210
Well, l've certainly picked a fine time
to build myself a big new house, didn't I?

1434
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:40,670
You know, Oliver, l sometimes think I was
born with a genius, an absolute genius...

1435
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:43,720
...for doing the wrong thing.

1436
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:52,190
"Since Mr. Maine feels that his career
will be benefited by a change...

1437
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:56,860
...uh, we do not wish to stand
in his way," unquote.

1438
01:48:57,030 --> 01:49:00,360
When contacted, the star said that
he would announce his future plans...

1439
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:02,320
...at a later date.

1440
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:06,120
The wheel goes round and round...

1441
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,910
...and if you just wait long enough...

1442
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:12,040
...it's finally your turn.

1443
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:16,330
Don't take that down, Miss Willer,
I was just talking to myself.

1444
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,670
-Sorry.
-That's all right.

1445
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,630
I'm in the mood where you can make
more than your usual quota of mistakes.

1446
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,220
Read that whole thing back to me,
will you?

1447
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:28,140
"Oliver Niles Studio announced
this morning that it has granted...

1448
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:32,140
...Norman Maine's request
for a cancellation of his contract.

1449
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:37,150
'This step was taken with deep regret,'
said Mr. Niles, 'and marks the end...

1450
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,070
...of a long and happy relationship.'

1451
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:45,660
But since Mr. Maine feels that his career
will be benefited by a change...."

1452
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,510
Yes. This is Malibu 2-901 0.

1453
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,760
- Is Miss Lester there, please?
- No, she isn't.

1454
01:50:10,930 --> 01:50:14,230
-Who's this? The butler?
-No, this isn't the butler.

1455
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:18,560
Oh, is that you, Norman?
This is Artie Carver. How are you?

1456
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:22,110
Say, as long as l've got you on the phone,
anything new with you?

1457
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,320
Have you made a deal
at any other studio yet?

1458
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:27,660
No, nothing new with me at all, Artie.

1459
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:33,330
Say, Norman, is it true that you're trying
to get Vicki to leave the studio...

1460
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:36,290
...because you're sore at Niles
for settling your contract?

1461
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:40,130
No, it isn't true.
And don't you start that rumor going.

1462
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:43,460
Okay, Norman, don't get sore.
I was just trying to help.

1463
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:46,130
Just trying to get your name
in the papers, that's all.

1464
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:51,640
Anyway, what I called you for was
I've been trying to get an interview...

1465
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:54,770
...with Vicki for two weeks
and she's always busy.

1466
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:58,850
How about you giving an old pal a break
and speaking to her for me?

1467
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:01,480
Sure, l'll ask her, Artie.

1468
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:02,650
Fine. Fine.

1469
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:04,940
Norman, I'm gonna put a squib
in the column...

1470
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:07,530
...saying that you're cooking up
an independent deal.

1471
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:10,490
Won't fool anybody, but let them
know you're alive. Bye, now.

1472
01:51:10,910 --> 01:51:12,200
Bye.

1473
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:33,810
Hi.

1474
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:38,520
-l'm sorry to be so late.
-lt's all right.

1475
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:40,690
You're here now.

1476
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:44,440
-Did you go fishing with Captain Blythe?
-No, I haven't been out of the house.

1477
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:47,440
-No? Then let's go out someplace tonight.
-But you're tired.

1478
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:49,360
-No.
-Let's stay in. You must be tired.

1479
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:51,320
I'm not a bit tired. Really, l'm not.

1480
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:53,200
-And anyway....
-What?

1481
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:57,040
I see so little of you
that I'd rather have you to myself.

1482
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,750
I didn't even get out
of my practice costume.

1483
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,420
Oh, Norman, it's the servants' night out.
I don't think we've got--

1484
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:08,880
Oh, yes, we have. I fixed a little snack
with my own lily-white hands.

1485
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:10,180
What?

1486
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:13,510
I'm learning to cook in my spare time.

1487
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,220
Well, then l think l'll marry you.

1488
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:20,020
I get it. You wanna make
an honest cook of me.

1489
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:48,260
My goodness.

1490
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,260
How does it look?

1491
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:52,630
-lt looks wonderful.
-That's what I thought.

1492
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,930
-Sit down, sit down.
-All right.

1493
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,810
Don't be formal, just pitch in.

1494
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:12,610
I don't think my mouth is big enough.

1495
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:16,370
I'll measure it.
Make the sandwiches to size next time.

1496
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:20,790
I think I'll take the measurements
right now.

1497
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:35,180
That's what l wait for all day.

1498
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:40,270
That's why l rush home every
night without even changing my costume.

1499
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,570
We're forgetting we're hungry.

1500
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:55,660
-Milk?
-Yes, thank you.

1501
01:53:58,780 --> 01:53:59,830
Cheers.

1502
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,340
Well, what went on at the studio today,
the old alma mater?

1503
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:11,460
Well, we started doing
the big production number today.

1504
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:14,550
And this is the production number
to end all production numbers.

1505
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:17,510
-An American ln Paris?
-An American In Paris.

1506
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,510
And in Spain and--

1507
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,850
-Brazil?
-Brazil, yes.

1508
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:25,310
-And Pakistan.
-Pakistan and Burma Road.

1509
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:28,860
-lt's got sex and schmaltz and--
-And patriotism.

1510
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,730
Patriotism without end. You should see
the things that come out of the ground...

1511
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:36,820
...and that come down from the ceiling.
Never seen anything like it in your life.

1512
01:54:36,990 --> 01:54:41,910
Wait a minute. Wait. Here, l'll put
the practice record on and show you.

1513
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,220
Lights.

1514
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:02,720
Camera.

1515
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:07,520
Action.

1516
01:55:11,730 --> 01:55:15,940
I'm discovered sitting
on a rather simple divan.

1517
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:21,410
Somewhere there's a someone

1518
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:25,790
Who's the someone for me

1519
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,290
Someday there will come one

1520
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:33,920
And my lover he will be

1521
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:37,300
Somehow l shall know him

1522
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:41,300
From the moment he's in view

1523
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:43,720
And he'll know affection

1524
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:47,390
He's never known hitherto

1525
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:49,560
Now we have a stunning shot
with a clock.

1526
01:55:49,730 --> 01:55:53,270
I pay no mind to the waiting

1527
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:57,240
Let the clock ticktock away

1528
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,280
The dream l'm contemplating

1529
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:04,160
-Will be here to stay
-Oop!

1530
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:09,080
Oh, somewhere in the sometime

1531
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:10,330
When the humdrum--

1532
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:13,250
You know,
I got pretty girlish in this number.

1533
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:15,040
With that someone

1534
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:20,470
I'll be someone at last

1535
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:22,760
Now here comes a big, fat close-up.

1536
01:56:22,930 --> 01:56:25,720
With my someone

1537
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:29,430
I'll be someone

1538
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:34,650
At last

1539
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,070
-Not a harp.
-There's always a harp...

1540
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:42,780
...in a dream sequence, don't be silly.

1541
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,530
-The heavenly choir?
-Yeah, 20 girls just came up...

1542
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:50,250
...out of the floor.
And there's smoke all over the room.

1543
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:53,670
Where there's a someone

1544
01:56:53,830 --> 01:56:56,170
Somewhere there's a someone

1545
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:58,510
Somewhere, someone

1546
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:00,970
Somewhere there's a someone

1547
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:03,180
I'm discovered on top of the Eiffel Tower.

1548
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,510
Of course.

1549
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:58,360
This is the story of a little girl.

1550
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:02,780
Searching, searching, searching.

1551
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:04,860
For she knows somewhere...

1552
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:09,910
...is a someone who is a someone
for her.

1553
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,580
This is her story.

1554
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:15,370
Somewhere is a sometime

1555
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:19,590
When the humdrum days have passed

1556
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:21,880
With my someone

1557
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:28,430
I'll be someone at last

1558
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,720
With my someone

1559
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:33,770
I'll be someone

1560
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:37,270
At last

1561
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:41,440
They discover me in China too.

1562
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:07,300
Somewhere she will find him somewhere

1563
01:59:07,470 --> 01:59:09,970
Somewhere she will find him

1564
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,640
Nowhere

1565
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:32,910
Africa.

1566
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,720
Someone

1567
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:01,190
Somewhere

1568
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,860
There's a someone somewhere

1569
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:07,940
Someone, somewhere

1570
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:14,200
-Brazil, l told you.
-Right. Brazil it is.

1571
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,300
Shoot.

1572
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,630
Bing. Boom.

1573
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,430
You're dead.

1574
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:15,390
Somewhere there's a someone

1575
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:18,060
Somewhere there's a someone

1576
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:25,230
There's a someone waiting for me

1577
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:36,030
That's the doorbell.

1578
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:37,450
Maybe they'll go away.

1579
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:40,080
They never do at a time like this.

1580
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:43,790
Don't answer it.

1581
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:47,040
Darling, it's so good
to hear you laughing.

1582
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:49,630
I know, I know.

1583
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:55,640
I'd better. Might be a cable.

1584
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:58,260
I sent one to Alex Korda
about a picture in England.

1585
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:00,680
I've been expecting an answer.

1586
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,850
Maybe things are looking up.

1587
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:16,910
Vicki Lester live here?
I got a package for her.

1588
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:19,330
-l'll sign for it.
-Who are you?

1589
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,200
I'm her husband.

1590
02:02:21,370 --> 02:02:24,000
Sure. Sign right there, Mr. Lester.

1591
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:31,300
Thank you.

1592
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:58,320
Package for you.

1593
02:02:58,490 --> 02:02:59,950
Oh?

1594
02:03:00,450 --> 02:03:02,700
By the way,
I forgot to tell you, they want you...

1595
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:05,370
...for the Motion Picture
Relief Fund benefit.

1596
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:07,710
It's in April sometime.
I told them I'd ask you.

1597
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,590
-Now, darling--
-No, no, no, let me finish before l forget.

1598
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,500
The Academy Award secretary called...

1599
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:15,210
...and wanted to know how many
there'd be in your party.

1600
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:19,140
And Art Carver called and wanted me
to use my influence with you...

1601
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:22,760
...to get him an interview.
I told him I'd try.

1602
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:25,020
That's all.

1603
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:32,060
Well, now that the supper show is over,
let's have some supper, shall we?

1604
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:36,030
I think I shall mix myself a drink.
I'm not very hungry.

1605
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:37,820
No.

1606
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:14,860
My young son asked me
if these Oscars were made of real gold.

1607
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:18,780
I had to be truthful and tell him,
no, they weren't.

1608
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:21,740
He was very disappointed.

1609
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:25,620
And then the pride
of the household said:

1610
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:28,910
"Daddy, why is it called an Oscar?"

1611
02:04:29,710 --> 02:04:32,460
"Shut up," l explained.

1612
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:37,130
And then my dear wife
entered the argument...

1613
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:40,470
...with a little lecture
on child psychology.

1614
02:04:40,630 --> 02:04:44,470
And it's rather lucky
that I'm here at all tonight.

1615
02:04:44,930 --> 02:04:47,060
You don't think anything's happened,
do you?

1616
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:50,640
You know what the traffic's like.
He's been held up, that's all.

1617
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:53,060
Oh, I wish I could've
made him understand that...

1618
02:04:53,730 --> 02:05:00,360
...many of us feel that to win one of them
is ample reward for an entire career.

1619
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:02,110
I know l do.

1620
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,950
Thank you.

1621
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:18,170
Now, to present this year's award
for the Best Actress--

1622
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:22,010
Stop worrying. Think how nice that
statuette's gonna look on your mantelpiece.

1623
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:26,600
--last year's Academy Award winner,
Mr. Nigel Peters.

1624
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:37,610
Those nominated for
the Best Performance by an Actress are:

1625
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:41,490
Jane Brandon, Those Who Seek.

1626
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:44,030
Vicki Lester, A World For Two.

1627
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:48,030
Alice Tenny, The Great Chance.

1628
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:52,080
Shirley Vander, Don't Cry, My Love.

1629
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,350
The winner is...

1630
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,850
...Miss Vicki Lester.

1631
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:30,370
Oh, l wish Norman were here.

1632
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:55,940
When something like this
happens to you--

1633
02:06:56,100 --> 02:07:00,980
I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you
I didn't keep hoping it would happen.

1634
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:06,320
--all the speeches that you've made up
in your bedroom or in the bathtub...

1635
02:07:06,490 --> 02:07:08,570
...go out of your mind completely.

1636
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:13,490
And you find that out of all the words
in the world...

1637
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:17,290
...just two stick in your mind:

1638
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:18,500
Thank you.

1639
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:23,210
And all l can do is to say them to you
from my heart and--

1640
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:28,220
And--

1641
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:35,140
Shh.

1642
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:59,870
Congratulations, my dear.
I made it just in time, didn't I?

1643
02:08:02,630 --> 02:08:06,630
May I borrow the end of your speech
to make a speech of my own?

1644
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:15,930
My method for gaining your attention
may seem a little unconventional, but...

1645
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:19,600
...hard times call for harsh measures.

1646
02:08:22,150 --> 02:08:25,900
My, l had my speech all prepared, but I....

1647
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:28,280
It's gone right out of my head.

1648
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:30,240
Let me see.

1649
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:35,830
Why, it's silly to be so formal, isn't it?

1650
02:08:40,370 --> 02:08:44,670
I know most of you sitting out there
by your first names, don't I?

1651
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:51,130
I made a lot of money for you, gentlemen,
in my time through the years, haven't I?

1652
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:56,010
Well, l need a job now.

1653
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:59,930
Yeah, that's it, that's the speech.
That's the....

1654
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:02,230
I need a job.

1655
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,560
That's what l wanted to say. I....

1656
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:07,520
I need a job.

1657
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:09,940
It's as simple as that. l....

1658
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:12,910
I need a job, that's all.

1659
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:17,580
My talents, l may say,
are not confined to dramatic parts.

1660
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:20,540
I can play comedy too.

1661
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:22,120
Yes.

1662
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:24,880
Well, play something, somebody.

1663
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:29,880
Norman, darling.

1664
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:31,880
Darling.

1665
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:35,720
Let's sit down. Come on.

1666
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:37,390
Come on.

1667
02:10:01,330 --> 02:10:03,500
Get me a drink, somebody.

1668
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,340
Morning, Vicki.

1669
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:11,300
- Hi, Frank.
- How are you?

1670
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,590
Fine.

1671
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:15,220
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, any time.

1672
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:18,180
Hit the lights. Up high. Six and eight.

1673
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:20,140
Give us the scene. Lee?

1674
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:22,810
Come over to 1 03, will you?

1675
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:25,230
Now, drop that door down on main.

1676
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,480
Quiet, now!

1677
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:31,070
-Quiet!
-Roll them!

1678
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:33,440
-Speed!
-Playback! Come on.

1679
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:37,570
One, two.

1680
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:51,170
If, as, and when you've got a long face

1681
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:53,800
Rearrange it

1682
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:57,930
Don't be contented with the wrong face

1683
02:10:58,090 --> 02:11:02,180
There's a way to change it

1684
02:11:05,770 --> 02:11:08,520
Does the day look painful?

1685
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:11,190
The future glum?

1686
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,900
Does the sky look rainful?

1687
02:11:14,070 --> 02:11:16,610
Hey there
Say there

1688
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:18,860
Are you in a vacuum?

1689
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:26,120
All this stuff and nonsense

1690
02:11:26,410 --> 02:11:28,830
You can overcome

1691
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,250
A long face gets you nowhere

1692
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:36,220
You lose that month of May

1693
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:41,640
Like Peter Pan
The sweeter pan

1694
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:47,480
Wins the day

1695
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:52,820
Go lose that long face
That long face

1696
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:56,940
Go along and get that long face lost

1697
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:01,450
The blues black out when they can see

1698
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:05,410
A smile that says
"Move on. No vacancy"

1699
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:09,790
This panacea idea

1700
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:14,290
I'm handing you without any cost

1701
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:17,260
There isn't any tax on it

1702
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:19,090
So just relax on it

1703
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:22,850
If you want trouble double-crossed

1704
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:25,140
Don't give in to a frown

1705
02:12:25,310 --> 02:12:27,600
Turn that frown upside down

1706
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:30,890
And get yourself that long face lost

1707
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:51,560
-Hey!
-This panacea idea

1708
02:13:51,730 --> 02:13:56,060
I'm handing you without any cost

1709
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:58,730
There isn't any tax on it

1710
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:00,530
So just relax on it

1711
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:04,400
If you want trouble double-crossed

1712
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:09,490
Don't give in to a frown

1713
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:15,040
Turn that frown upside down

1714
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:17,880
And go and get your long face

1715
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:19,840
Get your long face

1716
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,050
Go, go, go and get your long face

1717
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:29,560
Lost

1718
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:31,560
Cut.

1719
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:33,230
Cut. That's it.

1720
02:14:33,390 --> 02:14:36,020
Very good, everybody. Very good.
Fine, Vicki, fine.

1721
02:14:36,190 --> 02:14:39,730
Take it easy for a bit. We've got to
move in for the closer angle, okay?

1722
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:42,320
- All right.
- All right, kids, take five.

1723
02:14:42,490 --> 02:14:45,240
- Back to school.
- New mark for the camera.

1724
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:50,120
Come in.

1725
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,120
- Oliver.
- Esther.

1726
02:14:55,290 --> 02:14:58,920
Hello. It's good to see you again.

1727
02:14:59,090 --> 02:15:01,130
Three months is a long time.

1728
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:04,380
-How was your trip?
-Not exactly the pleasure trip it used to be.

1729
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:06,010
They want your pictures, Esther.

1730
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:08,840
That's all l kept hearing
way across the country.

1731
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:10,640
Thanks.

1732
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:15,100
Look, would you mind stopping that
for just a minute? Excuse me.

1733
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:16,270
-All right.
-Excuse me.

1734
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:17,940
Tough day?

1735
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:20,980
Oh, no, no tougher than usual.

1736
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:24,280
Maybe you ought to get away
after this one. New York or Europe.

1737
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:27,650
Just get completely away.
What about that?

1738
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:30,410
How's Norman?

1739
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:36,500
Is he all right?

1740
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:38,920
Yes, he's fine. Want some coffee?

1741
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:40,880
-Thanks.
-Here.

1742
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:44,460
-Sit down, Oliver.
-Tell me, is he...?

1743
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,970
He's in the sanitarium.

1744
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:51,600
He really wants to stop drinking, Oliver.

1745
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:55,270
He's trying very hard. l know he is.

1746
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:56,930
But....

1747
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:03,110
What is it?

1748
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:07,490
What is it that makes him
wanna destroy himself?

1749
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:11,280
You've known him longer
than anyone else.

1750
02:16:11,450 --> 02:16:13,700
Tell me what it is.

1751
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:17,330
Please. I don't care, just tell me.

1752
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:20,330
Don't you think l've tried
through the years to know why?

1753
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,750
To help him?

1754
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:23,380
I don't know, Esther.

1755
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:26,130
I don't know what the answer is.

1756
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:31,720
Well, l've got to find the answer.

1757
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:36,850
You don't know what it's like
to watch somebody you love...

1758
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:39,640
...just crumble away, bit by bit...

1759
02:16:39,810 --> 02:16:43,940
...and day by day in front of your eyes.

1760
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:47,440
And stand there helpless.

1761
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,740
Love isn't enough.

1762
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:53,530
I thought it was.

1763
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:57,450
I thought I was the answer for Norman.

1764
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:01,710
But love isn't enough for him.

1765
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:07,500
And l'm afraid of what's beginning
to happen...

1766
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:10,050
...within me.

1767
02:17:11,010 --> 02:17:12,510
Because...

1768
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,720
...sometimes l hate him.

1769
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:24,350
I hate his promises to stop...

1770
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:29,070
...and then the watching and waiting
to see it begin again.

1771
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:33,910
I hate to go home to him at night.

1772
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,240
And listen to his lies.

1773
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:39,490
Well, my heart goes out to him
because he tries.

1774
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:42,960
He does try.

1775
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:45,580
But l...

1776
02:17:46,290 --> 02:17:48,250
...hate him for failing.

1777
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:50,260
I hate me too.

1778
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:53,090
I hate me...

1779
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:56,550
...because I've failed too.

1780
02:17:57,430 --> 02:17:59,260
I have.

1781
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:06,060
I don't know what's going
to happen to us, Oliver.

1782
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:08,480
No matter...

1783
02:18:10,650 --> 02:18:13,610
...how much you love somebody...

1784
02:18:14,450 --> 02:18:17,450
...how do you live out the days?

1785
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:19,330
How?

1786
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:28,630
Would it help any
if he went back to work?

1787
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:32,880
Oliver, could you--?

1788
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:34,970
Could you do that?

1789
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:36,970
I'll try.

1790
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:41,260
-Yeah, all right. I'll be there.
-Two minutes.

1791
02:18:41,430 --> 02:18:42,970
Yes, okay.

1792
02:18:45,650 --> 02:18:47,270
Oliver.

1793
02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:53,570
You will be careful when you talk to him,
won't you?

1794
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:55,400
You know...

1795
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:01,200
...all he's got left is his pride--
Is his pride.

1796
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:05,620
Quiet.

1797
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:07,830
- Hurry it up.
- Set up for number six.

1798
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Playback.

1799
02:19:09,170 --> 02:19:10,460
Get ready, number six, make that happen.

1800
02:19:10,630 --> 02:19:12,210
Quiet, everybody.

1801
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:13,920
- -any tax on it

1802
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:15,840
So just relax on it

1803
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:19,680
If you want trouble double-crossed

1804
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:24,640
Don't give in to a frown

1805
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:30,230
- Turn that frown upside down
- Hey

1806
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:33,070
And go and get your long face

1807
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:34,940
Get your long face

1808
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:39,240
Go, go, go and get your long face

1809
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:44,830
Lost

1810
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:53,840
-l'm Mr. Niles.
-Oh, yes, come in.

1811
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,720
Well, Mr. Niles, we're expecting you.
My name is Harrison.

1812
02:20:00,890 --> 02:20:03,050
-How do you do?
-Come into the reception room...

1813
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:05,560
...make yourself comfortable.
Mr. Maine'll be down.

1814
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:07,270
Thank you.

1815
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:37,510
Hello, Oliver.

1816
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:40,720
-Welcome to Liberty Hall.
-Hello, Norman.

1817
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:44,720
Shall we...? Hm.
Shall we go through there?

1818
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,940
Sit down.

1819
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:56,020
You don't think someone'll come
strolling in...

1820
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:59,740
...and start telling us he's Napoleon
or Julius Caesar, do you?

1821
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,740
No.

1822
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:07,080
Nevertheless, I think we'd find it
a little cozier in the sun porch.

1823
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:16,460
Now, Cuddles, Mr. Niles isn't
slipping me a case of Scotch.

1824
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:18,960
He's just gonna sit with me.

1825
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:23,390
Oliver, this is Cuddles,
my social secretary.

1826
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:25,850
We go everywhere together.

1827
02:21:27,010 --> 02:21:28,100
How are you feeling?

1828
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:31,310
Oh, l'm coming along splendidly,
so Cuddles tells me.

1829
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:34,150
He says you ought to see
some of the boys.

1830
02:21:34,310 --> 02:21:35,860
Well, let's sit down.

1831
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:38,610
Cuddles, we really don't need you.

1832
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:46,660
Touching, isn't it?
He can't bear to have me out of his sight.

1833
02:21:46,830 --> 02:21:48,910
Well, you comfortable here?

1834
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:52,710
Comfortable?
Why, it's positively luxurious.

1835
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:57,710
Why, we even have steel mesh
on the windows to keep the drafts out.

1836
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:59,880
How much longer
do you think you'll be here?

1837
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:02,800
Well, l'm really cured now,
only l'm just staying on...

1838
02:22:02,970 --> 02:22:05,930
...an extra week or two
until I get into really good shape.

1839
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:10,350
After all, there isn't any great hurry
to return to the cameras.

1840
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,850
That's what l wanna talk to you about.

1841
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:14,190
I have a script here.

1842
02:22:14,350 --> 02:22:16,900
It has a fine part for you in it.

1843
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:26,490
Why, that's great, Oliver.

1844
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:28,910
Who plays opposite me?

1845
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:32,700
Well, it isn't exactly the lead, Norman.
Young Pemberton's doing that.

1846
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:36,170
But l'll tell you frankly,
I consider your part better than the lead.

1847
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:38,750
I see. Better than the lead.

1848
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:42,800
Of course, it isn't terribly long. lt's one
of those parts that make an impression.

1849
02:22:42,970 --> 02:22:45,800
They'll be thinking about you
all through the picture.

1850
02:22:48,390 --> 02:22:52,140
Well, the thing is, Oliver,
that I'm pretty well set at another studio.

1851
02:22:52,310 --> 02:22:54,850
I'm not at liberty at the moment
to tell you which one.

1852
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:58,900
You know yourself how those things are,
but it's big. Big.

1853
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:01,020
It's-- Cuddles, do you have a quarter?

1854
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:05,360
It's one of the biggest pictures of the year.
As for the part, every actor in Hollywood...

1855
02:23:05,530 --> 02:23:10,030
-...would give his eyeteeth to play it.
-That's fine, Norman. Just fine.

1856
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:13,830
Naturally, that'll tie you up for a while.

1857
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:17,420
However, we're not getting to this
for some time.

1858
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:20,590
-Perhaps you'd consider it for later on.
-Better not count on me.

1859
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:24,090
I've got several pictures lined up.
They're talking to me about England.

1860
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:26,340
-They're doing some interesting things--
-Hey.

1861
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:28,300
What is it, Cuddles?

1862
02:23:28,470 --> 02:23:31,720
-Speak right out. We all love you.
-Your dinner.

1863
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:33,310
Oh, yes.

1864
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:37,560
We dine here at 5:30.
Makes the nights longer.

1865
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:40,650
Well, l'll be toddling along, Norman.

1866
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:43,270
Supposing l just leave this.

1867
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,650
Maybe you'll come up with some ideas,
even if you don't play the part.

1868
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:49,780
Oh, sure. Sure.

1869
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,950
Nice to see you doing so well, Norman.

1870
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:58,790
Oh, l shall be out of here in no time.

1871
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:02,380
I shall have to introduce myself
all over again to a lot of people.

1872
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:04,960
They won't know me
when l'm not drinking.

1873
02:24:05,130 --> 02:24:06,920
Goodbye, Oliver.

1874
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:13,510
Thanks for dropping in.

1875
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:28,030
All right, Cuddles.

1876
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:30,700
Alone at last.

1877
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:46,210
Your attention, please.

1878
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:51,090
ln this race, Number 5, La Golondrina,
three pounds over.

1879
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:55,010
The total weight, 1 1 2 pounds.

1880
02:24:55,930 --> 02:25:00,270
Number 7, Royalty, two pounds over.

1881
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:04,360
The total weight, 1 1 4 pounds.

1882
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,360
Well, hello, Bert.

1883
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:07,730
Oh, hello, Norman.

1884
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:09,530
-Marian, how are you?
-Fine, fine.

1885
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:13,200
-Hi, Sammy.
-Hello, Norman. How are you?

1886
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:14,870
I think this one.

1887
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:16,200
Yes.

1888
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:19,120
After all, he's never won before.
Give him a chance.

1889
02:25:19,290 --> 02:25:20,870
Well....

1890
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:25,000
Your attention, please.
The horses are coming on the track.

1891
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:27,800
Hello, Mr. Maine.
Haven't seen you around in a long time.

1892
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:30,050
No, I've been resting. Ginger ale, please.

1893
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:31,970
Yes, sir. Ginger ale and what?

1894
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:34,430
Ginger ale and ginger ale.

1895
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:37,850
-New leaf?
-A whole new book.

1896
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:40,730
Thanks.

1897
02:25:40,890 --> 02:25:42,810
Scotch.

1898
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:45,690
Hello, Libby.
Haven't seen you in a long time.

1899
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:50,030
-What do you like in the third race?
-Well, it's Mr. America of Yesteryear.

1900
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:52,780
Do they let you wander around now
without a keeper?

1901
02:25:52,950 --> 02:25:55,200
Oh, l'm a trusty, now.

1902
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:58,580
I suppose you'll be here all the time
now that you've retired...

1903
02:25:58,740 --> 02:26:02,540
...from the hurly-burly of the silver screen.
Another Scotch.

1904
02:26:02,710 --> 02:26:05,630
We're staying down at Malibu now
and it gets pretty lonesome...

1905
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:09,590
-...with Esther away working all day.
-l wouldn't squawk if l were you.

1906
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,340
It's nice having somebody in the family
making a living.

1907
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:16,140
Hey, go a little slow, Libby.
I don't wanna forget that we're friends.

1908
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:17,760
Friends, my eye.

1909
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:20,430
Listen, l got you out of your jams...

1910
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:23,350
...because it was my job,
not because l was your friend.

1911
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:26,270
I don't like you. I never did like you.

1912
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:29,770
Nothing made me happier than to see
all those little pranks of yours...

1913
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:32,110
...catch up with you
and land you on your face.

1914
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:35,360
Pretty work, Libby. Always wait till
they're down, then kick them.

1915
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:38,910
You got yourself fixed nice
and comfortable, you got no complaint.

1916
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:41,660
You can live off your wife now.

1917
02:26:50,300 --> 02:26:51,750
Stand back, folks.

1918
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,800
Stand back, folks.
What's the matter with him?

1919
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:03,640
Are you hurt? Oh, he's all right.

1920
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:10,900
-lt's Norman Maine.
-Drunk again.

1921
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:14,240
He's been drunk for years.
Come on, honey, we'll miss the next race.

1922
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:16,990
- How does Vicki stand him?
- She must feel sorry for him.

1923
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:19,570
Let's not us get involved.

1924
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:23,830
Scotch.

1925
02:27:24,580 --> 02:27:26,160
Double.

1926
02:27:58,910 --> 02:28:01,370
Esther, you'll make yourself ill.

1927
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:03,280
Try and get a little sleep.

1928
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:06,830
Four days. He's been gone
for four days now and not a word.

1929
02:28:15,170 --> 02:28:19,260
I can't.

1930
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:23,550
Hello?

1931
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:26,020
No, this is Oliver Niles speaking.

1932
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:27,730
What?

1933
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:29,940
Oh, thank heaven.

1934
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:32,730
He's all right. He's all right, Esther.
He isn't hurt.

1935
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,070
Where?

1936
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:37,190
In the night court? Thank you.

1937
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:40,200
He's been arrested on a drunk charge.

1938
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:43,660
I'll go right down
and try and get him out.

1939
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:45,120
I'm going with you.

1940
02:28:45,290 --> 02:28:48,330
That's no place for you.
If the newspapers get it, it'll be bad--

1941
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:51,170
What do I care about that now?

1942
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:23,610
Were you able to do anything?

1943
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:26,870
The judge says he'll get as fair treatment
as anybody else.

1944
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:29,290
And that's all he'd say.

1945
02:29:35,670 --> 02:29:38,630
Cigarettes out. Please rise.

1946
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:40,800
Face the flag of our country.

1947
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:45,050
Come on, keep moving.

1948
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:50,560
Line up here.

1949
02:29:50,730 --> 02:29:53,350
Come on, come on, line up.

1950
02:29:58,530 --> 02:30:01,490
All right, fellows, let's go.
Come on. Right down there.

1951
02:30:01,650 --> 02:30:04,820
Hats off, cigarettes out.
Hurry it up, come on.

1952
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:09,700
Come on, hurry up. Come on, come on.
Hurry it up. Single file line, face the judge.

1953
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,500
Face the judge. Hurry it up.

1954
02:30:13,670 --> 02:30:15,630
Second line right down there.

1955
02:30:15,790 --> 02:30:17,590
Single file.

1956
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,550
Hurry it up.

1957
02:30:19,710 --> 02:30:21,550
Take your hat off.

1958
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,630
Hurry it up, fellows.

1959
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:26,180
Take your hat off. Come on, go. Hat off.

1960
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:27,890
Come on. Hurry it up, fellows.

1961
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:32,100
I want to advise you that you're
entitled to be represented by counsel...

1962
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:34,850
...to be confronted
by the witnesses that testify...

1963
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:38,190
...to a public and speedy trial
by the court or by a jury...

1964
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:40,480
...and the right to be admitted to bail.

1965
02:30:40,650 --> 02:30:42,530
-Do you understand that?
-Yes.

1966
02:30:42,690 --> 02:30:44,320
William Gregory.

1967
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:47,110
Drunk. Picked up at Fifth
and Towne asleep in the gutter.

1968
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:49,830
Fourteen similar offenses
in the past six months.

1969
02:30:50,290 --> 02:30:52,200
How do you plead?

1970
02:30:52,370 --> 02:30:53,870
I don't feel so good.

1971
02:30:54,040 --> 02:30:56,830
I didn't ask you how you feel.
I said how do you plead?

1972
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,380
Guilty, l guess.

1973
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:00,710
When did you get out the last time?

1974
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:02,050
Just before Christmas.

1975
02:31:03,130 --> 02:31:05,550
You'll have to miss New Year's,
but you'll be out...

1976
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:09,100
...in time for Washington's birthday.
Sixty days.

1977
02:31:11,970 --> 02:31:14,350
Ernest Gubbins.

1978
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:16,640
Gubbins.

1979
02:31:16,810 --> 02:31:20,150
Drunk and disorderly. Crashed car
into tree at Sunset and Coronado.

1980
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:21,900
Evidently been drinking for days.

1981
02:31:22,070 --> 02:31:25,570
Resisted arrest and injured
one of the arresting officers.

1982
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:27,280
How do you plead?

1983
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:29,200
Guilty.

1984
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:33,040
Were you Norman Maine, the actor?

1985
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:34,750
Yes.

1986
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:38,670
You've come pretty low, haven't you?

1987
02:31:38,830 --> 02:31:41,590
There isn't a man here
that's had the advantages you've had.

1988
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:43,590
And look what you've done with them.

1989
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:48,630
You're nothing but an irresponsible drunk
driving around the streets...

1990
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:52,600
...with the power to inflict death
and injury on innocent people.

1991
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:58,390
I think we'd better deny you that power
for a while. Ninety days in the city jail.

1992
02:32:07,070 --> 02:32:08,360
I'm his wife.

1993
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:10,780
I recognize you, Miss Lester.

1994
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:15,160
Please, judge, l promise...

1995
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:19,500
...this will never, never happen again.

1996
02:32:19,670 --> 02:32:22,130
I'll be responsible for him.

1997
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:24,050
I will.

1998
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:28,420
If you'll just not send him there.

1999
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:30,800
Do you realize that this man,
when drunk...

2000
02:32:30,970 --> 02:32:33,220
...is obviously a menace
to the public's safety?

2001
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:40,140
Do you realize, too, the responsibility
you'll be assuming in this, to the court...

2002
02:32:40,310 --> 02:32:42,060
...and to the people of this city?

2003
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:44,150
I do.

2004
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,490
Sentence suspended.
Prisoner remanded to custody of wife.

2005
02:32:56,830 --> 02:32:58,540
Thank you.

2006
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:07,090
Jose Rodriguez.

2007
02:33:55,970 --> 02:33:59,470
- l'm so tired, Esther.
- All right, folks, hold it.

2008
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:01,310
Hold it.

2009
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:05,150
- One more, please.
- Just a minute.

2010
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:59,450
-He's asleep.
-Good.

2011
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:01,240
He's been sleeping most of the day.

2012
02:35:01,410 --> 02:35:03,750
-That's the best thing for him.
-Yes.

2013
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:10,670
He looks so helpless lying there.

2014
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:16,130
Smiling in his sleep, just like a child.

2015
02:35:20,180 --> 02:35:23,430
Do you still love him, Esther?
Or do you feel sorry for him?

2016
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:27,690
Sorry for him?

2017
02:35:27,850 --> 02:35:30,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

2018
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:33,320
I love him.

2019
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:36,070
We'll take care of him together.

2020
02:35:37,490 --> 02:35:39,530
You are very fond of him,
aren't you, Oliver?

2021
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:42,080
I'm very fond of both of you.

2022
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:47,500
Then I know you'll understand
what I have to tell you.

2023
02:35:48,750 --> 02:35:52,500
You probably know already,
after what happened last night.

2024
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:57,010
I can't do any more pictures, Oliver.

2025
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:00,340
I'm going away for good.

2026
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,470
With Norman.

2027
02:36:03,810 --> 02:36:06,520
You're at the very height
of your career, Esther.

2028
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:09,270
The very peak of your success.

2029
02:36:09,810 --> 02:36:12,610
There wouldn't be any career
without Norman.

2030
02:36:13,230 --> 02:36:15,860
I'm just giving back the gift he gave me.

2031
02:36:16,030 --> 02:36:19,030
No one can give anyone a career.
You've made your own.

2032
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:21,450
No, no.

2033
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:23,530
He gave it to me...

2034
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:28,120
...by his faith and by his love.

2035
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:31,790
And without him, it's just nothing.

2036
02:36:32,210 --> 02:36:34,670
Not the way things are.

2037
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:36,880
-You've thought this through?
-Mm-hm.

2038
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:38,880
You're sure you're right?

2039
02:36:39,050 --> 02:36:40,890
What'll you do?

2040
02:36:41,180 --> 02:36:44,640
Well, we'll go away together.

2041
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:47,890
I'll be with him every moment.

2042
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:50,560
Maybe if l'd had a chance
to be with him more...

2043
02:36:50,730 --> 02:36:53,560
...some of these things
wouldn't have happened.

2044
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:57,650
I've got to hang onto that.

2045
02:36:57,990 --> 02:36:59,990
I've got to believe that.

2046
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:03,240
And then when he gets better...

2047
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:07,490
...we can work in England or ltaly.

2048
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:14,420
Somewhere where they don't know
about him the way they do here.

2049
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:20,260
And he can get a chance to start again.
That's all he needs.

2050
02:37:20,590 --> 02:37:22,840
That's what l'm willing to fight for.

2051
02:37:23,010 --> 02:37:25,470
To give anything for.

2052
02:37:26,220 --> 02:37:27,850
Esther...

2053
02:37:28,730 --> 02:37:30,640
...l have to tell you this.

2054
02:37:30,810 --> 02:37:33,100
I hate to, but l must.

2055
02:37:33,690 --> 02:37:35,060
There's nothing left anymore.

2056
02:37:36,610 --> 02:37:41,650
It happened long before last night.
Long before we let him out of the studio.

2057
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:46,950
Twenty years of steady and quiet drinking
do something to a man.

2058
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:50,620
Long before it showed in his face,
it showed in his acting.

2059
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:54,710
Little by little, more and more,
with each picture.

2060
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,500
That's why he slipped.

2061
02:37:56,670 --> 02:37:59,630
It wasn't just bad pictures, it was him.

2062
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:02,800
And there's nothing left anymore.

2063
02:38:02,970 --> 02:38:06,140
He's just the shell of what he once was.
It's gone, Esther.

2064
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:11,770
No. No, Oliver, I don't believe that.
I won't and l can't.

2065
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:18,020
Can you honestly tell me
I'm wrong to do this?

2066
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:21,650
To try? To try?

2067
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:25,950
No, my dear, I can't.
I can't honestly tell you that.

2068
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:28,780
Well, then it's settled.

2069
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,250
It's settled.

2070
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:34,710
I'll arrange it.

2071
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:38,500
Bye, Vicki Lester.

2072
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:43,670
Good luck, Mrs. Norman Maine.

2073
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:48,140
Goodbye, Oliver. Thank you.

2074
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:57,980
Darling.

2075
02:41:02,730 --> 02:41:04,480
You're up.

2076
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:11,990
Well, ifjust being on my feet creates such
a sensation, I shall never lie down again.

2077
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:14,280
-How do you feel?
-Great.

2078
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:16,330
As fit as a fiddle and ready for love.

2079
02:41:16,490 --> 02:41:20,160
Why being as fit as a fiddle should make
one ready for love l never understood.

2080
02:41:20,330 --> 02:41:22,210
How did they decide
that a fiddle was fit?

2081
02:41:23,710 --> 02:41:26,840
Norman, is there anything l can do
for you? Is there anything you want?

2082
02:41:27,010 --> 02:41:28,420
Yes. A number of things.

2083
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:29,720
Name them, what?

2084
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:32,800
Well, brace yourself.

2085
02:41:32,970 --> 02:41:36,430
-l've decided that we're dreary people.
-Us?

2086
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:41,640
Yes, both of us. l should like to see
some changes around the house.

2087
02:41:43,190 --> 02:41:46,690
-When did you decide all this?
-Oh, never mind about that. Just you listen.

2088
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:49,400
In the first place,
I'm going in for the athletic stuff.

2089
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:52,820
The swim before breakfast,
the swim before dinner, the happy mind...

2090
02:41:52,990 --> 02:41:54,910
...and a happy body. Beginning now.

2091
02:41:55,070 --> 02:41:57,030
Do you wanna come along?

2092
02:41:57,740 --> 02:42:01,540
-Must I?
-No. Your part begins when I come out.

2093
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:04,250
I shall want some hot soup
and sandwiches.

2094
02:42:04,420 --> 02:42:06,040
All right.

2095
02:42:07,050 --> 02:42:10,050
But the thing that l should like more
than anything else....

2096
02:42:10,220 --> 02:42:11,760
What?

2097
02:42:12,970 --> 02:42:16,300
I'd like some singing around the house.
We used to have it all the time.

2098
02:42:16,470 --> 02:42:18,560
Do I still own the copyright?

2099
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:22,230
Yes, including the Scandinavian.

2100
02:42:23,350 --> 02:42:24,600
What, do you want it now?

2101
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:26,060
Uh-huh.

2102
02:42:26,650 --> 02:42:28,400
Okay.

2103
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:31,570
Oh, now, don't be silly.
You go for your swim.

2104
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:35,740
I'll open the kitchen window.
You'll be able to hear me.

2105
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:39,620
-Hey.
-What?

2106
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:45,750
I just wanted to look at you again.

2107
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:18,370
It's a new world I see

2108
02:43:20,330 --> 02:43:27,330
A new world for me

2109
02:43:29,090 --> 02:43:36,090
The tears have rolled off my cheek

2110
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:41,970
And fears fade away

2111
02:43:42,140 --> 02:43:48,150
Every time you speak

2112
02:43:49,190 --> 02:43:51,520
A new world

2113
02:43:51,690 --> 02:43:58,450
Though we're in a tiny room

2114
02:43:59,320 --> 02:44:03,160
What a vision of joy

2115
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:08,370
And blossom and bloom

2116
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:14,210
A newfound promise

2117
02:44:15,090 --> 02:44:18,340
One that will last

2118
02:44:18,510 --> 02:44:22,680
So I'm holding on

2119
02:44:23,770 --> 02:44:30,730
And l'm holding fast

2120
02:44:31,690 --> 02:44:34,480
You've brought

2121
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:40,240
A new world

2122
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:45,200
To me

2123
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:51,830
And that it'll always

2124
02:44:52,750 --> 02:44:59,760
Always be

2125
02:45:03,930 --> 02:45:07,140
Yes, it is tragic. It's very tragic.

2126
02:45:07,310 --> 02:45:09,730
It was just an accident, of course.

2127
02:45:09,890 --> 02:45:11,810
We had big plans for him.

2128
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:14,230
-He was set for a comeback.
-l'll send this out.

2129
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:15,400
-Right.
-lt's for you.

2130
02:45:15,570 --> 02:45:17,230
Thank you.

2131
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:18,990
Have Joe take it.

2132
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:20,610
Yes?

2133
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:24,910
Oh, yes, it was very sad.
It was a great personal loss to everybody.

2134
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:29,910
Huh? No exclusive on Miss Lester.
She can't see anybody anyhow.

2135
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:34,460
Is Maury back yet?
Have him come right in, will you, please?

2136
02:45:34,630 --> 02:45:37,750
The Herald Express wants a front-page
spread. Get the old stills.

2137
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,920
-London calling.
-Yes?

2138
02:45:39,090 --> 02:45:41,840
-They insist on talking to you personally.
-Give it to Joe.

2139
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:45,100
Yes. Yes, l can rush you 1 500 words.

2140
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:47,430
-Oh, yes, of course it was.
-You want me, Matt?

2141
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,770
Yeah. Hold the church service
until I tell you.

2142
02:45:49,930 --> 02:45:52,230
Here's all we've got
on the two of them together.

2143
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:54,690
It was right outside the house.
Leave them there.

2144
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:58,610
Okay, pictures of the beach
and the home? Right.

2145
02:45:58,780 --> 02:46:00,110
Well, yes.

2146
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:02,400
Yes, it was quite sad.

2147
02:46:02,570 --> 02:46:04,030
Thank you very much.

2148
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:06,950
All right, clear out, all of you.
I got a lot of work to do.

2149
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:09,660
Miss Willer, you stay here.

2150
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:20,590
This is the way the world ends.

2151
02:46:20,760 --> 02:46:24,760
Not with a bang, with a whimper.

2152
02:46:54,830 --> 02:46:56,170
There she is!

2153
02:46:56,330 --> 02:46:58,500
There's Vicki Lester!

2154
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:11,770
- Where'd she go?
- That's Vicki.

2155
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:13,770
That's Vicki, the one in black.

2156
02:47:24,450 --> 02:47:27,360
Don't you care, Vicki.
You'll get over this.

2157
02:47:27,530 --> 02:47:29,200
Turn around, can't you, Vicki?

2158
02:47:29,370 --> 02:47:32,540
Yeah. Give us just one look.

2159
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:40,540
Can't l send out anything on her?

2160
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:43,050
Is she gonna start a new picture?
She going away?

2161
02:47:43,210 --> 02:47:45,550
Send out nothing. That's an order, Libby.

2162
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:47,050
Till we know.

2163
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,300
Until we know what?

2164
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:51,720
Until I can talk to her. Till she'll see me.

2165
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:55,730
She hasn't answered her phone,
even for me, this past week.

2166
02:47:57,690 --> 02:48:01,270
-This gonna stay here?
-As long as l'm head of the studio.

2167
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:17,120
You know, Libby, you missed a lot
not knowing Norman Maine.

2168
02:48:17,290 --> 02:48:21,250
Not knowing him?
I spent my life knowing him.

2169
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:24,590
I knew what he was gonna do
before he did it.

2170
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:26,090
I knew him backwards.

2171
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,430
You didn't know him at all.

2172
02:48:28,590 --> 02:48:30,470
He was quite a guy.

2173
02:48:57,460 --> 02:49:01,290
Is there anything l can do for you,
madam, before l go to bed?

2174
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:03,420
No, thank you, Chuck.

2175
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:05,460
Good night.

2176
02:49:29,070 --> 02:49:30,950
- Good evening.
- Hello. Where is she?

2177
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:32,990
She's in the library. May l have your coat?

2178
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:35,240
No, that's all right. l've got it.

2179
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,800
Hello, Danny.

2180
02:49:46,960 --> 02:49:48,840
You're not dressed.

2181
02:49:51,510 --> 02:49:53,890
-Dressed?
-You're due at that benefit at the Shrine.

2182
02:49:54,050 --> 02:49:55,680
Come on, get dressed.

2183
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:00,930
You told them you'd be there.

2184
02:50:05,270 --> 02:50:07,690
That was b--

2185
02:50:08,030 --> 02:50:09,650
That was before.

2186
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:11,780
I know it was,
but come on and get dressed.

2187
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:13,280
No.

2188
02:50:13,450 --> 02:50:15,700
You just gonna sit here forever?

2189
02:50:15,870 --> 02:50:16,910
Yes!

2190
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:21,500
Tonight and tomorrow night
and for as long as I like.

2191
02:50:22,330 --> 02:50:24,290
I don't want any
of your homemade remedies.

2192
02:50:24,460 --> 02:50:25,670
I know what you're trying.

2193
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:28,920
And the best thing you can do for me
is to just leave me alone.

2194
02:50:29,090 --> 02:50:30,340
You and everybody else.

2195
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:32,550
And thanks for the sympathy.
I don't want it.

2196
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:34,430
Not from you or anybody.

2197
02:50:34,590 --> 02:50:37,220
Sympathy? That's not what you're getting
from me, baby.

2198
02:50:37,390 --> 02:50:39,060
You don't deserve it.

2199
02:50:39,220 --> 02:50:43,600
You're a great monument
to Norman Maine, you are.

2200
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:46,940
He was a drunk and he wasted his life,
but he loved you.

2201
02:50:47,110 --> 02:50:51,740
And he took enormous pride in the one
thing in his life that wasn't a waste, you.

2202
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:53,740
His love for you and your success.

2203
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:57,910
That was the one thing in his life
that wasn't a waste. And he knew it.

2204
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:00,450
Maybe he was wrong to do what he did,
I don't know.

2205
02:51:00,620 --> 02:51:04,750
But he didn't want to destroy that,
destroy the only thing he took pride in.

2206
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:08,880
And now you are doing the one thing
he was terrified of, you're wiping it out.

2207
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,300
You're tossing aside the one thing
he had left.

2208
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:14,550
You're tossing it right back
into the ocean after him!

2209
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,800
You're the only thing that remains
of him now.

2210
02:51:16,970 --> 02:51:20,350
And if you just kick it away,
it's like he never existed...

2211
02:51:20,510 --> 02:51:24,270
...like there never was a Norman Maine
at all.

2212
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:38,700
Will you wait for me?

2213
02:52:45,350 --> 02:52:47,520
- Vicki.
- Hi, honey, how are you?

2214
02:52:47,690 --> 02:52:49,310
How are you? lt's good to see you.

2215
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:51,150
-You look wonderful.
-Thank you.

2216
02:52:51,310 --> 02:52:55,070
She looks great, doesn't she? You too.
Darling, we really gotta go.

2217
02:53:19,340 --> 02:53:24,550
The next star listed to appear
on your program is Miss Vicki Lester.

2218
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:27,560
But we're all of us aware
of the tragic circumstances...

2219
02:53:27,730 --> 02:53:30,810
...which prevent
Vicki Lester's appearance here tonight.

2220
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:33,230
It's with the deepest sympathy--

2221
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:35,570
Will you forgive me for a moment?

2222
02:53:38,570 --> 02:53:40,700
Vicki Lester will appear tonight.

2223
02:53:51,750 --> 02:53:57,590
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,
a star that shines bright and high.

2224
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:08,010
As you know, this program is being
broadcast all over the world.

2225
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:11,430
Before you sing for us, l know
that your millions of fans everywhere...

2226
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:13,690
...are hoping you'll say a few words
to them.

2227
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:16,730
-Won't you?
-Yes.

2228
02:54:18,480 --> 02:54:20,570
Hello, everybody.

2229
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:24,700
This is...

2230
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:28,080
...Mrs. Norman Maine.
