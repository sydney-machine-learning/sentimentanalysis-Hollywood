00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,547
I say there ain't no monster!

3
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,106
But we need men,

4
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,744
and just to treat you fair
and square,

5
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,084
we're payin' double wages
and a bonus

6
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,089
from Frisco to Shanghai
and back, all found.

7
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,125
All dead, you mean,

8
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,127
Don't sign with him,
mates.

9
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,255
You can't buy off the monster
with double wages and a bonus.

10
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,129
You'll never get back to Frisco
to collect your pay.

11
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,692
I got a man here that sailed
on the Golden Arrow

12
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,362
and lived
to tell about it.

13
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,598
Come on, Billy.

14
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,604
Tell 'em
what you saw, Bill.

15
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:00,270
It was the monster,
all right.

16
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,940
A cable's length long
from beak to tail.

17
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,678
And it came a-bellerin'
out of the night

18
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:10,051
with one big eye
like a lighthouse.

19
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:13,216
Whoosh,
We was throwed into starboard,

20
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,952
Ka-rumph,
We were smashed to port.

21
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:19,724
And then...
it come up at midships

22
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:22,561
and broke our backs
and sunk us --

23
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:26,535
40 poor sailor men
drowned dead.

24
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:29,539
The point is,
this thing is a ship killer!

25
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,201
And it's a miracle
old Billy's alive today.

26
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:34,403
Tell 'em about its teeth, Billy.

27
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,377
As big as a mainsail,
I swear it.

28
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:37,708
And its breath --

29
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,874
Ooh, its breath was like
a furnace!

30
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,644
Ooh, you got a pretty strong
breath yourself,

31
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:43,208
my easy-talkin' friend.

32
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:46,445
You mind answering
a few questions?

33
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:49,253
I'm a harpooner by trade,
and monsters interest me --

34
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,485
all kinds.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,824
Keep away from him,
you noisy sea lawyer!

36
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:56,160
Just want to smell his breath.
I can already smell yours.

37
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,823
Phew!

38
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,834
Boiled down
for his oils, lads,

39
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:01,961
there'd be free grog
for all hands!

40
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,870
If we could swallow it
on top of his --

41
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,571
There! There they are!

42
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:10,577
- Here!
- Come on,

43
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:11,544
Stop it!

44
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:12,545
Come on, Casey.

45
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,843
This is no place
for a clergyman's son.

46
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:27,186
Hey!

47
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,197
Hey, Daphne, come on,

48
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,031
Let's shove off!

49
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:42,466
- Oh,
- Oh,

50
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,204
Hey! What are you guys doin'
to me?!

51
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,093
Don't bother unloading.
Sailing's been canceled.

52
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,757
Canceled again?

53
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,563
This is ridiculous.
We'll see about this.

54
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:11,897
Driver, you wait here.

55
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,959
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:17,006
Is it true about the sailing
being canceled?

57
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,975
Unfortunately, yes,
Professor Aronnax.

58
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,601
The crew deserted
this morning.

59
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,236
But we just have to get
to Saigon.

60
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:23,746
Isn't there
some other ship?

61
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:25,112
Not a thing.
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,241
Next.

63
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,080
Halfway around the world
from Paris,

64
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,415
and --
and now this happens.

65
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,249
There's nothing we can do
about it.

66
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,253
No.

67
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,914
Except pack and unpack.

68
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:36,255
It's all I've been doing now
for a month.

69
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:37,759
Oh, professor?

70
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,921
At any rate, San Francisco
will have the honor

71
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,760
of your company
a while longer.

72
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:43,231
I'm from The Bulletin.

73
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,234
These gentlemen are from
The Globe and The Post.

74
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,394
- How do you do?
- Gentlemen.

75
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,563
We're interested in
your opinion of this monster.

76
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,900
My opinion?

77
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:52,372
Frankly, it's rather low
at the moment.

78
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:53,874
But actually, gentlemen,

79
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:56,878
I don't know any more
about it than you do.

80
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,312
Oh, professor...
uh, just a moment.

81
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:01,247
Yes?

82
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,842
Professor, what does
the National Museum in Paris

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,887
think about it?

84
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:06,148
I cannot answer that.

85
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,486
Professor, we heard this,
uh, expedition of yours

86
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:10,491
was to gather facts
about the monster.

87
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,322
I'm afraid
you were misinformed.

88
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:15,261
My reasons for going to the
Orient are purely scientific --

89
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,264
if I ever get there.

90
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:19,266
Professor,
doesn't the giant narwhal

91
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:20,528
reach a length of 80 feet?

92
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,365
Why don't you ask
a fish?

93
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:24,029
If we could go deep enough,

94
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:26,505
we'd all be surprised
at the creatures down there.

95
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,371
Well, could such a creature
destroy a ship

96
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,670
or drag it under?

97
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:32,177
Well, it might
if it were big enough.

98
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:33,679
Don't you print that.

99
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,738
Please be careful,
professor.

100
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,376
Well, gentlemen, I shall
prepare a statement later.

101
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:41,353
You do not deny, then, that
such a monster could exist.

102
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:42,514
ls that correct?

103
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,023
I'm not denying
anything.

104
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,183
Are you sure?

105
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,193
Hey, what are you
drawing there?

106
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,852
A sketch of the monster.

107
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:50,259
Thank you, professor.

108
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,093
- Good day.
- Back to the hotel, driver.

109
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:54,258
- Yes, sir.
- Good day, sir.

110
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,399
Now put the wings on it.

111
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,939
Look what they've done
to me.

112
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,102
I made no such claims
as these.

113
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:06,509
Look at this drawing.

114
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,512
I knew it.

115
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,571
"Living horrors of the deep
were described today

116
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,948
by Professor Aronnax
of the Paris National Museum."

117
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,147
Why, this is the most
far-fetched nonsense yet.

118
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,985
Far-fetched?

119
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,821
I think the proportions are
about right on the monster.

120
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:22,826
Hmm?

121
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:24,658
You're not serious,
professor?

122
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,493
Oh, I don't mean flying off
with a ship in its mouth.

123
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,999
But the general size...

124
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,932
You know,
come to think of it,

125
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:34,267
it is a rather interesting
conception.

126
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,600
Excuse me,
Professor Aronnax.

127
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:36,935
Oh, no.
No more reporters.

128
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,374
You've done damage enough.
Professor is very busy now.

129
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,910
But I'm not a reporter.

130
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,605
I represent
the United States government.

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,272
United States government?

132
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,439
May I come in?

133
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,607
Will he come in?

134
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:47,775
Of course, sir.

135
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,819
Uh, please do come in,
Mr. Howard.

136
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,978
- Of course.
- Thank you.

137
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,646
I'll be brief,
professor.

138
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,587
I understand that your
destination is the Orient

139
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,353
and that you've been delayed.

140
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,621
What would you say
if we could get you there,

141
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,992
but by a roundabout route,

142
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,190
a cruise of three or four months
through the South Seas?

143
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:03,596
Would you accept?

144
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,692
Well, uh, I would be interested,
yes, naturally.

145
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,202
Uh, sit down.

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,532
Thank you.

147
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,300
I can see no reason

148
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,637
why you and your apprentice
shouldn't consider yourselves

149
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,472
guests of the United States
government

150
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:17,671
until we can set you ashore
at Saigon, do you?

151
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:21,512
May I ask, uh, why have you
honored the professor this way?

152
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,244
Well, I think
the honor is ours.

153
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,912
As the foremost authority
on the sea and its mysteries,

154
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,682
you can be
an excellent observer.

155
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:30,485
Your observations will greatly
influence public opinion,

156
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:33,618
and we can either confirm
or deny certain rumors.

157
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:37,131
I knew it --
concerns the monster.

158
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,790
ls that true?

159
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,958
Very much so.

160
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,467
And according to the papers,

161
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,469
you seem to believe
the rumors, professor.

162
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:46,301
Oh, no. The professor has been
misquoted outrageously.

163
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,637
Yes, I'm afraid
I was misquoted.

164
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:51,644
However, I have an open mind
on the subject.

165
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:54,647
All the better.
Your reports would be unbiased.

166
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:57,115
You see, other nations
besides ours

167
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:58,617
are forming expeditions,

168
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:01,051
but I like to think
ours has the advantage

169
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,556
if for no other reason than
you might consent to join us.

170
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:07,217
Well, it's, uh, very kind
of you, uh...

171
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:08,385
We accept.

172
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,485
Good.

173
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,325
And now, professor,
if you don't mind,

174
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:13,922
I'd like you to come downstairs
and meet Captain Farragut.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,491
He's in command of the warship
upon which you're sailing.

176
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,868
And I might add that he has
some rather strong ideas

177
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:22,202
on the subject of sea monsters.

178
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,468
You mean that his mind
is not open?

179
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,035
Most emphatically not.

180
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:35,477
We headed south,
and excitement ran high.

181
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,489
Every man aboard was
on the lookout,

182
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:42,424
and the watch was kept
day and night.

183
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:46,225
Regardless of his own feelings
in the matter,

184
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,892
Captain Farragut left nothing
to chance.

185
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,731
With traditional thoroughness,

186
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:55,068
the Navy plan was to cut
the South Pacific into squares

187
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,131
and search each square.

188
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:39,878
For the first month,
we steamed in circles,

189
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:42,883
crossing and recrossing
our course.

190
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:45,613
There was no sign
of our quarry.

191
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,223
False alarms were common,

192
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,731
and they didn't help
our morale.

193
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,498
Blow!

194
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,836
Off the weather bow!

195
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:45,376
For endless days and nights,
we scoured the South Pacific.

196
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:48,379
Our hopes began to wane.

197
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:52,042
It came as no surprise
when Captain Farragut,

198
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:55,348
on the night
of December 8, 1868,

199
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,853
summoned us to the wardroom.

200
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,789
Gentlemen, I believe
my obligation to this legend

201
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,519
has been dispatched.

202
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,720
I offer these charts
in evidence.

203
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:06,922
They represent
an accurate record

204
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,262
of 3 1/2 months cruising
under steam

205
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,925
in search of a sea monster.

206
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:12,867
In my considered opinion,

207
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:15,530
no such monster exists
or ever did.

208
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,368
Are you abandoning
the search?

209
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,374
There's no other choice,
professor.

210
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,103
If we've gained
nothing else,

211
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:23,669
we can at least give
the lie to those rumors

212
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:26,580
and make the newspapers
retract their exaggerations.

213
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,947
It doesn't seem to me

214
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,645
we have proved anything
one way or the other, Captain.

215
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:34,190
Well, I don't feel justified
in wasting further time.

216
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:37,692
My decision stands.
We'll set you ashore in Saigon.

217
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,091
Gentlemen.

218
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:50,630
Cheer up, professor.

219
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:53,674
You'll forget all about fishing
when you see the gals in Saigon.

220
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,504
I thought
they promised you a bonus

221
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:57,670
if you harpooned
this monster, Mr. Land.

222
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:59,804
Ah, knowing full well
I couldn't collect it.

223
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:00,813
When I get back,

224
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,248
I'm shippin' out on the first
whaler that'll take me.

225
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,183
I won't get rich,
but I won't be sitting around,

226
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,346
picking my teeth
with my harpoon.

227
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,515
Maybe we are lucky.
It might have sunk us.

228
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,024
You scare me.

229
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,684
Be a good loser, professor.

230
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,092
The fish that got away is
always the biggest one.

231
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,189
What a pity, professor.

232
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,995
I know you had visions
of that monster

233
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,968
mounted in the National Museum.

234
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,374
There was Harpoon Hannah.

235
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,213
Had a face
that made you shudder,

236
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,879
lips like fishhooks...

237
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:55,388
And a nose just like a rudder.

238
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:31,413
Ahoy!
Ship off the starboard bow!

239
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,823
Hard over!

240
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,491
Head for that ship!

241
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:44,662
First mate, pipe all hands
to rescue stations.

242
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:45,670
Aye, aye, sir.

243
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,242
All hands to rescue stations!

244
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:06,581
I'm thinkin' she went down
with all hands.

245
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:10,593
Poor devils.
Not a living soul left.

246
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,122
What could have caused
such a fearsome explosion?

247
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,691
Black powder and worse --
a whole shipload of the stuff.

248
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,135
What could've
set it off, though?

249
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,603
She must've struck something.

250
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:24,106
Or could it be that
something struck the ship?

251
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,267
Huh? What do you mean
something struck her?

252
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:28,436
You're meanin' the monster,
ain't ya, mate?

253
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,207
Aye, it might be the monster,
all right!

254
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,907
The monster?!

255
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:34,314
I've seen more monsters
in my Aunt Gussie's fishbowl

256
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,749
than on this whole cruise!

257
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,912
- Sure, it's the monster!
- It is the monster!

258
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,117
Pipe down on deck!

259
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,625
I must insist, professor,

260
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:46,388
that you keep these
fish stories to yourself.

261
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:49,625
On deck! Floating object
off the larboard quarter!

262
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,237
There's the monster!

263
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:13,043
Drummer boy,
beat to general quarters.

264
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,967
Set compressors and prime!

265
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,731
Look alive, there!

266
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,061
Get your range
and fire, Carson,

267
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,225
What's the matter?

268
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,768
She's showing us
her heel, sir!

269
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,565
Well, hit her in the heels,
then, Fire!

270
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:07,798
Aye, aye, sir.

271
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:09,864
Run her out smartly!

272
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:22,310
We hit her, sir!
She's turnin',

273
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,013
She's turnin' around,

274
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:34,191
Mr. Land,
into the longboat with you,

275
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,256
Stand by to lower away.

276
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:21,733
Professor...hang on,

277
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:24,437
Hang on,

278
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,253
Hey! Don't leave us!

279
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,423
Help!

280
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,056
Help!

281
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:49,401
Help!

282
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:52,632
They are the same.
They cannot help.

283
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:54,139
But they must!

284
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:56,141
Help!

285
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,768
Help!

286
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,005
Help!

287
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:14,819
Can you see anything --
anything at all?

288
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:17,622
No.
Wait till this fog lifts.

289
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:20,220
I'm getting numb
all over.

290
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:24,462
Look, professor.
T-There's something over there.

291
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,435
What is it?

292
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:27,994
I don't know.

293
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:30,472
It -- It looks
like the monster.

294
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,443
I don't care what it is,
as long as it floats.

295
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:45,046
Who could have conceived
such a miracle?

296
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:46,885
A submarine boat.

297
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,152
You mean
a submerging boat?

298
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:51,126
But this is incredible.

299
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:53,788
Men have dreamed
about such miracles.

300
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,195
You know something?
I, I don't like this at all.

301
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,202
Ahoy!

302
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:07,435
Is anyone aboard?

303
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:13,207
It...It seems deserted.

304
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:16,375
I think we are asking
for trouble, professor.

305
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:17,543
Why don't we wait?

306
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:19,553
Maybe -- Maybe somebody
will come up.

307
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:22,818
No. If we wait, this thing is
liable to sink under us.

308
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:23,983
Huh?

309
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,721
It's quite able to,
you know.

310
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:36,168
Hello?

311
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:38,727
ls anyone down there?

312
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:50,239
Why...
it's as bright as day,

313
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:53,308
and it isn't oil or gas,
either.

314
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,924
There is great genius
behind all this.

315
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,927
Yes, and great evil.

316
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:06,431
Don't forget this --
this is an agent of destruction.

317
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,173
Hello?

318
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:21,906
Hello?

319
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,744
Ahoy! Anybody there?

320
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:28,752
Ahoy, there!
Is anybody aboard?

321
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,447
Did you hear that,
professor?

322
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:32,489
Somebody's calling
from the outside.

323
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:33,614
Come on,

324
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,454
Wait.

325
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:38,017
Look at this.

326
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:59,744
Give me a hand
with this line, mate.

327
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:01,078
Grab this oar.

328
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,016
Why, Ned, it's you,

329
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,850
Well, I'll be.

330
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,355
Anybody else get off?

331
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:09,687
Yes. The professor is
down below.

332
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,087
Well, he really got
his monster, didn't he?

333
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:16,097
You know,
the ship seems deserted,

334
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,599
but I have a feeling
not for too long, and...

335
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,602
and personally, I'm in no mood
to meet the owners.

336
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,434
I'm not anxious to get
in their company myself.

337
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,303
I'll take my chances
in the open sea,

338
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,899
if it's all the same
with you.

339
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,273
My sentiment exactly.
Let me call the professor.

340
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,369
Here. Give me a hand first.
Grab that oar.

341
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,209
We got to flop this over.

342
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,440
Hold it.

343
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,283
Well, I'll be.

344
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,518
I've never seen a barge
like this before.

345
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,699
Hey, this looks
like the galley.

346
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,838
Cook's day off, too.

347
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,242
Let me call
the professor.

348
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,015
Professor?

349
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,177
Professor?

350
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,848
Professor?

351
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,857
Can you hear me?

352
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,455
Professor?

353
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,964
Professor?

354
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:10,470
Professor?

355
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:16,275
Profess--

356
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:25,420
Professor, where are you?

357
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:27,581
Hello. I, I'm in here.

358
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:28,817
Where?

359
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:38,959
I...didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

360
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,627
What is it?

361
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:42,864
Burial ceremony...

362
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:44,270
under the sea.

363
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:16,360
You know, Ned Land is here
with a boat.

364
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:17,369
Yes, yes.

365
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:19,201
That tall one must be
the leader.

366
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,332
They -- They'll be coming back
any moment!

367
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,373
Go on,

368
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,711
Get away!

369
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,843
Help!

370
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:46,585
Help!

371
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:22,521
Search the boat.

372
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:23,521
Aye, sir.

373
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,080
Come with me.

374
00:28:50,282 --> 00:28:51,613
Take him,

375
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:56,714
Sink that longboat!

376
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:09,025
All right.
Mind your shovin', mate.

377
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,788
You are from the warship
that attacked me, are you not?

378
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,187
Yes.

379
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:36,691
We were under the impression
that this was a monster,

380
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,159
not a craft
of human invention.

381
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,822
This is Ned Land,
master harpooner;

382
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:43,832
my apprentice, Conseil;

383
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,358
and I am Pierre Aronnax
of the Paris National Museum.

384
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:50,030
Professor Aronnax.

385
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:53,701
I've heard of you
and studied your writings.

386
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:56,539
It is fortunate that your
background differs slightly

387
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,704
from that of your companions
in crime.

388
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,042
You may remain.

389
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,377
Take the others on deck.

390
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,711
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

391
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:04,547
What do you want to do
with us on deck?

392
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,052
I did not invite you here.

393
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,713
You came as an enemy
to destroy me.

394
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,723
But that is not true.
They've done no harm.

395
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,316
Look, don't blame us
because the warship shelled you.

396
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,656
I demand a fair trial,

397
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,921
You've had your trial.

398
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,589
The sea brought you.
The sea shall have you back.

399
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:21,426
Mind your shovin',
Easy, mate!

400
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:25,031
But you cannot do this!
This is not civilized,

401
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:28,700
I'm not what is called
a civilized man, professor.

402
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:30,368
I have done with society

403
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,935
for reasons that seem good
to me.

404
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:35,446
Therefore,
I do not obey its laws.

405
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:38,450
But I am as guilty
as they are!

406
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,009
But...

407
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,555
I will grant you that both
of them and me, too,

408
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:46,421
enlisted to track down what we
thought to be a monster,

409
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:47,550
but in that case,

410
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:49,595
we are no more guilty
than the rest of the world.

411
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,926
I would consider that
guilty enough.

412
00:30:56,468 --> 00:31:00,063
You have a great deal
to learn, professor.

413
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:04,734
Your book is brilliant...
but it lacks scope.

414
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,744
You have carried your work

415
00:31:06,812 --> 00:31:10,714
as far as terrestrial
science permits.

416
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:13,545
The real story
of the ocean depths

417
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:16,382
begins
where you left off --

418
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:20,390
wonders that defy my powers
of description...

419
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,894
The secrets
that are mine alone...

420
00:31:23,961 --> 00:31:26,987
but which I would be willing
to share with you.

421
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:31,261
At the expense
of my companions' lives?

422
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:32,596
I'm sorry.

423
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:35,433
You would have to choose
between them and me.

424
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:39,835
Then I cannot accept.

425
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:45,245
Professor,
I regret your choice.

426
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,347
Take him up...

427
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:51,511
and secure for sea.

428
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:52,679
Aye, sir.

429
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:53,744
But...

430
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:12,298
All stations ready.

431
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:14,136
Prepare for diving.

432
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,470
Yes, sir.

433
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:18,034
All stations ready.
Prepare for diving.

434
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:29,449
Ahead slow.

435
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:31,957
What's he up to,
professor?

436
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:34,892
I don't know.

437
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:44,730
- Trim your forward ballast.
- Trim your forward ballast.

438
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:45,897
Three degrees down.

439
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:47,405
Three degrees down.

440
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,359
All engines stop.
Service and stand by.

441
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:25,338
Pick up those two men
in the water.

442
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,001
Aye, sir.
What about the other one?

443
00:33:27,077 --> 00:33:31,013
Take them all below
and confine them to quarters.

444
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:34,050
I found out
what I wanted to know.

445
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,803
Esmay.

446
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,900
There.

447
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:01,966
There.

448
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:02,976
There.

449
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,137
Now kiss.

450
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:08,978
Now off you go.
Off you go, Esmay.

451
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,483
Come in, gentlemen.

452
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,983
Be seated, please.

453
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:15,647
Thank you.

454
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,990
Professor.

455
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,524
You may serve them.

456
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,397
Your clothes are being dried

457
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,369
and will be returned
to you shortly.

458
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:31,427
In the meantime,

459
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,700
avail yourselves
of my humble hospitality.

460
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:34,968
"Humble," he calls it.

461
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:37,135
Hey, you do right well
for yourself, mate.

462
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:38,974
You may call me
Captain Nemo.

463
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:42,140
I'd like to express
our gratitude, Captain.

464
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:43,808
We are grateful
to be alive.

465
00:34:43,883 --> 00:34:45,475
I want none
of your gratitude.

466
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:47,486
You're all under
strictest probation,

467
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:50,022
and I'd advise you
not to attempt escape.

468
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,954
You understand
your position?

469
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,458
Well, I don't know,
Captain.

470
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,460
Prisoner has a right
to escape, hasn't he?

471
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:56,620
That is correct.

472
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:58,163
And a guest
don't need to.

473
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:00,461
Say, I guess that makes us
a little bit of both, huh?

474
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:01,932
Ha ha ha --

475
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:05,837
Consider that a fortunate
compromise, then, Mr. Land.

476
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,270
I tolerate no guests
aboard The Nautilus,

477
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,865
and you already know
the fate of prisoners.

478
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:17,410
The food is delicious,
isn't it, professor?

479
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,213
Oh, very good.
Never tasted better.

480
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,344
There's a fork
on your left, Mr. Land --

481
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,513
or aren't you accustomed
to utensils?

482
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,754
I'm indifferent to 'em.

483
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,289
May I ask how you are able

484
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,956
to set such a table as this,
Captain?

485
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,693
These dishes come entirely
from my ocean kitchen.

486
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,792
There is nothing here
of the Earth.

487
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,396
How remarkable.
This tastes like veal.

488
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:46,238
The flavor deceives you.
That is fillet of sea snake.

489
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,573
Hmm?

490
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:53,378
I suppose
this isn't lamb, then.

491
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,613
That is brisket of blowfish
with sea squid dressing,

492
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:58,381
basted in barnacles.

493
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:02,585
It's very good.

494
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:06,094
In fact,
it's better than lamb.

495
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:09,426
Yes, my cook excels in preparing
these various products.

496
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:11,261
You're not finished,
are you?

497
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:14,825
Well, uh,
just the main course.

498
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:18,203
Uh, pass the cream,
mate, huh?

499
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:22,835
The cream is, of course, milk
from the giant sperm whale.

500
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:25,379
And those delicious fruits
you are eating

501
00:36:25,446 --> 00:36:28,210
are actually preserves
made from sea cucumbers.

502
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:30,444
Well, I'd never
have guessed it.

503
00:36:30,518 --> 00:36:32,952
They are excellent.

504
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:35,956
Eat your pudding, Mr. Land.

505
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,492
I ain't sure it's puddin'.

506
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,228
What is it?

507
00:36:44,298 --> 00:36:46,027
It's my own recipe --

508
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,727
saute of unborn octopus.

509
00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:54,264
Nothin' here's fit to eat.
Saute of unborn octopus.

510
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:56,901
Since we are nearing
the island of Crespo,

511
00:36:56,977 --> 00:37:00,377
you will have an opportunity
of selecting your own food.

512
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,780
Y-You mean we're gettin' off
this submarine?

513
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,340
For a brief
hunting expedition.

514
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:08,751
Well, that --
that suits me fine.

515
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:09,981
Me too.

516
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:12,149
When do we start, mate --
uh, Captain?

517
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:13,418
Almost immediately.

518
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,823
These two will join
the expedition.

519
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:16,122
Will you prepare them?

520
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:17,526
Aye, sir.

521
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:28,698
Accept one of these cigars,
professor.

522
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,206
Thank you.

523
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,384
Delightful smoke.

524
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:48,049
Different somehow.
Havana?

525
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,858
Seaweed.

526
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,729
Well, I cannot accuse you

527
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:56,788
of not making us
comfortable, Captain.

528
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:59,426
In a way, though, I feel
like a condemned man

529
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:01,333
who has eaten
his last dinner.

530
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,803
And a very good one, too.

531
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:03,896
Thank you.

532
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:05,770
Uh, I am still curious

533
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:09,039
as to the reason
you spared our lives.

534
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,409
In your case,

535
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,745
I wanted to test your loyalty
to your companions.

536
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:16,875
I may have use for such
misplaced devotion.

537
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:17,884
Misplaced?

538
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:19,181
It comforts me to know

539
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:21,381
that your life was not
too dear a price to pay

540
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,321
for love
of your fellow man.

541
00:38:23,392 --> 00:38:25,519
I'm afraid
I don't understand.

542
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,495
At the moment,
I don't intend that you should.

543
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:30,292
But I may have use for you.

544
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:32,128
And until I make up my mind,

545
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,691
you should find
ample diversion here.

546
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,432
You have literature,
art treasures,

547
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:44,376
my collections,
and even music if you so desire.

548
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:55,050
Ah.

549
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,817
We're almost at the island
of Crespo.

550
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:01,918
All this was once an island.

551
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:05,021
Although it has now sunk,
it is nonetheless fertile.

552
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:07,259
We do our hunting
and farming here.

553
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,460
Underwater?

554
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,492
The sea supplies
all my wants.

555
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,136
Fine way to go huntin'.

556
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:15,673
I knew there'd be a catch
to this.

557
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:17,333
Seems you can't do anything
on this boat

558
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:19,001
without getting wet.

559
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:21,513
Hey, I feel like I'm keepin'
a fish out of work.

560
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:24,049
Ha ha ha ha!

561
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:25,516
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

562
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:26,609
Where you goin' with this?

563
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:30,019
Hey, what are you gonna
do with that, huh?

564
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:50,096
An expedition
from The Nautilus.

565
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:55,466
The pair you see trying to
keep pace are your companions.

566
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,267
It's a new experience
for them.

567
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:00,204
They'll learn quickly.

568
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,748
Would you like
to join them?

569
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,184
Indeed, yes.

570
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,813
I, I would like to meet
these wonders face-to-face.

571
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:18,824
Very well.
I'll introduce them to you.

572
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:56,442
A strange twilight world
opened up before me,

573
00:42:56,518 --> 00:43:00,147
and I felt as the first man
to set foot on another planet,

574
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:04,318
an intruder in this mystic
garden of the deep.

575
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:35,418
Captain Nemo and I
were not alone.

576
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,548
There were hunters and farmers
from the submarine,

577
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:41,594
gathering a harvest
at the bottom of the sea.

578
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:49,401
I could only marvel
at his ingenuity

579
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:53,564
and envy him his rule over this
forgotten reach of nature.

580
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:20,429
Here, in abundance,
were various substances

581
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:22,488
necessary to sustain life --

582
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:26,127
an underwater larder
filled to overflowing,

583
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:29,366
and all Captain Nemo's
for the taking.

584
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,072
If I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes,

585
00:48:39,142 --> 00:48:40,541
I wouldn't have
believed it.

586
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:43,079
Hey, Captain. Captain,
we left a treasure out there --

587
00:48:43,146 --> 00:48:45,205
a whole chest of gold,
silver, and diamonds.

588
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:46,806
You were sent to get food,
not treasure.

589
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,077
You can't eat
pieces of eight.

590
00:48:48,151 --> 00:48:49,778
Eat? I can eat anytime.

591
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:51,081
You place an absurd value

592
00:48:51,154 --> 00:48:52,814
on the cheapest
of human commodities.

593
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,448
Aboard The Nautilus, we use such
baubles for ballast.

594
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,491
Ballast?

595
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,670
Well, I could sure
lighten this ship.

596
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,298
The greatest treasures
of all, Mr. Land,

597
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:14,604
are a sound mind
and a full belly.

598
00:49:15,777 --> 00:49:17,108
Henceforth,
when you're sent for food,

599
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:18,702
don't stoop to pick up
pennies.

600
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,771
You've been pickin' 'em up,

601
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:22,646
and picking 'em up good --
"ballast."

602
00:49:22,717 --> 00:49:23,979
Ned, you forget yourself.

603
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:25,849
Don't try my patience,
Mr. Land.

604
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,649
Rather than watch
your every move,

605
00:49:27,722 --> 00:49:31,384
I know a much easier
solution to the problem.

606
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,585
Cryin' waste!

607
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:37,353
Ohhhh.

608
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:48,237
Ned, the professor
wants to see you.

609
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:49,241
Yeah?

610
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,834
Close the door, please.

611
00:49:53,913 --> 00:49:55,141
Don't think for a minute

612
00:49:55,214 --> 00:49:57,045
that was an empty threat
he made.

613
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,879
You are going to get us
all killed

614
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:00,612
if you keep on
antagonizing him.

615
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:03,383
Look at the trouble you got
into wandering off that way.

616
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:04,548
Why did you do it?

617
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:06,888
Ask him.
He went with me.

618
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:08,983
That was
scientific interest.

619
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:11,859
I, I had no idea
he was after treasure.

620
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,591
Oh, no?

621
00:50:13,665 --> 00:50:14,825
Stop it!

622
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,663
You even helped carry
the chest out, you liar.

623
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:18,100
We mustn't quarrel
among ourselves.

624
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,865
We must stay together.
It's our only chance.

625
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:21,030
Chance? For what?

626
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:22,835
Oh, I know what you want,
professor.

627
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:24,933
This crazy iron skillet's
turned your head.

628
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,602
You want to play
a waitin' game,

629
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:28,372
hoping to learn
ol' Nemo's secrets.

630
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:31,347
Well, I believe we owe
the world that much, Ned.

631
00:50:31,415 --> 00:50:32,814
Have you a better plan?

632
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:34,441
Yeah --
I want to get off.

633
00:50:34,518 --> 00:50:37,817
Of course, I don't mind goin'
with my pockets full.

634
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:40,152
I can't believe
you could be so foolish.

635
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:42,749
Why not? He's got
a king's ransom aboard here.

636
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,260
And don't call it stealin',

637
00:50:44,328 --> 00:50:45,886
because that's the way
he got it.

638
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:48,294
If we could take this thing
over, we'd be rich.

639
00:50:48,365 --> 00:50:49,764
I'd have a ship of me own,

640
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,300
and you wouldn't have
to be starvin' along

641
00:50:51,368 --> 00:50:53,063
on a professor's pay.

642
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,434
Don't look at me with
those soft-boiled eggs.

643
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:58,099
I caught the glint of gold in
them when that chest busted.

644
00:51:00,377 --> 00:51:01,639
Ned, listen to me.

645
00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:03,872
I want you
to forget this idea

646
00:51:03,947 --> 00:51:07,643
and promise me that you won't
start anything on your own.

647
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,775
I won't promise that,
professor.

648
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:11,786
But at least
try my way first.

649
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:14,448
I know I can win
the captain's confidence,

650
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:17,185
but I need time
and I need your help.

651
00:51:17,259 --> 00:51:20,251
Can I count on you?

652
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:21,694
All right.

653
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:23,698
Well,
I'll go this far --

654
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:26,791
I won't try
any one-man mutiny...yet.

655
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:28,529
It is the best way.
Believe me.

656
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:32,164
There's one thing
you oughta know, professor --

657
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,673
Nemo's cracked.

658
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,174
I have yet to see the day

659
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:37,370
you can make a deal
with a mad dog.

660
00:51:37,445 --> 00:51:39,538
So while
you're feedin' him sugar,

661
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:41,946
I'll be figurin' a plan
to muzzle him.

662
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,514
Fool.

663
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:51,557
He simply cannot grasp
the significance of all this.

664
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,149
Here we are within reach

665
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,660
of the most fabulous discoveries
of all time,

666
00:51:55,729 --> 00:52:01,190
and he patters of gold,
escape, trivialities, nonsense.

667
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:04,327
Well, that depends upon your
point of view, professor.

668
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:05,961
What do you mean by that?

669
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,903
I just think that Ned
values his life

670
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:09,964
above scientific achievement,
that's all.

671
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:11,566
His life means nothing.

672
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,134
Nor does mine or yours

673
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:15,680
compared to what's
behind all this.

674
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:17,909
We can't have him
crossing Nemo.

675
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,967
Today we encountered
a fearsome storm.

676
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,942
An ordinary vessel would've
suffered heavy damage.

677
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,741
Safe and serene, The Nautilus
cruised beneath the tempest.

678
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:01,739
There was much to occupy me,

679
00:54:01,814 --> 00:54:04,908
so I left my apprentice
to deal with Ned Land.

680
00:54:06,853 --> 00:54:09,447
Although he had apparently
settled down,

681
00:54:09,522 --> 00:54:13,049
I knew he bore
constant watching.

682
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,136
Right, sir.
I'll check all decks below.

683
00:55:07,311 --> 00:55:09,074
Ooh.

684
00:55:24,294 --> 00:55:26,194
Cute, isn't she?

685
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,305
As the voyage continued,

686
00:55:43,379 --> 00:55:46,314
The Nautilus
and its motive power

687
00:55:46,382 --> 00:55:49,215
excited my utmost curiosity.

688
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:52,845
At my host's invitation,
I inspected the ship.

689
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:56,321
He seemed determined
to show me everything.

690
00:55:58,393 --> 00:56:00,588
We went to the very heart
of the vessel..

691
00:56:00,662 --> 00:56:02,926
the propulsion unit.

692
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:39,264
It was apparent that
Captain Nemo had discovered

693
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:41,856
what mankind
has always sought --

694
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:45,131
the veritable dynamic power
of the universe.

695
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:49,038
This secret alone gave him
mastery of the sea.

696
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:54,901
I can hardly believe

697
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:58,540
how one could conceive
and build such a craft

698
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:00,345
and, in a single stroke,

699
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:04,377
harness power beyond
the wildest dreams of science.

700
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:08,358
Why, such a secret could
revolutionize the world.

701
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,860
Or destroy it.

702
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:25,803
See how peaceful
it is here.

703
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,140
The sea is everything --

704
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,476
an immense reservoir
of nature,

705
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,014
where I roam at will.

706
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,879
With seeming indifference,

707
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,614
Captain Nemo held the key
to the future of the world.

708
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,020
As I studied him,
I became aware

709
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,856
that powerful forces were at
work within this strange man.

710
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,362
Think of it.

711
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:53,162
On the surface,
there is hunger and fear.

712
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:56,830
Men still exercise
unjust laws.

713
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:01,604
They fight and tear
one another to pieces.

714
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:05,635
A mere few feet
beneath the waves,

715
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:10,014
their reign ceases,
their evil drowns.

716
00:58:10,085 --> 00:58:15,454
Here on the ocean floor
is the only independence.

717
00:58:15,523 --> 00:58:17,718
Here I am free.

718
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,119
Imagine what would happen

719
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:26,565
if they controlled machines
such as a submarine boat.

720
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:30,364
Far better that they think
there's a monster

721
00:58:32,071 --> 00:58:34,266
and hunt me with harpoons.

722
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:39,506
After traveling 10,000 leagues
under the sea,

723
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:43,709
I still had not solved
the mystery of Captain Nemo.

724
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:46,843
But when one day he asked me
to go ashore with him,

725
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,717
I felt, at long last,
I was to have my answer.

726
00:59:02,968 --> 00:59:05,402
The prison camp of Rura Pente,

727
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,664
the white man's grave.

728
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:09,228
But I thought
it had been abolished.

729
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:12,765
Nothing is abolished that turns
a profit to that hated nation.

730
00:59:14,345 --> 00:59:16,609
You'll see better what I mean
through this.

731
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:23,278
What is in those sacks
they are carrying?

732
00:59:23,354 --> 00:59:26,414
Nitrates and phosphate
for ammunition --

733
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,854
the seeds of war.

734
00:59:27,924 --> 00:59:30,859
They're loading
a full cargo of death.

735
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:32,986
And when that ship
takes it home,

736
00:59:33,063 --> 00:59:35,861
the world will die
a little more.

737
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:41,593
I was once one of those pitiful
wretches you see down there.

738
00:59:43,273 --> 00:59:45,002
Look at it again,
professor.

739
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:48,168
I don't want you to forget
what you've seen here today.

740
00:59:49,945 --> 00:59:51,879
I've seen enough.

741
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:57,746
It's burned everlastingly
in my memory.

742
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:09,324
I did not escape
from there alone.

743
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,830
There were others.

744
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,367
Most of them
are still with me.

745
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:15,766
The crew of The Nautilus?

746
01:00:15,837 --> 01:00:19,933
They're dedicated men
with a plan for living,

747
01:00:20,008 --> 01:00:22,340
but also a plan for dying.

748
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,812
We seized one of their ships
and fled beyond maps --

749
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,316
a place known to me
simply as Vulcania.

750
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:33,581
Vulcania.
Sounds remote.

751
01:00:33,654 --> 01:00:35,019
Remote and useful.

752
01:00:35,088 --> 01:00:38,057
It was there that we built
The Nautilus.

753
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:42,152
You will have the privilege
of seeing all this firsthand.

754
01:00:42,229 --> 01:00:44,254
When our mission
is completed,

755
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:45,957
The Nautilus is going home.

756
01:00:57,777 --> 01:01:00,177
They're getting up steam,
sir.

757
01:01:01,948 --> 01:01:03,210
Very good.

758
01:01:03,282 --> 01:01:07,445
That ship that flies no flag
sails with the tide.

759
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:09,248
But the evil in its hold

760
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:11,551
will never reach
its destination.

761
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:12,885
You have your orders.

762
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,017
Aye, sir.
Go to your stations.

763
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:16,924
Go below, professor.

764
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:19,361
You are going to sink
that ship?

765
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:23,060
I said, "Go below."
Stay in your quarters.

766
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:12,067
Stand by, engines.

767
01:03:15,007 --> 01:03:16,804
Half ahead.

768
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,160
Collision speed, Full,

769
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:41,253
Collision speed, Full,

770
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:04,240
Professor...

771
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:06,210
Are you all right?

772
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:12,279
All those men -- they --
they didn't even have a chance.

773
01:05:12,351 --> 01:05:15,444
They were sailors,
same as me --

774
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,681
slaughtered
by that monster

775
01:05:17,756 --> 01:05:20,384
you're tryin'
to make friends with.

776
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,652
Ned, don't.

777
01:05:21,726 --> 01:05:23,819
I don't know how you feel,
professor,

778
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:25,157
but I feel like a knife

779
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:27,528
that's just stabbed
a friend in the back.

780
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,500
Go to your quarters.

781
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:33,833
I've had a bellyful.

782
01:05:33,904 --> 01:05:35,098
Damage report, sir.

783
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:37,834
Rudder and starboard
diving planes disabled.

784
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:39,398
Muster a repair party.

785
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:41,637
We'll make
temporary repairs here.

786
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:42,872
Aye, sir.

787
01:05:47,518 --> 01:05:50,578
I asked you to leave,
professor.

788
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:52,815
You also asked me ashore

789
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:56,188
to show me
man's inhumanity to man.

790
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:59,456
Why? To justify this?

791
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:03,226
You are not only a murderer,
you are a hypocrite.

792
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:06,598
The proof lies out there.

793
01:06:06,669 --> 01:06:09,399
You call that murder?!

794
01:06:09,472 --> 01:06:10,996
Well, I see murder, too,

795
01:06:11,074 --> 01:06:12,768
not written on those
drowned faces out there

796
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:15,901
but on the faces
of dead thousands!

797
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:18,538
There are the assassins,
the dealers in death,

798
01:06:18,614 --> 01:06:20,047
I am the avenger.

799
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:26,944
ls murder a right reserved
for that hated nation

800
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:29,320
that has taken everything
else from me --

801
01:06:29,391 --> 01:06:30,483
everything but my secret,

802
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,820
the secret of
my submarine boat

803
01:06:31,892 --> 01:06:33,416
and the
energy that propels it?

804
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:34,620
They tried.

805
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:37,664
They cast me in a prison,
and when they failed...

806
01:06:43,004 --> 01:06:44,767
When they failed,

807
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:49,299
they tortured my wife
and young son to death.

808
01:06:58,251 --> 01:07:02,847
Do you know the meaning
of love, professor?

809
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:05,083
I believe I do.

810
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:10,652
What you fail to understand...
is the power of hate.

811
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:16,895
It can fill the heart...
as surely as love can.

812
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:18,960
I'm sorry for you.

813
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:22,633
It's a bitter substitute.

814
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:46,922
Oh, the -- the explosions

815
01:07:46,998 --> 01:07:48,555
scattered everything
all over the place.

816
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:50,896
I was just trying
to tidy up.

817
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:56,231
Professor, I-I'd like
to speak to you.

818
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:57,238
About what?

819
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:58,774
Well, I, I believe --

820
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,640
I believe things
have gone far enough.

821
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:05,239
Murder means nothing to him.
I, I think he enjoys it.

822
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:08,943
You're sure of that, are you?
Quite sure?

823
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,782
Well, I, I can only judge him
by -- by what I observed.

824
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,788
It is not your place
to judge.

825
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,847
You don't know anything
about the captain.

826
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,190
He's already said
that he has use for me,

827
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,822
but what's more important,
the world has a use for him,

828
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,729
and I must make him
understand that.

829
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,858
And when he does,

830
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,129
I assure you that
he will judge himself

831
01:08:28,203 --> 01:08:30,228
far more harshly
than you ever can.

832
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:31,670
ls that clear?

833
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,208
Whatever you say, Captain.

834
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:37,005
Now, please go out
and leave me alone.

835
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:44,879
What did you call me?
Captain?

836
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:46,215
Yes, I did.

837
01:08:46,286 --> 01:08:49,221
And I must say there is
a certain resemblance.

838
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,269
Seen enough?

839
01:09:04,338 --> 01:09:06,635
I want to talk to you.

840
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:09,175
You little spyin' hyena.

841
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,040
Did the professor
put you up to this?

842
01:09:11,111 --> 01:09:12,908
It's the professor
I want to tell you about.

843
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,969
You were right.

844
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:16,015
Nemo has won him over
completely.

845
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,277
You bet I was right.

846
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:19,546
And I was right
about you spyin' on me.

847
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,645
Look, Ned,
I, I've known all along

848
01:09:21,722 --> 01:09:23,713
that you were stealing food
and treasure.

849
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,588
I didn't tell a soul.
I was glad you did it.

850
01:09:26,659 --> 01:09:27,785
We may need it.

851
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,828
We? Since when
do I need you?

852
01:09:29,896 --> 01:09:31,761
- We need each other.
- Ha!

853
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:34,391
Ned,
I, I want to be friends.

854
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:38,426
"I want to be friends"?
I want to escape.

855
01:09:38,504 --> 01:09:40,267
So do I -- with you.

856
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:42,204
And we have to save
the professor,

857
01:09:42,275 --> 01:09:43,367
in spite of himself.

858
01:09:43,443 --> 01:09:45,672
You once said
you had a plan.

859
01:09:45,744 --> 01:09:47,644
Have you?

860
01:09:47,712 --> 01:09:49,475
Yeah, I got a plan.

861
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:50,742
Well?

862
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:52,374
Trouble is, it won't work.

863
01:09:52,451 --> 01:09:55,318
I can't figure
how they navigate this barge!

864
01:09:55,387 --> 01:09:56,581
Nothing's written down --

865
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:58,919
no courses, no bearings,
nothin',

866
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,753
If we can only figure
where we're headin',

867
01:10:00,826 --> 01:10:02,020
we'd have a chance.

868
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:03,219
- That's no problem.
- Hmm?

869
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:05,524
When I was reading
the professor's journal,

870
01:10:05,596 --> 01:10:07,291
I, I learned
about Nemo's plans.

871
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:09,594
We're heading for a place
called Vulcania.

872
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:12,829
Vulcania?

873
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:15,269
Yeah, that's --
that's Nemo's base.

874
01:10:15,339 --> 01:10:16,806
Well,
why didn't you say so?

875
01:10:16,874 --> 01:10:18,865
This is
what I've been waitin' for!

876
01:10:18,943 --> 01:10:20,570
- It was?
- Sure!

877
01:10:20,644 --> 01:10:22,702
Vulcania...

878
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:25,145
Well, I gotta take a look
at those charts.

879
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:29,048
Why not?

880
01:10:39,362 --> 01:10:41,193
I'll need all hands.

881
01:10:41,264 --> 01:10:42,855
You keep a watch.

882
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:44,159
Aye, sir.

883
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,718
Keep your eye peeled
for the mate.

884
01:11:07,788 --> 01:11:09,619
Aye, sir.

885
01:11:43,455 --> 01:11:46,151
Hey, Ned. Ned.

886
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:48,284
Put them back.
He's coming.

887
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,529
- Shh, Shh,
- All right, all right.

888
01:11:56,602 --> 01:11:57,626
Hurry up.

889
01:11:57,703 --> 01:11:59,567
Hurry up. He's coming.

890
01:12:22,326 --> 01:12:25,762
Phew.
That was close, mate.

891
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:27,558
Very.

892
01:12:29,566 --> 01:12:33,229
Hey...
This is Nemo's cabin.

893
01:12:33,303 --> 01:12:35,134
Yeah.

894
01:12:35,205 --> 01:12:37,764
He does do right well
for himself.

895
01:12:39,775 --> 01:12:41,640
Maybe...

896
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:46,372
Ned,
let's get out of here.

897
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:49,543
If they find us
in his cabin, we --

898
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:50,711
What is it?

899
01:12:50,786 --> 01:12:52,811
Quick, give me
a pen and paper, quick.

900
01:12:52,888 --> 01:12:56,255
- What for?
- I think I found somethin'.

901
01:12:56,325 --> 01:12:58,315
Ned...

902
01:13:00,228 --> 01:13:03,720
See? All the distances
are measured from that point.

903
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:05,698
That's right.
It must be.

904
01:13:31,025 --> 01:13:33,016
Get me
those calendars, quick.

905
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:35,288
Let's see if I can
work this out now.

906
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:37,329
Longitude...

907
01:13:38,898 --> 01:13:40,092
Quiet. Quiet.

908
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,431
Quiet!
Please be quiet, will ya?

909
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,528
Don't bark so much.
Shh,

910
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,368
Here, here.
Have a cigar.

911
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,067
Hey, she likes 'em,

912
01:13:49,142 --> 01:13:50,666
You want another?
Give me a kiss.

913
01:13:50,743 --> 01:13:52,734
You have quite a way
with animals, huh?

914
01:13:52,812 --> 01:13:55,143
I do better with women,
and they don't eat cigars --

915
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:56,805
Shh, Be quiet!

916
01:13:56,882 --> 01:13:58,008
You feed her. Here.

917
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:00,142
All right.
I'll give you a cigar.

918
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:02,448
All right.
Here, have one. You see?

919
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:26,943
Yes, I love you, too.
I'll find you some more.

920
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:29,241
Yes. I'll find you
some more.

921
01:14:29,313 --> 01:14:31,247
Stop playin' with her.

922
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:33,248
- I'm not playing.
- Shh, shh, shh,

923
01:14:33,316 --> 01:14:34,977
Here.

924
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:37,417
You just be quiet.
Be a nice girl.

925
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:39,819
Here. Eat them slowly.
You don't have to inhale them.

926
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:40,913
Here.

927
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:52,998
We'll complete repairs at base.

928
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:54,797
He's comin',

929
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:55,962
Let's go.

930
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:57,835
Resume speed at 50 fathoms.

931
01:14:57,906 --> 01:15:00,374
Resume speed at 50 fathoms.

932
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:14,213
Esmay.

933
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:18,415
I've got to do some research.

934
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:20,120
I'll need some specimens.
Get 'em.

935
01:15:20,194 --> 01:15:22,059
Specimens? What kind?

936
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:24,064
The ones in bottles.
Go on, beat it.

937
01:15:24,132 --> 01:15:25,793
And don't get caught.

938
01:15:25,867 --> 01:15:26,925
No.

939
01:15:35,675 --> 01:15:37,768
Well, Ned, you've got
everything here,

940
01:15:37,844 --> 01:15:39,971
from the rarest nudibranchs
to oysters.

941
01:15:40,046 --> 01:15:41,308
Oysters are out of season.

942
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:42,905
Dump 'em in the sink --
all of 'em.

943
01:15:42,983 --> 01:15:44,450
I just want the bottles.

944
01:15:44,518 --> 01:15:47,919
You can't do that.
These are priceless.

945
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:50,421
Ned, you're not thinking of
putting messages

946
01:15:50,489 --> 01:15:52,218
into these bottles?

947
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:54,987
Why, that went out
with Robinson Crusoe.

948
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,893
You've forgotten,
this is the 19th century.

949
01:15:57,963 --> 01:16:00,431
Somethin' else I forgot.

950
01:16:02,535 --> 01:16:03,627
Ooh,

951
01:16:03,702 --> 01:16:05,067
That's for spyin' on me.

952
01:16:05,137 --> 01:16:07,765
Don't let me catch you paddin'
the shadow of my stern again.

953
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,068
Remember that.

954
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:15,636
I don't like bashin' anybody,
but you had it comin', lad.

955
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:19,375
And I thought
we were friends.

956
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,850
Sure we're friends.

957
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,013
Go ahead. Hit me.

958
01:16:24,088 --> 01:16:25,350
Hmm?

959
01:16:25,423 --> 01:16:26,981
- Hit me.
- Do you mean that?

960
01:16:27,058 --> 01:16:30,185
Sure, go ahead.
You can't miss it.

961
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,989
Ooh, 

962
01:16:32,062 --> 01:16:35,225
Now we are friends.

963
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,529
Oh, all right, shipmate.

964
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,125
Ooh. 

965
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:41,797
Well, now I'll tell you
what I had on my mind.

966
01:16:41,872 --> 01:16:44,067
This may be old stuff,
tossin' messages off in bottles

967
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,608
and settin' 'em adrift,

968
01:16:45,676 --> 01:16:47,610
but I've heard of it
workin'.

969
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:51,538
- Alcohol.
- Very pure alcohol.

970
01:16:51,614 --> 01:16:55,141
We'll just drain the pollywogs
out and save the grog.

971
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,450
But, Ned...

972
01:16:58,521 --> 01:17:00,216
It's -- It's priceless.

973
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:02,382
Ohh.

974
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,120
Anyhow --
here, hold this, lad --

975
01:17:05,194 --> 01:17:08,526
this chap I knew got
shipwrecked in the Bahamas --

976
01:17:08,597 --> 01:17:12,192
him and a lady passenger
alone on an island.

977
01:17:12,267 --> 01:17:14,599
Well, they had plenty of time
on their hands,

978
01:17:14,669 --> 01:17:16,466
so they began writin' notes,

979
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:18,028
puttin' 'em
in old rum bottles,

980
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:19,664
and settin' 'em adrift.

981
01:17:19,741 --> 01:17:21,675
One of them got through, too,
and they was rescued.

982
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:23,438
Oh.

983
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:31,518
Easy. What is it?

984
01:17:34,588 --> 01:17:36,647
I swallowed it.

985
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:41,058
There was a flabellina oculina
in there.

986
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:43,062
Poor thing.

987
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:48,433
Flabellina oculina.

988
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:43,243
She won't answer
her helm, sir.

989
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,415
Astern full,

990
01:18:58,435 --> 01:19:01,302
- What's happened now?
- We seem to have run aground.

991
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:02,928
Hey, what's happened?

992
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:04,370
An accident, Captain?

993
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,466
An incident. Our faulty rudders
put us on a reef.

994
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:09,909
The tide will float us free
by evening.

995
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:11,947
Professor, we're off
the coast of New Guinea.

996
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,276
Would you like to go ashore?

997
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:14,782
No, thank you.

998
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,284
The last time we went ashore,
it was a prelude to murder.

999
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:21,779
- Check for leaks.
- Aye, sir.

1000
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:27,993
Throwin' away
a chance like that --

1001
01:19:28,062 --> 01:19:30,963
the professor's losin'
his ballast.

1002
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:44,038
Smell it --
sweet as an angel's kiss.

1003
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:48,775
Dry land, mate,
coconuts, mangoes, and...

1004
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:52,182
native girls
hungry for affection.

1005
01:19:52,252 --> 01:19:54,880
I'd give anything to shake hands
with a tree again.

1006
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:57,685
So would I.
And so would the professor.

1007
01:19:57,758 --> 01:20:00,920
I, I know how badly
he wants to collect specimens,

1008
01:20:00,993 --> 01:20:03,655
but he won't ask
any favors from Nemo.

1009
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:06,289
What's wrong
with you goin' instead?

1010
01:20:06,365 --> 01:20:08,799
Nothing.
What about you?

1011
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:12,099
Me?
I'm a collectin' fool.

1012
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:14,230
There's no harm in asking.

1013
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:18,437
No harm at all, mate.

1014
01:20:24,082 --> 01:20:25,413
Captain, I, I wondered,

1015
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:28,247
as long as the professor
is not going ashore,

1016
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,184
if I could go
in his place.

1017
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:31,984
I-I'd like to collect
some specimens and --

1018
01:20:32,057 --> 01:20:33,388
and take some notes.

1019
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,618
You feel qualified?

1020
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:35,886
Qualified?

1021
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,188
Why, for years,

1022
01:20:37,262 --> 01:20:39,559
the professor and I
have been working together.

1023
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,530
And I can row, sir --
got a strong back.

1024
01:20:41,598 --> 01:20:43,156
And a strong desire
to escape.

1025
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:47,567
Who, me? I'm no deserter.
Happy to be aboard, sir.

1026
01:20:47,638 --> 01:20:49,230
Very well.
Permission granted.

1027
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:50,136
Thank you, sir.

1028
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:51,606
But stay on the beach.

1029
01:20:51,675 --> 01:20:53,734
The natives over there
are cannibals.

1030
01:20:53,811 --> 01:20:55,608
They eat liars
with the same enthusiasm

1031
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,271
as they eat honest men.

1032
01:20:57,347 --> 01:20:58,506
Break out the skip.

1033
01:20:58,581 --> 01:21:00,481
Aye, sir.
Break out the skip.

1034
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:10,249
Shove off!

1035
01:21:53,134 --> 01:21:56,330
I don't see any native girls
hungry for affection.

1036
01:21:56,402 --> 01:21:57,869
Take it easy.

1037
01:21:59,105 --> 01:22:02,768
Hey, Ned, we're not
supposed to leave the beach.

1038
01:22:02,842 --> 01:22:05,106
Who's leavin' it?

1039
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,212
Hey! 

1040
01:22:22,661 --> 01:22:24,561
- Come here, quick!
- What is it?

1041
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,757
Look -- a trail
through the jungle.

1042
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:28,959
You had this in mind
all the time.

1043
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:30,126
You want to escape.

1044
01:22:30,202 --> 01:22:31,726
What do you say, mate?
It's a cinch.

1045
01:22:31,803 --> 01:22:32,861
I don't think so,

1046
01:22:32,938 --> 01:22:34,428
or Nemo wouldn't have
let us come ashore.

1047
01:22:34,506 --> 01:22:35,733
Don't forget the cannibals.

1048
01:22:35,806 --> 01:22:38,434
Oh, belay the cannibals.
He said that to scare us.

1049
01:22:38,509 --> 01:22:42,172
Besides, I, I couldn't leave
the professor.

1050
01:22:42,246 --> 01:22:43,645
I figured that.

1051
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:46,547
Just look at me.
I can't get through that jungle.

1052
01:22:46,617 --> 01:22:49,279
You'll go faster alone.
Hope you make it, Ned.

1053
01:22:49,353 --> 01:22:50,843
I'll make it, all right,

1054
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:54,016
and I'll have every gunboat
in the Navy huntin' ol' Nemo.

1055
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,081
Just wait.
We'll be laughin' about this,

1056
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,888
havin' a drink together
in Frisco.

1057
01:22:57,961 --> 01:22:59,622
Good luck, Ned.

1058
01:23:03,033 --> 01:23:05,661
Ohh. Give my best
to the professor.

1059
01:25:04,282 --> 01:25:05,909
Hey!

1060
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:11,587
Hey! Wait for me!

1061
01:25:14,925 --> 01:25:17,416
Hey!

1062
01:25:24,501 --> 01:25:26,594
Wait for me!

1063
01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:30,802
Hey!

1064
01:25:33,843 --> 01:25:35,208
Hey!

1065
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,709
Hey!

1066
01:26:58,357 --> 01:26:59,984
Natives -- cannibals.

1067
01:27:00,058 --> 01:27:01,992
Hundreds of cannibals.

1068
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,460
Captain, Captain,
scores of boats with cannibals.

1069
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:06,520
- Captain, we're under attack!
- Naturally.

1070
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,656
Since you invaded their privacy,

1071
01:27:08,733 --> 01:27:10,496
they have every right
to invade ours.

1072
01:27:22,046 --> 01:27:24,036
They're coming aboard,
Captain.

1073
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:25,979
Get me a harpoon, quick.
Close the hatch,

1074
01:27:26,049 --> 01:27:28,210
I'll give the commands
on this boat, Mr. Land.

1075
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,183
Stand aside.

1076
01:27:29,252 --> 01:27:30,549
Aye, sir.

1077
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:22,926
I gotta see this.

1078
01:28:23,003 --> 01:28:25,437
This is amazing.

1079
01:28:55,668 --> 01:28:56,464
Hey, Captain,

1080
01:28:56,536 --> 01:28:58,868
that's one way to keep
guests from dropping in.

1081
01:28:58,938 --> 01:29:01,201
A mild charge of electricity,
Mr. Land --

1082
01:29:01,273 --> 01:29:03,207
not very hospitable,
but harmless.

1083
01:29:03,275 --> 01:29:05,266
And speaking of hospitality,

1084
01:29:05,343 --> 01:29:07,777
may I say that you have abused
mine for the last time?

1085
01:29:07,846 --> 01:29:08,710
Well, how's that?

1086
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,372
You've continuously
disobeyed my orders.

1087
01:29:10,448 --> 01:29:11,210
Who, me?

1088
01:29:11,283 --> 01:29:13,251
I told you once
the fate of prisoners.

1089
01:29:13,318 --> 01:29:15,684
But since you insist
on being treated as one,

1090
01:29:15,754 --> 01:29:17,654
I have no choice
but to oblige you.

1091
01:29:17,722 --> 01:29:19,087
- Take him in charge.
- Aye, sir.

1092
01:29:19,157 --> 01:29:21,021
Now, wait a minute.
What's this all about, Captain?

1093
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:22,558
You left the beach
with the intention of escaping.

1094
01:29:22,626 --> 01:29:23,820
The only reason you came back

1095
01:29:23,894 --> 01:29:25,452
is because the natives
forced you to.

1096
01:29:25,529 --> 01:29:27,190
You're going to regret
that choice, Mr. Land.

1097
01:29:27,264 --> 01:29:29,164
MAN #2 : Ship rounding
the headland, sir.

1098
01:29:29,233 --> 01:29:30,757
When we clear this reef,

1099
01:29:30,834 --> 01:29:33,064
I'll see that you trouble
my existence no longer.

1100
01:29:33,137 --> 01:29:34,900
I should have taken my chances
with the cannibals.

1101
01:29:38,442 --> 01:29:40,636
A warship.

1102
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:42,905
- A warship?!
- Put him under guard below.

1103
01:29:42,979 --> 01:29:44,173
Take him below.

1104
01:29:44,247 --> 01:29:46,340
All engines ready.

1105
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:48,043
We must break free
of the reef.

1106
01:29:48,117 --> 01:29:49,049
Aye, sir.

1107
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:50,745
Lighten ship
and drop all ballasts.

1108
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:54,422
Get below! They'll be
shelling us in a moment.

1109
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,151
Aye, sir.

1110
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:59,125
Astern full.

1111
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:00,593
Astern full it is, sir.

1112
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,838
Hold it! 
Let me out of this!

1113
01:30:16,478 --> 01:30:18,877
Let me out
of this glory hole!

1114
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:22,746
Professor, professor!

1115
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:24,648
A warship, professor.

1116
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,209
Warship?!

1117
01:30:48,008 --> 01:30:50,067
We're breaking out.

1118
01:31:03,489 --> 01:31:06,390
- Man the watertight doors.
- Aye, sir.

1119
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:08,790
Man the watertight door.

1120
01:31:25,877 --> 01:31:28,539
Hey, they're --
they're shutting the door.

1121
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:30,478
Wait!

1122
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:33,377
Wait!

1123
01:31:34,551 --> 01:31:35,813
Let us out!

1124
01:32:06,515 --> 01:32:08,244
Wait! We are in here!

1125
01:32:08,317 --> 01:32:10,251
Wait!

1126
01:32:13,521 --> 01:32:16,046
Take the wheel.

1127
01:32:51,225 --> 01:32:53,351
How much water
in the power compartment?

1128
01:32:53,426 --> 01:32:55,394
5 feet and rising, sir.

1129
01:32:58,765 --> 01:33:00,926
Break out a spare shaft.

1130
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,264
- Break out a spare shaft.
- We must use leverage.

1131
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:07,404
Bring it thwartships.

1132
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:15,641
Put the aft end
down to the leak.

1133
01:33:15,714 --> 01:33:17,477
And lift with the hoist.

1134
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:26,656
Take up the slack.

1135
01:33:29,561 --> 01:33:31,721
Make a strain.

1136
01:33:50,713 --> 01:33:52,340
There's no pressure.

1137
01:33:53,516 --> 01:33:54,608
The dials are not moving.

1138
01:33:54,684 --> 01:33:56,618
We've gone too deep.

1139
01:34:15,437 --> 01:34:17,598
Stand by with braces.

1140
01:34:17,673 --> 01:34:19,368
Aye, sir.

1141
01:34:33,387 --> 01:34:34,820
Quick, braces.

1142
01:34:43,231 --> 01:34:45,165
Braces in place, sir.

1143
01:34:45,233 --> 01:34:48,258
Man your stations.
Start engines.

1144
01:35:18,364 --> 01:35:20,491
The air will clear now that
the fans are operating again.

1145
01:35:20,566 --> 01:35:21,590
Are you all right?

1146
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:22,759
Yes, thank you --
much better.

1147
01:35:22,835 --> 01:35:23,961
Have we stopped sinking?

1148
01:35:24,036 --> 01:35:26,196
Fortunately...
There are limits

1149
01:35:26,271 --> 01:35:29,365
beyond which man and his
puny efforts cannot survive.

1150
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,431
We exceeded them
by 5,000 feet.

1151
01:35:31,509 --> 01:35:35,138
We are deeper now
than man has ever been before.

1152
01:35:58,936 --> 01:36:01,131
Giant squid astern, sir!

1153
01:36:05,207 --> 01:36:08,040
Emergency speed, all engines!

1154
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:20,179
We're found,
Full repeller charge.

1155
01:36:20,256 --> 01:36:21,985
Aye, sir.

1156
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,709
Try another charge.

1157
01:36:47,781 --> 01:36:49,442
Sorry, sir.
All elements burned out.

1158
01:36:49,516 --> 01:36:51,484
Then we shall have to fight
on the surface.

1159
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:53,281
Assemble all hands
in the charge room.

1160
01:36:53,354 --> 01:36:54,787
Aye, sir.

1161
01:36:54,855 --> 01:36:56,015
Drop all ballasts.

1162
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:58,524
Diving controls,
full "out" position.

1163
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:31,416
We'll be fighting
at close quarters

1164
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,050
with the most tenacious
of all sea beasts.

1165
01:37:34,126 --> 01:37:35,753
Stay clear of the tentacles.

1166
01:37:35,827 --> 01:37:38,022
They'll seize anything
within reach

1167
01:37:38,096 --> 01:37:39,563
and hang on to the death.

1168
01:37:39,631 --> 01:37:42,861
The only vital spot
is directly between the eyes.

1169
01:37:42,933 --> 01:37:45,299
40 feet
and surfacing, sir.

1170
01:37:45,369 --> 01:37:47,234
Stand by.

1171
01:38:08,892 --> 01:38:10,484
Stay back!

1172
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:25,298
Quick, the stern hatch.

1173
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:57,634
Take your men
down the starboard side!

1174
01:38:57,705 --> 01:38:59,434
You men, come with me!

1175
01:39:09,984 --> 01:39:11,508
Give me a harpoon,

1176
01:39:11,586 --> 01:39:13,781
I'll work behind it.

1177
01:39:15,556 --> 01:39:18,183
Stay back here!

1178
01:39:26,766 --> 01:39:29,758
Stand clear!

1179
01:40:04,836 --> 01:40:07,828
Throw me another arrow!

1180
01:40:34,964 --> 01:40:36,431
Watch it!

1181
01:40:36,499 --> 01:40:38,490
Watch it! Aah,

1182
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,632
Your hand,

1183
01:41:35,855 --> 01:41:37,345
No! No!

1184
01:41:37,423 --> 01:41:38,822
Aaah, Ugh,

1185
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:40,153
Ugh, Ugh,

1186
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:53,028
Ugh,

1187
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:54,732
Ugh,

1188
01:42:00,045 --> 01:42:02,013
Well, I'll be --

1189
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,048
Are you hurt bad, mate?

1190
01:42:06,785 --> 01:42:08,309
What's up?

1191
01:42:08,387 --> 01:42:10,014
What happened?

1192
01:42:18,729 --> 01:42:19,718
Aaah,

1193
01:43:52,451 --> 01:43:56,285
Mr. Land...

1194
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:59,222
You saved my life.

1195
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:00,588
Why?

1196
01:44:02,528 --> 01:44:05,622
That's a good question.

1197
01:44:07,565 --> 01:44:09,658
Well, there's only one thing
a fella can do

1198
01:44:09,734 --> 01:44:11,702
when he's made a mistake
as big as this.

1199
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:14,034
What?

1200
01:44:14,105 --> 01:44:16,505
Get drunk.

1201
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:31,548
Huh?

1202
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:38,225
Yep, glad to hear --
see you like music, too, huh?

1203
01:44:38,295 --> 01:44:40,229
We got a lot in common.

1204
01:44:43,801 --> 01:44:45,700
Thank you, baby.

1205
01:44:45,768 --> 01:44:47,702
How 'bout a drink, huh?

1206
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:49,499
Okay. 

1207
01:44:49,572 --> 01:44:53,975
Hey, would you like
a-a flabellina oculina?

1208
01:44:54,043 --> 01:44:55,977
I've tried 'em --
very good.

1209
01:45:04,586 --> 01:45:05,883
Ahh,

1210
01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:07,216
Try some?

1211
01:45:07,289 --> 01:45:09,086
Ahh,

1212
01:45:11,026 --> 01:45:13,790
You know, Esmeralda, you're
the only one on this barge

1213
01:45:13,862 --> 01:45:15,193
that understands me.

1214
01:45:15,263 --> 01:45:16,696
Give us a kiss.

1215
01:45:20,469 --> 01:45:22,699
Your whiskers tickle.
Let me see your whiskers.

1216
01:45:22,771 --> 01:45:24,931
Hey, you oughta shave,
honey.

1217
01:45:25,005 --> 01:45:26,768
You're beginnin'
to look like Nemo.

1218
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:28,103
Let's try it again.

1219
01:45:28,175 --> 01:45:29,506
Oh, come on.
Let's try it again.

1220
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:51,590
Huh?

1221
01:45:58,137 --> 01:46:00,697
Not so loud, Ned.
Not so loud.

1222
01:46:00,773 --> 01:46:03,502
Hey, she loves
those flabellina oculina!

1223
01:46:03,575 --> 01:46:05,805
I am happy you're out
of jail, Ned.

1224
01:46:05,878 --> 01:46:07,709
Yeah, I got the run
of the ship.

1225
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:08,803
Big-hearted Nemo!

1226
01:46:08,881 --> 01:46:10,906
Well, the professor's
very happy, too.

1227
01:46:10,983 --> 01:46:12,575
After all,
it's the first time

1228
01:46:12,651 --> 01:46:14,642
that Nemo has shown
any gratitude.

1229
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,881
We don't want none
of his gratitude!

1230
01:46:16,955 --> 01:46:18,980
We don't want none
of his gratitude!

1231
01:46:19,057 --> 01:46:20,547
This is awful,

1232
01:46:20,626 --> 01:46:22,786
You can tell him that
for the both of us!

1233
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,657
Do we, Esmeralda, huh?

1234
01:46:25,897 --> 01:46:27,387
Come on.

1235
01:46:27,465 --> 01:46:29,399
We're gonna take
a little nap here.

1236
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:32,129
Here --
you lie down there.

1237
01:46:32,203 --> 01:46:35,263
Cover yourself up good.
I don't want you to catch cold.

1238
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:07,825
My apprentice tells me
you have taken my journal.

1239
01:47:07,903 --> 01:47:09,803
May I ask why?

1240
01:47:09,872 --> 01:47:11,635
I keep no log
on The Nautilus,

1241
01:47:11,707 --> 01:47:14,175
and I was frankly curious
to read your account

1242
01:47:14,243 --> 01:47:15,471
of the giant squid --

1243
01:47:15,544 --> 01:47:17,944
in particular,
my narrow escape and rescue.

1244
01:47:18,013 --> 01:47:20,480
According to you,
Mr. Land is a hero

1245
01:47:20,548 --> 01:47:23,244
in the best tradition
of cheap fiction.

1246
01:47:23,318 --> 01:47:24,842
That can only be true

1247
01:47:24,919 --> 01:47:27,114
if you consider
your life cheap, Captain.

1248
01:47:27,188 --> 01:47:30,453
I might have expected you
to say that.

1249
01:47:30,525 --> 01:47:32,789
Actually, he regrets
saving my life

1250
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:35,226
as much as I would regret
saving his.

1251
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:38,025
The only difference is
that I wouldn't have tried.

1252
01:47:38,098 --> 01:47:40,566
Then it is that difference
that gives Ned Land

1253
01:47:40,634 --> 01:47:43,899
the human dignity
you no longer possess.

1254
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:45,962
May I tell you something?

1255
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:48,507
You seem determined to.
Go ahead.

1256
01:47:48,575 --> 01:47:50,907
You protest too much.

1257
01:47:50,978 --> 01:47:54,038
I know you were deeply touched
by Ned's gesture,

1258
01:47:54,114 --> 01:47:56,105
but you are ashamed
to admit it.

1259
01:47:56,183 --> 01:47:58,878
You cannot tolerate
the faith in humanity,

1260
01:47:58,951 --> 01:48:00,976
because if you do,
all this --

1261
01:48:01,053 --> 01:48:03,453
the structure
of your very existence,

1262
01:48:03,522 --> 01:48:06,047
which you built on hate
and vengeance --

1263
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:09,754
all this will collapse around
the naked lie of your life.

1264
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:11,421
You are a beaten man

1265
01:48:11,497 --> 01:48:14,523
at war with the dictates
of his heart.

1266
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:17,397
And you are
a very gullible man, professor.

1267
01:48:17,469 --> 01:48:18,766
- Gullible?
- Yes.

1268
01:48:18,837 --> 01:48:21,431
You're too easily swayed
by sentiment,

1269
01:48:21,506 --> 01:48:24,737
individual good deeds over bad,
the crude extremes.

1270
01:48:24,809 --> 01:48:26,106
You oversimplify matters.

1271
01:48:26,177 --> 01:48:28,168
The world
is more complex than that,

1272
01:48:28,246 --> 01:48:30,806
and good must not be measured
on a scale as small

1273
01:48:30,882 --> 01:48:32,941
as Mr. Land's brash heroics.

1274
01:48:33,018 --> 01:48:36,350
What he would do one day,
he would gladly undo the next.

1275
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:37,478
To be of benefit,

1276
01:48:37,554 --> 01:48:39,886
goodness must be constant,
forever building.

1277
01:48:39,957 --> 01:48:42,118
It must have strength.

1278
01:48:42,192 --> 01:48:44,126
I'm afraid what you seek
is perfection.

1279
01:48:44,194 --> 01:48:45,456
You will never find it.

1280
01:48:45,529 --> 01:48:47,793
I have already found it...

1281
01:48:49,733 --> 01:48:51,360
...here.

1282
01:48:51,435 --> 01:48:54,268
It is the world outside
that is imperfect.

1283
01:48:54,338 --> 01:48:58,273
If men and nations had this
goodness that I speak of,

1284
01:48:58,341 --> 01:49:01,242
I would be willing
to share all this --

1285
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:04,939
my records, everything.

1286
01:49:05,014 --> 01:49:06,948
Have you considered
sharing it?

1287
01:49:07,016 --> 01:49:10,179
That's the only reason that
you're alive today, professor.

1288
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:12,619
From the moment that you came
aboard The Nautilus,

1289
01:49:12,689 --> 01:49:14,713
I had hoped that you would be
the key to a plan

1290
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:16,052
that I had in mind.

1291
01:49:16,124 --> 01:49:18,888
I had intended using you
as an emissary.

1292
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:23,193
But now I don't know.

1293
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:25,529
ls it that
you don't trust me?

1294
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,431
No!

1295
01:49:27,502 --> 01:49:30,164
But you are
ever the optimist.

1296
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:32,798
Do you really believe
they would lay down their arms

1297
01:49:32,874 --> 01:49:34,465
and abolish
their slave camps?

1298
01:49:34,542 --> 01:49:37,136
Yes, I think
I could persuade them.

1299
01:49:37,211 --> 01:49:38,906
Let me try.

1300
01:49:42,249 --> 01:49:43,807
We're nearing Vulcania.

1301
01:49:43,884 --> 01:49:46,910
I want you to see
the extent of these secrets

1302
01:49:46,987 --> 01:49:49,251
for which
they have hounded me,

1303
01:49:49,323 --> 01:49:53,315
the knowledge which costs the
lives of those dearest to me,

1304
01:49:53,393 --> 01:49:56,157
the power
which is still mine --

1305
01:49:56,229 --> 01:49:59,221
enough energy
to lift mankind

1306
01:49:59,299 --> 01:50:03,292
from the depths of Hell
into Heaven...

1307
01:50:03,369 --> 01:50:06,099
or destroy it.

1308
01:50:06,172 --> 01:50:08,936
Perhaps then you will feel
less inclined

1309
01:50:09,008 --> 01:50:10,908
to barter such a prize.

1310
01:50:10,977 --> 01:50:13,001
We will discuss it
at that time.

1311
01:50:17,549 --> 01:50:19,483
We've raised
the island, sir.

1312
01:50:19,551 --> 01:50:20,848
Why have we stopped?

1313
01:50:20,919 --> 01:50:23,149
There are warships ahead.

1314
01:50:23,222 --> 01:50:25,053
Bearing what flag?

1315
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:27,251
No flag, sir.

1316
01:50:27,326 --> 01:50:29,021
Very well.

1317
01:50:33,231 --> 01:50:34,994
There's your answer,
professor.

1318
01:50:35,066 --> 01:50:37,466
We've been ambushed
by the very forces

1319
01:50:37,535 --> 01:50:38,695
that you wish to trade with.

1320
01:50:48,514 --> 01:50:51,641
Their boarding parties
have already landed.

1321
01:50:51,717 --> 01:50:55,881
This is a dark hour
for history, professor.

1322
01:50:55,954 --> 01:50:58,422
They'll be over the summit
in half an hour, sir.

1323
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:00,788
I estimate 20 minutes.

1324
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:06,221
Everything must be destroyed
before they reach the lagoon.

1325
01:51:06,298 --> 01:51:07,560
Ready to dive.

1326
01:51:07,633 --> 01:51:08,657
Aye, sir.

1327
01:51:08,734 --> 01:51:10,223
Diving stations!

1328
01:51:10,301 --> 01:51:11,427
Ahead full,

1329
01:51:11,502 --> 01:51:13,402
Diving stations!

1330
01:51:18,142 --> 01:51:19,939
Four degrees down,

1331
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:32,238
All engines stop!

1332
01:52:33,447 --> 01:52:35,176
- Break out the skiff!
- Aye, sir.

1333
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:42,749
What's all the excitement,
Captain?

1334
01:52:42,823 --> 01:52:44,188
What is it, professor?

1335
01:52:44,257 --> 01:52:45,656
We are at the base,

1336
01:52:45,726 --> 01:52:48,250
and the island is surrounded
by warships.

1337
01:52:48,327 --> 01:52:49,760
By warships?

1338
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:50,955
Warships!

1339
01:52:58,370 --> 01:53:00,133
Shove off!

1340
01:53:00,206 --> 01:53:02,697
Have everything
in readiness aboard,

1341
01:53:02,775 --> 01:53:05,334
Aye, sir!

1342
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:07,173
Take cover!

1343
01:53:16,554 --> 01:53:17,748
Look!

1344
01:53:17,822 --> 01:53:19,449
They're coming,

1345
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,904
I'm gonna let 'em know
we're here.

1346
01:53:35,973 --> 01:53:38,032
No, Ned, Don't!

1347
01:53:39,309 --> 01:53:41,573
Hey! Hey!

1348
01:53:41,645 --> 01:53:44,078
You up there!
We're friends!

1349
01:53:44,147 --> 01:53:47,413
Don't shoot!
We're friends, I tell ya!

1350
01:53:47,484 --> 01:53:49,748
We're the ones that threw
the bottles over!

1351
01:53:51,789 --> 01:53:54,314
Hey! We're friends!

1352
01:53:54,391 --> 01:53:55,881
We sent the messages!

1353
01:54:04,267 --> 01:54:07,668
That's gratitude for ya.
After all we did for 'em.

1354
01:54:07,737 --> 01:54:10,228
Then it was you who decoyed
those warships here.

1355
01:54:10,306 --> 01:54:11,534
Aye, it was.

1356
01:54:11,607 --> 01:54:13,598
Somebody had to strike
a blow for freedom.

1357
01:54:13,676 --> 01:54:16,008
We did what we thought
was right, professor.

1358
01:54:16,078 --> 01:54:17,067
Right?!

1359
01:54:17,146 --> 01:54:18,613
You fools!

1360
01:54:18,681 --> 01:54:20,046
This is going to cost
the world

1361
01:54:20,116 --> 01:54:21,777
the greatest
discoveries of all time!

1362
01:54:21,851 --> 01:54:23,943
He's gone ashore
to destroy everything,

1363
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,815
Hey, professor!

1364
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:30,448
Destroy everything?

1365
01:54:30,525 --> 01:54:33,392
That sounds like he's gonna
plant a bomb or something,

1366
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:06,315
Every man to his station,

1367
01:55:06,426 --> 01:55:09,486
Every man to his station,

1368
01:55:42,927 --> 01:55:45,487
Stand by engines!
Prepare for diving,

1369
01:55:45,563 --> 01:55:48,088
Aye, sir!
Prepare for diving,

1370
01:55:48,165 --> 01:55:49,689
Shall I take over?

1371
01:55:53,471 --> 01:55:54,529
Half ahead,

1372
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,367
Four degrees down.

1373
01:56:21,530 --> 01:56:23,464
Ahead full,

1374
01:57:28,494 --> 01:57:30,655
Slow our engines.

1375
01:57:32,832 --> 01:57:36,323
All controls
eight degrees down.

1376
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:57,119
Lash the wheel.

1377
01:57:57,187 --> 01:57:58,245
Aye, sir.

1378
01:57:58,322 --> 01:57:59,516
Lash the wheel.

1379
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:22,541
Captain.

1380
01:59:04,652 --> 01:59:08,748
We are taking The Nautilus down
for the last time.

1381
01:59:19,899 --> 01:59:22,800
We understand, sir.
And we're with you.

1382
01:59:22,869 --> 01:59:25,064
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.

1383
01:59:25,138 --> 01:59:27,129
What's that got to do
with us?

1384
01:59:27,207 --> 01:59:30,665
I am dying, and The Nautilus
is dying with me.

1385
01:59:30,742 --> 01:59:32,437
Professor.

1386
01:59:32,511 --> 01:59:33,910
Yes?

1387
01:59:33,979 --> 01:59:35,947
In a matter of minutes,

1388
01:59:36,014 --> 01:59:39,950
an explosion such as
the world has never known

1389
01:59:40,018 --> 01:59:44,751
will destroy my island...
and all its works forever.

1390
01:59:44,823 --> 01:59:50,226
That is why I have brought
The Nautilus here...

1391
01:59:50,294 --> 01:59:53,730
to its last deep
resting place.

1392
01:59:53,798 --> 01:59:58,360
Here, at least
we will die in peace.

1393
01:59:58,436 --> 02:00:02,031
Let every man go to his
quarters and remain there.

1394
02:00:02,106 --> 02:00:03,698
Why do you take us down
with you?!

1395
02:00:03,774 --> 02:00:05,173
Lock them
in their quarters.

1396
02:00:05,243 --> 02:00:06,835
Aye, sir.
Take them out!

1397
02:00:06,911 --> 02:00:08,173
I don't want to die!

1398
02:00:08,246 --> 02:00:09,678
Don't let them do it,
professor!

1399
02:00:19,723 --> 02:00:21,247
Captain,

1400
02:00:21,324 --> 02:00:23,349
Captain,
you cannot do this.

1401
02:00:23,426 --> 02:00:26,088
There is more at stake here
than just our lives.

1402
02:00:26,163 --> 02:00:29,154
Yours was a dream
of the future come true.

1403
02:00:29,231 --> 02:00:30,926
I beg you to reconsider.

1404
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,027
A power greater than mine

1405
02:00:35,104 --> 02:00:38,505
makes that impossible.

1406
02:00:38,574 --> 02:00:42,305
But there is hope
for the future.

1407
02:00:42,378 --> 02:00:50,341
When the world is ready...
for a new and better life...

1408
02:00:50,418 --> 02:00:55,549
all this will someday
come to pass...

1409
02:00:55,623 --> 02:00:58,057
in God's good time.

1410
02:01:10,938 --> 02:01:12,530
I'm sorry, Ned.

1411
02:01:12,606 --> 02:01:13,903
Don't give up, mate!

1412
02:01:13,974 --> 02:01:16,135
We're no part
of any suicide pact!

1413
02:01:18,579 --> 02:01:20,308
Put him in his cabin.

1414
02:01:37,463 --> 02:01:38,862
Ugh,

1415
02:02:15,032 --> 02:02:16,761
Ohh,

1416
02:02:19,103 --> 02:02:21,003
Ohh, Ugh, Ugh,

1417
02:02:25,074 --> 02:02:26,507
Ugh,

1418
02:02:31,781 --> 02:02:33,476
Ugh,

1419
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,630
Come on,
I've taken over the ship!

1420
02:03:29,703 --> 02:03:31,398
Let's get outta here!

1421
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:43,840
We're on the surface,
so stand by!

1422
02:03:47,986 --> 02:03:50,477
Let's get the skiff out
and shove off!

1423
02:03:50,556 --> 02:03:52,547
Hey, professor!
Where are you goin'?!

1424
02:03:52,624 --> 02:03:55,024
- My journal,
- The island's gonna blow up any second,

1425
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,857
I must get my journal,

1426
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:21,640
Shove off!

1427
02:04:21,718 --> 02:04:24,516
What's the matter?
Is he hurt?

1428
02:04:25,956 --> 02:04:27,014
Hey, we forgot Essy.

1429
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:29,456
Esmeralda, come on,
Quick, quick!

1430
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:34,954
Come on,
Come on, hurry!

1431
02:04:35,031 --> 02:04:36,362
In the boat.

1432
02:04:36,433 --> 02:04:38,367
Come on, in the boat.

1433
02:05:22,342 --> 02:05:25,869
Thar she blows.

1434
02:05:57,442 --> 02:06:00,900
Sorry I had to wallop you,
professor.

1435
02:06:00,979 --> 02:06:03,948
There wasn't time to stop
for souvenirs.

1436
02:06:05,684 --> 02:06:08,676
Perhaps you did mankind
a service, Ned.

1437
02:06:30,374 --> 02:06:34,742
There is hope for the future.

1438
02:06:34,811 --> 02:06:39,111
And when the world is ready
for a new and better life,

1439
02:06:39,182 --> 02:06:43,346
all this will someday
come to pass...

1440
02:06:43,419 --> 02:06:45,853
in God's good time.
