1
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,364
Hello, Mr Kranz.

2
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,618
- I'd like to redeem my...
- I know! The trombone.

3
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,078
I always keep her
hanging in the window

4
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,582
so when you walk by you can
see she is still there.

5
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,250
I keep my eyes on her.

6
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,670
Say, Mr Miller, where'd you
got the money this time?

7
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:14,175
- Working in a gas station.
- And now you've got another band job?

8
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,971
Yep. I'm with Minton at the Sunset
Hotel. Chummy's gonna pick me up.

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,642
Your friend Chummy, why
don't he hock something?

10
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,019
- He plays the piano.
- I see!

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,441
That's all we need! To schlep a piano
in and out every once in a while.

12
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,028
That string of pearls, how
much did you say that was?

13
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,530
I'd like to give my girl
a birthday present.

14
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,616
Isn't it wonderful to be young?

15
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:43,954
He just got his trombone out of hock
and he wants to buy a $100 necklace.

16
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,790
$100?

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,959
I'd like to give her this. Haven't
seen her for a few years.

18
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,921
- You are engaged?
- No, not exactly.

19
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,384
We went around together when we were
in college. University of Colorado.

20
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,428
$100. That's a lot
of money, isn't it?

21
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,682
For a regular customer,
I make a special price.

22
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,012
I guess that's Chummy.

23
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,897
A hundred dollars.

24
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,484
Here's for the horn.

25
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,780
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

26
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,745
- Where'd you get this one, Chummy?
- Made a deal on my Briscoe.

27
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,249
She's a beaut. 45 horsepower.
Only four years old.

28
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,171
- 45 horse...
- Come on, hop in. We gotta get goin'.

29
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,215
- Isn't this a darb, kid?
- Yeah, gee whiz!

30
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,427
- You bring my arrangement?
- You're sittin' on it.

31
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,347
But this is the Sunset Hotel,
potted palms and marble stairs.

32
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,267
- Minton's band plays sweet.
- I know that.

33
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,062
Don't try to slip in that
arrangement of yours tonight.

34
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,066
- We don't wanna lose this job.
- Stop worryin'. This is a classic.

35
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,528
I Dreamt I Dwelt In Marble
Halls, it's a classic!

36
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:02,951
When Minton hears this arrangement,
he'll give us a job for life. Let's go.

37
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,837
Too bad you can't keep the
trombone and hock the arrangement.

38
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,223
- You know where there's Venice?
- Italy.

39
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,810
No! Venice here. By the
pier, with that big wheel.

40
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,271
- Oh, yeah.
- You boys go out there next Monday.

41
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,858
- This fellow Pollack, he has tryouts.
- Ben Pollack?

42
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,529
Ben Pollack. He gets
together a new band.

43
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,781
They go for a long, long trip.

44
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,909
- How do you know?
- A fellow told me this morning.

45
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,787
- You boys go out there.
- Sure. Thanks a lot.

46
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,247
Next Monday?

47
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,833
That gives you a week to
get your trombone out.

48
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,836
- You could work in a gas station.
- Not me.

49
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,004
I'm gonna work on arrangements.

50
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,133
For me, I'm glad for your
business, Mr Miller,

51
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,638
but why don't you give up this
arranging and stick with the trombone?

52
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,850
That's a good question.
I wish I knew the answer.

53
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,812
But I have one idea
up here in my head.

54
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,399
To me, music is more than
just one instrument.

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,277
It's a whole orchestra
playing together. See?

56
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,281
The only way I can express myself
is to work out an arrangement.

57
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,158
See? Thanks for the tip.

58
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,494
Come on.

59
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,883
Great!

60
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,303
- Thanks, Ben.
- You're in. You're in.

61
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,598
- Who's next?
- I am.

62
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,683
I've done some arrangements...

63
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,561
I'm full up on arrangements.
I need more musicians.

64
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,315
I've been working on 'em all week.
They're in your style.

65
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,277
I appreciate that. Lay them on the
piano, I'll try 'em some other time.

66
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,401
Uh-huh.

67
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,742
- My name's on the cover.
- Swell.

68
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,494
OK, who's next?

69
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,789
I am. My name's Schwartz.
Wilbur Schwartz.

70
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,584
Clarinet, eh? Sit down at the first
chair and blow a little bit.

71
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:45,339
- What tune do you want me to play?
- Do you read at sight?

72
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,794
- Try me.
- Chummy, get him something to read.

73
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,403
One, two.

74
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,828
Hey, Glenn! Come on back.
Mr Pollack wants to talk to you.

75
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:02,079
He says your arrangement
is a pip! Your arrangement!

76
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,086
I'm playing in the band and
working on arrangements.

77
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,838
I got a two-week advance.

78
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,965
You are a regular Rockefeller!

79
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,595
- I want to thank you for everything.
- Don't mention about it.

80
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,639
I'm only glad it
worked so good out.

81
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,934
About that string of pearls
for my girl's birthday.

82
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,314
You said something about a
special price for those.

83
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:30,235
For you it's $80. You pay
me 40 down and $5 a week.

84
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,654
- Good enough.
- Shall I mail it for you?

85
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,783
I better take 'em with me.
I'm not sure of her address.

86
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,203
We're booked into Denver.
She lives right near there.

87
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,414
Ten, 20, 30, 40. There's the 40.

88
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,794
- And here is for the trombone.
- All right.

89
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,380
- Thank you very much.
- Same to you, and good luck.

90
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,425
I hope you stay out of
pawnshops for a while.

91
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,971
- So do I! Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

92
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,023
- Glenn, come on!
- A Pierce-Arrow?

93
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,068
Yeah! I got it for the
old car and 100 bucks.

94
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,196
Much heavier. It'll hold the
road better on a long trip.

95
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,407
If the band folds up, we can
sell it to an undertaker.

96
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,612
Get in the back, I'll
give you a ride in style.

97
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,851
Hurry, Glenn. We're due at the
Denver Palace in ten minutes.

98
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,896
- How much, sir?
- Oh, give us five.

99
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,704
Hello. I want Boulder 6-1-7-0.

100
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,958
How many?

101
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,127
I'll get it, Mother.

102
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,515
Hello?

103
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,845
Hello? Helen? How's my girl?

104
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,563
Your girl? Who is this?

105
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,024
Who is this? Is this Helen Burger?

106
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,734
Yes, but there must be some...

107
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:38,065
- Well, it's Glenn!
- Glenn? Glenn who?

108
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,699
It's Glenn Miller!

109
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,202
Glenn Miller?

110
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,662
Oh, Glenn Miller.

111
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,458
Well, now, honestly. After
two years and not a word.

112
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,210
Didn't you get my card?

113
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,503
The one you wrote a year
ago last Christmas?

114
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,089
Well, I haven't heard
from you either.

115
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,594
I didn't know where you were.
I don't even know where you are now.

116
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:05,015
I'm down here in Denver. I want
to see you. How about tonight?

117
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,309
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a date.

118
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,021
Couldn't you break it? I'm with
Pollack and we're leavin' tomorrow.

119
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,940
Now, honestly, I...

120
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,859
Glenn, come on, hurry it up.

121
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,196
I'll see you later, then. Gee,
there's a lot I want to tell you.

122
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:24,153
- Glenn, wait a minute...
- I'll be out right after I finish work. Bye.

123
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,372
Glenn? Hello?

124
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,748
Well, honestly.

125
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,636
- Hi, Dad.
- Going out, Helen?

126
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,681
This is a new wrinkle, isn't it?
Ed keeping you waiting.

127
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,850
It isn't Ed tonight. It's a
man I haven't seen for years.

128
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,019
Not Ed? What's happened?

129
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,647
It must be serious for you
to break a date with Ed.

130
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,566
No, Mother. Glenn isn't my type.

131
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,904
I guess I'm just too practical
or unromantic or something.

132
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:07,286
I want a man like Ed who's got a
factory or a store or something solid.

133
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,747
I certainly don't want a wandering
nomad like Glenn Miller.

134
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,451
What's he do, this Glenn Miller?

135
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,754
I don't really know except he said
he was in Denver for overnight.

136
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,965
He's gonna pick me up after work.

137
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,720
He must be a hard worker.
It's nearly 9:00 now.

138
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,514
It is?

139
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,809
Well.

140
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,528
Oh! There's really
no excuse for this!

141
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,655
The least he could've
done was phone.

142
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,366
- Unless he was in an accident.
- Call him.

143
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,493
How can I? I don't
know where he is.

144
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,621
If I'm going hunting in the
morning, I've gotta get to bed.

145
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,333
Sam's picking me up
at the crack of dawn.

146
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,086
- Doesn't look as if he's coming tonight.
- It certainly doesn't!

147
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,380
Even if he did come,
I wouldn't see him.

148
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,716
Then we can all go to bed?

149
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:06,678
Well, so much for Mr Glenn Miller.

150
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,973
I'll never see him again.

151
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,823
Helen?

152
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,826
Helen?

153
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,041
Helen?

154
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,714
Helen!

155
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,470
Helen!

156
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,140
- Oh, there you are.
- Glenn Miller, you go away.

157
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,231
I don't want to go away. I came
to see you. We have a date.

158
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:04,484
- Shh! You'll wake up the neighbourhood.
- How can I talk to you?

159
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,282
You keep quiet. I'll be right down.

160
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,346
Hello, Helen.

161
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,099
What's the matter with
you, coming at this hour?

162
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,103
I told you I'd come out after work.
I got here as quick as I could.

163
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,274
- Shh. Be quiet.
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

164
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:46,069
Just as feisty as ever,
and just as pretty too.

165
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,615
I must be pretty! Wearing this
kimono and my hair up in curlers.

166
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,993
Is that what they are?
Come on, sit down.

167
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,621
- It's cold out here.
- Come on. It's a beautiful night.

168
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,998
Gee.

169
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:02,586
There. I bought you a
present for your birthday.

170
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,465
My birthday? That isn't
until next November.

171
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,760
This is for your last birthday.

172
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,432
Why, they're beautiful! But I
can't accept a present like this.

173
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,894
Why not? They're not real.
I wish they were.

174
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:23,273
I got 'em out in Los Angeles in
a pa... In a, uh... A, uh...

175
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,977
I'll get you some
real ones someday.

176
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,403
Honestly.

177
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,324
Two years and not a word and
then a present like this.

178
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:37,204
You know, with some people you don't
have to write. You just know.

179
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,499
- I knew you'd be here.
- Oh, you did?

180
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,877
Sure. I knew you'd
be just the same.

181
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,047
Just sitting around waiting for
you to show up, I suppose?

182
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,884
"How is my girl?" you said.
Well, you happen to be wrong!

183
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,012
I've been engaged to Ed
Healey for nearly a year.

184
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,557
Did it occur to you that I might
not care if I ever saw you again?

185
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,726
No, it never did.

186
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,770
Never.

187
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,023
- Never.
- Why can't I ever stay mad at you?

188
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,859
You had me worried
there for a minute.

189
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,237
Honestly!

190
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:15,075
If you were anybody else,
I would never speak to you again.

191
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:19,663
Look at me. Sitting here in
this kimono and my hair all...

192
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,583
- Those curlers.
- Terrible, isn't it?

193
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,671
Helen, now look, I've got an idea.

194
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,752
Come with me to Fort Morgan.
I'm gonna introduce you to my folks.

195
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,344
- Now?
- Right now.

196
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,972
People do sleep
between 3am and 6am.

197
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,474
They'll be crazy about you.

198
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,602
- And they'll give us breakfast.
- How do we get there?

199
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,188
- I'll get a taxi.
- A taxi to Fort Morgan?

200
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,566
- Sure.
- That's so extravagant.

201
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,277
- It isn't far.
- Maybe I can get the family car.

202
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,404
Wonderful. Wait a minute.

203
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,858
Let me try these on for size, hm?

204
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,075
There.

205
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,080
Uh-oh.

206
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,666
- Mr Burger, I...
- Take it easy, son.

207
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,837
I'm just going hunting,
for jackrabbits.

208
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,439
- Glenn!
- It's Glenn!

209
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,026
Hi, Herb. How are you?
Glad to see you. Hello, Irene.

210
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,112
- What a surprise! I had no idea.
- Hello, Mother.

211
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,239
Glad to see you. Mother, this is...

212
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,034
You don't need to tell me.
You're Helen!

213
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,661
We've been hearing
about you for years.

214
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,080
Why, yes. I'm very
happy to meet you.

215
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,250
- Daddy'll be down in a minute.
- Dean and Velna?

216
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,086
They're fine! I'll show you
a picture of the baby.

217
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,089
- Sure.
- She your girl, Glenn?

218
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,841
That's right, Herb.

219
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,135
Are you and Glenn
gonna get married?

220
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,513
Don't ask that! We just take
such things for granted.

221
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,682
- How are you, son?
- Fine.

222
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,894
- And you're Helen. Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

223
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,981
- You gonna get these kids some breakfast?
- I certainly am!

224
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,943
You might've let us know where
you are and what your plans are.

225
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,072
We have to ask Helen, eh?
I'll bet he tells you everything.

226
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,492
Oh, no, Mr Miller. I seem to
be the last person he tells.

227
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,286
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

228
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,455
- You like hotcakes, Helen?
- Yes.

229
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,499
Mom makes pretty good ones...

230
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,751
♪ Little brown jug, how I love thee

231
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,253
♪ Ha-ha-ha, you and me

232
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:37,130
♪ Little brown jug,
how I love thee... ♪

233
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,764
Good old Colorado U.
It hasn't changed a bit.

234
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,433
No, it's just as pretty as ever.

235
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,270
We still have time. Let's walk across
the campus for old times' sake.

236
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,565
- I'd love to.
- Come on.

237
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,904
- Wish I didn't have to leave so soon.
- I do too.

238
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,657
Listen. It's the Glee
Club rehearsing.

239
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,786
- I love that song.
- What, Little Brown Jug?

240
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,622
That's sort of a tin-eared tune.

241
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,208
Why, that's one of my favourites.

242
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,462
My dad used to sing it to me when I
was a little girl. I guess that's why.

243
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,041
- They sing it pretty well.
- Mm-hm.

244
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,678
When something's really
wonderful like that, I know it.

245
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,181
I get kind of a funny feeling
up the back of my neck.

246
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,102
That's how I can tell. Sort of
makes my hair stand on end.

247
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,438
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

248
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,023
Looks pretty normal from here.

249
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,318
It just feels that way!

250
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,647
- Remember that lake?
- Yes, I do.

251
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,995
- Where do you go from here?
- We're heading east.

252
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,457
Chicago, New York. We're booked
into the Club Fifty there.

253
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,417
- Ever been to New York?
- No.

254
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,919
Neither have I. I hear
it's quite a town.

255
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,999
You're certainly seeing
America, aren't you?

256
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,301
You think I'm kinda
rudderless, don't you?

257
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,471
Wandering over the
country with the band.

258
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,348
- Yes, I guess I do.
- But I'm not, though.

259
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,604
I know exactly where I'm going.
I know exactly what I want to do.

260
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,105
You do?

261
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,026
I'm not gonna be a sideman all
my life, a trombone player.

262
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,445
I'm gonna have a
band all of my own.

263
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,448
I'm gonna play my
own kind of music.

264
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,911
I... It's hard to
explain, but a band...

265
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:32,788
A band oughta have a sound all of
its own, oughta have a personality.

266
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,211
- Sort of like a person.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,755
How do you get this
different sound?

268
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,424
You see, the arrangements,

269
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,844
the way you score each one of
the individual instruments.

270
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,847
Some bands have that sound
already, like Pollack,

271
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,600
but it's not the right
sound, not for me.

272
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,645
- What is?
- I don't know.

273
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,397
I don't know.
I haven't found it yet.

274
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,984
But someday I'm gonna
find it and when I do...

275
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,563
You'll find it. I'm sure you will.

276
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,072
- You are?
- Hey, Glenn!

277
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,454
There's Chummy. He found
it all right. Goodbye.

278
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,208
It's been wonderful seeing you.
Goodbye. I'm comin'!

279
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,333
You'll be hearing from me.
Wait and see.

280
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,927
- Come on, boy, let's go.
- All right, all right.

281
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,677
Bye.

282
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,267
Honestly.

283
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,101
How about one more?
One more number?

284
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,479
We can't, kids. We're
leaving for Atlantic City.

285
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,648
We'll be back in a
couple of months.

286
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,609
Thanks a lot. Swell.

287
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,321
Fellas, listen just a minute
before you start packing up.

288
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:31,326
The bus leaves from the hotel for
Atlantic City tomorrow morning at 10:30.

289
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:36,124
Everybody be on time.
Don't be late, will ya? OK.

290
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,085
Ben, like I told you,

291
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,755
I guess this is where I get off.

292
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,132
I want to thank you for everything.

293
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,426
- You know what you're doin'?
- Yeah.

294
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,722
I wanna stick around New York for
a while. I want to do some studying.

295
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,059
Just when the band's really
startin' to take on.

296
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,687
I know all that. I appreciate
everything you've done for me

297
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,732
and I wish you all the
luck in the world.

298
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:08,655
If there's... Any time you want me to do
an arrangement for you, just let me know.

299
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:12,492
That's an idea. Well,
so long, kid. A lotta luck.

300
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,994
- Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

301
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,747
- You're really serious about this?
- Yeah.

302
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,418
Still got that crazy idea
in your head, that sound?

303
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,672
Hey, Don?

304
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,383
This is Chummy MacGregor.
This is Don Haynes.

305
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,427
- Hi.
- Glad to meet ya. You're the band booker.

306
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,888
Gonna try and get Glenn
some work arranging.

307
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,307
- It's an awful lonely town.
- I know.

308
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,478
I wish we could stick together, but
I've been eating for two years now.

309
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,481
It's gotten to be a habit.
I don't think I can break it.

310
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,692
I know.

311
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,987
Well, good luck, kid. Hope you
find a friendly pawn shop.

312
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,486
- Yeah, bye, Chummy.
- So long.

313
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,419
- Glenn!
- Hi, Don. How are you?

314
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,421
- What are you doin'?
- Not much.

315
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:53,509
Listen, Red Nichols is getting together a
pit band for a new musical, Girl Crazy.

316
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,637
I know you're still looking for
that sound but it's been two years.

317
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,891
- You won't find it on an empty stomach.
- I sure can't.

318
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,478
A lot of your friends are in the band -
Benny Goodman, Babe Russin.

319
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:07,857
- It's a great chance. It'll run all season.
- I guess I better take it.

320
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,193
I'll call you tomorrow.
I gotta run.

321
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,488

Hello.

334
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,471
Helen, can you come to
New York right away?

335
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,517
Glenn! I don't know
whether I can or not.

336
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,519
But for heaven's sake, why?

337
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,646
So we can get married.

I need you, Helen. I
can't wait any longer.

Glenn, I'm engaged!

340
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,863
That's right. It'll be a
very short engagement.

341
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:40,950
No, you don't understand.
I'm engaged to Ed. Ed Healey.

342
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,328
Ed Healey? The fellow you
told me about two years ago?

343
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,332
- Yes.
- If you haven't gotten married in two years...

344
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,627
People just don't rush
into getting married!

345
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:56,799
Nonsense, Helen. You come to New York,
marry me and get this thing settled.

346
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,177
I can't just walk out on him!

347
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,931
There's a train leaving Denver at 11:30
tomorrow night. Can you get that?

348
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,933
Glenn, you just wait a minute.

349
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,229
We can talk everything
over when you get here.

350
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,190
Honestly!

351
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,861
Call me from Denver so I can meet the
train. My number is Pennsylvania 6-5000.

352
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,071

this time of year. Goodbye.

Glenn!

357
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,732
What beats me is how she got
Ed to drive her into Denver.

358
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,621
Helen!

359
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,750
- Hi. You look wonderful.
- I've only come to talk things over.

360
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,086
We can talk it over on the way.

361
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,756
I'm not going to let you rush
me into getting married.

362
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,842
Of course not. But
there isn't much time.

363
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:27,348
We have to pick up the licence, then
be uptown at the church by 7:00.

364
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:31,269
- I have to be in the theatre by eight.
- Wait a minute, Glenn.

365
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,269
Gee, I'm so glad you're here.

366
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,300
- Where are we going?
- The theatre.

367
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:06,345
You're gonna see a wonderful show,
Girl Crazy. I got you a box seat.

368
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,515
- No, I mean, on our honeymoon.
- The Pennsylvania Hotel.

369
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,644
Don's arranged for a big suite.
He's sending up the baggage.

370
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,772
The Pennsylvania Hotel?
Isn't that extravagant?

371
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:21,152
If we'd been married in Boulder and
come to New York on our honeymoon,

372
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,154
we'd be staying at a hotel.

373
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:27,283
- I suppose.
- Of course we would. Here's the ticket.

374
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:31,079

I wanna check if it's...

375
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:37,411
- What? What are you looking at?
- The man I just married.

376
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:44,175
The first time I even suspected anything
was when I found myself packing.

377
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,762
And then when you met me
at the station and kissed me.

378
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,889
It was that kiss
that convinced you.

379
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,600
I kinda figured
that'd do the trick.

No, it is not. I've been getting
up at this hour all of my life.

459
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,157
But you haven't been staying
up until 4:00 in the morning.

- What have you been doing?
- The ironing.

463
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,052
The ironing? Honey,
this is a hotel.

464
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,806
All you have to do is pick up the phone.
They have people to do that.

465
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,267
- But did you see what they charge?
- No.

466
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,436
- It's just terrible.
- Is that so?

467
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,397
I don't think we should
waste our money like that.

468
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:09,317
- Nobody can say I married a spendthrift.
- No, sir.

469
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,896
I'm a penny-pinching miser.

470
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:19,911
I'm the kind of wife that steals money out
of your pockets and puts it in the bank.

471
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:24,083
- Would you really do that?
- Sure. I've already started.

472

- Hi, dear.
- Hi.

473
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:05,207
It's a long movie. We have two
hours before the next stage show.

474
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,543
- Have a good time?
- I like the show. But the music!

475
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,921
Well, you know the music.

476
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:15,342
- That isn't the way you want to play, is it?
- No, but I like pit work.

477
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,470
It pays well. You get
to stay in one place.

478
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:23,016
Glenn, I've been thinking. How much
does that Dr Schillinger charge?

479
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,977
He's pretty expensive.
I don't know exactly.

480
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,105
I haven't worked
with him for years.

481
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,024
That's just exactly
what I mean. Why not?

482
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,984
I don't know. I...

483
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,446
What happened to that dream
of yours? What about that sound?

484
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,116
Well, I've been working
on that, Helen.

485
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,163
It's an uphill grind. My chance
will come one of these days.

486
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,288
To tell you the truth, Glenn,
I've been sort of disappointed.

487
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,376
You mean that?

488
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,556
If I started to study again, we'd
have to make all sorts of sacrifices.

489
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,885
I'd have to give up
those record dates.

490
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,396
Darling, I don't want to
live in a fancy hotel.

491
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,691
We could get an awfully
cute little apartment.

492
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,520
I just want you to keep on trying.

493
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,992
I've sort of let you
down, haven't I?

494
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,242
A little.

495
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,375
I'm sorry, Helen.

496
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:36,339
You're right. I should
start to study again. I...

497
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,093
Why don't I call Schillinger right now?
See if he'll take me back.

498
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,137
I have his phone number here...

499
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,182
It's Trafalgar 7-5-0-9-8.

500
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,559
- 7-5-0-9...
- Eight.

501
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,604
Well... Well...

502
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,108
7-5-0-9-8.

503
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,129
- Helen?
- Yes?

504
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,717
- Where are my glasses?
- Right here! Why don't you put them on?

505
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,637
I'll have to get some
glasses to find my glasses.

506
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,680
What were you playing? It's lovely.

507
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,726
A little exercise I'm working out
for Schillinger. I hope he likes it.

508
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,062
Does that mean you won't
be able to use it?

509
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:36,191
No, that doesn't make any difference.
It's not that good, though.

510
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,943
I think it is.

511
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:41,029
- You like it as good as Little Brown Jug?
- No.

512
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,365
But I think you should
do something with it.

513
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:47,452
I suppose you could make a song out of it.
Get somebody to write lyrics.

514
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,789
Have to get a title.
What's a good title?

515
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:56,086
Well, it should be soft and
romantic. Sort of like moonlight.

516
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:00,257
Moonlight. Young lover under
his sweetheart's window.

517
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:04,094
You wouldn't be thinking of
a certain night in Boulder?

518
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,888
There wasn't any moonlight.
Just a shotgun!

519
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,516
I know. And you didn't
serenade me either.

520
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,602
I didn't have a chance.
Serenade. There's a title.

521
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,898
- Serenade in the Moonlight.
- How about Moonlight Serenade?

522
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,109
Moonlight Serenade? Not bad.

523
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,820
- It's kinda pretty.
- Moonlight Serenade.

524
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,448
♪ I stand at your gate

525
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,411

sing is of moonlight

526
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,914

♪ A moonlight serenade ♪

541
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,268
- What have they done to my tune?
- It wasn't very good.

542
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,606
The song is supposed to be a ballad,
not a hootchy-kootchy dance!

543
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:44,611
They made a production number out of it.
And that arrangement, Holy Moses!

544
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,404
Why wouldn't he use yours?

545
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,990
Every band leader wants
his own arrangement.

546
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,786
So do you! If you had your own band,
this sort of thing wouldn't happen.

547
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,207
- Of course.
- Let's go. We have a lot to do.

548
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,877
We need an instrument
truck, and a car.

549
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,671
That's two down payments.
If we use Chummy's car...

550
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,925
Wait till you see what I got now.
Snappiest job on the road.

551
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:11,054
It's a big Phaeton. Even got a
separate windshield for the back seat.

552
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,807
You can always be the first
one to arrive in town.

553
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,393
We'll need music
stands and a copyist.

554
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:21,689
We can do the copying. Like the old days,
no food but plenty of manuscript paper.

555
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,441
What do you mean, no food?

556
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:27,070
- We'll need at least 1,800.
- Then we're all set.

557
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,573
Honey, he means we need
$1,800 to start the band.

558
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,868
Yes.

559
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:38,164
- We don't need anything but good luck.
- What's this?

560
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,663
"The Glenn Miller Band Account"?

561
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,587
$1,842!

562
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,343
Now eat your dinner.

563
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,397
Hey. Did you get all that
money out of my pockets?

564
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,646
Mm-hm.

565
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,672
We're late for the job now.
I better go on ahead.

566
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:32,010
- You fellas get there as quick as you can.
- All right, Glenn.

567
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,213
Practically a new tyre too.

568
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,197
Helen, you don't look very well.

569
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,992
I'm just fine.
I'm just a little tired.

570
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,496
And poor Glenn is up all night
working on the arrangements

571
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,374
and I have to sort of take
care of the bookkeeping.

572
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:49,087
Has the business manager given you
the big financial statement yet?

573
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:53,800
No, but I will. We left New
York with $42 in the bank.

574
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:57,095
After six months, we've paid
for the truck and the car.

575
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,722
That leaves a balance of 48.

576
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,268
In short, we're making
exactly $1 a month.

577
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,520
So in ten years we'll
have made $120.

578
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,270
It takes time for a
new band to catch on.

579
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,025
It sure does.

580
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,237
I don't know. One night we
pack 'em in and they love us.

581
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,531
The next six dates we die.

582
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,867
We don't seem to be getting
anywhere, and we don't deserve to!

583
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:24,247
I just haven't been able to
hit the right combination.

584
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:28,544
I just still haven't
got that sound.

585
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,381
Glenn, maybe if you stop playing.

586
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,967
- Touché!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

587
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,679
I know what you mean. Get a
baton and start leading. No.

588
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,516
Once you step out in front of the boys,
you can never be a sideman again.

589
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,643
I'll stick to my trombone.

590
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,937
I've got some good
news for a change.

591
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:52,191
I talked to Si Schribman. He runs
the State Ballroom in Boston.

592
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,444
He's booked you in for
the week of the 22nd.

593
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,447
That means six half-hour air
spots. That's what counts.

594
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:01,618
- It sure does!
- Imagine! A whole week in one town.

595
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,329
I could even get the washing
and the mending done.

596
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,540
- Let's all drink to Boston!
- I think we should.

597
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,743
Good ol' Boston.

598
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,636
Glenn, why don't you ever
use Moonlight Serenade?

599
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,097
Don't we have enough trouble
without resurrecting that?

600
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,933
- Well, I liked it.
- So did I.

601
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:29,263
That's two of us. Now, if
we can just find a third.

602
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,783
- How's she look?
- Could be worse. Don't know how.

603
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:44,535
You need a new axle
housing, an axle shaft,

604
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,580
ring gear and pinion,
differential gear case.

605
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,958
- How long'll it take?
- A few days once I get the parts.

606
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:55,254
- You don't have 'em here?
- Don't have many calls for ring gears.

607
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:59,258
Might have to go to Woodstock
soon as it stops snowing.

608
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,461
- It could be worse.
- Yeah.

609
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,722
There's Helen. Get a
hold of Schribman?

610
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,851
No, I couldn't get Boston.
The telephone lines are down.

611
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,854
Chummy, you and Helen
better try and make Boston.

612
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,399
Tell Schribman we'll be
there as soon as we can.

613
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,443
He's probably guessed
what happened.

614
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,114
- He wouldn't cancel on us.
- No, we'll get there all right.

615
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,409
We can't lose that week in Boston.
Go ahead. Bye, dear.

616
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,578
- Take care.
- Yeah.

617
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,386
- You Mr Miller?
- Yeah.

618
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,682
Man left a message. Your wife's sick.
They got her to the hospital.

619
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,386
- What hospital?
- Boston Memorial.

620
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,816
Mr Miller, she's a very sick girl.

621
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,570
We gave her a transfusion but we're
lucky this happened when it did.

622
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,782
A few months further along and we might've
lost the mother as well as the child.

623
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,951
I had no idea that she was...

624
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,120
- All right, Doctor.
- Thank you.

625
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,415
Just for a minute.

626
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,970
Helen.

627
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,522
The truck all right?

628
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,865
Five and a quarter, cash on the barrel
head. Take it or leave it, boys.

629
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,992
Better than the others.

630
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,328
I guess we'll have to take it.

631
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,290
Kinda leaves us in a spot. It's
$900 to pay the boys in the band.

632
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,417
With my car? How
much'll you give us?

633
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,545
- You're not gonna do it.
- I can sell my own car if I want to.

634
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,800
Four hundred. That makes nine and
a quarter for all three of 'em.

635
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:08,012
- This isn't your problem.
- Why isn't it? I wanna get paid off, too.

636
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,306
You got a deal. Just one condition.

637
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,476
I need the car long enough to
drive the boys to the station.

638
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,144
Yes, that can be arranged.

639
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,231
Fellas, pile in. I'll
drive you to the station.

640
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,526
Thank you, Chummy.

641
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,074
- Hi, dear. How do you feel?
- Fine.

642
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,618
- You look much better.
- Good.

643
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,788
The doctor said if I behave
myself, I'll be up in a few days.

644
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,665
Good.

645
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,709
I've made up my mind about
something, young lady.

646
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,712
If I ever go on the road again,

647
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:46,217
you're gonna stay in that nice
apartment of ours on East 57th Street.

648
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,386
You just listen to
me, Glenn Miller.

649
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,556
You enticed a little country
girl to run away and marry you

650
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,307
and now you're hooked with her.

651
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,311
And I'm not gonna let you go gallivanting
around the country without me.

652
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,648
You're hooked with a no-good
itinerant musician.

653
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,777
- I'm not complaining.
- I know. You never do.

654
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,656
But I know how you wanted kids.

655
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,951
I want to tell you something else
I've made up my mind about.

656
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:15,162
We're not gonna have just one
child. We're gonna have two!

657
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,290
We're gonna have a boy and a girl.

658
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,125
- Glenn, I can't.
- I know.

659
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,544
The doctor told me, but I mean it.

660
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:26,797
There'll be two kids meant for us.
Somewhere we're gonna find them.

661
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,763
I hope so.

662
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,102
Who sent these flowers?

663
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,438
- The boys in the band.
- Wasn't that nice?

664
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,641
They're sweet.

665
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,603
What's happened? Any dates?

666
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,282
No. No dates.

667
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,534
There's no band.

668
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,203
We had to sell the cars
and pay off the boys.

669
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:00,207
Chummy had to sell his Phaeton.
Isn't that a shame?

670
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,082
Poor Chummy really loved that car.

671
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,258
Glenn, you had a good band.

672
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,637
It was getting better all the
time. It wasn't your fault.

673
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,014
It's my fault all right!

674
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,975
I'm broke, I'm in debt,
I don't even have a job.

675
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:23,022
I told you before, you've gotten mixed
up with a no-good itinerant musician.

676
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:26,898
- And I love him.
- And I love you.

677
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,657
It's almost worth it.

678
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:37,580
It's the first time you've told me
that since the day we were married.

679
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,087
Come in.

680
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:57,181
- Mrs Miller?
- Yes.

681
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,850
I thought so. I can come in?

682
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,053
Well, yes, of course.

683
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,857
I brought you some flowers.

684
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,153
Oh. Well, thank you very much.

685
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,159
- They're all right?
- They're lovely.

686
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,205
I'm a bachelor, I got no wife
to tell me these things.

687
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,166
- Well, they're very pretty.
- Yeah.

688
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,336
I heard all about the band
and how you were sick.

689
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,632
Such a shame. I can
sit down a minute?

690
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,134
Yes, please.

691
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,797
"Compliments of the
State Ballroom."

692
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,684
- Is this a joke?
- I shoulda said so right away.

693
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,270
No, that's me. Si Schribman.

694
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,106
Si Schribman! If I'd
known who you were...

695
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,818
I know. Don Haynes said you wanted
to give me a piece of your mind.

696
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,862
That's why I came here.

697
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,612
Maybe we can exchange
pieces of mind.

698
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,995
I'm not really such an ogre.
I didn't like cancelling you out.

699
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:04,874
But an old widow lady, 75,
she owns that ballroom.

700
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,251
If I don't have a band,
I don't pay the rent.

701
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,838
If I don't pay the rent,
that old lady don't eat.

702
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,133
It's a bad situation.

703
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:18,596
If she would only die, God forbid,
then I could run it like I like.

704
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,474
- It finished us. You know that.
- Yeah.

705
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,268
- We had to break up the band.
- I know.

706
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,729
I heard the band. It was good.

707
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,648
Not great, mind you,
but good, very good.

708
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:35,029
We were just getting started. Well,
now I don't know what we'll do.

709
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:40,282
Just don't you worry, young lady. Get
well, and don't worry about the band.

710
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,828
That's easy to say.

711
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,790
I believe in Glenn and I believe
what he's trying to do,

712
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,993
so naturally I worry.

713
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:52,046
I tell you, you send him
over, he should see me.

714
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,799
With my own money that
don't go to the widow,

715
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,469
- I sometimes invest in bands.
- Do you mean that?

716
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,015
Would I make myself so
much trouble if I didn't?

717
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,893
But there's a problem.
I know Glenn.

718
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,896
He's down right now and
he won't accept help.

719
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:11,899
I don't think he'd risk
somebody else's money.

720
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,735
I never even met your husband
and I like him already.

721
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,780
You just leave it to me.
I'll cook up something.

722
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,157
Thank you very much for coming.

723
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,451
And I'm sorry I was so ungracious.

724
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:27,456
Who was ungracious? We got along
fine exchanging pieces of mind.

725
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,830
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

726
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,425
I know you don't want
a band but I'm stuck.

727
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,596
But this Charley Firman sneaks a
band right out from under my nose.

728
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:47,101
- I don't have any men. No money.
- I'll give you the money. Here.

729
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:51,188
Five hundred. Six hundred.
A thousand.

730
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,358
There. You got the money.
Now, go get the men.

731
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:59,738
I've tried all sorts of combinations.
I never found out what I was looking for.

732
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:04,201
If I start again, I've got to have an
entirely different kind of a band.

733
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,204
Different tunes. I wanna
try something radical.

734
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,666
Fine. Go get radical,
but just get going!

735
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,373
I gotta have something in here making
a noise the kids can dance to.

736
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,923
OK.

737
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:28,517
- Let's have the five saxes right in there.
- Five saxes?

738
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,103
And the trombones over there.

739
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,814
And the four trumpets
right behind them.

740
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,066
Four trombones and four trumpets!

741
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,819
When they play, what's
gonna hold the roof on?

742
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,071
Five saxes and a trumpet lead.

743
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:44,116
Maybe it's good and maybe
it ain't, but it's radical.

744
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,576
Let's try this.

745
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:49,371
Remember this is a ballad, so take
it nice and easy, don't bruise it.

746
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:53,500
Joe, you stand up so I can get a balance
between you and the saxophones.

747
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,252
All right, here we go.

748
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,879
One,

749
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,589
two.

750
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,295
What's the matter?

751
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,131
- He cut his lip.
- Let's see.

752
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,718
Oh, no. You really split it open.
You better have it looked at.

753
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:29,263
- I'm sorry, Glenn.
- Go on, Joe. Take care of it.

754
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,466
Oh, no.

755
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,099
All right, take five, boys.

756
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,322
- Is it bad?
- He'll be out for weeks.

757
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,825
- You get more tough breaks...
- Just when you got a good sound.

758
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,912
It isn't what I want but if
we could've worked on it...

759
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:58,042
- You can't find another trumpet blower?
- Not with Joe's range.

760
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,711
All the arrangements
have a trumpet lead?

761
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,672
He had to hurt his lip
the day before you open.

762
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,175
What are we gonna do?
Postpone the opening?

763
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,845
- Poor old widow lady.
- We're not gonna postpone anything.

764
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:14,058
We'll open tomorrow if I have to stay up
all night and rewrite the arrangement.

765
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,644
- You can't. It's impossible.
- Wait a minute!

766
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,022
Just a minute. I have an idea.

767
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:24,485
Willie Schwartz could play those
parts on clarinet. Why not?

768
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,612
You see? Clarinet lead. Why not?

769
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,698
Get me lots of manuscript paper.
Can I use your office?

770
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,450
Sure.

771
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:35,412
Clarinet lead. Why not? And, Don,
call Helen, tell her not to worry.

772
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,415
Tell her I'll be here all night.
Clarinet lead.

773
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,496
And I can harmonise it real
tight, all in the same octave.

774
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:49,043
Four saxes and a clarinet.

775
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,839
He better stay up all night.

776
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,360
He looks like he's got it, maybe.
Listen to those kids!

777
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:57,441
There's no maybe about it.
That's it, that's the sound.

778
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,322
Thank you.

779
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,041
Here's a brand-new
number by Jerry Gray.

780
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,870
I hope you like it
as much as we do.

781
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,666
I, uh, bought you a present
for your birthday.

782
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,877
My birthday? That isn't
till next November.

783
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,251
This is for your last birthday.

784
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:24,296
- Oh, Glenn!
- They're just real.

785
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,307
Here, let me try 'em on for size.

786
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,768
There.

787
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,639
Hm. Not bad.

788
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,162
I forgot to tell you
the name of that tune.

789
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,707
We call it String Of Pearls.

790
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,115
- Hi, Mother, Dad!
- Hi, Glenn.

791
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,701
You rested up ready
for the big night?

792
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,203
We've had a wonderful
time with little Stevie.

793
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,372
- Quite a boy. Big for his age.
- Isn't he?

794
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,876
I can't tell you how much
it's meant to us to have him.

795
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,253
- Is everything all set?
- Yes, dear.

796
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:06,423
- Did you get Helen out of the house?
- Oh, yes.

797
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,676
- Where'd she go?
- I suppose she's shopping.

798
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,679
A girl doesn't have a tenth
wedding anniversary every day!

799
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,599
- You sure she doesn't suspect anything?
- Oh, no.

800
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,974
- Is everything all set back here?
- Oh, yes.

801
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,690
I think Helen'll get a
big kick out of this.

802
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:25,643
She certainly will, Glenn.

803
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,280
I've been lookin' about.
Quite a place you got here.

804
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,115
It's beautiful, Glenn.

805
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:35,035
- Paid for, is it?
- Yes, it's paid for.

806
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:40,373
- Must be doin' pretty well.
- We hear him every night on that radio!

807
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:43,209
That's only 15 minutes.
Don't suppose it pays much.

808
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,506
Then there's the records. And he's
playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania.

809
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:14,074
How much do they pay for playing
on one of those records?

810
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,369
- We get three cents a record.
- Three cents?

811
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,871
Have to sell a heap of records
to make it worthwhile.

812
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,581
But they do, dear!

813
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,668
- Let's go see Stevie.
- No, Helen wants us to wait.

814
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:28,004
Why? Come on. Sure, we
can go on up there.

815
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:32,092
- Hi. Stevie and I have a surprise for you.
- You do?

816
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:35,012
- Let's go up to the nursery.
- Come on.

817
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,140
How many copies of a
record do they sell, son?

818
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:43,062
Moonlight Serenade, we
sold about 800,000 copies.

819
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,059
- Did you say 800,000?
- That's right.

820
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,738
What's...

821
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,158
Look what just arrived.

822
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,205
This is Stevie's new baby sister.

823
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:06,167
- Can I pick her up?
- I think so. She's your daughter.

824
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:10,339
Well, well, well.

825
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:15,844
So you're Jonnie Dee! Look,
she's beautiful! Isn't she?

826
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,096
Look at those red cheeks.

827
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,808
Stevie, look at your baby sister.
Isn't she beautiful?

828
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:25,603
- You sure surprised him!
- I've been planning it for months.

829
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:29,691
- I told 'em I just had to have her today.
- How old is she?

830
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,444
- Six weeks today.
- Old lady.

831
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:37,657
- She's a hungry old woman.
- This is gonna take some expert action.

832
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:41,362
Her young father's gonna feed her.
Let's have the bottle.

833
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,913
Here, now. Here we go.

834
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,541
All right, Jonnie Dee.
There we are.

835
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,835
How's your appetite?

836
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:51,296
There! Is this hot enough?

837
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:55,502
That's a good girl.
The kid's starved.

838
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:06,311
- Helen, we'll be late for the theatre.
- Coming.

839
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:09,355
- I'll get the car.
- All right, dear.

840
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:15,153
Glenn, I've been figuring. 800,000 records
at three cents apiece, that's $24,000.

841
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,989
- That's right.
- Just for one record?

842
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,284
Well, you certainly are
doing well at that!

843
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:25,331
All right, boys, right over here.
You all set? All right.

844
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,500
Helen, come on!

845
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,710
I'm coming!

846
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,900
Congratulations!

847
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,406
What a surprise!

848
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,158
- Oh, Mother!
- Darling!

849
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,036
Oh, I'm glad to see you!

850
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:08,039
- Polly, Don. How are you?
- It's a wonderful surprise!

851
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,126
- We sort of surprised each other.
- Yes, we did!

852
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,211
I've got another surprise.

853
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:17,090
The band has a number, and that's
exactly what it is, a number.

854
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,467
This is based on a telephone number

855
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:23,638
that was kind of important to you
and me, Helen, about ten years ago.

856
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,807
Here we go. One. Two.

857
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,323
Now, listen to this. Now, watch.

858
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,376
Pennsylvania 6-5000!

859
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,668
- Remember?
- Yes!

860
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,432
Pennsylvania 6-5000!

861
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:11,227
Would you like to make this
a really memorable evening?

862
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,897
- Dance with me.
- In front of all these people?

863
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:17,400
In all the years we've been married
you've never danced with me.

864
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:20,901
- And I may never get another chance.
- Here we go.

865
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,624
Now.

866
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:35,669
- Pennsylvania 6-5000!
- Good.

867
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,717
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Glenn.

868
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,135
Glad to see ya.

869
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,384
That's good.

870
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:55,185
Come on, don't stand around.
Come on! Dance it up!

871
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,940
Come on, let's try something.

872
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:20,297
- That's pretty good. Let's try that again.
- All right.

873
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,135
I think I better go
back to the trombone.

874
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,348
You sit down there.

875
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,116
All right, you.

876
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,912
Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0!

877
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:39,667
I'm kinda glad you
called me that night.

878
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,920
So am I. All right, let's
have something to eat.

879
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,298
Come on. Come on, dear.

880
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:48,176
- We're cutting a record of that.
- A record?

881
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,886
- Three cents?
- Right.

882
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,714
That's my boy!

883
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,517
You oughta use that
number in your picture.

884
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,894
Picture?

885
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:00,897
Glenn and the boys are gonna
do a movie in the fall.

886
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,441
- Are you gonna be a movie star?
- Yes, Mother.

887
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:08,193
I'm gonna play Tarzan and swing
from the trees playing my trombone.

888
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,615
I'd like to propose a toast.

889
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,451
To Glenn and Helen, who serve
the best food in town.

890
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:17,955
Besides, the price is right. We can
remember when it wasn't like this.

891
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:22,377
May you be as happy together
always as you are tonight.

892
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,175
Thank you, Chummy.
That was a very nice speech.

893
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,761
It oughta be,
I worked on it all day!

894
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:34,013
You did?

895
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:40,144
I thought your special number was gonna
be Helen's favourite, Little Brown Jug.

896
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,972
He'd never do that. He hates it.

897
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:46,067
I knew this would come
up sooner or later.

898
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,903
So I have an anniversary
present for my good wife

899
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,988
and on the card it says,

900
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,866
"Ha-ha-ha, you and me

901
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,536
"We hardly ever disagree

902
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:59,622
"So here you are, this will be

903
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:03,327
"The one brown jug
you'll get from me."

904
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,510
- Roll 'em for a take.
- M3-45, take one.

905
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,387
Here we go.

906
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,558
One, two, three, four.

907
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,838
All right. Save it.

908
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,345
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Helen.

909
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,347
Well, hi, dear.

910
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,808
- I thought you'd like lunch.
- I sure would.

911
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,932
I brought the mail.

912
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,572
Chummy, we still have a little time.
Why don't you go over At Last?

913
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,616
Let's go up to the control booth.

914
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:24,115
- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

915
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,624
Come on, sit down, honey.

916
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,877
Helen, I wanted to
talk to you about...

917
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,964
With this picture deal and the
record sales and everything,

918
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,592
- we're pretty well fixed.
- Yes.

919
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,512
And, no matter what
happens, you and the kids,

920
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:46,974
- you're in good shape.
- Yes, I know.

921
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,310
Can you come to Men's
Wardrobe at two?

922
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,562
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

923
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,266
So, I thought that...

924
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,902
What I'm trying to get at...

925
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,029
I've been thinking... Yeah?

926
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,032
On Tuxedo Junction, we'll
have a wax right after lunch.

927
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,361
Fine. Thanks very much.

928
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:10,373
- So...
- Open the letter from the War Department.

929
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:14,210
- I'm sure it's your commission.
- How do you know?

930
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:18,422
I've known it for months. I knew
it was only a question of time.

931
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:23,302
I just put in for it two weeks ago. I guess
you found out about it before I did.

932
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,555
Go on, open it. I want to
know what to call you.

933
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,758
Let's see.

934
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,063
This is it all right.

935
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:37,483
Captain. Captain Alton G Miller.

936
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:41,985
Serial number 0-4-5-0-5-2-7-3.

937
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:47,111
How soon will you be
leaving, Captain Miller?

938
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,037
I don't know. It usually
takes about a month.

939
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,623
Don wants to go with me,
so do some of the boys.

940
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,793
- Are you gonna have your own band?
- I hope so.

941
01:26:55,794 --> 01:27:00,256
You know, all the kids that liked
our music are in the service.

942
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,883
- That's the reason I...
- I understand.

943
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,678
I think you'll look very
handsome in uniform.

944
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:10,015
What do you think about it?
Are you upset?

945
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:13,227
Of course I'm upset.
I don't want you to go

946
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:17,433
but I guess I'd be even
more upset if you didn't.

947
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:40,755
- They sound good.
- Do we have to play this kind of music?

948
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,507
We've marched to this music
for a hundred years.

949
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:47,588
- That's what I mean.
- We're not gonna change now, Captain.

950
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,779
We gotta do better than
this for General Arnold.

951
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,337
In all my 27 years in the Army

952
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:30,215
I have never witnessed a more
flagrant breach of military decorum.

953
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:34,219
- Sorry, Colonel.
- And walking through a reviewing column!

954
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:37,306
- I had to get to the band, sir.
- Then playing blues!

955
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:41,769
You made a laughing stock of this entire
unit, and in front of General Arnold!

956
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,647
- I had no such intentions.
- What was your intention?

957
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:48,067
Blasting out right in
the General's face!

958
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:50,402
The men seemed tired, sir.

959
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:53,906
- The men's condition is my responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

960
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:57,534
I must warn you that your conduct
calls for disciplinary action.

961
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,911
Yes, sir.

962
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:00,913
Come in.

963
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:04,792
Just wanted to say goodbye,
we're due in Washington tonight.

964
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,211
General Arnold, it's
been a pleasure.

965
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,381
- I'm sorry that...
- Aren't you Captain Glenn Miller?

966
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,759
- Yes, sir.
- I want to congratulate you on your band.

967
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,304
- Thank you, sir.
- Great morale builder.

968
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,724
The effect was astonishing!
Keep up the good work.

969
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,352
- Yes, sir.
- I like your music myself.

970
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,312
Makes me think of home.

971
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,856
My children play your
records day and night.

972
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,776
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- Certainly.

973
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:34,989
I'd like to suggest that I be given
the authority to form my own band.

974
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,699
Play my kind of music.

975
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,826
Most of my men are in the service.

976
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:43,247
If we can be sent overseas,
I know we can be of value.

977
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:47,251
As you say, I think we can
give the boys a piece of home.

978
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,462
I must say I agree
with you, Miller.

979
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,542
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, sir.

980
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:08,269
Glenn!

981
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:11,692
Well, gee, I didn't expect this!

982
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,819
General Arnold brought us.

983
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:17,573
General, thank you. I appreciate
everything you've done.

984
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:21,660
A pleasure. I'll probably get
court-martialled but I brought 'em anyway.

985
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,495
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

986
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,873
- Goodbye and thank you.
- I enjoyed it.

987
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,125
- Goodbye, General.
- Goodbye.

988
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,502
Well, Jonnie Dee.

989
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:34,089
You got a hug for your daddy?
Got a hug for your daddy?

990
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,008
That's a girl!

991
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:39,261
How about you, young man?
How about you?

992
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:41,972
- Can I fly in your airplane?
- I'm afraid not.

993
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,558
You have to stay and take
care of your mother.

994
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,186
You be good and don't
cause him any trouble.

995
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:51,023
- I'll try not to. You take care of yourself.
- Don't worry.

996
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:54,276
You show 'em a picture of
me every once in a while.

997
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:57,362
I promise. And I'll read them
your letters, if you write.

998
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:59,239
I'm gonna write.

999
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,618
Gee, I'm gettin' homesick already.

1000
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:07,331
It's funny how you can miss a
person even before he's gone.

1001
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:09,534
Hurry it up, Glenn.

1002
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:13,170
Goodbye, dear.
Goodbye, Stevie. Bye.

1003
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,784
This is Glenn Miller and the
American Band of the AEF.

1004
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:30,164
coming to you from Buzz Bomb Alley
through the courtesy of the BBC.

1005
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:34,001
And to all you GI boys and girls
a long, long way from home,

1006
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:38,255
and to all our British friends as well,
we hope to give you a little lift.

1007
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:39,923
That's why we're here.

1008
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:44,469
We'll start right out by seeing
if we can put you In The Mood.

1009
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:16,807
Thank you. A little while ago
an airplane landed out here

1010
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:21,353
and out stepped a singing
group that you all know.

1011
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,688
They sang with me
back in the States.

1012
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:27,025
Let's give 'em a good, warm
welcome. The Modernaires!

1013
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:29,274
The Modernaires!

1014
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:39,162
And somebody else stepped out of that
same airplane. A big surprise, boys.

1015
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,373
Here's a girl you all know.

1016
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:44,334
She's flown across the ocean
just to sing for you.

1017
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:48,711
Let's give her a good, big ETO
welcome. Frances Langford!

1018
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:54,803
Hi, Frances.

1019
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,518
- Thank you, Glenn.
- Thank you.

1020
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:04,518
- That's from Helen.
- Bless your heart.

1021
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:11,778
I'll start out by taking you on a
trip south of the Mason-Dixon line.

1022
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:15,574
Let's all get aboard that
old Chattanooga Choo Choo.

Seems a million years
since we made that.

1056
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:56,263
I wrote Glenn what you asked.

1057
01:43:57,064 --> 01:44:00,442
I want to read you his
answer. He says...

1058
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:02,652
"Tell Chummy not to take the job.

1059
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:06,281
"As long as there's a Glenn Miller
Band, he'll be a part of it.

1060
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:09,534
"Don and I have been making
plans for after the war.

1061
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:12,036
"I have a lot of ideas
for new arrangements,

1062
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:15,540
"so tell Chummy to start looking
for a friendly pawn shop."

1063
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:19,502
Friendly pawn shop.
He hasn't changed, has he?

1064
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:23,465
Yes, he has! He's been promoted.
He's Major Glenn Miller now.

1065
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:27,761
Major? That's wonderful.
I wish I could've gone with him.

1066
01:44:27,762 --> 01:44:32,098
You'd have made a fine soldier
with your heart and ulcers!

1067
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:36,270
I've got two eyes and ten fingers.
That's all you need to play the piano.

1068
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:40,273
They're going to Paris.
I told you that.

1069
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:44,194
And he says, "We're doing a special
programme on Christmas Day."

1070
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,279
It's gonna be broadcast over here.

1071
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:51,075
"Be sure and listen cos I'm sending you
an extra special Christmas present."

1072
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:54,120
And I'll know what it is if
I listen to the programme.

1073
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:58,827
- I wonder what he's gonna do.
- I don't know. But I'm sure gonna listen.

1074
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:21,523
- Morning, Glenn.
- Morning, Colonel.

1075
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:24,067
- I sure appreciate the lift.
- Not at all.

1076
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:26,194
- You coming too?
- No. Tomorrow.

1077
01:45:26,195 --> 01:45:28,238
I got some work to do in Paris.

1078
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:32,033
They're gonna let us do some
shows at the advance bases.

1079
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:34,202
It's kinda soupy, isn't it?

1080
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:37,828
It's always this way in
December. Shall we hop in?

1081
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:42,502
Don, I don't know where I'll be,
so as soon as you land at Orly,

1082
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,712
get in touch with the dispatcher.

1083
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:47,382
Be sure the band goes over
that new arrangement.

1084
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:50,552
- I want to use it.
- Right. See you tomorrow.

1085
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:54,474
Pick up my mail. I'm expecting
a letter from Helen. Bye.

1086
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,797
All right, hurry it up, you guys.

1087
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:31,548
This is Paris. You wanted to
see it. Now's your chance.

1088
01:46:39,685 --> 01:46:44,480
I'm Lieutenant Haynes. Did Major Glenn
Miller leave a message here for me?

1089
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:47,317
Nothing here, sir. Did
you try Flight Control?

1090
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:52,570
No, he said he'd leave it here. He came
with Colonel Baessell on the Norseman.

1091
01:46:55,534 --> 01:46:57,493
The flight wasn't logged in.

1092
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,830
No Norseman has landed
here in two or three days.

1093
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:02,783
Thanks.

1094
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:13,384
- General! I thought you were in Europe.
- Just arrived.

1095
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:16,846
- May I congratulate you on your promotion?
- Thank you.

1096
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,848
Five Star final.

1097
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:21,302
Sounds like a late evening paper.

1098
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:26,689
- Have you heard about Glenn Miller?
- Yes, this morning.

1099
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,316
Notified his family yet?

1100
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:32,028
We've been ordered to withhold
notifications until after Christmas.

1101
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:37,033
His band is broadcasting tomorrow.
We can't let Mrs Miller find out that way.

1102
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:40,536
- Do you mind if I call her personally?
- Of course not.

1103
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:42,910
- Use my telephone.
- Thank you.

1104
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:54,092
It's still a couple of minutes
before the broadcast, Helen.

1105
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:58,221
You know, I never realised how
wonderful friends could be.

1106
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:01,224
Even General Arnold,
he called me himself.

1107
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:05,851
That's why he's where he is, maybe,
because he's that kind of a guy.

1108
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:22,161
Last night when I couldn't
sleep, I got to thinking.

1109
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:24,205
It come to me about this broadcast.

1110
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:27,376
You know, Helen, this is a test.

1111
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:30,294
A test? How do you mean?

1112
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:34,215
You remember how much
we talked, all of us,

1113
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:38,803
about how Glenn's band
was something different?

1114
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:42,975
Something permanent?
An institution, like!

1115
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:47,353
Yeah, Glenn and I
talked about it often.

1116
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:49,647
Don't you see what Si's getting at?

1117
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:54,694
If the band goes on, even if Glenn's
not with it, that's the proof.

1118
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:58,865
It means that Glenn's band, Glenn's
music, keeps right on going,

1119
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:03,619
and the kids'll be dancing
to it for years and years.

1120
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,496
That's what he wanted.

1121
01:49:05,497 --> 01:49:09,083
'We take you now to Paris
for a special programme.'

1122
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:53,669
'As some of you might know,
Major Glenn Miller is not with us today.

1123
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:59,175
'But in his absence, we shall do this
programme exactly as he had planned it.

1124
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:01,677
'Our first number is
a new arrangement

1125
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:05,848
'which Major Miller himself made
especially for this performance.

1126
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:08,142
'This tune should
be a familiar one,

1127
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:14,066
'especially to the members of Major Miller's
family across the ocean who are listening.'
