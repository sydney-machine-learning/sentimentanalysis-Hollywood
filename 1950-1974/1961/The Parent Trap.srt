1
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,821
<i>If their love's on skids,
treat your folks like kids</i>

2
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,741
<i>Or your family tree's gonna snap</i>

3
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>So to make'em dig,
first you gotta rig</i>

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,538
<i>What have you gotta rig?</i>

5
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>The Parent Trap</i>

6
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>If they lose that zing
and they just won't swing</i>

7
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,652
<i>Then the problem falls in your lap</i>

8
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>When your folks are square,
then you must prepare</i>

9
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>What have you gotta prepare?
The Parent Trap</i>

10
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,269
<i>To set the bait, recreate the date</i>

11
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,272
<i>The first time Cupid shot 'em</i>

12
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,443
<i>Get 'em under the moon,
play their favourite tune</i>

13
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,030
- John!
- Marcia!

14
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>You got 'em!</i>

15
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:15,360
<i>Lead 'em back to love
with a velvet glove</i>

16
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:18,447
<i>'Cause they're much too old
for the strap</i>

17
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:23,910
<i>Straighten out the mess with togetherness
Togetherness!</i>

18
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:26,997
<i>The Parent Trap</i>

19
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:31,418
John, they're playing our song.

20
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,796
Marcia, what fools we've been.

21
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:39,426
<i>Straighten out their mess
with togetherness</i>

22
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,678
<i>Togetherness</i>

23
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:46,266
<i>Straighten out their mess
with togetherness</i>

24
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,184
<i>Togetherness!</i>

25
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,813
<i>The Parent Trap!</i>

26
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,174
All right, girls! A to Ks over here.

27
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:26,764
A to Ks? No, dear, you're an R. Over with
the P to Ss. Have we any X, Y, Zs here?

28
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:31,019
Here are your allergy pills.
One three times a day.

29
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:35,648
And your insect repellent
and your poetry book.

30
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:39,444
- Thank you, Staimes.
- Have a good summer, Miss.

31
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:44,907
- Name?
- McKendrick, Sharon.

32
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,702
- 18 Belgrave Square, Boston?
- Yes.

33
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:51,831
My grandmother said my tent
should be well ventilated.

34
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:55,334
Don't worry. You'll be ventilated.

35
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,420
<i>Next girl.</i>

36
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:03,134
No candy wrappers lying on the ground.
Always tidy.

37
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,512
Latrines over there. Mess hall up the hill.

38
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:11,475
McKendrick, you're in Arapahoe.
Follow me. Girls, wait here.

39
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:18,315
Come, McKendrick.
New arrival, girls. Name's McKendrick.

40
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:21,944
- Hi.
- The girls here will brief you.

41
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:26,115
Sure you'll be happy here.
See you after lunch.

42
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:33,414
- My name is Betsy. This is Ursula.
- How do you do. I'm Sharon.

43
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:43,257
You're in a good tent. Betsy's mother
sends her candy bars every week.

44
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:45,884
- I can't eat candy.
- Why not?

45
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:49,096
My grandmother thinks it ruins my teeth.

46
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,224
Hi, Mary.

47
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:01,108
Come on. I'm starved.

48
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:13,662
- The nerve! Coming here with your face.
- What are you gonna do?

49
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:19,042
- Do? What on earth can I do, silly?
- I'd bite off her nose!

50
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,838
- Who's she?
- I never saw her before.

51
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:31,847
At this time, I want to say welcome
to all our new arrivals.

52
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:36,017
Welcome to Camp Inch, new arrivals.

53
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,523
I am your supreme commander here
and my name is...

54
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,775
Miss Inch.

55
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,153
Yes. Miss Inch.

56
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:55,120
<i>I'd like, at this time, to introduce
a visitor from the next hilltop over,</i>

57
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:58,039
from the Thunderhead Boys' Camp.

58
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,917
Chief Eaglewood.

59
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:11,886
Thank you, Miss Inch,
and hello to all of you.

60
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:16,975
Looks like a crackerjack
troop of girls there.

61
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:23,481
Why am I here?
Well, that's our little surprise.

62
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:27,777
Trooper Stafford, ten-shun!
Stand up, boy.

63
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,822
What a dream!

64
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:37,370
Little surprise for you, young ladies.
Saturday night, we're having a dance.

65
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:42,333
Quiet, girls.

66
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,172
We've asked the Thunderhead Boys' Camp
to come over for the occasion.

67
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,050
We accept your invitation.

68
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,432
A word of warning. Watch your demerits.

69
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,228
Untidy little girls won't go to the dance,

70
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:07,608
so keep those tents clean,
your uniforms spanking fresh,

71
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:12,613
and we'll all be one big happy family!

72
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,332
Oh, no.

73
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:31,424
What are you staring at?

74
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,679
Excuse me, but haven't you noticed?
We look like each other.

75
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:40,099
Turn your head. Let me see that profile.

76
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:45,354
That's who it is!
She's the spitting image of you-know-who.

77
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,232
- Who?
- Frankenstein!

78
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,986
Not wanted!

79
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:02,347
Those monsters! They gopher-trapped us!

80
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:09,521
- Morning, Miss Inch.
- Morning, Miss Grunecker.

81
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:15,235
- Where would you like to start?
- Why not start with tent Arapahoe?

82
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:18,029
I'm sure you'll find it shipshape.

83
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,713
<i>Think of all that we could share</i>

84
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:38,800
<i>Let's get together every day</i>

85
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,678
<i>Every day and everywhere</i>

86
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,472
<i>And though we haven't got a lot</i>

87
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,600
<i>We could be sharing all we've got</i>

88
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:51,062
<i>Together...</i>

89
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:56,150
What if we get some ants
and dump them down her dress?

90
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:59,695
- Impractical.
- How do you find ants at night?

91
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:04,283
The three of them.
I'm so mad I could just spit.

92
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:09,038
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two is twice as nice as one</i>

93
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:12,291
<i>Let's get together right away</i>

94
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:17,421
<i>We'll be having twice the fun
And you can always count on me...</i>

95
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:20,508
I got an idea. Come on.

96
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:24,470
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

97
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,484
- How do you like camp?
- It's OK, I guess.

98
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:44,156
I'm not coming back to this one.
They won't let you wear lipstick or perfume.

99
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:47,284
I feel naked without my lipstick.

100
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:53,666
- Where are you from?
- Monterey, California.

101
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:03,008
- That's great.
- You'd love California. I do.

102
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:08,514
- It's sort of marvellous, actually.
- It sounds great.

103
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,059
It's absolute fun living in California.

104
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:17,022
When I get from camp,
Dad takes me on a trek into the mountains.

105
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:20,984
Gee, that's great. Your mother lets you go?

106
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:25,447
I don't have a mother. Just Dad and me.
He's wonderful.

107
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:30,577
Besides, I know most everything
about camping and wood lore.

108
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:34,289
We have a ball -
just Daddy and me and Hecky.

109
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:37,834
- It's hot out here.
- Who's Hecky?

110
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:43,965
Our ranch foreman. He tells sensational
stories. He used to be a rodeo rider.

111
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:49,262
- They've started the music again.
- I guess we oughta?

112
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:55,393
I love dancing. I could dance all night -
especially with you, Wilfred.

113
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:39,187
- Where could she have done it?
- I don't know! I just went out...

114
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:42,982
Stay out of our tent from now on.

115
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,738
You vicious little wretch!

116
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:54,202
Stop it! Sharon, let go!

117
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,716
Stop it!

118
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:22,271
I've got a cake in my hands! Stop it.

119
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,488
You little wretches!

120
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,287
Congratulations.

121
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:42,792
In the history of our camp,
that was the most infamous,

122
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:50,090
the most revolting, the most disgusting
display of hooliganism we have ever had.

123
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,385
Brawling in front of our guests.

124
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:58,891
And worst of all, sisters
who should be setting a good example.

125
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:03,604
- We're not sisters.
- I've never seen her before.

126
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:09,026
- They are, aren't they?
- No, Ma'am. Just look-alikes.

127
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:13,238
An amazing resemblance.

128
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,875
I gather that you two girls
don't get along together.

129
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:31,548
Have you ever heard
of Gilbert and Sullivan?

130
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:33,300
Yes, Ma'am.

131
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:38,764
They were composers.

132
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:45,228
They wrote a memorable song called
"Let the Punishment Fit the Crime".

133
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,899
Let the punishment fit the crime.

134
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:56,156
Sharon McKendrick, we are waiting.

135
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,545
Girls, follow me.

136
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:06,934
Girls, that's enough of this nonsense!
Go back to your activities!

137
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,687
All right, young ladies.

138
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,405
In here.

139
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,041
Yes...

140
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,627
Yes.

141
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,673
Four weeks left
and you'll spend them together.

142
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,302
Room together, eat together, play together.

143
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:45,890
You'll find a way to live with each other,

144
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:52,480
or you'll punish yourselves far better
than I ever could. Bye, girls.

145
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:21,175
It drives her crazy. I completely ignore her.

146
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:24,219
- Good!
- The Coventry treatment.

147
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:27,890
The silence will drive her out of her mind.

148
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:57,711
- My goodness! Hurry! Quick!
- I've got it!

149
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,797
Turn it down over there. Tight.

150
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:05,343
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

151
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,223
Gosh! Look at this mess!

152
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:18,523
- Are any of them spoilt?
- It didn't do them any good.

153
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,527
Darn! Look at this one. It's ruined.

154
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,739
That's a shame. Who is he?

155
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:29,367
Are you kidding? Ricky Nelson.

156
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,078
Your boyfriend?

157
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:36,750
I wish he was!
You mean you never heard of him?

158
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,920
Where do you come from? Outer space?

159
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,257
No. I'm from Boston.

160
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:48,553
Oh... Boston.

161
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,311
- Where's your home?
- California.

162
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:59,814
I've seen movies of California. Is it nice?

163
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,318
Sensational. We got a ranch in Carmel.

164
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:06,571
I got a picture. You wanna see it?

165
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:14,328
That's the house.
The stables go off down there.

166
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:18,082
- How lovely.
- I got my own horse.

167
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:24,797
We've got a lake. You can fall out of
the front door and go swimming any time.

168
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:34,682
- Who is this?
- My Dad. Isn't he dreamy?

169
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:41,939
He's very handsome. Is it cold in here?

170
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:45,276
I'm hot. Want a Fig Newton?

171
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:53,451
What's your pop like? Is he a friend
or one of those busy types?

172
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:57,037
I don't have a father, actually.

173
00:20:57,204 --> 00:21:01,250
Mummy and Daddy separated.
She never mentions him now.

174
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:06,463
It's scary the way
nobody stays together these days.

175
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,302
- There'll be more divorces than marriages!
- Isn't it the truth?

176
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,890
- How old are you?
- 13.

177
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:20,227
So am I. I can't wait till I'm 18.

178
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:23,939
I'll get my own car
and go dancing till midnight.

179
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:29,194
- I'll be 14 November 12th.
- No kidding? That's my birthday too.

180
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:34,074
Isn't that peculiar? November 12th?

181
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:37,452
Hm-mm. Funny, isn't it?

182
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:40,455
Oh-oh. This one's full.

183
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:45,085
Hey, it's stopped raining!

184
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,234
- What is your mother like?
- I can't remember her.

185
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,487
- Did she die?
- Nope.

186
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:18,451
Busted up with Dad.
But she was fabulous, absolutely fabulous.

187
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:22,414
- How do you know?
- A picture on Daddy's desk.

188
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:25,917
But he caught me looking at it
and it's gone now.

189
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,134
Do you want to come
and get a popsicle with me?

190
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,345
How can you think of that
at a time like this?

191
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:39,514
At a time like what?

192
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:48,481
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know what's happening?

193
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:54,195
Don't you find it peculiar that we're
so alike and have the same birthday?

194
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,991
It's just one of those things, isn't it?

195
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:03,871
Will you come inside a minute, please?

196
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:20,930
Mother says I'm psychic. That I can sense
when something odd is going to happen.

197
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:24,809
I always get goose bumps. Look.

198
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,103
So what?

199
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:43,703
I don't understand.

200
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:48,290
What are you doing with her picture?

201
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,712
It's my mother.

202
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,759
But it's my mother too.

203
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:10,604
Lunch.

204
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:15,484
You go. I'm not hungry.

205
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:05,450
- I didn't know what to say.
- I know. I didn't either.

206
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:09,913
Golly! Sisters!

207
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:24,302
You know what probably happened?

208
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:27,222
They must have quarrelled and parted,

209
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:32,060
and just sort of bisected us -
each taking one of us.

210
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:36,439
- Why do you suppose they separated?
- I don't know.

211
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:40,860
I can't imagine anyone not loving Mother.
She's divine.

212
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:46,157
What about Dad? He's a sensational person,
as a friend and all.

213
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:51,079
The thing is that neither of them
got married again.

214
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:54,457
- You see what that means?
- Not really.

215
00:25:54,624 --> 00:26:00,380
In their innermost hearts, they must
still be in love with each other.

216
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:03,550
Then why have they stayed separated?

217
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:07,262
That's how true love creates
its beautiful agony.

218
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:10,765
All splendid lovers have dreadful times.

219
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:15,269
Pelléas and Mélisande,
Daphnis and Chloë.

220
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:20,024
History's jammed with stories of lovers
parted by some silly thing.

221
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:37,333
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, boy! Oh, my gosh!
- What's the matter?

222
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:42,380
You want to meet Father
and I'm dying to know Mother.

223
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:44,632
Well, what if?

224
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,303
It's so scary,
but we might be able to pull it off.

225
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,639
Pull what off?

226
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:57,103
- Switch places.
- Switch?

227
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:01,107
We could do it. We're twins.
I want to know Mother.

228
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:04,068
Look! Now I'm getting goose bumps.

229
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:08,072
Me too.

230
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:12,117
There's more to it
than just switching places.

231
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:15,329
- I believe fate brought us together.
- How so?

232
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:18,999
If we switched, they'd have to unswitch us.

233
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,919
Mother would bring me to California.

234
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:26,006
- They'd have to meet again.
- Face to face.

235
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,927
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Exactly.

236
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:31,845
Let's get to work.

237
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:54,576
It's amazing.

238
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,956
You should wear this to meet Dad.

239
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:05,796
This is gorgeous! I'm going to wear this one
when I go to Boston. I adore it!

240
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:11,301
Susan, pay attention. The music room
and library are on the first floor.

241
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:15,764
Your room is the second door
on the second floor on the left.

242
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:19,351
The horse is Schotzli
and the dog is Andromeda.

243
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:24,648
Verbena collects the dirty laundry
on Monday... Sharon, pay attention!

244
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:27,817
But dirty socks are on Thursday.

245
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:34,199
My favourite food is chilli beans
and you gotta chew gum because I do.

246
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:40,747
Flat A's. Remember, all your A's are flat.
Talk fast 'cause everybody talks fast.

247
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:43,833
But I never bite my nails!

248
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,963
Sharon, you gotta. I always chew mine.
Anyhow, Dad'll know.

249
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,257
Go on, bite 'em!

250
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:59,432
Can't. Shan't. Aunt. Hmm?

251
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,936
No. Cah-n't. Shah-n't. Aunt.

252
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:08,775
Cah-n't. Shah-n't. Aunt.
Oh, I can't wait till camp is over.

253
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:12,195
- Cah-n't wait.
- OK. I cah-n't wait.

254
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:21,454
- But, Daddy...
- You're not taking it home!

255
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:29,796
Oh, Daddy, you big meany!
I spent so much time trying to get him.

256
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:36,928
It's got to be done methodically.
Recollection and memory.

257
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:42,225
- Get her talking about how they met.
- Find out about that first date.

258
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:44,769
- Sharon!
- That's you.

259
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:46,312
Coming!

260
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:52,944
You must bring Mother to California.
Boston is no place to rekindle a romance.

261
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,988
Sharon McKendrick!

262
00:29:56,155 --> 00:30:02,787
Goodbye, girls. Sharon McKendrick!
Your chauffeur's waiting, dear. Hurry.

263
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:10,086
The punishment was harsh, I know,
but you've survived it

264
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:13,005
and I hope you've both learned something.

265
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:19,678
<i>- You'd be surprised, Miss Inch.
- Goodbye, Sharon. See you next summer.</i>

266
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:27,061
Goodbye, Miss Inch... I cah-n't tell you
how very much I've enjoyed my stay.

267
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:31,774
I shah-n't tell my aunt
about the aunts... ants,

268
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:35,986
nor the debutantes, shall I? Bye.

269
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:44,036
- What did you do to your hair?
- I cut it. It was too hot long.

270
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:47,122
Wait till your grandmother sees it.

271
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:04,723
Miss Lockness, Bettina...
Upstairs. Third door to the left.

272
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,060
What's her name?

273
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,830
- Here goes nothing.
- What?

274
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:41,176
<i>...The white wine and... Do we have
any more of the Louis St George?</i>

275
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:45,013
We'd better have tickets
for the ladies' wraps.

276
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,310
Rosa, I want all the gilt chairs
in the music room.

277
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:54,481
- You asked me to remind you...
- Yes, yes.

278
00:31:54,647 --> 00:32:00,028
Do see the maids keep quiet. They must
empty the ashtrays without clinking.

279
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:03,573
- Yes...
- I want both Steinways at the north end.

280
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,619
- Have you checked the delivery?
- I'll see about it now.

281
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:11,331
- You're home from camp.
- Hello, Miss Lockness.

282
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:15,501
- Did you bring home all your underwear?
- It's in my luggage.

283
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:19,631
Probably full of germs.
What have you done to your hair?

284
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:24,302
- Do you like it?
- Wait till your grandmother sees it.

285
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:27,138
Who's that I hear out there?

286
00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:32,727
Is that my little girl?
That tall gangly thing?

287
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:37,356
- Hi, Grandfather.
- Hello, sweetheart. Oh, my.

288
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:41,778
Let me look at you. Have you had?

289
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:45,990
- What's the matter, dear?
- I'm just happy to see you.

290
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:51,120
And I'm happy to see you too.
Your Grandpa missed you around here.

291
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:56,167
It was an awful...
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

292
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:59,795
- Making a memory.
- Making a memory?

293
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:03,174
Years from now, when I'm quite grown up,

294
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:07,011
I'll remember how Grandfather
always smells of...

295
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:12,850
- ...tobacco and peppermint.
- Tobacco and peppermint!

296
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:20,357
I use the peppermint for my indigestion and
the tobacco to make your grandmother mad.

297
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,903
Sharon!

298
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,363
Sharon!

299
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,616
Welcome home, darling.

300
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:37,708
- Mother!
- It's so good to have you home.

301
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:42,963
Let me look at you...
What on earth have you done to your hair?

302
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,300
- Cut it.
- That's certainly obvious.

303
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,053
I thought something was different.

304
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:53,140
What's done is done. It'll grow again.

305
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:59,354
What's the matter, Sharon?
Are those tears I see?

306
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:06,695
- I can't help it, Mother. If only you knew.
- Knew what?

307
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:12,367
- Sharon! When did you get back?
- She just arrived. She looks wonderful.

308
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:16,538
What have you done to your hair?

309
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:19,416
- She cut it.
- I had to because...

310
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:24,713
If my opinion means anything -
which I doubt - I like it the way it is.

311
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,508
- Charles, stop burbling.
- I haven't burbled in years.

312
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,886
Go and read your newspaper.

313
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,974
- See you at dinner.
- Bye.

314
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,977
It doesn't look so bad.

315
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:44,774
It's hoydenish. Are you a boy or a girl?
Make up your mind. What's that?

316
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:49,904
It's a present I brought for you.
We made it... I made it for you.

317
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:54,993
- Thank you. What is it?
- A birdcage made of popsicle sticks.

318
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,122
- Come on upstairs with me.
- See you later.

319
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:09,591
- Did you make any friends?
- One girl in particular.

320
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:12,343
- Who is she?
- Just a girl.

321
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,306
- From Boston?
- No. Just from someplace.

322
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,018
Goodness, you're beautiful.

323
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:26,608
What is it? You're staring at me
as if you've never seen me before.

324
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:32,905
I don't know. I'm just happy
that you're here and you're you.

325
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:38,036
I'm happy that you're here and you're you.
Fasten me up.

326
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,459
- Did you miss me?
- Uh-huh. Did you miss me?

327
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,711
You'll never know.

328
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:52,341
Margaret, don't forget the Red Cross
meeting. I'll see you at the Somerset.

329
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:58,097
Stand up, child. Don't slouch. I hope
you haven't picked up bad habits.

330
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:01,434
- See you at the Somerset.
- Yes, Mother.

331
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:05,146
Why the frown?

332
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:10,776
You've got meetings and things.
I thought we could spend the day talking.

333
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:15,614
We have the whole weekend to talk.
I cannot cancel the Red Cross.

334
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:31,714
- What I have to say can wait.
- Yes, dear?

335
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:37,845
I just wanted to have a woman-to-woman talk
with you about Stafford.

336
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:40,222
Who's Stafford?

337
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:45,644
This boy I met at camp.
I just wanted your advice on something.

338
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:47,813
On what?

339
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:55,279
Well... I wanted you to tell me how long
you waited before you got married.

340
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:02,578
Sharon?

341
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:13,338
- Lockness?
- Yes, Miss Margaret.

342
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:18,010
Please tell my mother I can't meet her
and cancel my appointments.

343
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:22,597
- Cancel them?
- Yes. Something important has come up.

344
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:32,649
Sharon, what I'm trying to say
is that the decision to marry

345
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:35,735
is best left till you've lived longer.

346
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:40,240
Mother, you're right.
Stafford was much too juvenile for me.

347
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,868
Thank goodness for that.

348
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:47,080
To be perfectly frank,
the old zing wasn't there.

349
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:49,332
- Zing?
- Yes.

350
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:55,130
The charge that shoots up your spine.
Like when you met Daddy.

351
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,301
What was Daddy like?

352
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:04,806
Well, I don't know how we got around to him.

353
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:08,727
Is it terribly painful for you
to talk about Daddy?

354
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:11,604
No. Why should it be?

355
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:17,277
I don't know. I thought maybe when
you've been in love with somebody...

356
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:23,032
the recollection and the memory
might be bitterly painful.

357
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,120
Sharon, that was many years ago.
Don't dramatise it.

358
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:30,123
Where did he take you on your first date?

359
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:36,671
He took me to dinner - an Italian restaurant
in one of those basements in New York.

360
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:40,758
- It was called "Martinelli's".
- "Martinelli's"?

361
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,720
- Yes.
- Hmm.

362
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:48,724
You said there was music.
What song did they play?

363
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:52,019
- Song?
- There must have been a song.

364
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:55,731
The old "they're playing our song" thing.

365
00:38:55,898 --> 00:39:01,779
If there was, I wouldn't remember it.
It was too long ago.

366
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,056
<i>Though time may tatter</i>

367
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:33,769
<i>Our first sweet thrill</i>

368
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,273
<i>It doesn't matter</i>

369
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:40,651
<i>It never will...</i>

370
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,681
Susie!

371
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:57,352
- Hi, Peanut.
- Hi, Dad.

372
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,355
- How was camp?
- Fine.

373
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:05,527
No broken bones? No?
Come on, let's get the bags.

374
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:13,034
Here's my baggage check.

375
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:18,415
- Are you still biting your nails?
- You noticed. She told me you...

376
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,585
- What?
- Nothing.

377
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:28,466
I certainly did enjoy
all those nice long newsy letters.

378
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:35,098
We meant to write, but we just got
so tied up with plans and things...

379
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:40,561
- Who's we?
- Er... us. I mean... l...

380
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:46,609
Oh, us. There was a very nice girl there.
We became quite good friends.

381
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:50,530
That's mine. That's mine. There.

382
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:03,584
- Glad to be home?
- It's wonderful.

383
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:09,799
- Were you lonely while I was gone?
- I cried myself to sleep...

384
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,968
No. Seriously.

385
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:17,932
I got to play golf every day, poker at night.
I'd like to find a winter camp too.

386
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:22,978
- Ho ho!
- Ho ho! Good to have you home, goofy.

387
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:29,443
There's been a lot of things happening
since you left.

388
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,279
We ought to have a talk sometime.

389
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:36,534
- I have some things to tell you too.
- You have?

390
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,786
- But not now.
- OK.

391
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:44,500
Now I just want to think about getting home
and being with my father.

392
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:48,003
- My very own fah-ther.
- Own fah-ther?

393
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:51,048
Father.

394
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:03,852
Dad, it's beautiful!

395
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:07,815
It hasn't changed. Hecky!

396
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:10,067
- Yo!
- Look!

397
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:13,779
What have you got there with you, Mitch?

398
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:16,532
- Hi, Hecky.
- Hiya, darlin'.

399
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:22,246
Why did you bring her back?
I thought we'd got rid of her.

400
00:43:22,412 --> 00:43:25,290
She was hanging around the airport.

401
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:28,168
- How was camp?
- Swell.

402
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:31,630
It's about time. We've been waiting all day!

403
00:43:31,797 --> 00:43:33,674
Hi, Verbena.

404
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,385
Never mind hi. Give me a hug.

405
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:39,388
Hello, honey. Let me look at you.

406
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:46,353
- There's a change in you.
- Just the same as I always was.

407
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,149
No... You're not.
I'm not quite sure what it is.

408
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:53,360
Hi, Andromeda.

409
00:43:55,403 --> 00:44:01,993
Stop that, Andromeda, you crazy dog.
It's Susan, you silly.

410
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,413
It's almost as if
your own dog didn't know you.

411
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:10,085
Funny, isn't it? Dogs are funny things.

412
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:13,713
I guess I'll go up to my room and...

413
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:37,904
- Come on and tell me about camp.
- Coming.

414
00:44:43,493 --> 00:44:47,330
Tell me all about camp.
I want to get your laundry too.

415
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:51,709
- Come down when you get through.
- Be down in a minute.

416
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:57,965
Hello, darling. I'm glad you're back.
I was beginning to get bored.

417
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:01,385
Did you tell her anything about us?

418
00:45:12,396 --> 00:45:15,858
- Good to be home again.
- Sure is.

419
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:20,363
Verbena... there's a woman downstairs.

420
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:23,074
There is indeed.

421
00:45:25,242 --> 00:45:28,204
Who is she? What is she doing here?

422
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:32,166
I'm not saying a word.
I mind my own business.

423
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:38,214
If he wants to make a ninny of himself,
that's his affair.

424
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,969
- How did she get here?
- I don't say a word.

425
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:51,936
Except a man like your father
with a daughter going on 14...

426
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:59,318
He's not exactly a charm fellow with
a big teethy grin and lots of clever talk,

427
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:02,780
- so what does she see in him?
- I don't know.

428
00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:06,909
I'll give you a million reasons
and they're in the bank.

429
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:09,370
It was always thus.

430
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:11,914
What was always thus?

431
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:18,504
I'm not saying a word. I'm not one to talk
about anybody behind their back.

432
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:26,386
But she's good. She's awful good.

433
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:30,849
Those cool blue eyes
looking right through you.

434
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:35,812
Riding, swimming, out to dinner,
but it's none of my business,

435
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:39,941
so I'm not saying a word,
not one single word.

436
00:46:40,108 --> 00:46:43,278
Besides, you shouldn't talk about people...

437
00:46:56,416 --> 00:47:00,837
Susie. We were just talking about you.
This is Miss Robinson.

438
00:47:01,004 --> 00:47:05,717
- How do you do.
- I've been looking forward to meeting you.

439
00:47:05,884 --> 00:47:10,847
Your father made you sound like a girl,
but you're practically a woman.

440
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:15,268
- I'm nearly 14.
- I think I'll make a couple of Martinis.

441
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:19,022
- I'd love one.
- Honey, do you want a ginger ale?

442
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:22,734
- Ginger ale.
- Sure. You get acquainted now.

443
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:28,490
- I hear you were away at camp. Was it fun?
- Yes, it was lovely, thank you.

444
00:47:28,656 --> 00:47:33,161
Ever since I met your father,
it's been Susan this and Susan that.

445
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:40,043
It's wonderful that you're such
good friends. Can you keep a secret?

446
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,338
- From whom?
- Your father.

447
00:47:43,504 --> 00:47:46,382
Then you'd better not tell me.

448
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:52,388
Daddy and I don't keep secrets from one
another. We tell each other everything.

449
00:47:52,555 --> 00:47:56,934
No, dear. It wasn't that kind of a secret.

450
00:47:57,101 --> 00:48:01,939
I just wanted to tell you that I find him
a very wonderful person.

451
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:09,280
Well, between us, he's not too brilliant
or clever with what he says.

452
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:13,409
You know, like the charm fellows
we all adore.

453
00:48:13,576 --> 00:48:17,872
We were riding the other day
and he let me ride Schotzli.

454
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:23,961
I understand she's your horse.
I hope you don't mind my riding her.

455
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:29,133
No. Schotzli and I
are used to strange women riding her.

456
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,177
What?

457
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:35,556
You know Daddy.
He's always playing the field.

458
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:39,351
- No, I didn't know.
- Oh, yes.

459
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:42,396
Every week he has some dame up here.

460
00:48:42,563 --> 00:48:48,652
One week - I'll never forget -
he had five different women up here.

461
00:48:48,819 --> 00:48:50,613
You don't say.

462
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:55,910
It's none of my business
if he wants to make a ninny of himself.

463
00:48:56,076 --> 00:49:00,623
That's why I'm not saying a word.
Not one single word.

464
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:06,295
Here you are.
Did you two get to know each other?

465
00:49:06,462 --> 00:49:10,716
Yes. We had a lovely little talk.

466
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:52,716
Hello?

467
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:54,634
<i>- Susan Evers?
- Yes.</i>

468
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:58,221
<i>- Go ahead.
- It's Sharon. How's everything?</i>

469
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:03,310
Mother's the absolute living end!
She's gorgeous, breathtaking.

470
00:50:03,477 --> 00:50:07,647
I got her talking about her first date.
Italian dinner...

471
00:50:07,814 --> 00:50:09,482
Susan, listen!

472
00:50:09,649 --> 00:50:13,528
<i>And their song goes like this.
For now, for always...</i>

473
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:16,573
I've got something to tell you...

474
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,283
<i>- Susan!
- What?</i>

475
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,077
You have to bring Mother out here now.

476
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:25,332
No! I just had one day with her.
I hardly got to know her.

477
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:30,086
It's an emergency.
There's a woman here and she's beautiful.

478
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:33,298
Is that all? Dad'll never get serious.

479
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:37,969
He's serious about this one.
He's trying to get us to be friends.

480
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:42,849
Well, bust it up.
Follow them and submarine her.

481
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:47,187
- You've got to get Mother out here.
- I want more time.

482
00:50:47,353 --> 00:50:53,735
You've had her for 13 years! I won't. Do
the best you can and stay on Daddy's tail.

483
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:58,740
- Susan, please!
- I won't give up Mother this soon. Goodbye.

484
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:00,950
Susan?

485
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:14,755
I'm glad you came today. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

486
00:51:14,922 --> 00:51:18,718
- What is it?
- You know the girl you met - Vicky?

487
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:23,973
I thought we ought to be alone a little
so we could talk.

488
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,228
- I wanted to talk about something too.
- OK. Go ahead.

489
00:51:29,395 --> 00:51:33,941
Those weeks at camp,
I've been wondering about my mother.

490
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:37,903
Why do you want to wonder
about something like that?

491
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:42,116
It's perfectly natural for a girl.
Where is she?

492
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:46,912
I don't know. Maybe she went to Spain
and married some drunk.

493
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:49,331
Daddy, that's not true.

494
00:51:49,498 --> 00:51:52,001
All right. You wouldn't like her anyway.

495
00:51:52,168 --> 00:51:58,424
Big staring eyes, red frizzy hair
and she was fat, really fat.

496
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,218
Then why did you fall in love with her?

497
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:07,182
You lose your head sometimes.
Besides, I... Wait a minute.

498
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,981
Fletcher, play on through.
I'll pick you up at the bar.

499
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:18,569
Sit down.

500
00:52:21,113 --> 00:52:25,409
Honey, you don't want to start
thinking about your mother.

501
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:30,622
There's no need for that.
You can always talk to me about anything.

502
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:32,875
It's not the same.

503
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:38,422
Father and daughter is OK,
but when a girl gets to a certain age,

504
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:41,216
that's when she misses a mother.

505
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:45,470
Why? I mean...

506
00:52:46,888 --> 00:52:51,393
- You mean to talk about certain things?
- Yeah.

507
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,145
That?

508
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:58,316
I guess we never have talked about that.

509
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:02,904
This is a kind of odd place,
but it's as good as any.

510
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:05,949
We might as well get it over with.

511
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:11,830
- How much do you know already?
- About what?

512
00:53:11,997 --> 00:53:16,001
- About what you were talking about.
- Absolutely nothing.

513
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:20,046
- Nothing?
- Well, you never brought up the subject.

514
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:29,097
Well, honey... All right. Let's get straight
on one thing first. Little boys.

515
00:53:29,264 --> 00:53:35,979
I know how they are because I used to be
a little boy once, so I know.

516
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:40,442
- I don't know...
- I used to be a little boy and I know.

517
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:46,114
- I know about it.
- Daddy, you're too funny for words.

518
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:51,494
- What do you mean?
- I've known about all that for years.

519
00:53:53,454 --> 00:53:58,167
- What were we just talking about then?
- What were you talking about?

520
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:00,420
Well, er...

521
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:08,011
I'd better putt out.

522
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:14,809
There's the little beast now.

523
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,483
She's nothing but a child.

524
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,362
She's a conniving, vicious, two-faced brat.

525
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,656
Just smile, pet.

526
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:35,538
Think of California and that wonderful
community property law, and just smile.

527
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,291
- Hi.
- Hello, Mitchell, darling.

528
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:43,379
- Hi, Edna.
- Who is this ecstatic bright-eyed child?

529
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:46,173
- It couldn't be...
- Sure. It's Susie.

530
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,343
- This is Vicky's mother.
- How do you do.

531
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:54,890
- This girl is the one you call Peanut Face?
- Daddy, really!

532
00:54:55,057 --> 00:55:01,939
Come over here to your Auntie Edna
and we can get to know one another.

533
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:06,735
I want to hear all about you. Down you go.

534
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:09,280
- Hi.
- Did you tell her?

535
00:55:09,446 --> 00:55:13,033
I started to,
then I don't know what happened.

536
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,162
- Oh, Mitch...
- All right. Let me do it my own way.

537
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:23,836
It's all settled. Susan and I have decided
we'll all have a jolly lunch here.

538
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:27,172
Edna, I'm sorry, we can't today.

539
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:30,968
I promised to spend the whole day
with Susie.

540
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:36,807
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right. Another time, dear.

541
00:55:36,974 --> 00:55:42,145
- You're an adorable thing!
- We're going to take a ride.

542
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:45,274
- Have fun.
- Bye, darling.

543
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,154
First change I make, off she goes
to a boarding school in Switzerland.

544
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:21,726
Honey, I've been meaning to ask you...
what do you think of Vicky?

545
00:56:21,893 --> 00:56:24,187
In what respect?

546
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:28,984
Well... It's just an ordinary question.

547
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,029
No, it's not.
You asked me what I think of Vicky.

548
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:35,782
What do I think of Vicky as what?

549
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:42,247
If you asked me what do I think of her
as a fashion model or a famous aviatrix,

550
00:56:42,414 --> 00:56:47,127
then maybe I can express an opinion,
but just to ask...

551
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:53,341
All right. What do you think of Vicky
as a person?

552
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:59,722
Daddy, I really couldn't say.
She's a perfect stranger to me.

553
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:03,309
- Race you to the house!
- Wait a minute. Susie!

554
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:06,104
I'm not through talking to you!

555
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:25,414
Hi, darling.

556
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:27,375
- Hi.
- Hello, sweetie.

557
00:57:33,005 --> 00:57:35,633
He can't. He just can't.

558
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,344
It makes me so mad.

559
00:57:38,511 --> 00:57:41,013
A man of his age.

560
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,183
All our work and our plans!

561
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:49,522
Hi.

562
00:57:56,529 --> 00:57:59,532
You used to confide in me.

563
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:04,453
Anything you want to talk over with me?

564
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,288
No.

565
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:10,709
Like telling me why Andromeda
never comes near you?

566
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:15,881
Or why your appetite's changed?

567
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,718
Verbena, you are a mystic.

568
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:22,638
Mystic? I'm no mystic.

569
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:26,058
Asking me all these crazy questions.

570
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:29,228
I don't know what you're getting at.

571
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:38,570
You know what I'm talking about.
There's something very strange about you.

572
00:58:38,737 --> 00:58:42,908
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to tell me?

573
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,787
What do you want me to tell you?

574
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:50,332
I don't know. It's almost as if you were...

575
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:55,963
- That's impossible.
- Almost as if I were who?

576
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:58,966
Forget it, honey. Never mind.

577
00:59:00,092 --> 00:59:02,344
You mean Sharon?

578
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:13,939
Where did you hear about her?

579
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:17,984
Oh, Verbena.

580
00:59:19,444 --> 00:59:25,951
I've got to tell someone, but you've
got to swear never to tell Daddy. Promise?

581
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:30,288
- Try to be diplomatic.
- I know how to talk to my daughter.

582
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:33,750
She's not exactly insensitive.

583
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,964
Susan!

584
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,385
Hi, Dad. Just getting back?

585
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:49,474
- Just a minute. I want to talk to you.
- Didn't know what a good thing you had.

586
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:51,267
Susie!

587
00:59:56,481 --> 01:00:00,527
Why did you run off? I want to talk to you.

588
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:02,862
I'm listening.

589
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:10,286
- Get comfortable.
- I am comfortable. What do you want?

590
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:13,331
First of all, about me.

591
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:20,296
You probably think of me as just your father
and to you I seem ancient and old...

592
01:00:20,463 --> 01:00:25,385
- Not ancient, Daddy.
- Certainly not. I'm in my best years.

593
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:30,348
- OK. Don't get nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

594
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:34,727
What seems old to you
isn't really old when you get old...

595
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:41,359
I mean, when you get to be my age
it won't seem old to you at all and you'll...

596
01:00:42,568 --> 01:00:45,696
Where did you learn how to play the piano?

597
01:00:45,863 --> 01:00:51,953
- Oh... They taught us at camp.
- That's awfully good in five weeks...

598
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:56,666
Could you stop now?

599
01:00:56,832 --> 01:00:58,542
- Sure.
- Pay attention.

600
01:00:59,585 --> 01:01:03,881
I've been wanting
to have this little talk about...

601
01:01:04,048 --> 01:01:09,386
What would you think
about our making Vicky part of our family?

602
01:01:09,553 --> 01:01:11,972
- Part of our family?
- Uh-huh.

603
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:16,143
- I think that's a wonderful idea.
- You do?

604
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:20,314
I certainly do.
I've always wanted to have a sister.

605
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,154
- No, honey. You're missing the point.
- How sweet of you to want to adopt her.

606
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:32,618
No, baby. I don't want to adopt her.
I want to marry her.

607
01:01:33,494 --> 01:01:39,333
Marry her? Oh, Dad!
You've just got to be kidding!

608
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:45,089
You can't marry her. She's just a child.

609
01:01:45,255 --> 01:01:51,136
- She's a woman! Stop calling her a child.
- It's all relative. Don't you see?

610
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:54,806
- Compared to her, you're an old man.
- I am not!

611
01:01:54,973 --> 01:01:59,686
You are too! It's the most revolting thing
I've ever heard!

612
01:01:59,853 --> 01:02:03,106
I won't discuss it unless you stop shouting.

613
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:05,609
- But Dad!
- Stop it.

614
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:13,283
All right. I'm not screaming.

615
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:19,289
I will talk about this
perfectly calmly and rationally.

616
01:02:19,456 --> 01:02:24,002
You can't get married!
You'll ruin everything! All our plans!

617
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:28,632
- What are you talking about?
- And my hair! Look at my hair.

618
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:33,220
I cut it for you. And my fingernails
I've bitten for you!

619
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:35,347
Of all the big-headed fathers!

620
01:02:35,513 --> 01:02:40,435
All those days and weeks,
nothing but working!

621
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:44,189
And names and... Oh!

622
01:02:44,356 --> 01:02:49,527
I tried to talk to her and she gets
hysterical. She's not making sense.

623
01:02:49,694 --> 01:02:54,407
Let me speak to her for a minute, darling.
Make yourself scarce.

624
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:09,464
- Hello, darling.
- He's making a ninny of himself.

625
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:14,636
It came as quite a shock to you.
Men put things so badly.

626
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:21,476
Can't you and I discuss this calmly together
like grown-up women?

627
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:26,147
I'm sure we can.
You're not afraid to talk to me, are you?

628
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:29,484
I'm not afraid to talk to anybody.

629
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,616
You're old enough to understand
that wonderful mystery

630
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:39,494
that can happen between a man and woman.

631
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,581
I know what wonderful mystery
Daddy sees in you...

632
01:03:43,748 --> 01:03:48,586
and I can't say I blame him either.
You're very nicely put together.

633
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:55,134
Your father underestimates you, I think.

634
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:57,928
I'm sure you won't, Vicky.

635
01:04:00,222 --> 01:04:02,308
Susan, dear...

636
01:04:02,475 --> 01:04:05,102
You've had him to yourself all this time

637
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:10,441
and I can understand that having
another woman around is an intrusion.

638
01:04:10,608 --> 01:04:15,196
But all my life, I've hoped and waited
for someone like him -

639
01:04:15,362 --> 01:04:19,700
someone gentle and mature,
rough-edged, but quick to laugh,

640
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:21,869
understanding and wise.

641
01:04:22,036 --> 01:04:25,206
All things I love and cherish in him.

642
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:29,585
- Well, that's very refreshing.
- Why, dear?

643
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:33,839
Most girls run after Daddy
because he's so wealthy.

644
01:04:37,343 --> 01:04:42,181
- You think I'd marry him for his money?!
- If the shoe fits, wear it.

645
01:04:44,725 --> 01:04:51,064
I've tried to be friendly, but I'm going to
marry your father, so get used to the idea.

646
01:04:51,231 --> 01:04:53,484
You wanna bet?

647
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:59,489
Honey, don't you play with the big girls.
You'll be in way over your head.

648
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:16,423
<i>Operator.</i>

649
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,301
Get me Western Union, please.

650
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:26,391
For Sharon? A child of her age
getting a telegram?

651
01:05:26,558 --> 01:05:29,519
Let her read it. It belongs to her.

652
01:05:29,686 --> 01:05:32,731
Who would be sending her a telegram?

653
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,376
Sharon?

654
01:05:57,922 --> 01:06:03,136
"Alexander Graham. Three a.m."

655
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:08,892
- California.
- Who could she know in California?

656
01:06:09,058 --> 01:06:14,731
Bertha Waterbury. This girl I met at camp.
Sensational girl.

657
01:06:14,898 --> 01:06:19,360
It's a rather cryptic message.
What does it mean?

658
01:06:21,404 --> 01:06:24,741
She's crazy about this boy, Alexander.

659
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:28,328
And he took her on a date until three a.m.

660
01:06:28,494 --> 01:06:32,415
- A child of that age!
- Now, Mother...

661
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:44,719
Hello?

662
01:06:44,886 --> 01:06:46,679
<i>- Susan Evers?
- Yes.</i>

663
01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:49,015
<i>- Go ahead.
- It's me again.</i>

664
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:53,394
I know. I had a hard time
explaining your telegram.

665
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:57,732
Grandmother
went into a lecture on raising children!

666
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:04,113
You've got to believe me.
I'm in horrible trouble.

667
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,783
- Don't dramatise it.
- I'm not. It's serious.

668
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,453
<i>- The worse thing.
- It's gone that far?</i>

669
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,580
Mother ought to be here.

670
01:07:12,747 --> 01:07:15,708
OK. Tomorrow morning I'll break the bomb.

671
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:18,836
How's Mother?
Kiss her for me, and Grandpa.

672
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:21,130
OK. Bye.

673
01:07:35,144 --> 01:07:38,480
Oh! Hi, Grandpa.

674
01:07:38,647 --> 01:07:40,858
Hi... Susan.

675
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:46,238
- Susan?
- Yes. Sit down.

676
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:52,661
I think you and I
ought to have a little chat.

677
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:02,379
We've got the Picasso exhibition
at four o'clock, Margaret.

678
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,424
- Are you coming, Charles?
- No, thank you.

679
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:09,094
Then Mrs Saunders' tea.
Caroline's daughter's coming.

680
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:14,057
- Really?
- Sharon, you've got dancing at 10.30.

681
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:18,437
Then straight on
to the musical appreciation course.

682
01:08:18,603 --> 01:08:22,232
- Staimes can take her in your car, Charles?
- Yes.

683
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,903
- At three o'clock...
- I won't be able to do those today.

684
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:32,075
- What did you say?
- Sharon, you interrupted your grandmother.

685
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:34,953
I have something important to tell you.

686
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:41,960
Mother... I think what you and Daddy did
to us children is lousy! I think it stinks!

687
01:08:42,127 --> 01:08:43,837
Sharon!

688
01:08:44,004 --> 01:08:50,218
I'm not Sharon, I'm Susan.
Sharon is out in California with Daddy.

689
01:08:50,385 --> 01:08:52,804
- Impossible.
- You can't be Susan.

690
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:58,310
But I am Susan! Sharon and I met at camp,
so we decided to switch places.

691
01:08:58,476 --> 01:09:00,770
She bit her nails and I cut her hair.

692
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:05,817
And she's out in California with Dad,
swimming and riding my horse,

693
01:09:05,984 --> 01:09:09,195
and I'm stuck with music lessons
that I hate!

694
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:11,531
Susan...

695
01:09:13,241 --> 01:09:15,326
I'm sorry, Mother.

696
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:20,957
But I wanted to see you,
and I miss not having a mother.

697
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:24,919
I love you very much,

698
01:09:25,086 --> 01:09:32,635
and I wondered if you could love me as me
and not as Sharon... please?

699
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,013
Oh, Susan.

700
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:45,314
Oh, my darling. Why didn't you let me know?
Why didn't you tell me?

701
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:51,487
I couldn't help it. I wanted to know what it
was like to have a mother and everything.

702
01:09:53,906 --> 01:09:56,409
My baby.

703
01:09:56,576 --> 01:10:00,580
- Susan, darling!
- Oh, Grandmother.

704
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:04,166
- She's exactly like Sharon.
- I know.

705
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,919
- Louise?
- What is it?

706
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:10,798
Louise.

707
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,593
- What is it?
- Most important.

708
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,767
What is it?

709
01:10:21,934 --> 01:10:25,521
- They ought to be alone for a minute.
- Is that all?

710
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,732
Margaret hasn't seen her since she was one.

711
01:10:28,899 --> 01:10:30,985
I'm her grandmother!

712
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:37,616
Louise, for once I'm putting my foot down.
Let them alone.

713
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:43,038
I've tried, Mother, honestly,
but I don't understand.

714
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:46,917
It doesn't mean your father and I
didn't love each other,

715
01:10:47,084 --> 01:10:52,297
but sometimes people
just don't get on together.

716
01:10:52,464 --> 01:10:55,092
So you have to switch us back again?

717
01:10:55,259 --> 01:11:00,305
Legally, you belong to your father
and Sharon belongs to me.

718
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:05,310
His and hers.
Makes me feel like a bathroom towel.

719
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,689
It's lousy, isn't it?

720
01:11:08,856 --> 01:11:11,775
Don't worry. We'll find a way.

721
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:15,988
Six months split.
That's how it's going to end up.

722
01:11:16,154 --> 01:11:19,366
A lot of kids in camp had that problem.

723
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:24,579
Six months with one parent, six months
with the other - like a yo-yo.

724
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:31,670
I don't like it any more than you do,
but I'm not going to lose you now.

725
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,926
- Bettina, would you put this in your case?
- Yes, Ma'am.

726
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:39,761
- May I come in?
- Of course.

727
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:44,099
- I have you on the noon plane.
- That's not much time.

728
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:47,018
- Best I can do on short notice.
- Thank you.

729
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:55,110
Traffic's pretty heavy these days.
Are you wearing that dress on the trip?

730
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:58,405
- What's wrong with it?
- It's very nice.

731
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:01,491
Give my best to Mitch when you see him.

732
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:05,870
- I wonder what kind of a wife he has.
- Who said he's married?

733
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:11,626
A vital, romantic fellow like Mitch,
it's a cinch he's found a nice young wife.

734
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:15,880
I hope she likes the great outdoors
and can scale fish.

735
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:20,468
- No sour grapes now.
- Bettina, could you find my blue skirt?

736
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:22,178
Yes, Ma'am.

737
01:12:22,345 --> 01:12:26,140
Margaret, I've got to hand it to you,

738
01:12:26,307 --> 01:12:32,814
it shows strength of character not to go
with the new fashion trends in clothes.

739
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,400
What are you getting at?

740
01:12:35,566 --> 01:12:40,113
I was just saying that...
Take your hairstyle...

741
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:42,949
- What's wrong with it?
- That's what I mean.

742
01:12:43,116 --> 01:12:47,161
Women are wearing their hair
a little fuller...

743
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:51,707
- Are you looking for a fight?
- With my favourite daughter? No.

744
01:12:51,874 --> 01:12:57,421
Don't get me wrong.
My goodness, you are what you are.

745
01:12:57,588 --> 01:13:02,510
- I wouldn't change you for the world.
- Who's going to change?

746
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:06,639
- Stay the way you are.
- I certainly intend to.

747
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:10,142
A nice, reliable, settled,
comfortable woman,

748
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:14,105
who accepts the coming of age
with grace and dignity.

749
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:18,567
That's the most horrible thing
anybody could say!

750
01:13:18,734 --> 01:13:25,241
You're flying off the handle and I only
came in to kiss you and wish you good luck.

751
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,577
Goodbye, daughter.

752
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:30,329
Goodbye.

753
01:13:30,496 --> 01:13:32,706
Give my regards to Mitch.

754
01:13:32,873 --> 01:13:37,044
Come to think of it,
that dress seems perfect for you.

755
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:53,560
I'm all packed. What time do we go?

756
01:13:53,727 --> 01:13:58,732
On the noon plane. Have you got
everything in we wanted for Sharon?

757
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:06,156
- How would you like to stop in New York?
- Yeah! Why?

758
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:09,785
We could do some shopping
before we head west.

759
01:14:12,788 --> 01:14:15,541
We got a nice calf there.

760
01:14:22,839 --> 01:14:24,841
What's eating you?

761
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:31,098
You ever have the feeling that something's
gonna happen? Like a storm brewing?

762
01:14:32,265 --> 01:14:34,351
No. Come on.

763
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:47,697
Verbena!

764
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:51,409
Verbena, we're here! Sharon!

765
01:14:52,494 --> 01:14:55,205
Verbena! We're here!

766
01:14:55,372 --> 01:14:58,083
Come on, Mother.

767
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,335
- Darling!
- Verbena.

768
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:07,217
Mrs Evers! You look wonderful.
Let me take your things.

769
01:15:07,384 --> 01:15:11,596
- I'll take them inside. Oh, darling!
- Verbena. How are you?

770
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:14,724
I'm fine. We've missed you.

771
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:20,105
- Thank you. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

772
01:15:20,271 --> 01:15:24,025
I can't wait to show you
how lovely everything is.

773
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,072
- It was wonderful.
- Fine.

774
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,534
Mother! I'm so glad you came!

775
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:37,080
You look wonderful! What did you do?

776
01:15:37,247 --> 01:15:39,457
- You like it?
- I love it.

777
01:15:39,624 --> 01:15:41,918
Oh, darling!

778
01:15:42,085 --> 01:15:47,298
Finally, both of you together at last.

779
01:15:47,465 --> 01:15:50,218
- What do you think of each other?
- Fine.

780
01:15:50,385 --> 01:15:52,136
We love each other.

781
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:55,098
- Hi, Sue.
- Hi.

782
01:15:56,182 --> 01:16:02,730
- And just look at you. That short hair.
- I cut it, Mother.

783
01:16:02,897 --> 01:16:06,984
- I like it!
- And I love yours, Mother.

784
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:10,488
- Where's your father?
- Out on a horse.

785
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:12,573
Are we in time?

786
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,534
- Time?
- Didn't you tell her?

787
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,372
Tell me what?

788
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:23,751
- Well...
- Dad's getting married.

789
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:28,172
Well...

790
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:34,887
- When is all this taking place?
- Saturday, supposedly.

791
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:43,813
She just infiltrated, Mother,
and before you knew it, Dad was hooked.

792
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:47,441
Mr Evers is slipping
into his second childhood.

793
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:50,444
He's old enough to know what he's doing.

794
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:55,407
Shall we get unpacked?
I'm dying to get into a hot shower.

795
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:04,625
- Want a beer?
- Yeah. Be in in a minute.

796
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:11,048
You know I don't say a word, but the things
that Vicky woman has been up to...

797
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:12,925
Really?

798
01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:17,638
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hi.

799
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:21,975
- Look who's talking to me.
- Why shouldn't I talk to you?

800
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:26,688
Come on!
I can get married any time I want to!

801
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:31,944
You've been walking around the house
like a mummy for two days.

802
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,863
You, me, two days - nothing!

803
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:40,702
- Remember?
- Oh, you were...

804
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:44,581
I guess I have been acting sulky.

805
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:49,086
Sulky?
That's the understatement of the year.

806
01:17:49,252 --> 01:17:54,049
Sulky? You've been plain impossible.
You've been monstrous!

807
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:57,344
Pouting is childish.
You're too old for that.

808
01:17:57,511 --> 01:18:01,973
Not speaking to someone
because you're mad at them is...

809
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:07,229
- Feminine.
- Yes. The worst part of being feminine.

810
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:13,360
- The doorbell's ringing.
- Yes.

811
01:18:13,526 --> 01:18:18,531
That's the minister and Miss Robinson
and you're to be polite to them.

812
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:21,993
Come here.

813
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:32,420
Hello.

814
01:18:32,587 --> 01:18:36,716
Mitchell, I want you to meet Dr Mosby.

815
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:39,552
Dr Mosby, Mitchell Evers, the groom.

816
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:45,308
How beautiful! Isn't this lovely?
So masculine.

817
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:48,061
Mitch, it needs a woman's touch.

818
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:52,106
There's that angelic creature again.

819
01:18:52,273 --> 01:18:56,277
- How are you today, Susan?
- Fine, thank you.

820
01:18:56,444 --> 01:18:59,947
This is Reverend Mosby.
He's doing the marriage.

821
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:02,867
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

822
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:06,412
I've gotta change. Will you excuse me?

823
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:11,083
How would you like to be hostess?

824
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,295
Be polite.

825
01:19:30,144 --> 01:19:32,355
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

826
01:19:32,521 --> 01:19:35,983
- There are some people downstairs.
- I know.

827
01:20:29,536 --> 01:20:33,832
Your grandfather sends his love.
Your grandmother does too.

828
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:36,668
- She's downstairs.
- Who, Vicky?

829
01:20:36,835 --> 01:20:39,963
- I've seen her.
- Well, I haven't.

830
01:20:48,347 --> 01:20:51,558
- Susie...
- Did you want something?

831
01:20:53,769 --> 01:20:56,354
No, honey. Never mind.

832
01:21:02,694 --> 01:21:05,280
Mother, this is my wedding. You've had four.

833
01:21:05,447 --> 01:21:08,617
- Why didn't you mix some drinks?
- We waited for you.

834
01:21:08,783 --> 01:21:11,202
- Edna?
- Anything you have.

835
01:21:11,369 --> 01:21:15,540
- The usual, darling.
- Reverend, I don't suppose you indulge?

836
01:21:15,707 --> 01:21:20,545
Perhaps a little something
by way of a nuptial toast.

837
01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:26,342
- Good.
- Bourbon, double, on the rocks.

838
01:21:28,178 --> 01:21:29,721
Yes, sir.

839
01:21:29,888 --> 01:21:36,144
Vicky, think how an outdoor ceremony
will look in the newspapers.

840
01:21:36,311 --> 01:21:39,022
I'm inclined to agree, Mrs Robinson.

841
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:44,444
The Marco-Dennisons had their wedding
under a striped tent.

842
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:46,696
Last month it was.

843
01:21:46,863 --> 01:21:49,574
The atmosphere was ideally apropos -

844
01:21:49,741 --> 01:21:54,704
there in God's natural setting
under the trees. Thank you.

845
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:10,720
Thank you.

846
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:23,190
- Mitch!
- Upsadaisy, darling.

847
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:33,200
I think your idea about
having the wedding outside is wonderful.

848
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:42,334
<i>Vicky can come down the walk...</i>

849
01:22:58,434 --> 01:23:01,604
It's all right, I've got him.

850
01:23:04,607 --> 01:23:06,692
Give me your hand.

851
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:09,278
Mitch, darling!

852
01:23:09,445 --> 01:23:14,033
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right!

853
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:17,870
I'll be back in just a minute.

854
01:23:43,854 --> 01:23:46,690
- Mitch.
- Maggie.

855
01:23:47,733 --> 01:23:51,361
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?

856
01:23:51,528 --> 01:23:54,990
I'm fine. Gee, you look...

857
01:23:55,157 --> 01:23:59,619
- I've got people out there!
- Don't start yelling. Let me explain.

858
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:05,876
- If you just keep quiet, I'll tell you!
- What are you doing here?

859
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:08,837
If you stop screaming, she'll explain!

860
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:15,093
Surprise.

861
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:19,222
That's what I was trying to tell you.

862
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:23,601
Both of them?

863
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:41,453
The two of them together.
Maggie, how did it happen?

864
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:45,290
We met at camp
and the whole thing came out.

865
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,503
- They switched places on us.
- They what?

866
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:53,715
Sue came to Boston to be with me.

867
01:24:55,717 --> 01:25:00,346
You mean this is Sharon?
I had Sharon all this time?

868
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:02,640
You're Sharon?

869
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:07,812
I wanted to know what you were like
and Susan wanted to meet Mother.

870
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:11,232
You are Sharon.

871
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:18,531
- You were only a tiny baby when I...
- You're not mad, are you?

872
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:23,077
No, sweetheart.
I just can't believe it's you.

873
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:27,498
- The trouble I had burping you.
- Daddy, really!

874
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:33,337
No. I mean it. I spent nights walking up
and down with you. Two o'clock feeds...

875
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:37,842
- And where was I?
- Well, it was half and half.

876
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:41,178
You used up more diapers than ten kids.

877
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:44,432
- Daddy, diapers!
- Yes, diapers.

878
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:49,270
- Look at you now. Look at her.
- I'm quite grown up.

879
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,526
- And quite without a father.
- Oh, honey...

880
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:59,155
- And I'm quite without a mother.
- Shh!

881
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:05,035
Girls, we'll discuss this later on.
I want to talk to your father now.

882
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:09,290
Come on, Sharon. They want to be alone.

883
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:17,172
Daddy...
Daddy, please don't marry that woman.

884
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:21,802
All right, Sharon. Run along now.

885
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:31,520
Will you look at that? I can't believe it.

886
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:37,568
The last time I saw them together, they were
that big and you were pushing them.

887
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:42,781
What a time for you to show up!
I'm going to get married!

888
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:46,034
I didn't know.
Sharon told me when I got here.

889
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:51,248
- That girl is my fiancée.
- I know. I saw her.

890
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:56,128
All right. Let's have it.

891
01:26:56,294 --> 01:27:01,133
- I think she's adorable!
- Sure you do.

892
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:07,013
- Except for what?
- I think she's a perfect dream.

893
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,184
Of course,
her eyes are a little close together.

894
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:18,567
Maggie, those tricks don't work any more.
Can you go and put on something decent?

895
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,069
I'm perfectly decent.

896
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,446
Running around in my bathrobe!

897
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:27,033
She'll come in
and it looks like we just...

898
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,746
- Like we what?
- Just go and put on some clothes!

899
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,375
Don't use that tone.
We're not married anymore!

900
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:39,295
This is my house
and you're not running around...

901
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:42,966
Don't start ordering me around!

902
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:47,220
Maggie, go on upstairs
and put on some clothes or...

903
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:51,558
Don't use force on me.
I lammed you once and I can do it...

904
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:56,604
- Stand back.
- Maggie, don't start that.

905
01:27:56,771 --> 01:28:01,359
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me. I'm warning you.

906
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:09,117
- Did you have to do that?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

907
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:11,703
Why do you have to get so physical?

908
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:17,083
I can't talk to you.
You're always trying to belt me.

909
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:21,003
- That's vicious.
- It can't be that bad.

910
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,006
- It is that bad!
- Let me see it.

911
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:28,052
- Leave it alone. You've done enough.
- Let me see.

912
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:30,680
Don't... Ow!

913
01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:36,018
Mitch, stop acting like a big baby.
I didn't get a look at it.

914
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:39,021
- I want a doctor.
- Don't be ridiculous.

915
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:43,693
Mr Evers? The ladies were wondering...
Oh, excuse me.

916
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:47,863
Reverend?

917
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:52,535
Wait a minute, sir.
There's nothing wrong here.

918
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:59,750
There's nothing wrong at all.
It's pretty easy to explain. You see...

919
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:04,964
- This is my wife.
- Hello.

920
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:08,259
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

921
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:11,845
But what about?

922
01:29:12,012 --> 01:29:14,848
Oh, no. Ex-wife.

923
01:29:15,015 --> 01:29:18,352
She came out here - very unexpectedly -

924
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:21,271
to discuss some mix-up about the children,

925
01:29:21,438 --> 01:29:26,610
and I merely suggested she put on
something decent because you...

926
01:29:26,777 --> 01:29:29,905
Why am I telling you?
It's none of your business.

927
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:32,574
He didn't ask for an explanation.

928
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:36,995
You're babbling on as if there were...
something to hide.

929
01:29:37,162 --> 01:29:41,333
Dr Mosby isn't at all shocked
at seeing me like this.

930
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:45,796
Of course he's shocked.
Running around in that get-up...

931
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:50,050
I'm not shocked. I see nothing
wrong with your wife's attire.

932
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:53,178
- Ex-wife.
- She's very beautiful.

933
01:29:53,345 --> 01:29:58,767
You see, I knew I liked you.

934
01:29:58,934 --> 01:30:02,062
You'll find I'm not
without a sense of humour.

935
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:05,399
I find this situation fraught with humour.

936
01:30:05,565 --> 01:30:08,610
Quite out of the everyday, as we say.

937
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:13,156
Could you excuse us for just a moment?

938
01:30:13,323 --> 01:30:17,702
Maggie, will you try to be
a little understanding, please?

939
01:30:17,869 --> 01:30:23,500
I've got to explain why you're here.
That's not going to be easy.

940
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,835
I suppose they'll want to meet me.

941
01:30:26,002 --> 01:30:30,257
That's only natural.
I want to keep this above board.

942
01:30:30,423 --> 01:30:34,594
Very well. I'll just slip
into something more comfortable.

943
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:38,056
Very funny.

944
01:30:39,849 --> 01:30:43,353
- Dr Mosby, don't run away.
- I'll be here.

945
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,148
- I'll be back in a minute.
- I'll look forward to it.

946
01:30:47,315 --> 01:30:52,529
A delightful woman, Mr Evers.
How ever did you let her slip away?

947
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:55,114
She's simply delightful.

948
01:30:59,327 --> 01:31:03,206
- Why couldn't she go to a hotel?
- I didn't invite her.

949
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:06,084
- I knew it would go wrong.
- Nothing's wrong.

950
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:08,586
- Nothing's wrong?
- She's unpacked.

951
01:31:08,753 --> 01:31:11,464
- She's staying the night?
- I won't have it!

952
01:31:11,631 --> 01:31:14,258
You're reading implications into...

953
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:27,105
- Would you like to enjoy the garden?
- No. I'm enjoying this immensely.

954
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:29,899
- You are?
- Interesting situation.

955
01:31:30,066 --> 01:31:32,151
Quite out of the everyday.

956
01:31:33,319 --> 01:31:35,446
Yes. It sure is.

957
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:39,742
Edna, I guarantee
by tomorrow morning, she'll be...

958
01:31:39,909 --> 01:31:42,954
Mitch, I will not have her
spending the night.

959
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,124
Vicky, she's not that kind of a woman.

960
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:49,710
She's a woman, that's enough.

961
01:31:49,877 --> 01:31:52,463
Edna, she's not what you think at all.

962
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:55,049
First, she's from Boston.

963
01:31:55,216 --> 01:32:01,389
She's older, more mature. She's had
two children. She's the motherly type.

964
01:32:01,555 --> 01:32:04,683
Vicky, I swear you've got nothing to...

965
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:08,729
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Margaret McKendrick.

966
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:12,608
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello, again.

967
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:15,819
And this must be Vicky.

968
01:32:15,986 --> 01:32:19,406
I'd know you anywhere
from Mitch's description.

969
01:32:21,575 --> 01:32:24,286
- I'm Mrs Robinson.
- Whoops!

970
01:32:25,371 --> 01:32:29,166
- Sorry, Mitch.
- It could happen to anybody.

971
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:31,168
Vicky?

972
01:32:32,378 --> 01:32:35,047
Oh, you are divine.

973
01:32:35,214 --> 01:32:37,841
She's simply breathtaking.

974
01:32:38,008 --> 01:32:43,180
- I was just thinking the same about you.
- At my age?

975
01:32:43,347 --> 01:32:46,475
You are a sweet child.

976
01:32:46,642 --> 01:32:50,896
- Mitch described you somewhat differently.
- He certainly did.

977
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:55,734
Excuse me.

978
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:59,238
You know
what husbands think about ex-wives -

979
01:32:59,404 --> 01:33:03,241
an old comfortable worn-out shoe
cast in the closet.

980
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:10,374
Well, off with the old and on with the new,
eh? I must say, you are young.

981
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:15,379
- Isn't that lucky for Mitch?
- Yes.

982
01:33:15,545 --> 01:33:20,217
I was thrilled to hear you were
going to take the plunge with old Mitch.

983
01:33:20,383 --> 01:33:25,514
We must celebrate the occasion.
Mitch, open some champagne.

984
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:30,185
Tell me all about yourself.
We must get to be very good friends.

985
01:33:30,352 --> 01:33:34,898
No! I don't want you to be friends.
That's not the idea.

986
01:33:35,065 --> 01:33:39,736
- We have to be running anyway.
- Perhaps you'd better...

987
01:33:39,903 --> 01:33:42,906
All good things have to end.

988
01:33:43,073 --> 01:33:47,535
What a pity. Just as we were
getting to know each other.

989
01:33:47,702 --> 01:33:50,830
So nice to have met you.

990
01:33:50,997 --> 01:33:55,794
I know you won't be at the wedding,
but it'll be in the society columns.

991
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,880
- I never read them.
- What a shame.

992
01:34:00,715 --> 01:34:06,846
I never go to funerals or weddings.
I prefer elopements. They're more romantic.

993
01:34:07,013 --> 01:34:10,850
What a shame
you can't stay for dinner with us.

994
01:34:11,017 --> 01:34:16,856
Yes. Vicky and I have a million things
to do - fittings and odds and ends to buy.

995
01:34:17,023 --> 01:34:20,234
Just charge it all to Mitch. He's loaded.

996
01:34:20,401 --> 01:34:24,405
- Oh? I didn't know.
- Didn't you?

997
01:34:24,572 --> 01:34:27,742
Goodbye, it was so nice to have met you.

998
01:34:27,909 --> 01:34:31,954
Goodbye, Vicky.
You're just as cute as you can be.

999
01:34:33,748 --> 01:34:35,541
Bye.

1000
01:34:39,462 --> 01:34:45,176
Delightful, charming woman. Amazing
how he let her slip away from him.

1001
01:34:51,807 --> 01:34:54,477
You want me to lose my job?
Your pa will fire me.

1002
01:34:54,602 --> 01:34:59,940
- Please, Hecky.
- We're leaving tomorrow. Please?

1003
01:35:00,107 --> 01:35:03,736
No. I won't be
part of a conspiracy like this.

1004
01:35:03,903 --> 01:35:08,574
<i>He'll do it, or he'll cook
his own meals for the next month.</i>

1005
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:14,330
A gypsy?

1006
01:35:34,266 --> 01:35:36,685
What happened to dinner?

1007
01:35:36,852 --> 01:35:41,440
- Dinner's being served on the patio.
- Whose idea's that?

1008
01:35:41,607 --> 01:35:47,070
- It's none of my never mind. I never...
- I know. You never say a word.

1009
01:35:47,237 --> 01:35:51,700
I mind my own business.
I've been doing that for years.

1010
01:35:51,867 --> 01:35:53,952
Verbena! What's all this?

1011
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:57,122
Go and sit down, Daddy. Don't ruin it.

1012
01:35:57,289 --> 01:36:00,918
- Ruin what?
- Go and sit down. Dinner's ready.

1013
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:29,112
Well! What's all this?

1014
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:35,243
Don't ask me. I just got here. It's just
my house. Nobody ever tells me anything.

1015
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:39,998
And dinner on the patio.
Was this your idea, Mitch?

1016
01:36:40,165 --> 01:36:43,877
No, it was not. What are you looking at?

1017
01:36:44,044 --> 01:36:49,257
Mitch, that eye looks dreadful.
You must put something on it.

1018
01:36:49,424 --> 01:36:53,595
- Don't concern yourself.
- Did you step on a rake?

1019
01:36:53,762 --> 01:37:00,769
No. A very well-bred, ladylike,
Bostonian matron pinned it on me.

1020
01:37:00,935 --> 01:37:04,647
Anybody I know? Oh, Verbena!

1021
01:37:04,814 --> 01:37:09,903
- It's special for tonight.
- It smells delicious.

1022
01:37:10,069 --> 01:37:12,989
- What do you call that?
- Veal Parmigian.

1023
01:37:13,156 --> 01:37:17,493
Veal? I hate that kind of stuff.
She knows that.

1024
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:29,339
- What do you think you're doing?
- I may go out and kill myself.

1025
01:37:29,505 --> 01:37:32,508
Hecky, it's time!

1026
01:37:32,675 --> 01:37:35,720
Excuse me, Mitch. All right!

1027
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:51,819
- Mitch, please don't laugh.
- What's the matter?

1028
01:37:51,986 --> 01:37:55,072
- Don't you see?
- Ladies and gentlemen...

1029
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:58,826
the management
have some entertainment for you.

1030
01:37:58,993 --> 01:38:02,997
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen,

1031
01:38:03,164 --> 01:38:06,500
I'd like to introduce, direct from Boston,

1032
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:12,506
playing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
on the piano, Miss Sharon McKendrick.

1033
01:38:49,918 --> 01:38:51,962
What's all this noise?

1034
01:38:52,129 --> 01:38:56,300
Will you get off the stage?
I'm in the middle of a concert.

1035
01:38:56,467 --> 01:39:01,471
A concert? You're going to put
the paying customers to sleep.

1036
01:39:01,638 --> 01:39:03,807
You gotta get the new sound.

1037
01:39:09,187 --> 01:39:14,735
Let's compromise. You give a little,
I'll give a little. Let's get together.

1038
01:39:16,278 --> 01:39:18,155
That's it!

1039
01:39:21,491 --> 01:39:26,955
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why don't you and I combine?</i>

1040
01:39:27,122 --> 01:39:32,711
<i>Let's get together, what do you say?
We can have a swinging time</i>

1041
01:39:32,878 --> 01:39:35,589
<i>We'd be a crazy team</i>

1042
01:39:35,755 --> 01:39:38,967
<i>Why don't we make the scene?</i>

1043
01:39:39,134 --> 01:39:40,844
<i>Together</i>

1044
01:39:41,011 --> 01:39:44,931
<i>Oh oh oh oh
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1045
01:39:45,098 --> 01:39:48,184
<i>Think of all that we could share</i>

1046
01:39:48,351 --> 01:39:53,565
<i>Let's get together every day
Every way and everywhere</i>

1047
01:39:53,732 --> 01:39:56,693
<i>And though we haven't got a lot</i>

1048
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,904
<i>We could be sharing all we've got</i>

1049
01:40:00,071 --> 01:40:01,948
<i>Together</i>

1050
01:40:03,408 --> 01:40:05,869
<i>Oh! I really think you're swell</i>

1051
01:40:06,035 --> 01:40:08,997
<i>Uh-huh! You really ring the bell</i>

1052
01:40:09,164 --> 01:40:11,875
<i>Oo-ee! And if you stick with me</i>

1053
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:15,170
<i>Nothing could be greater
Say hey, alligator!</i>

1054
01:40:15,336 --> 01:40:18,173
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1055
01:40:18,339 --> 01:40:21,426
<i>Two is twice as nice as one</i>

1056
01:40:21,593 --> 01:40:26,931
<i>Let's get together right away
We'll be having twice the fun</i>

1057
01:40:27,098 --> 01:40:29,892
<i>And you can always count on me</i>

1058
01:40:30,059 --> 01:40:32,979
<i>A gruesome twosome we will be</i>

1059
01:40:33,146 --> 01:40:37,191
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

1060
01:40:37,358 --> 01:40:39,694
That was wonderful, girls!

1061
01:40:41,863 --> 01:40:44,407
- Great!
- Marvellous!

1062
01:40:44,574 --> 01:40:48,411
- Come and have dinner.
- We got spaghetti and glop.

1063
01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:52,582
It's all right.
We've already had dinner in the kitchen.

1064
01:40:52,748 --> 01:40:58,880
Yes. You enjoy yourselves. We're going
to bed. Goodnight, Mom. 'Night, Dad.

1065
01:40:59,046 --> 01:41:02,383
Goodnight, Mom. Have fun.

1066
01:41:03,259 --> 01:41:06,178
- Goodnight, girls.
- Goodnight, kids.

1067
01:41:06,345 --> 01:41:10,850
How about those two little monkeys
putting that together?

1068
01:41:11,017 --> 01:41:14,353
- They've done more than that.
- What do you mean?

1069
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:21,110
Don't you understand? The drippy candles,
the violin music, the Veal Parmigiana.

1070
01:41:21,277 --> 01:41:24,780
Martinelli's. Don't you remember?

1071
01:41:24,947 --> 01:41:29,410
- Oh...
- Our first date. They recreated it.

1072
01:41:29,577 --> 01:41:33,831
Crazy, sweet kids.

1073
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,168
What?

1074
01:41:39,545 --> 01:41:41,213
Nothing.

1075
01:41:45,634 --> 01:41:48,721
What are we going to do about them?

1076
01:41:48,887 --> 01:41:52,433
We certainly can't keep them apart.

1077
01:41:52,599 --> 01:41:55,561
No, we sure can't do that.

1078
01:41:56,770 --> 01:42:02,776
I guess the only logical thing we can do
is try to share them.

1079
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:08,532
You could take them for six months,
then I'd have them.

1080
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:11,660
That way they'd be together.

1081
01:42:12,703 --> 01:42:17,499
- I think that's best. Don't you?
- Yes, I guess it is.

1082
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:22,546
"Six months split".
That's what Susan calls it.

1083
01:42:23,755 --> 01:42:26,717
That's all we can do.

1084
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:33,390
You know, Mitch,
all of a sudden, I'm very depressed.

1085
01:42:33,557 --> 01:42:38,145
It would have been worse if we'd
stayed together - all that fighting.

1086
01:42:38,311 --> 01:42:42,274
- Your Irish temper.
- You were just as difficult.

1087
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:46,570
Sure. I admit it.
It was a mistake in the beginning.

1088
01:42:48,071 --> 01:42:51,199
- Was it?
- It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

1089
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:56,913
You haven't changed much.
The years have been good to you, Mitch.

1090
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:04,629
Well? Aren't you going to return
the compliment?

1091
01:43:04,796 --> 01:43:09,676
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
Maggie, you look pretty good.

1092
01:43:09,843 --> 01:43:14,097
Don't stumble over the words.
You don't have to say them!

1093
01:43:14,264 --> 01:43:18,643
I mean it.
What did you do to yourself anyway?

1094
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:21,062
Do to myself?!

1095
01:43:22,105 --> 01:43:27,902
16 plastic surgeons and a reconstruction job
on my face so I could be presentable!

1096
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:34,117
Do you think I'm some troll who crawled out
of the woods to come calling on you?

1097
01:43:34,284 --> 01:43:39,872
I'm not as young as that simpering,
baby-faced, platinum doll who's hooked you.

1098
01:43:40,039 --> 01:43:45,044
- Don't get started on Vicky.
- Don't say anything about precious Vicky!

1099
01:43:45,211 --> 01:43:49,382
That plotz-faced child bride
and her electric hips!

1100
01:43:58,933 --> 01:44:02,812
- I'm sorry, Mitch.
- It always happens, doesn't it?

1101
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:04,605
Yeah.

1102
01:44:04,772 --> 01:44:11,362
It won't happen any more.
I'm leaving in the morning with Sharon.

1103
01:44:13,322 --> 01:44:19,370
I really do mean this, Mitch. I wish you
the best of everything with Vicky.

1104
01:44:28,003 --> 01:44:33,259
Holy smokes!
What a lousy mess they made of that.

1105
01:44:33,425 --> 01:44:37,972
All our plans.
Mother and I will be leaving tomorrow.

1106
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:43,769
Don't give up.
We've got all night to think of something.

1107
01:44:43,936 --> 01:44:46,021
Like what?

1108
01:44:47,856 --> 01:44:49,942
I don't know.

1109
01:44:52,569 --> 01:44:54,989
But something.

1110
01:44:58,325 --> 01:45:02,538
- Sharon! Taxi's waiting.
- I'm coming!

1111
01:45:02,704 --> 01:45:08,252
- Susan, aren't you coming to say goodbye?
- Be right there, Mother!

1112
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:25,227
Sharon! Susan!

1113
01:45:28,063 --> 01:45:30,774
I'll send Susan back for Christmas.

1114
01:45:32,567 --> 01:45:36,446
I'll see that Sharon comes here for Easter.

1115
01:45:36,613 --> 01:45:39,199
I suppose that's the best way.

1116
01:45:42,285 --> 01:45:44,704
I suppose so.

1117
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:55,966
What are you doing in those clothes?

1118
01:45:56,132 --> 01:45:58,343
Sharon, what is this?

1119
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:02,138
We've thought it over
and we've come to a decision.

1120
01:46:02,305 --> 01:46:06,059
- We decided we were getting gypped.
- Yeah.

1121
01:46:06,226 --> 01:46:08,144
What do you mean?

1122
01:46:08,311 --> 01:46:13,775
We decided that we wanted
to spend our camp-out together.

1123
01:46:13,942 --> 01:46:17,654
- So whichever of us is Sharon...
- And we won't tell.

1124
01:46:17,821 --> 01:46:21,783
Whichever of us is Sharon
isn't going to Boston.

1125
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:24,536
Don't get smart with me, girls.

1126
01:46:25,495 --> 01:46:28,665
Sharon, go upstairs and put your suit on.

1127
01:46:28,832 --> 01:46:32,794
- Are you sure she's Sharon?
- Of course she is.

1128
01:46:34,295 --> 01:46:36,256
Aren't you?

1129
01:46:37,257 --> 01:46:40,051
- Tough to tell, ain't it?
- Ain't it?

1130
01:46:40,218 --> 01:46:44,055
Isn't it! Stop this.
We're going to miss the plane.

1131
01:46:44,222 --> 01:46:46,307
That's the idea.

1132
01:46:47,725 --> 01:46:50,436
- Mitch, do something!
- Susan...

1133
01:46:50,603 --> 01:46:52,563
- Yes, Daddy?
- Yes, Daddy?

1134
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:55,316
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.

1135
01:46:55,483 --> 01:46:59,654
- That's not funny.
- This one is Susan - the smart alec.

1136
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:03,199
- Are you sure?
- I know my own daughter, don't I?

1137
01:47:03,366 --> 01:47:06,285
You're not really sure, are you, Daddy?

1138
01:47:10,665 --> 01:47:14,502
- I'm not.
- I think they're ready to listen.

1139
01:47:14,669 --> 01:47:21,092
Here's the deal. We leave
for the camp-out immediately - all of us.

1140
01:47:21,258 --> 01:47:27,306
When you bring us back on Friday,
we'll tell you who's Sharon and who's Susan.

1141
01:47:27,473 --> 01:47:30,726
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

1142
01:47:36,482 --> 01:47:40,736
What am I supposed to do for three days?
Stay home and knit?

1143
01:47:40,903 --> 01:47:44,031
It's not my fault. I can't tell them apart.

1144
01:47:44,198 --> 01:47:50,037
- Give them a spanking and make them tell!
- You don't spank 13-year-olds.

1145
01:47:50,204 --> 01:47:52,915
- Is she coming?
- That's part of the deal.

1146
01:47:53,082 --> 01:47:56,210
- I won't have it.
- Good morning, Vicky.

1147
01:47:56,377 --> 01:48:00,339
- I will not have you in the woods with her.
- You're right.

1148
01:48:00,506 --> 01:48:06,303
- Maggie, keep out of this.
- You can't leave her for three whole days.

1149
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:10,766
- What would people say?
- Right. What do you suggest?

1150
01:48:10,933 --> 01:48:15,395
- I think you ought to come with us.
- Maybe I will.

1151
01:48:15,562 --> 01:48:19,358
It's the thing to do.
We'll have to get you another outfit.

1152
01:48:19,525 --> 01:48:25,239
I know where Mitch keeps his shirts
and we can find you some boots...

1153
01:48:29,201 --> 01:48:33,705
- Are they all coming with us?
- Yup.

1154
01:48:36,124 --> 01:48:40,087
- Hecky, here's some more stuff.
- Hi, Dad.

1155
01:48:40,253 --> 01:48:41,797
Here.

1156
01:48:44,174 --> 01:48:47,552
Why don't we get going?

1157
01:48:47,719 --> 01:48:50,639
Just fasten the belt a bit tighter.

1158
01:48:50,806 --> 01:48:54,976
- Where does she think she's going?
- She's coming along.

1159
01:48:55,143 --> 01:48:57,979
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

1160
01:48:58,146 --> 01:49:04,027
- Here we are, Mitch. All ready.
- But she can't come along!

1161
01:49:04,194 --> 01:49:06,071
Girls, don't be rude.

1162
01:49:06,237 --> 01:49:11,451
Your father couldn't possibly
leave Vicky alone for three whole days.

1163
01:49:11,618 --> 01:49:16,915
- Let's get this show on the road.
- Vicky, you sit beside Mitch.

1164
01:49:17,082 --> 01:49:19,501
- If you don't mind.
- My pleasure.

1165
01:49:19,667 --> 01:49:25,006
- You and Vicky ought to be up there alone.
- What are you saying?

1166
01:49:26,591 --> 01:49:30,512
- Maggie, in or out?
- If you're not going, I...

1167
01:49:30,678 --> 01:49:36,851
Don't worry your pretty little head
about me. I'll just lie around the lake.

1168
01:49:38,478 --> 01:49:41,022
You can get to know the girls.

1169
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:46,444
You're going to have them for six months
a year. Bye. Watch out for snakes.

1170
01:49:46,611 --> 01:49:50,490
- Thanks a lot!
- Bye, girls. Have a good time.

1171
01:50:09,175 --> 01:50:13,012
- You all right?
- I'm just dandy. Some fun.

1172
01:50:13,179 --> 01:50:18,017
- What's the matter?
- Vicky's not used to this. Let's rest.

1173
01:50:20,561 --> 01:50:23,189
The lake's only another hour.

1174
01:50:23,356 --> 01:50:26,609
Look. I'll put it on, yes?

1175
01:50:29,236 --> 01:50:32,365
- Gee, isn't it hot?
- What of it?

1176
01:50:33,407 --> 01:50:36,327
I thought you'd like some of my water.

1177
01:50:39,747 --> 01:50:42,166
Thanks a lot.

1178
01:50:42,333 --> 01:50:46,378
Oh! There's a thing on it!

1179
01:50:46,545 --> 01:50:50,758
- What is it?
- It's only a little old tree lizard.

1180
01:50:50,925 --> 01:50:53,344
It wouldn't hurt anybody. Look.

1181
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:57,139
- Get that thing away from me!
- Cut that out!

1182
01:50:57,306 --> 01:51:01,894
Get that away from me.
I hate them. They're just miserable.

1183
01:51:04,063 --> 01:51:09,360
- You two stay here and help Vicky, OK?
- Sure. We'll help her.

1184
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:15,908
Sure you'll help me - right over a cliff.

1185
01:51:17,451 --> 01:51:19,536
What did we do?

1186
01:51:20,871 --> 01:51:25,334
Never mind those angelic faces.
I know vixens when I see 'em.

1187
01:51:25,501 --> 01:51:27,836
Just remember this.

1188
01:51:28,003 --> 01:51:32,883
You start anything
and I'll make your lives miserable later on.

1189
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:35,135
You get me, pets?

1190
01:51:50,525 --> 01:51:53,361
See that? Cougar tracks.

1191
01:51:53,528 --> 01:51:57,491
- It's a form of mountain lion.
- No kidding? Lions?

1192
01:51:57,657 --> 01:52:01,870
Sure. There are hundreds up here.
They really mess you up.

1193
01:52:02,037 --> 01:52:05,624
They'll grab at your eyes, eat you.

1194
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:09,461
There's a trick
an old Indian guide showed me.

1195
01:52:10,378 --> 01:52:14,841
You hit two sticks together
and the noise frightens them.

1196
01:52:15,008 --> 01:52:19,137
- Like that?
- Yeah. That'll keep them away.

1197
01:52:19,304 --> 01:52:21,181
Come on.

1198
01:52:36,112 --> 01:52:37,655
Quick.

1199
01:52:46,372 --> 01:52:50,168
- Enjoying yourself?
- Perfectly wonderful.

1200
01:52:51,336 --> 01:52:53,504
My feet are killing me.

1201
01:52:53,671 --> 01:52:57,008
Soak them in the lake.
That'll cool them off.

1202
01:52:57,175 --> 01:53:00,678
You think? I'll try anything.

1203
01:53:15,401 --> 01:53:18,696
- Come in. It's not deep.
- Are you sure?

1204
01:53:18,863 --> 01:53:21,532
Look, I'm standing.

1205
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,710
Mitch!

1206
01:53:42,053 --> 01:53:45,139
Hecky, you did yourself proud.

1207
01:53:45,306 --> 01:53:49,852
Thanks. You sure you won't
change your mind, Miss?

1208
01:53:50,019 --> 01:53:55,983
I detest trout! How many times do
I have to tell you? I'll eat in the morning.

1209
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:59,278
- What are we having for breakfast?
- Trout.

1210
01:54:01,238 --> 01:54:06,118
We always eat off the trail up here.
That's part of the fun of it.

1211
01:54:06,285 --> 01:54:10,748
Part of the fun? What else do you do?
Throw rocks in the lake?

1212
01:54:10,914 --> 01:54:13,959
You insisted on coming. Make the best of it.

1213
01:54:14,126 --> 01:54:17,129
I was tricked into coming. She tricked me.

1214
01:54:19,089 --> 01:54:21,175
She sure did.

1215
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,637
Hecky can always take you down.

1216
01:54:25,804 --> 01:54:29,808
Sure. I'd be happy
to walk you down to the truck.

1217
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:35,355
I'll stick it out, thanks.

1218
01:54:37,065 --> 01:54:41,820
They think I'm running a blood bank!
I think they like this stuff.

1219
01:54:41,987 --> 01:54:45,115
- What have you got?
- Mosquito repellent.

1220
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:48,827
It doesn't smell like anything.

1221
01:54:49,745 --> 01:54:54,332
- That's nothing but sugar and water.
- What?

1222
01:54:54,499 --> 01:54:58,837
That'll bring every mosquito around.
Where did you get it?

1223
01:55:00,255 --> 01:55:05,802
An old Indian scout gave it to me.
Said it would keep mosquitoes away.

1224
01:55:09,264 --> 01:55:12,976
Hecky, I think I'll have some more trout.

1225
01:55:13,143 --> 01:55:15,061
Yeah.

1226
01:55:15,228 --> 01:55:17,314
I'm turning in.

1227
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,691
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1228
01:55:19,858 --> 01:55:21,985
- Goodnight, Vicky.
- Goodnight, Vicky.

1229
01:55:36,708 --> 01:55:38,418
Vicky?

1230
01:55:43,006 --> 01:55:45,758
Honey, what are you doing?

1231
01:55:45,925 --> 01:55:50,096
- I'm keeping the mountain lions away.
- Mountain lions?

1232
01:55:50,263 --> 01:55:52,849
Yeah. The noise...

1233
01:55:54,183 --> 01:55:57,979
- The noise doesn't frighten mountain lions.
- No.

1234
01:55:59,272 --> 01:56:01,357
Goodnight!

1235
01:56:10,408 --> 01:56:13,828
- Why did you do that?
- I swear that...

1236
01:56:13,995 --> 01:56:19,584
Never mind.
It's a terrible thing to do. Isn't it?

1237
01:56:21,169 --> 01:56:23,254
Just terrible.

1238
01:56:24,547 --> 01:56:27,842
I don't want any more of that. Understand?

1239
01:56:28,009 --> 01:56:30,344
- Yes, Daddy.
- Both of you.

1240
01:56:30,511 --> 01:56:33,431
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

1241
01:57:44,293 --> 01:57:48,797
Get them out of here! Get them out!

1242
01:57:51,008 --> 01:57:56,763
Get them away from me!
Get those wild animals out!

1243
01:57:56,930 --> 01:58:00,392
Get them away from me!

1244
01:58:00,559 --> 01:58:04,438
I hate this filthy, stinking, dirty place!

1245
01:58:04,604 --> 01:58:10,193
What are you yelling about, Miss?
Those bear cubs wouldn't hurt a fly.

1246
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:13,905
You shut up and get me my boots!

1247
01:58:14,698 --> 01:58:16,116
Yes, Ma'am.

1248
01:58:16,283 --> 01:58:20,954
I hate this place!
This is not my idea of fun!

1249
01:58:21,121 --> 01:58:25,333
I hate the sticks! I hate the lake!
I hate the filthy bugs!

1250
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:29,963
- I can't stand this place!
- What the heck are you doing?

1251
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:34,300
- What's happening?
- You overgrown jerk! It's not worth it!

1252
01:58:35,677 --> 01:58:38,555
Do you want your clothes, Vicky?

1253
01:58:40,682 --> 01:58:44,978
Thanks a heap. You're twins.
Do you share everything?

1254
01:58:45,145 --> 01:58:49,482
- Everything. Everything.
- Give your sister her half of this!

1255
01:58:50,608 --> 01:58:54,070
Wait a minute.
They didn't do anything to you.

1256
01:58:54,237 --> 01:58:58,408
You'll never know what they did to me,
you big goon!

1257
01:58:58,575 --> 01:59:01,244
Get me out of this stinking fresh air!

1258
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:15,383
- Mother, where are you?
- Hi!

1259
01:59:16,426 --> 01:59:20,304
- You're back early. Which one are you?
- Sharon.

1260
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:24,225
- Did you have a good time?
- Sensational.

1261
01:59:24,392 --> 01:59:27,937
- We did, but I don't think Vicky did.
- What happened?

1262
01:59:28,104 --> 01:59:30,565
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

1263
01:59:30,731 --> 01:59:32,817
- How are you?
- Wonderful.

1264
01:59:32,984 --> 01:59:35,069
- Hello.
- Good evening.

1265
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:39,031
- Have you had your dinner?
- We're not hungry.

1266
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,035
Then go and have your baths.
You look filthy.

1267
01:59:43,202 --> 01:59:47,581
Then we'll tell you about Vicky,
but not while he's there.

1268
01:59:51,419 --> 01:59:55,172
So you had a wonderful time.
What happened?

1269
01:59:55,339 --> 02:00:00,052
Don't give me that. You knew darn well
what was going to happen.

1270
02:00:00,219 --> 02:00:02,138
What happened?

1271
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:06,267
You name it and it happened.
It was a shambles. Happy?

1272
02:00:06,433 --> 02:00:09,979
It's the last time
I take a woman to the mountains.

1273
02:00:10,145 --> 02:00:13,023
Where's? What's her name?

1274
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:15,401
- Vicky?
- Yeah.

1275
02:00:15,567 --> 02:00:18,612
She took off like a pelican.

1276
02:00:18,779 --> 02:00:24,743
She's probably at Park Avenue and
57th Street by now, and good luck to her.

1277
02:00:31,333 --> 02:00:35,129
- Well?
- We've been talking...

1278
02:00:36,296 --> 02:00:39,216
<i>...and we feel that we owe you an apology.</i>

1279
02:00:39,383 --> 02:00:43,637
We feel guilty about what we did to Vicky.

1280
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,724
- What did you do to her?
- Well...

1281
02:00:49,768 --> 02:00:52,062
We submarined her.

1282
02:00:53,647 --> 02:00:58,944
It's none of our business
who you want to marry, and we ruined it.

1283
02:00:59,111 --> 02:01:01,196
Well...

1284
02:01:01,363 --> 02:01:04,908
It's done with now
so we won't talk about it anymore.

1285
02:01:05,075 --> 02:01:08,328
We're sorry, Dad. Will you forgive us?

1286
02:01:08,495 --> 02:01:11,665
Go on to bed, you monsters.

1287
02:01:17,754 --> 02:01:19,631
What can you do?

1288
02:01:22,717 --> 02:01:26,680
- Want something to eat?
- You sure you've got enough?

1289
02:01:26,846 --> 02:01:31,101
Sure. I cooked enough for you and Susan
for dinner tomorrow.

1290
02:01:31,268 --> 02:01:34,479
Sharon and I are leaving in the morning.

1291
02:01:34,646 --> 02:01:37,857
- Yeah.
- Wash your hands.

1292
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:40,110
Yeah. I'd better.

1293
02:02:01,506 --> 02:02:03,591
Where's Verbena?

1294
02:02:03,758 --> 02:02:08,888
I wasn't expecting you back. It didn't
make sense for her to stay just for me,

1295
02:02:09,055 --> 02:02:11,849
so I gave her the night off.

1296
02:02:15,061 --> 02:02:19,690
I'll just go upstairs and wash up.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1297
02:02:31,953 --> 02:02:37,041
I don't know what he saw in her.
She had no personality at all.

1298
02:02:38,251 --> 02:02:39,794
Wow!

1299
02:02:39,961 --> 02:02:43,756
- Are you going to a party?
- None of your business.

1300
02:02:43,923 --> 02:02:47,468
Goodnight, ladies. Sleep tight.

1301
02:02:56,352 --> 02:02:57,895
Hi.

1302
02:02:58,062 --> 02:03:01,732
I thought you were just going
to wash your hands.

1303
02:03:01,899 --> 02:03:04,652
I thought I'd do a good job of it.

1304
02:03:04,819 --> 02:03:06,362
- Shh!
- Why?

1305
02:03:06,529 --> 02:03:11,784
Do you hear music?
I told those children to take a bath!

1306
02:03:11,951 --> 02:03:17,706
That's the hi-fi. I thought a little music
would be nice with dinner.

1307
02:03:24,004 --> 02:03:28,300
Also, I thought red wine
might be good with the stew.

1308
02:03:32,304 --> 02:03:37,976
To the mother of my children -
the most beautiful mother two kids ever had.

1309
02:03:38,143 --> 02:03:42,356
- You can be the most exasperating man.
- What's the matter?

1310
02:03:42,523 --> 02:03:46,151
Waiting until we're in the kitchen
and me in bare feet.

1311
02:03:46,318 --> 02:03:51,073
- I like you in bare feet.
- It puts a woman at a disadvantage.

1312
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,992
Good. Here's to your disadvantage.

1313
02:04:01,333 --> 02:04:05,962
Sit down and eat your stew.
Don't spill it now.

1314
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:15,472
- Darn!
- What's the matter?

1315
02:04:15,639 --> 02:04:20,310
I put a dishcloth on and it's knotted.
Open it for me.

1316
02:04:22,771 --> 02:04:28,527
Maggie, as long as everybody's apologising,
I think I'd better do mine too.

1317
02:04:28,693 --> 02:04:33,573
About the other night.
I didn't mean for it to sound like that.

1318
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:38,745
I'm not very good with compliments,
what with growing up with the cows...

1319
02:04:38,912 --> 02:04:43,625
Don't give me that routine.
You handed me that years ago.

1320
02:04:43,792 --> 02:04:46,920
- I did not.
- You certainly did.

1321
02:04:47,087 --> 02:04:50,423
It worked, didn't it? You liked it.

1322
02:05:06,648 --> 02:05:08,816
Maggie, you're so beautiful.

1323
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:12,445
No. I mean it.

1324
02:05:12,612 --> 02:05:19,118
I know I don't say things like you want to
hear them, but I've been thinking about you.

1325
02:05:20,662 --> 02:05:23,498
And us, and the way things used to be.

1326
02:05:25,958 --> 02:05:30,129
- Do you know what I miss most of all?
- Mitch...

1327
02:05:31,798 --> 02:05:34,842
You've got stew all over you.

1328
02:05:36,636 --> 02:05:40,139
- I don't care.
- Go and wash it off.

1329
02:05:50,191 --> 02:05:52,401
What do you miss?

1330
02:05:53,653 --> 02:05:55,321
Well...

1331
02:05:56,989 --> 02:05:59,992
I don't care if it does sound silly.

1332
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:05,831
I miss those wet stockings you used
to have hanging around the bathroom.

1333
02:06:06,874 --> 02:06:11,545
And I miss my razor being dull
because you used it for your legs.

1334
02:06:15,591 --> 02:06:20,304
I miss the hairpins mixed up
with the fish hooks in my tackle box.

1335
02:06:22,056 --> 02:06:26,018
It's no fun having a clothes closet
all to myself.

1336
02:06:27,269 --> 02:06:34,276
It's no fun swearing because you're not
around to pretend to be shocked by it.

1337
02:06:37,988 --> 02:06:42,785
Nothing's any good without you, Maggie.
I miss a lot of things.

1338
02:06:42,951 --> 02:06:45,162
I just miss you.

1339
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:50,918
Why did you take so long to tell me?

1340
02:06:51,084 --> 02:06:53,253
I don't know.

1341
02:06:55,839 --> 02:07:02,846
Well, because... I guess I was hoping
that you'd come back sometime.

1342
02:07:04,765 --> 02:07:09,770
Maggie, I've been a prize chump.
We've both been.

1343
02:07:12,272 --> 02:07:18,111
We're going to grow into a couple of old
lonely people if we don't do something.

1344
02:07:18,278 --> 02:07:21,198
- I know.
- You don't want that, do you?

1345
02:07:21,364 --> 02:07:23,241
No, Mitch.

1346
02:07:37,881 --> 02:07:44,304
Oh, Mitch. It's been so long. So very long.

1347
02:07:46,806 --> 02:07:52,103
Don't cry. You can slug me in the eye
any time you want.

1348
02:07:52,270 --> 02:07:54,105
OK.

1349
02:08:03,907 --> 02:08:08,453
- What's the matter?
- I just had the craziest dream.

1350
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:11,539
- Oh, my goodness.
- What is it?

1351
02:08:11,706 --> 02:08:17,629
You and I were marching along real slow,
funny-like, in organdie dresses.

1352
02:08:17,795 --> 02:08:22,592
<i>And there was music
and flowers and people.</i>

1353
02:08:47,325 --> 02:08:53,289
<i>For my love was meant for</i>

1354
02:08:53,456 --> 02:08:58,919
<i>Was heaven-sent for now</i>

1355
02:08:59,086 --> 02:09:01,255
<i>For always</i>

1356
02:09:01,422 --> 02:09:04,133
<i>For you!</i>
