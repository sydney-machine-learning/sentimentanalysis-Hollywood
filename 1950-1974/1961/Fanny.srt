1
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:17,548
Full steam ahead!

2
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,099
Enough, idiot!

3
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,771
You're using up all the steam!

4
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,110
Mmm!

5
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:03,594
Mwah!

6
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:11,572
Mm.

7
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,971
Glad to have had you aboard.

8
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,818
Oh!

9
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:48,519
Mm.

10
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,975
Bah!

11
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:55,756
Ah!

12
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:58,989
Good morning, Panisse.

13
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,951
Oysters!

14
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:03,894
Muscles!

15
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:07,328
Beautiful sardines!

16
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:13,204
Isn't anybody hungry today?

17
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:14,705
Morning, ladies.

18
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,189
Hi, Miquel.

19
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:22,543
Are you going to buy
something, or just stand there?

20
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:24,505
These oysters are very
small, aren't they?

21
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,238
If it's monsters you
want, go the aquarium.

22
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,620
Two dozen, please.

23
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,542
Morning, Honorine.

24
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,633
Morning, Escartifique.

25
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,765
Where is
your beautiful daughter?

26
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,617
It's Fanny's day off.

27
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:45,406
Mm.

28
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,407
It's all right, Cesar.

29
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:47,258
It's me, Escartifique.

30
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,163
Is your son tending bar?

31
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,428
Marius, I am here.

32
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,285
My glass of wine, please.

33
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,776
Ah!

34
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:08,759
Mm.

35
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,551
Hm.

36
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,251
Hm.

37
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,098
Thank you, Marius.

38
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:40,070
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
bum bum bum bum bum bum bum

39
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,364
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

40
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:51,261
Ha, ha!

41
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:58,148
Ahoy, there, mate,
what time is it?

42
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,630
11:30.

43
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,631
Ho, ho!

44
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,112
Hey, Marius!

45
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:04,094
Marius!

46
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,076
Marius!

47
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,468
Uh, Marius!

48
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:09,980
Oh, Marius, she's do
in any minute, Marius.

49
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,861
Shh!

50
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,723
You want the whole
world to know?

51
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:13,964
It's your big chance.

52
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:15,556
Will you be ready?

53
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:18,709
Come here.

54
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,500
Hurry up!

55
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:23,454
Ah!

56
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:32,353
Oh!

57
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:33,844
Ho, ho.

58
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,816
Already packed, huh?

59
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:37,047
And your papers?

60
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,035
Oh, ho, ho.

61
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,862
You'll get away!

62
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:52,793
Oh, ho!

63
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:58,669
Oh, what a beautiful sound, eh?

64
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,521
That's the Saigon.

65
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:01,722
She wants a pilot.

66
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,431
It's whistling, Marius.

67
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,912
Yes, it's the Saigon.

68
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:12,613
Chump!

69
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:13,624
It is the percolator!

70
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:17,608
Is that coffee for him?

71
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:18,469
Yes.

72
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,700
Want a cup?

73
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,981
No.

74
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,312
Why not?

75
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,224
Because if we drink
everything free,

76
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:26,977
There will be nothing
left for the customers.

77
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:30,290
If you meant to insult
me, you succeeded.

78
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,031
Insult?

79
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,173
What insult?

80
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,876
Hey, if at the age of 20 I
can't offer a cup of coffee

81
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,307
To a friend, what am I, huh?

82
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:38,959
You're barely 19 in 2 months.

83
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,641
Now don't be in
such a hurry to 20.

84
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:44,925
Oh, we have an
appointment later, right?

85
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:45,916
Uh, I don't know.

86
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,168
Maybe.

87
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,771
Ship ahoy!

88
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,473
Aha, ha, ha, ha.

89
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,965
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

90
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:57,968
I congratulate you on
your choice of friends.

91
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,580
A half crazy...

92
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,592
The Admiral is
completely crazy.

93
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:04,545
But is my friend.

94
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:05,235
Oh!

95
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,863
Hot today, isn't it?

96
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:16,176
Ha, ha.

97
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,809
Well, isn't somebody
going to say something?

98
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:23,864
Your poor mother will allow
you to sell fish in, uh, that?

99
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,685
I sell no fish today.

100
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:25,385
It's my birthday.

101
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:27,017
Oh, of course.

102
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:28,799
Heartfelt congratulations.

103
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,260
Ha, ha, ha.

104
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,564
Thank you, Cesar.

105
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:36,507
Here, inhale.

106
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:38,428
It's not sardine.

107
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,150
It's perfume!

108
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,111
Oh!

109
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,893
Is it very expensive?

110
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:43,594
Of course not.

111
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:46,456
But is perfume.

112
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:47,848
Mama give it to me.

113
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:51,782
She said, uh, today,
daughter, you are a woman.

114
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:53,504
I'm still not married.

115
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,796
Ha, ha, a woman!

116
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:59,219
Marius, how long ago was it
that you and Fanny were playing

117
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,593
On the floor together, with
both your noses running?

118
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,805
A cup of coffee, please.

119
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:08,008
Marius, don't you think
it's nice to be 18?

120
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,050
Not particularly.

121
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,342
It's so, well, in between.

122
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:15,285
I mean, at 17 one is
young, at 19 a man.

123
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,047
But 18...

124
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,379
Well, I have no
desire to be a man.

125
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,771
Have another whiff.

126
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:21,562
Delicious.

127
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:24,024
Fanny, don't pay any
attention to my son.

128
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,475
You're beautiful.

129
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:29,520
Soon you'll get married
and have children,

130
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,732
So they can poison
your existence.

131
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:34,044
Oh, now I poison his existence!

132
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:35,526
I do half your work.

133
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:36,476
Half my work?

134
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:37,507
Ha, ha!

135
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,469
Whenever you're needed,
you're not here.

136
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:42,022
You're a dreamer,
that's what you are.

137
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,205
You were born right
upstairs and you can't even

138
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:48,639
Learn how to proportion a
decent lemon pecan coureso.

139
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,320
You don't make two
of them the same!

140
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,073
Well, since the customer's
drink only one at a time,

141
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,424
They can't compare them.

142
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,808
What have you got to
answer to that, Cesar?

143
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,109
Now, you keep out of this.

144
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:00,370
You're only 18.

145
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,733
Now what's so
difficult about this?

146
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:08,398
Now look, one third
coureso... now pay attention!

147
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,220
Yes, sir.

148
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,232
A little fare.

149
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:15,075
Ah, and one third lemon.

150
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:15,776
See?

151
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:17,207
I see.

152
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,721
Now, a good third pecan.

153
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,082
See?

154
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:26,797
And now, add a
big fare of water.

155
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:27,497
There.

156
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:28,889
Now...

157
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,330
That makes four thirds.

158
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,031
Well?

159
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:33,443
A glass only
holds three thirds.

160
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,435
It depends on the
size of the thirds!

161
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:37,778
Well, the... that's
not arithmetic!

162
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:41,922
And a drop on the bottleneck,
is that arithmetic, too?

163
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,403
Now look!

164
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,846
You should pour it like this.

165
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,462
And push the last
drop back with a cork.

166
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:53,884
Cesar!

167
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,095
Cesar!

168
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:55,796
Cesar!

169
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,721
Cesar, hurry!

170
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,372
It's time for the hunt.

171
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,113
I'm really for this!

172
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13,343
Quickly, quickly!

173
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,586
Come on, hurry!

174
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:29,039
They always hide
it under the hat.

175
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,453
Ha, ha.

176
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:34,925
Look at them!

177
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,088
Grown men!

178
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,559
Hey, there is one.

179
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:52,893
Aha!

180
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,579
We didn't hurt you, sir?

181
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:00,941
Oh!

182
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:07,708
Good morning.

183
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,639
A lovely day.

184
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,581
Uh-oh, look.

185
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:12,763
Morning.

186
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:13,543
Good morning.

187
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:15,025
Oh, no!

188
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,516
Nice to see everyone
out this morning.

189
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:17,217
Oh!

190
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:22,703
Oh!

191
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:23,403
Oh!

192
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:41,641
Oh!

193
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,394
Why weren't you at
the dance last night?

194
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:02,712
Well, I can live
without dancing.

195
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:06,206
I danced practically
every dance with Victor.

196
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,448
A very good dancer.

197
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:11,912
Very polite and clever, too.

198
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:12,933
Victor!

199
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,116
Is he that little boy
with the large pimples?

200
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:17,898
Oh, the pimples are all gone.

201
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,519
I'm glad to hear it.

202
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,892
They've given way to boils.

203
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:22,983
Not too bad a fight.

204
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:23,683
Ha, ha.

205
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,929
Should I tell Victor that I
can't go with him next Sunday

206
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:29,629
Night?

207
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:35,265
Why should you tell him that?

208
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:36,496
I thought you might
want to take me.

209
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,944
No.

210
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,325
Don't disappoint Victor.

211
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:49,699
I might ruin what's
left of his complexion.

212
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,872
You're dense.

213
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,633
Or hopeless!

214
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,624
Or both!

215
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,204
Still playing the same
imbecilic game, I see.

216
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,126
Why, it's Monsieur Brun.

217
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:38,288
Yes, aha!

218
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:39,639
Welcome back from
Paris, Monsieur Brun.

219
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,340
Thank you.

220
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,362
It's easy to see
you're an Englishman,

221
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:43,924
You didn't kick the hat.

222
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,236
Now we can have our
card games again!

223
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:47,367
Aha, ha, ha!

224
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,068
Sit down.

225
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:48,488
Sit down.

226
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:49,639
We'll drink to your homecoming.

227
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh, thank you.

228
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,962
Marius, another glass!

229
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,402
Fanny, it's lunch time.

230
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:25,575
A plate of delicious
muscles, hm?

231
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,767
Ha, ha, ha.

232
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,798
Not for me.

233
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,245
Where did he go
in such a hurry?

234
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,546
To get dressed.

235
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:38,048
Today is Monday.

236
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,739
Is Monday something special?

237
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,331
Don't you remember?

238
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:46,826
On Monday's at 12:30 my father
lunches with his girlfriend.

239
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:47,787
Oh.

240
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,920
Oh, yes, of course.

241
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,354
Tell me, is it still the same,
um, uh, voluptuous Dutch lady?

242
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:56,166
There's a new one.

243
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,938
She is Spanish.

244
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,171
And monumental!

245
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:01,871
Oh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

246
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,777
That will be four francs each.

247
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:09,669
Four francs for that?

248
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,091
My mother
says four francs.

249
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:13,543
And from that high
court, there's no appeal.

250
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:14,914
Ha, ha.

251
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,426
Ah, to you.

252
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,797
Why don't you have
lunch with me, Fanny?

253
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,609
There's enough for two.

254
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,052
Why, I'd be delighted.

255
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,913
Marius, two anisettes.

256
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:31,251
It is not often that
a lonely old widower

257
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,853
Gets to have lunch with
such a pretty girl.

258
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:34,814
Mm.

259
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,547
And it isn't often I'm told
I'm such a pretty girl.

260
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:45,415
Ah, I see you are still wearing
your mourning band, Panisse.

261
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:46,146
Yes.

262
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,009
It will be four months tomorrow.

263
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:49,709
Poor Felicity.

264
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:58,969
On Friday, she ate an enormous
dish of bouillabaisse.

265
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:02,352
And on Sunday, ptt!

266
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,305
Oh, don't, Panisse, don't.

267
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:06,977
Such memories hurt.

268
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,438
Don't talk about her.

269
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:09,179
No, no, no.

270
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:09,879
No, no.

271
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,945
On the contrary, I
enjoy talking about it.

272
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,437
How soft your hand is.

273
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:23,853
And how cool.

274
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:25,245
Hm, mm.

275
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,576
Remarkable.

276
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:29,189
Oh, why is
that remarkable?

277
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,892
Your hand must be
just as... ah, no.

278
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,785
As a matter of fact,
it's quite warm.

279
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,547
Marius, two more anisettes.

280
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,346
If you're going
to drink, I suggest

281
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:48,228
That your free your hands.

282
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:51,341
We'll manage, you pour.

283
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:52,652
Atta boy, atta boy.

284
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:54,244
Fill our glasses.

285
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,485
They're full.

286
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:56,186
Liar.

287
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:57,667
What did you say?

288
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,368
Careful!

289
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:00,220
Careful, you're spilling it.

290
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,641
He is a little nervous today.

291
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:08,918
What manners!

292
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,463
Such a pretty hand.

293
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:14,504
Papa Panisse.

294
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:16,746
You have already
praised my hand.

295
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,068
Your right hand.

296
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:20,970
I am now referring
to your left hand.

297
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:25,125
Oh, so delicate.

298
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,339
What an agreeable sample of what
the rest of you must be like.

299
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,230
Oh, ho, ho.

300
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,020
Panisse!

301
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,422
Ha, ha.

302
00:17:32,422 --> 00:17:33,813
Ooh!

303
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:35,605
What the devil are you doing?

304
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,257
Oh, I think it's quite obvious.

305
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,338
I'm cleaning the table.

306
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,038
What?

307
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,352
Do you always clean tables while
customers are sitting them?

308
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,684
You must excuse
Marius, Papa Panisse.

309
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:47,157
He is young, probably in love.

310
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:51,561
Congratulations
on being in love.

311
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:56,196
I must confess that
from time to time

312
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,507
I have even thought to remarry.

313
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,862
Does that shock you?

314
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:03,663
Nope.

315
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:06,696
I mean, it's only
been four months.

316
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:07,627
Oh.

317
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:09,889
My conscience
would be clear.

318
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,392
Phew, I have cried more
in four months than other

319
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,933
In... in five years.

320
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:14,744
Oh!

321
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:17,537
And... and... and...
And tears of that big.

322
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,498
Oh!

323
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,911
Not only quantity but quality.

324
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:27,247
How understanding you
are for a young girl.

325
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:28,668
Fanny, your mother is calling.

326
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:29,369
Hm?

327
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,600
I did not hear her.

328
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,463
Did you, Panisse?

329
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:36,366
I doubt if I could
hear anything right now.

330
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,116
Mm.

331
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,048
Her hands have been
fully discussed,

332
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:41,771
Everybody is agreed
they're beautiful!

333
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:42,472
Nnn!

334
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:49,008
I was admiring this ring.

335
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,180
Is it gold?

336
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh, no.

337
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,582
Barely copper.

338
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:56,216
Oh, but this necklace,
though, is practically silver.

339
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,597
Hm, hm.

340
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:01,221
It was a gift from Mon Zuey
for my first communion.

341
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:05,465
Oh, it looks a lot
like silver from here.

342
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:11,353
And it gets shinier, ha, ha,
and shinier, and... and... Oh.

343
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,417
What are you up to,
you old billy goat?

344
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,799
Oh, my ears, Marius.

345
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,500
Marius.

346
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,241
Hm?

347
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,122
Remember to whom
you're talking.

348
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:26,646
I'm talking to a
70-year-old lecher!

349
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,738
I'm a young 54.

350
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,640
The truth is
somewhere in between.

351
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,142
And now don't
argue with embryos.

352
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:36,646
If I chopped your nose
it would run milk.

353
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:37,987
There's my nose.

354
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:38,688
Try it!

355
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,386
Hold my hat.

356
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,718
Marius, Panisse, please!

357
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:51,010
Well, I'm ready.

358
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,863
Well, me too!

359
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:55,285
Poor thing.

360
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:57,186
Shopkeeper!

361
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:00,470
You talk, you talk,
but you start anything.

362
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,831
Nor do you.

363
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:04,384
I'm controlling myself.

364
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:05,655
Lecher!

365
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:06,496
What?

366
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,196
Eunuch!

367
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:08,948
Oh, Marius, be consistent.

368
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,821
He can't be both.

369
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,414
Debaucher of young girls!

370
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,795
Oh!

371
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,107
That is the last straw!

372
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:18,808
Huh!

373
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:19,909
Agh!

374
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,094
Panisse!

375
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,658
Marius!

376
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,980
May I ask just what
you have in mind?

377
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,963
Choking a boy one
third your age?

378
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:36,336
Your son is a lout!

379
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,948
And with or without
your permission,

380
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,401
I intend to kick
him in the behind!

381
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,432
Argh!

382
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:46,005
Just you try, and
I kick you so hard

383
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:49,729
That all your teeth... front
and back, real or false...

384
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,000
Will rattle!

385
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,462
What's going on here?

386
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:54,374
If you touch Marius,
you will wake up

387
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,195
Tomorrow morning in a hospital.

388
00:20:56,195 --> 00:21:00,390
If I'm in the hospital,
I'll be visiting you!

389
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,172
Then you'll find
yourself in a cemetery!

390
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:06,115
Yes, putting flowers
on your grave!

391
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,707
Panisse, you have a customer!

392
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:08,798
I'm busy!

393
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,282
He wants a full set of
stays for a racing sloop.

394
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:13,062
Go-o-o.

395
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,566
I know what money means to you!

396
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,138
All right, I'll leave.

397
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:21,301
But it goes without
saying that I'm not

398
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:23,953
Setting foot in
this place again.

399
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:25,765
Your word is good
enough for me.

400
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:27,206
I don't ask for
anything in writing.

401
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:33,333
Fanny, I'll be speaking
to you very soon.

402
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,324
Now just a minute.

403
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:35,705
What about our card game?

404
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,707
Oh, I'll be back for that.

405
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:40,390
What has one thing
to do with another?

406
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,032
Four anisettes.

407
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:45,525
Here are 10 francs.

408
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,168
Keep the change, waiter!

409
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:54,474
Honorine, Honorine.

410
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:58,668
Uh, I have a very important
customer to attend to.

411
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:00,980
After that, I'd
like to talk to you

412
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,595
About a matter very
crucial to both of us.

413
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:08,077
Why of course, Panisse.

414
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,579
Any time.

415
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,872
Any time!

416
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:13,573
Mm.

417
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:28,538
Are you just a little
ashamed of yourself?

418
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:29,238
Huh?

419
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:32,011
Leading that poor
old man on that way.

420
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:33,923
Don't you realize, you
could have killed him?

421
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:36,095
Ptt!

422
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:41,301
When he looked down that...
That skimpy dress of yours,

423
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:44,644
He went red as a beet root!

424
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:45,535
Hm.

425
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:46,806
You were redder.

426
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:47,697
Marius!

427
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:48,828
Marius!

428
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,681
Marius!

429
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:54,063
Oh, she's coming in, Marius!

430
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,965
She's coming in!

431
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:58,468
Hey, you, get the cases put
away then take care of the bar.

432
00:22:58,468 --> 00:22:59,559
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

433
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,500
Thanks.

434
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,441
Ah, ha, ha!

435
00:23:05,204 --> 00:23:06,876
Oysters!

436
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,748
Muscles!

437
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:13,172
Beautiful sardines!

438
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:15,144
Oh, Fanny!

439
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,616
Come here.

440
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:18,578
Here!

441
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:26,085
Where were you running
in such a hurry?

442
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:26,966
Oh, I don't know.

443
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:30,069
I was just, uh, curious as to
Marius was off to, and, uh...

444
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:31,661
Shh!

445
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,952
Do you want the
whole port to know

446
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:34,704
You're chasing that
good-for-nothing bartender?

447
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,404
Ha!

448
00:23:35,404 --> 00:23:37,917
The whole port's known
it for a long time.

449
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,669
Only Marius is in the dark.

450
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,400
You watch your
step, young lady.

451
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,423
Oh, uh, just a few
minutes ago, Panisse

452
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,676
Asked for the honor
of speaking to me

453
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,198
On a very crucial subject.

454
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:51,230
You can guess what it's about?

455
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,302
Yes, I can guess.

456
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:54,894
When he does come
to speak to me,

457
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:56,656
I think I should be
wearing something

458
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,317
A little more...
Kee-kee... seductive.

459
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:03,082
Also, I'd like to do a little
something with my hair.

460
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,544
So you watch the store.

461
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,725
Oh, but this is my birthday.

462
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,426
You said I could have
the whole day off.

463
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:09,418
How was I to know
Panisse would be pick

464
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:11,170
Your birthday to
propose marriage to me?

465
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,871
Oh!

466
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:19,819
Mama, are you sure this
is what he has in mind?

467
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:21,641
It's what I have in mind.

468
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:22,461
Hm, hm.

469
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,443
So what chance has poor Panisse?

470
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:25,715
Mm, hm.

471
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,489
This time I saw that
look in his eye.

472
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,370
It was as close
to passion as you

473
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,853
Can expect from
a man of his age.

474
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,938
Never too late,
too late for love!

475
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:40,840
Never too late for love!

476
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:10,690
A square rigger!

477
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:21,140
Look at the cut of her sails!

478
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,619
What's it being used
for now, a training ship?

479
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:30,770
No.

480
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,521
She's going on a
scientific expedition.

481
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:33,953
A sailing boat?

482
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:34,734
Oh, yes.

483
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,866
It has to be, to
study winds and tides.

484
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:45,625
She's coming slowly
around the world.

485
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,486
Think of it.

486
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:49,709
Five years under sail.

487
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:53,222
Five years, Dunkirk,
Madagascar...

488
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,074
The isles beneath the winds.

489
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:58,397
The isles
beneath the wind!

490
00:25:58,397 --> 00:26:00,810
Has he really been
to those places?

491
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,682
No.

492
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:04,944
His mother didn't want her
little boy to go to sea.

493
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:07,627
And look at the result.

494
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:15,434
You will meet the
first mate tonight.

495
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:19,228
The sailors will do anything
for me, if they meet some girls.

496
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,640
I want to be on that ship.

497
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,825
I want to be on that ship.

498
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,586
You will, Marius.

499
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,128
You will.

500
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:31,220
You'll get away from here!

501
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,566
Honorine, Panisse is here!

502
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:38,267
Come on up.

503
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:39,248
Come on up!

504
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:45,144
Mm.

505
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:47,006
Ah!

506
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,598
Oh, Panisse, come in.

507
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:50,539
Come in!

508
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,755
Cockerels!

509
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,026
Could I offer you
a glass of wine?

510
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:57,867
You could.

511
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,118
Ha, ha.

512
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:03,012
I just concluded a deal
for a full set of sails

513
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,944
At an outrageous price.

514
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:09,689
And I'd like to drink a
toast to my shrewdness.

515
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:12,752
That calls for two toasts!

516
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:16,425
One, to your genius.

517
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:20,680
And one to our great
happiness to together.

518
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,630
Ha, ha.

519
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:31,921
You said, to our great
happiness together?

520
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,695
By that, do you mean that
you intend to come and live

521
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:40,319
With Fanny and me,
after we are married?

522
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:46,245
You would be... you
would be welcome, of course.

523
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,077
You mean, it's not me you want?

524
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,470
It's Fanny?

525
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:55,745
Oh!

526
00:27:55,745 --> 00:28:01,331
Um, well, she's 40
years younger than you.

527
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:05,534
Well, yes, but that
is not my fault.

528
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:10,910
Oh, I admit, um, I
am no spring chicken.

529
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,525
But I also admit that,
uh, I have 600,000 francs.

530
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:17,626
Hm.

531
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,989
My poor Panisse.

532
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,132
Nightgowns have no pockets.

533
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:26,115
I'm speaking for your own good.

534
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:28,918
Have you ever thought about
what sometimes happens when

535
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:31,590
An old man marries a young girl?

536
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,274
And you would be worse off than
the usual deceived husband,

537
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:38,177
Because Fanny will tell you.

538
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:42,822
But if I don't ask her,
she won't have to tell me.

539
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,748
Hm.

540
00:28:48,748 --> 00:28:54,523
Well... well, it's a
fine match for Fanny.

541
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:59,038
If she says yes, hm, hm.

542
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,410
Mm, I say yes, too.

543
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,111
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

544
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:18,487
Ah, ha, ha.

545
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:19,558
I'll bring her to the table.

546
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,049
Do that.

547
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,749
Do that!

548
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:28,327
First mate, second
mate, Marius.

549
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:29,188
Hello.

550
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:31,190
Gentlemen, Sarodi.

551
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,181
Sit down, Sarodi.

552
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:34,683
No, I'd like to dance.

553
00:29:34,683 --> 00:29:35,684
You are not dancing?

554
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:39,849
Mm, not yet.

555
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,791
Well, I'm not bashful.

556
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,722
Come on, Sarodi.

557
00:29:43,722 --> 00:29:45,174
Here we go.

558
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,586
Chief, what do you say?

559
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,229
Is there a berth for my friend?

560
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:52,842
Mm, well, we have a
Corsican practically signed,

561
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:55,184
But he wants more money.

562
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:57,967
In the meantime, just in case,
are your papers in order?

563
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:58,928
Show him your papers.

564
00:29:58,928 --> 00:29:59,628
What?

565
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:01,110
Oh, yes, uh, my papers.

566
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,811
Here.

567
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:09,518
Pardon me.

568
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,181
We're going to win this game.

569
00:30:12,181 --> 00:30:14,884
We're going to win this game.

570
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,826
Bum, bum, bum, Oh ho, oh ho.

571
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,317
Bum bum bum bum bum.

572
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,549
Well, lead.

573
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:24,713
And now let me see.

574
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:28,827
Should I lead a
spade or a heart?

575
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,273
What's the matter?

576
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:35,644
Oh, it's all right.

577
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:40,019
I... I had a slight, um,
clutching at my heart.

578
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:47,796
You know, like you do
when you eat too much.

579
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:50,259
A flutter of the heart.

580
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:01,640
They are cheating.

581
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,203
Do you accuse me of cheating?

582
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:05,504
Not you, stupid!

583
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:06,565
You haven't got the brains.

584
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:13,262
Brun, you watch this counter
figure, I'll cover Cesar.

585
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:16,395
Are you implying
that I am a cheat?

586
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:18,347
I, your childhood friend?

587
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:19,238
Ha!

588
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:20,229
Thank you, very much.

589
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,150
Oh, ho, ho.

590
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,481
Clumsy of me.

591
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,953
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

592
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:25,204
I've hurt his feelings.

593
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:26,485
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

594
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,456
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

595
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,517
Hurt my feelings?

596
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:29,358
Aha, ha, ha.

597
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:31,200
It practically breaks my heart.

598
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,351
Ha, ha, ha.

599
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,774
Isn't that true, Escartifique?

600
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:37,126
He breaks our hearts!

601
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,791
Ah, yes.

602
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,233
Yes.

603
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:49,038
And he breaks our...
I'm stupid!

604
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,490
Ha, ha, ha.

605
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,352
There.

606
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,444
This game does not count!

607
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,566
Why?

608
00:31:57,566 --> 00:32:01,340
Look into to your own
heart, and you'll see why.

609
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,452
Oh, you must take
me for a fool, no?

610
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:07,356
I thought it was very
clever, the way he did it.

611
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,770
What's the matter?

612
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,323
The Melody sails
right after dawn,

613
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,866
But you don't see
terribly excited.

614
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,698
Are you afraid to
tell your father, huh?

615
00:32:19,698 --> 00:32:22,061
Or is it Fanny?

616
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,332
Knock on my window, I told you.

617
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,213
I'll be ready.

618
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:25,184
Marius.

619
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:26,325
Tomorrow, you...

620
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:27,036
I'll be ready.

621
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,071
Goodbye, Mama.

622
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,923
Oh, I'll be back tomorrow
by the noon train!

623
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:49,018
Goodbye, darling.

624
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:49,928
Sleep late!

625
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:08,977
You know, Marius, I think it's
about time you got married.

626
00:33:08,977 --> 00:33:10,989
Me?

627
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,950
Why?

628
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,562
Oh, now, Marius.

629
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:15,274
Don't take me for an idiot.

630
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:18,047
I know you love Fanny.

631
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:18,937
Who told you?

632
00:33:18,937 --> 00:33:21,240
My little finger.

633
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,792
But that little finger
is not so bright.

634
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:27,106
If you don't, why did you go
for Panisse like a wild beast

635
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:27,856
This morning?

636
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:28,557
Ha!

637
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:29,428
I needed the exercise.

638
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:31,500
Ah, you're lying.

639
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,812
You love Fanny
and you can't bear

640
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,374
To see another man want her.

641
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:41,101
And yet, you... Listen,
is there another woman?

642
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,852
Is it one of the
young Millers girls?

643
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:45,554
No, it's not any girl.

644
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:50,799
It's... it's nothing
I can talk about now.

645
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,083
Nothing you can talk about now.

646
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,013
All right.

647
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:56,895
We'll discuss it in the morning.

648
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,398
Yes.

649
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:00,389
In the morning.

650
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,868
I plan to think
about it all night.

651
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,884
Aw, how can you think
when you yawn so much?

652
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:17,646
Hm.

653
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:18,347
Good night.

654
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:28,923
Papa, Papa, I
like you very much.

655
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:40,749
What did you say?

656
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:44,403
I... I like it very
much, you know?

657
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:46,665
Well, me too.

658
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:49,007
I... I like you very much.

659
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:50,299
Ha!

660
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,952
What did you say that to me?

661
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:55,854
Well, I... I don't know.

662
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:59,598
I...
see you think of me,

663
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,982
You... you worry over me.

664
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:06,355
And it reminds me that
I like you very much.

665
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,147
That's all.

666
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,498
Ha, ha, ha.

667
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:10,399
Of course.

668
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,700
You idiot.

669
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:16,785
Goodbye.

670
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,223
I mean, good night, Papa.

671
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:24,983
Good night.

672
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:32,901
Good night, my son.

673
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,070
You know, ha, sometimes
I say that you make

674
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,705
My life miserable,
but it's not true.

675
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:25,224
Marius.

676
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:30,619
Oh!

677
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:32,861
I must speak to, Marius.

678
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:33,742
Marius!

679
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,073
Who is there?

680
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:36,575
No one.

681
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:40,178
Lock up, then, and go to bed!

682
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:41,069
Now what is it?

683
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,341
Oh, Marius!

684
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:44,533
Check the beer barrel.

685
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:47,626
I don't think I've turned
the tap tight enough.

686
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:50,098
All right, Papa.

687
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:53,932
Um, me... meet
me at the pontoon, huh?

688
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:56,365
What are you doing up this late?

689
00:37:56,365 --> 00:37:58,947
Does your mother know you're
running all over town?

690
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:01,870
My mother is spending the night
at my Aunt Rodina's... attacks.

691
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:11,199
Do you know where
I've just come from?

692
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,220
No.

693
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,911
Panisse's.

694
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:19,057
I told him I could
not marry him.

695
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:21,720
Are you sure you
did the right thing?

696
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,051
Oh!

697
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,324
After all, he is rich.

698
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:28,997
And you know know how your
mother feels about money.

699
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:33,021
Now listen to me,
Fanny, I... I want

700
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:36,114
To talk to you like a
brother to a sister.

701
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,538
Well, you're not my brother,
and I'm not your sister.

702
00:38:39,538 --> 00:38:41,800
Oh, Fanny, what's the matter.

703
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,563
Oh, Marius!

704
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:45,914
Marius, it's you I love.

705
00:38:45,914 --> 00:38:48,367
It's you I want.

706
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,748
No!

707
00:38:49,748 --> 00:38:52,150
Now that I've said
it, please have

708
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,923
The decency not to look at me.

709
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:57,736
Well, who else can I look at?

710
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:58,617
Hm.

711
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,839
Oh, you don't love me?

712
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,791
Oh, yes, Marius, I know you do.

713
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,492
I know.

714
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:11,760
What's the difference
if I love you or not?

715
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,461
Ah!

716
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:16,865
I can't marry.

717
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:19,438
Why?

718
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:20,519
Do you dislike me then?

719
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,080
Do you hate me?
Am I something ugly to you?

720
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,781
Fanny!

721
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:30,899
I'm gonna go away.

722
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:33,692
I have to.

723
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:38,657
I'm trapped here among people
who maybe love me too much.

724
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:40,619
Look at this
harbor, these boats.

725
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,340
Every man who walks across
one of those gangplanks

726
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,574
Is a freer man than I am.

727
00:39:45,574 --> 00:39:48,126
And it... it's driven
me almost crazy.

728
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:03,161
Once, when I was a little
boy, the Admiral and I

729
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:06,314
Watched a strange ship
come into the harbor.

730
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:08,607
We went aboard and we met
an old sailor with a beard

731
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:11,940
Like a snow storm.

732
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,964
He told us about the
isle beneath the wind,

733
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:19,307
Where black trees grow.

734
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,960
And when you cut them,
they are gold inside

735
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,816
And smell of camphor and pepper.

736
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:33,472
That's when it happened, this
deep painful wish I have.

737
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,894
Whenever I see a boat
steaming out of the harbor,

738
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:39,798
It makes me dizzy,
as though I were

739
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:44,082
Falling forward...
Always to the sea.

740
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:52,340
Oh!

741
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,253
I would wait for you, Marius.

742
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,205
Five years?

743
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,026
Five years?

744
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,541
You see the Malazee?

745
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:05,023
She's leaving In the
morning and I'll be on it.

746
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:06,364
Oh, in the morning?

747
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,636
Oh!

748
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:08,336
You're young.

749
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:09,157
You'll forget me.

750
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:09,858
Forget you?

751
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:10,659
Me forget you?

752
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:11,359
How can I?

753
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,312
I've always loved you,
even when I was a child.

754
00:41:14,312 --> 00:41:16,454
Oh, when I saw you
talking to a little girl,

755
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:18,777
I'd wish she were dead.

756
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,399
I couldn't wait to grow
up to become your wife.

757
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:25,313
Every morning, I'd wake up and
I'd think, today he'll ask me.

758
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:26,775
Oh!

759
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,198
I know you do love me.

760
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,169
I know you do.

761
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:34,102
Yes.

762
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:36,084
The reason I haven't
gone before was you.

763
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:44,242
Here we are!

764
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:45,543
Here we are... oops!

765
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:46,244
Ha, ha.

766
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:46,504
Oop!

767
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,205
Ha.

768
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:49,517
Thank you so much
for the lovely ride.

769
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:51,079
Lucky we met in the square.

770
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,681
Lucky for me.

771
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:54,613
That train takes hours.

772
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,054
Fanny will be so surprised.

773
00:42:56,054 --> 00:42:57,235
Well, goodbye.

774
00:42:57,235 --> 00:42:58,036
Goodbye, yeah?

775
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:58,727
Hey!

776
00:42:58,727 --> 00:42:59,227
Hey!

777
00:42:59,227 --> 00:42:59,728
Hey!

778
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:00,228
Hey!

779
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:00,929
Oops.

780
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,721
Goodbye, and thanks again.

781
00:43:45,393 --> 00:43:46,084
Oh.

782
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,078
Uh-oh.

783
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,011
Woo.

784
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,503
Oh, my.

785
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:18,486
Oh, my god.

786
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:20,889
My god, my god!

787
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:22,400
My god!

788
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:25,513
Mm, hm.

789
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,776
It's his belt all right.

790
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:29,718
We must get them
married at once!

791
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:30,779
Oh!

792
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:34,082
She's 18, Cesar, 18!

793
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:35,503
Ah, don't cry, Honorine.

794
00:44:35,503 --> 00:44:37,285
Everything will be all right.

795
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:38,917
Have something.

796
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:39,838
A little wine.

797
00:44:44,122 --> 00:44:46,044
More.

798
00:44:46,044 --> 00:44:49,397
It's annoying, but
things will work out.

799
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:50,308
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

800
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,599
Don't cry into the rolls.

801
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,652
No, they're salty enough.

802
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:57,445
Now drink up, and we'll
decide what to do.

803
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,117
I've decided!

804
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:01,669
I'll beat her till
she's black and blue!

805
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:02,851
Aw, stop it, Honorine.

806
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:10,779
It's Marius climbing
back through the window.

807
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:12,700
Oh, I'll tear him apart!

808
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,152
Oh, no you won't.

809
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:22,680
You'll go home and
bring Fanny here.

810
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,075
I give you my word, they'll
be married in two weeks.

811
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:29,738
Oh, beautiful hat, Norine.

812
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:30,728
Now you go.

813
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:43,041
Ha, ha.

814
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,503
Marius!

815
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:46,975
Marius, are you up yet?

816
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:00,468
Good morning, Papa.

817
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,904
You overslept this
morning, didn't you?

818
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:08,696
Yeah, I read rather
late last night.

819
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:12,770
I've told you 20 times
not to read late in bed.

820
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:19,117
Oh, your eyes look tired.

821
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:21,279
Must be a very exhausting book.

822
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:28,987
You know, if I hadn't seen
you come from your room,

823
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:32,460
I'd wonder where you had been.

824
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,933
Uh...

825
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,124
Losing your trousers?

826
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:38,196
Maybe I'm getting thinner.

827
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,437
You should wear a belt.

828
00:46:39,437 --> 00:46:40,138
Oh, all right.

829
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:40,839
I'll buy one.

830
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,054
You have a good appetite.

831
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,595
Not bad.

832
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:49,507
Your reading makes
you hungry, huh?

833
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:04,442
You know, Marius, a woman's
honor is like a match.

834
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:07,555
You can use it once.

835
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:10,568
There, a little present
from Fanny's mother.

836
00:47:10,568 --> 00:47:13,641
It will save you the trouble
and expense of buying a new one.

837
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:14,332
Come on.

838
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:14,762
Come on!

839
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:15,463
Oh, no.

840
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,454
Don't, Mama, don't.
Here is the good woman now.

841
00:47:16,454 --> 00:47:17,385
You can thank her in person.

842
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:20,909
Oh, Marius!

843
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:21,829
Marius!

844
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:22,750
Hm!

845
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,153
There they are Cesar!

846
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:28,176
Romeo and Juliet.

847
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:32,570
You will ask her to marry you
right now, or I get a pistol

848
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,651
And kill you.

849
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:34,812
Oh, Mama, don't.

850
00:47:34,812 --> 00:47:35,513
Please.

851
00:47:35,513 --> 00:47:37,285
Madame, if I ask your
daughter to marry me,

852
00:47:37,285 --> 00:47:40,458
It won't be because
of your threats,

853
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,951
But because I love her.

854
00:47:42,951 --> 00:47:43,922
If?

855
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:44,883
If?

856
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:45,994
What do you mean if?

857
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:47,775
Don't worry, Honorine.

858
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:49,787
He's just saving face.

859
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:51,529
I'll help him out.

860
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:56,804
Madame Cabernice, may I ask for
the hand of your daughter Fanny

861
00:47:56,804 --> 00:47:59,047
For my son Marius?

862
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:01,239
I'll have to think it over.

863
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:03,131
Perfectly understandable.

864
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:05,823
You'll want to do a little
face-saving, yourself.

865
00:48:05,823 --> 00:48:07,145
Fine with me.

866
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:09,007
Well, Sit down, Honorine.

867
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:11,029
I'll get some
paper, pen, and ink.

868
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:12,420
What for?

869
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,511
Well, the dowry.

870
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:16,044
The dowry you're
giving your daughter.

871
00:48:16,044 --> 00:48:18,376
We'll want everything in
black and white, won't we?

872
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:20,278
Very
well, pen and ink.

873
00:48:20,278 --> 00:48:22,330
And while you're at
it, a bottle of wine!

874
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,882
We'll drink to it, too!

875
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:26,844
He's a scoundrel, your son.

876
00:48:26,844 --> 00:48:28,056
Ha, ha.

877
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:28,886
Quite a reader, too.

878
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:33,721
You haven't got much time.

879
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:35,503
She's going to sail.

880
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:38,406
I'm not going.

881
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:39,777
Not going?

882
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:40,488
No.

883
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:42,971
Now, what are you
giving your child?

884
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:44,882
All the shellfish in the shop.

885
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:46,834
If she looks after
it, she can make

886
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,457
As much as 40 francs
a day, net profit.

887
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:50,158
And you?

888
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:51,359
What will give them?

889
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,463
Well, uh, Marius can help
me in the bar until I retire.

890
00:48:55,463 --> 00:48:56,164
Look.

891
00:48:56,164 --> 00:49:00,938
After I die, Marius will have
this bar all for himself.

892
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:01,749
Ha, ha, ha.

893
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,952
By that time, he
should be able to make

894
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:06,684
A decent lemon pecan coureso.

895
00:49:06,684 --> 00:49:08,426
They'll have a
wonderful life, Norine.

896
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,552
I've been very happy
behind this bar.

897
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:17,795
And Marius will have a
fine life behind it, too.

898
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:19,437
If you don't sail
on the Malazee,

899
00:49:19,437 --> 00:49:24,022
You will be stuck here
the rest of your life.

900
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:28,126
Hey!

901
00:49:28,126 --> 00:49:29,637
We're going to have a show!

902
00:49:34,862 --> 00:49:35,563
Cappy!

903
00:49:35,563 --> 00:49:37,535
Oh, how exciting.

904
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,008
Oh, thank you.

905
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:40,989
Go back a little more.

906
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:43,951
Go.

907
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,821
Cesar!

908
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:55,643
Cesar!

909
00:49:55,643 --> 00:49:56,344
Look it!

910
00:49:56,344 --> 00:49:58,166
Think what you're giving up!

911
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,048
Hey, Marius!

912
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:01,919
I'm going to see that ship sail.

913
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:02,880
You take care of the bar.

914
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,082
The scoundrel!

915
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:06,664
Come on!

916
00:50:10,278 --> 00:50:13,281
How long do you think
you will keep him?

917
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:18,380
He will clean baths, wash
bottles, breed children,

918
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,974
And grow to hate the woman
who tied him to this life.

919
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:28,916
He will never hate me.

920
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:31,259
You wait and see.

921
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:32,670
Ha!

922
00:50:37,885 --> 00:50:42,850
Monsieur the Captain,
distinguished scientists,

923
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,423
Ladies and gentlemen...

924
00:50:45,423 --> 00:50:46,164
Some scientists.

925
00:50:46,164 --> 00:50:47,435
We are
all here today...

926
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:48,136
Ha, ha.

927
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:50,448
Not one a day over 35.

928
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:51,149
No beards!

929
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:53,901
Not even eyeglasses!

930
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:57,245
It is going on
the scientific expedition

931
00:50:57,245 --> 00:51:01,559
To the far corners of the earth.

932
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,643
We will stay here in
our humble surroundings

933
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:08,506
And spell out our
hum-drum lives,

934
00:51:08,506 --> 00:51:14,043
While you sail the seven seas,
smell the perfumes of Arabia,

935
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:19,517
Plunders depths
of the Coral Seas.

936
00:51:19,517 --> 00:51:20,268
What's the matter?

937
00:51:20,268 --> 00:51:22,510
I saw your face when my
mother and your father

938
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,721
Were planning your life.

939
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:24,702
Why talk about it?

940
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:25,733
It's settled.

941
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:27,375
Do you really want
to marry me that much?

942
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,227
Marriage is for ones
who love, you know?

943
00:51:29,227 --> 00:51:30,468
I know that.

944
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:31,569
Are you sure you
love me enough?

945
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:32,980
Look, there's the Malazee.

946
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,392
All you have to do
is cross the cape.

947
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:37,375
Don't tempt me, Fanny!

948
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:41,199
You heard what I told
the Admiral, I'm staying.

949
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,900
For how long?

950
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,823
If you help me, forever.

951
00:51:45,823 --> 00:51:47,735
Marius, I don't
want you to stay

952
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:48,736
Because you think you have to.

953
00:51:48,736 --> 00:51:49,717
You don't owe me anything.

954
00:51:49,717 --> 00:51:50,688
I ran after you.

955
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:52,950
What are you trying
to do, force me to go?

956
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:53,651
No!

957
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:54,792
I just want you to be happy.

958
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,024
I want you to do what
you really want to do.

959
00:51:57,024 --> 00:51:58,566
I don't understand you, Fanny.

960
00:51:58,566 --> 00:52:01,309
If you really, really loved me,
you would try to hold me back

961
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:04,302
With every ounce of your
strength, wouldn't you?

962
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:07,155
What's changed you since last?

963
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:08,075
Alexandria!

964
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:10,908
Do... don't tell me
you're... you're sorry

965
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:13,251
Now you said no to Panisse?

966
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:15,243
Oh!

967
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:17,695
Are you?

968
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:18,396
Are you sorry?

969
00:52:20,948 --> 00:52:26,554
Marius, while Cesar are my
mother were planning your life,

970
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:27,605
They were planning mine, too.

971
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:28,966
And I couldn't help it.

972
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:32,350
A different sort of life
was flashing before my eyes.

973
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,742
A beautiful home, not to
belong behind a bar and a maid

974
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:36,043
And dresses and everything.

975
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:36,914
Then it's true.

976
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:38,176
You are sorry you
said no to Panisse.

977
00:52:38,176 --> 00:52:39,447
And I wasn't just
thinking of myself.

978
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,300
My mother is getting
old and tired.

979
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,353
There are other things to
life than love, aren't there?

980
00:52:45,353 --> 00:52:46,344
Are there?

981
00:52:51,779 --> 00:52:54,482
Last night meant nothing to you?

982
00:52:54,482 --> 00:52:55,953
Were you lying to me last night.

983
00:52:55,953 --> 00:52:56,674
Oh, no.

984
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,096
I wasn't lying to
you last night.

985
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,389
Well, Th... then
you're lying to me now.

986
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:02,910
Oh, god help me!

987
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:03,891
Help you?

988
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:05,373
Help you?

989
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:07,345
Help me make you understand.

990
00:53:07,345 --> 00:53:09,096
Last night there was
moonlight on the water,

991
00:53:09,096 --> 00:53:11,929
There was... there was music
from the boats... there

992
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:14,802
Was the fresh
scent from the sea.

993
00:53:14,802 --> 00:53:16,033
Today... today,
there's only the smell

994
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:18,876
Of... of dishwater
and fish stalls.

995
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,948
The smell of money, you mean!

996
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:21,899
Marius?

997
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,522
Oh, Marius, go, before we say
things to each other that...

998
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:26,964
When I was... when I was
struggling with myself,

999
00:53:26,964 --> 00:53:28,676
You were only thinking
of all the things

1000
00:53:28,676 --> 00:53:29,477
That go with Panisse!
Marius, go!

1001
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:30,488
Go!

1002
00:53:30,488 --> 00:53:31,188
Hurry!

1003
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:32,610
Leave me alone, will you?

1004
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:42,990
Fanny, only you can stop me.

1005
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:48,055
Now tell me that you
love me, and tell me now.

1006
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:53,712
Marius, I tell you,
you are free to go.

1007
00:53:57,705 --> 00:54:00,698
All right, then it's settled!

1008
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:02,159
Each to his love.

1009
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,293
You marry Panisse's money,
and I will marry the sea!

1010
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:05,993
Ha, ha!

1011
00:54:08,986 --> 00:54:12,480
will profit
by this important mission.

1012
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,983
Gentlemen, we salute you.

1013
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,475
We wish you well.

1014
00:54:17,475 --> 00:54:20,978
Come back when your noble
mission is accomplished.

1015
00:54:20,978 --> 00:54:22,920
Cesar, can I speak
to you a minute?

1016
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,141
Of course.

1017
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:25,373
Ha, ha, ha.

1018
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:28,085
Fanny, my daughter-in-law.

1019
00:54:28,085 --> 00:54:29,206
Ha, ha.

1020
00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:30,498
Ah, it's happened.

1021
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:32,670
Now, what is it you wanted
to talk to me about?

1022
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,613
Cesar...

1023
00:54:35,613 --> 00:54:37,705
Marius, oh please, hurry!

1024
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:40,017
Marius and I will
have to find an apartment.

1025
00:54:40,017 --> 00:54:40,718
What do you mean?

1026
00:54:40,718 --> 00:54:42,820
You... you will
both live with me.

1027
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,521
Huh!

1028
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,102
I don't to live alone.

1029
00:54:45,102 --> 00:54:45,793
Goodbye.

1030
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:46,774
Goodbye.

1031
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:47,745
So long now.

1032
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:54,972
Have you seen my
big room upstairs?

1033
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:55,943
Ah, come!

1034
00:54:55,943 --> 00:54:58,366
I'll show it to you.

1035
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:12,580
Just a little money, and some
taste, it can be fixed up.

1036
00:55:19,537 --> 00:55:22,019
Brum brum bum bum
bum bum bum bum bum

1037
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,502
Brrum brum brump
a bum bum bum bum.

1038
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:27,475
Brump a bum, brump a bum.

1039
00:55:27,475 --> 00:55:28,466
Cesar!

1040
00:55:28,466 --> 00:55:29,957
Brum brum
brum bum bum bum

1041
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:34,221
Brump a bum brum bum brum brum.

1042
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:34,922
Ha?

1043
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:36,654
Quite a view from that window.

1044
00:55:36,654 --> 00:55:37,615
Ha, ha.

1045
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:41,609
I'll take Marius' room, and
you two can have this one.

1046
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:42,630
Cesar!

1047
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,361
Cesar!

1048
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:44,061
I'm here.

1049
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:46,454
I'm up here.

1050
00:55:46,454 --> 00:55:49,316
Listen, Fanny, uh,
just one thing.

1051
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:51,709
Leave the bed where it is.

1052
00:55:51,709 --> 00:55:56,253
Marius was born there and
his mother died there.

1053
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:57,735
Cesar!

1054
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,116
Well, what is it?

1055
00:55:59,116 --> 00:56:00,488
The Malazee's sailing.

1056
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:01,719
Did you know that...

1057
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:06,213
Is that what you
ran all the way for?

1058
00:56:09,096 --> 00:56:11,519
Now, look, Fanny.

1059
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,391
You see this little door?

1060
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:15,593
It leads to a little room.

1061
00:56:15,593 --> 00:56:19,507
Ah, if you like... ha, ha,
ha, it would please me...

1062
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,039
You could put a
little bed in there.

1063
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:23,631
Oh, not a very big bed.

1064
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,443
You know, a tiny one.

1065
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:27,745
In fact... Fanny!

1066
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:29,927
Marius, Marius!

1067
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,298
My god, where is he?

1068
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:34,792
I'll get some rags.

1069
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,283
Marius!

1070
00:56:36,283 --> 00:56:37,775
Marius!

1071
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:39,276
Marius, where are you?

1072
00:56:44,762 --> 00:56:46,053
Marius?

1073
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:46,754
Marius!

1074
00:57:30,097 --> 00:57:31,929
Kick it!

1075
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:33,060
Kick it!

1076
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,502
Shh!

1077
00:57:34,502 --> 00:57:35,202
Uh!

1078
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:35,903
Pstt!

1079
00:57:35,903 --> 00:57:37,675
A tourist.

1080
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:38,405
Idiot!

1081
00:57:38,405 --> 00:57:39,106
Nincompoop!

1082
00:57:39,106 --> 00:57:40,287
Moron!

1083
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:44,191
How many times have I pounded
it into your thick skull?

1084
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,713
One third lemon.

1085
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:46,974
No more, no less!

1086
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:48,506
Now, watch me.

1087
00:57:51,028 --> 00:57:53,440
Since Marius left, there's
been no living with him.

1088
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,141
Poor Cesar.

1089
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,594
I think he's going crazy.

1090
00:57:56,594 --> 00:57:57,545
Is it possible?

1091
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:58,636
In 10 weeks?

1092
00:57:58,636 --> 00:57:59,476
Certainly.

1093
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:04,872
I knew someone that, he had
a softening of the brain,

1094
00:58:04,872 --> 00:58:06,453
You see?

1095
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:11,018
It... it... it just
melted away in... inside.

1096
00:58:11,018 --> 00:58:15,553
And at the end, when he would
shake his head to say no,

1097
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:20,047
One would hear, gulm, gulm.

1098
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:20,968
It was splashing!

1099
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,307
Waiting for the postman.

1100
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:35,883
It's hard to believe, Marius
hasn't written to him once.

1101
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:37,925
Oh, Cesar.

1102
00:58:37,925 --> 00:58:39,527
Cesar!

1103
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:42,720
You are waiting for someone?

1104
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,593
Why should I be
waiting for someone?

1105
00:58:45,593 --> 00:58:48,485
Why are you spying on
me, Monsieur Panisse?

1106
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:50,447
Who pays you?

1107
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:53,190
Cesar, I'm not spying on you.

1108
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:56,373
Then why do you fix
your beady eyes on me

1109
00:58:56,373 --> 00:58:59,226
And asked me if I'm
waiting for someone?

1110
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:01,979
May I have the
honor to inform you

1111
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:05,362
That I don't give two
snaps of the finger?

1112
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:08,225
Cesar, forgive me.

1113
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:11,408
I have the feeling that you
are waiting for the postman.

1114
00:59:11,408 --> 00:59:13,180
That's enough!

1115
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,433
I forbid you to meddle
in my private affairs!

1116
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,856
Do I ask you if your
wife is deceiving you

1117
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:21,819
With the president of
Chamber of Commerce?

1118
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:25,352
You're not asking
me, you're telling me.

1119
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:26,243
Oh!

1120
00:59:26,243 --> 00:59:27,575
All you gentlemen together.

1121
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:30,337
That will save me
a bit of travel.

1122
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,238
Ha, ha.

1123
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:34,642
Monsieur Escartifique, three
for you, nothing but bills.

1124
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:37,304
A postcard from your bother
Louie, Monsieur Panisse, sir.

1125
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:38,776
All is well.

1126
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:41,498
I'm afraid I have nothing
for you, Monsieur Brun.

1127
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:45,262
Hey, uh, uh, today is the
day for my Bartenders Journal,

1128
00:59:45,262 --> 00:59:46,113
Is it not?

1129
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:46,814
Oh.

1130
00:59:46,814 --> 00:59:49,807
Uh, oh, yes, uh, here it is.

1131
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:51,318
And... and a letter, too.

1132
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:52,830
Oh.

1133
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,823
Let's see, Port Said.

1134
00:59:55,823 --> 00:59:59,316
Oh, I was never there, but I'm
told I'm not missing anything.

1135
00:59:59,316 --> 01:00:00,017
Ha, ha.

1136
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,442
Oh, Cesar, are
you trying to make

1137
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:19,717
Us believe that you
don't love your son?

1138
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,419
I never said that.

1139
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:24,211
I worship him.

1140
01:00:24,211 --> 01:00:27,975
But after what he's done
to me, it's finished.

1141
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:30,768
And actually, what has he done?

1142
01:00:30,768 --> 01:00:32,830
What has he done?

1143
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,312
He deserted me,
that's what he's done!

1144
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:37,474
Cesar, with all due respect,
you are a big egotist.

1145
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,687
I mean, if a boy wants
to sail, let him.

1146
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:44,351
He can sail where ever he
likes, but not on the sea!

1147
01:00:44,351 --> 01:00:45,582
Where
else can he sail?

1148
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:47,735
Well, he can sail like
you, in the harbor!

1149
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:48,455
Huh!

1150
01:00:48,455 --> 01:00:52,139
Good lord, does he have
to sail for a living?

1151
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:54,021
Does Monsieur Panisse sail?

1152
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:54,932
Ha, ha, ha.

1153
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:55,843
Oh, no.

1154
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:57,675
He's not so stupid.

1155
01:00:57,675 --> 01:00:59,346
He makes sails.

1156
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:04,833
Yes, so that the wind can take
away other people's children!

1157
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:17,005
Grown men playing this silly,
childish, asinine game!

1158
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,272
I heard you got a
letter from Marius today.

1159
01:01:25,272 --> 01:01:26,093
Yes.

1160
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:26,794
Did you?

1161
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,377
How is he?

1162
01:01:30,377 --> 01:01:32,409
Fine.

1163
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:35,192
Happy, I think.

1164
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:35,893
Here.

1165
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,454
You read it to me.

1166
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:41,198
Every time I read it I get
first so angry, and then so sad.

1167
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:45,482
I can't make head or tail of it.

1168
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:46,984
I was having a first taste.

1169
01:01:51,338 --> 01:01:52,039
No more service.

1170
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:53,590
We're closed.

1171
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,752
But why?

1172
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:55,933
Ahh!

1173
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:57,975
Because all the
bottles are poisoned.

1174
01:01:57,975 --> 01:01:58,675
Poisoned?

1175
01:01:58,675 --> 01:01:59,376
Yes!

1176
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:10,327
Go ahead, Fanny.

1177
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:14,601
My dear Father, please
forgive me for the pain I

1178
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:17,004
Have caused you.

1179
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:19,767
I want you to know that I
think of you every evening.

1180
01:02:19,767 --> 01:02:21,098
Ha, ha!

1181
01:02:21,098 --> 01:02:22,900
Thinks of me every evening!

1182
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,713
But I'm stupid enough to think
of him all day long, too.

1183
01:02:26,713 --> 01:02:28,065
Go on.

1184
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:30,457
At first, they made
me assistant cook.

1185
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:31,158
Ha!

1186
01:02:31,158 --> 01:02:31,939
Ha, ha.

1187
01:02:31,939 --> 01:02:34,802
Assistant cook!

1188
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:36,784
But after several
days they replaced me.

1189
01:02:36,784 --> 01:02:37,484
Naturally!

1190
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:40,017
They were all starving to death!

1191
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:41,278
Ha, ha, ha!

1192
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:43,170
A crew of skeletons!

1193
01:02:48,105 --> 01:02:49,526
At Port Said...

1194
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:50,767
Oh, yes, yes.

1195
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,698
Terrible here.

1196
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:52,880
Oh?

1197
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,043
A sailor got some
mysterious illness.

1198
01:02:56,043 --> 01:02:57,224
They thought it was the plague.

1199
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:58,445
The plague!

1200
01:02:58,445 --> 01:02:59,146
Oh!

1201
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:01,288
When his schoolmates
had the measles,

1202
01:03:01,288 --> 01:03:03,380
I kept Marius home a month!

1203
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,633
And now, he's on a
boat with the plague!

1204
01:03:06,633 --> 01:03:08,375
The Black Death!

1205
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:11,598
The neck swells up,
the eyes pop out,

1206
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:15,302
The tongue hangs out like a
beef tongue, and the navel...

1207
01:03:15,302 --> 01:03:16,693
But they found out
it wasn't the plague.

1208
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:18,705
All right, then say
so at once, you stupid!

1209
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,914
We are now engaged
in measuring...

1210
01:03:26,914 --> 01:03:29,556
Oh, yes, it, uh, it
gets scientific here.

1211
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,229
In measuring the
depths of the Indian Ocean.

1212
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:32,930
Eh?

1213
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,331
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1214
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:37,594
Oh, this boy... this
boy who couldn't even

1215
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:39,877
Measure a lemon pecan coureso.

1216
01:03:39,877 --> 01:03:42,329
He's now measuring an ocean.

1217
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:43,030
Ah.

1218
01:03:46,013 --> 01:03:47,734
Please don't worry
about me, Father.

1219
01:03:50,257 --> 01:03:52,259
I'm as happy as a fish in water.

1220
01:03:55,682 --> 01:03:59,286
I embrace you with all my heart.

1221
01:03:59,286 --> 01:04:02,459
Your son, Marius.

1222
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:04,862
Your son, Marius.

1223
01:04:09,196 --> 01:04:14,461
Uh, there is a
postscript, is there not?

1224
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:16,683
Please write me
about Fanny, how

1225
01:04:16,683 --> 01:04:22,329
She is, and about her marriage...
Her marriage to Panisse.

1226
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:23,030
Oh, yes.

1227
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,562
This, um, this confuses me.

1228
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:30,978
Why does Marius think that
you are marrying Panisse?

1229
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:31,808
Because I told him so.

1230
01:04:31,808 --> 01:04:33,640
I lied to him.

1231
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,531
You?

1232
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:35,372
You lied?

1233
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,353
Ha, ha, ha.

1234
01:04:36,353 --> 01:04:38,825
Ah, I don't believe it.

1235
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:42,209
You're lying to me now.

1236
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:44,381
What's the difference anyway?

1237
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,693
He's as happy as a fish
in water, isn't he?

1238
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:52,609
He'll write to
you soon, I'm sure.

1239
01:06:55,242 --> 01:06:57,234
Holy
Mother, forgive me.

1240
01:06:57,234 --> 01:07:00,227
And forgive my sin,
but I love him so.

1241
01:07:00,227 --> 01:07:06,203
Oh, please let him return to
give me his name for his child.

1242
01:07:06,203 --> 01:07:09,696
Give me courage,
Holy Mother, to live,

1243
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:12,189
And strength to tell my mother.

1244
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:16,813
Fanny, what is it?

1245
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:19,436
What are you doing back here?

1246
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:22,299
Where have you been?

1247
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,071
Mama,

1248
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:24,971
What is it, Fanny?

1249
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:30,087
Mama, I'm going to have a baby.

1250
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:35,652
It's true, Mama.

1251
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,545
Oh, no!

1252
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:39,996
No!

1253
01:07:39,996 --> 01:07:43,620
I am not going to scream
here, on the boat.

1254
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:47,714
I am going to the house
where no one can hear me!

1255
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,306
Dear God!

1256
01:07:49,306 --> 01:07:50,307
Dear God!

1257
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,142
Don't come into my house!

1258
01:08:05,142 --> 01:08:05,842
Mama!

1259
01:08:05,842 --> 01:08:07,324
Or I'll lock the
door in your face!

1260
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:10,437
Mama, beat me, do anything,
but let me stay with you.

1261
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:11,198
Go!

1262
01:08:11,198 --> 01:08:11,888
Go!

1263
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:13,350
Mama!

1264
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:16,643
Walk the street!

1265
01:08:16,643 --> 01:08:18,675
Walk the streets!

1266
01:08:18,675 --> 01:08:19,646
Oh!

1267
01:08:19,646 --> 01:08:21,588
Oh, Mama.

1268
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:24,491
No, Mam... Mama, Mama!

1269
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:25,462
I said, get out!

1270
01:08:25,462 --> 01:08:27,184
Get out!

1271
01:08:27,184 --> 01:08:27,884
Out!

1272
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:28,585
Out!

1273
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:32,479
Fanny, Fanny.

1274
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,734
Fanny, my darling girl,
oh, don't die my baby!

1275
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,055
Oh!

1276
01:08:39,055 --> 01:08:40,237
I forgive you anything.

1277
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:41,218
Just don't die.

1278
01:08:45,662 --> 01:08:47,144
Oh.

1279
01:08:47,144 --> 01:08:49,115
Ah.

1280
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:52,078
Are you all right, my baby?

1281
01:08:52,078 --> 01:08:54,691
Well, who was it,
you wicked girl?

1282
01:08:54,691 --> 01:08:57,204
Marius, I suppose.

1283
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:58,175
Oh!

1284
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:02,349
That Marius with
his dreamy eyes!

1285
01:09:02,349 --> 01:09:04,691
Now we know what he
was dreaming about.

1286
01:09:04,691 --> 01:09:09,586
Well, when can we
expect this disgrace?

1287
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:11,087
In March.

1288
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:11,898
March!

1289
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:12,799
Perfect!

1290
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,021
The month of March
hails in lunatics!

1291
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:18,745
Oh, Mama, what am I to do?

1292
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:19,996
Do?

1293
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:20,697
Do?

1294
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:24,010
Marry Panisse.

1295
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:24,971
Oh!

1296
01:09:24,971 --> 01:09:26,793
He asks for you every day.

1297
01:09:26,793 --> 01:09:31,618
Oh, couldn't I go
on earning my living

1298
01:09:31,618 --> 01:09:35,982
And... and... and
not marry anyone?

1299
01:09:35,982 --> 01:09:40,607
Raise my baby with... with
the money I can put aside?

1300
01:09:40,607 --> 01:09:41,728
Listen, Fanny.

1301
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:43,590
If you refuse
Panisse, we would have

1302
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:49,196
To move away... the disgrace!

1303
01:09:49,196 --> 01:09:50,247
The disgrace!

1304
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:52,729
Oh, good God help me.

1305
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:56,022
But would he still want me?

1306
01:09:56,022 --> 01:10:00,347
Well, fortunately, he
doesn't know about the baby.

1307
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:02,879
Hm?

1308
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:07,304
Oh, well, you mean,
I shouldn't tell him?

1309
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:12,078
Don't bother Panisse
with details like that.

1310
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:14,231
Oh, oh, no.

1311
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:15,692
I must tell him.

1312
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:17,874
It would be criminal not to.

1313
01:10:17,874 --> 01:10:19,246
Why?

1314
01:10:19,246 --> 01:10:20,747
Are you even sure it's true?

1315
01:10:20,747 --> 01:10:22,579
Oh, it's true, all right.

1316
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:24,070
Dr. Venelle said so.

1317
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:24,771
Aah!

1318
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:26,353
Dr. Venelle, that idiot!

1319
01:10:26,353 --> 01:10:28,044
He's at least 70 years old.

1320
01:10:28,044 --> 01:10:29,476
Well, then if it
isn't true, I don't

1321
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,037
Have to get married, do I?

1322
01:10:31,037 --> 01:10:34,681
You can get married
without being pregnant.

1323
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:35,962
Lots of girls do it!

1324
01:10:57,624 --> 01:11:00,797
On an expensive hat
like this, couldn't you

1325
01:11:00,797 --> 01:11:03,930
Have used, at least,
a... a... a fresh orange?

1326
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:08,174
I'm sorry, Sir Panisse, but
I took you for an American.

1327
01:11:08,174 --> 01:11:09,726
An American?

1328
01:11:09,726 --> 01:11:12,118
From behind.

1329
01:11:12,118 --> 01:11:13,169
All right.

1330
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:15,592
It's quite possible,
but in the future,

1331
01:11:15,592 --> 01:11:19,636
When you see an American,
make sure it is not me, eh?

1332
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,621
Fanny.

1333
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:36,633
Oh!

1334
01:11:36,633 --> 01:11:38,234
Panisse, can I talk
to you a minute?

1335
01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:39,275
Certainly, Fanny.

1336
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:42,248
Come in, please.

1337
01:11:42,248 --> 01:11:43,940
You must excuse the
way I'm dressed.

1338
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,122
I've just come from the
wedding of a friend.

1339
01:11:46,122 --> 01:11:47,454
Oh.

1340
01:11:47,454 --> 01:11:50,457
Lunch, everybody.

1341
01:11:50,457 --> 01:11:52,579
Monsieur Panisse, we
have already had lunch.

1342
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:53,279
Lunch!

1343
01:12:01,678 --> 01:12:05,772
Well, Fanny?

1344
01:12:05,772 --> 01:12:09,566
Monsieur Panisse, my
mother tells me that

1345
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:11,718
You've come several
times to ask her...

1346
01:12:11,718 --> 01:12:13,329
Fanny, you haven't
come to say that...

1347
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,962
Yes, except...

1348
01:12:15,962 --> 01:12:18,304
Except that you hesitate.

1349
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:21,528
Because of you and Marius?

1350
01:12:21,528 --> 01:12:25,792
Fanny, the morning
Marius sailed,

1351
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:28,975
I was up in front
of my shop early.

1352
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:34,190
I saw him coming
out of your house.

1353
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:34,971
Oh!

1354
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:37,313
Don't feel bad about it.

1355
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:42,268
Fanny, w-w-wuh when a man of my
age marries a... a young girl,

1356
01:12:42,268 --> 01:12:46,943
The... the scales are not
quite in... in balance.

1357
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:52,859
But if the young girl has
been discreetly indiscreet,

1358
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:57,584
Well, it restores a
little the balance.

1359
01:12:57,584 --> 01:13:00,196
Oh, Panisse, how good you are.

1360
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:03,089
I would work like a
slave to make you happy.

1361
01:13:03,089 --> 01:13:05,011
I would be a servant to you.

1362
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:07,474
I'm not asking you
to be my servant.

1363
01:13:07,474 --> 01:13:08,875
I'm asking you to be my wife.

1364
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:13,129
I accept you, Panisse.

1365
01:13:13,129 --> 01:13:13,830
Oh!

1366
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,531
Ho!

1367
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:15,882
Fanny!

1368
01:13:15,882 --> 01:13:18,725
Fanny, I'll devote myself
to you for completely.

1369
01:13:18,725 --> 01:13:22,138
I'll be so tender,
so considerate,

1370
01:13:22,138 --> 01:13:25,472
And make you so happy you'll
forget all about Marius.

1371
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:26,172
Oh!

1372
01:13:29,766 --> 01:13:30,977
I can't marry you, Panisse.

1373
01:13:30,977 --> 01:13:34,451
I'm very sorry I said I could.

1374
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,391
Why not?

1375
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:36,983
I haven't even the
right to kill myself.

1376
01:13:39,796 --> 01:13:41,187
Is it a baby?

1377
01:13:41,187 --> 01:13:42,749
Are you sure?

1378
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:45,331
The doctor told you?

1379
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:46,553
Is that why you look so pale?

1380
01:13:46,553 --> 01:13:48,925
Oh, Panisse, please don't
tell my mother that you know,

1381
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,998
And that's why you refused me.

1382
01:13:51,998 --> 01:13:54,501
You'll give me the baby?

1383
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,533
He'll have my name?

1384
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:57,343
Oh.

1385
01:13:57,343 --> 01:14:01,277
Monsieur Panisse, do you mean,
do mean you still want me now?

1386
01:14:01,277 --> 01:14:02,619
Oh, come with me, Fanny.

1387
01:14:06,062 --> 01:14:07,744
Look up there.

1388
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:09,365
Henri Panisse.

1389
01:14:09,365 --> 01:14:12,579
You notice how... how the
letters are squeezed together

1390
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:16,242
On the left, and on the
right side, nothing?

1391
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:18,434
Do you know why?

1392
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:21,538
Come with me.

1393
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:24,981
Now, now, now,
uh, uh, now, I... I

1394
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:29,516
Will show you what
it would spell.

1395
01:14:29,516 --> 01:14:30,507
Thirty years!

1396
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,169
For thirty years they have
been on this shelf, see?

1397
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:36,673
Ha, ha, on this shelf, and...
And... and now they will...

1398
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:38,434
They will go up
where they belong.

1399
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:39,295
Look, look!

1400
01:14:39,295 --> 01:14:41,998
Panisse and son!

1401
01:14:41,998 --> 01:14:43,960
And son!

1402
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,884
Aha, ha, ha!

1403
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:51,357
Does anyone else know
your... your... your secret?

1404
01:14:51,357 --> 01:14:52,779
The doctor knows.

1405
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,582
Well, doctors don't talk
because they're doctors.

1406
01:14:55,582 --> 01:14:58,354
And mothers can't talk
because they're mothers.

1407
01:14:58,354 --> 01:14:59,566
Anyone else?

1408
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:00,376
No one, I swear.

1409
01:15:00,376 --> 01:15:01,197
Oh!

1410
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:02,438
Fine, fine!

1411
01:15:02,438 --> 01:15:03,389
Fine!

1412
01:15:03,389 --> 01:15:04,120
Fine!

1413
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:04,811
Fine!

1414
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:05,772
A very good day!

1415
01:15:05,772 --> 01:15:07,103
Ah, ha, ha.

1416
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:13,040
And now, uh, now when
is my little one due?

1417
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,341
In March.

1418
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:17,914
March!

1419
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:20,436
The month of geniuses!

1420
01:15:20,436 --> 01:15:21,658
March!

1421
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:23,419
Ha, ha!

1422
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:26,773
A seven month baby.

1423
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:27,624
Eh!

1424
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:31,097
That rather makes me out to
be, ha, ha, a rake, you know?

1425
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:31,798
Ha, ha!

1426
01:15:31,798 --> 01:15:35,421
Panisse, are you sure
you won't regret this?

1427
01:15:35,421 --> 01:15:37,904
L-I-listen, Fanny.

1428
01:15:37,904 --> 01:15:40,847
There hasn't been a... a
baby in the Panisse family

1429
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:42,819
For 50 years.

1430
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:45,051
They were all counting on me.

1431
01:15:45,051 --> 01:15:49,716
My poor wife, it was impossible
for her to... to have a child.

1432
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:50,787
Oh, ho!

1433
01:15:50,787 --> 01:15:52,879
The doctors we saw!

1434
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:53,830
Ha, ha!

1435
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,674
All the... the mineral waters
we drank...

1436
01:15:57,674 --> 01:16:03,129
The candles we... we lit, the...
The calisthenics we... we tried.

1437
01:16:03,129 --> 01:16:04,420
Ha, ha.

1438
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:09,517
And now, now blessed mother,
everything is changed.

1439
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:17,043
A wife and a son of my very own.

1440
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:17,984
Oh, ho, ho.

1441
01:16:17,984 --> 01:16:19,535
Fanny!

1442
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:23,790
Fanny, we'll give
him everything!

1443
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,842
But if it's a girl?

1444
01:16:25,842 --> 01:16:28,454
We'll give her
almost everything.

1445
01:16:28,454 --> 01:16:31,277
And besides, it's very unlikely.

1446
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:34,841
There are only
boys in my family.

1447
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,432
Panisse!

1448
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:38,264
Panisse, I want to
show you something.

1449
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:41,818
A picture of Marius he
sent me from Madagascar.

1450
01:16:41,818 --> 01:16:45,642
Doesn't it... well,
I'm sorry, Fanny.

1451
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:46,683
I didn't see you.

1452
01:16:46,683 --> 01:16:47,453
It's all right, Cesar.

1453
01:16:47,453 --> 01:16:50,246
You can mention Marius
in front of me now.

1454
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:51,678
Panisse and I are
going to be married.

1455
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:57,393
I don't believe it.

1456
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,686
I believe it.

1457
01:16:59,686 --> 01:17:00,516
It's your mother!

1458
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:01,928
Ha, ha!

1459
01:17:01,928 --> 01:17:04,600
Your mother loves
Panisse's money.

1460
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,274
And she has sold you like a...
Like a little African slave!

1461
01:17:08,274 --> 01:17:10,306
No, it's not my mother's
decisions, it's mine!

1462
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:11,998
Well, it's my decision
that this marriage

1463
01:17:11,998 --> 01:17:13,770
Will not take place!

1464
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,732
And who's going to stop it?

1465
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:16,923
I am!

1466
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,384
I'll see you in church.

1467
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:19,455
Yes!

1468
01:17:19,455 --> 01:17:24,580
And my first word to you will
be, have a blow to your skull!

1469
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:27,613
I'll come right up to
the altar, and I grab you

1470
01:17:27,613 --> 01:17:30,797
By your stiff collar,
and I'll scatter you

1471
01:17:30,797 --> 01:17:33,129
All over the Rhone
Valley, do you hear?

1472
01:17:33,129 --> 01:17:35,191
Don't you bully me.

1473
01:17:35,191 --> 01:17:39,826
Or I'll tell you something that
would shut your mouth forever!

1474
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:41,948
Your bullying days
are over, Cesar!

1475
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,150
This is my shop!

1476
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,222
My name is Panisse!

1477
01:17:46,222 --> 01:17:49,165
And Fanny's going to
be Madame Panisse.

1478
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,988
And what's more, you
extinct rooster...

1479
01:17:51,988 --> 01:17:53,700
Panisse, be careful
of what you're saying.

1480
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,203
What's more, we are
going to have a baby!

1481
01:17:57,203 --> 01:17:58,054
Panisse!

1482
01:17:58,054 --> 01:18:02,979
And what's more, it's
going to be a 7 months baby!

1483
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,290
Panisse, please!

1484
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,392
And do you know whose baby
we're going to do have?

1485
01:18:06,392 --> 01:18:08,364
Panisse, be quiet!

1486
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:11,467
We're going to
have Marius' baby!

1487
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,329
That's whose baby
we're going to have!

1488
01:18:22,929 --> 01:18:25,291
You're a mad dog, and
you ought to be shot.

1489
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:30,676
This is the gun, shoot!

1490
01:18:30,676 --> 01:18:32,148
Put that gun down.

1491
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:36,572
But before you pull
the trigger, know this.

1492
01:18:36,572 --> 01:18:42,399
When you shoot me, your shooting
the father of your grandchild!

1493
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:48,654
You're shooting the husband of
your poor grandchild's mother!

1494
01:18:48,654 --> 01:18:49,355
Now shoot!

1495
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:01,758
At least you've murdered
that poor fellow.

1496
01:19:01,758 --> 01:19:04,500
Let that be a lesson to you.

1497
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,722
Fanny, you're not
going to do this.

1498
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:09,715
Oh, Cesar, if I have a
child without a husband,

1499
01:19:09,715 --> 01:19:11,577
My family will be dishonored.

1500
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:13,109
My mother will die of shame.

1501
01:19:13,109 --> 01:19:13,910
I'll write to Marius.

1502
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,821
He'll come back.

1503
01:19:14,821 --> 01:19:16,262
- He won't come back, Cesar.
- Of course he will.

1504
01:19:16,262 --> 01:19:16,963
Why not?

1505
01:19:16,963 --> 01:19:18,985
He's as happy as a
fish in water, isn't he?

1506
01:19:18,985 --> 01:19:23,689
That boy's crazy, measuring
the depth of the Indian Ocean!

1507
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:24,570
Ha!

1508
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:28,514
He's written to you twice,
he sends you photographs.

1509
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,137
Not a word to me.

1510
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:33,119
He's forgotten me.

1511
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,940
Ahem.

1512
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:39,816
Wh-wh-when... when people
ask me how much I'm worth,

1513
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,427
I usually lie to them.

1514
01:19:41,427 --> 01:19:43,549
I tell them 600,000 francs.

1515
01:19:43,549 --> 01:19:44,780
Ah, ha.

1516
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:49,375
Actually, uh, am I worth
one million and a half.

1517
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:52,859
Uh, I only bring this
up now because, uh, it

1518
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:55,221
Seems to fit into
the conversation.

1519
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,453
Well, it doesn't fit me!

1520
01:19:57,453 --> 01:19:59,025
I don't care if you
have a billion francs.

1521
01:19:59,025 --> 01:20:00,436
I'm not selling you my grandson!

1522
01:20:00,436 --> 01:20:01,357
Now come, Fanny.

1523
01:20:01,357 --> 01:20:02,178
Let's go.

1524
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:03,870
Let...

1525
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:07,583
Can you guarantee that
Marius will come back in time?

1526
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:09,946
Can you guarantee
the winds and tides?

1527
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:12,078
And be very careful,
Cesar, what fate

1528
01:20:12,078 --> 01:20:14,560
You decide for your grandson.

1529
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,055
The child of Fanny Cabernice
will be an illegitimate child,

1530
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:22,508
A shame and a disgrace
to her family,

1531
01:20:22,508 --> 01:20:25,741
But the child of
Madame Panisse will

1532
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:30,748
Be born in a wonderful old bed,
covered with fine linen sheets.

1533
01:20:32,748 --> 01:20:36,162
And the child,
Cesar, the child will

1534
01:20:36,162 --> 01:20:40,716
Be enthroned on top
of a family tree,

1535
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:43,829
Like a cross on
a church steeple.

1536
01:20:43,829 --> 01:20:48,824
Is that position too high
for your grandson, Cesar?

1537
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:53,249
No position is too
high for my grandson.

1538
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:56,122
But the son of Madame Panisse
will not be my grandson!

1539
01:20:56,122 --> 01:20:56,822
Uh!

1540
01:20:56,822 --> 01:20:59,815
Well, I couldn't
even brag about him.

1541
01:20:59,815 --> 01:21:03,429
I would have to smuggle
myself in here at night,

1542
01:21:03,429 --> 01:21:06,142
Pretending to be a
casual acquaintance!

1543
01:21:06,142 --> 01:21:08,314
Why couldn't the
child's godfather

1544
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:11,087
Come and visit him
any time he liked?

1545
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:14,710
Take him strolling
to the park, alone,

1546
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:18,424
Sport him around on
his shoulder, hm?

1547
01:21:18,424 --> 01:21:24,230
Mm, would, um, the
godfather be able to choose

1548
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,351
The child's name?

1549
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:33,699
If he has a... a knack
for choosing names.

1550
01:21:33,699 --> 01:21:36,432
How would you like
the name Marius?

1551
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:38,144
Marius Panisse.

1552
01:21:41,047 --> 01:21:43,169
It has a certain ring to it.

1553
01:21:43,169 --> 01:21:45,101
Uh, not much.

1554
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:46,913
I have a better idea.

1555
01:21:46,913 --> 01:21:49,525
An important man should
have three names.

1556
01:21:49,525 --> 01:21:52,368
Now couldn't we put a
third name in front?

1557
01:21:52,368 --> 01:21:55,151
For instance, Cesar.

1558
01:21:55,151 --> 01:22:00,757
Cesar Marius Panisse.

1559
01:22:01,757 --> 01:22:04,810
As a nickname, we... we
could call him Cesario.

1560
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:07,903
Now wait a minute, how about
that million and a half?

1561
01:22:07,903 --> 01:22:10,536
Would my godson
inherit all of it?

1562
01:22:10,536 --> 01:22:11,377
Naturally.

1563
01:22:11,377 --> 01:22:12,198
He'd be my son.

1564
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:14,620
Well, with my bar
thrown in, it would

1565
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,552
Come to almost two million!

1566
01:22:16,552 --> 01:22:19,085
Why, when our boy
will be 20 years old,

1567
01:22:19,085 --> 01:22:21,457
He could smoke cigars
as long as your arm!

1568
01:22:21,457 --> 01:22:22,648
Ha, ha, ha.

1569
01:22:22,648 --> 01:22:25,451
Of course, he would go
to the very best schools.

1570
01:22:25,451 --> 01:22:29,295
Oh, not only the
best, the most expensive!

1571
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:29,996
Naturally!

1572
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:22,228
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

1573
01:23:22,228 --> 01:23:23,729
Hurry, Honorine.

1574
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:24,720
Up!

1575
01:23:49,095 --> 01:23:50,096
Thank you, my dear.

1576
01:23:50,096 --> 01:23:52,078
Honorine looks beautiful!

1577
01:23:52,078 --> 01:23:54,070
To the bride!

1578
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,112
Cesar!

1579
01:24:26,112 --> 01:24:28,514
Cesar!

1580
01:24:28,514 --> 01:24:29,935
Hey, come at once!

1581
01:24:29,935 --> 01:24:30,636
What?

1582
01:24:30,636 --> 01:24:33,789
Cesar Marius Panisse
is getting himself born!

1583
01:24:33,789 --> 01:24:34,490
Oh!

1584
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:45,771
Oh you can stop running.

1585
01:24:45,771 --> 01:24:48,554
They won't let us
anywhere near her yet.

1586
01:24:48,554 --> 01:24:50,566
Is everything well?

1587
01:24:50,566 --> 01:24:52,318
The doctor says, yes.

1588
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:58,003
Dawn's breaking, Cesar.

1589
01:24:58,003 --> 01:25:02,148
The day and my child are
being born at the same time.

1590
01:25:02,148 --> 01:25:05,431
The beautifulest morning.

1591
01:25:05,431 --> 01:25:10,916
Cesario will arrive
to the sound of bells!

1592
01:25:31,357 --> 01:25:32,358
Ah!

1593
01:25:32,358 --> 01:25:35,351
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

1594
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:36,842
Ah, ha, ha, oh!

1595
01:25:47,313 --> 01:25:48,854
Oh, no, no, no.

1596
01:25:48,854 --> 01:25:50,376
She must have quiet.

1597
01:25:50,376 --> 01:25:52,988
Otherwise, I won't
be responsible.

1598
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:58,114
Doctor, I am Luique Anais
owner of the Cassius Lines,

1599
01:25:59,114 --> 01:26:04,820
Honorine's brother, and
the eldest in the family.

1600
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:09,975
I... I would like to see
her for just one second.

1601
01:26:09,975 --> 01:26:11,257
Yes, doctor.

1602
01:26:11,257 --> 01:26:14,129
He must, he's our eldest.

1603
01:26:14,129 --> 01:26:14,990
Oh, yes, please

1604
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:16,101
Please, Doctor, please?

1605
01:26:29,054 --> 01:26:30,025
He's beautiful.

1606
01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:36,882
I've seen you but
once before, and that

1607
01:26:36,882 --> 01:26:39,945
Was on your wedding day.

1608
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:44,960
Yet I talk to you as
one of the family.

1609
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:50,747
It is an honest
family, and a rich one,

1610
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:57,033
But it is a little sad, because
none of us had any children.

1611
01:26:58,033 --> 01:27:03,271
We would have all day taking
our name with us, but for you.

1612
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:10,688
So I, the oldest, in the
name of all our relatives...

1613
01:27:12,688 --> 01:27:17,583
Even those who are
dead and gone...

1614
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:22,821
Drove all night to tell you
of our inexpressible joy.

1615
01:27:30,105 --> 01:27:33,679
It's a boy!

1616
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,322
Thank you, dear sister-in-law.

1617
01:27:39,965 --> 01:27:40,666
Thank you.

1618
01:28:03,549 --> 01:28:05,541
There we are.

1619
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:06,542
To Cesario!

1620
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:08,724
To Cesario!

1621
01:28:08,724 --> 01:28:09,785
He's teething.

1622
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,467
Off to bed, it's about time.

1623
01:28:11,467 --> 01:28:12,247
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1624
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:14,490
No one carried him
but his father.

1625
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,392
Ah, ha, ha.

1626
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:17,933
Good night Cesario!

1627
01:28:17,933 --> 01:28:19,174
Oh!

1628
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:22,738
Who would have thought such a
quiet gentleman like Panisse

1629
01:28:22,738 --> 01:28:26,001
Would have produced
such a child?

1630
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:28,444
Must have tucked away a
little energy, some place.

1631
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:37,833
I propose another toast.

1632
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,124
Oh, no, Panisse!

1633
01:28:39,124 --> 01:28:39,825
Not again?

1634
01:28:39,825 --> 01:28:41,387
You're going to miss that train.

1635
01:28:41,387 --> 01:28:45,621
Uh, uh, Fanny will take
his temperature every hour.

1636
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:48,884
If it... if it goes
up, I'll come back.

1637
01:28:48,884 --> 01:28:49,585
Oh!

1638
01:28:52,978 --> 01:28:56,482
Incidentally, it's a
disgrace for Panisse

1639
01:28:56,482 --> 01:28:58,564
To rush off to Paris
on Cesario's birthday!

1640
01:28:58,564 --> 01:29:01,296
Here, here!

1641
01:29:01,296 --> 01:29:02,267
Just a minute!

1642
01:29:02,267 --> 01:29:05,521
I certainly think it's
no disgrace for Panisse

1643
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:08,674
To get that motorcar agency
for the whole of Rhone Valley.

1644
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:09,375
Right!

1645
01:29:09,375 --> 01:29:10,305
Yeah.

1646
01:29:10,305 --> 01:29:11,246
That's right!

1647
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:12,658
Shh!

1648
01:29:12,658 --> 01:29:17,453
As Panisse's mother-in-law,
I say, it's a disgrace!

1649
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:18,794
Oh.

1650
01:29:18,794 --> 01:29:23,959
As bookkeeper for
Panisse & Son, ha, I say,

1651
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:25,921
Don't miss that train!

1652
01:29:27,373 --> 01:29:28,333
Faster!

1653
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:29,294
Hurry, hurry.

1654
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:06,401
Papa.

1655
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:24,820
Oh, ho.

1656
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,271
You look good in this suit!

1657
01:30:26,271 --> 01:30:26,972
Oh, Papa.

1658
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:32,578
Goodbye, Panisse.

1659
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:38,183
Take these flowers to my wife.

1660
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,775
You take these
flowers to my wife.

1661
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:40,636
And tell her...

1662
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:41,336
Yes.

1663
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:42,498
Tell her I miss her already.

1664
01:30:42,498 --> 01:30:43,479
Tell her!

1665
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:45,390
And tell her I miss her already.

1666
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:46,602
Long live Panisse & Son.

1667
01:31:30,706 --> 01:31:32,908
What is it?

1668
01:31:32,908 --> 01:31:34,389
It's me, Fanny.

1669
01:31:34,389 --> 01:31:36,842
Don't be afraid.

1670
01:31:36,842 --> 01:31:37,833
It's Marius.

1671
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:45,170
So it's you.

1672
01:31:47,853 --> 01:31:48,554
I... I... I...

1673
01:31:48,554 --> 01:31:49,254
Don't bother.

1674
01:31:58,433 --> 01:31:59,975
Uh, sit down.

1675
01:31:59,975 --> 01:32:03,629
Will you have a... a
little glass of something?

1676
01:32:03,629 --> 01:32:06,251
Yes, if you and your
husband will join me.

1677
01:32:06,251 --> 01:32:09,024
Oh, my husband is...
My husband is asleep.

1678
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:14,740
Are you back for good?

1679
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,783
No, only for a few hours.

1680
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:22,027
The Malazee is in
dry dock in Sydney.

1681
01:32:22,027 --> 01:32:23,599
A French cruiser
brought three of us

1682
01:32:23,599 --> 01:32:25,561
Back with some
scientific instruments

1683
01:32:25,561 --> 01:32:28,624
That can only be
repaired in Paris.

1684
01:32:31,557 --> 01:32:33,589
I asked to be one to
three men in charge.

1685
01:32:36,141 --> 01:32:37,312
You were homesick?

1686
01:32:37,312 --> 01:32:38,013
Yes.

1687
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:45,926
Yes, for my... for my father,
for Marseilles, for everyone.

1688
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,362
Everyone.

1689
01:32:57,362 --> 01:33:00,886
You're not happy at sea?

1690
01:33:00,886 --> 01:33:02,527
If I said,
no I were not,

1691
01:33:02,527 --> 01:33:05,791
I'd look silly now, wouldn't I?

1692
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:09,094
I'm quite happy.

1693
01:33:09,094 --> 01:33:13,298
Did you see the isles
beneath the wind?

1694
01:33:13,298 --> 01:33:14,189
Yes.

1695
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:17,693
What were they like?

1696
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:18,984
Volcanic ash.

1697
01:33:33,438 --> 01:33:35,931
And you?

1698
01:33:35,931 --> 01:33:38,173
Are you happy?

1699
01:33:38,173 --> 01:33:42,487
I have a good husband,
and a fine home.

1700
01:33:42,487 --> 01:33:44,359
And a fine child.

1701
01:33:44,359 --> 01:33:48,874
Yes, a fine... who told you?

1702
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:49,574
Cesar?

1703
01:33:49,574 --> 01:33:51,076
Oh, no.

1704
01:33:51,076 --> 01:33:54,579
The Admiral had to tell me.

1705
01:33:54,579 --> 01:33:58,123
Funny my father never
wrote me about it.

1706
01:33:58,123 --> 01:33:59,314
How old is your baby?

1707
01:33:59,314 --> 01:34:01,997
10 months.

1708
01:34:01,997 --> 01:34:05,911
What else did the Admiral
say, about my child, I mean?

1709
01:34:05,911 --> 01:34:08,934
What else should he say?

1710
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:12,087
Is you son such a wonder that
every one must talk about him?

1711
01:34:12,087 --> 01:34:13,759
Well, certainly he's a wonder.

1712
01:34:13,759 --> 01:34:15,841
He's walking by himself now.

1713
01:34:15,841 --> 01:34:18,333
At 10 months?

1714
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,624
Do babies walk at 10 months?

1715
01:34:22,537 --> 01:34:26,141
Precocious babies do.

1716
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:27,953
All turned out
for the best, huh?

1717
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:39,344
Well, goodbye, Fanny.

1718
01:34:39,344 --> 01:34:41,827
Goodbye, Marius.

1719
01:34:41,827 --> 01:34:44,629
On your way back
from Paris, will

1720
01:34:44,629 --> 01:34:46,221
You be coming
through here again?

1721
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:50,956
We'll be leaving from
Cherbourg by a British boat.

1722
01:34:50,956 --> 01:34:52,928
Oh.

1723
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:55,891
They're fast, those
British boats.

1724
01:34:55,891 --> 01:34:56,882
Yes, they're fast.

1725
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,251
My regards to your husband.

1726
01:35:06,251 --> 01:35:11,246
I... I don't want to
disturb him, though.

1727
01:35:11,246 --> 01:35:14,169
Oh, lady!

1728
01:35:14,169 --> 01:35:14,890
Beautiful lady!

1729
01:35:17,682 --> 01:35:20,485
Beautiful lady!

1730
01:35:20,485 --> 01:35:23,608
We have beautiful instructions
from your beautiful husband.

1731
01:35:23,608 --> 01:35:26,802
Before he stepped onto the
train for Paris he said to us,

1732
01:35:26,802 --> 01:35:29,825
Take these beautiful flowers
to my beautiful wife,

1733
01:35:29,825 --> 01:35:33,468
And tell her that
I miss her already.

1734
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:34,249
Thank you, very much.

1735
01:35:34,249 --> 01:35:34,950
Goodbye.

1736
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:44,589
So Panisse is on
his way to Paris.

1737
01:35:44,589 --> 01:35:47,302
Why didn't you tell me?

1738
01:35:47,302 --> 01:35:49,014
Are you afraid of me?

1739
01:35:49,014 --> 01:35:49,795
No, Marius.

1740
01:35:49,795 --> 01:35:51,176
I'm not afraid of you.

1741
01:35:51,176 --> 01:35:53,058
Why didn't you write me?

1742
01:35:53,058 --> 01:35:54,669
You didn't write me.

1743
01:35:54,669 --> 01:35:57,112
I wrote five or six letters,
but I tore them all up.

1744
01:35:57,112 --> 01:35:58,143
Why?

1745
01:35:58,143 --> 01:36:00,345
Because you were happily
married to Panisse.

1746
01:36:00,345 --> 01:36:03,148
And that didn't
take long, did it?

1747
01:36:03,148 --> 01:36:04,639
Two months after I sailed.

1748
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:05,760
Marius, why don't you go now.

1749
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,953
Whatever you can say
now can be of no use.

1750
01:36:07,953 --> 01:36:10,485
Why did you marry
Panisse so quickly?

1751
01:36:10,485 --> 01:36:13,088
Why didn't my father write
to me that you had a son?

1752
01:36:13,088 --> 01:36:14,509
And how is it that
Panisse was never

1753
01:36:14,509 --> 01:36:16,181
Able to have a child
with his first wife?

1754
01:36:16,181 --> 01:36:16,882
Go away, Marius!

1755
01:36:16,882 --> 01:36:18,213
I bet that this
child was born less

1756
01:36:18,213 --> 01:36:22,647
Than seven months
after your marriage!

1757
01:36:22,647 --> 01:36:23,648
How do you know that?

1758
01:36:41,626 --> 01:36:42,627
I left you with a child.

1759
01:36:47,622 --> 01:36:49,124
Forgive me, Fanny.

1760
01:36:53,528 --> 01:36:54,329
I forgave you long ago.

1761
01:36:58,193 --> 01:37:02,968
You know, at first I
didn't think of your often.

1762
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:05,340
I was angry with you.

1763
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,885
I thought it was all
over with us, finished.

1764
01:37:09,885 --> 01:37:14,309
And then, little
by little it began.

1765
01:37:23,648 --> 01:37:28,103
At night in my hammock I
started thinking about you.

1766
01:37:28,103 --> 01:37:30,255
I saw you standing by
your shellfish stall

1767
01:37:30,255 --> 01:37:31,686
In your little straw hat.

1768
01:37:31,686 --> 01:37:33,598
I could smell the scent of you.

1769
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,720
Oh, Marius, stop.

1770
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:36,721
I saw you everywhere.

1771
01:37:39,704 --> 01:37:43,638
You only said you wanted to
marry Panisse to make me go.

1772
01:37:43,638 --> 01:37:46,131
Oh, Marius, no.

1773
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:48,423
You love me, Fanny,
as I love you.

1774
01:37:48,423 --> 01:37:49,124
No.

1775
01:37:49,124 --> 01:37:50,615
Yes, you love me.

1776
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:51,616
No.

1777
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,657
You love me, don't you?

1778
01:37:52,657 --> 01:37:53,358
No!

1779
01:37:53,358 --> 01:37:54,059
No!

1780
01:38:06,571 --> 01:38:10,906
Now, Marius, now my
children, don't do this.

1781
01:38:10,906 --> 01:38:12,807
Not here.

1782
01:38:12,807 --> 01:38:15,690
Panisse is a decent human being.

1783
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:19,754
Don't make him look
ridiculous in his own home.

1784
01:38:19,754 --> 01:38:21,636
Why didn't you tell
me the baby was mine?

1785
01:38:21,636 --> 01:38:23,378
The baby?

1786
01:38:23,378 --> 01:38:25,080
He knows, Cesar.

1787
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,243
Oh, that baby.

1788
01:38:28,243 --> 01:38:32,437
Listen, Papa, I
like you very much.

1789
01:38:32,437 --> 01:38:35,020
But right now, I can do
very well without you.

1790
01:38:39,274 --> 01:38:43,278
How well you say
that, Marius, Now one

1791
01:38:43,278 --> 01:38:46,861
Can see that, uh, you are a man.

1792
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:48,443
You no longer
respect you father.

1793
01:38:51,366 --> 01:38:53,959
But in the absence
of Fanny's husband,

1794
01:38:53,959 --> 01:38:58,693
You have no right to be
with Madame Henri Panisse.

1795
01:38:58,693 --> 01:39:00,575
Fanny!

1796
01:39:00,575 --> 01:39:03,348
Oh.

1797
01:39:03,348 --> 01:39:04,929
You missed that train again?

1798
01:39:04,929 --> 01:39:07,742
No, but in the sleeper
I met Dr. Sigarond.

1799
01:39:07,742 --> 01:39:09,364
He tells me, point
blank, that there's

1800
01:39:09,364 --> 01:39:11,526
A whooping cough
epidemic in town.

1801
01:39:11,526 --> 01:39:16,401
So... well...

1802
01:39:16,401 --> 01:39:18,403
You see, we have some visitors.

1803
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:21,806
Ha, ha, yes.

1804
01:39:21,806 --> 01:39:24,199
Marius.

1805
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:25,510
Good evening, Marius.

1806
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:26,691
Good evening, Monsieur Panisse.

1807
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:32,417
Fanny, don't you ought to
take Cesario's temperature?

1808
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:33,608
Oh, he's all right.

1809
01:39:33,608 --> 01:39:36,531
I just took his temperature.

1810
01:39:36,531 --> 01:39:38,233
So you're home now, eh?

1811
01:39:38,233 --> 01:39:39,344
Only in transit.

1812
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:43,318
Uh, a leave.

1813
01:39:43,318 --> 01:39:44,579
A long leave?

1814
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:46,241
That depends upon
you and Fanny.

1815
01:39:52,127 --> 01:39:54,419
I don't quite understand.

1816
01:39:54,419 --> 01:39:57,132
Fanny is my wife, and
the mother or my son.

1817
01:40:00,795 --> 01:40:02,247
It's not your son, Panisse.

1818
01:40:12,447 --> 01:40:14,449
For a long time
now, I've been trying

1819
01:40:14,449 --> 01:40:17,252
To go to Paris on business.

1820
01:40:17,252 --> 01:40:19,574
I've missed every train.

1821
01:40:19,574 --> 01:40:24,159
Every time I put my foot on
the platform I would say,

1822
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:29,294
This is the night
Marius is coming back.

1823
01:40:29,294 --> 01:40:33,128
What if he tries to
take everything from me?

1824
01:40:33,128 --> 01:40:36,971
For two years, I've been
preparing my answer.

1825
01:40:36,971 --> 01:40:42,241
And now that I see you standing
there so young and lean,

1826
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:49,954
I forget what I
was going to say.

1827
01:40:49,954 --> 01:40:50,835
Perhaps I'm in the way?

1828
01:40:50,835 --> 01:40:51,536
No, Panisse.

1829
01:40:51,536 --> 01:40:53,238
Yes, yes.

1830
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:56,631
Perhaps I'm in the way, and
the most gracious thing for me

1831
01:40:56,631 --> 01:41:00,805
To do would be to go out and
drown myself by accident.

1832
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,036
Ho, ho, ho.

1833
01:41:02,036 --> 01:41:05,560
Only, if
I'm dead, I won't

1834
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,042
See the little one anymore.

1835
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:11,906
And so I absolutely
refuse to drown myself.

1836
01:41:11,906 --> 01:41:13,428
Nobody asked you to.

1837
01:41:13,428 --> 01:41:15,340
I asked myself.

1838
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:16,040
And I refuse!

1839
01:41:19,053 --> 01:41:23,698
Fanny, if you want to
leave me and go away

1840
01:41:23,698 --> 01:41:29,404
With this young fellow, I
won't stand in your way.

1841
01:41:29,404 --> 01:41:32,877
And what happens to the child?

1842
01:41:32,877 --> 01:41:34,319
The child?

1843
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:35,870
Yes.

1844
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:38,163
The child?

1845
01:41:38,163 --> 01:41:42,697
But wh-why don't you
ask me for my eyes,

1846
01:41:42,697 --> 01:41:45,410
My heart, my liver, my spleen?

1847
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:46,511
No, no, Marius.

1848
01:41:46,511 --> 01:41:50,175
You will never get
the little one.

1849
01:41:50,175 --> 01:41:51,626
Never.

1850
01:41:51,626 --> 01:41:53,918
Marius, you are young.

1851
01:41:53,918 --> 01:41:56,921
You are able to
have other children.

1852
01:41:56,921 --> 01:42:02,227
But this child,
it's my first child.

1853
01:42:02,227 --> 01:42:06,141
My last child.

1854
01:42:06,141 --> 01:42:10,405
You see, Marius, if... if... if
he were just an ordinary child,

1855
01:42:10,405 --> 01:42:13,398
Like those children
you see in the park,

1856
01:42:13,398 --> 01:42:17,922
But this child is so unique!

1857
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:19,484
Cesar, tell him!

1858
01:42:19,484 --> 01:42:21,146
He's right about that, Marius.

1859
01:42:21,146 --> 01:42:24,219
Uh, mind you, you were
a beautiful child,

1860
01:42:24,219 --> 01:42:26,741
But, uh, this one...

1861
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:27,942
He coughed!

1862
01:42:27,942 --> 01:42:28,643
Hm?

1863
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:29,434
He coughed?

1864
01:42:29,434 --> 01:42:30,695
I didn't hear anything.

1865
01:42:30,695 --> 01:42:32,126
No, no.

1866
01:42:32,126 --> 01:42:34,379
No one hears him.

1867
01:42:34,379 --> 01:42:35,720
But I hear him!

1868
01:42:43,488 --> 01:42:47,392
He's a clever
man, that Panisse.

1869
01:42:47,392 --> 01:42:52,207
A very generous and
clever man, who says,

1870
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:55,340
I might give up the woman,
but I keep the child.

1871
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:58,633
Knowing that without the
child, the woman won't go.

1872
01:43:01,906 --> 01:43:04,539
But it's my child.

1873
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:06,010
I'm his father!

1874
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:08,633
No, Marius.

1875
01:43:08,633 --> 01:43:12,867
Before he was born,
you were his father.

1876
01:43:12,867 --> 01:43:16,781
But since his birth,
Panisse is his father.

1877
01:43:16,781 --> 01:43:20,615
Why, when this child
came into the world,

1878
01:43:20,615 --> 01:43:24,819
He weighed eight pounds
of his mother flesh.

1879
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:29,334
Now he weighs 23.

1880
01:43:29,334 --> 01:43:34,979
You know what those
extra 15 pounds are?

1881
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:37,442
Love.

1882
01:43:37,442 --> 01:43:39,814
Love doesn't weigh very much.

1883
01:43:39,814 --> 01:43:45,570
It's like cigarette smoke,
it takes a lot of love

1884
01:43:45,570 --> 01:43:49,213
To make 15 pounds.

1885
01:43:49,213 --> 01:43:52,797
I gave my share, and Fanny, too.

1886
01:43:52,797 --> 01:43:58,212
But the big weight, the
bulk, Panisse gave it.

1887
01:43:58,212 --> 01:44:01,105
And what have you given?

1888
01:44:01,105 --> 01:44:03,097
Life.

1889
01:44:03,097 --> 01:44:05,490
Dogs give life, too.

1890
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,883
And bulls give life.

1891
01:44:08,883 --> 01:44:11,526
Besides, you were not
looking to give life.

1892
01:44:11,526 --> 01:44:13,628
You were looking for pleasure.

1893
01:44:13,628 --> 01:44:18,483
And while you had your pleasure,
the baby took life from you.

1894
01:44:18,483 --> 01:44:20,695
Who is the father, then?

1895
01:44:20,695 --> 01:44:25,360
The one who gives life, or
the one who buys the bibs?

1896
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,983
The father is
the one who loves.

1897
01:44:32,697 --> 01:44:36,781
Fanny, tell him.

1898
01:44:36,781 --> 01:44:39,083
No, Marius.

1899
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:42,857
You were the father of
an illegitimate child.

1900
01:44:42,857 --> 01:44:45,500
A disaster to a family.

1901
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,873
But that child does
not exist anymore.

1902
01:44:48,873 --> 01:44:54,559
My child was born in a big,
fine bed, on old linen,

1903
01:44:54,559 --> 01:44:58,643
Attended by his grandmother,
his aunts, his uncle.

1904
01:44:58,643 --> 01:45:02,737
And you won't have
that child, Marius.

1905
01:45:02,737 --> 01:45:08,153
He's enthroned in my
family... Panisse's family.

1906
01:45:09,153 --> 01:45:11,336
So you're against me too?

1907
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:16,020
Oh, Marius.

1908
01:45:18,693 --> 01:45:20,405
Since your father is
here to protect me,

1909
01:45:20,405 --> 01:45:24,298
I can tell you I love you.

1910
01:45:24,298 --> 01:45:27,171
Perhaps more than I ever did.

1911
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:30,174
Every morning I see your
face in the smile of my son.

1912
01:45:33,358 --> 01:45:35,850
Oh, when I saw you
in that window,

1913
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:40,475
I felt as if I were
falling towards you.

1914
01:45:40,475 --> 01:45:43,237
As you used to feel you were
falling towards the sea.

1915
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:51,806
But there's Panisse.

1916
01:45:51,806 --> 01:45:56,501
The night the child was
born, before the doctor came,

1917
01:45:56,501 --> 01:45:59,914
I held his hand and
dug my nails into him.

1918
01:45:59,914 --> 01:46:05,049
And he said, bite me,
scratch me, the more you

1919
01:46:05,049 --> 01:46:09,033
Hurt me, the more the
baby will be mine.

1920
01:46:09,033 --> 01:46:10,014
He still has the marks.

1921
01:46:16,421 --> 01:46:17,392
So Marius, please go away.

1922
01:46:21,676 --> 01:46:26,120
If it's any comfort to
you, remember that there's

1923
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,645
A woman who thinks
about you every night,

1924
01:46:30,645 --> 01:46:34,789
And would like to lie
beside you and fall

1925
01:46:34,789 --> 01:46:38,863
Asleep in the
warmth of your body.

1926
01:46:38,863 --> 01:46:41,946
And wake in the morning
with your arms around her.

1927
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:55,660
Papa, what would
you want me to do?

1928
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:58,603
I want not to miss your train.

1929
01:46:58,603 --> 01:47:02,216
It's your child who
is sending you away.

1930
01:47:02,216 --> 01:47:03,958
Don't you like me anymore?

1931
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:04,659
Of course!

1932
01:47:04,659 --> 01:47:05,830
I like you, very much.

1933
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:08,222
Ha, you idiot.

1934
01:47:08,222 --> 01:47:13,598
Only you're big,
and he's so small.

1935
01:47:13,598 --> 01:47:14,939
Say goodbye to Madame Panisse.

1936
01:47:25,419 --> 01:47:28,402
Goodbye, Fanny.

1937
01:47:28,402 --> 01:47:31,375
Goodbye, Marius.

1938
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:34,849
I'll never love anyone but you.

1939
01:47:34,849 --> 01:47:37,331
I never did love
anyone but you, Marius.

1940
01:48:22,366 --> 01:48:23,938
Cesario!

1941
01:48:23,938 --> 01:48:26,400
Cesario, where are you?

1942
01:48:37,211 --> 01:48:40,174
Cesario, did you
hear what I said?

1943
01:48:40,174 --> 01:48:41,606
Yes, Grandmama.

1944
01:48:41,606 --> 01:48:42,827
All right,
what did I say?

1945
01:48:42,827 --> 01:48:46,030
You asked me if I
heard what you said.

1946
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:47,151
Hello, Cesar.

1947
01:48:47,151 --> 01:48:49,053
How is the?

1948
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:52,416
Oh, always full.

1949
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:54,118
But always empty.

1950
01:48:54,118 --> 01:48:55,039
Ah, come on, now.

1951
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:56,080
Now... now, forget it.

1952
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,523
Now we've got to make some
plans for our boys, today.

1953
01:48:59,523 --> 01:49:00,625
Hm?

1954
01:49:00,625 --> 01:49:02,997
What's outside that
window that's so special?

1955
01:49:02,997 --> 01:49:04,939
Hm?

1956
01:49:04,939 --> 01:49:07,972
Papa and Cesar are
planning something.

1957
01:49:07,972 --> 01:49:08,823
Uh-oh.

1958
01:49:08,823 --> 01:49:09,934
Oh, I know.

1959
01:49:09,934 --> 01:49:12,186
It's a birthday party
for me, isn't It?

1960
01:49:12,186 --> 01:49:12,887
Yes.

1961
01:49:12,887 --> 01:49:14,298
But you're not supposed to know.

1962
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:16,020
It's to be a surprise.

1963
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:19,904
I wanted to go to the
circus for my birthday.

1964
01:49:19,904 --> 01:49:22,617
He wanted to go to the
circus for his birthday.

1965
01:49:22,617 --> 01:49:25,349
So naturally, you
bring the circus to him.

1966
01:49:25,349 --> 01:49:28,953
Yes, with clowns, a
magician, and acrobats.

1967
01:49:28,953 --> 01:49:30,965
Oh, now, now.

1968
01:49:30,965 --> 01:49:33,708
Now let... let's go.

1969
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:35,009
Would it make you
feel any better

1970
01:49:35,009 --> 01:49:37,321
If I gave you
birthday present now?

1971
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,013
What is it?

1972
01:49:39,013 --> 01:49:40,454
Hm?

1973
01:49:40,454 --> 01:49:42,687
Oh, for me?

1974
01:49:42,687 --> 01:49:44,448
A... a telescope.

1975
01:49:44,448 --> 01:49:46,140
Can we see the
waterfront with it?

1976
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:49,704
Well, if we can't, I am
asking for my money back.

1977
01:49:49,704 --> 01:49:50,474
Oh, wonderful!

1978
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,912
Look!

1979
01:49:57,912 --> 01:50:00,234
Oh, the waterfront!

1980
01:50:00,234 --> 01:50:03,057
My beautiful,
wonderful waterfront.

1981
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:07,662
Why do we live so far away?

1982
01:50:07,662 --> 01:50:09,744
Ask your father.

1983
01:50:09,744 --> 01:50:10,444
Cesario.

1984
01:50:13,597 --> 01:50:15,369
Cesario, darling.

1985
01:50:15,369 --> 01:50:16,701
Mama!

1986
01:50:16,701 --> 01:50:18,222
Honorine, how are you?

1987
01:50:18,222 --> 01:50:21,846
Why... why don't you take Cesario
to the park for a few hours?

1988
01:50:21,846 --> 01:50:24,378
Or maybe she has
some shopping to do?

1989
01:50:24,378 --> 01:50:27,702
Please, Father, may we go
to the waterfront, instead?

1990
01:50:27,702 --> 01:50:28,402
Waterfront?

1991
01:50:28,402 --> 01:50:29,553
No.

1992
01:50:29,553 --> 01:50:30,945
Why not?

1993
01:50:30,945 --> 01:50:33,627
I've never seen
Cesar's place, or where

1994
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:35,529
My Grandma used to sell fish.

1995
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:36,560
I'd like to go there, myself.

1996
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,722
I...

1997
01:50:37,722 --> 01:50:39,233
Oh, no, the... the
waterfront is...

1998
01:50:39,233 --> 01:50:42,496
Is no place for a... for
a well brought up boy.

1999
01:50:42,496 --> 01:50:45,479
It was all right for
Cesar's boy, wasn't it?

2000
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:53,557
What do you know about my son?

2001
01:50:53,557 --> 01:50:56,210
Not much, except
that he went to sea,

2002
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:58,362
And that every time
his name comes up

2003
01:50:58,362 --> 01:51:01,956
Everybody sneezes, or
coughs, or something.

2004
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:07,952
Did Marius do something bad?

2005
01:51:07,952 --> 01:51:10,114
My son ran away from me.

2006
01:51:10,114 --> 01:51:12,777
Are you still angry with him?

2007
01:51:12,777 --> 01:51:14,689
I believe so.

2008
01:51:14,689 --> 01:51:18,062
I think it's how I'm
able to live without him.

2009
01:51:18,062 --> 01:51:19,483
Did you know him, Father?

2010
01:51:22,336 --> 01:51:25,269
Yes, I knew him.

2011
01:51:25,269 --> 01:51:28,182
Didn't you like him?

2012
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:30,835
Yes, I rather did like him.

2013
01:51:30,835 --> 01:51:32,676
Did you know him, Mama?

2014
01:51:32,676 --> 01:51:34,538
Of course.

2015
01:51:34,538 --> 01:51:37,641
I used to sell fish
next to Cesar's bar.

2016
01:51:37,641 --> 01:51:40,674
Marius and I grew up together.

2017
01:51:40,674 --> 01:51:43,187
Did you like him.

2018
01:51:43,187 --> 01:51:46,640
Very much.

2019
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:49,613
Well, if you all
like him so much,

2020
01:51:49,613 --> 01:51:52,016
Why can't we invite
him to come and see us?

2021
01:51:52,016 --> 01:51:53,617
Well, uh, we don't
know where he is.

2022
01:51:53,617 --> 01:51:55,740
Ha.

2023
01:51:55,740 --> 01:52:00,756
If I went to sea, would
everybody be angry with me?

2024
01:52:01,756 --> 01:52:03,427
Because that's all I want to do.

2025
01:52:08,132 --> 01:52:10,644
We'll tell you what you
want to do, young man, when

2026
01:52:10,644 --> 01:52:13,297
The time comes and we
are good and ready.

2027
01:52:13,297 --> 01:52:14,869
In the meantime, you
are going to the park

2028
01:52:14,869 --> 01:52:15,810
With your grandmother, eh?

2029
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:16,310
Come.

2030
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:17,011
Come on.

2031
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:27,521
Oh!

2032
01:52:27,521 --> 01:52:28,222
Oh, ho, ho.

2033
01:52:28,222 --> 01:52:28,923
Hello.

2034
01:52:28,923 --> 01:52:30,574
Oh, the waterfront!

2035
01:52:30,574 --> 01:52:31,275
Oh!

2036
01:52:31,275 --> 01:52:32,266
Oh!

2037
01:52:32,266 --> 01:52:33,257
Come on!

2038
01:52:33,257 --> 01:52:35,729
Oh, ho!

2039
01:52:40,174 --> 01:52:42,156
Remember that house there?

2040
01:52:42,156 --> 01:52:43,147
The house where I was born?

2041
01:52:43,147 --> 01:52:44,758
Yes, Panisse's shop!

2042
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:45,469
Now, come, come.

2043
01:52:45,469 --> 01:52:46,460
Come here.

2044
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,161
Look!

2045
01:52:47,161 --> 01:52:49,553
Mama used to sell fish here?

2046
01:52:49,553 --> 01:52:50,354
Yes!

2047
01:52:50,354 --> 01:52:51,615
Don't
you like the fish?

2048
01:52:51,615 --> 01:52:52,827
Well, it's the
best that we have.

2049
01:52:52,827 --> 01:52:54,208
I'm very sorry.

2050
01:52:54,208 --> 01:52:57,381
What kind of a way
is this to sell fish?

2051
01:52:57,381 --> 01:52:58,762
Honorine!

2052
01:52:58,762 --> 01:53:02,286
Oh, what a beautiful
hat and belt!

2053
01:53:02,286 --> 01:53:03,437
Oh, you darling, what sheik!

2054
01:53:03,437 --> 01:53:04,819
You're a vision!

2055
01:53:04,819 --> 01:53:05,739
Oh!

2056
01:53:05,739 --> 01:53:08,032
Honorine!

2057
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:11,335
Oh, Dorene, you've got
to insult customers,

2058
01:53:11,335 --> 01:53:13,577
Or they won't respect you.

2059
01:53:13,577 --> 01:53:15,089
Mm, look.

2060
01:53:15,089 --> 01:53:16,360
What's wrong with it?

2061
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,431
It's too small.

2062
01:53:17,431 --> 01:53:20,404
Well, massaging it won't
make it any bigger.

2063
01:53:20,404 --> 01:53:22,586
Ha, I'll take two.

2064
01:53:22,586 --> 01:53:23,287
You see?

2065
01:53:23,287 --> 01:53:23,988
Ha!

2066
01:53:23,988 --> 01:53:24,839
Give me that apron.

2067
01:53:24,839 --> 01:53:26,831
I'll show you how to sell fish!

2068
01:53:26,831 --> 01:53:27,812
Ah, ha, ha!

2069
01:53:31,715 --> 01:53:37,143
Mm, how I've missed this
filthy, smelly waterfront.

2070
01:53:39,143 --> 01:53:41,255
Oysters!

2071
01:53:41,255 --> 01:53:44,478
Muscles, beautiful sardines.

2072
01:53:48,472 --> 01:53:49,904
Don't cry.

2073
01:53:49,904 --> 01:53:50,604
Don't cry.

2074
01:53:50,604 --> 01:53:52,776
Oh!

2075
01:53:52,776 --> 01:53:57,551
Oysters, muscles,
beautiful sardines!

2076
01:54:00,524 --> 01:54:01,946
Seaweed?

2077
01:54:01,946 --> 01:54:03,407
That's right.

2078
01:54:03,407 --> 01:54:05,179
From the bottom of the sea?

2079
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:05,880
Yes.

2080
01:54:15,789 --> 01:54:17,301
Hello there.

2081
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:20,254
Who is this young
able-bodied seaman?

2082
01:54:20,254 --> 01:54:21,035
Hm?

2083
01:54:21,035 --> 01:54:21,735
Hm?

2084
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:26,770
Cesario Panisse!

2085
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,471
Yes, sir.

2086
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:29,053
How do you know my name?

2087
01:54:29,053 --> 01:54:30,424
Hang on.

2088
01:54:30,424 --> 01:54:32,306
All hands on deck!

2089
01:54:34,989 --> 01:54:36,080
I am your Admiral.

2090
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:36,780
Salute!

2091
01:54:40,084 --> 01:54:41,495
Follow me, march!

2092
01:54:41,495 --> 01:54:43,517
Brr rum pa ta bum bum bum.

2093
01:54:43,517 --> 01:54:45,299
Brr rum pa ta bum
pa ta bum bum bum.

2094
01:54:45,299 --> 01:54:47,331
Brr rum pa ta bum
pa ta bum pa ta bum.

2095
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:48,722
Brr rum pa ta bum pa ta bum!

2096
01:54:48,722 --> 01:54:49,433
Brrum halt!

2097
01:54:52,056 --> 01:54:53,627
There she is.

2098
01:54:53,627 --> 01:54:56,340
She's not much,
but, uh, she's mine.

2099
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:58,943
You've got a boat?

2100
01:54:58,943 --> 01:55:01,325
Would you like to
take a little sail?

2101
01:55:01,325 --> 01:55:03,357
Oh, I'd love to!

2102
01:55:03,357 --> 01:55:04,058
Good.

2103
01:55:04,058 --> 01:55:06,880
Only they're giving this
party for me tonight.

2104
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,482
Oh, we'll be back
before the party.

2105
01:55:08,482 --> 01:55:10,744
Come on, matey.

2106
01:55:10,744 --> 01:55:11,605
I'll pipe you aboard.

2107
01:55:11,605 --> 01:55:13,197
Toodle doodle
doodle doodle dude.

2108
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:13,897
Ha, ha.

2109
01:55:13,897 --> 01:55:15,379
Ha, ha, ha.

2110
01:55:15,379 --> 01:55:18,152
Now... now we've got to
shove off, like this.

2111
01:55:18,152 --> 01:55:18,852
There!

2112
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:19,543
Ha, ha, ha.

2113
01:55:22,316 --> 01:55:24,408
Yes, now... oh, man the oars!

2114
01:55:24,408 --> 01:55:26,010
We're going through!

2115
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:27,481
Ship ahoy!

2116
01:55:27,481 --> 01:55:28,812
Ship ahoy!

2117
01:55:28,812 --> 01:55:31,285
You want one pound
or two pounds?

2118
01:55:31,285 --> 01:55:32,066
You want two pounds.

2119
01:55:32,066 --> 01:55:32,756
Ha!

2120
01:55:32,756 --> 01:55:34,738
Ha, ha. ha.

2121
01:55:34,738 --> 01:55:36,710
Cesario?

2122
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:39,123
Cesario!

2123
01:55:39,123 --> 01:55:40,264
Cesario!

2124
01:55:40,264 --> 01:55:41,675
Ship ahoy!

2125
01:55:44,178 --> 01:55:46,170
Heave ho, my hearty!

2126
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:47,471
Heave ho!

2127
01:55:47,471 --> 01:55:48,172
Ha, ha!

2128
01:55:48,172 --> 01:55:51,665
Ha, ha, ha.

2129
01:55:51,665 --> 01:55:55,159
Lighthouse to port, ahoy there!

2130
01:55:55,159 --> 01:55:56,460
Panisse!

2131
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,161
Panisse.

2132
01:55:57,161 --> 01:55:57,861
What?

2133
01:55:57,861 --> 01:55:58,602
What?

2134
01:55:58,602 --> 01:55:59,303
What is it?

2135
01:55:59,303 --> 01:56:00,064
What's the matter?

2136
01:56:00,064 --> 01:56:00,764
Oh!

2137
01:56:00,764 --> 01:56:01,765
What's wrong with the old...

2138
01:56:01,765 --> 01:56:02,466
Oh, Panisse!

2139
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:03,897
What's she crying about?

2140
01:56:03,897 --> 01:56:04,858
Forgive me, Panisse!

2141
01:56:04,858 --> 01:56:06,630
I took him to the
waterfront and...

2142
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:08,182
The waterfront?

2143
01:56:08,182 --> 01:56:08,882
Where is he?

2144
01:56:08,882 --> 01:56:10,604
Oh, Panisse, he is lost.

2145
01:56:10,604 --> 01:56:11,305
He is lost.

2146
01:56:11,305 --> 01:56:12,546
Lost?

2147
01:56:13,247 --> 01:56:14,208
Panisse!

2148
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:14,968
Faint!

2149
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:15,669
Call the doctor!

2150
01:56:20,995 --> 01:56:23,337
A relation of mine went to sea.

2151
01:56:23,337 --> 01:56:24,928
A relation?

2152
01:56:24,928 --> 01:56:28,312
Yes, Marius, my
godfather's son.

2153
01:56:28,312 --> 01:56:30,114
Marius?

2154
01:56:30,114 --> 01:56:30,964
You know him?

2155
01:56:30,964 --> 01:56:32,316
But yes.

2156
01:56:32,316 --> 01:56:33,757
I see him every week.

2157
01:56:33,757 --> 01:56:35,289
Bring him news from Marseilles.

2158
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:37,121
I'm his newspaper, ha, ha.

2159
01:56:37,121 --> 01:56:38,372
Ah?

2160
01:56:38,372 --> 01:56:40,744
Wouldn't you invite
him to my party?

2161
01:56:43,137 --> 01:56:44,578
Yes.

2162
01:56:44,578 --> 01:56:45,809
Look, look!

2163
01:56:45,809 --> 01:56:49,143
There's a garage up
there where Marius works.

2164
01:56:49,143 --> 01:56:51,125
Ah.

2165
01:56:51,125 --> 01:56:54,098
Hm, you can
invite him yourself, huh?

2166
01:56:54,098 --> 01:56:56,870
Cesario!

2167
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:57,571
Cesario!

2168
01:57:18,872 --> 01:57:20,364
Hey, Monsieur.

2169
01:57:20,364 --> 01:57:21,825
Do you know Afique Wasou?

2170
01:57:21,825 --> 01:57:23,107
The Admiral?

2171
01:57:23,107 --> 01:57:25,889
I saw his crazy sail
in the bay an hour ago.

2172
01:57:25,889 --> 01:57:28,822
He was heading west.

2173
01:57:28,822 --> 01:57:30,284
Was there a little
boy with him?

2174
01:57:30,284 --> 01:57:31,535
Could you tell?

2175
01:57:31,535 --> 01:57:32,236
Hm?

2176
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:40,774
Hey, Marius!

2177
01:57:40,774 --> 01:57:41,475
Ha, ha!

2178
01:57:41,475 --> 01:57:42,816
Ha, ha, ha.

2179
01:57:42,816 --> 01:57:44,608
Hello, Admiral!

2180
01:57:44,608 --> 01:57:46,400
I've brought you a visitor.

2181
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,222
I hope you don't mind.

2182
01:58:02,966 --> 01:58:04,468
Ho!

2183
01:58:04,468 --> 01:58:08,442
Cesario Panisse, Marius.

2184
01:58:19,983 --> 01:58:21,155
Marius?

2185
01:58:21,155 --> 01:58:22,236
Cesar's Marius?

2186
01:58:25,038 --> 01:58:28,982
Aren't you going to
shake hands or something?

2187
01:58:28,982 --> 01:58:30,464
Yes, of... of course.

2188
01:58:43,297 --> 01:58:46,280
Oh, excuse me.

2189
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:48,432
It... it's just
that I haven't seen

2190
01:58:48,432 --> 01:58:51,545
Anyone from home in so long.

2191
01:58:51,545 --> 01:58:52,246
Is that it?

2192
01:58:52,246 --> 01:58:53,207
The one with the star?

2193
01:58:53,207 --> 01:58:54,168
Yes.

2194
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:56,119
Let's go, quickly.

2195
01:58:56,119 --> 01:58:57,050
He's here all right.

2196
01:58:59,943 --> 01:59:02,496
Why don't you come back
to Marseilles with us?

2197
01:59:02,496 --> 01:59:04,007
They're giving me
a party tonight.

2198
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,933
Oh, I'd love to.

2199
01:59:09,933 --> 01:59:15,550
But... but I'm... I'm going
to America tomorrow morning.

2200
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:18,272
To America?

2201
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,523
Yes.

2202
01:59:19,523 --> 01:59:21,825
Would you take me with you?

2203
01:59:21,825 --> 01:59:23,577
Take you?

2204
01:59:23,577 --> 01:59:24,798
Oh, yes.

2205
01:59:24,798 --> 01:59:28,061
I want to go to
sea, like you did.

2206
01:59:28,061 --> 01:59:30,644
You could teach me
all about the sea.

2207
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:40,774
Listen, once you leave home,
you'll never have another one.

2208
01:59:40,774 --> 01:59:45,148
But you love the
sea, and I do too.

2209
01:59:45,148 --> 01:59:45,849
Yes.

2210
01:59:45,849 --> 01:59:47,050
I love the sea.

2211
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:48,262
But what happened?

2212
01:59:48,262 --> 01:59:49,443
Hm?

2213
01:59:49,443 --> 01:59:54,358
Chief cook and bottle washer
sea at sea, jack of all trades,

2214
01:59:54,358 --> 01:59:59,416
A stretch in the army, a
third-rate prize fighter.

2215
02:00:02,416 --> 02:00:05,379
No, nothing lasted.

2216
02:00:07,921 --> 02:00:10,023
How would you like
a life like that?

2217
02:00:10,023 --> 02:00:11,815
It sounds wonderful!

2218
02:00:11,815 --> 02:00:12,516
Cesario!

2219
02:00:16,019 --> 02:00:18,512
Cesario!

2220
02:00:18,512 --> 02:00:20,874
Take me with you.

2221
02:00:20,874 --> 02:00:22,566
Please, please!

2222
02:00:22,566 --> 02:00:25,038
Take me with you.

2223
02:00:25,038 --> 02:00:26,520
Will you?

2224
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,001
Oh will you?

2225
02:00:40,864 --> 02:00:43,827
Panisse is dying.

2226
02:00:50,754 --> 02:00:51,735
Come on, I've got a car.

2227
02:01:06,129 --> 02:01:08,592
Remember, five
years ago the doctor

2228
02:01:08,592 --> 02:01:10,143
Told him he was finished.

2229
02:01:10,143 --> 02:01:12,526
He got so mad, he
got right out of bed.

2230
02:01:12,526 --> 02:01:13,226
Yes.

2231
02:01:13,226 --> 02:01:13,937
Yes.

2232
02:01:13,937 --> 02:01:16,019
Now, how can we
make him mad enough

2233
02:01:16,019 --> 02:01:18,502
To get out of bed this time?

2234
02:01:18,502 --> 02:01:20,924
Um, uh...

2235
02:01:20,924 --> 02:01:23,597
What if we asked him to
make a last confession.

2236
02:01:23,597 --> 02:01:25,419
That should make him furious.

2237
02:01:25,419 --> 02:01:26,650
Yes, yes.

2238
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:27,351
Speak up!

2239
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:35,018
It adds considerably
to the strain

2240
02:01:35,018 --> 02:01:38,382
Of dying to try and
hear what you're saying.

2241
02:01:38,382 --> 02:01:39,343
Who is dying?

2242
02:01:39,343 --> 02:01:40,324
Ha, ha, ha.

2243
02:01:40,324 --> 02:01:42,776
Who's dying?

2244
02:01:42,776 --> 02:01:45,719
Who's dying?

2245
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:51,174
It's not dying I mind, it's
giving up life that annoys me.

2246
02:01:53,787 --> 02:01:56,289
You know what I'll miss most?

2247
02:01:56,289 --> 02:01:57,861
What?

2248
02:01:57,861 --> 02:02:02,456
The little pleasures of life.

2249
02:02:02,456 --> 02:02:07,773
Lunch, dinner, looking
out over the old port.

2250
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:18,281
Panisse.

2251
02:02:18,281 --> 02:02:18,982
What?

2252
02:02:18,982 --> 02:02:21,164
Keep talking!

2253
02:02:21,164 --> 02:02:24,037
When you keep quiet
like that, uh, we

2254
02:02:24,037 --> 02:02:25,899
Don't know what to expect.

2255
02:02:25,899 --> 02:02:28,281
Don't expect me to die yet.

2256
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:29,983
Because I've not decided when.

2257
02:02:29,983 --> 02:02:31,184
It's not up to you!

2258
02:02:31,184 --> 02:02:33,547
You're not the one who's dying.

2259
02:02:33,547 --> 02:02:37,541
I'll go when it's time to
go, and not a moment sooner.

2260
02:02:37,541 --> 02:02:38,241
All right.

2261
02:02:38,241 --> 02:02:39,723
All right.

2262
02:02:39,723 --> 02:02:40,714
He's mad as hell.

2263
02:02:40,714 --> 02:02:41,995
Tell him about the confession.

2264
02:02:41,995 --> 02:02:42,696
The confession.

2265
02:02:42,696 --> 02:02:48,614
Oh, um, ahem, uh, just to
be on the safe side, ha, ha,

2266
02:02:50,614 --> 02:02:53,667
What a word or
two with a priest?

2267
02:02:53,667 --> 02:02:55,559
No last confession.

2268
02:02:55,559 --> 02:02:58,181
But you've got to
make a last confession!

2269
02:02:58,181 --> 02:03:01,475
Otherwise, the fat will
be in the fire for good.

2270
02:03:01,475 --> 02:03:06,219
That remark was in
extremely poor taste.

2271
02:03:06,219 --> 02:03:08,792
Well, I'm sorry.

2272
02:03:08,792 --> 02:03:10,504
But it was funny.

2273
02:03:14,518 --> 02:03:17,791
What would the priest ask me?

2274
02:03:17,791 --> 02:03:22,526
The Ten Commandments,
that sort of thing.

2275
02:03:22,526 --> 02:03:23,747
All right, I'll do it.

2276
02:03:23,747 --> 02:03:24,658
How do they go?

2277
02:03:27,861 --> 02:03:29,723
Thou shalt not kill.

2278
02:03:29,723 --> 02:03:30,654
Oh.

2279
02:03:30,654 --> 02:03:33,777
I'm in wonderful
shape on that one.

2280
02:03:33,777 --> 02:03:35,929
When I think of
all of the times I

2281
02:03:35,929 --> 02:03:38,091
Wanted to kill you and didn't.

2282
02:03:38,091 --> 02:03:41,354
Oh, I ought to get an
extra credit on that one.

2283
02:03:41,354 --> 02:03:44,688
Yes, we'll both get
promoted on that one.

2284
02:03:44,688 --> 02:03:47,671
And what's another one?

2285
02:03:47,671 --> 02:03:49,262
Thou shalt not steal.

2286
02:03:49,262 --> 02:03:52,966
Oh, now, these priests
have got to understand

2287
02:03:52,966 --> 02:03:54,868
That wh-when a man
is in business...

2288
02:03:54,868 --> 02:03:55,569
Ha, ha.

2289
02:03:55,569 --> 02:03:56,440
Now!

2290
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,662
Oh, oh.

2291
02:03:58,662 --> 02:04:03,997
Aren't we getting close to
the one about, uh, hm, hm, hm?

2292
02:04:03,997 --> 02:04:06,409
Yes.

2293
02:04:06,409 --> 02:04:10,123
How are your on
that one, Panisse?

2294
02:04:10,123 --> 02:04:13,026
Honorine, would you
mind leaving the room?

2295
02:04:16,279 --> 02:04:18,872
Oh, just when we were
getting somewhere!

2296
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:31,154
Now, don't make
light, huh, of this.

2297
02:04:31,154 --> 02:04:36,209
Fanny has always
been very fond of me.

2298
02:04:36,209 --> 02:04:41,886
But as for, uh, passion,
she never felt that for me.

2299
02:04:42,886 --> 02:04:48,211
And so, of course, I... I
respected her feelings.

2300
02:04:48,211 --> 02:04:53,967
And I have been very
undemanding, so to speak.

2301
02:04:53,967 --> 02:04:55,098
And so?

2302
02:04:55,098 --> 02:05:00,323
Ah, the devil... the
devil found in me

2303
02:05:00,323 --> 02:05:04,738
A good customer, if...
If you follow me.

2304
02:05:04,738 --> 02:05:07,991
He tempted you, you mean?

2305
02:05:07,991 --> 02:05:09,513
You might put it that way.

2306
02:05:09,513 --> 02:05:14,648
Excuse me, but, um, what
form did this temptation take?

2307
02:05:14,648 --> 02:05:15,549
Huh?

2308
02:05:15,549 --> 02:05:21,234
The form of one of
my lady employees.

2309
02:05:21,234 --> 02:05:22,225
Oh?

2310
02:05:22,225 --> 02:05:23,727
Which one?

2311
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:28,211
A car!

2312
02:05:32,195 --> 02:05:33,496
He's back!

2313
02:05:33,496 --> 02:05:34,197
Ha, ha!

2314
02:05:34,197 --> 02:05:39,651
Cesario and Fanny and... ho!

2315
02:05:47,651 --> 02:05:50,143
Will you go to
bed, you old fool?

2316
02:05:50,143 --> 02:05:51,645
You want to kill yourself?

2317
02:05:57,450 --> 02:05:58,151
Hm.

2318
02:05:58,151 --> 02:06:00,564
What's the matter with him?

2319
02:06:00,564 --> 02:06:02,005
Nothing.

2320
02:06:02,005 --> 02:06:04,367
Papa!

2321
02:06:04,367 --> 02:06:06,259
Papa!

2322
02:06:06,259 --> 02:06:07,961
Oh, I didn't know you were sick.

2323
02:06:07,961 --> 02:06:10,724
I wasn't really
going to run away.

2324
02:06:10,724 --> 02:06:13,066
Thank god, you're safe!

2325
02:06:21,805 --> 02:06:25,839
Oh, Papa, I went on
a lovely boat ride.

2326
02:06:25,839 --> 02:06:26,830
Do you know who's here?

2327
02:06:28,321 --> 02:06:29,623
Don't worry, Fanny.

2328
02:06:29,623 --> 02:06:30,483
I know.

2329
02:06:30,483 --> 02:06:32,916
It's Marius.

2330
02:06:32,916 --> 02:06:34,287
Yes.

2331
02:06:34,287 --> 02:06:36,539
Papa, could we ask Marius
to stay for the party?

2332
02:06:36,539 --> 02:06:40,043
Oh, no!

2333
02:06:40,043 --> 02:06:43,526
I mean, your father's
not well enough.

2334
02:06:43,526 --> 02:06:44,938
There won't be any party.

2335
02:06:44,938 --> 02:06:48,121
Of course, Cesario
will have his party.

2336
02:06:48,121 --> 02:06:52,826
Fanny, please, invite
him for me, will you?

2337
02:06:52,826 --> 02:06:53,827
Oh...

2338
02:06:53,827 --> 02:06:55,819
Please, Mama.

2339
02:06:55,819 --> 02:06:58,321
I like him, so much.

2340
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:10,003
Now, you go around the bed
and help me go on the balcony.

2341
02:07:10,003 --> 02:07:11,384
But, Papa, you mustn't.

2342
02:07:11,384 --> 02:07:12,806
Please, please, help me.

2343
02:07:12,806 --> 02:07:13,506
Please.

2344
02:07:18,241 --> 02:07:23,486
All these years
not even a postcard

2345
02:07:23,486 --> 02:07:25,228
To ask about my health!

2346
02:07:25,228 --> 02:07:27,771
How do you know I didn't
ask about your health?

2347
02:07:27,771 --> 02:07:30,453
I had news through Pierre.

2348
02:07:30,453 --> 02:07:31,344
Pierre?

2349
02:07:31,344 --> 02:07:35,238
Oh, you know, the one
with the squinty eye.

2350
02:07:35,238 --> 02:07:37,200
Oh, Pierre.

2351
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:39,012
Each time he would sail
a customer to Marseilles

2352
02:07:39,012 --> 02:07:40,153
He had a drink in your place.

2353
02:07:40,153 --> 02:07:40,854
Yes.

2354
02:07:40,854 --> 02:07:44,798
He used to look at me so much,
we called him The Watcher.

2355
02:07:44,798 --> 02:07:48,331
When he'd come back at
night I used to ask him,

2356
02:07:48,331 --> 02:07:50,083
How many customers
did my father shout

2357
02:07:50,083 --> 02:07:52,245
At in a period of five minutes?

2358
02:07:52,245 --> 02:07:56,079
And we had answered
three or four,

2359
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:58,481
Then I knew that all
was well with you.

2360
02:08:11,054 --> 02:08:13,066
Panisse knows you are here,
and he wants you to stay

2361
02:08:13,066 --> 02:08:16,669
Our son's... for Cesario's party.

2362
02:08:19,462 --> 02:08:21,474
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

2363
02:08:21,474 --> 02:08:25,058
Oh, but he wants you to.

2364
02:08:25,058 --> 02:08:27,861
Listen, I... I don't
resent Panisse.

2365
02:08:27,861 --> 02:08:29,402
Just looking at the
boy makes me know

2366
02:08:29,402 --> 02:08:30,663
How much he's done for him.

2367
02:08:30,663 --> 02:08:34,237
Well, then, stay.

2368
02:08:34,237 --> 02:08:35,328
All right.

2369
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:37,440
For a while.

2370
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,522
But I don't want to
hear a word from anybody

2371
02:08:39,522 --> 02:08:40,954
About the sacrifice he made.

2372
02:08:40,954 --> 02:08:42,445
What are you trying to do?

2373
02:08:42,445 --> 02:08:44,127
Who are you trying to hurt!

2374
02:08:44,127 --> 02:08:45,468
Your father?

2375
02:08:45,468 --> 02:08:46,169
Fanny?

2376
02:08:46,169 --> 02:08:48,681
I haven't any time
left to hurt anybody,

2377
02:08:48,681 --> 02:08:53,026
You... I'm leaving
for America tomorrow.

2378
02:08:53,026 --> 02:08:58,261
I'm sick of living in exile,
on the outskirts of my life.

2379
02:08:58,261 --> 02:09:01,674
And no man can say that I'm
putting on Panisse's slippers

2380
02:09:01,674 --> 02:09:02,575
While they're still warm!

2381
02:09:02,575 --> 02:09:03,406
Now listen, you!

2382
02:09:03,406 --> 02:09:04,107
You're still...

2383
02:09:04,107 --> 02:09:06,689
No, no, Cesar.

2384
02:09:06,689 --> 02:09:07,841
Let him have his bitterness.

2385
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:09,823
We took everything
else away from him.

2386
02:09:09,823 --> 02:09:12,095
Everything.

2387
02:09:12,095 --> 02:09:15,388
Oh, Marius, when
I sent you to sea,

2388
02:09:15,388 --> 02:09:19,152
I thought I was being
noble and unselfish.

2389
02:09:19,152 --> 02:09:23,016
But the truth is, I thought you
would turn at the gang plank

2390
02:09:23,016 --> 02:09:25,668
And coming back to me.

2391
02:09:25,668 --> 02:09:28,391
But you didn't.

2392
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,974
So then later,
Cesar, when we really

2393
02:09:30,974 --> 02:09:36,159
Should have sent for him, you
were angry, but I was too.

2394
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:39,552
And I took my revenge.

2395
02:09:39,552 --> 02:09:41,684
That's what I did.

2396
02:09:41,684 --> 02:09:44,567
I revenged myself!

2397
02:09:44,567 --> 02:09:49,192
Mama, Papa wants to see
you and Cesar, quickly.

2398
02:09:49,192 --> 02:09:49,893
Oh.

2399
02:09:58,491 --> 02:10:02,335
Would you like to
come and see the clown?

2400
02:10:02,335 --> 02:10:04,697
Yes.

2401
02:10:04,697 --> 02:10:08,001
Oh, Panisse!

2402
02:10:08,001 --> 02:10:10,934
Panisse, what are
you doing out here?

2403
02:10:10,934 --> 02:10:12,255
Look!

2404
02:10:12,255 --> 02:10:13,216
Stop, Cesario!

2405
02:10:13,216 --> 02:10:16,099
One, two, jumpy, oh!

2406
02:10:16,099 --> 02:10:17,060
Whoa!

2407
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:18,021
Ha, ha, ha.

2408
02:10:18,021 --> 02:10:19,462
One, two.

2409
02:10:19,462 --> 02:10:20,373
Whoa!

2410
02:10:20,373 --> 02:10:21,344
Whoa!

2411
02:10:21,344 --> 02:10:22,305
Whoa!

2412
02:10:22,305 --> 02:10:25,508
Ha, they look well together.

2413
02:10:25,508 --> 02:10:26,209
Whoa!

2414
02:10:26,209 --> 02:10:27,470
Ha, ha, ha.

2415
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:28,171
Whoa!

2416
02:10:33,556 --> 02:10:38,401
Fanny, I want to
write a letter.

2417
02:10:38,401 --> 02:10:41,334
Will you take it down for me?

2418
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:42,555
Yes, of course, but...

2419
02:10:51,564 --> 02:10:56,649
Dear Marius... go ahead, write.

2420
02:10:56,649 --> 02:11:01,224
This is a proposal of marriage.

2421
02:11:01,224 --> 02:11:05,408
Will you do me the
honor to marry my wife?

2422
02:11:08,201 --> 02:11:09,462
She will be free soon...

2423
02:11:09,462 --> 02:11:11,214
Oh, no, Panisse.

2424
02:11:11,214 --> 02:11:13,106
And I recommend
her very highly.

2425
02:11:16,099 --> 02:11:18,021
Oh, Panisse.

2426
02:11:18,021 --> 02:11:19,022
I cannot write this.

2427
02:11:19,022 --> 02:11:19,722
I can.

2428
02:11:22,755 --> 02:11:25,909
Go ahead, Panisse.

2429
02:11:25,909 --> 02:11:31,144
I will rest easier knowing
that she has someone

2430
02:11:31,144 --> 02:11:34,207
To care for her,
especially if it's

2431
02:11:34,207 --> 02:11:38,912
The one she has always loved.

2432
02:11:38,912 --> 02:11:41,324
I also feel that
my son should have

2433
02:11:41,324 --> 02:11:44,837
A father, even
though it's his own.

2434
02:11:44,837 --> 02:11:45,538
Ha, ha.

2435
02:11:45,538 --> 02:11:49,562
Ha, ha, ha, that's
good, he'll like that.

2436
02:11:49,562 --> 02:11:51,484
I hope you will
agree and not be

2437
02:11:51,484 --> 02:11:55,048
Stubborn like that old
rhinoceros, your father.

2438
02:11:58,291 --> 02:11:59,702
Why aren't you
putting that down?

2439
02:12:02,725 --> 02:12:04,988
I cannot spell rhinoceros!

2440
02:12:04,988 --> 02:12:05,688
All right.

2441
02:12:05,688 --> 02:12:06,819
All right.

2442
02:12:06,819 --> 02:12:07,520
Uh, leave it out.

2443
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:11,884
But it, uh, it kills the
style of the whole letter.

2444
02:12:11,884 --> 02:12:13,436
Go on.

2445
02:12:16,289 --> 02:12:18,861
Hastily, yours.

2446
02:12:18,861 --> 02:12:20,453
Now, let me sign it, quick.

2447
02:12:26,099 --> 02:12:30,443
Will you promise to send it
the moment the time comes?

2448
02:12:30,443 --> 02:12:33,586
You mustn't speak this way.

2449
02:12:33,586 --> 02:12:34,287
I love you, Panisse.

2450
02:12:39,672 --> 02:12:43,236
About the boy,
Cesar, will you mind

2451
02:12:43,236 --> 02:12:47,750
If you grandson keeps
the name Panisse?

2452
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:50,273
Of course not.

2453
02:12:50,273 --> 02:12:53,056
Thanks to you, there
will be others.

2454
02:13:00,463 --> 02:13:01,164
Woo!

2455
02:13:01,164 --> 02:13:02,665
Woo!

2456
02:13:02,665 --> 02:13:04,767
Hey!

2457
02:13:04,767 --> 02:13:06,869
Well, welcome!

2458
02:13:09,572 --> 02:13:11,074
Welcome!

2459
02:13:11,074 --> 02:13:12,275
Welcome, welcome!

2460
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:18,581
Welcome, welcome!

2461
02:13:21,584 --> 02:13:23,986
Ho, ho, Marius!
