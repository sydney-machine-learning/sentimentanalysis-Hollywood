1
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:09,236
Energy takes on many forms.

2
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:11,899
Example. What do we know
of acoustical energy?

3
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,536
It was discovered by a famous
scientist, right? Wrong.

4
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,375
We must give credit
to an Italian

5
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,939
who one night was singing an
aria in a Milano pizza parlor.

6
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,075
You know the story.

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:25,315
How he hit a high note and the
sound waves shattered a glass

8
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:27,322
on the other side of the room?

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,723
Watch me, and I will show you
acoustical energy at work.

10
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,667
Now, your next assignment
will be...

11
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,874
Oh, I forgot.

12
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,414
There'll be no assignment.

13
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:33,915
See you next week.

14
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,359
Here we are.

15
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:54,027
The beginning of the end.

16
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,570
Point of no return.

17
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:56,627
The last mile.

18
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,606
Now, Shelby.

19
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,199
All right.

20
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:05,308
"Of all sad words
of tongue and pen,

21
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,111
the saddest are these.
"It might have been."

22
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,550
Shelby, you promised.
Now stop.

23
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,315
Did I promise to
stop loving you?

24
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:14,913
Open the door and let me out.

25
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:17,050
Suppose he doesn't
show up this time.

26
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:19,185
Oh, Reverend,
how nice to see you.

27
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,753
You must be getting
tired of my wedding.

28
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:24,322
Third time's the charm,
they say.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,368
But I am glad that this time

30
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:28,427
you brought the bridegroom
with you.

31
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:30,699
At last we meet,
Professor Brainard.

32
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:34,004
No, this is Professor Ashton.
He's Romance Languages.

33
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:36,545
Professor Brainard
is Physical Chemistry.

34
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,877
Oh, dear me, I seem
to have made a mistake.

35
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,077
Not you, sir.
It's Miss Carlisle's mistake.

36
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:46,212
I've just been trying to
talk her out of this blunder.

37
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,723
Shelby, you are speaking
of the man I love.

38
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,589
Love, darling, is a bouquet
of fragrant hyacinths.

39
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:53,993
Not a beaker of hydrogen.
Am I right, sir?

40
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:58,329
I merely perform the service.
I don't take sides.

41
00:03:58,401 --> 00:03:59,333
Betsy!

42
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,802
Well, well,
here comes the bride.

43
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,634
- Reverend.
- Good evening, sir.

44
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:06,197
Professor Ashton
from Rutland University.

45
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,243
Aren't you on the wrong campus?

46
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,404
Miss Carlisle invited me.

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,970
Yes, yes, I remember.

48
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:15,347
There was talk that you were
a contender for Betsy's hand.

49
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,283
Rutland can't win them all.

50
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:20,447
Oh, it was so sweet of you
to go to all this trouble.

51
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,115
And for the third time, too.

52
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,386
Well, you know,
third time's the charm.

53
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,428
That's exactly what I just said.

54
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:29,465
I'm sick of having
a spinster for a secretary.

55
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:32,228
I better change.
The guests will be coming soon.

56
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:34,360
The bridegroom, too, I hope.

57
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,371
I've alerted his housekeeper.

58
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,202
She'll see that he gets here.

59
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,418
<i># The ring is in</i>
<i>your right-side pocket #</i>

60
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:54,951
Professor!

61
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,492
Professor Brainard!

62
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:10,002
<i># Square root of "E" minus "C,"</i>
<i>alpha "G" #</i>

63
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:18,973
No.

64
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:21,016
No, don't stop.

65
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,142
Don't stop.
Keep going.

66
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,948
Keep going.

67
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,818
Please don't stop.

68
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:39,696
Oh, not again.

69
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:40,463
Professor?

70
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,436
<i># Bum bum-bum-bum #</i>

71
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,097
Time for you to get dressed.

72
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:47,301
Just five more minutes,
Mrs. Chatsworth.

73
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:50,072
Professor, well, heavens,
what are you doing?

74
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:53,047
I'm trying to solve
the secrets of the universe.

75
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:55,379
And failing.
Failing miserably.

76
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,817
You're stopping.
Do you know what time it is?

77
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,946
You've been working
all afternoon.

78
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:03,048
Mrs. Chatsworth, I've been
working for three months.

79
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,183
Pardon me.

80
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,854
I've been working on
something very important.

81
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:10,387
More important, I suppose,
than getting married?

82
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:16,502
Oh! Mrs. Chatsworth, I don't
know what I'd do without you.

83
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,563
Oh, you're getting
a wonderful girl.

84
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:20,700
If you ask me,
she's too good for you.

85
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:23,711
Thanks, Mrs. Chatsworth.
I love you, too.

86
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,178
Don't worry about a thing.

87
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:27,910
I'll be in
in the morning to feed the dog.

88
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:31,442
- What's the matter with me?
- Is anything wrong?

89
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:34,513
What a lunkhead. Instead
of minus, it should be plus.

90
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,219
So, the molecular
configuration of "A"...

91
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,694
...is almost the same
as that of "B."

92
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,827
Therefore, if I don't
worry about "A"

93
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,735
throwing off free hydrogen,

94
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:53,400
it could stand
a few degrees more centigrade.

95
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:57,412
Remember, I promised that sweet
girl I'd have you there on time.

96
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,640
Yes, Mrs. Chatsworth.

97
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:01,774
And, Professor,
may I say happy honeymoon?

98
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,046
You certainly may,
Mrs. Chatsworth.

99
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,781
And the same to you.

100
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:10,554
Miscalculation has been staring
me in the face for weeks.

101
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,526
Can't see the forest
for the trees.

102
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,222
Right, Charlie?

103
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:23,099
All right, Charlie.
Cross your fingers.

104
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:39,110
Now. Good.

105
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:40,746
Good.

106
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,484
Very good.

107
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:45,186
182. That's good.

108
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,827
Yes.

109
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,799
Yes.

110
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,183
Now we're cooking, Charlie!

111
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,357
We may be in business yet!

112
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:03,328
It's just awful.
Poor darling.

113
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:04,998
What ails the man?

114
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,542
Missing his own wedding
three times.

115
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,100
He might still show up.

116
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:12,375
You know the old saying.
Third time's the charm.

117
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:15,576
I say three strikes
and you're out!

118
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,346
Thank you all for coming.

119
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,149
I'll return your presents.

120
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,416
I hope you can get
your money back.

121
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,479
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:24,856
After all the trouble
you've gone to.

123
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:28,055
I'll be at the office at
the usual time in the morning.

124
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,290
I want to go on as if
nothing has happened.

125
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,534
Shelby, I don't seem
to have an escort.

126
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,069
Would you mind waiting?

127
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,264
I'm yours to command.

128
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,345
Oh, Betsy.

129
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:55,253
Oh, hello, Charlie.

130
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:56,791
Go back to bed now.

131
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,884
Let's go back to sleep, hmm?

132
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,359
What happened?

133
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,011
What happened?

134
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,101
Well, that's the end of that.

135
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:38,718
Get away, Charlie.
Get away, Charlie.

136
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,349
I'm not sure what
we've got here, Charlie,

137
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:09,880
but if we've got what I think
we've got, we've got something.

138
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,722
There's one way to find out.

139
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,563
Ready?

140
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,657
Yes!

141
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,226
Yes, Charlie!
We've got it!

142
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,704
Do you see?
It's not going lower and lower.

143
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,638
It's going higher and higher.

144
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:29,442
You know what that means?

145
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:32,139
It means just one thing.

146
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,614
It's generating its own energy.

147
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:36,810
You know what that means,
Charlie?

148
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:41,286
It means we've discovered
a new kind of energy!

149
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,723
A new kind of energy, Charlie.

150
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,760
It's a breakthrough!

151
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,093
A breakthrough, Charlie!

152
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,534
Discovered. Substance "X."

153
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:02,941
In appearance, subscribes
to classical requirements

154
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,604
of metastable compound,

155
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,548
but whose behavior
is distinctly nonclassical.

156
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:12,644
Hypothesis. The application
of an external force

157
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,814
triggers a molecular change,

158
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,884
liberating energy
of a type previously unknown.

159
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,564
I suppose you think
these are just rubber balls.

160
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:26,567
Or maybe a flying rubber ball.

161
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,500
But you know what
this really is?

162
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,664
Of course you don't.
We just discovered it.

163
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:34,675
We've got to give it a name.

164
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,074
Let's see.

165
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,840
Flying rubber.

166
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:38,937
Flying rubber.

167
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:40,208
Flubber?

168
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,611
All right.

169
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:45,748
Substance "X."

170
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:53,091
We dub thee "Flubber."

171
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:57,423
If Flubber's going
to be of any use,

172
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,990
we've got to control it, right?

173
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:04,904
So, you take an ordinary
radioactive isotope.

174
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,168
Now a sliding shutter

175
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:08,801
to let the right amount
of gamma rays through

176
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:10,674
to bombard the Flubber.

177
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:13,442
Now, we put it under here

178
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:17,042
so that we can bombard
the Flubber with gamma rays

179
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,610
to trigger
the molecular change.

180
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:21,178
Which is more scientific

181
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:25,124
than kicking it
or bouncing it around the room.

182
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,660
All right.

183
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:30,722
Here we go.

184
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:42,910
Eureka!

185
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:44,172
It works.

186
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,180
Perfect control.

187
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:55,655
Now we ease off
on the gamma rays.

188
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:08,269
And back to Earth.

189
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:11,139
Light as a daisy.

190
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:44,395
Just as I thought.

191
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,002
Just as I thought, Charlie.

192
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,910
Weight makes
absolutely no difference.

193
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,914
Just shoot up
a few extra gamma rays.

194
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,109
Isn't that wonderful,
Charlie?

195
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:01,088
Professor!

196
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,817
Are you still here?

197
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,950
What about the wedding?

198
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,689
I can still make it.
It's 5 minutes to 8:00.

199
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:09,754
Yes, 5 minutes to 8:00.

200
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:12,130
In the morning.

201
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,066
In the morning?

202
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,699
No.
No, I didn't do it again.

203
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:21,869
I got to go and see Betsy
and tell her what happened.

204
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:25,141
I know what you're thinking.
But don't you worry.

205
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:27,045
Everything's gonna be all right.

206
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:31,676
When I tell Betsy what I've
done, she's gonna be happy.

207
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,252
Oh. Mrs. Chatsworth.

208
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,782
Don't you tell a soul,
but I've discovered Flubber.

209
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:43,653
That poor, poor girl.

210
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,495
Are you sure
it was wise to come in today?

211
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,434
I'm perfectly all right.

212
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:54,438
Mr. Alonzo Hawk, president of
the Auld Lang Syne loan company,

213
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,000
et cetera, et cetera.

214
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,943
My dear Mr. Hawk...

215
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,605
During the past few days,

216
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,014
I have been disturbed by rumors
that you plan to take our campus

217
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:06,612
and construct
a housing tract thereon.

218
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,680
Oh, surely he wouldn't.
Not even Mr. Hawk.

219
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,316
Let's hope not, my dear.

220
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,793
The situation requires
delicate handling.

221
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:16,160
But he's an alumnus.

222
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:19,359
My dear girl,
our esteemed alumnus

223
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,925
made an extremely large loan
to the college.

224
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:25,132
That loan is overdue,
and Mr. Hawk has us,

225
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:28,836
if you'll forgive a pertinent
expression, over a barrel.

226
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:01,806
However, my dear Mr. Hawk,
I am quite confident

227
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:05,608
that I can demonstrate
how an extension of your loan

228
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:08,275
would be in the best interest
to all of us.

229
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,581
I'd like to suggest a meeting
at the earliest opportunity

230
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:13,484
that would be convenient to you.

231
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:15,455
I shall make myself available.

232
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,786
Psst!

233
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,450
However, Mr. Hawk...

234
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,985
Don't be angry. I'm sorry
I missed the wedding again.

235
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,463
Look, I couldn't help it.

236
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:26,433
Of your loan
is in all our best interests.

237
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:29,493
Go.
Get out of here.

238
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:30,936
Don't want to see you.

239
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:34,908
I was working in the laboratory
and had an explosion.

240
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,639
Go.
Get out of here.

241
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,408
I do not want to see you.

242
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,678
I hit my head.
I fell on the floor.

243
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,878
I was knocked out.
Knocked out.

244
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:47,547
I know your heart is with us.

245
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,648
Go. Get out.

246
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,057
Look, the most wonderful
thing happened.

247
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:54,561
Wait till you hear.
Look.

248
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,722
Flubber.

249
00:18:55,797 --> 00:19:00,029
I shall make myself
available at any time.

250
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:02,332
Flubber. Flubber.

251
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,770
...of the greatest importance.

252
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,401
No, make that "of the most
supreme importance."

253
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,843
Flubber.

254
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:14,211
Flubber. Flubber.

255
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:17,583
Flubber. Flubber.

256
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,619
Flubber. Watch.

257
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:29,797
Oh. Good morning, sir.

258
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:32,527
I'd like to speak to
Miss Carlisle, if I may.

259
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:35,297
Betsy, I... Oh, sir,
I just wanted to tell her

260
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,395
that I'm sorry
I missed the wedding.

261
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,531
I have the most wonderful thing
to tell you.

262
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:42,202
The most wonderful thing
you can tell me is "goodbye."

263
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:44,472
In which I heartily concur.
This way.

264
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,570
Just a minute.

265
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:48,207
If you'd give me a chance,
she'd forgive me.

266
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,478
Anything you say
would be superfluous.

267
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,986
Kindly take your ball and go.

268
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,484
Daggett!

269
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,824
Why, Mr. Hawk.
What a pleasant surprise.

270
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:02,261
I want a word with you.

271
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:05,198
I, too, have been wanting
to chat about our loan.

272
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,531
- That'll be all, Brainard.
- Brainard!

273
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:09,968
Is this the one
you call "Neddy the Nut"?

274
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:11,767
Yeah, that's right, Pop.

275
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,276
Do you know that this man
flunked my boy?

276
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,209
No, Mr. Hawk.

277
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,509
I welcome this opportunity.

278
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,914
If the teacher and the parent
of the backward student...

279
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:23,951
Backward?

280
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,420
May I remind you it was Hawk
brains that founded this town?

281
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,047
Hawk brains that built it?

282
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,524
And you have the gall
to say that my boy,

283
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:34,289
who proudly bears
the name of Hawk, is backward?

284
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:35,921
I'd just as soon forget...

285
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:37,624
Will you shut up when I talk?

286
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:40,259
I wish I could show you
his examination paper.

287
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,132
Not only did he miss
every answer,

288
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:44,195
he misspelled
the name of the college.

289
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:45,762
Do you mind?

290
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:49,072
I'd like to discuss the matter
alone with Mr. Hawk.

291
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:50,771
This means my boy can't play

292
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,178
in the big game tonight
against Rutland.

293
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:56,240
Where's your school spirit?
Flunking your star player.

294
00:20:56,318 --> 00:21:00,254
I don't think this is a place to
lend a half a million dollars.

295
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,882
We have principles
here at Medfield.

296
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,256
I offered to help Biff.
A makeup exam.

297
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,919
But he couldn't be bothered.

298
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:08,257
So he's ineligible.

299
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,094
None of your vague promises
about lending money

300
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,394
is going to change that.

301
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:16,233
Mr. Hawk has already loaned the
money. The school is grateful.

302
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:18,932
Professor, I rejoice
in your sense of ethics.

303
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:22,340
But do you mind terribly
if I speak for myself?

304
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,969
- Mr. Hawk.
- Hold it.

305
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:26,309
I came to have my say,
and I've said it.

306
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:28,315
Mr. Hawk, a moment of your time.

307
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,283
I'd like to discuss our loan.

308
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,149
You'd like to discuss our loan?

309
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,688
Well, I have an office
downtown for that!

310
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:37,816
And you might bring some
of those principles of yours

311
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,726
and see how much they're
worth in cold cash!

312
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:42,320
Come on, Biffer.

313
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,898
Get me the file on wealthy
alumni marked "emergency."

314
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,437
- We have some letters to write.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:52,302
You've got to let me explain.

316
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:56,572
Then you'll understand
why I missed the wedding.

317
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:59,580
All right, go ahead.
I'd like that.

318
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:02,776
For once I would
really like to understand.

319
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:05,046
Like most things that
seem complicated,

320
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,088
it was actually quite simple.

321
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:09,715
I was thinking in terms
of magnetic energy,

322
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,692
when what I was after
was repulsive energy.

323
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:15,127
Silly. But you know how
you get carried away.

324
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:16,255
Yes. I know.

325
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:19,391
If not for this explosion,
I might never have found it.

326
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:21,333
The application
of thermal energy

327
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:23,997
to two incompatible
metastable compounds

328
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:27,200
brought about fusion,
the release of explosive gases,

329
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:28,435
and a residue.

330
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,341
Do you know what
that residue was?

331
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:31,310
No.

332
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:32,403
Flubber.

333
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,005
Flubber!

334
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:36,050
Well, it's been thrilling.

335
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:37,675
Now, if you'll excuse me.

336
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,811
Betsy,
never in my wildest dreams

337
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:43,085
did I hope to find a compound
whose configuration is such

338
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:45,820
that the delivery
of energy to its surface

339
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:48,362
would trigger a change
in the configuration.

340
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,831
This change liberates enormous
quantities of energy.

341
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,925
But they act
in a direction opposite

342
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:56,664
that of the force
which triggered the change.

343
00:22:56,738 --> 00:22:58,501
We call it repulsive energy.

344
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,234
That's just the way I feel.

345
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:03,243
Yet strangely enough,
the total effect is transient.

346
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:05,541
Upon the shutting off
of the energy,

347
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:08,606
the elemental particles
return to pseudo-equilibrium.

348
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,651
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes!

349
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,448
Now that I clearly understand

350
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:15,354
what happened to my wedding,
will you excuse me?

351
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:18,256
President Daggett and I
have some important work.

352
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:21,022
Such as, I hope,
saving the college.

353
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,463
But, Betsy, don't you see?
This can save the college.

354
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,057
It could be worth millions.

355
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:28,432
Do me a personal favor.

356
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:31,370
Go bounce your ball
somewhere else.

357
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:34,704
We'll talk it out tonight.
I'll pick you up for the game.

358
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,977
Well, I guess we shook
them up a little.

359
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:48,818
Nobody's gonna push us around.

360
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,414
You're kidding, aren't you?

361
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:51,891
About closing the college

362
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,793
and turning the grounds
into a housing tract?

363
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:57,127
I'm gonna teach you
some facts of life.

364
00:23:57,198 --> 00:24:00,861
Small college. Like the small
country store, little drugstore.

365
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,563
They're all in the same boat.

366
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:03,968
They're sinking.

367
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:07,236
Today is the day of the
supermarkets, the supercolleges.

368
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,176
The little man
is gonna get squashed.

369
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:12,440
But you graduated from Medfield.

370
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:13,947
It's your college.

371
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:15,277
So what do you want?

372
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,217
Some total stranger
to close it down?

373
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:22,882
Or some loyal, friendly alumnus
to take care of things?

374
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,789
Isn't there something
you could do?

375
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,726
Give them some more time
on the loan or something.

376
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:30,321
I'm sentimental about
Medfield just like you.

377
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:34,630
But it's like shooting a horse
that has a broken leg.

378
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:37,968
I want to do it
to put it out of its misery.

379
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,439
Now, if I happen to make
a few extra bucks,

380
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,408
well, that's just something

381
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:45,173
you're going to have to
learn to accept.

382
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:47,480
Yes, sir.

383
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,675
Oh, about the game.

384
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,446
Has word gotten around
that you're not playing?

385
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,646
Not that I know of.
Not yet.

386
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:56,748
Say, Lenny,
see what the point spread

387
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:59,123
is on the Medfield-Rutland
game tonight.

388
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:00,752
How much you want to go for?

389
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:04,458
Whatever the traffic will bear.
8,000 or 10,000 bucks.

390
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:06,295
You're not betting on Medfield.

391
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,768
Without me on the team,
we'll get murdered.

392
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:11,237
Who said I'm betting
on Medfield?

393
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:15,001
You're not betting against us?

394
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:18,068
Son, we have access to
some very valuable information

395
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:20,546
about that game tonight.

396
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:21,707
There's a saying.

397
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:24,343
"It's an ill wind that
doesn't blow a few bucks

398
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,582
into the coffers of the
Auld Lang Syne loan company."

399
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,487
Get the point?

400
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:31,457
When we pull down
the spark lever,

401
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:34,154
this shutter opens and
releases the gamma rays.

402
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,163
Up goes the Flubber
and the car.

403
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:39,928
We pull the gas lever, this
shutter opens, and the car goes.

404
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,992
We press on the brake,
this opens,

405
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,163
and the rays bring the car
to a stop.

406
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:48,300
If we open the shutter farther,
the car goes in reverse.

407
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:50,606
Charlie, suppose we get
a little tired

408
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,340
of just going straight ahead.

409
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,939
So we turn the wheel
to the right,

410
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:58,008
and we bank to the right.

411
00:25:58,086 --> 00:26:02,614
Turn the wheel to the left,
and we bank to the left.

412
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,659
Well, that's about it,
Charlie.

413
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:07,160
The important thing
is nobody finds out.

414
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,253
Except Betsy, of course.

415
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,825
So people don't ask questions,

416
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,358
we'll put this under the hood
so it'll sound like a Model T.

417
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,031
That ought to do it, Charlie.

418
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:25,542
Now all they'll say is,
"Professor, see you finally got

419
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,446
that old collector's item
in running order."

420
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,010
All right, Charlie.
We're all set.

421
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,957
All clear, Charlie.

422
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,674
Now we'll get your safety belt.

423
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,370
Now this side.
Good dog.

424
00:26:56,444 --> 00:26:58,708
Now... sound on.

425
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:02,211
Lights on.

426
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,843
And gas lever down.

427
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:10,219
Hang onto your hat, Charlie.

428
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:35,480
It handles beautifully, Charlie.

429
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,711
We don't need these
up here, do we?

430
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,811
There. That's better.

431
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:43,187
Now watch this, Charlie.

432
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,061
Not bad, Charlie.

433
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,966
Let's open her up
and see what she'll really do.

434
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:22,160
Yoo-hoo!

435
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,864
Well, look what we got
down there.

436
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:32,163
Look out, girls.
Here we come.

437
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,772
Look out, Charlie!

438
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:46,315
Gonna have to watch
where I'm going, huh?

439
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:47,911
Yeah.

440
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,488
Charlie, I've got an idea.

441
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:58,896
Why don't we fly over and drop
in on that certain someone?

442
00:28:58,967 --> 00:28:59,991
<i># Do-do do-do #</i>

443
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:02,298
<i># Do-do-do do-do #</i>

444
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,670
<i># That lovely, adorable</i>
<i>Betsy of mine #</i>

445
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:10,871
<i># Oh, won't she be happy,</i>
<i>sweet Betsy of mine #</i>

446
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:14,676
<i># When we take her flying,</i>
<i>that Betsy of mine #</i>

447
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:18,378
<i># She'll hug me and tell me</i>
<i>she's not really sore #</i>

448
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:23,015
<i># That lovely, adorable</i>
<i>Betsy of mine #</i>

449
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,037
Can you imagine what
she'll say when she sees this?

450
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:03,259
- Was there something you wanted?
- Yes.

451
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:06,323
I'd like to speak to
Miss Carlisle if you don't mind.

452
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm afraid I do, old man.

453
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:10,099
Miss Carlisle and I
are leaving for the game.

454
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,661
- Ready, dear?
- Yes, Shelby.

455
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:13,969
- Before you go...
- Excuse us.

456
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,442
Betsy, please come here.
If you don't mind.

457
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,376
I have the most wonderful thing.

458
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:20,437
Ned, I am trying
not to be angry.

459
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,073
Please, don't make a scene.

460
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,779
Haven't you caused Miss Carlisle
enough embarrassment?

461
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:29,016
Betsy, it's a surprise.
It's a sort of wedding present.

462
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,285
Just what every girl
dreams about.

463
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,419
It's not the car, Betsy.
It's what's inside the car.

464
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:38,090
I can't show it with him around.
Now, would you excuse us?

465
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:40,628
Betsy!

466
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:44,365
Betsy, you know what
I was telling you about

467
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:47,033
this morning in the office
about my discovery?

468
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:49,576
I want to show you
what I've done with it.

469
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:52,272
I want you to take one ride
around the block.

470
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:54,508
Just one little ride, Betsy.

471
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,040
How'd it go?

472
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:24,101
All the loot's down.
But I had to give them 6 to 1.

473
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:26,169
Get back on the phone.

474
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:29,410
See if you can find any more
of that kind of money.

475
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:43,792
I'm afraid it isn't
Medfield's night.

476
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:46,299
My dear, victory
isn't everything.

477
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,494
"To love the game
beyond the prize,

478
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,264
to honor while
you strike him down,

479
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:53,000
the foe that comes
with fearless eyes."

480
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:55,565
Excuse me.
- Oh. Professor.

481
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:56,940
Pardon me, please.

482
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:01,246
Late as usual, I see.

483
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:05,185
Come on, Medfield!

484
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:19,431
Hate to see you betting
against our team.

485
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,967
This isn't betting.

486
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,697
This is like making it
in the cellar.

487
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:49,858
Oh, if Biff Hawk
were only playing tonight.

488
00:32:49,931 --> 00:32:53,230
Yes, yes.
I heard he was ineligible.

489
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:56,930
Now, I wonder who could've
flunked your star player.

490
00:32:57,004 --> 00:33:00,735
We're much more realistic about
things like that at Rutland.

491
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:02,799
I understand you pay
your players

492
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:04,606
more than you do your teachers.

493
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,546
That's ridiculous.
I get twice as much as...

494
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:12,109
I really don't care
to discuss it.

495
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,427
Our poor boys.

496
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,229
They try so hard!

497
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:30,702
I feel sorry for people who
don't know when they're beaten.

498
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,636
Don't you, Professor?

499
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:35,141
Now, Shelby, please
don't start anything!

500
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:39,373
Why doesn't he go down
and sit in the Rutland section?

501
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:40,812
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:12,870
It's not fair!

503
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:15,939
Our team can't even
reach the ball!

504
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,819
Yes, poor little chaps.

505
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:23,448
I'd say they need
some kind of a lift.

506
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:25,424
Why don't they try
elevator heels?

507
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,085
Very funny.

508
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:31,763
Elevator heels.

509
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,322
Pardon me.

510
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,232
Would you pardon me, please?

511
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:57,753
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

512
00:34:57,825 --> 00:35:01,283
She won't ride in my car
with me? Okay.

513
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:03,796
She won't listen to me.

514
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,559
Okay.

515
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:08,295
So we're gonna
surprise her, Charlie.

516
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:10,929
More than that,
we're gonna Flubberghast her.

517
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:21,577
Boys, what can I say?

518
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,341
I'm proud of you.

519
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:29,553
They're murdering us.
But I'm proud of you.

520
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:32,115
Remember, you're
like sons to me.

521
00:35:32,193 --> 00:35:33,751
All of you.

522
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:35,796
How do you think I feel?

523
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:37,626
Do you think it's easy sitting,

524
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:41,361
watching you guys getting
your ears pinned back?

525
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:43,903
Well, let me tell you this.

526
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:46,098
I've coached a lot of teams
in my day,

527
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:48,607
but I've never seen
harder-fighting boys

528
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:50,337
than you boys right here.

529
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:52,936
You got heart.
I mean, real heart.

530
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:55,915
Coach, do we really have to
go back out there?

531
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:59,885
Look, I know how you feel, son.

532
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,854
But remember this.

533
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:04,720
A team that won't be beaten...

534
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,226
Well, Professor!

535
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:08,227
Oh, hello, Coach.

536
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,957
Something the matter?

537
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:11,862
Maybe something
on your conscience?

538
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:15,231
No. I just dropped by to see
if there's anything I can do.

539
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:18,466
I am sorry I had to flunk
Biff. If that's what you mean.

540
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:21,940
It's a little late for
apologies, don't you think?

541
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:23,670
One minute, Coach.

542
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,143
All right.
Get ready.

543
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:27,578
Starting lineup
same as the first half.

544
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:29,912
Too bad Biff didn't
keep his grades up.

545
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:31,542
That's one of those things.

546
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,315
Just remember,
one man doesn't make a team.

547
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:37,619
And I tell you, you can
go out and beat Rutland.

548
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:39,182
You can win this game.

549
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,420
Sure we can.

550
00:36:40,494 --> 00:36:41,552
Yes, you can.

551
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:45,065
Because I know something
about you that you don't know.

552
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:48,863
They're twice as big, but that
doesn't make any difference now.

553
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:52,303
They could be 10 feet tall.
We could still beat them.

554
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:53,704
Yes. We could.

555
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:56,766
You can beat Rutland if
you give it all the drive

556
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:58,311
and the bounce you've got.

557
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:01,143
Remember that word "bounce."
Bounce.

558
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,240
And when you bounce,
remember this.

559
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:05,012
No matter how much you put in,

560
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,554
you're going to get
twice as much out of it.

561
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:11,057
Now, get out there, fellows,
and hop to it!

562
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:46,986
Say, what's going on out there?

563
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:07,913
- What got into 'em?
- I don't know!

564
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:10,576
Maybe it was that pep talk
Brainard gave them!

565
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:14,212
- What did he say?
- I wish I could remember!

566
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,333
Go, Medford! Go!

567
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,103
Will you listen to me?

568
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,307
There's something fishy
going on!

569
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:44,112
All right. What?
You tell me!

570
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,517
Well, how do I know?
Something!

571
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:47,986
What am I supposed to do?

572
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:49,488
There's nothing that says

573
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:52,754
one team can't jump higher
than the other!

574
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:55,159
Time's up! Let's go!

575
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:09,203
Gosh, Pop. Look at them go!
Look-it!

576
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,642
I'm looking!

577
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:31,626
Come on, Medfield!
Come on, team!

578
00:39:56,156 --> 00:39:58,124
Come on, Medfield!

579
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,777
Come on, team!

580
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:31,188
Look at them go!
Aren't they terrific?

581
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:34,759
Sorry, Pop.
I forgot.

582
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:36,523
Come on, team!

583
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:24,975
Hey, what do you know?

584
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:27,605
Lenny just laid off
5 G's against Medfield.

585
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:28,807
Against Medfield?

586
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:31,578
Oh, thank you so much!
You meathead!

587
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:34,246
Don't you know what's
going on out there?

588
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,019
Shoot, Harper! Shoot!

589
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:24,068
Go! Go!

590
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:46,552
We did it!

591
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:47,821
Sure, we did it!

592
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:49,954
I did it because
you wouldn't listen.

593
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,588
What do you mean you did it?

594
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:53,462
You saw the way the boys played.

595
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:56,731
The reason they could play
like that is my discovery.

596
00:42:56,804 --> 00:43:00,069
Surely you're not taking credit
for Medfield winning?

597
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,072
In a way, yes.

598
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:02,665
Now I've heard everything.

599
00:43:02,743 --> 00:43:05,177
To watch those boys
out there fighting,

600
00:43:05,245 --> 00:43:06,837
playing their hearts out,

601
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:09,474
and to hear you taking
the bows for it.

602
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,778
I didn't mean it...

603
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:13,411
Pretty small, Brainard.
That's all I can say.

604
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:14,579
Pretty small.

605
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:17,146
- Come on. Let's go.
- Now, Betsy.

606
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:19,192
Betsy, wait a minute.

607
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,723
Shelby, please give me
time to think.

608
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:55,989
Of course, darling.

609
00:43:56,063 --> 00:44:00,591
You can give me your answer
tomorrow night after the dance.

610
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,431
I think I know what it will be.

611
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:05,267
Good night, my love.

612
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,034
Good night, Shelby.

613
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:41,572
You probably thought of me as a
kindly, level-headed professor.

614
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:44,372
Well, now you see what
a woman can do to you.

615
00:44:44,444 --> 00:44:45,672
I'm a desperate man.

616
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:48,306
Desperate men
do desperate things.

617
00:44:48,382 --> 00:44:50,009
Lights off.

618
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:53,678
Sound off.
And up we go.

619
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:40,722
Officer! Officer!

620
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:44,286
Officer, help me!
It's after me! Help me!

621
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:47,128
I do hope that you will
excuse my appearance.

622
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,761
But I was just having a cup
of boiling-hot coffee.

623
00:46:50,837 --> 00:46:53,237
- But it's after me!
- What's after you?

624
00:46:53,307 --> 00:46:56,003
I don't know.
Some kind of a thing!

625
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:57,668
A thing?

626
00:46:57,744 --> 00:46:58,972
Can you describe it?

627
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:01,606
No, I didn't see it.
But it flies.

628
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:03,616
And it made a noise.

629
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:05,982
Like aaoooga! Aaooga!

630
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:08,647
Then it banged down
on the top of my car.

631
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:09,746
Voom! Voom!

632
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,121
And when I looked,
there wasn't anything!

633
00:47:12,192 --> 00:47:14,057
Ohhhh.

634
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:16,152
That kind of a thing.

635
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:18,220
Suppose you blow
into this thing.

636
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:20,698
We'll see if we can
find where it came from.

637
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:21,563
Do something!

638
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:24,729
It's probably lurking in the
dark, ready to spring!

639
00:47:24,805 --> 00:47:25,772
Go on!

640
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,137
Don't worry.
We won't let it get you.

641
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,607
Now, come on, blow, okay?

642
00:47:29,676 --> 00:47:31,871
This is outrageous!

643
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:33,776
I happen to be Professor Ashton,

644
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:36,213
head of the English department
at Rutland!

645
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:38,148
And a very important
person there!

646
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:43,178
In that case, this ought to be
easy for an English teacher.

647
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:47,022
Can you say "Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers"?

648
00:47:47,094 --> 00:47:48,459
Have you gone mad?

649
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:50,018
Or perhaps you'd prefer

650
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:53,624
"Round the rugged rock
the ragged rascal ran."

651
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,634
I'll say no such idiotic thing!

652
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:59,103
We are not being very
cooperative, now, are we?

653
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:02,073
Come on. Blow into this.
We'd appreciate it.

654
00:48:02,142 --> 00:48:04,235
I'll do no such thing!

655
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:05,505
Blow.

656
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,069
Blow!

657
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:16,549
Having trouble, Officer Hanson?

658
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:19,183
No, just the usual.

659
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:21,921
We always have 502s
after the Rutland game.

660
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:24,930
Uh-huh. I didn't know
they were such bad losers.

661
00:48:24,998 --> 00:48:28,593
Brainard, tell these idiots...

662
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:33,230
Professor, I see you finally got
the Model T in working order.

663
00:48:33,306 --> 00:48:36,537
Yeah. It took a little fixing.
But here she is.

664
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,872
Hey...

665
00:48:37,944 --> 00:48:41,471
Sounds like it could use
a little valve job in there.

666
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:43,345
You know how it is
with Model T's.

667
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,147
Sometimes you swear they
could run without valves.

668
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:48,016
Or even without a motor!

669
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:51,285
- Well, so long, Officer.
- So long, Professor.

670
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,522
Brainard!
Tell them who I am!

671
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:57,859
Now, you told us who you are.

672
00:48:57,931 --> 00:49:01,458
Suppose we all go
confide in the sergeant, hmm?

673
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:20,819
You boys are a big comfort.

674
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:24,254
I take a bath for $ 15,000, and
you can't find what happened!

675
00:49:24,324 --> 00:49:27,054
Maybe they slipped them
some new vitamin pill.

676
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:30,324
If we can grab one of the boys,
we could give him a test.

677
00:49:30,397 --> 00:49:32,297
Forget it, will you?

678
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,832
Hi, Pop.

679
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,390
Did you find out anything?

680
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:36,800
- I sure did.
- What?

681
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,269
It was Neddy the Nut.

682
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:40,636
The professor?
Well, what did he do?

683
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:43,267
- He was in the locker room.
- And then?

684
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:45,106
Gave the boys a pep talk.

685
00:49:45,178 --> 00:49:46,907
Well, what else?

686
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,447
He just talked to them.

687
00:49:48,515 --> 00:49:49,777
Talked to them?

688
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,148
Is that the...
Will you give me that?

689
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:55,188
Is that the big news
you had for me?

690
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:56,381
Well, is it?

691
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:58,151
That's about the size of it.

692
00:49:58,225 --> 00:50:00,284
Oh, three cheers for you, sonny.

693
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,057
That's an Earth-shattering bit
of information you got there.

694
00:50:09,402 --> 00:50:11,768
Biff! Come here!

695
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:13,567
Come here!

696
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,870
You see anything?

697
00:50:15,942 --> 00:50:18,740
Just Neddy the Nut
flying his old Model T.

698
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:21,007
Say that again.

699
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:24,949
Neddy the Nut
flying his old Model T!

700
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:26,508
Yeah!

701
00:50:26,586 --> 00:50:29,953
And that's the genius
you were calling a nut!

702
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:32,617
Oh, yeah. In class,
he's been beating our ears

703
00:50:32,692 --> 00:50:34,387
about some new kind of energy.

704
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:36,725
Says he's looking
for a breakthrough.

705
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:38,787
Breakthrough?

706
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:45,031
Have you any idea what
that kind of jazz is worth?

707
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,439
Gentlemen to see you,
Professor.

708
00:50:57,517 --> 00:51:00,042
I can't see anybody now.
What does he want?

709
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,611
Your kind indulgence,
Professor.

710
00:51:02,689 --> 00:51:06,090
Can you find it to forgive
this hot-blooded businessman?

711
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,720
Hot-blooded businessman who
plans to tear down Medfield?

712
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:10,990
What do you want?

713
00:51:11,064 --> 00:51:12,497
Wonderful things.

714
00:51:12,566 --> 00:51:14,796
Wonderful things for all of us.

715
00:51:14,868 --> 00:51:18,429
Visualize, if you will,
a whole new Medfield College.

716
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:20,496
10 new buildings
10 stories high.

717
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:24,066
One building devoted
entirely to science.

718
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:27,136
Two, if you will?

719
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:29,279
Three?

720
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:32,284
How does that sound?

721
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:34,149
It sounds great.

722
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:38,920
But just where is all this money
coming from, Mr. Hawk?

723
00:51:38,992 --> 00:51:43,361
From a certain
revolutionary discovery.

724
00:51:44,564 --> 00:51:46,794
What's revolutionary
about a Tin Lizzie?

725
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:48,527
Nothing.

726
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:52,402
Unless, of course,
it happens to fly.

727
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:55,901
Fly?

728
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:59,002
Like I happened
to see it do last night.

729
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,511
You saw it, huh?

730
00:52:02,582 --> 00:52:03,810
Uh-huh.

731
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,879
Prof, I gotta hand it to you.

732
00:52:06,953 --> 00:52:09,581
Hold it!

733
00:52:09,656 --> 00:52:11,556
Why don't we trust each other?

734
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,923
You're a man of science.
Head in the clouds.

735
00:52:13,994 --> 00:52:15,985
I'm a down-to-Earth,
dollar-and-cents man.

736
00:52:16,062 --> 00:52:18,428
My pop always says
he can smell a buck...

737
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:21,467
I'll do the talking, son!

738
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:22,592
That's a good boy.

739
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:24,227
There's a million angles.

740
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:26,397
The government.
The space age!

741
00:52:26,473 --> 00:52:28,907
What they wouldn't give
to get their hands

742
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:31,375
on this little Tin Lizzie.

743
00:52:31,444 --> 00:52:33,173
That's where I come in.

744
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:36,875
When I get through talking
with them, they'll come crawling

745
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,076
with bags of money.

746
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:40,619
Barrels of money!

747
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:42,814
Mr. Hawk,
let me get this straight.

748
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:45,119
You want me to turn
my discovery over

749
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:47,682
so you can blackmail
our government?

750
00:52:47,761 --> 00:52:49,558
All right,
look at it this way.

751
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:52,359
Medfield College
can grow and prosper.

752
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:56,869
Or it can wither
and die on the vine.

753
00:52:56,936 --> 00:52:58,733
That's entirely up to you.

754
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:03,299
I see. Mr. Hawk, I want to
thank you for dropping by.

755
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:04,866
You've made up my mind.

756
00:53:04,944 --> 00:53:06,935
Now you're talking!

757
00:53:07,013 --> 00:53:08,446
I'm calling the President.

758
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:12,042
Daggett?
He don't cut any ice.

759
00:53:12,118 --> 00:53:14,018
The President
of the United States.

760
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:15,748
Is that enough ice for you?

761
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:18,518
Oh, let's not go flying off
in all directions.

762
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:20,388
Just one direction. Out.

763
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,859
Oh, don't get me wrong.

764
00:53:21,928 --> 00:53:24,624
I heartily endorse
our government.

765
00:53:24,698 --> 00:53:27,690
All right. You're lowering
the boom on Medfield.

766
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:30,235
But don't you try
to come back afterwards.

767
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:32,134
The iron door is shut!

768
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,838
Well, there goes the ball game.

769
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:42,506
He'll telephone Washington.

770
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:45,847
By tomorrow, this place will be
swarming with sharpies.

771
00:53:45,919 --> 00:53:48,615
Supposing you did get
the professor's discovery.

772
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:50,553
Did you mean
not closing Medfield?

773
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:54,650
They get that flying jalopy,
there's millions down the drain!

774
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:56,696
If you did, I've got an idea.

775
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:59,231
- Quiet. I'm trying to think.
- Switch cars.

776
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:02,291
That idiot Brainard.
If he could've...

777
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:07,739
What did you say, son?

778
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:08,865
Switch cars on him.

779
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:11,206
There are other
Model T's around.

780
00:54:11,277 --> 00:54:13,802
Yeah, there are,
aren't there, Biffer?

781
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,212
Fellow in Appleton
who's got the same model.

782
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:18,182
Hold it.
I'm way ahead of you.

783
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:20,719
Lenny, take
the Appleton turnoff.

784
00:54:21,888 --> 00:54:23,981
Hey, you know something?

785
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:26,150
You're all right, son.

786
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,388
Course, you got a little
of your mother in you.

787
00:54:29,462 --> 00:54:32,226
Actually, well,
you're just me all over again!

788
00:54:32,298 --> 00:54:33,265
Yes, sir!

789
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,426
You're all right!

790
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:45,634
I can assure you the President
is interested in any development

791
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:48,704
which might have to do
with our national welfare.

792
00:54:48,782 --> 00:54:52,479
May I inquire as to
the nature of your discovery?

793
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:56,079
Flubber?

794
00:54:56,156 --> 00:54:59,182
Yes, that does
sound significant.

795
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:02,422
Now, if I only knew which
branch of the government

796
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:04,929
might best be served
by your discovery?

797
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:06,465
Any branch.
You name it.

798
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:08,660
Transportation. Industry.
Agriculture.

799
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:10,327
Agriculture?

800
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:11,961
Good.

801
00:55:12,038 --> 00:55:13,835
Oh, don't cut me off.

802
00:55:13,907 --> 00:55:17,843
Agriculture Department.
Sam Wheeler speaking.

803
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:19,936
Splendid.

804
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:21,674
Mmm. I see.

805
00:55:21,748 --> 00:55:24,148
How do you figure
this can help the farmer?

806
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,980
I don't want to help
the farmer.

807
00:55:26,052 --> 00:55:28,520
I want to help everybody!
Don't you understand?

808
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:32,251
What possibilities do you think
this might have as a fertilizer?

809
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:34,122
Fertilizer?

810
00:55:34,194 --> 00:55:37,595
Don't you people understand
how vital this thing is?

811
00:55:37,664 --> 00:55:39,495
It's not only agriculture.

812
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:41,625
It's industry.
It's national defense.

813
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:43,828
Oh, national defense.

814
00:55:43,903 --> 00:55:45,928
National defense.

815
00:55:51,344 --> 00:55:53,938
Before we go further,
I just want you to know

816
00:55:54,013 --> 00:55:56,982
that I am proud of the new
spirit of cooperation

817
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,076
between the Army, the Navy,
and the Air Force.

818
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,587
Even the newspapers
are talking about it.

819
00:56:02,655 --> 00:56:04,953
There never was any
difference between us.

820
00:56:05,024 --> 00:56:07,117
Just newspaper guff
in the first place.

821
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:10,993
There's a Professor Brainard
on the phone from Medfield.

822
00:56:11,064 --> 00:56:13,532
I don't know any
Professor Brainard.

823
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,897
Tell him to write me.

824
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:18,768
He might have some connection
with Congressman Brainard.

825
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:20,931
Brainard swings a lot of lead.

826
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:23,771
He's always been
very friendly to us.

827
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:25,504
Very well.

828
00:56:26,446 --> 00:56:27,970
Hello?

829
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:30,072
Well, how are you,
Professor?

830
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:32,140
What can we do for you?

831
00:56:33,253 --> 00:56:35,380
Oh, you have, eh?

832
00:56:35,455 --> 00:56:36,854
Why, that's amazing.

833
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:40,017
Sort of antigravity.

834
00:56:40,093 --> 00:56:41,993
Well, well.

835
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:45,189
And you think
it's a breakthrough?

836
00:56:45,265 --> 00:56:48,894
Looks like you don't need
all that appropriation money.

837
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:52,131
Got a fellow said he cracked
the antigravity problem

838
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:54,298
in his own garage.

839
00:56:54,374 --> 00:56:55,466
Ridiculous.

840
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,237
Another crackpot.

841
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,404
Army's been doing
antigravity research for years.

842
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,846
Hasn't come up with
anything significant.

843
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,713
Oh, yes.
Yes, Professor.

844
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:07,218
I'm listening.
Yes, Professor.

845
00:57:07,287 --> 00:57:10,051
Yes, yes.
I realize it's urgent.

846
00:57:10,123 --> 00:57:12,523
So many things are these days.

847
00:57:12,592 --> 00:57:15,857
Oh? You want to come
down here to Washington?

848
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:17,897
Well, now, I don't
know about that.

849
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:19,727
We'd love to see you,
of course.

850
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:21,664
Alert my pilot to standby.

851
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:25,067
Yes, but we're all busy
as bird dogs around here.

852
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:26,628
I tell you what, Professor.

853
00:57:26,706 --> 00:57:30,904
Why don't you write us
a nice, short letter?

854
00:57:30,977 --> 00:57:33,002
Tell us all about it.

855
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:36,048
Right. And keep up
the good work, Professor.

856
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:37,446
Call us any time.

857
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:40,577
Oh, better still,
we'll call you.

858
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:42,280
Goodbye.

859
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:43,787
Goodbye.

860
00:57:43,856 --> 00:57:45,380
They won't listen.

861
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,652
Betsy won't listen.

862
00:57:46,726 --> 00:57:49,217
Hawk is the only one
that will believe me.

863
00:57:49,295 --> 00:57:50,489
Professor?

864
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:52,497
Come in, Mrs. Chatsworth.

865
00:57:52,565 --> 00:57:55,796
There you are. Sponged and
pressed for the dance tonight.

866
00:57:55,868 --> 00:57:58,393
Thank you. But I won't
be going to the dance.

867
00:57:58,471 --> 00:58:02,567
Oh, no. You're not letting that
sweet girl go with someone else?

868
00:58:02,642 --> 00:58:05,406
That sweet girl has kicked me
out of her life.

869
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:08,379
What are you gonna do?
Stay home, talk to the dog?

870
00:58:08,448 --> 00:58:10,814
Mrs. Chatsworth,
don't turn against me.

871
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:13,215
Professor, may I say something?

872
00:58:13,286 --> 00:58:16,084
I'd rather you wouldn't.
Not just now.

873
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:18,555
All right.
Do as you please.

874
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:20,286
Go with your head
in the clouds

875
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,227
and your nose poked places
it doesn't belong.

876
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:24,763
Go ahead, like I said.

877
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:26,822
Unlock the secrets
of the universe.

878
00:58:26,899 --> 00:58:28,491
But remember this.

879
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:32,265
The universe is millions
and millions of years old.

880
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:36,365
It can wait a little.
But girls can't wait.

881
00:58:36,442 --> 00:58:38,410
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I'm not going...

882
00:58:38,478 --> 00:58:43,939
One day, a girl simply says
to herself, "That's enough.

883
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:47,145
I'll just marry the next man
that comes along."

884
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,915
And she does.

885
00:58:48,988 --> 00:58:51,320
- Mrs. Chatsworth...
- lf I were in your shoes,

886
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:54,121
I'd stop that smashing
or mashing the atom

887
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:58,027
or whatever it is you're doing,
and I'd go to that dance.

888
00:58:58,097 --> 00:59:00,429
Why? Betsy won't
even look at me.

889
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,161
Don't they have those numbers

890
00:59:02,235 --> 00:59:04,533
where you tap the dancers
on the shoulders?

891
00:59:04,604 --> 00:59:05,571
Yes, I suppose.

892
00:59:05,638 --> 00:59:07,902
Well, then,
you walk up to that Shelby,

893
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:10,704
tap him on the shoulder,
then when he turns.

894
00:59:10,777 --> 00:59:11,709
I'll punch him.

895
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:12,972
Good.

896
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:15,746
No, that wouldn't be civilized.

897
00:59:15,815 --> 00:59:18,943
Well, for goodness sake,
grab the girl in your arms,

898
00:59:19,018 --> 00:59:21,851
hold her tight, and dance
her off into the night.

899
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:23,388
Show him up.

900
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:26,721
Show up Shelby Ashton?
"The Ballroom Beast"?

901
00:59:26,793 --> 00:59:28,988
He's the best dancer
around here.

902
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:31,553
I dance like
a sleepwalking chimpanzee.

903
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:35,032
But even a chimpanzee
will fight for its mate.

904
01:00:06,032 --> 01:00:08,694
I told you he'd turn up
here tonight.

905
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:59,844
<i># And sink the Army,</i>
<i>sink the Army gray #</i>

906
01:01:59,912 --> 01:02:01,174
Taxi!

907
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,917
You boys get right in.

908
01:02:08,988 --> 01:02:11,889
I'm the only taxi.
I'm pulling right out.

909
01:02:22,435 --> 01:02:24,027
Where to?

910
01:02:24,103 --> 01:02:27,129
Professor Brainard's house.

911
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:01,968
What are you doing?

912
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:04,703
Even a chimpanzee
fights for his mate.

913
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:05,937
Aah!

914
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,955
Let me go.
People are looking!

915
01:03:17,023 --> 01:03:19,423
Good.
Let's not disappoint them.

916
01:03:20,726 --> 01:03:22,819
Must have given
himself a pep talk.

917
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:24,760
Maybe you can learn something.

918
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:31,798
Go, Prof! Go!

919
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:34,135
We ought to do this more often.

920
01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:45,950
Oh, Ned!

921
01:04:20,052 --> 01:04:24,216
<i># He flies through the air</i>
<i>with the greatest of ease #</i>

922
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:28,954
<i># The daring young man</i>
<i>on the flying trapeze #</i>

923
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:34,665
I wonder what's going on.
Let's go see.

924
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:38,192
We've had enough fun
for one night.

925
01:04:41,374 --> 01:04:42,568
On second thought,

926
01:04:42,641 --> 01:04:44,973
maybe the fun's just beginning!

927
01:04:47,646 --> 01:04:49,273
I beg your pardon.

928
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:51,782
- Are you from Washington?
- We are.

929
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:53,250
Are you looking for Professor...

930
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:54,343
Brainard?

931
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,150
Oh, I'm afraid that's not me.

932
01:04:57,223 --> 01:04:59,088
There's your man.

933
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:20,535
This is a surprise, your coming
all the way from Washington.

934
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:22,574
Here we are.

935
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:25,014
Get right in, gentlemen.

936
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:28,019
Get right in the car, please.
Admiral? General?

937
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:39,855
Now, I realize that military
technology has progressed

938
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:41,365
far beyond the Model T.

939
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:43,561
- Of course.
- I want you to understand.

940
01:05:43,636 --> 01:05:45,604
I'm using it
as a security measure.

941
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:49,368
What better place to hide my
discovery than in a Model T?

942
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:50,966
I want you to keep in mind

943
01:05:51,043 --> 01:05:54,604
that this is only a primitive
application of my discovery.

944
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,205
We use this spark lever here
to levitate,

945
01:05:57,283 --> 01:05:59,080
the gas lever to move forward,

946
01:05:59,151 --> 01:06:01,551
and the brake to stop
or to go in reverse.

947
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,555
Absolute control at all times,
as you will see.

948
01:06:04,623 --> 01:06:07,990
All right, get a good,
tight grip on your emotions

949
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,187
and prepare for takeoff.

950
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,434
Cool head.

951
01:06:16,502 --> 01:06:18,493
A steady hand.

952
01:06:18,571 --> 01:06:20,903
And up we go!

953
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:27,374
Well, if at first
you don't succeed.

954
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,414
Then what?

955
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,143
Try again.

956
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,591
Well, surely you gentlemen
understand this sort of thing.

957
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,891
The first time you tried to
launch a rocket, it didn't...

958
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,531
...go up.

959
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:53,265
It's probably just a short
in the control mechanism.

960
01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:55,102
I'm sorry about this delay.

961
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:57,335
We'll have this
in the air in a minute.

962
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:06,146
This is some kind of a joke.

963
01:07:06,218 --> 01:07:09,119
- I want to see what's in there.
- Just a minute.

964
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:19,663
Somebody's just playing
a practical joke!

965
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:21,791
I'm not laughing.

966
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:23,528
Just a minute, gentlemen!

967
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:25,695
Look, gentlemen, wait.
Please.

968
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,847
Nice going.

969
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:38,042
That was rich
about the squirrel.

970
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:40,244
A real Hawk touch.

971
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,344
Kind of a mean trick to play.

972
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:45,948
We're doing him a favor.
You'll see.

973
01:07:47,593 --> 01:07:50,653
Well, I think we've cleared
the air on one point.

974
01:07:50,729 --> 01:07:52,162
What's that?

975
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:54,495
With what's happened,
I'm sure there's no doubt

976
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:56,194
about you and Ned Brainard.

977
01:07:56,268 --> 01:07:57,792
No.

978
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,701
None whatsoever.

979
01:07:59,772 --> 01:08:02,605
As the Bard says,
"That he is mad, 'tis true;

980
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:06,338
'tis true 'tis pity;
and pity 'tis 'tis true."

981
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:08,039
Oh, shut up!

982
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:13,078
If that's what she
thinks of Shakespeare...

983
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:21,487
Ned?

984
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:25,988
If you've come out to gloat,
I can do without that.

985
01:08:26,065 --> 01:08:27,362
I'm not gloating.

986
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:29,094
I know what you're thinking.

987
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:32,604
That I'm a fraud. That I'm
really losing my marbles.

988
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:35,003
Are you sure you're all right?

989
01:08:35,074 --> 01:08:37,804
I solemnly swear to you,
I have flown this car.

990
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:39,503
Oh, don't, darling.

991
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,205
I'll take you home.

992
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,578
- You get a good night's rest.
- Betsy...

993
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,547
Wait a minute.

994
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:47,848
Why didn't I think
to show this to them?

995
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,287
I got so upset when the car
wouldn't fly. Here.

996
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:53,883
Take this.

997
01:08:53,959 --> 01:08:55,927
Now hold it out.

998
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:57,553
Now drop it.

999
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:02,332
Flubber!

1000
01:09:02,401 --> 01:09:04,869
That's how I was able
to bounce around.

1001
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:06,802
That's how we won the game.

1002
01:09:06,872 --> 01:09:09,363
This is what makes the car fly.

1003
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:12,171
Are you sure you actually
made that car fly?

1004
01:09:12,244 --> 01:09:14,212
This very car.

1005
01:09:15,314 --> 01:09:16,747
No.

1006
01:09:16,815 --> 01:09:18,305
No. I take that back.

1007
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:20,318
Well, did you or didn't you?

1008
01:09:20,386 --> 01:09:23,844
This isn't my car, Betsy.
My car had a radio in it.

1009
01:09:23,922 --> 01:09:26,618
Somebody switched cars on me.

1010
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:27,886
- Hawk.
- Hawk?

1011
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,120
Alonzo Hawk.

1012
01:09:29,194 --> 01:09:31,992
He saw me flying the car.
He came to make a deal.

1013
01:09:32,064 --> 01:09:34,532
I turned him down.
He stole my car.

1014
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,567
Are you sure?

1015
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:38,034
Will you stop saying that?
I'm sure.

1016
01:09:38,103 --> 01:09:39,730
Please believe me.

1017
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:42,672
We've got to get that car.
In the hands of Hawk...

1018
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:43,673
I believe you.

1019
01:09:43,742 --> 01:09:46,210
If we could figure out
some way to...

1020
01:09:48,614 --> 01:09:50,275
You what?

1021
01:09:50,349 --> 01:09:51,816
I believe you.

1022
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:54,116
You do?

1023
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:56,120
Mm-hmm.

1024
01:09:56,188 --> 01:09:57,621
Oh, Betsy.

1025
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,887
I'm glad to see you came
around to my way of thinking.

1026
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,620
I'm with you 100%, Mr. Hawk.

1027
01:10:02,695 --> 01:10:05,289
I know. But we were discussing
the Model T.

1028
01:10:05,364 --> 01:10:06,854
What's with these shoes?

1029
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:08,092
Flubber, Mr. Hawk.

1030
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,759
When you wear these shoes,

1031
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:12,895
you'll have a spring
in your step.

1032
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:14,836
You live life to the fullest.

1033
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:18,206
When the time comes to
shuffle off this mortal coil,

1034
01:10:18,277 --> 01:10:19,642
you won't shuffle.

1035
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:23,170
You'll go out with a hop, a
skip, and a song in your heart.

1036
01:10:23,248 --> 01:10:25,773
I still don't get it.
What about the Model T?

1037
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:29,014
Well, Mr. Hawk,
surely you can see the point.

1038
01:10:29,088 --> 01:10:32,854
Why, shoes are 10 times
more valuable than a flying car.

1039
01:10:32,925 --> 01:10:35,086
- How come?
- Well, figure it out.

1040
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,290
Only 8% of the world's
population buy cars.

1041
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:42,334
Practically everybody
buys shoes.

1042
01:10:42,968 --> 01:10:44,196
She's right.

1043
01:10:44,269 --> 01:10:45,964
Sure, she's right.

1044
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,071
Now, take it easy, Mr. Hawk.

1045
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:52,474
I'll show you how
the Flubber works.

1046
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:55,672
Just tap your heel on the floor.

1047
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:00,140
You see?

1048
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:02,881
- Yeah.
- All right.

1049
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:05,116
I don't know if
I can hold my balance.

1050
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,556
It just takes a little
getting used to.

1051
01:11:07,626 --> 01:11:10,151
Why, Ned's crazy about his.
Aren't you, dear?

1052
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:11,457
Yes, I certainly am.

1053
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:13,760
I can't tell you
the lift I've gotten.

1054
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:16,858
Now, just jump up
and down, Mr. Hawk.

1055
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:18,664
- Up and down?
- Uh-huh.

1056
01:11:21,306 --> 01:11:22,432
There we go!

1057
01:11:23,675 --> 01:11:25,108
There we go!

1058
01:11:25,177 --> 01:11:28,044
Mr. Hawk, I think that's
high enough for right now.

1059
01:11:28,113 --> 01:11:29,546
Oh, Betsy.
Hold him down!

1060
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:31,606
That's fantastic!

1061
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:33,378
Hold him down, Betsy.

1062
01:11:33,452 --> 01:11:35,886
There we are.
Wasn't that wonderful?

1063
01:11:35,954 --> 01:11:38,388
- Wonderful. Why did you stop?
- To talk.

1064
01:11:38,457 --> 01:11:41,017
We know you're interested
in more than money.

1065
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:42,958
- Surely you are.
- I am? What?

1066
01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:44,120
Humanity, Mr. Hawk.

1067
01:11:44,196 --> 01:11:46,221
You can save lives
with these shoes.

1068
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:47,322
Of course you can.

1069
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:49,094
Now, suppose.
Just suppose.

1070
01:11:49,168 --> 01:11:51,728
There's a fire.
A raging fire.

1071
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:54,466
The stairs are an inferno.
The smoke is billowing.

1072
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,134
We're trapped!
Help! Help! Help!

1073
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:59,643
The flames are creeping
closer and closer.

1074
01:12:00,045 --> 01:12:01,478
Oh, no, no, no!

1075
01:12:01,547 --> 01:12:03,742
I can't stand it any longer!

1076
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:05,511
Geronimo!

1077
01:12:05,584 --> 01:12:06,608
My boy!

1078
01:12:07,186 --> 01:12:09,416
Nothing to it, Mr. Hawk.

1079
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:14,654
Why, that's amazing!

1080
01:12:14,726 --> 01:12:15,954
Your turn, Mr. Hawk.

1081
01:12:16,028 --> 01:12:17,825
Oh, now, just a minute.

1082
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:20,831
Oh, it's fun, Mr. Hawk.
Go ahead!

1083
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:23,993
You'll land light as a thistle.
I promise you.

1084
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:25,536
Well, I don't know.

1085
01:12:25,604 --> 01:12:27,037
Let me put it this way.

1086
01:12:27,105 --> 01:12:28,572
I wouldn't want a partner

1087
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,767
who doesn't have faith
in his product.

1088
01:12:30,843 --> 01:12:31,775
You better do it.

1089
01:12:31,844 --> 01:12:34,335
He's very fussy
about things like that.

1090
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:36,779
Nobody's been able
to call me a coward.

1091
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:39,477
I should say not, Mr. Hawk.

1092
01:12:42,287 --> 01:12:44,187
Come on down, Mr. Hawk!

1093
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:46,451
One, two...

1094
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:48,117
- I changed my mind.
- Three!

1095
01:12:48,193 --> 01:12:51,219
Help!

1096
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,100
Whee!

1097
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:57,658
Hey, look!

1098
01:12:57,736 --> 01:12:59,897
Look!
I'm doing it!

1099
01:12:59,972 --> 01:13:01,496
Sure you are, Mr. Hawk.

1100
01:13:01,573 --> 01:13:03,541
Put a little more spring
into it.

1101
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:05,167
See how simple it is?

1102
01:13:05,244 --> 01:13:06,370
Flex your knees.

1103
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:07,935
That's right.

1104
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:10,675
Look at Mr. Hawk, dear.
Isn't he doing well?

1105
01:13:10,749 --> 01:13:12,683
This is marvelous!

1106
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:14,685
Brainard,
we've got something here.

1107
01:13:14,753 --> 01:13:17,153
Sure we have, Mr. Hawk.

1108
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:20,851
Okay, I'm sold!
Now, how do I stop?

1109
01:13:20,926 --> 01:13:21,893
What did he say?

1110
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,258
- I can't quite catch it.
- I can't either!

1111
01:13:24,329 --> 01:13:26,661
I said, tell me how to stop!

1112
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:30,168
You can tell me something.
What have you done with my car?

1113
01:13:30,235 --> 01:13:31,998
You tricked me!

1114
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,367
That's right, Mr. Hawk.

1115
01:13:33,438 --> 01:13:36,407
Now, where is it?
Where did you hide it?

1116
01:13:36,475 --> 01:13:38,067
In my warehouse!

1117
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:40,577
- In his warehouse!
- Thanks, Mr. Hawk!

1118
01:13:40,646 --> 01:13:42,511
Hey, how do I stop?

1119
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:45,175
Happy landing, Mr. Hawk!

1120
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,013
Wait! Don't go!

1121
01:13:47,085 --> 01:13:50,020
Professor Brainard!
Come back!

1122
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:52,648
Don't leave me! Wait!

1123
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,783
Don't go! Biff!

1124
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,988
Biff, where are you?
It's your father calling!

1125
01:13:58,063 --> 01:13:59,291
Huh?

1126
01:13:59,364 --> 01:14:00,456
Biff! Son!

1127
01:14:00,532 --> 01:14:03,695
Wake up! Get out of bed!
Help your father!

1128
01:14:03,769 --> 01:14:06,363
Hey, that's pretty neat, Pop.

1129
01:14:06,438 --> 01:14:07,700
How do you do that?

1130
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:09,934
Well, don't just lie there,
you nitwit!

1131
01:14:10,008 --> 01:14:12,408
Get some somebody!
Get the fire department!

1132
01:14:12,477 --> 01:14:13,774
Don't blow a gasket.

1133
01:14:13,845 --> 01:14:15,813
Stop me!

1134
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:18,281
Help!

1135
01:14:21,453 --> 01:14:22,681
I don't get it.

1136
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:26,622
Why we got to sit around
watching that crummy car?

1137
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:29,058
'Cause Hawk says so, that's why.

1138
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:31,595
You figure he knows
what he's doing?

1139
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:34,359
Fisheye didn't pile up
that loot by being stupid,

1140
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:35,957
you know what I mean?

1141
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,082
Here I go.

1142
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:55,145
Up we go.

1143
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,450
No. I got to go up higher.
No.

1144
01:14:58,023 --> 01:14:59,388
There we are.

1145
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:23,240
Looks like people
got behind in their payments.

1146
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:26,580
Dear sweet Mr. Hawk.

1147
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:28,347
Shh.

1148
01:15:30,055 --> 01:15:31,420
Lenny?

1149
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,650
Yeah, what?

1150
01:15:32,724 --> 01:15:34,419
Do you hear noises?

1151
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,061
Like what kind of noises?

1152
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,927
Sort of like a...

1153
01:15:42,267 --> 01:15:43,564
...a harp.

1154
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,131
Now, let's see.
No, no, no, no!

1155
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,766
Betsy, put it down.
Down.

1156
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:53,538
Down?

1157
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:55,375
Easy. Easy.

1158
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:01,446
There.

1159
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,186
No, no.

1160
01:16:05,257 --> 01:16:06,622
No.

1161
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:08,717
You'd better take my shoe off.

1162
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:13,758
I can't get the knot undone.

1163
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:15,493
Oh! My nail!

1164
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:16,864
Shh.

1165
01:16:16,935 --> 01:16:19,267
Maybe I can help you.

1166
01:16:22,474 --> 01:16:24,408
There it goes again.

1167
01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:28,574
You remember Feisty McKenna?

1168
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,713
Only with him,
it wasn't harp noises.

1169
01:16:31,783 --> 01:16:33,808
He kept hearing birdcalls.

1170
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:40,884
Easy, easy, easy.

1171
01:16:43,762 --> 01:16:46,253
Now, easy.

1172
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:52,999
Okay.

1173
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:56,430
Well.
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1174
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:19,423
Mr. Hawk!

1175
01:17:19,498 --> 01:17:22,160
This is the
fire chief speaking!

1176
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:26,068
We'll have everything under
control in just a moment.

1177
01:17:26,138 --> 01:17:27,730
Now, Mr. Hawk, try to relax.

1178
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:31,173
Relax?
How can I relax, you fathead?

1179
01:17:31,243 --> 01:17:33,404
Mary Lou,
I wish you'd come over.

1180
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:36,106
Pop's putting on a great show.

1181
01:17:36,181 --> 01:17:37,978
They're bringing in a net.

1182
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:39,710
Make way. Come on.

1183
01:17:40,919 --> 01:17:44,320
Come down sitting.
Not feet first!

1184
01:17:46,525 --> 01:17:49,460
The net didn't work
so well, Mary Lou.

1185
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:51,496
I told you we needed a new one.

1186
01:17:51,563 --> 01:17:52,825
You told me?

1187
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:55,628
What do you think I've
been telling the council?

1188
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,794
How am I supposed to buy a net
without an appropriation?

1189
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:00,804
Don't get hot.
I only mentioned it.

1190
01:18:00,872 --> 01:18:03,466
You just keep the kinks
out of the fire hose.

1191
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,703
That's all I want from you.

1192
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:07,438
I'm the chief.

1193
01:18:08,613 --> 01:18:10,308
Sure! Come on over, Millie!

1194
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:12,407
You should see it.

1195
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:15,044
Don't worry, Mr. Hawk.
We'll take care of you.

1196
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,487
No, don't do it!
No!

1197
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:20,850
Ow!

1198
01:18:20,926 --> 01:18:23,759
Personally,
I'm a dry-fly man, myself.

1199
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:25,820
Royal Coachman.

1200
01:18:25,897 --> 01:18:28,866
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, I got him.

1201
01:18:33,438 --> 01:18:35,269
Biff! Help me!

1202
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,274
Do something
before they kill me!

1203
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:39,936
Coach, I know you're
in spring practice.

1204
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:42,411
But it's a matter
of life and death!

1205
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,559
That ain't no birdcall.

1206
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:02,459
Well, look who's here.
It's the professor.

1207
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,695
It wasn't smart
breaking in like that.

1208
01:19:04,769 --> 01:19:07,329
Well, I didn't exactly break in.

1209
01:19:07,405 --> 01:19:10,431
Of course, as you can see,
I'm trying to break out.

1210
01:19:12,244 --> 01:19:13,836
Careful, boys.

1211
01:19:17,782 --> 01:19:19,511
Look!

1212
01:19:21,152 --> 01:19:23,347
What happened, boys?
You missed me?

1213
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:24,752
Here I am!

1214
01:19:25,957 --> 01:19:28,721
Now, take it easy, boys.
Take it easy.

1215
01:19:28,793 --> 01:19:30,124
Don't crowd me!

1216
01:19:30,195 --> 01:19:32,527
Don't want to get tough
with you again.

1217
01:19:40,805 --> 01:19:44,263
Barrel-fresh hot doggies!
They're a foot long!

1218
01:19:44,342 --> 01:19:46,674
Get your hot doggies!
Right this way!

1219
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:49,179
Here we are, folks.
Hot dogs.

1220
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:59,814
And you called the police?

1221
01:19:59,891 --> 01:20:02,792
Certainly. I was getting
ready to take a bath.

1222
01:20:02,861 --> 01:20:06,228
I saw this face
flashing past the window.

1223
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:08,960
How did I know
the poor man was in trouble?

1224
01:20:09,034 --> 01:20:10,331
Back!

1225
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:16,764
Well, sir, I calculate he
gains about 18 inches to bounce.

1226
01:20:16,841 --> 01:20:19,639
And your opinion is?

1227
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:24,739
About 7:00 tonight, he's gonna
be in serious trouble.

1228
01:20:24,816 --> 01:20:28,081
Gosh. My father never
does anything like that.

1229
01:20:28,153 --> 01:20:31,316
For a parent, he's way out!

1230
01:20:31,389 --> 01:20:33,084
Excuse me, excuse me.

1231
01:20:39,664 --> 01:20:41,029
This way, fellas.

1232
01:20:46,071 --> 01:20:49,165
Son! What are you
going to do to me?

1233
01:20:53,244 --> 01:20:55,303
One, two...

1234
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,349
Biff! I'm your father!
Please!

1235
01:20:58,416 --> 01:20:59,508
Hike!

1236
01:21:15,633 --> 01:21:18,261
Pop!
Are you all right, Pop?

1237
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:21,097
And why wouldn't I be?

1238
01:21:21,172 --> 01:21:22,537
The warehouse!

1239
01:21:31,082 --> 01:21:34,017
Oh, no. Once more,
and we'd have had it open.

1240
01:21:34,085 --> 01:21:36,280
You're not gonna
give up this easily.

1241
01:21:36,354 --> 01:21:38,686
It's just a bump on the head.

1242
01:21:38,757 --> 01:21:41,419
That's it. Come on.
What would Mr. Hawk say?

1243
01:21:41,493 --> 01:21:44,826
Come on, let's get on our feet.
On with the fight. Come on.

1244
01:21:44,896 --> 01:21:46,625
Here. Try this.

1245
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:48,529
Oh. Thank you, dear.

1246
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:54,597
That did it. Better get
back in the car, Betsy.

1247
01:21:54,672 --> 01:21:57,232
All right, come on,
you cut-rate gorillas!

1248
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:02,004
- Hit him high this time.
- Got you.

1249
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:06,876
Okay, Mr. Jumping Jack.

1250
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:21,521
Look out!

1251
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:24,763
Ned!

1252
01:22:27,772 --> 01:22:29,899
Corners beautifully,
doesn't it?

1253
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:32,907
Ned, look!

1254
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:34,376
Here they come!

1255
01:22:41,019 --> 01:22:43,544
Come on, you guys!
Get in the car! Hurry up!

1256
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:50,752
To think I always thought of you

1257
01:22:50,829 --> 01:22:54,890
as a nice, easygoing
college professor.

1258
01:22:54,966 --> 01:22:57,127
- Betsy?
- Mm-hmm?

1259
01:22:57,202 --> 01:23:00,933
No. This is hardly the time
to say what I was going to say.

1260
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:03,633
Never mind.
Go ahead. Say it.

1261
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,972
Well...

1262
01:23:07,045 --> 01:23:09,639
What do you know?
They want to play rough.

1263
01:23:09,714 --> 01:23:11,909
Here. Give me that thing!

1264
01:23:11,983 --> 01:23:13,416
You can't do that, Pop!

1265
01:23:13,485 --> 01:23:16,750
We gotta show this nut
we mean business!

1266
01:23:25,663 --> 01:23:27,460
Well, looky there.

1267
01:23:28,266 --> 01:23:29,961
A police car.

1268
01:23:30,034 --> 01:23:32,559
Well, well, well.

1269
01:23:40,378 --> 01:23:41,902
They've been asking for it.

1270
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,106
Asking for what?

1271
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:45,615
The Shelby Stomp.

1272
01:23:47,919 --> 01:23:49,409
It's Brainard!

1273
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:02,356
- Faster, son!
- I've got it down to the floor!

1274
01:24:15,046 --> 01:24:16,741
- Hold it!
- All right!

1275
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:18,475
All right, you birds!

1276
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:20,711
Get your hands
on the top of that car.

1277
01:24:20,785 --> 01:24:22,309
Now, this is ridiculous!

1278
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:24,480
Do you realize who I am?

1279
01:24:25,156 --> 01:24:28,353
Yeah. You're the guy that had
this hot pistol in his mitt.

1280
01:24:28,426 --> 01:24:30,087
I'm Alonzo P. Hawk,

1281
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:33,426
president of the Auld Lang Syne
finance company!

1282
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,992
Isn't it a small world?

1283
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:39,036
Why, of course I remember you.

1284
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:40,331
Well, that's better.

1285
01:24:40,405 --> 01:24:43,101
Sure, you're the outfit
that repossessed

1286
01:24:43,174 --> 01:24:45,699
my electric icebox last year.

1287
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:47,642
Well, Officer Hanson!

1288
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:49,339
Sorry, but can you tell me

1289
01:24:49,414 --> 01:24:51,405
the shortest way
to Washington, D.C.?

1290
01:24:51,482 --> 01:24:52,972
Sure, Professor.

1291
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:56,043
Down the block to the
intersection, left, Highway 9.

1292
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,781
No, I mean as the crow flies.

1293
01:24:57,855 --> 01:25:00,449
Oh! That way.
Due East.

1294
01:25:00,525 --> 01:25:02,015
Thanks.

1295
01:25:02,927 --> 01:25:04,394
Officer, stop that man!

1296
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:07,898
He's flying off with millions
of dollars that belong to me!

1297
01:25:07,966 --> 01:25:13,529
Mr. Hawk, surely you're not
accusing dear, old Professor...

1298
01:25:25,817 --> 01:25:29,617
I have an unknown approaching
Washington prohibited zone.

1299
01:25:29,687 --> 01:25:32,622
Heading 0-6-8.
Angels 1.5.

1300
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:34,351
Speed 45 knots.

1301
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:35,983
45 knots?
Are you sure?

1302
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,254
Yes, sir.

1303
01:25:41,499 --> 01:25:44,093
Hello, Bird Farm?
This is Flag Down.

1304
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:45,760
Scramble the 5-minute birds.

1305
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:51,906
Attention, attention.

1306
01:25:51,976 --> 01:25:53,739
Scramble Bird Dog flight.

1307
01:25:53,811 --> 01:25:56,405
Scramble Bird Dog flight.

1308
01:25:56,481 --> 01:25:58,142
Vector 2-7-0.

1309
01:25:58,216 --> 01:26:00,275
Vector 2-7-0.

1310
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:04,845
Go gate to angels 1.5.
Angels 1.5.

1311
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:54,567
It's so lovely
and peaceful up here.

1312
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,039
As though we're the only
people in the world.

1313
01:26:57,108 --> 01:26:58,632
Well, aren't we?

1314
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,579
Ned.

1315
01:27:07,652 --> 01:27:09,643
Ned!

1316
01:27:15,626 --> 01:27:16,991
Did you see what I saw?

1317
01:27:17,061 --> 01:27:19,086
- I hope not!
- Let's run that again.

1318
01:27:19,163 --> 01:27:20,323
Roger.

1319
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:24,100
Here they come again!

1320
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:26,760
Let's get out of here!

1321
01:27:32,543 --> 01:27:35,103
Hello, Flag Down.
This is Bird Dog Leader.

1322
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:36,942
I have a visual on that bogey.

1323
01:27:37,014 --> 01:27:38,879
Well, speak up, man.
What is it?

1324
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:42,010
I don't think you're
going to like this, sir.

1325
01:27:42,086 --> 01:27:44,748
What's the matter?
Give me that bogey report!

1326
01:27:44,822 --> 01:27:47,416
It's a Model T, sir.

1327
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:48,424
A what?

1328
01:27:48,493 --> 01:27:52,896
A Model T Touring Car.
Only it's flying!

1329
01:27:53,631 --> 01:27:56,099
Bird Dog Leader,
I suggest for your own sake

1330
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:58,032
that you take another look.

1331
01:28:00,004 --> 01:28:03,667
I can't, sir.
It's gone into a cloud.

1332
01:28:03,741 --> 01:28:06,266
And it won't come out!

1333
01:28:07,912 --> 01:28:09,971
What's the procedure, sir?

1334
01:28:10,648 --> 01:28:13,412
I think I'll let
the colonel handle this one.

1335
01:28:13,484 --> 01:28:14,951
Yes, Flag Down?

1336
01:28:15,953 --> 01:28:17,944
Well, go on, Captain.
Go on.

1337
01:28:19,357 --> 01:28:21,689
A flying what?

1338
01:28:21,759 --> 01:28:24,523
Cut the clowning Flag Down.
The C.O.'s here.

1339
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:26,563
- What's going on, Colonel?
- Nothing.

1340
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:28,098
What do you mean, nothing?

1341
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,657
It's Flag Down.
Just a question of procedure.

1342
01:28:30,735 --> 01:28:32,794
Give me that.

1343
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:35,668
What's all this?
Don't you know your job, man?

1344
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:38,334
Don't interrupt me.

1345
01:28:39,076 --> 01:28:40,907
It might interest you to know

1346
01:28:40,978 --> 01:28:43,674
the general staff has worked out
exact procedure

1347
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:45,306
for every possible situation.

1348
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:47,351
There's nothing could happen...

1349
01:28:49,187 --> 01:28:51,018
A flying what?

1350
01:29:03,935 --> 01:29:05,960
- Looks like they've gone.
- Good.

1351
01:29:06,037 --> 01:29:09,165
Can we get out of here now?
This is ruining my hairset.

1352
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,765
Darling, you never looked
more beautiful.

1353
01:29:14,846 --> 01:29:17,371
Gentlemen.
It's quite simple, really.

1354
01:29:17,448 --> 01:29:19,507
Obviously, a Model T cannot fly.

1355
01:29:19,584 --> 01:29:22,246
It must be something
disguised as a Model T.

1356
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,254
I am declaring
a Condition Yellow.

1357
01:29:24,322 --> 01:29:27,450
Let's move, Colonel.

1358
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:41,831
How lovely it is.

1359
01:29:41,906 --> 01:29:44,397
Makes you feel proud,
doesn't it?

1360
01:29:44,475 --> 01:29:46,670
Washington's a great city.

1361
01:29:46,744 --> 01:29:48,735
There's something for everyone.

1362
01:29:58,656 --> 01:30:01,591
Look at all those people
down there!

1363
01:30:01,659 --> 01:30:03,354
I think they're staring at us.

1364
01:30:03,427 --> 01:30:05,418
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1365
01:30:05,496 --> 01:30:07,487
I can't hear what
they're yelling.

1366
01:30:07,565 --> 01:30:09,590
Hi, down there!

1367
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:11,965
Oh, Ned!
Look out!

1368
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:19,603
Kind of hits you between
the eyes, doesn't it?

1369
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,413
Look!
There's Grant's Tomb.

1370
01:30:25,483 --> 01:30:27,815
I think Grant's Tomb
is in New York, dear.

1371
01:30:27,885 --> 01:30:30,217
I believe that's
the Jefferson Memorial.

1372
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:32,051
You mean Monticello?

1373
01:30:37,361 --> 01:30:40,353
Betsy, I think there's
a map in the side pocket.

1374
01:30:40,431 --> 01:30:42,991
Will you see if you
can find the Pentagon?

1375
01:30:47,171 --> 01:30:50,470
It has five sides
and a big parking lot.

1376
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:52,771
I doubt if it's on here, dear.

1377
01:30:52,843 --> 01:30:55,277
This map is from the year 1917.

1378
01:30:55,346 --> 01:30:57,746
Hmm? Oh!

1379
01:30:57,815 --> 01:30:59,214
Well.

1380
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:06,112
Oh, there's the Capitol!
Won't that do?

1381
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:07,782
The Capitol.

1382
01:31:07,858 --> 01:31:10,383
When you think of all
the history made there.

1383
01:31:10,461 --> 01:31:14,056
Now, don't forget, you're
making history right now.

1384
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:17,362
Oh, you think so?
I hope they don't make a fuss.

1385
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:20,529
We interrupt to
bring you an emergency bulletin.

1386
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:23,904
This is the commanding officer,
Sector Air Defense,

1387
01:31:23,975 --> 01:31:27,138
speaking on all commercial
and military wavelengths.

1388
01:31:27,211 --> 01:31:29,145
Attention!

1389
01:31:29,213 --> 01:31:32,944
An unidentified flying object
is over the city.

1390
01:31:33,017 --> 01:31:34,541
I don't see anything.

1391
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:37,782
No. Nothing up here but us.

1392
01:31:37,855 --> 01:31:39,880
Every defensive missile

1393
01:31:39,957 --> 01:31:40,924
- in the area
- Us!

1394
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:43,756
Is trained on the flying object.

1395
01:31:43,828 --> 01:31:46,126
If it does not identify itself,

1396
01:31:46,197 --> 01:31:48,688
it will be shot down
immediately.

1397
01:31:48,766 --> 01:31:49,960
They wouldn't dare!

1398
01:31:50,034 --> 01:31:51,558
Oh, yes.
Yes, they'd dare.

1399
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:54,070
This is your last warning.

1400
01:31:54,138 --> 01:31:57,630
Identify yourself
or we will open fire.

1401
01:31:57,708 --> 01:31:59,335
Ready at Fort Mead?

1402
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:02,004
Missile batteries
locked on target, sir.

1403
01:32:02,713 --> 01:32:04,180
Repeat!

1404
01:32:04,248 --> 01:32:08,150
Are you listening,
unidentified flying object?

1405
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,185
We are waiting
for your response!

1406
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:15,624
I am responding!
I'm Professor Brainard!

1407
01:32:15,693 --> 01:32:18,491
At the count of 10,
we open fire.

1408
01:32:18,562 --> 01:32:21,656
Don't bother to count, general!
I'm an American!

1409
01:32:21,732 --> 01:32:23,666
See? My credit cards!

1410
01:32:23,734 --> 01:32:25,861
Three...

1411
01:32:26,704 --> 01:32:28,035
Four...

1412
01:32:28,105 --> 01:32:28,901
Wait!

1413
01:32:28,973 --> 01:32:31,237
You're not gonna
stand for that, are you?

1414
01:32:31,308 --> 01:32:32,434
Five...

1415
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:33,841
Yes.

1416
01:32:35,312 --> 01:32:36,506
Six...

1417
01:32:37,882 --> 01:32:39,349
Seven...

1418
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:42,875
Sir, Fort Mead reports he's
gone behind the Capitol dome.

1419
01:32:44,121 --> 01:32:46,089
- Eight...
- Congress is in session.

1420
01:32:46,157 --> 01:32:49,285
If you fire, we might lose every
senator and congressman.

1421
01:32:52,496 --> 01:32:54,191
Nine...

1422
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:58,132
And they've just put
a new front on the building.

1423
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:07,170
Hold your fire.

1424
01:33:07,244 --> 01:33:09,804
Well, why try
to pass the buck to me?

1425
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,814
Just because it looks like a...

1426
01:33:11,882 --> 01:33:13,611
What?

1427
01:33:13,684 --> 01:33:16,517
Well, I don't care
if it is a Model T!

1428
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:17,554
Shoot it down!

1429
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:18,610
Right, right.

1430
01:33:18,689 --> 01:33:21,283
And if you happen to see
a Stutz Bearcat

1431
01:33:21,358 --> 01:33:23,849
or a Pope-Toledo
flying over the Capitol,

1432
01:33:23,928 --> 01:33:26,419
shoot them down, too.

1433
01:33:31,736 --> 01:33:33,704
As a personal favor,

1434
01:33:33,771 --> 01:33:37,434
won't you please
identify yourself?

1435
01:33:39,043 --> 01:33:41,034
Professor, this is the admiral.

1436
01:33:41,112 --> 01:33:43,205
Proceed to Anacostia
Naval Air Station.

1437
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,838
This is General Singer.

1438
01:33:44,915 --> 01:33:46,883
You fly to Bolling
Air Force Base.

1439
01:33:46,951 --> 01:33:49,146
This is the Army.
Report to Fort Myer.

1440
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:53,213
- Anacostia Naval Air Station!
- Bolling Air Force Base!

1441
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:56,623
- Bolling Air Force Base!
- Fort Myer!

1442
01:33:56,694 --> 01:34:00,152
Now hear this!

1443
01:34:00,231 --> 01:34:01,823
Anacostia.

1444
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:05,568
They had their chance.
I'm not gonna fool around.

1445
01:34:05,636 --> 01:34:06,660
What are you doing?

1446
01:34:06,737 --> 01:34:09,763
We're going to land.
On that big patch of green lawn.

1447
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,035
- Oh, Ned. Not there, please!
- Why not?

1448
01:34:12,109 --> 01:34:13,542
Well, my hair is a mess!

1449
01:34:13,611 --> 01:34:15,772
And I haven't a thing to wear!

1450
01:34:19,016 --> 01:34:21,280
Anybody home?

1451
01:34:21,352 --> 01:34:22,751
Ned!

1452
01:34:34,598 --> 01:34:37,192
Professor, what did
the president have to say?

1453
01:34:37,268 --> 01:34:38,132
Well...

1454
01:34:38,202 --> 01:34:40,966
The president, devoted
to the advance of science,

1455
01:34:41,038 --> 01:34:44,974
has embraced the discovery
of Flubber with enthusiasm.

1456
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:47,101
Professor, what branch
of the services

1457
01:34:47,178 --> 01:34:49,976
will be given control
of your new discovery?

1458
01:34:50,047 --> 01:34:50,570
Well...

1459
01:34:50,648 --> 01:34:52,240
All will share alike.

1460
01:34:52,316 --> 01:34:55,080
In our opinion,
Flubber will only cement

1461
01:34:55,152 --> 01:34:58,280
the great traditional ties
of interservice cooperation.

1462
01:34:58,355 --> 01:35:01,222
Professor, with this great
breakthrough in science,

1463
01:35:01,292 --> 01:35:04,193
do you feel you still have
other worlds to conquer?

1464
01:35:04,261 --> 01:35:05,285
I do.

1465
01:35:05,362 --> 01:35:07,728
Just so there's
no doubt about it,

1466
01:35:07,798 --> 01:35:10,665
would you mind repeating that?

1467
01:35:10,734 --> 01:35:12,031
I do.

1468
01:35:12,102 --> 01:35:16,163
With pleasure, and a deep
sense of accomplishment,

1469
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,870
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1470
01:35:29,253 --> 01:35:33,519
Firecracker!
Firecracker! Sis-boom-bah!

1471
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:37,857
Medfield! Medfield!
Rah, rah, rah!

1472
01:35:44,134 --> 01:35:46,534
Goodbye, Betsy!
Good luck!
