1
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,428
<i>This is Spain...</i>

2
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:20,432
<i>one thousand and eighty years
after the coming of Christ.</i>

3
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,936
<i>It is a war-torn, unhappy land...</i>

4
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:25,995
<i>half Christian, half Moor.</i>

5
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:32,210
<i>This is the time and the story
of Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar...</i>

6
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,375
<i>known to history and to legend
as El Cid, "The Lord."</i>

7
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:42,985
<i>He was a simple man who became
Spain's greatest hero.</i>

8
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,149
<i>He rose above religious hatreds...</i>

9
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,820
<i>and called upon all Spaniards,
whether Christian or Moor...</i>

10
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:52,695
<i>to face a common enemy who threatened
to destroy their land of Spain.</i>

11
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:57,302
<i>This enemy was gathering
his savage forces...</i>

12
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,806
<i>across the Mediterranean Sea
on the north shores of Africa.</i>

13
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,802
<i>He was the African emir, Ben Yusuf.</i>

14
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:31,865
The Prophet has commanded us
to rule the world.

15
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:36,307
Where in all your land of Spain
is the glory of Allah?

16
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,941
When men speak of you,
they speak of poets...

17
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:43,005
music makers, doctors, scientists.

18
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,142
Where are your warriors?

19
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:48,449
You dare call yourselves
sons of the Prophet?

20
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,489
You have become women!

21
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,259
Burn your books.

22
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:56,795
Make warriors of your poets.

23
00:07:56,863 --> 00:08:00,560
Let your doctors invent
new poisons for our arrows.

24
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:03,125
Let your scientists
invent new war machines.

25
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:05,797
And then, kill!

26
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:08,238
Burn.

27
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,902
Infidels live on your frontiers.

28
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:13,445
Encourage them to kill each other.

29
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:16,004
And when they are weak and torn...

30
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,778
I will sweep up from Africa...

31
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:22,413
and thus the empire of the one God,
the true God Allah...

32
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,753
- Allah is the one God.
- Will spread.

33
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,282
First, across Spain.

34
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,829
Then, across Europe.

35
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:33,593
Then, the whole world!

36
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:01,627
Heavenly Father,
we are lost and in darkness.

37
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,926
Once again they destroy our towns...

38
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,330
take our people in bondage.

39
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,368
Please help us, Father.

40
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:11,700
Send us someone...

41
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,830
who will take us to the light.

42
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,376
Father. Here. Come.

43
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,527
The Cross.

44
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,289
<i>The Cross.</i>

45
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,623
We couldn't save your village...

46
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:11,289
<i>but we captured their leaders.</i>

47
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,100
Who are you?

48
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:17,227
Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar.

49
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:22,670
Vivar?

50
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,006
You're a long way from home.

51
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:28,940
Sir, you are not dressed for battle.

52
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,245
This was to have been
my wedding day, Father.

53
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:37,985
How is it you came here, my son?

54
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,385
I thought this would be
the shortest road to my bride.

55
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:51,769
We are ready, my lord.
Do we hang them now?

56
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:55,672
No, Fanez.
They come to Vivar with us.

57
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,569
No! Stop!

58
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:39,117
Fernando, put down those stones!

59
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:43,851
Welcome home, my son.

60
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:46,448
Here are some Moorish
prisoners for you.

61
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:49,620
We didn't expect
such wedding guests.

62
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,028
Are you holding them for tribute?

63
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:54,032
They're your prisoners, sir.

64
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,661
They're yours.
You captured them.

65
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:00,205
You must decide
what is to be done with them.

66
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,366
Hang them! Now!

67
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,172
We are emir... kings.

68
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,842
There will be a great ransom for you
if you let us live.

69
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:17,054
You were ready enough to kill.

70
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:19,114
It would seem
you're less ready to die.

71
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,660
I am ready, my Lord Rodrigo.

72
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:25,721
I have no great desire to live to see
what is coming for all of us.

73
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,925
What is coming for all of us?

74
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,935
Wars, death and destruction.

75
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:35,236
Blood and fire more terrible
than has ever been seen by living man.

76
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:59,190
Don Diego, I will take your prisoners
back to the King at Burgos.

77
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:03,429
They are not my prisoners.
They are my son's.

78
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:05,733
Oh, forgive me, Don Rodrigo.

79
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:10,003
Then it will be your prisoners we will
hang in the palace square at Burgos.

80
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:14,137
We will hang their bodies high
as an example to other Moors!

81
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:24,351
Don Ordonez, these prisoners
will not go to Burgos.

82
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:27,689
The King will be just as pleased
if you hang them here.

83
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,058
We've been killing them for years.

84
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:32,927
What has it brought us? Peace?

85
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,991
Hang me, and my sons
will not rest...

86
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,867
while a single Christian
remains alive in Vivar.

87
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,463
What other way is there
to treat the Moors?

88
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,534
Hang them now!

89
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,111
Do you want these people to live in fear
the rest of their lives?

90
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:57,679
Antonio, do you want to see
your church burned too?

91
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,987
Your villages destroyed?

92
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,118
Then kill them.

93
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:06,131
Don Diego, tell your son
that it is treason...

94
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,999
to refuse to turn over prisoners
to an officer of the King.

95
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:20,678
Rodrigo knows what he must do.

96
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:39,525
Do you solemnly pledge never again
to attack King Ferdinand's country?

97
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,600
I do.

98
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:02,621
Among our people,
we have a word for a warrior...

99
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:06,180
with the vision to be just
and the courage to be merciful.

100
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:09,717
We call such a man, "El Cid."

101
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,897
I, Moutamin, Emir of Saragossa...

102
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:16,457
pledge eternal friendship
to the Cid of Vivar...

103
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:20,370
and allegiance to his sovereign lord,
King Ferdinand of Castile.

104
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,635
May Allah strike
the eyes from my head...

105
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,271
and the flesh from my bones
if I break this pledge.

106
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,372
In the name of Allah.

107
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:40,482
In the name of Allah.

108
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,662
In the name of Ferdinand...

109
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,261
King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...

110
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,364
I charge you with treason.

111
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:59,275
Within seven days, you will appear
before the King at Burgos...

112
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:01,279
to answer these charges.

113
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,626
You did take
the shortest road, my son.

114
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,691
Not to your bride,
but to your destiny.

115
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:28,269
God sent you to us, my son.

116
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,309
God has sent you.

117
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,349
Rodrigo!

118
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,664
But I did hear a sound.

119
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:09,297
He should have been here by now.
Why is he so late?

120
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:13,106
He is not late, my lady.
He was to be here at sundown.

121
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,147
It's barely noon.

122
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,217
Yes.

123
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:26,714
You don't really understand
how love keeps time.

124
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:30,159
Later means sooner;
sundown means noon.

125
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:40,365
Still, a man on a horse
can move only so fast...

126
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,265
no matter how much
the man is in love.

127
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:46,311
Yes, my lady.

128
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:55,185
All night long I kept thinking:

129
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:58,121
"Oh, the Moors
have ambushed him!

130
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,557
"Oh, yes, he's been
attacked by a madman.

131
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:03,754
Oh, he's fallen ill."

132
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:11,092
They say all women in love...

133
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,104
are tormented that way.

134
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,001
Because they don't dare believe
that such happiness...

135
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:20,011
can really be theirs.

136
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:27,710
Help me, please.

137
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,341
The gown is... very beautiful.

138
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:56,804
Your Highness is... very gracious.

139
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:01,448
It is not often we are so honored.

140
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,081
No. It is not an ordinary day.

141
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,754
Then you have not heard?

142
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:11,023
There has been news.

143
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,328
News of... of Rodrigo, Your Highness?

144
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:22,305
Of Rodrigo.
The gown is so beautiful.

145
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,309
Your Highness.

146
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:26,641
Your Highness.

147
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:29,545
Can you tell me what
has happened to Rodrigo?

148
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:35,212
Yes, I can tell you.

149
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:39,053
- You knew that Rodrigo was on his way here?
- Yes.

150
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,060
That there was a battle?

151
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:45,564
You knew that there was a battle
with the Moors?

152
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:10,421
Chimene.

153
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,258
My father, tell me.

154
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:17,362
- Rodrigo's been hurt.

155
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,830
- No, Rodrigo's alive and well.

156
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,601
You love him so much.

157
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:28,731
Two names.

158
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,742
My father...

159
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,778
and Rodrigo.

160
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:35,143
Chimene...

161
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,273
you are my only child.

162
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,874
I have no wife.

163
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:42,079
You alone can carry my blood.

164
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,848
I should have had a son.

165
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:53,154
But Rodrigo will be your son.

166
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:55,393
No.

167
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:58,970
<i>You're young.</i>

168
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,006
<i>You can learn to love again.</i>

169
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:06,208
Could I learn
to love another father?

170
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:10,237
It is not the same.
There are others.

171
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,880
Chimene!
Chimene!

172
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:29,126
Don Garcia Ordonez,
tell me what has happened.

173
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:40,370
You have always been a good friend.

174
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,937
I would be more to you, Chimene...

175
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:45,006
if you would let me.

176
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,109
You know that can never be.

177
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:49,780
It can now.

178
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:54,451
- Why now?
- Could you love a traitor, Chimene?

179
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:59,755
Since I love Rodrigo,
the question can never have meaning.

180
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:03,359
It has meaning now.
Rodrigo is a traitor.

181
00:23:04,637 --> 00:23:06,571
I do not believe you.

182
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:09,608
<i>- There were others who were there.
- I do not believe them.</i>

183
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:13,076
I am the one who brought
the charges against him.

184
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:17,241
He is to be tried for
treason against the King.

185
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:20,217
You would do anything
to hurt Rodrigo.

186
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:23,346
No. I would do anything to win you.

187
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,582
<i>Chimene!
What if these charges are true?</i>

188
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,493
<i>- They are not true.
- But there are many who saw it.</i>

189
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:32,497
They did not know what they saw!

190
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,897
You will see for yourself, Chimene.

191
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:10,656
His Majesty, Don Ferdinand...

192
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,720
the King, our Lord!

193
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,791
King of Castile, Leon and Asturias.

194
00:25:32,418 --> 00:25:36,650
<i>And the Infantes, Prince Sancho...</i>

195
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,191
Prince Alfonso...

196
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:57,367
and the Princess Dona Urraca.

197
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:08,880
You have been gathered here
at this court...

198
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:12,981
to give your solemn advice
in a matter of great import to the Crown.

199
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:16,824
Garcia Ordonez has invoked
the charge of treason...

200
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:18,829
against Rodrigo of Vivar.

201
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,992
<i>He cannot bring such charges against my son!</i>

202
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:51,421
<i>I repeat the charge! It is treason!</i>

203
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:54,933
He's the man who's fighting Moors!

204
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,934
It is treason to the King!

205
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,709
You shouldn't have come.

206
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:41,675
Then I'll go.

207
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,521
No. Another moment.

208
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:54,682
Oh, forever.

209
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,285
Besides, there is no danger.

210
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:59,387
No danger?

211
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,259
Listen to them.

212
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:09,604
It doesn't matter.

213
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:11,734
Because I know you're not guilty.

214
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:16,514
- You don't even know what I've done.
- No.

215
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:21,183
But I know it was not treason.

216
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,057
What did you do?

217
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,091
I let a man live.
No. Five men.

218
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:35,291
But how can they call it treason?

219
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,595
<i>Death to the Moors!</i>

220
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,884
Who are these five men?

221
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:56,387
Emirs.

222
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:03,827
Moors? You let Moors live? Why?

223
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,989
I'm not sure it was right.

224
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,392
I don't know.
I think it was...

225
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:15,363
It happened strangely.

226
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,374
I was on my way to you.

227
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:21,744
I can't even remember where I was.

228
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:25,305
There must have been roads...

229
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,352
trees and people.

230
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,921
All I remember is your face.

231
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:34,083
<i>There was a battle.
I fought too.</i>

232
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,755
My heart wasn't in my sword.
I kept seeing your face.

233
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:57,204
Suddenly, I thought,
"Why are we killing each other?"

234
00:29:57,282 --> 00:29:59,477
True, they're Moors,
we're Christians...

235
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,790
Chimene...

236
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:10,720
do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

237
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:20,762
Yes, but... there always
have been wars between us.

238
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:27,946
I know.

239
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:31,106
Always.

240
00:30:33,318 --> 00:30:36,378
You don't think, then...

241
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:38,446
we could live in peace?

242
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:44,128
<i>Silence!</i>

243
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,664
<i>Will you keep quiet,
the both of you!</i>

244
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,925
This is not a charge
I would bring lightly against any man...

245
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:55,064
especially a man who in a short time
was to be my son.

246
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,371
But a man who frees
the enemies of the King...

247
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,707
son or no son...

248
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,373
I must call such a man "traitor."

249
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:09,219
Sire, he slurs
the honor of our family.

250
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,221
This cannot be.

251
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:14,359
I, too, was once
the King's champion.

252
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:17,793
That was many years ago, Don Diego.

253
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:20,730
Perhaps it will be better to
leave the matter in our hands.

254
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,395
No, Sire. There were things said here
which cannot be forgotten...

255
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,438
even in this royal assembly.

256
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,242
Count Gormaz of Oviedo...

257
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:36,371
when you call my son a traitor...

258
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,712
I say you lie.

259
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:44,651
I am the King's champion.

260
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:49,558
I would not want to shame my sword
with an old man's blood.

261
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:52,461
Yet no man can call me a liar.

262
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:56,300
Liar!

263
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,748
I don't really understand, Rodrigo.

264
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:25,730
I only know if it grew
out of our love...

265
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,767
it must be right.

266
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:11,206
What do you want?

267
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:14,177
You shamed my father.

268
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:16,840
I want his name back.

269
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:19,577
But not the way you left it.

270
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:24,020
I want it clean so he can once more
wear it proudly.

271
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:27,523
I cannot apologize.

272
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:30,618
It is not that I do not want to.

273
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:32,720
I do not know how to.

274
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:36,062
People will only
esteem you the more for it.

275
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:38,602
Everyone will understand.

276
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,934
I have told you no.

277
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:43,065
Go home, Rodrigo.

278
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:48,237
I ask nothing for myself.

279
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:51,639
I humble myself before you.

280
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:56,686
Have pity on a proud old man.

281
00:33:56,755 --> 00:34:00,521
I have no pity for those who have outlived
the usefulness of their lives.

282
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,392
Count.

283
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,361
I beg you.

284
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:20,740
See? Two words are all I ask.

285
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:24,873
Can you not say, "Forgive me"?

286
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:28,850
I cannot.

287
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,184
I will not.

288
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,415
Now go.

289
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:36,926
Don't make me stain my life...

290
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,225
and Chimene's with your blood.

291
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:42,562
Go home, Rodrigo.

292
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:47,128
No one will think the less of you for not having
stood up against the King's own champion.

293
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:51,409
Count Gormaz!

294
00:34:56,281 --> 00:35:00,775
I will ask you...
only this last time.

295
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:07,314
I see that courage and honor
are not dead in Castile.

296
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:11,522
And now I remember why I once thought
you were worthy of my Chimene.

297
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:13,530
Go home, Rodrigo.

298
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:17,125
What glory is there for the King's champion
in killing someone like you?

299
00:35:34,286 --> 00:35:38,723
Can a man live...
without honor?

300
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:43,627
No.

301
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:21,218
Now, Count, now I am satisfied.

302
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,347
Chimene!

303
00:38:57,989 --> 00:38:59,923
Chimene!

304
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,151
Chimene.

305
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:11,359
Father!

306
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:16,136
- Chimene.
- Oh, Father!

307
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:22,940
Avenge me...
as my son would.

308
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:27,347
Don't let me die...

309
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,855
unavenged.

310
00:39:31,923 --> 00:39:34,187
Unavenged.

311
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:36,193
Oh, Father.

312
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:07,057
I didn't seek your father's life, Chimene.

313
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:13,897
No, but you knew he could
only answer the way he did...

314
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,860
and you were prepared to kill him.

315
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:24,167
You bought your honor
with my sorrow.

316
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:27,711
There was no other way for me.

317
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:31,306
The man you chose to love
could do only what I did.

318
00:40:31,382 --> 00:40:33,612
Why did you come, Rodrigo?

319
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:37,644
Did you think the woman you chose to love
could do less than you?

320
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:44,490
I tried not to come.

321
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:46,996
I tried.

322
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:50,034
I told my love
it had no right to live.

323
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,037
But my love won't die.

324
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:59,741
- Kill it!
- You kill it!

325
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:01,870
Tell me you don't love me.

326
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,724
I cannot.

327
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,386
Not yet.

328
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:20,397
But I will make myself
worthy of you, Rodrigo.

329
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,301
I will learn to hate you.

330
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:43,045
Dona Chimene, daughter of
the late Count Gormaz of Oviedo...

331
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:46,056
the King's lamented champion.

332
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:09,210
Dona Chimene,
never was there a moment

333
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:11,542
when we needed
your father more.

334
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,218
His death is a great loss to us.

335
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:18,221
And never did I regret
more deeply...

336
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:21,315
that I am his daughter
and not his son.

337
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,276
I will not stand
on ceremony, Ferdinand.

338
00:42:43,347 --> 00:42:47,147
Three times I have written you
on the matter of the city of Calahorra...

339
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:49,152
and have received no answer.

340
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,782
The city of Calahorra belongs to Aragon,
and I've come to claim it.

341
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:57,157
Calahorra has always been
a part of Castile.

342
00:42:57,228 --> 00:43:00,561
His Majesty, King Ferdinand,
of Castile, Leon and Asturias...

343
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,565
denies these claims.

344
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:07,661
Ramiro, King of Aragon
by the grace of God...

345
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:12,506
does this day challenge Ferdinand,
King of Castile, Leon and Asturias...

346
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:15,842
to meet him in battle
on the plains of Calahorra...

347
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:17,847
with all the forces he can command.

348
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:20,850
To the victor in this battle
and to his heirs...

349
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:23,910
the city of Calahorra
shall belong forever!

350
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:26,320
No!

351
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:31,623
All Spain is threatened
by the Moors.

352
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,358
What could give greater comfort
to the enemy...

353
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:38,368
than to see two Christian kings and their
Christian armies tear each other to bits.

354
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:41,234
Why not then let the fate
of Calahorra be determined...

355
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,705
by the outcome of a single combat...

356
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:45,834
between your champion and mine?

357
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,641
We know why you have chosen
this moment to press your claim.

358
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:51,875
Our champion is dead.

359
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:54,383
The gauntlet lies there.

360
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:58,218
Let one man come forward now,
or give up Calahorra.

361
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:01,156
Lord King!

362
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:03,193
Let me take up this gauntlet, Sire.

363
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:08,961
Why should we entrust the fate of a city...

364
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:10,967
to your inexperienced hands?

365
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:13,833
It was I who killed
your champion, Sire.

366
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,866
What man has a better claim
to his place?

367
00:44:19,944 --> 00:44:23,402
Don Martin has killed
27 men in single combat.

368
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:25,506
You know that?

369
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,642
Yes.

370
00:44:29,187 --> 00:44:31,314
Yes, Sire, I know that.

371
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:34,324
Why, then, would you risk
your life in this way?

372
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:36,622
I stand accused of treason, Sire.

373
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:40,896
And of other things.

374
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:48,101
I've not been permitted to answer
these charges. You've not judged me.

375
00:44:48,172 --> 00:44:52,131
Let me now offer myself
before the highest judge.

376
00:44:54,078 --> 00:44:56,046
If I'm guilty...

377
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:59,344
God will direct Don Martin's
lance to my heart.

378
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:03,080
If I'm innocent,
let him be my shield.

379
00:45:07,091 --> 00:45:09,753
- He's never fought before.
- He is strong, Father.

380
00:45:09,827 --> 00:45:12,295
A city, a whole city is at stake.

381
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:16,026
- He defeated our champion.
- How do we know it wasn't
from behind and in the dark?

382
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,591
- There were no witnesses.
- That is not Rodrigo's way.

383
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:28,273
Let him fight, Father.

384
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:30,610
He has much to fight for.

385
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:34,640
Rodrigo of Vivar,
take up the gauntlet.

386
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:43,992
And may God give you strength.

387
00:45:45,963 --> 00:45:48,022
May God give me strength.

388
00:46:40,284 --> 00:46:42,479
Why have you come to this place
at this hour?

389
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:47,217
We have come to do battle
for the city of Calahorra!

390
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:50,351
Will you fight to the death,
giving no quarter and receiving none?

391
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:52,362
- We will.
- We will.

392
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,955
Go, then, and fight for Calahorra.

393
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:29,431
Don Martin.
Don Martin.

394
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,593
You have always been
my father's enemy.

395
00:47:31,669 --> 00:47:35,571
Will you be his avenger?
Will you wear my colors?

396
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,700
My lady, who would not be proud
to wear your colors?

397
00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:44,680
I promise you that he
who has offended you shall die.

398
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,910
Until your triumph,
my color will be black.

399
00:47:51,355 --> 00:47:56,452
Rodrigo, the champion of Castile
cannot go into combat...

400
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:58,791
without a lady's colors.

401
00:47:58,863 --> 00:48:01,024
My lady.

402
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,389
Almighty God, now the hour
of my ordeal has come.

403
00:48:31,462 --> 00:48:36,729
Judge me and let all men
know my guilt or innocence.

404
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:06,627
Do you think Don Martin
will kill Rodrigo?

405
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:14,827
I hope he does, Your Highness.

406
00:49:16,507 --> 00:49:20,341
I'm sure you will understand
why I do not join you in that hope.

407
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:24,404
After all, we would lose a city.

408
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:17,063
He's held the first charge!
Rodrigo's held!

409
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:03,379
Kill him!

410
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:23,849
To whom does Calahorra belong?

411
00:53:25,656 --> 00:53:28,420
Calahorra belongs to Ferdinand...

412
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:31,460
and to Castile.

413
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,269
God saw fit
to give me strength, Sire.

414
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,500
Never have I seen a man fight
with greater courage.

415
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:19,974
Our Lord was surely with you.

416
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:23,240
Who can now deny that the charges
brought against you were false?

417
00:54:23,313 --> 00:54:26,009
We are deeply in your debt, Rodrigo.

418
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:28,574
You will be my champion.

419
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:40,494
Your colors are no longer black.

420
00:54:41,732 --> 00:54:44,326
Until my father is avenged...

421
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:47,199
my colors will be deepest black.

422
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:05,085
Someone will avenge me.
Someone will yet come forward.

423
00:55:05,155 --> 00:55:07,680
No. Believe me, Chimene.

424
00:55:07,758 --> 00:55:12,161
Not one knight in all Castile
will risk his life against Rodrigo.

425
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,629
He has become too dangerous.

426
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:16,825
Then why have you come to me,
Don Garcia?

427
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:21,033
This is not just a momentary anger?

428
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:23,868
You really want Rodrigo's death?

429
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:27,536
- You would fight Rodrigo?
- Not fight. Kill him.

430
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:30,079
I could fight him.

431
00:55:30,147 --> 00:55:32,342
It's not a question of courage.

432
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:45,623
Before I first saw you,
I was ready to throw my life away...

433
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:49,325
but... not now, Chimene.

434
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:53,002
To kill him?

435
00:55:54,304 --> 00:55:56,704
How?

436
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:58,764
I want your love, Chimene.

437
00:55:59,843 --> 00:56:03,540
More than I want honor,
glory, wealth.

438
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:07,147
You understand a love like that.

439
00:56:07,217 --> 00:56:10,778
Yes. Yes, I do.

440
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,024
Then I will kill him.

441
00:56:27,771 --> 00:56:29,739
Oh, Father.

442
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,909
Why did you leave me such a burden?

443
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:41,106
Rodrigo of Vivar,
you are hereby our own champion...

444
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:43,778
and the first Knight of the Realm.

445
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:46,982
With this sword,
may you vanquish all our enemies.

446
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:04,264
My lieges...

447
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:06,366
for the first time in generations...

448
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:09,537
our Moorish vassals have
refused to pay us tribute.

449
00:57:09,613 --> 00:57:13,071
They have been stirred into
unrest by the Moors of Africa.

450
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,246
An expedition, therefore,
must be sent to collect that tribute.

451
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:19,755
This expedition will be your first task.

452
00:57:21,224 --> 00:57:23,158
May I prove worthy, Sire.

453
00:57:23,226 --> 00:57:25,421
Our son, Sancho, will go with you.

454
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:27,429
May I too prove worthy, Father.

455
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:32,730
Sire, this will be
the first expedition of our Prince.

456
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:34,794
Could I, too, accompany him?

457
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:37,362
You have our permission,
Count Ordonez.

458
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:43,836
Spare our son Sancho
no hardship or danger...

459
00:57:43,914 --> 00:57:47,907
but teach him also that peace, not war,
is the real task of a king.

460
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:44,905
Lord King, by ancient custom...

461
00:58:44,975 --> 00:58:47,808
when a lord deprives a lady
of her support...

462
00:58:47,878 --> 00:58:50,608
he is himself required
to give her shelter.

463
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:55,675
I killed that lady's father.

464
00:58:55,752 --> 00:58:58,516
Therefore, if, by God's will...

465
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:01,751
I return alive from this mission...

466
00:59:01,825 --> 00:59:06,057
will you give me Dona Chimene of Gormaz
as my lawful wife...

467
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:09,690
to provide for and protect as her father
would have done?

468
00:59:09,766 --> 00:59:14,032
Yes, Rodrigo.
Let there be an end to this hatred.

469
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:18,135
The marriage will
take place on your return.

470
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:21,200
Dona Chimene will hold
herself in readiness.

471
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:46,730
In nomine Patrius et Filius
et Spiritu Sancti, amen.

472
01:00:06,256 --> 01:00:09,692
This is the man you hoped
Don Martin would kill.

473
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,752
This is the man
whose death you sought.

474
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,990
Yes, Your Highness?

475
01:00:15,065 --> 01:00:17,590
Would you then still
accept this marriage?

476
01:00:19,336 --> 01:00:22,499
If it is the King's order,
I must obey.

477
01:01:41,651 --> 01:01:44,085
My Cid, beware!

478
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:10,636
Stop him!

479
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:36,103
My Lord Moutamin.

480
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:38,333
My Lord Cid.

481
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:40,342
You came in good time this day.

482
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,571
Praise be to Allah.

483
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:45,740
You were betrayed by one
of your own, my Lord Cid.

484
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:49,512
Betrayed by a Christian,
saved by a Moor.

485
01:02:51,054 --> 01:02:53,488
You've earned
the enmity of your people.

486
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:56,081
It was no more than
my Cid did for me.

487
01:02:57,894 --> 01:03:00,089
If ever you have need of me.

488
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:02,097
If ever you
have need of me.

489
01:03:23,753 --> 01:03:25,744
Ordonez.

490
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,294
Before I die, I want you to know
that the woman you love...

491
01:03:32,362 --> 01:03:36,059
offered herself to me
if I would kill you.

492
01:03:47,444 --> 01:03:49,571
Kill him!

493
01:03:49,646 --> 01:03:52,376
Kill him!
He betrayed us!

494
01:04:02,775 --> 01:04:06,654
No. Let him go.

495
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:09,722
- They will say I was too soft.
- You will soon be a king!

496
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:12,029
You must learn to think like one.

497
01:04:12,102 --> 01:04:14,900
Any man can kill.

498
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:17,496
Only a king can give life.

499
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,685
I want no more blood on my marriage.

500
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,614
Volo.

501
01:05:14,898 --> 01:05:18,834
Why doesn't she speak?

502
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,788
Volo.

503
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:17,325
Will my lady take a little wine?

504
01:06:17,393 --> 01:06:20,328
It is a very good wine,
especially brought from Vivar.

505
01:06:20,396 --> 01:06:22,330
I thank you, Fanez. No.

506
01:06:27,137 --> 01:06:30,573
All night long you've been telling
my lady how good everything is...

507
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,337
- because it comes from Vivar.
- Well, it is good.

508
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,856
You will see for yourself, my lady,
when you come to Vivar.

509
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:52,020
It is such...
such a happy place.

510
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:55,030
- Is it, Fanez?
- Oh, yes, my lady.

511
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:58,499
It's impossible
to be there without...

512
01:06:58,568 --> 01:07:00,502
feeling it.

513
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:15,246
I... I think
my lord and lady must be tired.

514
01:07:15,318 --> 01:07:17,252
Yes!

515
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,255
Good night, my lord, my lady.

516
01:07:20,323 --> 01:07:23,759
Good night, and may this night
be the most, uh...

517
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:26,761
I mean, may you have, uh...

518
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:29,798
Good night, my lord and lady.
Good night.

519
01:07:57,493 --> 01:08:01,896
Since I've taken the vows of wife...

520
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:06,265
and since there must be nothing hidden
between man and wife...

521
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:09,396
there is something
I wish to tell you.

522
01:08:09,472 --> 01:08:13,408
Sometimes it's best to leave
a little something hidden...

523
01:08:13,476 --> 01:08:15,910
even between man and wife.

524
01:08:17,046 --> 01:08:20,072
They say each unspoken thought...

525
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:22,447
becomes a small ghost.

526
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:25,453
We have room for a few small ghosts.

527
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:32,184
I knew Ordonez would betray you.

528
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,463
We planned your death...

529
01:08:40,536 --> 01:08:42,470
together.

530
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,795
Chimene, I knew
you'd planned to kill me.

531
01:12:29,098 --> 01:12:31,032
Ordonez told me.

532
01:12:34,904 --> 01:12:37,031
I never hoped...

533
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:41,372
our marriage would bring
your love back quickly.

534
01:12:43,379 --> 01:12:46,314
I did hope it would end your hate...

535
01:12:46,382 --> 01:12:48,316
and that...

536
01:12:48,384 --> 01:12:50,944
then somehow...

537
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:53,955
Chimene.

538
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,940
Do you know why
I married you, Rodrigo?

539
01:13:13,376 --> 01:13:18,143
It was the only way left
for me to avenge my father.

540
01:13:19,282 --> 01:13:22,217
It is true that if you want me...

541
01:13:22,285 --> 01:13:25,652
it is your right
as my husband to take me.

542
01:13:25,721 --> 01:13:29,987
But you will never get
a woman's love from me.

543
01:13:39,201 --> 01:13:41,829
Perhaps we have...

544
01:13:41,904 --> 01:13:43,838
wounded each other too deeply.

545
01:15:14,196 --> 01:15:16,596
Chimene.

546
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:18,600
Is it our Chimene?

547
01:15:19,902 --> 01:15:22,200
Yes, Reverend Mother.

548
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:24,899
It's Chimene.

549
01:15:24,974 --> 01:15:27,101
Why have you come back to us?

550
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:34,105
I've come to find peace, Mother.

551
01:15:34,183 --> 01:15:37,118
After all that has happened to you...

552
01:15:37,186 --> 01:15:40,212
the peace you seek
is not within these walls.

553
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:43,122
You were made
for the world, Chimene.

554
01:15:43,192 --> 01:15:46,127
One day you will want
to go back to it.

555
01:15:46,195 --> 01:15:48,891
But you may remain with us...

556
01:15:48,964 --> 01:15:50,898
until you feel you must leave.

557
01:16:59,435 --> 01:17:02,370
Why do they not hail me king?

558
01:17:02,438 --> 01:17:04,872
Because you are not the king.

559
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,874
The kingdom has been divided.

560
01:17:06,942 --> 01:17:10,378
- Liar.
- Father proclaimed before he died
that Castile is yours...

561
01:17:10,446 --> 01:17:12,880
- but Asturias and Leon go to me!
- Liar!

562
01:17:12,948 --> 01:17:17,476
- And to our sister Urraca
the walled city of Calahorra.
- No! I am the eldest.

563
01:17:17,553 --> 01:17:20,852
'Tis my birthright.
The kingdom will not be divided!

564
01:17:24,593 --> 01:17:28,552
You can't stop it now.
I am King of Asturias and Leon.

565
01:17:28,631 --> 01:17:32,067
- I won't let you stand in my way.
- I am the eldest son!

566
01:17:32,134 --> 01:17:35,069
I'll have the Triple Crown
or none at all!

567
01:17:39,175 --> 01:17:41,609
Then let it be none at all.

568
01:17:53,556 --> 01:17:56,525
It was you and Urraca against me.

569
01:17:58,294 --> 01:18:01,991
Father was old.
She worked on him!

570
01:18:02,064 --> 01:18:05,830
You're no better than we are,
just because you're the firstborn.

571
01:18:12,641 --> 01:18:15,235
You and our sister.

572
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:17,745
It was always you and our sister.

573
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:21,749
You... held her too close!

574
01:18:21,817 --> 01:18:24,081
You covet her!

575
01:18:24,153 --> 01:18:26,018
You lie!

576
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:04,759
Sancho, no!

577
01:19:16,872 --> 01:19:20,273
He thought he could be king.

578
01:19:26,482 --> 01:19:29,610
Accompany His Highness
to his new kingdom...

579
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:32,745
the dungeon of Zamora.

580
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:07,176
Will you give me your prisoner,
or must I take him?

581
01:21:07,249 --> 01:21:10,707
There are 13 of us
and you are alone.

582
01:21:10,786 --> 01:21:13,346
What you do is against God's law.

583
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:17,381
Were you 13 times 13
I would not be alone.

584
01:22:45,814 --> 01:22:48,510
What kind of a man are you?

585
01:22:48,584 --> 01:22:50,518
Come.

586
01:22:52,187 --> 01:22:55,384
We'll go to your sister at Calahorra.

587
01:24:07,162 --> 01:24:09,562
Open the gates of Valencia...

588
01:24:09,631 --> 01:24:11,565
in the name of Allah!

589
01:24:13,468 --> 01:24:16,904
<i>And the time came
when Ben Yusuf rode to Valencia...</i>

590
01:24:16,972 --> 01:24:21,068
<i>to secure the aid of the frightened
Moorish king Al Kadir.</i>

591
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:24,670
<i>He had to make certain that
he could land his mighty armada...</i>

592
01:24:24,746 --> 01:24:26,714
<i>on the shores of Spain.</i>

593
01:25:22,337 --> 01:25:23,998
Clear out, all of you!

594
01:25:28,944 --> 01:25:32,209
My lord Ben Yusuf, what an honor.

595
01:25:32,281 --> 01:25:34,306
What an honor.

596
01:25:35,717 --> 01:25:38,880
Allah be praised.
Our moment has come.

597
01:25:38,954 --> 01:25:40,888
King Ferdinand has died...

598
01:25:40,956 --> 01:25:43,390
and the two young kings
have quarreled.

599
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,858
Allah, in his wisdom,
has willed it so.

600
01:25:45,927 --> 01:25:48,657
And now Allah will ordain it
so that one Christian brother...

601
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:50,664
will kill another Christian brother.

602
01:25:50,732 --> 01:25:53,064
How will this happen?

603
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:58,496
He... will do the killing.

604
01:25:58,573 --> 01:26:01,508
The word will spread that
brother has killed brother.

605
01:26:01,576 --> 01:26:03,510
There will be confusion, revolution.

606
01:26:03,578 --> 01:26:05,512
The kingdom will be torn in two...

607
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,515
and then, when they are most weak,
I will bring my legions from Africa.

608
01:26:09,584 --> 01:26:11,381
A master strategy.

609
01:26:11,453 --> 01:26:14,854
When I land, they may attack you
here at Valencia.

610
01:26:14,923 --> 01:26:19,690
If they do, you will hold Valencia.
Do you understand me?

611
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:22,730
Yes, my lord, I understand.

612
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:28,928
I will leave my guards with you
to make certain you understand.

613
01:27:13,515 --> 01:27:15,449
Don't let him take me, Urraca.

614
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,654
Go.

615
01:27:20,722 --> 01:27:22,656
Go.

616
01:27:22,724 --> 01:27:24,658
Urraca!

617
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:27,995
Urraca!

618
01:27:30,165 --> 01:27:32,292
Urraca!

619
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:36,496
Urraca!

620
01:27:36,571 --> 01:27:39,005
You have given refuge to my brother!

621
01:27:39,074 --> 01:27:41,099
I demand you release him at once!

622
01:27:41,176 --> 01:27:44,839
This is my city!
You do not demand!

623
01:27:44,913 --> 01:27:47,780
Release the prisoner at once
or my army will attack!

624
01:27:47,849 --> 01:27:51,285
Alfonso stays here...
with me!

625
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:54,117
I give you until dawn to decide.

626
01:27:55,957 --> 01:27:58,357
My lady.

627
01:27:59,961 --> 01:28:02,896
What would it be worth to you...

628
01:28:02,964 --> 01:28:06,263
if Sancho were kept from your gates?

629
01:28:08,003 --> 01:28:11,564
Who is there
who could do such a thing?

630
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,733
I could.

631
01:28:13,809 --> 01:28:17,540
Only... Only I would ask a great deal.

632
01:28:33,495 --> 01:28:35,929
Thank heaven you answered our call.

633
01:28:35,997 --> 01:28:38,090
Why did you send it, sir?

634
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:40,100
Unless I surrender to Sancho...

635
01:28:40,168 --> 01:28:43,604
- he threatens to lay siege to us by morning.

636
01:28:43,672 --> 01:28:45,606
Help us, Rodrigo.

637
01:28:47,209 --> 01:28:49,302
When brother
fights against brother...

638
01:28:49,377 --> 01:28:51,504
what can any man do?

639
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:54,708
If you joined us,
many knights would come.

640
01:28:56,284 --> 01:28:58,912
I swore allegiance to Sancho.

641
01:28:59,988 --> 01:29:02,980
And to Alfonso.
And to me!

642
01:29:03,058 --> 01:29:07,461
I can only help one brother
by breaking faith with the other.

643
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:12,493
- I can help no one.
- But Sancho would kill Alfonso.

644
01:29:14,236 --> 01:29:16,602
Whatever happens...

645
01:29:16,671 --> 01:29:18,605
must happen without me.

646
01:30:13,929 --> 01:30:15,988
Sanctuary!

647
01:30:21,736 --> 01:30:24,671
Sanctuary!

648
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,937
Sanctuary!

649
01:30:41,222 --> 01:30:43,986
What do you want here, Dolfos?

650
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:48,754
I have words
for your ears only, my King.

651
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:10,475
Well?

652
01:31:10,552 --> 01:31:13,749
There is a way Calahorra
could be taken without a blow.

653
01:31:13,822 --> 01:31:15,790
I will help you.

654
01:31:17,325 --> 01:31:19,259
Why should you do this for me?

655
01:31:19,327 --> 01:31:22,819
I will not stand by and see our land
torn by civil war.

656
01:31:29,904 --> 01:31:31,838
Tell me.

657
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:36,700
I know where
there is an unguarded gate.

658
01:31:36,778 --> 01:31:40,009
I will take you there.
With a few men, you...

659
01:31:41,182 --> 01:31:44,117
Even though my father
trusted you, Dolfos...

660
01:31:46,988 --> 01:31:48,922
one false move...

661
01:31:50,692 --> 01:31:53,923
But I am unarmed, Sire.

662
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:00,260
Show me this gate.

663
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,636
From here it will be better
to go on foot.

664
01:32:45,313 --> 01:32:48,248
I see no gate.

665
01:32:48,316 --> 01:32:50,750
There.
Around the corner.

666
01:33:28,356 --> 01:33:30,290
Open!
Open the gate!

667
01:33:30,358 --> 01:33:32,292
Open the gate!
Open the...

668
01:33:47,742 --> 01:33:50,176
Confess me.

669
01:33:50,245 --> 01:33:53,043
Confess me.
Confess me!

670
01:33:53,114 --> 01:33:56,379
Sancho.

671
01:33:58,253 --> 01:34:01,279
- Rodrigo.
- My poor Sancho.

672
01:34:03,358 --> 01:34:06,589
I was almost a king.

673
01:34:06,661 --> 01:34:08,822
Wasn't I?

674
01:34:08,897 --> 01:34:10,956
You are a king, my lord.

675
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:02,240
I have not come here as a queen.

676
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,754
Forgive me, Your Highness.

677
01:35:16,364 --> 01:35:19,094
You still love Rodrigo.

678
01:35:20,435 --> 01:35:23,700
And I know Rodrigo still loves you.

679
01:35:23,771 --> 01:35:27,298
You have made a long
and hard journey to come here.

680
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:29,969
Rodrigo must be stopped!

681
01:35:33,081 --> 01:35:36,016
We will not permit this,
Alfonso and I!

682
01:35:38,186 --> 01:35:40,654
Rodrigo will listen to you.

683
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:45,118
What is it I must tell Rodrigo,
Your Highness?

684
01:35:47,295 --> 01:35:50,230
He has threatened to force
Alfonso to swear publicly...

685
01:35:50,298 --> 01:35:53,392
that he is innocent of
our brother Sancho's death.

686
01:35:53,468 --> 01:35:56,596
Is he not innocent
of your brother's death?

687
01:35:56,671 --> 01:35:59,606
You must tell him not to do this.

688
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:02,837
He must not. We will not permit it!
We will stop him!

689
01:36:07,982 --> 01:36:11,474
You... had better speak to him.

690
01:36:11,552 --> 01:36:13,486
Do you understand me, Chimene?

691
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:17,954
I understand, Your Highness.

692
01:36:22,363 --> 01:36:26,299
No one can ask a king to swear.
No one!

693
01:38:12,306 --> 01:38:17,266
Before God and this assembly...

694
01:38:17,345 --> 01:38:21,782
I do freely forgive those
who have warred against me.

695
01:38:21,849 --> 01:38:26,445
I promise to defend them
and to show them favor...

696
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:30,958
even as I defend and show favor
to those that were ever loyal to me.

697
01:38:31,025 --> 01:38:34,119
This, my written oath...

698
01:38:34,195 --> 01:38:36,925
I entrust to this Holy Church.

699
01:38:41,269 --> 01:38:44,033
Castilians...

700
01:38:44,105 --> 01:38:48,269
God has called upon me
to become your king.

701
01:38:48,342 --> 01:38:52,904
I now call upon you
to kneel in sign of fealty.

702
01:39:18,005 --> 01:39:20,269
Rodrigo of Vivar...

703
01:39:20,341 --> 01:39:22,639
called the Cid...

704
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:25,838
why do you alone refuse me fealty?

705
01:39:28,015 --> 01:39:29,949
Sire...

706
01:39:30,017 --> 01:39:32,542
all those you see here...

707
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:35,180
though none dares say so...

708
01:39:35,256 --> 01:39:39,352
harbor the suspicion that you may have
counseled your own brother's death.

709
01:39:39,427 --> 01:39:42,362
Unless you can prove
your innocence...

710
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:44,557
you will have no loyal subjects.

711
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:48,124
Your kingdom will be torn by doubt.

712
01:39:48,202 --> 01:39:51,296
Thus I cannot give you fealty...

713
01:39:51,372 --> 01:39:53,806
nor own you as my liege.

714
01:39:54,909 --> 01:39:57,241
What will satisfy you
of my innocence?

715
01:39:57,311 --> 01:40:00,075
Your oath upon the holy book.

716
01:40:02,783 --> 01:40:05,718
You would ask me to swear?

717
01:40:06,954 --> 01:40:11,050
Sire, I do ask it.

718
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:19,293
Very well.

719
01:40:28,009 --> 01:40:30,944
Will you swear
that you had no part...

720
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:33,947
in the ordering
of King Sancho's death?

721
01:40:40,188 --> 01:40:42,554
I so swear.

722
01:40:42,623 --> 01:40:46,753
Do you swear that you had no part
by way of counsel...

723
01:40:46,827 --> 01:40:48,761
in King Sancho's death?

724
01:40:48,829 --> 01:40:50,956
I so swear.

725
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:54,627
Do you swear that you had no part
by way of design...

726
01:40:54,702 --> 01:40:56,761
in King Sancho's death?

727
01:40:57,838 --> 01:41:00,136
I swear it!

728
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,142
If you are forsworn...

729
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:06,203
may you die such a death
as your brother did...

730
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,215
struck from behind
by the hand of a traitor.

731
01:41:09,283 --> 01:41:12,719
Say amen.

732
01:41:12,787 --> 01:41:15,221
You press me too far, Rodrigo.

733
01:41:17,658 --> 01:41:19,819
Say amen.

734
01:41:30,805 --> 01:41:32,500
Amen.

735
01:42:20,254 --> 01:42:23,690
"By edict of our most illustrious
Sovereign Alfonso...

736
01:42:23,758 --> 01:42:26,693
"King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...

737
01:42:26,761 --> 01:42:29,787
"be it known
that Rodrigo of Vivar...

738
01:42:29,864 --> 01:42:34,460
"has outraged the Royal Personage
and is hereby exiled for life.

739
01:42:34,535 --> 01:42:37,971
"He has been accorded
nine days from this day...

740
01:42:38,039 --> 01:42:42,976
"in which to depart from the realm,
alone and without men at arms.

741
01:42:43,044 --> 01:42:47,242
"All his property, his goods,
his lands and his privileges...

742
01:42:47,315 --> 01:42:50,978
"are hereby forfeit to the Crown.

743
01:42:51,052 --> 01:42:53,418
"All vessels of the King...

744
01:42:53,487 --> 01:42:57,787
"are forbidden to provide him with food,
lodging or any means of sustenance...

745
01:42:57,858 --> 01:42:59,792
"or to speak with him.

746
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:02,158
Let no man give him aid."

747
01:44:01,255 --> 01:44:03,189
I thirst.

748
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:07,626
I thirst.

749
01:44:07,695 --> 01:44:11,256
I thirst.
Lord Knight, I thirst.

750
01:44:16,504 --> 01:44:21,134
There is no spring nearby
from which a leper is allowed to drink.

751
01:44:21,208 --> 01:44:23,938
I'm thirsty.

752
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:40,554
Here.

753
01:44:40,628 --> 01:44:42,562
It's for you.

754
01:44:43,831 --> 01:44:45,992
For you.

755
01:44:46,066 --> 01:44:50,298
- Thank you, my Cid.
- How do you know my name?

756
01:44:50,371 --> 01:44:54,239
There is only one man in Spain
who could humble a king...

757
01:44:54,308 --> 01:44:57,607
<i>and would give a leper
to drink from his own pouch.</i>

758
01:44:57,678 --> 01:44:59,703
Who are you?

759
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:01,714
I am called Lazarus.

760
01:45:03,317 --> 01:45:06,411
May helping hands
be extended to you...

761
01:45:06,487 --> 01:45:09,422
everywhere you go, my Cid.

762
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:45,582
Can you forgive me, Rodrigo?

763
01:45:48,362 --> 01:45:50,592
Chimene.

764
01:45:53,834 --> 01:45:56,268
Would you take me with you?

765
01:45:57,938 --> 01:46:01,237
But... now I...

766
01:46:01,308 --> 01:46:03,242
have nowhere to take you.

767
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:05,244
If we are together...

768
01:46:05,312 --> 01:46:08,247
it will not be nowhere.

769
01:46:14,555 --> 01:46:16,489
I love you, Rodrigo.

770
01:46:18,726 --> 01:46:20,694
I love you.

771
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:49,382
You know what you risk...

772
01:46:49,456 --> 01:46:52,118
if you come with me, my love?

773
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:57,629
Since my love is not a man
like other men...

774
01:46:57,698 --> 01:47:01,134
my life will not be
like other lives.

775
01:47:05,973 --> 01:47:08,908
It's only now...

776
01:47:08,976 --> 01:47:11,911
only now that I know...

777
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:15,415
how hard the road
would've been without you.

778
01:48:03,263 --> 01:48:06,790
Are you the one they call the Cid?

779
01:48:06,867 --> 01:48:08,835
Yes.

780
01:48:08,902 --> 01:48:12,303
Then you must be
the beautiful Chimene.

781
01:48:12,373 --> 01:48:15,740
Do you not hate him anymore?

782
01:48:15,809 --> 01:48:17,743
No, I do not.

783
01:48:17,811 --> 01:48:22,248
My father says they'll cut our hands off
if we help you.

784
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:26,678
My father says
they have eyes everywhere.

785
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:38,526
But my father said if you walk very slowly
it will soon be dark...

786
01:48:38,599 --> 01:48:42,194
and no one will be able to see you
if you go into our barn.

787
01:49:54,374 --> 01:49:57,309
I suppose we must leave soon...

788
01:49:57,377 --> 01:49:59,311
before it gets too light.

789
01:49:59,379 --> 01:50:01,711
No, one more moment...

790
01:50:01,782 --> 01:50:04,216
to remember all of this.

791
01:50:05,652 --> 01:50:10,089
Have you ever slept in
a more beautiful bedchamber?

792
01:50:10,157 --> 01:50:12,091
Never.

793
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:16,323
- Have you ever eaten better food?
- No.

794
01:50:16,396 --> 01:50:18,728
Nor drunk better wine, nor...

795
01:50:22,536 --> 01:50:25,334
I love you.

796
01:50:25,405 --> 01:50:29,000
Dona Chimene, my wife.

797
01:50:29,076 --> 01:50:31,909
I'm so glad, Rodrigo.

798
01:50:31,979 --> 01:50:33,913
So glad.

799
01:50:38,819 --> 01:50:40,753
Must we go?

800
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,327
Of what are you glad?

801
01:50:55,402 --> 01:50:58,667
That you are no longer
the King's champion...

802
01:50:58,739 --> 01:51:02,800
that you no longer have
your knights and your armies...

803
01:51:02,876 --> 01:51:05,140
and that you have only me.

804
01:51:07,314 --> 01:51:10,806
We will find some hidden place
where you are not known.

805
01:51:10,884 --> 01:51:14,251
Yes, a place like this.

806
01:51:14,321 --> 01:51:17,222
And we will make our lives there.

807
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:20,226
If all men knew that banishment
could be like this...

808
01:51:20,294 --> 01:51:22,228
we'd have a world of exiles.

809
01:51:29,503 --> 01:51:31,437
Come.

810
01:51:31,505 --> 01:51:34,474
We'll look for your hidden place...

811
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:36,600
before the others find it.

812
01:51:45,886 --> 01:51:47,820
We'll have a new life now.

813
01:51:57,598 --> 01:51:59,964
Lord God...

814
01:52:00,033 --> 01:52:03,002
protect this woman I love...

815
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:07,006
and who is now, finally, my wife.

816
01:52:15,148 --> 01:52:18,083
El Cid!

817
01:52:39,172 --> 01:52:41,106
I am in exile!

818
01:52:41,174 --> 01:52:44,075
Without you, we are all in exile.

819
01:52:44,144 --> 01:52:46,578
I can't take you with me!

820
01:52:46,647 --> 01:52:50,083
You'd lose your homes,
your families!

821
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:53,984
Every man here has
already made the choice.

822
01:52:54,054 --> 01:52:55,988
We want you to lead us!

823
01:52:56,056 --> 01:52:58,251
You have no right to ask him!

824
01:52:58,325 --> 01:53:00,293
He has done enough!

825
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:03,454
- El Cid!
- El Cid!

826
01:53:23,951 --> 01:53:26,078
But why him?

827
01:53:26,153 --> 01:53:28,678
Why?

828
01:53:28,755 --> 01:53:32,191
For Spain!

829
01:53:33,593 --> 01:53:35,527
Spain!

830
01:54:03,724 --> 01:54:06,215
Urraca!

831
01:54:13,066 --> 01:54:15,091
I haven't slept all night.

832
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:21,207
Every time I close my eyes to sleep...

833
01:54:21,274 --> 01:54:24,766
I dream the same dream
over and over.

834
01:54:30,183 --> 01:54:33,778
I'm fighting an enemy
whose face I can never see.

835
01:54:33,854 --> 01:54:37,381
I cut him down
with my broadsword, he falls.

836
01:54:37,457 --> 01:54:40,483
But when I look down...

837
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,688
it isn't my enemy lying at my feet.

838
01:54:43,764 --> 01:54:45,755
It's...

839
01:54:49,669 --> 01:54:52,103
It's my own right arm.

840
01:54:56,076 --> 01:54:59,375
It was only a dream.

841
01:54:59,446 --> 01:55:00,380
It was nothing.

842
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:01,369
It was nothing.

843
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:57,395
- Our dream was short.
- I know.

844
01:55:57,471 --> 01:56:00,998
There is no hidden place
for a man like you.

845
01:56:05,779 --> 01:56:09,271
There must be thousands
who would gladly part.

846
01:56:12,352 --> 01:56:14,877
Why you?

847
01:56:14,955 --> 01:56:16,889
Why me?

848
01:56:16,957 --> 01:56:21,018
Please, let me carry away
an image of you smiling.

849
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:25,564
It would be a lie.

850
01:56:27,267 --> 01:56:30,759
I will beseech God with my prayers.

851
01:56:30,837 --> 01:56:33,772
I will tell Him He must
bring you back to me.

852
01:56:37,644 --> 01:56:41,045
I must tell God how much I need you.

853
01:56:42,115 --> 01:56:45,551
Then we will see each other again.

854
02:02:16,923 --> 02:02:20,256
Don Rodrigo.

855
02:02:25,999 --> 02:02:30,595
We have not forgotten or forgiven
the wrong you did our Royal person.

856
02:02:30,671 --> 02:02:33,367
But when danger threatens,
it is a king's duty...

857
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:36,375
to put the welfare of his subjects
above all else.

858
02:02:36,443 --> 02:02:39,071
That is why we summoned you here.

859
02:02:40,714 --> 02:02:43,182
Sire, I have all these years lived...

860
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:46,185
in the hope Your Majesty
would call me.

861
02:02:46,688 --> 02:02:50,624
Especially now, since Ben Yusuf
has landed on our shores.

862
02:02:53,528 --> 02:02:57,464
Ben Yusuf has challenged us to meet him
on the plains of Sagrajas.

863
02:02:59,801 --> 02:03:02,793
Sire, you must not fight at Sagrajas.

864
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:06,306
- Valencia must first be...
- We have already accepted the challenge.

865
02:03:06,374 --> 02:03:10,743
My liege, you must first
take Valencia.

866
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,906
While the Moors hold Valencia...

867
02:03:15,983 --> 02:03:19,419
Ben Yusuf can strike out from there,
overrun all Spain.

868
02:03:22,023 --> 02:03:26,960
Your Majesty must not
let this happen.

869
02:03:27,028 --> 02:03:30,964
Look, I have brought friends
to help you in this fight.

870
02:03:50,118 --> 02:03:53,679
How dare they not kneel to us?

871
02:03:53,755 --> 02:03:56,315
Sire.

872
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:58,325
These are kings.

873
02:03:58,393 --> 02:04:00,793
They come here as allies.

874
02:04:00,862 --> 02:04:04,298
- We need no such allies.
- We are a Christian kingdom!

875
02:04:04,365 --> 02:04:06,299
We treat only with Christians.

876
02:04:06,367 --> 02:04:09,302
They're ready to fight
at your side for Valencia.

877
02:04:09,370 --> 02:04:12,464
They fear Ben Yusuf as we do.
They are your friends.

878
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:14,633
We do not consider them friends.

879
02:04:17,111 --> 02:04:18,976
Sire!

880
02:04:20,047 --> 02:04:23,107
You risk having no Spain at all!

881
02:04:24,619 --> 02:04:28,555
Don Rodrigo,
you will join us at Sagrajas...

882
02:04:28,623 --> 02:04:32,184
and we shall annul your banishment
and return your lands.

883
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:34,922
But if you are not at Sagrajas...

884
02:04:34,996 --> 02:04:38,591
we shall consider
you and yours our enemies!

885
02:04:57,285 --> 02:05:01,722
Don Rodrigo.
I know why you have come.

886
02:05:13,468 --> 02:05:16,904
Your twin daughters
are playing in the garden here.

887
02:07:04,345 --> 02:07:06,279
This is your father.

888
02:07:13,354 --> 02:07:15,288
You're Elvira?

889
02:07:16,891 --> 02:07:19,655
Then you must be Sol.

890
02:07:19,727 --> 02:07:21,661
You're Elvira.

891
02:07:23,965 --> 02:07:25,899
You're exactly alike.

892
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:42,981
I'm tired.

893
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,984
Tired of exile.

894
02:07:48,556 --> 02:07:52,424
Now I can take you home to Vivar...

895
02:07:52,493 --> 02:07:54,427
with honors.

896
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:01,334
I might be wrong to defy the King.

897
02:08:03,437 --> 02:08:07,032
He commanded me
to meet him at Sagrajas.

898
02:08:07,108 --> 02:08:09,042
I could be wrong.

899
02:08:09,110 --> 02:08:11,635
If you did not have us, Rodrigo...

900
02:08:11,712 --> 02:08:13,646
would you even wonder?

901
02:08:17,752 --> 02:08:21,688
I used to see so many
of your hidden places...

902
02:08:21,756 --> 02:08:24,190
where I could've lived with you.

903
02:08:24,258 --> 02:08:26,385
And no one would have known.

904
02:08:27,461 --> 02:08:29,588
Have you also found a place...

905
02:08:29,664 --> 02:08:32,531
where we could hide from ourselves?

906
02:08:34,835 --> 02:08:37,235
I can't leave you...

907
02:08:37,304 --> 02:08:41,297
leave them here unprotected.

908
02:08:45,479 --> 02:08:49,506
But if you do what must be done
for all Spain...

909
02:08:49,583 --> 02:08:52,017
that will be our best protection.

910
02:10:15,169 --> 02:10:18,605
Our Moorish silks suit well
your Christian armor.

911
02:10:27,848 --> 02:10:31,284
You'll make a Moslem of me yet, my lord.

912
02:10:37,124 --> 02:10:40,059
How can anyone say this is wrong?

913
02:10:40,127 --> 02:10:43,563
They will say so, on both sides.

914
02:10:51,405 --> 02:10:55,739
We have so much to give to
each other and to Spain.

915
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:58,244
If we are not destroyed first.

916
02:10:59,847 --> 02:11:03,806
Once we take Valencia,
then let Ben Yusuf try.

917
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:05,304
Valencia is surrounded.

918
02:12:05,379 --> 02:12:10,316
No one here can leave
the city or enter it.

919
02:12:10,384 --> 02:12:13,615
Then our weapon is starvation.

920
02:12:13,687 --> 02:12:18,351
May Allah make
the siege a short one.

921
02:12:18,425 --> 02:12:22,361
May God help our King Alfonso
at Sagrajas.

922
02:13:01,101 --> 02:13:03,899
We could have beaten Ben Yusuf!

923
02:13:03,971 --> 02:13:07,463
With a few more men
we could have won!

924
02:13:17,518 --> 02:13:20,419
A handful of knights
and victory would have been ours.

925
02:13:23,157 --> 02:13:28,527
Dona Chimene, did you think we would permit
your husband to go unpunished?

926
02:13:28,595 --> 02:13:33,032
Would you punish the man
who is now Spain's only hope?

927
02:13:36,637 --> 02:13:40,596
What if we were to place Dona Chimene
and her children in our deepest dungeons?

928
02:13:40,674 --> 02:13:44,508
Might not the Cid then deliver himself
into our hands?

929
02:13:44,578 --> 02:13:47,672
Sire, this is a sanctuary.

930
02:13:47,748 --> 02:13:50,080
There are no sanctuaries
for the enemies of Christ!

931
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:54,177
If you crush him, who then would stand
against the invaders of Spain?

932
02:13:54,254 --> 02:13:58,782
It was his fault! If he had come,
we would have won.

933
02:13:58,859 --> 02:14:00,793
Sire?

934
02:14:04,365 --> 02:14:07,960
It was not for lack
of courage that we lost.

935
02:14:08,035 --> 02:14:10,367
You shall see.

936
02:14:25,619 --> 02:14:30,921
You saw!
I made no sound!

937
02:14:30,991 --> 02:14:35,052
It was not through lack
of courage that we lost!

938
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:43,598
It takes more than courage
to make a king.

939
02:15:11,298 --> 02:15:13,390
Tell me his exact words!

940
02:15:13,467 --> 02:15:19,235
The King said he would not release
Chimene and the children.

941
02:15:20,874 --> 02:15:23,604
What does the King expect I'd do?

942
02:15:23,677 --> 02:15:27,010
That I would let my wife and children
die in his dungeons?

943
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:31,950
No! He hopes you will march
on Burgos to rescue her.

944
02:15:33,754 --> 02:15:39,522
Burgos! Well, then,
shall we disappoint our King?

945
02:15:41,595 --> 02:15:45,361
What do we wait here for?
To Burgos!

946
02:15:50,204 --> 02:15:52,900
My Lord Cid, wait!

947
02:15:52,973 --> 02:15:55,999
My lord, the city is ready to fall.

948
02:15:56,076 --> 02:15:59,045
More and more people
are coming over to our side.

949
02:15:59,113 --> 02:16:02,241
After all these months,
we cannot leave!

950
02:16:02,316 --> 02:16:05,580
Don't speak to me of Valencia,
my Lord Moutamin.

951
02:16:06,355 --> 02:16:07,725
Not now!

952
02:16:09,456 --> 02:16:12,914
Am I not a man, too, like you?

953
02:16:12,993 --> 02:16:17,692
May I not sometimes
think of my wife? My children?

954
02:16:17,764 --> 02:16:21,860
Well, then, what must I do?

955
02:16:21,935 --> 02:16:24,563
What must I do?

956
02:16:36,483 --> 02:16:39,543
Everything was taken from you.

957
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:43,818
How did you bribe the jailer
to bring me your message?

958
02:16:43,891 --> 02:16:46,758
With two words: The Cid.

959
02:16:50,998 --> 02:16:53,967
Even all these months
in the dungeon...

960
02:16:54,034 --> 02:16:56,832
have not marred your beauty.

961
02:17:00,774 --> 02:17:03,004
There are terrible rumors.

962
02:17:03,076 --> 02:17:05,977
They are not rumors.

963
02:17:06,046 --> 02:17:09,641
The Cid has sent
an ultimatum to the King.

964
02:17:09,716 --> 02:17:12,742
Unless you and the children
are released at once...

965
02:17:12,819 --> 02:17:16,448
your husband will march
against us here.

966
02:17:18,458 --> 02:17:22,792
Abandon Valencia?
Leave all Spain unprotected?

967
02:17:22,863 --> 02:17:28,028
Yes, Chimene, for you.
Why not?

968
02:17:32,739 --> 02:17:36,140
Help me and the children to escape.
Come with us.

969
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:38,940
Join Rodrigo.

970
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:54,324
If I thought it would stop him
from coming here...

971
02:17:54,394 --> 02:17:57,659
I would kill myself...

972
02:17:58,732 --> 02:18:01,166
and the children.

973
02:18:03,870 --> 02:18:08,000
Then your love
is as desperate as mine.

974
02:18:59,326 --> 02:19:03,592
Rodrigo, let me fight at your side.

975
02:19:12,272 --> 02:19:15,105
We have need of such men.

976
02:19:54,481 --> 02:19:58,884
Count Ordonez,
we must attack tonight.

977
02:23:08,608 --> 02:23:11,771
Soldiers!

978
02:23:11,845 --> 02:23:14,973
Citizens of Valencia!

979
02:23:16,116 --> 02:23:18,846
We have starved you!

980
02:23:18,919 --> 02:23:21,786
Now you are weak!

981
02:23:21,855 --> 02:23:25,347
But we do not wish to attack you!

982
02:23:25,425 --> 02:23:28,826
We are not your enemies!

983
02:23:28,895 --> 02:23:32,126
Ben Yusuf is your enemy.

984
02:23:32,198 --> 02:23:36,726
He will bring you
death and destruction!

985
02:23:36,803 --> 02:23:40,034
People of Valencia...

986
02:23:40,106 --> 02:23:43,075
rid yourselves of your leaders!

987
02:23:43,143 --> 02:23:46,237
Join with us!

988
02:23:46,313 --> 02:23:48,372
We bring you peace!

989
02:23:48,448 --> 02:23:52,475
Soldiers and citizens!

990
02:23:52,552 --> 02:23:57,683
We bring you freedom!
We bring you life!

991
02:23:57,757 --> 02:24:00,692
We bring you... bread!

992
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:03,058
We bring you bread! Bread!

993
02:24:03,129 --> 02:24:06,223
Bread! Bread!

994
02:24:06,299 --> 02:24:09,598
Bread! Bread!

995
02:24:29,456 --> 02:24:33,654
My lord!
El Cid is throwing them food!

996
02:24:33,727 --> 02:24:37,094
Your starving soldiers have deserted
the walls and joined the people!

997
02:24:37,163 --> 02:24:40,758
Kill them!
Call out the Black Guard.

998
02:25:19,272 --> 02:25:23,003
Stop them!
Run them down! Kill them!

999
02:27:51,457 --> 02:27:55,951
King! King! King!

1000
02:27:56,029 --> 02:28:00,728
King! King! King!

1001
02:28:03,837 --> 02:28:08,297
King! King! King!

1002
02:28:35,101 --> 02:28:39,800
King! King! King!

1003
02:28:50,049 --> 02:28:50,116
King! King! King!

1004
02:28:50,116 --> 02:28:55,053
King! King! King!

1005
02:28:56,589 --> 02:29:02,391
The city is yours! Take the crown.
Proclaim yourself king!

1006
02:29:02,462 --> 02:29:04,657
All our battles
we have fought for you.

1007
02:29:04,731 --> 02:29:07,564
We want you to rule us.

1008
02:29:12,705 --> 02:29:14,696
My Lord Cid!

1009
02:29:21,581 --> 02:29:23,776
We have given up everything for you.

1010
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:26,410
We implore you to take the crown.

1011
02:29:40,333 --> 02:29:43,564
I take Valencia...

1012
02:29:43,636 --> 02:29:47,800
in the name of
my Sovereign Lord Alfonso...

1013
02:29:47,874 --> 02:29:51,366
King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...

1014
02:29:51,444 --> 02:29:53,935
of Sagunto and Almenara...

1015
02:29:54,013 --> 02:29:56,777
of Castrejon and Alcantara...

1016
02:29:56,849 --> 02:30:00,012
King of Christians and Moors.

1017
02:30:00,086 --> 02:30:02,350
Valencia for Alfonso...

1018
02:30:02,422 --> 02:30:05,983
by the grace of God, King of Spain!

1019
02:30:06,059 --> 02:30:10,894
King! King! King!

1020
02:30:10,964 --> 02:30:15,333
What a noble subject.

1021
02:30:15,401 --> 02:30:18,234
If he had only a noble king.

1022
02:30:18,304 --> 02:30:23,071
King! King! King!

1023
02:30:38,157 --> 02:30:40,091
The crown of Valencia!

1024
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:56,308
The crown of Valencia?

1025
02:30:57,744 --> 02:31:01,111
The Cid sends this to me?

1026
02:31:06,886 --> 02:31:08,820
What are his conditions?

1027
02:31:08,888 --> 02:31:11,083
There are no conditions.

1028
02:31:12,859 --> 02:31:17,796
But Chimene... He knew about
the dungeon, his children.

1029
02:31:17,864 --> 02:31:20,697
He knew.

1030
02:31:24,303 --> 02:31:27,704
And yet he sends me the crown.

1031
02:31:30,376 --> 02:31:33,402
What kind of man is this?

1032
02:31:33,479 --> 02:31:37,506
He wants something.
What is it he wants?

1033
02:31:37,583 --> 02:31:40,950
My lord, the Cid
has asked for nothing.

1034
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:44,922
But I ask! My lord,
the Cid needs your help...

1035
02:31:44,991 --> 02:31:47,152
to defend Valencia against Ben Yusuf.

1036
02:31:47,226 --> 02:31:49,194
No!

1037
02:31:52,899 --> 02:31:58,030
Tell your lord, the Cid, that we seek
neither his favor nor his help.

1038
02:31:58,104 --> 02:32:01,904
Nor can he expect anything from us.

1039
02:32:01,974 --> 02:32:05,205
Now go.

1040
02:32:05,278 --> 02:32:08,645
Who has done more for you and Spain?

1041
02:32:08,714 --> 02:32:11,342
Go!

1042
02:32:24,163 --> 02:32:28,930
Look. Now you are also
King of Valencia.

1043
02:32:29,001 --> 02:32:32,960
I am king of nothing.
No king at all!

1044
02:32:33,039 --> 02:32:38,306
- I will make myself a king!
- Alfonso.

1045
02:32:38,377 --> 02:32:42,336
- I will!
- Alfonso!

1046
02:32:48,988 --> 02:32:54,426
All men must die.
Why not for a good cause?

1047
02:32:54,494 --> 02:32:59,796
What cause of yours could
be worth such torture?

1048
02:32:59,866 --> 02:33:02,892
The Cid.

1049
02:33:02,969 --> 02:33:06,336
The Cid? He is a man like other men.

1050
02:33:06,405 --> 02:33:08,566
He will die.
I will kill him.

1051
02:33:08,641 --> 02:33:11,701
He'll never die. Never.

1052
02:33:11,777 --> 02:33:16,578
You dare think of him
as we think of our Prophet?

1053
02:33:16,649 --> 02:33:19,049
We do!

1054
02:33:19,118 --> 02:33:23,782
Then this will be more
than a battle.

1055
02:33:23,856 --> 02:33:27,485
It will be our God...
against yours!

1056
02:34:50,977 --> 02:34:53,172
Where's Ordonez?

1057
02:34:53,246 --> 02:34:55,441
I sent him to see if
Ben Yusuf was on the march.

1058
02:34:55,514 --> 02:34:57,675
- Hasn't he returned?
- Not yet, my Cid.

1059
02:36:59,505 --> 02:37:01,735
Ben Yusuf's armada.

1060
02:37:01,807 --> 02:37:04,275
We should attack at dawn
before they can all land.

1061
02:37:04,343 --> 02:37:08,006
We'll drive a wedge along the shore...

1062
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:10,640
and keep his forces split.

1063
02:37:10,716 --> 02:37:12,684
Come.

1064
02:38:18,184 --> 02:38:20,277
I know, I know.

1065
02:38:20,352 --> 02:38:25,517
This is always the hardest time.
When the enemy has no face.

1066
02:38:25,591 --> 02:38:29,083
You have been through
this a hundred times.

1067
02:38:29,161 --> 02:38:33,359
I need to know.
Where do you find your courage?

1068
02:38:35,167 --> 02:38:37,761
I wish I knew.

1069
02:38:37,837 --> 02:38:41,773
Each warrior each time
must find it for himself.

1070
02:38:41,841 --> 02:38:44,036
Come.

1071
02:38:44,109 --> 02:38:46,771
This is the battle
we've waited for so long.

1072
02:38:46,846 --> 02:38:49,440
The last battle.

1073
02:38:49,515 --> 02:38:53,076
When we've won it, we'll have peace.

1074
02:39:32,525 --> 02:39:34,755
Open the gates.

1075
02:39:35,895 --> 02:39:39,353
For God, Alfonso and for Spain!

1076
02:39:39,431 --> 02:39:43,492
For God, Alfonso and Spain!

1077
02:44:35,661 --> 02:44:38,061
The Cid is wounded.
He goes back to Valencia.

1078
02:44:38,062 --> 02:44:40,462
The Cid is wounded.

1079
02:44:43,535 --> 02:44:46,333
The Cid is wounded.

1080
02:44:46,405 --> 02:44:49,431
The Cid is wounded.

1081
02:44:55,714 --> 02:44:57,841
The Cid...

1082
02:45:36,455 --> 02:45:41,188
No, Fanez.
We attack again tomorrow.

1083
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:43,626
You will need time
to recover your strength.

1084
02:45:43,695 --> 02:45:47,825
Must be tomorrow.
The enemy will only grow stronger...

1085
02:45:47,900 --> 02:45:50,232
while we grow weaker.

1086
02:45:50,302 --> 02:45:53,362
- But, my lord!
- Tomorrow, Fanez.

1087
02:45:53,438 --> 02:45:55,872
Make the preparations.

1088
02:45:55,941 --> 02:45:59,707
Go. Cover their retreat. Go!

1089
02:46:09,588 --> 02:46:13,024
Close the gates!
Close the gates!

1090
02:47:14,019 --> 02:47:16,715
There will be a great loss of blood...

1091
02:47:16,788 --> 02:47:19,279
but the arrow
must be withdrawn immediately.

1092
02:47:20,525 --> 02:47:22,652
Will he live?

1093
02:47:22,728 --> 02:47:25,322
If the arrow is drawn,
he has a chance.

1094
02:47:25,397 --> 02:47:29,834
If not, he will be dead
within a few days.

1095
02:47:45,083 --> 02:47:47,950
Chimene.

1096
02:47:50,055 --> 02:47:53,616
I must lead the attack tomorrow.

1097
02:47:55,227 --> 02:47:58,196
If the arrow is not withdrawn...

1098
02:47:58,263 --> 02:48:00,993
it is certain you will die.

1099
02:48:02,267 --> 02:48:04,861
Not before tomorrow.

1100
02:48:04,936 --> 02:48:09,430
- That's all I need.
- But it's not all I need.

1101
02:48:10,742 --> 02:48:14,610
What will there be for you
if this battle is lost?

1102
02:48:14,679 --> 02:48:18,638
Someone else will lead them.

1103
02:48:20,052 --> 02:48:23,920
They have made me their heart.

1104
02:48:27,926 --> 02:48:31,384
But their heart is wounded.

1105
02:48:31,463 --> 02:48:34,455
It needs to rest.

1106
02:48:34,533 --> 02:48:36,865
We could take you to Vivar.

1107
02:48:36,935 --> 02:48:38,869
We could cure you.

1108
02:48:38,937 --> 02:48:41,462
My love would not let you die.

1109
02:48:43,475 --> 02:48:48,208
We have not spent
much time together.

1110
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:51,078
Yet it seems to me...

1111
02:48:51,149 --> 02:48:55,051
I will not let you.
You will live.

1112
02:48:58,790 --> 02:49:04,126
Yet it seems to me that those who have
spent a lifetime together...

1113
02:49:04,196 --> 02:49:06,858
have not had more than we.

1114
02:49:06,932 --> 02:49:10,424
I want more!
I want forever!

1115
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:15,601
Oh, the children.

1116
02:49:16,675 --> 02:49:20,167
The children.

1117
02:49:20,245 --> 02:49:23,305
Chimene...

1118
02:49:23,381 --> 02:49:27,442
you can't save my life.

1119
02:49:35,293 --> 02:49:38,456
You must help me give it up.

1120
02:49:42,868 --> 02:49:44,927
Now.

1121
02:49:56,515 --> 02:49:59,279
Lord Moutamin.

1122
02:50:02,721 --> 02:50:05,588
It is the wish of my husband...

1123
02:50:05,657 --> 02:50:08,990
that the arrow shall not be removed.

1124
02:50:39,090 --> 02:50:43,821
Allah be praised!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!

1125
02:50:43,895 --> 02:50:48,389
Let it be known everywhere
the Cid is dead!

1126
02:50:48,466 --> 02:50:51,924
The Cid is dead!

1127
02:50:52,003 --> 02:50:56,201
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!

1128
02:50:56,274 --> 02:51:02,110
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!

1129
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:06,139
The Cid is dead!

1130
02:51:06,218 --> 02:51:09,153
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!

1131
02:51:09,221 --> 02:51:13,157
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!

1132
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:17,794
They dare not come out and fight!

1133
02:51:17,862 --> 02:51:21,491
Let it be known everywhere
the Cid is dead!

1134
02:51:40,385 --> 02:51:44,981
I tell you!
The Cid is alive!

1135
02:51:45,056 --> 02:51:49,550
He is well!
I have seen him!

1136
02:51:49,628 --> 02:51:52,358
He will fight tomorrow!

1137
02:51:52,430 --> 02:51:55,593
He will be with us,
leading the attack.

1138
02:51:55,667 --> 02:52:00,434
I promise! You must...
You must believe me!

1139
02:52:00,505 --> 02:52:02,496
The Cid is alive!

1140
02:52:13,685 --> 02:52:17,849
- Fanez?
- Yes, my lord.

1141
02:52:22,494 --> 02:52:24,519
What are they saying?

1142
02:52:24,596 --> 02:52:28,191
All is well, my lord.
Very well.

1143
02:52:28,266 --> 02:52:33,101
The people are hopeful.
The army is eager to fight.

1144
02:52:33,171 --> 02:52:36,868
You always were a bad liar, Fanez.

1145
02:52:36,941 --> 02:52:41,275
Now tell me the truth.

1146
02:52:46,751 --> 02:52:50,915
I could not convince them...
that you are alive.

1147
02:53:47,779 --> 02:53:52,273
El Cid! El Cid!

1148
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:58,785
Cid! Cid!

1149
02:53:58,857 --> 02:54:01,883
Cid! Cid!

1150
02:54:04,963 --> 02:54:08,592
Soldiers!

1151
02:54:08,666 --> 02:54:11,635
People of Valencia!

1152
02:54:11,703 --> 02:54:14,433
You must not be frightened...

1153
02:54:14,506 --> 02:54:18,067
by the sound of a few drums.

1154
02:54:18,143 --> 02:54:23,171
In a few hours,
they will be silenced forever!

1155
02:54:26,251 --> 02:54:29,084
I promise you!

1156
02:54:29,154 --> 02:54:32,282
Tomorrow morning...

1157
02:54:32,357 --> 02:54:35,292
I will ride with you!

1158
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:39,228
Cid! Cid!

1159
02:54:39,297 --> 02:54:42,095
Cid! Cid!

1160
02:54:42,167 --> 02:54:46,228
Cid! Cid! Cid!

1161
02:54:55,814 --> 02:54:59,409
Cid! Cid! Cid!

1162
02:55:08,493 --> 02:55:13,692
- Chimene.
- I am here, Rodrigo. I am here.

1163
02:55:13,765 --> 02:55:16,825
Listen to me.

1164
02:55:16,901 --> 02:55:20,098
Even if my strength fails me...

1165
02:55:20,171 --> 02:55:23,663
- I must lead the attack tomorrow.
- Yes.

1166
02:55:23,741 --> 02:55:26,073
I must!

1167
02:55:26,144 --> 02:55:29,307
You understand?

1168
02:55:29,380 --> 02:55:31,371
I must.

1169
02:55:31,449 --> 02:55:33,644
Alive or dead...

1170
02:55:33,718 --> 02:55:38,246
I must be on my horse
at the head of my soldiers.

1171
02:55:40,024 --> 02:55:42,049
You promise...

1172
02:55:42,126 --> 02:55:45,289
you will do whatever
needs to be done?

1173
02:55:45,363 --> 02:55:47,297
Yes.

1174
02:55:47,365 --> 02:55:52,200
- Promise me.
- I promise, Rodrigo.

1175
02:55:52,270 --> 02:55:57,139
I promise.
I promise.

1176
02:55:57,208 --> 02:55:59,768
Yes.

1177
02:56:01,379 --> 02:56:04,815
I promise.
I promise.

1178
02:56:16,761 --> 02:56:19,821
Open the gates!
It's the King!

1179
02:56:43,254 --> 02:56:46,382
My lord, the King!

1180
02:57:05,610 --> 02:57:08,511
Forgive me, my Cid.

1181
02:57:15,453 --> 02:57:18,513
- Forgive me!
- No!

1182
02:57:18,590 --> 02:57:21,821
My King kneels to no man!

1183
02:57:21,893 --> 02:57:24,828
To no man!

1184
02:57:34,839 --> 02:57:39,742
It's not easy for a man
to conquer himself.

1185
02:57:41,346 --> 02:57:43,576
You have done that.

1186
02:57:44,949 --> 02:57:48,885
If only I could live
to see Spain at peace.

1187
02:57:48,953 --> 02:57:50,887
You will.
You will!

1188
02:57:50,955 --> 02:57:53,651
No one can stand against us now.

1189
02:57:53,725 --> 02:57:56,387
We'll drive Ben Yusuf
back into the sea!

1190
02:57:56,461 --> 02:58:00,227
I have not failed.

1191
02:58:00,298 --> 02:58:03,859
Spain... has a king.

1192
02:58:11,843 --> 02:58:16,746
Tomorrow we will fight side by side.

1193
02:58:16,814 --> 02:58:19,282
My King and I.

1194
02:58:20,418 --> 02:58:24,377
We will ride out together.

1195
02:58:24,455 --> 02:58:26,389
Together.

1196
02:58:26,457 --> 02:58:29,085
No!

1197
02:58:30,662 --> 02:58:34,530
I will be at your side.

1198
02:58:37,001 --> 02:58:40,095
Chimene!

1199
02:58:41,305 --> 02:58:43,796
Ah, Chimene.

1200
02:58:47,345 --> 02:58:49,643
Chimene.

1201
02:58:49,714 --> 02:58:54,413
I promise.
I have not forgotten.

1202
02:58:56,421 --> 02:59:00,949
I want you and my children...

1203
02:59:01,025 --> 02:59:06,759
to remember me riding with my King.

1204
02:59:17,141 --> 02:59:19,701
Tomorrow.

1205
03:02:29,533 --> 03:02:33,526
For God, the Cid and Spain!

1206
03:02:33,604 --> 03:02:38,007
For God, the Cid and Spain!

1207
03:02:38,075 --> 03:02:43,035
For God, the Cid and Spain!

1208
03:02:43,014 --> 03:02:48,017
<i>And thus the Cid rode
out of the gates of history into legend.</i>

1209
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:40,866
Back! Back!
Go back!

1210
03:03:40,938 --> 03:03:43,773
Go back!

1211
03:04:48,773 --> 03:04:53,574
Heavenly Father, open Your arms
to receive the soul...

1212
03:04:53,644 --> 03:04:58,172
of one who lived and died
the purest knight of all.
