00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,920
<i>Greece and the islands</i>
<i>of the Aegean Sea...</i>

2
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,680
<i>...have given birth to many myths</i>
<i>and legends of war and adventure.</i>

3
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,180
<i>And these once-proud stones,</i>
<i>these ruined and shattered temples...</i>

4
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>...bear witness to the civilization</i>
<i>that flourished and then died here.</i>

5
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,240
<i>And of the demigods and heroes</i>
<i>who inspired those legends...</i>

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,740
<i>...on this sea and these islands.</i>

7
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,280
<i>But though the stage is the same,</i>
<i>ours is a legend of our own times...</i>

8
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,660
<i>...and its heroes are not demigods,</i>
<i>but ordinary people.</i>

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,000
<i>In 1943, so the story goes...</i>

10
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,000
<i>...2000 British soldiers lay</i>
<i>marooned on the island of Kheros...</i>

11
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,590
<i>...exhausted and helpless.</i>

12
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,640
<i>They had exactly one week to live.</i>
<i>In Berlin, the Axis had determined...</i>

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,430
<i>...on a show of strength</i>
<i>in the Aegean Sea...</i>

14
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,770
<i>...to bully neutral Turkey into</i>
<i>coming into the war on their side.</i>

15
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,190
<i>The scene of that demonstration</i>
<i>was to be Kheros...</i>

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,410
<i>...itself of no military value,</i>
<i>but only miles off the coast of Turkey.</i>

17
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,410
<i>The cream of the German war machine,</i>
<i>rested and ready...</i>

18
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,830
<i>...was to spearhead the attack.</i>

19
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,410
<i>The men on Kheros were doomed...</i>

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,880
<i>...unless they could be evacuated</i>
<i>before the blitz.</i>

21
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,550
<i>But the only passage</i>
<i>to and from Kheros...</i>

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,960
<i>...was guarded and blocked</i>
<i>by two great...</i>

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,050
<i>...newly designed,</i>
<i>radar-controlled guns...</i>

24
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,220
<i>...on the nearby island of Navarone.</i>

25
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,180
<i>Guns too powerful and accurate...</i>

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,730
<i>...for any Allied ship then</i>
<i>in the Aegean to challenge.</i>

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,580
<i>Allied Intelligence learned</i>
<i>of the projected blitz...</i>

28
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,330
<i>...only one week before</i>
<i>the appointed date.</i>

29
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,960
<i>What took place in the next six days</i>
<i>became the legend of Navarone.</i>

30
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,990
Yes?

31
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,910
I'm looking for
Commodore Jensen.

32
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm Jensen.

33
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,870
Come in, Mallory.

34
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,620
You're late.

35
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm sorry. Our plane was attacked
an hour out of Crete.

36
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,970
- We got into Alex on one engine, sir.
- The Germans have a price on you...

37
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,720
...and Andrea Stavros
of 10,000 pounds apiece.

38
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,770
How did you know that?

39
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,770
I should do. I'm your boss.

40
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,940
You've been working for me
the past 18 months.

41
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance.

42
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,400
Did they say
you were going on leave?

43
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,820
Yes, sir. They did.

44
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,610
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.

45
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,320
Not yet, at any rate.

46
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,200
Here's your old chum.
Come and say hello to him.

47
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,620
You haven't changed since Athens.

48
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,670
Hello, Roy.

49
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,130
Come along, gentlemen, will you?

50
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,970
Barnsby...

51
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,140
...these gentlemen have
an interest in Navarone.

52
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,690
We've heard you on radio, but
perhaps you'll be more specific now.

53
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,360
I'll be specific.

54
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,440
As you can plainly see,
it was bloody awful!

55
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,030
Squadron Leader
Barnsby's Australian.

56
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,990
But we'd love to go back,
wouldn't we boys?

57
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,040
- Sure! Right!
- Just as soon as we can! But...

58
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,160
...only on one condition.

59
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,210
We want the joker who thought
of this to come with us...

60
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,540
...and when we get there...

61
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,130
...we're gonna shove him
out at 10,000 feet...

62
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,670
...without a parachute.

63
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,300
Bloody right.

64
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,050
- It was bad as that?
- Bad?!

65
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,720
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.

66
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,730
You're sure about that,
squadron leader? This is important.

67
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,480
So's my life!

68
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,610
To me, anyway. And the lives
of these jokers here...

69
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,690
...and the 18 men we lost tonight!

70
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,240
Look, sir...

71
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,120
...first...

72
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,830
...you've got that old fortress
on top of that bloody cliff.

73
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,500
Then you've got
the bloody cliff overhang.

74
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,250
You can't even see the bloody cave,
let alone the guns.

75
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,510
And anyway, we haven't got
a bloody bomb big enough...

76
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,890
...to smash that bloody rock.

77
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,720
And that's the bloody truth, sir.

78
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,520
I know how to hit those guns.

79
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,690
Yes?

80
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,020
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,770
You fill a plane full of TNT...

82
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,700
...and then you do a suicide
dive right into that cave.

83
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,450
There's just one problem, sir:

84
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,870
Getting someone to pilot the plane.

85
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,870
I see. Perhaps you might
consider it yourself.

86
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,880
Thank you, squadron leader,
and all of you.

87
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,090
I know you've done your best,
and nobody could have done more.

88
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,300
And I'm sorry.

89
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,940
As you've probably surmised, I'm the
joker they'd heave out at 10,000 feet.

90
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,070
And I can't say I blame them.

91
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,610
I knew it was hopeless from the start,
but it had to be tried.

92
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,490
Anyway, this is why you
were hauled out of Crete.

93
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
And don't mislay this, will you?

94
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,870
No, sir.

95
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,590
We're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?

96
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,270
- Any questions?
- Only one.

97
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,270
Why me?

98
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,190
What you want is
a seagoing taxi driver.

99
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,030
Other men know these waters
as well as I do.

100
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,450
Yes, but you've got
special qualifications.

101
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,660
Franklin'll explain it.
It's his idea, anyway.

102
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,040
First, you speak Greek and German.

103
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,250
Second, you've kept alive in occupied
territory for a year and a half.

104
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,300
And before the war, you were the
greatest mountain climber in the world.

105
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,510
"Keith Mallory, the human fly."

106
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,970
Come to the point, Roy.

107
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,680
The point is that our Resistance
contacts on Navarone...

108
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,680
...say there's only one spot on
the coast the Germans don't watch:

109
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,690
The South Cliff.
It's 400 feet straight up...

110
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,860
...and it can't be climbed
by man or beast.

111
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
And that's where you come in.

112
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,690
That was your idea too?

113
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,240
That's right.

114
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,370
I want you to get me and my team
over there and on top of that cliff.

115
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,200
When you've done that, you can
take a richly deserved leave...

116
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,870
...and a long-overdue promotion.

117
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,580
I see.

118
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,520
Can you do it?

119
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
No.

120
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,610
With all due respect,
I think the operation is insane.

121
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,910
But that's not my business.

122
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,910
My business is to climb
and I haven't climbed in five years.

123
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,120
That's a long time.

124
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,960
It's too long for this cliff.

125
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,830
And you're asking me
to do it at night.

126
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,010
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.

127
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,550
I'll have a go myself, then.
I've climbed a bit.

128
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,310
Don't be a fool. You'd get yourself
killed and your team along with you.

129
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,350
- Then it's scrubbed?
- No, it's not scrubbed!

130
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,900
It can't be.

131
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,650
Not now.

132
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,820
Mallory...

133
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,240
...this is our last hope.

134
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,580
The Germans won't expect
a team of saboteurs at this late date.

135
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,580
Those 2000 men on Kheros will
die next Wednesday morning...

136
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,580
...unless somebody climbs the cliff.

137
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,250
There's nobody else
we can get in time.

138
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,470
If there were,
you wouldn't be here now.

139
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,030
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavros to help me.

140
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,860
On the contrary.

141
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,120
I think you'll find him waiting
for you in your hotel.

142
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,830
You think of everything.

143
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,630
I have to. It's part of my job.

144
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,290
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.

145
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,970
Nothing I like better
than a well-organized setup.

146
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,380
You'll want to know about the team.

147
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,600
Sydney, would you get us
some more coffee, please?

148
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,140
Franklin considers it the best team
in the business. I agree.

149
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,900
He himself is ideal for the job. He's
experienced and extremely capable.

150
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,520
Don't blush, Roy.

151
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,610
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you lucky?

152
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,070
- If you say so, sir.
- I do, indeed.

153
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,740
Napoleon said once, when somebody
was up for promotion to general:

154
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,830
"Yes, I know he's brilliant.
But is he lucky?"

155
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,710
The emperor knew the value of luck.
Our Roy seems to have it.

156
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,590
- Then make me a general, sir.
- Patience, my dear boy, patience.

157
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,380
Now this is our Corporal Miller.
A chemistry professor in private life.

158
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,010
An absolute genius
with high explosives.

159
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,220
He blew up Rommel's headquarters...

160
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,350
...with no damage
to the orphanage next door.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,890
They don't come any better. We tried
to make him an officer. He refused.

162
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,440
This is "Butcher" Brown,
our mechanical marvel.

163
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,360
He's a genius with engines,
machinery, radios, et cetera.

164
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,240
And the best man with a knife
I've ever met.

165
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,620
He got his training in Spain. The boys
call him the Butcher of Barcelona.

166
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,370
Private Spyro Pappadimos.

167
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,290
What's his particular genius?

168
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,050
He's a born killer. A useful man
to have along on a job like this.

169
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,970
His father happens to be our chief
resistance contact on Navarone.

170
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,800
The boy went to America
to get an education.

171
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,560
I'm afraid he got the wrong kind.

172
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,770
Well, there's the team.

173
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,520
Pirates and cutthroats,
every one of them.

174
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,900
And of course, there's Lucky here.

175
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,230
And the redoubtable Mr. Stavros
and yourself.

176
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,070
With every one of us a genius,
how can we fail?

177
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,410
You can't.

178
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,950
We're sending six destroyers through
the Navarone Channel next Tuesday...

179
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,620
...to take the men off Kheros.

180
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,290
If those guns aren't spiked by then...

181
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,840
...there'll be six more ships
at the bottom of the Aegean.

182
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,930
There's your car, gentlemen.

183
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Surprised?

184
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,150
I didn't think I'd see you again
so soon.

185
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,320
You thought you'd have
to look for me?

186
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,370
When the time came,
I would find you.

187
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,660
What is this?

188
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,000
We have to ferry some operators
to an island called Navarone.

189
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,590
- Do you know it?
- I know it.

190
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,470
I also know I have
work to do on Crete.

191
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,560
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major I used to know.

192
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,270
Name of Franklin.

193
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,770
He's a man who still has to prove
to himself he's a hero.

194
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,480
I'll speak to Franklin.
Where do I find him?

195
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,990
That's the man.

196
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,570
You can speak with him on the way.

197
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,920
Think they've got a chance?

198
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,380
Frankly, no.

199
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,640
Not a chance in the world.

200
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,930
I'll be surprised if they
get halfway to Navarone.

201
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,560
It's just a waste of six good men.

202
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,780
However, it doesn't matter, considering
how many have been wasted already.

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm glad it's not my decision.

204
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,530
I'm only the middleman.

205
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,870
Still, they may get there
and they may pull it off.

206
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,050
Anything can happen in a war.
In the middle of absolute insanity...

207
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,630
...people pull out
extraordinary resources.

208
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,130
Ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.

209
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,850
Pity we can't beat the problems
of peace in the same way.

210
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,060
It would be so much cheaper.

211
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,100
I never thought of it
in just that way.

212
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,400
- You're a philosopher.
- No.

213
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,990
I'm just the man who has to send
people out on jobs like this one.

214
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,900
Must have been delayed.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

215
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,630
- Major Franklin?
- Right.

216
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,140
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come with me, please.

217
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,260
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.

218
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,940
When you're all quite ready...

219
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,540
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.

220
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,300
Where does everybody else sleep?

221
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,920
Nobody sleeps. On your feet,
professor. We've got homework to do.

222
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,800
If you insist, major.

223
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,680
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?

224
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,680
No, friend. Microphones.

225
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,180
This is the British Army Post.
Don't you trust anyone?

226
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,190
No. That is why I have lived so long.

227
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,530
Mr. Stavros is Colonel Stavros
of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.

228
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,990
- He outranks us all.
- It is of no moment.

229
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,450
The 19th Regiment no longer exists,
for the time being.

230
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
- I beg your pardon, colonel.
- Andrea.

231
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,210
Please continue.

232
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,790
Right. If you're ready, corporal.

233
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,500
Yes, sir. Ready, sir.

234
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,420
Ready, willing and able, sir.

235
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,550
Champing at the bit.

236
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,550
Captain Mallory and Andrea...

237
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,640
...are responsible for getting us
to where we're going.

238
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,310
I'll tell you where it is,
and why we're going.

239
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,230
That is, if you really want
to know, professor.

240
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,560
I'm all ears, sir. All ears.

241
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,520
We must avoid the coast road.
That means a 12-mile trek...

242
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,400
...to St. Alexis, where Resistance
people from the town of Mandrakos...

243
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,410
...will come and meet us
if they can make it.

244
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,080
Any questions?

245
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,950
I have an alternative route
to that place.

246
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,080
May I borrow your pencil, please?

247
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,340
Does the major think
this is possible?

248
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,760
I see.

249
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,630
That's a thought, isn't it?

250
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,300
Well, let's re-examine the plan
and see if we have any alternative.

251
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,180
Watch out!

252
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,820
- How long has he been there?
- I heard something 10 minutes ago.

253
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,530
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.

254
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,530
Ten minutes?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.

255
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,910
Yes, sir.

256
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,780
What's your name?
What are you doing here?

257
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,540
The major asked you a question!
Answer the major.

258
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,290
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.

259
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,880
I'll try Greek.

260
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,310
- Translation, please.
- He doesn't speak English.

261
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,890
Why was he listening?

262
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,690
- What are you doing to that man?
- You know him?

263
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,820
That's Nicolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?

264
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,490
I've had a hard day!

265
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
Does his job involve
listening at keyholes?

266
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,870
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him at it.

267
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,740
It was just idle curiosity.
He doesn't speak English.

268
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,620
Why does he listen?
And why did he try to stab this man?

269
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,040
I presume he was trying
to defend himself.

270
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,050
In this part of the world, carrying a
knife doesn't make you a criminal.

271
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,340
Let him go.

272
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,590
Major Baker, arrest this man and
hold him incommunicado for a week.

273
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,350
After that, my advice is you
kick him out of Castelrosso.

274
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,230
Who the hell are you to give
me advice, major?

275
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,730
Then I'm asking you as a favor.

276
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,440
I'll consider it.

277
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,940
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
I said, let him go!

278
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,950
Pappadimos,
have you got your silencer?

279
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,570
- Yes, sir.
- Then use it. Shoot the laundry boy!

280
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Are you crazy?

281
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,370
And if the major gets
in your way, shoot him too.

282
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,410
That's an order.

283
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,260
Captain, he's insane!
Surely you won't let him do this.

284
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,470
I can't stop him, he's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.

285
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,390
Of course, he doesn't have
to shoot you.

286
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,650
He can just call our HQ and you'll
be on a troopship home, as a private...

287
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,320
...unless you give him your word that
you'll do exactly as he says.

288
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,830
All right.

289
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,910
If it means that much to you,
you have my word.

290
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,670
Take him, sergeant!

291
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,300
Stupid theatricals.

292
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,920
You're entitled to your opinion...

293
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,680
...but I just saved your life.

294
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,450
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.
Really, I am.

295
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,160
It's embarrassing.
Just look at it!

296
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,330
No, it's exactly what we want.

297
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,590
They said you wanted a boat no one
would notice, but that's a disgrace!

298
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,720
Give me 36 hours,
and I know I can lay my hands...

299
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,260
...on a German E-boat
in absolutely perfect condition.

300
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,970
I promise you,
only one careful owner.

301
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,350
I can pop over to Rhodes
and get it for you.

302
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,980
Won't the Germans have
something to say about that?

303
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,730
I suppose so, if they knew.

304
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,190
But I've got good connections there.
What do you say?

305
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,650
- No, thanks. We can't wait.
- Pity.

306
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,820
I'll get my chaps
to help with your gear.

307
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,370
No, that's all right, thank you.

308
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,330
Right. I get it.

309
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,080
Special cargo and all that, what?
Well, good luck to you.

310
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,920
Brown?

311
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,670
Yes, sir?

312
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,550
What do you think?

313
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,100
Well, she's a bit of a monster, sir.

314
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,180
But I think I've got her worried.

315
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,100
- Comfortable, professor?
- Yes, thank you.

316
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,900
Matter of fact,
the boys have almost finished.

317
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,650
Permission to speak?

318
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,400
- What about?
- Well, the condition of this vessel.

319
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,740
Talk to Captain Mallory.
He's in charge of transportation.

320
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,950
Very good, sir.

321
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,870
I've inspected this boat
and I think you ought to know...

322
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,080
...I can't swim.

323
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,090
I'll keep it in mind.

324
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,230
Dead on 10, sir.

325
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,900
<i>Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.</i>

326
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,660
<i>Report my signal. Report my signal.</i>

327
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,200
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.

328
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,330
Strength three. Strength three, over.

329
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,750
<i>Hello, Lucky.</i>

330
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,130
<i>High Flight reports Indians on warpath</i>
<i>in your territory.</i>

331
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,250
<i>So please be careful.</i>

332
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,590
<i>Also, severe storms expected</i>
<i>throughout your area tonight.</i>

333
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,600
<i>Repeat. High Flight reports</i>
<i>Indians on warpath...</i>

334
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,750
Hey.

335
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,970
Ship ahoy!

336
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,810
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.

337
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,570
Lower your sails!

338
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,580
Lower your sails!

339
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,290
We are coming aboard!

340
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,880
It's knee-deep in the hold,
but I think we'll manage.

341
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,420
You want a breather?

342
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,180
Wouldn't mind.

343
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Funny the way that German officer
spoke English to us back there...

344
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,230
...almost as if he knew who we were.

345
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,440
I had the same thought.

346
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,360
I think our friend Baker
may have some explaining to do.

347
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,950
I shouldn't have done it.

348
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,240
What's that?

349
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,200
Dragged you into this.

350
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm sorry.

351
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,960
Forget it. I was getting tired
of Crete food anyway.

352
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,250
No, I'm stupid sometimes.

353
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,630
Even as a kid, I'd expect
people to play the games I liked.

354
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,050
Then I'd get furious when they didn't.

355
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,640
Well, now they have to,
so why worry?

356
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,370
Hot coffee!

357
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,250
That's good.

358
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm sorry, captain.

359
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,220
There's a serious shortage of cups
aboard this ship.

360
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,850
I pointed out deficiencies
in this vessel.

361
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,220
I remember.

362
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,190
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

363
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,400
Any time you want another chat,
about this boat, I mean, I'm available.

364
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,820
All right.

365
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,910
And I still can't swim.

366
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,210
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.

367
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,220
I don't mind him as much
as he seems to mind me.

368
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,720
Have you been together long?

369
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,890
Since the beginning out here.

370
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,770
He's the best friend I have
in this part of the world.

371
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,190
That's a pretty good partner
you've got there yourself.

372
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,650
Yes.

373
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,330
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.

374
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,880
He's going to kill me
when the war's over.

375
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,550
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I am.

376
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,430
So's he.

377
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,770
About a year ago, I gave
a German patrol a safe conduct...

378
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,190
...to get their wounded into hospital.

379
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,740
I still had some romantic notions
about fighting a civilized war.

380
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,330
Anyway, they wanted Andrea
pretty badly even then.

381
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,700
They shot their casualties,
went to his house and blew it up.

382
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,920
He was out on a job, but his wife
and three children were in the house.

383
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,300
They were all killed.

384
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,010
I helped him to bury them.

385
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,060
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.

386
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,020
But after it was over, he said that
as far as he was concerned...

387
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,650
...it wasn't the Germans who were
responsible, but me.

388
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,990
Me and my stupid
Anglo-Saxon decency.

389
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,450
He said what he
was going to do, and when.

390
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,120
Do you think he still means to do it?

391
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,920
He's from Crete.
Those people don't make idle threats.

392
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,970
I thought I was getting leave.

393
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,260
I was going to ask for
transfer to another area.

394
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,890
Take some time to think,
get ready for him.

395
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,930
And I messed that up.

396
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,890
I'm sorry.

397
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,310
That's all right.

398
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,650
It's gonna be a long war.

399
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,440
What makes you sure
he's gonna wait that long?

400
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm not. Not if he gets
the right opportunity.

401
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,000
What I'm banking on is, that now
all he wants to do is to kill Germans.

402
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,050
As long as I can be useful to him
in that department...

403
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,920
...he'll do his best to keep me alive.

404
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,630
I hope.

405
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,680
That's nice of him.

406
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,890
Well, I can see his point.

407
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,020
The only way to win a war is to be
just as nasty as the enemy.

408
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,570
I'm only worried we'll find out
we're even nastier than they are.

409
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,730
I can't say that worries me.

410
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,190
Well, you're lucky.

411
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,000
Think I better
have a look at the hold.

412
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,590
Before Miller tells me to!

413
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,810
Help!

414
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,670
We've saved the explosives...

415
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,090
...the guns...

416
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,220
...and most of the ammunition.

417
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,220
I'm afraid we've lost the food
and the medical supplies.

418
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,020
But if we rendezvous with
the Resistance...

419
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:37,810
...at St. Alexis,
they'll supply us with both.

420
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,110
Let's get out of this place
as quickly as we can.

421
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,780
Pappadimos and Miller, you'll have
the first shift with the stretcher.

422
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,360
You're officially
taking command, sir?

423
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,290
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?

424
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,290
Just for the record.

425
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,470
This afternoon on the boat...

426
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,980
...you fumbled your job.

427
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,980
How'd that happen?

428
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,190
I don't know, sir.

429
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,990
The man was a foot away from you.
You only wounded him.

430
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,660
How could you miss?

431
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,830
I must have hesitated, sir.

432
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,040
You hesitated?

433
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,790
A man of your experience?

434
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,590
The Butcher of Barcelona?

435
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,170
How could you hesitate?

436
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,670
Well, I was tired.

437
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,010
I'm tired and I'm fed up.

438
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,180
I've been fighting this war
a long time.

439
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,730
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.

440
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,350
Shoot a man at 200 yards,
he's just a target.

441
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,360
You kill him with a knife...

442
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,230
...you're close enough to smell him.

443
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,200
I smell them in my sleep.

444
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,830
After the last time, I made a pact
with myself: I'd do my job.

445
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,700
But I wouldn't do the other anymore.

446
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,210
Not if I could help it.

447
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,210
And who gave you the right
to make a private peace?

448
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,960
You think you're
the only one who's tired?

449
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,630
I do my job, sir!

450
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,760
Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.

451
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,760
There will, of course,
be a code word.

452
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,260
If we don't answer, a patrol
will be here in no time.

453
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,170
Let's pack and get out.

454
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,030
Let's go.

455
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,330
Well?

456
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,370
The major's leg is broken
in two places.

457
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,750
He could be hurt inside too.
He needs medical attention.

458
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,170
What do you suggest?

459
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,840
- Leave him for the Germans.
- They'd get him to a hospital.

460
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:41,180
If he doesn't get sulphanilamide,
he doesn't stand a chance.

461
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,470
Naturally, you all think a lot
of Major Franklin. So do I.

462
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,520
We have two choices.

463
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,310
We can take him,
and if he doesn't get help, he'll die.

464
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,570
Or we can leave him here,
and he'll tell the Germans everything.

465
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,690
Roy? Never!

466
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,110
He might not be able to help himself.

467
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,620
They have other drugs
besides sulpha.

468
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:06,950
All they have to do is use scopolamine,
and he'll tell them our whole plan.

469
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,580
There is, of course, a third choice.

470
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,040
One bullet now. Better for him.
Better for us.

471
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,090
You take that man along,
you endanger us all.

472
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,550
Why not drop him off the cliff
and save a bullet?

473
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,760
And why don't you shut up?

474
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,560
Yes, there's a third choice.

475
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,230
We'll make it if necessary...

476
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,560
...when it's necessary...

477
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,060
...and not before!

478
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,150
Now let's move!

479
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:40,320
Brown, from now on your job is
to look after Major Franklin.

480
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,120
I said, move!

481
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,600
Morning!

482
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,520
I'm sorry.

483
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,320
Don't be silly. It's just bad luck.

484
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,410
Well, what do we do now?

485
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,370
Where are we?

486
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,120
We're on our way.

487
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,500
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.

488
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,330
Anyway, the professor won the toss
and he's dying to carry you.

489
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,670
That's right. You're not
nearly as heavy as I thought.

490
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,050
Now look...

491
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,510
...you've got to leave me.

492
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,550
You're out of your mind.

493
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,930
It's radio time.

494
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,180
Well, it's all on your plate now.

495
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,190
You'll never be able
to thank me enough.

496
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,860
I wanted the job all the time.

497
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,550
<i>Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.</i>

498
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,560
<i>Report my signal.</i>

499
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,060
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.

500
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,770
Strength four. Strength four, over.

501
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:20,190
<i>Hello, Lucky. This is most urgent.</i>

502
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,730
<i>Paddington Station will close</i>
<i>at midnight, X minus one.</i>

503
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,910
<i>Do you understand?</i>
<i>X minus one, over.</i>

504
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,280
We've lost a full day.

505
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,910
Germans are gonna hit Kheros
a day ahead of time.

506
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,340
Gives us until midnight,
the day after tomorrow.

507
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,590
Message understood.
Message understood. Over and out.

508
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,970
I'd like to be alone with the major.

509
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,010
Roy, that was foolish.

510
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,180
You almost ruined everything.
We've just heard, we're canceled out.

511
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,680
Scrubbed.

512
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,020
What?

513
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,610
They're going for an amphibious
landing the day after tomorrow...

514
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,440
...on the east coast.

515
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,360
The Turkish side.

516
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,610
The Turkish side?

517
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:36,370
And they're coming in force.

518
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,700
As far as we're concerned,
the pressure's off.

519
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,290
All we have to do is
make as much trouble as we can.

520
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,380
By tonight, we'll have you
in the hands of the underground.

521
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,210
We'll have you taken care of.

522
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,640
Try this again, I'll have Andrea
break your other leg.

523
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:25,420
Good luck.

524
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,580
Do not worry.

525
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,840
I shall see you tonight at St. Alexis.

526
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,040
Good evening, gentlemen.

527
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:39,550
Obviously, this place
has been used before.

528
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,890
Any food around?

529
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,220
I regret to say no.

530
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,190
Weren't you careless?
We might have been anyone.

531
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,480
I heard you coming five minutes ago.

532
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,860
No.

533
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,490
No!

534
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:13,880
Pappadimos,
it's time to relieve Andrea.

535
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,670
I'll take it.

536
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,050
No.

537
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,380
Pappadimos...

538
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,880
...you go.

539
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,160
- Maybe he brought food.
- Hold it.

540
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:32,910
He might be faking.

541
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,210
Saved!

542
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:50,890
Don't move!

543
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,180
Raise your hands!

544
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,060
Raise your hands high!

545
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,270
All of you!

546
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:03,190
You there, with the food, speak!

547
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,240
You are not Germans.

548
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,370
Which of you is Major Franklin?

549
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,290
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?

550
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,750
My name is Maria Pappadimos.

551
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:27,220
You may put your hands
down now, gentlemen.

552
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,310
Pappadimos?

553
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,480
They said Pappadimos was a man.

554
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:41,230
My father.
He was taken two days ago.

555
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,770
He was taken?

556
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,070
He told them nothing.

557
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:46,900
He will die first.

558
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,820
- You have sisters or brothers?
- A brother, Spyro, in America.

559
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,710
Oh, he's not as far away as all that.

560
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,250
He's that handsome devil
right over there.

561
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,340
Spyro!

562
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,930
Why did you do that for?

563
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,230
To remind you to write letters
occasionally.

564
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,360
- There's a war on!
- I mean before the war!

565
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:27,490
I promised myself I would do this
the first time I saw you again.

566
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,610
Well, I'm sorry, brother.

567
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,970
Which of you did this?

568
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,140
Well...

569
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,390
I'm afraid it was me.

570
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:58,640
- Who is she?
- My friend, Anna. She's one of us.

571
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,810
It's bad that this happened to her.

572
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:06,650
Before the Germans came, she was
a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.

573
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:10,650
Last year, she was caught. They
tortured her to make her betray us.

574
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,200
They whipped her until
the white of her bones showed.

575
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,370
Some nights, we could
hear her screaming.

576
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,870
Then they kept her in
the fortress for six months.

577
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,880
When they let her go...

578
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,170
...she could not speak.

579
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:32,880
She has never spoken since.
Not even in her dreams.

580
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:36,680
Even I have never been allowed
to see the scars on her back.

581
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,230
But she's a good fighter.
As good as any of you!

582
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,350
Like a ghost, she goes anywhere!

583
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,110
She got us these guns.
And she kills without mercy.

584
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,440
You are very lucky, brother.

585
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,200
No, they are the friends! Our friends!

586
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,460
It's gangrene, sir.

587
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,210
If the leg doesn't come off, he'll die.

588
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,710
Does he know?

589
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,510
I don't think so.

590
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:24,560
Sir...

591
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:30,060
...I beg your pardon, but I haven't
had a chance to talk to you alone.

592
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:34,860
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.

593
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,240
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.

594
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,860
I'll think it over.

595
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,910
That's gangrene! What choice
do we have now, captain?

596
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,370
- Who relieved you?
- She did.

597
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,300
- In future, take orders only from me.
- I asked you a question, sir!

598
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,380
And I heard you, corporal.

599
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,390
Get yourself something to eat.
That's an order.

600
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,560
Thank you, sir.

601
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,320
There's a lot of activity down there.
I can hear it.

602
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,400
They're turning Mandrakos
inside out.

603
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,950
As soon as they move out,
we'll move in.

604
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,240
We're gonna get you to a doctor.

605
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:27,080
Brown says that you are doing well.

606
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,540
Brown is a liar. And so are you.

607
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,920
I haven't lost my sense of smell,
you know.

608
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,840
I just hope the doctor's
a good surgeon.

609
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:43,260
I wonder what old Jensen would say?

610
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,760
My luck seems to have changed,
doesn't it?

611
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,770
I don't suppose I'll ever
be a general now.

612
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,360
This Franklin...

613
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,280
...he's not a bad fellow.

614
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,530
No, not bad at all.

615
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,150
- You're sure there's a tunnel there?
- They'll never find us.

616
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,570
Well, they found us here.
Let's go. Let's go!

617
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,420
Oh, excuse me.

618
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,640
- Where is this tunnel?
- Up here, sir.

619
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,140
Where does this lead to?

620
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:17,560
We'll come out
just behind Mandrakos.

621
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,390
All right.

622
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,730
Let's keep going.

623
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,320
Anna?

624
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,540
Anna?

625
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,340
You're limping. Are you hurt?
Do you need help?

626
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,110
Thank you, old bean.

627
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:42,660
Get off your behinds.

628
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,800
Think there's a fire escape?

629
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:44,220
These are fine people.

630
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:56,540
Give up quietly, gentlemen.

631
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:02,920
Unless you want many innocent
people killed, as well as yourselves.

632
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:26,240
Turn around, please.

633
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,080
Captain Mallory, you've made
a remarkable effort.

634
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:36,250
Unfortunately, it was
doomed from the beginning.

635
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,750
Will you tell me where you've
hidden your explosives?

636
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,580
No.

637
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,750
As your commanding officer, Captain
Mallory must play a heroic role.

638
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,970
You needn't carry such a burden.

639
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:51,840
You've all suffered a great deal.
Why prolong that suffering?

640
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,100
For you, the war is over.

641
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:59,770
Another officer is coming
to question you. A captain in the SS.

642
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:03,110
His methods, quite frankly,
are most severe.

643
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:07,650
None of you are in uniform.
Therefore, you're considered spies.

644
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,530
You know the penalty for espionage.

645
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:14,990
But if any one of you has the courage
to tell me where the explosives are...

646
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,160
...I promise, you will not only
save your own life...

647
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:20,620
...but the lives of your comrades.

648
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,630
This will be your only chance.

649
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,460
I do advise you to take it.

650
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,340
Please, sir! I am no spy!
I am not one of them!

651
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:33,140
You yellow--

652
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,140
Go on.

653
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:43,310
Sir, I swear to you, sir...

654
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:46,820
...I'm just a poor fisherman.

655
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:50,860
Two days ago these men killed
my sailors and stole my boat.

656
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,490
They forced me to join them.

657
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,660
Sir, I am their prisoner!

658
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,540
Where did you learn
your English, fisherman?

659
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,500
In Cyprus, sir.

660
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,170
I swear to you, it's true.

661
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,420
Aren't you Andrea Stavros?

662
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,340
Colonel Stavros?

663
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:11,510
Oh, no. No, sir.
My name is Nondus Salonikus.

664
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,380
I told you,
I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.

665
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:20,430
Then how do you happen to wear
a shoulder holster?

666
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,900
They forced me to wear it...

667
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,570
...and made it a kind of joke.

668
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,530
Where are the explosives?

669
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,570
I swear, sir...

670
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,530
...I would tell you if I knew.

671
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,910
But, see, they didn't say.

672
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:41,950
The truth is, sir, they don't trust me.

673
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,040
I don't blame them.

674
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:59,720
The commandant will telephone
to congratulate you, Muesel.

675
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,060
Thank you.

676
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:05,730
I've questioned them about the
explosives, but they refuse to answer.

677
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,440
The Greek claims
he is not one of them.

678
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:12,900
Now you! You are not
of this company, you say?

679
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,440
No, sir, I'm not.

680
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,240
You are a liar!

681
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,160
- But Your Excellency--
- A liar!

682
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,170
Come, come. That didn't hurt.

683
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:31,590
- Where are the explosives?
- I don't know, Your Excellency.

684
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,420
Your Excellency,
I swear I do not know!

685
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,340
I am not one of these men!
They forced me to join them.

686
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,760
As I explained to the captain...

687
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,520
...I'm just a...

688
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,930
...poor fisherman from Cyprus.

689
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:47,900
My name is...

690
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,150
...Nondus Salonikus.

691
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,900
I swear to you.

692
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:59,110
These men stole my boat and then
they forced me to join them.

693
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,660
Your Excellency--

694
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:03,660
Your Excellency, I am their prisoner!

695
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:31,860
Where are the explosives?

696
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:37,240
I want an answer now, or I'll personally
rearrange this officer's splints.

697
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,500
Very well.

698
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,880
I can't!

699
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,540
Please, I can't!

700
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:55,840
I can't!

701
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:03,350
- Get up!
- I'm sick! I'm sick!

702
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,850
- Get up!
- Please! Oh, I'm sick!

703
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:14,020
But I'm sick! No, please!

704
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,360
Please, I'm sick!

705
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:17,190
I'm sick! I'm sick!

706
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:27,290
Call the sentry in.

707
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,720
<i>Now, Oberleutnant...</i>

708
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,220
...get on the phone.

709
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:47,100
Tell them you're not to be disturbed
until you give further orders.

710
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,520
Remember...

711
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,810
...I speak German...

712
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,570
...perfect.

713
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,410
Not very hygienic, I must say.

714
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,580
Shocking taste in undies too.

715
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:13,790
Ah, well...

716
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,420
Heil, everybody!

717
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Roy...

718
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,860
...we're gonna leave you here.

719
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,690
I understand.

720
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,160
We're gonna let them
chase us around for a while.

721
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:50,290
But the one thing
they mustn't know...

722
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,960
...is about the landing
tomorrow night.

723
01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:55,580
Of course.

724
01:33:58,130 --> 01:33:59,340
Don't worry.

725
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,130
Oh, thanks.

726
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,390
Good luck.

727
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,970
Hold it.

728
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,350
We'll leave Major Franklin behind.

729
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:21,730
He's a wounded officer.

730
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,530
I expect him to get medical attention.

731
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:28,870
We don't make war on wounded men.

732
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:33,250
We're not all like Hauptmann Sessler.

733
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,500
Now, where's the camp radio station?

734
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,540
I will not tell you.

735
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,260
You wouldn't hesitate to kill me
for any number of reasons.

736
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,550
But not this one.

737
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:53,680
In any event, I will not tell you.

738
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:12,240
- So long, Roy.
- Good luck, Keith.

739
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,210
Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.

740
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:24,050
Try to be a bad patient, will you?

741
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,260
Keep on asking for bedpans.
Drives them mad.

742
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,550
I'll keep it in mind.

743
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,810
When this is over,
you'll buy me a lunch.

744
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:39,190
Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,
a nice little red wine...

745
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,480
Steak and kidney pie.

746
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,400
Anything you say.
You'll be paying for it.

747
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:53,330
And you, colonel,
what a performance.

748
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:56,450
All right.

749
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:56,970
I hope you were right to leave
Franklin with the Germans.

750
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,350
Sir?

751
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:41,100
- Yes?
- No, not you, sir. Mr. Stavros.

752
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,100
Tell me about yourself.

753
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,900
- What do you want to know?
- Are you married?

754
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,570
I have been married.

755
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:54,530
My wife and children were killed.

756
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,620
Have you killed many people?

757
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,210
Only Germans.

758
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,920
Oh, some Italians too.

759
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,960
- Captain Mallory?
- Yes?

760
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:12,380
You are a lucky man.

761
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,630
Yes, I know.

762
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,760
- Mr. Stavros?
- Yes?

763
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,890
I like you.

764
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,480
I like you too.

765
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,040
I don't know.

766
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,540
Well, baby face,
I never would have known you.

767
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,290
You better get rid of that
fuzz under your nose.

768
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,460
No, I'm an officer, remember?

769
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:35,960
You just picked the wrong uniform.

770
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:44,430
Lights out in five minutes.
I want you as well-rested as possible.

771
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,680
Now, first thing in the morning...

772
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,850
...we'll ditch the truck
and get hold of another car.

773
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,690
Then we'll pick up the explosives
and go into Navarone.

774
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,490
We've got to be inside the fortress
by 10:00 tomorrow night.

775
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:00,410
Might one inquire how?

776
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,660
We're gonna walk in.

777
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:05,370
Simply because of this masquerade?

778
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:06,580
No.

779
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:13,840
Because I told Franklin
our orders had been changed.

780
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,960
That we weren't after the guns.

781
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:20,510
That we were just to create
a diversion for an assault...

782
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,470
...tomorrow night
on the Turkish side.

783
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,680
Now, if my hunch is right, the Germans
will give him scopolamine...

784
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:31,190
...and that's what he'll tell them.

785
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:35,690
They may not believe it, but they'll
be faced with the fact that he does.

786
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,360
Now I'm gambling that
they'll clear out of Navarone...

787
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:44,120
...and take up positions on the coast.

788
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,370
Very clever.

789
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:52,750
But that still leaves the garrison
inside the fortress...

790
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:57,090
...and we get them out by having
Andrea, Pappadimos and Brown...

791
01:40:57,590 --> 01:41:01,130
...start up diversions
all over Navarone.

792
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,090
If there's enough confusion going...

793
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:07,430
...Miller and I should have
a chance to break in.

794
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,390
At the same time, the girls will steal
the fastest boat they can find...

795
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,940
...so we all have a chance of
getting out when this thing is over.

796
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:19,230
Very clever, indeed.

797
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:24,740
Suppose they don't have any
scopolamine? What happens then?

798
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:29,080
Suppose they use the
old-fashioned methods?

799
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,750
Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy
just won't talk...

800
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,080
...because he's a good man?
He won't be easy to break!

801
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,090
He may take a lot of punishment
before he tells them our plan!

802
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,800
He may even die on them
and tell them nothing at all!

803
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:45,510
Have you considered that?

804
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:49,470
Yes, I have.

805
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:51,770
I'll bet you have!

806
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,440
I'll bet you've considered that
as far back as the cliff!

807
01:41:57,650 --> 01:41:58,860
You and your...

808
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:01,150
...three choices.

809
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:07,370
I'll bet that's why you dragged him
around with us all this time!

810
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,290
If he lives,
he'll never be the same again!

811
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:13,500
Do you know what you've done?

812
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:17,330
You've used up
an important human being!

813
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:23,130
Oh, I misjudged you.

814
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:27,300
You're rather a ruthless character,
Captain Mallory.

815
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:31,510
I didn't think of it back on the cliff.

816
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:33,600
But if I had...

817
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:38,480
...I'd have done the same thing.
It's our only chance!

818
01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:41,320
Well, right now I say
to hell with the job!

819
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:44,820
I've been on 100 jobs,
none of which altered the war.

820
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:49,370
There've been 1000 wars and there'll
be 1000 more, until we're all dead.

821
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:52,160
I don't care about the war anymore.
I care about Roy!

822
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:54,250
And if Turkey enters
on the wrong side?

823
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,670
So what? Let the world blow itself
to pieces, as it deserves!

824
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:01,250
What about the 2000 men on Kheros?

825
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:04,590
I don't know them.
But I do know the man on Navarone!

826
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:09,090
Mr. Miller, the man was
finished when he fell.

827
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:12,680
That's easy for you to say,
sitting there, drinking coffee!

828
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,660
It's funny. I was grateful
when you left him behind today.

829
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:32,950
I just hope before this job's over...

830
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,870
...that I get the chance to use you
the way you've used him.

831
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:43,540
I'm sorry, but I couldn't think
of any other way.

832
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:49,680
Everybody get a good night's sleep.

833
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,970
No matter how it goes tomorrow...

834
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,060
...you're gonna need it.

835
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:59,440
I'll take the first watch.

836
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:10,340
Hello.

837
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:32,280
Tell me, schoolteacher...

838
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:35,320
...from a purely moral point of view...

839
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:41,000
...bearing in mind that we represent
goodness and civilization...

840
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,920
...do you think that what I did
was a civilized thing to do?

841
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:09,130
Scopolamine.

842
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:52,850
They are burning Mandrakos...

843
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:54,520
...in punishment.

844
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:14,040
This part of town
has been evacuated...

845
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:17,370
...because the guns' vibrations
has weakened the houses.

846
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,760
Where will the attacks come?

847
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,890
On the Turkish side.

848
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:19,480
What time?

849
01:52:19,730 --> 01:52:21,400
What time?

850
01:52:50,010 --> 01:52:53,300
Is the timetable clear?
Any questions?

851
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,140
Good luck.

852
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,530
I won't be needing this. You take it.

853
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,240
Spyro.

854
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:19,120
Andrea.

855
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,340
Everybody stay where you are.

856
01:53:29,550 --> 01:53:31,470
The party's over.

857
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:34,130
Somebody's stepped on the cake.

858
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:38,350
Exhibit A: A clockwork fuse.

859
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:41,310
Elementary and archaic,
but they work.

860
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,560
This one won't work anymore.
Know why?

861
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:46,900
The clock's okay,
but the contact arm's broken off.

862
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,860
It could tick until Christmas
and not even set off a firecracker!

863
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:56,490
Exhibit B:
Exhibit B is missing.

864
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:00,870
All my slow burning fuses are gone.
Disappeared! Vanished!

865
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:04,210
Exhibit C: My time pencils.

866
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:08,000
75 grains of fulminate of mercury
in each of them.

867
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:13,380
Enough to blow my hand off.
And very unstable, very delicate.

868
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:25,690
Which means there's
a traitor in this room.

869
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,360
You're crazy.
It happened at base.

870
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:32,190
No, I'm not that crazy!
I checked it all before I left base.

871
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:34,740
No, here.

872
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,360
Here!

873
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:38,370
Someone here.

874
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:43,080
But who?

875
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:44,910
Who?

876
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:48,130
This stuff's only been
out of my sight two times.

877
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:52,590
Once was when Andrea and Maria
took it away to hide it.

878
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,470
But it was all right
when we picked it up again.

879
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,550
The only other time was
when we left it in the truck...

880
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,100
...and we scouted the gates.

881
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:03,560
All of us!

882
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,060
Except her.

883
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:12,110
We left her on guard in the truck...

884
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,610
...alone.

885
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,400
You are crazy, sir!

886
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:18,740
Let me just think for a moment.

887
01:55:24,370 --> 01:55:27,920
Since we got here, we've jumped
out of one frying pan into another.

888
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,170
Just think...

889
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:32,420
We were hiding in the carob grove...

890
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:35,590
...and she's up in a tree. Remember?

891
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:38,800
Anybody can signal an airplane
with tin or a mirror.

892
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:41,180
And they found us there,
didn't they?

893
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,100
And then in the tunnel.

894
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:47,680
In the tunnel she lagged far behind,
with a shocking limp.

895
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:49,440
Seen her limping lately?

896
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:52,820
But being behind us,
she could leave some messages.

897
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:57,400
So when you take Roy to the doctor,
the Germans are waiting for you.

898
01:55:57,610 --> 01:56:00,200
When she takes us to her place,
they come there.

899
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:01,620
But she got us out.

900
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:05,790
Of course! That house would be a
shambles and she'd be dead with us.

901
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:08,120
So, what does she do?

902
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:12,290
She disappears into the bedroom
to change her clothes...

903
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:14,800
...and to leave a little note.

904
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,920
She takes us to the wedding
and we're caught...

905
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:20,130
...because we can't get to our guns!

906
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:23,300
But even if we can, we slaughter
half of Mandrakos!

907
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:26,010
You are an insane man!

908
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:28,180
Am I?

909
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,640
Maybe I am.

910
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:32,730
Nothing surprises me anymore.

911
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,160
We can settle this thing very easily.

912
01:56:43,450 --> 01:56:46,160
Let's see those scars
the Germans made on her back...

913
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,250
...those terrible scars.

914
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,500
How about it, Maria?

915
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,170
Don't you want to see those scars?

916
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:25,490
Q.E.D.

917
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:46,090
You cannot believe it?

918
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:49,430
Believe it.

919
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,730
I cannot stand pain.

920
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:58,730
It's easy to be brave when you're free,
when you're with friends.

921
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,820
But I was caught.

922
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:05,280
The others were free but they didn't
help me. I was alone.

923
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:08,910
I was alone in their hands.

924
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:13,620
They said they would put me
into their brothels.

925
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,120
They said they would torture me.

926
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:22,300
I saw what they did to other people.

927
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:32,600
I'm sorry.
I cannot stand pain.

928
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,770
When we got here...

929
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,950
...why didn't you put in with us?

930
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:50,370
You could have come with us!

931
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,580
It was your only chance
to get free of them!

932
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:56,870
There was never any chance.

933
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:59,290
You never had any chance!

934
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:02,340
It was hopeless from the beginning.

935
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,010
You'll never get out of here!
Never!

936
01:59:07,090 --> 01:59:09,220
I tried to tell you last night.

937
01:59:25,650 --> 01:59:27,530
Can you do anything at all?

938
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:29,110
I don't know.

939
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:35,160
There's always some way
to blow up explosives.

940
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:38,120
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

941
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:42,340
But aren't you forgetting
something, captain?

942
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:44,050
The lady.

943
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:47,170
As I see it,
we have three choices:

944
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:50,390
One, we can leave her here.
But she might be found.

945
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:53,760
And in her case
they won't need a truth drug.

946
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:57,430
Two, we take her with us.
But that makes things more difficult.

947
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:59,560
And three...

948
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,070
Well, that's Andrea's choice.
Remember?

949
02:00:06,860 --> 02:00:08,740
You really want
your pound of flesh.

950
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:09,950
Yes.

951
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,030
Yes, I do.

952
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:16,080
I just couldn't manage to get
to sleep last night.

953
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:20,670
- If you're anxious to kill her, do it!
- I'm not anxious to kill her.

954
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,920
I'm not anxious to kill anyone.

955
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:27,090
See, I'm not a born soldier.
I got trapped.

956
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:29,880
You may find me facetious...

957
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:34,720
...but if I didn't make some bad jokes,
I'd go out of my mind.

958
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:37,720
No, I prefer
to leave the killing to you.

959
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:40,940
An officer and a gentleman.
A leader of men, a hero.

960
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:45,270
If you think I enjoy this, you're mad!
I never wanted it.

961
02:00:45,570 --> 02:00:48,070
I was trapped like you,
or anybody in uniform.

962
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,570
You wanted it.
You're an officer, aren't you?

963
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:54,120
I'll never want the responsibility
of an officer.

964
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:57,290
Then you've had a free ride
all this time.

965
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:02,120
Someone's got to be responsible.
Do you think it's easy?

966
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:03,920
I don't know!

967
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:09,300
I'm beginning to wonder who is
responsible to do the dirty work.

968
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:13,180
Is the man who gives the orders guilty,
or the one who has to do it?

969
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:16,300
- We've no time for this.
- Now just a minute!

970
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:20,730
If we're gonna get this job done,
she has got to be killed!

971
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:24,860
And we all know how keen you are
on getting the job done.

972
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:28,280
I've never killed a woman before,
traitor or not...

973
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,150
...and I'm finicky.

974
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:35,120
So why don't you do it?
Why don't you let us off for once?

975
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:38,450
Come on, be a pal.
Be a father to your men.

976
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:43,460
Come down off your cross,
close your eyes and pull the trigger!

977
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:45,000
What do you say, sir?

978
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:11,420
You all know what you
have to do. Get started.

979
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:14,710
Brown, you go with Maria.

980
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:48,960
Now, you know when you put on
a uniform and learn how to do it...

981
02:03:49,170 --> 02:03:51,420
...it's not hard to kill anyone.

982
02:03:51,590 --> 02:03:53,420
Sometimes it's harder not to.

983
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:58,760
You think you've been getting away
with it all this time, standing by.

984
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:00,180
Well, son...

985
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:03,600
...your "bystanding" days are over.

986
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:06,640
You're in it now, up to your neck!

987
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:10,940
They say you're a genius with
explosives. Start proving it!

988
02:04:11,150 --> 02:04:13,610
You got me in the mood
to use this thing...

989
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:17,780
...and by God, if you don't think
of something, I'll use it on you!

990
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:19,490
I mean it.

991
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:22,280
Go on.

992
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:16,800
You stay here.
I'll call you if I need you.

993
02:10:17,010 --> 02:10:18,220
Whatever you say, sir.

994
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:54,910
Spyro!

995
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:58,200
Spyro!

996
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:36,780
Detonators, sir, please.

997
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,960
I'll be finished here in about
30 seconds.

998
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:32,050
Miller?

999
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:37,680
Miller!

1000
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:51,320
- Miller!
- Yes, what is it?

1001
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:02,580
What are you doing?

1002
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:05,830
They'll search those guns first
and find my stuff.

1003
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,710
They're not stupid.

1004
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,340
But if they remove it carelessly,
they could have the same result.

1005
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:15,340
But I'm banking on this job
being our insurance.

1006
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,180
- What happens?
- Would you bring down the hoist?

1007
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:30,690
Whoa, that's enough!

1008
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:32,610
See this bottom runner?

1009
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:36,820
When they send this hoist down for
shells or charges, it'll come here.

1010
02:19:37,030 --> 02:19:40,370
It'll hit these
two wires and we get a circuit...

1011
02:19:40,530 --> 02:19:43,540
...that'll send up
all my plastic explosives here...

1012
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:46,870
...plus this little item...

1013
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:49,630
...that I borrowed here.

1014
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:54,050
They won't see these wires
under the grease.

1015
02:19:54,590 --> 02:19:56,380
Are you sure it'll work?

1016
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:59,550
No guarantee, but the theory's
perfectly feasible.

1017
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:01,850
But if this stuff goes up...

1018
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:05,100
...everything else in this place
will go up with it.

1019
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:07,890
Suppose you don't get a contact?

1020
02:20:08,730 --> 02:20:12,480
Then I'll be responsible for sinking
one of the destroyers...

1021
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:14,730
...maybe the whole lot of them.

1022
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:19,110
I'm sorry, sir. it's the only way
I know to get the job done.

1023
02:20:19,570 --> 02:20:21,410
As you said, I'm in it now...

1024
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:23,160
...up to my neck.

1025
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:32,250
Hurry up.

1026
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:08,000
- Go ahead.
- After you.

1027
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:10,160
Remember? I can't swim.

1028
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:13,290
You won't let me drown, will you?

1029
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:03,340
I can't make it.

1030
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,130
My arm...

1031
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:14,810
Come on, man. Take it!

1032
02:24:16,730 --> 02:24:18,060
Grab it!

1033
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:14,320
Spyro's dead, isn't he?

1034
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:17,490
What happened?

1035
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:22,330
He forgot why we came here.

1036
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:55,660
And now you're going back to Crete?

1037
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:57,870
Yes.

1038
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:01,710
Come with us.

1039
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:04,000
With us?

1040
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:06,340
With me.

1041
02:33:06,630 --> 02:33:08,170
I must go back.

1042
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:11,510
You saw what the Germans did
to Mandrakos.

1043
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:15,890
Navarone will pay heavily for
your success tonight.

1044
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:24,900
Come on,
I'll give you a hand.

1045
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:26,190
I'm going back.

1046
02:33:28,070 --> 02:33:30,200
The job is finished.

1047
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:31,700
Your job is finished.

1048
02:33:32,410 --> 02:33:36,160
What chance do you think you have
of staying alive back there?

1049
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:40,120
I'm not so easy to kill.

1050
02:33:45,130 --> 02:33:46,460
Hey.

1051
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:23,460
Well, the boys on Kheros
will be happy soon.

1052
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:28,500
It'll be crowded, but
there's nothing like an ocean voyage:

1053
02:34:28,750 --> 02:34:32,260
Fresh air, good food,
deck sports, pretty girls...

1054
02:34:39,770 --> 02:34:42,100
I'd like to offer you
my apologies...

1055
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:44,100
...and my congratulations.

1056
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:55,610
The truth is,
I didn't think we could do it.

1057
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,490
To tell you the truth,
neither did I.
