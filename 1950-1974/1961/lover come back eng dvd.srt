1
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,688
This is Madison Avenue,
center of the advertising world.

2
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,438
In these steel and concrete
beehives are born the ideas

3
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,319
that decide what we will
eat, drink, drive and smoke,

4
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,721
and how we will dress, sleep,
shave and smell.

5
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:44,359
In all beehives,
there are workers and drones.

6
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:49,728
This is a worker.

7
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,801
Thank you.

8
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,206
And this is a drone.

9
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,042
Jerry, Honey...

10
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:08,757
You're at work.

11
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,163
Good night, darling.
- Good night.

12
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,129
Wait!

13
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,728
What kind of good-night kiss is that?
We're not married.

14
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,722
My,
what a way to go to work!

15
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,324
That's a woman!

16
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:36,606
Make you homesick, Fred?

17
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,968
Yeah. Makes me sick
we're going home next week.

18
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,640
Bracket,
McGalpin & Gaines, advertising.

19
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,207
I'll give him the message.

20
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,725
Dorothy, Mr. Bracket in yet?
- No.

21
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,122
Tell merchandising, copy and art
there's a meeting. Right away!

22
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:58,641
Miss Templeton wants merchandising,
copy and art in her office.

23
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,927
On the double!
Looks like a rough day.

24
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,967
Good morning, Mr. Webster.

25
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,043
Good morning.

26
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,842
Would you send a tomato juice,
black coffee and a masseur?

27
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,249
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,601
Mr. Webster wants tomato juice,
black coffee and a masseur.

29
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,318
Looks like a rough night.

30
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,722
Miller's Wax is changing agencies.
We can get the account.

31
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,485
Miller's coming tonight.
Find out where he's staying.

32
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,484
I want an appointment in the morning.
- You can't work out a plan by then.

33
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,164
We can and we will.

34
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,129
Here's some thoughts I had.
Tighten them up.

35
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,680
Tell research I want a complete
rundown on J. Paxton Miller.

36
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,446
His packaging, distribution, sales,
and strong and weak market areas.

37
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:58,364
Kelly, what's new
in our gray flannel jungle?

38
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:02,682
The natives are restless.
Miller is to pick up a new agency.

39
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,649
The account's up for grabs.

40
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,165
Let's grab. Where's he from?

41
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,605
Richmond, Virginia.

42
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,083
Get me a book on the civil war
and a complete rundown on Miller.

43
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,964
Family? Will his wife be with him?

44
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,520
What liquor does he drink?
What kind of girls does he like?

45
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,558
That's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

46
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,802
Develop it further, Leonard.
- And here...

47
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,277
This isn't bad either.
But what color's that floor?

48
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:38,689
Lilac.

49
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,804
Lilac? Who has
a lilac floor in their kitchen?

50
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:44,809
I have.

51
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,324
Well, everyone
isn't as artistic as you are.

52
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:58,278
We have to sell this wax
to average, ordinary people.

53
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,689
Them!

54
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:04,000
Carol, I've photographed
this can of wax from every angle.

55
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,401
With every kind of lighting.
I just can't make it look good.

56
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,928
You may have hit
on the key to the whole thing.

57
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,401
This can - it's unattractive.
- So?

58
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,447
So, Leonard designs a new one.

59
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,567
When? It's ten thirty!

60
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:23,324
We'll be here half the night!

61
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,165
Believe me,
the agency that lands this account

62
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,925
is the one
that shows the most attractive can.

63
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,488
Most attractive!

64
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,198
More bourbon, Mr. Miller?
- Just a touch.

65
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,449
Yes, sir. She's most attractive.

66
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:55,363
You know, I'd like to meet her.
- You're going to.

67
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,160
We're having a party
with those rabbits, I mean, girls.

68
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll drink to that!

69
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,639
More bourbon?
- Just a touch.

70
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,043
Rebel Davis...

71
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:13,726
She's distantly related to Jefferson
Davis, our great leader.

72
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,562
Did you say "our" leader?

73
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,924
I was raised here in the North,

74
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:22,321
but my heart remains
loyal to my birthplace, Virginia.

75
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,277
You're a Virginia boy?
- Richmond!

76
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,122
That's where I'm from!

77
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:30,362
You are kidding.
- Born and raised.

78
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,442
Well! To Richmond!
- Of course!

79
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,678
So you one
of them Virginia Websters!

80
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,762
My great-grandfather
fought with the Virginia volunteers.

81
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,802
So did my granddaddy.

82
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,326
He fell during Picket's Charge.
- Mine too!

83
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,005
He was following that great
Captain Elijah E. Miller.

84
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,124
That was my granddaddy!

85
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,361
Mr. Miller,
this is a hallowed moment.

86
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,519
More bourbon?
- Just a touch.

87
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:21,439
Son, you hear that?
They're playin' our song!

88
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,440
On your feet, Yankees!

89
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,965
That's what I call a party!

90
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,837
Gee, I'm sorry I missed it.

91
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,525
What happened to the house detective?

92
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:57,922
I don't know if he jumped,
or somebody pushed him.

93
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,123
Penthouse, please.

94
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,804
You're a little late for the party.

95
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,645
Was the party at Mr. Miller's?
- Not a party...

96
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,528
The party!

97
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:13,399
How about stopping off at my pad?

98
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,403
What for?
- Look what I'm takin' home.

99
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,039
You think that's somethin'

100
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:23,289
Hi!

101
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,048
Excuse me.

102
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,637
I'm looking for Mr. Miller.

103
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,281
You'll never find me.

104
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,608
Mr. Miller?

105
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:32,398
Sir, I'm Carol Templeton,
with Bracket, McGalpin & Gaines.

106
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,920
Have a sit down.

107
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,560
I have an appointment
to talk about handling your account.

108
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:41,278
I've signed
with Jerry Webster.

109
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,038
Jerry...

110
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:49,285
Of Ramsey & Son?
- Of the 19th Virginia Volunteers.

111
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,961
But I worked up
a complete presentation,

112
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,087
a whole campaign.

113
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,808
Even a new container.
Here, let me show you.

114
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,282
I can't. I'm flying back to Richmond.
- When?

115
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,805
Now, honey. Now.

116
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,923
We just passing over Pittsburgh.

117
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:15,006
Mr. Miller,
please open your eyes.

118
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:18,686
Why? I've seen everything.

119
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,441
Just a touch.

120
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,247
Mr. Bracket, this man Webster
is a disgrace to the business.

121
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,560
He should be barred.

122
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,719
I'd like nothing better.
It's not the first one he's taken.

123
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,280
Then go to the advertising council.

124
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,645
Charge him with unethical conduct!

125
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:02,758
Who do you think will testify?
Miller? The girls?

126
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,524
There's no law against entertaining.

127
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,966
There must be a law against
that kind of entertaining.

128
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,485
It was a Roman orgy!

129
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,119
I saw this girl carried out

130
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,522
in a bass fiddle case. You can
imagine what else went on.

131
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:20,649
Yes!

132
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,088
Mr. Bracket! Surely you don't
condone Webster's methods!

133
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:30,401
Course not.
No ethical agency does.

134
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,882
Then how does he get away with it?
Ramsey & Son has a fine reputation.

135
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:40,961
The old man ruled with an iron hand.
His son doesn't know what's going on.

136
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,678
Then it's time
somebody told him!

137
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,246
Miss Templeton,
you've only been with us a while.

138
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:51,801
We've learned to live with Webster.
He's like the common cold:

139
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,769
You know you'll
get it once or twice a year.

140
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,527
There are two ways
to handle a cold:

141
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,523
You can fight it,
or give in and go to bed with it.

142
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,844
I intend to fight it!

143
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,847
Wait here.

144
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:18,641
That's a cab zone, buddy.

145
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,120
I am not your buddy.

146
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,087
I happen to be Peter Ramsey.

147
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:25,878
I don't care if you're Peter Rabbit.
Beat it!

148
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,325
How would you like a fat lip?

149
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,764
Fine, fine.

150
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:33,081
Harrison...
Give him a fat lip.

151
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,007
Okay, so park there.

152
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,400
Hope Mr. Webster
won't get angry.

153
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,802
I assume full responsibility.
I am his employer.

154
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,201
All right, Mr. Webster. Hear this!

155
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:21,838
It's been brought to my attention that
you're guilty of unbecoming conduct.

156
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:26,640
You have embarked on this course
without my knowledge or consent.

157
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,485
My father, the commodore,
would not brook insubordination.

158
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:34,120
By thunder,
neither will I!

159
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,966
I demand a full and complete
explanation, or heads will roll!

160
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:43,844
Speak up man, I'm waiting.

161
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:53,640
Do you realize what you broke?
That was to build my confidence.

162
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:58,964
I ought to break your neck,
barging in on me. - Take it easy!

163
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,559
I've had a rough morning. Took a
tongue-lashing from Carol Templeton.

164
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:05,969
Who's that?

165
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,923
New executive
at Bracket, McGalpin and Gaines.

166
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,885
She accused you
of pirating the Miller Wax account

167
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,644
by getting him tipsy and a girl.

168
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,166
That's not true. I got him loaded,
and there were seven girls.

169
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:22,604
Just a moment...

170
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm head of the company!

171
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,448
You're accountable to me.

172
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:38,246
I leave the bridge,
and you steer the ship on the rocks.

173
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,039
I demand to know if your
conduct was in the firm's interest.

174
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:47,489
That's sadistic.

175
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:53,043
You listen to me. I was up all night
in the interest of Ramsey and Son.

176
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:57,078
I landed a $5 million account
in the interest of Ramsey and Son.

177
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,879
You haven't been
in the office for two months.

178
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,440
And that's in the interest
of Ramsey and Son.

179
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,202
I have very good reason for that.

180
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,677
It depresses the employees.

181
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,399
I discussed it with my analyst,
Dr. Melnick. He understands.

182
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,164
He says I depressed him too.

183
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:23,846
He's only human. - You don't know
what a handicap it is to be born rich.

184
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,878
Some handicap. - Don't sneer.
Wealthy people are hated.

185
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,122
What's written on the Statue of
Liberty? "Send me your rich"?

186
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,646
No, "Send me your poor."
We're not welcome in our own country.

187
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,279
You're one of the lucky ones.

188
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:40,123
You were born in the slums.
- That's lucky?

189
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,602
You had everything going for
you: Poverty, squalor...

190
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:49,207
There was only one way to go:
Up. But I did it the hard way.

191
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,883
Done what?

192
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,406
Taken over Ramsey and Son.

193
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,563
As president, I've a right to know
what's been going on.

194
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:02,166
Well, I'll tell you.
I've landed 10 new accounts.

195
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:05,083
There's a lot more to advertising.

196
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:08,049
The big job
is selling the product.

197
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,998
Gimme a well-stacked dame
in a bathing suit, I'll sell anything.

198
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,879
Girls again!
What's the obsession with girls?

199
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,520
I was a poor kid, remember?
I didn't have toys to play with.

200
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,162
See. Told you
it's a handicap to be rich.

201
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,441
Get me that green tie.
- Right.

202
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,966
What about Miss Templeton?
What am I gonna say?

203
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:33,369
Nothing.

204
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,039
I'll say it for you.
- Oh good.

205
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,247
Tell her...

206
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,365
'
we re very sorry.

207
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,408
And that if she's willing to forgive,

208
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,562
that henceforth we'll
conduct ourselves beyond reproach.

209
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,847
Carol Templeton, please.
Jerry Webster calling.

210
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:57,720
Ramsey and Son. - Assure her
of our high moral character.

211
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,282
Yes, Mr. Webster. - Mr. Ramsey tells
me you spoke to him.

212
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:07,160
I'd like to ask you a favor. Kindly
keep your nose out of my business.

213
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:11,562
If the competition's too tough,
get out of the profession.

214
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,437
You aren't even in
the advertising profession.

215
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:18,319
I ought to tell you your profession.
- Tell me anyway.

216
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:22,927
Let me put it this way,
I don't use sex to land an account.

217
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,320
When do you use it?
- I don't!

218
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,243
My condolences to your husband.

219
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,278
I'm not married.
- That figures.

220
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:34,725
What do you mean, that figures?

221
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:37,199
A husband would be competition.

222
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:40,248
There's only room for one man
in a family.

223
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:44,608
Let me tell you something:
I wish I were a man right now...

224
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,125
Keep trying. You'll make it.

225
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,281
Milly, get me the number
of a Miss Rebel Davis.

226
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:04,725
She works at the Bunny Club.

227
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:11,002
Your trouble is you're
living in your father's shadow.

228
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:16,563
You're even afraid to get rid of
his car. - He dominated me.

229
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,203
Just once,
I spoke back to him.

230
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,638
He cut a switch from a tree
and gave me a whipping.

231
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,119
In front of this girl.

232
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:30,043
It was a shattering experience.

233
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,405
Pete, all kids get whippings.

234
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,643
But I was 25.
The girl was my fiancee.

235
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,561
Hello?
- You no-good, lowdown liar.

236
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:44,847
Rebel, honey, what's the trouble?
- There's trouble?

237
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,683
You promised
I was gonna be the Miller Wax girl

238
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:52,162
and now Mr. Miller says
there ain't even gonna be one!

239
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,844
Carol Templeton surely was right.

240
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,001
Carol Templeton?

241
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,525
Are we in trouble?
- When did you talk to her?

242
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,719
She wants me to go to the ad council
and tell them about those parties.

243
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:06,562
I'm gonna do it!

244
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,767
Don't you go near the ad council!
I'll be over.

245
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,887
We're in trouble?
- I can handle it.

246
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,723
As head, I've a right to know.

247
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:18,678
Yes, we're in trouble.
- You shouldn't have told me.

248
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:21,921
You get outta here!

249
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:27,448
Now, honey,
let's talk this over.

250
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,999
I'll do my talking to the ad council.

251
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:35,085
Sugar Lump!
- I am not your sugar lump!

252
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,525
So stop nibbling on me.

253
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,727
You've been promising
to put me on TV for two years.

254
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,120
Baby! Baby!

255
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:49,760
You are not gonna nibble
your way out of this one!

256
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,161
I'm gonna tell that
advertising council plenty!

257
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:57,729
Okay.

258
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:04,241
Tell 'em there isn't any Miller Wax
girl, but also tell 'em why.

259
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:09,928
Tell 'em I cancelled when they were
gonna hide that glorious figure.

260
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:13,605
That's like hiding a Rembrandt
under a dishtowel.

261
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,924
Tell 'em everything. Tell 'em...

262
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:22,322
how I turned down, for two years,
sponsor after sponsor,

263
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,882
looking for
the right product,

264
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:29,281
the perfect product
for you to represent.

265
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,566
Tell 'em
I finally found one.

266
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:41,162
What is it?

267
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:43,523
Something...

268
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,727
woulda made you more famous
than Miss Rheingold.

269
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,881
Well, what is it?

270
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,040
A brand new product.

271
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,482
It's, uh, different. It's...

272
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:58,642
exciting...

273
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,880
Well, what is it?

274
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,768
Well, it's, uh...

275
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:07,204
VIPS ARRIVE FOR CONGRESS

276
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:09,449
Vip.

277
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:11,769
Vip?

278
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,758
I was gonna make you the Vip Girl.

279
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,524
What's Vip?
- Vip?

280
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,727
It's the product that
woulda brought you fame and fortune.

281
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:27,644
The key that
woulda opened the key to Hollywood.

282
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,005
And you turned it down.

283
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,604
No, I didn't!

284
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:35,443
Jerry! Jerry, wait, honey!

285
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:39,444
I didn't turn it down.
- Same thing.

286
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:42,488
We're filming the Vip commercials
at one o'clock.

287
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,449
I've got to pick out another girl.
- Oh no you don't.

288
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,966
I wanna be the Vip Girl.
- You had your chance.

289
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,643
Please, don't go.

290
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,524
Come back. Give me another chance.

291
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,079
I'll do anything you say.

292
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:59,481
Please!
- Well, I...

293
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,240
Well, all right...

294
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,208
It's him!

295
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:13,124
Let's face it, Charlie.
Either you've got or you haven't.

296
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,042
He's got it.

297
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,239
Vip commercial, number 3.

298
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,440
Okay, Rebel, action.

299
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:28,328
Hi there, I'm the Vip Girl.

300
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:33,364
Everything I've got,

301
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,487
I owe to Vip.

302
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:41,244
I'm just a slave to any man
who uses Vip.

303
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:49,407
Good things have been happening
since I discovered Vip.

304
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:54,248
I got my man
when I got Vip.

305
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:01,443
Oh yes, folks,
everything I got...

306
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:05,084
I owe to Vip.

307
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,961
Cut.
- That's it.

308
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:11,922
Wrap it up.
- Thanks.

309
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:15,765
What do you want done with the ads?
- Put them on the shelf.

310
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,841
On the shelf?

311
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,003
Call me about it later.
Rebel, you were fabulous.

312
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:26,004
Do you think they'll like me?
- Honey, single-handed...

313
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:29,446
you may bring in the
forty-inch screen.

314
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:33,159
When are they gonna be on?
- Well, I...

315
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:39,364
I haven't got the deal lock up yet.
When they see you, it's in the bag.

316
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,842
Hurry, you're due at the ad council.
- I don't wanna testify against you.

317
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,605
Don't worry, you won't.
- But they're gonna ask questions.

318
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:51,684
Here are the answers.
Memorize this.

319
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,284
Wear this around your neck.

320
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,280
Couldn't I just not show up?

321
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,882
That won't stop Templeton.
This will.

322
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:04,804
Don't worry,
I'll tell you every move to make.

323
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:10,725
Wait, what's this? Very-tass et...
- Veritas

324
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:13,882
et probitas super omnia.

325
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:17,042
That's Latin. That means:

326
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,724
Truth and honor,

327
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:21,687
above all.

328
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,526
That's Mr. Webster's motto?
- It's the code by which he lives.

329
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:30,439
Many's the night
he's walked me to my door,

330
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:34,922
bowed, kissed my hand
and said, "Rebel...

331
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:39,402
Veritas et probitas super omnia."

332
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,288
This is ridiculous!

333
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:45,761
Miss Templeton,
please stop challenging your witness.

334
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,285
Obviously, she's been coached.

335
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:51,487
Or bribed.
He gave you something, didn't he?

336
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:52,889
Sit down!

337
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:58,361
It's true. He did give me something.

338
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,009
This.

339
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:12,884
He asked me to wear it over my heart.
He got it in the army.

340
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:16,561
Gentlemen,
it's the good conduct medal.

341
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:20,442
Oh well!
- Would you care to look?

342
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:23,288
Yes, indeed.

343
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,484
Most inspiring.
May I?

344
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:37,603
Takes me back a few years...

345
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:39,158
to my own army days.

346
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,281
Magnificent!

347
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:53,688
Miss Templeton...
- Would you move on?

348
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:58,844
Gentlemen, if we're through
admiring Mr. Webster's trophies,

349
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,968
I'd like to ask Miss Davis
to tell us about that wild party

350
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,203
he threw last night.
- The revival meeting?

351
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,365
Mr. Webster held a revival?

352
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,245
Revival is right!
Everyone there had to be revived.

353
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:18,688
You're making serious charges
against a man who is not here.

354
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,878
That's a very interesting point.
Why isn't he here?

355
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:25,849
Miss Davis,
do you know where Mr. Webster is?

356
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:28,849
He's at the Red Cross, donating blood.

357
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:32,878
They wouldn't take his blood.
It's 86 proof!

358
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,359
Why would he be there now?

359
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:39,125
That's where he's
meeting his Boy Scout troop.

360
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:42,839
He's a Scout leader?
- He's taking them on a hike

361
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,240
to Inspiration Point.

362
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,205
At the top of the Chrysler building.

363
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:52,958
The top of the Chrysler building
is not Inspiration Point.

364
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,603
It is to Mr. Webster.

365
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,487
It looks down on Madison Avenue.

366
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:06,489
Miss Templeton?

367
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:09,238
Have you anything further to say?

368
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:11,049
Yes.

369
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:14,437
I'd like my body sent back
to the agency.

370
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:26,560
That was quite a performance,
Miss Davis.

371
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:29,847
You ain't mad at me?
- Oh no!

372
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:35,962
You should be an actress.
- I am. I'm goin' to Hollywood,

373
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,485
just as soon as I'm famous
as the Vip Girl.

374
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:41,646
The Vip Girl?

375
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,882
What's Vip?
- It's a brand-new product.

376
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:49,043
Mr. Webster's tryin'
to get the account.

377
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,160
This will be my big chance.

378
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:58,128
And mine!

379
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,565
Milly, drop what you're doing.
We're after the Vip account.

380
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,688
The what account?
- Vip. V-l-P.

381
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:10,523
Never heard of it.
- Find out about it.

382
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:15,525
Jerry Webster's trying to land it,
but we're gonna beat him to it.

383
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:18,727
Are you sure?
He fights rough.

384
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:22,804
Then we'll fight rough!
This is war, Milly!

385
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,359
That means
liquor, wild parties and girls.

386
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,088
Right?
- Right.

387
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:29,719
I'd like to volunteer
for frontline duty.

388
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:33,919
Well, my boy, we did it.

389
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,639
We've been absolved by the council.
- Yes.

390
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,804
We really put that Templeton woman
in her place. - "We" did.

391
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:46,645
We deserve a reward.
A vacation.

392
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:50,246
We're gonna go to dad's hunting lodge
in Canada and do nothing:

393
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:52,685
No radio, no television, no phones.

394
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,479
A thousand miles from the nearest
sponsor. - Sounds great.

395
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:00,040
Is it all right
for you to be away from Dr. Melnick?

396
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,923
Must be,
he's the one who suggested it.

397
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,397
What do you say,
you go upstairs and pack?

398
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,481
No, I'm gonna go to the office.

399
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:14,199
You go pack, I'll handle things.
- You?

400
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,918
Melnick says
I've gotta start making decisions.

401
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:21,686
Good, grand.
- That man has worked miracles.

402
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:25,604
Everyone should go through analysis.
- Not everyone can afford it.

403
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:29,365
That's the tragedy of it.
Look at these poor people.

404
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:33,081
They go through life,
contented, happy, laughing,

405
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:35,923
never knowing how sick they are.

406
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:40,240
You're sick! Sick!

407
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:46,118
Just a minute, you can't come in
here. Who are you?

408
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:48,485
I'm Peter Ramsey.

409
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,244
Oh, Mr. Ramsey.

410
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,527
Who are you?
- I'm your secretary.

411
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,237
You're not Elsie.
- No, I'm Deborah.

412
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:04,167
Elsie got married. Jerry...
Mr. Webster hired me.

413
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,441
Well, if there are any calls,
I'm not in.

414
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:12,078
Yes, sir.

415
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,649
Yeah?

416
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:39,607
How are we in the copy department?

417
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:42,079
On the ball? Got the big picture?

418
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:45,720
Come on, nutsy, who is this?
- This is the boss.

419
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.
- This is Peter Ramsey. Who is this?

420
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,809
Hello?

421
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,964
Memo. To all departments.

422
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:08,678
Subject: Insubordination.

423
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,159
Certain department heads...

424
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:17,848
Yes, Hadley, come in.
- Oh, Mr. Ramsey, I...

425
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:21,719
I was looking for Mr. Webster.
- Anything I can handle?

426
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:25,599
No, sir.
I need a decision.

427
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:29,046
Now look here, Hadley.
I happen to be company president.

428
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,519
I'll make the decisions.

429
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,318
It really isn't important.

430
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:38,847
I'll decide what's important!
Now, what is it?

431
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:45,320
Commco Film Studios are calling
and wanna know what to do with the...

432
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:48,766
Vip commercials
that Mr. Webster made.

433
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,169
Yes.

434
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:52,648
Well...

435
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:58,798
What do we usually do
with commercials? We show them.

436
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:03,088
Mr. Webster didn't brief me
on the Vip account.

437
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,238
Well, it's a lucky thing
I'm here.

438
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,844
Are you familiar with the account?

439
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,484
Who d'you think got the deal?

440
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,920
Oh. Well, congratulations, sir.

441
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:24,841
With a new product, Mr. Webster
starts off with a campaign on TV,

442
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,683
you know, to get the ball rolling.

443
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:33,209
Let's forget Mr. Webster, shall we?
I'm rolling this ball. - Yes, sir.

444
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,888
We'll start off
with a campaign on TV.

445
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,969
Yes, sir. Right away.

446
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:01,078
Dr. Melnick,

447
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:04,242
Peter Ramsey. I've done it, Doc.

448
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,642
I made a decision.
And it was a beauty!

449
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:12,289
425 dollars for a private detective?

450
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:13,689
Why?

451
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:16,963
To find Jerry Webster
and track down the Vip account.

452
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,200
Did you find him?

453
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:23,565
No.
- Did you find out who makes Vip?

454
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:28,118
No...
- Did you find out what Vip is?

455
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:33,239
No. But...
- As long as it's money well spent.

456
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:37,958
I want you to forget the Vip account.
Webster's got it.

457
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,680
But I don't believe it.

458
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,879
Rebel Davis, the Vip Girl herself,
told me he didn't have the account.

459
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:49,599
That same day, he disappeared.
Something is wrong.

460
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,002
What about all those commercials
on television all week?

461
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,920
I still say something's wrong.

462
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:03,323
Mr. Bracket, please give me more time
and I'll prove it to you.

463
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:07,489
Okay.

464
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:13,999
But if this detective doesn't find
what you're looking for,

465
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,798
there's something else he might
find for you.

466
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,689
A new job?
- Exactly.

467
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,240
I already told him.

468
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,999
This is the forest primeval,

469
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:39,799
just as it was
at the dawn of civilization.

470
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:42,803
And this is how
the first man explored it:

471
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,040
In a birch bark canoe,

472
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:49,328
pitting his skill and strength
against the forces of nature.

473
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:53,039
Survival of the fittest,
that's the law here.

474
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:10,685
Harrison has run out of road.
- Good, he might scare the game.

475
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:18,838
What is that?
- The mating call of the moose.

476
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,443
This call
is absolutely irresistible.

477
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:30,207
Your bull moose will run 20 miles
to get to the source of this call.

478
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,686
And then what happens?
- I take his picture.

479
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:41,522
Pete, he's not running 20 miles
to get photographed.

480
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:43,726
I suggest you stop blowing that.

481
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:46,279
You just leave
the decisions to me.

482
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:49,249
The same wise leadership that

483
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:54,006
saved us from a costly blunder will
see us through. - Costly blunder?

484
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:58,289
You've been so relaxed,
I haven't wanted to tell ya.

485
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:03,399
You've goofed. If it weren't for me,
those Vip ads wouldn't be on air.

486
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:05,603
They're on?

487
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:08,842
A saturation campaign, my boy.

488
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:14,964
Now, Pete, don't panic. Turn around!

489
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:19,044
What's wrong? - Turn around!
- What's wrong? - We've got to go.

490
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:21,360
What's wrong?
- Start paddling!

491
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:24,681
I have a right to know!
- There's no such product!

492
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,289
But...

493
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:31,558
But you made films!
- They were to keep Rebel in line.

494
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:34,119
I told ya
sex would get you into trouble!

495
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:36,719
Never mind me. Convince that fella!

496
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,244
Here she is!

497
00:37:55,889 --> 00:38:00,485
Look at these letters.
Drugstores, wholesalers calling.

498
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:02,527
All these people want Vip.

499
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:06,922
We've sold a product that doesn't
exist. We've ruined the agency!

500
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,638
Relax, Pete.
- Dad'll kill me!

501
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:13,166
Your dad's dead and gone!
- No, he isn't.

502
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,208
He wouldn't leave this
business with someone like me.

503
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:19,328
Don't just sit there.
Let's do something!

504
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:24,961
Send Hadley in.
- That's it. We'll pin the rap on him.

505
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,959
Sure! It's our word against his.
Let them break Hadley.

506
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:32,042
He's not a senior executive.
He's expendable.

507
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,360
That's how Dad would've done it.

508
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:39,608
Come in,
come in, Hadley.

509
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:44,083
Webster has something to tell ya.

510
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,761
Telephone Commco Films.
We wanna make more Vip commercials.

511
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:50,399
More commercials?
- On the double!

512
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:55,288
Right. - Are you out of your mind?
There's no such product as Vip.

513
00:38:55,689 --> 00:39:00,160
People wanna spend their money on
Vip. It's only fair we give it them.

514
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:03,720
Where do we get it?
- We invent it.

515
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:07,922
Can we do that?
- Why not?

516
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:10,638
That's not the way it's done.

517
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:16,564
You're supposed to have the product
first. Then you go out and sell it.

518
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,288
Pete! You are pioneering a method
that'll make you a legend. - It will?

519
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:27,443
The most convincing demonstration
of the power of advertising.

520
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,285
You have sold a product
that doesn't exist.

521
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,839
Yes! By thunder!

522
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,967
Even Dad didn't do that.
- Right.

523
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,088
I don't think I better either.
- You have no choice.

524
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:42,049
We come up with Vip or you're ruined.

525
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:48,604
Kelly, I want five $1,000 bills
and the address of Dr. Linus Tyler.

526
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:50,124
Linus Tyler?

527
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:54,363
Only he can come up with Vip.
- No. He's a troublemaker.

528
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:58,284
He's been fired by 3 companies.
- He's brilliant and needs money.

529
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,964
No. Money can't buy him.

530
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:04,759
As Dad always said, don't
trust a man who can't be bribed.

531
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,127
Isn't it comforting to know
you can trust me?

532
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,158
Boss, your private eye called.
Webster's back in town.

533
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,400
He followed him to this address.

534
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:22,518
Dr. Linus Tyler. Who's he?
- He won a Nobel prize in chemistry.

535
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:27,161
He did that testimonial for
Mother Murphy's Home-made Soup.

536
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:33,041
They asked him to analyze the soup
and say what Mother Murphy put in it.

537
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:36,646
He did. Broke the company
and jailed Mother Murphy.

538
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:43,160
Milly, why would Jerry Webster
be interested in a brilliant chemist?

539
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:46,049
Vip?

540
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:47,769
Vip.

541
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:51,003
I'll bet Tyler's the inventor!

542
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:04,446
You're wasting your time.

543
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,159
Nothing could induce me

544
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:11,039
to again associate myself
with that dull group, the human race.

545
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:14,885
That's a very wise decision.
You've quit the world!

546
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:19,077
They didn't appreciate me,
now let them suffer.

547
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,321
They want to be misled.

548
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:26,803
I invented a hair tonic superior
to anything else.

549
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:28,642
Would the public buy it?

550
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:34,567
Not until they were told it contained
a secret ingredient: TR2748.

551
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:38,120
Do you know what TR2748 was?

552
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,565
My phone number.

553
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:44,928
Now with Vip, the idiots
have reached the millenium.

554
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,440
They've bought nothing!

555
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:50,168
That's right.

556
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:55,039
Unless you come up with something.
- Never!

557
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:58,688
Here, in the comfort of
my laboratory, I'm happy...

558
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:04,800
and have the companionship of the one
person worthy of my company:

559
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:06,609
Myself.

560
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,560
I want for nothing.

561
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:13,118
You're one man who can do it.

562
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:16,919
I will never again
prostitute my genius.

563
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:21,046
Not for all the gold
on Madison Avenue.

564
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:28,598
How soon do you need it?

565
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:31,318
Welcome
back to the world, Doctor.

566
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:45,521
We're completely versatile.
Vip can be anything:

567
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:49,842
Soft drink, skin lotion, soap,
cigarettes, toothpaste, anything.

568
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:52,717
The important thing is speed.

569
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:56,724
If I can help you in any way...
- It's very kind of you.

570
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:01,361
If you'll carry on here,
I'll get some supplies. - Fine.

571
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,084
Doctor Tyler?
- Oh, I... - Carol Templeton.

572
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:16,803
Carol Templeton.

573
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:24,325
I would like to talk about Vip.
It is your product, isn't it?

574
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,958
Yes, I invented it.
- Good.

575
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:33,888
Doctor, have you signed
with Jerry Webster? - Why?

576
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:39,443
I'm with another agency. And
I have some marvelous ideas

577
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:41,919
for Vip.
- Really?

578
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:45,799
If you don't like what I've got,
I'll get more. - Fair enough.

579
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:48,120
I'll be there day and night.

580
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:51,958
I see.

581
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:56,528
Doctor, there's nothing I won't do
to get this account.

582
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,808
I haven't signed
with Webster.

583
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:05,721
Oh, Dr. Tyler, I'm so happy.

584
00:44:06,129 --> 00:44:08,359
I know this is going to work out.
- Yes.

585
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:11,159
I think it has possibilities.

586
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:15,918
Shall we sit down and I'll tell you
my ideas? - No.

587
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:18,843
Not here. It's too dangerous.

588
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,041
All these experiments...

589
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:25,078
You mean there could be an explosion?
- Exactly.

590
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:28,083
If I'm not careful,
this whole thing could blow up.

591
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:30,880
V Day is coming.

592
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:34,565
I like it very much.

593
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:38,166
Thank you, Doctor.
- Got any more ideas?

594
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:41,242
Not yet. But I
could put the office to work.

595
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:42,649
Good!

596
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:48,318
As soon as you tell me what Vip is.
- That's a problem.

597
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,238
Problem?

598
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:54,398
Mr. Webster's whole strategy
is secrecy.

599
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:58,404
To get people talking about Vip
and wondering what it is.

600
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,687
I promised him
I wouldn't reveal it to anyone.

601
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:04,284
Until I decide to sign with him

602
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:08,841
or someone else, I feel
I must respect my promise.

603
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,398
Naturally.

604
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:14,399
And I admire your integrity.
- Miss Templeton,

605
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:18,882
I have a code,
and I told this to Webster too:

606
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:21,757
Veritas et probitas super omnia.

607
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:27,039
So that's where he stole it!
- Pardon?

608
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:33,365
I wonder if you know the man
you're dealing with. - Webster? - Yes.

609
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:39,444
I guess I don't. I've only seen him
a dozen or so times.

610
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:41,840
Well, what's your opinion?

611
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:45,800
I prefer to reserve judgment
till I see him sober.

612
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:49,525
Doesn't that tell you what he is?

613
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:54,682
Miss Templeton, as my uncle,
the missionary, used to say,

614
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,998
"If thou canst not speak
well of a man, speak not at all."

615
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:05,639
You make me feel ashamed.

616
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:07,926
Oh, no please, I...

617
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:12,088
I cannot presume to judge.

618
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:15,799
I am but a humble chemist.
- Oh no,

619
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:19,884
you're a genius,
and a great humanitarian.

620
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:23,042
And I want to
know you better.

621
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:27,603
Doctor,
there's so much I can learn from you.

622
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:33,446
As my father, the philosopher,
used to say,

623
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:38,124
"Knock at my door
and I shall take you in."

624
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:42,162
Dr. Tyler,

625
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:43,922
I'm knocking.

626
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:46,441
Miss Templeton,

627
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:48,726
I'm taking you in.

628
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:54,407
And it was there,
in the seclusion of my laboratory,

629
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:58,358
that the idea came
for this wonderful new product.

630
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:04,366
For a while I was determined
not to share it with the world.

631
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:09,559
Then I remembered the words
of my grandfather, the philanthropist:

632
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:14,642
"The joy of living
is the joy of giving."

633
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:19,721
Oh my!
What a magnificent family!

634
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:25,962
Missionary... philanthropist...
a philosopher... doctor...

635
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:27,768
Doctor?

636
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:29,169
You!

637
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,368
Oh, yes. Me.

638
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:37,081
When you said doctor, I thought
of my brother, the jungle surgeon.

639
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,445
He was the real doctor.

640
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,449
Was?

641
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:46,088
He went into the interior
to treat this tribe of sick natives.

642
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,606
Got them back on their feet,
restored their appetites,

643
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:53,001
discovered too late
that they were cannibals.

644
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:56,443
Oh, how awful!
- Yes.

645
00:47:57,769 --> 00:47:59,919
His last words were:

646
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,320
"Better me than Schweitzer."

647
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:08,565
You mean they have advertising
in Nebraska? - Yes.

648
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:12,246
Of course, it was a small agency,
in Omaha.

649
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:16,039
Somehow one of my ads came to the
attention of Mr. Bracket,

650
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:18,519
and he offered me a job in New York.

651
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,648
How do you like Madison Avenue?
- Oh, I love it.

652
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,927
I love the creative challenge.

653
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:28,401
It's the social challenge
that presents a bit of a problem.

654
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:32,918
You see, in my business,

655
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:36,682
I'm called upon to do
some entertaining.

656
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:39,523
That usually involves some drinking.

657
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:43,925
And that's a problem?
- Yes, I don't drink.

658
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,647
Neither do I.

659
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,007
It's not that I object.

660
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,479
It's just I can't tolerate alcohol.

661
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:56,326
One little glass of champagne and
I become completely irresponsible.

662
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,685
Is that a fact?
- Yes.

663
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:04,766
As a chemist, you must understand.
- I might be able to do something.

664
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,328
Would you try?
- You may depend on it.

665
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:15,528
I'd better be getting back.
Mr. Webster mentioned dinner...

666
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:18,318
Oh, don't have dinner with him!
- What?

667
00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:22,802
Let me take you to dinner.
There's so much I want to talk about.

668
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:25,279
I'll have more ideas for Vip.

669
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:27,281
Well, I...
- Please!

670
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:32,005
All right. - Good, I'll pick you up
at 7 at your lab. - Fine.

671
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:35,321
Oh, no. Not there. I'm moving.

672
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:39,278
Mr. Webster's
getting me a hotel suite.

673
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,648
Don't let him do that!

674
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:45,519
I mean, I'll get you a hotel suite.
- Miss Templeton...

675
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,397
But my agency will pay for it.

676
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:52,961
Please! - You don't even know if
I'll give you the Vip account.

677
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:56,961
I know you'll make
a fair and wise decision.

678
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:02,481
A woman senses
when a man can be trusted.

679
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:05,528
And you, Doctor, can be trusted.

680
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:14,088
Excuse me.

681
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:28,999
Rockefeller couldn't buy
a better suit than this.

682
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:32,207
$24.95 and
I throw in a pair of knickers.

683
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:34,209
No.

684
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:38,478
Haven't you got the kind
that was in style 5 or 6 years ago?

685
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:40,489
Have we!

686
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:45,679
Esther! Bring down the suit
we made for Prince Rainier's wedding.

687
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:49,684
Prince or no prince,
he didn't pick it up, he loses it.

688
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:53,965
One... two... three... together.

689
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:58,640
One... two... three... together.

690
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:02,166
Doctor. - One...
- I should have explained.

691
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:05,845
On "together", you bring
your feet together, not us.

692
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:09,764
Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's all right. You're doing well.

693
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:15,206
One... two... three... together.

694
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:18,521
Actually, we should
be together all the time.

695
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,397
This way
I can sense your next move.

696
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:24,840
How about that?

697
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,717
It's awfully nice of you
to teach me.

698
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:30,006
It's my pleasure.

699
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:33,640
I taught a Nobel
Prize winner. - Oh really? Who?

700
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:39,480
Oh, Dr. Tyler. You're very modest.

701
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:42,201
Oh, well...

702
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:46,679
I never think of myself
as a Nobel Prize winner.

703
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:51,844
It's my cousin Maurice who should
have it. He will, if he gets back.

704
00:51:52,249 --> 00:51:53,921
Gets back?
- Yes.

705
00:51:56,529 --> 00:52:00,283
Will you swear never to repeat
what I tell you? - I swear.

706
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:05,886
Central intelligence refers to
my cousin as the "human satellite".

707
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:08,963
You mean...
- Yes.

708
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:12,520
He was launched from
Cape Canaveral 4 days ago.

709
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,319
Every 97 minutes,
Maurice passes over this club.

710
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:23,800
Now you can understand why
I don't like to talk about myself.

711
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:35,561
I'm having a wonderful time.
- Good.

712
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,960
I really hate to leave.

713
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:40,087
Where are you going?

714
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:44,368
I have a meeting with Mr. Webster.
- Oh, Doctor, why?

715
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,044
Well, I...
- Please, sit down.

716
00:52:48,729 --> 00:52:50,799
I'm not even thinking business,

717
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,928
but I hate to see you
associate with someone like Webster.

718
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:58,166
You're so cultured, so refined,

719
00:52:58,569 --> 00:53:00,207
so innoc...

720
00:53:01,769 --> 00:53:03,919
You're so nice.
- No.

721
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:06,285
Say it: Innocent.

722
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:08,567
That's what I am.

723
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,963
You're a gentleman.
- I'm dull.

724
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,802
One phase of my education
is completely lacking.

725
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:18,359
But Mr. Webster can teach me.

726
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,727
Oh, Doctor. You've missed nothing.

727
00:53:22,129 --> 00:53:25,883
He had a long talk with me.
I've missed it.

728
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:31,208
There's nothing worthwhile
you can learn from Webster.

729
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:36,400
I find him very intriguing,
in a man-to-man sort of way.

730
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:41,448
Anyway, I've never seen
the places he wants to show me.

731
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:47,886
What places?
- Well, I'm kinda embarrassed...

732
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:52,679
Doctor, you know you can talk to me.
Where's he taking you?

733
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:57,598
Well, it's kind of a nightclub...

734
00:53:58,009 --> 00:54:00,443
They have these girls...

735
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:03,326
They remove their...

736
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,047
They strip!

737
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:10,648
Say, I think
that's the word he used!

738
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,480
He said I'd enjoy it.

739
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:18,605
Do you think
you'd enjoy watching a girl undress?

740
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:22,763
I don't know.
But I'm willing to give it a try.

741
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:29,809
All right.

742
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:34,403
If you want a burlesque,
you don't need Mr. Webster.

743
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:38,119
I'll take you.
- You? - Me.

744
00:54:39,129 --> 00:54:41,085
Oh, waiter. Cheque, please.

745
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:45,923
Hey, Charlie, isn't that him?

746
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:49,361
I think it is.

747
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:52,159
Keep the change.
- Thank you.

748
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:58,569
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a suite at the Royal Plaza.

749
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:04,438
It just doesn't seem right,
a man letting a woman pay.

750
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:08,046
Well, you're not exactly
an ordinary man.

751
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:13,327
It's him.

752
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:16,562
I wonder why
he grew the beard?

753
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:19,119
When has he got time to shave?

754
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:45,607
Remarkable muscle control!

755
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,281
Remarkable.

756
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:55,249
Say,

757
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,557
how do you suppose she...
- I really wouldn't know.

758
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:05,720
Doctor, would you please stop?

759
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,847
I'm sorry.

760
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:13,641
And I'm sorry we went
to that place. - Are you? - Yes.

761
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:18,287
From now on, I'll leave
that education to Mr. Webster.

762
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:21,647
You mean,
you found that educational?

763
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,404
We never studied anything like that.

764
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:31,047
I only saw girls in the lab, and they
had on those long white coats.

765
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:36,683
I had no idea what was
going on under those coats!

766
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:40,047
Doctor, do you mind
if we change the subject?

767
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:42,440
No.
- Thank you.

768
00:56:45,129 --> 00:56:47,324
What would you like to talk about?

769
00:56:47,729 --> 00:56:49,879
Anything but Jerry Webster.

770
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:51,563
All right.

771
00:56:57,129 --> 00:57:00,883
You hate this suit, don't you?
- Oh no, no.

772
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,641
It's very colorful.

773
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:08,039
I'm afraid
it's the only new suit I have.

774
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:11,927
But tomorrow I'm getting
a new wardrobe from Mist...

775
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,397
Oh, I forgot.
You don't wanna talk about him.

776
00:57:16,409 --> 00:57:19,526
Webster's buying you a new
wardrobe? - He insisted.

777
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:22,489
Doctor, let me buy it.
- Oh, I couldn't.

778
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:25,608
But I've told you,
my agency is paying for it.

779
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:30,287
They've given me carte blanche.
We'll go first thing in the morning.

780
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:34,164
And, uh, Linus?

781
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:37,409
Yes?

782
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,359
How long have you had that beard?

783
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:44,647
Don't you like it?
- Yes, I do.

784
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,358
It's very impressive.

785
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:50,920
Makes you look so distinguished,
so intellectual.

786
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:54,366
So handsome. It's magnificent.

787
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,203
You'd like me to get rid of it.
- Would you?

788
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:05,209
Say!

789
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:09,922
Your husband's a doll without
the beard! - Yes!

790
00:58:12,129 --> 00:58:14,518
I mean, he's not my husband.

791
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:26,478
I don't like it.
Maybe she'll go back to the lab.

792
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:30,928
Maybe she'll find out you're not
Tyler, that there's no Vip.

793
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:33,968
Maybe the world will end.
- Do you think?

794
00:58:35,129 --> 00:58:38,599
Relax. I'm gonna keep
Miss Templeton busy day and night.

795
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:43,241
People want Vip. We haven't got it!
- We'll get it!

796
00:58:49,689 --> 00:58:53,045
One of the most
brilliant chemists is working on it.

797
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:55,644
He may even have it now.

798
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:04,518
Dr. Tyler!
- Over here, my boy.

799
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:09,442
What exploded?
- Vip!

800
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:15,480
I know I said it could be toothpaste,
but isn't this the hard way?

801
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,357
It's not as mundane as toothpaste.

802
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:23,324
I seem to have made a mistake.
It all looked so simple.

803
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:29,167
You know yet what Vip is gonna be?
- Vip will be the miracle product.

804
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:32,845
It'll bring relief to the suffering,
joy to the depressed,

805
00:59:33,249 --> 00:59:37,208
inspiration to the artistic and peace
to the world, all for only 10 cents.

806
00:59:37,609 --> 00:59:40,362
Fabulous. It is a miracle product.

807
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:43,522
How soon will you have it?
- The product I have.

808
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:48,844
There are still bugs in the miracle.
- Keep at it. It'll make you immortal.

809
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:53,800
Boss. I brought the mail.
- I'll be right there, Milly.

810
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:58,600
How's the hermit?
- Who? - The mad chemist.

811
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,048
Oh, Linus? He's fine.

812
01:00:03,449 --> 01:00:04,649
Linus!

813
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:08,240
We're spending the day together,
playing golf.

814
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:11,840
Hallelujah!
Today, you are a woman.

815
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,967
Think he'll like it?

816
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:18,361
If he doesn't,
he's taking the wrong chemicals.

817
01:01:39,169 --> 01:01:41,046
That was fun!

818
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:49,840
You did amazingly well for only
one lesson. - Thank you.

819
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,886
I'm sorry
I made you drive so far out.

820
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:57,679
Such a lonely stretch of beach.
- That's all right.

821
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:01,685
Really, you shouldn't be embarrassed.
- Well, I...

822
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:05,081
You look wonderful without your
clothes. - So do you.

823
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:09,480
I meant...
- So did I.

824
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:14,127
Carol, I...
- Yes?

825
01:02:15,609 --> 01:02:17,759
There's something I'd like to ask.

826
01:02:18,889 --> 01:02:20,163
Go ahead.

827
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,400
I'm afraid you might misunderstand.

828
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:26,289
No. Ask it.

829
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:32,606
Do you have any more ideas for Vip?

830
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:35,769
What?

831
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:39,329
I hate to ask it,

832
01:02:39,729 --> 01:02:42,562
but after what Mr. Webster said...

833
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,766
What did he say?

834
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:49,765
When I mentioned your idea, he said
it was the last one you'd have.

835
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:53,718
What? - He said you were
strictly a one-idea person.

836
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:58,008
If there's anyone on Madison Avenue
who's a one-idea person, it's him.

837
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:01,242
His whole career's been
built on one idea: Sex.

838
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:08,522
Funny. You claim he's
oversexed and he claims you're...

839
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:12,601
I'm what?

840
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:15,361
I'd rather not tell you.

841
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:19,523
Well, I'm not undersexed!
- I'm sure you're not.

842
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:28,085
It's true, I haven't come up
with any new thoughts.

843
01:03:28,489 --> 01:03:29,489
But...

844
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:33,048
We've been having so much fun
in the last few days.

845
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:41,003
I promise, tomorrow morning
I'm gonna bring you great ideas.

846
01:03:41,409 --> 01:03:43,923
Good! That'll teach Webster.

847
01:03:46,609 --> 01:03:47,609
Now,

848
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:50,604
let's talk about something inspiring.

849
01:03:55,769 --> 01:03:58,158
I wonder where Maurice is.

850
01:03:58,569 --> 01:03:59,569
Who?

851
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:03,280
Your cousin. The human satellite.

852
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:04,883
Oh, him.

853
01:04:08,169 --> 01:04:10,637
Right now, he's over Russia.

854
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:16,722
Oh, brave, wonderful man.
- Yes.

855
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:22,683
I've often pondered his last words.
They were so cryptic.

856
01:04:23,089 --> 01:04:27,321
What did he say?
- He said, "Cousin Linus,

857
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:32,117
life is like outer space:
Explore it today,

858
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:37,045
for tomorrow you may not be able
to get it off the launching pad."

859
01:04:37,729 --> 01:04:39,765
I wonder what he meant.

860
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:44,202
He meant, enjoy life now,
before it's too late.

861
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:52,082
You know, there is something
I'd enjoy doing right now.

862
01:04:54,169 --> 01:04:55,727
But I don't know how.

863
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:58,963
Well, let's see...

864
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:04,005
I've taught you dancing,
golf,

865
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:05,922
how to swim...

866
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,320
What is it you'd like to do now?

867
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:12,642
I'd like to...

868
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:15,844
kiss you, but I...

869
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:20,717
That's even easier than dancing.

870
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:47,561
This may be your best subject.

871
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:50,889
Hi, Kelly.

872
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:54,326
Mr. Ramsey's been trying to reach
you. - Thank you.

873
01:05:54,729 --> 01:05:56,606
He's at your apartment.

874
01:05:57,009 --> 01:06:00,001
My apartment?
- He says it's very urgent.

875
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:07,084
Hello, Pete.
What are you doing in my apartment?

876
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:10,447
Waiting for you.
- How are things going with Tyler?

877
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:15,127
Things are lousy with Dr. Tyler.
Get over here right away.

878
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:19,568
Why don't you come to the office?
- I tried to. I've been thrown out.

879
01:06:19,969 --> 01:06:21,402
I'll be right there.

880
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:29,484
It's no use, I'm marked for life.

881
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:33,768
Have you tried alcohol?
- Yes. I had three martinis.

882
01:06:34,169 --> 01:06:36,888
I warned you
not to hire that madman!

883
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,245
Here, try this kind.

884
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:48,080
Thanks.
- No. Rub it on your face. Here.

885
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:51,921
He's not a chemist.
He's a frustrated munitions maker.

886
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:55,560
He'll never come up with Vip.
We'll be exposed.

887
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:58,802
This'll be the biggest scandal
that hit Madison Avenue.

888
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:01,404
The agency's through.

889
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,198
There's only one way out: Suicide.

890
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:09,399
All right. - We'll get Hadley to
commit suicide and pin it on him.

891
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:11,959
You may have trouble with that.

892
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:16,408
He wouldn't dare refuse.
His job depends on it.

893
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:19,607
We'll go see Tyler first thing.
I'll meet you there at nine.

894
01:07:20,009 --> 01:07:23,604
No, sir, you're not getting out
of my sight till we get Vip.

895
01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:28,207
Okay, you can stay here tonight.
You have the bed. I'll take the couch.

896
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:31,248
Is the alcohol working?
- Yes, it is.

897
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:34,447
My face isn't purple anymore?
- No.

898
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:38,889
Thanks.

899
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:54,639
V DAY IS COMING

900
01:07:55,889 --> 01:07:58,039
He stole it!

901
01:08:23,769 --> 01:08:25,441
I'm coming.

902
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:32,598
Linus!

903
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:35,000
What are you doing here?

904
01:08:35,809 --> 01:08:37,401
Where am I?

905
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:41,518
This is Jerry Webster's apartment.

906
01:08:42,449 --> 01:08:44,440
How did you get here?

907
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:50,007
Are you all right?

908
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:54,169
Try to think.
- I am.

909
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,478
Was he waiting for you at your hotel?
- Yes.

910
01:08:57,889 --> 01:09:01,279
How did he get you to come here?
- Well, I...

911
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:03,759
Let me see.

912
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:06,524
He probably
gave you something to drink.

913
01:09:06,929 --> 01:09:07,929
Yes.

914
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:11,039
You should have refused.
- Well, I...

915
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:16,963
I would have, but I was so dizzy
from that cigarette he gave me.

916
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:20,967
What kind of cigarette?
- I don't know.

917
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:23,360
It didn't have any printing.

918
01:09:24,849 --> 01:09:26,328
Oh, Linus!

919
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:30,839
Oh, that depraved monster!

920
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:36,487
It's time somebody...
- Wait!

921
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:40,199
You'd better let me look first.

922
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:48,839
You can't go in there.

923
01:09:49,249 --> 01:09:53,447
Why not?
- Because he's not alone.

924
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,006
You mean there's a...
- Two!

925
01:09:56,409 --> 01:09:58,639
Both famous actresses.

926
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:04,489
Hurry and dress.
We're getting out.

927
01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:07,528
They're waking up.
- Come on!

928
01:10:09,009 --> 01:10:10,522
All right...

929
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:13,680
We're getting out of here.

930
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:18,485
Where will I get dressed.
- At my place.

931
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:21,767
I'm not leaving you
with those actresses.

932
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:24,798
There goes Superman.

933
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:27,086
Makes you realize how old we are.

934
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,447
If he doesn't slow down,
he'll catch up with us.

935
01:10:36,889 --> 01:10:40,518
I just can't believe Webster
would steal someone else's idea.

936
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:45,921
You're so decent, it's hard for you
to think ill of anyone.

937
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:49,321
I guess I do
trust everybody.

938
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:52,482
I've put your things
in the maid's room.

939
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:54,038
Thank you.

940
01:10:57,489 --> 01:11:00,242
Where's your maid?
I don't have one. I just use it

941
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:02,082
as a guest room.

942
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:10,888
You know, I almost hate
to go back to the hotel.

943
01:11:11,289 --> 01:11:14,759
Webster's bound to come over,
and I don't feel like talking to him.

944
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:17,046
Well, don't go back.

945
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:20,919
Maybe I shouldn't. I'm kind of
disillusioned with Webster.

946
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:23,206
I should think so.

947
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:27,558
Maybe I shouldn't let him
handle the Vip account.

948
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:32,844
Whatever you think, Linus.

949
01:11:34,849 --> 01:11:37,238
It's your decision.

950
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:42,404
If only I had a quiet place where
I could think about this overnight.

951
01:11:43,369 --> 01:11:46,122
Some place where
Webster couldn't find me.

952
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,646
Linus?
- Yes?

953
01:11:53,049 --> 01:11:55,279
I know a place.

954
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:58,605
Really? Where?

955
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:01,125
Right here, in that guest room.

956
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:08,927
In your apartment? Alone with you?

957
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:11,329
All night?

958
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:17,124
It's like a separate apartment,
with a lock and its own entrance.

959
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:20,521
I don't know.
- Oh, Linus.

960
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:23,048
We're adults.
- Yes, but...

961
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:26,089
Look at it calmy and sensibly.

962
01:12:26,489 --> 01:12:29,606
You won't be disturbed here.
- Right.

963
01:12:30,009 --> 01:12:33,922
You can concentrate
on what you want to do. - True.

964
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:39,084
Well then. For what you have
in mind, isn't this the best place?

965
01:12:40,209 --> 01:12:42,359
I guess maybe it is.

966
01:12:49,849 --> 01:12:54,604
I don't care how you do it, or what it
is, we must have Vip tomorrow.

967
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:57,921
What I'm working on
is highly volatile.

968
01:12:58,329 --> 01:13:02,208
What I'm working on
is highly volatile too.

969
01:13:02,609 --> 01:13:04,565
That only gives me tonight.

970
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:08,041
Believe me, Doc,
I'm in the same boat.

971
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:21,679
Hello? Mr. Bracket.

972
01:13:22,089 --> 01:13:27,607
I'm here with Mr. Gaines. I'm filling
him in on Vip. How does it look?

973
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:29,806
Marvelous!

974
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:33,639
Dr. Tyler's having dinner here.

975
01:13:34,049 --> 01:13:37,962
Fine. We'll expect good news
in the morning. Goodnight.

976
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:41,964
Looks pretty good.
Dr. Tyler's having dinner with her.

977
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:44,166
Tyler, in a woman's apartment?

978
01:13:44,569 --> 01:13:50,360
Why not? Miss Templeton's attractive.
- I know Tyler. He's a woman-hater.

979
01:13:50,769 --> 01:13:55,604
Maybe he used to be. But Jenkins
saw them dancing the other night.

980
01:13:56,009 --> 01:13:58,000
Linus Tyler, out dancing?

981
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:02,203
Something's wrong. Come on.
- Where to?

982
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,839
Greenwich Village, to see Tyler.

983
01:14:05,249 --> 01:14:08,047
More coffee?
- No, thank you.

984
01:14:10,089 --> 01:14:11,442
You know...

985
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:18,320
I have a small bottle of champagne
someone gave me. And...

986
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:21,368
I debated whether
to open it tonight.

987
01:14:23,369 --> 01:14:26,918
But knowing how susceptible we...
- You were right.

988
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:31,844
In view of the situation,

989
01:14:32,849 --> 01:14:35,522
being here alone,

990
01:14:36,929 --> 01:14:39,921
I think we should be especially...
- Definitely.

991
01:14:43,249 --> 01:14:45,365
I'll help you with the dishes.

992
01:14:45,769 --> 01:14:47,964
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.

993
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:50,400
It's a woman's job.

994
01:14:50,809 --> 01:14:53,448
Well...
- Make yourself comfortable.

995
01:14:56,089 --> 01:14:58,444
It's ten thirty.
I'd better be getting to bed.

996
01:15:03,009 --> 01:15:05,204
Thank you for a delightful evening.

997
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:08,328
You're a wonderful cook,
charming company,

998
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:12,563
and some day, you'll make
some man a very fine wife.

999
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:15,242
Thank you, Linus.

1000
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:19,685
Some day, you'll make
some lucky woman a fine husband.

1001
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:22,440
That's kind of you.

1002
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:27,167
I'm afraid I could never get
married. Goodnight.

1003
01:15:30,209 --> 01:15:31,209
Wait!

1004
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:35,760
Why can't you get married?

1005
01:15:37,169 --> 01:15:40,525
It's the sort of thing a man
doesn't discuss with a woman.

1006
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:42,521
Oh, Linus.

1007
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:44,928
What is it?

1008
01:15:45,809 --> 01:15:48,642
Carol, I'm going to say something
that'll shock you.

1009
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:52,246
Do you know who I wish I were?
Jerry Webster!

1010
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:54,645
Oh no!
- Yes! - Why?

1011
01:15:55,049 --> 01:15:57,961
Because he's everything I'm not.

1012
01:15:58,369 --> 01:16:03,443
He's a man of the world.
He's smooth, confident, experienced.

1013
01:16:03,849 --> 01:16:05,168
He's a real man.

1014
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,764
You're the real man!
- Am I? - Yes.

1015
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:13,769
Look at me. Here I am,
alone with a beautiful girl.

1016
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:17,047
It's ten thirty,
and for me the evening is over.

1017
01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:20,521
Oh, Linus!
- Do you know what Webster would do?

1018
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:24,367
In two minutes,
he'd maneuver you into that bedroom!

1019
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:26,568
Oh, I'm sorry.

1020
01:16:27,169 --> 01:16:31,606
I didn't know what I was saying.
I didn't mean it.

1021
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:35,365
I know you didn't.
- But I feel so insecure.

1022
01:16:35,769 --> 01:16:38,283
Oh, Linus, stop torturing yourself.

1023
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:43,007
Now you know
why I'm afraid to get married.

1024
01:16:43,409 --> 01:16:45,206
I'm afraid,

1025
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:47,327
afraid I'll be a failure.

1026
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:51,199
But you won't.
I know.

1027
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:54,245
A woman knows these things.

1028
01:16:54,809 --> 01:16:59,166
Don't lie to me, please. I'd rather
have your scorn than pity.

1029
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:04,158
Linus, listen to me:

1030
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:06,878
It isn't pity,
and I didn't lie.

1031
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:12,488
You kissed me and I was thrilled.
- A kiss. What does that prove?

1032
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:16,799
If you can light a stove,
it still doesn't make you a cook.

1033
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:19,803
Listen to me. Look at me.

1034
01:17:20,209 --> 01:17:22,677
I can't. I'm too ashamed.

1035
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,449
Forget me, Carol.
You deserve a man,

1036
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:29,761
not a mass
of neurotic doubts.

1037
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:33,806
Oh, Linus,
you mustn't have these doubts.

1038
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:37,963
You're tearing yourself apart.
You're a fine, brilliant man.

1039
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:40,485
Sure. Brilliant chemist!

1040
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,368
Phi Beta Kappa!

1041
01:17:42,769 --> 01:17:44,919
Nobel Prize Winner!

1042
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:49,322
I'd trade all of my knowledge
to know how to make a woman love me.

1043
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:52,844
You can.
- No.

1044
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:55,483
That's not true.

1045
01:17:57,329 --> 01:18:02,767
You're a kind, sensitive person.
- But not the man a woman could love.

1046
01:18:03,169 --> 01:18:06,798
Of course you are.
- But I don't know.

1047
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:11,005
Linus, don't do this to yourself!

1048
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:13,764
Any woman would love you.

1049
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:19,048
If only
I could be sure of that.

1050
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,648
Wait here.

1051
01:18:57,249 --> 01:19:01,288
Shall I resist my heart?

1052
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:08,917
Shall I deny it's splendor?

1053
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:16,129
Shall I insist we part?

1054
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:21,489
Should I surrender?

1055
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:29,048
Should I be fire or ice?

1056
01:19:30,529 --> 01:19:35,929
Should I be firm or tender?

1057
01:19:39,169 --> 01:19:42,769
Should I be bad...

1058
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:45,649
or nice?

1059
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:51,358
Should I surrender?

1060
01:19:52,449 --> 01:19:57,125
His pleading words so tenderly

1061
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,689
entreat me.

1062
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:06,328
Is this the night

1063
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:14,569
that love finally defeats me?

1064
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:22,801
Should I avoid his touch?

1065
01:20:23,809 --> 01:20:29,409
Should I be a shy pretender?

1066
01:20:32,649 --> 01:20:35,449
Should I admit

1067
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:43,649
I'd much rather surrender?

1068
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:29,649
Yes?

1069
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:34,127
Miss Templeton, I don't usually
discharge employees on the phone.

1070
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:36,963
But in your case,
I'm making an exception.

1071
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:40,042
I just left Dr. Tyler,
and he never heard of you!

1072
01:21:40,689 --> 01:21:41,689
What?

1073
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:46,728
But that's impossible!
He's here right now.

1074
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:50,439
I don't know who you're
entertaining, but it's not Tyler.

1075
01:22:54,049 --> 01:22:55,249
Carol?

1076
01:22:57,729 --> 01:22:59,208
Yes, darling?

1077
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,247
Take my hand.

1078
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:10,399
I'm not afraid anymore.

1079
01:23:11,409 --> 01:23:12,762
Oh, that's good.

1080
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:14,848
What are you going to do?

1081
01:23:17,329 --> 01:23:19,285
I'm going to give you confidence.

1082
01:23:21,409 --> 01:23:22,409
Be gentle!

1083
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,840
Of course, darling.

1084
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:37,243
Remember that lonely stretch of beach
where we first kissed?

1085
01:23:40,009 --> 01:23:43,206
Let's go back there.
- Now?

1086
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:44,609
Yes.

1087
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:48,478
To recapture the magic
of that moment.

1088
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:50,800
But I feel pretty magic here.

1089
01:23:51,209 --> 01:23:52,961
There's a full moon.

1090
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:55,880
We'll have a midnight swim.

1091
01:23:57,009 --> 01:23:59,000
But it's thirty miles.

1092
01:24:00,129 --> 01:24:03,201
And I don't have my bathing suit.

1093
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:09,247
Oh, Linus.

1094
01:24:10,569 --> 01:24:13,447
My sweet, innocent darling.

1095
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:18,446
We don't need bathing suits.

1096
01:24:26,849 --> 01:24:28,282
Trust me,

1097
01:24:29,449 --> 01:24:33,522
my precious.
- Oh, I do. I do.

1098
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:42,605
I'm terribly embarrassed.
- No need to be, darling.

1099
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:46,885
After you get into the water,
I'll join you.

1100
01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:48,289
Okay.

1101
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:54,726
Well, that's it.
Now it's your turn.

1102
01:24:55,129 --> 01:24:56,129
Yes.

1103
01:24:57,289 --> 01:24:59,041
Now it's my turn.

1104
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:02,165
Goodnight, Mr. Webster!

1105
01:25:04,129 --> 01:25:06,438
Hey, wait! Come back!

1106
01:25:07,049 --> 01:25:10,041
I'm losing
my confidence again!

1107
01:25:21,609 --> 01:25:23,679
I've picked up a few hitchhikers,

1108
01:25:24,089 --> 01:25:29,083
but you were a weird sight,
running along in seaweed shorts!

1109
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:40,447
I'll have your coat back
in a minute.

1110
01:25:55,929 --> 01:25:57,362
Hey, Fred!

1111
01:25:58,729 --> 01:25:59,729
Look!

1112
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:19,805
That's the last guy
I would have figured.

1113
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:23,403
There'll be no slip-up this time,
Mr. Northcross.

1114
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:26,243
You subpoena Jerry Webster,

1115
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:30,562
and I'll present enough evidence
to put him behind bars.

1116
01:26:30,969 --> 01:26:34,518
They've been advertising
a product that doesn't exist.

1117
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:35,929
Yes!

1118
01:26:36,929 --> 01:26:40,239
I've already spoken to the
District Attorney. He'll be there.

1119
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:45,048
No, Mr. Northcross,
I'm not trying to stall for time.

1120
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:49,920
It just happens that
11 o'clock is when I donate blood.

1121
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:53,799
They need it.
It's a very rare type.

1122
01:26:55,289 --> 01:26:57,849
Eleven o'clock. I'll be there.

1123
01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:03,165
Did Hadley find Tyler?
- Not yet.

1124
01:27:03,569 --> 01:27:07,357
That Templeton is a mean woman.
- Lay off her, Kelly.

1125
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:10,758
Congratulate me, boy.
I've saved the day!

1126
01:27:11,169 --> 01:27:13,683
My lawyers
have come up with a document

1127
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:16,842
that will hold up in any court.
- Great! What is it?

1128
01:27:17,249 --> 01:27:20,127
A full confession.
Sign it.

1129
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:22,804
Are you kidding?
I could go to jail for 5 years.

1130
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:26,884
No, we make a deal with the judge.
Two years. Sign.

1131
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:29,245
Forget it.
- Two years!

1132
01:27:29,649 --> 01:27:34,643
It's like being drafted.
Greetings from the president. Sign.

1133
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:39,558
I couldn't find Tyler anywhere.
The guy has disappeared.

1134
01:27:39,969 --> 01:27:41,448
That tears it.

1135
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:43,204
Hadley.

1136
01:27:45,729 --> 01:27:46,923
Step over to the window.

1137
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:51,958
Mr. Ramsey,
I told you, I am not going to jump!

1138
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:55,008
You don't have to. I'll trip you.

1139
01:27:55,409 --> 01:27:57,798
Your wife'll be loaded,
kids'll go to college.

1140
01:27:58,209 --> 01:28:00,643
Right? Come on, boy, run!

1141
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:05,535
Knock it off. - You won't sign,
you won't jump. What traitors!

1142
01:28:05,635 --> 01:28:07,088
Dr. Tyler's here.

1143
01:28:08,369 --> 01:28:10,325
Doctor, where've you been?

1144
01:28:10,729 --> 01:28:14,199
In the subway.
Couldn't change a thousand dollar bill.

1145
01:28:15,369 --> 01:28:17,405
Gentlemen, I give you Vip!

1146
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:20,688
That is Vip?
- They look like mints.

1147
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:22,363
Don't they though?

1148
01:28:22,769 --> 01:28:27,206
$100,000 for advertising,
and what does he give us? Candy!

1149
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:31,158
I don't care if they're matzah balls.
I've got something for the ad council.

1150
01:28:31,929 --> 01:28:34,318
Hadley, let's have wrappers made.

1151
01:28:35,169 --> 01:28:37,000
Nobel Prize Winner, huh?

1152
01:28:37,409 --> 01:28:39,559
I could have hired Fanny Farmer.

1153
01:28:39,969 --> 01:28:42,164
At ten cents a piece,
you'll make millions.

1154
01:28:42,569 --> 01:28:44,400
Ten cents for one of these?

1155
01:28:45,409 --> 01:28:48,242
Try it.
- I've tasted candy before.

1156
01:28:48,649 --> 01:28:50,958
Not like these. Try it.

1157
01:28:56,409 --> 01:28:57,888
Have the rest of it.

1158
01:29:04,769 --> 01:29:08,762
I think you'd better sit down,
there should be a reaction.

1159
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:12,163
I made it emphatic
to Webster he be here at 11.

1160
01:29:13,049 --> 01:29:15,643
Hadley! Hold that elevator!

1161
01:29:18,889 --> 01:29:20,845
Vippooooo!

1162
01:29:22,249 --> 01:29:25,764
I think I'll try a red one.
- I think you've had enough.

1163
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:29,321
Don't worry,
I can hold my candy.

1164
01:29:29,729 --> 01:29:31,287
Know something?

1165
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:33,247
I'll tell you,

1166
01:29:34,449 --> 01:29:37,168
you've come up with a great mint.
- Mint?

1167
01:29:37,569 --> 01:29:39,560
Mint, you say?

1168
01:29:41,689 --> 01:29:45,602
This priceless pastille
you carelessly refer to as a mint,

1169
01:29:46,009 --> 01:29:49,126
is in reality
a triumph of advanced biochemistry.

1170
01:29:49,529 --> 01:29:53,158
Looks like candy.
Tastes like candy.

1171
01:29:53,969 --> 01:29:56,927
But it enters
the blood stream as pure alcohol.

1172
01:29:57,369 --> 01:30:01,442
Each one is the equivalent
of a triple martini.

1173
01:30:02,489 --> 01:30:04,957
Here's to you, Doc. Bottoms up!

1174
01:30:05,369 --> 01:30:08,600
I've given this country
what it has long needed:

1175
01:30:09,009 --> 01:30:11,398
A good ten cent drunk.

1176
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:15,401
I told you he wouldn't show up.

1177
01:30:15,809 --> 01:30:17,447
The D.A. Should take over.

1178
01:30:17,849 --> 01:30:20,602
It seems in order
to issue a warrant for his arrest.

1179
01:30:21,009 --> 01:30:23,000
And if he resists, gun him down!

1180
01:30:23,409 --> 01:30:25,877
Good morning.
I'm sorry to be late,

1181
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:28,686
but I stopped to pick up Vip.

1182
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:31,557
You mean there is such a product?

1183
01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:34,399
Would I advertise it if there weren't?

1184
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:37,118
That would be dishonest.

1185
01:30:38,209 --> 01:30:43,442
Gentlemem, I give you Vip.
A confection for the entire family.

1186
01:30:48,929 --> 01:30:53,445
This is nothing but a mint!
- I never said it was anything more.

1187
01:30:54,609 --> 01:30:55,883
Hmm, it's quite tasty.

1188
01:30:56,889 --> 01:30:59,449
Really?
- May I have another one?

1189
01:30:59,849 --> 01:31:01,999
Sure, Mr. Williams, help yourself.

1190
01:31:06,889 --> 01:31:08,322
Help yourselves.

1191
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,720
Unusually refreshing.

1192
01:31:13,289 --> 01:31:16,122
Try a green one.
- How many colors are there? - 6.

1193
01:31:16,529 --> 01:31:19,601
Let's all have one of each.

1194
01:31:30,449 --> 01:31:32,201
Dr. Melnick?
- What happened?

1195
01:31:32,609 --> 01:31:36,079
He just suddenly went wild.
- He kicked this picture of his dad.

1196
01:31:36,489 --> 01:31:39,879
He tried to tear my clothes off!
- Mine too!

1197
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:43,199
Where is he?
- Joe, take it down.

1198
01:31:50,009 --> 01:31:51,601
What are you doing, Peter?

1199
01:31:52,009 --> 01:31:54,398
I'm king of the elevator!

1200
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,959
V Day is Here

1201
01:32:48,089 --> 01:32:49,158
Marriage Certificate

1202
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:51,127
Married?

1203
01:32:51,529 --> 01:32:52,529
Me?

1204
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:57,409
Car...

1205
01:33:12,209 --> 01:33:13,642
Miss Templeton?

1206
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:16,719
Miss Templeton, wake up.

1207
01:33:20,089 --> 01:33:21,204
Milly.

1208
01:33:22,849 --> 01:33:25,488
I had the most wonderful dream.

1209
01:33:29,089 --> 01:33:30,886
Dr. Tyler and I...

1210
01:33:33,969 --> 01:33:36,119
I know what you're thinking,
but just calm down.

1211
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:39,885
We're in a motel in Maryland,
but it's all right.

1212
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:43,759
We're legally married.
You're Mrs. Jerry Webster.

1213
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:47,044
Now stop that!
You're my wife!

1214
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:50,088
Some girls
just aren't ready for marriage.

1215
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:51,689
Here.

1216
01:33:52,529 --> 01:33:57,523
Look. I don't know how it happened,
but I did the decent thing.

1217
01:34:00,769 --> 01:34:02,885
Oh, I'm your wife!

1218
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,800
This is horrible!

1219
01:34:06,209 --> 01:34:07,847
I'm ruined!

1220
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,684
You're not ruined!
I married you.

1221
01:34:11,089 --> 01:34:13,284
You'll go to jail for this.
- Carol...

1222
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:15,680
Don't you touch me!

1223
01:34:16,769 --> 01:34:18,043
Will you listen to reason?

1224
01:34:18,449 --> 01:34:20,360
You give me back my clothes!

1225
01:34:20,769 --> 01:34:24,967
Poor lad! It's not likely
to be a long honeymoon.

1226
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:29,920
I know you hate me, but you must
love me too. You married me.

1227
01:34:30,329 --> 01:34:33,685
You got me drunk!
- Maybe I did.

1228
01:34:34,089 --> 01:34:37,718
I know it's a shock
to wake up and find yourself married,

1229
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:40,882
but this is the first time
it's happened to me too.

1230
01:34:41,289 --> 01:34:45,248
And you know something?
Cold sober, even with a hangover,

1231
01:34:45,649 --> 01:34:47,048
I kinda like it.

1232
01:34:47,449 --> 01:34:49,121
Mrs. Jerry Webster.

1233
01:34:49,769 --> 01:34:52,647
Don't you ever call me that again.

1234
01:34:53,049 --> 01:34:55,847
Plenty of girls
would like to be Mrs. Jerry Webster.

1235
01:34:56,249 --> 01:35:01,277
I'm sure they have a right.
- Okay, so I've sown a few wild oats.

1236
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:05,728
A few?
You can qualify for a farm loan!

1237
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:09,605
Honey, you're starting
off our marriage with a fight.

1238
01:35:10,009 --> 01:35:13,968
Oh no, I'm not.
I'm starting it with an annulment!

1239
01:35:15,129 --> 01:35:18,087
Carol, don't be so hasty.
Let's talk this over.

1240
01:35:18,489 --> 01:35:21,003
You listen. No alcoholic beverage,

1241
01:35:21,409 --> 01:35:27,041
no drug, no torture could induce me
to stay married to you!

1242
01:35:27,449 --> 01:35:29,485
Let's discuss this!

1243
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:37,645
Where can I get this annulled?

1244
01:35:38,049 --> 01:35:41,121
Darling,
it's only natural to be frightened.

1245
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:45,522
Like olives, dear,
you acquire a taste for it.

1246
01:35:47,249 --> 01:35:52,039
Get me New York City,
Plaza 89970. I'll hold.

1247
01:35:59,729 --> 01:36:02,289
Hello, Pete? This is Jerry.

1248
01:36:02,689 --> 01:36:04,805
I'm in Maryland,
but I don't know how.

1249
01:36:05,449 --> 01:36:07,440
I'll tell you.

1250
01:36:07,849 --> 01:36:12,479
You ate some of those poison pellets
your Frankenstein friend

1251
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:15,005
Tyler came up with.

1252
01:36:15,409 --> 01:36:19,288
Candy nothing! That stuff
turns into pure alcohol.

1253
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:24,124
That explains it.
What about the ad council?

1254
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,884
They found Northcross

1255
01:36:27,289 --> 01:36:31,077
barricaded in the ladies' lounge
at Radio City Music Hall.

1256
01:36:32,489 --> 01:36:36,038
Williams was on stage,
dancing with the Rockettes.

1257
01:36:36,449 --> 01:36:40,488
And Magnussen just washed up
on the beach at Waikiki.

1258
01:36:40,889 --> 01:36:42,368
Yeah, he's alive.

1259
01:36:44,809 --> 01:36:46,800
Can't find the District Attorney.

1260
01:36:49,689 --> 01:36:51,680
Is he gray haired with a moustache?

1261
01:36:55,689 --> 01:36:59,045
He was best man at my wedding.

1262
01:37:00,769 --> 01:37:04,364
Relax, Pete.
I'm gonna sign the confession.

1263
01:37:04,769 --> 01:37:08,921
I'm taking the rap for everything.
- You're not taking the rap alone.

1264
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:11,445
I'll see that Hadley signs too.

1265
01:37:11,849 --> 01:37:14,409
That won't be necessary.
- Excuse me.

1266
01:37:14,809 --> 01:37:17,198
There are two men here to see you.

1267
01:37:17,609 --> 01:37:20,248
It's the FBI!
Send them in here.

1268
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:23,561
I don't want you to think
I'm abandoning you.

1269
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:28,485
The same lawyers who drew up
this document will break it.

1270
01:37:28,889 --> 01:37:32,120
I'll get you a fair trial
if I have to buy out the jury.

1271
01:37:32,529 --> 01:37:33,598
Thanks.

1272
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:35,763
Mr. Ramsey?

1273
01:37:36,169 --> 01:37:39,764
I'm Ramsey. But Jerry Webster
is responsible for Vip.

1274
01:37:40,169 --> 01:37:42,080
He invented it. He dreamed it up.

1275
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,844
Is that true?
- Yes.

1276
01:37:45,249 --> 01:37:48,525
It's all right here. - Don't say
a word till I get the lawyers.

1277
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:52,001
We don't need
lawyers here, Mr. Webster.

1278
01:37:53,009 --> 01:37:55,000
Now, what is your price?

1279
01:37:55,849 --> 01:37:58,238
Price?
- We represent the liquor industry.

1280
01:37:58,649 --> 01:38:01,288
How much did it take
to burn that formula?

1281
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:03,442
Well, I, uh...

1282
01:38:04,929 --> 01:38:09,445
You don't seem to realize
what you're asking me to do.

1283
01:38:09,849 --> 01:38:11,999
The government'll stop you anyway.

1284
01:38:12,409 --> 01:38:16,288
With that candy, we lose money.
Now, name your price.

1285
01:38:17,929 --> 01:38:19,726
Let's see.

1286
01:38:20,129 --> 01:38:26,125
The liquor industry spends 60 million
a year in advertising. - Right.

1287
01:38:26,529 --> 01:38:29,282
And we're prepared
to give you 20% of our billing.

1288
01:38:29,969 --> 01:38:32,767
You can open
your own agency with that.

1289
01:38:33,169 --> 01:38:35,364
25%.
- Agreed.

1290
01:38:35,769 --> 01:38:39,079
You're not going to give the account
to me. Give it to Mrs...

1291
01:38:39,489 --> 01:38:41,127
That is...

1292
01:38:41,529 --> 01:38:44,760
Miss Carol Templeton,
of Bracket, McGalpin & Gaines.

1293
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,199
If that's what you want.
- It is.

1294
01:38:49,369 --> 01:38:50,768
Shall we?

1295
01:38:57,729 --> 01:39:01,881
Our attorneys will draw up
an agreement. - Fine.

1296
01:39:02,289 --> 01:39:03,289
No.

1297
01:39:04,409 --> 01:39:08,482
Send it to San Francisco.
I'm moving to our West Coast office.

1298
01:39:08,889 --> 01:39:11,483
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

1299
01:39:11,889 --> 01:39:13,447
Thank you.

1300
01:39:17,369 --> 01:39:21,442
Are you taking Mr. Webster?
- No, he's going to San Francisco.

1301
01:39:21,849 --> 01:39:23,248
San Francisco?

1302
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:26,162
Alcatraz!

1303
01:39:29,489 --> 01:39:34,279
This one. This one I don't need.
Take all of these.

1304
01:39:36,209 --> 01:39:38,848
Oh, Pete. I'll be leaving tonight.

1305
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:44,842
We'll miss you, boy.
- I'm taking Kelly with me.

1306
01:39:46,729 --> 01:39:48,447
If anybody can do it, you can.

1307
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:57,398
Hello, Mr. Webster.

1308
01:39:57,809 --> 01:40:00,528
This is Milly,
Miss Templeton's secretary.

1309
01:40:01,529 --> 01:40:05,647
You know how you married that girl
9 months ago and she annulled it?

1310
01:40:06,049 --> 01:40:09,325
Well, it seems there was
something she couldn't annul.

1311
01:40:09,729 --> 01:40:14,723
I think every man has a right to know
when he's about to become a father.

1312
01:40:24,529 --> 01:40:28,238
Got the marriage license.
The judge'll waive the 3-day wait.

1313
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:31,038
I can marry you immediately.

1314
01:40:32,209 --> 01:40:35,804
The ring! I haven't got it!
- Here, you can use mine.

1315
01:40:37,809 --> 01:40:38,878
Yours?

1316
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:43,646
I've been carrying it for years.
I believe in being prepared.

1317
01:40:45,329 --> 01:40:48,560
Carol, please listen to me.
- I will not marry you.

1318
01:40:48,969 --> 01:40:52,245
Now go away, I'm busy.
- Darling, I love you.

1319
01:40:52,649 --> 01:40:55,959
You don't. You went to California
and forgot me.

1320
01:40:56,369 --> 01:41:00,885
Forgot you? I sent you hundreds
of letters, 1 every day for 8 months.

1321
01:41:01,289 --> 01:41:04,565
And the ninth month, when I
needed you most, not a word!

1322
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:08,928
I didn't know it was happening.
You sent back every letter, unopened.

1323
01:41:09,329 --> 01:41:13,163
If you loved me, you'd have
kept writing. - I do love you.

1324
01:41:13,569 --> 01:41:15,480
Please marry me!

1325
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:21,045
I'll think about it. I don't want
to rush into anything.

1326
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:25,283
You listen to me! You're
going to have my baby, my son...

1327
01:41:25,689 --> 01:41:30,319
It's my baby and I'll have
what I want: I decided on a girl.

1328
01:41:30,729 --> 01:41:34,802
Whatever makes you happy.
I love you both. Will you marry me?

1329
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:39,961
I always wanted a church wedding.

1330
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:42,800
The next baby.

1331
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:45,882
Please say yes!

1332
01:41:47,369 --> 01:41:49,369
Oh... Yes!

1333
01:41:49,929 --> 01:41:52,568
Judge?
- Join hands please.

1334
01:41:52,969 --> 01:41:56,120
We're gathered here
to unite this man and this woman...

1335
01:41:57,049 --> 01:42:00,280
...I trust it will
symbolize your union.

1336
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:04,204
By the powers vested
in me by the state of New York,

1337
01:42:04,609 --> 01:42:07,521
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1338
01:42:09,449 --> 01:42:12,998
Man!
That's what I call cutting it close!
