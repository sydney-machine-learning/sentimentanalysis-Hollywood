1
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:09,385
There he is.

2
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,057
There's the stallion. That's War Winds.

3
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:16,594
Beautiful.

4
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,261
That's my daughter riding him. Leslie.

5
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,674
Leslie is my daughter. She's riding him.

6
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:32,508
Doctor, that sure is a beautiful animal.

7
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,381
We'll get to the horses
first thing in the morning.

8
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,619
Now you'll come up to the house
and get ready for dinner.

9
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,545
You're from Nevada, Mr. Beckwith?

10
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:04,976
Texas, Mama.

11
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,985
You're from Texas, Mr. Beckwith?

12
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,920
Yes, ma'am, Texas. Benedict's the name.

13
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:14,424
You're here about the horses, aren't you?

14
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:15,482
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:20,826
I came to buy your stallion, War Winds,
if your daughter doesn't mind too much.

16
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:26,094
In all likelihood,
Leslie will be leaving us soon anyway.

17
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:32,972
David is with the embassy in Washington.
He's been called back to England.

18
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,836
Will she like it there, do you think?

19
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,747
She's going to marry him?

20
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:44,845
Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict
War Winds.

21
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,788
I can tell you all his bad points.

22
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:51,021
For one, he eats too much,
doesn't he, Papa?

23
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:55,427
You see, it's either War Winds or me.
Something has to go.

24
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:59,329
You know that horse is just too spirited
for any woman to ride.

25
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,968
I know your horse is going to miss you
and all this nice, green country, but...

26
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:07,867
I'll try to make him happy in Texas.

27
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:10,239
Isn't Texas green, Mr. Benedict?

28
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,980
No, ma'am, not altogether.

29
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,182
You must tell us about Texas,
Mr. Benedict.

30
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,182
It's not that easy.

31
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:23,853
It's different than any other state, I think.

32
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,392
At least that's what we think.
It's almost a different country.

33
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:34,798
From an Englishman's point of view,
its mere size takes your breath away.

34
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,900
Yes, it's big all right.

35
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:39,105
How large are your ranches?

36
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,401
Most every size. Large and small.

37
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:46,445
Mr. Benedict's Reata is
one of the largest of them all.

38
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,014
Oh, really?

39
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:51,320
And just how large is that?

40
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:53,545
It's one of the biggest.

41
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:57,624
How big is that?

42
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:03,458
There are one or two others as big,
I suppose, up where we come from...

43
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:07,229
and some larger ones
on the coastal plains.

44
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,937
Can't you be more specific?

45
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:15,100
What's the size of your place?
50,000? 20,000 acres?

46
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:25,315
Around a half million.
595,000 acres, to be exact.

47
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,186
I'd call that quite a parcel!

48
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,849
How many acres did you say,
Mr. Benedict?

49
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:35,624
He said 595,000 acres, Mama.

50
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,322
And you should see the greedy look
on your face.

51
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,400
Witness excused.

52
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,228
Won't you join us at the Hunt Ball?
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

53
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,638
No, thank you, Miss Leslie.

54
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:50,303
I'm afraid I wouldn't look good
in this outfit.

55
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,361
I like your country.

56
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,363
Why don't you stay a while
and really see something of it?

57
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,630
It's roundup time in my country.
Big spring roundup.

58
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:23,837
Your country?

59
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:25,605
Reata.

60
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:31,742
Your country, my country.
You make us sound so far apart.

61
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:43,955
Maybe you could come out and see it...

62
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:46,556
if you get a chance.

63
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,888
I'll be off real early in the morning, so...

64
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:16,284
goodbye.

65
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:18,125
I'm awfully glad you came.

66
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,065
I'm not going to say goodbye to you
in the moonlight.

67
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,130
It would just be too touching. Good night!

68
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,669
"Texas."

69
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:49,743
Are you in love with him?

70
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,585
Yes, I think so.

71
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:55,818
Will you do me a favor
and run along to bed?

72
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,129
- Leslie?
- Good night.

73
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,076
If you won't marry David Karfrey...

74
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,006
will you give him to me?

75
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes! Now, good night.

76
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:53,845
As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.

77
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,877
- $10,000 is a lot of money.
- It's a lot of horse.

78
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,922
Let's have some breakfast and get going.

79
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,038
- Why, Leslie!
- Good morning.

80
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,583
You don't look as if you'd been dancing
all night, Miss Leslie.

81
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,226
I came home at 10:45.

82
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,324
I read about Texas until 5:00 this morning.

83
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,126
Let the poor boy
eat his breakfast in peace.

84
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,068
It takes a heap of reading, Texas does.

85
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,034
We really stole Texas, didn't we?

86
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,740
I mean, away from Mexico.

87
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,210
You're catching me a bit early
to start joking.

88
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:09,320
But I'm not joking.
It's all right there in the history books.

89
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:13,518
Mr. Austin came down
with 300 families, it says.

90
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,961
The next thing you know,
they're claiming it from Mexico.

91
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,292
I never heard anything as ignorant
as some Eastern people...

92
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,359
Oh, please, Jordan.

93
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,531
I'm only speaking impersonally.
About history.

94
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,635
You all think
that the glory happened in the East...

95
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,009
with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill!

96
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,545
Do you know about San Jacinto?
Have you heard about the Alamo?

97
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,283
Why, certainly.

98
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,816
I read about them all last night.

99
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,759
I didn't mean to be impolite,
but it's so new to me.

100
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,125
I just mean, it's just all so new...

101
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,525
and so fascinating!

102
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:01,565
You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.
They feel very strongly about their state.

103
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,933
He shouldn't take it so hard.

104
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,603
Jordan, you would think
somebody had spoiled you terribly.

105
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:11,747
Your wife or somebody.

106
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:16,251
I haven't any wife. I live with my sister.

107
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,286
Why aren't you married?

108
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,860
First you attack a man's country,
and now you try to pry into his family life.

109
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:34,696
Thank you, Doctor.

110
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,399
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

111
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,101
- Good morning, Lacey.
- Good morning, Papa.

112
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,779
How are we doing?

113
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:49,751
We'll have to be getting along soon
if you're going to make your train.

114
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:56,386
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning, Nancy.

115
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,120
Good morning, dear.

116
00:14:58,195 --> 00:14:59,958
Good morning, Mr. Benedict.

117
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:02,463
Isn't this a beautiful morning?

118
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:17,169
Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished
his breakfast...

119
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:19,538
why don't you show him the stables?

120
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:24,510
We've just quarreled politely about Texas.
It's no use trying to pawn me off on him.

121
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,155
And anyway, Mother...

122
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:33,385
he's probably engaged to marry
the daughter of the adjoining ranch...

123
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,763
who, though beautiful,
is comparatively poor.

124
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:40,432
She only has 200,000 acres
and half a million cows.

125
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,905
Is she pretty?

126
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:50,472
We must hurry.

127
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:55,643
Mr. Benedict and I will have
to be leaving now.

128
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,293
Who, may I ask, is the lucky young lady
that you're going to marry...

129
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,536
with all those cows?

130
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:22,407
I'll get the car.

131
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:29,506
It's funny, ma'am.
My neighbor is a girl, Vashti Hake.

132
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:42,662
There was some talk of my marrying her,
but I'm not.

133
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,291
Come on, if you want to catch that train.

134
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,694
It all sounds so romantic!

135
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:33,710
Come along, David, you're for me.

136
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:27,824
What's that, a wolf?

137
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:29,526
No, honey.

138
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,430
It's just a little old coyote.

139
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:42,844
Don't you think you've done
enough sightseeing?

140
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:44,708
Tell me when we're in Texas.

141
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,477
That's Texas you've been looking at.

142
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:52,349
For the last eight hours.

143
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:59,562
I don't know how other brides feel
on their honeymoon...

144
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,928
but I'm having a lovely time.

145
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,661
We can't say it's been dull.

146
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,002
That is, so far anyway.

147
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,759
Wake up, honey. We're here, honey.

148
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,457
Where?

149
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:43,995
Hello.

150
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:45,597
Good morning.

151
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,805
Is that Texas?

152
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:56,441
It's Benedict. That's where we ship from.

153
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,153
These people never learn!

154
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,354
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

155
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:51,298
That means, "Welcome, the newlyweds."

156
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,640
Let's go, Leslie.

157
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:00,076
And what is your name?

158
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,384
That's a beautiful name.

159
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:09,986
Come on, it's 50 miles to coffee.

160
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,341
This is it, honey. This is your home.

161
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,477
But it's huge!

162
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,713
I thought it was a ranch house.

163
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:20,486
My old man built it to show the cotton
crowd we were just as high-powered.

164
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,590
It's enormous just for the two of us.

165
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:25,287
Luz lives here with me.

166
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:26,853
With us.

167
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:31,634
She's run the house since Ma passed on.
Some say she even runs the ranch!

168
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:42,711
Take it easy, Leslie.

169
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,278
What are your names?

170
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,422
What do you mean behave?

171
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,066
Here we don't make a fuss
over those people. You're a Texan now.

172
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:15,643
Is that a state of mind? I'm still myself.

173
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,514
You're my wife, honey. You're a Benedict.

174
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:24,721
I still have a mind of my own.
Elsewhere, being gracious is acceptable.

175
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,180
We're gracious, but...

176
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:37,062
Fine thing...

177
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:41,297
standing here quarreling
with rice still in our hair!

178
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,899
It's so nice and cool!

179
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,642
I thought somebody was hurt, maybe.

180
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,838
We didn't know you were there.

181
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,653
Well, home. We're here.

182
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:35,179
I've been looking for you for weeks.

183
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:38,251
We weren't expected to be back sooner,
were we?

184
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,754
With all the spring work to be done,
the roundup...

185
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,795
I didn't figure Bick would stay away.

186
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:51,567
If I miss a roundup every time I have
a honeymoon, I won't miss much, will I?

187
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,813
I thought I fired him off this place.

188
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:11,555
Where do you think you're going
with my automobile?

189
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:13,591
Just hold on.

190
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:17,959
Don't go taking off on me.
That old truck broke down again.

191
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:24,894
You want me going down the road?

192
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,497
That's exactly what I was going to do.

193
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,675
But she said,
"You stay on and do your work."

194
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:34,875
Next time I tell you to get, you get!

195
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:38,110
Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling
about something.

196
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:42,483
- <i>Madama</i> is the one who told me to stay.
- That's right.

197
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,313
With you away,
we needed all the help there was.

198
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:49,852
They're all scared to death of her.
You know that.

199
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,721
Everyone, except you and me.

200
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,266
You just tend to your work.

201
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,324
Tell me who is the boss around here...

202
00:25:57,303 --> 00:26:01,865
and I'll be glad to do anything you want.
Just tell me who's the boss.

203
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:06,345
This is Bick's new wife.

204
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,710
Leslie, this boy here is Jett Rink.

205
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:12,106
- Hello.
- He works for us.

206
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,888
You'd better get going, Jett,
and get that truck fixed.

207
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,337
Nobody is king in this country.

208
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:40,738
Nobody, no matter what they think.

209
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:47,080
I'm sorry, honey. Things go <i>loco</i> here
every time I'm away.

210
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:54,357
Remember the time of the big rodeo?

211
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:58,523
Old Kale Beebe blew in,
higher than a kite...

212
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:01,497
slept on the sofa in your office.

213
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:06,493
He must have had nightmares.
He cut the couch to ribbons with his spurs.

214
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,596
This here is Bick's room.

215
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:12,999
This down here is your room, honey.

216
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,369
Look...

217
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,112
We're married.

218
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:24,444
You know how that is.

219
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,214
We'll take the connecting rooms.

220
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:33,719
We'll make that into a sitting room
where we can sit and talk...

221
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:36,622
and the breeze can get at us.

222
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,578
Breakfast's ready.

223
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:34,053
You and Jordan
have had breakfast already?

224
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:38,115
We have our coffee and talk
every morning of our lives at 5:00.

225
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,587
Try and get things rounded up for the day.

226
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,127
I thought I was going riding with him
to the roundup.

227
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,033
It would've been too hot for you.
I told him so.

228
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,197
Bring it in here.

229
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,010
You gotta watch out for that sun.
It's rough.

230
00:28:58,379 --> 00:28:59,403
Sit down.

231
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:05,808
Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble
with a lot of Easterners.

232
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:10,715
Thank you.

233
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:14,994
I'm fine, Luz.

234
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,595
I'm a lot tougher perhaps
than you think I am.

235
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,625
Me...

236
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:28,998
I never had a sick day in my life.
Except when I got thrown and tromped on.

237
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:33,345
All you gotta do is take it easy.

238
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:35,813
This rich Texas air will fix you up.

239
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,617
Don't you worry none
about being lonesome.

240
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:44,389
I'll round up the neighbors.

241
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,482
You're going to meet some folks.

242
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,460
Yes, indeed.
You're going to meet some folks.

243
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:54,165
This is Mr. And Mrs. Bale Clinch.

244
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:57,597
Bick, it's about time. Howdy, ma'am.

245
00:29:57,771 --> 00:30:00,204
I'd like you to meet
my little wife, Adarene.

246
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,804
I'm mighty pleased to meet you.

247
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:06,276
This is Judge Whiteside.

248
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,542
How do you do, Mrs. Benedict?
We sure are proud to have you here.

249
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:12,675
Bick, congratulations.
Mighty happy for you, boy.

250
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:14,212
She sure is pretty.

251
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:15,651
I think so.

252
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:17,779
Here's Ula Japes.

253
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,585
Glad to meet you, ma'am.

254
00:30:19,658 --> 00:30:21,250
Good to see you, Bick.

255
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:23,192
This is Ms. Wharton.

256
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,423
Howdy, Leslie. Mighty happy to meet you.

257
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:27,692
Fernie Kling.

258
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,264
We're glad to have you with us.

259
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:32,934
You've really done well for yourself.

260
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:34,233
Thank you, Fernie.

261
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:43,812
Now you'll meet the neighbor
I told you about.

262
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:47,544
The one who lives 50 miles away
with all those cows?

263
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:51,816
Vashti, I'd like you to meet my wife.

264
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,582
Hello, Vashti. So nice to meet you.

265
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,791
Jordan told me so much about you.

266
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:03,123
Mighty glad to know you.

267
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:05,498
I'm awfully glad we're neighbors.

268
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,400
I hope we'll be real close friends.

269
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:21,846
My name is Mort Snythe.
They call me Pinky.

270
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,753
Come here.

271
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:31,624
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- We'll be seeing you.

272
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:15,496
- This will perk you up, Miss Leslie.
- Thank you.

273
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:19,764
I propose a toast to a daughter
of old Maryland...

274
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:24,436
now blooming into a citizen
of the Lone Star State. To the bride!

275
00:32:32,922 --> 00:32:34,081
Are you all right?

276
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:35,746
I'm fine, don't worry.

277
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:39,991
- There's more than one bride here today.
- How's that, Vashti?

278
00:32:41,196 --> 00:32:44,495
Mort Snythe and I were married yesterday
in Hermosa.

279
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:58,375
I'm gonna kiss him!

280
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:03,213
I guess that leaves only me.

281
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:08,415
Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows
you'd rather herd cattle than make love!

282
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:11,014
One thing you gotta say for cattle:

283
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:14,617
You put your brand on one of them,
you know where it's at!

284
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,434
Come and get it!

285
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:46,823
The best food you ever ate, honey.

286
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,255
This is real Mexican <i>barbacoa</i>.

287
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,963
That's where we get the word "barbecue."

288
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,635
What is that?

289
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:02,135
Calf's head.

290
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:07,243
We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth
and then wrap it tight in canvas...

291
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:11,205
and put it down in a pit
of hot mesquite coals for 18 hours.

292
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,682
And do those brains taste sweet!

293
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,553
How fascinating!

294
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:21,353
I don't think I'm really terribly hungry.
It must be the heat.

295
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,256
You call this hot?

296
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,758
Wait till July!

297
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,962
Eat it while it's hot!

298
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,498
What's the matter with her, Bick?

299
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,106
That's what I was afraid of!

300
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,152
Leslie?

301
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,703
Good morning, Luz.

302
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:13,532
What are you doing up?

303
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,139
Getting breakfast.

304
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,951
I think there's something
we should get in the clear.

305
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,515
I don't want to take your place.
I want you to know that.

306
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,986
But I can't have you
taking my place either.

307
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,727
I can't be just a guest
in my husband's house.

308
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,233
There you are.

309
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,667
Good morning, darling.

310
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,500
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

311
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:48,575
You look fine.

312
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:53,438
I want everybody to know, no matter
what happens around here in the future...

313
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:56,040
I am never going to faint again.

314
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:07,189
I'll never get the hang of you,
Mrs. Benedict.

315
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:26,280
A horse that cost you a lot
for breeding stock, I'd use it for breeding.

316
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:29,545
I wouldn't let anyone ride him.
I wouldn't care if she's your wife.

317
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:34,552
I'd see she rides a more gentle animal
if I were you.

318
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,426
She's going to fall off and break her neck.

319
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,304
That's Old Polo. He's head <i>vaquero</i>.

320
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,279
He's been here longer than any of us.

321
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:05,048
Since Grandpa Benedict's time.

322
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:18,155
Look at them, honey!

323
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:23,135
There's never been anything like them
in this world, I can tell you.

324
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:25,495
Did you ever see such stock?

325
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,005
Are they all ours?

326
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:32,305
These and 49,000 others just like them.

327
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:37,543
Granddaddy and his boys
used to drive his longhorns...

328
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:40,587
great herds of them,
all the way to Kansas.

329
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,126
He was a pretty good old boy.
I mean, he was tough, too.

330
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:54,033
My old man brought in stock from Europe
and bred them in the best ways.

331
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,089
Look out!

332
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:02,334
This right here is the result, honey.

333
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:04,376
Look at them.

334
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,094
How are you doing?

335
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:05,361
Tired, honey?

336
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:07,601
Don't you worry about me.

337
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,937
I'm a tough Texan now.

338
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,275
You know, I love you, Tex.

339
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:36,297
Howdy, everybody.

340
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:44,129
Hold on a minute. I want you
to take Mrs. Benedict back in with you.

341
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:47,435
Go with Jett, and get out of this heat.

342
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:49,034
Honey, I'm fine, really.

343
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:51,808
There's no use overdoing it.
Go along with Jett.

344
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,799
Good morning, Jett.

345
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,464
Take it easy, Jett.

346
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:20,066
I don't want to chew on this, Bick...

347
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:23,307
but I think we'd better get it straight.

348
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,609
I run the house, don't I?

349
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:28,809
Her house. Her kitchen. Her help.

350
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,212
She doesn't even speak Spanish.

351
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,448
They understand English
when they want to.

352
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:36,719
I know how to handle Mexicans.
I've done it all my life.

353
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,993
They'd sit on their honkers all day
if I didn't keep after them.

354
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,757
All right, Luz. Cool off.

355
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,961
I thought we ought to talk
without her around.

356
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:55,338
I just don't want to feel that
you're setting up against me, Bick.

357
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:02,580
Nobody is setting up against you, Luz.

358
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:05,480
That gal's my wife.

359
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:10,282
And you're fair enough, I think,
to try and get along with her.

360
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:15,655
All right.

361
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:19,433
I'll get a horse and help push
the stock along.

362
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:21,968
Maybe it'll make me feel better.

363
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:24,302
You gotta push something.

364
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:27,374
When I get enough, I'll ride on in.

365
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:33,906
Why did you come to Texas?

366
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:38,711
I mean, everybody else's trying
to get away from here.

367
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:41,944
Me, I'll get out of here one of these days.

368
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:45,987
This is my husband's land.

369
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,550
This is his home.

370
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,096
Who gets hold of this much land
unless they took it off somebody else?

371
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:01,807
You're not exactly loyal
to your employer, Jett.

372
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:04,308
No, I'm not complaining.

373
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,547
They bought this land long ago.

374
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:09,409
The Benedicts.

375
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,486
- They got it though purchase, years ago.
- Took it from some ignorant Mexicans.

376
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:18,717
That's not true. They bought and traded
for Spanish land grants.

377
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,990
They paid for it all right.
They paid five cents an acre.

378
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:28,323
I know my folks were here long enough
to get rich, too.

379
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:32,935
Except they just weren't too foxy.

380
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,577
Keep it on, boy. I'll ride him.

381
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:24,721
Nobody rides him but the <i>señora</i>.

382
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:27,223
I've been riding what I want to
for 30 years.

383
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:29,352
Already he bucked off López.

384
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:32,589
If he bucks me down,
he won't be the first one that's done it.

385
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:38,299
I suppose you came out here
to show me how to run things, too.

386
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:40,425
Let's go.

387
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,346
I'm not too awful bad now.

388
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:04,220
I've got a few friends.
And <i>Madama</i> likes me.

389
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:09,929
And Bick...
Now, even old Bick likes me a little bit.

390
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:15,663
Of course,
they don't like me quite enough to...

391
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:20,534
kind of divvy up
what they got way too much of.

392
00:44:25,381 --> 00:44:29,283
You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?
But I like you.

393
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,184
I like you, too.

394
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:45,397
You're the best-looking gal
we've seen around here in a long time.

395
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,370
The prettiest one
I think I've seen down here.

396
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:54,498
Thank you, Jett.

397
00:44:55,043 --> 00:44:57,011
That's a very nice compliment.

398
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:00,844
I'll tell my husband of that,
with your approval.

399
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:08,088
No, I wouldn't do that.

400
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,060
No, I wouldn't do that.

401
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:51,626
Beautiful Reata!

402
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:55,766
Them's your neighbors live there.

403
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:58,928
Them kids there.
Them's your ranch people.

404
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,368
Those are Ángel Obregón's kids.

405
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,176
That's the man who met us at the train.

406
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,445
Sure in good shape, ain't they?
Whole bunch of them sick.

407
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,211
What's the matter with them?

408
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:15,083
I don't know. Just sick. Every one of them.

409
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:19,616
Wait a minute. I want to get out here.

410
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:21,853
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

411
00:46:22,629 --> 00:46:23,857
Wait.

412
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:30,202
You're the boss.
And you know it, don't you?

413
00:46:33,706 --> 00:46:34,968
May I come in?

414
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:43,809
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

415
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:46,514
<i>Perdoname...</i>

416
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:49,248
that I do not rise.

417
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:54,390
The baby is sick.

418
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:56,888
My milk is not good.

419
00:48:24,147 --> 00:48:25,910
Have you seen a doctor?

420
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:30,416
Doctor? It is too far to come.

421
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:37,482
Mrs. Leslie,
I think we'd better be getting on.

422
00:48:40,263 --> 00:48:42,093
This baby is extremely ill.

423
00:48:42,898 --> 00:48:44,923
You're not supposed to be in there.

424
00:48:46,835 --> 00:48:50,271
Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregón.
I'll be back soon.

425
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:54,332
Bick's going to blow a gasket.

426
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:10,353
What is it?

427
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:13,024
What's happened to him?

428
00:49:14,263 --> 00:49:15,457
What's wrong?

429
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,479
Where in the world have you been?
I've been looking for you, too.

430
00:49:36,951 --> 00:49:38,509
What happened to her?

431
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,417
I stopped by the village.

432
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:43,654
What happened?

433
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,217
It's just awful.

434
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:50,194
I don't know. She was riding War Winds.

435
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:53,764
She might have been thrown
or something.

436
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:00,800
What does the doctor say?

437
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,809
It's bad.

438
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:07,744
She hit her head on a mesquite stump.

439
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,558
She's been riding since she was six.

440
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:26,159
She could ride anything.
And now this happens.

441
00:50:50,456 --> 00:50:51,548
How is she?

442
00:50:52,157 --> 00:50:54,523
She's in a state of shock. Very serious.

443
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,187
Concussion, possible hemorrhaging.

444
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,188
I'm doing all I can do.

445
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,066
I called Dr. Borneholm on the phone.

446
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,526
He'll be along any minute.

447
00:52:23,413 --> 00:52:25,779
If only I hadn't bought that horse...

448
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,941
Don't blame yourself, Jordan.

449
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:34,952
If I hadn't, she'd be alive right now.

450
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:37,582
Don't blame yourself.

451
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:43,521
This is a great misfortune,
but no one is to blame.

452
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:49,502
Things happen.

453
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:09,154
- Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.
- How do you do?

454
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:12,852
I sure wish I could've made it for Luz.

455
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:16,260
Dr. Walker did everything he could,
I assure you of that.

456
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:24,066
Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,
I'm afraid.

457
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:27,397
Mrs. Obregón's baby is very sick.

458
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:32,273
His temperature must be at least 105.
Will you stop by, please?

459
00:53:33,048 --> 00:53:34,276
Mrs. Obregón?

460
00:53:34,783 --> 00:53:36,307
In the village.

461
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:38,685
Jett will take you.

462
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:50,894
I'll go with you myself, Doctor.

463
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:57,701
What is this?

464
00:53:58,605 --> 00:54:00,163
You can't do that.

465
00:54:00,674 --> 00:54:02,039
He can't go there.

466
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,142
He's our doctor.

467
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,774
- Our doctor?
- Yes.

468
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:09,348
You mean, the Benedicts' only?

469
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,408
No, I mean, all of us.

470
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:16,014
He doesn't tend those people.

471
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:21,223
They have a way of doing things
by themselves.

472
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:25,255
How did she get there?

473
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:29,825
Now, don't go climbing on me.
I don't feel too good about it.

474
00:54:30,203 --> 00:54:33,570
Jordan, darling,
I don't think you quite understand.

475
00:54:34,173 --> 00:54:37,631
There's a child who's very sick.
I must take Dr. Walker.

476
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:41,479
You'll go, won't you, Doctor?

477
00:54:44,183 --> 00:54:46,481
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

478
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:39,400
I'm a lot better, honey.

479
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,004
That's a good boy.

480
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,638
Where's my horse?

481
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:57,880
I shot him.

482
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,957
Bone was broken.

483
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,891
Somebody had to do it.
I thought it'd be better if it was me.

484
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:13,028
The baby?

485
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,703
He is alive, thanks to Dr. Walker.

486
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:24,769
Good.

487
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,152
We need you in here for a few minutes
if you can break away.

488
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,690
You're sure holding up fine.

489
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:47,531
In times like this
folks really show what they're made of...

490
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,731
and you're sure holding up fine.

491
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,342
Vern and me thought a lot of Luz.

492
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,813
I guess everybody did.

493
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:05,849
At least everybody came.

494
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:09,320
It's the biggest gathering for a funeral
I ever saw in Texas.

495
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:11,689
It's a shame Luz wasn't here to enjoy it.

496
00:57:13,128 --> 00:57:16,393
I mean, she always did like
a big get-together.

497
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,096
She'd have had a fine time.

498
00:57:20,736 --> 00:57:23,068
- Come to see us.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

499
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:24,298
Come see us.

500
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:31,506
I think you'll agree, your sister
was a very generous woman.

501
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:36,945
She wanted that boy
to have something worthwhile.

502
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,415
Now, that little piece of land is worth...

503
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:42,922
$500, $600 at most.

504
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:48,285
I'm going to ask you, in reverence
to the memory of Luz Benedict...

505
00:57:49,063 --> 00:57:52,089
I'm going to ask you
to give one Jett Rink...

506
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:55,562
a check for twice the value of that land.

507
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:58,235
We can clean up the whole matter
right now.

508
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:11,515
Come inside, I want to talk to you.

509
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:13,075
Just a minute, Bick.

510
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:16,587
I'm afraid I'm going to beat you to it.

511
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:18,584
I'm quitting.

512
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,958
I lost the one friend I had in this place,
and I know it, too.

513
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,163
So I quit, I dead quit.
You don't have to say another word to me.

514
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:28,924
Nobody's firing you.

515
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:31,261
Boy, howdy, nobody's firing me.

516
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:33,569
I told you, I quit!

517
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,335
Nobody wants to fire you.

518
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:39,271
Come inside and listen
to what we have to say.

519
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:42,011
Come on in here, Jett.
Come on in here, boy.

520
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:45,410
Hi, Jett. Nice to see you.

521
00:58:45,952 --> 00:58:48,216
- Howdy, Jett. Good to see you.
- Howdy, Jett.

522
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:51,821
Have my seat, boy. Sit right down.
You sure look good today.

523
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:56,662
Sit down. I'm going to tell you about
a piece of luck that's come your way.

524
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,892
Sit down, young man,
and make yourself comfortable.

525
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:04,226
It's a real bad wind
that doesn't blow somebody some good.

526
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:12,205
I don't have to tell you that Luz was
a woman of strong, sentimental feeling.

527
00:59:15,381 --> 00:59:19,715
She prepared a list of things she wanted
to give all the people on Reata.

528
00:59:20,052 --> 00:59:22,987
Yes. We find that she wanted to...

529
00:59:24,456 --> 00:59:29,120
We find that her bequest to you was
in the nature of a little piece of ground.

530
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:33,688
It's the little piece we used to call
Buffalo Wallow.

531
00:59:39,404 --> 00:59:42,396
She wanted to give you something.
I know she did.

532
00:59:44,242 --> 00:59:48,736
It's always been my aim to try
to keep Reata intact within the family.

533
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:55,042
Now, that little piece is worth at most...
How much, Bale?

534
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:58,478
At the most, I'd say $500 or $600, Bick.

535
01:00:00,258 --> 01:00:03,421
Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor
his sister's wishes...

536
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:07,763
and, of course, right along
with his own personal feeling for you...

537
01:00:08,466 --> 01:00:12,300
He wants to see to it that you get
something really worthwhile.

538
01:00:12,804 --> 01:00:15,739
Now, to get down to the point, Mr. Rink...

539
01:00:16,274 --> 01:00:19,868
we're prepared to place in your hands,
in cash...

540
01:00:20,477 --> 01:00:23,503
the sum of $1,200.

541
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:37,059
$1,200...

542
01:00:37,694 --> 01:00:41,790
which, any of these gentlemen here
I'm sure will be happy to tell you...

543
01:00:41,865 --> 01:00:43,992
is twice the value of that land.

544
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:47,764
- Definitely.
- At least twice the value of that land.

545
01:01:02,518 --> 01:01:06,511
That's a lot of money.
What are you aiming do with all of it?

546
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:09,214
You're in the chips now, boy.

547
01:01:10,192 --> 01:01:12,490
There it is. There it is, boy.

548
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:15,459
And it's all yours.

549
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:25,300
I don't know what to say.

550
01:01:29,378 --> 01:01:30,936
She sure was a fine lady.

551
01:01:31,013 --> 01:01:33,345
Yes, she was a fine lady. Hallelujah!

552
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:34,604
Amen.

553
01:01:43,391 --> 01:01:47,122
I want you to know
that I appreciate her generosity.

554
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,028
Yours, too, Bick. And you all.

555
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,028
I want to thank you for it.

556
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,663
You know something, Bick?

557
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,706
I don't know, but it might not be...

558
01:02:04,946 --> 01:02:08,939
a pretty good idea
to gamble along with old <i>Madama</i>.

559
01:02:11,753 --> 01:02:12,980
How do you mean?

560
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:15,683
Just gamble on.

561
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:19,254
Just keep what she gave me.

562
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:27,923
I'm sentimental, too, Bick.

563
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:36,539
I think it's good to gamble on with her.

564
01:02:39,011 --> 01:02:41,309
I know that land ain't worth much...

565
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:45,441
but then someday I just might up...

566
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:48,449
and put my own fence around her...

567
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:51,679
and call her Little Reata.

568
01:02:58,063 --> 01:02:59,052
See you.

569
01:03:04,803 --> 01:03:08,762
There's one thing on this earth more
important than money, and that's land!

570
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,400
I heard Luz say it a thousand times.

571
01:03:11,476 --> 01:03:14,070
Pa said it and Bick, too. And it's true!

572
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:17,543
If you ever get to Deep Smith,
you come and pay us a visit.

573
01:03:17,783 --> 01:03:20,013
We're just on the other side of Umbarger.

574
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:23,418
Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,
only we had a run of luck.

575
01:03:23,488 --> 01:03:26,889
- Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.
- How wonderful.

576
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:29,256
Right now it's bringing in a million.

577
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,556
- A million gallons?
- Dollars.

578
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:33,621
A million dollars a year?

579
01:03:33,697 --> 01:03:35,426
A million dollars a month.

580
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:40,427
- Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.
- Thank you for coming.

581
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:18,050
I just love talking to you, Uncle Bawley.

582
01:06:19,993 --> 01:06:22,291
Now that it's over, you get your fellow...

583
01:06:22,362 --> 01:06:24,626
to take you around
and show you our country.

584
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:28,798
See San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.

585
01:06:29,302 --> 01:06:32,738
I'm so impatient.
I want to see it all right now.

586
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:38,166
You don't have to hurry, honey.
It'll be here when you get around to it.

587
01:06:39,312 --> 01:06:41,177
It's been here a long time.

588
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:46,641
And when you've seen it all
and have lived with it as I have...

589
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,388
in 25 years from now,
you'll feel about Texas just like I do.

590
01:06:53,392 --> 01:06:55,519
Twenty-five years from now!

591
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,928
Twenty-five years from now
I'll be almost 50.

592
01:07:00,232 --> 01:07:01,893
It's a nice age, Leslie.

593
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:05,860
You'll see wonderful things in Texas
when you're 50.

594
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:09,433
Perhaps.

595
01:07:11,043 --> 01:07:12,977
But I won't care as much then.

596
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:14,576
You'll care more.

597
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:18,706
Because then
you'll have been part of it all.

598
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:20,849
Come on, we need you in the powwow.

599
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,484
I'm coming, gentlemen.

600
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:34,558
You get with it, Gomez.
Get your people out.

601
01:07:34,932 --> 01:07:38,163
I don't want any of them
sitting on their honkers come election day.

602
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:41,228
Everything will be <i>bueno, señor</i>.
It will be the same: Good.

603
01:07:52,483 --> 01:07:53,711
I love you.

604
01:07:56,788 --> 01:07:57,846
Thank you.

605
01:07:59,057 --> 01:08:01,490
We're just talking business. Just business.

606
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:04,993
Please, don't mind me.

607
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,556
Do go on.

608
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:12,133
I'll listen, quiet as a little old mouse.

609
01:08:14,671 --> 01:08:16,229
You'd be bored, honey.

610
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:17,971
This is dull.

611
01:08:18,775 --> 01:08:20,936
Why, I'd be fascinated.

612
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,771
We're talking about politics.

613
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:30,676
You married me in Washington,
remember, darling?

614
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:34,384
I lived next door to politics.
Brought up with it.

615
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:37,816
Please go on talking. I'd love it.

616
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:40,685
This is men's stuff.

617
01:08:41,764 --> 01:08:45,200
Leslie, how about a cup of coffee
or a drink?

618
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:50,498
Men's stuff!

619
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:54,333
Lord have mercy!

620
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:00,913
Set up my spinning wheel, girls.
I'll join the harem section in a minute.

621
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:05,951
Don't you go worrying
your pretty little head about politics.

622
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:09,455
You mean my pretty, empty head,
don't you, Judge?

623
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:14,763
Could I get the coffee for you?

624
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:19,632
You, too, Uncle Brutus?

625
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:24,027
You don't feel well, Leslie.

626
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:26,605
I feel just great!

627
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:30,039
My adrenaline glands
are pumping beautifully.

628
01:09:34,048 --> 01:09:36,516
If I may say so before retiring...

629
01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:40,549
you gentlemen date back 100,000 years.

630
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:45,323
You ought to be wearing leopard skins
and carrying clubs.

631
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,686
Politics!

632
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:48,354
Business!

633
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:53,257
What's so masculine about a conversation
that a woman can't enter into it?

634
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:57,336
Leslie, you're tired.

635
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,005
Perhaps I am.

636
01:10:20,727 --> 01:10:23,719
I reckon I'll go on upstairs
and get my beauty sleep.

637
01:10:23,997 --> 01:10:25,555
You go ahead on, honey.

638
01:10:28,135 --> 01:10:29,693
Good night, gentlemen.

639
01:10:40,546 --> 01:10:41,911
That's right.

640
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:46,078
Send the children on up to bed
so the grownups can talk.

641
01:10:50,389 --> 01:10:51,686
Good night, honey.

642
01:11:28,593 --> 01:11:30,220
I must have dropped off.

643
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:37,164
Darling, I am sorry
about my caveman speech.

644
01:11:39,404 --> 01:11:42,567
I'll apologize to the others first thing,
I promise.

645
01:11:42,774 --> 01:11:44,139
That's big of you.

646
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:47,538
You certainly distinguished yourself
this evening.

647
01:11:47,612 --> 01:11:50,240
- Shh, they can hear.
- Hear? They heard you already.

648
01:11:50,315 --> 01:11:54,045
Every word you said out there.
We date back 100,000 years.

649
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:57,547
I said I was sorry about the name-calling.

650
01:11:58,956 --> 01:12:00,947
It was very impolite, I know.

651
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,555
But in principle, I was absolutely right.

652
01:12:04,828 --> 01:12:08,355
You come down here
and try to tell us how to run things.

653
01:12:08,432 --> 01:12:10,798
Insulting my friends and everything.

654
01:12:11,068 --> 01:12:13,059
Now you look here, Leslie.

655
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:16,633
You're my wife, Mrs. Jordan Benedict.

656
01:12:17,341 --> 01:12:21,801
I'm asking you, when will you settle down
and behave like everybody else?

657
01:12:23,147 --> 01:12:25,615
- Never!
- Who do you think you are, anyhow?

658
01:12:25,683 --> 01:12:27,617
Joan of Arc, or something?

659
01:12:42,932 --> 01:12:45,264
Jordan, where are you going?

660
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:49,462
Jordan, take off your hat.

661
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,439
Carrying on like Carrie Nation!

662
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,502
Preaching stuff that's none
of your business, fixing the world.

663
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,911
Why don't you join a club?

664
01:12:58,981 --> 01:13:02,439
Honestly, Jordan.
You make me sound just awful.

665
01:13:06,089 --> 01:13:07,647
I'm not all that bad.

666
01:13:08,658 --> 01:13:11,490
You knew what a frightful girl I was
when you married me.

667
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,292
I did not deceive you, sir.

668
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:19,327
From the first moment,
I couldn't have been more unpleasant.

669
01:13:22,871 --> 01:13:25,066
Anyway, you're stuck with me.

670
01:13:30,112 --> 01:13:32,103
Yes, I guess.

671
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,284
Honey, take your hat off.

672
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:52,660
Besides...

673
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:55,129
you love me very much.

674
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:05,177
That fine mind of yours
gets pretty repulsive at times.

675
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,179
That's not what you told me on the train.

676
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:13,313
Now you're gonna throw that up to me.

677
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:15,318
I thought what we...

678
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:19,685
I thought what we said on the train
was in confidence.

679
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:22,926
Of course, darling.

680
01:14:24,598 --> 01:14:27,590
But I'll never forget a single word
you say to me.

681
01:14:28,635 --> 01:14:31,001
You can be pretty wonderful at times.

682
01:14:44,284 --> 01:14:45,581
Come on, partner.

683
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:49,051
Why don't you kick off your spurs?

684
01:15:09,608 --> 01:15:12,941
What a glorious, gorgeous,
brand-new day!

685
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,972
Let's spend every hour of it, just you and I.

686
01:15:18,217 --> 01:15:19,844
Honey, I'm beat.

687
01:15:20,552 --> 01:15:21,541
Why?

688
01:15:23,455 --> 01:15:26,253
You have all the good things in the world.

689
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:29,427
And a woman
who loves you very, very much.

690
01:15:39,171 --> 01:15:41,935
But that arguing takes a lot out of me.

691
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,541
That was just frightful.

692
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:54,978
The best part about quarreling
is making up.

693
01:15:56,988 --> 01:15:59,923
When we make up, we make up.
Don't we, honey?

694
01:16:02,894 --> 01:16:07,558
Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?
Just let somebody else run Reata.

695
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:09,795
Couldn't we?

696
01:16:11,869 --> 01:16:14,030
Honey, I want you to understand this.

697
01:16:14,572 --> 01:16:16,733
I run Reata at all times.

698
01:16:18,009 --> 01:16:19,499
That's the way it is.

699
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:23,236
Everything that's in it and on it
is run by me.

700
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:25,642
Don't raise your voice.

701
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:27,808
That's the way it's always been.

702
01:16:28,218 --> 01:16:31,449
Everything that has a Reata brand on it
is run by me.

703
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:35,986
Does that include me?

704
01:16:38,295 --> 01:16:42,959
That's the way my father ran this outfit
and my grandfather, too. All of it.

705
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:46,466
He kept it together for his son,
and my father for his.

706
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,327
And I'm keeping it together for mine.

707
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:51,871
All 595,000 square miles?

708
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,408
All of it. For my son.

709
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:56,971
You could at least say "our son."

710
01:16:58,014 --> 01:16:59,003
Our son.

711
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:04,249
Don't you think that might be
a little too much for one little baby?

712
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:06,348
Not if he's a Benedict.

713
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:13,685
You'd better hope this is a boy.

714
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:20,257
Our baby. I just said I'm hoping it's a boy.

715
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:23,902
What do you mean?

716
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,635
Why didn't you tell me?

717
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,039
I'm telling you now.

718
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,649
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, I should know.

719
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,748
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

720
01:17:44,058 --> 01:17:47,516
And our baby is going to be a boy.
I know it.

721
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,261
A boy very much like his father.

722
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:56,834
In many ways...

723
01:17:58,539 --> 01:17:59,836
but not all.

724
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:11,313
Shouldn't she be putting on
a little weight?

725
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:18,018
It's natural, I think,
for him to be gaining faster.

726
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,115
Let me see.

727
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:26,860
Very heavy.

728
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:35,907
Hello, sweetheart.

729
01:18:37,177 --> 01:18:38,838
He's building up fine.

730
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,204
"I am now stronger than ever.

731
01:18:42,282 --> 01:18:45,945
"I'm helping a young Dr. Guerra
get started here.

732
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:50,613
"Almost every day I find myself
walking three or four miles...

733
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:55,985
"<i>through the dusty and dirty streets</i>
<i>of Vientecito village.</i>"

734
01:19:05,971 --> 01:19:07,962
Hello, Ángel. How are you?

735
01:19:08,674 --> 01:19:09,936
Good.

736
01:19:15,815 --> 01:19:18,841
I'd like to speak to Mr. Gomez, the boss.

737
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:20,818
The man that runs this place.

738
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,377
Mrs. Benedict, what is it I can do?

739
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:27,523
Mr. Gomez, I'm going to leave
Dr. Guerra here with you.

740
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:30,395
He'll tell you things
that must be done immediately.

741
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:32,593
This place is a scandal.

742
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:37,166
Thank you, Dr. Guerra.
I'll get in touch with you.

743
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:12,896
Hello, Jett.

744
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:15,798
- Howdy, Miss Leslie.
- How are you?

745
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:18,231
I'm doing good.

746
01:20:19,676 --> 01:20:22,304
- You made some improvements.
- Do you like it?

747
01:20:22,546 --> 01:20:23,740
It looks good.

748
01:20:30,788 --> 01:20:33,586
It ain't much yet, but it's coming along.

749
01:20:34,324 --> 01:20:36,155
I wouldn't have believed it.

750
01:20:36,226 --> 01:20:37,625
Believed what?

751
01:20:38,028 --> 01:20:42,124
Truthfully, I didn't expect this sort
of talent to be one of your virtues.

752
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:47,793
That's the first time I was ever accused
of having any of that.

753
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:55,033
It really is nice, Jett. Real nice.

754
01:20:56,579 --> 01:20:57,671
Someday...

755
01:20:57,947 --> 01:21:00,848
I'll have a place
that no one will be ashamed of.

756
01:21:10,393 --> 01:21:12,224
I cut them out of the newspaper.

757
01:21:12,295 --> 01:21:15,753
I thought maybe they'd kind of
dress the place up a little bit.

758
01:21:16,966 --> 01:21:17,955
Sweet of you.

759
01:21:28,945 --> 01:21:32,278
Do you want to come on in here,
sit down and rest a minute?

760
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:33,570
Thank you.

761
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:47,560
Having kids seems to agree with you,
you know?

762
01:21:48,463 --> 01:21:50,795
You're looking prettier than ever.

763
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:53,792
Just as good, anyway.

764
01:22:09,251 --> 01:22:11,116
My goodness, and tea!

765
01:22:11,586 --> 01:22:12,950
You like tea, don't you?

766
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:16,922
I love it. It seems down here everybody
drinks gallons of coffee.

767
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:19,250
I know.

768
01:22:36,944 --> 01:22:39,572
Mind if I pay you
a rather personal compliment?

769
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,072
What is it?

770
01:22:44,952 --> 01:22:47,443
You make a very excellent cup of tea.

771
01:22:50,624 --> 01:22:53,183
I do a lot of things in a pinch.

772
01:22:59,499 --> 01:23:02,900
Do you like one lump or do you like two?

773
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,161
I think I'll take mine straight.

774
01:23:07,173 --> 01:23:08,902
That's good enough for me.

775
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,413
That's not too good, is it?

776
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,311
When will you get married, Jett?

777
01:23:22,855 --> 01:23:26,848
Don't you need somebody to help you
with this kind of responsibility?

778
01:23:28,328 --> 01:23:32,161
When I get some time to look around,
I'll go back East and...

779
01:23:32,864 --> 01:23:34,991
To Maryland, places like that.

780
01:23:35,634 --> 01:23:40,128
You got any attractive sisters there that
might be interested in some poor people?

781
01:23:41,873 --> 01:23:43,864
Money isn't all, you know?

782
01:23:45,744 --> 01:23:47,644
Not when you've got it.

783
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,111
The other people around here...

784
01:23:57,356 --> 01:24:00,325
why don't they help themselves
like you've done?

785
01:24:02,127 --> 01:24:05,688
When you say "other people,"
what do you mean?

786
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:12,669
I've just come back from Vientecito.

787
01:24:13,337 --> 01:24:15,430
That bunch of wetbacks?

788
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,873
You don't go mixing me up
with none of them.

789
01:24:19,777 --> 01:24:24,407
I'm just as much of Texas
as Bick Benedict is.

790
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:30,945
- I'm no wetback.
- I know that.

791
01:24:33,391 --> 01:24:37,327
You're very like Jordan in that respect.
Attitude, everything.

792
01:24:38,496 --> 01:24:41,829
But your situation is so different.
You're a working man.

793
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:46,533
That's something I'm gonna try to fix.

794
01:24:48,004 --> 01:24:49,665
Someday I will.

795
01:24:52,275 --> 01:24:53,537
All right, Gomez.

796
01:24:58,048 --> 01:24:59,515
Yes, I understand.

797
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:01,146
Yes, thank you.

798
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,281
Thanks for the tea party, Jett.

799
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:09,115
And don't be such a stranger.

800
01:25:11,661 --> 01:25:13,629
Stop by and pay us a visit.

801
01:25:14,898 --> 01:25:16,627
I don't know about that.

802
01:25:16,699 --> 01:25:19,099
Bick's still got his kettle on for me.

803
01:25:39,288 --> 01:25:40,516
Leslie.

804
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:43,321
Hello, darling.

805
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,385
I was just having tea with Jett Rink.

806
01:25:47,463 --> 01:25:50,455
Gomez telephoned.
"Mrs. Benedict went to Vientecito.

807
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:52,958
"I hope you're not displeased," he said.

808
01:25:53,035 --> 01:25:56,027
I've told you before...
What's this about Jett Rink?

809
01:25:56,538 --> 01:25:59,530
He made tea. Isn't that unbelievable?

810
01:26:00,476 --> 01:26:02,444
He does so want to improve himself.

811
01:26:04,278 --> 01:26:07,247
But your man Gomez, that camp he runs...

812
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,239
It's hopeless.

813
01:26:10,318 --> 01:26:13,446
You can't go around this place
with no regard for who you are...

814
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:15,284
interfering with those people.

815
01:26:15,656 --> 01:26:17,920
Jordan, that place is a scandal.

816
01:26:18,693 --> 01:26:20,786
Dr. Guerra threw his hands up in horror.

817
01:26:21,028 --> 01:26:22,655
That's his problem.

818
01:26:23,131 --> 01:26:26,589
You've been a powerful Texan for
100 years. Why don't you do something?

819
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:28,726
I'm not the Red Cross, I'm a cow man.

820
01:26:28,903 --> 01:26:30,461
If you won't, I will.

821
01:26:30,538 --> 01:26:32,472
If you go near those dumps again...

822
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,441
if I ever hear you get mixed up
in this migratory mess...

823
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,943
- What?
- I'll leave you!

824
01:26:37,145 --> 01:26:39,443
That's what I'll do, I'll leave you!

825
01:26:43,316 --> 01:26:46,046
There's my darling little girl.

826
01:26:46,987 --> 01:26:51,321
Did you think your naughty mama was
never going to come up to see you?

827
01:26:51,992 --> 01:26:53,960
One thing you can be sure of:

828
01:26:54,027 --> 01:26:57,588
One of these days I'll run
that Jett Rink's hide out of this country.

829
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:25,354
Say hello to Luz. Say, "Hello, Luz."

830
01:27:28,394 --> 01:27:31,158
Look there. Say hello to little Luz.

831
01:27:35,134 --> 01:27:38,126
I don't care what you say.
She does look like Luz.

832
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:40,138
Oh, honey.

833
01:27:41,874 --> 01:27:45,037
We're all gathered for the fourth
anniversary of my son's birth.

834
01:27:45,811 --> 01:27:47,301
And your daughter's.

835
01:27:49,815 --> 01:27:52,477
And I want to take
this auspicious occasion...

836
01:27:53,152 --> 01:27:55,484
to say that this young fellow here...

837
01:27:56,589 --> 01:27:59,217
is gonna grow up to be
one of Reata's top hands.

838
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:04,217
I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.

839
01:28:06,064 --> 01:28:09,056
Maybe he'll even grow up
to be better than his old man.

840
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,498
Girls, look at the pony.

841
01:28:18,943 --> 01:28:20,240
There he is, son.

842
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:22,277
He's all yours.

843
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:24,338
All mine, Daddy?

844
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,594
Take him around, Ángel.

845
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:02,282
Take it easy, son.

846
01:29:02,853 --> 01:29:04,184
He doesn't want to.

847
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:06,312
I rode before I could walk.

848
01:29:07,457 --> 01:29:10,620
But that was you.
He's another person entirely.

849
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:15,727
He is a Benedict. He's gonna stay
on that saddle if I have to tie him on.

850
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:35,111
Take him away.

851
01:29:39,388 --> 01:29:41,117
- No.
- Let him ride, Polo.

852
01:29:42,325 --> 01:29:43,349
Let him ride.

853
01:29:53,869 --> 01:29:56,530
Take him up for his nap. I think he's tired.

854
01:30:35,843 --> 01:30:37,834
That wasn't so bad, was it, son?

855
01:31:05,739 --> 01:31:09,231
Bick knows everything about running
a ranch. Bone, hide and hair.

856
01:31:11,979 --> 01:31:14,242
He doesn't know a thing
about raising kids...

857
01:31:14,313 --> 01:31:16,281
any more than his father did.

858
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:18,776
You just stay with it your way...

859
01:31:19,318 --> 01:31:22,754
and help those children grow up to be
what they want to be.

860
01:31:23,122 --> 01:31:25,317
I will, Uncle Bawley. I promise.

861
01:31:30,196 --> 01:31:32,187
We're going to hit the hay.

862
01:31:36,369 --> 01:31:38,701
- Good night, Leslie.
- Good night.

863
01:31:38,771 --> 01:31:43,231
- Good night.
- Good night.

864
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:51,478
It's time for me to turn in.

865
01:31:55,487 --> 01:31:58,718
- Good night, Bick.
- Good night, Bawley.

866
01:32:02,928 --> 01:32:06,420
Good night, everybody.
Don't forget to turn off the rain.

867
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:35,489
Are you tired?

868
01:32:36,727 --> 01:32:37,716
No.

869
01:32:42,666 --> 01:32:46,158
What's happening is we're getting
on each other's nerves.

870
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:47,528
Could be.

871
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:54,308
We've been together every day and night
since we first met.

872
01:32:55,846 --> 01:32:57,177
Is that bad?

873
01:32:58,649 --> 01:32:59,638
No.

874
01:33:02,086 --> 01:33:04,884
We're getting in the habit
of snapping at each other...

875
01:33:08,392 --> 01:33:11,053
about things
we should've adjusted to years ago.

876
01:33:18,067 --> 01:33:22,731
I think it would be a good idea
if I took the children home for a visit.

877
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:25,196
Home?

878
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:31,806
If you're homesick...

879
01:33:32,749 --> 01:33:35,081
I mean, if that's the way you want it.

880
01:33:35,852 --> 01:33:38,821
- That's not the way I want it, Jordan.
- All right, then.

881
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,452
It'll be better for us
if we're apart for a while.

882
01:33:49,097 --> 01:33:50,894
Better for us and the children.

883
01:33:53,235 --> 01:33:56,363
It'll give us both a chance
to think things over.

884
01:34:06,481 --> 01:34:08,073
You know best, I guess.

885
01:34:09,952 --> 01:34:11,579
I think it will be best.

886
01:35:03,004 --> 01:35:04,437
- Hi, there.
- 'Morning.

887
01:35:04,772 --> 01:35:06,432
Fine day for riding.

888
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,107
Just magnificent.

889
01:35:10,543 --> 01:35:11,771
See you later.

890
01:35:14,948 --> 01:35:16,438
She's a lucky girl.

891
01:35:17,951 --> 01:35:21,182
If I had it to do again,
I'd still walk off with Jordan.

892
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:24,053
Even if I knew it'd end like this.

893
01:35:26,826 --> 01:35:28,726
You have no time to be homesick...

894
01:35:28,795 --> 01:35:31,764
with this wedding and Thanksgiving
on us together.

895
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:36,896
Pedro, come here.

896
01:35:40,607 --> 01:35:42,939
Pedro, eat your dinner like a good boy.

897
01:36:12,938 --> 01:36:17,671
Merciful Father, we bow our heads
in gratitude on this Thanksgiving Day.

898
01:36:18,677 --> 01:36:22,169
We give thee humble and hearty thanks
for this, thy bounty...

899
01:36:23,314 --> 01:36:25,874
beseeching thee to continue
thy loving kindness...

900
01:36:26,684 --> 01:36:31,712
that our land may still yield her increase,
to thy glory and our comfort.

901
01:36:32,423 --> 01:36:33,412
Amen.

902
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:40,921
Is that Pedro?

903
01:36:41,966 --> 01:36:43,456
Yes, darling.

904
01:37:26,576 --> 01:37:28,908
It's a day
when we're supposed to be happy.

905
01:37:30,914 --> 01:37:32,541
Come on now, smile.

906
01:37:33,283 --> 01:37:34,545
Like Mommy.

907
01:37:44,026 --> 01:37:45,789
Is something wrong, Miss Leslie?

908
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:57,865
Now maybe you'll stop crying.

909
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:01,198
It's a message to you from your father.

910
01:38:01,744 --> 01:38:03,735
Is he gonna be here for dinner?

911
01:38:06,515 --> 01:38:07,504
No...

912
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:12,351
but he says,
"I hope my darlings are all very happy.

913
01:38:13,556 --> 01:38:18,220
"I want them to know I miss them
very much and love each one very much."

914
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:06,334
I could see you coming.
Why, Mr. Benedict, this is a good surprise!

915
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:11,708
We're having a wedding.
Sure is plenty of excitement.

916
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,071
"Dearly beloved...

917
01:40:20,278 --> 01:40:24,942
"we are gathered here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

918
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:30,077
"to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

919
01:40:30,855 --> 01:40:34,689
"which is an honorable estate
instituted of God.

920
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:40,024
"David, wilt thou have this woman
for thy wedded wife?

921
01:40:40,365 --> 01:40:45,029
"To live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

922
01:40:45,537 --> 01:40:49,200
"Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor her...

923
01:40:49,574 --> 01:40:54,237
"and keep her in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

924
01:40:55,212 --> 01:40:59,205
"keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?"

925
01:41:00,217 --> 01:41:01,206
I will.

926
01:41:02,519 --> 01:41:05,852
"Lacey, wilt thou have this man
for thy wedded husband...

927
01:41:06,357 --> 01:41:11,021
"to live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

928
01:41:12,196 --> 01:41:15,927
"Wilt thou love him, comfort him,
honor him...

929
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:21,303
"and keep him in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

930
01:41:22,106 --> 01:41:26,270
"keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?"

931
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:27,366
I will.

932
01:41:27,878 --> 01:41:30,210
"Bless, O Lord, this ring...

933
01:41:30,614 --> 01:41:35,277
"that he who gives it and she
who wears it may abide in thy peace...

934
01:41:35,685 --> 01:41:39,951
"and continue in thy favor
unto their life's end.

935
01:41:40,223 --> 01:41:41,212
"Amen."

936
01:41:45,728 --> 01:41:47,821
With this ring, I thee wed.

937
01:41:50,566 --> 01:41:55,060
"Those whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

938
01:41:56,406 --> 01:42:01,844
"For as much as David and Lacey have
consented together in holy wedlock...

939
01:42:03,713 --> 01:42:07,342
"I pronounce that they are man and wife."

940
01:42:40,415 --> 01:42:43,748
Are you ready to come back
to your old, beat-up cowhand?

941
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:49,680
I'm no different than I was when I left.

942
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:54,919
We Texans like a little vinegar
with our greens. It gives them flavor.

943
01:43:26,127 --> 01:43:27,958
What do you think of old King Tut?

944
01:43:28,028 --> 01:43:30,120
Boy, howdy, that's some hunk of beef!

945
01:43:30,196 --> 01:43:31,754
He's gonna make history, too.

946
01:43:31,965 --> 01:43:35,298
When Bick finishes this breeding program,
he'll have an animal...

947
01:43:35,602 --> 01:43:38,628
that's 99 percent beef
and the rest exaggeration.

948
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:42,227
Say, Ollie, do you see that?

949
01:44:43,936 --> 01:44:45,460
That's Rink's truck.

950
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:48,229
I don't want him
hauling through my place.

951
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:53,533
Jett's got the easement, Bick.
He's got a right to go through the land.

952
01:44:54,178 --> 01:44:55,645
No two ways about that.

953
01:44:55,713 --> 01:44:58,409
I'm tired of his prospecting.
I want him out of here.

954
01:44:58,482 --> 01:45:02,350
He's borrowed about all he could.
He's down to his last collar button.

955
01:45:03,421 --> 01:45:04,752
Sure he is.

956
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:09,821
Buy him out, Ollie.
Buy him out and get him out of here.

957
01:46:12,688 --> 01:46:14,349
Hello, Jett.

958
01:46:14,423 --> 01:46:15,754
What do you want?

959
01:46:26,869 --> 01:46:28,496
My well came in, Bick.

960
01:46:32,141 --> 01:46:33,130
Fine.

961
01:46:35,678 --> 01:46:37,270
That's wonderful, Jett.

962
01:46:39,415 --> 01:46:41,246
Everybody thought I had a duster.

963
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:46,714
You all thought Spindletop and
Burkburnett was all the oil there was.

964
01:46:47,488 --> 01:46:50,685
I'm here to tell you it ain't, boy. It's here.

965
01:46:52,093 --> 01:46:54,755
There ain't a dang thing
you gonna do about it.

966
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:56,724
My well came in big, so big.

967
01:46:57,332 --> 01:46:59,698
And there's more down there,
bigger wells.

968
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,202
I'm rich, Bick!

969
01:47:10,311 --> 01:47:13,542
I'm a rich one. I'm a rich boy.

970
01:47:15,216 --> 01:47:18,811
I'm gonna have more money
than you ever thought you could have.

971
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:21,547
You and the rest of you
stinking sons of Benedicts.

972
01:47:23,156 --> 01:47:26,091
Leslie, go into the house.
Take the women with you.

973
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:28,651
Jett, we're glad you struck oil.

974
01:47:29,696 --> 01:47:31,288
Now, you go on along home.

975
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,262
My, you sure do look pretty, Miss Leslie.

976
01:47:38,372 --> 01:47:40,203
You always did look pretty.

977
01:47:41,675 --> 01:47:43,370
Pretty, good enough to eat.

978
01:47:47,914 --> 01:47:49,438
Wait a minute.

979
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:51,474
Take it easy!

980
01:47:55,622 --> 01:47:56,953
You're touchy, Bick.

981
01:47:58,658 --> 01:48:00,386
Touchy as an old cook.

982
01:48:18,778 --> 01:48:21,713
You should have shot him a long time ago.

983
01:48:21,781 --> 01:48:23,544
Now he's too rich to kill.

984
01:49:10,185 --> 01:49:13,015
Tell your client that Reata is my property.

985
01:49:13,125 --> 01:49:15,425
And the name of Reata is my property.

986
01:49:15,725 --> 01:49:17,884
The Texas courts are fair.

987
01:49:18,394 --> 01:49:22,124
He is to cease using the name of my ranch
in his oil schemes.

988
01:49:22,194 --> 01:49:26,104
I won't have oil digging on Reata.
I won't stand for its name being used.

989
01:49:26,164 --> 01:49:27,504
Is that clear?

990
01:49:56,793 --> 01:49:57,783
Mom?

991
01:50:00,403 --> 01:50:01,563
Mother?

992
01:50:17,253 --> 01:50:20,183
They say Aunt Luz was really in love
with Jett Rink herself.

993
01:50:20,253 --> 01:50:22,783
Even if she was old enough
to be his mother.

994
01:50:22,923 --> 01:50:24,013
Now, Luz...

995
01:50:24,093 --> 01:50:26,083
She was a character.

996
01:50:26,523 --> 01:50:29,223
She was always trying to keep him
from getting married.

997
01:50:29,293 --> 01:50:31,263
He had to run off to marry you.

998
01:50:31,603 --> 01:50:32,723
What's that?

999
01:50:33,433 --> 01:50:34,732
Who said what?

1000
01:50:35,332 --> 01:50:36,802
Somebody. I forget.

1001
01:50:41,542 --> 01:50:43,532
You know what they say?

1002
01:50:43,842 --> 01:50:47,612
That every girl in Texas was trying
to catch Papa.

1003
01:50:48,612 --> 01:50:49,912
They said, quote:

1004
01:50:49,982 --> 01:50:53,472
"There wasn't a prize bull like him
since Sam Houston got married."

1005
01:50:54,392 --> 01:50:55,722
That's enough from her.

1006
01:50:56,952 --> 01:51:01,292
I'm sure it's quite true, darling.
It took me two whole days to land him.

1007
01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:07,862
Really? It all sounds so fascinating
and uncouth.

1008
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:32,621
Where are you going?

1009
01:51:33,931 --> 01:51:36,421
Down the road to Smitty's for Coke.

1010
01:51:36,491 --> 01:51:37,481
With who?

1011
01:51:37,701 --> 01:51:38,661
Nobody.

1012
01:51:39,801 --> 01:51:40,991
Stay at home.

1013
01:51:45,771 --> 01:51:46,761
Hey, you!

1014
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:52,900
Hello, Papa.

1015
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:55,380
Hi.

1016
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,440
Where have you been?

1017
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,310
Down the road for a Coke.

1018
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:00,770
With who?

1019
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:01,870
Bob.

1020
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,390
- Howdy, Mr. Benedict.
- Hello, Bob.

1021
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:14,160
Well, good night, Mr. Benedict.

1022
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,160
Excuse me, Papa.

1023
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:31,849
Look, Papa, are you busy now?

1024
01:52:32,349 --> 01:52:34,649
Never too busy for you, young fellow.

1025
01:52:35,549 --> 01:52:37,279
What's on your mind?

1026
01:52:37,759 --> 01:52:39,879
Well, Daddy, it's like this.

1027
01:52:40,489 --> 01:52:42,429
I am, Mama. I'm going to be.

1028
01:52:43,159 --> 01:52:46,189
I want to go to Harvard
and then to Columbia premed.

1029
01:52:48,069 --> 01:52:49,859
So you want to be a doctor?

1030
01:52:50,669 --> 01:52:51,659
Yes.

1031
01:52:54,909 --> 01:52:58,569
How about Reata, Jordy?
He's counting on you to take over.

1032
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:02,779
Yes, I know he is. I know it.

1033
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,239
But there are 50,000 guys who can do it
better than I can.

1034
01:53:07,919 --> 01:53:10,788
I don't want to live my life
pushing cows around.

1035
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:15,658
I'd die for Papa if I had to.

1036
01:53:16,358 --> 01:53:20,348
Your father doesn't want you to die
for him. He wants you to live for him.

1037
01:53:20,628 --> 01:53:22,598
Talk to her, will you, Daddy?

1038
01:53:23,828 --> 01:53:25,168
Reason with her.

1039
01:53:27,038 --> 01:53:28,698
I don't want this pinned on me.

1040
01:53:28,768 --> 01:53:30,598
I'll take all the blame.

1041
01:53:30,908 --> 01:53:34,038
You just sort of soften the blow a little bit.

1042
01:53:35,208 --> 01:53:36,868
I'll talk to him myself.

1043
01:53:37,048 --> 01:53:39,518
You can persuade him, Mom.
I know you can.

1044
01:53:40,218 --> 01:53:42,208
It's not gonna be easy, honey.

1045
01:53:45,218 --> 01:53:47,378
Maybe I can catch her at a weak moment.

1046
01:53:47,458 --> 01:53:50,427
You can do it, Daddy. I know you can.

1047
01:53:55,967 --> 01:53:58,157
Darling, I've been thinking...

1048
01:53:59,337 --> 01:54:00,457
Me, too.

1049
01:54:03,907 --> 01:54:05,467
About the children.

1050
01:54:06,837 --> 01:54:08,737
That's funny. Me, too.

1051
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:15,777
We must be getting old.

1052
01:54:16,487 --> 01:54:17,947
Speak for yourself.

1053
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:25,757
I wonder if we love them enough
to do what's really right for them.

1054
01:54:26,526 --> 01:54:28,086
Why, sure.

1055
01:54:31,096 --> 01:54:32,296
I hope so.

1056
01:54:34,506 --> 01:54:35,556
I mean...

1057
01:54:36,906 --> 01:54:39,396
so we love them too much perhaps.

1058
01:54:40,376 --> 01:54:44,106
So much that we keep from doing
what's right for them.

1059
01:54:45,476 --> 01:54:46,466
Not me.

1060
01:54:49,416 --> 01:54:51,506
You don't have to worry about me.

1061
01:54:57,896 --> 01:54:59,226
It's always the mother.

1062
01:55:01,526 --> 01:55:05,625
The theory is she doesn't want
her fledglings to leave her nest.

1063
01:55:08,405 --> 01:55:12,395
Try their own wings. All that sort of stuff.

1064
01:55:15,545 --> 01:55:16,765
You mean...

1065
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:21,005
you'd be perfectly willing to sacrifice?

1066
01:55:22,785 --> 01:55:23,775
Yeah.

1067
01:55:25,915 --> 01:55:28,755
I'd sacrifice for her. You know that.

1068
01:55:49,804 --> 01:55:52,674
I'm not so sold on that...

1069
01:55:54,514 --> 01:55:57,534
girl's school in Switzerland
you're stuck on.

1070
01:55:57,754 --> 01:55:59,744
Now, don't get your feathers up.

1071
01:56:00,654 --> 01:56:02,914
Judy's not crazy about that school either.

1072
01:56:02,984 --> 01:56:05,984
Of course she isn't.
That's exactly why she needs to go.

1073
01:56:07,194 --> 01:56:08,824
I wouldn't push her.

1074
01:56:12,264 --> 01:56:13,324
She...

1075
01:56:14,704 --> 01:56:16,694
wants to go to Texas Tech.

1076
01:56:16,834 --> 01:56:18,594
That's a man's school.

1077
01:56:19,204 --> 01:56:20,634
Girls go, too.

1078
01:56:21,504 --> 01:56:25,033
It's got the best animal husbandry course
in the country, she says.

1079
01:56:31,453 --> 01:56:34,183
She wants to be a rancher,
like her old man.

1080
01:56:35,353 --> 01:56:36,823
Like Bob Dace.

1081
01:56:37,623 --> 01:56:42,323
She's just got her little schoolgirl crush
on that hulking Bob Dace.

1082
01:56:43,263 --> 01:56:46,353
She's got her mind set on it.

1083
01:56:47,403 --> 01:56:48,863
That's what she wants.

1084
01:56:50,133 --> 01:56:52,663
And I, for one, am willing to sacrifice.

1085
01:57:20,762 --> 01:57:22,062
What do you say?

1086
01:57:27,272 --> 01:57:30,432
It seems we've hatched
an odd pair of fledglings.

1087
01:57:36,042 --> 01:57:37,372
Brace yourself.

1088
01:57:38,112 --> 01:57:40,171
Jordy wants to be a doctor.

1089
01:57:43,121 --> 01:57:44,111
He wants what?

1090
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:46,451
He wants to be a doctor.
He's absolutely set on it.

1091
01:57:46,521 --> 01:57:49,181
Over my dead body!
You know what he's supposed to do.

1092
01:57:49,261 --> 01:57:50,381
Well, he's not.

1093
01:57:51,461 --> 01:57:55,691
He'd die for you, but he's not gonna
live his life for you. And he's right.

1094
01:57:56,061 --> 01:57:57,791
He'll do as we've all done.

1095
01:57:59,831 --> 01:58:04,171
He wants to go to Harvard first,
then Columbia premed.

1096
01:58:06,571 --> 01:58:08,871
You're pretty handy with those terms.

1097
01:58:10,211 --> 01:58:12,771
I can see who's been cooking this thing up.

1098
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:20,010
Of course...

1099
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:24,020
this would mean a big sacrifice
on your part.

1100
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:45,210
No matter where he goes to school...

1101
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:49,040
he comes right back home and runs Reata.

1102
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,519
I guess you were right about one thing.

1103
01:59:01,159 --> 01:59:02,319
Me?

1104
01:59:03,229 --> 01:59:04,419
On one thing.

1105
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:08,659
We are getting old.

1106
01:59:09,999 --> 01:59:10,989
Who?

1107
01:59:11,409 --> 01:59:12,669
We are, Jordan.

1108
01:59:15,839 --> 01:59:17,809
We are the older generation.

1109
01:59:19,909 --> 01:59:21,039
Aren't we?

1110
01:59:22,119 --> 01:59:23,239
Suddenly?

1111
01:59:31,529 --> 01:59:32,859
I guess so.

1112
01:59:46,408 --> 01:59:49,398
"...unless oil or gas shall have been struck
at a lesser depth."

1113
01:59:49,478 --> 01:59:51,808
Is that about Vashti Hake's ranch?

1114
01:59:54,078 --> 01:59:54,838
Yes.

1115
01:59:56,848 --> 01:59:57,838
Good.

1116
01:59:58,848 --> 01:59:59,938
How about Reata?

1117
02:00:00,788 --> 02:00:04,118
No. That Benedict is a hard guy to crack.

1118
02:00:11,898 --> 02:00:14,198
Let's just keep punching, boys.

1119
02:00:48,697 --> 02:00:49,787
Hospital!

1120
02:00:50,237 --> 02:00:51,827
What's he covering up now?

1121
02:00:52,637 --> 02:00:55,796
He'll overstep the mark one of these days.

1122
02:00:56,176 --> 02:00:57,436
Give him enough rope.

1123
02:00:58,306 --> 02:01:00,796
Give him enough rope, and he'll hang you.

1124
02:01:02,746 --> 02:01:03,736
I'll get it.

1125
02:01:08,216 --> 02:01:09,376
Hello.

1126
02:01:12,756 --> 02:01:14,556
No, this is her daughter.

1127
02:01:19,866 --> 02:01:22,356
You'll have to find out for yourself.

1128
02:01:23,396 --> 02:01:26,396
- Take your social life on the other phone.
- It's for you.

1129
02:01:26,636 --> 02:01:28,066
I think he's nice.

1130
02:01:28,136 --> 02:01:29,766
- Who's nice?
- Jett Rink.

1131
02:01:32,575 --> 02:01:34,005
I don't want to talk to him.

1132
02:01:34,075 --> 02:01:35,445
What do I tell him?

1133
02:01:36,075 --> 02:01:38,745
Let me talk. I'll tell him.

1134
02:01:39,315 --> 02:01:40,675
I'll talk to him.

1135
02:01:47,425 --> 02:01:49,895
You've heard from me before on this, Jett.

1136
02:01:50,255 --> 02:01:52,725
Judge Whiteside told you, and I told you.

1137
02:01:52,865 --> 02:01:56,995
This is a cattle ranch, not an oil field.
That's the way it's gonna stay.

1138
02:01:59,905 --> 02:02:02,925
That's about the most expensive
phone call you ever made, Bick.

1139
02:02:03,005 --> 02:02:06,135
It'll cost you a billion dollars a year
for the next 50 years.

1140
02:02:06,205 --> 02:02:10,644
Couldn't we have just one little, itty-bitty
oil well, so I can get a private phone?

1141
02:02:27,864 --> 02:02:32,354
<i>After reporting to President Roosevelt,</i>
<i>the Naval Secretary told the press...</i>

1142
02:02:32,434 --> 02:02:36,494
<i>that the battleship Arizona</i>
<i>and five other warships were lost...</i>

1143
02:02:36,574 --> 02:02:41,374
<i>in the Japanese air raid</i>
<i>on Pearl Harbor a fortnight ago.</i>

1144
02:02:42,344 --> 02:02:44,504
<i>He reported that 91 officers...</i>

1145
02:02:45,014 --> 02:02:49,213
<i>and 2,638 enlisted men were known dead.</i>

1146
02:02:55,623 --> 02:02:58,453
That only makes me realize I'm losing you.

1147
02:04:23,171 --> 02:04:24,661
Here they are.

1148
02:04:27,641 --> 02:04:29,481
When did you two sneak in?

1149
02:04:29,681 --> 02:04:31,341
The honeymooners!

1150
02:04:37,451 --> 02:04:40,421
Judy, you're gonna get it.
You know Mom wanted a big wedding.

1151
02:04:40,521 --> 02:04:42,361
That's not true, Luz.

1152
02:04:44,631 --> 02:04:46,120
Not quite true.

1153
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:23,260
We came for you to see Ángel.

1154
02:05:24,499 --> 02:05:26,989
He's the first soldier from Reata.

1155
02:05:27,339 --> 02:05:30,169
- Merry Christmas, Polo.
- Merry Christmas.

1156
02:05:34,879 --> 02:05:37,209
Isn't he a fine-looking soldier?

1157
02:05:38,779 --> 02:05:40,269
Just a minute.

1158
02:05:45,219 --> 02:05:47,189
Merry Christmas, Ángel.

1159
02:05:47,259 --> 02:05:48,319
Thank you.

1160
02:05:48,489 --> 02:05:52,329
Today the wish of all of us is
that the war ends quickly...

1161
02:05:53,099 --> 02:05:56,429
and that you, Ángel,
return safely to Reata...

1162
02:05:57,999 --> 02:06:00,989
and to all of those
who love you very much.

1163
02:06:01,369 --> 02:06:03,528
I'll drink a toast to that.

1164
02:06:05,708 --> 02:06:07,698
Come on, now, and open it.

1165
02:06:35,438 --> 02:06:38,098
- Hello, Dr. Guerra.
- Hello, Dr. Benedict.

1166
02:06:38,738 --> 02:06:40,708
Just a little premature.

1167
02:06:40,778 --> 02:06:42,107
I know, it takes time.

1168
02:06:42,847 --> 02:06:44,707
Jordan, this is Juana.

1169
02:06:46,077 --> 02:06:48,747
She's been training out at the hospital.

1170
02:06:51,887 --> 02:06:54,547
It must be that darn north wind static.

1171
02:06:56,427 --> 02:07:01,327
Don't tell me you haven't learned that
dry wind, friction, and a heavy carpet...

1172
02:07:01,767 --> 02:07:05,457
are not the only means of creating
electricity between human beings.

1173
02:07:20,516 --> 02:07:21,576
Thank you.

1174
02:07:27,186 --> 02:07:30,276
Could you stay and give me the lowdown
on what it's like?

1175
02:07:38,396 --> 02:07:40,796
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

1176
02:07:41,266 --> 02:07:43,096
- Goodbye.
- <i>Adiós.</i>

1177
02:07:45,606 --> 02:07:49,166
- Let's get some Christmas cheer.
- You talked me into it!

1178
02:07:57,486 --> 02:08:00,975
Friends, we're gonna have
a mighty triumphant Christmas.

1179
02:08:03,155 --> 02:08:06,315
I'm gonna drink a toast
to two young men of Reata.

1180
02:08:08,265 --> 02:08:09,385
My two sons.

1181
02:08:18,135 --> 02:08:20,005
Thank you, Mr. Benedict.

1182
02:08:25,245 --> 02:08:27,905
Better take it easy on the bourbon, Dad.

1183
02:08:28,845 --> 02:08:30,405
It's not good for you.

1184
02:08:31,555 --> 02:08:33,045
I'm not kidding you.

1185
02:08:38,954 --> 02:08:40,944
I hate to see Ángel go.

1186
02:08:41,424 --> 02:08:44,754
That boy is the best dang man
on the place.

1187
02:08:50,234 --> 02:08:54,964
It's time for you to take your place here,
to produce beef for the war.

1188
02:08:55,944 --> 02:08:59,274
They need doctors, Dad.
They need doctors in war, too.

1189
02:09:01,074 --> 02:09:03,574
I want to finish medical school if I can.

1190
02:09:04,484 --> 02:09:06,174
You are being bull-headed.

1191
02:09:07,754 --> 02:09:10,584
I never would be any good
at running this place.

1192
02:09:12,494 --> 02:09:14,654
Any man on Reata can do it better.

1193
02:09:14,864 --> 02:09:16,483
You're the one.

1194
02:09:17,893 --> 02:09:20,383
You're the one with a responsibility
to Reata.

1195
02:09:20,463 --> 02:09:23,523
Your blood pressure is going up
just while we're talking here.

1196
02:09:24,933 --> 02:09:27,463
Please, it isn't good for you. Just relax.

1197
02:09:27,533 --> 02:09:29,533
Don't you get fresh with me.

1198
02:09:36,283 --> 02:09:37,773
We're talking.

1199
02:09:38,113 --> 02:09:39,603
Yes, I heard.

1200
02:09:40,613 --> 02:09:45,113
It's Christmas morning. Isn't this
something you could discuss tomorrow?

1201
02:09:46,693 --> 02:09:48,683
There's nothing to discuss.

1202
02:09:48,993 --> 02:09:52,483
When I come home,
I'll work with Dr. Guerra in Vientecito.

1203
02:09:55,402 --> 02:09:58,732
I love Texas as much as you do.
I want to work here.

1204
02:09:59,672 --> 02:10:02,762
I just want to work in a different way,
that's all.

1205
02:10:04,402 --> 02:10:05,672
Come on, Jordan.

1206
02:10:07,672 --> 02:10:09,202
Work with Guerra!

1207
02:10:21,562 --> 02:10:23,282
Here's to you, Mr. Benedict.

1208
02:10:28,202 --> 02:10:30,252
You look beat, Mr. Benedict.

1209
02:10:30,332 --> 02:10:31,352
Here's to you.

1210
02:10:31,432 --> 02:10:33,192
It's pretty good stuff.

1211
02:10:33,901 --> 02:10:35,731
Did you make that yourself?

1212
02:10:37,441 --> 02:10:39,431
Yes, I make it every year.

1213
02:10:41,041 --> 02:10:43,031
It's my Christmas special.

1214
02:10:43,541 --> 02:10:45,411
No, I mean the liquor.

1215
02:10:45,751 --> 02:10:47,741
Did you make the liquor yourself?

1216
02:10:48,181 --> 02:10:52,141
If not, it's about the only thing
you don't produce on Reata yourself.

1217
02:10:56,921 --> 02:10:58,581
Come here and sit down.

1218
02:10:59,261 --> 02:11:01,251
I've got some serious talk
to make with you.

1219
02:11:08,741 --> 02:11:12,230
I've been watching you pretty close
for a lot of years.

1220
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:18,640
You're a ranchman.

1221
02:11:20,410 --> 02:11:22,040
And you're smart.

1222
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:33,920
You're wondering why I'm talking to you.

1223
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:42,960
Bob Dace...

1224
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:45,630
Look me right in the eye.

1225
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:54,139
You could never be anything but a rancher,
could you?

1226
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:56,139
- No, sir.
- That's my boy.

1227
02:11:56,279 --> 02:11:58,749
But somebody else thinks I could.

1228
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:01,709
Not my Judy.

1229
02:12:01,789 --> 02:12:03,419
- No, sir, it's not Judy.
- Who?

1230
02:12:04,559 --> 02:12:06,289
President Roosevelt.

1231
02:12:09,329 --> 02:12:10,819
Listen to this:

1232
02:12:15,339 --> 02:12:17,499
"To Robert Haskell Dace.

1233
02:12:18,469 --> 02:12:22,569
"Greetings from the President
of the United States."

1234
02:12:22,779 --> 02:12:24,109
Let me see that.

1235
02:12:26,809 --> 02:12:30,938
"You are hereby notified to report
on December 28...

1236
02:12:31,248 --> 02:12:33,278
"5:00 a.m. For induction."

1237
02:12:39,228 --> 02:12:40,718
It don't matter.

1238
02:12:42,198 --> 02:12:44,688
Your job won't let you leave this place.

1239
02:12:44,998 --> 02:12:48,588
It'll make you stay right here.
This is just as important as carrying a gun.

1240
02:12:48,668 --> 02:12:50,968
I appreciate your confidence, sir.

1241
02:12:51,868 --> 02:12:55,328
But this is one thing
I'm not gonna try to get out of.

1242
02:12:59,048 --> 02:13:01,308
Have it your way. You might as well...

1243
02:13:02,078 --> 02:13:04,378
everybody else does around here.

1244
02:13:06,788 --> 02:13:10,237
I'll show you my heart's in the right place.

1245
02:13:11,117 --> 02:13:14,057
When you come back
after the war is over...

1246
02:13:14,887 --> 02:13:16,357
the job's yours.

1247
02:13:16,527 --> 02:13:18,517
It'll be waiting for you.

1248
02:13:20,427 --> 02:13:22,027
I couldn't take it, sir.

1249
02:13:22,137 --> 02:13:24,257
Papa, Bob and I have plans.

1250
02:13:26,437 --> 02:13:28,767
We want a place, just our own.

1251
02:13:31,807 --> 02:13:33,637
You crazy kids, you!

1252
02:13:35,947 --> 02:13:39,387
Can you imagine you'll ever have
anything like this? Like Reata?

1253
02:13:39,447 --> 02:13:42,317
Gosh, no, sir. We just want a little place.

1254
02:13:42,417 --> 02:13:46,946
Just a little place that'll allow us time
for experimentation and progress.

1255
02:13:47,056 --> 02:13:50,256
See, sir, big stuff is old stuff now.

1256
02:13:50,656 --> 02:13:52,646
Big stuff is old stuff?

1257
02:13:52,766 --> 02:13:57,226
Bob didn't mean to upset you.
He just wants to be honest, that's all.

1258
02:13:58,296 --> 02:14:02,136
We just want something little
that's our own. That's all.

1259
02:14:03,136 --> 02:14:04,606
Just ours.

1260
02:14:05,476 --> 02:14:06,966
You see, Dad?

1261
02:14:08,546 --> 02:14:10,706
Yeah, honey, I see.

1262
02:14:14,046 --> 02:14:15,536
See you, Daddy.

1263
02:14:27,665 --> 02:14:30,395
Keeping it together all my life for them!

1264
02:14:31,135 --> 02:14:34,295
I battled mesquite, dust, and the wind...

1265
02:14:35,065 --> 02:14:36,665
to keep it this big.

1266
02:14:37,675 --> 02:14:39,035
And for who?

1267
02:14:40,075 --> 02:14:43,405
I might just as well give it back
to the dirty Comanches!

1268
02:14:43,745 --> 02:14:45,235
That's the Christmas spirit.

1269
02:14:45,315 --> 02:14:47,785
Give it all back to the poor old Indians.

1270
02:14:53,425 --> 02:14:56,485
Don't tell me, I know. You're Jett Rink.

1271
02:14:59,825 --> 02:15:01,095
You're Judy.

1272
02:15:01,165 --> 02:15:02,495
No, I'm Luz.

1273
02:15:06,834 --> 02:15:07,964
That I am.

1274
02:15:08,064 --> 02:15:09,404
Come on in.

1275
02:15:16,574 --> 02:15:18,564
Dad's over at the bar.

1276
02:15:20,144 --> 02:15:22,984
Feel free, it's Christmas.
Everybody gets one.

1277
02:15:25,424 --> 02:15:26,754
Christmas?

1278
02:15:27,954 --> 02:15:31,754
I thought that was next week.
Somebody ought to have told me.

1279
02:15:33,664 --> 02:15:36,634
Christmas greetings
from Mr. Jetexas himself.

1280
02:15:50,373 --> 02:15:51,473
Sit down.

1281
02:15:57,183 --> 02:16:00,843
I guess Christmas is as good a day as any
to talk business.

1282
02:16:03,993 --> 02:16:05,253
Run along, Luz.

1283
02:16:06,393 --> 02:16:08,553
We've got business to talk about.

1284
02:16:08,663 --> 02:16:09,783
'Bye, now.

1285
02:16:12,133 --> 02:16:13,623
'Bye, Mr. Rink.

1286
02:16:15,473 --> 02:16:17,803
Everybody calls me Jett, honey.

1287
02:16:24,772 --> 02:16:25,972
Bye-bye.

1288
02:16:35,022 --> 02:16:36,582
What's on your mind?

1289
02:16:36,652 --> 02:16:38,812
The country needs petroleum.

1290
02:16:39,662 --> 02:16:41,892
I'm going to Washington, Bick.

1291
02:16:42,432 --> 02:16:45,452
The reason I'm going
and the reason I'm here is oil.

1292
02:16:47,702 --> 02:16:49,032
I figured.

1293
02:16:50,602 --> 02:16:52,592
You want to talk a little business?

1294
02:16:53,242 --> 02:16:54,572
I'm ready.

1295
02:16:55,742 --> 02:16:59,072
It seems that every time we made a deal,
me and you...

1296
02:17:02,611 --> 02:17:05,011
it just turned out pretty lucky...

1297
02:17:06,321 --> 02:17:07,651
for somebody.

1298
02:17:43,350 --> 02:17:47,120
All this oil around here hasn't made
a lot of difference.

1299
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:51,150
We live pretty much like we always have
here in Reata.

1300
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:54,250
Just like we Benedicts found it.

1301
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:00,360
The Lord was good to you, to set
the swimming pool in your own front yard.

1302
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:05,300
Hey, come on in.

1303
02:18:06,210 --> 02:18:07,700
Not now, Luz.

1304
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:15,320
It's good for the young folks.

1305
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:19,439
We'd have made improvements
around here, oil or no oil.

1306
02:18:20,219 --> 02:18:24,059
But that 27.5 percent tax exemption
on oil helped, didn't it?

1307
02:18:26,459 --> 02:18:28,989
Bale, I'll tell you what old Pinky thinks.

1308
02:18:29,099 --> 02:18:29,829
What?

1309
02:18:29,899 --> 02:18:34,359
That oil tax exemption is the best thing
to hit Texas since we whooped Geronimo.

1310
02:18:42,809 --> 02:18:45,979
One of the finest laws ever passed
in Washington.

1311
02:18:46,979 --> 02:18:49,349
And all joking aside, Bick...

1312
02:18:49,749 --> 02:18:52,849
we're not adverse to accepting
a share of the credit for it.

1313
02:18:52,919 --> 02:18:54,219
Not at all.

1314
02:18:54,759 --> 02:18:59,088
How about an exemption for depreciation
of first-class brains, Senator?

1315
02:18:59,328 --> 02:19:00,818
Whose? Yours?

1316
02:19:01,358 --> 02:19:05,858
My father's, for instance. He spent his life
saving other people's lives.

1317
02:19:06,838 --> 02:19:09,328
How about some tax exemption there?

1318
02:19:14,738 --> 02:19:18,198
Leslie has always been a real sharp talker,
ain't she?

1319
02:19:18,648 --> 02:19:22,478
Fair enough, Judge. You've always been
smooth enough for two.

1320
02:19:24,188 --> 02:19:27,588
"Do you take each other
for better or for worse...

1321
02:19:28,758 --> 02:19:30,918
"for richer or for poorer...

1322
02:19:31,758 --> 02:19:34,748
"in sickness and in health, until death?

1323
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:42,197
"Jordan Benedict, wilt thou take...

1324
02:19:42,837 --> 02:19:44,857
"Juana Villalobos here present...

1325
02:19:45,777 --> 02:19:50,367
"for your lawful wife, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1326
02:19:51,847 --> 02:19:52,837
I will.

1327
02:19:54,117 --> 02:19:57,247
"Juana Villalobos, wilt thou take...

1328
02:19:58,247 --> 02:20:00,517
"Jordan Benedict here present...

1329
02:20:00,617 --> 02:20:05,357
"for your lawful husband, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1330
02:20:07,257 --> 02:20:08,247
I will.

1331
02:20:09,327 --> 02:20:11,627
Join your hands and kneel down.

1332
02:22:17,623 --> 02:22:19,283
What did they say?

1333
02:22:25,093 --> 02:22:26,793
<i>Friends and neighbors...</i>

1334
02:22:28,133 --> 02:22:30,123
<i>I want you all to meet my wife.</i>

1335
02:22:31,863 --> 02:22:33,533
<i>Mrs. Jordan Benedict III.</i>

1336
02:22:35,373 --> 02:22:36,493
Congratulations!

1337
02:23:54,281 --> 02:23:57,111
He was the first Reata baby I ever saw.

1338
02:23:58,881 --> 02:24:01,411
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

1339
02:24:03,961 --> 02:24:05,451
He had a fever.

1340
02:24:07,290 --> 02:24:10,460
I didn't think he was going
to live the day out.

1341
02:25:13,859 --> 02:25:18,849
On behalf of the U.S. Army, I am proud
to present to you the flag of our nation...

1342
02:25:19,369 --> 02:25:22,199
which your son defended so gallantly.

1343
02:27:39,335 --> 02:27:41,825
Everyone in the world's gonna be there.

1344
02:27:42,905 --> 02:27:45,895
I'm gonna fly up to Dallas,
and I'm going to Neiman's.

1345
02:27:46,275 --> 02:27:50,075
I'll buy myself
a starlight-white evening dress.

1346
02:27:50,685 --> 02:27:53,675
Very plain and simple and deadly.

1347
02:27:54,915 --> 02:27:57,045
Before you get so elaborate and simple...

1348
02:27:57,125 --> 02:27:59,584
you'd better hear
what your father has to say.

1349
02:27:59,694 --> 02:28:02,024
We're certainly going. I promised Jett.

1350
02:28:03,264 --> 02:28:06,324
Jett! What are you talking about?

1351
02:28:06,934 --> 02:28:11,524
He likes me. He likes my family, too.
He's always talking about you.

1352
02:28:13,474 --> 02:28:15,464
My dear, darling Luz...

1353
02:28:15,934 --> 02:28:20,004
if I didn't know you had a level Benedict
head on those immature shoulders...

1354
02:28:20,074 --> 02:28:22,274
I'd prescribe a good spanking.

1355
02:28:22,574 --> 02:28:25,634
He's dreamy. Ask the Snythe girls.

1356
02:28:25,944 --> 02:28:27,174
Ask anyone.

1357
02:28:27,314 --> 02:28:29,304
He's just a rough diamond.

1358
02:28:29,424 --> 02:28:33,684
He's a rough rhinestone.
He's old enough to be your father.

1359
02:28:35,394 --> 02:28:37,553
What are you six evil men up to now?

1360
02:28:37,623 --> 02:28:40,183
Honey, it's a coronation.

1361
02:28:40,833 --> 02:28:43,123
Jett plans to get himself crowned king.

1362
02:28:43,203 --> 02:28:45,693
You got to have $10 million
to be on the guest list.

1363
02:28:45,763 --> 02:28:48,563
The most important people
in the country will be there.

1364
02:28:48,633 --> 02:28:50,363
Coast-to-coast broadcast.

1365
02:28:50,443 --> 02:28:52,603
Jett's gonna make a magnificent speech.

1366
02:28:52,673 --> 02:28:53,663
I know.

1367
02:28:54,643 --> 02:28:56,633
I'm going to write it for him.

1368
02:28:56,713 --> 02:28:58,943
It'll be heard across the nation
by everyone.

1369
02:28:59,013 --> 02:29:02,003
Eliminating one. That's me.

1370
02:29:03,823 --> 02:29:08,313
If you people stay away, Leslie, you'll be
the only folks in Texas who ain't there.

1371
02:29:08,393 --> 02:29:10,383
You'll be roped in with the herd.

1372
02:29:10,463 --> 02:29:14,763
You'll be putting on your pink shoes and
dancing to Jett's fiddles like the rest of us.

1373
02:29:14,833 --> 02:29:17,132
If we go then we'll do it right.

1374
02:29:17,202 --> 02:29:22,032
We're oil rich, like the rest of them.
We'll go like the rest of them! Only better.

1375
02:29:22,102 --> 02:29:23,902
Now you're talking like my father.

1376
02:29:23,972 --> 02:29:25,602
The old Benedict spirit.

1377
02:29:25,672 --> 02:29:27,902
You set up one of your great weekends.

1378
02:29:27,972 --> 02:29:30,242
Invite everybody.
We'll take them all with us.

1379
02:29:30,312 --> 02:29:33,642
We'll show that so-and-so
who's top people around here.

1380
02:29:33,912 --> 02:29:36,072
I'll even buy the four-engine Douglas.

1381
02:29:36,382 --> 02:29:38,712
Fly in some orchids from Hawaii.

1382
02:29:40,352 --> 02:29:43,952
We'll fly in low and shake the tiles
off that hotel roof.

1383
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:46,540
There's Lola Lane!

1384
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:48,950
I bet even Hollywood isn't this exciting.

1385
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:51,550
- Isn't this something?
- It's perfectly fabulous!

1386
02:30:51,620 --> 02:30:54,110
Jett always tries to do things
in a bigger way...

1387
02:30:54,190 --> 02:30:56,320
and spend more money than anybody else.

1388
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:57,920
Really? What does he do?

1389
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:01,260
To some folks, he's just
a no-good wildcatting so-and-so.

1390
02:31:20,349 --> 02:31:21,339
There he is.

1391
02:31:28,289 --> 02:31:30,279
There's the emperor himself.

1392
02:31:38,139 --> 02:31:41,589
Isn't this terrific?
Look at Luz, she's queen of the parade.

1393
02:31:42,209 --> 02:31:43,939
You didn't tell me.

1394
02:31:48,379 --> 02:31:50,368
Did you know about this, Leslie?

1395
02:31:52,278 --> 02:31:53,268
No, I didn't.

1396
02:31:59,828 --> 02:32:03,318
My daughter, queen of Jett Rink Day!
What is this?

1397
02:32:04,828 --> 02:32:06,488
I don't know, Jordan.

1398
02:32:07,898 --> 02:32:10,958
She's done things before I haven't
gone along with, but this...

1399
02:32:11,038 --> 02:32:12,938
She's never been sneaky.

1400
02:32:13,108 --> 02:32:16,268
It's not exactly sneaky,
appearing in a parade.

1401
02:32:16,378 --> 02:32:17,928
Don't try to be funny.

1402
02:32:18,338 --> 02:32:21,038
I'm not. I'm just as upset as you are.

1403
02:32:22,078 --> 02:32:25,908
But Luz is intelligent enough
not to be imposed on by him or anyone.

1404
02:32:26,148 --> 02:32:27,478
Give me the desk.

1405
02:32:28,488 --> 02:32:29,647
It's Bick Benedict.

1406
02:32:29,717 --> 02:32:32,207
Did my daughter
Luz Benedict come in yet?

1407
02:32:32,927 --> 02:32:35,827
Get this. As soon as she comes in,
have her call me.

1408
02:33:14,226 --> 02:33:16,386
You know what I think I'll do?

1409
02:33:18,836 --> 02:33:21,326
I'm going to keep it just like this.

1410
02:33:23,906 --> 02:33:26,706
I'll keep all those people, send them home.

1411
02:33:29,716 --> 02:33:31,676
I'm not even gonna open up this place.

1412
02:33:34,986 --> 02:33:38,146
Some girls might like a hotel
all to themselves.

1413
02:33:39,216 --> 02:33:42,186
Me, I like company, Jett.
I like lots of people.

1414
02:33:44,926 --> 02:33:46,115
All right.

1415
02:33:47,465 --> 02:33:51,155
You want lots of people?
I don't see any problem there.

1416
02:33:55,935 --> 02:34:00,235
If there's anything you want,
just say it, and you've got it.

1417
02:34:04,015 --> 02:34:06,205
All right, I'd like a Coke.

1418
02:34:10,285 --> 02:34:13,345
No, that's impossible.
That's just impossible.

1419
02:34:14,255 --> 02:34:18,085
You know as well as I do, Cokes are taboo.
All soft drinks.

1420
02:34:20,965 --> 02:34:22,555
You make the rules.

1421
02:34:27,964 --> 02:34:30,634
You like things your own way, don't you?

1422
02:34:31,674 --> 02:34:33,664
Let me ask you something.

1423
02:34:34,774 --> 02:34:39,264
Do you like things your way?
Not many people have things their way.

1424
02:34:40,544 --> 02:34:43,204
No, I don't get them my way very often.

1425
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:50,414
And you won't either,
until you get married...

1426
02:34:53,064 --> 02:34:55,924
and get your man
to give you what you want.

1427
02:34:55,994 --> 02:34:56,984
So?

1428
02:34:58,364 --> 02:35:01,694
So if I was you,
I'd start thinking about getting married.

1429
02:35:03,034 --> 02:35:04,903
You know, that's an idea.

1430
02:35:12,343 --> 02:35:15,173
You looked like a queen
in that parade today.

1431
02:35:16,283 --> 02:35:17,803
That was my job.

1432
02:35:28,693 --> 02:35:30,523
It's just what you are.

1433
02:35:31,233 --> 02:35:33,193
Luz Benedict II.

1434
02:35:35,763 --> 02:35:39,723
You could be the head lady
of this part of the whole country...

1435
02:35:40,873 --> 02:35:44,072
if you wanted to.
If you married the right man.

1436
02:35:45,612 --> 02:35:47,102
That's a sweet idea.

1437
02:35:49,542 --> 02:35:52,212
Why don't I just announce it tonight...

1438
02:35:52,482 --> 02:35:55,642
with all them thousands
of people listening?

1439
02:35:58,152 --> 02:35:59,622
The whole of Texas.

1440
02:36:01,992 --> 02:36:04,322
Wouldn't that blow the roof off?

1441
02:36:09,102 --> 02:36:11,092
Jett, tell me something.

1442
02:36:15,442 --> 02:36:16,962
Is this a proposal?

1443
02:36:17,042 --> 02:36:18,702
Does it sound like one?

1444
02:36:21,581 --> 02:36:23,911
After a fashion, but not quite.

1445
02:36:27,981 --> 02:36:30,981
You want me to say something
you can laugh at?

1446
02:36:33,421 --> 02:36:34,411
No.

1447
02:36:37,631 --> 02:36:40,291
I just think you're a wonderful girl.

1448
02:36:41,761 --> 02:36:44,231
And I do think you're beautiful.

1449
02:36:48,141 --> 02:36:52,201
You're fascinating to me.
I've always been looking for...

1450
02:36:53,041 --> 02:36:54,511
a girl like you.

1451
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:09,490
Sure would blow the roof off, wouldn't it?

1452
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:16,130
You've got a long way to go tonight.

1453
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:24,330
I'm very flattered. Any girl would be.

1454
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:32,210
You be a good boy now.

1455
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:35,320
I'll see you later.

1456
02:38:39,908 --> 02:38:42,878
I hope this storm doesn't louse up
your party.

1457
02:38:42,948 --> 02:38:46,908
A slip-up, boy. I just forgot
to order the right kind of weather!

1458
02:38:47,418 --> 02:38:48,818
I heard a twister hit Waco.

1459
02:39:07,177 --> 02:39:09,837
What's wrong with you?
Can't you talk United States?

1460
02:39:09,937 --> 02:39:11,427
You're talking to my wife.

1461
02:39:12,107 --> 02:39:15,447
I'm Jordan Benedict,
if that means anything to you.

1462
02:39:15,847 --> 02:39:17,817
I'm just following orders.

1463
02:39:18,147 --> 02:39:21,377
Mr. Rink said he'd have my neck
if I let any of the wrong people in.

1464
02:39:29,657 --> 02:39:33,027
You Benedicts are all close together.
They've got the Coronado suite.

1465
02:39:33,097 --> 02:39:34,586
You're in the Filando suite.

1466
02:39:34,666 --> 02:39:37,466
I'm a mess. I must go to the beauty parlor.

1467
02:39:37,536 --> 02:39:39,526
Hurry before they close.

1468
02:39:39,836 --> 02:39:44,006
<i>Grand opening of the Jett Rink Airport</i>
<i>and Emperador Hotel...</i>

1469
02:39:44,476 --> 02:39:48,636
<i>is the latest milestone in the dramatic</i>
<i>life of this virile son of Texas.</i>

1470
02:39:51,386 --> 02:39:52,506
Howdy, everybody!

1471
02:39:56,216 --> 02:39:58,446
- It's time you got here.
- Where are the boys?

1472
02:39:58,526 --> 02:40:00,116
Where's Pinky, the old bat?

1473
02:40:01,056 --> 02:40:03,046
Filando suite for Mr. Benedict, please.

1474
02:40:03,996 --> 02:40:05,296
<i>Beauty salon.</i>

1475
02:40:05,366 --> 02:40:06,696
Can you take me?

1476
02:40:07,836 --> 02:40:09,796
<i>Yes, if you can come right along.</i>

1477
02:40:09,866 --> 02:40:11,956
Thank goodness. I'll be right in.

1478
02:40:12,036 --> 02:40:14,295
- <i>Who</i>'<i>s calling, please?</i>
- Mrs. Benedict.

1479
02:40:14,675 --> 02:40:16,665
<i>Come on along, Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1480
02:40:16,745 --> 02:40:17,795
Thank you.

1481
02:40:20,245 --> 02:40:22,875
Keep everybody freshened up, will you?
We'll be quick.

1482
02:40:22,945 --> 02:40:26,405
We're anxious to see old Jett
come out in that suit.

1483
02:40:29,515 --> 02:40:33,045
Why couldn't they ride with us
like other people's kids do?

1484
02:40:33,125 --> 02:40:36,785
Luz had to fly her own plane
and Jordy and Juana had to drive.

1485
02:41:00,354 --> 02:41:01,844
Is anybody here?

1486
02:41:06,254 --> 02:41:07,844
We're all booked up.

1487
02:41:07,924 --> 02:41:10,414
I just called. I'm Mrs. Benedict.

1488
02:41:12,224 --> 02:41:14,214
I'm sorry, but we're busy.

1489
02:41:15,394 --> 02:41:17,224
I'll wait a little.

1490
02:41:25,004 --> 02:41:27,874
They're driving. It takes time.

1491
02:41:28,014 --> 02:41:29,974
I know it takes time.

1492
02:41:30,943 --> 02:41:33,043
I made the trip myself 400 times.

1493
02:41:36,253 --> 02:41:38,413
But don't worry about the children.

1494
02:41:38,523 --> 02:41:41,513
Their behavior is odd,
but their manners are beautiful.

1495
02:41:41,593 --> 02:41:43,083
Listen here, boy!

1496
02:41:43,193 --> 02:41:45,123
I've taken enough from you!

1497
02:41:45,293 --> 02:41:47,193
I didn't want to come here!

1498
02:41:47,263 --> 02:41:50,193
I wouldn't be here unless you let them
bully you into it.

1499
02:41:50,263 --> 02:41:52,753
Now, for heaven's sake,
let's make the best of it.

1500
02:41:52,833 --> 02:41:57,103
Cool down, go on with your shaving, finish
dressing, and I'll go downstairs with you!

1501
02:41:57,203 --> 02:41:59,263
Otherwise, you can go alone!

1502
02:42:00,773 --> 02:42:02,103
You know, honey...

1503
02:42:03,483 --> 02:42:05,913
you're awful cute when you get riled.

1504
02:42:13,892 --> 02:42:17,552
Hurry on in there.
Your ma and pa are sure having a battle.

1505
02:42:21,762 --> 02:42:22,822
Hello, honey.

1506
02:42:22,892 --> 02:42:24,232
Where have you been?

1507
02:42:24,332 --> 02:42:26,162
We got tied up in traffic.

1508
02:42:26,232 --> 02:42:27,322
Where's Juana?

1509
02:42:27,402 --> 02:42:29,732
She's in the beauty parlor.

1510
02:42:31,072 --> 02:42:33,262
Hello, sweetheart.

1511
02:42:34,272 --> 02:42:36,602
He's all right. He just didn't get his nap.

1512
02:42:38,342 --> 02:42:40,372
How's my child?

1513
02:42:41,482 --> 02:42:43,542
Is that Judy crying?

1514
02:43:04,171 --> 02:43:05,571
I hope I'm not too late.

1515
02:43:05,641 --> 02:43:07,131
No. Come right in.

1516
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:31,790
Yeah?

1517
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:33,630
Hello, Juana.

1518
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:36,390
Yeah, he's here. Jordy, it's for you.

1519
02:43:41,810 --> 02:43:43,000
Yes, dear?

1520
02:43:47,310 --> 02:43:50,150
Stay right there, honey.
I'm coming right down.

1521
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:57,450
Don't you folks wait on us, we'll catch up.

1522
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:00,450
Son, you're way behind.

1523
02:44:03,560 --> 02:44:06,049
Howdy, everybody, look what we found.

1524
02:44:12,839 --> 02:44:14,169
There you are.

1525
02:44:15,369 --> 02:44:17,069
We were getting worried.

1526
02:44:17,879 --> 02:44:19,999
You'd better get dressed, Jett.

1527
02:44:22,249 --> 02:44:25,239
You wanted me to go over
the speech with you, too.

1528
02:44:25,949 --> 02:44:27,779
Come on, we'd better hurry.

1529
02:44:30,249 --> 02:44:33,749
I'm sorry, but it happens to be
Mr. Jett Rink's orders, himself.

1530
02:44:34,159 --> 02:44:35,649
I'm just working here.

1531
02:44:35,959 --> 02:44:38,449
Everybody's orders. Same all over town.

1532
02:44:38,759 --> 02:44:42,599
The young lady should have gone
to a place where they do her people.

1533
02:44:56,108 --> 02:44:58,448
If it isn't the queen herself!

1534
02:44:59,048 --> 02:45:00,848
- Are you having fun?
- We're making out.

1535
02:45:00,918 --> 02:45:02,908
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1536
02:45:03,488 --> 02:45:05,318
Where are Mom and Dad?

1537
02:45:05,618 --> 02:45:07,278
Don't trifle with your luck.

1538
02:45:09,058 --> 02:45:10,218
There you are.

1539
02:45:10,828 --> 02:45:12,988
You wanted to talk to me, Dad?

1540
02:45:13,598 --> 02:45:16,968
If you can spare me a moment,
I'd like to talk to you, young lady.

1541
02:45:17,038 --> 02:45:18,368
Dad, must we now?

1542
02:45:18,568 --> 02:45:21,728
Jordan, we must hurry to be in time
for the grand entrance.

1543
02:45:21,808 --> 02:45:24,467
Luz, darling, you look just beautiful!

1544
02:45:25,507 --> 02:45:28,667
Help me round everybody up.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1545
02:45:29,047 --> 02:45:30,877
All right, people...

1546
02:46:10,716 --> 02:46:12,916
Did some of you boys change this around?

1547
02:46:14,226 --> 02:46:18,056
We haven't changed a single comma.
Changes tend to throw you.

1548
02:46:19,056 --> 02:46:23,396
"Columbus discovered only the shell
of this country. Agassiz came..."

1549
02:46:30,576 --> 02:46:31,966
Where's Rink?

1550
02:46:32,176 --> 02:46:33,836
He went thataway.

1551
02:46:48,855 --> 02:46:51,515
Looks like I just come in for a root beer.

1552
02:46:51,995 --> 02:46:54,985
That, my friend, is a Texas range.

1553
02:47:12,515 --> 02:47:14,375
What're you doing sitting up there?

1554
02:47:14,445 --> 02:47:18,944
"You've heard of Paul Revere?"
The Texan said, "Paul Revere?

1555
02:47:19,654 --> 02:47:22,984
"Oh, yes. Ain't he the fellow
that had to ride for help?"

1556
02:47:29,594 --> 02:47:32,994
<i>In just a few moments, Mr. Rink himself...</i>

1557
02:47:33,494 --> 02:47:35,994
<i>will be here at the microphone.</i>

1558
02:47:36,064 --> 02:47:37,724
Come on, let's go.

1559
02:47:45,614 --> 02:47:47,944
Jordy is looking for Jett Rink.

1560
02:47:48,214 --> 02:47:49,374
What?

1561
02:47:57,723 --> 02:48:02,163
Where we had our hair done. Jordy wants
to fight Jett because it was his orders.

1562
02:48:02,223 --> 02:48:05,353
On account of Juana. The girl said
they didn't take wetbacks.

1563
02:48:51,312 --> 02:48:53,432
Stay here, honey, I'll be right back.

1564
02:49:05,422 --> 02:49:07,652
You invited me here to insult my wife.

1565
02:49:08,992 --> 02:49:10,582
You're gonna answer for it!

1566
02:49:12,132 --> 02:49:14,421
Ain't you the one who married the squaw?

1567
02:49:15,101 --> 02:49:17,501
What's the matter, boy?
Not having a good time?

1568
02:49:17,571 --> 02:49:20,661
Get them up, Rink! Everybody knows
you got this coming to you!

1569
02:49:20,741 --> 02:49:22,071
Jordy, no!

1570
02:49:40,421 --> 02:49:44,411
You want it in front of everybody,
or you want to come outside?

1571
02:49:45,591 --> 02:49:49,361
I don't care much whether it's here
or outside...

1572
02:49:50,001 --> 02:49:53,930
so long as I get one punch
at that stuck-up face of yours.

1573
02:49:58,010 --> 02:49:59,940
Sit down.

1574
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:04,900
Governor.

1575
02:50:05,380 --> 02:50:07,070
How are you this evening?

1576
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:12,450
<i>And now, to introduce our guest of honor,</i>
<i>we hear from a man...</i>

1577
02:50:12,750 --> 02:50:17,420
<i>known from the rocky coast of Maine</i>
<i>to the Golden Gate in California.</i>

1578
02:50:17,990 --> 02:50:20,930
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our own...</i>

1579
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:23,390
<i>Senator Oliver Whiteside.</i>

1580
02:50:50,559 --> 02:50:51,859
Get them up.

1581
02:50:53,559 --> 02:50:56,259
You had this coming to you
for a long time.

1582
02:51:02,069 --> 02:51:04,399
You'll get what you gave my boy.

1583
02:51:05,369 --> 02:51:06,359
Get them up.

1584
02:51:06,439 --> 02:51:07,569
Get them up!

1585
02:51:09,879 --> 02:51:11,898
<i>...proud, friendly...</i>

1586
02:51:12,408 --> 02:51:15,468
<i>warm-hearted, successful.</i>

1587
02:51:16,248 --> 02:51:19,548
<i>Yes, successful I am sure...</i>

1588
02:51:26,528 --> 02:51:28,688
You ain't even worth hitting.

1589
02:51:33,228 --> 02:51:35,358
You want to know something true?

1590
02:51:37,508 --> 02:51:38,938
You're all through.

1591
02:52:01,497 --> 02:52:04,617
<i>I'm going to ask you</i>
<i>to come with me tonight...</i>

1592
02:52:04,767 --> 02:52:09,097
<i>as I turn back the pages</i>
<i>in my book of happy memories...</i>

1593
02:52:09,567 --> 02:52:13,127
<i>and I recall the first time</i>
<i>I saw young Jett Rink.</i>

1594
02:52:13,207 --> 02:52:15,637
- Where's the boy?
- Juana took Jordy upstairs.

1595
02:52:15,737 --> 02:52:17,037
Let's get out of here.

1596
02:52:17,107 --> 02:52:18,477
I'll go get Luz.

1597
02:52:23,147 --> 02:52:24,977
Come on, Luz. We're leaving.

1598
02:52:25,717 --> 02:52:27,577
Excuse me, please.

1599
02:52:32,026 --> 02:52:34,116
<i>The years passed quickly...</i>

1600
02:52:34,656 --> 02:52:36,986
<i>as the years have a way of doing.</i>

1601
02:52:37,056 --> 02:52:38,616
<i>And now I see Jett Rink...</i>

1602
02:52:44,536 --> 02:52:48,906
<i>afraid of neither opposition</i>
<i>nor hard work...</i>

1603
02:52:49,306 --> 02:52:52,136
<i>his eyes set on the far distant...</i>

1604
02:52:52,206 --> 02:52:55,546
<i>goal toward which he</i>'<i>s ever working...</i>

1605
02:52:55,976 --> 02:52:58,276
<i>planning, striving.</i>

1606
02:53:01,586 --> 02:53:04,246
<i>And now we come to Jett Rink, the man.</i>

1607
02:53:05,426 --> 02:53:07,915
<i>Texas has been kind to Jett Rink.</i>

1608
02:53:08,595 --> 02:53:12,225
<i>And Jett, never forgetting this kindness...</i>

1609
02:53:12,665 --> 02:53:15,355
<i>is ever ready to devote his resources...</i>

1610
02:53:15,795 --> 02:53:19,425
<i>to the greater glory of the state</i>
<i>which reared him...</i>

1611
02:53:19,505 --> 02:53:22,665
<i>which, in turn,</i>
<i>does honor to him tonight...</i>

1612
02:53:23,135 --> 02:53:26,595
<i>in this great gathering here at present.</i>

1613
02:53:28,345 --> 02:53:30,745
<i>And now, my friends, here...</i>

1614
02:53:31,045 --> 02:53:35,645
<i>and to the thousands of you</i>
<i>listening across the nation...</i>

1615
02:53:35,785 --> 02:53:38,775
<i>I have the privilege, yes...</i>

1616
02:53:39,685 --> 02:53:45,284
<i>I have the great honor to introduce</i>
<i>a legend in his own time...</i>

1617
02:53:45,924 --> 02:53:47,524
<i>a great Texan...</i>

1618
02:53:47,994 --> 02:53:50,594
<i>an outstanding American!</i>

1619
02:53:51,004 --> 02:53:54,164
<i>Yes, my friends, a man!</i>

1620
02:53:54,734 --> 02:53:57,674
<i>I give to you Jett Rink!</i>

1621
02:54:31,943 --> 02:54:33,733
You can count on me.

1622
02:54:38,183 --> 02:54:39,973
All right, goodbye.

1623
02:54:41,753 --> 02:54:42,873
How bad?

1624
02:54:43,313 --> 02:54:45,313
Got hit pretty hard in Vientecito.

1625
02:54:45,883 --> 02:54:50,153
Dr. Guerra set up an auxiliary hospital.
He needs help. I've got to go there.

1626
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:54,023
You'll make better time
if you wait till first light and fly.

1627
02:54:54,263 --> 02:54:57,133
I hate to spend the night under Jett's roof.

1628
02:54:57,493 --> 02:55:02,333
Me, too. If we weren't transporting
a circus, we'd all hightail it out of here.

1629
02:55:18,822 --> 02:55:21,552
I hope she doesn't let this
upset her too much.

1630
02:55:22,192 --> 02:55:24,182
This business tonight...

1631
02:55:25,592 --> 02:55:29,992
it's just one of those things.
The best thing to do is forget about it.

1632
02:55:30,962 --> 02:55:34,292
Go ahead and forget it.
Me, I'm going to remember it!

1633
02:55:35,832 --> 02:55:37,362
Now look, Jordy.

1634
02:55:38,302 --> 02:55:39,602
Take it easy.

1635
02:55:40,572 --> 02:55:44,131
We've had just about enough excitement
around here for one night.

1636
02:55:44,811 --> 02:55:46,211
Yeah, I guess so.

1637
02:55:50,481 --> 02:55:53,641
You've always had a mind of your own
and used it.

1638
02:55:54,621 --> 02:55:56,951
You've done things your own way.

1639
02:56:00,691 --> 02:56:04,531
You knew what you were doing
when you married in that direction.

1640
02:56:06,901 --> 02:56:10,891
I told you myself the morning
after you broke the news, remember?

1641
02:56:12,341 --> 02:56:16,331
I told you then that I knew
Juana was a mighty fine little gal...

1642
02:56:17,941 --> 02:56:21,500
but that marrying her was asking
for trouble. Remember?

1643
02:56:21,950 --> 02:56:23,410
I told you that.

1644
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:29,050
Lots of folks in these parts
get pretty jumpy about that sort of thing.

1645
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:30,350
Jett's only one of them.

1646
02:56:30,420 --> 02:56:34,590
I know those people. We've run
into this before. We're doing fine.

1647
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:40,620
I'm concerned it has to do with the people
that ought to know better.

1648
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:46,190
Like my own father.

1649
02:56:48,570 --> 02:56:52,410
Just the simple truth. That's you.
That's the way you think.

1650
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:57,800
I don't care about Jett Rink,
but you, Papa, that's different.

1651
02:56:58,280 --> 02:57:00,079
Now you look here, Jordy!

1652
02:57:00,819 --> 02:57:02,809
You can't talk to me like that.

1653
02:57:04,089 --> 02:57:05,819
No man can!

1654
02:57:08,259 --> 02:57:11,919
I'm a fair man. I've been fair all my life,
with everybody!

1655
02:57:12,729 --> 02:57:16,759
And you, my own son,
can't tell me that I'm not a fair man!

1656
02:57:20,939 --> 02:57:22,169
Look, Jordy...

1657
02:57:23,339 --> 02:57:26,569
there's ways of living,
and there's ways of doing things...

1658
02:57:26,709 --> 02:57:29,979
that folks abide by when they want
to live right and happily...

1659
02:57:30,049 --> 02:57:32,069
in the comfort of their own people.

1660
02:57:32,519 --> 02:57:35,679
I always say that Juana is
a mighty fine gal, but...

1661
02:57:35,749 --> 02:57:38,778
Don't sit there and prove what I say!
I don't like to hear it!

1662
02:57:39,358 --> 02:57:41,348
You're not being fair!

1663
02:57:42,958 --> 02:57:45,788
When that ruckus started,
who went after Rink?

1664
02:57:46,298 --> 02:57:48,128
Your old man.

1665
02:57:48,428 --> 02:57:51,298
- Who took him to account? Your old man.
- And why?

1666
02:57:52,298 --> 02:57:53,458
Because of my wife?

1667
02:57:53,538 --> 02:57:54,628
- Yes!
- No!

1668
02:57:55,008 --> 02:57:57,698
Because your son, Jordan Benedict...

1669
02:57:57,838 --> 02:58:00,938
descendant of the long, proud line
of Reata...

1670
02:58:01,008 --> 02:58:05,178
got knocked flat on his back
in front of all of Texas. That's why!

1671
02:58:22,367 --> 02:58:25,197
Forget it. Don't worry yourself about it.

1672
02:58:34,377 --> 02:58:38,967
Mom, you made a mistake when you got
yourself mixed up with us rowdy Texans.

1673
02:58:40,477 --> 02:58:45,177
I'm shocked at you! I'm shocked
at all of us! I'm just so ashamed!

1674
02:58:45,757 --> 02:58:50,017
I'll never forget the sight of my brother
barging into the grand ballroom...

1675
02:58:50,087 --> 02:58:54,716
with all of our friends, disgracing us!
Then my father made it a bigger brawl!

1676
02:58:54,796 --> 02:58:57,196
How can I face people again?

1677
02:58:57,266 --> 02:58:59,696
If you keep seeing Jett,
you won't have to face me.

1678
02:58:59,766 --> 02:59:00,826
Children!

1679
02:59:01,266 --> 02:59:03,206
How about that anyway, Mom?

1680
02:59:03,266 --> 02:59:05,066
I haven't been asked.

1681
02:59:05,136 --> 02:59:08,626
It seems that my family
just can't tolerate his success.

1682
02:59:08,946 --> 02:59:10,276
My darling, Luz.

1683
02:59:10,446 --> 02:59:13,606
Tonight meant a lot to Jett. Really. I know.

1684
02:59:15,246 --> 02:59:18,916
If I only knew how to apologize to him,
I'd go to him now.

1685
02:59:20,756 --> 02:59:23,246
But I can't face all those people.

1686
02:59:24,186 --> 02:59:26,356
The party is over. They've all gone home.

1687
02:59:27,966 --> 02:59:30,626
He passed out like a light
in front of the whole crowd.

1688
02:59:30,696 --> 02:59:31,856
Oh, no!

1689
02:59:32,296 --> 02:59:34,025
That's what we heard, Luz.

1690
02:59:35,835 --> 02:59:38,025
He must have been ill.

1691
02:59:38,905 --> 02:59:40,735
Weak with shame or something.

1692
02:59:41,175 --> 02:59:44,005
He was plain drunk, if you'll forgive me.

1693
02:59:45,115 --> 02:59:46,835
I don't believe you.

1694
02:59:48,615 --> 02:59:51,745
The party broke up early,
but not a minute too soon.

1695
02:59:58,425 --> 03:00:00,655
Give me Mr. Rink's penthouse, please.

1696
03:00:00,725 --> 03:00:04,385
You're not going up there,
even if I have to sit on you!

1697
03:00:05,695 --> 03:00:08,395
It's important. Do you know where he is?

1698
03:00:08,465 --> 03:00:11,455
Luz, it's not like you
to make a fool of yourself.

1699
03:00:12,934 --> 03:00:16,434
I know where he is, honey.
Come along with Uncle Bawley.

1700
03:00:18,714 --> 03:00:21,204
All right, Luz. If you must go.

1701
03:00:23,584 --> 03:00:24,744
I must.

1702
03:00:27,184 --> 03:00:30,344
I've always held a strange power
over your mother.

1703
03:00:38,034 --> 03:00:39,694
I'm sorry, Mother.

1704
03:00:50,943 --> 03:00:54,773
What do you say, doll face?
About ready to come along with me?

1705
03:00:57,643 --> 03:00:59,273
It's time we hit the hay.

1706
03:01:04,793 --> 03:01:05,953
I give up.

1707
03:01:11,063 --> 03:01:12,363
Can we go to work now?

1708
03:01:12,433 --> 03:01:15,923
Leave him alone.
He owns the place, let him enjoy it.

1709
03:01:16,003 --> 03:01:17,163
Shut up.

1710
03:01:18,233 --> 03:01:19,393
Shut up!

1711
03:01:38,252 --> 03:01:41,242
Ladies and gentlemen
and distinguished guests.

1712
03:01:45,362 --> 03:01:48,022
I just want to count the blessings...

1713
03:01:50,162 --> 03:01:53,832
that this great domain
has bestowed upon her humble son.

1714
03:01:56,372 --> 03:01:57,672
My friends...

1715
03:02:00,412 --> 03:02:02,312
this is a man.

1716
03:02:09,351 --> 03:02:11,011
Old Mother Texas!

1717
03:02:12,821 --> 03:02:14,811
What did she give to me?

1718
03:02:15,591 --> 03:02:18,081
Not a goddamn thing.

1719
03:02:18,591 --> 03:02:22,461
You've got to work and sweat
and steal it from her.

1720
03:02:25,201 --> 03:02:29,831
But I got mine right out of the ground.

1721
03:02:33,041 --> 03:02:34,531
Poor Jett...

1722
03:02:37,111 --> 03:02:39,241
fighting for what's good.

1723
03:02:39,951 --> 03:02:41,211
Flunky!

1724
03:02:42,721 --> 03:02:45,151
Flunky for Bick Benedict...

1725
03:02:46,591 --> 03:02:47,810
her husband.

1726
03:02:52,430 --> 03:02:53,790
Poor Jett!

1727
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:03,030
Poor pretty Leslie!

1728
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:06,370
Pretty Leslie...

1729
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:12,980
Pretty Leslie.
Wonderful, beautiful girl bride!

1730
03:03:15,650 --> 03:03:16,980
Poor boy.

1731
03:03:17,980 --> 03:03:19,040
Rich...

1732
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:21,310
Rich Mrs. Benedict.

1733
03:03:25,459 --> 03:03:27,119
She's beautiful.

1734
03:03:28,599 --> 03:03:29,789
Lovely.

1735
03:03:30,599 --> 03:03:32,159
The woman a man wants.

1736
03:03:33,399 --> 03:03:35,729
A woman a man has got to have, too!

1737
03:03:59,629 --> 03:04:01,589
Thank you, Uncle Bawley.

1738
03:04:04,298 --> 03:04:05,558
Governor...

1739
03:04:09,898 --> 03:04:11,928
you know what you can do?

1740
03:04:49,937 --> 03:04:51,927
As soon as it lands, I'll sell it.

1741
03:04:52,247 --> 03:04:52,937
Good.

1742
03:04:53,007 --> 03:04:54,207
This is for me, boy.

1743
03:04:54,277 --> 03:04:55,507
The simple life.

1744
03:04:55,577 --> 03:04:57,707
No more of this high-flying nonsense.

1745
03:05:28,146 --> 03:05:31,406
Juana, how does a hamburger
and a piece of pie sound to you?

1746
03:05:31,476 --> 03:05:32,676
Sounds very good.

1747
03:05:33,786 --> 03:05:36,116
No more of this highfalutin stuff.

1748
03:05:36,256 --> 03:05:38,946
Let's stop at this drive-in
and have us some chicken.

1749
03:05:39,026 --> 03:05:40,886
Then we can eat it with our fingers.

1750
03:06:32,705 --> 03:06:36,545
Nice place you have here. I've been
intending to stop every time I drove by.

1751
03:06:36,615 --> 03:06:37,775
Thank you.

1752
03:06:37,875 --> 03:06:40,434
What do you recommend?
How is the fried chicken?

1753
03:06:40,544 --> 03:06:43,074
Little Jordy wants ice cream, Grandpa.

1754
03:06:44,654 --> 03:06:45,714
Grandpa?

1755
03:06:47,624 --> 03:06:49,454
Ice cream it shall be.

1756
03:06:50,694 --> 03:06:52,854
Give the little fellow some ice cream.

1757
03:06:53,024 --> 03:06:54,724
Ice cream?

1758
03:06:54,794 --> 03:06:57,194
I thought that kid would want a tamale.

1759
03:07:08,314 --> 03:07:10,304
Give them what they want.

1760
03:07:27,063 --> 03:07:29,293
What do you say? Is this all right?

1761
03:07:30,233 --> 03:07:31,563
It's good.

1762
03:07:32,933 --> 03:07:35,593
After all that fancy food and high living.

1763
03:07:35,903 --> 03:07:37,263
This is the life.

1764
03:07:54,383 --> 03:07:55,543
Hey, you.

1765
03:07:58,892 --> 03:08:02,592
The plane should arrive in Benedict
around 1:30.

1766
03:08:06,632 --> 03:08:08,622
You're in the wrong place.

1767
03:08:08,832 --> 03:08:11,162
Come on, let's get out of here.

1768
03:08:12,742 --> 03:08:14,532
Your money is no good here.

1769
03:08:16,012 --> 03:08:17,672
Come on, let's go.

1770
03:08:19,542 --> 03:08:20,602
You, too.

1771
03:08:20,742 --> 03:08:22,142
Hold on a minute.

1772
03:08:29,722 --> 03:08:31,552
Yes, what do you want?

1773
03:08:33,492 --> 03:08:38,481
Look here, Sarge. I'd sure appreciate it
if you were more polite to these people.

1774
03:08:39,631 --> 03:08:41,121
You would, eh?

1775
03:08:42,071 --> 03:08:45,231
I'm Bick Benedict.
Your neighbor, you might say.

1776
03:08:45,901 --> 03:08:48,601
Does that give you special privileges?

1777
03:08:48,971 --> 03:08:53,431
The name Benedict's meant something
to people around here for a long time.

1778
03:08:55,911 --> 03:08:58,181
That there papoose down there...

1779
03:08:59,281 --> 03:09:01,011
is his name Benedict, too?

1780
03:09:08,791 --> 03:09:12,021
Yes. Come to think of it, it is.

1781
03:09:14,430 --> 03:09:16,160
Forget I asked you.

1782
03:09:16,630 --> 03:09:19,760
Go sit down,
and we ain't gonna have no trouble.

1783
03:09:20,070 --> 03:09:22,700
But this bunch's gonna eat
somewhere else.

1784
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:25,670
All right, come on. Let's go.

1785
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:27,210
Come on, you, too.

1786
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:33,510
You're out of line, mister.

1787
03:11:57,256 --> 03:12:00,246
Is that the best
that old horse thief can do?

1788
03:12:01,026 --> 03:12:04,356
He's feeling your mood, darling.

1789
03:12:05,696 --> 03:12:08,796
There's a lot of <i>Clair de Lune</i>
in both of you old fire-eaters.

1790
03:12:09,806 --> 03:12:12,136
You're both rather gentle creatures.

1791
03:12:12,576 --> 03:12:13,906
How awful!

1792
03:12:17,876 --> 03:12:19,366
Those kids...

1793
03:12:20,076 --> 03:12:21,566
Look at them.

1794
03:12:22,046 --> 03:12:25,506
Those kids, in their infinite wisdom,
are smarter than we are.

1795
03:12:26,556 --> 03:12:29,385
They know I'm a disgrace.
And they don't hesitate to say so.

1796
03:12:31,785 --> 03:12:34,125
Even the calf's got my number.

1797
03:12:36,395 --> 03:12:39,055
I don't have to take it from a sheep!

1798
03:12:40,495 --> 03:12:41,985
Now, Jordan!

1799
03:12:48,875 --> 03:12:52,835
Hello, Vashti. We're all fine.
How'd you make it back?

1800
03:12:55,885 --> 03:12:58,715
- They all made it back in one piece.
- Jolly.

1801
03:12:59,455 --> 03:13:02,945
Yes, all our guests have finally gone.
Thank goodness!

1802
03:13:05,724 --> 03:13:08,384
But more have left than we bargained for.

1803
03:13:08,594 --> 03:13:12,584
Luz has gone on to Hollywood with Lola,
whatever the name was.

1804
03:13:14,994 --> 03:13:18,334
She decided she would like to see
how she liked Hollywood.

1805
03:13:20,434 --> 03:13:22,234
We never had one in the family.

1806
03:13:22,304 --> 03:13:24,134
Good Lord, an actress!

1807
03:13:26,614 --> 03:13:30,944
All you can do is raise them.
You can't live their lives for them.

1808
03:13:33,954 --> 03:13:36,544
Judy and Bob are out looking at a ranch.

1809
03:13:37,324 --> 03:13:38,444
A small one.

1810
03:13:40,694 --> 03:13:43,684
Jordy and Juana are gonna move
into Vientecito.

1811
03:13:43,964 --> 03:13:46,983
And we, we're home minding the babies.

1812
03:13:52,033 --> 03:13:56,373
The sun's going down over the yardarm.
When are you going to open up the bar?

1813
03:13:56,443 --> 03:13:57,963
Anytime. Go ahead.

1814
03:13:59,343 --> 03:14:02,243
Remember, one of these days
that bourbon's gonna kill you.

1815
03:14:02,313 --> 03:14:04,503
Okay. It'll be me or it.

1816
03:14:05,183 --> 03:14:06,913
One of us has got to go.

1817
03:14:09,323 --> 03:14:12,983
I'm going to stay right here.
It's coming onto spring.

1818
03:14:14,153 --> 03:14:17,153
Roundup time is no time
to be away from Reata.

1819
03:14:27,002 --> 03:14:30,992
Honey, everybody's on the move.
The strays are leaving the herd.

1820
03:14:33,512 --> 03:14:38,812
I wouldn't mind it too much if you wanted
to pack up and go back home for a spell.

1821
03:14:40,352 --> 03:14:41,402
Home?

1822
03:14:42,682 --> 03:14:47,022
Where do you think I've been
this last breathless quarter of a century?

1823
03:14:48,422 --> 03:14:49,552
Home.

1824
03:14:50,162 --> 03:14:52,322
Look, boy, I belong here!

1825
03:14:55,292 --> 03:14:58,292
You really want to know
what's gotten my goat?

1826
03:15:00,532 --> 03:15:03,371
My own grandson doesn't even look
like one of us.

1827
03:15:03,741 --> 03:15:06,361
He really looks like a little wetback.

1828
03:15:12,411 --> 03:15:14,901
Little <i>muchacho</i> fires up, don't he?

1829
03:15:16,551 --> 03:15:18,641
I'm sorry, Jordan Benedict IV.

1830
03:15:19,391 --> 03:15:21,721
There's times when a man
just has to be honest.

1831
03:15:25,161 --> 03:15:26,961
You know something, Leslie?

1832
03:15:28,131 --> 03:15:29,921
There's no use kidding.

1833
03:15:31,061 --> 03:15:32,551
I'm a failure.

1834
03:15:33,301 --> 03:15:36,531
Nothing has turned out like I had planned.

1835
03:15:40,171 --> 03:15:43,510
I just feel like my saddle's turning
right out from under me.

1836
03:15:46,450 --> 03:15:48,310
Do you want to know something?

1837
03:15:50,750 --> 03:15:52,580
I think you're great!

1838
03:15:55,350 --> 03:15:58,850
Don't ask me why.
Some things are difficult to explain.

1839
03:16:00,330 --> 03:16:04,630
You know all that fine riding
you used to do, and all that fancy roping...

1840
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:07,760
and all that glamour stuff
you did to dazzle me?

1841
03:16:07,900 --> 03:16:09,420
It was impressive.

1842
03:16:10,970 --> 03:16:14,460
But none of it ever made you
quite as big a man to me...

1843
03:16:15,070 --> 03:16:18,410
as you were on the floor
of Sarge's hamburger joint.

1844
03:16:22,749 --> 03:16:24,839
When you tumbled rearward...

1845
03:16:25,019 --> 03:16:28,509
and landed crashing
into that pile of dirty dishes...

1846
03:16:29,919 --> 03:16:32,249
you were at last my hero.

1847
03:16:33,659 --> 03:16:36,219
That's what you always wanted to be.

1848
03:16:36,859 --> 03:16:37,889
Could be.

1849
03:16:38,599 --> 03:16:42,259
When we went into that place,
before the fight started...

1850
03:16:44,339 --> 03:16:47,029
What a fight! It was glorious!

1851
03:16:48,569 --> 03:16:52,139
Before we went in,
I was feeling like you are now.

1852
03:16:53,149 --> 03:16:54,979
I was thinking to myself:

1853
03:16:55,579 --> 03:16:56,669
"Well...

1854
03:16:56,749 --> 03:17:00,578
"Jordan and I, and the others behind us,
have been failures."

1855
03:17:02,088 --> 03:17:03,648
And then it happened.

1856
03:17:04,688 --> 03:17:09,148
You wound up on the floor, on your back,
in the middle of the salad.

1857
03:17:10,658 --> 03:17:12,128
And I said to myself:

1858
03:17:13,198 --> 03:17:14,258
"Well...

1859
03:17:15,028 --> 03:17:17,198
"after 100 years...

1860
03:17:18,198 --> 03:17:20,068
"the Benedict family...

1861
03:17:20,338 --> 03:17:23,068
"is a real big success."

1862
03:17:25,678 --> 03:17:27,838
You want to know something, Leslie?

1863
03:17:29,418 --> 03:17:31,408
If I live to be 90...

1864
03:17:33,288 --> 03:17:36,118
I'll never be able to figure you out.
