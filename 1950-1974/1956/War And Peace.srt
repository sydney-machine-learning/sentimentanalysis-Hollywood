2
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:31,589
{y:i}As the 19th century began,

3
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:34,842
{y:i}a darkening shadow 
 {y:i}moved across Europe.

4
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:38,846
{y:i}This shadow was propelled 
 {y:i}by the voice of one man,

5
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:40,723
{y:i}Napoleon Bonaparte.

6
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:44,769
{y:i}Only Russia and England 
 {y:i}offered impressive resistance.

7
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:48,898
{y:i}Over Russia, the weather was clear, 
 {y:i}the sun was shining.

8
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,526
{y:i}Napoleon was 1,000 miles away,

9
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:55,864
{y:i}and the streets of Moscow 
 {y:i}were excellent for parades.

10
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,738
Splendid sights, 
 splendid men, eh, Pierre?

11
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:40,533
- For parades. 
 - What do you mean by that?

12
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:43,703
Remember, I've seen 
 the French marching, too.

13
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:47,624
Don't tell me 
 they march better than that.

14
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:53,922
- Led by the greatest man in Europe. 
 - Bonaparte?

15
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,882
Bonaparte.

16
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:59,552
A usurper! A murderer! 
 A deposer of kings!

17
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:04,057
A colossus! 
 A fresh wind! A cleansing force!

18
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,269
What does your father say 
 when he hears you?

19
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:12,398
We don't talk about things like that, 
 my father and I.

20
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:17,654
- How is he? 
 - The doctors say he'll die any moment.

21
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,950
- Have you been to see him? 
 - I'm waiting to be asked.

22
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:25,203
In heaven, all things will be arranged.

23
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:28,373
I believe that's the rumour.

24
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,834
This is your home 
 when you want it to be,

25
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,215
and the Rostovs are your family 
 when you want them to be.

26
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,176
I smoke too much.

27
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:48,059
Isn't it lovely? How can you bear 
 not to go with them?

28
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,894
I can bear it.

29
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,816
If I were a man, I'd be down there, 
 riding a terrible black horse,

30
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,651
waving a sword.

31
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,032
It's so unfair.

32
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:07,370
Men are the only people 
 permitted to have any fun.

33
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,556
What is it, Natasha?

34
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:32,520
Those handsome young men 
 marching away to fight.

35
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:35,815
They could be killed.

36
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,672
Don't be frightened. Come on.

37
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,761
Nicholas!

38
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,600
Now, what's this?

39
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,271
You look so dazzling in your uniform.

40
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,899
And you're going so far away.

41
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:22,153
Austria's miles, 
 I looked it up on the map.

42
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,489
That brute, Napoleon.

43
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:28,284
The Austrians make beautiful 
 bracelets. I'll bring you one.

44
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,039
- Two! They're wearing them in pairs! 
 - Two.

45
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:36,960
Pierre, you remember our cousin, 
 Sonya. She's come to stay.

46
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:41,214
Yes, though she was considerably 
 younger the last time I saw her.

47
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,969
Girls grow up, Pierre. Very fast. 
 Doesn't he look glorious?

48
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:50,056
Mama and Papa have 
 such handsome children!

49
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,350
Did you hear that?

50
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:54,644
Now, attention!

51
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:59,232
Ensign Count Nicholas Rostov, 
 I decorate you with the Order of...

52
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:01,734
...Absolutely Everything!

53
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:06,865
Don't laugh when she jokes 
 about the army.

54
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,035
Well, Petya, 
 you have to humour women a little!

55
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,914
You do look shiny, Nicholas. 
 If only I was old enough.

56
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,541
That'll come.

57
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,795
By that time, there won't be 
 a Frenchman left to be killed!

58
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,173
Don't worry, there'll always be 
 plenty of Frenchmen.

59
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:28,511
- Good luck. 
 - That's very civil of you.

60
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:32,849
- But why not take a commission? 
 - It's so easy for you men.

61
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,685
You decide to do something, then do it.

62
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,105
If you were a man, what would you do?

63
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,524
I'd become enormously powerful.

64
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:46,237
I'd become the Czar's most trusted 
 minister, and he'd consult me.

65
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:49,115
And you would sit at my right hand.

66
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,327
Whenever anything was complicated,

67
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:55,622
the case would be laid before you 
 as judge.

68
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:58,124
Why me?

69
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:02,670
Because your heart is pure 
 and you're good.

70
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:05,173
Well done, my dear.

71
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:08,176
On that note, I think I should leave.

72
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,512
If you had that power, 
 what would you do?

73
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,139
I?

74
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:19,187
I would hesitate. Now I must go.

75
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:23,566
- Pierre, come again soon. 
 - I'll walk you to the door.

76
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,070
- "Au revoir." 
 - Come soon again.

77
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,489
Come again soon.

78
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:33,535
Mama and Papa will be awfully 
 lonely with Nicholas gone.

79
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,623
- They do love seeing you. 
 - Of course. I love the whole family.

80
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:42,877
The whole family? 
 That's not as simple as you think.

81
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,879
What do you mean?

82
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:48,174
There are currents and counter-currents.

83
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,596
{y:i}Au revoir.

84
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,351
Now, where are you going? 
 Dolokhov's rooms?

85
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:00,603
I am. How did you know?

86
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:03,898
I hear things, I hear things.

87
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:11,614
Go. Go to your night of disgusting, 
 fascinating debauchery.

88
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:15,702
{y:i}Au revoir.

89
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,816
Bravo! Bravo!

90
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:37,825
- Careful, there's a bet on here. 
 - Fetch me a bottle of rum!

91
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,662
You two, break this out.

92
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:43,164
Now, let's get this straight.

93
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,084
Fifty imperials against Prince Anatole

94
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,963
that I drink a bottle of rum 
 without taking it from my mouth,

95
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:55,510
balancing on the outside ledge 
 without touching the sides of the window.

96
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:59,931
- Want to make it a hundred? 
 - Fifty is enough for you to lose.

97
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:02,684
Get down from there, you weaklings.

98
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,061
- Hercules, come on! 
 - Come on!

99
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,313
You do it!

100
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,470
Hail Moscow!

101
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:41,681
Give me that!

102
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,684
Don't be crazy, you'll be killed.

103
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,689
Touch me again, 
 I'll throw you down there.

104
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:52,192
That goes for every one of you.

105
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:55,904
Play! Play! 
 What are we paying you for?

106
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,618
Now then, my friends.

107
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:05,496
Remember, without taking the bottle 
 from your lips.

108
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,917
Bravo!

109
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,505
Fifty imperials, Anatole!

110
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,634
And double for anyone else 
 who will do it.

111
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,972
I'll do it for nothing, without a bet!

112
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:11,771
- You get dizzy walking up steps! 
 - Out of my way!

113
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:21,114
Give me a bottle!

114
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:33,626
Get down from there.

115
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:38,298
- Get down from there, Pierre. 
 - Let him do it.

116
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:41,593
Your father is calling for you.

117
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,096
Excuse me, gentlemen.

118
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,351
I suggest a little cold water first.

119
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:53,062
I'll wait for you.

120
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:57,066
Prince Andrei, 
 is the old boy really dying?

121
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:01,404
The doctors are certain 
 Count Bezukhov won't last the night.

122
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:07,452
- Are my father and sister there? 
 - He was there. She was expected.

123
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:12,373
That's good. I don't have to go. 
 The family's well represented.

124
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,050
Careful, careful.

125
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:27,680
You disapprove of me? Of course. 
 You'd be wrong if you didn't.

126
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:33,394
Arriving at the deathbed of my father 
 bleary-eyed, stinking of alcohol.

127
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,773
He disapproves, too, my father.

128
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:41,903
That's fair enough. I disapprove 
 of many things about him.

129
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:46,658
Chiefly, I disapprove of the fact 
 that he didn't marry my mother.

130
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,328
Perhaps, if I was legitimate...

131
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:55,959
I have sinned, Lord, 
 but I have several excellent excuses.

132
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:59,546
With all that, Andrei, 
 you still disapprove?

133
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:02,382
You're not being worthy of yourself.

134
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:07,095
You're not living up to the best things 
 in yourself. Be somebody!

135
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,683
That's where the puzzle begins, 
 be somebody. Be what? Who am I?

136
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:15,728
Am I the next Count Bezukhov, 
 lord of vast estates,

137
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:19,482
with a fixed position, 
 fixed responsibilities?

138
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,150
Not quite!

139
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:25,321
My father cannot quite acknowledge 
 that I am his son.

140
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:29,492
But he cannot quite acknowledge 
 that I am not his son.

141
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:32,287
That makes everybody uncomfortable, 
 including myself.

142
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:38,293
- You must aim at something. 
 - You're right, I agree with you.

143
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:42,005
Each morning I wake up, 
 I'm disgusted with myself

144
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,799
with what I did the night before.

145
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:48,428
I tell myself, "Today, a change."

146
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:51,890
If my headache is bad enough, 
 I say, "Pierre...

147
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,935
"...today you must take steps 
 to become a saint."

148
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,355
I drop into the club 
 and watch the card-playing,

149
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,112
just order a glass of water to prove 
 how marvellously I resist temptation.

150
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:11,451
Then someone comes along 
 and says, "Just one vodka, Pierre."

151
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:15,747
Next morning, my headache is worse, 
 my pockets are emptier.

152
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,708
There must be 
 something you want to do.

153
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,628
I want to discover... everything!

154
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:27,592
I want to discover why I know 
 what's right and still do what's wrong.

155
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:33,139
I want to discover what happiness is, 
 and what value there is in suffering.

156
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:36,392
I want to discover why men go to war,

157
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:42,649
and what they really say 
 deep in their hearts when they pray.

158
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:48,321
I want to discover what men and 
 women feel when they say they love.

159
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:51,616
There's enough to keep me busy.

160
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:56,829
It's hard to understand someone like me.

161
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:59,249
Everything is so clear for you.

162
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:03,086
- You know exactly what you must do. 
 - Oh, exactly!

163
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:06,381
You're different from me. 
 You study, you become enlightened.

164
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:09,801
I study, I become confused.

165
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:14,889
You love, you marry. You believe, 
 you act. There's a war, you serve.

166
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:18,184
If only I really answered 
 to your description.

167
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,479
- You do. 
 - Shall I show you how wrong you are?

168
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:26,276
- I know you. I'm not wrong. 
 - Know why I'm going to the war?

169
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:29,153
Because I regard Napoleon 
 as a monster?

170
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,033
Because I believe we should fight 
 Austria's battles 2,000 miles away?

171
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:37,912
Because Russia will be 
 a greater nation after the war?

172
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:39,455
Then, why?

173
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:44,627
Because I married the most loving 
 and attractive woman in Moscow,

174
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:47,797
and I can't stand it.

175
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:49,799
Never marry, Pierre.

176
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:53,303
Or only when you're old 
 and good for nothing,

177
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:56,514
or else everything noble in you 
 will be lost.

178
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,601
You'll waste yourself on trifles.

179
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:03,021
Yes. Don't look at me like that.

180
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,440
You talk of Bonaparte's career.

181
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:07,567
If Bonaparte had married young,

182
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:12,655
he'd still be on half-pay, 
 carrying his wife's handbag,

183
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,036
inviting idiots to his house because 
 his wife wanted invitations to theirs!

184
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:24,602
- Prince Andrei. 
 - Princess Hélene.

185
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,063
You told my brother he was expected?

186
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,357
- I did. 
 - Isn't he coming?

187
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,609
I believe not.

188
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,487
Thank you.

189
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:51,671
How is he, Prince Vasili?

190
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:57,677
His confessor is with him. 
 They are giving him extreme unction.

191
00:19:57,802 --> 00:20:00,597
He was asking for you.

192
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:05,768
I hope you are in a proper condition 
 to see him this time.

193
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:08,980
Follow me.

194
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:12,442
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

195
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,291
If you please, Monsieur Pierre.

196
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:15,547
He wishes you to kiss him goodbye.

197
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:46,911
This is for you.

198
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:57,755
Now he would like to sleep.

199
00:22:21,154 --> 00:22:23,281
Pierre...

200
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:27,911
So late. 
 Finally, at the end, he loved me.

201
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:30,538
So late.

202
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,790
He gave me this.

203
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:40,924
This letter is for the Czar.

204
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,053
- And this one for you, Pierre. 
 - Open it.

205
00:22:54,562 --> 00:22:57,357
"Your father, in his letter to the Czar,

206
00:22:57,482 --> 00:23:01,694
"he begs that you be legitimately 
 acknowledged as his son

207
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:07,534
"and the next Count Bezukhov, 
 the sole heir to all his estates."

208
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:20,129
Be worthy, my boy.

209
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:23,341
Be worthy of your great father.

210
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:27,971
How often we sin. 
 How much we deceive, and for what?

211
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,723
It all ends in death.

212
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:35,061
Kiss your cousin, Hélene, 
 he has been reborn.

213
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:38,731
Embrace him. Wish him well.

214
00:24:03,214 --> 00:24:05,925
It's a good thing 
 we're going back to Moscow.

215
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,305
After three weeks in the country, 
 I can hardly keep my eyes open.

216
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:16,144
Still, it was a profitable trip, 
 wasn't it, Pierre?

217
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,772
Very profitable.

218
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:47,175
I'll see how long we have to wait.

219
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,263
There's no hurry. It'll give Papa 
 a few extra winks of sleep.

220
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:59,229
Andrei!

221
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:02,232
Pierre!

222
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:09,656
- Where are you going? Your father's? 
 - Yes. Tell me your news.

223
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:13,618
- Are you alone? 
 - No. Prince Vasili is with me.

224
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:15,787
And his daughter, too.

225
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:21,918
We made a tour of inspection of 
 my estates. It's huge and backward.

226
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:25,296
Now I'm Count Bezukhov, 
 I must do something about it.

227
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:28,508
That's why you went 
 with Prince Vasili and Hélene.

228
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,594
Prince Vasili helps me 
 with the administration.

229
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,137
Of course.

230
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:35,056
Say hello to Lise.

231
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:38,101
She's miserable at being 
 stuck in the country.

232
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:41,563
Hélene loves the country. 
 It was her idea to come.

233
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:43,815
I'm sure.

234
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:48,194
- Children, go away! 
 - How long are you here?

235
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,865
For ever. 
 Months and months and months!

236
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,702
Until after the baby is born. 
 No, thank you.

237
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,996
Andrei's leaving tomorrow.

238
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:02,125
He thought it'd be better for me here 
 than alone in Moscow.

239
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,711
How do you feel about it?

240
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:06,713
I dread it.

241
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:10,216
Even so, you consented 
 to bury yourself down here?

242
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:13,177
Andrei wants me to.

243
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:16,973
If it were I, 
 I'd find something else to do.

244
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:20,435
I suppose so. 
 But we're very different.

245
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,312
Indeed we are.

246
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:26,107
- Have you asked her to marry you? 
 - No.

247
00:26:26,232 --> 00:26:29,068
Are you going to?

248
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,738
I don't know yet.

249
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:37,118
- Do you want some advice? 
 - On any subject. Not on this.

250
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,787
All right.

251
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,007
Andrei! Lise!

252
00:26:57,263 --> 00:27:01,726
We thought you'd never come. 
 Lise, you look so beautiful.

253
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:05,605
- You, too, Mary. 
 - No, I'm just a country mouse.

254
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,527
It isn't true what you wrote, 
 that you're only staying overnight?

255
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:15,823
- I'm afraid it is. 
 - Lise, talk to him. Make him stay.

256
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:20,578
- I've tried. 
 - Lise's very tired. She'd better rest.

257
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:24,832
- Yes? 
 - Your father would like to see you.

258
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:28,127
Thank you. 
 You'd better go upstairs, Lise.

259
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:30,630
You'll see him at dinner.

260
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:32,173
Come!

261
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:41,099
Here's the warrior!

262
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:46,229
Here's the Bolkonsky 
 that's going to beat Napoleon.

263
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:49,315
How are you, my boy?

264
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,652
I'm well, Father. How is your health?

265
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:56,489
The same, boy, the same. 
 Only fools fall ill.

266
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:59,909
You know me, 
 busy from morning till night.

267
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:02,579
Little to eat, less to drink, 
 of course I'm well.

268
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:06,833
- Thank God. 
 - God has nothing to do with it.

269
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,135
Just a moment, please.

270
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,222
- Don't refuse. 
 - What is it?

271
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:26,561
Father's father used to take it 
 along with him... in all his wars.

272
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:30,815
If it's not too heavy 
 and won't break my neck.

273
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,319
Promise that you'll never take it off.

274
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:36,571
- Promise? 
 - Yes.

275
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,621
Kiss me here.

276
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:56,216
Thank you, my boy.

277
00:28:56,341 --> 00:29:00,678
- Why do you thank me, Father? 
 - For doing your duty.

278
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:05,350
For not allowing yourself 
 to be tied to a woman's apron strings.

279
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:09,687
The army before everything. 
 Thank you, thank you.

280
00:29:12,273 --> 00:29:14,859
About my wife, Father...

281
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:18,029
Your wife? Go on, speak.

282
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:21,908
When her confinement is due, 
 send to Moscow for a doctor.

283
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:25,495
- A doctor? 
 - No one can do nature's work.

284
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,707
But they've been telling her things 
 and she's had a dream.

285
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:32,293
She's frightened.

286
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:35,171
All right, all right.

287
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:38,049
Give this to Michael Kutuzov.

288
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:40,385
We were at school together.

289
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,597
He wasn't exactly a bright lad, 
 but never mind.

290
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:48,726
I've written to tell him 
 to keep you away from headquarters.

291
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:50,979
They're bad places.

292
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,233
Tell him I remember him 
 and admire him.

293
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,485
Now, goodbye.

294
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,619
Remember this, Prince Andrei.

295
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:11,207
If they kill you, 
 it will hurt me, your old father.

296
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:16,296
But, if you don't behave like the son 
 of Nicholas Bolkonsky, it will be worse.

297
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,007
I shall be shamed.

298
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:22,886
You needn't have said that to me, Father.

299
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:27,390
I... also wanted to ask you,

300
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:31,144
if I am killed and I have a son,

301
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,689
don't let him be taken away from you.

302
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:37,358
Let him grow up here.

303
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:40,695
With you. Please.

304
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:49,871
What are you waiting for? 
 We've said goodbye. Go! Go!

305
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:01,966
Andrei, you're leaving already?

306
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:06,679
Don't go, don't leave me here. 
 I'll be so lonely.

307
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:09,807
I'll leave you here 
 with my father and Mary.

308
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,227
Stay until tomorrow. 
 Stay another day.

309
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:15,647
I can't, Lise, you know that!

310
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:20,276
You're delighted to go. 
 You're delighted to get rid of me!

311
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:23,821
Andrei, Andrei...

312
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:39,254
Bye, Mary.

313
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,553
Katya, get some smelling salts.

314
00:31:55,979 --> 00:32:00,733
Tell the silly horse to stop shaking 
 its head. I'll never get it.

315
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:04,863
You heard the lady, 
 stop shaking your head.

316
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:10,577
You see? Animals are much 
 more reasonable than people.

317
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:22,380
Might I offer you a million roubles 
 to paint my portrait?

318
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:28,928
But you must make me 
 look at least as good as the horse!

319
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:32,599
It's not fair to look at it 
 before it's finished.

320
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:36,394
- Very unpromising, isn't it? 
 - Yes, it is.

321
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,564
You needn't be 
 in such a hurry to agree.

322
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:46,070
It's not meant to be a work of art. 
 Papa bought the colt for Nicholas.

323
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:49,824
I'll send him the picture 
 to show him what it's like.

324
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:54,329
- Have you finished? 
 - For the moment.

325
00:32:56,497 --> 00:32:59,459
Charge! Come on! Hurry!

326
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,422
Come on! Come on!

327
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:11,346
- Have you heard from Nicholas? 
 - Papa received a letter. Not me.

328
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:14,265
Men forget about women when at war.

329
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,937
- Men don't, boys do. 
 - Nicholas would be furious at that!

330
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:23,483
- He'd challenge you to a duel. 
 - It's a better reason than most.

331
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:26,486
The reason he wrote 
 was for more money.

332
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:30,657
He lends money to his captain 
 who loses it at cards.

333
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:33,493
The captain sounds a lot like Papa.

334
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:37,497
His name's Denisov. 
 He's got moustaches out to here.

335
00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:40,708
He lisps and he's the bravest man 
 in the world.

336
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,336
Nicholas says 
 he's having a glorious time,

337
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:45,547
and we'll win the war soon.

338
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:49,842
He's beginning to feel quite sorry 
 for Napoleon.

339
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:53,346
Kill them! Come on, men!

340
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:57,809
Take that! Come on, charge!

341
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:02,897
There's no doubt, 
 wars must be very amusing.

342
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:06,025
- I must put it on my list. 
 - What list?

343
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,363
My list of the greatest human 
 pleasures in order of importance.

344
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:14,659
- I'd neglected war. 
 - What are the other pleasures?

345
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:18,746
The opera, eternal friendship, 
 summertime, dancing the mazurka,

346
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:22,083
the country in spring 
 and welcoming soldiers home.

347
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,962
- Have you any suggestions? 
 - Let me think.

348
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:28,756
To be able to believe in God,

349
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:31,175
to cause happiness, to love.

350
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:34,262
Love! Sonya's in love with Nicholas.

351
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:38,182
She cries every day in the morning 
 for a full hour.

352
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:42,353
- Don't you intend to fall in love? 
 - Many times but only for recreation.

353
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,065
And I'll keep changing partners 
 like a dance.

354
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,819
When I finally say, 
 "I love you," and mean it,

355
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:52,572
it'll be like a defeated general,

356
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:56,075
surrendering and handing his sword 
 to his enemy.

357
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,660
You'll change.

358
00:34:57,785 --> 00:35:03,875
When you're young, everybody's 
 always telling you you'll change.

359
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:10,423
- Are you dining with us tonight? 
 - I have a previous engagement.

360
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:13,551
Oh? With whom?

361
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:16,221
My cousin, Princess Hélene.

362
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:22,101
Oh. I'd like to be like her 
 when I grow up.

363
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:24,896
I'd have to fill out around here, though.

364
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:29,526
Tall, proud, beautiful, cold 
 and untouchable.

365
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:33,196
With regiments of men 
 dropping at my feet.

366
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:38,076
I'm going to marry her, Natasha.

367
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,412
Gently, gently.

368
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,210
Who's surrendering his sword, 
 you or she?

369
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:53,716
Be happy, dearest Pierre.

370
00:35:57,178 --> 00:36:01,474
I order you to be supremely happy.

371
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:25,999
I'll be leaving again directly. Wait.

372
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:38,344
I must deliver a message 
 to General Kutuzov immediately.

373
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,638
Well, I...

374
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:45,268
There's the General's aide. 
 Talk to him, Ensign.

375
00:36:45,393 --> 00:36:48,271
I've just come from the picket lines.

376
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:51,357
I've a message 
 for the Commander-in-Chief.

377
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:55,236
His Excellency is in a council of war. 
 Give me the message.

378
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:57,113
A verbal message.

379
00:36:57,238 --> 00:37:00,283
Deliver it to me now.

380
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:05,997
My squadron is on picket duty. 
 We saw the French put out their fires.

381
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:10,210
- The enemy's on the move, sir. 
 - Is that all?

382
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:13,504
Is that all?

383
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:18,092
I'd say you've seen no action yet, 
 am I right?

384
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:24,599
Good luck, my friend.

385
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:28,019
...it's apparent the enemy 
 has regrouped his position.

386
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:34,400
Surely now, you should consider 
 changing the orders for tomorrow.

387
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:39,405
Or rather for today, 
 for it is past midnight.

388
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:41,741
Gentlemen...

389
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:52,126
Gentlemen, the orders for tomorrow 
 cannot now be altered.

390
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:59,759
You've heard them, 
 and we shall all do our duty.

391
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:06,224
But, before a battle, 
 there is nothing more important...

392
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,728
...than to have a good sleep.

393
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:15,316
Goodnight.

394
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:18,361
- Goodnight, sir. 
 - Goodnight, sir.

395
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:21,447
- Goodnight, sir. 
 - Goodnight, sir.

396
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:37,213
But, sir, if the French are 
 that far south of Austerlitz...

397
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:39,841
Plans!

398
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:45,221
After the battle, they'll have a hundred 
 reasons why the plans didn't work.

399
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:48,057
They'll blame everything 
 but themselves.

400
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:51,978
How do you think it will go tomorrow?

401
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:57,442
I think the battle will be lost.

402
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:07,118
We shall not have lost the war, 
 Andrei, because of this one battle.

403
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:09,370
There will be a peace...

404
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:13,166
...and then a new war.

405
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:16,044
Men like Napoleon can never stop

406
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:19,339
till their own ambition destroys them.

407
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:25,470
The only important battle is the last.

408
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:27,722
Goodnight.

409
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:35,939
Fire!

410
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:49,702
Sir, it looks as if the French 
 have broken our flank.

411
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:55,875
Captain, the Hussars must charge.

412
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:52,891
- You're wounded. 
 - The wound's not here, it's there!

413
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:57,145
Stop them!

414
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:01,441
Stop those cowards, Bolkonsky!

415
00:41:08,323 --> 00:41:11,492
Forward, lads! Forward!

416
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:15,079
Forward!

417
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,957
Forward, lads! Forward!

418
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:49,447
That is a fine death.

419
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:52,909
Oh, he is alive!

420
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:58,748
Have him attended to 
 and take him to my bivouac.

421
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:01,834
Let my doctor examine his wounds.

422
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,203
- So early in the morning, Pierre. 
 - It's 11 o'clock.

423
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:42,917
- So early! 
 - We have a lot of shopping to do.

424
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:45,503
Oh, Pierre, I'm so tired.

425
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:49,841
All right, I'll go myself 
 and come back early.

426
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:56,556
- The morning papers, sir. 
 - Thank you.

427
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:09,736
- Anything amusing in "The Gazette?" 
 - No, we've lost again.

428
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:13,072
An armistice is going to be discussed.

429
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:17,368
Prisoners and wounded on both sides 
 will be immediately returned.

430
00:43:17,493 --> 00:43:21,247
In a word, we're suing for peace.

431
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:25,460
- You sound bitter. 
 - Maybe I am.

432
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:31,758
What difference does it make, 
 a piece of Poland changes hands?

433
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:35,428
It's so boring 
 to worry about things like that!

434
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:39,515
- So, no more war. 
 - For the time being.

435
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:42,185
For the time being.

436
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:45,772
- Then the armies will be coming back. 
 - I suppose so.

437
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:48,858
Moscow will be very gay and exciting.

438
00:43:48,983 --> 00:43:53,238
Pierre, why don't we stay here 
 and not go to the country?

439
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:56,950
Not this year. 
 It'll be such a gay season.

440
00:43:57,075 --> 00:44:02,997
I'm not interested. Besides, I have 
 work at the hospital, the school.

441
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:08,795
They'll do just as well without you 
 in the hospital and the schools.

442
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,922
I promised those people.

443
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:14,842
Well, I never liked the idea!

444
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:18,054
Pierre, come here.

445
00:44:19,138 --> 00:44:22,809
Listen, you know what we can do?

446
00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:26,813
You go to the country all by yourself. 
 Do what you have to do.

447
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:31,901
Get the house ready, 
 then I'll join you in the spring.

448
00:44:32,026 --> 00:44:35,488
The country's so dreary in the winter.

449
00:44:35,613 --> 00:44:38,283
Please don't force it on me, Pierre.

450
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:42,453
If you must stay, stay, 
 but I'll be lost without you there.

451
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,791
Nonsense. 
 It will be good for the both of us.

452
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:51,379
And you'll appreciate me more when 
 you haven't seen me for some time.

453
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:55,717
I couldn't appreciate you more, Hélene.

454
00:44:57,093 --> 00:45:02,849
If you only knew how many things 
 I have to do, dresses to have made,

455
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:05,101
lots of shoes and...

456
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:10,273
Why are you looking at me 
 like that? Why?

457
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:15,445
What does it mean?

458
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,697
Nothing, my dear.

459
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:36,216
They were defeated. 
 What are they cheering about?

460
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:41,971
Because they fought, because they're 
 alive, because they've come home.

461
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:57,237
I hope nothing's happened.

462
00:45:57,362 --> 00:46:01,658
- Gracious! The young Captain! 
 - Prokofy!

463
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:04,118
Prokofy, is everything all right?

464
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:08,122
- The Lord be thanked. Yes. 
 - Good!

465
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,252
Nicholas!

466
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:14,546
Natasha!

467
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:20,552
You're back! 
 It's you, my dearest Nicholas!

468
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:25,098
Sonya!

469
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:29,561
- Look, it's him! 
 - Nicholas! Hurray!

470
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:36,776
- Papa! 
 - Nicholas!

471
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:39,028
Nicholas!

472
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,911
Nicholas...

473
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:50,456
Mama.

474
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:02,510
- You must be...? 
 - Your son's friend.

475
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:06,723
I know, Nicholas wrote to us. 
 Natasha, Sonya!

476
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:08,975
Welcome.

477
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:13,521
- Welcome. 
 - Sonya, it's wonderful!

478
00:47:13,646 --> 00:47:18,067
Nicholas! 
 You haven't said hello to Sonya yet.

479
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:26,159
What's the sense of coming home 
 from a war, if that's all you do?

480
00:47:37,503 --> 00:47:41,132
- Good morning. 
 - Ah, my pipe.

481
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:44,844
Rostov, wake up!

482
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:50,141
- Why, is it late? 
 - "It's 10 o'clock. Get up, Nicholas!"

483
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:52,393
Directly.

484
00:47:55,313 --> 00:47:59,943
Is this your sabre? Or yours? 
 Get back, you Frenchman!

485
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,282
- Here I come! 
 - At last!

486
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:13,748
Why did you stay in bed so long? 
 I've been waiting for you to get up.

487
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:20,296
You're quite a man, aren't you? 
 I'm awfully glad you're my brother.

488
00:48:20,421 --> 00:48:25,426
I want to know what men are like. 
 Are you the same as all of them?

489
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:32,058
- Natasha... Sonya's so young. 
 - Sonya's my dearest friend.

490
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:36,646
If she loves someone, she does it 
 for life. She loves us like that.

491
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:42,151
Remember before you went away? 
 She told me you're to forget all that.

492
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:49,576
"I will love him always, but let him 
 be free." Isn't that lovely and noble?

493
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:54,622
- I'll never go back on my word. 
 - But it won't do.

494
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:58,209
Because if you marry her 
 because of a promise,

495
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:04,632
it'll seem you're marrying her because 
 you must, and that wouldn't be right.

496
00:49:04,757 --> 00:49:09,929
We'll talk it over later. 
 I'm so glad I have you!

497
00:49:10,054 --> 00:49:15,560
- Are you still true to Pierre? 
 - Don't be silly!

498
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:19,939
I'll be a dancer and never marry. 
 Don't tell anyone.

499
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:24,152
Get dressed and we'll have breakfast.

500
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:36,206
Andrei!

501
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,585
Did you get my letter?

502
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,172
I met the doctor at the last relay point. 
 Are we in time?

503
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:50,178
- Let's hope so. We must pray for her. 
 - What a strange fate.

504
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:12,825
My darling, God is merciful.

505
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:16,788
I love you. I love you all.

506
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:20,333
I've never done any harm to anyone.

507
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:24,254
Why must I suffer so? 
 Andrei, please help me!

508
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:28,383
My boy, you have to leave now.

509
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,431
There, there, my dear.

510
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:50,256
No... no!

511
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:41,307
Upon my word, Rostov, 
 if I were to see fifty more operas,

512
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:45,103
I wager I might wind up liking them!

513
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,398
But... I do like the intermissions.

514
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,029
- I say, Rostov, that one, there. 
 - Yes?

515
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:57,115
She's superb.

516
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:02,704
But wait. Well!

517
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:05,999
- Where's the husband? 
 - Pierre...

518
00:53:06,124 --> 00:53:10,587
He spends most of his time 
 in the country nowadays.

519
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:15,008
If I were the husband,

520
00:53:15,133 --> 00:53:18,469
I'd come up from the country fast!

521
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:52,420
To the Emperor!

522
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:06,851
Listen, we took the bear 
 to the house of that actress,

523
00:54:06,976 --> 00:54:09,479
and when the police tried to arrest us,

524
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:12,815
we tied one of them 
 on the back of the bear

525
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:16,486
and shoved them both into the river!

526
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:20,573
There they were, both swimming, 
 the man and the bear.

527
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:25,203
- Wake up! The party's still young! 
 - Don't be rough with him.

528
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,706
Always be polite to the husbands 
 of pretty women.

529
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,793
Let's drink to the health 
 of beautiful women!

530
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:37,131
Yes, to the health 
 of lovely women, huh, Pierre?

531
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:39,175
And to their lovers!

532
00:54:44,472 --> 00:54:50,353
Here, look at this. It's a new song 
 written about General Kutuzov.

533
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,649
- That interests me. 
 - What?

534
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:58,111
I said that interests me.

535
00:55:23,177 --> 00:55:26,264
Express your regrets 
 and he'll accept them.

536
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,601
No. What is there to talk about? 
 Is everything ready?

537
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,771
- No apologies. 
 - First, tell me how to use this thing.

538
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,233
It's very simple. 
 You cock it, there's the trigger.

539
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:39,652
Yes, I know, I just forgot.

540
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:44,574
No apologies. None whatever.

541
00:55:52,457 --> 00:55:56,044
On the count of three, 
 begin to advance.

542
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:03,426
One, two, three.

543
00:56:20,151 --> 00:56:22,403
Get away from here!

544
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,739
It's not over!

545
00:56:32,914 --> 00:56:35,750
To your barrier! Stay where you are!

546
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:42,507
Cover yourself, you fool!

547
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:23,214
Well, now, the hero! 
 The dashing duellist!

548
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,801
My protector! 
 Thank you for defending my honour.

549
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:32,098
You believed that Dolokhov 
 was my lover. What did you prove?

550
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:37,687
That you are a fool! Now I'll be 
 the laughing stock of all Moscow!

551
00:57:37,812 --> 00:57:40,440
Everyone will say 
 that you were drunk.

552
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:44,319
Challenging a man that 
 you were jealous of, without cause!

553
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:50,325
A man that is a better man 
 than you are in every way!

554
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,995
- We'd better separate. 
 - Separate?

555
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,082
That's a charming idea! 
 It's a wonderful idea!

556
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,920
It's the best idea you've had 
 in your whole life!

557
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,465
We'll separate, but you will pay for it!

558
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,676
You'll give me a fortune for it!

559
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,511
No!

560
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:16,309
Get out!

561
00:58:22,148 --> 00:58:25,318
The count is waiting for you upstairs.

562
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:47,590
- What have you heard? 
 - Dolokhov won't die.

563
00:58:47,715 --> 00:58:49,842
Thank God.

564
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,305
It's only easier to kill good men.

565
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:58,601
Men like Dolokhov 
 are only good for wars.

566
00:58:58,726 --> 00:59:04,732
In between wars, they ought 
 to be locked up in cages. Here.

567
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:06,860
I'd like to leave Moscow.

568
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:13,283
I want to get away from these people 
 who believe it's normal to kill.

569
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:18,580
At the banquet, 
 when Dolokhov made the toast,

570
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,875
I looked across at him smiling at me,

571
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,752
I was convinced 
 of the guilt of my wife.

572
00:59:24,878 --> 00:59:29,215
Is that a reason to kill? 
 Hélene was guilty, not Dolokhov.

573
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:34,429
I might have done the same thing. 
 Maybe it's even certain.

574
00:59:35,346 --> 00:59:40,977
There we were, in the snow, 
 facing each other with pistols.

575
00:59:41,102 --> 00:59:46,024
- You know who's guilty? I, only I. 
 - Pierre, don't be silly.

576
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:50,862
And you know why? Because 
 I married her without loving her.

577
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:54,574
I had to have her, 
 so I made myself blind.

578
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:58,912
I lied when I said to her, "I love you."

579
00:59:59,037 --> 01:00:01,456
Because of that

580
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:05,835
there's Dolokhov stretched in pain, 
 alive only by the grace of God.

581
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,673
Because of my weakness, my lie. 
 I'm guilty. I must suffer for it.

582
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:16,679
You must stop thinking like this, 
 or it'll become an obsession.

583
01:00:16,804 --> 01:00:23,269
Look, if you'll agree, 
 we'll all go to our place in the country.

584
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:27,982
And Nicholas wants to show it 
 to Denisov. Come with us?

585
01:00:28,107 --> 01:00:32,111
Of course you'll come. 
 I'll tell the family. Mama!

586
01:00:33,112 --> 01:00:40,453
Natasha, Sonya, Petya! Hurry! 
 We start for the country tonight.

587
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:44,123
Why didn't you tell me 
 Pierre was here?

588
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:47,252
We must start while the moon is high.

589
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:51,673
Ilya, what has happened? 
 What moon are you speaking of?

590
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:56,970
Is there more than one, my pet? 
 How long must we wait for Nicholas?

591
01:00:57,095 --> 01:01:02,517
I'm happy you made up your mind. 
 The snow will be gone tomorrow!

592
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:05,478
Sonya, hurry.

593
01:01:05,603 --> 01:01:08,731
- Order the troikas. 
 - Immediately!

594
01:01:08,857 --> 01:01:14,112
We're off! Hurry, Nicholas, 
 you're delaying the trip to the country.

595
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:18,825
- The country? 
 - You can show Denisov. Come on!

596
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,705
- You'll like this. 
 - I was just beginning to enjoy Moscow!

597
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,878
Faster, faster, faster!

598
01:01:30,503 --> 01:01:32,797
Faster, Nitka!

599
01:01:35,675 --> 01:01:40,930
{y:i}As we ride in the troika, you and I 
 {y:i}Stars are twinkling up in the sky

600
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:48,521
{y:i}Strains of sweet balalaika soft and low 
 {y:i}Sleigh bells tinkling across the snow

601
01:01:54,819 --> 01:01:58,823
{y:i}Hold me close and kiss me, Katiusha 
 {y:i}Let's be happy and gay, hey!

602
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,658
{y:i}When I'm gone you'll miss me, Katiusha

603
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,536
{y:i}Miss me many a day!

604
01:02:05,663 --> 01:02:07,832
Nicholas!

605
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:12,378
- Come on, Pierre, it's your turn now! 
 - Hurry, hurry!

606
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:15,924
Young Nicholas!

607
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,566
Petya!

608
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:16,943
Ever since Nicholas joined the army, 
 he's become terribly efficient.

609
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:20,363
- I quite agree with you. 
 - Just a minute...

610
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:26,202
That's my friend, Prince Andrei 
 Bolkonsky. Can he join us?

611
01:03:26,327 --> 01:03:29,289
- By all means! 
 - Do ask him.

612
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,170
Come on, Natasha!

613
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:46,222
Greetings! Good to see you. 
 I didn't know you were in the country.

614
01:03:46,347 --> 01:03:49,267
The Rostovs invite you 
 to join the hunt.

615
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:54,189
I'm afraid anyone else's society would 
 give me more pain than pleasure.

616
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,738
Prince Andrei, may I present 
 the Countess Rostova.

617
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:04,282
And her brother, Petya Rostov.

618
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:09,037
I hope Pierre's convinced you to come. 
 It's the year's best hunt.

619
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:15,752
The huntsman's found a wolf 
 and cubs. We'd be so delighted if...

620
01:04:15,877 --> 01:04:19,380
What I mean is you would enjoy it.

621
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:22,300
Perhaps I'll join you later.

622
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,969
- And stay to dinner? 
 - Possibly.

623
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:27,096
But you just said...

624
01:04:27,222 --> 01:04:30,225
- Shall I come now? 
 - Wonderful!

625
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:37,292
- I'm glad you stayed tonight. 
 - So am I.

626
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:40,044
- The Rostovs are charming, no? 
 - Charming.

627
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,172
It's wonderful to watch them together,

628
01:05:43,298 --> 01:05:46,593
like a race of handsome, healthy, 
 thoughtless animals.

629
01:05:46,718 --> 01:05:49,971
- Thoughtless? 
 - Their most charming characteristic.

630
01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:52,265
- All of them? 
 - All of them.

631
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,975
No.

632
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,146
Within a year or two, 
 Natasha will begin to think.

633
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,859
It'll make her even more charming 
 but less of a Rostov. Follow?

634
01:06:02,984 --> 01:06:04,861
I think so.

635
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:11,993
Andrei, I think it's bad for you, 
 it's wrong to stay down here,

636
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:16,915
year after year, brooding, 
 living the life of a hermit.

637
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,250
Bad? Wrong?

638
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,714
Only two things in this life 
 are really wrong, Pierre,

639
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:29,052
remorse and illness, and 
 when I've recovered from them both,

640
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:34,599
- I'll go out in the world again. 
 - Why are you remorseful?

641
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,018
I was too late.

642
01:06:37,143 --> 01:06:39,979
I let Lise die feeling unloved.

643
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:46,694
I was too busy on the trail of glory 
 to take the time to comfort my wife.

644
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:50,323
Well, I found glory.

645
01:06:50,448 --> 01:06:53,701
I stopped the retreat of 100 men 
 for five minutes.

646
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:58,706
I was left for dead on a lost battlefield 
 in a lost war.

647
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:04,420
I'll stop being a hermit, 
 when I can forget all those things.

648
01:07:06,464 --> 01:07:10,635
Well, I think I'd better go to bed now.

649
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,887
Goodnight, Pierre.

650
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,185
And thank you again.

651
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,437
Goodnight, Andrei.

652
01:07:33,408 --> 01:07:38,746
- Natasha, come to bed, you'll catch cold! 
 - I can't sleep.

653
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:43,084
After a day like this, 
 it's impossible to sleep.

654
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:47,422
Come and see the moon. 
 Look how glorious it is.

655
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,926
- Sonya? 
 - Yes?

656
01:07:52,051 --> 01:07:56,014
- Do you think Prince Andrei likes us? 
 - Of course.

657
01:07:56,139 --> 01:08:01,185
He's so silent. It's as though 
 he's passing judgement on us.

658
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:04,606
- I'm frightened of him, aren't you? 
 - No.

659
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:10,445
I'm a little frightened, and yet 
 I wanted to take him by the hand,

660
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:13,740
look in his eyes and sing just for him.

661
01:08:13,865 --> 01:08:18,745
Poor man, he'd never come again 
 if I'd done that.

662
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:23,041
Did you notice 
 he almost never smiles?

663
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,753
While I was singing, 
 I caught him looking at me.

664
01:08:26,878 --> 01:08:29,839
He was smiling then.

665
01:08:29,964 --> 01:08:34,469
And I felt... 
 It's almost impossible to describe.

666
01:08:35,303 --> 01:08:40,934
I felt as if someone had given me 
 the most enormous, beautiful present.

667
01:08:41,059 --> 01:08:45,605
- Come to bed, Natasha. 
 - You try to spoil everything!

668
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:52,570
On a night like this, I feel like 
 hugging myself tight and flying away!

669
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,448
- Take care, you'll fall. 
 - All right.

670
01:08:55,573 --> 01:08:58,952
But it's a shame to go in 
 on such a night.

671
01:08:59,077 --> 01:09:01,246
It's like hearing wonderful music,

672
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:08,336
and you know it's going to be 
 the most beautiful you've ever heard.

673
01:09:08,461 --> 01:09:12,674
And being pulled away 
 and missing it for ever.

674
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:19,389
- For ever. 
 - Natasha!

675
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,767
All right.

676
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:50,920
- Nicholas, the expression on my face. 
 - What about it?

677
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:54,090
- Do I look disdainful? 
 - No!

678
01:09:54,215 --> 01:09:58,136
- I'm sure I look disdainful. 
 - What for?

679
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:04,559
If I look disdainful, nobody will 
 notice this is my first ever ball.

680
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:10,148
- How's this? Better? 
 - That's much better.

681
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:12,400
Good.

682
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:27,415
You must promise 
 not to dance with me.

683
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:33,713
- No! 
 - No matter if no one says a word to me.

684
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:39,219
- Promise not to dance with me. 
 - Why?

685
01:10:39,344 --> 01:10:45,225
Because it would be humiliating 
 if only my brother asks me to dance...

686
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,852
...out of pity.

687
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,355
- Promise? 
 - I promise.

688
01:11:07,747 --> 01:11:12,961
- Nicholas, is everybody looking at me? 
 - Can't you see for yourself?

689
01:11:13,086 --> 01:11:16,506
Not without changing the expression 
 on my face.

690
01:11:16,631 --> 01:11:22,262
- There's one awful thing about you. 
 - Tell me! The whole truth!

691
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:26,599
No girl I'll ever meet 
 will be able to amuse me like you.

692
01:11:26,724 --> 01:11:30,270
Don't talk like that. 
 Go and leave us to our fate.

693
01:11:30,395 --> 01:11:34,315
- Nicholas, look after your mother. 
 - Comfortable, Mother?

694
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,568
Yes, my darling.

695
01:12:16,858 --> 01:12:19,360
{y:i}What a horrible mistake.

696
01:12:19,485 --> 01:12:24,032
{y:i}I shouldn't have come. 
 {y:i}Nothing is going to happen.

697
01:12:24,157 --> 01:12:30,413
{y:i}The night is going to be one horrible, 
 {y:i}black, degrading zero.

698
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:35,418
Count Denilov, meet my family.

699
01:12:35,543 --> 01:12:38,963
Madame Maria Peronskaya. 
 You know my wife.

700
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:43,384
My niece, Sonya, 
 and my daughter, Natasha.

701
01:12:43,509 --> 01:12:45,637
May I have the pleasure?

702
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,235
Oh, dear.

703
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:12,580
Perhaps I shall be more fortunate 
 later on. I shall try again.

704
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:18,294
- "Adieu." 
 - "Au revoir."

705
01:13:18,419 --> 01:13:22,340
Denilov is our hostess' first cousin, 
 worth millions!

706
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,259
Second cousin, dear.

707
01:13:24,384 --> 01:13:29,973
Ah, there's the French ambassador! 
 He looks as if he were a king.

708
01:13:30,098 --> 01:13:35,353
You're rather late, you know? 
 Most of my dances are gone.

709
01:13:49,367 --> 01:13:53,454
{y:i}Why must I keep thinking 
 {y:i}of Prince Andrei?

710
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:59,294
{y:i}Am I so much in love with him 
 {y:i}that all others seem ridiculous?

711
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:06,134
{y:i}We saw so little of each other, 
 {y:i}and yet I remember every moment.

712
01:14:06,259 --> 01:14:09,929
{y:i}If only he could have 
 {y:i}brought me here tonight.

713
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:12,432
{y:i}Why doesn't he like the city?

714
01:14:12,557 --> 01:14:16,561
{y:i}It isn't right for a man 
 {y:i}to shut himself off as he does.

715
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:19,856
I am so delighted to see you again.

716
01:14:26,446 --> 01:14:29,699
Will you honour me with this dance?

717
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:34,829
- Pierre, nice to see you. 
 - Pierre, my boy.

718
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:38,124
Will you honour me with this dance?

719
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:47,944
- Don't you just love dances? 
 - Not ordinarily.

720
01:15:48,069 --> 01:15:52,782
- This is my first in two years. 
 - I'm so glad you did come.

721
01:15:52,907 --> 01:16:01,249
I mean... Mama and Papa said it was 
 nice for you to visit after the hunt...

722
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:05,336
Tell them I intend to come and visit often.

723
01:16:05,461 --> 01:16:09,382
- Very often, if they'll permit me. 
 - I shall tell them.

724
01:16:09,507 --> 01:16:15,847
On moonlit nights, do you still want 
 to fly off to the moon?

725
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:22,061
- Where did you hear? 
 - My window was just below yours.

726
01:16:23,855 --> 01:16:27,025
What a disaster! You heard everything.

727
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:30,320
No. You disappeared too soon.

728
01:16:34,032 --> 01:16:37,911
- You must think I'm an utter idiot. 
 - No.

729
01:16:38,036 --> 01:16:41,080
I don't think you're an idiot. I think...

730
01:16:41,206 --> 01:16:45,418
Permit me. May I have 
 the pleasure of this dance?

731
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,965
Thank you.

732
01:17:10,151 --> 01:17:13,029
{y:i}What a joy it is to dance with her.

733
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:16,407
{y:i}Like holding springtime in your arms.

734
01:17:16,533 --> 01:17:20,495
{y:i}Like holding a branch of lilac, 
 {y:i}or a kitten.

735
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,581
{y:i}Look at her now.

736
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:32,840
{y:i}If she looks back at me 
 {y:i}and smiles on the next turn,

737
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:35,969
{y:i}she'll be my wife.

738
01:18:03,955 --> 01:18:07,125
Guide us with thine infinite wisdom...

739
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:12,171
...teach us to abide in thy mercy,

740
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:18,636
and if it be thy will, 
 let this bed be my grave.

741
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:23,641
- I must talk to you just once more. 
 - Well, well...

742
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:27,979
It's about Prince Andrei, I suppose?

743
01:18:29,147 --> 01:18:33,610
Thursday, Friday, 
 Saturday, Sunday, Monday...

744
01:18:33,735 --> 01:18:36,237
Five days he hasn't been heard from.

745
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:40,408
First, he comes to see me every day 
 and quite turns my head,

746
01:18:40,533 --> 01:18:42,452
then nothing happens.

747
01:18:42,577 --> 01:18:46,497
Now, I'll tell you about myself 
 when I was young.

748
01:18:46,623 --> 01:18:50,293
I had a cousin, 
 a handsome young man.

749
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:52,670
Yes, really handsome.

750
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:55,965
I know. Cyril Matveich.

751
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:01,346
- Must everything end up in nothing? 
 - You're being impulsive.

752
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:04,641
You must be patient. Very patient.

753
01:19:04,766 --> 01:19:09,979
Wait till a proper proposal has been 
 made to you. He'll show up.

754
01:19:10,104 --> 01:19:13,858
The last time, his proposal was 
 on the tip of his tongue.

755
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:16,903
He seemed so in love.

756
01:19:17,028 --> 01:19:21,783
I'm always a little afraid 
 in his presence. What does it mean?

757
01:19:21,908 --> 01:19:24,786
Does it mean that it's real love?

758
01:19:24,911 --> 01:19:28,164
- Are you asleep? 
 - No, my pet.

759
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm a little frightened myself.

760
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:35,713
- Now go. 
 - All the same, I shan't sleep.

761
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:39,092
Such a thing has never happened 
 to me before.

762
01:19:39,217 --> 01:19:42,512
Could we ever 
 have thought it last spring

763
01:19:42,637 --> 01:19:46,558
that we should meet at the ball? 
 It must be fate.

764
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:51,187
Clearly, it must be fate, 
 if everything led up to this.

765
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:53,940
Need one be ashamed of a widower?

766
01:19:54,065 --> 01:20:00,655
No, darling, pray to God. 
 Marriages are made in heaven.

767
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:05,159
Mama, how I love you. I'm so happy!

768
01:20:06,661 --> 01:20:09,414
Little Countess, are you asleep?

769
01:20:11,082 --> 01:20:14,586
Yes, dear, I'm asleep. Goodnight.

770
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:21,843
Marry? Marry?

771
01:20:21,968 --> 01:20:25,513
As though life were not 
 complicated enough as it is!

772
01:20:25,638 --> 01:20:31,352
In such a hurry! You thought you 
 knew what you were doing last time!

773
01:20:31,477 --> 01:20:34,480
- This is completely different. 
 - It always is!

774
01:20:34,606 --> 01:20:40,445
Before I met her, life was sad, 
 meaningless, hopeless.

775
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:46,201
When you're over thirty, a man's life 
 should be sad and hopeless!

776
01:20:46,326 --> 01:20:49,704
- Father... 
 - All right, all right.

777
01:20:49,829 --> 01:20:52,874
Let's be reasonable.

778
01:20:52,999 --> 01:20:58,296
Her family is nothing. 
 Nothing, compared to the Bolkonskys.

779
01:20:59,172 --> 01:21:04,928
Her father was known 
 to chase every woman in Moscow.

780
01:21:05,053 --> 01:21:07,680
Without success!

781
01:21:07,805 --> 01:21:09,974
Now that he's grown older,

782
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:14,562
he's known to play 
 in every card game in Moscow.

783
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:16,814
Equally without success!

784
01:21:17,398 --> 01:21:20,693
They're a happy family. 
 That's a success, too.

785
01:21:20,818 --> 01:21:24,030
Perhaps the greatest success.

786
01:21:24,155 --> 01:21:28,117
But you think 
 you're being fair to the girl?

787
01:21:28,243 --> 01:21:32,455
You're much older than she. 
 You have a son to bring up.

788
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:37,710
Who'll take the responsibility? 
 A little chit of a girl?

789
01:21:38,711 --> 01:21:44,634
I beg of you, put it off for just one year 
 and go abroad.

790
01:21:44,759 --> 01:21:51,849
There's a peace mission to Prussia 
 for the signing of a treaty.

791
01:21:51,975 --> 01:21:55,645
I know you wanted to go 
 on the mission.

792
01:21:55,770 --> 01:22:02,277
After a year, if you still have this love 
 or obstinacy, you marry her.

793
01:22:02,402 --> 01:22:07,240
That is my last word on the subject. 
 It's my last word!

794
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:26,509
{y:i}Is it possible that I, Natasha, will be 
 {y:i}the wife of this strange, dear man,

795
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:29,053
{y:i}whom even my father looks up to?

796
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:34,559
{y:i}Can it be true that there can be 
 {y:i}no more playing with life?

797
01:22:34,684 --> 01:22:40,982
{y:i}That on me now lies the responsibility 
 {y:i}of my every word and deed?

798
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:57,665
I have loved you 
 from the first moment I saw you.

799
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:06,591
- Do you love me? 
 - Yes, yes!

800
01:23:23,525 --> 01:23:27,153
What is it? What's the matter?

801
01:23:28,196 --> 01:23:30,323
I'm so happy.

802
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,796
- Did your mother explain? 
 - There's nothing to explain.

803
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:51,135
She told you it can't be for a year? 
 You're young, I want you to be sure.

804
01:23:51,261 --> 01:23:56,599
- I am sure. 
 - One year's not long and you'll be free.

805
01:23:56,724 --> 01:24:01,312
Lf, within that year, 
 you find you don't love me...

806
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:04,941
Don't say anything like that again!

807
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:10,905
- A year? I'm not going to see you? 
 - Of course.

808
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:16,244
- I must go to Poland for a few months. 
 - Is there nothing that can be done?

809
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:20,874
It's awful, I'll die waiting a year! 
 It's impossible, it's...!

810
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:26,045
No. I'll do anything, whatever you say.

811
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:29,215
We have the rest of our lives!

812
01:24:33,511 --> 01:24:38,474
{y:i}At Tilsit in Prussia, 
 {y:i}on June 13th 1807,

813
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,477
{y:i}Napoleon met with 
 {y:i}Emperor Alexander of Russia,

814
01:24:41,603 --> 01:24:45,815
{y:i}for the purpose 
 {y:i}of discussing a treaty of peace.

815
01:25:06,711 --> 01:25:09,172
{y:i}They can't help liking me.

816
01:25:09,297 --> 01:25:12,300
{y:i}I'm so willing 
 {y:i}to do anything they wish.

817
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:18,723
{y:i}So ready to be fond of him 
 {y:i}for being his father.

818
01:25:24,145 --> 01:25:28,983
- I'm Mary Bolkonsky. 
 - Charmed. My daughter, Natasha.

819
01:25:29,108 --> 01:25:32,362
- How do you do? 
 - Good afternoon.

820
01:25:32,487 --> 01:25:38,451
Excuse my father. He's not well 
 and asks me to welcome you.

821
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:45,083
Some tea?

822
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:49,003
- That would be... 
 - No, thank you.

823
01:25:49,128 --> 01:25:51,256
No, thank you.

824
01:25:57,303 --> 01:26:00,598
I suppose you've heard from Andrei?

825
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:03,101
Yes.

826
01:26:04,143 --> 01:26:06,062
Father!

827
01:26:07,063 --> 01:26:09,899
You're the young Countess Rostov.

828
01:26:10,024 --> 01:26:13,236
I didn't know 
 you were paying me a visit.

829
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:17,365
Excuse my costume, 
 I came to speak to Mary.

830
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:20,243
Why wasn't I told?

831
01:26:20,368 --> 01:26:26,416
Count Rostov? I've heard a great deal 
 about you, a great deal about you.

832
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:31,462
As the Lord is my witness, 
 nobody told me they were here.

833
01:26:31,588 --> 01:26:35,800
This house, utter confusion, chaos! 
 People coming and going.

834
01:26:35,925 --> 01:26:39,971
You can't find anything. 
 Even the papers in my desk.

835
01:26:40,096 --> 01:26:42,223
You must excuse me.

836
01:26:42,348 --> 01:26:45,310
I'm not prepared to entertain.

837
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:48,730
I can't stand Moscow, anyhow.

838
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:54,736
I wouldn't be here, except I've no 
 alternative. I'm forced to be here.

839
01:26:58,072 --> 01:27:01,367
We'd better leave now. Princess.

840
01:27:05,038 --> 01:27:07,624
Wait, I must talk to you.

841
01:27:07,749 --> 01:27:13,922
Dear Natasha, I'm certain my brother 
 has found happiness.

842
01:27:14,047 --> 01:27:19,093
Princess, I think it is not convenient 
 to speak of that now.

843
01:27:36,736 --> 01:27:42,033
Isn't it wonderful? 
 Aren't you glad you came?

844
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:46,371
Until Andrei comes back, 
 I can't be glad about anything.

845
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:48,706
It's only a few weeks.

846
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:53,294
- You see that tall man over there? 
 - What about him?

847
01:27:53,419 --> 01:27:57,632
When we passed, I heard him say, 
 "That's the Countess Rostov.

848
01:27:57,757 --> 01:28:01,761
"The one who's going to marry 
 Bolkonsky. Lucky man."

849
01:28:01,886 --> 01:28:06,015
- He said, "Lucky man"? 
 - "Lucky man."

850
01:28:07,767 --> 01:28:12,605
I must write that to Andrei. 
 He can tell his horrible father.

851
01:28:17,485 --> 01:28:20,113
- Countess Bezukhov has arrived. 
 - Bezukhov?

852
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:24,075
One of my favourites! 
 I must call on her.

853
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,288
Countess Bezukhov, I'm delighted 
 to see you back in Moscow.

854
01:28:28,413 --> 01:28:31,833
The city hasn't been the same 
 in your absence.

855
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:36,629
I've brought my two girls with me, 
 as you can see.

856
01:28:39,799 --> 01:28:41,718
Well...

857
01:28:44,596 --> 01:28:46,389
Magnificent woman!

858
01:28:46,514 --> 01:28:51,144
You can understand 
 how men must fall in love with her.

859
01:28:52,228 --> 01:28:55,773
Dolokhov, see the girl in that box?

860
01:28:55,899 --> 01:28:59,319
Yes, she's lovely, but...

861
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:06,534
...for you? No, Anatole, 
 she's not exactly your type.

862
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:41,588
May I borrow your daughter 
 to sit with me in the next act?

863
01:30:41,713 --> 01:30:45,800
Countess, how charming. 
 Natasha, come along.

864
01:30:45,925 --> 01:30:49,095
- Isn't it exciting? 
 - Yes.

865
01:30:55,476 --> 01:30:58,938
Enchanting! You mustn't bury her 
 in the country again.

866
01:30:59,063 --> 01:31:02,025
You're too kind. Natasha, sit down.

867
01:31:04,277 --> 01:31:07,530
Now we can tear 
 all our friends to pieces.

868
01:31:11,284 --> 01:31:18,708
No one in the theatre is talking 
 of anyone but you and your match.

869
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:22,587
- You know? 
 - It's the news of the season.

870
01:31:22,712 --> 01:31:24,756
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky!

871
01:31:24,881 --> 01:31:29,093
Every woman here is jealous of you 
 at this moment.

872
01:31:29,802 --> 01:31:32,639
Why, Anatole!

873
01:31:32,764 --> 01:31:37,060
May I present my brother? 
 Countess Natasha Rostov.

874
01:31:38,686 --> 01:31:41,481
He's the centre of fashion in Moscow.

875
01:31:41,606 --> 01:31:45,485
He drinks too much 
 and plays for too high stakes.

876
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:48,655
He also sees 
 the most amusing people.

877
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:52,033
Get him to tell you 
 everything to do this season.

878
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:55,245
- Countess! 
 - You've been neglecting me.

879
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:57,705
I was convinced you were dead.

880
01:31:57,830 --> 01:32:01,709
When I saw you at the ball, 
 six weeks ago,

881
01:32:01,834 --> 01:32:06,172
I thought, "What a pretty girl." 
 That's all I thought.

882
01:32:06,297 --> 01:32:08,967
But tonight...

883
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:13,429
- But you felt it, too? 
 - I felt...?

884
01:32:13,555 --> 01:32:19,852
When our eyes met. Don't look guilty. 
 What's there to be ashamed of?

885
01:32:21,688 --> 01:32:26,192
Are you enjoying the opera? 
 It's very good, isn't it?

886
01:32:26,317 --> 01:32:29,404
Oh, is it? I haven't noticed.

887
01:32:29,529 --> 01:32:33,199
I haven't looked at the stage tonight.

888
01:32:33,324 --> 01:32:37,954
I must see you again. 
 You must come to my sister's house.

889
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:40,623
Very soon.

890
01:32:40,748 --> 01:32:42,876
I think...

891
01:32:44,377 --> 01:32:49,674
My mother's in the country, 
 I may go up to be with her.

892
01:32:49,799 --> 01:32:51,926
She's enchanting.

893
01:33:03,938 --> 01:33:09,694
- Go away, Anatole, you'll distract us. 
 - All right, all right.

894
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:12,572
You'll come.

895
01:33:12,697 --> 01:33:16,075
I'll take this as a pledge.

896
01:33:21,122 --> 01:33:24,292
My brother is very amusing, isn't he?

897
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:07,919
Bravo, bravo!

898
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,589
How lovely she is.

899
01:34:11,714 --> 01:34:15,260
I don't think so when I look at you.

900
01:34:15,385 --> 01:34:17,595
Natasha, come!

901
01:34:21,891 --> 01:34:26,437
- Did you enjoy it? 
 - Yes, thank you.

902
01:34:28,815 --> 01:34:30,608
You're enchanting.

903
01:34:30,733 --> 01:34:35,989
From the moment I saw you, 
 I never ceased worshipping you.

904
01:34:37,949 --> 01:34:43,204
- I hope you don't think us too informal. 
 - Oh, Countess, well...

905
01:34:56,426 --> 01:34:59,596
I'm madly in love with you.

906
01:35:08,021 --> 01:35:11,858
- Papa, we must leave. 
 - We can't go now.

907
01:35:11,983 --> 01:35:16,654
...like one big heart, 
 palpitating with emotion.

908
01:35:16,779 --> 01:35:23,244
His Majesty the King was so moved, 
 tears came streaming down his face...

909
01:35:26,372 --> 01:35:28,833
My cloak, please.

910
01:35:57,904 --> 01:36:01,157
I can't. You know I can't.

911
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:57,922
{y:i}"Dearest Natasha, my fate has been 
 {y:i}sealed, to be loved by you or die.

912
01:36:58,047 --> 01:37:02,677
{y:i}"Your parents won't give you to me 
 {y:i}for reasons I will reveal only to you.

913
01:37:02,802 --> 01:37:07,181
{y:i}"But if you love me, 
 {y:i}you need only say the word yes.

914
01:37:07,307 --> 01:37:09,225
{y:i}"Anatole."

915
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,067
You're back.

916
01:37:19,986 --> 01:37:23,531
How was your evening? 
 Did you amuse yourself?

917
01:37:23,656 --> 01:37:28,328
Yes. I made excuses for you.

918
01:37:28,453 --> 01:37:32,081
I was worried about you. 
 How's your headache?

919
01:37:32,207 --> 01:37:34,876
- You read that letter. 
 - Yes.

920
01:37:35,001 --> 01:37:40,798
I'm glad. I couldn't keep it 
 from you any longer.

921
01:37:40,924 --> 01:37:44,219
- "You know we love one another." 
 - But Anatole Kuragin?

922
01:37:44,344 --> 01:37:46,930
- How happy I am. 
 - And Andrei?

923
01:37:47,055 --> 01:37:53,228
You don't know what love is. 
 You don't understand. Listen.

924
01:37:53,353 --> 01:37:57,565
How can you love a man for months 
 and suddenly...? Why?

925
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:00,485
You've only seen Anatole three times.

926
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:05,031
It seems to me 
 I've never loved anyone before.

927
01:38:05,156 --> 01:38:10,578
I've heard it's happened that way. 
 It's only now I feel such love.

928
01:38:10,745 --> 01:38:17,877
I felt he was my master and I his slave 
 and I couldn't help loving him.

929
01:38:18,002 --> 01:38:22,757
Yes, whatever he commands, 
 I must do. What can I do?

930
01:38:22,882 --> 01:38:26,761
If he loves you, why doesn't 
 he ask your father honestly

931
01:38:26,886 --> 01:38:29,597
for your engagement to be broken off?

932
01:38:29,722 --> 01:38:32,809
- Why all this secrecy? 
 - It doesn't matter.

933
01:38:32,934 --> 01:38:35,937
Whatever his reasons, 
 they are good ones.

934
01:38:36,062 --> 01:38:40,567
- I have no will, I love him. 
 - I won't let it come to that.

935
01:38:40,692 --> 01:38:42,318
I shall tell.

936
01:38:42,443 --> 01:38:48,324
You wouldn't tell anyone. Don't 
 torture me, I can't live without him!

937
01:38:48,449 --> 01:38:53,329
What are you saying? 
 Think about your father and Nicholas.

938
01:38:53,454 --> 01:38:57,083
I don't love anyone but him.

939
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:58,835
Go, Sonya.

940
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,172
I don't want to quarrel with you. 
 Go away!

941
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:15,059
Anatole, where do you mean to take her?

942
01:39:15,184 --> 01:39:20,315
They'll find out about that Polish girl 
 you had to marry. It'll mean jail.

943
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:27,906
It will be worth it. Even if it is for 
 one month or one week with that girl.

944
01:39:28,031 --> 01:39:32,577
Some things in life 
 are impossible not to have.

945
01:39:33,453 --> 01:39:39,083
- The driver you sent for. 
 - A drink. You have to drive far.

946
01:39:39,209 --> 01:39:42,879
- Get Metrevna to bring my cloak. 
 - A gypsy girl again?

947
01:39:43,004 --> 01:39:47,508
- An elopement. 
 - I like it. Romance, excitement!

948
01:39:47,634 --> 01:39:51,763
There is a priest waiting. 
 Don't let anyone stop you.

949
01:39:51,888 --> 01:39:55,475
There's a man for you!

950
01:39:56,976 --> 01:40:02,190
- You want me? 
 - Now, take this. Listen to me.

951
01:40:02,315 --> 01:40:06,819
The girl will be shivering, 
 she'll have forgotten everything.

952
01:40:06,945 --> 01:40:13,243
Wrap her up, or she'll stampede 
 back to the house for furs.

953
01:40:13,368 --> 01:40:18,831
Papa awakened, Mama screaming, 
 tears, recriminations, challenges!

954
01:40:18,957 --> 01:40:22,710
Always keep a young girl warm, 
 my boy.

955
01:40:22,835 --> 01:40:25,797
Up with the collar and whoosh!

956
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:31,761
- Take it. 
 - But my coat.

957
01:40:31,886 --> 01:40:34,681
I will get you another one someday.

958
01:40:34,806 --> 01:40:37,267
All take glasses!

959
01:40:37,392 --> 01:40:40,061
Now, comrade and friend of my youth,

960
01:40:40,186 --> 01:40:45,817
we've had our fling and revelled, 
 now farewell.

961
01:40:45,942 --> 01:40:48,820
- To your health. 
 - To your health!

962
01:40:51,739 --> 01:40:55,326
- How sad it is. 
 - Sure.

963
01:40:55,451 --> 01:41:00,540
- I still think you shouldn't do it. 
 - So do I.

964
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:35,325
Sonya? Sonya!

965
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:41,456
No, I won't open it. 
 And I've sent for Pierre.

966
01:41:43,249 --> 01:41:46,502
I'll hate you for ever for this. 
 Open the door.

967
01:41:46,628 --> 01:41:48,755
No, I won't open it.

968
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:14,697
- What's the matter with you? 
 - Your sister can't keep things quiet.

969
01:42:14,822 --> 01:42:18,201
- Things such as gossip. 
 - What?

970
01:42:18,326 --> 01:42:24,165
I know all about the money 
 you had to send to Poland and why.

971
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:28,378
- It's not true. 
 - You must leave Moscow.

972
01:42:28,503 --> 01:42:35,176
Don't tell anyone. Besides your 
 pleasure, there's others' happiness.

973
01:42:35,301 --> 01:42:38,555
You'll ruin a whole life 
 for your amusement.

974
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:44,477
Then amuse yourself with women 
 of your own rotten breed.

975
01:42:44,602 --> 01:42:48,565
As a man of honour, 
 you can't talk to me that way.

976
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:52,110
- Is it satisfaction you want? 
 - Yes.

977
01:42:52,235 --> 01:42:57,323
I take it back. I'd take it back, 
 I'd beg you for forgiveness.

978
01:42:57,448 --> 01:43:01,661
Drive this gentleman 
 wherever he wants to go.

979
01:43:26,603 --> 01:43:28,730
He's gone.

980
01:43:29,647 --> 01:43:32,567
She's in her room.

981
01:43:45,246 --> 01:43:50,210
- What are you doing here? 
 - I came to stop you.

982
01:43:51,502 --> 01:43:56,007
- Nothing will stop me. 
 - What do you plan to tell Andrei?

983
01:43:56,132 --> 01:44:01,846
- I wrote to him telling him everything. 
 - He's not good enough for you?

984
01:44:01,971 --> 01:44:07,018
You crawl after a gambler, a liar, 
 and a notorious womaniser!

985
01:44:07,143 --> 01:44:09,520
I'm going to marry him!

986
01:44:09,646 --> 01:44:14,275
Whatever he's told you, he's lying. 
 He's married already.

987
01:44:16,653 --> 01:44:18,947
It isn't true.

988
01:44:19,072 --> 01:44:21,366
Look at me, Natasha.

989
01:44:21,491 --> 01:44:24,327
Could I purposely deceive you?

990
01:45:02,782 --> 01:45:06,035
- The rumour's all over Moscow. 
 - Who started it?

991
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:09,455
Prince Andrei has sent back 
 all her letters.

992
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:15,044
- That's bad. I am sorry. 
 - She's been quite ill.

993
01:45:15,169 --> 01:45:20,341
When she knew you were coming, 
 she insisted upon getting up.

994
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:32,687
Don't tell her everything. One hasn't the 
 heart to scold her. She's to be pitied.

995
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,261
I hear he's in Moscow now.

996
01:46:08,348 --> 01:46:10,475
Ask him...

997
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:16,648
- Ask him to forgive me. 
 - I will tell him, but...

998
01:46:16,773 --> 01:46:19,901
I know that can never be.

999
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:22,362
All is over.

1000
01:46:22,487 --> 01:46:27,116
Only I'm so tormented 
 by the wrong I've done him.

1001
01:46:29,536 --> 01:46:31,454
Tell him...

1002
01:46:32,372 --> 01:46:38,294
Tell him I beg him to forgive... 
 forgive me for everything.

1003
01:46:43,049 --> 01:46:45,385
I will tell him everything.

1004
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:48,221
But remember I'm your friend.

1005
01:46:48,346 --> 01:46:52,517
If you want help 
 or to open your heart to someone,

1006
01:46:52,642 --> 01:46:56,938
not now, but when your mind is clearer, 
 think of me.

1007
01:46:57,063 --> 01:47:01,442
- I shall be happy if it's in my power. 
 - I'm not worth it.

1008
01:47:01,568 --> 01:47:04,195
No. You have your whole life 
 ahead of you.

1009
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,532
Ahead of me? No. All is over.

1010
01:47:07,657 --> 01:47:11,411
Nonsense, Natasha. 
 Listen to me, look.

1011
01:47:11,536 --> 01:47:16,457
Were I not myself, but the handsomest, 
 cleverest man in the world,

1012
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:18,585
and if I were free,

1013
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:25,008
I would not hesitate for one moment 
 to ask for your hand and your love.

1014
01:48:04,505 --> 01:48:09,469
- It's not cold, Mishka. 
 - It must be well below zero.

1015
01:48:09,594 --> 01:48:11,846
- Wonderful. 
 - Where to?

1016
01:48:11,971 --> 01:48:14,766
Where? I don't know, Mishka.

1017
01:48:14,891 --> 01:48:21,814
Are you looking at the comet, sir? 
 They say it means war and famine.

1018
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:27,070
- All sorts of woes. 
 - Nonsense. Life is beautiful. Go!

1019
01:48:27,195 --> 01:48:29,864
- Where to? The club? 
 - No.

1020
01:48:29,989 --> 01:48:33,743
- Home? 
 - No. Just go, Mishka!

1021
01:48:53,972 --> 01:48:58,977
"If Your Majesty wishes to avoid 
 shedding our people's blood

1022
01:48:59,102 --> 01:49:03,690
"and consents to the withdrawal 
 of Your Majesty's troops,

1023
01:49:03,815 --> 01:49:09,153
"I will forget what has happened 
 and agreement will be possible.

1024
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:14,200
"Otherwise, I shall be forced 
 to repel an aggression

1025
01:49:14,325 --> 01:49:17,662
"that has been 
 totally unprovoked by me.

1026
01:49:17,787 --> 01:49:22,959
"The decision whether to preserve 
 humanity from the disasters of war

1027
01:49:23,084 --> 01:49:26,379
"lies in Your Majesty's hands.

1028
01:49:26,504 --> 01:49:29,173
"I am, et cetera, Alexander."

1029
01:49:30,717 --> 01:49:34,637
So... this letter is very polite. 
 Very eloquent.

1030
01:49:34,762 --> 01:49:40,518
And it is full of fraternal expressions 
 of devotion from your Czar.

1031
01:49:40,643 --> 01:49:45,982
Sentiments, which, I assure you, 
 are reciprocated by me.

1032
01:49:46,107 --> 01:49:49,861
- However, in essence, Colonel... 
 - Bolkonsky.

1033
01:49:49,986 --> 01:49:53,781
...Bolkonsky, 
 what does this letter express?

1034
01:49:53,907 --> 01:50:00,830
It is not for me, as a mere messenger, 
 to express the wishes of the Czar.

1035
01:50:00,955 --> 01:50:06,211
Come, come, my dear fellow, 
 you must have an opinion. What...?

1036
01:50:11,049 --> 01:50:16,721
Where? Where have we met before? 
 Your face is familiar to me.

1037
01:50:17,263 --> 01:50:20,683
On the field at Austerlitz, sire.

1038
01:50:20,808 --> 01:50:23,686
Austerlitz... Austerlitz...?

1039
01:50:25,230 --> 01:50:27,774
Yes, I do remember.

1040
01:50:28,775 --> 01:50:32,612
You were lying 
 with a banner in your hand.

1041
01:50:32,737 --> 01:50:34,447
Yes, sire.

1042
01:50:34,572 --> 01:50:37,116
I thought you were dead!

1043
01:50:38,493 --> 01:50:43,122
Well, well, here you are again. 
 I'm glad to see you.

1044
01:50:43,248 --> 01:50:48,628
Now, Colonel, this letter, 
 what do you think it represents?

1045
01:50:48,753 --> 01:50:54,133
It can only represent 
 the Czar's sincere wish to avoid war

1046
01:50:54,259 --> 01:50:58,388
and to prevent the shedding 
 of both Russian and French blood.

1047
01:50:58,513 --> 01:51:02,892
A praiseworthy aim, 
 and one in which I completely concur.

1048
01:51:03,017 --> 01:51:08,439
However, what else 
 would you say was in this letter?

1049
01:51:08,565 --> 01:51:13,361
Since you press me, sire, 
 for a personal opinion, I would say

1050
01:51:13,486 --> 01:51:18,575
it is a request for the withdrawal 
 of your troops from our country.

1051
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:23,621
A personal opinion! That's how 
 the Czar told his messenger to put it.

1052
01:51:23,746 --> 01:51:27,709
You personally say withdrawal, do you? 
 Say retreat!

1053
01:51:27,834 --> 01:51:32,171
I'm a soldier and I use soldiers' words. 
 I am not a fool!

1054
01:51:32,297 --> 01:51:38,011
I've been asked to put my head into 
 a noose while my enemies conspire!

1055
01:51:38,136 --> 01:51:44,225
Sire, it is not my opinion when I say 
 the Czar is not your enemy

1056
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:48,563
and that he is not conspiring 
 against you.

1057
01:51:48,688 --> 01:51:51,858
If you read his letter carefully...

1058
01:51:56,988 --> 01:52:00,909
I will read the letter more carefully

1059
01:52:01,034 --> 01:52:04,787
and send the Czar my answer later.

1060
01:52:04,913 --> 01:52:08,082
Goodnight to you, Colonel.

1061
01:52:20,678 --> 01:52:25,475
Gentlemen, tomorrow at dawn 
 we cross the Neman into Russia.

1062
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:29,812
We'll talk of peace... in Moscow!

1063
01:52:36,611 --> 01:52:39,405
{y:i}And on 12th June 1812,

1064
01:52:39,531 --> 01:52:43,409
{y:i}Napoleon Bonaparte, at the head 
 {y:i}of an army of 200,000 men,

1065
01:52:43,535 --> 01:52:46,663
{y:i}crossed the River Neman into Russia.

1066
01:52:46,788 --> 01:52:49,791
{y:i}To combat this aggressive invasion 
 {y:i}of their homeland,

1067
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:55,380
{y:i}the Russians welcomed the French 
 {y:i}with a destroyed storehouse,

1068
01:52:55,505 --> 01:52:58,633
{y:i}a widely desolated land.

1069
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,518
Looting, burning!

1070
01:53:08,643 --> 01:53:14,732
As soon as Napoleon approaches, 
 the peasants run off with their grain.

1071
01:53:14,858 --> 01:53:17,986
What they can't take with them 
 they burn.

1072
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:25,451
If we don't put a stop to it somewhere, 
 it'll be a desert, a scorched earth!

1073
01:53:25,577 --> 01:53:30,415
We must fight. The army demands it, 
 the Czar demands it.

1074
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:33,710
And the people demand it!

1075
01:53:36,337 --> 01:53:41,175
What does the army want? 
 To be destroyed?

1076
01:53:42,135 --> 01:53:46,055
Because that would be 
 what would happen if we fought now.

1077
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:49,559
Does the Czar want 
 to be brought to his knees?

1078
01:53:49,684 --> 01:53:53,771
Because that would be 
 what would happen if we fought now.

1079
01:53:53,897 --> 01:53:58,401
What do the people want? 
 To be the subjects of Napoleon?

1080
01:53:58,526 --> 01:54:03,615
Because that would be 
 what would happen if we fought now.

1081
01:54:05,158 --> 01:54:08,203
Gentlemen, 
 I have been put in command

1082
01:54:08,328 --> 01:54:12,790
to give the army, the Czar 
 and the people what they want.

1083
01:54:12,916 --> 01:54:19,839
And what they want is to drive the last 
 Frenchman from the soil of Russia!

1084
01:54:19,964 --> 01:54:25,011
And that I propose to do when I can.

1085
01:54:25,136 --> 01:54:29,682
- But the looting and the burning... 
 - Let it continue!

1086
01:54:29,807 --> 01:54:31,935
Let it increase!

1087
01:54:47,158 --> 01:54:51,204
- Soon they'll be at our gates! 
 - We'll stop him!

1088
01:54:51,329 --> 01:54:55,542
- They should call up more men! 
 - Kutuzov is afraid!

1089
01:54:55,667 --> 01:55:00,672
- He's a doddering idiot! 
 - What's wrong with the Emperor?

1090
01:55:00,797 --> 01:55:04,676
We will show Europe 
 how Russia rises in defence...

1091
01:55:18,022 --> 01:55:22,861
"Lord God, 
 hear us when we pray to Thee.

1092
01:55:22,986 --> 01:55:26,781
"Strengthen with Thy might 
 our most gracious sovereign,

1093
01:55:26,906 --> 01:55:29,367
"Emperor Alexander Pavlovich,

1094
01:55:29,492 --> 01:55:35,164
"and give him victory over his enemy, 
 as Thou gavest Moses victory,

1095
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:38,501
"Gideon over Mideon, 
 David over Goliath.

1096
01:55:38,626 --> 01:55:42,630
"Smite down our enemies 
 and destroy them swiftly

1097
01:55:42,755 --> 01:55:47,302
"beneath the feet 
 of Thy faithful servants.

1098
01:55:47,427 --> 01:55:54,726
"Preserve our army, give a bow 
 of brass to those armed in Thy name

1099
01:55:54,851 --> 01:55:58,187
"and gird their loins with strength 
 for the fight.

1100
01:55:58,313 --> 01:56:01,774
"Take up the spear and shield 
 and arise to help us.

1101
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:06,446
"Confound those 
 who have devised evil against us.

1102
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:12,869
"May they be, before the faces of 
 Thy warriors, as dust before the wind.

1103
01:56:12,994 --> 01:56:17,415
"May Thy mighty angel 
 confound them and put them to flight.

1104
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:20,919
"Let them fall 
 before Thy servants' feet

1105
01:56:21,044 --> 01:56:24,923
"and be laid low by our host."

1106
01:56:25,048 --> 01:56:28,218
I came to say goodbye. 
 I'm leaving Moscow today.

1107
01:56:28,343 --> 01:56:33,598
- Where are you going? 
 - To the army to fight Napoleon.

1108
01:56:33,723 --> 01:56:36,643
You're going to join up finally?

1109
01:56:36,768 --> 01:56:38,645
I don't know...

1110
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:43,983
I have to see what it's like, 
 what it means for myself.

1111
01:56:44,108 --> 01:56:48,238
Prince Andrei is in command 
 of a regiment. I'll find him.

1112
01:56:48,363 --> 01:56:52,742
- When did you decide to do this? 
 - A long time ago.

1113
01:56:52,867 --> 01:56:57,413
- Even you, Pierre? 
 - You will stay to dinner?

1114
01:56:57,539 --> 01:56:59,832
- By all means. 
 - To say goodbye.

1115
01:56:59,958 --> 01:57:02,377
That's good. Come along.

1116
01:57:02,502 --> 01:57:06,422
- Lots of my school friends are going. 
 - You must study.

1117
01:57:06,548 --> 01:57:11,928
- Every man is needed. 
 - Every man not every infant!

1118
01:57:12,053 --> 01:57:15,139
I can't study 
 when our fatherland is in danger.

1119
01:57:15,265 --> 01:57:16,891
Be quiet!

1120
01:57:17,767 --> 01:57:21,896
- You heard from Andrei. 
 - Yes, one letter.

1121
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:24,023
Did he...?

1122
01:57:24,148 --> 01:57:25,942
How is he?

1123
01:57:26,067 --> 01:57:29,362
Well enough, but sad. His father died.

1124
01:57:29,487 --> 01:57:34,909
I know. Although his father was 
 my enemy, I prayed for him.

1125
01:57:35,034 --> 01:57:39,205
He was the first person in the world 
 to disapprove of me.

1126
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:43,626
You're not really grown-up 
 until that happens to you.

1127
01:57:43,751 --> 01:57:47,547
Did Andrei say anything about me 
 in his letter?

1128
01:57:47,672 --> 01:57:49,424
No, Natasha.

1129
01:57:49,549 --> 01:57:52,427
Will he ever forgive me?

1130
01:57:52,552 --> 01:57:55,680
He has nothing to forgive.

1131
01:57:59,684 --> 01:58:03,438
- You must promise me something. 
 - Yes.

1132
01:58:03,563 --> 01:58:07,817
Don't let anything happen to you.

1133
01:58:07,942 --> 01:58:10,069
If it did, I'd...

1134
01:58:20,496 --> 01:58:23,166
Did you hear me, Pierre?

1135
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:25,335
Yes, I heard you.

1136
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:27,587
I promise.

1137
01:58:36,262 --> 01:58:39,224
- And Pierre... 
 - Yes.

1138
01:58:39,349 --> 01:58:42,518
If you do see Andrei, tell him...

1139
01:58:46,064 --> 01:58:50,276
Tell him I prayed 
 for the soul of his father.

1140
01:59:00,537 --> 01:59:04,749
Can you tell me 
 where I'll find Colonel Bolkonsky?

1141
01:59:41,703 --> 01:59:44,622
This gentleman's 
 been asking to see you.

1142
01:59:44,747 --> 01:59:47,041
Pierre!

1143
01:59:47,166 --> 01:59:49,085
Andrei!

1144
01:59:51,087 --> 01:59:54,215
- At last. 
 - What are you doing here?

1145
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:58,803
It's still hard to say. 
 I came to see the battle.

1146
01:59:58,928 --> 02:00:00,847
Why?

1147
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:07,228
It's hard to explain, Andrei. 
 It's such an enormous event.

1148
02:00:07,353 --> 02:00:13,651
Our lives will be different because 
 of what will happen here tomorrow.

1149
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:21,242
- I'm sorry about your father's death. 
 - He was an old man.

1150
02:00:21,367 --> 02:00:25,872
He couldn't live with the thought 
 of being driven away.

1151
02:00:25,997 --> 02:00:29,709
How are they taking it in Moscow?

1152
02:00:29,834 --> 02:00:33,171
Mary has gone to your aunt's.

1153
02:00:33,296 --> 02:00:37,967
It was Nicholas Rostov 
 who got her out just in time.

1154
02:00:44,474 --> 02:00:49,145
So Anatole Kuragin did not honour 
 Countess Rostov with his hand.

1155
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:52,440
He couldn't. He was married already.

1156
02:00:53,525 --> 02:00:59,656
It was all very long ago. She's had 
 time to forget her disappointment.

1157
02:00:59,781 --> 02:01:04,369
- Remember our old discussion...? 
 - Yes.

1158
02:01:04,494 --> 02:01:09,666
I said a fallen woman should be 
 forgiven. But I can't forgive her.

1159
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:14,087
But you can't compare 
 Natasha to a fallen woman.

1160
02:01:14,212 --> 02:01:17,382
What romantic dreams I had.

1161
02:01:18,716 --> 02:01:24,138
You mean, ask for her hand again? 
 Yes, that would be very noble.

1162
02:01:24,264 --> 02:01:26,182
But...

1163
02:01:29,811 --> 02:01:31,938
I'm sorry.

1164
02:01:32,897 --> 02:01:36,818
How are you? 
 You seem so strange, disturbed.

1165
02:01:36,943 --> 02:01:44,117
The night before a battle is fought, 
 men are likely to seem disturbed.

1166
02:01:44,242 --> 02:01:46,744
It's more than that.

1167
02:01:46,870 --> 02:01:49,330
Perhaps it is.

1168
02:01:54,419 --> 02:02:00,884
I've been in many battles, but 
 for the first time I feel I'll die tomorrow.

1169
02:02:01,009 --> 02:02:05,722
- Nonsense. Why? 
 - I just feel it.

1170
02:02:05,847 --> 02:02:12,145
Why are you really here, Pierre, 
 when you hate violence and war?

1171
02:02:14,147 --> 02:02:16,274
I don't know.

1172
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:22,614
Because I realised you can't hate 
 something you've never known.

1173
02:02:24,157 --> 02:02:27,160
How will the battle go? 
 Our position's good.

1174
02:02:27,285 --> 02:02:33,958
Success never depends on positions, 
 orders, plans or even on numbers.

1175
02:02:34,083 --> 02:02:36,753
A battle is won 
 by men determined to win it.

1176
02:02:36,878 --> 02:02:40,798
Despite those men at headquarters 
 who consider war a game,

1177
02:02:40,924 --> 02:02:46,179
war is the most horrible thing in life, 
 and I'd never take prisoners.

1178
02:02:46,304 --> 02:02:50,683
The French are my enemies, 
 they destroyed my home,

1179
02:02:50,808 --> 02:02:53,895
exiled my sister and my child.

1180
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:58,775
Now they hope to destroy Moscow. 
 Taking prisoners is playing at war.

1181
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:02,403
Take no prisoners! Kill and be killed!

1182
02:03:02,529 --> 02:03:09,661
Without playing at war, we'd fight only 
 when it was certain death, as now.

1183
02:03:12,121 --> 02:03:17,252
I'm sorry. 
 Why should I burden you with all this?

1184
02:03:17,377 --> 02:03:21,798
If we're both alive tomorrow night, 
 we'll have a bottle and laugh.

1185
02:03:21,923 --> 02:03:25,760
Forgive me, you're sleepy. 
 Time for me to sleep, too.

1186
02:03:25,885 --> 02:03:28,221
I'd like to stay here.

1187
02:03:28,346 --> 02:03:31,891
Go. Go! 
 I have no time for you now.

1188
02:03:32,016 --> 02:03:37,772
My only friends now are the men 
 who'll fight at my side tomorrow.

1189
02:03:48,575 --> 02:03:50,076
Goodbye.

1190
02:03:50,869 --> 02:03:53,580
Whether we meet again or not.

1191
02:04:12,015 --> 02:04:16,019
Take down a proclamation 
 to all troops.

1192
02:04:16,936 --> 02:04:23,067
Soldiers, this is the battle 
 you have all longed for.

1193
02:04:23,193 --> 02:04:27,405
Victory depends on you. 
 It will give us all we need.

1194
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:30,533
And a speedy return to our country.

1195
02:04:30,658 --> 02:04:35,747
Act as you did at Austerlitz, 
 Friedland, Vitebsk and Smolensk!

1196
02:04:37,081 --> 02:04:42,670
Let posterity say with pride 
 of each of you,

1197
02:04:42,795 --> 02:04:46,799
"He was in the great battle 
 before Moscow."

1198
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:52,263
- What is Paris saying? 
 - All Paris regrets your absence.

1199
02:04:52,388 --> 02:04:55,433
I should say they do. What's in there?

1200
02:04:55,558 --> 02:04:58,728
- A surprise. 
 - What's that?

1201
02:04:58,853 --> 02:05:03,066
A present from the Empress 
 for Your Majesty.

1202
02:05:10,573 --> 02:05:12,700
My son.

1203
02:05:15,537 --> 02:05:17,664
The King of Rome.

1204
02:05:21,084 --> 02:05:23,211
Admirable.

1205
02:05:29,592 --> 02:05:32,262
Take him away, De Beausset.

1206
02:05:32,387 --> 02:05:37,433
It is too soon for him 
 to see a field of battle.

1207
02:05:40,019 --> 02:05:42,397
Follow me, De Beausset!

1208
02:05:45,775 --> 02:05:52,073
You must not leave. Stay and 
 we'll give you something to tell Paris!

1209
02:08:51,502 --> 02:08:53,421
Fire!

1210
02:09:32,126 --> 02:09:36,673
There's a lot of wind up there. 
 It's made of iron!

1211
02:09:39,676 --> 02:09:44,806
Get down or next time it won't be 
 your hat that blows off.

1212
02:09:44,931 --> 02:09:50,103
- Excuse me. I didn't realise. 
 - Number 3, you're too slow!

1213
02:09:50,228 --> 02:09:52,564
Ready, fire!

1214
02:09:53,857 --> 02:09:58,111
You can't stand here, 
 you're in the way.

1215
02:09:58,236 --> 02:10:01,239
I'll try to keep out of everybody's way.

1216
02:10:01,364 --> 02:10:07,662
Up with your sights, you're firing low. 
 Number 5, quicker with the charges!

1217
02:10:13,209 --> 02:10:16,087
- You're not afraid? 
 - Are you?

1218
02:10:16,212 --> 02:10:21,467
They have no mercy, when they 
 come singing over. Heaven help us.

1219
02:10:27,265 --> 02:10:30,143
Ready. Fire!

1220
02:10:33,187 --> 02:10:36,816
- Having a pleasant morning, sir? 
 - Interesting morning.

1221
02:10:36,941 --> 02:10:41,196
Interesting? 
 You hear that, mates? Interesting!

1222
02:10:45,033 --> 02:10:50,830
- Here comes a live one! 
 - Not this way. Towards the infantry!

1223
02:10:51,873 --> 02:10:56,169
Found your friend, eh? 
 Know him well?

1224
02:10:59,797 --> 02:11:05,053
Beyond the trees, the French infantry 
 are advancing en masse.

1225
02:11:17,232 --> 02:11:20,777
- Hold your fire! 
 - Hold your fire!

1226
02:12:09,742 --> 02:12:13,162
Lower your sights 
 and wait for the order to fire!

1227
02:13:32,992 --> 02:13:34,994
Fire!

1228
02:14:10,321 --> 02:14:16,202
Sire, our infantry regiments 
 have turned back and are retreating.

1229
02:14:16,327 --> 02:14:21,583
The cavalry should have gone first 
 to clear the way. Send them now!

1230
02:14:25,879 --> 02:14:29,841
- There's only four more charges, sir. 
 - Bring up more.

1231
02:14:29,966 --> 02:14:32,093
I'll go, too.

1232
02:16:44,392 --> 02:16:46,311
Water.

1233
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:54,194
Take me to a dressing station. 
 Help me.

1234
02:17:22,013 --> 02:17:24,849
Doctor, he needs help.

1235
02:17:27,185 --> 02:17:31,397
- How far have you carried him? 
 - I don't know.

1236
02:17:33,733 --> 02:17:38,363
You should have saved yourself 
 the trouble. He's dead.

1237
02:18:31,916 --> 02:18:34,836
Damn you, Napoleon.

1238
02:18:34,961 --> 02:18:37,755
Damn you to hell!

1239
02:18:41,467 --> 02:18:44,304
Well, we've stood our ground.

1240
02:18:44,429 --> 02:18:48,141
We've taken the worst 
 that Napoleon has to offer.

1241
02:18:48,266 --> 02:18:52,520
We must attack tomorrow morning. 
 You agree, sir?

1242
02:18:52,645 --> 02:18:56,232
Yes, I agree. Theoretically.

1243
02:18:56,357 --> 02:19:01,154
According to all the rules that 
 we've ever learned about warfare,

1244
02:19:01,279 --> 02:19:05,950
we must attack tomorrow morning, 
 but we cannot attack.

1245
02:19:06,075 --> 02:19:10,538
- We're too exhausted to attack. 
 - But if we retreat...

1246
02:19:10,663 --> 02:19:16,461
We give the ground to the enemy. 
 But he has paid too high a price for it.

1247
02:19:16,586 --> 02:19:19,547
He will bleed to death from this victory.

1248
02:19:19,672 --> 02:19:22,508
But we can't make a stand 
 before Moscow.

1249
02:19:22,634 --> 02:19:24,886
Yes, General, you're right.

1250
02:19:25,011 --> 02:19:28,848
You mean to abandon Russia's 
 ancient and sacred capital?

1251
02:19:28,973 --> 02:19:32,018
Russia's ancient and sacred capital.

1252
02:19:32,143 --> 02:19:36,898
Let me tell you, that question 
 has no meaning for a Russian.

1253
02:19:37,023 --> 02:19:40,485
Such a question cannot be put. 
 It's senseless!

1254
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:45,406
The question I've asked you 
 to discuss is a military one!

1255
02:19:45,532 --> 02:19:48,868
The question is of saving Russia.

1256
02:19:48,993 --> 02:19:55,291
Do we give up Moscow or accept battle 
 and lose the army and Moscow?

1257
02:19:59,587 --> 02:20:06,928
Well, I see I am the one who 
 has to pay for the broken crockery.

1258
02:20:07,053 --> 02:20:13,226
Gentlemen, I've heard your views. 
 Some of you will not agree with me.

1259
02:20:13,351 --> 02:20:19,649
But I, by the authority entrusted 
 to me by my sovereign and country...

1260
02:20:21,025 --> 02:20:23,653
...order a retreat.

1261
02:20:32,954 --> 02:20:37,959
Oh, faster! The French will be here 
 before we're ready to leave.

1262
02:20:38,084 --> 02:20:40,628
Now, come on, up!

1263
02:20:50,388 --> 02:20:53,808
Put all the glass things 
 in the front wagons.

1264
02:20:53,933 --> 02:20:58,146
And the books... put them 
 in the low wagons.

1265
02:20:58,271 --> 02:21:03,193
Take this and this. And these gloves. 
 I'll never wear them again.

1266
02:21:03,318 --> 02:21:05,445
Thank you.

1267
02:21:54,577 --> 02:21:57,497
They are the wounded from Borodino.

1268
02:22:06,047 --> 02:22:08,841
Vera, hurry!

1269
02:22:10,218 --> 02:22:12,345
Vera, come!

1270
02:22:13,179 --> 02:22:15,723
Give me some water.

1271
02:22:18,893 --> 02:22:25,608
- Have you seen the wounded men? 
 - Yes. I said they can live here.

1272
02:23:20,288 --> 02:23:23,374
Someone badly wounded?

1273
02:23:23,499 --> 02:23:28,421
Just about alive. It's a miracle 
 His Excellency has lasted this long.

1274
02:23:28,546 --> 02:23:31,716
- His Excellency? 
 - Our colonel.

1275
02:23:42,227 --> 02:23:44,354
Miss Sonya.

1276
02:23:44,854 --> 02:23:50,068
Don't tell anyone about this. Not yet. 
 Promise me.

1277
02:24:08,086 --> 02:24:12,298
Aunt, Prince Andrei is here, 
 among the wounded.

1278
02:24:13,258 --> 02:24:17,971
- Andrei? 
 - He's unconscious, terribly wounded.

1279
02:24:18,096 --> 02:24:20,473
- Natasha? 
 - She doesn't know.

1280
02:24:20,598 --> 02:24:23,476
- She mustn't know. 
 - He's dying.

1281
02:24:23,601 --> 02:24:26,145
Natasha must not know.

1282
02:24:29,065 --> 02:24:34,445
All right, get those wagons moving. 
 Turn them around!

1283
02:24:34,571 --> 02:24:38,074
We've got another load of wounded 
 back there!

1284
02:24:38,199 --> 02:24:42,120
After we've left and 
 the wounded are here, what then?

1285
02:24:42,245 --> 02:24:48,418
I don't know. My orders are to get 
 back and pick up more wounded.

1286
02:24:48,543 --> 02:24:53,965
They're to be left here, deserted, 
 to be taken prisoner, to die?

1287
02:24:54,090 --> 02:24:58,678
- That's in other hands than ours. 
 - Take those chairs down.

1288
02:24:59,846 --> 02:25:04,726
- That's enough. Put it down. 
 - Papa, we can't do this.

1289
02:25:04,851 --> 02:25:10,356
- Oh, the settee... 
 - The three men will become prisoners.

1290
02:25:10,481 --> 02:25:12,984
What three men?

1291
02:25:13,109 --> 02:25:19,032
But of course. If we leave the settee, 
 what will happen to your mother?

1292
02:25:19,157 --> 02:25:22,493
- I'll speak to Mother. 
 - Back in!

1293
02:25:22,619 --> 02:25:26,664
You three are to come with us 
 on that cart.

1294
02:25:32,378 --> 02:25:36,299
- Your men must use my house. 
 - Count, please help.

1295
02:25:36,424 --> 02:25:40,136
- Is there a cart for this poor fellow? 
 - Of course.

1296
02:26:02,951 --> 02:26:05,370
Hurry, hurry!

1297
02:26:05,495 --> 02:26:09,999
- All those men, Papa. 
 - I know, it's very sad.

1298
02:26:10,124 --> 02:26:13,545
- Still, in a war... 
 - We must take them with us.

1299
02:26:13,670 --> 02:26:18,675
We're going to unload everything 
 and take every man who can travel.

1300
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,844
You're right. So very right.

1301
02:26:23,304 --> 02:26:26,474
Take those back. Put that down.

1302
02:26:26,599 --> 02:26:30,562
Unload all the carts. Do as you're told!

1303
02:26:30,687 --> 02:26:34,983
- Tell your men there's room for all. 
 - Thank you, sir.

1304
02:26:35,108 --> 02:26:36,526
Take those off!

1305
02:26:38,111 --> 02:26:42,657
Take this off, take it all down. 
 Unload the cart.

1306
02:26:42,782 --> 02:26:46,035
Unload this cart completely. 
 Overboard with that.

1307
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:49,205
Take all that down!

1308
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:52,458
Take down that table, we don't need it.

1309
02:26:52,584 --> 02:26:57,922
Empty the cart straight away. 
 All this out. Come and help!

1310
02:26:58,047 --> 02:27:03,094
Llya, what is this? 
 They're unloading everything.

1311
02:27:03,219 --> 02:27:06,931
- To make room for the wounded. 
 - But our things!

1312
02:27:07,056 --> 02:27:12,896
Things! Things can be bought. 
 Think what it means to be left behind.

1313
02:27:13,021 --> 02:27:16,232
The government ought to care 
 for the wounded.

1314
02:27:16,357 --> 02:27:20,069
Mama, you can't object. 
 Look at them.

1315
02:27:20,195 --> 02:27:25,283
You'd leave them behind 
 to save some furniture? Mama!

1316
02:27:25,408 --> 02:27:29,495
Suppose Nicholas was one of them. 
 Or Petya.

1317
02:27:30,246 --> 02:27:33,374
Nicholas? Petya?

1318
02:27:33,499 --> 02:27:38,671
Of course, you're right, darling. 
 I'm sorry, llya.

1319
02:27:40,632 --> 02:27:43,301
The chicks are teaching the hen!

1320
02:27:43,426 --> 02:27:47,639
Ten more minutes! 
 We leave in ten minutes!

1321
02:27:58,441 --> 02:28:03,696
- I'm ready now, llya. 
 - Come along, girls, in you get.

1322
02:28:10,370 --> 02:28:15,625
- In God's name, off. 
 - In God's name, off!

1323
02:29:03,423 --> 02:29:07,635
Dear Moscow, everybody's leaving you.

1324
02:29:13,182 --> 02:29:17,770
- Look! Over there by the corner! 
 - Who is it?

1325
02:29:17,896 --> 02:29:21,608
Pierre! Over here! Pierre!

1326
02:29:24,277 --> 02:29:27,113
Over here, Pierre!

1327
02:29:30,116 --> 02:29:33,536
You're safe. You promised 
 you'd come back and you have.

1328
02:29:33,661 --> 02:29:36,080
You mustn't stay. Come with us.

1329
02:29:36,206 --> 02:29:41,252
- Did you see the battle, Pierre? 
 - Yes, I saw it. I saw too much.

1330
02:29:41,377 --> 02:29:45,089
- Come with us. 
 - I must stay in the city, I've...

1331
02:29:45,215 --> 02:29:49,219
- Stop the coach! 
 ...something I must do.

1332
02:29:50,929 --> 02:29:53,056
Go on!

1333
02:29:54,015 --> 02:29:56,601
Remember me. Remember!

1334
02:30:03,691 --> 02:30:07,362
Why wouldn't he come with us?

1335
02:30:07,487 --> 02:30:09,447
I don't understand.

1336
02:30:12,867 --> 02:30:15,078
- Natasha... 
 - Sonya!

1337
02:30:16,663 --> 02:30:19,832
You're crying. For Pierre?

1338
02:30:19,958 --> 02:30:23,878
For us, because we're leaving? 
 What, then?

1339
02:30:24,003 --> 02:30:26,339
- I have to tell her. 
 - No.

1340
02:30:26,464 --> 02:30:29,634
There's someone we know 
 among the wounded.

1341
02:30:32,929 --> 02:30:35,431
Andrei?

1342
02:30:35,557 --> 02:30:38,601
He's travelling with us now.

1343
02:30:39,894 --> 02:30:44,482
Is he badly hurt? 
 Why didn't you tell me before?

1344
02:30:44,607 --> 02:30:48,152
I didn't know how to tell you.

1345
02:30:48,278 --> 02:30:51,573
He told you not to tell me.

1346
02:30:51,698 --> 02:30:56,327
No. He's asleep or unconscious. 
 He didn't speak.

1347
02:31:04,502 --> 02:31:07,046
He didn't speak?

1348
02:31:59,682 --> 02:32:01,809
Moscow!

1349
02:32:02,810 --> 02:32:06,397
Asiatic city of innumerable churches.

1350
02:32:06,523 --> 02:32:08,900
Lots of them.

1351
02:32:09,025 --> 02:32:13,279
Moscow the holy, here at my feet.

1352
02:32:13,404 --> 02:32:15,490
At last!

1353
02:32:15,615 --> 02:32:19,661
On the ancient monuments 
 of barbarism and despotism,

1354
02:32:19,786 --> 02:32:25,625
I shall inscribe great words 
 of justice and mercy. Mercy.

1355
02:32:40,473 --> 02:32:45,728
What a splendid reign the Emperor 
 Alexander's... might have been.

1356
02:32:47,897 --> 02:32:53,152
Now, I'm ready to accept 
 the surrender of the city. Now.

1357
02:33:00,243 --> 02:33:03,413
Well, where is the deputation?

1358
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:11,004
There is no one, sire.

1359
02:33:11,129 --> 02:33:15,133
The city is empty, half of it on fire.

1360
02:33:15,967 --> 02:33:19,429
There is no government.

1361
02:33:19,554 --> 02:33:22,724
No one to surrender to you.

1362
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:28,813
That's impossible.

1363
02:33:28,938 --> 02:33:32,108
Impossible and ridiculous!

1364
02:33:36,362 --> 02:33:39,532
There must be a surrender.

1365
02:33:46,122 --> 02:33:48,249
This is an insult!

1366
02:33:50,043 --> 02:33:53,213
They're going to pay for this.

1367
02:34:02,430 --> 02:34:05,975
The skyline, look. It's a village on fire.

1368
02:34:09,562 --> 02:34:13,733
- It could be Mytishchi. 
 - It's further away than that.

1369
02:34:13,858 --> 02:34:18,321
- Moscow's on fire! 
 - It's so windy and dry.

1370
02:34:18,446 --> 02:34:21,115
Moscow! God have mercy.

1371
02:34:22,659 --> 02:34:26,412
Oh, it's Moscow, poor Moscow.

1372
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:33,753
Natasha, Sonya, come and look. 
 Moscow's on fire.

1373
02:34:34,963 --> 02:34:37,465
Moscow? Oh, no!

1374
02:34:39,592 --> 02:34:41,719
How terrible!

1375
02:34:43,096 --> 02:34:47,016
- Natasha! 
 - Let's go back to bed.

1376
02:34:47,141 --> 02:34:50,186
- I must talk to you. 
 - Again?

1377
02:34:50,311 --> 02:34:54,399
- Go back to bed. 
 - Give me permission to join the army.

1378
02:34:54,524 --> 02:34:57,277
You already know it. It's no.

1379
02:34:57,402 --> 02:35:03,074
I must go where I can do 
 the most good for my country.

1380
02:35:03,199 --> 02:35:08,580
Your duty now is not what you think. 
 Your duty is to stay with us.

1381
02:35:08,705 --> 02:35:13,001
I'm sorry, Papa. 
 I've already made up my mind.

1382
02:35:30,101 --> 02:35:36,399
Do look. The whole city's on fire. 
 You can see it from the window.

1383
02:35:39,903 --> 02:35:44,324
- You didn't even look. 
 - Yes. Really, I did.

1384
02:35:44,449 --> 02:35:48,828
Go back to sleep. 
 You'll catch your death of cold.

1385
02:35:48,953 --> 02:35:52,624
You, too, Natasha, darling. 
 Go to sleep.

1386
02:37:13,246 --> 02:37:18,084
- Is it the French or us burning the city? 
 - Who knows?

1387
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:22,922
Please, your officers, where are they?

1388
02:37:23,047 --> 02:37:25,341
Officers, Miss?

1389
02:37:25,466 --> 02:37:29,679
I don't know. Down there somewhere.

1390
02:38:32,408 --> 02:38:34,953
Forgive me, forgive me.

1391
02:38:37,038 --> 02:38:39,832
I love you.

1392
02:38:39,958 --> 02:38:42,085
Forgive me.

1393
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:44,587
Forgive what?

1394
02:38:44,712 --> 02:38:47,006
For everything I have done.

1395
02:38:49,592 --> 02:38:54,138
I love you more. Better than before.

1396
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:58,096
- I want all these fires put out. 
 - Yes, sire.

1397
02:41:39,304 --> 02:41:44,100
Let me go! Take your hands off me!

1398
02:41:44,225 --> 02:41:45,935
No!

1399
02:41:48,187 --> 02:41:50,440
Let me go!

1400
02:42:04,913 --> 02:42:08,917
- Where did he come from? 
 - I don't know.

1401
02:42:15,924 --> 02:42:17,425
Ready!

1402
02:42:21,221 --> 02:42:23,139
Aim!

1403
02:42:24,098 --> 02:42:26,017
Fire!

1404
02:42:27,602 --> 02:42:29,646
Cut them down!

1405
02:42:34,734 --> 02:42:39,906
- Two others, quickly! 
 - No, no! Help me! Please!

1406
02:42:40,031 --> 02:42:42,575
Please don't let them! No!

1407
02:42:42,700 --> 02:42:45,119
No! No!

1408
02:42:45,870 --> 02:42:48,289
Please! No!

1409
02:42:52,252 --> 02:42:53,753
No!

1410
02:42:53,878 --> 02:42:55,380
No, please!

1411
02:42:59,717 --> 02:43:01,427
Ready!

1412
02:43:03,346 --> 02:43:05,056
Aim!

1413
02:43:06,182 --> 02:43:07,892
Fire!

1414
02:43:08,810 --> 02:43:10,937
Cut them down!

1415
02:43:22,031 --> 02:43:24,409
No, that's all.

1416
02:43:24,534 --> 02:43:27,704
The orders were to shoot 
 only the incendiaries.

1417
02:43:27,829 --> 02:43:30,415
Take them back to prison.

1418
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:32,667
Forward march!

1419
02:43:46,848 --> 02:43:52,729
Don't brood. It's not for us to judge 
 whether we're to be spared or not.

1420
02:43:52,854 --> 02:43:58,943
Finally, in the world to come, 
 God will give us a word of explanation.

1421
02:44:06,284 --> 02:44:11,080
Here you are. Come here, boy. 
 You found me again, eh?

1422
02:44:11,206 --> 02:44:16,169
That's the little fella. That's right. 
 Sit down there, be a good boy.

1423
02:44:18,588 --> 02:44:24,260
Do you like cold potatoes? 
 At dinner the potatoes were delicious.

1424
02:44:29,641 --> 02:44:31,935
Here you are, boy.

1425
02:44:33,603 --> 02:44:36,564
Perhaps you'd like some salt.

1426
02:44:45,156 --> 02:44:49,244
- That's better now, huh? 
 - I'm all right.

1427
02:44:49,369 --> 02:44:55,750
- Why did they have to shoot them? 
 - What a sin. What a sin.

1428
02:44:55,875 --> 02:44:58,795
Where there's law, there's injustice.

1429
02:44:58,920 --> 02:45:01,839
Come on, boy, get up.

1430
02:45:01,965 --> 02:45:05,218
But the maggot eats the cabbage 
 yet dies first.

1431
02:45:05,343 --> 02:45:06,761
What?

1432
02:45:06,886 --> 02:45:11,140
Things happen not as we plan, 
 but as God judges.

1433
02:45:11,266 --> 02:45:15,186
Have you got a family estate, sir? 
 A housewife?

1434
02:45:15,311 --> 02:45:18,481
Your old parents, are they still living?

1435
02:45:19,732 --> 02:45:22,694
Perhaps you've got little ones?

1436
02:45:23,653 --> 02:45:28,324
Never mind, you're young yet 
 and may have some still.

1437
02:45:28,449 --> 02:45:31,578
The great thing is to live in harmony.

1438
02:45:31,703 --> 02:45:35,415
Well, I was still living at home, 
 you know?

1439
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:39,210
We had a well-to-do homestead, 
 a nice piece of land,

1440
02:45:39,335 --> 02:45:42,380
and a house you'd thank God for.

1441
02:45:42,505 --> 02:45:47,427
When we went mowing, 
 we were seven. Real peasants.

1442
02:45:47,552 --> 02:45:53,308
Well, one day, I went into someone 
 else's forest to cut wood.

1443
02:45:53,433 --> 02:46:00,899
The keeper found me, I was flogged 
 and sent to serve as a soldier.

1444
02:46:01,024 --> 02:46:07,113
We thought that was a misfortune, 
 but it turned out to be a blessing.

1445
02:46:07,238 --> 02:46:13,411
If I hadn't sinned, my brother would've 
 gone and he's got five little ones.

1446
02:46:13,536 --> 02:46:16,789
Whereas I only had a wife to leave.

1447
02:46:16,915 --> 02:46:21,628
We had a little girl, 
 but God took her before I left.

1448
02:46:21,753 --> 02:46:24,672
You've had hard luck.

1449
02:46:24,797 --> 02:46:27,967
We can make it into misery or into joy.

1450
02:46:28,092 --> 02:46:32,263
Hard luck's like water in a dragnet, 
 you pull and it bulges.

1451
02:46:32,388 --> 02:46:35,725
But when you've drawn it out, 
 there's nothing in it.

1452
02:46:35,850 --> 02:46:38,728
That's how it is, dear boy.

1453
02:46:38,853 --> 02:46:41,898
Now I think it's time to sleep.

1454
02:46:46,611 --> 02:46:52,033
Lord Jesus Christ, Holy Saint Nicholas, 
 Frola and Lavra have mercy upon us.

1455
02:46:54,118 --> 02:46:56,746
That's the way.

1456
02:46:56,871 --> 02:47:00,375
Lay me down like a stone 
 and raise me up like a loaf.

1457
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:05,630
- What prayer was that? 
 - I was praying. Don't you pray?

1458
02:47:05,755 --> 02:47:09,384
Yes. But what did you say? 
 Frola and Lavra?

1459
02:47:09,509 --> 02:47:14,305
The horse's saints. 
 One must pity the animals, too.

1460
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:18,268
Come over here. 
 Get warm and lie down.

1461
02:47:18,393 --> 02:47:20,520
That's right.

1462
02:47:51,634 --> 02:47:56,848
- I thought you were asleep. 
 - No. I was watching you.

1463
02:47:56,973 --> 02:48:00,351
Enjoying you. Being thankful for you.

1464
02:48:00,476 --> 02:48:04,355
- Sleep, my dearest. 
 - No, not yet.

1465
02:48:04,480 --> 02:48:09,819
I want to keep my eyes open. 
 I want to look at you.

1466
02:48:09,944 --> 02:48:15,491
You know, you're not the girl 
 I saw dancing all night.

1467
02:48:15,617 --> 02:48:19,078
The girl who whispered 
 on the balcony to the moon.

1468
02:48:19,204 --> 02:48:22,832
You're something much better.

1469
02:48:22,957 --> 02:48:27,170
How serene you are. How valuable.

1470
02:48:28,588 --> 02:48:30,965
I love you so much.

1471
02:48:31,090 --> 02:48:37,305
It's a terrible thing. Only at a moment 
 like this can one talk so openly.

1472
02:48:37,430 --> 02:48:40,475
Until now, I knew nothing about love.

1473
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:43,144
I was a great hater, Natasha.

1474
02:48:43,269 --> 02:48:48,399
I hated so many things, 
 but most of all I hated you.

1475
02:48:48,525 --> 02:48:51,778
You had every right.

1476
02:48:51,903 --> 02:48:56,324
I love you more than I've ever loved 
 anything on this earth.

1477
02:48:56,449 --> 02:49:00,161
Maybe this monastery 
 has something to do with it.

1478
02:49:00,286 --> 02:49:04,207
Maybe the monks 
 really know about love.

1479
02:49:04,332 --> 02:49:08,670
Now I'm beginning to understand, too.

1480
02:49:08,795 --> 02:49:13,007
Maybe death 
 is my private monastery.

1481
02:49:37,365 --> 02:49:39,993
Where is he? Can I see him?

1482
02:49:40,118 --> 02:49:43,538
- Of course. But is that his son? 
 - Yes.

1483
02:49:43,663 --> 02:49:45,957
- And he's called...? 
 - Kolya.

1484
02:49:46,082 --> 02:49:48,126
What a lovely boy.

1485
02:49:48,251 --> 02:49:52,505
- Where is he? 
 - We've sent to ask.

1486
02:49:52,630 --> 02:49:56,926
You must be tired, Princess. 
 We've prepared rooms for you.

1487
02:49:57,051 --> 02:50:03,016
- Where is Petya? 
 - He left. We couldn't control him.

1488
02:50:03,141 --> 02:50:08,229
He kept on about going into the army 
 until we just had to let him go.

1489
02:50:08,354 --> 02:50:12,317
The war will probably be over 
 before he gets his commission.

1490
02:50:12,442 --> 02:50:18,198
- Did you receive my letter? 
 - Yes, that was a good piece of news.

1491
02:50:18,323 --> 02:50:21,492
- You and Mary. 
 - I'm worried about Sonya.

1492
02:50:21,618 --> 02:50:27,290
- It's all right, I told her immediately. 
 - But I wanted to tell her myself.

1493
02:50:31,836 --> 02:50:36,216
- Mary. 
 - Will you stay with us, little man?

1494
02:50:36,341 --> 02:50:38,468
Now, my dear...

1495
02:50:45,516 --> 02:50:48,061
Come with me, Mary.

1496
02:50:50,438 --> 02:50:52,815
Nicholas, you come along.

1497
02:50:54,025 --> 02:50:58,404
- Nicholas, I've read your letter. 
 - I know.

1498
02:50:58,530 --> 02:51:02,075
She's a fine woman, isn't she?

1499
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:07,330
- If you want to, Nicholas, you're free. 
 - Forgive me, Sonya.

1500
02:51:08,873 --> 02:51:13,211
Natasha, no one will tell me anything.

1501
02:51:13,336 --> 02:51:18,508
How is his wound, his condition? 
 What did the doctor say?

1502
02:51:18,633 --> 02:51:20,760
Is he worse?

1503
02:51:45,577 --> 02:51:48,913
- Andrei. 
 - Hello, Mary.

1504
02:51:49,038 --> 02:51:54,210
How did you manage to get here? 
 Have you brought little Kolya?

1505
02:51:54,335 --> 02:51:58,756
- How are you now? 
 - You must ask the doctor.

1506
02:51:58,882 --> 02:52:02,760
You see how strangely 
 fate has brought us together?

1507
02:52:02,886 --> 02:52:08,266
- She looks after me all the time. 
 - Mary came from Ryazan.

1508
02:52:09,934 --> 02:52:13,479
- You've missed Count Nicholas? 
 - Yes.

1509
02:52:13,605 --> 02:52:19,652
He took a great liking to you. 
 It would be a good thing to marry him.

1510
02:52:19,777 --> 02:52:22,739
Why talk of me, Andrei?

1511
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:28,036
Would you like to see Kolya? 
 He's outside.

1512
02:52:28,161 --> 02:52:31,331
I'd be very glad to see him.

1513
02:52:39,881 --> 02:52:43,092
Is it too much for you, all this talking?

1514
02:52:43,218 --> 02:52:48,681
No. I want to tell Mary 
 so many things but I'm unable to.

1515
02:53:00,527 --> 02:53:03,988
Kiss him, Kolya. Kiss your father.

1516
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:15,208
Kolya...

1517
02:53:15,333 --> 02:53:19,003
...no one is permitted to cry 
 in this room.

1518
02:53:19,128 --> 02:53:22,840
Not children and not grown-ups either.

1519
02:53:26,719 --> 02:53:30,932
I think you'd better 
 go out and play now.

1520
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:40,441
He's a handsome little boy.

1521
02:53:42,902 --> 02:53:47,240
What is it, Mary? Is it about the child?

1522
02:53:47,365 --> 02:53:50,159
You know the gospel.

1523
02:53:50,285 --> 02:53:56,541
"The fouls of the air sow not, nor reap, 
 yet your father feedeth them."

1524
02:53:56,666 --> 02:53:59,627
That's why you mustn't cry.

1525
02:54:02,046 --> 02:54:04,591
Come sit beside me.

1526
02:54:10,430 --> 02:54:14,642
The hardest thing 
 is to keep alive at sunset.

1527
02:54:32,243 --> 02:54:35,038
I had a wonderful dream.

1528
02:54:35,163 --> 02:54:40,919
I saw a door. I could see beyond it.

1529
02:54:41,044 --> 02:54:43,796
I dreamt that I died.

1530
02:54:43,922 --> 02:54:47,258
And as I died, I awoke.

1531
02:54:47,383 --> 02:54:49,719
Yes...

1532
02:54:49,844 --> 02:54:54,849
...death is an awakening, you see?

1533
02:54:54,974 --> 02:54:58,144
It's all so simple.

1534
02:55:05,735 --> 02:55:07,862
Is it over?

1535
02:55:19,499 --> 02:55:22,001
Where is he now?

1536
02:55:22,126 --> 02:55:25,171
Where has he gone?

1537
02:55:30,009 --> 02:55:33,388
What is this? What is this?

1538
02:55:34,472 --> 02:55:39,894
We are masters of the capital 
 of the largest country in the world,

1539
02:55:40,019 --> 02:55:44,315
not a single civilian mouth to feed 
 and I get these reports!

1540
02:55:44,440 --> 02:55:48,403
"The stocks are dwindling, 
 food is disappearing,

1541
02:55:48,528 --> 02:55:53,575
"the danger point is approaching." 
 Who writes out these reports?

1542
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:56,870
Who is taking steps to correct them?

1543
02:55:59,956 --> 02:56:04,127
I brought the greatest army 
 in Europe into this city.

1544
02:56:04,252 --> 02:56:08,423
What do I see? 
 A mob of looters and drunkards.

1545
02:56:08,548 --> 02:56:11,843
They are not soldiers any more!

1546
02:56:11,968 --> 02:56:16,097
They are rag-pickers. Junk men!

1547
02:56:21,895 --> 02:56:28,318
Kutuzov must have sent emissaries 
 to ask for the terms of surrender.

1548
02:56:28,443 --> 02:56:32,363
What happened? 
 Are they detained? Shot?

1549
02:56:32,488 --> 02:56:39,746
Sire, I myself have given explicit 
 instructions to all the commanders.

1550
02:56:39,871 --> 02:56:45,126
There have been no emissaries from 
 the Russian Commander-in-Chief.

1551
02:56:53,843 --> 02:56:58,973
The city's burning down 
 around our ears. House by house!

1552
02:56:59,098 --> 02:57:04,270
I've given orders to shoot incendiaries 
 and even here, you cannot...

1553
02:57:05,605 --> 02:57:09,484
...cannot get the stink of smoke 
 out of your nostrils!

1554
02:57:09,609 --> 02:57:15,740
Gentlemen, take hold or 
 I promise you I will replace you all!

1555
02:57:15,865 --> 02:57:20,328
With all your titles 
 and decorations and batons!

1556
02:57:20,453 --> 02:57:26,167
I'll go and pick the first soldiers I find 
 who are not drunk...

1557
02:57:27,168 --> 02:57:30,338
...and put them in your place!

1558
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:39,973
I warn you, gentlemen, 
 I cannot sit here much longer,

1559
02:57:40,098 --> 02:57:44,143
watching my army decay.

1560
02:57:48,648 --> 02:57:51,609
Close the windows, someone!

1561
02:58:14,382 --> 02:58:17,176
{y:i}Already the wild geese 
 {y:i}are flying south.

1562
02:58:17,302 --> 02:58:21,264
{y:i}What if we are trapped here 
 {y:i}through winter?

1563
02:58:21,389 --> 02:58:26,644
Time and patience, 
 patience and time.

1564
02:58:26,769 --> 02:58:29,647
The grand army's wounded,

1565
02:58:29,772 --> 02:58:33,526
but is it mortally wounded?

1566
02:58:33,651 --> 02:58:39,365
An apple should not be plucked 
 while it's green.

1567
02:58:39,490 --> 02:58:42,660
Patience and time.

1568
02:58:47,248 --> 02:58:50,627
Yes? Who is it? Come in!

1569
02:58:50,752 --> 02:58:53,922
A special courier, Your Excellency.

1570
02:58:59,844 --> 02:59:05,099
Excellency, the French are preparing 
 to leave Moscow.

1571
02:59:07,894 --> 02:59:10,855
Come closer.

1572
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:42,720
Excellency, would you like me to...?

1573
03:00:13,751 --> 03:00:17,171
O Lord, my creator.

1574
03:00:17,297 --> 03:00:21,050
Thou hast heard our prayer.

1575
03:00:22,510 --> 03:00:25,555
Russia is saved!

1576
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:29,392
I thank Thee, O Lord.

1577
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:53,208
Russian women.

1578
03:00:53,333 --> 03:00:56,377
They're the lice 
 that live on the conquerors.

1579
03:00:56,502 --> 03:00:59,339
They have to leave with them or die.

1580
03:01:44,008 --> 03:01:46,553
Attack.

1581
03:01:46,678 --> 03:01:50,598
The word "attack" 
 is always on your tongues.

1582
03:01:50,723 --> 03:01:56,271
Gentlemen, they came 
 into our country like locusts,

1583
03:01:56,396 --> 03:01:59,983
leaving nothing behind, 
 food nor shelter.

1584
03:02:00,692 --> 03:02:06,865
Now they are going back the way 
 they came, through the desolation.

1585
03:02:06,990 --> 03:02:11,786
A cold, hungry army, 
 2,000 miles from home,

1586
03:02:11,911 --> 03:02:14,747
doing what every Russian wants,

1587
03:02:14,873 --> 03:02:19,419
leaving our country 
 with all possible speed.

1588
03:02:19,544 --> 03:02:22,839
The country is destroying them.

1589
03:02:22,964 --> 03:02:27,594
And the Russian army? 
 Since Borodino, we've been in retreat.

1590
03:02:27,719 --> 03:02:32,098
- Now, it must attack! 
 - For what?

1591
03:02:32,223 --> 03:02:37,729
I wouldn't give one Russian soldier 
 for ten Frenchmen!

1592
03:02:37,854 --> 03:02:40,565
Those retreats...

1593
03:02:40,690 --> 03:02:44,736
...they've brought about 
 the destruction of the French army.

1594
03:02:44,861 --> 03:02:50,074
And will bring about the liberation 
 of our country.

1595
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:55,872
The animal is running. 
 We will follow it...

1596
03:02:55,997 --> 03:03:02,420
...and flick its haunches with whips 
 to encourage it to keep moving.

1597
03:03:02,545 --> 03:03:06,925
We will follow it 
 to the borders of our country.

1598
03:03:07,050 --> 03:03:12,972
We will offer the French 
 a golden bridge to the West.

1599
03:06:55,945 --> 03:06:59,032
Get moving, there! Get moving!

1600
03:06:59,157 --> 03:07:01,951
All stragglers will be shot!

1601
03:07:02,076 --> 03:07:03,786
Get up.

1602
03:07:03,912 --> 03:07:07,081
Get up! Keep moving! Get up!

1603
03:07:08,875 --> 03:07:11,836
Come on, get into line.

1604
03:07:12,712 --> 03:07:16,132
- Get up! Come on, get up! 
 - I can't.

1605
03:07:16,257 --> 03:07:18,384
Get up. Now!

1606
03:07:20,303 --> 03:07:22,222
Please...

1607
03:07:23,556 --> 03:07:25,308
All right.

1608
03:09:56,125 --> 03:09:59,712
971, 972...

1609
03:09:59,837 --> 03:10:03,216
...73, 74...

1610
03:10:08,471 --> 03:10:10,098
Get up!

1611
03:10:10,223 --> 03:10:12,350
Get moving!

1612
03:10:15,270 --> 03:10:20,692
Clear the road! Out of the way!

1613
03:10:20,817 --> 03:10:23,987
Stand aside! Out of the way!

1614
03:10:38,167 --> 03:10:39,711
Move on.

1615
03:10:39,836 --> 03:10:42,964
Move on! Keep moving!

1616
03:10:43,965 --> 03:10:49,804
- Move on. Move on! 
 - One, two, three...

1617
03:10:49,929 --> 03:10:53,725
What are you counting all the time?

1618
03:10:53,850 --> 03:10:58,646
I count to a thousand and start again 
 to keep my feet going.

1619
03:10:58,771 --> 03:11:02,483
You've never needed them before, 
 have you?

1620
03:11:02,609 --> 03:11:06,070
Gentlemen ride in carriages 
 or on horseback.

1621
03:11:06,196 --> 03:11:10,867
I've lived my whole life on foot 
 and yet you outlast me.

1622
03:11:10,992 --> 03:11:15,205
Start again. One, two...

1623
03:11:41,564 --> 03:11:45,777
...24, 25, 26...

1624
03:11:48,571 --> 03:11:50,156
Get up!

1625
03:11:50,865 --> 03:11:53,826
Come on, keep moving!

1626
03:12:09,551 --> 03:12:12,720
Are you afraid, too, friend?

1627
03:12:57,265 --> 03:13:03,771
One, two, three, four, five...

1628
03:13:09,736 --> 03:13:13,448
Halt! Who are you?

1629
03:13:13,573 --> 03:13:19,078
Ensign Rostov. I have a dispatch 
 from the Commander-in-Chief.

1630
03:13:19,204 --> 03:13:21,581
Come, then.

1631
03:13:21,706 --> 03:13:27,295
- How did you find us? 
 - Peasants in the village told me.

1632
03:13:32,550 --> 03:13:35,470
- Dragoons? 
 - Yes, sir.

1633
03:13:35,595 --> 03:13:39,057
- How many infantrymen? 
 - Maybe 100.

1634
03:13:39,182 --> 03:13:42,852
- Or 200? 
 - Yes, sir. Perhaps 200.

1635
03:13:42,977 --> 03:13:46,940
Perhaps? Get out 
 before I lose my temper! Out!

1636
03:14:01,079 --> 03:14:06,209
- When was he captured? 
 - Last night. We won't keep him long.

1637
03:14:06,334 --> 03:14:09,504
I usually do not take prisoners.

1638
03:14:12,131 --> 03:14:17,178
- What is this dispatch? 
 - It's my general's dispatch, sir.

1639
03:14:17,804 --> 03:14:20,265
- Who are you? 
 - Rostov.

1640
03:14:20,390 --> 03:14:23,851
- You have a brother, Nicholas? 
 - Yes. You know him?

1641
03:14:23,977 --> 03:14:25,895
Yes.

1642
03:14:29,274 --> 03:14:34,612
"All patrols are to fall back 
 immediately to join the main army.

1643
03:14:34,737 --> 03:14:37,240
"Prepare for a general attack

1644
03:14:37,365 --> 03:14:41,578
"when the French attempt to cross 
 the Beresina River."

1645
03:14:51,421 --> 03:14:56,384
Rostov, you didn't find me 
 to give me this till tomorrow.

1646
03:14:56,509 --> 03:14:58,011
Why, sir?

1647
03:14:58,136 --> 03:15:04,726
Those French stragglers, I'll attack 
 them tomorrow. One last fight.

1648
03:15:04,851 --> 03:15:10,231
Let me come. I'll say I didn't find you, 
 if you let me fight.

1649
03:15:10,356 --> 03:15:13,359
- No, no! 
 - Let me come.

1650
03:15:13,484 --> 03:15:18,573
It's a bargain. But keep out of trouble 
 or I'll be in trouble with the General.

1651
03:15:18,698 --> 03:15:20,658
Thank you.

1652
03:15:20,783 --> 03:15:22,911
Go and eat something.

1653
03:15:24,370 --> 03:15:27,582
Now, I will move in through the forest.

1654
03:15:27,707 --> 03:15:33,922
You go to the other side of the valley 
 and attack at my signal.

1655
03:15:34,047 --> 03:15:37,091
- Right. Any reserves? 
 - None.

1656
03:15:37,217 --> 03:15:41,262
This is our last fight, 
 and we'll hold back nothing.

1657
03:15:44,098 --> 03:15:48,895
- Ensign. You want some? 
 - Thank you.

1658
03:16:05,954 --> 03:16:09,832
Hungry? Have this.

1659
03:16:09,958 --> 03:16:11,876
Thank you very much.

1660
03:16:29,519 --> 03:16:32,397
Stay behind me at all times.

1661
03:16:32,522 --> 03:16:34,649
Charge!

1662
03:16:41,614 --> 03:16:44,409
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!

1663
03:17:56,731 --> 03:18:00,652
You must've wished 
 you'd killed me in that stupid duel.

1664
03:18:00,777 --> 03:18:05,281
You probably haven't heard 
 that Hélene died in St Petersburg.

1665
03:18:05,406 --> 03:18:11,704
Finally, I want to ask you 
 to forgive me for the harm I did you.

1666
03:18:24,467 --> 03:18:26,386
Halt!

1667
03:18:30,515 --> 03:18:34,352
Take them away. 
 You know what to do with them.

1668
03:18:44,737 --> 03:18:47,115
He wouldn't stay behind.

1669
03:18:47,240 --> 03:18:50,118
It was a game for him.

1670
03:18:50,243 --> 03:18:53,371
His sabre was a toy.

1671
03:18:57,292 --> 03:19:00,461
I never take prisoners!

1672
03:19:52,263 --> 03:19:56,559
Stand by your guns!

1673
03:19:56,684 --> 03:19:58,728
Stand by your guns!

1674
03:20:15,036 --> 03:20:16,538
Fire!

1675
03:21:55,845 --> 03:21:57,972
Yes, burn them.

1676
03:22:51,860 --> 03:22:55,488
- Hurrah, lads! 
 - Hurrah!

1677
03:22:56,698 --> 03:23:00,952
Hurrah! Hurrah!

1678
03:23:01,077 --> 03:23:05,915
I thank you all for your hard 
 and faithful service.

1679
03:23:06,708 --> 03:23:12,171
The victory is complete, 
 and Russia will not forget you!

1680
03:23:12,297 --> 03:23:14,632
Honour to you for ever!

1681
03:23:16,759 --> 03:23:20,138
Hurrah! Hurrah!

1682
03:24:29,332 --> 03:24:34,504
Well, shall we see what's happened 
 to the rest of the house?

1683
03:24:34,629 --> 03:24:36,756
Come on, Mary.

1684
03:24:42,095 --> 03:24:48,393
Sonya, see what the kitchen's like. 
 Prokofy, you might find some tea.

1685
03:24:48,518 --> 03:24:52,730
- Will you look in the cellar? 
 - Very well.

1686
03:25:01,781 --> 03:25:05,952
Mama, Papa! 
 The north wing is just as it was!

1687
03:25:06,077 --> 03:25:10,915
Nothing's happened. 
 We have a house. Half a house!

1688
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:16,087
Isn't it wonderful? 
 Mama, you can come and rest.

1689
03:25:16,212 --> 03:25:18,339
We're home.

1690
03:25:19,048 --> 03:25:22,510
Dunyasha, 
 make Mama a cold compress.

1691
03:25:22,635 --> 03:25:26,472
Take this footstool. 
 She always liked that.

1692
03:25:26,598 --> 03:25:33,271
The baby can go in my room. 
 Up you go! There.

1693
03:25:33,396 --> 03:25:36,441
I hope we find a bottle of port.

1694
03:25:36,566 --> 03:25:42,655
You see, Mary? You'll have 
 a born optimist as a father-in-law.

1695
03:26:09,849 --> 03:26:15,104
{y:i}I have loved you 
 {y:i}from the first moment I saw you.

1696
03:26:21,444 --> 03:26:25,698
{y:i}Hurry up, Nicholas! You're delaying 
 {y:i}the trip to the country!

1697
03:26:49,305 --> 03:26:51,224
Pierre!

1698
03:26:53,184 --> 03:26:58,231
We were so worried when we heard 
 you were taken prisoner.

1699
03:27:00,066 --> 03:27:02,902
You've come back.

1700
03:27:16,916 --> 03:27:19,419
You're like this house.

1701
03:27:19,544 --> 03:27:24,841
You suffer, you show your wounds, 
 but you stand.
