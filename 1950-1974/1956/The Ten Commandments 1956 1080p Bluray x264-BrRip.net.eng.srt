1
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,464
Ladies and gentlemen, young and old,

2
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,967
this may seem an unusual procedure,

3
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,174
speaking to you
before the picture begins,

4
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,806
but we have an unusual subject:

5
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,717
the story of the birth of freedom.

6
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,227
The story of Moses.

7
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,604
As many of you know,

8
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:23,065
the Holy Bible omits
some 30 years of Moses' life,

9
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,480
from the time he was
a three-month-old baby

10
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,026
and was found in the bulrushes
by Bithiah,

11
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,785
the daughter of Pharaoh,

12
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,412
and adopted into the court of Egypt

13
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,292
until he learned that he was Hebrew

14
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,078
and killed the Egyptian.

15
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,417
To fill in those missing years,

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,459
we turned to ancient historians

17
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,549
such as Philo and Josephus.

18
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,433
Philo wrote at the time that
Jesus of Nazareth walked the Earth,

19
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,141
and Josephus wrote some 50 years later

20
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,900
and watched the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Romans.

21
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,107
These historians had access
to documents

22
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,819
long since destroyed,
or perhaps lost,

23
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,609
like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

24
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,036
The theme of this picture

25
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,950
is whether men are
to be ruled by God's law,

26
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,838
or whether they are to be ruled by
the whims of a dictator like Rameses.

27
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,249
Are men the property of the state,

28
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,260
or are they free souls under God?

29
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,767
This same battle continues
throughout the world today.

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:40,145
Our intention was not to create a story,

31
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:45,480
but to be worthy
of the divinely inspired story

32
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,987
created 3,000 years ago:

33
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,319
the five books of Moses.

34
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,657
The story takes three hours
and 39 minutes to unfold.

35
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,322
There will be an intermission.

36
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,661
Thank you for your attention.

37
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,632
And God said, "Let there be light."

38
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,267
And there was light.

39
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:35,683
And from this light,
God created life upon Earth.

40
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,860
And man was given dominion

41
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,863
over all things upon this Earth,

42
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:47,119
and the power to choose
between good and evil,

43
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,951
but each sought to do his own will

44
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,617
because he knew not
the light of God's law.

45
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,286
Man took dominion over man.

46
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,048
The conquered
were made to serve the conqueror

47
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,961
The weak were made to serve the strong.

48
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,848
And freedom was gone from the world.

49
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,556
So did the Egyptians
cause the children of Israel

50
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,096
to serve with rigor;

51
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:18,233
and their lives were made bitter
with hard bondage,

52
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,022
and their cry came up unto God
and God heard them.

53
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,236
And cast into Egypt,

54
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,948
into the lowly hut
of Amram and Yochabel,

55
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,158
the seed of a man

56
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,495
upon whose mind and heart
would be written

57
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,661
God's law and God's commandments.

58
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,549
One man to stand alone
against an empire.

59
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,084
Divine One,

60
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,630
last night our astrologers
saw an evil star

61
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,846
- enter into the house of Egypt.
- Meaning war?

62
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,683
From the frontiers of Sinai and Libya
to the cataracts of the Nile.

63
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,223
What nation would dare
draw the sword against us?

64
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,733
The enemy to fear
is in the heart of Egypt.

65
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,892
What?

66
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,067
The Hebrew slaves
in the land of Goshen.

67
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,860
I number my enemies by their swords,

68
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,323
not by their chains, High Priest.

69
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,956
Chains have been forged
into swords before now, Divine One.

70
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,994
Among these slaves,
there is a prophecy of a deliverer

71
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,629
who will lead them out of bondage.
The star proclaims his birth.

72
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,211
Then let the Hebrews die.

73
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,502
Slaves are wealth, Commander.

74
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,387
The more slaves we have,
the more bricks we make.

75
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,892
I would still see fewer bricks made
and fewer Hebrews in Goshen.

76
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,849
It is our eastern gate.

77
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,810
Since this deliverer
is among their newborn,

78
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,943
only their newborn need die.

79
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:50,409
Every newborn Hebrew man-child
shall die.

80
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,322
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

81
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,036
So speaks Rameses I.

82
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,706
No!

83
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,984
Oh, no!

84
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,262
Please! Please! No!

85
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,544
God of Abraham,

86
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,463
take my child into thy hands,

87
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,053
that he may live to thy service.

88
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,236
But Mother,
we have not even given him a name.

89
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,897
God will give him a name.

90
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,043
Follow it, Miriam.

91
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,330
Watch it from the reeds.

92
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,755
- See where the Lord will lead him.
- Yes, Mother.

93
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,788
- Why didn't you say no?
- She didn't think of it.

94
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,408
Here! Throw!

95
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,871
- You're getting fat.
- Too many sesame cakes!

96
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,333
Catch a lotus and you catch a wish.

97
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,088
What will you wish for,
Tuya, gold or a man?

98
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,380
Gold, of course.

99
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,677
- Then I could have any man!
- Gold will never fill an empty heart.

100
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,892
Quiet, you chattering geese.

101
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,933
Memnet, you're only happy
when you're miserable.

102
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:33,572
You fools! Talk of empty hearts
before the Pharaoh's daughter.

103
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,405
What is there in her heart,
but the memory of a dead husband?

104
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,070
We meant no harm, Memnet.

105
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,702
Look, there's something here!

106
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,792
Be sure it's not a crocodile!

107
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,083
Bithiah can charm tears
from a crocodile.

108
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,613
What is it, Bithiah?
What did you End?

109
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,991
Only a drifting basket.

110
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,082
- Shall we come and help you get it?
- Memnet, send the girls away.

111
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,037
I'd rather be alone now.

112
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,959
Now see what you've done.
Back to the palace, all of you.

113
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,376
- Go on. All of you. Musicians, too.
- We wouldn't hurt Bithiah.

114
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,466
Bithiah's tired of you and so am I.
Off you go.

115
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,508
- You're tired of everything.
- Go on. Off you go.

116
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,929
Go on. Hurry up!
You've hurt her enough.

117
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,531
- What have you found?
- The answer to my prayers.

118
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,071
You prayed for a basket?

119
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,459
No. I prayed for a son.

120
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,670
Your husband
is in the house of the dead.

121
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,754
And he has asked the Nile god
to bring me this beautiful boy.

122
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,224
Do you know the pattern
of this cloth?

123
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,977
If my son is covered in it...

124
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,192
...it is a royal robe.

125
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,855
Royal? It is the Levite cloth
of a Hebrew slave.

126
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,194
This child was put upon the water

127
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,451
to save its life
from your father's edict.

128
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,864
I am the Pharaoh's daughter,
and this is my son.

129
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,207
He shall be reared in my house
as the Prince of the Two Lands.

130
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,253
My mother and her mother before her

131
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,589
were branded to the Pharaoh's service.

132
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,176
I will not see you make this son
of slaves a prince of Egypt.

133
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,761
You will see it, Memnet.

134
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,224
You will see him walk
with his head among the eagles.

135
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,357
And you will serve him as you serve me.

136
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,021
Fill the ark with water.
Sink it into silence.

137
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,846
Raise your hands, Memnet.

138
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,931
What you have buried in the Nile
shall remain buried in your heart.

139
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,643
- Swear it.
- I will be silent.

140
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,776
The day you break that oath will be
the last your eyes shall ever see.

141
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,617
You will be the glory of Egypt, my son.

142
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,703
Mighty in words and deeds.

143
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,334
Kings shall bow before you.

144
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:19,373
Your name will live
when the pyramids are dust.

145
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,739
And...

146
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:27,006
...because I drew you from the water,
you shall be called Moses.

147
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,771
Moses! Moses!

148
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,976
Moses...

149
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,071
He proclaims his coming from afar,
does he not, my son?

150
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,083
Such favor with the people
can be dangerous, Great Sethi.

151
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,621
To whom, Rameses? To me or to you?

152
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:05,169
It would not be the first time that fame
has turned a prince against his Pharaoh.

153
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,383
Or that envy has turned a brother
against his brother.

154
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,889
Envy is for the weak.

155
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,425
And beauty is for the strong.

156
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,594
That is what you have in mind.

157
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,810
If you mean Nefretiri, yes, my father.

158
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,734
Is it the princess'
beauty that attracts you, Rameses,

159
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,363
or the fact that she must marry the man
I choose to follow me on the throne?

160
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,152
I am the son of your body.

161
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,195
Who else could be your heir?

162
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,457
The man best able to rule Egypt
will follow me.

163
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,796
I owe that to my fathers,
not to my sons.

164
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,959
- Then I shall follow you.
- Shall you?

165
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,755
Do not let ambition
shave your prince's lock.

166
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,175
I sent Moses to destroy a city.
He returns in triumph.

167
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,765
I sent you to build a city.

168
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,305
Where is it?

169
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,600
It will rise when I have put fear

170
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,861
into the stiff-necked
Hebrew slaves who build it.

171
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,693
But this I know, my father:

172
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,745
no pretended brother

173
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,123
will ever have your crown...

174
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,167
...or Nefretiri.

175
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,726
Indeed?

176
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,749
Whoever I choose shall have my crown...

177
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,052
...and Nefretiri.

178
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,437
I think I see him, Memnet.

179
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,864
Moses...

180
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,191
Yes, I can see him!

181
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,554
Moses!

182
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,119
Listen, Memnet. Listen.

183
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,131
The trumpets tell all the world
he's come back to me.

184
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,916
Hear them.

185
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,296
And all those shouts are drowned
by the beating of my heart.

186
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,464
- Moses!
- Do you hear, Memnet?

187
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:20,808
- The whole city calls his name.
- I hear them, Nefretiri.

188
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,808
The Lord Moses, Prince of Egypt,

189
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,103
son of the Pharaoh's sister,

190
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,025
beloved of the Nile god,
commander of the Southern Host.

191
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,915
Welcome home!

192
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,668
- Prince Moses!
- The blessings of the god Amun-Ra

193
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,004
be upon you, Great Prince.

194
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,670
He has brought down
the pride of Ethiopia.

195
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,840
- Yes, that is...
- The old windbag.

196
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,969
- I agree with him.
- May your name be exalted on Earth,

197
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:06,187
o' conqueror, even as the sun
is exalted in the heavens.

198
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,904
Welcome to my sister's son.

199
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,443
We have heard how you took
ibis from the Nile

200
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,454
to destroy the venomous serpents
used against you

201
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,957
when you laid siege
to the city of Saba.

202
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,915
May my arms stay strong
in your service, Great Sethi.

203
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:34,837
Who is this fair young god
come into the house of Pharaoh?

204
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,973
No need to tell you
how I share her joy at your return-

205
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,384
No need, my brother.

206
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,430
Great one, I bring you Ethiopia!

207
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,531
Command them to kneel before Pharaoh.

208
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,037
Command what you have conquered,
my brother.

209
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,584
I bring the Ethiopian king
and his sister in friendship,

210
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,370
as an ally to guard our southern gates.

211
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:15,419
My son has dealt wisely with you,
Ethiopia. Welcome as a friend.

212
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,808
Great king, I will ask
but one favor of your friendship.

213
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,889
This green stone from our mountains,

214
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,559
that I may give it to your
Prince of Egypt,

215
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,821
for he is kind, as well as wise.

216
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:40,944
It is pleasing to the gods to see
a man honored by his enemies.

217
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,989
And such a beautiful enemy!

218
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,791
See to their comfort.

219
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:02,549
Divine One, here is the full count
of Ethiopia's tribute.

220
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,138
Bearers!

221
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:40,637
I am sending down the Nile 20 full
barges of such wealth as you see here.

222
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,798
Logs of ebony and trees of myrrh,

223
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,058
all for your new treasure city.

224
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,846
A handsome tribute indeed, Moses.

225
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,561
Unfortunately,
I have no new treasure city.

226
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,851
And you will have none.

227
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,190
The stiff-necked slaves
die more willingly

228
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:01,358
- than bend their backs in your service.
- Why?

229
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,902
They believe a deliverer has come
to lead them from their bondage.

230
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,913
Deliverer? Deliverer?!

231
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,576
He has been foretold by every falling
star since my father's time.

232
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,370
Now, you make him an excuse
for your failure to build my city.

233
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,914
I am not one to make excuses-

234
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,085
If you doubt me,

235
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,253
let Moses build a city.

236
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,820
No! No.

237
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,760
He's just trying
to keep Moses away from you, Sethi.

238
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,803
Or you, perhaps.

239
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,691
I think our roosters would crow
more softly on another roof.

240
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,186
Stand before me, both of you.

241
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,073
Would you please your Pharaoh, Moses?

242
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:51,116
- Your wish is my will.
- Then you build my city.

243
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,080
A wise decision.

244
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,665
A noble task.

245
00:24:55,828 --> 00:25:00,459
Rameses, do you believe
this slave deliverer is a myth?

246
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,218
What I believe is of no account.

247
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,301
What matters is
the slaves believe in him.

248
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,636
Of course, of course.

249
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,474
Then you, too, shall go to Goshen-

250
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,480
Learn if this deliverer
be a myth or a man.

251
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,485
If a myth, bring him to me in a bottle.
If a man,

252
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,112
bring him to me in chains.

253
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:27,402
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

254
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,390
Your fragrance
is like the wine of Babylon.

255
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,691
I could...

256
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,695
But you are the throne princess,

257
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,700
and by the Pharaoh's law,
you can marry only a Pharaoh.

258
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,161
I shall marry a Pharaoh...

259
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,013
...you.

260
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,621
Rameses might not agree
with that idea.

261
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,876
But Sethi might.

262
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,333
While you were gone,
I kept your name on his lips,

263
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,500
your praises in his ears.
But now, unless you can succeed,

264
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,425
you'll be the prince
of some desert province

265
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,386
and I'll be Rameses' wife. Oh, Moses!

266
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,721
Build a city for him,
and Sethi will deny you nothing.

267
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,557
I will build the city for love of Sethi,

268
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,813
not for the throne of Egypt.

269
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,224
But I am Egypt.

270
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:48,240
Now, the flame you lighted
burns close to the throne.

271
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,903
Your tongue would dig
your grave, Memnet.

272
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,916
A conqueror already conquered?

273
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:02,171
The first face I looked for
and the last I find. Mother.

274
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,424
I was thanking the gods
for your safe return.

275
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,506
But I find you in grave danger here.

276
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,434
In intoxicating danger, Mother.

277
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,598
Marry her if you can, my son,
but never fall in love with her.

278
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,234
I'll be less trouble to him
than the Hebrew slaves of Goshen.

279
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,793
Goshen?

280
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,860
You've guzzled enough.
Bring those bricks up and get on.

281
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,987
You, there's other swine to water.

282
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,819
Water girl! Water!

283
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,983
Get those bricks back on.

284
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,412
Here! Water lily!

285
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,072
My name is Lilia.

286
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,663
To me you are a lily,
and I want water.

287
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,634
Joshua...

288
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,511
Joshua, I thought
you'd never come down.

289
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,176
Water before love, my girl.

290
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,688
Does it take the whole Nile
to quench your thirst?

291
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,603
No, just your lips.

292
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,491
Be careful, my love.
Dathan's eyes can see through stone.

293
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,529
Dathan is a vulture feeding
on the flesh of his own people.

294
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,073
When he looks at me, I'm afraid.

295
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,493
If he touches you,
I'll strangle him with his own whip.

296
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,378
And bring death to 1,000 others?

297
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,006
Is life in bondage better than death?

298
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,096
Joshua, we must have hope.

299
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,724
God will send us the deliverer.

300
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:23,353
Hope? On the heels
of every hope walks Dathan.

301
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,584
You're Dathan, the Hebrew overseer.

302
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:59,177
Chief Hebrew overseer, mighty one.

303
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,845
Baka, the master builder,
has told me that I can rely on you.

304
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,356
I am warmed by his favor.

305
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,943
Rely on you to sell
your own mother for a price.

306
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:17,283
And who am I to deny the word
of the master builder?

307
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,571
Where is this would-be deliverer
who would set the Hebrews free?

308
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,908
Who can say, immortal prince?

309
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,076
They do not confide in me.

310
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,416
- But it is possible to learn.
- No doubt.

311
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,506
You have rat's ears and a ferret's nose.

312
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,263
To use in your service, son of Pharaoh.

313
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,472
Add to them the eyes of a weasel
and find me this deliverer.

314
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,788
Lean your backs into it!

315
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,174
Old woman! Old woman!

316
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,839
More grease under the center stone.

317
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,446
- Yochabel!
- Help me!

318
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,289
Stop the stone!

319
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,211
Keep pulling up there.

320
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,544
Yochabel is caught. Stop the stone!

321
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,882
Come on, pull!

322
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,716
Pull!

323
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,219
Pull!

324
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:21,149
- Pull!
- You'll kill her! Stop the stone!

325
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,193
We don't stop a moving block
for an old woman.

326
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,408
Lay on the lash! Keep it moving!

327
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,038
Stop the stone! Stop the stone!

328
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,761
Hold the ropes!

329
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,182
Water! Water!

330
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,775
- Cut the old woman loose.
- She'll stay where she is,

331
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,440
and you'll die in the lion pits.

332
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:07,828
- Joshua!
- Run to the prince and beg mercy.

333
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,909
- Mercy from Rameses?!
- No, no.

334
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,790
The Prince Moses,
there on the pavilion.

335
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,463
- After her! After her!
- Hold him!

336
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,838
Stop her!

337
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,004
Stop that girl!

338
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,845
The water girl, stop her!

339
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,937
Stop that girl! Stop her!

340
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,315
Mercy, Prince Moses!

341
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,818
- Mercy, Prince Moses!
- Come here.

342
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,073
- Mercy? What have you done?
- Not for myself, Lord Prince.

343
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:52,331
For a slave who saved old Yochabel
and me from death

344
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,742
between the granite blocks.

345
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,162
A delicate flower
to be pressed between walls of stone.

346
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,329
How were you saved?

347
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,169
A stonecutter struck the overseer.

348
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,710
There can be only one punishment
for the stonecutter.

349
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,597
Blood makes poor mortar. Come.

350
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,395
Prince Moses!

351
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,654
Get away, you!

352
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:29,034
Would you bury the old woman alive
in a tomb of rock?

353
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,911
My noble one, it caught.

354
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,546
I had not the strength to free myself.

355
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,754
Your shoulder should not
bear a burden, old woman.

356
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:50,138
The Lord has renewed my strength
and lightened my burdens.

357
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,226
He would have done better
to remove them.

358
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:01,149
They use the old ones to do the work
of greasing the stones, Lord Prince.

359
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,561
If they are killed, it is no loss.

360
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,027
Are you a master builder
or a master butcher?

361
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,488
If we stopped moving stones
for every grease woman who falls,

362
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,323
the city would never rise.

363
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,863
If the slaves are not driven
they will not work.

364
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,374
If their work lags,
it is because they are not fed.

365
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,749
You seem strong enough.

366
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,208
I am a stonecutter.
The Pharaohs like their images cut deep.

367
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,622
Hold your whip!

368
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,346
You know it is death
to strike an Egyptian?

369
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,427
I know it.

370
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,311
- Yet you struck him? Why?
- To save the old woman.

371
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,897
- What is she to you?
- An old woman.

372
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,229
Lord Prince, send him to his death.

373
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,268
The man has courage.

374
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,403
You do not speak like a slave.

375
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,162
God made men.

376
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,115
- Men made slaves.
- Which god?

377
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,281
The God of Abraham, the Almighty God.

378
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,452
If your god is almighty,
why does he leave you in bondage?

379
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,963
He will choose the hour
of our freedom

380
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,964
and the man who will deliver us.

381
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:11,503
- Lord Prince, this man speaks treason.
- It is not treason to want freedom.

382
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,764
Release him.

383
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,769
Difficulty with the slaves, my brother?

384
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:31,486
None that could not be cured by
a ration of grain and a day of rest.

385
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,155
A day of rest?

386
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,695
When your horses tire, they're rested.

387
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,829
When they hunger, they're fed.

388
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:44,165
Slaves draw stone and brick.
My horses draw the next Pharaoh.

389
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,671
Is there any grain
stored here in Goshen?

390
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,674
None that you would
dare take, my brother.

391
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,211
The temple granaries are full.

392
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,514
Bring the push-pole men
and some women with baskets.

393
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,847
I will... great prince.

394
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,098
I warn you, Moses,
the temple grain belongs to the gods.

395
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:08,440
What the gods can digest will
not sour in the belly of a slave.

396
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,738
- Push-pole men!
- You, back where you belong!

397
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,867
I have the prince's orders.
One and two poles, up!

398
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,450
- Bring 100 women with baskets.
- Elisheba, bring your basket.

399
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,250
Push-polers, follow me.

400
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,677
Out of the way!

401
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,804
Break open the bins.

402
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,092
Out of the way. Stand back.

403
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,758
Well, well.

404
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,020
Divine One.

405
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,256
There!

406
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,944
My jackals have your hounds at bay-

407
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,698
Dogs at bay are dangerous.

408
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,735
When they walk upright
and feed on temple grain.

409
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,531
Of course. You've been bringing
petitions against Moses for months.

410
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,245
Well, the city's being built
and I'm winning this game,

411
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,205
so don't interrupt us with trifles.

412
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:52,623
Before your city is finished,
these trifles will surprise you.

413
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,042
Life is full of surprises.

414
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,846
And today I have one for you, my kitten.

415
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,165
Moses!

416
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,825
And Rameses.

417
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,726
You crocodile!

418
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,485
Triples. You've lost.
I'll never let you win again.

419
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:23,029
You thought that by losing to me
you would win for Moses.

420
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,199
Well, you know, crowns are sometimes
lost by smiles and dimples.

421
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,244
- And so is patience.
- Yours?

422
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,504
Are the plans for my jubilee complete?

423
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:37,168
All but your proclamation for the
marriage of Prince Rameses to Nefretiri.

424
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,333
No.

425
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,258
Are you quite sure it will be Rameses?

426
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,674
Who else could be your successor?

427
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,968
Moses, of course.

428
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,980
Because of Moses there is no wheat
in the temple granaries.

429
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:54,518
You don't look any leaner. You're both
very generous with your advice.

430
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,936
Will you take mine?

431
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,275
No, I will choose my own successor-

432
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,963
Did you lose your head, my sweet?

433
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,423
I sent you to Goshen
to bring me the head of the jackal

434
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,840
who would free the slaves.
Where is it?

435
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,759
The slaves do not need a deliverer now.

436
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,226
- They have Moses.
- Is that a riddle?

437
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,563
He gives them the priests' grain
and one day in seven to rest.

438
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,195
They call it the day of Moses.

439
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:43,575
- This man makes himself a god.
- I prefer him as a man.

440
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,077
You would prefer him as Pharaoh.

441
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,364
- Are you afraid of Moses?
- Yes.

442
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,749
'Cause now he holds Ethiopia
in his left hand,

443
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,162
Goshen in his right, and you,
my Pharaoh, are in between them.

444
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,958
Do you imply that he
would raise the slaves against me?

445
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,844
- I've been his father.
- Ambition knows no father.

446
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,302
Moses could no more betray you
than I could, Sethi.

447
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,680
He can tell me that when he arrives.

448
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:14,473
- He will not be here, my father.
- What?

449
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,770
I sent for both of you.

450
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,904
His word is that he cannot attend you,
being pressed by...

451
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,905
...other matters.

452
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:27,114
Did you hear that? Other matters?

453
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,950
My escort.

454
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,084
I will ride with you, my son,

455
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:43,297
to see what rears itself in Goshen,
a city or treason.

456
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:51,051
You lying adder! You'll destroy
yourself with your own venom

457
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,015
if you try to turn Sethi against Moses.

458
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,021
You would turn Sethi against me.

459
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,322
Remember, my sweet, that you must
be wife to the next Pharaoh,

460
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,484
that you're going to be mine,
all mine,

461
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,368
like my dog or my horse or my falcon.

462
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,873
Only I will love you more,
and trust you less.

463
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,662
You will never do the things to me
you would have done to Moses.

464
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,732
I know you, my sweet.

465
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,194
You're a sharp-clawed,
treacherous little peacock.

466
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,365
But you're food for the gods,

467
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,030
and I'm going to have all of you.

468
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,397
None of me.

469
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:00,420
Did you think my kiss
was a promise of what you'll have?

470
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,172
No, my pompous one,

471
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,505
it was to let you know
what you will not have.

472
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,096
I could never love you.

473
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,265
Does that matter?

474
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,186
You will be my wife.

475
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,316
You will come to me whenever I call you.

476
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,815
And I will enjoy that very much.

477
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,065
Whether you enjoy it or not
is your own affair.

478
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,532
But I think you will.

479
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:52,589
That drop puts too much strain
on the stone. We need more sand.

480
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,847
I'm going to risk it, Baka.

481
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,387
There's little time
till the day of jubilee.

482
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,558
If the stone cracks,
you may crack with it.

483
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,976
Ready blue signal.

484
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,816
Blue pennant.

485
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,817
Blue pennant!

486
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,244
- The snubber is ready.
- Green pennant.

487
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,344
Mallet men, ready!

488
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,508
Mallet men, ready, stand by!

489
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,426
Clear the main hawser!

490
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,516
Mallet men ready.

491
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,152
You are not pleased to see me here.

492
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:56,161
I am, Great Pharaoh, but now
I have important things to do.

493
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,287
Red pennant, stand by.

494
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,909
So Rameses tells me.

495
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,793
More important things
than obeying my orders?

496
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,126
You ordered me to finish this city-
The strain in that stone is too great-

497
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,667
We cannot wait. Red pennant.

498
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,972
Red pennant... strike!

499
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,769
- The stone will break.
- There are 2,000 slaves on the ropes.

500
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,850
There is the obelisk of your jubilee.

501
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,727
Baka, put 1,000 slaves
to removing the sand

502
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,309
until the stone settles to its base.

503
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,526
- Pharaoh is pleased?
- With the obelisk, yes,

504
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,068
but not with certain accusations
made against you.

505
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,834
By whom?

506
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,452
- You raided the temple granaries?
- Yes.

507
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:29,037
- You gave the grain to the slaves?
- Yes.

508
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,423
You gave them one day in seven to rest.

509
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,581
Yes-

510
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,635
Did you do all of this
to gain their favor?

511
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,768
A city is built of brick, Pharaoh.

512
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,645
The strong make many.
The starving make few.

513
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,527
The dead make none.

514
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,063
So much for accusations.

515
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,357
Now, judge the results.

516
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,826
The pylons commemorate your victory
at Kadesh,

517
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,370
where you broke the Amorites.

518
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:15,463
- Are there any higher in Egypt?
- There are none higher in the world.

519
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:21,343
With so many slaves,
you could build... an army.

520
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,303
But I have built a city.

521
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:27,312
Sixteen of these lions of Pharaoh
will guard its gates.

522
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,019
And it shall be the city
of Sethi's glory.

523
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,024
Are these slaves loyal
to Sethi's glory,

524
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,110
or to you, Moses?

525
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,067
The slaves worship their god...

526
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,321
...and I serve only you.

527
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:59,381
Let your own image proclaim
my loyalty for a thousand years.

528
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,113
Superb!

529
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,983
Rameses.

530
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,525
And this you call treason?

531
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:18,984
Who would take a throne by force
that he has earned by deeds?

532
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,192
With this and Ethiopia,

533
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,409
your name shall be carved
beside mine on every pylon.

534
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,955
Yours, Rameses, will be nowhere.

535
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:35,668
In my judgment book, you have
accused your brother falsely.

536
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,830
Come.

537
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:39,584
Great Pharaoh,
he is the son of your body.

538
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,220
I need no help, Moses,
to hold what is mine.

539
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,554
I decide what is yours.

540
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,014
Come with me, Moses.

541
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,950
Will you lose the throne
because Moses builds a city?

542
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,872
The city that he builds
shall bear my name.

543
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:15,624
The woman that he loves
shall bear my child.

544
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,923
So it shall be written.

545
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,300
So it shall be done.

546
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:40,107
Yes. This is for the temple ceremony.

547
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,856
This...

548
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,386
This...

549
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,581
...is for my wedding night.

550
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,462
You will never wear it.

551
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,889
Why not?

552
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:07,718
I have brought you a cloth
more revealing. Send them away.

553
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:13,223
Go, then, while I hear what this
puckered old persimmon has to say.

554
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:22,395
Well? What croakings
of doom have you today?

555
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,155
You prepare for a marriage
that will never be.

556
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,658
You've been drinking honey wine!

557
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,579
I shall not let the Pharaoh
and Rameses be betrayed.

558
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:37,335
Why should a slave care
which Pharaoh rules?

559
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,746
For 30 years, I have been silent.

560
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:43,837
Now, all the kings of Egypt
cry out to me from their tombs,

561
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,424
"Let no Hebrew sit upon our throne."

562
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,174
What are you saying?

563
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,844
Rameses has the blood of many kings.

564
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,514
- And Moses?
- He is lower than the dust.

565
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:03,187
Not one drop of royal blood
flows through his veins.

566
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:06,026
He is the son of Hebrew slaves.

567
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,660
I'll have you torn into so many pieces,

568
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,572
even the vultures won't find them.

569
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,615
Who hatched this lie? Rameses?

570
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,535
Rameses does not know... yet.

571
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,919
You will repeat this to Bithiah!

572
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,709
It was Bithiah who drew a slave child
from the Nile,

573
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,253
called him son and Prince of Egypt,

574
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,343
blinding herself to the truth

575
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,634
and the pain of an empty womb.

576
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,511
Were you alone with Bithiah?

577
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:41,399
A little girl led me
to the Hebrew woman Yochabel,

578
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,902
that the child might
be suckled by his true mother.

579
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,731
Take care, old frog.

580
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,485
You croak too much against Moses.

581
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,246
Would you mingle the blood
of slaves with your own?

582
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,784
He will be my husband.
I shall have no other.

583
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,580
Then use this to wrap your first-born.

584
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:07,216
Torn from a Levite's robe.

585
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,718
It was Moses' swaddling cloth.

586
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,842
And your shroud!

587
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,888
You think I care whose son he is?

588
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,559
- Rameses cares.
- You won't live to tell him.

589
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,116
Nefretiri?

590
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:49,710
Nefretiri! Have you closed your doors
to make a beggar of a prince?

591
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:58,635
I'm the beggar, Moses, begging you
to hold me in your arms. Kiss me.

592
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,474
Just kiss me.

593
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,309
You're no beggar, my love.

594
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:11,322
You're a conqueror,
and I am your captive for life.

595
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:16,069
One lifetime will not be half enough.

596
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,159
You will be King of Egypt.

597
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,493
And I will be your footstool.

598
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,629
A man stupid enough
to use you for a footstool

599
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,165
would not be wise enough to rule Egypt.

600
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,708
Princess!

601
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,469
Princess, the raven has dropped
a black feather at your door.

602
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,098
- Who can...?
- No, Moses, leave the world outside.

603
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,760
Pardon, pardon, royal one.

604
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,055
- The old nurse, Memnet...
- Go away.

605
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,600
- I don't want to hear anything.
- What about Memnet?

606
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,270
She's dead. She must
have fallen from the balcony.

607
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:55,317
I will not hear unhappy things tonight.
Go away!

608
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,494
Old Memnet must have walked
that balcony a thousand times.

609
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,409
What is the death of one slave to us?

610
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,204
She was a faithful servant to you.

611
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:12,466
Can one so rich in love
be so poor in pity?

612
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,969
What kind of a woman
holds me captive?

613
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,507
One who loves you
and will not lose you.

614
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,053
One who will be your wife. Nothing in
the world can change that. Nothing.

615
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,065
Neither Rameses' princely plots
nor Memnet's evil lies.

616
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,567
You've heard Memnet grumbling
all your life.

617
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,696
Why should it upset you now?

618
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,778
Because she grumbled against you.

619
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,739
Oh, let her threats be buried with her.

620
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,575
Look, the night's a crown of stars,

621
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,085
and the darkness a robe
of forgetfulness.

622
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,747
Come, love. Let's share them.
We'll use the moon for a scepter.

623
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,510
- A piece of Hebrew cloth!
- Memnet may have dropped it.

624
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,093
Memnet was not Hebrew.
Why would she bring this here?

625
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,384
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

626
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:07,597
- Tell me.
- She was taking it to Rameses...

627
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,350
- ...to destroy you.
- To de...?

628
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,566
How could Rameses destroy me
with a piece of cloth?

629
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:19,734
Moses, Moses, why do you question
me? Why do you care? Yes!

630
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,994
I killed her.

631
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,747
What does it matter?
A hundred slaves die every day.

632
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,625
- What's done is forgotten.
- It is not forgotten.

633
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,128
What is this cloth
to do with me? Tell me.

634
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,209
It will make no difference between us?

635
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,879
How could it make a difference?

636
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,468
A child was wrapped in it.

637
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,430
- What child?
- Bithiah took him from the river.

638
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,594
Memnet was with her.

639
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,476
Who was this child?

640
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,985
Memnet is dead. No one need know
who you are. I love you.

641
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,486
I killed for you.

642
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,864
I'll kill anyone that comes between us.

643
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,070
Why did you kill for me, Nefretiri?

644
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:04,703
If you love me, do not lie.
Who was the child?

645
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,619
Hold me in your arms.

646
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,456
Hold me... close.

647
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:17,751
You were not born
Prince of Egypt, Moses...

648
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,429
...but the son of Hebrew slaves.

649
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,062
You believe that?

650
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,316
I'll believe anything
you want me to believe.

651
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,944
Say you are not,
I'll believe you are not.

652
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:42,654
Love cannot drown truth, Nefretiri.

653
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:49,661
You do believe it,
or you would not have killed Memnet.

654
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:56,297
I love you.
That's the only truth I know.

655
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,386
Did this child of the Nile
have a mother?

656
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,770
Memnet called her Yochabel.

657
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,061
I will ask Bithiah.

658
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,031
How could you doubt me?

659
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:26,535
You did not doubt me when I held you
as you took your first step.

660
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,913
It's a wicked lie spun by Rameses.

661
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,746
Mother, did Rameses spin this?

662
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:38,418
The word of your mother against
a piece of cloth found by Memnet?

663
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,207
How did you know it was Memnet?

664
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,925
Who else? Memnet nursed Rameses.

665
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,761
She shall pay for spreading his lies.

666
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:51,097
- She has paid.
- She's dead?

667
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,432
At the hand of Nefretiri.

668
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:04,531
Put away any fears or suspicions
that may remain with you, my son.

669
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,443
Why, your will will be law in Egypt
when you are crowned

670
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,907
and sceptered as her king.

671
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:21,715
Memnet spoke of a Hebrew woman
named Yochabel.

672
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,001
Did you ever know her?

673
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:28,796
No.

674
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:44,238
Yours was the face
I saw above my cradle,

675
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,899
the only mother I've ever known.

676
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:53,322
Wherever I am led
or whatever I must do,

677
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,162
I will always love you.

678
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,019
My chariot. I will drive to Goshen.

679
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,197
A chariot here in Goshen?

680
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:53,800
- You know who I am?
- It has been many years, great one.

681
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,729
- Who are they?
- All that remain of my children.

682
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,935
I will speak to you alone.

683
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:09,360
Why have you...?

684
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,574
- Why have you come here?
- Because Moses will come here.

685
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,040
- My son?
- No, my son.

686
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,421
And that's all that he must know.

687
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,753
My lips might deny him, great one,

688
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,759
but my eyes never could.

689
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:33,422
You shall leave Goshen,
you and your family, tonight.

690
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,307
We are Levites,
appointed shepherds of Israel.

691
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,934
We cannot leave our people.

692
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,393
Would you take from Moses
all that I have given him?

693
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,604
Would you undo all
that I have done for him?

694
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,690
I have put the throne of Egypt
within his reach.

695
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:51,949
- What can you give him in its place?
- I gave him life.

696
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:56,704
I gave him love!
Was it your hand that dried his tears?

697
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,364
And when he was troubled,
was it your heart that ached for him?

698
01:00:59,464 --> 01:01:00,464
Yes-

699
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:05,125
My heart ached for him.

700
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,837
And my arms ached to hold him,

701
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:13,004
but I dared not even touch
the hem of his garment.

702
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:18,054
His heritage from me
could only have been misery,

703
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,891
poverty and the lash.

704
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:27,359
No, I will not take from him the
glory and riches you have given him.

705
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,111
For this you shall be well cared for.

706
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,568
You and your family shall be taken
from Goshen tonight.

707
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:41,081
No matter where you send me,

708
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,164
if the God of Abraham
has a purpose for my son,

709
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:49,332
he will come to know it and fulfill it.

710
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,089
Come, gather your things, quickly.

711
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,596
Quickly.
I shall see you want for nothing.

712
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,554
You and your children
shall be given freedom.

713
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:04,096
Has my mother forgotten?
Only the Pharaoh can free a slave.

714
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,983
Moses! Do not enter.
There is only sorrow here.

715
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,439
Are you comforting it, my mother?

716
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:14,152
I followed you here
to find this woman, Yochabel...

717
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,543
You were the woman
who was caught between the stones.

718
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,671
- Until you came.
- My son, if you love me...

719
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,675
I love you, my mother,
but am I your son?

720
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,300
Or yours?

721
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,592
No, you are not my son.

722
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:49,142
If you believe that men and women
are cattle to be driven under the lash,

723
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,732
if you can bow before idols of stone

724
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:56,148
and golden images of beasts...

725
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,155
...you are not my son.

726
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:06,538
My son would be a slave.

727
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,462
His hands would be gnarled

728
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,794
and broken from the brick pits,

729
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:18,383
his back scarred
from the taskmaster's whip,

730
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:22,300
but in his heart would burn
the spirit of the living God.

731
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,560
Does this god demand
a scarred back and broken hands

732
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,266
as the price of his favor?

733
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:30,399
This desert god
is the hope of the hopeless.

734
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,855
Your place is in the palace halls.

735
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,771
You have mounted
to the sun on golden wings.

736
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:40,613
You belong to me, to Nefretiri,
to Sethi, to all those who love you.

737
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,494
Do they love less who have no hope?

738
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,916
Will you swear in the name of this god
that you are not my mother?

739
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,875
We do not even know his name.

740
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:03,765
Then look into my eyes
and tell me you are not my mother.

741
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:12,437
Oh, Moses, Moses! I cannot, I cannot.

742
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,037
I am your brother Aaron.

743
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:31,126
I am Miriam, your sister.

744
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:43,672
- I am your brother Moses.
- No! Get ready to leave. Hurry!

745
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,512
They're going away, Moses.
The secret's going with them.

746
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,714
No one need ever know
the shame I brought upon you.

747
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,057
Shame?

748
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,644
What change is there in me?

749
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,200
Egyptian or Hebrew, I am still Moses.

750
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:08,868
These are the same hands,
the same arms,

751
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,580
the same face
that were mine a moment ago.

752
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:17,999
A moment ago, you were her son,
the strength of Egypt.

753
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,634
Now, you are mine, a slave of Egypt.

754
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:25,047
You find no shame in this?

755
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:30,219
There is no shame in me. How can I
feel shame for the woman who bore me?

756
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:36,058
- Or the race that bred me?
- God of my fathers.

757
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:39,569
Moses, what will you do?

758
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,244
This is the binding tie...

759
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,539
...and here I will stay.

760
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,672
- Moses...
- To find the meaning of what I am.

761
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:06,013
Why a Hebrew, or any man,
must be a slave.

762
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,767
Put back your things.
You are not leaving.

763
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,339
Moses?

764
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:22,195
Has she done more for you than I?

765
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:28,618
Will the life she gave you be more
useful in the black pits of slavery?

766
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:35,709
Cannot justice and truth
be served better upon a throne

767
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:40,668
where all men may benefit
from your goodness

768
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,333
and strength?

769
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:53,514
I do not know
what power shapes my way,

770
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,306
but my feet are set upon a road
that I must follow.

771
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:02,902
Forgive me, Bithiah.

772
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,566
God of our fathers,

773
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:11,987
who has appointed
an end to the bondage of Israel,

774
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:17,205
blessed am I
among all mothers in the land,

775
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:22,749
for my eyes have beheld thy deliverer.

776
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:34,013
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
that treadeth out the com,

777
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,179
making straw for the bricks of Egypt,

778
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:42,192
nor spare the arms that endlessly
winnow the grain in the wind

779
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,479
to separate the wheat from the chaff

780
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:50,196
wheat borne stolidly
on the backs of countless slaves

781
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:54,704
from the heavy-laden Nile boats
to the teeming shore.

782
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:58,207
Endlessly they plod
beneath the sheaves of wheat

783
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,744
and endlessly return for more.

784
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,707
A golden harvest to the threshers,

785
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,967
a grain safe to feed the masters,

786
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:11,255
bitterness to feed the slaves,

787
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,391
and to feed the brick pits, straw,

788
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,177
carried on the bowed backs of women

789
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:21,849
down into the never-ending valley
of toil and agony,

790
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,518
stretching mile after mile.

791
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,984
An inferno of mud-soaked bodies,

792
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:31,992
where the treaders' feet
churn clay and straw

793
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,154
into the mixture
for the Pharaoh 's bricks.

794
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:39,416
And everywhere the lash
of watchful taskmasters

795
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,918
ready to sting the backs of the weary.

796
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,123
Blades chopping straw.

797
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,510
Mattocks chopping clay.

798
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:54,218
A ceaseless cycle of unending drudgery.

799
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,803
From the mixing feet of treaders

800
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,765
to the pouring hands of brick molders

801
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:03,056
moves the constant stream of mud,

802
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,442
the lowly seed of tall cities,

803
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:10,026
day after day, year after year;

804
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,940
century after century.

805
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,783
Bondage without rest,

806
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,286
toil without reward.

807
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,743
These are the children of misery,

808
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:23,786
the afflicted,
the hopeless, the oppressed.

809
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,380
And he went out unto his brethren

810
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,916
and looked on their burdens.

811
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,051
Water girl!

812
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,762
Here, here's water.

813
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,395
That's a hard dance you do, old man.

814
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,906
We've been dancing it for 400 years...

815
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,243
...to grim music.

816
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,622
And the only deliverer
that has come to us is death.

817
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,247
Back to work, you braying mules.

818
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,506
You're strange to the pits.

819
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,763
Your back is unscarred.

820
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,094
You bring a warm smile
with your cool water.

821
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,888
My smile is for a stonecutter.

822
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,183
- The water is for you.
- I thank you.

823
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,228
Your voice is not strange.

824
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,147
- You are...?
- One of many who thirst.

825
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,156
You there!

826
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,192
Come here.

827
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,154
That is Baka, the master builder.

828
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,542
- Does he call me or you?
- You! Water girl! I'm thirsty.

829
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,921
He does not thirst for water.

830
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,713
Beauty is but a curse to our women.

831
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:06,977
- Water, noble one?
- No, wine... the wine of beauty.

832
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,983
What beauty can my lord find
in these mud pits?

833
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:14,737
The lotus flower blooms
in the Nile's gray mud.

834
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:17,240
Dathan, she will do well
as a house slave.

835
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,072
Do not take me from my people!

836
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,072
There would be danger.

837
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,661
Danger from such lovely hands?

838
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,624
There are other hands,
strong enough to kill.

839
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,672
Our mud flower has a thorn.

840
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:37,085
Oh, please, Lord Baka, I beg you.

841
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,851
Tears..-

842
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:41,881
When you have been bathed
in scented water,

843
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:46,428
when your limbs have
been caressed by sweet oils

844
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:50,224
and your hair combed with sandalwood,

845
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,393
there will be no time for tears.

846
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,733
She is not worthy of your magnificence.
Let my eyes...

847
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:00,366
Your eyes had best find the deliverer,
Dathan, or you will have no eyes.

848
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,277
Bring the girl.

849
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,956
May the hand of God strike him.

850
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,965
Dance, you mud turtles, dance!

851
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:20,629
You rot our bodies,
steal hope from our souls.

852
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:24,220
Must you also
shame and defile our women?

853
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,680
Dance, you squealing goat!

854
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,442
We are not animals, we are men,

855
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,898
made in the image of God.

856
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,484
This will change your image.

857
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,325
Dance, you.

858
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,037
Get that straw cutter.

859
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,004
Leave him,
or you'll be murdered with him.

860
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,086
I'll not leave a man
to die in the mud.

861
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,940
Thank you, my son.

862
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,152
But death is better than bondage,

863
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:21,281
for my days are ended

864
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,693
and my prayer unanswered.

865
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,408
What prayer, old man?

866
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,870
That before death closed my eyes

867
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,876
I might behold the deliverer

868
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:38,916
who will lead all men to freedom.

869
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:43,173
What deliverer could
break the power of Pharaoh?

870
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:48,058
You, mud-carriers,
throw this carrion to the vultures.

871
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,889
You, take his place.

872
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,474
And dance the straw
into the mud, you dogs.

873
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:14,208
Clear a path there!
Clear a path!

874
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:18,588
Stand aside, you. Make way.

875
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,003
Clear a path.

876
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,339
Come on, get back. Out of the way!

877
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,049
Keep your eyes on the ground.

878
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:44,322
I need another oarsman
for my barge, a strong slave.

879
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,030
- Your word is our will, great lady.
- The large one there.

880
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:51,321
- You, come up here.
- No, not that one.

881
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,411
The very dirty one there.

882
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:59,670
Yes, that one.
He may serve my purpose.

883
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,829
You!

884
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,717
You! Out of the pit!

885
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:11,799
Out of the way!

886
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,434
Back to work!

887
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,469
Clear a path!

888
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,306
Stand aside, you.

889
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,101
Back to work!

890
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,815
Clear a path!

891
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,983
First friend of the Pharaoh,

892
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,778
keeper of the royal seal,

893
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,663
Prince of On, Prince of Memphis,

894
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,999
Prince of Thebes,

895
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,377
beloved of the Nile god,

896
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,004
conqueror of Ethiopia,

897
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,586
general of generals,

898
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:48,504
commander of the Egyptian Host...

899
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,047
...a man of mud!

900
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:56,602
Is that what you want? To be a slave?

901
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,982
Then why aren't you kneeling
at the feet of a princess?

902
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,815
I'm afraid the mud pits have
stiffened my knees, royal one.

903
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,530
Shall I call back the guards?

904
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:13,490
- Do you think they could bend them?
- Oh, Moses! Moses!

905
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:17,873
You stubborn, splendid, adorable fool.

906
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,465
I'm not kneeling to a princess.

907
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,719
No. You are kneeling to a woman

908
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:33,882
who's been worried about you
day and night since you disappeared.

909
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:36,551
What is there in the mud
of these slave pits

910
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:41,188
- that could keep you from my arms?
- My people.

911
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,692
They may be your people,
but do you have to wallow with them?

912
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,397
Smell like them?

913
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,905
If they are stained,
it's with the mud of slavery.

914
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:53,568
If they reek,
it's with the stench of injustice.

915
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,705
If you want to help your people,
come back to the palace.

916
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:03,085
And hide the truth from Sethi?
That I am Hebrew and a slave?

917
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:05,372
The truth would break his dear old heart

918
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:09,259
and send Bithiah into exile or death.

919
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,260
Think of us and stop hearing
the cries of your people.

920
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,593
Their god does not hear their cry.

921
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:19,886
Will Rameses hear it if he is Pharaoh?

922
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,647
No. He would grind them
into the clay they mold,

923
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,774
double their labors.

924
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:31,489
What about me?
Think of me as his wife.

925
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:36,786
Do you want to see me
in Rameses' arms?

926
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:40,574
- No.
- Then come back with me.

927
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:45,958
Oh, Moses! The gods have
fashioned you for greatness.

928
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,341
The splendor of your name
will last beyond the pyramids.

929
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,968
When you are Pharaoh,
you can free your people,

930
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:56,301
worship whatever gods you please,

931
01:17:56,463 --> 01:18:00,468
so long as I can worship you.

932
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:16,697
I will come to you at the palace
on the day of Sethi's jubilee.

933
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,953
Come with me now.

934
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,916
No, my love.

935
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:28,671
First I have a call to make
on the master builder.

936
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,815
No, no, no, no, no.

937
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,692
Not red with the sammur gown.

938
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,496
My eyes can best be used elsewhere,
Lord Baka.

939
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,453
Before you go,

940
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:08,119
let them look upon
what you thought unworthy.

941
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:12,006
You would let beauty
such as this go unseen?

942
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:16,044
You would let such a flower
go ungathered?

943
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,714
Dathan, you can see only mud,

944
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,680
so pick up her muddy clothes and go.

945
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,515
Go, all of you.

946
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,020
Did you know, my dear,
that this golden web

947
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,232
was spun from the beards of shellfish?

948
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:39,943
- Please let me go to my home.
- You are at home.

949
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:43,158
Here, taste this.

950
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,574
The blood of Thracian grapes,
the wine of love.

951
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,243
No wine can change my love.

952
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,957
Then your love shall be my wine.

953
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,718
There's fire in the chariot house!

954
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,341
The chariot house.

955
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:04,509
Guards! Guards!
You women take water to the roof.

956
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:07,770
Dathan, take charge. Guards, after him.

957
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:10,981
Pull it out of the shed.

958
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,767
Take it clear of the house.

959
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:20,074
No, no, your wings
must not be singed, my dove,

960
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,610
at least not by that fire.

961
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:26,197
- Joshua!
- Run, Lilia, run! The way is clear.

962
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,741
The master builder will not follow.

963
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:32,119
Neither will you, stonecutter.

964
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,016
Bind him between the columns.

965
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,650
See that his arms
are tightly stretched.

966
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:58,358
You will die on your feet, stonecutter.

967
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:08,534
He'll cut him to pieces.

968
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,534
Now, go after the girl!

969
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,794
- Don't come back without her.
- We'll find her.

970
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:21,502
You foolish, stupid man!

971
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,349
I would have kept her
only a short while.

972
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:30,512
She would have returned to you,
shall we say, more worthy.

973
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:34,436
Now, to whom shall I return Lilia?

974
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,351
You will not be there, Joshua.

975
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:40,688
You've seen me drive my chariot.

976
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,442
I can flick a fly from my horse's ear

977
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,782
without breaking
the rhythm of his stride.

978
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,573
You've seen me use my whip.

979
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,750
You make no outcry, Joshua.

980
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,085
But you will.

981
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,377
You will cry for the mercy of death.

982
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:07,886
One day you will listen
to the cry of slaves.

983
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,471
This is not that day, Joshua.

984
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:22,397
You hold your tongue almost
as well as I hold my temper.

985
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:26,238
It's a pity to kill
so strong a stonecutter.

986
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:31,364
- Death will bring death, Baka.
- Who are you?

987
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,500
One who asks
what right you have to kill a slave.

988
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,286
The right of a master to kill you
or any slave.

989
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:42,959
- Then kill me, master butcher!
- Moses!

990
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,023
Why have you done this?

991
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:04,780
- Where is the girl, Lilia?
- Gone.

992
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,658
Why are you dressed as a slave?

993
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,779
Why does a prince of Egypt kill
the Pharaoh's master builder

994
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,447
to save a Hebrew?

995
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,039
I am Hebrew.

996
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,168
God of Abraham.

997
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,302
Four hundred years we've waited.

998
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:30,180
The Pharaoh's soldiers
won't wait so long.

999
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:33,513
The Almighty has heard our cries
from bondage.

1000
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,478
You are the chosen one.

1001
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:41,066
- I know nothing of your god.
- He knows you, Moses.

1002
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:45,856
He has brought you to us.
You cannot turn your back upon us.

1003
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:50,948
You will deliver us. The finger
of God points the way to you.

1004
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,665
- Where was his body found?
- Buried in the sand, royal one.

1005
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:05,003
This is Bakas knife.

1006
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,293
But there was no wound on the body.

1007
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:13,174
Baka was a powerful man. It would
take strong hands to break him.

1008
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,968
The slave, Joshua, is a stonecutter.

1009
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,347
Go find me this Joshua.

1010
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:25,611
Joshua's strength didn't kill
the master builder.

1011
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:29,524
Now speaks the rat
that would be my ears.

1012
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,159
Too many ears tie a rat's tongue.

1013
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:38,040
Go. All of you.

1014
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:45,335
Well? Who killed him?

1015
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,046
I am poor man, generous one.

1016
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,381
What I bring is worth much.

1017
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:53,388
I have paid you much
and you have brought me nothing.

1018
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:58,474
Now I bring you the world...
true son of Pharaoh.

1019
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:03,232
You offer me the world when you
cannot even bring me the deliverer.

1020
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,024
Who killed Baka?

1021
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:12,066
- The deliverer.
- Would you play at words with me?

1022
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,735
No, lord prince.

1023
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:18,326
This murderer has now fled
to some distant land?

1024
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:21,082
No, lord prince.

1025
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,041
Name him!

1026
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,167
One who made himself
a prince and judge over us.

1027
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:29,925
If he knew I were here, he would
kill me as he killed the Egyptian.

1028
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,088
I will hang you myself
if you tire me further.

1029
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:40,761
There are those who would pay much

1030
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,895
for what my eyes have seen.

1031
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:46,605
You haggle with me like a seller
of melons in the marketplace?

1032
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:51,648
No, I will not haggle, great prince.
Here's your money.

1033
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:57,616
But for ten talents of fine gold,

1034
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,827
I'll give you the wealth of Egypt.

1035
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:04,163
Give me my freedom
and I'll give you the scepter.

1036
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:05,794
Give me the water girl, Lilia,

1037
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,296
and I'll give you the princess
of your heart's desire.

1038
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:12,676
Give me this house of Baka,
and I'll give you the throne.

1039
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,971
Give me all that I ask...

1040
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,633
...or give me leave to go.

1041
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,849
I will give you more than leave to go.

1042
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,309
I will send you where you belong.

1043
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:30,152
I belong in your service, glorious one.

1044
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,147
Very well.

1045
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,617
I will bargain with you.

1046
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:42,615
If what you say pleases me,
I will give you your price, all of it.

1047
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,700
If not, I will give you the point of
this blade through your lying throat.

1048
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,168
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

1049
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,629
The deliverer...

1050
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,260
...is Moses.

1051
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:02,810
Draw one more breath to tell me
why Moses or any other Egyptian

1052
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,471
would deliver the Hebrews.

1053
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,641
Moses is not Egyptian.

1054
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,024
He's Hebrew.

1055
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:13,153
The son of slaves.

1056
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,455
I will pay your price.

1057
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,214
Imagine poor Nefretiri,

1058
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,216
not knowing in which bed
she will sleep.

1059
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,595
- I'd be happy in either.
- But where is Prince Moses?

1060
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,631
No Moses, no jubilee.

1061
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:00,985
I am told, my tiger lily,
they're wagering against me.

1062
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,153
Two golden debens to one.

1063
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,656
Yes. I wagered five myself!

1064
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,872
You'll lose your debens if Moses
keeps me waiting any longer.

1065
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:14,461
I double the wager. I'll watch
for Moses, you watch the dance!

1066
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,617
While you wait to honor Moses,

1067
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:45,495
I will honor Sethi's jubilee...

1068
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,120
...with a gift.

1069
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,369
Strange gift.

1070
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:57,792
You said if the deliverer were a myth,

1071
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:02,259
- to bring him in a bottle.
- The bottle is empty.

1072
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:06,099
Yes. It is empty
because he is not a myth.

1073
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:09,888
- You have found such a man?
- Yes, my father.

1074
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:13,523
I have found him in the midst
of treachery and treason,

1075
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:16,811
with the blood of your
master builder red upon his hands.

1076
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:20,488
Shall I summon him
to Pharaoh's justice?

1077
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:22,194
Summon him!

1078
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:32,371
- Bring the Hebrew in.
- Bring the Hebrew in.

1079
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,532
Moses.

1080
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,874
Great Pharaoh...

1081
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,830
...I stand in the shadow
of your justice.

1082
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:21,374
Whose work is this?

1083
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,010
I warned you of his treason, my father.

1084
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:29,050
- Treason?
- Judge now if I spoke truly.

1085
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:33,562
The evil star foretold him
as the destroyer of Egypt

1086
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,722
and deliverer of slaves.

1087
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:40,565
It is not possible. A prince of Egypt?

1088
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,480
He is not a prince of Egypt.

1089
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:46,901
He is not the son of your sister.

1090
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:50,571
He is the son of Hebrew slaves.

1091
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:58,108
Speak... my son.

1092
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:06,511
I am the son of Amram and Yochabel.

1093
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,388
Hebrew slaves.

1094
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:21,981
My brother, it was I
who deceived you, not Moses.

1095
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,818
- He was only a child.
- Leave me.

1096
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,404
I shall not see your face again.

1097
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:44,178
Moses, come to me.

1098
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:57,721
I do not care who you are or what you
are or what they may say about you,

1099
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:02,358
but I want to hear from your own lips

1100
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,145
that you are not a traitor,

1101
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:09,361
that you would not lead these people
in revolt against me.

1102
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:13,946
Tell me, Moses. I will believe you.

1103
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:21,169
I am not this deliverer you fear.

1104
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:26,174
It would take more than a man
to lead the slaves from bondage.

1105
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,551
It would take a god.

1106
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,839
But if I could free them,

1107
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,606
I would.

1108
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:40,355
What has turned you against me?

1109
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:44,522
From the time my sister brought you
to the court, I loved you,

1110
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:47,654
reared you, set you before my own son,

1111
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:50,691
because I saw in you

1112
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:53,906
a worth and a greatness

1113
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:55,537
above other men.

1114
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:59,040
No son could have
more love for you than I.

1115
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,874
Then why are you forcing me
to destroy you?

1116
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,589
What evil has done this to you?

1117
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:12,387
The evil that men should turn their
brothers into beasts of burden,

1118
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:17,684
to slave and suffer in dumb anguish,

1119
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:22,268
to be stripped of spirit
and hope and faith,

1120
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:25,604
only because they're
of another race,

1121
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,395
another creed.

1122
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,689
If there is a God,

1123
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,734
he did not mean this to be so.

1124
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:42,917
What I have done,
I was compelled to do.

1125
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,961
So be it.

1126
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:53,420
What I do now,

1127
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:56,089
I am compelled to do.

1128
01:33:57,924 --> 01:33:59,324
No! No!

1129
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,658
Rameses,

1130
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,942
Egypt shall be yours.

1131
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,995
Hear what I say, Rameses.

1132
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:26,629
When I cross the river of death,
you will be Pharaoh in Egypt.

1133
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:31,709
Harden yourself against subordinates.

1134
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,215
Put no faith in a brother.

1135
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,552
Have no friend.

1136
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:41,968
Trust no woman.

1137
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,314
I protected the helpless,

1138
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:52,945
I nourished the orphan.

1139
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,104
Great one!

1140
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:03,031
He who ate my bread
and called me father

1141
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:07,168
would make rebellion against me.

1142
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:11,127
What manner of death
do you decree for him?

1143
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,928
I cannot speak it.

1144
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:21,007
Let it be as you will.

1145
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:26,938
I will not live if you must die!

1146
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:35,355
The feet of a Hebrew slave
is not the right place

1147
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:37,364
for the next queen of Egypt.

1148
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,118
Take him away.

1149
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,794
- Do not look upon him.
- Traitor to Pharaoh.

1150
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:04,388
Let the name of Moses

1151
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:08,100
be stricken
from every book and tablet.

1152
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:15,900
Stricken from all pylons and obelisks.

1153
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:19,908
Stricken from every monument of Egypt.

1154
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:28,412
Let the name of... Moses...

1155
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:33,922
...be unheard and unspoken,

1156
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,378
erased from the memory of men

1157
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,424
for all time.

1158
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:58,612
No, Moses.

1159
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:02,279
It is I who will possess all of her.

1160
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:08,247
You think when you are in my arms it
will be his face you will see, not mine?

1161
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:12,127
Yes. Only his face.

1162
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:14,504
I defeated you in life.

1163
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,960
You shall not defeat me by your death.

1164
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:22,004
The dead are not scorched
in the desert of desire.

1165
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:25,470
They do not suffer
from the thirst of passion

1166
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:29,386
or stagger blindly towards
some mirage of lost love.

1167
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:34,808
But you, Hebrew,
will suffer all these things...

1168
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:38,816
- ...by living.
- You will let him live!

1169
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,401
I will not make him a martyr
for you to cherish.

1170
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:45,319
No phantom will come between
you and me in the night.

1171
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:51,075
Yes, my sweet. I will let him live.

1172
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,640
Dead...

1173
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:56,003
...you alone would possess him.

1174
01:37:57,288 --> 01:38:00,508
From where I send him
there is no returning.

1175
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:04,845
And you will never know

1176
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:09,384
if he has found forgetfulness
within another woman's arms.

1177
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,354
Now, look upon each other
for the last time.

1178
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:58,441
Now, look for the first time,
Abiram, upon the governor of Goshen.

1179
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:04,482
Dathan, my brother,
you have the favor of the Lord.

1180
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,610
I prefer the gratitude of the prince.

1181
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:27,694
Nearer.

1182
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:33,597
Yes. Very lovely.

1183
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,558
Not that purplish flower.

1184
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,392
The purity of white

1185
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:43,937
will cool the blush of your cheek.

1186
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:52,237
Leave us. All of you.
Yes, you, too, my brother.

1187
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:56,124
Continue your playing,
but in the house.

1188
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:00,878
Yes. That's better.

1189
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:07,968
A flower behind a flower.

1190
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:13,349
Dathan, if you fear God, let me go.

1191
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:16,227
I'm here, girl, because I put no trust

1192
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:20,106
in a desert god
and his mud-pit prophet.

1193
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:23,359
I prospered because I bowed lower than
my brothers before the Egyptians.

1194
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:26,488
Now, the Egyptians bow low before me.

1195
01:40:28,314 --> 01:40:30,237
Joshua wanted you.

1196
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,200
Baka wanted you.

1197
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:38,700
But you belong to me.

1198
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:41,790
A gift from Rameses to His Excellency.

1199
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:50,882
I will bow before you, Dathan.

1200
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,015
I will work my hands raw for you.

1201
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:57,852
But please...

1202
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,731
Please do not shame me
before my Lord.

1203
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:04,392
Your Lord is the governor of Goshen.

1204
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:07,403
What difference to my shame?

1205
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:11,032
No difference to you,
my dove of Canaan.

1206
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:15,696
But to a condemned slave like Joshua,

1207
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:19,491
it could make the difference
between death on the spikes

1208
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:24,254
and life in the copper mines of Sinai.

1209
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:30,218
What would you do to influence
His Excellency's clemency?

1210
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,974
Anything, Dathan.

1211
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,851
Anything.

1212
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:46,105
Joshua will always
be grateful to you,

1213
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:48,895
my little mud flower.

1214
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:55,485
His fate is better
than the one that waits for Moses.

1215
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:10,083
The slave who would be king.

1216
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:14,296
Captain. Robe of state.

1217
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:18,933
His Hebrew mother brought it
to the prison before she died.

1218
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,775
I'd rather this for your armor.

1219
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:29,935
You will have need of a scepter.

1220
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:34,398
Give me this binding pole.

1221
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:42,665
Here is your king's scepter

1222
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:45,451
and here is your kingdom,

1223
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:50,419
with the scorpion, the cobra
and the lizard for subjects.

1224
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:54,802
Free them, if you will.
Leave the Hebrews to me.

1225
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:59,800
Give this prince of Israel
one day's ration of bread and water.

1226
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:01,342
One day's ration?

1227
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:05,980
It will take many days to cross this
wilderness, if he can cross at all.

1228
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:17,405
I commend you to your Hebrew god
who has no name.

1229
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:22,697
If you die, it will be
by his hand, not by mine.

1230
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:56,526
Farewell, my one-time brother.

1231
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:13,839
Into the blistering wilderness of Shun

1232
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:18,674
the man who walked with kings
now walks alone.

1233
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:22,636
Torn from the pinnacle of royal power;

1234
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:26,052
stripped of all rank and earthly wealth,

1235
01:44:26,218 --> 01:44:29,392
a forsaken man without a country,

1236
01:44:29,555 --> 01:44:31,398
without a hope.

1237
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:37,235
His soul in turmoil,
like the hot winds and raging sands

1238
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:40,866
that lash him with the fury
of a taskmaster's whip.

1239
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:46,539
He is driven forward, always forward,

1240
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:48,791
by a god unknown

1241
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:51,577
toward a land unseen.

1242
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:57,425
Into the molten wilderness of sin,

1243
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:01,929
where granite sentinels
stand as towers of living death

1244
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:04,385
to bar his way.

1245
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:09,600
Each night brings
the black embrace of loneliness.

1246
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:11,981
In the mocking whisper of the wind

1247
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:15,109
he hears the echoing voices of the dark.

1248
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:16,551
Moses!

1249
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:20,276
- Moses!
- Moses!

1250
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:33,244
His tortured mind

1251
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:37,540
wondering if they call
the memory of past triumphs

1252
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:41,961
or wail foreboding
of disasters yet to come

1253
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:44,755
or whether the desert's hot breath

1254
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:49,018
has melted his reason into madness.

1255
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:54,808
He cannot cool the burning kiss
of thirst upon his lips,

1256
01:45:56,308 --> 01:45:59,312
nor shade the scorching fury of the sun.

1257
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:05,284
All about is desolation.

1258
01:46:05,442 --> 01:46:09,663
He can neither bless nor curse
the power that moves him,

1259
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:13,910
for he does not know
from where it comes.

1260
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:22,176
Learning that it can be more
terrible to live than to die,

1261
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:27,135
he is driven onward through
the burning crucible of desert,

1262
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:32,304
where holy men and prophets
are cleansed and purged

1263
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:35,222
for God's great purpose.

1264
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:40,937
Until, at last,
at the end of human strength,

1265
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:44,903
beaten into the dust
from which he came,

1266
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:49,366
the metal is ready
for the Maker's hand.

1267
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:14,350
And he found strength
from a fruit-laden palm tree

1268
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:19,563
and life-giving water;
flowing from the well of Midian.

1269
01:47:32,655 --> 01:47:35,659
- If only sheep were men!
- Unmarried men!

1270
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:38,873
- Can you think of nothing else?
- I don't know. I've never tried!

1271
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:41,038
I wish sheep
could learn to water themselves.

1272
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:43,048
You needn't have painted
your nails, Lulua.

1273
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:44,880
There isn't a man
from here to Horeb.

1274
01:47:57,054 --> 01:48:00,103
- What do you see, Sephora?
- What are you looking at?

1275
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,523
- A man.
- What?

1276
01:48:03,686 --> 01:48:04,886
A man?

1277
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:06,780
What kind of a man?

1278
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:09,283
- A young man?
- Only one?

1279
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:10,784
Is he handsome?

1280
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:12,786
- Look at his sandals!
- Egyptian!

1281
01:48:12,945 --> 01:48:16,074
- His robe is not Egyptian.
- Who cares? He's a man.

1282
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,240
Yes!

1283
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:21,913
- He's eaten a whole bunch of dates!
- Could he be dangerous?

1284
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,252
- Are you sure he's alive?
- I hope so!

1285
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:27,715
- Do you think he's married?
- Look. There's real trouble.

1286
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:35,346
- Amalekites.
- Amalekites!

1287
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:42,190
- I'll talk to them.
- Talk to them? Get stones!

1288
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:44,397
- They'll scatter the flock!
- Desert thieves!

1289
01:48:48,605 --> 01:48:52,485
- We drew this water!
- Out of the way, girl!

1290
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:56,823
This is the well of Jethro, our father.
You have no right here!

1291
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:59,412
Our goats don't know your father!

1292
01:48:59,575 --> 01:49:02,499
- Jethro's mark is on the well.
- They can't read either.

1293
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:04,379
Nor can we!

1294
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:08,042
- He's the Sheik of Midian!
- Then let him breed sons

1295
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,961
- to guard it, not daughters.
- Get your hands off her!

1296
01:49:12,504 --> 01:49:13,847
Drive them away!

1297
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:28,361
Let them be first
whose hands have drawn the water.

1298
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:32,696
The stranger is wise, and strong.

1299
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:36,158
Drive back your goats
until the sheep are watered.

1300
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,743
All right, all right.

1301
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:57,846
We should draw water for you
and wash the desert dust from your feet.

1302
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:00,720
- Of course we should!
- Here's fresh water.

1303
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:05,016
- I have soap weed.
- Let me first remove his sandals!

1304
01:50:05,641 --> 01:50:08,941
Never did a lost sheep
have so many shepherds.

1305
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:11,231
- We have no towel.
- My veil will serve.

1306
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:13,865
- But I...
- Here, let me pour the water!

1307
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:19,367
- Am I to be bathed or drowned?
- I'll hold it for you.

1308
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:22,374
Is it true that Egyptian girls
paint their eyes?

1309
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:26,879
Yes. But very few have eyes
as beautiful as yours.

1310
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:31,754
And who...?

1311
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:35,171
Who is the brave one who
stood against the Amalekites?

1312
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:39,183
That's Sephora. She's the oldest.

1313
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:42,720
Since you have already
divided the stranger among you,

1314
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:46,356
I will ask a welcome for him
in our father's tent.

1315
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:49,439
- Our father is Jethro.
- He's Sheik of Midian.

1316
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:16,879
Strength to you, stranger.

1317
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:21,801
I am Moses,
son of Amram and Yochabel.

1318
01:51:21,967 --> 01:51:26,097
Health, prosperity, life to you,
Jethro of Midian.

1319
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:33,445
Sephora has told me of your kindness.

1320
01:51:33,604 --> 01:51:36,403
Let us break bread
while my daughter brings meat.

1321
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:41,825
You have come far.

1322
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:45,661
From Egypt.

1323
01:51:45,824 --> 01:51:48,498
Across the desert? On foot?

1324
01:51:49,411 --> 01:51:52,836
He who has no name
surely guided your steps.

1325
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:58,341
No name? You Bedouins
know the god of Abraham?

1326
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:01,382
Abraham is the father of many nations.

1327
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:04,518
We are the children of Ishmael,
his first-born.

1328
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:06,974
We are the obedient of God.

1329
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,600
My people look to him for deliverance.

1330
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:16,530
But they are still in bondage.

1331
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:23,370
Tomorrow we leave for the high pastures
beneath God's holy mountain.

1332
01:52:23,528 --> 01:52:26,247
My tent would be favored
if you joined us.

1333
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:31,587
I am a stranger in a strange land.

1334
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:35,670
I have no wealth,
no skill as a shepherd.

1335
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:41,381
And it is death to give
sanctuary to a runaway slave.

1336
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,514
- Slave?
- Death?

1337
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:47,053
Not among our people.
You have wisdom.

1338
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:49,267
You need nothing more.

1339
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:52,558
And there are seven here to teach you
the tasks of a shepherd.

1340
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:56,816
Sephora is the eldest.

1341
01:52:56,979 --> 01:52:59,232
You can learn best from her.

1342
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:06,746
I will dwell in this land.

1343
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:30,767
- Today he sleeps.
- Who sleeps?

1344
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:33,599
He who has no name.

1345
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:38,813
Does your God live on this mountain?

1346
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:42,449
Sinai is his high place. His temple.

1347
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:46,654
If this god is God,

1348
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:50,495
he would live on every mountain,
in every valley.

1349
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:56,292
He would not be only the god
of Israel or of Ishmael alone,

1350
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:58,173
but of all men.

1351
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:02,177
It is said he created all men
in his image.

1352
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:07,391
And he would dwell in every heart,
in every mind...

1353
01:54:08,633 --> 01:54:10,635
...in every soul.

1354
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:17,476
I do not know about such things.

1355
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:23,323
But I do know that the mountain
rumbles when God is there.

1356
01:54:23,482 --> 01:54:25,951
And the earth trembles

1357
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:29,409
and the cloud is red with fire.

1358
01:54:29,571 --> 01:54:31,994
At such a time,

1359
01:54:32,157 --> 01:54:35,536
has any man ever gone
to see him face to face?

1360
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:39,798
No man has ever set foot
on the forbidden slopes of Sinai.

1361
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:42,964
Why do you want to see him, Moses?

1362
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:45,678
To know that he is.

1363
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:49,512
And if he is, to know why
he has not heard the cries

1364
01:54:49,674 --> 01:54:51,972
of slaves in bondage.

1365
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:56,390
Moses, it would be death
to look upon his face.

1366
01:54:57,682 --> 01:55:02,188
How many of my people have died
because he's turned away his face?

1367
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:06,241
Can a man judge God?

1368
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:11,406
No, Moses.
We cannot see his whole purpose.

1369
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:16,543
Even Ishmael did not know that God
drove him into the desert

1370
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,999
to be the father of a nation.

1371
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:24,384
Is it not enough to know that he has
saved you from the Pharaoh's anger?

1372
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:28,801
How do you know that?

1373
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:34,766
You walk like a prince.
And you tight like a warrior.

1374
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:38,561
There is word in the caravans
of a great one

1375
01:55:38,723 --> 01:55:40,817
who was driven out of Egypt.

1376
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:46,732
This is not the scepter of a prince,

1377
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:49,401
but the staff of a wanderer.

1378
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:52,700
Then rest from wandering.

1379
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:56,450
My father has many flocks,

1380
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:58,618
and no son to tend them.

1381
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:02,998
There would be peace of spirit
for you, Moses,

1382
01:56:03,165 --> 01:56:07,466
in our tents beneath the holy mountain.

1383
01:56:08,587 --> 01:56:11,557
You have strong faith in this God,
Sephora.

1384
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:16,804
But, for me,
there is no peace of spirit

1385
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:20,565
until I hear the word of God,

1386
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,943
from God himself.

1387
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:33,738
You haven't much time!

1388
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:38,579
I wish every day
was a shearing festival!

1389
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:42,747
I know. And all the men following you
like sheep to be sheared!

1390
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:46,417
- One would be enough for me!
- If he were Moses!

1391
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:51,471
Never before, my brothers,
has our wool brought so rich a payment.

1392
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:54,133
Because Moses
has sold the whole shearing

1393
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:57,849
of all the tribes in one piece,
at one price, to Lugal here.

1394
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,730
His words are truth.
His trading is just.

1395
01:57:00,889 --> 01:57:03,517
Peace be with you, sheiks of Sinai.

1396
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:06,527
Why are you dressed like that?

1397
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:08,859
Aren't you going to dance with us
before the sheiks?

1398
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:13,994
No, I am not going to dance
before the sheiks. Here.

1399
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:19,203
And I am not going to be displayed
like a caravan's wares

1400
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:22,620
before Moses or any other man.

1401
01:57:23,495 --> 01:57:25,418
Tonight I tend the sheep.

1402
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:30,586
You needn't laugh.
Moses may not choose you either!

1403
01:57:33,922 --> 01:57:36,425
Moses shall no longer
be a stranger among us.

1404
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:39,344
- We should give him of our flocks.
- And let him choose.

1405
01:57:39,511 --> 01:57:42,640
I shall give him choice
of my seven daughters for wife.

1406
01:57:42,806 --> 01:57:43,853
Seven to choose from.

1407
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:45,483
- A strong son.
- A happy union.

1408
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:49,730
The shadow of my wisdom has fled.

1409
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:53,366
Can a man choose
from among the stars of the sky?

1410
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:55,869
Consider them as they dance.

1411
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:58,200
Cohath, strike your bow.

1412
01:58:19,843 --> 01:58:23,097
- A pleasant task.
- Indeed!

1413
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:29,486
A bride, a shawl.
Choose one, not all.

1414
01:58:29,644 --> 01:58:33,740
One shawl, one wife.
Your choice for life.

1415
01:58:46,494 --> 01:58:48,496
Pearls of great price.

1416
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,735
- Which, Moses?
- Which will it be?

1417
01:59:10,894 --> 01:59:12,771
Make your choice, Moses.

1418
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:15,690
It is a garden of many flowers, Moses.

1419
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:20,112
I wish you had my years
and I had your choice.

1420
01:59:21,237 --> 01:59:26,334
In the tent of Jethro
there is dignity, honor, freedom

1421
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:28,787
and beauty.

1422
01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:31,631
All that a man could ask of life.

1423
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:34,634
But my heart is still
a prisoner of the past.

1424
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:38,388
I... I cannot choose now.

1425
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:45,475
- Strength to you, sheiks of Sinai.
- May God guide your heart.

1426
01:59:45,637 --> 01:59:46,837
Moses!

1427
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:58,818
Tonight he is awake.

1428
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:05,077
Which of my sisters did you choose?

1429
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:10,958
I made no choice, Sephora.

1430
02:00:17,502 --> 02:00:20,346
She was very beautiful, wasn't she?

1431
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:25,181
This woman of Egypt
who left her scar upon your heart.

1432
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,976
Her skin was white as curd.

1433
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:37,151
Her eyes,
green as the cedars of Lebanon.

1434
02:00:38,189 --> 02:00:41,409
Her lips, tamarisk honey.

1435
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:44,868
Like the breast of a dove,
her arms were soft.

1436
02:00:47,615 --> 02:00:50,744
And the wine of desire
was in her veins.

1437
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:55,381
Yes. She was beautiful...

1438
02:00:57,125 --> 02:00:58,923
...as a jewel.

1439
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:04,766
A jewel has brilliant fire,
but gives no warmth.

1440
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:13,150
Our hands are not so soft,
but they can serve.

1441
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:18,155
Our bodies not so white,
but they are strong.

1442
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,449
Our lips are not perfumed...

1443
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:25,741
...but they speak the truth.

1444
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:29,328
Love is not an art to us.

1445
02:01:30,366 --> 02:01:32,585
It's life to us.

1446
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:38,800
We are not dressed
in gold and fine linen.

1447
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:42,796
Strength and honor are our clothing.

1448
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:48,844
Our tents are not
the columned halls of Egypt,

1449
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:51,980
but our children
play happily before them.

1450
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:57,569
We can offer you little...

1451
02:01:59,896 --> 02:02:02,900
...but we offer all we have.

1452
02:02:03,066 --> 02:02:07,663
I have not little, Sephora.
I have nothing.

1453
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:10,370
Nothing from some

1454
02:02:10,532 --> 02:02:13,126
is more than gold from others.

1455
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:18,756
You would fill
the emptiness of my heart?

1456
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:24,796
I could never fill all of it, Moses.

1457
02:02:26,297 --> 02:02:29,346
But I shall not be jealous of a memory.

1458
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:16,811
May the gods bless you

1459
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:19,692
as you go to join them

1460
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:22,695
in the land of the dead.

1461
02:03:23,897 --> 02:03:25,899
The old windbag.

1462
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:30,657
What an infernal fuss.

1463
02:03:32,196 --> 02:03:35,871
After all,
dying is only a part of living.

1464
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:38,662
You won't die, old crocodile.

1465
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:42,753
You'll cheat death the way
you cheat me at hounds and jackals.

1466
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:47,387
I'm afraid he won't let me cheat
the way you do.

1467
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:55,220
You'll be Pharaoh by sunset, Rameses.

1468
02:03:57,472 --> 02:04:02,444
I hope you're content... at last.

1469
02:04:02,602 --> 02:04:05,276
I am content to be your son.

1470
02:04:06,522 --> 02:04:09,401
You have restored Egypt
to her greatness.

1471
02:04:10,318 --> 02:04:14,744
I shall make her greatness
feared among nations.

1472
02:04:14,906 --> 02:04:18,786
No doubt, no doubt.
You can overcome anything,

1473
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:21,751
but your own arrogance.

1474
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:24,882
Don't exhaust yourself, great one.

1475
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:30,635
- Dear great one.
- Why not, kitten?

1476
02:04:30,797 --> 02:04:33,926
You are the only thing I regret leaving.

1477
02:04:34,926 --> 02:04:37,099
You have been my joy.

1478
02:04:38,096 --> 02:04:42,146
- And you, my only love.
- Uh-huh.

1479
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,737
Now you're cheating.

1480
02:04:47,271 --> 02:04:50,491
- There was another.
- Yes.

1481
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:55,595
I know.

1482
02:04:57,573 --> 02:04:59,701
I loved him, too.

1483
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:05,587
With my last breath,
I'll break my own law

1484
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:08,126
and speak the name of...

1485
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:11,677
...Moses.

1486
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:15,165
Moses.

1487
02:05:26,644 --> 02:05:28,817
The royal falcon

1488
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,358
has flown into the sun.

1489
02:05:55,339 --> 02:05:58,809
Did the little boy die in the desert,
my father?

1490
02:05:58,968 --> 02:06:03,314
No. God brought Ishmael and
his mother, Hagar, into a good land.

1491
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:06,818
The same God who lives
on the mountain?

1492
02:06:07,769 --> 02:06:12,866
- It may be, my son.
- Moses! Moses!

1493
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:15,197
Your mother is calling.

1494
02:06:17,487 --> 02:06:18,487
Here!

1495
02:06:21,532 --> 02:06:25,287
Moses! There is a man among the sheep!

1496
02:06:25,453 --> 02:06:26,955
You stay...

1497
02:06:28,998 --> 02:06:33,469
You keep sounding the alarm, Gershom.
But stay here till your mother comes.

1498
02:06:38,883 --> 02:06:40,931
In the cleft, behind the rock.

1499
02:06:41,094 --> 02:06:43,563
Your eyes are sharp
as they are beautiful.

1500
02:07:00,196 --> 02:07:01,396
Turfa!

1501
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:04,742
Khataf! Back!

1502
02:07:05,785 --> 02:07:07,378
Khataf! Back!

1503
02:07:10,331 --> 02:07:13,084
Back, Khataf. Come down!

1504
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,160
Moses.

1505
02:07:18,256 --> 02:07:19,758
Down, Turfa!

1506
02:07:24,011 --> 02:07:26,810
Praise God I have found you!

1507
02:07:27,723 --> 02:07:29,123
Joshua?

1508
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:31,941
We thought you dead.

1509
02:07:32,103 --> 02:07:36,233
In the copper mines of Geber,
the living are dead.

1510
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:39,653
Sephora! Bring water.

1511
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:47,456
How did you find me?

1512
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:49,541
A merchant buying copper

1513
02:07:49,704 --> 02:07:52,127
saw you in the tent of Jethro.

1514
02:07:54,792 --> 02:07:57,545
Here, you too will find peace.

1515
02:07:58,838 --> 02:08:00,038
Peace?

1516
02:08:01,966 --> 02:08:04,765
How can you find peace or want it,

1517
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:08,352
when Rameses builds cities mortared
with the blood of our people?

1518
02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:11,313
You must lead them out of Egypt!

1519
02:08:11,475 --> 02:08:15,400
God made a covenant with Abraham
that he would deliver the people.

1520
02:08:16,606 --> 02:08:18,825
Am I the hand of God?

1521
02:08:19,567 --> 02:08:23,037
- Sephora, give him water.
- Water! Bless you!

1522
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:25,995
The desert sun has set fire to his mind.

1523
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,498
His name is Joshua.

1524
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:32,504
I once killed that he might live.

1525
02:08:33,748 --> 02:08:36,092
They told me you were condemned,

1526
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:40,676
but I knew you were chosen to take
the sword of God into your hand!

1527
02:08:40,838 --> 02:08:43,011
I am not the man.

1528
02:08:44,675 --> 02:08:47,269
I am a shepherd with flocks...

1529
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:51,683
That light on the mountainside...

1530
02:08:53,184 --> 02:08:56,108
Do you see that strange tire?

1531
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:59,365
- A bush that burns?
- No.

1532
02:08:59,523 --> 02:09:02,743
It is on fire,
but the bush does not burn.

1533
02:09:02,902 --> 02:09:07,203
Sephora, take him.
Serve him food in our tent.

1534
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:10,835
I will turn aside
and see this great sight.

1535
02:10:35,828 --> 02:10:37,028
Moses.

1536
02:10:40,916 --> 02:10:42,116
Moses.

1537
02:10:47,006 --> 02:10:48,474
I am here.

1538
02:10:49,425 --> 02:10:53,475
Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.

1539
02:10:53,929 --> 02:10:58,901
For the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground.

1540
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,910
I am the God of thy father.

1541
02:11:09,612 --> 02:11:12,206
The God of Abraham,

1542
02:11:12,365 --> 02:11:14,242
the God of Isaac

1543
02:11:14,408 --> 02:11:16,831
and the God of Jacob.

1544
02:11:18,913 --> 02:11:20,313
Lord...

1545
02:11:22,416 --> 02:11:25,636
Lord, why do you not hear the cries

1546
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:29,299
of their children
in the bondage of Egypt?

1547
02:11:29,465 --> 02:11:34,517
I have surely seen the affliction
of my people which are in Egypt.

1548
02:11:36,013 --> 02:11:41,520
And I have heard their cry
by reason of their taskmasters.

1549
02:11:42,436 --> 02:11:45,280
For I know their sorrows.

1550
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:49,444
Therefore, I will send thee, Moses,

1551
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:52,159
unto Pharaoh,

1552
02:11:52,321 --> 02:11:57,043
that thou mayest bring my people
out of Egypt.

1553
02:11:57,201 --> 02:12:02,048
Who am I, Lord,
that you should send me?

1554
02:12:04,041 --> 02:12:07,386
How can I lead this people
out of bondage?

1555
02:12:09,004 --> 02:12:12,725
What words can I speak
that they will heed?

1556
02:12:12,883 --> 02:12:18,105
I will teach thee what thou wilt say.

1557
02:12:18,264 --> 02:12:21,484
When thou hast brought forth
the people,

1558
02:12:21,642 --> 02:12:25,397
they shall serve me upon this mountain.

1559
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:30,694
I will put my laws into their hearts.

1560
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:34,490
And in their minds will I write them.

1561
02:12:35,531 --> 02:12:38,375
Now, therefore, go.

1562
02:12:39,076 --> 02:12:41,875
And I will be with thee.

1563
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:44,923
But if I say to your children

1564
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:48,586
that the God of their fathers
has sent me,

1565
02:12:48,752 --> 02:12:51,596
they will ask, "What is his name?"

1566
02:12:51,755 --> 02:12:54,133
And how shall I answer them?

1567
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:58,217
I am that I am.

1568
02:13:00,181 --> 02:13:02,525
Thou shalt say,

1569
02:13:02,683 --> 02:13:06,904
"l am hath sent me unto you."

1570
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:22,207
Is the holy mountain
forbidden to men?

1571
02:13:22,369 --> 02:13:25,623
Yes. And I am afraid for him.

1572
02:13:25,789 --> 02:13:29,293
Then he is more than man, for look...

1573
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:46,648
Look at his face.

1574
02:13:47,645 --> 02:13:49,739
He has seen God.

1575
02:14:08,165 --> 02:14:14,013
Moses... your hair... your sandals.

1576
02:14:14,171 --> 02:14:16,674
I stood upon holy ground.

1577
02:14:18,092 --> 02:14:20,686
Can you tell us, Moses?

1578
02:14:20,844 --> 02:14:23,347
My eyes could not look upon him.

1579
02:14:23,514 --> 02:14:25,232
Did he speak?

1580
02:14:26,141 --> 02:14:29,361
He revealed his word to my mind.

1581
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:33,240
And the word was God.

1582
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:35,948
Did he speak as a man?

1583
02:14:36,110 --> 02:14:39,455
He is not flesh but spirit.

1584
02:14:39,613 --> 02:14:42,207
The light of eternal mind.

1585
02:14:43,158 --> 02:14:46,833
And I know that his light
is in every man.

1586
02:14:46,996 --> 02:14:49,215
Did he ask something of you?

1587
02:14:52,001 --> 02:14:54,720
That I go to Egypt.

1588
02:14:54,878 --> 02:14:59,475
You are God's messenger!
He has set the day of deliverance.

1589
02:14:59,633 --> 02:15:02,352
I will get water and bread
that we may leave at once.

1590
02:15:02,511 --> 02:15:04,889
But Egypt holds death for you.

1591
02:15:05,055 --> 02:15:07,183
If it be his will.

1592
02:15:08,851 --> 02:15:11,821
Where he sends you, I shall go.

1593
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:14,732
Your God is my God.

1594
02:15:14,898 --> 02:15:18,448
I will lead men against the armory
at Migdol and get swords for the people!

1595
02:15:18,611 --> 02:15:22,036
It is not by the sword
that he will deliver his people,

1596
02:15:22,906 --> 02:15:25,409
but by the staff of a shepherd.

1597
02:18:07,613 --> 02:18:10,287
And the Lord said unto Moses,

1598
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:13,999
"Go. Return into Egypt."

1599
02:18:14,161 --> 02:18:16,960
And Moses took his wife and his son

1600
02:18:17,122 --> 02:18:20,217
and he returned to the land of Egypt.

1601
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:24,255
And Moses took the rod of God
in his hand.

1602
02:18:25,923 --> 02:18:31,430
Let the ambassador from Priam,
king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.

1603
02:18:37,643 --> 02:18:41,773
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy
is a fabulous fabric

1604
02:18:41,939 --> 02:18:44,067
from the land of the five rivers.

1605
02:18:49,655 --> 02:18:53,501
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.

1606
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:57,630
- It shimmers like the Nile. What is it?
- How is it made?

1607
02:18:57,788 --> 02:19:02,089
No one knows, great Pharaoh.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.

1608
02:19:02,251 --> 02:19:06,427
- They call it silk.
- The ambassador from Jericho.

1609
02:19:10,425 --> 02:19:12,803
What kingdom has sent you?

1610
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:15,473
The kingdom of the Most High.

1611
02:19:18,767 --> 02:19:21,896
These must be ambassadors from...

1612
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:23,655
Bedouins?

1613
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:30,496
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.

1614
02:19:41,164 --> 02:19:42,290
What is this word?

1615
02:19:42,457 --> 02:19:46,087
Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel,

1616
02:19:46,253 --> 02:19:48,301
"Let my people go!"

1617
02:19:48,463 --> 02:19:50,841
The slaves are mine.

1618
02:19:51,008 --> 02:19:53,682
Their lives are mine.

1619
02:19:53,844 --> 02:19:56,347
All that they own is mine.

1620
02:19:58,015 --> 02:20:00,734
I do not know your God,

1621
02:20:00,893 --> 02:20:02,987
nor will I let Israel go.

1622
02:20:03,687 --> 02:20:07,442
Who are you to make their lives
bitter in hard bondage?

1623
02:20:07,608 --> 02:20:11,863
Men shall be ruled by law,
not the will of other men.

1624
02:20:13,697 --> 02:20:17,873
Who is this God
that I should let your people go?

1625
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:19,235
Aaron.

1626
02:20:21,204 --> 02:20:24,299
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh

1627
02:20:24,458 --> 02:20:27,962
that he may see the power of God.

1628
02:20:29,796 --> 02:20:33,767
In this you shall know
that the Lord is God.

1629
02:20:44,728 --> 02:20:46,605
Mother! Mother!

1630
02:20:46,772 --> 02:20:49,150
He turned his staff into a cobra!

1631
02:20:53,195 --> 02:20:55,539
Nothing of his will harm you, my son.

1632
02:21:02,412 --> 02:21:06,258
The power of your God
is a cheap magician's trick.

1633
02:21:06,416 --> 02:21:07,759
Jannes.

1634
02:21:26,269 --> 02:21:27,816
Mother, look!

1635
02:21:35,988 --> 02:21:39,083
Jannes, do you see?

1636
02:21:39,616 --> 02:21:41,835
Moses' serpent swallows up the others.

1637
02:21:51,837 --> 02:21:56,138
You gave me this staff
to rule over scorpions and serpents,

1638
02:21:56,299 --> 02:22:00,224
but God made it a rod
to rule over kings.

1639
02:22:00,929 --> 02:22:04,900
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.

1640
02:22:07,019 --> 02:22:08,019
Obey?

1641
02:22:09,271 --> 02:22:11,569
Moses, Moses.

1642
02:22:12,691 --> 02:22:14,193
Are there no magicians in Egypt

1643
02:22:14,359 --> 02:22:17,829
that you have come back
to make serpents out of sticks?

1644
02:22:17,988 --> 02:22:20,707
Or cause rabbits to appear?

1645
02:22:28,665 --> 02:22:32,420
I will give your staff
a greater wonder to perform.

1646
02:22:34,046 --> 02:22:37,220
Bear it before your idle people

1647
02:22:37,382 --> 02:22:40,682
and bid them make bricks without straw.

1648
02:22:40,844 --> 02:22:42,812
How can people make bricks
without straw?

1649
02:22:42,971 --> 02:22:45,065
Let his staff provide them with it.

1650
02:22:47,142 --> 02:22:50,362
Or let them glean straw in the fields
for themselves.

1651
02:22:54,691 --> 02:22:57,945
But their tally of bricks
shall not diminish.

1652
02:22:58,528 --> 02:23:00,530
So let it be written.

1653
02:23:01,948 --> 02:23:03,291
So let it be done.

1654
02:23:22,052 --> 02:23:23,770
We are free!

1655
02:23:31,812 --> 02:23:36,113
Aaron! Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?

1656
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:38,697
We do not leave Egypt.

1657
02:23:40,487 --> 02:23:42,740
But Moses promised us.

1658
02:23:43,865 --> 02:23:46,118
But you said we'd be freed!

1659
02:23:47,327 --> 02:23:50,251
I have brought more evil upon you.

1660
02:23:51,331 --> 02:23:55,381
God forgive my weak use
of his strength.

1661
02:23:55,544 --> 02:23:58,718
- Weak use?
- Moses, what have you done to us?

1662
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:03,386
It is Pharaoh's order
that you be given no straw

1663
02:24:03,552 --> 02:24:07,227
- to make your tally of bricks.
- No straw?

1664
02:24:09,391 --> 02:24:12,361
How can we make bricks without straw?

1665
02:24:12,519 --> 02:24:16,695
You will glean the stubble
of the fields by night.

1666
02:24:16,857 --> 02:24:18,734
And your women and children, too.

1667
02:24:19,484 --> 02:24:20,952
Is this the deliverer?

1668
02:24:21,111 --> 02:24:23,364
You've brought
the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!

1669
02:24:23,530 --> 02:24:26,033
You put a sword in their hands
to kill us!

1670
02:24:26,199 --> 02:24:28,918
Stone him! Stone him!

1671
02:24:37,502 --> 02:24:40,346
Stand aside! Come!

1672
02:24:42,799 --> 02:24:44,199
Follow!

1673
02:24:50,849 --> 02:24:55,730
There goes your deliverer.
Now, go find your straw.

1674
02:24:55,896 --> 02:25:00,151
Remember, the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.

1675
02:25:28,678 --> 02:25:31,181
I cursed you.

1676
02:25:31,348 --> 02:25:36,320
Each time Rameses took me
in his arms, I cursed you, not him,

1677
02:25:36,478 --> 02:25:39,231
because I love you.

1678
02:25:39,397 --> 02:25:42,571
The Moses who loved you
was another man.

1679
02:25:42,734 --> 02:25:44,782
No, he was not.

1680
02:25:45,946 --> 02:25:49,371
You believe you've changed,
but you haven't.

1681
02:25:49,532 --> 02:25:53,287
You call yourself a prophet,
a man of God,

1682
02:25:53,453 --> 02:25:55,876
but I know better.

1683
02:25:56,039 --> 02:25:59,919
I don't believe that only the thunder
of a mountain stirs your heart,

1684
02:26:00,085 --> 02:26:02,304
as you stir mine.

1685
02:26:02,462 --> 02:26:07,639
Nefretiri, I have stood in the
burning light of God's own presence.

1686
02:26:09,886 --> 02:26:12,514
It was not he who saved you just now.

1687
02:26:12,681 --> 02:26:14,809
I did that.

1688
02:26:14,975 --> 02:26:17,603
Oh, Moses, Moses.

1689
02:26:18,561 --> 02:26:23,158
Why, of all men, did I fall in love
with the prince of fools?

1690
02:26:25,318 --> 02:26:29,573
But I believe anything you tell me
when I'm in your arms.

1691
02:26:30,824 --> 02:26:33,373
Why must you deny me and yourself?

1692
02:26:33,535 --> 02:26:36,539
Because I am bound to a God

1693
02:26:36,705 --> 02:26:39,709
and to a people
and to a shepherd girl.

1694
02:26:42,544 --> 02:26:46,515
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?

1695
02:26:47,507 --> 02:26:51,182
Unless the desert sun
has dulled your senses.

1696
02:26:52,262 --> 02:26:56,859
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?

1697
02:26:57,017 --> 02:27:01,022
Or is it soft as mine?

1698
02:27:01,187 --> 02:27:04,236
Are her lips chafed and dry
as the desert sand?

1699
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:07,778
Or are they moist and red

1700
02:27:07,944 --> 02:27:10,038
like a pomegranate?

1701
02:27:12,282 --> 02:27:16,378
Is it the fragrance of myrrh
that scents her hair?

1702
02:27:17,871 --> 02:27:20,249
Or is it the odor of sheep?

1703
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:25,470
There is a beauty
beyond the senses, Nefretiri.

1704
02:27:26,421 --> 02:27:31,803
Beauty like the quiet
of green valleys and still waters.

1705
02:27:32,886 --> 02:27:36,481
Beauty of the spirit
that you cannot understand.

1706
02:27:39,142 --> 02:27:40,689
Perhaps not.

1707
02:27:43,146 --> 02:27:46,650
But beauty of the spirit
will not free your people, Moses.

1708
02:27:47,901 --> 02:27:53,579
You will come to me
or they will never leave Egypt.

1709
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:57,836
The fate of Israel
is not in your hands, Nefretiri.

1710
02:27:57,994 --> 02:27:59,962
Oh, isn't it?

1711
02:28:00,663 --> 02:28:03,462
Who else can soften Pharaoh's heart?

1712
02:28:05,293 --> 02:28:07,341
Or harden it?

1713
02:28:09,506 --> 02:28:10,506
Yes-

1714
02:28:11,716 --> 02:28:14,014
You may be the lovely dust

1715
02:28:14,177 --> 02:28:17,397
through which God
will work his purpose.

1716
02:28:24,938 --> 02:28:27,566
Fill every jar in your house with water-

1717
02:28:27,732 --> 02:28:30,234
Tell the others that for seven days
there will be none to drink.

1718
02:28:30,334 --> 02:28:33,246
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.

1719
02:28:33,405 --> 02:28:34,622
What does it mean?

1720
02:28:34,781 --> 02:28:38,502
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.

1721
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:41,004
So fill your jars or go thirsty.

1722
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:47,428
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, I'm going back for more jars.

1723
02:28:47,585 --> 02:28:49,258
No water for seven days.

1724
02:28:50,213 --> 02:28:52,307
Yes, Joshua.

1725
02:28:52,465 --> 02:28:54,513
She comes to the well every day.

1726
02:28:55,343 --> 02:28:57,687
Wait, and you will see her.

1727
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:09,733
It is wise of Dathan
to send you to the well, Lilia,

1728
02:29:09,899 --> 02:29:12,368
or he might find his water poisoned.

1729
02:29:15,029 --> 02:29:17,077
They told me you were dead.

1730
02:29:19,659 --> 02:29:23,004
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.

1731
02:29:25,915 --> 02:29:30,887
- Dathan?
- Yes. Dathan.

1732
02:29:31,421 --> 02:29:34,300
Of your own free will?

1733
02:29:34,466 --> 02:29:36,719
Of my own free will.

1734
02:29:38,428 --> 02:29:42,274
You are no man's slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.

1735
02:29:42,432 --> 02:29:44,776
Not for me, Joshua.

1736
02:29:49,689 --> 02:29:52,363
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!

1737
02:29:52,525 --> 02:29:55,278
Thy life-giving waters
are the blood of Egypt.

1738
02:29:56,446 --> 02:29:59,290
Hail to thee, maker of barley,

1739
02:29:59,449 --> 02:30:03,295
feeder of cattle, carrier of ships,

1740
02:30:03,453 --> 02:30:06,081
greatest of all the gods.

1741
02:30:06,247 --> 02:30:10,969
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.

1742
02:30:11,127 --> 02:30:13,926
Let my people go!

1743
02:30:15,006 --> 02:30:17,008
- The point of the sword...
- Let him rave on,

1744
02:30:17,175 --> 02:30:19,598
that men shall know him mad.

1745
02:30:22,388 --> 02:30:24,311
Obey the Lord,

1746
02:30:24,474 --> 02:30:27,978
or he will raise his hand
against the waters of the river.

1747
02:30:28,144 --> 02:30:32,365
I have come to bless the waters,
you have come to curse them.

1748
02:30:32,524 --> 02:30:36,870
We will learn if a god of shepherds
is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.

1749
02:30:37,987 --> 02:30:41,617
Water of life,
give drink to the desert

1750
02:30:41,783 --> 02:30:45,162
- and make green the meadow.
- Aaron.

1751
02:30:46,996 --> 02:30:50,170
Stretch out my staff
against the waters.

1752
02:31:00,093 --> 02:31:02,391
- Look!
- There!

1753
02:31:02,554 --> 02:31:04,727
Where he struck the river,
it bleeds.

1754
02:31:04,889 --> 02:31:06,891
The water turns to blood!

1755
02:31:17,151 --> 02:31:19,199
Blood flows from the god!

1756
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:22,953
See how it spreads.

1757
02:31:25,743 --> 02:31:27,711
It is blood!

1758
02:31:35,003 --> 02:31:38,382
That you may know
the power of the Lord,

1759
02:31:38,548 --> 02:31:42,052
for seven days, Egypt will thirst.

1760
02:31:42,218 --> 02:31:45,062
Seven days without water!
Fill every jug and jar!

1761
02:31:45,221 --> 02:31:49,271
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
- Were it seven times seven days,

1762
02:31:49,434 --> 02:31:53,234
no magician's trick
will set your people free.

1763
02:31:57,650 --> 02:31:59,698
Sacred water,

1764
02:31:59,861 --> 02:32:04,287
make pure the flood
from which you came.

1765
02:32:13,625 --> 02:32:18,131
And God smote the land
with all manner of plagues,

1766
02:32:18,296 --> 02:32:21,266
but still Pharaoh 's heart
was hardened.

1767
02:32:30,516 --> 02:32:33,565
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.

1768
02:32:33,728 --> 02:32:36,698
They would cry louder
if they had to make the bricks.

1769
02:32:38,524 --> 02:32:40,310
- Send them away.
- The people have been plagued

1770
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:44,452
by thirst, they've been plagued
by frogs, by lice, by flies,

1771
02:32:44,614 --> 02:32:46,833
by sickness, by boils.
They can endure no more.

1772
02:32:46,991 --> 02:32:48,334
Back to your homes!

1773
02:32:48,493 --> 02:32:50,587
Why do you bring
this worker of evil before me?

1774
02:32:50,745 --> 02:32:53,464
The people desert the temples.

1775
02:32:53,623 --> 02:32:56,172
- They turn from the gods.
- What gods?

1776
02:32:56,334 --> 02:32:58,132
You prophets and priests
made the gods,

1777
02:32:58,294 --> 02:33:01,719
that you may prey upon
the fears of men.

1778
02:33:01,881 --> 02:33:05,806
When the Nile ran red,
I too was afraid,

1779
02:33:05,968 --> 02:33:09,097
until word came of a mountain
beyond the cataracts

1780
02:33:09,263 --> 02:33:13,018
which spewed red mud
and poisoned the water.

1781
02:33:14,143 --> 02:33:17,022
Was it the staff I gave you
that caused all this?

1782
02:33:17,188 --> 02:33:19,316
Was it the wonder of your god
that fish should die

1783
02:33:19,482 --> 02:33:21,484
and frogs should leave the waters?

1784
02:33:21,651 --> 02:33:24,905
Was it a miracle that flies and lice
should bloat upon their carrion

1785
02:33:25,071 --> 02:33:27,699
and spread disease
in both man and beast?

1786
02:33:28,533 --> 02:33:32,003
These things were ordered
by themselves,

1787
02:33:32,161 --> 02:33:34,789
not by any god!

1788
02:33:34,956 --> 02:33:36,556
Now, go.

1789
02:33:41,921 --> 02:33:45,346
That you may know
these things are done of God...

1790
02:33:50,555 --> 02:33:54,185
...you shall see hail fall
from a clear sky

1791
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:58,025
and burn as fire upon the ground.

1792
02:33:58,187 --> 02:34:00,531
You shall see darkness cover Egypt

1793
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:03,944
when the sun climbs high to noon.

1794
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:07,865
And you shall know that God is God

1795
02:34:08,030 --> 02:34:11,159
and bow down to his will.

1796
02:34:11,325 --> 02:34:16,502
Nothing of this Earth
can make me bow to you, Moses.

1797
02:34:16,664 --> 02:34:19,918
Behold, the hail comes.

1798
02:34:20,877 --> 02:34:24,427
When darkness has covered Egypt
for three days,

1799
02:34:24,589 --> 02:34:27,388
your ministers will send for me.

1800
02:35:11,427 --> 02:35:12,770
In the three days of darkness,

1801
02:35:12,929 --> 02:35:16,809
you have whined like
frightened children in the night.

1802
02:35:16,974 --> 02:35:21,024
Moses said the sun would shine
in three days and it is true.

1803
02:35:21,187 --> 02:35:23,110
Oh, great one, let his people go,

1804
02:35:23,272 --> 02:35:27,322
or all of Egypt will be barren
from the cataracts to the sea.

1805
02:35:28,945 --> 02:35:31,414
Will my father free the slaves?

1806
02:35:31,572 --> 02:35:34,792
Can taxes be collected
from dead cattle and blighted harvests?

1807
02:35:34,951 --> 02:35:39,297
Does fear rule Egypt, or do I?

1808
02:35:39,455 --> 02:35:41,457
We fear no army of the Earth,

1809
02:35:41,624 --> 02:35:43,592
but can we fight plagues with swords?

1810
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:45,003
There is no shame in this.

1811
02:35:45,169 --> 02:35:46,466
The strongest tree bends.

1812
02:35:46,629 --> 02:35:50,054
It is not Pharaoh
who yields to the slave,

1813
02:35:51,092 --> 02:35:52,890
but his counselors.

1814
02:35:53,052 --> 02:35:56,647
I have summoned Moses
at your request.

1815
02:35:58,641 --> 02:36:00,643
People will bless you, great one.

1816
02:36:00,810 --> 02:36:02,858
No other choice, Pharaoh.

1817
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:06,991
Does the world bow
to an empty throne?

1818
02:36:07,149 --> 02:36:08,349
Empty?

1819
02:36:09,443 --> 02:36:13,323
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart
against his son?

1820
02:36:13,489 --> 02:36:17,119
If you let the Hebrews go,
who will build his cities?

1821
02:36:17,285 --> 02:36:20,334
You told Moses
to make bricks without straw.

1822
02:36:20,496 --> 02:36:24,342
Now, he tells you
to make cities without bricks!

1823
02:36:25,793 --> 02:36:29,889
Who is the slave,
and who is the Pharaoh?

1824
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:34,014
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?

1825
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:37,521
Yes, the laughter of kings

1826
02:36:38,097 --> 02:36:40,850
in Babylon, in Canaan,

1827
02:36:41,017 --> 02:36:42,617
in Troy,

1828
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:49,151
as Egypt surrenders
to the god of slaves!

1829
02:36:55,114 --> 02:36:57,242
Bring the Hebrew in.

1830
02:37:01,037 --> 02:37:04,541
Go into the garden.
It's not good for a son of Pharaoh

1831
02:37:04,707 --> 02:37:08,712
to see his father humbled
by a son of slaves.

1832
02:37:08,878 --> 02:37:12,724
My son, stand beside me.

1833
02:37:20,056 --> 02:37:24,607
Have the days of darkness
made you see the light, Rameses?

1834
02:37:25,227 --> 02:37:27,400
Will you now free my people?

1835
02:37:27,563 --> 02:37:31,113
Great one,
bid the scribe read the order.

1836
02:37:31,275 --> 02:37:33,073
Give me the writing.

1837
02:37:39,533 --> 02:37:40,705
Sublime, ye Pharaoh.

1838
02:37:40,868 --> 02:37:43,041
You cannot resist the power
of his god!

1839
02:37:43,204 --> 02:37:45,707
I know not his god!

1840
02:37:45,873 --> 02:37:48,001
Neither will I let his people go.

1841
02:37:55,508 --> 02:37:59,729
How long will you refuse
to humble yourself before God?

1842
02:38:00,763 --> 02:38:03,937
If you bring another plague upon us,

1843
02:38:04,100 --> 02:38:08,606
it is not your god but I who will
turn the Nile red with blood.

1844
02:38:08,771 --> 02:38:12,241
As your father's father
turned the streets of Goshen red

1845
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:14,869
with the blood of our male children!

1846
02:38:15,027 --> 02:38:18,372
If there is one more plague on Egypt,

1847
02:38:18,531 --> 02:38:22,286
it is by your word
that God will bring it.

1848
02:38:22,451 --> 02:38:26,627
And there shall be so great a cry
throughout the land

1849
02:38:26,789 --> 02:38:30,589
that you will surely
let the people go.

1850
02:38:33,504 --> 02:38:36,098
Come to me no more, Moses,

1851
02:38:36,257 --> 02:38:40,228
for on the day
you see my face again,

1852
02:38:40,386 --> 02:38:42,730
you will surely die.

1853
02:38:44,056 --> 02:38:46,024
So let it be written.

1854
02:38:52,606 --> 02:38:55,655
I will give this spawn of slaves
and his god

1855
02:38:55,818 --> 02:38:58,196
an answer the world will not forget!

1856
02:38:59,071 --> 02:39:04,077
Commander of the Host,
call on the chariots from Tanis.

1857
02:39:04,243 --> 02:39:07,668
There shall be one more plague,

1858
02:39:07,830 --> 02:39:10,959
only it will come upon
the slaves of Goshen!

1859
02:39:11,751 --> 02:39:14,846
First-born of each house shall die,

1860
02:39:16,005 --> 02:39:18,349
beginning with the son of Moses.

1861
02:39:53,459 --> 02:39:56,508
You are the shepherd girl
that Moses married?

1862
02:39:56,670 --> 02:40:01,676
The queen of Egypt is beautiful,
as he told me.

1863
02:40:04,637 --> 02:40:06,605
My husband is not here.

1864
02:40:14,063 --> 02:40:16,737
Is this Moses' son?

1865
02:40:16,899 --> 02:40:18,993
Yes, this is our son.

1866
02:40:19,902 --> 02:40:22,405
What do you want of us?

1867
02:40:22,571 --> 02:40:24,790
You need have no fear of me.

1868
02:40:26,033 --> 02:40:28,661
I feared only his memory of you.

1869
02:40:30,412 --> 02:40:32,881
You have been able to erase it?

1870
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:37,128
He has forgotten both of us.

1871
02:40:39,922 --> 02:40:43,017
You lost him
when he went to seek his God.

1872
02:40:44,426 --> 02:40:47,555
I lost him when he found his God.

1873
02:40:49,056 --> 02:40:51,980
At least he left you
a son to cherish.

1874
02:40:53,435 --> 02:40:55,938
I am here to save his son.

1875
02:40:57,398 --> 02:40:59,617
- From what?
- From Pharaoh's decree

1876
02:40:59,775 --> 02:41:02,449
that the first-born
of Israel must die.

1877
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:05,280
Die?

1878
02:41:07,616 --> 02:41:09,789
God of Abraham!

1879
02:41:11,036 --> 02:41:16,133
Don't let him do this!
Not to the children!

1880
02:41:16,292 --> 02:41:19,171
A caravan for Midian
is waiting for you and your son.

1881
02:41:19,336 --> 02:41:21,304
My chariot will bring you to it.

1882
02:41:46,655 --> 02:41:48,874
I'm surprised you noticed me.

1883
02:41:50,159 --> 02:41:53,003
You didn't at the palace this morning,
you know?

1884
02:41:53,162 --> 02:41:56,962
Why? Were you afraid to look at me?

1885
02:41:58,167 --> 02:42:00,340
What do you want, Nefretiri?

1886
02:42:00,502 --> 02:42:02,702
You, Moses.

1887
02:42:03,172 --> 02:42:05,345
Everything about us
is coming to an end!

1888
02:42:06,425 --> 02:42:09,520
You will destroy Egypt
or Egypt will destroy you.

1889
02:42:10,346 --> 02:42:12,440
I belong to you, Moses.

1890
02:42:18,145 --> 02:42:21,194
She's gone with your son to Midian.

1891
02:42:21,357 --> 02:42:23,280
Why would she leave?

1892
02:42:23,442 --> 02:42:27,072
She knew you would try to save the
other children before your own son.

1893
02:42:27,238 --> 02:42:29,411
Save the other children? From what?

1894
02:42:29,573 --> 02:42:33,749
Rameses is massing the Libyan axmen,
the chariots, the Sardinian swordsmen.

1895
02:42:33,911 --> 02:42:35,788
Why? Tell me why!

1896
02:42:35,955 --> 02:42:40,051
- To destroy the first-born of Israel.
- Oh, God!

1897
02:42:40,876 --> 02:42:42,276
My God!

1898
02:42:42,586 --> 02:42:45,635
Out of his own mouth
comes thy judgment!

1899
02:42:45,798 --> 02:42:48,972
- But I have saved your son, Moses.
- It is not my son who will die!

1900
02:42:49,134 --> 02:42:51,228
It is... It is the first-born of Egypt!

1901
02:42:51,387 --> 02:42:53,685
It is your son, Nefretiri!

1902
02:42:56,016 --> 02:42:59,065
You would not dare
strike Pharaoh's son!

1903
02:42:59,228 --> 02:43:01,731
In the hardness of his heart,
Pharaoh has mocked God

1904
02:43:01,897 --> 02:43:04,150
and brings death to his own son!

1905
02:43:04,316 --> 02:43:07,570
But he's my son, Moses.

1906
02:43:07,736 --> 02:43:10,831
You would not harm my son?

1907
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:12,742
By myself, I am nothing.

1908
02:43:12,908 --> 02:43:16,708
It is the power of God
which uses me to work his will.

1909
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:19,965
You would not let him do this to me.

1910
02:43:20,124 --> 02:43:22,377
I saved your son.

1911
02:43:22,543 --> 02:43:24,796
I cannot save yours.

1912
02:43:24,962 --> 02:43:27,465
Your god listens to you, Moses.

1913
02:43:28,882 --> 02:43:31,305
About midnight,

1914
02:43:31,468 --> 02:43:35,223
the destroyer will come
into the midst of Egypt

1915
02:43:35,389 --> 02:43:37,437
and all the first-born shall die,

1916
02:43:37,599 --> 02:43:41,729
from the first-born of Pharaoh
to the first-born of his servants.

1917
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:46,074
When you were Prince of Egypt,

1918
02:43:46,233 --> 02:43:48,827
you held me in your arms.

1919
02:43:48,986 --> 02:43:50,704
When you were a condemned slave,

1920
02:43:50,863 --> 02:43:55,118
I threw myself at your feet
before the court of Pharaoh.

1921
02:43:55,284 --> 02:43:57,286
Because I loved you, Moses.

1922
02:43:57,453 --> 02:44:01,299
It is the Lord
who executes judgment, Nefretiri.

1923
02:44:03,625 --> 02:44:05,627
Go back to your son.

1924
02:44:10,883 --> 02:44:14,558
Your love for me is stronger
than the power of any god.

1925
02:44:17,014 --> 02:44:19,767
You will not kill my son.

1926
02:44:25,689 --> 02:44:28,989
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!

1927
02:44:43,665 --> 02:44:46,885
Death cometh to me

1928
02:44:47,878 --> 02:44:50,678
To set me free

1929
02:44:52,633 --> 02:44:56,833
Death cometh to me...

1930
02:44:57,513 --> 02:45:01,188
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.

1931
02:45:04,436 --> 02:45:05,836
Joshua!

1932
02:45:08,023 --> 02:45:11,072
Joshua, you risk your life
in coming here.

1933
02:45:11,235 --> 02:45:14,705
- You are first-born.
- So are you.

1934
02:45:16,198 --> 02:45:21,045
I bring lamb's blood to mark
the doorposts and lintel,

1935
02:45:21,203 --> 02:45:23,547
that the Angel of Death
may pass you by.

1936
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:28,010
Joshua, it is enough
that you have come to me.

1937
02:45:29,086 --> 02:45:31,680
I am outcast among our people-

1938
02:45:32,631 --> 02:45:36,181
Don't save me from death, Joshua,
save me from life.

1939
02:45:36,343 --> 02:45:39,187
Tomorrow will bring a new world
for us, Lilia.

1940
02:45:39,346 --> 02:45:43,067
There will be no new world!
And no blood on this door!

1941
02:45:43,225 --> 02:45:46,775
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God's promise!

1942
02:45:46,937 --> 02:45:50,407
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.

1943
02:45:50,566 --> 02:45:55,117
Remember, Joshua,
of her own free will she's mine.

1944
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:52,048
And under his wing shalt thou trust

1945
02:46:55,005 --> 02:46:57,679
"Though we stand
in the shadow of death,

1946
02:46:57,841 --> 02:47:00,765
the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one."

1947
02:47:00,928 --> 02:47:03,727
"The Lord is our God.
The Lord is one."

1948
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:09,361
His truth shall be thy shield

1949
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:13,491
"Shield us through this night
of terror, O King of the Universe."

1950
02:47:18,153 --> 02:47:19,905
Why is everyone afraid?

1951
02:47:20,072 --> 02:47:23,542
Why is this night
different from all others?

1952
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:26,829
Because this night the Lord our God

1953
02:47:26,995 --> 02:47:29,589
will deliver us
from the bondage of Egypt.

1954
02:47:29,748 --> 02:47:33,719
Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night

1955
02:47:33,877 --> 02:47:35,424
Stand all!

1956
02:47:37,923 --> 02:47:41,518
- Pharaoh's soldiers!
- Or worse!

1957
02:47:46,515 --> 02:47:50,270
Or from the arrow that flyeth by day

1958
02:47:54,064 --> 02:47:55,664
Bithiah!

1959
02:47:56,149 --> 02:47:59,824
In fear of your god,
they have set me free.

1960
02:47:59,987 --> 02:48:02,035
May a stranger enter?

1961
02:48:04,449 --> 02:48:08,579
There are no strangers
among those who seek God's mercy.

1962
02:48:09,746 --> 02:48:11,669
My bearers?

1963
02:48:11,832 --> 02:48:14,881
All who thirst for freedom
may come with us.

1964
02:48:18,255 --> 02:48:21,350
The darkness of death
will pass over us tonight.

1965
02:48:21,508 --> 02:48:24,261
Tomorrow the light of freedom
will shine upon us

1966
02:48:24,428 --> 02:48:28,353
- as we go forth from Egypt.
- I shall go with you, Moses.

1967
02:48:28,515 --> 02:48:31,769
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!

1968
02:48:31,935 --> 02:48:35,690
- The gods of Egypt.
- An idol-worshipper!

1969
02:48:35,856 --> 02:48:38,325
This woman drew me from the Nile

1970
02:48:38,483 --> 02:48:42,533
and set my feet
upon the path of knowledge.

1971
02:48:42,696 --> 02:48:47,418
Mered, bring a chair to our table
for the daughter of Pharaoh.

1972
02:48:47,576 --> 02:48:51,376
There is a great light
that shines from your face, Moses.

1973
02:48:51,538 --> 02:48:53,916
Perhaps some day
I shall come to understand it.

1974
02:48:54,082 --> 02:48:56,585
He is God's messenger, Princess.

1975
02:50:04,027 --> 02:50:07,497
If it is not forbidden to look upon
the breath of pestilence,

1976
02:50:07,656 --> 02:50:10,910
then see, for it is here.

1977
02:50:12,119 --> 02:50:14,622
Do not look, Eleazar.

1978
02:50:14,788 --> 02:50:18,918
Close the door, Joshua,
and let death pass.

1979
02:50:27,008 --> 02:50:30,433
Will it pass, Moses? Will it pass?

1980
02:50:30,595 --> 02:50:33,269
That is God's promise, Elisheba.

1981
02:50:40,147 --> 02:50:43,117
"Blessed art thou, O Lord our God,

1982
02:50:43,275 --> 02:50:46,199
who bringeth forth bread
from the Earth."

1983
02:50:52,993 --> 02:50:54,793
Run! Run!

1984
02:50:55,579 --> 02:50:59,049
There shall no evil befall you,

1985
02:50:59,207 --> 02:51:01,426
or any plagues come near you.

1986
02:51:01,585 --> 02:51:04,429
A thousand shall fall at thy sight

1987
02:51:04,588 --> 02:51:07,888
Why do we eat unleavened bread
and bitter herbs, my uncle?

1988
02:51:08,049 --> 02:51:12,555
- The herbs...
- Faster! Take the other road!

1989
02:51:16,558 --> 02:51:20,938
The herbs remind us of the
bitterness of our captivity, Eleazar.

1990
02:51:21,104 --> 02:51:24,984
But it shall not come nigh thee

1991
02:51:25,150 --> 02:51:27,323
This is the bread of haste,

1992
02:51:27,486 --> 02:51:29,454
that you will remember this night

1993
02:51:29,613 --> 02:51:33,038
from generation to generation forever.

1994
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:36,579
Oh, my baby! Give me back my baby!

1995
02:51:36,745 --> 02:51:41,751
- They are my people.
- All are God's people.

1996
02:51:45,504 --> 02:51:48,098
Death is all around us!

1997
02:51:48,256 --> 02:51:51,681
But it passes those
who have believed the Lord.

1998
02:51:53,011 --> 02:51:56,015
Always remember, Eleazar,

1999
02:51:56,181 --> 02:51:58,809
he passed over your house.

2000
02:52:06,608 --> 02:52:09,953
Are the captains of Egypt
afraid of a night mist?

2001
02:52:10,111 --> 02:52:14,958
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil's curse! Look!

2002
02:52:33,385 --> 02:52:36,184
I've known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh,

2003
02:52:36,346 --> 02:52:38,644
but I've not known fear till tonight.

2004
02:52:38,807 --> 02:52:39,807
Aide.

2005
02:52:43,061 --> 02:52:45,359
Have the captains join their men.

2006
02:52:46,314 --> 02:52:49,158
At the coming of dawn, we will strike.

2007
02:52:49,985 --> 02:52:52,909
No first-born Hebrew shall live.

2008
02:53:06,376 --> 02:53:09,004
Let the Hebrews go, great one,

2009
02:53:09,170 --> 02:53:11,593
or we are all dead men.

2010
02:53:24,561 --> 02:53:26,279
He was your son?

2011
02:53:27,230 --> 02:53:29,358
My first-born.

2012
02:53:51,963 --> 02:53:56,685
There is no magic cure,
no spell to use.

2013
02:53:56,843 --> 02:53:59,346
He is the first-born of Pharaoh.

2014
02:53:59,512 --> 02:54:04,063
We have no skill
before this... pestilence.

2015
02:54:08,647 --> 02:54:13,073
- My father.
- My son.

2016
02:54:13,902 --> 02:54:16,701
Your own curse is on him.

2017
02:54:16,863 --> 02:54:20,413
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.

2018
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:23,003
I would not let his people go

2019
02:54:23,161 --> 02:54:26,756
because your serpent's tongue
hardened my heart.

2020
02:54:27,916 --> 02:54:31,420
You only thought to keep Moses here.

2021
02:54:31,586 --> 02:54:35,261
You cared nothing for my throne,

2022
02:54:35,423 --> 02:54:37,423
or my son-

2023
02:54:38,593 --> 02:54:41,187
I asked Moses for his life.

2024
02:54:42,973 --> 02:54:45,852
The shadow of death is on his face.

2025
02:54:46,017 --> 02:54:50,417
No... he will not die.

2026
02:54:52,315 --> 02:54:53,817
Captain.

2027
02:54:54,734 --> 02:54:58,739
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.

2028
02:54:58,905 --> 02:55:01,033
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.

2029
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:04,418
He's my only son.

2030
02:55:41,322 --> 02:55:43,620
You have conquered, Moses.

2031
02:55:45,201 --> 02:55:48,831
The foot of a slave
is on the neck of Egypt.

2032
02:55:50,832 --> 02:55:53,802
You were saved from the Nile
to be a curse upon me.

2033
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:56,930
Your shadow fell
between me and my father,

2034
02:55:57,088 --> 02:56:00,467
between me and my fame,

2035
02:56:01,843 --> 02:56:04,096
between me and my queen.

2036
02:56:04,262 --> 02:56:08,438
Your shadow now fills
all things with death.

2037
02:56:09,559 --> 02:56:12,654
Go out from among us,
you and your people.

2038
02:56:12,812 --> 02:56:14,439
I set you free.

2039
02:56:14,606 --> 02:56:17,029
It is not by your word,

2040
02:56:17,192 --> 02:56:20,116
nor by my hand
that we are free, Pharaoh.

2041
02:56:21,237 --> 02:56:25,333
- The power of God has freed us.
- Enough of your words!

2042
02:56:25,867 --> 02:56:29,542
Take your people, your cattle,
your god and your pestilence.

2043
02:56:29,704 --> 02:56:33,129
Take what spoils
from Egypt you will, but go!

2044
02:56:35,543 --> 02:56:37,743
O Lord God,

2045
02:56:38,963 --> 02:56:41,842
with a strong hand thou dost

2046
02:56:42,008 --> 02:56:44,727
bring us out of bitter bondage.

2047
02:56:47,055 --> 02:56:50,434
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation,

2048
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:54,855
where every man shall reap
what he has sown

2049
02:56:55,021 --> 02:56:58,571
and bow no knee except in prayer.

2050
02:56:59,359 --> 02:57:03,239
We will go with our young
and with our old,

2051
02:57:03,404 --> 02:57:07,204
with our sons
and with our daughters,

2052
02:57:07,367 --> 02:57:11,747
with our flocks
and with our herds will we go,

2053
02:57:11,913 --> 02:57:15,588
for I know that the Lord is great

2054
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:19,254
and that our Lord is above all gods.

2055
02:57:33,309 --> 02:57:35,232
He's dead.

2056
02:58:14,392 --> 02:58:15,592
Sokar,

2057
02:58:17,312 --> 02:58:21,112
great lord of the lower world,

2058
02:58:21,274 --> 02:58:26,201
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt,

2059
02:58:26,362 --> 02:58:28,080
bow before you now.

2060
02:58:28,239 --> 02:58:32,585
Show that you have power
above the god of Moses,

2061
02:58:32,744 --> 02:58:36,624
and restore the life
he has taken from my son.

2062
02:58:38,499 --> 02:58:42,003
Guide back his soul
across the lake of death

2063
02:58:42,170 --> 02:58:45,174
to the place of living men,

2064
02:58:45,340 --> 02:58:49,186
and I will raise a temple to you
mightier than the pyramids.

2065
02:58:49,344 --> 02:58:52,769
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...

2066
02:59:14,827 --> 02:59:17,876
Arise, O Israel!

2067
02:59:18,039 --> 02:59:21,043
Behold the dawn of freedom!

2068
02:59:39,185 --> 02:59:44,066
And it came to pass,
after the stifling night of terror;

2069
02:59:44,232 --> 02:59:48,237
came a day such
as the world had never seen.

2070
02:59:48,403 --> 02:59:51,407
From east and west,
from north and south,

2071
02:59:51,572 --> 02:59:55,167
they came with all they had,
driving their Hooks

2072
02:59:55,326 --> 02:59:57,704
and their herds
and their camels before them.

2073
02:59:57,870 --> 03:00:00,919
By tens, by hundreds, by thousands,

2074
03:00:01,082 --> 03:00:05,053
unending streams
of man and beast and burden,

2075
03:00:05,211 --> 03:00:07,760
and even very much cattle,

2076
03:00:07,922 --> 03:00:10,175
poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes.

2077
03:00:10,341 --> 03:00:15,268
Beneath the stone feet of
the four colossal images of Rameses,

2078
03:00:15,430 --> 03:00:18,149
which their own.sweat
and blood and sinew

2079
03:00:18,308 --> 03:00:20,686
had hewn from solid rock,

2080
03:00:20,852 --> 03:00:25,449
a nation arose and freedom
was born into the world.

2081
03:00:27,108 --> 03:00:29,782
Grandfather, have you got Rebecca?

2082
03:00:29,944 --> 03:00:31,617
No, I haven't got Rebecca.

2083
03:00:31,779 --> 03:00:34,658
Here's the kneading trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.

2084
03:00:34,824 --> 03:00:36,451
This is a blessed day!

2085
03:00:36,617 --> 03:00:39,211
- Where's Rebecca?
- Here's Rebecca!

2086
03:00:39,370 --> 03:00:41,293
- Ben Caleb!
- Thank you!

2087
03:00:41,456 --> 03:00:43,834
- Can we take the cattle?
- We're moving to the gates.

2088
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,343
Horn and hoof.

2089
03:00:45,501 --> 03:00:47,720
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.

2090
03:00:47,879 --> 03:00:50,849
Don't forget the oil for the lamps.

2091
03:00:51,007 --> 03:00:52,554
Where are we going, Naomi?

2092
03:00:52,717 --> 03:00:55,516
To some land flowing
with milk and honey!

2093
03:00:55,678 --> 03:00:58,101
I've never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?

2094
03:00:58,264 --> 03:01:01,643
It's away from the whip! Freedom
will wet your throats in the desert.

2095
03:01:01,809 --> 03:01:03,607
Fill your water skins.

2096
03:01:05,271 --> 03:01:08,445
This is the governor's house!
You cannot enter.

2097
03:01:08,608 --> 03:01:10,827
Out! Out, all of you!

2098
03:01:11,778 --> 03:01:14,827
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.

2099
03:01:14,989 --> 03:01:16,866
Then stone bleeds!

2100
03:01:22,663 --> 03:01:26,167
- Harness the mules!
- Your stonecutter did this to me!

2101
03:01:26,334 --> 03:01:30,089
All your gold cannot
wipe that mark from your door, Dathan,

2102
03:01:30,254 --> 03:01:32,052
or from my heart.

2103
03:01:32,215 --> 03:01:34,764
Just for that,
you'll walk all the way to...

2104
03:01:36,010 --> 03:01:38,684
Where are we going?

2105
03:01:38,846 --> 03:01:41,565
- Do you know where we're going?
- To hell, I hope!

2106
03:01:44,685 --> 03:01:48,690
Like Dathan, they did not know
where they were going,

2107
03:01:48,856 --> 03:01:52,827
and they cared no more
than the flocks and herds they drove.

2108
03:01:53,653 --> 03:01:58,079
Now they used the brick yokes
to carry a very different burden.

2109
03:01:59,033 --> 03:02:00,876
And there went forth among them

2110
03:02:01,035 --> 03:02:03,959
planters of vineyards
and sowers of seeds,

2111
03:02:04,122 --> 03:02:07,843
each hoping to sit
under his own vine and Hg tree.

2112
03:02:08,876 --> 03:02:11,220
Out of this glorious chaos,

2113
03:02:11,379 --> 03:02:15,225
it is Joshua
who brings order and purpose.

2114
03:02:16,050 --> 03:02:18,678
Set the standard of each tribe
before all the people!

2115
03:02:18,845 --> 03:02:22,691
Levites in the center, Judah to
the right, Hephron to the left. Go!

2116
03:02:22,849 --> 03:02:23,896
Hallelujah!

2117
03:02:24,058 --> 03:02:26,902
Watch where you're going!
Watch out, you ribbon-carrier!

2118
03:02:27,061 --> 03:02:29,189
Keep your big feet out of my geese!

2119
03:03:04,599 --> 03:03:07,399
His son Joseph

2120
03:03:08,644 --> 03:03:13,444
Many colors was his coat

2121
03:03:17,653 --> 03:03:21,453
Aaron and the elders carry
a shrouded body, Grandfather!

2122
03:03:21,616 --> 03:03:25,120
They bear the bones of Joseph,
to rest in his own land.

2123
03:03:30,166 --> 03:03:32,544
Nubians, Grandfather!

2124
03:03:40,801 --> 03:03:44,897
- Here come treasure wagons!
- Spoils of Egypt.

2125
03:03:45,056 --> 03:03:50,529
All who shared the toil
will share this gold! Here, boy!

2126
03:03:50,686 --> 03:03:52,654
For the blind one!

2127
03:03:52,813 --> 03:03:56,909
It's a little golden calf,
Grandfather, with horns!

2128
03:03:57,068 --> 03:04:00,493
An idol. For idol-worshippers!

2129
03:04:01,781 --> 03:04:03,533
Grandpa, fire-bearers!

2130
03:04:06,827 --> 03:04:09,751
Plant your tires at night
beside the tribal standards,

2131
03:04:09,914 --> 03:04:11,837
where all may
come to light their torches!

2132
03:04:11,999 --> 03:04:16,095
- They'll be burning, Joshua!
- Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.

2133
03:04:16,254 --> 03:04:18,006
Now, the cradle.

2134
03:04:19,465 --> 03:04:20,512
Here, Miriam.

2135
03:04:20,675 --> 03:04:22,075
Joshua!

2136
03:04:23,511 --> 03:04:24,911
Joshua!

2137
03:04:27,265 --> 03:04:29,688
I have wagons
for the midwives and physicians.

2138
03:04:29,850 --> 03:04:32,524
- Where shall they be placed?
- Five thousand cubits, one...

2139
03:04:32,687 --> 03:04:33,939
Where's your whip, Dathan?

2140
03:04:34,105 --> 03:04:37,405
I'll pay you back every lash
you gave me, Dathan!

2141
03:04:43,614 --> 03:04:46,288
Now, is this a day for us
to have hard feelings?

2142
03:04:46,450 --> 03:04:47,622
I've felt your whip!

2143
03:04:47,785 --> 03:04:50,914
- Yes, every day.
- Lilia is no slave, Dathan!

2144
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:53,208
You can carry your own carton.

2145
03:04:53,916 --> 03:04:55,714
Let her ride!

2146
03:04:57,003 --> 03:05:00,223
So, now, my brother,
we have new taskmasters.

2147
03:05:00,381 --> 03:05:03,885
- We serve no masters now!
- Yes, but not for long.

2148
03:05:04,844 --> 03:05:06,892
Here. Old woman.

2149
03:05:08,222 --> 03:05:09,974
- That's it.
- Joshua!

2150
03:05:10,141 --> 03:05:12,269
Make way for the governor!

2151
03:05:19,525 --> 03:05:23,200
- You know who I am.
- I know who you were, Lord Governor.

2152
03:05:23,362 --> 03:05:25,080
I go to serve the Pharaoh-

2153
03:05:25,239 --> 03:05:28,413
Tell Rameses I'm coming
back to my house.

2154
03:05:28,576 --> 03:05:32,297
That rabble may follow Moses
into the desert today,

2155
03:05:33,205 --> 03:05:35,833
but when their eyes
are seared red by the sun,

2156
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,753
when their cracked lips
bleed with thirst,

2157
03:05:38,919 --> 03:05:41,217
when their stomachs cramp
with hunger,

2158
03:05:41,380 --> 03:05:44,304
they will curse
the name of Moses and his god.

2159
03:05:44,467 --> 03:05:49,143
Then I, Dathan, will lead them back
to Pharaoh and the brick pits.

2160
03:05:56,312 --> 03:05:58,280
There are so many-

2161
03:06:00,566 --> 03:06:02,166
So many.

2162
03:06:04,737 --> 03:06:08,708
How shall I find thy road
through the wilderness, Lord?

2163
03:06:10,242 --> 03:06:15,965
How shall I find water
in the desert for this multitude?

2164
03:06:21,545 --> 03:06:25,641
Moses, the people are assembled.

2165
03:06:27,885 --> 03:06:31,014
Then let us go forth
to the mountain of God,

2166
03:06:31,180 --> 03:06:34,354
that he may write his commandments
in our minds

2167
03:06:34,517 --> 03:06:36,940
and upon our hearts forever.

2168
03:06:37,103 --> 03:06:40,403
We march, praising his mighty name!

2169
03:06:41,649 --> 03:06:44,243
- What is the word, Joshua?
- The word is given!

2170
03:06:44,402 --> 03:06:46,496
Let the trumpets sound!

2171
03:06:53,828 --> 03:06:56,828
Hear, O Israel!

2172
03:06:57,206 --> 03:06:59,174
Remember this day,

2173
03:06:59,333 --> 03:07:04,635
when the strong hand of the Lord
leads you out of bondage!

2174
03:07:04,797 --> 03:07:12,197
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!

2175
03:07:56,849 --> 03:07:59,898
- Come on! Come on!
- Yes! Come on!

2176
03:08:00,060 --> 03:08:01,357
Joshua!

2177
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:04,820
Four hundred years in bondage,
and today he won't move!

2178
03:08:40,351 --> 03:08:43,446
The Lord is one!

2179
03:08:43,604 --> 03:08:46,404
Praise to God!

2180
03:08:46,607 --> 03:08:48,905
Thank thee, O Lord!

2181
03:09:01,121 --> 03:09:03,123
My litter can carry him.

2182
03:09:04,625 --> 03:09:07,754
I am poured out like water,

2183
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:09,718
my strength dried up

2184
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:13,305
into the dust... of death.

2185
03:09:13,467 --> 03:09:16,437
We shall plant your fig tree
in the new land.

2186
03:09:16,595 --> 03:09:18,472
Children shall eat of its fruit.

2187
03:09:21,725 --> 03:09:24,148
Do you hear that?
Do you hear that?!

2188
03:09:24,311 --> 03:09:26,655
You have a strong new son!

2189
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:54,346
And he brought forth the people
with joy and gladness.

2190
03:09:54,508 --> 03:09:56,510
He bore them out of Egypt

2191
03:09:56,677 --> 03:10:00,398
as an eagle bears its young
upon its wings.

2192
03:10:01,223 --> 03:10:05,444
But again,
Pharaoh 's heart was hardened.

2193
03:10:12,067 --> 03:10:15,196
How many more days and nights
will you pray?

2194
03:10:16,363 --> 03:10:18,365
Does he hear you?

2195
03:10:21,285 --> 03:10:23,788
Dread Lord of Darkness,

2196
03:10:23,954 --> 03:10:27,174
are you not greater
than the god of Moses?

2197
03:10:28,375 --> 03:10:32,050
I have raised my voice to you,
yet life

2198
03:10:32,212 --> 03:10:34,840
has not come to the body of my son.

2199
03:10:36,550 --> 03:10:40,646
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.

2200
03:10:40,804 --> 03:10:44,104
He's nothing but a piece of stone
with the head of a bird.

2201
03:10:44,266 --> 03:10:46,439
He will hear me.

2202
03:10:49,021 --> 03:10:50,568
I am Egypt.

2203
03:10:50,731 --> 03:10:51,931
Egypt?

2204
03:10:53,233 --> 03:10:55,076
You are nothing.

2205
03:10:56,278 --> 03:10:59,327
You let Moses kill my son.

2206
03:10:59,490 --> 03:11:02,243
No god can bring him back.

2207
03:11:04,078 --> 03:11:06,422
What have you done to Moses?

2208
03:11:06,580 --> 03:11:08,833
How did he die?

2209
03:11:09,708 --> 03:11:12,678
Did he cry for mercy
when you tortured him?

2210
03:11:14,088 --> 03:11:15,556
Bring me to his body!

2211
03:11:15,714 --> 03:11:18,763
I want to see it, Rameses!
I want to see it!

2212
03:11:18,926 --> 03:11:20,928
This is my son.

2213
03:11:23,097 --> 03:11:25,191
He would have been Pharaoh.

2214
03:11:26,308 --> 03:11:28,606
He would have ruled the world.

2215
03:11:29,603 --> 03:11:31,856
Who mourns him now?

2216
03:11:32,022 --> 03:11:37,404
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.

2217
03:11:38,821 --> 03:11:41,916
You will not see his body.

2218
03:11:42,074 --> 03:11:44,497
I drove him out of Egypt.

2219
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:49,419
I cannot fight the power of his god.

2220
03:11:50,874 --> 03:11:52,474
His god?

2221
03:11:53,293 --> 03:11:56,797
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god,

2222
03:11:56,964 --> 03:12:01,265
but you are not a god,
you are even less than a man.

2223
03:12:02,928 --> 03:12:04,896
Listen to me, Rameses,

2224
03:12:05,055 --> 03:12:10,437
you thought I was evil when I went
to Moses, and you were right.

2225
03:12:10,602 --> 03:12:13,105
Shall I tell you what happened,
Rameses?

2226
03:12:14,273 --> 03:12:18,449
He spurned me,
like a strumpet in the street.

2227
03:12:18,610 --> 03:12:23,036
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!

2228
03:12:23,907 --> 03:12:27,957
All that you wanted from me
he would not even take.

2229
03:12:31,498 --> 03:12:34,001
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?

2230
03:12:35,669 --> 03:12:37,763
Not the laughter of kings,

2231
03:12:37,921 --> 03:12:40,674
but the laughter of slaves
on the desert!

2232
03:12:44,053 --> 03:12:45,805
Laughter?

2233
03:12:48,057 --> 03:12:49,684
Laughter?

2234
03:12:53,979 --> 03:12:58,200
My son, I shall build your tomb
upon their crushed bodies!

2235
03:12:58,358 --> 03:13:02,704
If any escape me, their seed shall
be scattered and accursed forever!

2236
03:13:02,863 --> 03:13:05,707
My armor. War crown.

2237
03:13:05,866 --> 03:13:07,666
Laughter?

2238
03:13:07,868 --> 03:13:12,590
I will turn the laughter of these
slaves into wails of torment!

2239
03:13:12,748 --> 03:13:15,843
They shall remember the name of Moses,

2240
03:13:16,001 --> 03:13:19,221
only that he died
under my chariot wheels!

2241
03:13:21,215 --> 03:13:23,889
Kill him with your own hands.

2242
03:13:24,051 --> 03:13:27,772
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.

2243
03:13:27,930 --> 03:13:29,650
Assemble all the chariots
at the city gate.

2244
03:13:29,765 --> 03:13:32,985
- I obey!
- Nura and Thebes will draw my chariot.

2245
03:13:33,143 --> 03:13:36,067
I will bring you back
your temple treasure!

2246
03:14:08,303 --> 03:14:12,979
Bring it back to me
stained with his blood.

2247
03:14:13,142 --> 03:14:14,542
I will.

2248
03:14:17,187 --> 03:14:19,610
To mingle with your own!

2249
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:10,991
Nura, Thebes!

2250
03:15:15,579 --> 03:15:17,752
Guards salute!

2251
03:15:18,624 --> 03:15:19,624
Hail!

2252
03:15:25,714 --> 03:15:26,714
Hail!

2253
03:15:29,051 --> 03:15:31,270
Remember your first-born!

2254
03:15:32,512 --> 03:15:36,358
- Death to the slaves!
- Death to the slaves!

2255
03:15:36,516 --> 03:15:40,271
- Death to their god!
- Death to their god!

2256
03:15:40,437 --> 03:15:41,437
Hail!

2257
03:15:42,356 --> 03:15:43,956
Forward!

2258
03:16:40,706 --> 03:16:43,926
Do you hear thunder? Over the sea?

2259
03:16:45,294 --> 03:16:47,092
No, it comes from the desert.

2260
03:16:47,254 --> 03:16:49,632
That's the thunder of horses!

2261
03:16:49,798 --> 03:16:52,972
Look! Pharaoh's chariot!

2262
03:16:57,180 --> 03:17:01,105
We're trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!

2263
03:17:07,441 --> 03:17:08,841
Joshua?

2264
03:17:14,197 --> 03:17:15,870
That's Joshua's horn!

2265
03:17:16,033 --> 03:17:20,504
All men to the pass!
Get carts, wagons! Form a barrier!

2266
03:17:22,164 --> 03:17:24,132
- What's the alarm, Joshua?
- Pharaoh's chariot!

2267
03:17:24,291 --> 03:17:28,091
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!

2268
03:17:28,628 --> 03:17:32,883
- Bring shovels, pounders, mattocks!
- Hear me! Hear me!

2269
03:17:33,050 --> 03:17:35,223
Can mattocks stop arrows?

2270
03:17:35,385 --> 03:17:38,059
Will your little carts
stop Pharaoh's Chariots?

2271
03:17:38,221 --> 03:17:40,223
You women,
do you want to see your men killed?

2272
03:17:40,390 --> 03:17:42,484
- Moses!
- Joshua, what is it?

2273
03:17:42,642 --> 03:17:45,646
Pharaoh's chariots!
I've ordered men to block the pass!

2274
03:17:45,812 --> 03:17:48,361
- How can we fight chariots?
- Nothing can stop them!

2275
03:17:48,523 --> 03:17:50,867
Order the men to move back, Joshua.

2276
03:17:51,026 --> 03:17:53,700
Move back? Where? Into the sea?

2277
03:17:53,862 --> 03:17:55,580
Into the hand of God.

2278
03:17:55,739 --> 03:17:59,209
Deliverer?
Yes, he has delivered you to death!

2279
03:18:00,744 --> 03:18:02,544
Run! Run!

2280
03:18:02,913 --> 03:18:05,113
Look! Look!

2281
03:18:07,501 --> 03:18:11,347
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!

2282
03:18:11,505 --> 03:18:13,678
Stone him! Stone him!

2283
03:18:24,768 --> 03:18:28,022
The god of Moses is a poor general,

2284
03:18:28,188 --> 03:18:29,781
to leave him no retreat.

2285
03:18:36,154 --> 03:18:40,500
Ten times you have seen
the miracles of the Lord!

2286
03:18:40,659 --> 03:18:43,208
And still you have no faith!

2287
03:18:43,370 --> 03:18:46,214
He's a false prophet
who delivers you to death!

2288
03:18:46,373 --> 03:18:48,467
Stone him! Stone him!

2289
03:18:50,961 --> 03:18:54,556
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God's will!

2290
03:18:54,714 --> 03:18:56,216
Forward!

2291
03:19:02,514 --> 03:19:06,485
- They will stop for me!
- A charging chariot knows no rank.

2292
03:19:11,523 --> 03:19:13,571
Was it because
there were no graves in Egypt

2293
03:19:13,733 --> 03:19:15,906
that you took us away
to die in the wilderness?

2294
03:19:16,069 --> 03:19:17,537
Why must we die?

2295
03:19:18,905 --> 03:19:20,705
Fear not!

2296
03:19:21,032 --> 03:19:26,163
Stand still,
and see the salvation of the Lord!

2297
03:19:36,047 --> 03:19:39,768
- A pillar of fire!
- It is the work of God!

2298
03:19:51,688 --> 03:19:53,315
Through it!

2299
03:19:55,275 --> 03:19:58,905
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!

2300
03:20:08,830 --> 03:20:12,300
Gather your families and your flocks.
We must go with all speed.

2301
03:20:12,459 --> 03:20:15,633
Go where? To drown in the sea?

2302
03:20:15,795 --> 03:20:17,843
How long will the fire
hold Pharaoh back?

2303
03:20:18,006 --> 03:20:20,134
- Will it hold?
- After this day,

2304
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:22,519
you shall see his Chariots no more!

2305
03:20:22,677 --> 03:20:25,806
No! You'll be dead under them!

2306
03:20:27,140 --> 03:20:30,986
The Lord of Hosts
will do battle for us!

2307
03:20:34,606 --> 03:20:37,826
Behold his mighty hand!

2308
03:21:09,140 --> 03:21:11,313
The wind opens the sea!

2309
03:21:11,476 --> 03:21:15,197
God opens the sea
with the blast of his nostrils.

2310
03:21:19,985 --> 03:21:22,738
Lead them through
the midst of the waters.

2311
03:21:22,904 --> 03:21:24,702
His will be done!

2312
03:21:27,492 --> 03:21:32,248
He opens the waters before them,
and he bars our way with fire.

2313
03:21:32,414 --> 03:21:35,588
Let us go from this place.
Men cannot fight against a god!

2314
03:21:35,750 --> 03:21:38,549
Better to die in battle with a god,
than live in shame.

2315
03:21:38,712 --> 03:21:41,181
Praise God and down into it!

2316
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:26,219
God has delivered us
from the son of Pharaohs.

2317
03:22:26,384 --> 03:22:28,978
Jacob cherished

2318
03:22:29,137 --> 03:22:31,937
His son Joseph

2319
03:22:32,766 --> 03:22:37,112
Many colors was his coat

2320
03:22:38,146 --> 03:22:40,695
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!

2321
03:22:47,822 --> 03:22:50,450
Pull! Pull for your lives!

2322
03:22:50,617 --> 03:22:52,870
Is your life worth so much?

2323
03:22:58,124 --> 03:23:00,673
Jacob cherished

2324
03:23:00,835 --> 03:23:03,635
His son Joseph

2325
03:23:04,381 --> 03:23:09,181
Many colors was his coat

2326
03:23:11,513 --> 03:23:14,313
God of A 'Dram

2327
03:23:15,266 --> 03:23:17,666
Isaac, Jacob

2328
03:23:18,812 --> 03:23:24,212
Ever bless us with Thy hand

2329
03:23:41,084 --> 03:23:43,837
Get tow-lines on the midwife's cart!

2330
03:23:48,550 --> 03:23:50,769
Save the bread if you can!

2331
03:23:50,927 --> 03:23:55,478
Ben Caleb! Order all wagons
to turn clear!

2332
03:24:00,895 --> 03:24:05,275
Moses! Stand on the rock where
the people can see you and have hope!

2333
03:24:05,442 --> 03:24:07,240
Above us!

2334
03:24:07,402 --> 03:24:09,029
Help that wagon!

2335
03:24:30,300 --> 03:24:32,018
The fire dies!

2336
03:24:34,721 --> 03:24:36,439
Sound the pursuit!

2337
03:24:50,361 --> 03:24:52,489
Chariots, halt!

2338
03:24:56,409 --> 03:24:59,538
This is work for a butcher,
not a Pharaoh.

2339
03:25:00,580 --> 03:25:02,298
Destroy them all.

2340
03:25:02,957 --> 03:25:05,085
But bring Moses to me alive.

2341
03:25:05,251 --> 03:25:09,427
Level spears! Forward!

2342
03:25:43,206 --> 03:25:46,961
- Here! Take him!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

2343
03:26:05,478 --> 03:26:07,731
Grandfather, look,
the horses are coming!

2344
03:26:07,897 --> 03:26:11,697
The chariots! Run! Run!
Run for your lives!

2345
03:26:22,996 --> 03:26:25,670
Better to serve the Egyptians
than to die here!

2346
03:26:25,832 --> 03:26:29,632
Who shall withstand the power of God?

2347
03:27:22,555 --> 03:27:26,105
Thou didst blow with Thy winds,

2348
03:27:27,018 --> 03:27:29,521
and the sea covered them!

2349
03:27:31,356 --> 03:27:34,235
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?

2350
03:27:35,109 --> 03:27:38,409
From everlasting to everlasting,

2351
03:27:39,322 --> 03:27:41,416
Thou art God!

2352
03:27:41,574 --> 03:27:46,580
The Lord is one! The Lord is one!

2353
03:28:28,454 --> 03:28:31,003
Before you strike,

2354
03:28:31,165 --> 03:28:34,294
show me his blood on your sword.

2355
03:28:46,556 --> 03:28:49,730
You couldn't even kill him.

2356
03:28:51,394 --> 03:28:54,994
His god... is God.

2357
03:29:06,367 --> 03:29:09,496
And Moses led Israel
from the Red Sea

2358
03:29:09,662 --> 03:29:12,415
into the wilderness of Sinai.

2359
03:29:12,582 --> 03:29:15,586
And they camped
before the holy mountain.

2360
03:29:15,752 --> 03:29:18,471
And when the people saw
that Moses delayed

2361
03:29:18,629 --> 03:29:21,132
to come down out of the mountain,

2362
03:29:21,299 --> 03:29:23,848
they gathered themselves together.

2363
03:29:24,677 --> 03:29:29,353
Ask Aaron. Could anyone live on that
fiery summit for 40 days and 40 nights?

2364
03:29:29,515 --> 03:29:34,112
- Yes! By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?

2365
03:29:35,021 --> 03:29:37,621
Do you? Do I?

2366
03:29:38,691 --> 03:29:41,865
Or you, Sephora? His grieving wife.

2367
03:29:42,028 --> 03:29:44,122
She came back among us
to find her husband.

2368
03:29:44,280 --> 03:29:48,001
But he's dead.
Even she cannot hope that he lives!

2369
03:29:48,159 --> 03:29:52,460
Moses went up into the forbidden
ground to receive God's law!

2370
03:29:52,622 --> 03:29:55,250
Yes, but he's not returned!

2371
03:29:55,416 --> 03:29:59,466
We share your pain. We sympathize.

2372
03:29:59,629 --> 03:30:02,974
But will sympathy lead us to this
land flowing with milk and honey?

2373
03:30:03,132 --> 03:30:06,227
- Now, we have no leader!
- Don't be fooled!

2374
03:30:06,385 --> 03:30:08,808
Moses will return!

2375
03:30:10,181 --> 03:30:13,060
Would a God
who's shown you such wonders

2376
03:30:13,226 --> 03:30:15,820
let Moses die
before his work is done?

2377
03:30:15,978 --> 03:30:18,697
- His work is done.
- His mother!

2378
03:30:18,856 --> 03:30:22,281
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!

2379
03:30:22,443 --> 03:30:25,287
But there are other mothers among you!

2380
03:30:25,446 --> 03:30:27,744
What will become of your children?

2381
03:30:29,408 --> 03:30:33,083
- We must have faith!
- Faith in what? You, Aaron?

2382
03:30:33,913 --> 03:30:37,588
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
Do you know where it is?

2383
03:30:37,750 --> 03:30:38,922
- Tell us!
- Where is it?

2384
03:30:39,085 --> 03:30:40,257
Across the wilderness!

2385
03:30:40,419 --> 03:30:43,172
- Then who is to lead us?
- You, Dathan!

2386
03:30:46,843 --> 03:30:49,187
Where could I bring you,
except to Egypt?

2387
03:30:49,345 --> 03:30:52,440
- Where there is death?
- No! Where there is food!

2388
03:30:52,598 --> 03:30:56,853
- Pharaoh would kill us all.
- Not if a god of Egypt went before us!

2389
03:30:57,019 --> 03:30:58,582
- You could make one for us, Aaron.
- No.

2390
03:30:58,682 --> 03:31:00,447
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!

2391
03:31:00,606 --> 03:31:02,608
I will not!

2392
03:31:03,526 --> 03:31:05,324
He will not!

2393
03:31:05,486 --> 03:31:08,615
He would rather see our flesh rot
in the wilderness.

2394
03:31:09,699 --> 03:31:12,168
You will make a god for us!

2395
03:31:12,326 --> 03:31:15,921
A god of gold! A golden calf!

2396
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:21,628
Korah shall be the high priest!

2397
03:31:23,921 --> 03:31:28,142
Bring baskets! Buckets! Shawls!
Anything you have!

2398
03:31:28,301 --> 03:31:32,727
Break off your earrings,
your bracelets, your necklaces!

2399
03:31:32,889 --> 03:31:35,642
We will make of them a golden calf!

2400
03:31:36,893 --> 03:31:40,818
- The golden spoils we took from Egypt!
- There!

2401
03:31:52,491 --> 03:31:54,493
Spoils of Egypt!

2402
03:32:06,464 --> 03:32:08,683
From the burning bush, O Lord,

2403
03:32:08,841 --> 03:32:12,891
you charged me to bring the people
to this holy mountain,

2404
03:32:13,054 --> 03:32:16,479
to behold your glory
and receive your law.

2405
03:32:17,225 --> 03:32:19,728
What have I left undone?

2406
03:32:27,485 --> 03:32:28,685
Lam...

2407
03:32:31,697 --> 03:32:32,897
lam...

2408
03:32:35,576 --> 03:32:39,501
I am the Lord thy God.

2409
03:32:39,664 --> 03:32:44,340
Thou shalt have
no other gods before me.

2410
03:32:49,090 --> 03:32:54,312
Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image.

2411
03:33:06,399 --> 03:33:10,404
And they overlaid the image
with pure gold.

2412
03:33:10,569 --> 03:33:14,745
And Aaron fashioned it
and smoothed it with the hammer;

2413
03:33:14,907 --> 03:33:20,414
ready to be graven
by cunning art and man's device.

2414
03:33:20,579 --> 03:33:24,584
And he fastened it with nails
that it should not move.

2415
03:33:25,710 --> 03:33:28,213
And he that smote the anvil

2416
03:33:28,379 --> 03:33:32,179
did beat the molten gold
into thin plates.

2417
03:33:32,341 --> 03:33:36,346
For they had gathered their treasure
into the midst of the furnace,

2418
03:33:36,512 --> 03:33:39,607
and did blow the fire upon it
to melt it.

2419
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:45,606
And they adorned themselves
in rich apparel and costly array,

2420
03:33:45,771 --> 03:33:49,116
with veils of blue
and purple and scarlet,

2421
03:33:49,275 --> 03:33:52,620
and fine twined linen wrought in Egypt.

2422
03:33:52,778 --> 03:33:57,454
And the women tread grapes
from Midian into new wine.

2423
03:33:57,616 --> 03:34:00,244
Thou shall not take the name

2424
03:34:00,411 --> 03:34:04,541
of the Lord thy God in vain.

2425
03:34:08,085 --> 03:34:13,091
Remember the Sabbath day,
to keep it holy.

2426
03:34:17,803 --> 03:34:22,104
Honor thy father and thy mother:

2427
03:34:27,646 --> 03:34:30,570
Thou shalt not kill.

2428
03:34:43,496 --> 03:34:45,624
And the people sinned a great sin,

2429
03:34:46,749 --> 03:34:49,878
for they had made them a god of gold.

2430
03:34:50,044 --> 03:34:53,719
And they bore him upon their
shoulders and rejoiced,

2431
03:34:53,881 --> 03:34:57,511
saying, "This be our god, O Israel."

2432
03:34:57,676 --> 03:35:01,931
Are you mourners of Moses
afraid to face the new god of gold?

2433
03:35:02,098 --> 03:35:05,693
They were as children
who had lost their faith.

2434
03:35:05,851 --> 03:35:11,233
They were perverse and crooked
and rebellious against God.

2435
03:35:11,399 --> 03:35:13,868
They did eat the bread of wickedness,

2436
03:35:14,026 --> 03:35:16,495
and drank the wine of violence,

2437
03:35:16,654 --> 03:35:19,783
and they did evil
in the eyes of the Lord.

2438
03:35:19,949 --> 03:35:24,455
And the people cried,
"The graven image hath brought us joy, 

2439
03:35:24,620 --> 03:35:29,626
and they worshipped the golden calf
and sacrificed unto it.

2440
03:35:30,167 --> 03:35:32,841
Here is your sacrifice!

2441
03:35:37,508 --> 03:35:41,012
Make way!
Make way for the sacrifice!

2442
03:36:25,556 --> 03:36:29,356
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

2443
03:36:35,524 --> 03:36:38,778
Thou shalt not steal.

2444
03:36:43,115 --> 03:36:46,870
Thou shalt not bear false witness

2445
03:36:47,036 --> 03:36:49,459
against thy neighbor:

2446
03:36:52,708 --> 03:36:56,554
Thou shalt not covet anything

2447
03:36:56,712 --> 03:36:58,840
that is thy neighbor's.

2448
03:37:26,617 --> 03:37:30,167
Written with the finger of God.

2449
03:37:40,005 --> 03:37:43,605
Go! Get thee down,

2450
03:37:43,926 --> 03:37:48,352
for thy people
have corrupted themselves.

2451
03:38:07,575 --> 03:38:10,169
And the people rose up to play,

2452
03:38:10,327 --> 03:38:12,421
and did eat and drink.

2453
03:38:12,580 --> 03:38:15,049
They were as the children of fools

2454
03:38:15,207 --> 03:38:17,380
and cast off their clothes.

2455
03:38:17,543 --> 03:38:19,921
The wicked were like a troubled sea

2456
03:38:20,087 --> 03:38:23,261
whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

2457
03:38:23,424 --> 03:38:25,677
They sank from evil to evil

2458
03:38:25,843 --> 03:38:28,096
and were viler than the earth.

2459
03:38:28,262 --> 03:38:30,731
And there was rioting and drunkenness,

2460
03:38:30,889 --> 03:38:33,358
for they had become servants of sin.

2461
03:38:33,517 --> 03:38:38,774
There was manifest all manner of
ungodliness and works of the flesh.

2462
03:38:38,939 --> 03:38:41,943
Even adultery and lasciviousness,

2463
03:38:42,109 --> 03:38:45,363
uncleanness, idolatry and rioting,

2464
03:38:45,529 --> 03:38:47,156
vanity and wrath.

2465
03:38:47,323 --> 03:38:51,920
And they were filled
with iniquity and vile affections.

2466
03:38:52,077 --> 03:38:56,423
And Aaron knew
that he had brought them to shame.

2467
03:39:00,252 --> 03:39:04,507
Abiram! Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!

2468
03:39:04,673 --> 03:39:07,222
Even unto the horns of the altar!

2469
03:39:36,830 --> 03:39:40,084
The light of God
shines from you, Moses.

2470
03:39:41,126 --> 03:39:44,300
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.

2471
03:39:44,463 --> 03:39:47,307
These tablets of stone...

2472
03:39:47,466 --> 03:39:49,309
The writing of God.

2473
03:39:50,678 --> 03:39:53,056
His Ten Commandments.

2474
03:39:58,227 --> 03:40:01,197
There is a noise of war in the camp.

2475
03:40:01,355 --> 03:40:04,154
It is not the noise of war.

2476
03:40:04,316 --> 03:40:07,286
It is the noise of song and revelry.

2477
03:40:39,685 --> 03:40:42,529
- Moses!
- Look!

2478
03:40:43,856 --> 03:40:44,903
Joshua!

2479
03:40:45,524 --> 03:40:48,994
Woe unto thee, O Israel.

2480
03:40:49,153 --> 03:40:53,374
You have sinned a great sin
in the sight of God!

2481
03:40:54,283 --> 03:40:59,005
You are not worthy
to receive these Ten Commandments.

2482
03:40:59,163 --> 03:41:00,210
Aaron!

2483
03:41:10,340 --> 03:41:12,718
We are gathered against you, Moses!

2484
03:41:12,885 --> 03:41:15,729
You take too much upon yourself!

2485
03:41:15,888 --> 03:41:19,233
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!

2486
03:41:19,391 --> 03:41:22,895
There is no freedom without the law.

2487
03:41:23,061 --> 03:41:25,029
Whose law, Moses? Yours?

2488
03:41:25,189 --> 03:41:28,614
Did you carve those tablets
to become a prince over us?

2489
03:41:30,444 --> 03:41:33,994
Who is on the Lord's side,

2490
03:41:34,156 --> 03:41:38,036
- let him come to me!
- I am!

2491
03:41:45,417 --> 03:41:46,617
Moses!

2492
03:41:49,797 --> 03:41:52,641
- You have cursed us.
- Dathan and the people made me do it.

2493
03:41:54,676 --> 03:41:57,676
Joshua! Joshua!

2494
03:42:03,393 --> 03:42:08,069
He showed you no land flowing with milk
and honey! I show you a god of gold!

2495
03:42:08,232 --> 03:42:10,234
Come with me! Follow me!

2496
03:42:10,400 --> 03:42:13,404
Blasphemers! Idolaters!

2497
03:42:13,570 --> 03:42:18,121
For this you shall drink bitter waters!

2498
03:42:18,867 --> 03:42:21,620
God has set before you this day

2499
03:42:21,787 --> 03:42:25,462
his laws of life and good

2500
03:42:25,624 --> 03:42:28,753
and death and evil.

2501
03:42:30,087 --> 03:42:33,967
Those who will not live by the law...

2502
03:42:35,425 --> 03:42:38,429
...shall die by the law!

2503
03:43:05,998 --> 03:43:09,502
And the Lord's anger
was kindled against Israel.

2504
03:43:09,668 --> 03:43:13,343
And to prove whether they
would keep his commandments or no,

2505
03:43:13,505 --> 03:43:18,477
he made them wander
in the wilderness 40 years,

2506
03:43:18,635 --> 03:43:22,685
until all the generation that had done
evil in the sight of the Lord

2507
03:43:22,848 --> 03:43:25,351
was consumed.

2508
03:43:25,517 --> 03:43:30,694
But Moses' eye was not dim,
nor his natural force abated.

2509
03:43:31,523 --> 03:43:35,448
And he went up from the plains
of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,

2510
03:43:35,611 --> 03:43:38,114
and the Lord showed him all the land

2511
03:43:38,280 --> 03:43:42,035
that was beyond the river Jordan.

2512
03:43:42,200 --> 03:43:43,747
The Lord was angry with me

2513
03:43:43,911 --> 03:43:47,711
because I disobeyed him
by the waters of strife.

2514
03:43:47,873 --> 03:43:52,549
And he said unto me,
"Behold the new land with thine eyes.

2515
03:43:52,711 --> 03:43:56,636
For thou shalt not cross
over this river Jordan."

2516
03:43:56,798 --> 03:43:59,176
Then I shall stay.

2517
03:43:59,343 --> 03:44:04,144
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.

2518
03:44:04,306 --> 03:44:06,308
Look, Moses.

2519
03:44:06,475 --> 03:44:09,354
The people have come
to the river Jordan.

2520
03:44:10,896 --> 03:44:14,275
In the Ark, they carry
the law you brought them.

2521
03:44:15,275 --> 03:44:19,075
You taught them
not to live by bread alone.

2522
03:44:19,237 --> 03:44:24,084
You are God's torch,
that lights the way to freedom.

2523
03:44:26,745 --> 03:44:28,463
I love you.

2524
03:44:32,459 --> 03:44:34,006
Joshua...

2525
03:44:45,222 --> 03:44:49,443
Joshua,
I charge you and strengthen you,

2526
03:44:49,601 --> 03:44:53,401
for you shall go over Jordan
to lead the people.

2527
03:44:55,691 --> 03:44:59,741
As for me and my house,
we shall serve the Lord.

2528
03:45:01,488 --> 03:45:04,617
Mered, give me the books.

2529
03:45:05,784 --> 03:45:10,756
Eleazar, set these five books

2530
03:45:10,914 --> 03:45:12,461
in the Ark of the Covenant,

2531
03:45:12,624 --> 03:45:15,218
by the tablets
of the Ten Commandments,

2532
03:45:15,377 --> 03:45:18,130
which the Lord restored unto us.

2533
03:45:32,310 --> 03:45:33,310
Go.

2534
03:45:34,312 --> 03:45:37,691
Proclaim liberty
throughout all the lands,

2535
03:45:37,858 --> 03:45:41,158
unto all the inhabitants thereof.
