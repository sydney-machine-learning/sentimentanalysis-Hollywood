1
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:44,446
Paper! Paper!

2
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:49,786
Lucky Lindy makes it!
Extry! Read all about it.

3
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:52,985
Officer, excuse me. Could you tell me
how I get to the Central Park Casino?

4
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,222
You can't miss it.
It's just behind the mall.

5
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,199
- Thank you.
- And only with two ham sandwiches.

6
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:03,402
Lucky! Lucky!
Read all about it.

7
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,405
Lucky Lindy makes it!

8
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:22,784
<i>Ain't she sweet
See her walkin'down the street</i>

9
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,155
<i>Now I ask you very confidentially</i>

10
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:29,128
<i>Ain't she sweet
Ain't she nice</i>

11
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:31,256
<i>Look her over once or twice</i>

12
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:35,098
<i>Now I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she nice</i>

13
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>Just cast an eye in her direction</i>

14
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,300
<i>Oh, me, oh, my
Ain't that perfection</i>

15
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:48,281
<i>I repeat
Don't you think that's kind of neat</i>

16
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,783
<i>Now, I ask you very confidentially</i>

17
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,605
Good afternoon, Miss Oelrichs.

18
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,834
I'll just be a few minutes.

19
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,077
Say, this must belong to
somebody important, huh?

20
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:23,112
I rode in one once.

21
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,176
A fella I knew up in college
in Boston had an uncle.

22
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:28,188
Of course, it wasn't in
quite as good shape as this.

23
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:30,952
It had two or three
bullet holes in it.

24
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,858
He bought it from
a bootlegger's widow.

25
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:36,556
They're good cars, though, aren't they?
Excuse me.

26
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:17,194
A gold key.
What's it for?

27
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,705
What's a key for?

28
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:22,208
Opens a door, doesn't it?

29
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:33,448
Philip. Philip, will you come
in here a moment, please?

30
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:35,955
Eduard.

31
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:41,627
Puts me between Colonel Rutherford
and Prince Kaminsky...

32
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,028
the two greatest bores in New York.

33
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,658
Philip, I think that we'll exile
the prince to the end of the table.

34
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:48,668
- Yes, Miss Oelrichs.
-Just put the flowers--

35
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:51,534
- Yes, what is it?
- I was looking for Mr. Leo Reisman.

36
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,836
- I'm going to be in his orchestra.
- Back of the bandstand.

37
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:56,308
-Thank you very much.
-Next time, use the musicians' entrance.

38
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,971
Right, the musician's entrance.
I'll find it. Thank you.

39
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,617
Mr. Reisman's office?

40
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:07,984
Mr. Reisman?

41
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:10,990
Oh, thank you.

42
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,330
- Something?
- Hello, Mr. Sherwood.

43
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,592
- Hello.
- Oh, Mr. Reisman.

44
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,499
- Yeah?
- Remember me? Eddy Duchin.

45
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,333
I remember you.
The Berkshires, that resort.

46
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:27,033
You remember, Leo. Last summer?
We were lost. It was raining.

47
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:30,771
- Berkshires?
- Oh, yes, of course. Sure. Come in.

48
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,745
Gee, you had me scared for a minute.
I thought maybe you had--

49
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,510
No. I remember you.
You lent me your raincoat.

50
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,211
-I almost forgot to give it back to you.
-I played the piano.

51
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:40,652
- That's right. A lot of piano.
- Yes, Philip.

52
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,155
That was some orchestra
you were hooked up with.

53
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:45,920
Nobody's got a right to be that bad,
not even for money.

54
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:48,860
They were just a group of college kids
picking up money for school.

55
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,524
- They weren't professionals.
- What are you doing here?

56
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,157
Empty the pockets, will you, Lou?

57
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:55,327
- Huh?
- In New York.

58
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,031
- I came down from Boston when--
-Jimmy Walker's coming in tonight.

59
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:01,006
- Great. Swell.
- The mayor?

60
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:04,602
This is his favorite spot.
You don't know the casino, do you?

61
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,374
It's the playground
of high society.

62
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,348
This was given to Mr. Reisman
by Mrs. Vanderbilt.

63
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,975
He played at her daughter's
coming-out party.

64
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,316
- Yes, I know--
- Money clip was given to Mr. Reisman--

65
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,116
Stop sounding like an auctioneer.

66
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,750
You'll make Duchin want to quit college
and be a musician.

67
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:21,090
- That's exactly what I--
- What school do you go to?

68
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,891
Well, I graduated, remember?
I told you.

69
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,625
The Massachusetts School
of Pharmacy.

70
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,724
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
I remember.

71
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,497
So you're gonna be a druggist.
Here in New York?

72
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,630
A lot of money in drugstores
if you can make a good hot fudge sundae.

73
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,265
I'm not going to be a druggist.

74
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:38,802
I've decided to take advantage
of Mr. Reisman's offer instead.

75
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
-My offer?
-Sure. To play the piano with your band.

76
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,283
That's why I'm here.

77
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:45,478
I didn't offer you a job.

78
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,215
- What?
- I didn't offer you a job.

79
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,416
I remember saying I liked
the way you play the piano...

80
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,924
but I certainly didn't
offer you a job.

81
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,392
Yeah, but you said a lot
of other things too.

82
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:54,985
- You told me to come to New York.
- No, no, no.

83
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:59,158
What Mr. Reisman said was, if you got
to New York, stop by and say hello.

84
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,327
He also told me I had the most
distinctive style he'd heard in years.

85
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,337
I've got a piano player.
I've had him for years.

86
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,805
But I'm here.
I can't go back.

87
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,307
Why not?

88
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,955
No. I-- I can't go home.

89
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:24,116
It was tough enough to leave.

90
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,284
They didn't want you to go?

91
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:35,133
Mr. Reisman, when a man owns
a small tailor shop...

92
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:39,468
and presses pants for a living
and works like a dog...

93
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,873
so that his son can have
an education and get ahead...

94
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,140
it isn't easy
to give up the dream.

95
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:50,206
It wasn't their idea that I should
live the crazy life of a musician...

96
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,514
but I should stay at home
and become a druggist...

97
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,645
and a respected member
of the community.

98
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:57,691
- There's nothing the matter with that.
- But it isn't what I want.

99
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:03,495
No, I can't go back.
I've made the break.

100
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:06,362
Eddy, maybe your father was right.

101
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:18,066
You keep in touch. Now, be sure.
I'm sorry, Eddy.

102
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:24,982
Good-bye and good luck.

103
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,222
He wishes us good luck.

104
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,885
He can play. He's got a very
distinctive personal style.

105
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,894
He won't get lost.

106
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,516
I like it.
What is it ? Chopin?

107
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,993
- Yes.
- Which one?

108
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,496
'' E-flat.''

109
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,702
Please play it again.

110
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,906
I didn't think that Mr. Reisman
went in for rude musicians.

111
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,538
- I'm not with Reisman.
- But I heard you say before--

112
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,707
I'm not with Mr. Reisman at all.

113
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,876
There was no job to get.

114
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,956
I only dreamed of working here.

115
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,160
A crazy dream...

116
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:19,461
of driving back home
in a red Stutz Bearcat...

117
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:22,866
walking into the house and throwing
down a bankroll as big as the Ritz...

118
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,896
and saying, '' No more work, Pop.
I'm rich. I'm famous.''

119
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,143
- Where do you come from?
- Boston.

120
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,204
I'm gonna knock this town
on its ear once I get started.

121
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,115
I don't mean only New York.
You don't believe me, do you?

122
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:40,119
Of course I believe you.

123
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,382
What do you intend to do
in the meantime?

124
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,983
- Get a job in a drugstore.
- Playing the piano?

125
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,028
No, I'm a druggist.

126
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:50,120
My prof at the Massachusetts
School of Pharmacy...

127
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:54,258
he used to play the ukulele, so
the two of us, we'd get together and--

128
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:59,872
- Maybe I talk too much, huh?
- Maybe.

129
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,908
Lou, be sure to get the arrangements
for '' Lucky Lindy.''

130
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,773
We're gonna have a lot
of requests for that tune.

131
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,506
- He's captured the world's imagination.
- Play some more. Go on, play.

132
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,481
- Mr. Reisman.
- Good evening, Miss Oelrichs.

133
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,079
Leo, I want you to do
something for me.

134
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,053
Some special numbers you
want me to play tonight?

135
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,554
No, it's something else.

136
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,716
We'll keep your music going tonight
without intermission.

137
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,259
Oh, my dear, I can't.

138
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,490
But you can if you hire
an extra piano player.

139
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,931
Did you have anyone
special in mind?

140
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,402
You know very well I had
someone special in mind.

141
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,599
- If he's not good enough--
- He's good enough.

142
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,972
- Then you'll do it?
- Yes.

143
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,238
You're an angel.

144
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,906
Go see Mr. Reisman.
You've got a job.

145
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,915
- I'm late.
- What?

146
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,417
Ajob.

147
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,256
I beg your pardon, miss.
What did you say?

148
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:52,417
Be sure you play well.

149
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:57,862
- Thank you, Miss--
- Oelrichs. Marjorie Oelrichs.

150
00:10:57,932 --> 00:10:59,991
Thank you, Miss Oelrichs.

151
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:02,763
Say, druggist, do you have
a prescription for a tuxedo?

152
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,814
Is it time?

153
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,147
Give me a hand here, will you?

154
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,285
Thank you.

155
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,124
No, no.

156
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,290
Oh, I can button it.

157
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,369
How much longer?

158
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:42,208
Okay, ready now? Good.

159
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:47,038
Oh, you want me to sit.

160
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,317
Thanks, Mr. Sherwood.

161
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,865
- All right, kid, you're on.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,633
- Oh, and, Eddy--
- Yes, sir?

163
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:49,540
Remember, this is just
intermission music. Play soft.

164
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,010
We don't want to disturb
their eating and drinking.

165
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,912
- Yes, sir.
- Well, go ahead. You're on, you're on.

166
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,145
Treat the tuxedo gently, will you?
It's an old friend.

167
00:13:57,578 --> 00:13:59,808
Uncle Sherm, want to dance again?

168
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,781
- Let's. Come on.
- Don't you ever get tired? All right.

169
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:17,658
Joan, Harry. Come on, dance.
Come on.

170
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:31,107
It's the first time they've
ever danced to just a piano.

171
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:35,308
- Maybe I'd better sell my fiddle.
- Maybe you'd better.

172
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,744
Say, there's Jimmy Walker.
Call the boys.

173
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,955
Wait a minute.
What did I do wrong?

174
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:53,966
His Honor the mayor is coming in.

175
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,467
Jimmy Walker?

176
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:01,898
<i>They'll be running in
that good, old-fashioned way</i>

177
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,442
<i>Though my hair be old and gray</i>

178
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,535
Get off the stage.

179
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:08,547
- That's Jimmy Walker!
- Yes, I know. Get off the stage.

180
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,549
<i>As they do in May</i>

181
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,551
<i>They'll be running in December</i>

182
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:15,315
<i>As they do in May</i>

183
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,847
<i>They'll be running in
that good, old-fashioned way</i>

184
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:20,791
<i>When my hair is old and gray</i>

185
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:25,256
That's a great number.
The mayor wrote it, you know.

186
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:27,266
Yes, I know.

187
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,382
Hello again.

188
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,792
Miss--

189
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,327
This is the weirdest set of books
I have ever looked at.

190
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:07,896
I'm a decorator, not a bookkeeper.
Honestly!

191
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:11,103
What good is it to have one of the great
bankers of the world for an uncle...

192
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,509
when he can't even
balance my books?

193
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:16,276
Sherman, perhaps you are
being a little unreasonable.

194
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,580
- She's no child.
- Walter.

195
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:21,348
- Make sure it's ready by Tuesday.
- Yes, Miss Oelrichs.

196
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,788
Just put it down, please.
Do I have to sign for it?

197
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,792
No.

198
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,762
Well, hello.
Is that for me?

199
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:33,095
- Yes.
- How nice.

200
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,867
This is Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth.
This is Mr. Duchin.

201
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,803
He played the piano
at the casino last night.

202
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,103
- How do you do?
- Oh, yes, I remember.

203
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,336
- We enjoyed the music very much.
- Thank you.

204
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,572
Marjorie, for the last time,
will you please shut up shop...

205
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,774
and come down to Southampton
for the weekend?

206
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,441
I told you I have work to do.

207
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:52,712
I wish we'd never let you
open this place.

208
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:54,720
- Aunt Edith--
- You've missed everything--

209
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:58,656
- Europe, Palm Beach--
- I know, dear, but look.

210
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,989
Look at the wonderful
jobs that I did.

211
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,462
Edith, you can't argue with success.
Good-bye, dear.

212
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,965
Good-bye, darling,
and don't work too hard.

213
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,695
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

214
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,202
Let her live her own life.

215
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,433
It would have been so nice
to have her down for the weekend.

216
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:16,908
- Relatives.
- Yes. My aunt and uncle.

217
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,036
They brought me up,
and I love them dearly.

218
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:22,343
Here, would you fill this, please?
The fountain.

219
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,317
They can't understand why I work.

220
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,319
Why do you work?

221
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:32,719
- Why do you play the piano?
- You don't have to make a living.

222
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:35,489
I have to have a reason for living.

223
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,723
Just having money doesn't do it.

224
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,995
Oh? I thought it did.

225
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:45,437
No. Because then you're
dependent on money.

226
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:46,631
Huh?

227
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:50,108
Then you're dependent on money,
not yourself.

228
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:54,546
Oh. Well, I can't lie.

229
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,277
I hope money comes
right up and bites me.

230
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,987
I never met anyone like you.

231
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:04,888
I read all the Horatio Alger
stories when I was a child.

232
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,160
Sink or swim, do or die.

233
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:10,389
But I've never
actually known anyone...

234
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,228
who came to New York
to seek fame and fortune.

235
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,530
Do you think I'll make it?

236
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:18,469
I think you'll make it
because you're productive.

237
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,166
I like productive people.

238
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,801
I wish I were part of that royalty.

239
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,073
I only play the piano.

240
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,082
And you produce happiness.

241
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,715
That's nice.
I'll remember that.

242
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,085
Oh, Mr. Sherwood!
I hope I'm not late.

243
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,596
No. You made it just in time.

244
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,826
I rushed over as soon
as I got your message.

245
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,834
Mr. Reisman really
told you to call me?

246
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,995
- I've got the job?
- Please, they're playing.

247
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:53,335
- Oh, now?
- No. Between the sets.

248
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,875
- Intermission piano.
- I see. Intermission. Yeah.

249
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,877
Another reason I was late was
I had to rush out and rent a tuxedo.

250
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,640
I hope it fits.
The man told me that it does.

251
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,375
- Does it look all right?
-Just fine.

252
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:06,180
- Oh, good.
- Eddy. Eddy, you're on.

253
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,084
- Now?
- Wait. Please calm down.

254
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:11,249
Just settle down. Get--

255
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,289
He'd be a great guy to send out
for a cup of coffee.

256
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,256
Eddy, we thought we'd lost you.

257
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,325
- Now remember. Soft.
- Gee, thanks, Mr. Reisman.

258
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,998
- Good afternoon, Mr. Duchin.
- Good afternoon.

259
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,299
Well, how do you like it, Lou?

260
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:09,342
Don't tell me you bought it just because
you're going to a classy party.

261
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:12,640
- Yep.
- What did you pay for it?

262
00:21:12,712 --> 00:21:16,204
- Well, it's secondhand.
- How much?

263
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:19,650
- It belonged to one of the Vanderbilts.
- Oh, high class.

264
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:22,882
Tell me, when it backfires
does it say, '' Excuse me''?

265
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:31,558
- How do I look?
- Like a secondhand Vanderbuilt.

266
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,064
Wait.

267
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:39,099
I could've booked you for two cocktail
parties today-- a very fancy fee.

268
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,663
This was a personal invitation
from Mrs. Wadsworth.

269
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:44,107
I'm invited for myself this time.
I don't have to play.

270
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,111
- I'm a guest.
- All right, fine.

271
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,374
- Good-bye.
- Have a good time.

272
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:17,702
- There's Eddy Duchin.
- Hello, Eddy!

273
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:22,444
- Are you going to play today?
- No. I'm a gue-- No, not today.

274
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,540
- Oh, that's a shame.
- I'm so disappointed.

275
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:27,018
The casino is so much more lively
now that he's there.

276
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,959
Hey, look out!

277
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,961
Take it easy.

278
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:46,397
Oh, hello. My car.

279
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,118
- Hello, Mr. Duchin.
- Mr. Wadsworth.

280
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:10,389
- Nice to have you with us.
- Thank you.

281
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,206
Thank you.

282
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:28,305
Thank you.

283
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:33,113
Miss Oelrichs.

284
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:36,280
- Hello.
- It's awfully nice to see you.

285
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:37,914
I didn't know you were
going to be here.

286
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,289
Your aunt invited me.
You live here with them, don't you?

287
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,261
- Yes, I do.
- Then I'm your guest too.

288
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,231
- I'm having a wonderful time.
- Good. I'm glad.

289
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,961
I read that you were away at Sands Point
doing the Whitney house.

290
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,969
It was a very interesting job.

291
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:55,133
Since I last saw you, I guess you
don't know the whole sky fell in on me.

292
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,802
- Oh, really?
- I made some records with Reisman...

293
00:23:57,877 --> 00:24:00,368
and I've been playing some
wonderful private parties too.

294
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:03,473
Can you imagine? Last week, I played
a party at the Waldorf-Astoria...

295
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,281
and the Prince of Wales was sitting
right beside the piano, and--

296
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,649
Oh, I guess I still
talk too much, don't I?

297
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,455
You know, this is
a new experience for me...

298
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:22,057
being a guest instead of
a paid entertainer.

299
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,865
- I love it.
- Marjorie, come here.

300
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,371
Excuse me a moment, please.

301
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,772
Linus Larrabie has the most fabulous
idea for a party-- undersea.

302
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,437
- We're all going to wear fishnets.
- Thank you.

303
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,381
-Just imagine-- nothing but fishnets.
- Thank you very much.

304
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,613
Edith, did you make it
clear to Mr. Duchin...

305
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,554
that he was engaged
to play the piano?

306
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:45,352
I thought I did. Why?

307
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:47,825
You'd better speak to him, dear.
He's not playing.

308
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:50,419
Don't you think
it'd be better if you did?

309
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:53,989
- You hired him.
- All right.

310
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,831
Mrs. Wadsworth.
I'm having a wonderful time.

311
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,250
Aunt Edith, why did you
ask Mr. Duchin to play?

312
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:54,259
But he was hired to play.
That's why he's here.

313
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:57,091
- But he thought he was a guest.
- Oh, nonsense.

314
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:58,721
That's his business,
playing the piano.

315
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,575
Well, I certainly made a fool
of myself, didn't I?

316
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:15,707
Eddy Duchin in high society.

317
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,717
The simple fact is that
I'm a presumptuous, conceited fathead...

318
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:24,485
who thought he'd be invited to a party
for his grace and charm.

319
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:29,628
I remember once when
I was a little girl.

320
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:33,962
I went to a lawn party
and had a lovely new dress.

321
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:36,092
It rained that morning...

322
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,003
and I ran from the house
to show myself off to the guests.

323
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:43,338
Well, I slipped,
and I fell in a mud puddle.

324
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,867
I still remember
how they all laughed.

325
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:49,642
I lay there wanting to die.

326
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:52,912
You don't.

327
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,513
And as you grow up, there's always
another beautiful dress...

328
00:26:56,589 --> 00:27:01,549
and another mud puddle,
and still you don't die.

329
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:05,758
- You grow up.
- And learn to know your place.

330
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,233
What is your place?
Right now, it's beside me.

331
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:13,295
That's not so bad, is it?

332
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,664
Ladies and gentlemen,
in answer to your many requests...

333
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:57,862
here is Eddy Duchin at the piano
and '' Dizzy Fingers.''

334
00:31:58,257 --> 00:31:59,690
Bravo!

335
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,203
- You must be very happy about Eddy.
- Oh, yes.

336
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:14,501
He's a wonderful boy.

337
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:19,011
- Tell me, you sing with the orchestra?
- No, she's one of New York's--

338
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:22,707
- An interior decorator.
- You've known our Eddy a long time?

339
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:26,218
Almost as long as he's
been in New York, I'd say.

340
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:35,420
You're looking at me in a strange way,
Mrs. Duchin. Why?

341
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:40,497
Because I think you like our Eddy.
Hmm?

342
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:48,398
But one question remains, and,
by no means, an unimportant one.

343
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:50,408
Does Eddy like you?

344
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,872
Now, don't you think that
Eddy should answer that?

345
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:58,383
Yeah. But I wouldn't
have the nerve to ask him.

346
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,756
Oh, I'm glad the music stopped.
I was getting a headache.

347
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,593
- Eddy! Eddy, you were so wonderful.
- Congratulations!

348
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,096
Hello. Thank you, Lou.

349
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:14,394
- We are so proud of you.
- Thank you.

350
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:19,262
How are you getting along
with these old friends of mine?

351
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:23,934
- I hope they don't send me away.
- Is it like this every night here?

352
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:27,306
A party all the time.

353
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:30,707
Oh, Mom, I have everything.

354
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:34,150
He who has everything always
wants a little bit more.

355
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,917
Yeah, a Romanian proverb
she made up this morning.

356
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:42,787
Listen, could I make
a quiet little speech?

357
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,693
Go ahead.

358
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:48,359
Mom and Dad, you've always
been my dearest loves.

359
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:53,337
Sacrifice and hard work
so that I could get ahead.

360
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,843
You know what you
both mean to me and--

361
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,368
and how grateful I am for
everything you've done...

362
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:04,939
for more reasons than you know.

363
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:08,544
One of the reasons is me.

364
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:11,215
Well, don't you want to marry me?

365
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,951
Yes, but I haven't asked you.

366
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:16,692
How do you like that?

367
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:19,595
Believe me,
it was the same with us.

368
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:22,793
The men in the Duchin family
do not like to ask for something...

369
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:25,268
until they are sure
they can have it.

370
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,465
That works, Eddy, huh?

371
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,474
It sure works.

372
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,870
Well, to make it official--

373
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:38,280
and in front of
my mother and father--

374
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:40,285
will you marry me?

375
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:50,028
- Mazel tov!
- Oh, Mama.

376
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:53,597
Mazel tov.

377
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:55,929
Mazel tov.

378
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:58,971
Now, hold it, Mr. and Mrs. Duchin.
Now steady. Steady.

379
00:34:59,038 --> 00:35:02,371
Now just one more, please.
Just one more. Hold it. That's it.

380
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,864
Look at the cake.

381
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,041
- To our home.
- Our home.

382
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,113
You know, I bet all our friends
must think that we--

383
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:55,087
Oh, look. Come here.

384
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,526
A gold key.

385
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:04,569
Well, goodness.
What's it for?

386
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:07,204
For you...

387
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:10,675
to our front door.

388
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:25,319
- Cold? What's the matter?
- Oh, it's nothing.

389
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,484
Just the wind.
I don't like the wind.

390
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,961
- Why?
- Oh, no reason. See the casino?

391
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,964
This is the first night
in two years...

392
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:35,159
that I haven't played
at the casino.

393
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,828
Sometimes I think you love
the casino more than you do me.

394
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:42,397
Oh, no, but with you.
You're all mixed up with it.

395
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:46,434
That's good. I like being mixed up
with the things you love.

396
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:48,946
I knew exactly what I wanted,
and I got it.

397
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:51,278
All of it, even you.

398
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,114
I was a cinch.

399
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:56,711
You're all of it, really.

400
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,950
But I am the best of it--

401
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:02,084
I and that deep,
God-given talent of yours.

402
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:05,426
None of the rest of it really counts,
darling. You understand that?

403
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:09,559
Because if it were all to disappear
tomorrow, it wouldn't really matter.

404
00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:12,604
Not as long as you have me,
and I'm not quite that important.

405
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:15,504
You're the most important thing
in the world.

406
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:18,065
I hope so, darling.
I hope so.

407
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:21,671
The things I want now, I want for you.
Don't you understand that?

408
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:23,840
I'd like to buy you a diamond
as big as the Ritz.

409
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,384
Oh, Eddy, no.
No, darling.

410
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,012
No, not the things you can buy me.

411
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:32,387
Just you, the things
you can give me of you.

412
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,392
Everything you want.

413
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,123
It all comes so easy for you.
It scares me a little.

414
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:40,722
Well, remember Horatio Alger?

415
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,462
Don't you know about '' Eddy's luck''?
I have it.

416
00:37:43,536 --> 00:37:48,439
I'll always have it-- a very special
angel who watches over me and mine.

417
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:50,771
You talk like I'm one
of those statues in the park.

418
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:52,276
You are.

419
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:56,144
You're my own statue
in my own personal park.

420
00:37:57,716 --> 00:38:00,480
Darling, do you realize that you've
never danced with me to my music?

421
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:02,487
Well, I've always wished I could.

422
00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:04,887
A little difficult on
the piano bench, Mrs. Duchin.

423
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:09,394
Say that again.
Say '' Mrs. Duchin'' again.

424
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,395
Come inside with me, Mrs. Duchin...

425
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,795
and let me demonstrate through
the miracle of science, Mrs. Duchin...

426
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:17,199
how one man can be in two places
at the same time.

427
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,074
I never realized
you could step like a dream.

428
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:34,412
Oh, Eddy.
Eddy, my darling.

429
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,414
I love you.

430
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:50,152
Oh, I love you, Mrs. D.

431
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,200
I love your hands.

432
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,898
Not just for the sweet
music they make, but--

433
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:07,412
but physically, they--

434
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,743
they excite me
just to look at them.

435
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:14,849
Did you know that I fell in love
with your hands...

436
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,888
before I fell in love with you?

437
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,387
Well, now look who's
talking too much.

438
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:26,656
Really a storm kicking up.

439
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:39,843
Marjorie, what is it?
What's wrong?

440
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:41,937
- It's nothing.
- Nothing? What do you mean nothing?

441
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:44,448
- Tell me, what is it?
- No.

442
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:46,450
Please.
Please tell me.

443
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:50,655
Wind frightens me.

444
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:52,657
Oh, Eddy. The wind!

445
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:56,821
Why? Why?

446
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,464
A dream I had...

447
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:02,762
and I can't seem to fight it off.

448
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,736
Darling, darling.
Try to forget it.

449
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:11,174
I try. I try.
I tell myself it's only a dream, but--

450
00:41:12,244 --> 00:41:14,337
but it keeps coming back.

451
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:19,147
The wind blows between us, and I--

452
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:22,051
I keep trying to reach for you,
but you're gone.

453
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:25,181
Oh, it won't be like that.

454
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:28,852
I know.
I shouldn't have told you.

455
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:30,861
Oh, darling, darling.

456
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:33,363
Now, I'm here.
It's only a dream.

457
00:41:33,432 --> 00:41:36,094
You ought to beat me.

458
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:41,299
I'm-- I'm afraid I spoiled
your wedding night.

459
00:41:44,743 --> 00:41:47,143
How could you?

460
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:49,146
How could you?

461
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,227
Good afternoon, Mrs. Duchin.

462
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:12,793
Darling, what is it?
You sounded so frantic over the phone.

463
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:16,773
Darling, are you ill?
Why did I have to rush over here?

464
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:18,776
Eddy, what is it?

465
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:31,850
- Well, that's a fine reaction.
- Better go out and come back in again.

466
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:42,798
Well, what happened to Mr. Reisman?

467
00:42:42,868 --> 00:42:45,234
Leo got an offer of a fabulous tour,
and he accepted it.

468
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:49,138
- When did he decide?
- About six weeks ago.

469
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,233
- He's going to Europe and the Riviera.
- Six weeks?

470
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:55,940
- He'll be gone about--
- You've known about this six weeks...

471
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:58,073
and you haven't even told me,
your own wife?

472
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,085
Now, listen, I'm your own husband
and it was almost two months...

473
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:03,781
before you told me
we were gonna have a baby.

474
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:09,051
- You traitor.
- We wanted to surprise you.

475
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:13,121
- Are you pleased?
- Oh, I'm so terribly happy.

476
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:29,209
Will you sit here, Mrs. Duchin?

477
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:37,588
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first appearance...

478
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,454
of Eddy Duchin and his
Central Park Casino Orchestra...

479
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:42,619
and for a very special audience.

480
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:06,715
''You're My Everything.''

481
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:57,367
Mrs. D., do you dance?

482
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:01,105
Well, I-- I have in my time...

483
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:04,006
but I'm not the girl I used to be.

484
00:45:04,843 --> 00:45:07,471
Shall we?
Just the three of us.

485
00:45:13,652 --> 00:45:17,850
I'm afraid I'm rather keeping you
at a distance, Mr. Duchin.

486
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:22,085
Yes. You have let someone
come between us.

487
00:45:24,062 --> 00:45:25,996
Do you mind terribly?

488
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:29,325
Not as long as I have you.

489
00:45:56,094 --> 00:45:58,028
Oh, she's great.

490
00:45:59,164 --> 00:46:01,257
- Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Eddy. What's new?

491
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:09,599
Please, pardon the musical interruption,
ladies and gentlemen...

492
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:13,907
but we had a birth in
the Duchin family this week.

493
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,710
<i>This number is dedicated to
my son Peter, and my wife Marjorie.</i>

494
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:19,876
<i>I hope you're both listening.</i>

495
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:28,052
It's-- It's hard to believe.

496
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:30,526
There must be something you can do.

497
00:46:30,595 --> 00:46:32,927
It had nothing to do
with childbirth.

498
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,966
Believe me, Sherm.
We've done everything possible.

499
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:36,967
Doctor, your exchange
is on the phone.

500
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:38,969
Pardon me a moment.

501
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:42,063
He's certain, of course?

502
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,870
She won't live out the night.

503
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:02,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to say good night.

504
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:05,758
This is Eddy Duchin signing off from the
Central Park Casino in New York City...

505
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:08,857
and wishing you all
a merry, merry Christmas.

506
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:11,459
<i>And, Marjorie,
I'll be right there, darling.</i>

507
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:25,982
Merry Christmas!

508
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:30,587
Congratulations.

509
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:38,489
- Mr. Duchin, we heard your broadcast.
- It was wonderful.

510
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:39,996
Merry Christmas.

511
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:49,334
- Merry Christmas.
- I'd like to speak to you a moment.

512
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,041
It's not true.

513
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:07,742
Eddy, you scared me.

514
00:49:13,258 --> 00:49:14,987
I heard the radio.

515
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:19,796
Did you see the baby?

516
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,066
Of course.

517
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:36,641
I called him a monkey before...

518
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:39,946
but he's really a little kewpie doll,
you know.

519
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,451
Of course.

520
00:49:43,555 --> 00:49:45,546
You talk now.

521
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:47,717
I'm a little tired tonight.

522
00:49:50,962 --> 00:49:55,365
No. I have to tell you
something funny.

523
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:58,027
I was thinking that,
from now on...

524
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:00,731
we'll hang three stockings.

525
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:03,137
You know, not having
any brothers or sisters...

526
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,541
Christmas was always
a lonely time for me.

527
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:20,891
Merry Christmas, Mrs. D.

528
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,253
From Peter Duchin and his father.

529
00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:44,843
You know, Santa Claus...

530
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,612
I think you're really
in love with me.

531
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,024
I want to go home.

532
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:56,861
When can I go home?

533
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,362
Soon.

534
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:02,094
Very soon.

535
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:10,270
I'm so good for you.
Always have been.

536
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:16,739
So very good for me.

537
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,153
The girl that gave me
a hand at the start...

538
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:28,519
who sat beside me
on the piano bench...

539
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:33,387
nursed the bruises
and kissed away the hurt...

540
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:39,095
and taught me all
the things I had to learn.

541
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,866
And it'll be like that always.

542
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:48,640
You can count on me.
Count on your Marjorie.

543
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,416
Where's your hand?

544
00:51:55,387 --> 00:51:56,513
Here.

545
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:01,915
I'll always take care of you.
Peter too.

546
00:52:14,873 --> 00:52:19,708
Eddy Duchin's special angel's
with us all the time...

547
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:21,871
and don't you forget it.

548
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:28,483
Day and night--
he never sleeps, that angel.

549
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:33,184
Full of lovingkindness.

550
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:36,124
For all of us.

551
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:40,754
- What's that sound?
- Nothing.

552
00:52:40,832 --> 00:52:44,393
- But it sounds like the wind.
- No, there's no wind tonight.

553
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:48,098
- I'm afraid of the wind!
- Darling, there's no wind.

554
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:53,611
Easy, now. Easy.
It's all right, darling.

555
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,613
It's all right.

556
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,853
You know...

557
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:08,784
everything's ready for you at home.

558
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,795
The--

559
00:53:12,864 --> 00:53:16,630
The extra room looks kind of strange
with a bassinet.

560
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:21,497
But it isn't an extra room anymore,
it's Peter's room.

561
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:25,935
And the carriage is all
bought and waiting...

562
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:30,938
and it won't be any time at all...

563
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:33,506
before we'll be...

564
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,612
taking him for walks
together in the park...

565
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:41,352
all the places that
we used to go and know.

566
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:57,869
And we'll take him to all
the special places that we used to know.

567
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:01,845
You'll give him--

568
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:12,548
Merry Christmas.

569
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:26,195
Merry Christmas.

570
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:32,068
Merry Christmas.

571
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:40,636
Merry Christmas!

572
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:39,063
New York won't be the same
without you, Eddy.

573
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:41,230
I won't miss it.
It won't miss me.

574
00:56:45,076 --> 00:56:47,670
Don't worry about him, Mr. Wadsworth.
This tour'll do him good.

575
00:56:47,745 --> 00:56:52,079
I think he'll enjoy South America.
New audiences.

576
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,176
New surroundings, gay and painless.

577
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:58,745
And he may get some
sleep down there.

578
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,055
Are you leaving, Uncle Sherm?

579
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:11,863
Eddy, about the baby, about Peter--
you haven't seen him for several weeks.

580
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:15,133
Edith wondered if you weren't going
to drop in before sailing time.

581
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:18,369
He's just a baby.
He won't know I was saying good-bye.

582
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:19,876
- I see.
- I know, in Edith's hands...

583
00:57:19,944 --> 00:57:22,469
he'll be getting wonderful care.

584
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:24,811
I'm deeply grateful to you both
for looking after him.

585
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:28,249
- There's no need--
- Marjorie would've wanted it that way.

586
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:35,659
Till we meet again.

587
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,992
Well, Lou--

588
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,570
Seems like the end of an era.

589
00:58:24,642 --> 00:58:26,132
Maybe it is, Eddy.

590
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,802
Maybe it is.

591
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,159
What is snow--

592
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:56,765
cold or warm when you're under it
for the first time?

593
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,030
Good morning.

594
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:26,826
- Good morning.
- Have you given up sleeping?

595
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:28,496
I've been working.

596
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:30,541
They got a thing now
called the eight-hour day.

597
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,542
There's an eight-hour night too.

598
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,378
- There's nothing here from Boston.
- There's one from Sherman Wadsworth.

599
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:51,759
- Hotel rooms, hotel rooms.
- What's the matter with them?

600
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:55,230
After five years on tour,
I think I've had them. Haven't you?

601
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:58,427
Hey, they're tearing down the casino.

602
00:59:58,503 --> 01:00:01,438
That reminds me. I got a wire
yesterday from the Waldorf.

603
01:00:01,506 --> 01:00:03,838
They want us very much,
right after New Orleans.

604
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:08,140
- I think we ought to take it.
- They're making a playground out of it.

605
01:00:08,212 --> 01:00:10,146
Have you been listening to me?

606
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:16,752
This is the third letter I've had
in two months from Sherman Wadsworth.

607
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:20,518
He's kind of worried.
So are your mother and father.

608
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:24,083
- About what?
- About you. About your son.

609
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,629
You've never seen him, you know.

610
01:00:25,696 --> 01:00:27,755
Look, I've told you before that...

611
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,392
I talk to Edith on the telephone,
and the kid's all right.

612
01:00:30,468 --> 01:00:32,402
So don't worry about him.

613
01:00:35,106 --> 01:00:37,165
Sherm may be going overseas
for the government.

614
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:39,300
He has a feeling
we're gonna get in this war.

615
01:00:39,377 --> 01:00:42,471
Why is it every time I bring up
the subject of your son you change it?

616
01:00:42,547 --> 01:00:46,381
- I just wanna go back to work.
- You can't run away from your own boy.

617
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,975
I'm not!
Now just leave me alone, will you?

618
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,154
I respect your grief,
but I'm not going to stand by...

619
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:56,489
and watch you punishing yourself
and punishing that boy.

620
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:58,495
- Who's punishing myself?
- You think you killed your wife.

621
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,497
Shut up!
I'm not gonna listen to this!

622
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:02,795
You think that if Marjorie hadn't
had your child, she'd have lived.

623
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:03,856
- I don't!
- You do!

624
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:05,732
For God's sake,
will you leave me alone?

625
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:07,964
I haven't been to New York
in five years.

626
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,099
- There's nothing left there.
- You've got a boy growing up there.

627
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:13,109
- You've got to see him.
- He's better off as he is.

628
01:01:13,177 --> 01:01:14,735
- You can't reject your own son.
- He's happy!

629
01:01:14,812 --> 01:01:16,473
How do you know?
Wait a minute!

630
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,516
For five years, you've been
running away from the truth.

631
01:01:19,584 --> 01:01:21,176
Marjorie's dead.

632
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:36,625
Just don't bury the boy with her.

633
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:39,363
Please, don't you under--
That's all the Wadsworths care about.

634
01:01:39,437 --> 01:01:42,133
They brought him up, yes.
Really, they brought him up...

635
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:45,403
but they want him to know you,
his father.

636
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:47,671
Just give it a try, won't you?

637
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,177
If a war comes,
it may be your last chance, so--

638
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,152
We've got four days
between here and New Orleans.

639
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:09,591
All right.

640
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:36,255
Peter, this is your father.

641
01:02:36,327 --> 01:02:38,318
- Hello, Peter.
- How do you do, sir?

642
01:02:39,263 --> 01:02:41,754
You two are going
to have a wonderful day together.

643
01:02:41,832 --> 01:02:44,392
What are your plans?

644
01:02:44,468 --> 01:02:47,767
Well, I thought we'd just
make it up as we go along.

645
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:50,807
- That okay with you, Peter?
- Yes, sir.

646
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:56,678
Well, shall we go?
Good-bye, Edith.

647
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:59,341
- Bye, Aunt Edith.
- Have fun.

648
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:30,878
What about some ice cream?
Really not?

649
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,384
Well, what about a pony ride?

650
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,289
Well, what do you usually do
when you come to the park?

651
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:47,730
Oh,just fool around.

652
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:51,094
Just fool around.

653
01:03:58,509 --> 01:03:59,806
Look at the seals.

654
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,941
Look. They're going swimming.

655
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:08,917
You know, that reminds me.
Out in San Francisco, near the ocean...

656
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:12,979
there's a big rock full
of hundreds of really wild seals.

657
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,423
Not tame ones like these.

658
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:18,223
They're sea lions, not seals.

659
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,002
Hi, Peter.

660
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,638
Uncle Sherman!

661
01:04:36,714 --> 01:04:39,740
It's been fun having
your father here, hasn't it?

662
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,512
I guess I won't see you again
before you go overseas, Sherm.

663
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:46,181
- You'll be in Europe soon, won't you?
- Yes.

664
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:50,626
- It's not a job I relish.
- He thinks it means another world war.

665
01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:52,286
I know.

666
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,333
- I'll keep in touch.
- Write.

667
01:05:00,337 --> 01:05:03,238
- Good-bye, Peter.
- Good-bye, sir.

668
01:05:03,307 --> 01:05:05,537
Thank you very much.
I had a very nice time.

669
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,542
You're welcome, Peter.
So did I.

670
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:24,093
Thanks for the balloon.

671
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,133
Fire two.

672
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:12,509
Fire center.

673
01:06:15,546 --> 01:06:18,310
Fire four.

674
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,720
Oil slick to port.

675
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:36,829
Well, we made it.
Attack successful.

676
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:38,835
Break off the attack.

677
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:49,242
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Eddy.

678
01:06:49,313 --> 01:06:51,873
Come in.
How are things going?

679
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,144
Rough, George. Rough.

680
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,448
They'll get rougher
the closer we get toJapan.

681
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,579
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

682
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:01,090
We're putting in to Mindanao
for repairs.

683
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,056
I've had two more requests
from the Special Services.

684
01:07:07,131 --> 01:07:09,065
They'd like to transfer you
to morale duty.

685
01:07:12,336 --> 01:07:16,033
Sitting out the war at a piano
wouldn't do my morale much good.

686
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:18,267
You've been aboard two years now.

687
01:07:18,342 --> 01:07:20,640
Frankly, I need you here.

688
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:22,508
I won't urge you to go ashore.

689
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,445
Thank you.

690
01:07:24,515 --> 01:07:27,382
But you're like a mule
on this subject. Why?

691
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:30,312
After all, nobody wants to die.

692
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,823
No, of course they don't.

693
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:42,195
But for me, being able
to stay on active duty is--

694
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,200
Well, it's purely selfish.

695
01:07:46,136 --> 01:07:48,969
You see, you can get lost
in the big reality in--

696
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:53,207
in which all the little
personal aches disappear.

697
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,041
War, as the man said, is hell.

698
01:07:57,247 --> 01:08:00,580
But for me, it's a kind of a...

699
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:02,243
personal salvation.

700
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:21,567
Get 'em all out of there now.
That's it. Move it along.

701
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:09,736
Like some chewing gum?

702
01:10:10,948 --> 01:10:12,381
Want some?

703
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,812
All right.
Now, do you think you can do this?

704
01:11:06,904 --> 01:11:08,838
Now, you just keep doing it.

705
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:29,572
<i>Dear Peter, there are so many things
that I would like to say to you.</i>

706
01:13:29,646 --> 01:13:31,739
<i>We've never really known each other.</i>

707
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:34,579
<i>There just never seemed
to be the time.</i>

708
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:38,018
<i>But when I come home,
things will be different.</i>

709
01:13:38,088 --> 01:13:41,717
<i>- I'm going to try to make up for--
- This is the captain speaking.</i>

710
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:45,819
<i>I've just received official word--
firing ceased at 2300.</i>

711
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:50,265
<i>The war is over.
I repeat, the war is over.</i>

712
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:52,564
<i>Stand by for further information.</i>

713
01:14:13,557 --> 01:14:15,548
It'll be sooner than we thought.

714
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,194
Sooner than we thought.

715
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,522
- Mr. Duchin.
- Hello, Charles.

716
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:52,922
I'll tell Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth
you're here.

717
01:14:52,996 --> 01:14:55,396
Thank you.

718
01:14:55,465 --> 01:14:57,262
Mr. Wadsworth.

719
01:14:57,334 --> 01:14:59,234
Mr. Duchin is here.

720
01:15:00,771 --> 01:15:03,239
Eddy! Welcome home!

721
01:15:04,474 --> 01:15:08,877
Welcome home, Eddy. We didn't
expect you till tomorrow night.

722
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:12,403
I found an admiral who was in
a hurry too, so I hitched a ride.

723
01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:15,918
Edith! You've no idea
how good it is to see you.

724
01:15:15,986 --> 01:15:17,681
Come on in and tell us everything.

725
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:20,587
I'm home to stay this time.
Where's Peter?

726
01:15:20,657 --> 01:15:22,682
He and Chiquita went to the park.

727
01:15:22,759 --> 01:15:25,853
I'm going to stay home now
with my son.

728
01:15:25,929 --> 01:15:29,160
- I have so much to make up for.
- We understand.

729
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:34,031
Sherm, I'm organizing a new band.

730
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:36,265
Lou's got us booked into
the Waldorf for a long hitch...

731
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:39,536
so I can stay right here
in New York with Peter.

732
01:15:39,609 --> 01:15:42,578
Maybe I ought to go
to the park and get him.

733
01:15:42,646 --> 01:15:45,945
- Eddy, be patient.
- But I have so many plans.

734
01:15:46,016 --> 01:15:48,576
We're going to set up housekeeping,
a sort of bachelor hall.

735
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:52,452
Say, tell me about this
little girlfriend of Peter's.

736
01:15:52,522 --> 01:15:56,618
Chiquita. She's a sweet child.
You'll like her.

737
01:15:56,693 --> 01:16:00,288
- Spanish?
- English. ''Chiquita's'' a nickname.

738
01:16:00,363 --> 01:16:02,490
Her father was a London
business associate of mine.

739
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:06,627
The entire family
was wiped out during the blitz.

740
01:16:06,703 --> 01:16:08,967
It's been wonderful for Peter
having her here.

741
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:11,132
- They adore each other.
- Aunt Edith. Uncle Sherm.

742
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:13,142
You can't imagine
what happened in the park.

743
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,201
I can skate spread-eagle and--

744
01:16:23,186 --> 01:16:24,312
Hello, Peter.

745
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:40,030
I'm very glad
to be back with you, Peter.

746
01:16:41,671 --> 01:16:43,866
I hope you're happy to see me.

747
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:52,314
Yes.

748
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:03,684
You look like your mother.

749
01:17:10,467 --> 01:17:12,367
I'm told I look like you.

750
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:23,107
Did you get theJapanese sword
and the battle flag I sent?

751
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:26,010
- Yes.
- Good.

752
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:34,079
I hope your little playmate Chiquita
enjoyed the doll.

753
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:36,648
It came from a very fine
Japanese collection.

754
01:17:36,726 --> 01:17:38,489
It's one of the most--

755
01:17:38,562 --> 01:17:41,395
It's one of the most
beautiful dolls I've ever seen.

756
01:17:42,766 --> 01:17:47,066
I'm so very pleased to meet you at last.
Welcome home.

757
01:17:47,137 --> 01:17:49,867
- Thank you.
- Eddy, this is Chiquita Wynn.

758
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:57,470
I can see I've been measuring you
by the wrong yardstick.

759
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,310
I'm desperately sorry.

760
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:01,816
I do apologize
if we've embarrassed you.

761
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:04,217
No, it's just that
I'm afraid that...

762
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,313
salt water has dimmed
my sense of humor.

763
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,188
I think I'll go upstairs now.

764
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,490
But your father
has just arrived, Peter.

765
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:18,430
What about the surprise?

766
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:20,435
Some other time, Aunt Edith.

767
01:18:32,382 --> 01:18:34,577
Mr. Duchin, will you sit here?

768
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:43,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
music by Duchin.

769
01:19:13,556 --> 01:19:17,287
- Where did he learn to play like that?
- Chiquita taught him.

770
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,440
We used to get out
all your records and play them.

771
01:19:32,509 --> 01:19:34,409
We love them so.

772
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:37,469
Excuse me.
I've got a headache.

773
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,311
- Does he really have a headache?
- You know how boys are.

774
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,115
No, I don't know how boys are.

775
01:19:50,193 --> 01:19:52,218
They're unpredictable.

776
01:19:52,295 --> 01:19:54,627
He may have a headache.

777
01:19:54,698 --> 01:19:56,893
At any rate, the experience
of meeting you again...

778
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:59,901
is a little more than he can take
all at one time...

779
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:02,938
and he is determined
not to show it.

780
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:05,497
It should go,
if you don't mind my saying so...

781
01:20:05,575 --> 01:20:07,167
by easy stages.

782
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:12,139
What I feel for Peter isn't
a matter of love by installment.

783
01:20:12,215 --> 01:20:15,082
I was not talking about
what you feel, Mr. Duchin.

784
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:20,822
It's wonderful that you're home.
Excuse me.

785
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:26,621
That's one. Come on.
Throw it in at the mitt.

786
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,029
Way up.

787
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,897
Make it a double-play ball.

788
01:20:31,968 --> 01:20:32,168
Eddy, you sign these contracts
and we're in business.

789
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:36,002
Eddy, you sign these contracts
and we're in business.

790
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:40,638
What a band.
We got everybody we wanted.

791
01:20:41,745 --> 01:20:43,975
These past five weeks,
getting the boys together...

792
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,538
and getting the arrangements set...

793
01:20:46,616 --> 01:20:48,948
reading the small print
in the contracts...

794
01:20:49,018 --> 01:20:51,043
I'm beat.

795
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:53,487
Right in the strike zone.

796
01:20:56,126 --> 01:20:58,356
Ball one.
Strike one.

797
01:21:00,497 --> 01:21:02,624
They're great together, aren't they?

798
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:04,291
High one, Chiquita.

799
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:09,504
Would you come in here
for a moment, please?

800
01:21:21,818 --> 01:21:23,809
- Where do I sign?
- At the bottom.

801
01:21:23,887 --> 01:21:25,479
All copies.

802
01:21:30,393 --> 01:21:33,419
- You called me?
- Oh, yes. Change your clothes.

803
01:21:33,496 --> 01:21:36,397
We can go as soon as I've finished
signing these contracts.

804
01:21:36,466 --> 01:21:38,900
- Go where?
- School starts in a few weeks.

805
01:21:38,968 --> 01:21:41,732
I'll take you shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

806
01:21:41,805 --> 01:21:43,397
But Chiquita--

807
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,745
I'm sorry.
Peter and I did that this morning.

808
01:21:52,816 --> 01:21:54,374
You what?

809
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:56,783
Edith and I thought
you'd been so busy that--

810
01:21:56,853 --> 01:21:59,947
Well, return the things.
I want to take him shopping.

811
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:03,424
But we've already ordered them.

812
01:22:03,493 --> 01:22:05,484
It's easy to cancel an order.

813
01:22:05,562 --> 01:22:07,496
Now run and change your clothes, son.

814
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:22,144
Why, you act exactly
as if I were trying...

815
01:22:22,212 --> 01:22:25,147
to steal your son from you,
Mr. Duchin.

816
01:22:25,215 --> 01:22:27,115
Believe me, I'm not.

817
01:22:27,183 --> 01:22:29,743
From now on, I'll take him shopping
for what he needs.

818
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:31,548
Certainly.

819
01:22:31,621 --> 01:22:33,555
But I don't think,
for his sake and yours...

820
01:22:33,623 --> 01:22:37,457
that we should air our differences
in front of him.

821
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:40,155
Miss Wynn,
I realize that you're here...

822
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:42,357
as a guest of the Wadsworths,
not a nursemaid.

823
01:22:42,432 --> 01:22:44,297
I can't give you orders.

824
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:47,700
-You keep telling me to mend my manners.
-I was not aware--

825
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:49,704
Well, I certainly want it stopped!

826
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:56,270
Unfortunately, your son judges you,
in part, by how you treat me.

827
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:59,873
Let's forget it. We're just
not on the same side of the fence.

828
01:22:59,949 --> 01:23:03,077
Every child needs a father, Mr. Duchin.
I'm well aware of that.

829
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:06,849
- You've turned my son against me.
- You're very rude and tactless.

830
01:23:06,923 --> 01:23:10,290
Whatever exists between you and your son
was ready-made when I arrived here.

831
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,262
- It's all my fault, I suppose.
- I've no interest in fixing blame.

832
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:17,731
Did you know Peter owned every one
of your gramophone recordings...

833
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,234
and he hid them in the cupboard
the moment you came home?

834
01:23:20,303 --> 01:23:23,238
- Hid them? Why?
- Why?

835
01:23:23,306 --> 01:23:25,331
Why give the gift
of love and admiration...

836
01:23:25,408 --> 01:23:28,343
to a god that may depart
on the morrow?

837
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:30,345
It's just a lot of talk.
What does it mean?

838
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:33,177
Whatever you want to make it mean.

839
01:23:33,249 --> 01:23:35,308
Now, that's a real intelligent answer.

840
01:23:36,653 --> 01:23:39,850
You know, it never occurred
to me before.

841
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:42,582
Maybe you're not--

842
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:46,752
Maybe you're not the man
I was told you were.

843
01:23:50,033 --> 01:23:51,625
Miss Wynn.

844
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:09,217
You might not believe this...

845
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,713
but I'm ready to go
down on my knees to that boy.

846
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:14,723
Believe me, you'll have to.

847
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,124
There are so many things about him
that you know that I don't.

848
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:22,630
Many.

849
01:24:27,537 --> 01:24:29,835
Would you tell them to me?

850
01:24:29,906 --> 01:24:32,704
Some of the things I have to say
may be painful.

851
01:24:37,714 --> 01:24:39,306
Please tell me.

852
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:43,384
Please.

853
01:25:23,393 --> 01:25:24,985
Fine. Take five.

854
01:25:27,397 --> 01:25:29,262
- Well, how was it, fellas?
- Great.

855
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:32,631
Solid, Mr. Duchin.
Thanks for asking us.

856
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:35,535
- Good.
- Eddy, can I see you a minute?

857
01:25:35,605 --> 01:25:37,368
Yeah, sure.
Excuse me.

858
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,432
We're opening the Waldorf in a week,
and we've got to make some replacements.

859
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,274
These are the men available.

860
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,507
I like your father.
I seen his picture in the paper.

861
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:47,310
I've seen it a dozen times.

862
01:27:09,465 --> 01:27:11,057
Take the lead, Peter.

863
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:06,853
That was a wonderful session, Peter.

864
01:28:08,424 --> 01:28:10,756
- Thanks.
- That was solid, as they said.

865
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:13,125
- Say, I got another one.
- Now, I regret to add...

866
01:28:13,196 --> 01:28:15,221
we have a dental appointment.

867
01:28:15,298 --> 01:28:18,131
I wish I didn't have to go.
Do I have to go?

868
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:20,135
Why don't you ask your father?

869
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:25,038
I'm asking you.

870
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:27,701
This would be
our third cancellation.

871
01:28:29,245 --> 01:28:31,179
I think you'd better go.

872
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:34,842
There'll be other times.
Miss Wynn is right.

873
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:36,885
Very well.

874
01:28:36,953 --> 01:28:40,252
Good-bye, fellas.
I gotta go to the dentist.

875
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,924
All right, let's go, boys.
Clock's running. Let's go.

876
01:28:46,996 --> 01:28:49,123
We haven't got all day.
We open in a week.

877
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:52,361
Let's go, boys.
Come on. Eddy's waiting.

878
01:28:52,435 --> 01:28:55,199
All right, fellas,
I want to take the theme now.

879
01:34:06,615 --> 01:34:09,607
Chiquita, I think I'd like to dance.

880
01:34:30,506 --> 01:34:33,475
- Congratulations, Eddy.
- Welcome home, Eddy.

881
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,510
Thank you.
It's good to be here.

882
01:34:48,991 --> 01:34:50,583
Enjoying yourself, son?

883
01:35:33,836 --> 01:35:36,031
Nat, take over for me, will you?

884
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:41,600
Eddy, the band never sounded better.

885
01:35:41,677 --> 01:35:44,168
- Take it from Cugat. He know.
- Thank you.

886
01:35:47,182 --> 01:35:49,173
- What's the matter with your arm?
- Nothing, nothing.

887
01:35:49,251 --> 01:35:51,947
It's just hot in there.
I'll go back in a minute.

888
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,357
Eddy, what's the matter
with your hand?

889
01:36:03,432 --> 01:36:04,922
Nothing.

890
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,991
Nothing that a good massage
won't remedy.

891
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:11,630
- That room's no icebox, you know.
- I know.

892
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:14,835
I've booked you for 20 years, and we've
always given them a two-handed player.

893
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:16,844
Lou, will you leave me alone!

894
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,241
I just got a little tired.
That's all.

895
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,842
- Let me call the house doctor.
- No, no, no. Really.

896
01:36:23,919 --> 01:36:26,717
It's all right. There's nothing wrong.
See? It's okay.

897
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:29,781
Good. You know, Eddy,
on the rainy side of 40...

898
01:36:29,858 --> 01:36:32,554
a man ought to have a medical checkup
at least twice a year.

899
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:36,464
Medical checkup twice a year.

900
01:36:38,133 --> 01:36:40,067
We'll get one next week.

901
01:37:20,442 --> 01:37:21,568
Dad?

902
01:37:28,684 --> 01:37:31,380
Mr. Duchin?

903
01:37:31,453 --> 01:37:32,886
Dad!

904
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:37,722
I'm afraid.

905
01:37:37,793 --> 01:37:39,727
Can I stay with you?

906
01:37:42,765 --> 01:37:44,960
Of course, son.
Hop in.

907
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:03,083
Dad?

908
01:38:05,654 --> 01:38:07,087
Yes?

909
01:38:15,964 --> 01:38:17,898
Daddy, I love you!

910
01:38:58,907 --> 01:39:03,105
I was thinking. Why is this holiday
next week called Labor Day?

911
01:39:03,178 --> 01:39:04,907
Why?

912
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,572
Because nobody works.

913
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:09,642
I'm starved!

914
01:39:11,887 --> 01:39:15,323
- Great kid, isn't he, Lou?
- Yes, he is.

915
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:18,450
Reminds me of you when you flew into
the casino first time I met you.

916
01:39:20,729 --> 01:39:23,289
I don't have to have my tonsils out,
if you care to know.

917
01:39:23,365 --> 01:39:26,027
I'm hungry.
I want something to eat.

918
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:29,093
Hey, Hopalong.
Get upstairs and wash.

919
01:39:29,171 --> 01:39:31,935
Cook isn't feeling well,
so I'll rustle you up some grub.

920
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,440
Okay!

921
01:39:36,612 --> 01:39:39,376
America's still
full of wild Indians.

922
01:39:39,448 --> 01:39:41,473
Did the doctor look at his throat?

923
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,610
Yes, of course.
Both of us. Nothing's wrong.

924
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:47,712
Edith and Sherm
are certainly burning up Europe.

925
01:39:47,789 --> 01:39:50,189
I'll get Peter something to eat.
Will you stay, Lou?

926
01:39:50,259 --> 01:39:52,193
Oh, no, thanks, Chiquita.

927
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:56,864
That's the kind of woman for you.

928
01:39:58,567 --> 01:40:01,502
- Was, you mean.
- There are other doctors.

929
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:05,973
Dr. Richter's a specialist, Lou.
Where are you going?

930
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:08,305
Back to the hotel
to think about my sins.

931
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:11,778
- Maybe I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

932
01:40:11,847 --> 01:40:13,781
Life can be heartless,
huh, Lou?

933
01:40:44,346 --> 01:40:45,938
Hungry too?

934
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:50,943
No, I-- Just in the mood
to beat a teakettle.

935
01:40:51,019 --> 01:40:52,418
May I?

936
01:40:52,487 --> 01:40:55,456
- Beat a what?
- Teakettle.

937
01:40:55,524 --> 01:40:57,788
What does that mean?

938
01:40:57,859 --> 01:40:59,918
It's an old expression.
'' Beat a teakettle.''

939
01:40:59,995 --> 01:41:02,657
It means jabber jabber.

940
01:41:02,731 --> 01:41:04,323
Jabber away.

941
01:41:13,241 --> 01:41:15,175
Well, where's the jabber?

942
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,172
You say something.

943
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:25,445
That bird is brilliant.
Do you hear it out in the garden?

944
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,489
That's topic one. Next.

945
01:41:28,557 --> 01:41:30,957
Next?

946
01:41:31,026 --> 01:41:35,360
Not only packaged bread,
but packaged, sliced bread.

947
01:41:36,565 --> 01:41:40,433
This is an American luxury
that passes all understanding.

948
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:48,641
Eddy, if I--
if I may begin again...

949
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:52,237
it makes me very happy that
Peter and you are together and...

950
01:41:53,749 --> 01:41:55,683
Peter really has a father.

951
01:41:59,121 --> 01:42:00,315
I'll miss him.

952
01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:06,385
Miss him?
Where are you going?

953
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:08,588
Home to England.

954
01:42:09,865 --> 01:42:12,231
What's in England?

955
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,768
England's home to me.

956
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:17,270
What is home?

957
01:42:18,173 --> 01:42:20,505
Is it perhaps the place
where your husband is?

958
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:25,970
I suppose it is,
if you have the husband.

959
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:34,818
Did it ever occur to you that
I might ask to be your husband?

960
01:42:36,758 --> 01:42:39,420
Well, frankly, no.

961
01:42:39,494 --> 01:42:43,726
I've always known how
you felt about Peter's mother.

962
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:49,663
Chiquita, I'd like
to tell you about that.

963
01:42:52,274 --> 01:42:55,539
I loved Marjorie
more deeply than my own life.

964
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,544
I'd never deny that.

965
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:04,043
We were gay friends, tender lovers,
a pair of kids together.

966
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,914
How often can you be kids together?

967
01:43:09,524 --> 01:43:11,685
Only once, Chiquita.

968
01:43:14,529 --> 01:43:16,463
And no one, but no one...

969
01:43:16,531 --> 01:43:19,398
gets the big jackpots of life
more than once.

970
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:24,304
Young love is once.

971
01:43:25,674 --> 01:43:27,608
The first time you have a child.

972
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:33,438
Or watching your parents grow old.

973
01:43:33,515 --> 01:43:35,107
That's another ''once.''

974
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,787
I didn't know that
when Marjorie went.

975
01:43:41,857 --> 01:43:44,325
I tried to live
in a charmed circle...

976
01:43:44,392 --> 01:43:46,326
that was gone forever.

977
01:43:55,036 --> 01:43:56,970
I want you to know, Chiquita...

978
01:43:57,038 --> 01:43:59,802
I'd give anything for you
not to leave Peter and me.

979
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,976
What did you say?

980
01:44:04,045 --> 01:44:06,741
Excuse me.
I didn't have the right to say it.

981
01:44:06,815 --> 01:44:10,410
In all my life,
I've never admired a woman more.

982
01:44:10,485 --> 01:44:12,680
Do you understand?

983
01:44:12,754 --> 01:44:16,588
Eddy, I really don't understand
what you're talking about.

984
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:07,207
- Eddy, I--
- Please,just go away.

985
01:45:07,275 --> 01:45:08,936
I don't understand.
Are you angry with me?

986
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,443
- Of course not.
- Then what's wrong?

987
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:12,104
Chiquita, will you--

988
01:45:16,718 --> 01:45:18,948
I love you.
I love you.

989
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,318
- You know that, don't you?
- No, I don't.

990
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:25,518
I don't understand all this, Eddy.

991
01:45:25,594 --> 01:45:28,961
Well, it's nothing
you'd like to understand.

992
01:45:34,502 --> 01:45:37,596
All right.
I'm gonna die.

993
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:41,233
Maybe you understand that.
It's that plain and simple.

994
01:45:41,309 --> 01:45:43,641
The doctor used
a fine 20-dollar phrase--

995
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:45,509
''unfortunate prognosis.''

996
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,775
That's polite for ''hopeless.''

997
01:45:47,849 --> 01:45:50,215
Eddy, wait a minute.
What's hopeless?

998
01:45:50,285 --> 01:45:52,549
- The doctor said--
- He said I have a year to live.

999
01:45:52,621 --> 01:45:55,818
It's called hematocytosis.
Perfectly harmless to your neighbors...

1000
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:58,291
only you get gobbled up
and disappear.

1001
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,225
I can't believe it.

1002
01:46:00,295 --> 01:46:02,286
That's what I told the good doctor.

1003
01:46:03,498 --> 01:46:06,228
He turned away and shook his head.

1004
01:46:09,371 --> 01:46:11,532
- Then we'll go to another doctor.
- Chiquita, stop it.

1005
01:46:11,606 --> 01:46:14,769
I've been to three,
and their opinions don't differ.

1006
01:46:14,843 --> 01:46:16,435
Eddy, they--

1007
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:23,949
So much for love...

1008
01:46:24,019 --> 01:46:25,953
or whatever future
we might have--

1009
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:41,994
Does anyone know?

1010
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:43,662
Only Lou.

1011
01:46:51,079 --> 01:46:52,671
Does Peter know?

1012
01:46:54,616 --> 01:46:56,208
Not yet.

1013
01:46:58,486 --> 01:47:00,977
Look.

1014
01:47:01,056 --> 01:47:02,990
Look at the speed of the river.

1015
01:47:06,094 --> 01:47:08,995
It's strange how unreal
the real can be.

1016
01:47:13,568 --> 01:47:15,934
Have to call my folks in Boston...

1017
01:47:16,004 --> 01:47:17,596
say hello.

1018
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:23,942
Eddy, I would be so proud
to be your wife.

1019
01:47:26,548 --> 01:47:29,016
I don't want pity.

1020
01:47:29,084 --> 01:47:31,177
It has nothing to do with pity.

1021
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,588
No, I couldn't do that.

1022
01:47:43,264 --> 01:47:45,596
Eddy, I love you so much.

1023
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:50,529
You love me?

1024
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:53,301
For such a long, long time.

1025
01:47:54,609 --> 01:47:56,543
I want to be your wife.

1026
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:18,560
You know...

1027
01:48:18,633 --> 01:48:20,726
if this weren't
Edith's wedding present...

1028
01:48:20,802 --> 01:48:22,827
out the window it would go.

1029
01:48:22,904 --> 01:48:25,634
Oh, sure.
$20 worth of Renoir?

1030
01:48:27,675 --> 01:48:30,166
D-seventh.

1031
01:48:30,245 --> 01:48:32,179
You like it there?

1032
01:48:33,648 --> 01:48:35,809
You know, this place
is getting a little crowded.

1033
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,250
Well, not with pictures.
With pianos.

1034
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,345
You know, I knew I was marrying
for better or worse.

1035
01:48:41,423 --> 01:48:44,017
But two pianos?

1036
01:48:44,092 --> 01:48:47,186
Doesn't everyone have two pianos?

1037
01:48:47,262 --> 01:48:52,131
Say, that's Uncle Lou.
You see? He didn't forget.

1038
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,294
Lou promised to take him to a movie.

1039
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:57,304
- The albums?
- Yeah.

1040
01:48:59,274 --> 01:49:02,437
- Daddy, your albums are here.
- Fine. Thank you, Lou.

1041
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:04,842
- Don't mention it.
- Hello, Lou.

1042
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:07,438
- Can I borrow him for a couple hours?
- If you promise to bring him back.

1043
01:49:07,515 --> 01:49:08,846
I will.

1044
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:11,886
Let's take Lou with us when
we go to Bermuda next spring.

1045
01:49:15,356 --> 01:49:18,519
- Aren't we going to Bermuda?
- Sure.

1046
01:49:18,593 --> 01:49:21,790
And next summer,
Italy and France too?

1047
01:49:21,863 --> 01:49:23,797
I'm gonna row a gondola.

1048
01:49:27,802 --> 01:49:31,203
- I'm ready. Good-bye, Daddy.
- Good-bye, Peter.

1049
01:49:31,272 --> 01:49:33,365
- Good-bye, Chiquita.
- Have a good time at the movies.

1050
01:49:33,441 --> 01:49:35,375
I will. Thank you.

1051
01:49:38,046 --> 01:49:40,241
Last one out is a rotten egg.

1052
01:49:48,223 --> 01:49:51,056
Take the car.

1053
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:54,562
You know, you never trusted me
with your Stutz Bearcat.

1054
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:56,324
Stutz scared cat?

1055
01:49:56,397 --> 01:49:58,331
What's that?

1056
01:49:59,601 --> 01:50:02,297
Last one out's a rotten egg.

1057
01:50:32,901 --> 01:50:34,425
You like it better there?

1058
01:50:36,571 --> 01:50:38,368
Eddy, you're going
to have to tell Peter.

1059
01:50:42,076 --> 01:50:45,603
- No, I can't.
- You must.

1060
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,614
But I wouldn't know how
to do a thing like that.

1061
01:50:48,683 --> 01:50:50,378
It doesn't have
to be done tonight.

1062
01:50:50,451 --> 01:50:52,783
Listen, dear, tonight,
next week, a month from now--

1063
01:50:52,854 --> 01:50:56,483
What difference does it make?
I just couldn't do it.

1064
01:50:57,592 --> 01:51:00,356
What I want to know is why!

1065
01:51:00,428 --> 01:51:03,295
Why do they have
to destroy a man twice?

1066
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:05,924
You work and work,
and just when you get a--

1067
01:51:08,937 --> 01:51:10,734
Everything.

1068
01:51:10,805 --> 01:51:13,069
When it gets too good,
they take it away.

1069
01:51:18,413 --> 01:51:21,814
I don't want to die.
I don't.

1070
01:51:35,997 --> 01:51:38,591
I'll tell him.

1071
01:51:40,134 --> 01:51:41,726
I'll tell him.

1072
01:51:51,813 --> 01:51:54,782
Oh, God, give me the proper words
to say to him.

1073
01:52:10,431 --> 01:52:12,831
This is where you used
to play the piano.

1074
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:16,358
The Central Park Casino
used to be here, didn't it, Dad?

1075
01:52:20,174 --> 01:52:21,766
Yes, that's right.

1076
01:52:25,346 --> 01:52:28,213
Say, Dad, how did they happen
to have a nightclub...

1077
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:30,979
right here in the middle
of the park?

1078
01:52:31,052 --> 01:52:34,215
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

1079
01:52:50,471 --> 01:52:52,837
And you lived up there.

1080
01:52:52,907 --> 01:52:54,738
Yes.

1081
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:58,370
Boy, you know what
you could've done, Dad?

1082
01:52:58,446 --> 01:53:01,677
You could've got a steel cable,
run it from your apartment...

1083
01:53:01,749 --> 01:53:03,580
right down here to the casino.

1084
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,710
Then, when you wanted
to go to work...

1085
01:53:05,787 --> 01:53:08,517
you just climb up
on your cable and go--

1086
01:53:10,692 --> 01:53:14,628
And boom--you'd land right
at the piano and start to play.

1087
01:53:14,696 --> 01:53:16,789
Now, why didn't I think of that?

1088
01:53:18,366 --> 01:53:22,996
The only trouble is,
how would you get home?

1089
01:53:23,071 --> 01:53:25,369
Well...

1090
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:28,739
I think if I got
a running start--

1091
01:53:31,612 --> 01:53:35,378
What did you want
to talk to me about, Dad?

1092
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:37,042
Well, I...

1093
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:40,844
thought it might be fun
if we took a walk together.

1094
01:53:50,465 --> 01:53:53,491
When I was in the navy
in the Pacific...

1095
01:53:53,568 --> 01:53:55,536
I tried to write to you.

1096
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:02,707
There were so many things
I wanted to tell you.

1097
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,414
You never knew your mother.

1098
01:54:09,851 --> 01:54:12,149
But when I lost her, I--

1099
01:54:13,488 --> 01:54:16,321
Peter, I need your help.

1100
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:19,383
I've been thinking, son.

1101
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:23,021
The only way I'd ever leave you again
would be against my will.

1102
01:54:25,433 --> 01:54:29,028
A trip, you mean?
A road tour with the band?

1103
01:54:32,607 --> 01:54:35,701
No, not exactly.

1104
01:54:37,545 --> 01:54:40,571
You're going away for a long time?

1105
01:54:40,648 --> 01:54:42,582
For a long time, son.

1106
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,994
Will Chiquita go with you?

1107
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:04,003
No, she'll stay here with you.

1108
01:55:07,608 --> 01:55:11,305
You know, Peter, there's no one dearer
to me in the whole world than you.

1109
01:55:13,548 --> 01:55:15,140
But I--

1110
01:55:17,051 --> 01:55:18,985
I can't stay with you, son.

1111
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,697
Do you have to do it?
Go, I mean?

1112
01:55:36,771 --> 01:55:39,262
Yes.

1113
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,274
Well, I don't care.

1114
01:55:42,743 --> 01:55:44,608
I don't think you mean that, Peter.

1115
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:46,909
Don't tell me what I mean.

1116
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:50,212
You said you have to go.
You're gonna leave me again.

1117
01:55:50,284 --> 01:55:52,309
- Didn't you?
- No, Peter. Listen.

1118
01:55:52,386 --> 01:55:55,219
You don't have to bother
explaining things.

1119
01:55:55,289 --> 01:55:57,223
I can get along without you.

1120
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:59,259
I've done it before,
and I can do it again.

1121
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:01,693
You must understand, Peter.
Listen to me.

1122
01:56:01,762 --> 01:56:04,663
I told you,
it was against my will.

1123
01:56:04,732 --> 01:56:07,530
Don't say that!
It's not true.

1124
01:56:07,602 --> 01:56:10,594
There's no one who can tell you
what to do.

1125
01:56:20,548 --> 01:56:23,574
Peter, there's somebody
who tells us all what to do.

1126
01:56:28,389 --> 01:56:32,052
You remember the hospitals I've gone to,
the doctors I've seen recently?

1127
01:56:32,126 --> 01:56:36,062
Yes, but you're all right now.
You told us.

1128
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:39,759
No, I'm sick, Peter.

1129
01:56:39,834 --> 01:56:42,667
I'm very sick.

1130
01:56:42,737 --> 01:56:46,138
And that's why I won't be
with you much longer, son.

1131
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:52,846
Do you understand what I'm trying
to tell you, Peter?

1132
01:56:52,914 --> 01:56:54,814
Do you understand?

1133
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:08,919
Yes.

1134
01:57:08,996 --> 01:57:11,464
I...

1135
01:57:11,532 --> 01:57:13,864
think I understand.

1136
01:57:46,867 --> 01:57:49,597
I've been lonesome
without my two men.

1137
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:57,901
It's Cook's day off,
and you know what that means.

1138
01:58:10,725 --> 01:58:13,057
I'll take care of her, Dad.

1139
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:31,968
Well, how about a little
double piano?

1140
01:59:28,335 --> 01:59:29,461
Music by Duchin.

1141
02:01:04,131 --> 02:01:06,361
You're getting awfully good, son.

1142
02:01:06,433 --> 02:01:09,061
It's hard to tell
where I leave off and you begin.
