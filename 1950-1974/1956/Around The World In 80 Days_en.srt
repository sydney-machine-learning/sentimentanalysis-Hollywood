1
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,930
Jules Verne wrote many books.

2
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:15,082
He was able to transfer
his soaring imagination to print.

3
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,571
His predictions were bold.

4
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:21,004
What he wrote was regarded
as fantastic fiction...

5
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:23,648
but much of it has become fact.

6
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:28,446
Flying machines,
submarines, television, rockets.

7
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:32,364
But not even his imagination
could shrink the earth...

8
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,205
to the point it has now reached.

9
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:37,251
<i>He wrote a book called
From the Earth to the Moon.</i>

10
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:40,610
And in Paris,
that authentic genius Georges Méliès...

11
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,367
turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter...

12
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,490
just as you're looking at it now.

13
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:47,644
It was, of course, fantasy.

14
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:51,246
But as of now,
no one has yet gone to the moon...

15
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,244
to see whether Méliès was right.

16
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:57,162
Here is the actual film
as Méliès' camera recorded it...

17
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:58,925
at the turn of the century.

18
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:09,891
<i>I suppose that since man
began to walk upright,,,</i>

19
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,612
<i>he has been interested in space and speed,</i>

20
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,326
<i>He has wondered increasingly
about the planets he sees in the sky,</i>

21
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,765
<i>The stretching fingertips of science
have moved him higher and faster,,,</i>

22
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:24,889
<i>than man has ever moved before,</i>

23
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:28,883
<i>One of Jules Verne's characters,
a fanatic and a dreamer,,,</i>

24
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,851
<i>argues for the construction
of a rocket to the moon,</i>

25
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,842
<i>After reasoned discourse,
the venture is launched,</i>

26
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,928
<i>This is the first photographic dissolve,</i>

27
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,487
<i>This is a do-it-yourself rocket,</i>

28
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,930
<i>Rockets have changed,
Photography has changed,</i>

29
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,850
<i>Costumes have changed,</i>

30
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:18,564
<i>But some things remain unchanged,
even in Verne and Méliès'imagination,</i>

31
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:20,046
<i>Jules Verne's rocket returns to the earth,,,</i>

32
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,842
<i>a minor planet,
where fiction lags behind fact,</i>

33
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,810
<i>Ten, nine,,,</i>

34
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,926
<i>eight, seven, six, five,,,</i>

35
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:35,888
<i>four, three, two, one, Fire!</i>

36
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,602
<i>There is, in this power of destruction,,,</i>

37
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,530
<i>also the promise of hope,</i>

38
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,489
<i>A world of unlimited power
and limitless hope,</i>

39
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:09,243
<i>Man has devised a method
of destroying most of humanity,,,</i>

40
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:13,731
<i>or of lifting it up to high plateaus
of prosperity and progress,,,</i>

41
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:16,733
<i>never dreamed of
by the boldest dreamer,</i>

42
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:20,888
<i>You are now looking
at the receding shape of this planet Earth,</i>

43
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:29,325
<i>This is how the earth looks
from a camera in the rocket,</i>

44
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:35,124
<i>Jules Verne wrote a book
about going around the world in 80 days,</i>

45
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:38,803
<i>He even predicted
it could be done in 80 hours,</i>

46
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,491
<i>Today it can be done
in less than half that time,</i>

47
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:45,123
<i>But each journey must have an end,</i>

48
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:49,407
<i>Speed is good
only when wisdom leads the way,</i>

49
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:51,292
<i>The end of this journey,,,</i>

50
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:55,531
<i>whether to the high horizons of hope
or the depths of destruction,,,</i>

51
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,493
will be determined
by the collective wisdom...

52
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:01,451
of the people who live
on this shrinking planet.

53
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:08,243
There was a time not so long ago
when learned men thought that was flat.

54
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:12,649
<i>Around The World In 80 Days
is the Jules Verne classic.</i>

55
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,492
And the world was already shrinking
when it was written.

56
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,291
And that was in 1872.

57
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:13,329
Get your morning paper here.
All about the bank robbery here.

58
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,682
Paper, sir?

59
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:35,161
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Thorndyke.

60
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,527
- Hinshaw.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:45,571
<i>Someone's been tampering
with my Telegraph. The pages are crushed.</i>

62
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:49,090
One of the members borrowed it
to read about the robbery.

63
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:51,051
You mean is been used?

64
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,252
- Kindly remove it and send for a fresh one.
- At once, sir.

65
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,848
I'm a patient man, Hinshaw,
but don't trespass on my good feelings.

66
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,726
Pilbeam! Did you hear that?

67
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:09,050
- Some fellow stole that chap's paper.
- The devil you say!

68
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,122
Word of honor.

69
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:13,205
First time is happened here,
to my knowledge, in 45 years.

70
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,806
The club's going to the dogs.

71
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,771
Next thing you know,
the members will be talking to each other!

72
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:20,287
- Yes, is the thin end of the wedge.
- Oh, dog!

73
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,084
- Ice, my lord?
- Ice?

74
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:32,611
Certainly not.
What do I look like, a polar bear?

75
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:36,851
Sorry, sir. Several of the members use it
now and then.

76
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:40,768
Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say.
Those redskins over there drink anything.

77
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,287
A dangerous custom,
as I've always thought, sir.

78
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:46,126
A man might catch
a nasty chill on his liver.

79
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,412
Or break a tooth.

80
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,967
Remind me to speak
to the House committee about it.

81
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:53,726
<i>No, by Gad! I'll write a letter to The Times.</i>

82
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,881
- I say, Hinshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?

83
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,128
Must we have that confounded animal
around here, stamping its feet?

84
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,967
- Mind the horses!
- That bloke is barmy!

85
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,452
There's a sight!

86
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,571
Move over!
Move that confounded contraption!

87
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,323
When I placed you with Mr. Fogg
a fortnight ago...

88
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:32,971
I warned you that he was an eccentric.

89
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,965
An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott?
The man's a tyrant.

90
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,848
A cold-hearted, implacable fiend.

91
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:43,091
Must I remind you that you are
speaking of a member of the Reform Club?

92
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:46,324
I don't care if he's member of the
Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.

93
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,448
The man's mad!

94
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,083
Actually, excessive sanity
is not a necessary qualification...

95
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:52,925
for that particular institution.

96
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,004
Believe me, sir, he is not human.

97
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:57,653
Do you know how many valets
he's had in six months?

98
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,645
Certainly I do.
I've supplied him with five of them myself.

99
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:04,362
And are you aware that he tortured them
with a refinement of cruelty...

100
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:08,366
which would have put Torquemada and
the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame!

101
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:12,526
He's as cold and methodical as those
two watches he carries about with him.

102
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:17,686
You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric.

103
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,323
Remember, you've been rigorously trained
as a gentleman's gentleman.

104
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,449
A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir.

105
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,683
A whimpering, cringing...

106
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,723
slave is another.

107
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,887
You are allowing
your native imperturbability...

108
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:37,249
to be swept away
by a spate of mounting hysteria.

109
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:40,412
- You really must calm down.
- I can't help it, sir.

110
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,201
If you knew how ardently
I have worked for Mr. Fogg...

111
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,769
how enthusiastically I have endeavored
to cater to his every whim.

112
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:51,491
His bath water had to be exactly
one foot, three and one-quarter inches.

113
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,052
No less, no more.

114
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:57,249
His morning toast had to be
83 degrees Fahrenheit.

115
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,808
- No more, no less.
- Extraordinary.

116
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:03,482
How does one take
the temperature of toast?

117
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:06,847
Incidentally...

118
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,682
have you found out
anything definite about him?

119
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,051
Who he is, what he does?

120
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,245
- Not the faintest indication, sir. Have you?
- Alas, no.

121
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,487
All I have discovered is entirely negative.

122
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:23,533
He is not a professional man,
and he isn't in trade.

123
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:26,850
He has no family connections
or background worth mentioning.

124
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:31,245
He doesn't go in
for hunting, or fishing, or wenching.

125
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:36,126
Cannot imagine how he ever got
into the Reform Club!

126
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:40,572
Perhaps your uncle the Bishop
might inquire for you.

127
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,441
- He is a member, is he not?
- One of the most distinguished, Foster.

128
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:47,966
We are a very ancient family, you know.

129
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,605
I was just rather curious
about our precious Mr. Fogg.

130
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:56,852
I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon
for someone to fill your place.

131
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,643
Thank you for your cooperation, Foster.

132
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:02,251
We must pray for guidance.

133
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:06,772
You have a nice little position
for a gentleman's gentleman, sir?

134
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,369
- For you?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:18,488
Never doubt for one instant, Foster...

136
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:20,485
the efficacy of prayer.

137
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:23,922
What is your name?

138
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,886
Passepartout.

139
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,007
I am from a very ancient family, sir.

140
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:36,562
Obviously.

141
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,849
You've had a rather speckled career, I see.
Professor of gymnastics...

142
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:46,289
- Yes, sir. Watch.
- No demonstrations, please.

143
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:50,168
Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep.

144
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:54,409
- Amazing. How did you come to England?
- In a clothes basket, sir.

145
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,682
I escaped.

146
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:57,729
- From what?
- Women, sir.

147
00:14:58,293 --> 00:14:59,487
A ladies' man?

148
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:02,364
There are no women in this household.

149
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:04,444
Now, my conditions are strict.

150
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,489
My timetable never varies.

151
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,923
When I say breakfast at 8:24...

152
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,481
- I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,764
- Do you have a watch?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:15,286
Is probably wrong.

155
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,728
Very well. See that you behave yourself.

156
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:25,724
Any tomfoolery and out you go.

157
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:31,931
Come on, Ralph, don't be so secretive.
You're one of the governors of the bank.

158
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,652
Yes. Les have some lurid details.

159
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,610
Nothing to tell.
You've read the newspapers.

160
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:38,206
They always exaggerate.

161
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,809
You mean to say the thief
actually got away with £55,000?

162
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,372
He did, in brand new bank notes.

163
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:46,525
Large denominations, £500 or £1,000 each.

164
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,081
How did you know?
We didn't disclose that to the press.

165
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:50,242
I assumed it.

166
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,042
£55,000 of small currency would have
needed a handcart to transport it.

167
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,931
It must have been compact enough
to stuff into one's pockets.

168
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,005
You're right. The man's audacity
staggers the imagination.

169
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,368
Imagine sauntering up
to the head cashier's table...

170
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,762
and pilfering a sum like that
from under his nose.

171
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:06,366
Serves you right, in a way.

172
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:10,002
Surely you have a better hiding place
for your funds than the cashier's nose.

173
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:13,608
Your persiflage does not amuse.
This has been an unexpected blow to us.

174
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,047
Unexpected, Mr. Ralph?

175
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:18,404
Bankers must expect robbery
the same way chickens expect hawks.

176
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,087
Is an occupational hazard.
My lead, I believe.

177
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:24,529
By the way, what was the head cashier
doing at the time?

178
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:27,605
He was writing a receipt
for the three-shilling deposit.

179
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:31,923
Go ahead and jeer. We'll lay the culprit
by the heels soon enough.

180
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:34,049
We've notified detectives
all over the world...

181
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,486
from Liverpool to Cairo.

182
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:38,929
We've issued descriptions throughout
Europe and America. He won't get far.

183
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:41,083
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you.

184
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:43,209
You're dealing
with a rather exceptional person.

185
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,726
Really? In what way?

186
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,805
Only a cool and logical man
could have engineered such an exploit.

187
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,487
Obviously a gentleman
with a considerable presence of mind.

188
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:53,406
You seem to know rather more
about this affair than the police.

189
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:55,529
Merely what one might deduce
from the facts.

190
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:56,728
Our trick.

191
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,892
If you ask me,
I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief.

192
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:03,966
If he's a resourceful chap, as Fogg says,
he'll find plenty of places to hide.

193
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,726
Yes. The worlïs
a pretty large affair, after all.

194
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:09,043
It was 100 years ago, not any longer.

195
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,363
A man can girdle the globe now
in three months.

196
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,569
Less than that, to be precise. In 80 days.

197
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:17,248
You mean a complete tour
all around the world in 80 days?

198
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,652
I mean just that.

199
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,692
- He's talking nonsense.
- No, Fogg may have a point there.

200
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,446
The Great Indian Peninsula Railway
was opened a fortnight ago.

201
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:27,172
<i>That shortens the trip.
I read it in The Daily Telegraph.</i>

202
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,369
<i>Hang The Daily Telegraph.
I say is impossible.</i>

203
00:17:29,453 --> 00:17:30,806
Nothing is impossible.

204
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:34,886
When science conquers the air it may
be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours.

205
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:37,646
Is a beautiful dream,
but I'm talking about this moment...

206
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,293
and I say nobody
can go around the world in 80 days.

207
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:41,408
I agree.

208
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,961
Even if one made ideal connections
at every point...

209
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,523
there'd still be typhoons, shipwrecks,
unforeseen delays.

210
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,251
I include the unforeseen.

211
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:53,602
All very glib, Fogg,
but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days.

212
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,884
You're convinced that I could not?

213
00:17:55,973 --> 00:18:00,171
So much so
that I'll wager £5,000 that you can't.

214
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:04,130
Let me understand you clearly.
Are you formally challenging me...

215
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,522
to undertake a journey
around the world in 80 days?

216
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:10,652
I am, and I'm prepared to back
my conviction by posting my check now.

217
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:12,686
Very well, I accept.

218
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:15,486
This is absurd. The joke's gone far enough.

219
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,962
An Englishman never jokes about a wager.

220
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:23,242
I have on deposit at Barings Bank
the sum of £20,000.

221
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,245
I'm willing to wager any or all of it
upon the same contention.

222
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,450
Namely, that I can complete
a tour of the world in 80 days.

223
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:34,051
That is to say,
in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes.

224
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,968
Would anyone besides Stuart
care to participate?

225
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:40,170
I'm no gambler,
but if you want to make foolhardy bets...

226
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,529
that you can't possibly win,
I'm afraid I'll be forced to take you on.

227
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:44,568
I'm with you.

228
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,883
So am I. What about you, Ralph?

229
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,483
My affiliation with the Bank of England
naturally precludes my betting...

230
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:53,849
but as a member of this club I might,
under very special circumstances.

231
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:54,922
Then is agreed?

232
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,366
- We all accept?
- Yes.

233
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:59,172
Good. If I remember correctly,
the boat train for Dover...

234
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:01,687
leaves London Bridge station
at 8:45 tonight.

235
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,286
- I will be on it.
- Tonight?

236
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,568
Don't you need some days
to settle your affairs...

237
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:08,292
- to make preparations?
- No. I'm quite ready now.

238
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,332
You engage to be back here in London,
in the Reform Club...

239
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:15,884
on Saturday, September 21 at 8:45 p.m.

240
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:20,532
Right, gentlemen.
Clubs, I believe, are still trumps?

241
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:22,611
Shall we finish the game?

242
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,607
<i>- Yes, please?
- Come to my bedroom at once,</i>

243
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,162
Yes, sir.

244
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:45,565
- I called you twice.
- I came as fast as possible, sir.

245
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,283
You are not supposed to be home yet, sir.

246
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,204
My usual routine is beside the point.

247
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,124
We leave for the Continent in 10 minutes.

248
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:56,011
<i>- Monsieur is going traveling?
- Yes. Around the world.</i>

249
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:59,843
Then you will not be here for breakfast.

250
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,571
Around the world?

251
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:05,930
Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties
and start packing.

252
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,686
<i>Which clothes does monsieur...
I mean, which trunks?</i>

253
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:20,812
None whatever. Just take two shirts
and three pairs of hose for each of us.

254
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:23,846
- But I have only one shirt, sir.
- Then take that.

255
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:27,209
We'll buy whatever else we need en route.
Give me that red bag.

256
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:39,922
Open it up.
We're going to need plenty of money.

257
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:45,004
Whatever you do,
never let this out of your sight.

258
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:49,211
<i>Monsieur can trust me.
I will cherish it like a woman.</i>

259
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:51,369
Don't make love to it. Just watch it.

260
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:51,089
Excuse me, sir. My cousin.

261
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:56,042
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>

262
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,083
Excuse me, sir. Is not my cousin.

263
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,286
Thomas Cook and Son.

264
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:49,003
You purchase the tickets.
I'll be back in a moment.

265
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,287
All right, sir.

266
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,643
<i>Now, monsieur, train to Marseilles...</i>

267
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,487
steamer to Bombay via Suez,
across India by train...

268
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:06,450
and steamer again to Hong Kong.

269
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,127
Only one drawback.

270
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:10,853
With this route,
you miss Bali and the women.

271
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,127
But no, women of Bali
cannot be described.

272
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:20,690
<i>- Please try.
- No, monsieur. Words would fail me.</i>

273
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:25,086
In any case, in Yokohama,
you will encounter the geisha girls...

274
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,092
<i>and those, monsieur,
are not to be sneezed at.</i>

275
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:29,807
I shall remember.

276
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:34,411
In Yokohama,
I must not sneeze at geisha girls.

277
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,293
Then, between San Francisco
and New York...

278
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:41,292
you will discover Indian maidens galore...

279
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,724
statuesque, barbaric creatures.

280
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,642
What a crime you have only 80 days.

281
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:50,042
However, first things first.

282
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:53,052
Here are your tickets to Marseilles.

283
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,202
Cancel those tickets.
They are of no further use to us.

284
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,692
We cannot go by train.

285
00:25:57,813 --> 00:25:59,405
Has something happened? A wreck?

286
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,563
An avalanche has sealed
the Montfort tunnel...

287
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,405
and nothing can get through for a week.

288
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,565
Then the roads are blocked, too.
How can we go on?

289
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:09,970
I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted
at this stage of the game.

290
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:12,442
There must be another way.
There has to be.

291
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:14,729
But after all, we are not birds.

292
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,003
We cannot fly across the mountains.

293
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:21,485
<i>That, monsieur, is not unfeasible,
fantastic as it seems.</i>

294
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,052
Isn't she lovely?

295
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:34,050
I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen...

296
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:36,489
to an elevation over 1,000 meters.

297
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:40,248
I've flown through the skies
at a speed surpassing that of an eagle.

298
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:43,730
Are you quite sure
this is not just Gallic braggadocio?

299
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:48,811
You are now addressing the second
most-celebrated balloonist in Europe.

300
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:50,849
- And who is the first?
- He is not available.

301
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,969
He was buried last Tuesday.

302
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:56,365
Tell me, is this apparatus of yours
for lease?

303
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,450
Lf I operate it, yes.

304
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:01,164
If you do, is only for sale.

305
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,683
- Passepartout, the bag.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:14,926
- We purchase your balloon, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

307
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:18,291
Is really very simple.
We empty out some sand...

308
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:22,166
and we go up.

309
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:24,164
Then we pull this...

310
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:27,890
and with any luck, we come down.

311
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,170
I imagine we release some gas
from the top of the balloon.

312
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:35,332
Gas! I forgot to turn off the gas
in my room.

313
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:39,406
No matter. It will continue to burn,
at your expense.

314
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:40,490
Gentlemen, I think this calls
for a restrained celebration.

315
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:43,607
Guess whas become
of the intrepid Mr. Fogg?

316
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:47,291
- What?
- He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon.

317
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,129
Whas he doing in one of those?

318
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:52,204
Don't ask me, but is here in this paper.

319
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:54,363
I say, he never mentioned
the word balloon.

320
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:55,681
Not very sporting, is it?

321
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:59,891
Rather sly, if you ask me.
I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg.

322
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,407
I don't know,
seems quite resourceful to me.

323
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:05,252
English ingenuity, never say die,
all that sort of thing.

324
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,972
Does it happen to mention
over which Alps he's drifting?

325
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:10,123
No. I assumed they were the ones
in Switzerland.

326
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:11,487
Use your globe, sir.

327
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:14,212
Could be the Maritime Alps,
in the south of France.

328
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:17,649
In which case Fogg's not only
on schedule, but ahead of it.

329
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,689
We stand to lose £20,000.

330
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:22,810
What was that you said
about a celebration, Stuart?

331
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,969
Lf nobody wants this newspaper,
I'll just put it on the table.

332
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,363
The southern perimeter of France.

333
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:41,332
Often and with justification referred to
in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast."

334
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,132
- The moment is propitious for our descent.
- Yes, sir.

335
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:54,126
The gas valve's stuck, I think.
Can you get up there?

336
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:56,166
I'll try it, master.

337
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:18,769
They're speaking some
bizarre foreign tongue.

338
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,366
- Do you understand them?
- Yes.

339
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,523
Ask them how far
we are from Marseilles...

340
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,808
and what conveyance
they have for us to proceed.

341
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:42,292
- Why aren't they speaking French?
- Because we are in Spain, master.

342
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:44,365
- Spain?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,963
Is a long trip to Marseilles.

344
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,683
But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours.

345
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:56,163
Where would we procure such a boat?

346
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:08,725
There is one vessel here.
The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers.

347
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,249
Where would we find this worthy?

348
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,051
He sleeps by day.

349
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,886
But at night,
he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds.

350
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:34,803
- Think thas the man we're looking for?
- I think so, master.

351
00:41:57,413 --> 00:41:59,005
Excuse me, master.

352
00:43:26,973 --> 00:43:28,611
Good evening, sir.

353
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:32,931
It is forbidden to approach
his august personage.

354
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,969
Perhaps you would transmit a message?

355
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:37,965
I would like to engage his yacht
for a quick trip to Marseilles.

356
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:40,009
I will pay whatever he asks.

357
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:55,284
The ship is yours, sir.
Go where you wish without charge.

358
00:43:55,373 --> 00:43:58,604
However, my master
is an aficionado of the bullfight.

359
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,443
That is why he visits here,
to see the festival of the bulls.

360
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,012
I do not understand.

361
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:07,722
He was most interested
in your servans display of cape work.

362
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,964
He would like to see more tomorrow,
at the bullfight.

363
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:14,607
You mean he wants him to enter the ring?

364
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:17,090
But that will be a massacre!

365
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:20,085
Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try.

366
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:37,964
Don't push me.

367
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:43,452
Is the first time I've seen a real bull.

368
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:50,763
Look at the horns. Is not my size.
Try to be nice to me.

369
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,925
My ship is yours.

370
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:17,609
If you leave now
you'll arrive in Marseilles in 10 hours.

371
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,240
The odds are 30-to-1, gentlemen.

372
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:53,164
£50 he doesn't.

373
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:57,917
- What was that, Mr. Vermilyea?
- I said, £50 he doesn't.

374
00:54:58,085 --> 00:54:59,837
And £150 he does.

375
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:09,280
Why delude ourselves?
Even if the odds do go down...

376
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:13,598
<i>we know that Fogg got from Marseilles
to Brindisi in time to catch the Mongolia.</i>

377
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,835
But supposing
he doesn't get to Suez in time?

378
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:17,643
His itinerary's thrown out of schedule.

379
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:21,081
He can't possibly get from Bombay
to Calcutta in time for his connection.

380
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:25,204
Our money's as safe, gentlemen,
as if it were in the Bank of England.

381
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,474
Sorry.

382
00:55:36,405 --> 00:55:39,124
A bulletin, gentlemen. A late bulletin.

383
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:43,164
Mr. Phileas Fogg has arrived at Suez!

384
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,196
- Name, sir?
- Passepartout.

385
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:20,157
- Thank you.
- Here! Just a minute.

386
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:24,958
Where's the gentleman who owns
this passport, this Mr. Phileas Fogg?

387
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:27,639
- My master is staying on board.
- Indeed.

388
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:30,444
He'll have to report in person
to the British Consulate...

389
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:32,436
to establish his identity.

390
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:35,801
- Is that necessary?
- Not necessary, mandatory.

391
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:38,240
Is mandatory. This is different, sir.

392
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:41,954
Mr. Fogg is at lunch now,
but I will give him your message.

393
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:23,159
Hello there.

394
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:26,234
Going sightseeing? Perhaps I can help.

395
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:28,839
I have to buy some clothing for Mr. Fogg.

396
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:31,359
I can show you an excellent place
quite nearby.

397
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:33,242
<i>Monsieur is very kind.</i>

398
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,283
You see, my master and I
came away without our clothes.

399
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,560
Then I take it you left London hastily?

400
00:57:38,645 --> 00:57:41,318
Forty-five minutes after he told me...

401
00:57:41,405 --> 00:57:43,965
- we are off around the world.
- Around the world?

402
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,559
Yes, sir. Around the world in 80 days.

403
00:57:46,645 --> 00:57:48,363
He says is a wager.

404
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,604
But confidentially, between you and me,
I don't believe a word of it.

405
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:54,641
Something else in the wind?

406
00:57:55,085 --> 00:57:58,714
<i>I understand he gave the officers
of the Mongolia a bonus...</i>

407
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:01,239
- to get the ship here ahead of time.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:58:01,325 --> 00:58:03,316
He must be a very rich man.

409
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:07,480
You can't imagine how much money
we carry with us...

410
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:09,920
all in brand-new bank notes.

411
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:12,473
I'm sure you can take good care of him.

412
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:14,954
No doubt you've been
with Mr. Fogg for years.

413
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:16,797
No, sir. On the contrary.

414
00:58:16,885 --> 00:58:19,957
I entered his service
only the day we left London.

415
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:21,273
Indeed.

416
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,438
So he turned up, did he?

417
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:27,518
Yes, and he gave every indication
of being a thoroughly honest fellow.

418
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:29,482
Or a very shrewd article.

419
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:33,154
Here's the description of the robber
I received from London.

420
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:36,797
Yes. It tallies exactly.
What do you propose to do?

421
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:39,194
Notify London to send a warrant
to Bombay...

422
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:43,039
accompany him there and arrest him
the moment he sets foot on British soil.

423
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,683
Very enterprising of you, Fix.

424
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:47,916
A nice ocean voyage
at the expense of Scotland Yard?

425
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:51,156
I beg your pardon, sir.
I see my duty, and I do it.

426
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:52,838
Thank you, sir.

427
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:31,404
I beg pardon, gentlemen, we're expecting
rather hot weather tomorrow...

428
01:00:31,485 --> 01:00:33,715
so I've arranged the menu accordingly:

429
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:36,842
"Cold breast of chicken,
potted meats and brawn...

430
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:39,399
- "curried lamb and rice."
- Capital.

431
01:00:39,805 --> 01:00:42,399
Curry's the only dish
for a chap in this filthy climate.

432
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:44,635
Purifies the blood, tones up the system.

433
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,875
My luncheon
will remain the same, steward.

434
01:00:46,965 --> 01:00:48,603
Kindly adhere to my instructions.

435
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:51,483
Of course, sir.
But all that food on a hot day?

436
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,443
Steward, my Thursday midday meal
has always been...

437
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,323
and will always be hot soup, fried sole...

438
01:00:57,405 --> 01:01:01,762
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding,
baked potatoes, suet pudding and treacle.

439
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,843
<i>Your deal, monsieur.</i>

440
01:01:15,325 --> 01:01:18,920
We meet again.
Feeling the heat a bit, are you?

441
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:21,440
How about a nice lemon squash or a beer?

442
01:01:21,525 --> 01:01:23,436
- Is good.
- Steward.

443
01:01:26,885 --> 01:01:28,841
Bring two lemon squashes.

444
01:01:30,045 --> 01:01:33,082
Great stroke of luck
we happen to be on the same ship.

445
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:35,042
And both going to Bombay.

446
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,878
Yes. A strange coincidence.

447
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:41,915
- Have you made this trip before?
- Yes, often.

448
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:46,633
I'm one of the agents
for the steamship company.

449
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:50,284
- You know India well?
- My dear fellow...

450
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:53,277
I doubt if there are five men
who know it as I do.

451
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:58,120
The mosques, the minarets,
the elephants, the snakes.

452
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:01,882
What about the women?

453
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:06,995
Yes. The women. Superb.

454
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:11,203
- In what way superb?
- Goddesses. Ravishing.

455
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:15,396
But listen, this tour of your master's...

456
01:02:15,725 --> 01:02:18,193
what do you think his real purpose is?

457
01:02:18,285 --> 01:02:21,561
Perhaps is only
a secret diplomatic mission.

458
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:25,156
I tell you, Mr. Fix.
I really know nothing about it.

459
01:02:25,765 --> 01:02:30,395
Don't change the conversation.
Tell me more about these Indian women.

460
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:32,198
Now, let me see.

461
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:36,395
Would you excuse me?
I will be back in a minute.

462
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:51,200
Bombay by dawn tomorrow, Mr. Fogg.
Two days ahead of schedule.

463
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:55,000
- Thas a new record for the run.
- A remarkable achievement, Captain...

464
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:57,804
and one that deserves
adequate recognition.

465
01:02:58,005 --> 01:02:59,643
- My compliments to you.
- Thank you.

466
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:02,637
And to the chief engineer. As arranged.

467
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:03,960
Listen carefully.

468
01:04:04,045 --> 01:04:07,196
Here's the list of the gear we'll need
on our journey to Calcutta.

469
01:04:07,285 --> 01:04:10,641
While you're getting that,
I'll deal with the passports and the tickets.

470
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:14,274
The train leaves at 4:00.
We'll meet at the railway station.

471
01:06:34,805 --> 01:06:37,273
How dare you! Thas a sacred animal!

472
01:07:19,845 --> 01:07:23,963
We've no warrant for this fellow's arrest.
The whole thing is highly irregular.

473
01:07:24,045 --> 01:07:26,559
But he's the culprit, I swear to you.

474
01:07:26,725 --> 01:07:30,513
Wait a moment. I have an idea.
You issue the order for this arrest.

475
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:32,835
What? I couldn't do a thing like that!

476
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:35,644
Not even for a reward of £2,000?

477
01:07:35,965 --> 01:07:38,274
Needless to say, I'd be willing to divide it.

478
01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:41,084
£1,000? No, Mr. Fix.

479
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:42,360
The matter involves London.

480
01:07:42,445 --> 01:07:45,676
And the London office alone
can legally deliver the warrant.

481
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:48,962
Once Fogg's outside British jurisdiction,
I'll never get him.

482
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:53,357
Quite. Good heavens! 4:00. Is tea time.

483
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,515
Yes, I know. But this is a crisis.

484
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,403
Crisis or no,
nothing should interfere with tea.

485
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:05,914
Devil take the man. Where can he be?

486
01:08:06,005 --> 01:08:08,439
Pattering after some woman
or other, I suppose.

487
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:10,516
These foreigners, you know.

488
01:08:14,005 --> 01:08:15,597
Come on, man! Come on!

489
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:32,203
- Thank you.
- There will be no further fiddle-faddle.

490
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:35,634
Years gone...

491
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:38,475
there was a time
when one could scarcely travel...

492
01:12:38,565 --> 01:12:41,284
in this part of the country
without encountering corpses.

493
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:43,276
Those infamous stranglers.

494
01:12:44,085 --> 01:12:46,041
What did you say
the name of the sect was?

495
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,274
Thuggee.

496
01:12:49,045 --> 01:12:51,605
Individual members are known as Thugs.

497
01:12:51,685 --> 01:12:54,324
They worship Kali, the goddess of death.

498
01:12:54,405 --> 01:12:58,956
They slay without discrimination.
Any age, sex, color.

499
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:01,640
How did you finally
manage to stamp them out?

500
01:13:01,725 --> 01:13:03,955
We didn't. Not entirely.

501
01:13:04,285 --> 01:13:07,083
Our constabulary managed to diminish
the number of murders...

502
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:09,804
but we're forced to recognize
the Thuggee still exists.

503
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:14,481
Every few months we come across a few
of the wretches with their ghastly rites.

504
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:20,720
Strange we should stop hereabouts.

505
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:23,883
Timetable makes no mention
of a station in this vicinity.

506
01:13:23,965 --> 01:13:25,398
I have no idea.

507
01:13:25,565 --> 01:13:29,353
I haven't been on this line
since they announced its completion.

508
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,644
Excuse me, sir. What is the difficulty?

509
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:51,041
Difficulty? None whatever.

510
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:53,277
This is the end of the line.

511
01:13:53,365 --> 01:13:55,117
- End of the line?
- Yes.

512
01:13:55,645 --> 01:13:59,604
There's still 50 miles of track to be laid
between here and Allahabad.

513
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,836
The London newspapers announced
the opening of the railway throughout.

514
01:14:02,925 --> 01:14:06,076
<i>Musve been The Daily Telegraph.
Never woulïve read it in The Times.</i>

515
01:14:06,165 --> 01:14:10,363
The fact remains that you sell tickets
from Bombay to Calcutta! Thas fraud.

516
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:13,279
I shall take this up with the Viceroy!

517
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:17,517
The notice in our Bombay station
is quite clearly posted, as it is here:

518
01:14:17,605 --> 01:14:20,483
"Passengers must provide
their own transportation...

519
01:14:20,565 --> 01:14:22,681
"between Kholby and Allahabad."

520
01:14:22,765 --> 01:14:26,121
- Through the bush?
- I'm sorry if this inconveniences.

521
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:27,274
It does indeed.

522
01:14:27,365 --> 01:14:29,720
I happen to be rejoining my brigade,
the 10th Jubbulpore.

523
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:32,160
My friend stands to lose
a considerable sum of money.

524
01:14:32,245 --> 01:14:35,874
Not at all. I made provision for precisely
that sort of eventuality.

525
01:14:35,965 --> 01:14:38,195
You couldn't have foreseen this.

526
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:40,958
No, but I did expect some such obstacle
to arise en route.

527
01:14:41,045 --> 01:14:44,640
And I took the precaution of gaining
two days while crossing the Arabian Sea.

528
01:14:44,725 --> 01:14:47,603
A steamer leaves Calcutta at noon
on the 25th for Hong Kong.

529
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:51,075
Our only problem is to find some form
of conveyance from here to Allahabad.

530
01:14:51,165 --> 01:14:54,680
Other than the oxcart,
nothing can get through that jungle.

531
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,674
- What about an elephant?
- I do know of one...

532
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:00,995
but I doubt if the owner
would part with her.

533
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:03,883
- Why not?
- She sleeps in the house, with the family.

534
01:15:04,245 --> 01:15:05,234
A pet.

535
01:15:08,405 --> 01:15:12,000
£1,000 for an elephant? Ls outrageous!
You've been diddled.

536
01:15:12,085 --> 01:15:15,919
Undoubtedly, but is not often
one needs an elephant in a hurry.

537
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:40,275
- What is that?
- A Royal Bengal Tiger.

538
01:15:40,365 --> 01:15:42,515
They rarely attack an elephant.

539
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:19,044
- What the deuce are you doing?
- Quiet, sir.

540
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:24,114
- Is bad.
- What is it?

541
01:16:24,245 --> 01:16:28,443
Ls a religious procession of some sort.
Rather sticky if they spot us.

542
01:16:31,805 --> 01:16:34,319
I think we had better look into this.

543
01:17:09,765 --> 01:17:12,723
Kali, the goddess of love and death.

544
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:16,241
<i>Sahib, please! Lf they hear our voices
we will be slain.</i>

545
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:30,155
<i>- Suttee,
- What do you mean by that?</i>

546
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,805
A human sacrifice, but a voluntary one.

547
01:17:32,885 --> 01:17:36,400
The lady you've just seen is to be burned
on her husbanïs funeral pyre.

548
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,520
Scoundrels.

549
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:40,403
You actually mean that unfortunate
woman will be burned alive?

550
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:43,238
She's quite resigned to it.
Is a matter of religious belief.

551
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,044
This area's not under British jurisdiction.
Nothing we can do.

552
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,162
<i>Forgive me, sahib. But the lady
does not wish to commit suttee.</i>

553
01:17:49,245 --> 01:17:50,644
- She is being forced.
- What?

554
01:17:50,725 --> 01:17:52,238
Everyone knows of this affair.

555
01:17:52,325 --> 01:17:54,885
Her husband was a rajah
and very influential.

556
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:59,117
- The custom is that she must die with him.
- Where's this murder to take place?

557
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:01,958
The pagoda of Pillaji. Two miles from here.

558
01:18:02,565 --> 01:18:04,044
What if we decided to save her?

559
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:06,844
- You can't interfere with native affairs.
- Why not?

560
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:08,434
Lt isn't done!

561
01:18:08,525 --> 01:18:11,085
My master does things
other people do not, sir.

562
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:13,042
Do you think you can you rescue Aouda?

563
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:15,559
<i>- Is that the lady's name?
- Yes, sahib. Aouda.</i>

564
01:18:15,685 --> 01:18:20,076
Very fine person. Very beautiful.
She was educated in England.

565
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:22,514
That decides it.

566
01:18:22,605 --> 01:18:24,596
General, we place ourselves
under your command.

567
01:18:24,685 --> 01:18:27,404
Right. Now, our first step
is to reconnoiter.

568
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:30,994
Follow me.

569
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,796
There are guards all about the temple.

570
01:18:58,885 --> 01:19:01,957
- I can't seem to find an opening.
- And the princess?

571
01:19:02,045 --> 01:19:06,482
- Inside. Surrounded by armed men.
- What course would you suggest?

572
01:19:06,565 --> 01:19:09,079
Simple. Outflank the beggars.

573
01:19:11,005 --> 01:19:14,395
Here's the temple. No, here.

574
01:19:15,045 --> 01:19:16,922
Here's the funeral pyre.

575
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:21,601
We create a distractionary action here,
start a sortie here.

576
01:19:21,725 --> 01:19:24,364
- General, I have a plan.
- Please!

577
01:19:25,405 --> 01:19:27,714
Then we infiltrate
the guards from the rear.

578
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:31,514
- Excellent.
- Exactly. Only one problem.

579
01:19:32,285 --> 01:19:35,436
This plan can't possibly
work with less than 75 men.

580
01:19:35,925 --> 01:19:37,483
So speaking as a strategist...

581
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:40,033
I should say
our position here is untenable.

582
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:43,117
Whatever the odds,
I'm determined to abstract that woman.

583
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:45,924
Even though we're only four.
Passepartout...

584
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,276
Now where the devil is he?

585
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:37,278
Hurry up! Come on!

586
01:21:38,805 --> 01:21:41,763
- Gentlemen, you have rescued me!
- No demonstrations of gratitude.

587
01:21:41,845 --> 01:21:43,563
Allow me to help you.

588
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:58,158
"Speechless at the violation
of a native temple...

589
01:21:58,245 --> 01:22:00,201
"and the abduction of an Indian princess...

590
01:22:00,285 --> 01:22:03,721
"by Mr. Phileas Fogg,
the authorities have arrested him."

591
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:09,244
"An Indian princess." Lucky dog!

592
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:13,204
An absolute scandal, according to this.
The whole peninsula's up in arms.

593
01:22:13,325 --> 01:22:16,203
Wonder what she's like.
A handsome creature, I'll be bound.

594
01:22:16,285 --> 01:22:18,276
Always thought Fogg
had a twinkle in his eye.

595
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:21,198
Handsome or not,
this barging about a native temple...

596
01:22:21,285 --> 01:22:23,082
with one's boots on is a serious matter.

597
01:22:23,165 --> 01:22:26,043
Coulïve been, if he hadn't posted bail
and caught the next ship.

598
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:29,322
I think our colleague's a good bit
cleverer than we supposed.

599
01:22:29,405 --> 01:22:31,680
A devious type, I'd rather say.

600
01:22:31,765 --> 01:22:34,120
<i>Let me see, if he's on the S, S, Rangoon...</i>

601
01:22:34,285 --> 01:22:36,879
he must be halfway to Hong Kong by now.

602
01:22:42,485 --> 01:22:43,964
Somewhere here.

603
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:58,399
So I did the only decent thing
a man could do.

604
01:23:58,485 --> 01:24:00,999
- You mean...
- Yes, I finessed my queen of hearts...

605
01:24:01,085 --> 01:24:03,997
and forced Finch-Tattersall
to sacrifice his ace.

606
01:24:04,085 --> 01:24:05,518
It was a tense moment.

607
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:07,516
I wish you'd seen
Lord Dudley's expression.

608
01:24:07,605 --> 01:24:11,234
Poor fellow went dead white.
Bit clean through his pipe stem.

609
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:15,880
- But I'm afraid I've bored you.
- How can you say that, Mr. Fogg?

610
01:24:15,965 --> 01:24:18,354
I don't think in my entire life...

611
01:24:19,565 --> 01:24:22,318
Thas the most enthralling story
I've ever heard.

612
01:24:22,405 --> 01:24:25,317
You really mean that?
I'm most awfully pleased.

613
01:24:25,525 --> 01:24:29,484
- Is so personal and yet dramatic.
- Thas exactly the way I feel about it!

614
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,442
I had no idea
you were so keen about whist.

615
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,597
I adore it.
There is a kind of precision about it.

616
01:24:35,205 --> 01:24:37,765
I've always admired men
who are precise...

617
01:24:37,845 --> 01:24:40,075
who have a sense of order and discipline.

618
01:24:40,165 --> 01:24:42,759
- You don't say that?
- Yes, for example...

619
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:46,523
I simply cannot abide
a man who isn't punctual.

620
01:24:47,245 --> 01:24:49,805
Is extraordinary how well you put it.

621
01:24:49,925 --> 01:24:53,884
We have so little time
in our brief mortal span.

622
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:57,355
My dear princess,
I must ask your forgiveness.

623
01:24:57,445 --> 01:24:59,913
- Why, whatever for?
- I completely forgot to...

624
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:02,280
offer my condolences
upon your bereavement.

625
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:04,037
- What?
- To extend my sympathy...

626
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:06,719
for your anguish at this time of grief.

627
01:25:06,805 --> 01:25:10,434
- But I don't feel any grief, Mr. Fogg.
- None at all?

628
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:13,959
You see, I was a wife in name only.

629
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:17,555
I met the late rajah exactly once,
at the age of seven...

630
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,921
before my parents sent me
to England for my education.

631
01:25:21,005 --> 01:25:22,882
You never saw him again?

632
01:25:24,045 --> 01:25:25,160
Never.

633
01:25:27,525 --> 01:25:31,643
Would you care to hear about the time
I drew a flush hand in diamonds?

634
01:25:32,405 --> 01:25:34,316
Lf you'd care to confide in me.

635
01:25:43,485 --> 01:25:46,955
Is Mr. Fogg always so proper,
haughty and formal?

636
01:25:47,045 --> 01:25:49,605
<i>Believe me, Madame,
I know nothing about him...</i>

637
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:52,153
except that he lives by this.

638
01:25:54,485 --> 01:25:56,203
Have there been any women in his life?

639
01:25:56,285 --> 01:26:00,198
I assume he must have had a mother,
but I am not certain.

640
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:04,113
Perhaps he has some secret sorrow,
some love who jilted him.

641
01:26:04,485 --> 01:26:08,603
He has only one love. Cards. Whist.

642
01:26:08,885 --> 01:26:13,436
He thinks of nothing but whist,
morning, noon, and night.

643
01:26:15,405 --> 01:26:16,679
Very interesting.

644
01:26:45,005 --> 01:26:48,998
Yes, he's a cool article, Mr. Talley.
A very unpredictable cove.

645
01:26:49,325 --> 01:26:52,362
Just when you think you've cornered him,
he gives you the slip.

646
01:26:52,445 --> 01:26:55,517
- Got you puzzled, has he?
- Yes, by jingo, he has.

647
01:26:56,325 --> 01:27:00,034
Look at this heathen young woman,
for instance, this Mrs. Aouda.

648
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:01,524
I know my man.

649
01:27:01,765 --> 01:27:04,325
And I tell you,
she don't fit into the pattern.

650
01:27:04,645 --> 01:27:07,318
He was down here, you know,
about an hour ago.

651
01:27:07,405 --> 01:27:08,520
He was?

652
01:27:08,845 --> 01:27:11,598
- What did he want?
- This, that, and the other.

653
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:28,514
He was quizzing me
about steamships out of Hong Kong.

654
01:27:28,605 --> 01:27:29,754
- For where?
- Yokohama.

655
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:31,563
We're due at Hong Kong
at noon tomorrow.

656
01:27:31,645 --> 01:27:34,000
<i>He sails on the S, S, Carnatic
at 8:00 the next day.</i>

657
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,719
Thas what he thinks,
but I'll nail him this time...

658
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:38,602
you can pledge your last farthing on that.

659
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:41,040
You didn't do so well in Calcutta,
according to you.

660
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,274
What could I do?

661
01:27:42,365 --> 01:27:45,675
I got him and his servans bail
set at £1,000 apiece.

662
01:27:45,765 --> 01:27:48,040
And he hands it over
without batting a lash.

663
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:50,275
If that blasted warrant had only arrived...

664
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:54,040
<i>Cheer up. You've got 20 hours to get him
in Hong Kong before the Carnatic sails.</i>

665
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:57,800
Yes, sir, I'll lag the blighter there
if I have to turn out the Governor to do it!

666
01:27:57,885 --> 01:28:02,322
Bulldog tenacity, Mr. Fix,
thas the spirit that built an empire.

667
01:28:17,845 --> 01:28:19,881
"134 Lower Lascar Row, Victoria."

668
01:28:19,965 --> 01:28:23,162
We will now go in search
of your uncle, Mr. Cominjee.

669
01:28:36,805 --> 01:28:39,478
Here, follow that rickshaw, chop-chop!

670
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,399
Here's a pretty kettle of fish.

671
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:09,364
A man trying to run a business
and the door's locked. I wonder what...

672
01:29:09,685 --> 01:29:13,041
Boss man here? Him back pretty soon?

673
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:16,755
I should say the probabilities
are strongly against it.

674
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:19,520
I beg your pardon. Where is Mr. Cominjee?

675
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:21,004
In Holland, I believe.

676
01:29:21,085 --> 01:29:24,634
He amassed a considerable fortune
by means I shall not attempt to describe...

677
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:27,159
and has retired to Amsterdam
to raise tulips.

678
01:29:27,245 --> 01:29:29,998
He might at least have left a card
on his door to that effect.

679
01:29:30,085 --> 01:29:34,158
The gentleman was quite illiterate, sir,
and moreover, he was pressed for time.

680
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:37,396
He retired 10 minutes
before the constables arrived.

681
01:29:39,805 --> 01:29:41,955
That alters things quite a bit.

682
01:29:42,045 --> 01:29:45,162
Obviously the princess
cannot remain here, alone, in Hong Kong.

683
01:29:45,245 --> 01:29:48,999
- There seems to be only one alternative.
- I know what you're going to say...

684
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,360
but please don't send me back to India.

685
01:29:51,445 --> 01:29:54,403
If you will excuse me, sir,
I agree with the princess.

686
01:29:54,485 --> 01:29:56,999
You know she has suffered very much.

687
01:29:57,085 --> 01:30:00,441
Your fears are groundless. I have
no intention of returning her to India.

688
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:03,756
She is our responsibility
and will continue with us to Europe.

689
01:30:04,285 --> 01:30:07,721
I'll escort her to the Royal Court Hotel
and find accommodation for tonight.

690
01:30:07,805 --> 01:30:09,284
You will buy the tickets.

691
01:30:09,365 --> 01:30:13,278
<i>Three cabins on the Carnatic,
sailing tomorrow morning for Yokohama.</i>

692
01:30:13,365 --> 01:30:16,198
- And don't dilly-dally.
- Not dilly-dally.

693
01:30:26,285 --> 01:30:29,004
Here, you, follow that ostrich!

694
01:30:34,605 --> 01:30:35,879
Giddy up!

695
01:31:00,845 --> 01:31:04,042
<i>Strike me, is my old friend
off the Rangoon.</i>

696
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,434
Hello, sir. Excuse me one minute.

697
01:31:07,165 --> 01:31:09,315
<i>Three cabins
on the steamer Carnatic, please.</i>

698
01:31:09,405 --> 01:31:12,363
Yes, sir. There's been a slight change
in the schedule, sir.

699
01:31:12,445 --> 01:31:15,243
She sails tonight
instead of in the morning as planned.

700
01:31:15,325 --> 01:31:17,839
- I didn't know, but all the better.
- Thank you.

701
01:31:21,245 --> 01:31:22,644
That will be all.

702
01:31:23,565 --> 01:31:27,524
- I trust that you will be comfortable here.
- Yes, thank you. I'm sure I will.

703
01:31:27,605 --> 01:31:29,960
Is very kind of you
to concern yourself about me.

704
01:31:30,045 --> 01:31:31,034
Not at all.

705
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:34,879
Since you are temporarily alone, the least
I can do is look after your welfare.

706
01:31:34,965 --> 01:31:36,842
I'm afraid I must have been a burden.

707
01:31:36,925 --> 01:31:40,281
Quite the reverse, I assure you.
Your company has been most welcome.

708
01:31:40,365 --> 01:31:44,074
I only wish I could express
my infinite gratitude.

709
01:31:45,525 --> 01:31:48,358
Please, you shouldn't do that sort of thing.

710
01:31:49,445 --> 01:31:53,120
Mr. Fogg, why must you be so British?

711
01:31:54,525 --> 01:31:57,323
- Madam, I am what I am.
- No.

712
01:31:57,965 --> 01:32:01,241
You're kind and warm and generous.

713
01:32:03,525 --> 01:32:07,837
Would you care to join me on the veranda?
They serve an outstanding lemon squash.

714
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:11,404
If you wish.

715
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:19,076
- I see you're leaving Hong Kong.
- Correct, my friend.

716
01:32:19,165 --> 01:32:22,316
- And 12 hours ahead of time.
- Think of that.

717
01:32:22,405 --> 01:32:24,521
Nothing stops you and Mr. Fogg, does it?

718
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:27,642
- What name do you want on these tickets?
- Just copy these.

719
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:30,762
Look here,
since we may not see each other again...

720
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:33,564
why don't we have
a little farewell drink together?

721
01:32:33,645 --> 01:32:34,714
Good idea.

722
01:32:35,885 --> 01:32:37,318
Nice and cozy.

723
01:32:40,325 --> 01:32:41,599
Over here.

724
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:46,801
Remember, we don't have very much time.
I have to get my tickets.

725
01:32:46,885 --> 01:32:50,161
Nonsense. We'll send a boy for them.
Here, you.

726
01:32:52,845 --> 01:32:56,394
You know the Transpacific
Steamship Company in Canton Road?

727
01:32:56,485 --> 01:32:59,283
- Near post office?
- Yes. Send someone over there.

728
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,959
Pick up tickets for Mr. Passepartout.

729
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:04,161
- Passport, too?
- Yes.

730
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:07,564
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, what will it be?

731
01:33:07,645 --> 01:33:09,636
- A lemon squash.
- Poppycock.

732
01:33:09,725 --> 01:33:12,637
I said I'd buy you a drink,
and I meant a man's drink.

733
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:16,115
All right, anything you want,
but not too strong, please.

734
01:33:16,565 --> 01:33:20,194
My friend and I will have
a Hong Kong Snickersnee.

735
01:33:22,645 --> 01:33:26,240
- What is that?
- Is indescribable. Liquid music.

736
01:33:26,325 --> 01:33:30,796
It warms the heart, fires the imagination,
broadens the horizon...

737
01:33:31,925 --> 01:33:34,120
- Whas happening?
- Local color.

738
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:36,958
A sort of a show they put on
for the tourists.

739
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:38,273
Looks very real to me.

740
01:33:38,365 --> 01:33:41,198
They're just boisterous children.
Ignore them.

741
01:33:42,405 --> 01:33:44,202
Now, look here, Passepartout.

742
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:47,516
You've been square with me
and I intend to behave the same.

743
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:51,154
Do you still think I'm an agent
for those fellows at the Reform Club?

744
01:33:51,245 --> 01:33:53,884
- No, but I don't know what you are.
- Then I'll tell you.

745
01:33:53,965 --> 01:33:56,001
I'm a professional detective.

746
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:59,714
And I'm in pursuit of a very cunning,
very slippery criminal.

747
01:33:59,805 --> 01:34:00,760
Who?

748
01:34:00,845 --> 01:34:04,315
Phileas Fogg, Esq.,
of Savile Row, London.

749
01:34:04,685 --> 01:34:07,518
- What? My master?
- The same.

750
01:34:14,045 --> 01:34:16,036
What do you want from me?

751
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:21,156
Time. Just help me delay him 24 hours
till my warrant arrives.

752
01:34:21,565 --> 01:34:24,523
All I need is a little cooperation
on your part.

753
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:28,361
A little cooperation?
Do you think I'd betray Mr. Fogg?

754
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:30,922
I don't care how much money
you offer me...

755
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:34,680
All right, you needn't get angry.
I don't blame you, in a way.

756
01:34:34,765 --> 01:34:38,599
It shows you're a loyal
and trustworthy chap, and I respect that.

757
01:34:38,765 --> 01:34:42,963
Here. Les have a little libation
on the altar of friendship.

758
01:34:44,605 --> 01:34:48,041
You insult my master.
I don't want to drink with you.

759
01:34:48,525 --> 01:34:50,436
Rot. You told me where you stood.

760
01:34:50,525 --> 01:34:53,801
And I say bravo to a man
who sticks to his principles.

761
01:34:53,885 --> 01:34:57,161
Here. Confusion to the enemies
of the Crown.

762
01:35:03,925 --> 01:35:05,597
I can't believe it.

763
01:37:05,525 --> 01:37:08,517
Honorable gentleman
feeling better this morning?

764
01:37:09,485 --> 01:37:11,396
What are you doing here?

765
01:37:14,205 --> 01:37:16,241
Why is the hotel moving this way?

766
01:37:16,365 --> 01:37:20,961
<i>What? Steamship, not hotel.
You're on board the steamship Carnatic.</i>

767
01:37:23,325 --> 01:37:26,123
Yes. We go Shanghai,
then we go Yokohama.

768
01:37:35,565 --> 01:37:36,759
Finished?

769
01:37:39,405 --> 01:37:41,965
- Where is Mr. Fogg's cabin?
- Next door.

770
01:37:42,045 --> 01:37:44,001
But Mr. Fogg not on board.

771
01:37:46,085 --> 01:37:49,157
- What about the princess?
- Princess? No, you come alone.

772
01:37:49,245 --> 01:37:51,236
Police, they find ticket in your pocket.

773
01:37:51,325 --> 01:37:53,759
Carry you here. You sleep like baby.

774
01:37:55,445 --> 01:37:59,597
I betrayed my master. Everything is lost.

775
01:38:04,205 --> 01:38:05,877
What about my money?

776
01:38:05,965 --> 01:38:09,514
- They robbed me, too.
- Is bad.

777
01:38:09,805 --> 01:38:11,363
You not like Yokohama.

778
01:38:11,445 --> 01:38:14,357
You not have money,
Yokohama not like you.

779
01:38:18,285 --> 01:38:20,037
I betrayed my master.

780
01:38:21,005 --> 01:38:23,394
<i>My good man,
I realize the Carnatic couldn't wait.</i>

781
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:25,760
The point now
is what other vessel can we get?

782
01:38:25,845 --> 01:38:28,200
Nothing that could make
the voyage to Yokohama, sir.

783
01:38:28,285 --> 01:38:30,116
No steam packet, tug, or lighter?

784
01:38:30,205 --> 01:38:32,116
There must be something
in a port this size.

785
01:38:32,205 --> 01:38:34,196
At the moment, not a thing.

786
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:46,516
Good morning, Mr. Fogg.

787
01:38:46,765 --> 01:38:49,518
<i>- I'm afraid I don't...
- We traveled together on the Rangoon.</i>

788
01:38:49,605 --> 01:38:52,722
- My name is Fix.
- Yes, Mr. Fix. How do you do?

789
01:38:53,445 --> 01:38:56,721
- I believe you know my manservant?
- Very slightly.

790
01:38:57,085 --> 01:39:00,555
- Why? Has something happened to him?
- The fellow seems to have disappeared.

791
01:39:00,645 --> 01:39:04,843
- I'm sorry to hear that. He's a nice chap.
- I shall have to inform the police.

792
01:39:04,925 --> 01:39:07,962
I shouldn't do that if I were you.
He'll turn up.

793
01:39:08,885 --> 01:39:11,399
- Missed your boat?
- Yes.

794
01:39:11,485 --> 01:39:14,602
- There'll be another along in a week.
- I shall not be here.

795
01:39:14,685 --> 01:39:16,676
- No?
- Yokohama is my destination...

796
01:39:16,765 --> 01:39:19,199
I shall get there if I have to swim.

797
01:39:25,645 --> 01:39:28,205
Are we on a direct course for Yokohama?

798
01:39:28,285 --> 01:39:31,118
<i>The Carnatic is bound first for Shanghai.</i>

799
01:39:31,205 --> 01:39:33,321
We may arrive in Yokohama
the day after her.

800
01:39:33,405 --> 01:39:36,920
<i>We're still in plenty of time to catch
the General Grant for San Francisco.</i>

801
01:43:39,205 --> 01:43:42,675
Very sporting of you
to let me share your craft, Mr. Fogg.

802
01:43:43,085 --> 01:43:45,804
Nonsense.
Anything for a fellow Englishman.

803
01:43:45,885 --> 01:43:49,321
I trust your cousin in San Francisco
will be better by the time we arrive.

804
01:43:49,645 --> 01:43:52,205
- Poor old Marmaduke.
- Thank you.

805
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:54,753
Princess.

806
01:43:55,645 --> 01:43:56,919
Fish, Fix?

807
01:44:08,365 --> 01:44:12,324
Steady, Mr. Fix. Fujiyama ahead.
We'll be in Yokohama by morning.

808
01:44:26,965 --> 01:44:28,478
<i>There's the Carnatic.</i>

809
01:44:28,565 --> 01:44:31,841
<i>I imagine that steamship just behind her
is the General Grant.</i>

810
01:44:31,925 --> 01:44:34,120
Now the only thing missing
is Passepartout.

811
01:44:34,205 --> 01:44:36,673
The police in Hong Kong
said they put him on board.

812
01:44:36,765 --> 01:44:39,438
They also said he was penniless.
So we may have one clue.

813
01:44:39,525 --> 01:44:42,164
The man is a jack of all trades.
He's told me a few of them.

814
01:44:42,245 --> 01:44:44,361
We might be able
to find him by deduction.

815
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:47,005
That is the new science
employed by our British police.

816
01:44:47,085 --> 01:44:51,237
Really? I learn something useful
every moment I'm with you, Mr. Fogg.

817
01:44:52,965 --> 01:44:54,876
I hope you find your man.

818
01:45:53,965 --> 01:45:56,081
Two orchestra stalls, please.

819
01:46:15,685 --> 01:46:17,277
Great Scott. Look.

820
01:46:22,245 --> 01:46:23,200
Master!

821
01:46:30,765 --> 01:46:34,155
- Master, what genius to find me.
- Merely logic. Now come along.

822
01:46:34,245 --> 01:46:36,918
<i>The General Grant is preparing to sail,
and we haven't a moment to lose.</i>

823
01:46:54,405 --> 01:46:55,394
What a pity.

824
01:46:55,485 --> 01:46:58,363
Mr. Fogg has already organized
his whist game.

825
01:47:00,925 --> 01:47:03,155
Princess, Mr. Fix is a detective.

826
01:47:03,245 --> 01:47:05,759
He thinks Mr. Fogg has robbed
the Bank of England.

827
01:47:05,845 --> 01:47:07,756
Nothing escapes Mr. Fogg.

828
01:47:08,045 --> 01:47:11,958
But Mr. Fix won't delay us.
We're out of British jurisdiction now.

829
01:52:00,786 --> 01:52:02,299
He's in America.

830
01:52:36,626 --> 01:52:39,379
Don't tell me about men. They're all alike.

831
01:52:39,466 --> 01:52:41,343
I wouldn't trust the best of them.

832
01:52:41,426 --> 01:52:44,384
This here Phileas Fogg,
I'm sure he's different.

833
01:52:44,786 --> 01:52:48,301
It takes a gallant, adventurous bloke
to dash around the world like that.

834
01:52:48,386 --> 01:52:49,785
Don't be so soppy.

835
01:52:49,866 --> 01:52:53,461
He's probably running away
from some housemaid he ruined.

836
01:52:53,546 --> 01:52:57,619
You do have a horrid mind, Cora.
I think he's terribly romantic.

837
01:52:58,066 --> 01:53:00,341
- They say he's so good-looking.
- Rot.

838
01:53:00,546 --> 01:53:04,778
I don't care if he's Venus, Adonis
and Mercury both.

839
01:53:04,906 --> 01:53:07,704
He'll never do it in 80 days.

840
01:53:07,786 --> 01:53:10,744
- I bet you 10 bob he don't.
- I'll take that.

841
01:53:11,706 --> 01:53:13,264
Here's my money.

842
01:53:13,826 --> 01:53:15,862
- Where's yours?
- Here it is.

843
01:53:16,666 --> 01:53:20,500
- Whas up?
- Call a bobby. I've been robbed.

844
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:40,497
The voice of all our citizens!

845
01:53:40,586 --> 01:53:44,625
- I ask you, who will you vote for?
- Mandiboy!

846
01:53:45,466 --> 01:53:46,979
Mandiboy is our man!

847
01:55:10,026 --> 01:55:11,937
Please, Mr. Fogg, let me watch.

848
01:55:15,066 --> 01:55:17,216
Is this a religious spectacle?

849
01:55:17,786 --> 01:55:20,380
Some kind of an election, I would judge.

850
01:55:21,306 --> 01:55:24,184
Perhaps they are creating a new president.

851
01:55:24,946 --> 01:55:28,018
Whatever it is,
I suggest that we move over there.

852
01:55:51,546 --> 01:55:53,821
Bye-bye!

853
01:56:45,786 --> 01:56:47,219
Thank you, sir.

854
01:56:57,026 --> 01:57:00,098
Why don't you eat with a fork
like everybody else?

855
01:57:03,066 --> 01:57:05,660
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

856
01:57:08,466 --> 01:57:11,139
Thank you. Is good.

857
01:57:14,626 --> 01:57:15,820
For you.

858
01:57:17,786 --> 01:57:19,538
- Is good.
- For you.

859
01:57:28,706 --> 01:57:30,185
Do you like it?

860
01:57:31,826 --> 01:57:34,260
- I'll eat it later.
- Scrambled eggs.

861
01:57:44,226 --> 01:57:48,299
How many times did I have to tell you
to stay out of here, you donkey? Come on.

862
01:57:48,386 --> 01:57:49,705
Louder.

863
01:58:00,146 --> 01:58:01,295
Looking for someone?

864
01:58:01,386 --> 01:58:04,264
Yes, a small, dark fellow.
He wandered in a few moments ago.

865
01:58:04,346 --> 01:58:07,702
Could be almost anybody.
Sit down and describe him to me.

866
01:58:07,786 --> 01:58:11,176
- I'm afraid I can't. I'm in a hurry.
- Never be in a hurry.

867
01:58:11,266 --> 01:58:12,984
You'll miss the best parts in life.

868
01:58:13,066 --> 01:58:16,103
Madam, you don't understand.
I'm looking for my man.

869
01:58:16,186 --> 01:58:17,335
So am I.

870
01:58:18,786 --> 01:58:20,981
Mr. Fogg, there's Passepartout.

871
01:58:27,386 --> 01:58:30,139
- Put down that chicken and listen to me.
- Yes, master.

872
01:58:30,226 --> 01:58:32,740
This is a primitive country.
We'll need some protection.

873
01:58:32,826 --> 01:58:35,738
- I have this.
- Nothing so medieval. A brace of pistols.

874
01:58:35,826 --> 01:58:37,464
- Pistols?
- Nothing extravagant.

875
01:58:37,546 --> 01:58:39,457
- Oh, no, sir.
- And you have 47 minutes.

876
01:58:39,546 --> 01:58:42,060
- The train leaves on the hour.
- I shall be there.

877
01:58:45,386 --> 01:58:48,776
- I've told you, don't spoil the natives.
- Yes, sir.

878
01:58:56,266 --> 01:58:57,984
Still in a hurry?

879
01:58:59,586 --> 01:59:03,056
I thought the English were a calm,
dreamy sort of people.

880
01:59:03,826 --> 01:59:06,704
Listen, you. Get out and stay out.

881
01:59:06,906 --> 01:59:09,739
If I catch you here again
I'll cut you up in a thousand pieces.

882
01:59:09,826 --> 01:59:13,182
That won't be necessary, I assure you.
I'm just leaving.

883
01:59:25,466 --> 01:59:28,424
An unexpected pleasure
to meet you here, Mr. Fogg.

884
01:59:28,506 --> 01:59:32,101
- Did you have an enjoyable crossing?
- We didn't see much of you aboard ship.

885
01:59:32,186 --> 01:59:35,337
<i>Yes, I was a victim of mal de mer,
I'm sorry to say.</i>

886
01:59:35,426 --> 01:59:39,055
You won't be lingering
in this sort of a hubbub much longer.

887
01:59:39,226 --> 01:59:43,265
- Are you taking the transcontinental train?
- Yes, the very next one. Are you?

888
01:59:43,346 --> 01:59:46,224
- Yes.
- How's your cousin, the one who was ill?

889
01:59:46,586 --> 01:59:48,178
Yes, poor old lady.

890
01:59:48,266 --> 01:59:51,064
She didn't trust the doctors here.
She's gone on to New York.

891
01:59:51,146 --> 01:59:53,819
Thought your cousin was a man.
I remember the name Marmaduke.

892
01:59:53,906 --> 01:59:57,342
Angelica Marmaduke. Lovely old lady.

893
01:59:57,466 --> 01:59:59,377
For a good smoke, try these, gentlemen.

894
01:59:59,466 --> 02:00:02,742
For a good government,
vote for Lucius P. Mandiboy.

895
02:00:03,546 --> 02:00:05,264
Thank you, no.
I only smoke my own blend.

896
02:00:05,346 --> 02:00:06,540
You do, do you?

897
02:00:06,746 --> 02:00:09,465
You don't want to befoul your lips
with a plebeian cigar?

898
02:00:09,546 --> 02:00:12,458
I just prefer what my own tobacconist
compounds for me.

899
02:00:12,546 --> 02:00:15,743
Sweet spirits of niter,
aren't you the tender bud.

900
02:00:15,826 --> 02:00:19,375
Tell me, Percy, who you voting for?
Camerfield or Mandiboy?

901
02:00:19,466 --> 02:00:21,184
Neither. I'm a foreign visitor...

902
02:00:21,266 --> 02:00:23,222
and therefore unconcerned
about who triumphs.

903
02:00:23,306 --> 02:00:27,060
I'll be a ring-tailed sidewinder,
if you don't raise my gorge.

904
02:00:27,226 --> 02:00:30,423
Yes sirree Bob!
I'll be a dad-blamed polecat...

905
02:00:30,546 --> 02:00:34,425
if you aren't about as ornery a specimen
as ever I clapped my eyes on.

906
02:00:35,106 --> 02:00:38,496
What kind of foreigner are you?
Maybe a hootchy-kootchy dancer?

907
02:00:38,586 --> 02:00:41,020
- Unhand that lady, sir.
- Why don't you make me?

908
02:00:41,106 --> 02:00:44,894
- I will, without further invitation.
- Why, you dirty...

909
02:00:51,106 --> 02:00:52,585
Let us proceed.

910
02:02:34,586 --> 02:02:37,464
- Now what is the delay?
- Indians. But they're peaceful Indians.

911
02:02:37,546 --> 02:02:40,014
You can tell that
by the peace pipes they're smoking.

912
02:02:40,106 --> 02:02:43,018
Further down the line,
they're not so friendly.

913
02:04:14,826 --> 02:04:18,375
Is the entire American population
in the way of this train?

914
02:05:36,226 --> 02:05:38,342
These American trains, quite impossible.

915
02:05:38,426 --> 02:05:40,223
Yes, sir. I go, master.

916
02:05:53,426 --> 02:05:56,498
She'll never take the weight of this train.
We better go back.

917
02:05:57,666 --> 02:05:59,258
Whas all the fuss here, boys?

918
02:05:59,346 --> 02:06:02,543
Can't you fellows run a railroad
without stopping every five minutes?

919
02:06:02,626 --> 02:06:05,265
That bridge
won't hardly hold a locomotive.

920
02:06:05,346 --> 02:06:08,782
Why, hang me for a sheep-stealing
son of a tarantula...

921
02:06:08,866 --> 02:06:11,983
if you ain't a pack
of yellow-bellied milksops.

922
02:06:12,226 --> 02:06:15,059
- Am I right, scout?
- Yes, sir, you're right.

923
02:06:15,866 --> 02:06:19,905
- No, I ain't chancing it, fellows.
- Here, take a snort of this 40-rod.

924
02:06:19,986 --> 02:06:23,979
Back up your old teakettle there,
and shoot her over at 30 miles an hour.

925
02:06:30,786 --> 02:06:31,741
Let her roll!

926
02:06:31,826 --> 02:06:35,136
Thas the spirit, partner.
Bear down on that throttle.

927
02:07:42,906 --> 02:07:45,466
Now thas what I call
a proper rate of speed.

928
02:08:14,746 --> 02:08:16,862
I'll be a rattlesnake's uncle.

929
02:08:16,946 --> 02:08:19,824
Thought you'd run away,
you yellow-bellied lime juicer.

930
02:08:19,946 --> 02:08:23,700
- Hit a man with an iron bar, will you?
- Spades are trumps, I believe.

931
02:08:23,786 --> 02:08:27,142
"Spades are trumps, I believe."
My dear Algernon, really.

932
02:08:27,666 --> 02:08:30,260
- Be so good as to play.
- "Be so good as to play."

933
02:08:30,346 --> 02:08:32,940
Gracious. Why don't you play
a man's game?

934
02:08:33,026 --> 02:08:34,823
Poker, red dog, euchre.

935
02:08:35,226 --> 02:08:37,137
Want me to learn you how, Algie boy?

936
02:08:37,226 --> 02:08:39,820
Or should I learn you how to fight fair?

937
02:08:40,026 --> 02:08:41,744
Would you pardon me?

938
02:08:43,146 --> 02:08:46,775
Sir, you are an insolent bully
and I demand satisfaction at once.

939
02:08:47,986 --> 02:08:52,025
Mind moving into the other car, please?
Lll only be a minute or so.

940
02:08:55,506 --> 02:08:58,339
Now, don't miss, boys,
you can damage the woodwork.

941
02:08:58,426 --> 02:09:01,020
The company's liable
to take it out of my salary.

942
02:09:01,146 --> 02:09:04,377
- Ready, or do you want to holler uncle?
- I'm ready.

943
02:09:04,466 --> 02:09:07,538
We will count to six together,
turn, and fire at will.

944
02:09:07,626 --> 02:09:08,854
- Now?
- Now.

945
02:09:09,786 --> 02:09:13,142
One, two, three, four...

946
02:09:13,666 --> 02:09:15,145
five, six.

947
02:09:21,986 --> 02:09:23,305
Take this.

948
02:09:27,066 --> 02:09:28,294
Redskins!

949
02:09:35,506 --> 02:09:38,464
Thanks, partner. You may be a foreigner,
but you're true-blue.

950
02:10:42,546 --> 02:10:44,138
Are you all right?

951
02:10:44,346 --> 02:10:47,543
I'm all right,
but look what they've done to my coat.

952
02:10:49,266 --> 02:10:51,177
The train is running away.

953
02:10:51,746 --> 02:10:53,623
They must have got
the engineer and fireman.

954
02:10:53,706 --> 02:10:54,695
What do you suggest?

955
02:10:54,786 --> 02:10:57,220
Fort Kearney's just ahead.
Thas where the cavalry is.

956
02:10:57,306 --> 02:11:01,094
- But we'll pass right through at this rate.
- Somebody's got to stop the train.

957
02:12:59,186 --> 02:13:01,541
One of us must get to Fort Kearney.

958
02:13:15,546 --> 02:13:16,820
I'll try.

959
02:15:56,426 --> 02:15:58,781
Poor Passepartout. Not a trace of him.

960
02:15:58,866 --> 02:16:01,300
Everyone else seems to be accounted for.

961
02:16:01,386 --> 02:16:03,342
There's no sign of your valet.

962
02:16:03,746 --> 02:16:05,976
I'm afraid he's fallen into the hands
of the Sioux.

963
02:16:06,066 --> 02:16:09,183
It was a deliberate sacrifice
to save the rest of us.

964
02:16:09,466 --> 02:16:12,185
- What will they do to him?
- The Sioux are pretty merciless.

965
02:16:12,266 --> 02:16:14,336
You've heard about their tortures.

966
02:16:14,426 --> 02:16:16,781
Colonel, we must send
a rescue party at once.

967
02:16:17,186 --> 02:16:18,585
Excuse me, mister.

968
02:16:20,146 --> 02:16:22,614
I know it sounds kind of heartless...

969
02:16:23,386 --> 02:16:24,660
but we can't hold the train.

970
02:16:24,746 --> 02:16:28,102
Thas a minor consideration.
A man's life is at stake.

971
02:16:29,706 --> 02:16:32,345
Any of you want to volunteer
for a raid against the Sioux?

972
02:16:32,426 --> 02:16:34,144
- I will, sir!
- I will!

973
02:17:35,506 --> 02:17:36,939
Ls too warm.

974
02:18:04,346 --> 02:18:07,782
Don't be blue, folks.
Everything is gonna be all right.

975
02:18:08,506 --> 02:18:12,419
There'll be a local through here tomorrow.
Thall fetch you into Omaha the day after.

976
02:18:12,506 --> 02:18:13,985
Yes, and lose 24 hours.

977
02:18:14,266 --> 02:18:17,781
If we miss our steamship in New York,
how will we get to Liverpool on time?

978
02:18:17,866 --> 02:18:22,621
I'm darned if I understand you city folks.
Always rushing.

979
02:18:23,386 --> 02:18:25,695
Always thinking about the future.

980
02:18:26,266 --> 02:18:28,655
No wonder you have stomach trouble.

981
02:18:29,746 --> 02:18:31,464
Is all my fault, sir.

982
02:18:31,546 --> 02:18:34,618
You should have caught the train
and let those Indians cook me.

983
02:18:34,706 --> 02:18:36,503
Then everyone woulïve been happy.

984
02:18:36,586 --> 02:18:37,860
Balderdash.

985
02:18:37,946 --> 02:18:42,098
What I always say is,
is an ill wind that blows no good.

986
02:19:47,706 --> 02:19:49,503
Ease off the halyards.

987
02:19:51,026 --> 02:19:52,300
Steady, man.

988
02:19:58,706 --> 02:20:01,982
Look, the train. The train broke down.
Stop the wind, master.

989
02:20:02,066 --> 02:20:03,738
Contain yourself, Passepartout.

990
02:20:08,626 --> 02:20:10,537
Everything's under control.

991
02:20:13,946 --> 02:20:16,141
Those homemade American trains.

992
02:20:19,666 --> 02:20:20,860
Goodbye.

993
02:20:41,744 --> 02:20:43,336
Well-played, Dennis.

994
02:20:43,424 --> 02:20:45,938
You have a natural aptitude for the game.

995
02:20:46,024 --> 02:20:48,538
Perfected by four years
of practice at Oxford.

996
02:20:48,664 --> 02:20:52,020
I did nothing else.
Cost my poor old governor over £12,000.

997
02:20:52,224 --> 02:20:54,135
Worth every penny of it.

998
02:20:55,064 --> 02:20:57,942
Hello, Sir Wilmette.
Haven't seen you in donkey's years.

999
02:20:58,024 --> 02:20:59,855
- Are you staying at the club?
- No.

1000
02:20:59,944 --> 02:21:03,300
- You have a house in town, no doubt?
- No.

1001
02:21:03,504 --> 02:21:06,223
- Then you live in the country, do you?
- No.

1002
02:21:07,464 --> 02:21:09,500
- Anywhere near London?
- No.

1003
02:21:11,464 --> 02:21:12,738
Hard luck.

1004
02:21:13,864 --> 02:21:15,092
Good day.

1005
02:21:22,584 --> 02:21:24,575
Here we are, gentlemen.

1006
02:21:24,664 --> 02:21:27,224
From the British Consulate, New York.

1007
02:21:27,384 --> 02:21:28,703
Things are looking up.

1008
02:21:28,784 --> 02:21:31,014
"Phileas Fogg and party
presented their passports...

1009
02:21:31,104 --> 02:21:33,664
"at 2:30 Greenwich time this afternoon."

1010
02:21:33,744 --> 02:21:37,214
- What time did that steamship sail?
- Wait, I have a schedule here.

1011
02:21:37,584 --> 02:21:40,621
Here we are. "City of Paris..."
No, thas yesterday's.

1012
02:21:40,704 --> 02:21:44,014
Wait a minute.
"Cunarder, China. New York, Liverpool."

1013
02:21:44,264 --> 02:21:47,461
- Sailed today, 9:00 a.m.
- He's missed it by five hours.

1014
02:21:47,544 --> 02:21:49,774
Not another eastbound vessel
for three days.

1015
02:21:49,864 --> 02:21:53,459
I don't wish to crow, gentlemen,
but I feel the crisp crackle of £20,000.

1016
02:21:53,544 --> 02:21:56,183
Les crack that bottle of champagne
we've been saving.

1017
02:21:56,264 --> 02:21:59,859
Right you are. But first,
what about a bet or two on the side...

1018
02:21:59,944 --> 02:22:02,253
before this information leaks out?

1019
02:22:02,464 --> 02:22:05,103
- We better get over to Lloyïs.
- Come on.

1020
02:22:15,824 --> 02:22:16,973
Listen.

1021
02:22:18,184 --> 02:22:20,652
They opened the telegram
while I was there.

1022
02:22:20,744 --> 02:22:23,975
<i>Fogg missed the China.
He can't possibly make it now.</i>

1023
02:22:24,064 --> 02:22:25,463
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1024
02:22:25,544 --> 02:22:27,535
Then I'll chance another couple of quid.

1025
02:22:27,624 --> 02:22:30,092
You take care of things
while I slip round the corner.

1026
02:22:30,184 --> 02:22:31,663
Wait a minute.

1027
02:22:32,224 --> 02:22:34,454
Put down an extra fiver for me.

1028
02:22:38,904 --> 02:22:42,214
No, gentlemen, not a bit of activity all day.

1029
02:22:42,304 --> 02:22:44,454
There are just no odds on Mr. Fogg.

1030
02:22:44,544 --> 02:22:47,342
How can that be?
We could barely get in here last Thursday.

1031
02:22:47,424 --> 02:22:49,494
Yes, is very mysterious.

1032
02:22:49,584 --> 02:22:51,734
You never know from minute to minute.

1033
02:22:53,624 --> 02:22:57,378
I have just received some rather
disquieting information about Mr. Fogg.

1034
02:23:03,744 --> 02:23:07,054
You know Mr. Carmichael,
the General Manager of Lloyïs.

1035
02:23:07,144 --> 02:23:10,693
- This is Inspector Hunter of Scotland Yard.
- How do you do?

1036
02:23:11,504 --> 02:23:13,938
This will be very painful
to hear, gentlemen.

1037
02:23:14,024 --> 02:23:17,619
We've just received confirmation of
something we've suspected for some time.

1038
02:23:17,704 --> 02:23:21,333
The man who robbed the Bank of England,
and your fellow clubman Phileas Fogg...

1039
02:23:21,424 --> 02:23:22,652
are one and the same.

1040
02:23:22,744 --> 02:23:25,941
- Of all the ridiculous nonsense!
- You don't really believe that.

1041
02:23:26,024 --> 02:23:28,015
Have you any grounds
for making this charge?

1042
02:23:28,104 --> 02:23:30,334
We have, sir. Some very striking facts.

1043
02:23:30,424 --> 02:23:32,733
Coupled with behavior
that points to his guilt.

1044
02:23:32,824 --> 02:23:34,576
- I don't believe it.
- Nor do I.

1045
02:23:34,664 --> 02:23:38,862
<i>You've heard that Mr. Fogg didn't sail
on the Cunard steamship China.</i>

1046
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:42,175
- What of it?
- Read them that message, Mr. Carmichael.

1047
02:23:42,304 --> 02:23:44,898
"At 6:00 a.m. Today,
our New York office reports...

1048
02:23:44,984 --> 02:23:47,179
<i>"that trading ship Henrietta
departed New York...</i>

1049
02:23:47,264 --> 02:23:50,097
"with a cargo of cotton,
linseed oil, and lumber.

1050
02:23:50,184 --> 02:23:53,221
"Her three passengers were
Mr. Phileas Fogg and party."

1051
02:23:53,304 --> 02:23:57,092
<i>And the Henrietta's destination
is Caracas, Venezuela.</i>

1052
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:59,857
We have no extradition treaty
with Venezuela.

1053
02:24:00,104 --> 02:24:02,572
In other words, Mr. Fogg has bolted.

1054
02:24:02,904 --> 02:24:06,579
A member of the Reform Club...
My mind rejects the whole idea.

1055
02:24:06,664 --> 02:24:09,019
There must be some explanation
for all this.

1056
02:24:09,104 --> 02:24:10,981
Perhaps, but the only man
who can make it...

1057
02:24:11,064 --> 02:24:14,693
is on the high seas at this moment,
bound for Central America.

1058
02:24:42,304 --> 02:24:45,819
Begging your pardon, sir,
we're way off course for Venezuela.

1059
02:24:45,904 --> 02:24:48,976
- Have you assumed command of this ship?
- No, sir.

1060
02:24:49,064 --> 02:24:52,056
Captain, don't overlook
the rest of our bargain.

1061
02:24:52,504 --> 02:24:55,701
By all means. Go below
and tell the engineer I want full steam.

1062
02:24:55,784 --> 02:24:58,503
- Full steam?
- Full steam. As much as she'll take.

1063
02:25:21,504 --> 02:25:24,462
You're burning her up too fast.
You'll never make it.

1064
02:25:24,544 --> 02:25:27,377
Just steer the ship, Captain.
Don't speculate.

1065
02:25:46,984 --> 02:25:49,703
Whas happening?
Why are we slowing down?

1066
02:26:07,504 --> 02:26:11,497
Well, thas it. They just put
the last teaspoon of coal in the old scow.

1067
02:26:11,664 --> 02:26:13,097
Is all finished, Mr. Fogg.

1068
02:26:13,184 --> 02:26:16,733
Still got a little breeze left,
but I don't think ill get you there in time.

1069
02:26:21,624 --> 02:26:23,660
Only three more days to go.

1070
02:26:25,264 --> 02:26:28,813
I still can't believe
that Fogg robbed the Bank of England.

1071
02:26:29,264 --> 02:26:31,380
No British gentleman, having done so...

1072
02:26:31,464 --> 02:26:34,581
would have the effrontery
to set foot in this club.

1073
02:26:52,184 --> 02:26:53,936
Capt. Speedy, I will be direct with you.

1074
02:26:54,024 --> 02:26:56,584
How much will you accept
for this vessel, cash in hand?

1075
02:26:56,664 --> 02:26:58,700
- Why, this is exceptional...
- £5,000?

1076
02:26:58,784 --> 02:27:01,457
£5,000? This deck
is made of Burmese teak.

1077
02:27:01,544 --> 02:27:04,377
Please dispense with the poetry.
Passepartout, get the bag.

1078
02:27:04,464 --> 02:27:05,658
Yes, sir.

1079
02:27:09,104 --> 02:27:10,776
Will that be sufficient?

1080
02:27:11,664 --> 02:27:13,302
- She's yours!
- Done.

1081
02:27:14,024 --> 02:27:17,460
Now, as the new owner,
I wish to issue my first command.

1082
02:27:18,064 --> 02:27:20,498
Pile everything that will burn
into the stoke hole.

1083
02:27:20,584 --> 02:27:23,098
The cargo first, of course, that linseed oil.

1084
02:27:23,184 --> 02:27:26,096
Then the upper decks, masts,
tables, chairs, windows...

1085
02:27:26,184 --> 02:27:29,062
ladders, everything,
including the lifeboats.

1086
02:27:29,144 --> 02:27:31,374
- Is that clear?
- The lifeboats?

1087
02:27:31,944 --> 02:27:34,902
Lifeboats. You heard what the man said.
Is that clear?

1088
02:27:56,424 --> 02:27:59,416
Come on. Keep moving.

1089
02:28:54,584 --> 02:28:56,734
No, not her.

1090
02:28:57,584 --> 02:28:59,336
<i>Not Henrietta!</i>

1091
02:29:00,264 --> 02:29:02,494
Not her. No!

1092
02:29:33,944 --> 02:29:36,981
- The gauges are falling fast.
- There's nothing more to burn.

1093
02:29:59,504 --> 02:30:00,653
How are we faring?

1094
02:30:00,744 --> 02:30:02,894
The pressure won't last
more than an hour.

1095
02:30:02,984 --> 02:30:04,815
- One hour?
- Thas right.

1096
02:30:16,704 --> 02:30:17,659
Engine room.

1097
02:30:17,744 --> 02:30:19,939
<i>- Land ho!
- Land ho!</i>

1098
02:30:28,224 --> 02:30:31,899
That was a close one. I never exactly
made a voyage like this before...

1099
02:30:31,984 --> 02:30:35,056
- but I can't deny it, we got here.
- Thanks to you and your men.

1100
02:30:35,144 --> 02:30:37,453
After I put you ashore,
where do you want me to dock?

1101
02:30:37,544 --> 02:30:40,058
Anywhere you wish.
I don't need her anymore, she's yours.

1102
02:30:40,144 --> 02:30:42,738
Thanks for the ship, whas left of it.

1103
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,297
But you could rebuild...

1104
02:30:44,384 --> 02:30:46,534
You rebuild her.
I have more pressing matters.

1105
02:30:46,624 --> 02:30:48,296
Thank you very much.

1106
02:31:14,744 --> 02:31:17,212
My friends, the end of our journey is near.

1107
02:31:17,304 --> 02:31:20,455
Eight hours and 42 minutes
of the allotted time remain.

1108
02:31:20,544 --> 02:31:25,140
Our train arrives in London at 6:02 p.m.,
ensuring ample time to proceed...

1109
02:31:25,224 --> 02:31:27,613
to the Reform Club and settle the wager.

1110
02:31:27,704 --> 02:31:31,413
- Phileas Fogg! Stop that man!
- Don't delay, master. Come on.

1111
02:31:34,864 --> 02:31:37,458
- What the devil is this?
- Are you Phileas Fogg?

1112
02:31:37,544 --> 02:31:39,216
Of course I am. Are you insane?

1113
02:31:39,304 --> 02:31:42,455
- Then I arrest you in the Queen's name.
- Arrest? On what charge?

1114
02:31:42,544 --> 02:31:45,422
Of purloining £55,000
from the Bank of England...

1115
02:31:45,504 --> 02:31:46,653
on the third of July.

1116
02:31:46,744 --> 02:31:48,143
- Is not true.
- Silence.

1117
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:50,579
You thought you were clever,
Mr. Phileas Fogg.

1118
02:31:50,664 --> 02:31:53,258
Thought you could outwit me, didn't you?

1119
02:31:53,944 --> 02:31:55,059
Hold him.

1120
02:31:55,144 --> 02:31:56,816
Is not true, sir.

1121
02:32:40,984 --> 02:32:43,657
I can't understand it.
The most shocking mistake.

1122
02:32:43,744 --> 02:32:45,735
Is never happened in my career.

1123
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:48,463
It would seem that I owe you an apology.

1124
02:32:49,744 --> 02:32:51,700
The most terrible thing has happened.

1125
02:32:51,784 --> 02:32:54,582
The real culprit was
apprehended in Brighton.

1126
02:32:54,664 --> 02:32:55,938
I am no longer suspect?

1127
02:32:56,024 --> 02:32:59,016
No, not in the least,
but I would like to tell you...

1128
02:32:59,104 --> 02:33:02,016
I've never had any
personal animosity for you.

1129
02:33:02,304 --> 02:33:06,616
On the contrary, you've always been
a perfect gentleman and most generous.

1130
02:33:06,824 --> 02:33:09,861
Is almost a pity
that you're not the real robber.

1131
02:33:09,944 --> 02:33:11,502
You're so daring.

1132
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:15,861
Now that you have
successfully thwarted me...

1133
02:33:15,944 --> 02:33:17,741
and placed in my path the only obstacle...

1134
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:19,462
which I could not make provision for...

1135
02:33:19,544 --> 02:33:23,696
I feel I can tell you I have never
really enjoyed your company very much.

1136
02:33:23,784 --> 02:33:28,096
And furthermore, you play an abominable
game of whist. Good day, sir.

1137
02:33:39,224 --> 02:33:41,374
The wager is lost. Come.

1138
02:34:01,184 --> 02:34:02,856
What a gloomy place.

1139
02:34:05,504 --> 02:34:07,734
So melancholy, so joyless.

1140
02:34:10,384 --> 02:34:13,899
I'm sorry, Mr. Fogg.
I didn't mean to criticize your taste.

1141
02:34:13,984 --> 02:34:16,339
No, you're right. It is depressing.

1142
02:34:17,384 --> 02:34:19,056
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?

1143
02:34:19,144 --> 02:34:20,782
Look at the clocks.

1144
02:34:20,864 --> 02:34:23,742
Get in touch with Mr. McMonnies
and have them put in order.

1145
02:34:23,824 --> 02:34:27,419
- Right away, this morning.
- No, is Sunday today. Tomorrow.

1146
02:34:27,824 --> 02:34:30,292
Make up the spare bedroom
for the princess.

1147
02:34:30,384 --> 02:34:32,898
Light a fire and see to her comforts.

1148
02:34:32,984 --> 02:34:34,383
Certainly, sir.

1149
02:34:34,464 --> 02:34:38,696
Madam, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to spend the rest of the day alone.

1150
02:34:38,984 --> 02:34:40,895
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?

1151
02:34:41,424 --> 02:34:43,540
Turn out the gas in your room.

1152
02:34:59,664 --> 02:35:02,383
You needn't bother, Passepartout.
I'll take this up to him.

1153
02:35:02,464 --> 02:35:05,774
<i>He won't eat, Madame.
He is feeling very low.</i>

1154
02:35:06,824 --> 02:35:07,939
Poor man.

1155
02:35:08,024 --> 02:35:11,812
You know, his whole fortune,
all that he risked...

1156
02:35:12,824 --> 02:35:14,542
everything is lost.

1157
02:35:23,144 --> 02:35:26,375
- What will become of you?
- I can take care of myself.

1158
02:35:26,864 --> 02:35:29,424
After all, I have a dozen professions...

1159
02:35:29,504 --> 02:35:33,463
fireman, acrobat, traveling companion.

1160
02:35:53,624 --> 02:35:55,342
You must eat something, Mr. Fogg.

1161
02:35:55,424 --> 02:35:57,255
- No, thank you.
- Please.

1162
02:35:58,704 --> 02:36:00,934
You're angry with me, and justly.

1163
02:36:01,024 --> 02:36:03,174
Good heavens.
Why should I be angry with you?

1164
02:36:03,264 --> 02:36:05,573
You might have won your wager
but for me.

1165
02:36:05,664 --> 02:36:08,462
You saved my life at the risk of your own...

1166
02:36:08,624 --> 02:36:10,501
generously, impulsively.

1167
02:36:10,704 --> 02:36:14,014
I repaid you by delaying you,
involving you needlessly.

1168
02:36:14,104 --> 02:36:18,222
On the contrary, I owe you an apology
for bringing you to England, penniless.

1169
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:20,499
You must not concern yourself with me.

1170
02:36:21,584 --> 02:36:25,497
Anything that has overtaken me
is a direct result of my own folly.

1171
02:36:26,384 --> 02:36:29,740
I refuse to deceive myself,
and I don't like self-pity.

1172
02:36:30,704 --> 02:36:33,172
Possibly things aren't as desperate
as they seem.

1173
02:36:33,264 --> 02:36:37,018
To be candid, at the moment
they're not particularly promising.

1174
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:40,814
- Surely your friends could aid you.
- I have no friends.

1175
02:36:41,864 --> 02:36:44,298
- Nor relatives?
- Not a soul.

1176
02:36:49,624 --> 02:36:51,580
Then I truly feel for you.

1177
02:36:51,944 --> 02:36:54,253
I know how tragic solitude can be...

1178
02:36:54,344 --> 02:36:57,063
<i>when one has nobody
with whom to share his grief,</i>

1179
02:36:57,144 --> 02:37:00,454
<i>In my country, Mr, Fogg,
it is said that misfortune,,,</i>

1180
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:05,254
<i>if shared with another sympathetic spirit,
can be borne with resignation,</i>

1181
02:37:09,104 --> 02:37:11,902
Do you wish at once
a kinswoman and a friend?

1182
02:37:13,584 --> 02:37:16,417
I'm not sure that I interpret you correctly.

1183
02:37:18,744 --> 02:37:20,974
Will you have me for your wife?

1184
02:37:24,544 --> 02:37:26,182
<i>Aouda, my darling,</i>

1185
02:37:29,944 --> 02:37:31,741
Yes, sir? Yes, master?

1186
02:37:31,824 --> 02:37:33,780
<i>I want you to go
to Rev, Samuel Wilson,,,</i>

1187
02:37:33,864 --> 02:37:35,695
<i>of Marylebone Parish at once,</i>

1188
02:37:36,144 --> 02:37:38,738
<i>- Right away, sir.
- Arrange for a wedding,</i>

1189
02:37:38,984 --> 02:37:41,862
<i>- One wedding, sir. When?
- Tomorrow,</i>

1190
02:37:42,384 --> 02:37:43,976
<i>Will that be all right, my dear?</i>

1191
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:46,339
<i>- Yes, tomorrow,
- Olé, sir!</i>

1192
02:37:49,864 --> 02:37:53,061
<i>Curtail the jubilation, please,
Bring the Reverend Wilson with you,</i>

1193
02:37:53,144 --> 02:37:54,372
Yes, sir.

1194
02:38:09,424 --> 02:38:11,938
- Yes?
- A wedding. Come with me.

1195
02:38:12,384 --> 02:38:15,137
- No, I don't think so.
- Quickly. Is an emergency.

1196
02:38:15,224 --> 02:38:17,101
- I'll get my hat.
- Quickly.

1197
02:38:32,664 --> 02:38:33,892
Saturday.

1198
02:38:42,264 --> 02:38:43,697
Is Saturday.

1199
02:38:50,704 --> 02:38:54,219
And so many clocks.
Couldn't there be just one?

1200
02:38:55,024 --> 02:38:57,219
Anything you suggest, my dear.

1201
02:38:59,504 --> 02:39:01,460
How dare you bolt into a room
in this fashion?

1202
02:39:01,544 --> 02:39:04,138
Where's your training?
And remove your hat.

1203
02:39:04,224 --> 02:39:06,260
Is not Sunday, is Saturday.

1204
02:39:06,344 --> 02:39:09,256
- We have 10 minutes left.
- What are you jabbering about?

1205
02:39:09,344 --> 02:39:11,653
Ls Saturday! Look for yourself.

1206
02:39:12,344 --> 02:39:15,017
Fiddlesticks. The printers
must have made an error.

1207
02:39:15,104 --> 02:39:18,619
- You have made error.
- We will review your impudence later.

1208
02:39:18,704 --> 02:39:20,217
Allow me to disillusion you.

1209
02:39:20,304 --> 02:39:23,933
I have kept a detailed record
of every single phase of our entire trip.

1210
02:39:24,024 --> 02:39:27,255
We went around the world in 80 days,
this is the 81...

1211
02:39:27,344 --> 02:39:28,777
Is Saturday.

1212
02:39:31,824 --> 02:39:35,658
We went eastward around the world,
always moving towards the sun.

1213
02:39:36,184 --> 02:39:38,857
Great heavens.
We've crossed the International Date Line.

1214
02:39:38,944 --> 02:39:42,061
We've gained an entire day.
This is the eightieth day.

1215
02:39:42,144 --> 02:39:45,898
We have 10 minutes and 50 seconds left
to get to the club.

1216
02:39:45,984 --> 02:39:48,259
You wait here, my dear.
Come, man, don't dawdle.

1217
02:39:56,144 --> 02:39:57,896
Cabby, Reform Club.

1218
02:39:58,264 --> 02:39:59,936
- Who?
- Reform Club.

1219
02:40:01,704 --> 02:40:03,820
Mind you, is none of my business...

1220
02:40:03,904 --> 02:40:07,419
but do you think you'll get into
the Reform Club dressed like that?

1221
02:40:07,504 --> 02:40:08,937
Drive on, man.

1222
02:40:25,464 --> 02:40:28,615
- Whas the matter? What happened?
- I'm sorry, sir. Is the hiccups.

1223
02:40:29,024 --> 02:40:32,494
I'm taken very bad.
I can't do a thing with them, sir.

1224
02:40:33,144 --> 02:40:35,021
- Blimey.
- Confound the man.

1225
02:40:35,104 --> 02:40:36,617
Is all right. I drive.

1226
02:40:39,904 --> 02:40:43,692
- Whas the matter with the beast?
- Is no good, sir. He can't do it.

1227
02:40:43,784 --> 02:40:45,536
He'd love to, but he can't.

1228
02:40:45,624 --> 02:40:48,218
He don't take orders from nobody but me.

1229
02:40:49,624 --> 02:40:53,697
- Come on, please.
- Is no good. He can't do it.

1230
02:40:54,424 --> 02:40:56,096
No, he won't do it.

1231
02:40:58,304 --> 02:41:02,536
The devil never sleeps, brethren.
Even now as we stand here...

1232
02:41:02,824 --> 02:41:06,100
he is hurrying some poor soul
to his doom...

1233
02:41:07,624 --> 02:41:10,218
tempting him down the path of iniquity.

1234
02:41:10,624 --> 02:41:13,263
And now, I shall take up the collection.

1235
02:41:19,224 --> 02:41:20,498
Excuse me.

1236
02:41:22,344 --> 02:41:25,620
Sir, would you like
to contribute something to our cause?

1237
02:41:25,704 --> 02:41:28,776
I don't think I have anything.
Wait. There's something.

1238
02:41:28,864 --> 02:41:31,662
- A fiver?
- Please, I'm in a hurry. Is a wager.

1239
02:41:31,744 --> 02:41:34,736
A wager? Did you hear that, brethren?

1240
02:41:35,024 --> 02:41:38,733
Our poor, benighted sinner is the very sort
I've been telling you about.

1241
02:41:38,824 --> 02:41:41,861
Don't do it, sir.
Don't give in to the Prince of Darkness.

1242
02:41:41,944 --> 02:41:46,256
- I haven't the faintest intention of giving...
- Have courage, my boy, to say no.

1243
02:41:46,904 --> 02:41:50,692
Turn to Hymn 579, everyone,
and lift up your voices...

1244
02:41:50,784 --> 02:41:53,981
to save our poorly beset brother.

1245
02:42:18,744 --> 02:42:20,496
Good heavens. Why wait any longer?

1246
02:42:20,584 --> 02:42:23,178
- He's lost the wager...
- Of course he has, 20 times over...

1247
02:42:23,264 --> 02:42:25,220
once he missed
his transatlantic connection.

1248
02:42:25,304 --> 02:42:28,819
Steady on, chaps. Play the game.
Remember, we're all British gentlemen.

1249
02:42:28,904 --> 02:42:32,613
- There's still 14 seconds to go.
- The man's not superhuman.

1250
02:42:32,704 --> 02:42:36,174
What do you expect him to do? Pop down
the chimney like Santa Claus?

1251
02:42:36,264 --> 02:42:40,815
I haven't the least idea. I only know
that Fogg is the most punctual man alive.

1252
02:42:41,664 --> 02:42:44,622
Gentlemen, here I am.

1253
02:42:48,664 --> 02:42:50,655
I trust that I've not kept you waiting.

1254
02:42:50,744 --> 02:42:52,063
Hello, Fogg.

1255
02:42:53,304 --> 02:42:55,056
Great Caesar's ghost!

1256
02:42:55,224 --> 02:42:57,294
A woman in the club!

1257
02:43:01,704 --> 02:43:04,457
My dear, I must ask you
to leave these precincts at once.

1258
02:43:04,544 --> 02:43:07,581
- No woman has ever set foot in the club.
- Why not?

1259
02:43:08,784 --> 02:43:12,094
Because that could spell
the end of the British Empire.

1260
02:43:18,344 --> 02:43:19,857
This is the end.
