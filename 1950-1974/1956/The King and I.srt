Does that mean that
you do not know?

354
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,231
But you must know,
because you are king.

355
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,566
Good.

356
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,441
Someday you too will be king,

357
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,780
and you too will know everything.

358
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,865
But how do I learn?

359
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,114
And when do I know that
I know everything?

360
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,748
When you are king.

361
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,913
When you are king.

362
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,633
But I do not know.

363
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,384
In my head are many facts,
but I am not sure.

364
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,593
What to tell a growing son?

365
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,688
How to bring truth and justice
to my people?

366
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,145
(SINGING) When I was a boy,

367
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,697
World was better spot,

368
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,316
What was so was so,

369
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,527
What was not was not.

370
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,162
Now I am a man,

371
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,456
World have change a lot

372
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,827
Some things nearly so,

373
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,873
Others nearly not.

374
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,510
There are times I almost think

375
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:32,683
I am not sure of what
I absolutely know;

376
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,975
Very often find confusion

377
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:40,023
In conclusion I concluded long ago.

378
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,274
In my head are many facts that,

379
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:47,231
As a student I have
studied to procure

380
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,657
In my head are many facts,

381
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,283
Of which I wish I was more certain

382
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,286
I was sure.

383
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,545
Is a puzzlement.

384
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,794
Shall I join with other
nations in alliance?

385
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,091
If allies are weak
am I not best alone?

386
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,223
If allies are strong with power
to protect me,

387
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:22,524
Might they not protect
me out of all I own?

388
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,232
Is a danger to be
trusting one another,

389
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,109
One will seldom want to do
what other wishes;

390
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,830
But unless someday,
Somebody trust somebody,

391
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,914
There'll be nothing left on earth

392
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,454
excepting fishes!

393
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,215
There are times I almost think

394
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:53,422
nobody sure of what
he absolutely know,

395
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,431
Ev'rybody find confusion

396
00:32:55,432 --> 00:33:00,388
In conclusion he
concluded long ago.

397
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,396
And it puzzle me to learn

398
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:07,524
that tho' a man may be in doubt
of what he know,

399
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,775
Very quickly will he fight,

400
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,367
He'll fight to prove
that what he does not know

401
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,826
is so.

402
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,784
Ohhhh!

403
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,623
Sometimes I think that
people going mad!

404
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,958
Ahhhh!

405
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,551
Sometimes I think that
people not so bad.

406
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,969
But no matter what I think,

407
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,515
I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom

408
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,013
I must go forth,

409
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:43,020
Be father to my children,
And husband to each wife,

410
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,849
Et cetera, et cetera, and so forth.

411
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,362
If my Lord in heaven
Buddha show the way,

412
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,990
Ev'ry day I try to
live another day,

413
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,903
If my Lord in heaven
Buddha show the way,

414
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:03,579
Ev'ry day I do my best
for one more day,

In right hand is weapon.

Here is king of Burma.

No clothes mean

434
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,144

Thank you, Lady Thiang.
I'll continue.

looking at is 25 years old,

CHOWFA: I do not see Siam.

442
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,505
The white is Siam.

443
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,882
Siam not so small.

444
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,632
Well, wait. Let me
show you England.

445
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,889
See? It is even smaller than Siam.

Before I came here, Siam was just
that little white spot to me.

Now that I've been here many months
it has become far more than that

449
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,604
because I've met the people of Siam,
and I'm learning to understand them.

450

It's a very ancient saying,

454
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,825
But a true and honest thought,

455
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,498
That if you become a teacher,

456
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,631
By your pupils you'll be taught,

457
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,630

change into small white spots

that look like lace.

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,463
And this is called "snow."

538
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,096
Snow.

539
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,140
Spots of lace!

540
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,102
Yes, Your Highness. The water freezes
on its way down from the sky.

541
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,522
I do not believe
such thing as snow.

542
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,941
And I do not believe
such thing as snow.

543
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,485
And I do not believe
Siam is this big.

544
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,487
And other country so big.

545
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:16,366
- Siam is biggest country in world!
- CHILDREN: Siam!

546
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,693
(SHOUTING)

547
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,494
What, what, what?

548
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,001
How can schoolroom
be so unscientific?

549
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:33,050
Well, Your Majesty,
we had a little misunderstanding.

550
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,885
I was trying to describe snow

551
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,010
and they refused to believe
there is such a thing.

552
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,933
Snow?

553
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,519
Snow.

554
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,312
From mountaintop.

555
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,813
From sky, Your Majesty.

556
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,316
From sky to mountaintop.

557
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,151
That's right, Your Majesty.

558
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,904
I remember. I see
pictures of Switzerland.

559
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,075
Land all white with snow.

560
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,244
Who does not believe this?

561
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,039
Well, after all,
they've never seen it.

562
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,166
Never seen?

563
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:10,668
If they believe only what they see,
why do we have schoolroom? Rise!

564
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,714
Never let me hear
of not believing schoolteacher

565
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:20,299
whom I have bring
here at high expense.

566
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,681
Twenty pounds each month.

567
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,097
Twenty English pounds.

568
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,065
Sterling!

569
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,984
Rise!

570
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,861
I command all of you

571
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,862
to make most of this opportunity
for expensive education.

572
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,157
For sake of selves and country.

573
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,538
Furthermore, it is...

574
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,492
What, what, what? This is not
study book I have provide.

575
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,210
No, Your Majesty, it's one of mine.

576
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,085
- I gave it to Tuptim.
- The name! You tell me!

577
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,383
Is called The Small
House of Uncle Thomas.

578
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,884
Is by American lady,
Harriet Beecher Stowe.

579
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,472
A woman has written a book?

580
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,809
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
A wonderful book, Your Majesty.

581
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,728
All about the evils of
slavery in America.

582
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,898
President Lincoln of America
against slavery, no?

583
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,772
Very definitely, Your Majesty.

584
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,402
Me too.

585
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,981
Slavery very bad thing.

586
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:23,445
Mr. Lincoln is fighting a war,
even now, to set the slaves free.

587
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,412
You admire him for this?

588
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,122
Very much, Your Majesty.

589
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,916
He seems to be a fine man
who has studied hard

590
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,085
and educated himself.

591
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,127
In that, he is not unlike yourself.

592
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,714
Shall Mr. Lincoln be winning this
war he is fighting at present?

593
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,431
No one knows, really.

594
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,307
Does he have enough guns and
elephants for transporting same?

595
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,606
I don't think they have elephants
in America, Your Majesty.

596
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,730
- No elephants?
- No.

597
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,894
No wonder he's not winning war.

598
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,407
All right, children,
you may be seated now.

599
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,286
- CHOWFA: Mrs. Anna?
- Yes, Your Highness?

600
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,416
I do not understand

601
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,121
how slaves can be set free
if their masters wish to keep them.

602
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,381
It's done by the passing of a law

603
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,176
and by the enforcing of that law,
if necessary.

604
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,969
But my slaves

605
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,971
and the slaves of my father...

606
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,517
Suppose there was such a law in
Siam and we did not want it so?

607
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:33,480
Sometimes things can't be just a
question of what we want, Highness,

608
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,103
but of what is right.

609
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,360
Ha.

610
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:53,333
I think perhaps we had better call
recess until after luncheon.

611
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,876
You may be excused.

612
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,499
(CHEERING)

613
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,359
Young prince has healthy respect

614
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,528
for ways of his own people.

615
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,989
Sometimes more than king.

616
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,411
Prince Chulalongkorn is a fine boy
with a keen and probing mind.

617
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,081
But he still has much to learn,
Your Excellency.

618
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,792
What is important for him to learn

619
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,462
I do not think he'll find
in this classroom.

620
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,465
I'm fully aware that you do not
approve of my coming to Siam.

621
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,552
Why are you so blind?
Have you no eyes to see?

622
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,221
King tries impossible task

623
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,433
wishing to be scientific man
who learn all modern things.

624
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,518
I think it a fine ambition.

625
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,189
Inside him is strong king like
his father, who cannot change.

626
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:01,231
He will only tear himself in two,
trying to be something he can never be.

627
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,403
Of course he can never be

628
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,156
if those closest to him
are unwilling to help him.

629
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,576
You do not know king
as well as you think you do.

630
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,537
You believe you have
great influence over him.

631
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,832
You will end up as his slave
like all the others.

632
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,125
I...

633
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,835
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

634
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,813
Yes, yes. Just a moment.

635
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,745
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

636
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,243
The king?

637
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,579
At this hour of the night?

638
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:03,631
Well, I trust His Majesty won't object
if I put some clothes on first.

639
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,393
You sent for me, Your Majesty?

640
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,692
Your Majesty.

641
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,569
Oh, Your Majesty is reading
the Bible.

642
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,582
Mrs. Anna,

643
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,536
I think your Moses
shall have been a fool.

644
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,374
Moses?

645
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,966
Moses, Moses, Moses.
I think he shall have been a fool.

646
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,342
Here it stands written by him

647
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,717
that the world was created
in six days.

648
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,764
Now you know and I know

649
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,809
that it took many ages
to create world.

650
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,393
I think he shall have been a fool
to have written so.

651
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,565
What is your opinion?

652
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,945
Is that why Your Majesty sent for
me at this hour of the night?

653
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:11,030
That is not reason, but first
I wish to discuss Moses.

654
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,616
Now, how am I ever to learn truth

655
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,912
if different English books
state different things?

656
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:23,419
The Bible was not written by men
of science, but by men of faith.

657
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,172
It was their explanation
of the miracle of creation,

658
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:31,469
which is the same miracle whether
it took six days or many centuries.

659
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,018
I still think your Moses
shall have been a fool.

660
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,815
As you wish, Your Majesty.

661
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,859
Now, was there something else?

662
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,437
Take letter.

663
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,530
A letter? Now?

664
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,575
Now. When else?
Now is always best time.

665
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:59,622
Take letter to Mr. Lincoln of America,
who is very scientific ruler.

666
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,121
Very well, Your Majesty.

667
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,707
From Phra Mana Mongut,

668
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,672
by the blessing of the highest
super agency in the world

669
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,877
of the whole universe,
the king of Siam.

670
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:18,473
Sovereign of all tributary countries
adjacent and in every direction,

671
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,223
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

672
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,644
Do you not have any respect for me?

673
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,851
Why do you stand over my head?

674
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,482
I cannot stand all the time.

675
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,324
And in this country no one's head
shall be higher than king's.

676
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,824
From now on in presence, you shall
so conduct like all other subjects.

677
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,490
You mean, on the floor?

678
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,658
All subjects do so.

679
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,584
I'm very sorry.

680
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:50,415
I shall try my best not to let my
head be higher than Your Majesty's,

681
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,132
but I simply cannot
grovel on the floor.

682
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,337
I couldn't possibly
work that way, or think.

683
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,895
You are very difficult woman!

684
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,939
Perhaps so, Your Majesty.

685
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,650
But observe care that head
shall not be higher than mine.

686
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:14,445
When I shall sit, you shall sit!
When I shall kneel, you shall kneel.

687
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,365
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!

688
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,403
Very well, Your Majesty.

689
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,456
Is promise?

690
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,705
- Is promise.
- Good.

691
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:42,557
To His Royal Presidency
of the United States in America...

692
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,977
"Abrahom Lingkong"...

693
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,014
et cetera. You fix up.

694
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,730
It has occurred to us...

695
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,865
You see, it has occurred to us...

696
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,629
it has occurred to us that if we
shall be sending you several pairs

697
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,049
of young male elephants

698
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,757
to be turned loose
in forests of America...

699
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,130
A-mer-i-ca.

700
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,265
We are of opinion

701
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:28,096
that after a while
they shall increase in number.

702
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,606
- And inhabitants of America shall...
- Your Majesty.

703
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,732
Well?

704
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,943
I don't think you mean pairs
of male elephants.

705
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,272
How can I make letter
if you interrupt?

706
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:43,242
And inhabitants of America shall be
able to catch and tame them

707
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,579
and use them as beasts of burden.

708
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,659
Only male elephants, Your Majesty?

709
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,214
You put in the details.

710
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,792
Good night.

711
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,927

Groveling on the floor
at 2:00 in the morning.

715
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,307
I am Lun Tha.

716
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,983
You are Mrs. Anna, schoolteacher?

717
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,312
Yes, but you shouldn't be...

718
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,441
I must meet with
Tuptim again. Please!

719
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,950
You have been seeing her here?

720
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,827
Twice we have spoken.

721
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,326
Each time it becomes
more difficult.

722
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,407
She has said you will help us.

723
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,625
Oh, no, I couldn't!

724
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,252
It's much too dangerous.

725
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,587
Not for me, but for Tuptim and you.

726
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:41,134
You'll be killed if they find you in
the City of Women. You must leave!

727
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:45,593
Death is not worse pain than
empty life. Please, Mrs. Anna.

728
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,182
I'm sorry, Lun Tha.

729
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,385
There's nothing I can do.

730
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,164
Wait there.

731
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,603
Tuptim.

732
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,897
Oh, Lun Tha.

733
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,521
Seeing you this way is not enough.

734
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,363
There is nothing we can do.

735
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:29,235
I am watched too closely.

736
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,281
Must we go on forever
hiding our love like this?

737
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:42,088
(SINGING) We kiss in a shadow

738
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:47,134
We hide from the moon,

739
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:50,012
Our meetings are few

740
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:55,265
and over too soon.

741
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:02,024
We speak in a whisper,

742
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,150
Afraid to be heard;

743
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,949
When people are near,

744
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,781
We speak not a word.

745
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,836
Alone in our secret,

746
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,631
Together we sigh

747
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,594
for one smiling day

748
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:35,848

749
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:42,233
To kiss in the sunlight,

750
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:47,188
And say to the sky:

751
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,323
Behold and believe

00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:04,209
how my lover

755
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:10,920
loves me!

756
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,724

When will we be together, Tuptim?

757
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,051
When?

758
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,350
It can never be, Lun Tha.

759
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,396
Not ever.

00:57:53,470 --> 00:58:00,178
loves me!

767
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,655
(SPEAKING) You must go now.

768
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:16,110
I will be missed, and they will
start searching for me.

769
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,950
When I return, it will be
to take you from here.

770
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,081
There is no way, Lun Tha.

771
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,629
There is a river. There are boats.

772
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,207
I will find a way.

773
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,797
Oh, if it could only be.

774
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,800
It will be. I swear this.

775
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,632
When all is arranged,
I will get word to you.

776
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,261
I shall pray, Lun Tha.

777
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:54,071
If you see a chaba flower in
your path, broken like this,

778
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,526
it will be the sign that
I have come for you. Watch for it.

779
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,987
I will be ready.

- What, what, what?

783
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,652
Well?

784
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:43,704
When Siam's richest province
was stolen by France,

785
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,000
I warned it was only
beginning of Western treachery.

786
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,337
If enemies of ours,
with lies such as this

787
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,673
can convince British that you are
unfit to be ruler of Siam,

788
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,799
our seas will soon be thick
with ships, greedy for conquest.

789
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,466
So it has finally come.

790
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,511
We must act quickly.

791
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,056
But how? Where?

792
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,232
I must think.

793
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,606
Clearly. Scientifically.

794
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,444
I must think.

That was splendid. Very effective.

Now...

803
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,069
- Good morning.
- You think you teach king lesson!

804
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,364
This is one lesson you do not
be paid for teaching!

805
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:06,078
You will stop instructing wives
and children in "Home Sweet House"

806
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,957
in order to remind me of breaking
promises I never make, et cetera.

807
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:14,587
Your Majesty, I do not intend to
have my boy brought up in a harem.

808
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,424
You did promise me a house. "A brick
residence adjoining the palace."

809
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:22,971
- Those were your very words.
- I do not remember such words!

810

- I remember them.
- I will do remembering!

Who is king here?

I remind you so you remember that.
I do not remember any promises.

I do not remember anything
except that you are my servant.

Oh, no, Your Majesty.

What, what, what?

816
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,116
I said, you are my servant!

817
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:48,454
No, Your Majesty, that is not true.
I am most certainly not your servant!

818
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,248
If you do not give me
the house you promised,

819
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,577

so extraordinarily?

830

I do not wish to leave them. I love
them too, quite extraordinarily.

promise has no meaning.

No. It is I who ask you.

Agents in Singapore have found copies
of letters to British government

which describe king as barbarian

855
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:05,924
and suggest necessity
of making Siam a protectorate.

Oh, but that is outrageous!

01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:12,973

but he is not a barbarian.

01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:05,017
Defend him when he's wrong,

892
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,985
And tell him when he's strong,

893
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:16,406
He is wonderful.

894
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:22,910
He'll always need your love,

895
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:30,460
And so he'll get your love.

896
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:38,347
A man who needs your love

897
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:42,683
can be

898
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:49,517
wonderful.

899
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,553
Your Majesty.

900
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,517
You have come to apologize.

901
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,562
- I am sorry, Your Majesty, but...
- Good! You apologize.

902
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,857
- I didn't say...
- I accept.

903
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

904
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,230
Well?

905
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,946
Do you not see I am occupied?

906
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:44,279
My mind on very important matters.

907
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,909
Anything you wish
to discuss with me?

908
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:57,132
Why should I discuss
important matter with woman?

909
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,883
Very well, Your Majesty. In that
case I shall say good night.

910
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,797
Good night!

911
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,892
Your Majesty...

912
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,693
- What, what, what?
- I wonder...

913
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,528
- When the boat came from Singapore...
- Singapore!

914
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,608
- Was there any news from abroad?
- News!

915
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,360
There were news!

916
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,703
- They call me barbarian.
- Who?

917
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,956
Parties who would use this
as excuse to steal my country.

918
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,417
Now suppose you are Queen Victoria,

919
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:36,254
and someone say to you king of
Siam is barbarian. Do you believe?

920
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,507
- Well, Your Majesty...
- You will!

921
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:43,220
You will believe I am because
there is no one to speak otherwise.

922
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,138
Oh, but this is a lie!

923
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,637
It is a false lie!

924
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,108
What have you decided
to do about it?

925
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,701
You guess.

926
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,168
Well,

927
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,463
if someone were sending a lie
about me to England,

928
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,508
I would do my best to send
the truth to England.

929
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:24,386
Is that what you have decided
to do, Your Majesty?

930
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:27,682
Yes, that is what I have
decided to do. But how?

931
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,636
Guess how I shall do this.

932
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,397
Well, my guess would be
that you would seek

933
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,316
some kind of personal contact
with the British.

934
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:42,320
Personal contact! When British
ambassador and party arrive in Siam...

935
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,148
The ambassador, here?

936
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,409
On quick tour of Orient.
Friendship tour, they say.

937
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,706
I receive letters from his aide, Sir
Edward Ramsay, who accompanies him.

938
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,033
Edward, coming here?

939
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,832
"Edward"?

940
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,669
You call him this?

941
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,420
We are old friends. I knew him
in London before I was married.

942
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:14,436
When they're here, I'll take
opportunity of expressing my opinion

943
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,230
of thieves who would try
to steal my country.

944
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,810
I will show them who is barbarian!

945
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,864
Well, what is this face you put on?

946
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:30,911
My guess is that you will not fight
with your distinguished visitors.

947
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,331
- I will not?
- No, Your Majesty.

948
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,702
You will give a banquet
in their honor.

949
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:40,045
You will entertain them in
a particularly grand manner.

950
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:43,089
You will make them all
witnesses in your favor.

951
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,550
They will return to England
and report to the queen

952
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,755
that you are most certainly
not a barbarian.

953
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,850
Naturally!

954
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,435
(LAUGHS)

955
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:59,141
Naturally! This is what
I shall have intended to do.

956
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,984
That's it, Your Majesty.
Stand up to them.

957
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,279
Put your best foot forward.

958
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,783
It's an expression, Your Majesty.

959
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,285
It means put on your best clothes,

960
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:16,081
show them your most intelligent men
and most beautiful women.

961
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:20,919
Shall it be proper for the British
to see my women without shoes?

962
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,045
Shall it be proper for my women to
put their best bare feet fonuard?

963
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,844
No, we shall make them look
like ladies of Europe:

964
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,637
Shoes on feet, dresses on bodies.

965
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,765
You will tell me which ladies
are most like Europeans

966
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,394
and educate them in European customs
and manner for presentation.

967
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,771
- Also, sew dresses.
- Sew dresses?

968
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,231
All women shall help.

969
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:44,109
Don't you think it would
make a better impression

970
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,778
in their own manner and dress?

971
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:51,199
You are not being scientific. The
ambassador knows we are Siamese.

972
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,743
I wish him to know
we are also Europeans.

973
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,787
Wake up! Everybody to the temple!

01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,295
We will entertain
them with acrobats.

977
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:06,423
We could give them
a theatrical performance.

978
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:10,927
Tuptim has written a play, her own
version of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

979
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,723
We shall give them theatricals.
We'll show them who is barbarian.

980
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,559
We could make European dishes
for dinner.

981
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,771
You teach. To be served on high
table. Long white tablecloth...

982

- And napkins.
- Of finest silk.

983
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,818
- Using best gold chopsticks.
- Chopsticks?

984
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,238
Don't you think knives and forks
would be more suitable?

985
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,284
British not scientific enough
for the use of chopsticks.

986
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:37,704
You are to order finest
gold knives and forks.

987
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:42,375
Also spoons.
Why do you not think of spoons?

988
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:45,462
An inspired idea, Your Majesty.

989
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,715
We mustn't forget cigars.
Englishmen are fond of them.

990
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:52,677
You are to make list of all eminent
Europeans residing in Bangkok

991
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,430
- for sending of invitations.
- Very well.

992
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:59,100
You will instruct court musicians
their learning music of Europe

How much time do I
have for all this?

01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:11,675
A man must live like honeybee

1417
01:47:12,176 --> 01:47:15,220
and gather all he can.

1418
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,262
To fly from blossom to blossom,

1419
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:23,266
A honeybee must be free,

1420
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:27,809
But blossom must not ever fly

1421
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,061
from bee, to bee, to bee.

1422
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:37,068
(SPEAKING) Oh, Your Majesty, in my country
we have a far different attitude.

1423
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,370
We believe that
for a man to be truly happy...

1424
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:43,450
he must love one woman
and one woman only.

1425
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,541
This idea was invented by woman.

1426
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:48,127
But it's a beautiful idea,
Your Majesty.

1427
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:50,338
In England, we're
brought up with it.

1428
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:53,549
And by the time a young girl
goes to her first dance...

1429
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,093
Young girl?

1430
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:56,719
They dance also?

1431
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,430
Like tonight?
In arms of man not her husband?

1432
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:00,932
Why, of course.

1433
01:48:00,933 --> 01:48:02,510
I would not permit.

1434
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:04,937
Oh, but it's very exciting.

1435
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:07,063
When you're young...

1436
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:09,232
at your first dance...

1437
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:12,107
and you're sitting
on a small gilt chair...

1438
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:13,938
with your eyes lowered...

1439
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:17,692
terrified that you'll be
a Wallflower.

1440
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:21,657
And suddenly you see
two black shoes...

1441
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,573
a white waistcoat...

1442
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:29,294
a face. It speaks.

1443
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:33,047
(SINGING)
We've just been introduced,

1444
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:35,675
I do not know you well.

1445
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:40,972
But when the music started,
something drew me to your side.

1446
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:43,599
So many men and girls

1447
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,223
Are in each other's arms,

1448
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,305
It made me think

1449
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:51,142
we might be

1450
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:56,318
similarly occupied.

1451
01:48:57,406 --> 01:49:01,577
Shall we dance?

1452
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:07,332
On a bright cloud of
music shall we fly?

1453
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,210
Shall we dance?

1454
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:15,173
Shall we then say "goodnight"
and mean "goodbye?"

1455
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:18,259
Oh, perchance

1456
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:23,011
when the last little star
has left the sky.

1457
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:28,559
Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,

1458
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:33,191
And shall you be my new romance?

1459
01:49:33,776 --> 01:49:38,905
On the clear understanding that
this kind of thing can happen,

1460
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:40,239
Shall we dance?

1461
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,491
Shall we dance?

1462
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:43,285
Shall we dance?

1463
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,425
(SPEAKING) Why do you stop?
You dance pretty. Go on.

1464
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:03,346
Your Majesty, I didn't realize.
After all, I'm not a dancing girl.

1465
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:06,349
In England, no woman dances alone
while a man looks on.

1466
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:09,102
But she dances with
stranger, holding hands?

1467
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:11,270
Yes, but not always a stranger.

1468
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:14,524
- Usually a very good friend.
- Then we'll dance together.

1469
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,651
You show me. Teach, teach, teach.

1470
01:50:16,652 --> 01:50:18,486
It's quite simple, the polka.

1471
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:21,447
You count, "One, two, three,
and one, two, three...

1472
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:23,533
and one, two, three, and..."

1473
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:24,784

1474
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:26,035
One, two, three, and.

1475
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:29,413
On a bright cloud of

One, two, three, and.

01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:31,958
Shall we dance?

One, two, three, and.

1479
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:36,420
Shall we then say "goodnight"
and mean "goodbye?"

Splendid, splendid!

No, no. Not the way I see
Europeans dancing tonight.

Yes, it was. It was just like that.

hands like this.

Yes.

- Where is she?
- Secret police are questioning her.

Not yet.

Because of her, and even
more because of you.

01:57:58,321 --> 01:57:59,864
I'm coming.

1590
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,578
Mrs. Anna.

1591
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:08,205
ANNA: Lady Thiang. Your Highness.

1592
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:11,000
How nice of you
to come to say goodbye.

1593
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:13,836
Mrs. Anna, I do not
come for myself.

1594
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:16,415
I come for one
who must see you quickly.

1595
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:20,509
You may tell His Majesty
I am no longer subject to him.

1596
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,633
You do not understand.

1597
01:58:23,179 --> 01:58:24,801
Mrs. Anna...

1598
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:26,887
he is dying!

1599
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:29,852
Dying?

1600
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:31,305
The king?

1601
01:58:32,188 --> 01:58:35,358
Oh, no, Lady Thiang. What happened?

1602
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:39,900
Who can say what it is
that makes a man die?

1603
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:45,027
A sad heart that no longer wishes
to go on beating?

1604
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:50,372
Ever since night of great banquet, he
has shut himself away in palace...

1605
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:52,746
turning from all
who would speak to him...

1606
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:56,212
unwilling to sleep
or to nourish himself...

1607
01:58:56,755 --> 01:59:00,960
searching through many books,
only to push them aside in despair.

1608
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:05,552
Doctors warned him he must
change his ways quickly...

1609
01:59:06,556 --> 01:59:09,259
but he would not listen, Mrs. Anna.

1610
01:59:10,185 --> 01:59:12,137
He would not listen.

1611
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,598
I had no idea.

1612
01:59:15,607 --> 01:59:18,731
Everyone who knew
was forbidden to speak of it.

1613
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:22,564
And now,
doctors have no hope for him.

1614
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:25,741
CHOWFA: Mrs. Anna.

1615
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:27,785
ANNA: Your Highness.

1616
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:29,704
I am frightened, Mrs. Anna.

1617
01:59:29,871 --> 01:59:32,665
I am frightened
because I love my father...

1618
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:36,587
and also because if he
dies, I shall be king.

1619
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:39,540
And I do not know how to be.

1620
01:59:42,133 --> 01:59:46,133
Many men learn this after
they become kings, Your Highness.

1621
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:49,390
It will be good to think back...

1622
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:52,219
on all that
Mrs. Anna has taught you.

1623
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:59,310
When king heard you were sailing
tonight, he started to write letter.

1624
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:02,608
It was difficult for
him, Mrs. Anna.

1625
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:04,985
Very difficult.

1626
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:08,401
He has commanded
that I give it to you.

1627
02:00:16,918 --> 02:00:20,964
Please, may I hear what
my father has said, Mrs. Anna?

1628
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:36,512
"While I am lying here...

1629
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:38,890
I think perhaps I die.

1630
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:42,484
This heart which you say
I have not got...

1631
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:44,483
is matter of concern.

1632
02:00:45,947 --> 02:00:50,368
"It occurs to me that there shall be
nothing wrong that men shall die.

1633
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:53,162
"For all that matters about man...

1634
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:56,492
is that he shall have tried
his utmost best.

1635
02:00:57,834 --> 02:01:02,289
In looking back, I discover that
you think much on those people

1636
02:01:02,589 --> 02:01:05,633
who require that you
live up to best of self.

1637
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:10,051
You have spoken truth
to me always...

1638
02:01:10,889 --> 02:01:14,263
and for this I have often
lost my temper on you.

1639
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,686
But now I do not wish to die...

1640
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:20,731
without saying this gratitude...

1641
02:01:21,858 --> 02:01:25,403
and large respect,
et cetera, et cetera.

1642
02:01:26,946 --> 02:01:28,697
"I think it very strange...

1643
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:32,198
that a woman shall have been
most earnest help of all.

1644
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:35,704
But, Mrs. Anna,
you must remember...

1645
02:01:35,705 --> 02:01:38,909
that you have been
a very difficult woman...

1646
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:43,247
and much more difficult
than generality."

1647
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:50,215
We must hurry back now.

1648
02:01:51,846 --> 02:01:53,548
You will come?

1649
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:19,783
Mother...

1650
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:22,167
now that the king is dying...

1651
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:24,462
does that make you friends again?

1652
02:02:25,129 --> 02:02:27,127
I suppose so, Louis.

1653
02:02:27,632 --> 02:02:30,255
We can't hurt each other anymore.

1654
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:33,512
He always frightened me.

1655
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:36,598
I wish you had known him better.

1656
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:39,268
You two could have been
such good friends.

1657
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:43,314
In many ways he was
just as young as you.

1658
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:48,107
Was he as good a king
as he could have been?

1659
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:54,617
I don't think any man has ever been
as good a king as he could have been.

1660
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:57,828
But this one tried.

1661
02:02:58,538 --> 02:03:00,490
He tried very hard.

1662
02:03:03,585 --> 02:03:06,254
You really like him,
don't you, Mother?

1663
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:08,339
Yes, Louis.

1664
02:03:09,132 --> 02:03:11,130
I like him very much.

1665
02:03:12,093 --> 02:03:13,920
Very much indeed.

I do not see you, Mrs. Anna.

02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:56,053
Oh, no, Your Majesty.

This is not scientific.

1672

if I die or do not die.

02:04:04,854 --> 02:04:07,898

Can't we move you to your room?

No.

02:04:09,859 --> 02:04:12,687
I wish to remain here
in room with knowledge.

02:04:16,532 --> 02:04:18,530
You are leaving Siam?

1678
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:20,577
When?

1679
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:22,579

second proclamation.

1768
02:09:49,865 --> 02:09:52,363
Yes, what is second proclamation?
Make it, make it.

1769
02:09:52,952 --> 02:09:55,701
Regarding custom
of bowing to king...

1770
02:09:56,205 --> 02:09:58,407
in fashion of lowly toad.

1771
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:02,085
I do not believe
this is good thing.

1772
02:10:02,086 --> 02:10:04,546
Causing embarrassing fatigue
of body...

1773
02:10:04,547 --> 02:10:07,048
degrading experience for soul...

1774
02:10:07,049 --> 02:10:09,217
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1775
02:10:09,218 --> 02:10:11,091
This is bad thing.

1776
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:14,803
I believe.

1777
02:10:20,438 --> 02:10:23,266
You are angry with me, my father?

1778
02:10:23,733 --> 02:10:26,812
Oh, why do you ask question?

1779
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:29,610
If you are king...

1780
02:10:30,531 --> 02:10:32,984
you are king!

1781
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:37,242
Don't ask question of sick man.

1782
02:10:39,373 --> 02:10:40,620
Nor...

1783
02:10:41,208 --> 02:10:42,660
of woman.

1784
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:46,122
This proclamation...

1785
02:10:46,964 --> 02:10:49,132
against bowing to king...

1786
02:10:50,092 --> 02:10:53,922
I believe to be your fault.

1787
02:10:55,473 --> 02:10:57,801
Oh, I hope so, Your Majesty.

1788
02:10:58,934 --> 02:11:00,636
I do hope so.

1789
02:11:02,813 --> 02:11:04,640
Up! Rise up!

1790
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:10,945
Father?

1791
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,067
Up, up. up!

1792
02:11:15,159 --> 02:11:17,612
Like soldiers in lines.

1793
02:11:21,332 --> 02:11:23,159
It has been said.

1794
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:27,129
There shall be no more bowing...

1795
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:30,625
for showing...

1796
02:11:30,966 --> 02:11:32,634
respect...

1797
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:34,924
for king.

1798
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:42,223
It has been said by one...

1799
02:11:44,939 --> 02:11:47,107
who has been trained...

1800
02:11:48,275 --> 02:11:50,227
for royal...

1801
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:52,772
government.

1802
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:08,253
There shall be no bowing like toad.

1803
02:12:08,254 --> 02:12:09,587
No crouching.

1804
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:11,423
No crawling.

1805
02:12:11,424 --> 02:12:15,754
This does not mean, however, that
you do not show respect for king.

1806
02:12:16,178 --> 02:12:18,888
You will stand with
shoulders back...

1807
02:12:18,889 --> 02:12:21,217
and chin high, like this.

1808
02:12:22,351 --> 02:12:25,145
You will face king
with proud expression...

1809
02:12:25,146 --> 02:12:28,441
showing pride in self
as well as in king.

1810
02:12:29,567 --> 02:12:33,362
This is proper way for men
to show esteem for one another...

1811
02:12:33,404 --> 02:12:37,734
by looking upon each other's faces
with calmness of spirit...

1812
02:12:37,825 --> 02:12:40,743
eyes meeting eyes in equal gaze...

1813
02:12:40,744 --> 02:12:44,744
bodies upright, standing as men
were meant to stand...

1814
02:12:44,915 --> 02:12:47,789
with dignity and awareness of self.

1815
02:12:48,294 --> 02:12:50,588
So from this day forward...
