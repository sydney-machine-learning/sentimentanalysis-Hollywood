1
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,816
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Better loosen your belts</i>

2
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:12,062
<i>Only drink when you're all alone</i>
Or with somebody else</i>

3
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:16,757
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Let your money be seen</i>

4
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:21,936
<i>Only drink by day or night</i>
Or somewheres in between</i>

5
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,804
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
While the weather is clear</i>

6
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:31,880
<i>If it isn't rain and rain you'll know</i>
It's rainin' ale and beer</i>

7
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,946
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
If it isn't your day</i>

8
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:39,385
<i>A quart and pint mixed up just right</i>

9
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,617
<i>Will cure you right away</i>

10
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,160
<i>Away</i>

11
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,798
<i>Away</i>

12
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,763
Come in and sit a while, Murphy.

13
00:08:56,774 --> 00:09:00,540
We'll open the jug and toss a few.
Bring in the feed, Mol.

14
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:17,393
Jam, Joe, get her! Get her, Jam!

15
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,964
Jam, don't let her get away.
Get her!

16
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,597
Joe, come on!

17
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:28,904
There she goes.

18
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,133
Don't let her get away!

19
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,577
You're not gonna get me!

20
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:39,949
Here we go!

21
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:43,120
Never! Never! Never!

22
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,048
Let me go! Get off of me!

23
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,028
Holler uncle!

24
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:56,029
Molly, holler uncle!

25
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:59,829
I ain't never hollering uncle to you
or nobody! I ain't never down.

26
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:03,598
And even if I was,
you'd sure never hear it from me.

27
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:06,000
Holler uncle, Molly!

28
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:10,110
You're tuckered.
Why don't you quit?

29
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,406
Sure, I'm tuckered.

30
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,743
And I might give out,
but I won't give in.

31
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:18,012
How could anybody say I'm down?
Look, I'm blinking.

32
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:22,849
And I'm also thinking
how to break through. Maybe here!

33
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:25,762
Maybe here!

34
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:29,122
Maybe no place,
but there'll come a time...

35
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:33,929
...because nothing nor nobody
wants me down like I wants me up!

36
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,103
Up where the people are.
Up where the talking is.

37
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:39,105
Up where the joke's going on.

38
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,870
Now, look here.
I am important to me.

39
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,070
I ain't no bottom to no pile.

40
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:48,776
I mean much more to me
than I mean to anybody I ever knew!

41
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:53,615
Certainly more than any
siwash yazzyhampers like you guys.

42
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,519
Go ahead, break my arm.

43
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,061
Me say uncle? Ha!

44
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:01,356
Doesn't make a difference for you
to tell me I'm down...

45
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:03,693
...till I say so too.

46
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:09,504
Ever try stepping on a chigger bug?
Well, there's one now! Jump him!

47
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:12,676
You thinking you got him?
You thinking he's quick?

48
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,504
He don't think so.
There he goes!

49
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:16,407
And you can be positive sure...

50
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:19,208
...I'm as good as
any chigger bug ever lived!

51
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,646
I hate that word "down."

52
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:23,752
But I love the word "up"...

53
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:25,445
...because "up" means hope.

54
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,817
And that's just what I got. Hope...

55
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:32,086
...for someplace better,
someplace, I don't know...

56
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:35,663
...that's cleaner and shinier and...

57
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,368
Hell, if I gotta eat catfish heads
all my life...

58
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,038
...can't I have them off a plate once?

59
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:46,440
In a red silk dress.

60
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:50,273
<i>When there's girl enough on me</i>

61
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,915
<i>To wear one</i>

62
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:56,684
<i>And then someday</i>

63
00:11:56,887 --> 00:12:00,721
<i>With all my might and all my main</i>

64
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,888
<i>I'm gonna learn to read and write</i>

65
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,095
<i>I'm gonna see what there is to see</i>

66
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,394
<i>So if you go from nowhere</i>
On the road to somewhere</i>

67
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:17,131
<i>And you meet anyone you know</i>
It's me</i>

68
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,777
<i>I'm gonna move from place to place</i>

69
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:24,941
<i>And find a house with a golden stair</i>

70
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,743
<i>And if that house is red</i>

71
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:32,252
<i>And has a big brass bed</i>

72
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,993
<i>I'm livin' there</i>

73
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,026
Well, now.

74
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,857
Who do you think you are?

75
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:49,062
I could be anybody.
Even a queen if I wanted to be.

76
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,636
<i>We'd just been wrestlin'</i>
With a queen, if you please</i>

77
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:57,539
<i>Who'd recognize her</i>
With all that dirt on her knees</i>

78
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:01,511
<i>And with her mophead</i>
And all them toes</i>

79
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:04,947
<i>And that contraption</i>
She calls her nose</i>

80
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,148
<i>A queen can never be queen</i>
Without any throne</i>

81
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:13,154
<i>So here's the fanciest throne</i>
That you'll ever own</i>

82
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:17,089
<i>Here is your scepter</i>
Here is your crown</i>

83
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:20,002
<i>Now won't you please sit down</i>

84
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:12,685
Howdy there, partner.

85
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,641
Look at me! I'm a bird!
I can fly!

86
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,917
<i>To show that you know</i>

87
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:53,722
<i>You gotta show you know</i>
You know</i>

88
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:57,331
<i>I'm gonna learn to read and write</i>

89
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:01,599
<i>I'm gonna see what there is to see</i>

90
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:06,038
<i>So if you go from nowhere</i>
On the road to somewhere</i>

91
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:09,576
<i>And you meet anyone you know</i>
It's me</i>

92
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,216
<i>I'm gonna move from place to place</i>

93
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:17,517
<i>And find a house with a golden stair</i>

94
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:20,280
<i>And if that house is red</i>

95
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:24,928
<i>And has a big brass bed</i>

96
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:32,298
<i>I'm livin' there</i>

97
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,370
Why, I ought to...

98
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,080
This place could sure use a woman.

99
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,689
I got Molly.

100
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:59,518
Of course, she can't cook
worth a damn...

101
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,393
...and devil a bit of talent
she's got for housekeeping.

102
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,625
But she does her share.

103
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:07,827
Does most of the hunting and fishing.

104
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:11,337
Ain't it time somebody told
that motherless lass she's a girl?

105
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:15,367
She hunts and fishes,
whistles like a calliope.

106
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,241
And my boys tell me she swears
like a bargeman.

107
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:20,579
Been doing that since she was 3.

108
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,616
She's reached the age
for getting into trouble.

109
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:25,550
Time to marry her off, Shamus.

110
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,156
Marry? Who'd marry Molly?

111
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,594
Well, there must be somebody
who doesn't know her.

112
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,227
Whatever happened to that Johnson boy
who hung around here a while back?

113
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,526
He tried to show her his pa's hayloft.

114
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:42,832
She tied a can to his tail
and sent him rattling down the road.

115
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,942
That's been the only one.

116
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,472
There's your boys.

117
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,257
Molly, honey! I love you, baby!

118
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:29,878
You leaving home, Molly?

119
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,279
It's time, Pa.

120
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,253
I've thought it through.

121
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,593
There's nothing for me here.

122
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:40,593
Here, you're just born...

123
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:43,358
...and you live and you die.

124
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,562
What more is there, Molly?

125
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:50,171
Somewhere there's just
got to be things to see...

126
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:52,740
...and do more than
what there is here.

127
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:57,106
I'm gonna marry me a rich man
like IKatie Spinner did.

128
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:59,746
Be careful about the love of money.

129
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:02,581
Oh, it ain't the money I love, Pa.

130
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,981
It's the not having it I hate.

131
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:11,556
Somehow I'll get me to Denver,
and I'm gonna find me a man...

132
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:14,253
...with means to put
a real roof over our heads...

133
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:16,660
...a roof that
don't leak rain and cold.

134
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:19,201
I'm leaving at sunup, Pa.

135
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:20,370
I'll miss you.

136
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,543
I'll miss you too, Pa.

137
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:34,409
It's time I thanked you for
pulling me out of the flood...

138
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,614
...and raising me like your own.

139
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:42,451
I guess I didn't know much
about raising a girl.

140
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,157
Could be I done it wrong.

141
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,462
You done fine.

142
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:48,529
Nobody could've done better.

143
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,895
I'll send for you, Pa.
I promise that.

144
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,501
You'll have your own room...

145
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:57,162
...where you can stay in bed all day
with a jug of the best liquor.

146
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,371
I do that now.

147
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,841
Let me give you
a word of advice, Molly-girl.

148
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:08,147
Learn to serve God
and a hot breakfast.

149
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:11,846
And in your search for that roof
that don't leak rain...

150
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,080
...beware of men
that offer you a roof...

151
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,317
...and forget to mention marriage.

152
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:20,530
Find yourself a good man...

153
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:23,062
...a good Irish Catholic...

154
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:24,861
...and settle down.

155
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:32,233
The man I marry's got to be
more than just Irish Catholic.

156
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,244
What more can a man be?

157
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,544
Well, if he's gonna crawl in
next to me...

158
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:46,689
...he's gonna have to be the richest
Irish Catholic next to the Pope!

159
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,292
Howdy!

160
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:01,669
Howdy, Colorado!

161
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:11,910
<i>Colorado, my home sweet home</i>

162
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,804
<i>Hear yourself laugh</i>
And you laugh a lot more</i>

163
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:41,876
<i>Gives a man confidence</i>
To holler in the mountains</i>

164
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,919
<i>Hey there, Rio</i>

165
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,111
<i>Hey there, Rio Grande</i>

166
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:54,222
<i>Where else, Rio</i>

167
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:57,621
<i>Did you learn to roar</i>

168
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,955
<i>Well, I'll tell you</i>

169
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,390
<i>Let me tell you, Rio</i>

170
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:07,192
<i>Like me, you would be</i>

171
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,669
<i>Only a smalltime trickle</i>

172
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:16,010
<i>Without the mountains of Colorado</i>

173
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:21,150
<i>My home sweet home</i>

174
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:40,066
<i>A sky full of Rockies</i>
For my roof up there</i>

175
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,730
<i>A great golden meadow</i>
For my rockin' chair</i>

176
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:49,675
<i>A claim and a cabin</i>
And some breathin' air</i>

177
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:53,874
<i>Colorado, my home</i>

178
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:58,714
<i>And here till the Judgment</i>
I will stay</i>

179
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:03,154
<i>Here till the ponderosa walks away</i>

180
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,297
<i>Here where I'm proudest</i>
When I hear me say</i>

181
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:12,601
<i>Colorado, my home</i>

182
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:15,533
<i>Here's where the silver finds you</i>

183
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:19,675
<i>Together with the gold</i>
That will stick on your shoe</i>

184
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:24,814
<i>Missouri mules and plain damn fools</i>
May leave us for a little</i>

185
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:28,946
<i>But they'll all come back...</i>

186
00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:32,186
<i>... someday</i>

187
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:41,895
<i>There ain't Seven Wonders</i>

188
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,431
<i>Only three</i>

189
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:47,269
<i>The mountains and meadows</i>

190
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:50,463
<i>Far as a man can see</i>

191
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:55,611
<i>And somewhere a Rocky Mountain gal</i>
For me</i>

192
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,949
<i>Colorado, my home</i>

193
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,012
<i>Colorado...</i>

194
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:15,123
<i>... my...</i>

195
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:24,870
<i>... home</i>

196
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,890
How long you been there?

197
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,467
Long enough.

198
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:31,166
A nice pastime for a grown man.

199
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,966
- Go away.
- This here is my land.

200
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,940
You're trespassing.

201
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,772
What're you doing here?

202
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,481
Washing off the dust of the road.

203
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:45,246
My feet hurt.
I been walking for three days.

204
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:47,685
- Alone?
- Why not?

205
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:49,923
How far is it to Leadville?

206
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:54,321
Long ways. Maybe 10 miles.

207
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:56,996
- Where'd you sleep last night?
- Under a tree.

208
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:59,694
You're welcome to spend
the night in my cabin.

209
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:03,162
I am, am I?

210
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:06,468
If you think you're reading my mind,
you're wrong.

211
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:07,734
I ain't that needy.

212
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:10,204
Besides, you ain't that much,
you know.

213
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,849
You're no prize.

214
00:25:13,717 --> 00:25:17,346
Back home where I come from,
we drown runts of the litter like you.

215
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:23,022
When'd you eat last?

216
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,456
Yesterday morning.

217
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:28,756
I got a pot on the stove.

218
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:32,128
You can sleep under a tree,
if you're that mistrustful.

219
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:35,164
You'd better stoke up on some stew.

220
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:37,269
Come on. Let's eat.

221
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:40,408
That's real kind of you, Mr?

222
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,243
Brown. John J. Brown.

223
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:03,865
Come on in, set. Rest your feet.

224
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,932
It sure smells good.

225
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:15,710
What are you gonna do in Leadville?

226
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,515
It's just a stopping-off place
for me to get some money.

227
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,684
The place I'm really
heading for is Denver.

228
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,682
What's in Denver?

229
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:27,413
Beautiful people. Rich people.

230
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:32,061
I'm gonna get me a fine man.
A rich man. A millionaire.

231
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:33,760
It sounds like me.

232
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:37,364
I'm gonna learn to read and write.

233
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:39,930
Can you read?

234
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:41,126
Sure.

235
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:43,762
Schooling till I was 9.

236
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:52,412
Read me what this says.

237
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,760
"Best regards from...

238
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:08,523
...IKatie Spinner."

239
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,794
- What's that mean?
- What does what mean?

240
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:13,469
Regards.

241
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,363
It means not just regards...

242
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:21,807
...but best regards.

243
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:25,441
I see.

244
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:27,640
Best regards.

245
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:30,809
Whatever the hell that means.

246
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:32,485
And this one.

247
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:40,024
"Christmas greetings
from IKatie Spinner."

248
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:43,058
That must've been at Christmastime.

249
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:46,095
It must've been.

250
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,263
Ain't that beautiful?

251
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:54,036
Look at them big buildings.

252
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:56,937
What's the printing say?

253
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:01,373
That's " Pennsylvania Avenue...

254
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,711
...Denver, Colorado."

255
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:05,651
Pennsylvania Avenue.

256
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,983
That's where the rich folks live.

257
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,190
That's where I'm gonna live.

258
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:15,831
Before or after
you hook the millionaire?

259
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,900
- After.
- What're you gonna use for bait?

260
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:24,072
Chickapen, I'm sorry.

261
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:28,400
You got a real nice face.

262
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm probably the only man in 20 miles
who knows you're...

263
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:35,842
...a woman.

264
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:39,283
With a capital W and two O's.

265
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:41,389
Let's eat. I gotta get going.

266
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,991
Plenty of time.
Leadville's just over the hill.

267
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:49,829
"Just over the hill"?

268
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,724
Maybe a mile.

269
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:56,869
You said it was a "long ways."
You said, "Maybe 10 miles."

270
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,166
Welcome to spend the night
in your cabin.

271
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:01,807
You scabby he-goat!

272
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:05,072
My pa warned me about this.
But you're a smooth one.

273
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:08,308
Flimflam and sweet-talk,
and here I am under that roof!

274
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:09,348
What's the roof?

275
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,151
I'm getting out of here!

276
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:15,450
You double-tongued, low-minded,
sneaky, scheming polecat!

277
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:22,897
Oh, I knew I was gonna...

278
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:42,247
Howdy, Christmas. How's business?

279
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:43,851
There ain't any.

280
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:46,716
They all been over at the Nugget
since yesterday.

281
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:50,051
They got entertainment.
You ain't got no entertainment.

282
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,693
Yeah, I know.

283
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:55,259
I hear tell they got a gal
over there that sings.

284
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:57,433
Her sister plays the piano.

285
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:00,662
And every once in a while,
the singing one...

286
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,466
...she bends over to turn the pages
for the one playing the piano.

287
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,238
It's a great show.

288
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:13,409
You taken to doing
the sweeping yourself now?

289
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:17,643
Well, Henry left.
I gotta find me another helper.

290
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:19,646
I'm a helper.

291
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:22,885
It's a job for a man.

292
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:25,584
Oh, I can do it. I can do anything.

293
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:27,990
You're new in town.

294
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:31,827
I just got here. I need a place
to sleep and something to eat...

295
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:33,935
...and I'll work hard because...

296
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:36,105
...I got no money.

297
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,173
All right.

298
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:42,942
All right!

299
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:46,079
I'll give you a try. Come on.

300
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:50,418
Hey, Christmas, maybe she can sing.

301
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,584
Something smells real good.

302
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,485
Got a ham cooking in the kitchen.

303
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,922
Say, can you sing?

304
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:00,989
I can sing the hogs
out of the hills.

305
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:04,766
Get you a fancy dress
and fix your hair up.

306
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:07,368
You'll look as good
as them hens across the way.

307
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,197
You sure you can sing?

308
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:11,203
Oh, sure. Sure.

309
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:12,768
What's the matter?

310
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:16,277
I feel kind of funny.

311
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:19,214
I guess I'm awful hungry.

312
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,407
Oh, we'll get you something to eat.

313
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:24,252
- Can you handle a box?
- A box?

314
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:26,319
A piano. Can you play it?

315
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,183
A piano.

316
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:30,825
Oh, sure. Sure.

317
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:34,463
If you can play the piano and
you can sing, you got yourself a job.

318
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:37,394
I'll get you a fancy dress
and fix your...

319
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:39,398
<i>Belly, belly</i>

320
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:04,016
<i>Belly up</i>

321
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:08,122
<i>Belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Belly up to the bar, boys</i>

322
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:13,633
Where'd you go?

323
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:30,176
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Better loosen your belts</i>

324
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:34,313
<i>Only drink when you're all alone</i>
Or with somebody else</i>

325
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:38,550
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Better have a few more</i>

326
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,747
<i>I never whirl with a three-toed girl</i>
Or a discontented...</i>

327
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,357
<i>Horrible example</i>

328
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,687
<i>Like the girl whose name was Carrie</i>

329
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:47,954
<i>She carried her charms</i>
To everybody else</i>

330
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:52,066
<i>Her I had to marry</i>
Or die, die, die</i>

331
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:55,999
<i>Had to marry Carrie</i>
Or die, die, die</i>

332
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:16,523
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Let your money be seen</i>

333
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:20,662
<i>Only drink by day or night</i>
Or somewheres in between</i>

334
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:24,663
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>
Very good for your mind</i>

335
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:27,859
<i>Both feet on the rails</i>
Will make you fall on your be...</i>

336
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:29,834
<i>Hidle-deedle-didle-didle</i>

337
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:33,805
<i>I call her Fazelda</i>
She giggles at me and everybody else</i>

338
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,741
<i>Had to marry zelda</i>
Or die, die, die</i>

339
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:41,610
<i>Got to wed Fazelda</i>
Or die, die, die</i>

340
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,381
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

341
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:53,024
You left it in my cabin.

342
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,669
Thought you might want it.

343
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:02,200
Oh, yes.

344
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:07,968
I wouldn't wanna lose them
picture post cards of Denver.

345
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:11,212
Don't know what's the use of them
if you can't read them.

346
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:14,909
Oh, but I'm gonna learn to read.

347
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:17,946
Who's gonna teach you?

348
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:19,751
You?

349
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:29,530
"The cat sees the rat.

350
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:32,993
The rat sees the cat.

351
00:40:33,636 --> 00:40:36,070
The cat runs...

352
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:39,730
...after the rat.

353
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:42,576
This is my hat.

354
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:46,270
It is a red hat."

355
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:49,375
What happened to the rat?

356
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:51,017
The cat ate it.

357
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:58,018
"The little girl's name is Mary.
The little boy's name is Tom.

358
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,387
This is the barn.

359
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:01,859
Mary and Tom are in the hayloft.

360
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:06,158
This is Mary's mother.
She is baking a pie."

361
00:41:09,872 --> 00:41:13,000
She better stop baking
and go take a look in the barn.

362
00:41:14,443 --> 00:41:16,673
"My name is Molly Tobin.

363
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,809
My teacher is Johnny Brown."

364
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:21,643
That's real nice.

365
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:23,310
Thank you.

366
00:41:23,953 --> 00:41:28,083
I guess you'll be leaving real soon.
I hear the money's rolling in.

367
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,386
I had to buy some new clothes.
I got $50. It ain't enough.

368
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,623
What'd be enough, Molly?

369
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,993
Enough so's me and my pa could have
a roof over our heads...

370
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,225
...that don't leak rain and cold.

371
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:43,771
Go on, chickapen. I got to know.

372
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,740
Enough so's I could have stoves
for heating and cooking.

373
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:50,070
Enough so's I could have
my own brass bed.

374
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:52,975
Enough so's I could have
saucers that match the cups.

375
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:56,310
Enough so's my pa could stay in bed
all day with a jug...

376
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,043
...if he had a hankering to.

377
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:01,883
And enough so's
folks'd call me a lady.

378
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,259
That'd take a lot more than $50.

379
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,122
That's why I gotta find me
a miner with a rich claim.

380
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:10,763
I got a claim.
The side of Hippo Mountain.

381
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:12,593
Plenty of silver in it.

382
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:16,836
No fooling. A gentleman from
New York's been trying to buy it.

383
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,338
I ain't got much use for money,
but I do all right.

384
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:23,874
If the Hippo Mountain claim runs out,
I'll find me another.

385
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,173
Find you another? Just like that?

386
00:42:26,382 --> 00:42:30,079
Sure, it's easy because I got
a talent for it. Gold and silver...

387
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:32,220
...they just holler out to me.

388
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:35,151
Well, hell's fire!
Why don't you listen?

389
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:38,052
I'll take all I need out of it.

390
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:42,128
And I got my other piece of land
with a cabin on it.

391
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:46,427
That's real pretty land.
The stream and all. Remember?

392
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:49,834
But it needs a woman.

393
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:55,070
Get yourself one.

394
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,911
A gal could be happy there, Molly.

395
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:03,549
Why won't you settle for happiness?

396
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,781
<i>I'll never say no...</i>

397
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:10,959
<i>... to you</i>

398
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:16,487
<i>Whatever you say or do</i>

399
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,463
<i>If you ask me to wait...</i>

400
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:22,796
<i>... for a lifetime</i>

401
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:25,670
<i>You know I'll gladly wait</i>

402
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:29,606
<i>For a lifetime or two</i>

403
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,846
<i>Just to look at you</i>

404
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,518
<i>I'll smile when you say, "Be glad"</i>

405
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,520
<i>I'll weep if you want me sad</i>

406
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:54,867
<i>Today is tomorrow</i>

407
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,597
<i>If you want it so</i>

408
00:43:59,575 --> 00:44:04,512
<i>I'll stay or I'll go</i>

409
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:11,620
<i>But I'll never...</i>

410
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,846
<i>... say no</i>

411
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,018
I'd never even think twice.
I'd never even blink twice.

412
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,358
Ask me! Ask me anything you want!

413
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,297
I want a house with
a looking-out window.

414
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:29,596
One looking-out window for the lady!

415
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:35,640
<i>I'll never say no to you</i>

416
00:44:36,612 --> 00:44:38,409
- I want a red silk dress.
- Yes.

417
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:40,377
- I wanna go see Denver.
- Yes.

418
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,881
- I want my own brass bed.
- Yes!

419
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:45,747
- Oh, go jump in the lake.
- Yes!

420
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:51,287
No, Johnny!

421
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:57,622
<i>I'll never say no</i>

422
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:03,266
<i>Never say no</i>

423
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:19,782
No! You stay away from me,
Johnny Brown!

424
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,321
You got a danger sign on you
big as a house!

425
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:25,220
And I swore I'd get me
a rich husband in Denver!

426
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:28,089
A rich husband? Love or no love?

427
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,997
That's right!

428
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:33,594
I left home to get away
from a scrawly life...

429
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:35,963
...and the only way is
to marry the right man.

430
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:38,298
What makes you think
I ain't the right man?

431
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:42,042
Because you don't care.
You and that mine, you don't work.

432
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:46,078
So just stay away from me,
Johnny Brown, because...

433
00:45:47,283 --> 00:45:48,113
...because...

434
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:50,145
...because I can't lie.

435
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,687
I do have a feeling for you.

436
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:02,695
<i>I'll smile...</i>

437
00:46:03,332 --> 00:46:07,996
<i>... if you say, "Be glad"</i>

438
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:13,273
<i>I'll weep...</i>

439
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:18,611
<i>... if you want me sad</i>

440
00:46:21,317 --> 00:46:26,254
<i>Today is tomorrow</i>

441
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:31,691
<i>If you want it so</i>

442
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:40,024
<i>I'll stay...</i>

443
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:43,938
<i>... or I'll go</i>

444
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:54,948
<i>But I'll never...</i>

445
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,682
<i>... say no</i>

446
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,524
Let me go!

447
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:17,271
Let me go!

448
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,739
Let me!

449
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,312
You let me go. Let me go.

450
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:26,542
Nobody's gonna stop me.

451
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:29,217
Nothing's gonna get me down!

452
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:04,581
<i>I'll never say no...</i>

453
00:48:05,154 --> 00:48:06,849
<i>... to you</i>

454
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:13,894
<i>Whatever you say...</i>

455
00:48:14,163 --> 00:48:15,528
<i>... or do</i>

456
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:23,236
<i>And if you tell me you want me</i>
To wait for a lifetime</i>

457
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:26,567
<i>You know I'm gladly gonna wait</i>

458
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:30,302
<i>For a lifetime or two</i>

459
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:32,946
<i>Just to look at you</i>

460
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:38,382
<i>I'm gonna break right out laughin'</i>

461
00:48:38,587 --> 00:48:42,751
<i>If you tell me that you want me</i>
To be glad</i>

462
00:48:43,392 --> 00:48:45,485
<i>I'm gonna cry like a babe</i>

463
00:48:45,694 --> 00:48:49,630
<i>If you say that you want me to be sad</i>

464
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:53,534
<i>I'll laugh or cry</i>
I'll sob or sigh</i>

465
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:56,295
<i>I'll stay or I'll go</i>

466
00:48:57,473 --> 00:49:00,601
<i>But I'll never</i>

467
00:49:01,477 --> 00:49:04,173
<i>Never ever</i>

468
00:49:05,614 --> 00:49:09,744
<i>I'll never ever say no</i>

469
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:18,915
Howdy.

470
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:23,397
My, the way you're prettied up,
you'd think we was going to church...

471
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,430
...instead of showing me a mine.

472
00:49:25,634 --> 00:49:27,465
Didn't say I'd show you a mine.

473
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:29,933
You said you'd show me
what you been working on.

474
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:31,605
That's right.

475
00:49:39,781 --> 00:49:42,079
Johnny Brown, I know this place.

476
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:44,844
You're taking me to
the little ol' cabin of yours.

477
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,145
You know better!

478
00:49:46,355 --> 00:49:50,382
Now, hold your britches. I ain't
taking you to my "little ol' cabin."

479
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,026
It's my big, new cabin.

480
00:49:56,865 --> 00:50:00,164
Well, dip me and fry me!

481
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:02,928
Wait till you see
what I got to show you.

482
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:07,199
This here's the porch. Two rockers
for setting out on summer nights.

483
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:08,398
My, how nice!

484
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,381
This here is the main room.

485
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:23,081
I got a stove for heating.

486
00:50:26,328 --> 00:50:27,955
And a stove for cooking.

487
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,364
And cups with saucers that match.

488
00:50:48,383 --> 00:50:52,251
You sure do remember things,
Johnny Brown.

489
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:55,989
Things you say, chickapen.

490
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,092
Come on. Come on.

491
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:04,322
There's a room for your pa.

492
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:10,064
You built a room for Pa.

493
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:14,635
And a jug on the table
just waiting for him.

494
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:16,635
Come on.

495
00:51:32,294 --> 00:51:34,888
You got yourself a bed.

496
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,892
I'll say that for you, Johnny Brown.

497
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,091
You like it, Molly?

498
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,935
It's the most beautiful thing...

499
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:50,441
...I ever seen.

500
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,086
Look here.

501
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,429
You can do your bathing
inside the house.

502
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:13,829
Golly, ain't that something!

503
00:52:14,803 --> 00:52:17,237
It sure is pretty.

504
00:52:18,106 --> 00:52:20,472
Oh, that bed.

505
00:52:24,012 --> 00:52:26,446
It's so soft.

506
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:30,782
But real strong.

507
00:52:30,986 --> 00:52:33,250
It come all the way from Denver.

508
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:38,159
You done all this for me.

509
00:52:39,728 --> 00:52:43,255
Nobody never done nothing special
for me before...

510
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,691
...just for me...

511
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,400
...in my whole life.

512
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:57,175
We're getting married today.

513
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,317
It's against all the things
I ever dreamed of.

514
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,087
But it'd be against nature
for me to say no.

515
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:15,929
Besides, I sure couldn't stand
anybody else sleeping in that...

516
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:19,760
...beautiful brass bed,
with the stars shining...

517
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,128
Ready?

518
00:53:21,436 --> 00:53:22,596
Ready for what?

519
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:28,108
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

520
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,710
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

521
00:53:40,288 --> 00:53:42,188
You look so lovely, my dear.

522
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,255
Congratulations, Molly-doll.

523
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:47,155
Hurry up, Father,
before she changes her mind.

524
00:53:47,362 --> 00:53:48,829
Now, go on, get started.

525
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,054
You got the ring?

526
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:52,995
- The ring.
- Oh, the ring. Yeah, I got the ring.

527
00:53:53,902 --> 00:53:54,891
The ring.

528
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:56,331
The ring?

529
00:53:56,805 --> 00:53:58,432
- I forgot the ring!
- It's all right.

530
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:01,640
This'll do for now.

531
00:54:03,879 --> 00:54:05,540
Oh, I forgot. You!

532
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:08,045
Come on, it's your wedding.

533
00:54:16,525 --> 00:54:18,686
Christmas, it's that way.

534
00:54:20,295 --> 00:54:21,227
Good night.

535
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:22,828
Good night.

536
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:24,862
Good night, Polak.

537
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:30,033
The most beautiful wedding I ever saw.

538
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:43,143
Something wrong, Mrs. Brown?

539
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:46,547
A paper ring.

540
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:49,381
And no wedding dress.

541
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:53,452
And you're sozzled!

542
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:58,460
So's everybody.
It was a fine wedding.

543
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:00,592
Not for me.

544
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:03,127
Not for me!

545
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:07,197
What have I gone and done?

546
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,972
I've gone and married me a drunken...

547
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:13,147
...good-for-nothing miner
who don't even work at mining!

548
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:17,376
What's the use of cups and saucers
if you don't care?

549
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:21,184
I let myself be bamboozled...

550
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:24,983
...by a brass bed
and a cooking stove...

551
00:55:25,193 --> 00:55:26,956
...and a room for Pa...

552
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:29,460
...and a lot of fine talking.

553
00:55:29,898 --> 00:55:33,595
In my heart, it went "waboom"
when you touched me.

554
00:55:36,004 --> 00:55:38,495
What have I gone and done?

555
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:32,416
It's me, chickapen.

556
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,293
Are you all right?

557
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:42,629
Are you all right?

558
00:57:42,837 --> 00:57:44,566
Sure, darlin'.

559
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,175
That's good!

560
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:50,570
And now I'm getting out!

561
00:57:50,779 --> 00:57:52,576
- What for?
- What for?

562
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:56,609
Leaving me alone here for three days,
worrying my heart out.

563
00:57:56,818 --> 00:57:59,787
- Don't you wanna know where I been?
- I can guess.

564
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:03,185
No, you got it all wrong.
Now here, look. Look here.

565
00:58:08,596 --> 00:58:12,259
$300,000! Sold my claim
to that gentleman from New York.

566
00:58:12,467 --> 00:58:15,163
It took a while to sign
the papers and get the cash.

567
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:19,272
But now I'm back home.
You ain't mad at me, are you?

568
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:26,706
I thought you was mad at me for
carrying on so after the wedding.

569
00:58:26,915 --> 00:58:29,110
I thought you didn't want me.

570
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:30,682
Oh, chickapen.

571
00:58:31,686 --> 00:58:33,517
Calm down, girl.

572
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,021
I been traveling for three days...

573
00:58:37,225 --> 00:58:40,319
...and I ain't fit for a bride
and a fine brass bed.

574
00:58:41,329 --> 00:58:44,264
Well, I better go get washed up.

575
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:48,067
What're you gonna buy
with all that money?

576
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,462
My, I don't know.

577
00:58:50,672 --> 00:58:52,139
First, we'll send for Pa...

578
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,241
...and then we'll get you
a fine gold watch.

579
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,604
And you'll have
a real gold wedding ring.

580
00:58:57,812 --> 00:58:59,643
And a red dress.

581
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:02,940
And a "go to hell" hat!

582
01:03:15,703 --> 01:03:17,500
Is that you, Johnny?

583
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:22,074
It's me, darlin'. Just having
a little drink to warm myself up.

584
01:03:43,664 --> 01:03:46,428
That water sure is icy.

585
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:49,903
Your hair is real wet.

586
01:03:50,104 --> 01:03:52,265
I'm shaking with the cold.

587
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:54,799
I'm fine now.

588
01:03:55,376 --> 01:03:58,004
My backside's hot as a griddle.

589
01:03:58,312 --> 01:04:01,110
I was warming it by the fire.

590
01:04:01,616 --> 01:04:02,583
Fire?

591
01:04:03,484 --> 01:04:04,451
Fire?

592
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:05,482
What fire?

593
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:06,675
The stove.

594
01:04:11,993 --> 01:04:13,688
Molly-girl, what is it?

595
01:04:15,129 --> 01:04:17,461
What's the matter?
Have you gone crazy?

596
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:20,156
I hid the money in the stove!

597
01:04:20,468 --> 01:04:22,299
Water! Water!

598
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,068
Molly, you'll burn yourself.
Get away from there!

599
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,068
It's too late, Molly!

600
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:34,680
My ring's on fire!
My ring! Look, it's ashes.

601
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:38,978
Oh, the money and my ring.
Everything's gone.

602
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:45,359
Now, listen.

603
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,528
Now, look. No, listen!

604
01:04:47,728 --> 01:04:50,424
It's only money!
I can get us some more.

605
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:52,758
Listen to me.
Darlin', darlin'!

606
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:53,865
Darlin'!

607
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,313
Are you gonna wallop me?

608
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:10,006
What for?
It's me who lit the fire.

609
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:13,145
You ain't mad at me?

610
01:05:13,354 --> 01:05:15,015
Of course not.

611
01:05:16,057 --> 01:05:18,582
What was you chasing me
around the room for?

612
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:21,193
You was running.
I thought you was out of your skull.

613
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:23,056
What was you running for?

614
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:29,031
I was just scared. That's all.

615
01:05:29,237 --> 01:05:30,261
What?

616
01:05:31,339 --> 01:05:32,636
I was just...

617
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,667
...scared.

618
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:36,740
Of me?

619
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:39,504
I thought...

620
01:05:39,714 --> 01:05:42,080
I thought you was gonna wallop me.

621
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:46,153
I will wallop you
if you don't come on back to bed.

622
01:05:58,432 --> 01:05:59,592
Oh, now, now.

623
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,735
You don't wanna keep
that sobbing up all night.

624
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:06,971
I just can't seem to stop.

625
01:06:07,642 --> 01:06:09,906
I don't want you crying
over the money.

626
01:06:10,111 --> 01:06:11,476
I ain't.

627
01:06:11,979 --> 01:06:14,846
It's you being so forgiving and...

628
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:22,419
Now we'll never get to Denver!

629
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:29,929
Well, if you're gonna keep up
that weeping and wailing...

630
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:33,294
...might as well go out right now
and find me another mine.

631
01:06:35,736 --> 01:06:36,964
Come back!

632
01:06:37,171 --> 01:06:39,366
Talk to me, gold and silver!

633
01:06:39,573 --> 01:06:43,168
Holler loud, because I got a gal
that burns money up!

634
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:46,237
Come back!

635
01:06:46,447 --> 01:06:47,937
You gonna stop that crying?

636
01:06:48,149 --> 01:06:49,810
Yes, yes.

637
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:53,111
Oh, yes! Johnny, yes!

638
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:54,618
Say you love me.

639
01:06:57,058 --> 01:06:59,151
I love you, Johnny.

640
01:06:59,627 --> 01:07:01,117
That's better.

641
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:28,482
Ladies and gentlemen...

642
01:07:28,689 --> 01:07:31,886
...we are now entering
Pennsylvania Avenue.

643
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,527
Up and down
this beautiful avenue are...

644
01:07:34,729 --> 01:07:36,788
...the homes of the Sacred 36.

645
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:39,759
The crème de la crème of Denver.

646
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:42,299
The house on your left...

647
01:07:42,803 --> 01:07:44,964
...is the home of Mrs. McGraw...

648
01:07:45,172 --> 01:07:48,573
...the acknowledged leader
of Denver society.

649
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:53,470
And this is the new show place
of Pennsylvania Avenue.

650
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:58,015
It has just been remodeled
by Mr. And Mrs. J.J. Brown...

651
01:07:58,219 --> 01:08:00,050
...owner of the Little Johnny Mine...

652
01:08:00,254 --> 01:08:03,280
...the richest gold strike
in the history of Colorado.

653
01:08:03,657 --> 01:08:07,354
This mine has already
produced $ 10 million.

654
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:11,292
Fourteen million! And plenty more
where that come from.

655
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:13,131
Goodbye, folks!

656
01:08:13,334 --> 01:08:15,302
Have yourself a nice ride!

657
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:17,971
Don't believe everything
that fellow tells you.

658
01:08:18,406 --> 01:08:22,809
Pa, I told you, you mustn't do that
every day now. It ain't elegant.

659
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,978
I got nothing else to do.

660
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:28,047
Leave it lay.
How many times must I tell you?

661
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:31,241
I like a lived-in feeling
in one room of this fancy house.

662
01:08:31,452 --> 01:08:32,282
All right, Pa.

663
01:08:32,486 --> 01:08:35,421
And tell Hotchkiss
to fetch me a fresh jug.

664
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:38,216
- Sure, Pa.
- Thank you, darlin'.

665
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:41,887
Hotchkiss!

666
01:08:42,463 --> 01:08:43,361
Yes, madam.

667
01:08:43,564 --> 01:08:45,725
Get my pa another jug.

668
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,589
Yes, madam.

669
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:55,233
What's that?

670
01:08:55,443 --> 01:08:56,501
Present.

671
01:08:57,878 --> 01:08:59,072
What is it?

672
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,440
A new wedding ring.

673
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:02,445
What's wrong with this one?

674
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,118
That ain't the one you was
married with. I got another.

675
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,843
More fitting.

676
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,257
Now.

677
01:09:10,591 --> 01:09:15,358
Make sure you never ever take it off
unless I tell you to, chickapen.

678
01:09:15,796 --> 01:09:17,058
Promise me.

679
01:09:18,332 --> 01:09:19,765
I promise.

680
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:24,702
A cigar band!

681
01:09:24,905 --> 01:09:27,066
Indian head and all!

682
01:09:27,441 --> 01:09:30,410
And rubies and sapphires
and diamonds!

683
01:09:30,611 --> 01:09:34,274
The man said there ain't another
like it in the whole world.

684
01:09:35,015 --> 01:09:38,246
Oh, it's real beautiful, Johnny.

685
01:09:39,687 --> 01:09:40,881
Thank you.

686
01:09:41,589 --> 01:09:42,988
I'm glad you like it.

687
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:47,621
What do you wanna do today?

688
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:49,125
I don't know.

689
01:09:49,797 --> 01:09:51,321
Wanna go and buy something?

690
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:53,363
We done that yesterday.

691
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,998
Wanna go for a walk?

692
01:09:59,273 --> 01:10:01,537
Let's play another game of blackjack.

693
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,470
Excuse me. Mr. Cartwright
from the bank is downstairs.

694
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,944
You tell him we'll be right there.

695
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:11,244
Thank you, madam.

696
01:10:11,519 --> 01:10:14,716
Johnny, you go down and talk to him.
I gotta find my shoes.

697
01:10:15,556 --> 01:10:16,648
Hurry up.

698
01:10:18,926 --> 01:10:20,689
I'll be right down!

699
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:37,402
Howdy, Mr. Cartwright.

700
01:10:37,611 --> 01:10:39,977
- Nice to see you.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown.

701
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,671
- How's things at the bank?
- Fine.

702
01:10:42,883 --> 01:10:44,714
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

703
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:47,046
- Nice weather we've been having.
- Sit here.

704
01:10:47,254 --> 01:10:49,848
This one's a good chair.
Cost a pot of money.

705
01:10:50,057 --> 01:10:51,149
Thank you.

706
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,763
It's a pleasure to be seeing
one of Denver's Sacred 36 in our home.

707
01:10:57,965 --> 01:10:59,125
Sit, sit.

708
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,294
It gets lonesome around here.

709
01:11:01,502 --> 01:11:05,632
It's a fine idea for you to come here
instead of us running to the bank.

710
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:07,739
I understand.
I have the money here.

711
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:11,241
That's fine.
Now, you just set a while.

712
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,140
No, I must get back to the bank.

713
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:14,336
Hotchkiss!

714
01:11:15,282 --> 01:11:16,715
Hotchkiss, where's me jug?

715
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,879
Pa, say hello to Mr. Cartwright!

716
01:11:20,287 --> 01:11:22,414
Mr. Cartwright, say hello to my pa.

717
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,988
Howdy, Mr. Cartwright.

718
01:11:24,191 --> 01:11:27,160
Nice to see a new face.
It gets lonesome around here.

719
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:29,886
You'd think with a place
crawling with flunkies...

720
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:32,565
...a thirsty man could get
a jug now and then.

721
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:36,995
- Don't you wanna count it?
- I guess you've done that.

722
01:11:38,172 --> 01:11:39,104
Here.

723
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:42,500
How about some fudge?

724
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,371
Not right now, thank you.

725
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:46,678
Oh, you keep that.

726
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,347
Thank you, no.

727
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:50,742
I must get back to the bank.

728
01:11:51,986 --> 01:11:55,547
Well, drop in and see us again
sometime, Mr. Cartwright.

729
01:11:55,756 --> 01:11:57,018
Bring your friends.

730
01:11:57,224 --> 01:12:00,785
Oh, bring Mrs. Cartwright.
We're always here.

731
01:12:01,495 --> 01:12:02,723
Good heavens!

732
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,198
I've never seen anything like that.

733
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:07,560
It's solid gold!

734
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:09,792
Yep. That's what it is.

735
01:12:10,537 --> 01:12:13,301
I presume the "B" stands for Brown?

736
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:16,502
Well, it don't stand for backhouse.

737
01:12:18,812 --> 01:12:21,576
Mr. Cartwright,
you come back real soon.

738
01:12:22,516 --> 01:12:24,006
Thanks again.

739
01:12:24,218 --> 01:12:26,948
- You're welcome.
- You come and see us real soon.

740
01:12:27,154 --> 01:12:29,247
What's going on over there?

741
01:12:29,723 --> 01:12:32,624
It's the caterer delivering things
for Mrs. McGraw's party.

742
01:12:32,826 --> 01:12:33,918
Party? What party?

743
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:37,495
Mrs. McGraw gives a party every year
when her roses bloom. Goodbye.

744
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:41,767
Ain't that wonderful?

745
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:43,061
What?

746
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:47,932
She gives a party
when her roses bloom.

747
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:09,360
Good evening, Father.
I believe you all know Monsignor Ryan.

748
01:13:09,563 --> 01:13:13,659
You've been fortunate in the weather.
The garden is most attractive.

749
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:15,459
Oh, thank you.

750
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:19,298
I haven't been here since
the house next door was remodeled.

751
01:13:19,506 --> 01:13:21,974
Oh, yes. Dreadful, isn't it?

752
01:13:22,176 --> 01:13:25,009
But at least the noise
of the remodeling is over.

753
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:29,979
I've seen Mrs. Brown on the avenue.
She's a little strange.

754
01:13:30,184 --> 01:13:31,776
They overpay their servants.

755
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:34,886
The entire economy of
Pennsylvania Avenue has been affected.

756
01:13:35,089 --> 01:13:37,580
I'm told they drive
up and down the avenue...

757
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,760
...while she shouts
greetings to passersby.

758
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,054
Well, perhaps they're lonely.

759
01:13:43,564 --> 01:13:46,658
Have you called on them
to welcome them? Mrs. McGraw?

760
01:13:47,134 --> 01:13:48,101
Mrs. Fitzgerald?

761
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:51,965
Monsignor, have you seen the roses?

762
01:14:04,451 --> 01:14:07,181
Evening, folks.
Molly Brown's the name.

763
01:14:07,387 --> 01:14:10,254
This here's Johnny Brown,
owner of the Little Johnny.

764
01:14:10,457 --> 01:14:12,687
Richest mine in the United States.

765
01:14:13,227 --> 01:14:15,024
There you be, neighbor!

766
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:16,594
Howdy.

767
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:19,757
Brown's the name.

768
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:22,992
We're the ones from
that little shack next door.

769
01:14:23,203 --> 01:14:24,795
How do you do, Mrs. Brown?

770
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:26,267
Great!

771
01:14:26,473 --> 01:14:30,409
To tell you the truth, the Denver
water's a little hard on the kidneys...

772
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:32,203
...but we love it here.

773
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:33,844
Mr. Brown!

774
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:37,642
- Say hello to Mrs. McGraw.
- Sure. Howdy.

775
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:41,588
We was out for a walk
and saw your lights was on...

776
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:44,053
...so we just thought we'd drop in.

777
01:14:44,258 --> 01:14:46,351
May I present Monsignor Ryan.

778
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,687
Well, hello there, Monsignor.

779
01:14:48,896 --> 01:14:50,591
Glad to make your acquaintance.

780
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:52,288
- Mr. Brown.
- Howdy.

781
01:14:52,499 --> 01:14:54,831
I read about your school fund
in the paper.

782
01:14:55,035 --> 01:14:57,629
Here's $5000, and good luck.

783
01:15:01,675 --> 01:15:04,109
Well, I hardly know what to say.

784
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:06,336
God bless you, Mrs. Brown.

785
01:15:07,414 --> 01:15:09,177
What you standing there for?

786
01:15:09,383 --> 01:15:13,149
Match my 5000.
Or be high-class and double it.

787
01:15:13,353 --> 01:15:15,719
Sure. Glad to.
Here you are, Father.

788
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:18,414
One, two, three...

789
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:20,593
Took a few million out of God's earth.

790
01:15:20,794 --> 01:15:22,819
Guess He deserves a little kickback.

791
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:25,089
That should see them into heaven.

792
01:15:25,299 --> 01:15:28,097
Well, maybe it'll grease
the gates a little.

793
01:15:28,302 --> 01:15:29,667
Ten thousand.

794
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,770
I'm sorry it's all in ones.

795
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,232
God bless you both.

796
01:15:36,009 --> 01:15:37,567
Fifteen thousand dollars!

797
01:15:37,778 --> 01:15:38,802
Think nothing of it.

798
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:42,846
Once took 20 times that
just to warm J.J.'s backside.

799
01:15:46,086 --> 01:15:48,680
Besides, this here is our home now...

800
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:50,880
...and we wanna belong.

801
01:15:51,091 --> 01:15:52,854
Gotta keep up with Mrs. McGraw.

802
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,584
How much did you?

803
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:58,525
How much did you kick in, Gladys?

804
01:15:59,633 --> 01:16:02,397
Well, as a matter of fact, I...

805
01:16:03,871 --> 01:16:07,034
I haven't made my contribution yet.

806
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:08,538
- You haven't?
- No.

807
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:12,405
What's the matter with you, Gladys?
You got plenty, I hear.

808
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:14,508
Now, Roberts!

809
01:16:14,715 --> 01:16:16,774
Dinner is served, madam.

810
01:16:16,984 --> 01:16:19,509
Thank you. Shall we?

811
01:16:35,402 --> 01:16:38,894
Mrs. McGraw regrets that there
isn't room at the table for two more.

812
01:16:39,373 --> 01:16:42,069
She hopes you will excuse her.

813
01:16:42,276 --> 01:16:44,540
Well, we just popped in.

814
01:16:45,112 --> 01:16:46,841
Tell her it was great meeting her...

815
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:49,709
...and not to give the Browns
a second thought.

816
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,350
Yes, madam.

817
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,719
I'm sorry you aren't staying,
but I assume you had other plans.

818
01:16:57,124 --> 01:16:58,148
Oh, yes.

819
01:16:58,358 --> 01:16:59,916
We're pretty busy.

820
01:17:00,127 --> 01:17:03,358
You go on inside before
your supper gets cold.

821
01:17:03,563 --> 01:17:05,997
Good night, and may God go with you.

822
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:08,595
See you in church.

823
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:15,341
- Come on.
- Wait.

824
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:19,935
Wait. Oh, I just gotta see
how they do.

825
01:17:20,147 --> 01:17:21,273
Come on.

826
01:17:31,358 --> 01:17:33,223
Ain't that pretty?

827
01:17:33,427 --> 01:17:35,793
Why, there's plenty of room
at that table.

828
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,398
It sure smells good, Gladys.

829
01:17:45,105 --> 01:17:46,697
Eat hearty, folks!

830
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:58,443
Come on, Molly. Come on.

831
01:18:08,128 --> 01:18:10,062
Wasn't that fine?

832
01:18:10,464 --> 01:18:12,932
All them beautiful people.

833
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:15,733
Everything trimmed so gorgeous...

834
01:18:15,936 --> 01:18:18,200
...and the people is trimmed too.

835
01:18:18,438 --> 01:18:21,464
The good Lord outdid Hisself
on Pennsylvania Avenue...

836
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:24,166
...and we're right smack
in the middle of it.

837
01:18:24,378 --> 01:18:25,936
Did you have a good time?

838
01:18:26,146 --> 01:18:29,343
Had more fun in Leadville by accident
than they have on purpose.

839
01:18:29,549 --> 01:18:30,811
They're cold fish.

840
01:18:31,018 --> 01:18:33,816
Oh, no, that's dignity, Mr. Brown.
Dignity.

841
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:36,387
And we're gonna get us some.

842
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:44,129
They could've made room for us.

843
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:45,457
Well, howdy.

844
01:18:45,665 --> 01:18:46,825
Howdy, Shamus.

845
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:49,262
- Howdy, folks!
- She knows my name.

846
01:18:49,469 --> 01:18:51,460
I know plenty.

847
01:18:51,671 --> 01:18:54,504
Come in. Come in, you pretty thing.

848
01:18:57,577 --> 01:18:59,135
- Evening.
- Evening.

849
01:18:59,346 --> 01:19:01,405
We're having a bite to eat.
Come in.

850
01:19:01,615 --> 01:19:03,048
Thank you, kindly.

851
01:19:05,252 --> 01:19:07,413
How about a dish of stew?

852
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:10,085
I'd rather have a beer.

853
01:19:12,192 --> 01:19:15,457
That was sure a dreary party,
wasn't it?

854
01:19:15,662 --> 01:19:16,492
Was you there?

855
01:19:16,696 --> 01:19:20,154
No, but I was watching.
I'm Mrs. McGraw's ma.

856
01:19:22,969 --> 01:19:23,993
Howdy, Mrs. McGraw.

857
01:19:24,204 --> 01:19:26,638
Not Mrs. McGraw. Grogan.

858
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,001
Me daughter, Gladys,
married a McGraw...

859
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:31,803
...but I'm Mrs. Grogan.
Buttercup Grogan.

860
01:19:32,345 --> 01:19:34,040
How come you ain't at the party?

861
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:38,240
Ain't never invited to Gladys' parties.
She keeps me hid upstairs.

862
01:19:38,718 --> 01:19:40,413
- Hid?
- When she's company.

863
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,918
She's the leader of Denver society.

864
01:19:43,123 --> 01:19:45,421
That ain't a nice way to treat you.

865
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:48,719
I don't mind. Them friends of hers
with their pinkies up...

866
01:19:48,929 --> 01:19:50,556
...ain't my kind of folks.

867
01:19:52,065 --> 01:19:54,124
Well, it's sure good to be here.

868
01:19:54,334 --> 01:19:57,861
Took me a little time to get up
the nerve to come.

869
01:19:59,372 --> 01:20:01,340
What are you going to do about it?

870
01:20:01,942 --> 01:20:02,840
About what?

871
01:20:03,043 --> 01:20:05,841
About Gladys and the way
she gave you the brushoff.

872
01:20:06,746 --> 01:20:09,476
It wasn't neighborly,
and that's a fact.

873
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:11,679
There wasn't any room at the table.

874
01:20:11,885 --> 01:20:13,546
Bull sugar!

875
01:20:15,789 --> 01:20:18,883
Gladys is giving you the treatment.
Don't you let her.

876
01:20:19,092 --> 01:20:21,083
Mol doesn't need Mrs. McGraw.

877
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:24,491
Yes, she does. You're living here.
You've got to belong.

878
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:26,893
But Denver's giving you the go-by.

879
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,568
'Tis true.
We get pretty lonesome around here.

880
01:20:29,769 --> 01:20:31,794
Hold your tongue. We're doing fine.

881
01:20:32,005 --> 01:20:33,131
We ain't doing fine.

882
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,932
You ain't going about it right.

883
01:20:35,142 --> 01:20:38,043
You can't just yell "hello"
to folks in the street.

884
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:41,942
You must invite them formal to
your house, with printed invitations.

885
01:20:42,482 --> 01:20:43,540
A party!

886
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,718
With invitations printed in gold!

887
01:20:45,919 --> 01:20:47,250
That's the ticket!

888
01:20:47,454 --> 01:20:52,050
We'll give the biggest hellbender of
a party Pennsylvania Avenue ever seen!

889
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:53,385
A flaming toot!

890
01:20:53,593 --> 01:20:55,185
A randy Dan!

891
01:20:55,395 --> 01:20:59,331
With a band playing music, like at
Mrs. McGraw's, only bigger and louder!

892
01:21:22,622 --> 01:21:24,613
Come on back, chickapen.

893
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:30,660
If anybody wants to come, they'd know
for sure this is where the Browns live.

894
01:21:31,498 --> 01:21:33,523
Hell, you got it writ on everything...

895
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:36,293
...from the weathervane
to the hitching post.

896
01:21:38,171 --> 01:21:39,399
Now, come on.

897
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:41,470
It's after 10:00.

898
01:21:57,757 --> 01:22:00,248
I'm sorry it turned out
like this, Molly.

899
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,258
I bet you it was Gladys
what gave you the axe.

900
01:22:03,463 --> 01:22:04,657
I should've known.

901
01:22:05,031 --> 01:22:07,431
I'm walking Buttercup home, Mol.

902
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,065
Good night, Buttercup.

903
01:22:10,303 --> 01:22:12,635
- Good night, Molly.
- Thanks for coming.

904
01:22:16,576 --> 01:22:19,010
I'm sorry there ain't
no party, Monsignor.

905
01:22:19,212 --> 01:22:21,737
Sit down a minute, Molly, Johnny.

906
01:22:22,816 --> 01:22:26,912
I guess the Sacred 36 just
don't want no part of us.

907
01:22:29,489 --> 01:22:32,424
This is not New York or Paris.

908
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:35,727
Denver society is only
in its second generation.

909
01:22:35,929 --> 01:22:37,658
The veneer is thin.

910
01:22:38,798 --> 01:22:41,665
Now, true aristocrats
might accept you...

911
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:46,168
...but here, you're a painful reminder
of where they came from.

912
01:22:46,706 --> 01:22:50,506
You're unschooled, and you're full
of unharnessed enthusiasm.

913
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,702
Denver isn't sophisticated enough
to appreciate that.

914
01:22:53,913 --> 01:22:56,814
We should've stayed in the hills
where we belong.

915
01:22:57,517 --> 01:22:59,382
May I make a suggestion?

916
01:23:00,654 --> 01:23:02,849
- Shoot, Father.
- Take a trip.

917
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,417
A nice, long tour of Europe.

918
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:08,992
You'll enjoy it,
and you'll acquire a little polish.

919
01:23:09,195 --> 01:23:10,287
Polish?

920
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:12,096
Like what?

921
01:23:12,866 --> 01:23:15,528
Learn something about art and music.

922
01:23:16,069 --> 01:23:17,058
Learn manners.

923
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,635
Get a smattering of languages.

924
01:23:18,838 --> 01:23:21,500
All that just to show Mrs. McGraw?

925
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,899
Go ahead, Father.

926
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,839
I'm learning already.

927
01:23:27,647 --> 01:23:29,945
I've said enough.
I think you understand.

928
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:32,545
I'll say good night now.

929
01:23:33,286 --> 01:23:34,810
Thanks for the advice.

930
01:23:35,021 --> 01:23:38,354
You're right. We sure are ignorant.

931
01:23:38,825 --> 01:23:40,622
But we're gonna get schooled...

932
01:23:40,827 --> 01:23:45,093
...and harnessed and be
second-generation if it kills us.

933
01:23:45,298 --> 01:23:47,425
It won't. Good night, Molly.

934
01:23:47,634 --> 01:23:48,464
Good night.

935
01:23:50,136 --> 01:23:51,569
Thanks again.

936
01:23:53,773 --> 01:23:54,740
Look at it.

937
01:23:56,376 --> 01:23:58,469
Ain't it beautiful?

938
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,643
Pennsylvania Avenue...

939
01:24:02,849 --> 01:24:05,943
...I'll admit, you gave me
a nosefull of splinters...

940
01:24:06,152 --> 01:24:10,714
...but it's all good wood
from the very best doors.

941
01:24:11,324 --> 01:24:12,723
Come on, Mol.

942
01:24:17,931 --> 01:24:20,729
- Now we're going back to Leadville.
- Never.

943
01:24:20,934 --> 01:24:22,868
We ain't staying
where we're not wanted.

944
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:25,697
Johnny, I can't go back to Leadville.

945
01:24:26,172 --> 01:24:29,107
We gotta go one way or the other.
Ahead is better than back.

946
01:24:29,309 --> 01:24:32,210
I know what's back there.
Ahead is something new.

947
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:35,677
Maybe better, maybe not.
But I gotta find out.

948
01:24:35,882 --> 01:24:38,009
We don't belong in Europe.

949
01:24:38,551 --> 01:24:41,145
They'll split their satin britches
laughing at us!

950
01:24:41,354 --> 01:24:44,881
<i>I'll never say no to you</i>

951
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:46,285
I mean it, Mol.

952
01:24:46,826 --> 01:24:50,159
<i>Whatever you say or do</i>

953
01:24:50,363 --> 01:24:51,557
We ain't going.

954
01:24:51,765 --> 01:24:54,791
<i>Today is tomorrow</i>

955
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:57,333
<i>If you want it so</i>

956
01:24:57,537 --> 01:24:59,061
We're going back where we belong.

957
01:24:59,272 --> 01:25:03,231
<i>I'll stay or I'll go</i>

958
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:09,514
<i>But I'll never say...</i>

959
01:25:11,284 --> 01:25:13,775
We'll go down to hell and back
if you like.

960
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:17,346
I love you, Johnny.

961
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:20,422
Now, Mr. Brown.

962
01:25:20,627 --> 01:25:23,960
<i>We're gonna learn to read and write</i>

963
01:25:24,164 --> 01:25:25,392
In French!

964
01:25:25,799 --> 01:25:29,166
<i>We're gonna see what there is to see</i>

965
01:25:29,369 --> 01:25:30,734
In French!

966
01:25:31,104 --> 01:25:35,165
<i>For every one step backward</i>
We'll go two steps forward</i>

967
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:38,503
<i>Till we stake us a claim on dignity</i>

968
01:25:38,711 --> 01:25:40,303
In French!

969
01:25:43,983 --> 01:25:45,780
You hear that, Mrs. McGraw?

970
01:25:45,985 --> 01:25:48,818
The Browns are having a party!

971
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:52,452
And we ain't down yet!

972
01:28:36,522 --> 01:28:37,784
We got a new friend.

973
01:28:37,991 --> 01:28:40,016
Guess what?
He's a real live prince.

974
01:28:40,226 --> 01:28:43,320
Oh, ain't that something!
Because look what I got.

975
01:28:43,529 --> 01:28:45,497
And she's a grand duchess.

976
01:28:47,066 --> 01:28:48,033
Howdy.

977
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:50,030
Howdy?

978
01:28:54,207 --> 01:28:56,641
- Well, howdy.
- Howdy, madame.

979
01:29:04,517 --> 01:29:06,610
You two know each other.

980
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:08,582
Ain't that nice?

981
01:29:32,979 --> 01:29:35,174
Molly, dear, you are funny.

982
01:29:35,648 --> 01:29:38,116
Here, I'm funny.
In Denver, I'm vulgar.

983
01:29:38,317 --> 01:29:39,375
I guess it's like...

984
01:29:39,585 --> 01:29:42,315
...here, you eat snails.
At home, we step on them.

985
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:46,620
She has finally learned to eat snails.

986
01:29:46,826 --> 01:29:49,454
With this sauce,
you could eat erasers.

987
01:30:01,974 --> 01:30:03,839
Thank you.

988
01:30:08,848 --> 01:30:10,645
I can't find words.

989
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,478
And you know that's unusual for me.

990
01:30:18,091 --> 01:30:19,353
I want you to know...

991
01:30:19,559 --> 01:30:23,325
...I appreciate how sweet
you've been to I and J.J.

992
01:30:25,031 --> 01:30:26,794
J.J. And me.

993
01:30:27,467 --> 01:30:28,798
Me and J. J?

994
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:32,767
<i>Well, anyway, as we say,
merci beaucoup!</i>

995
01:30:33,639 --> 01:30:35,197
The candles, Molly.

996
01:30:41,013 --> 01:30:42,412
Thank you.

997
01:30:43,249 --> 01:30:44,511
Thank you.

998
01:30:46,219 --> 01:30:48,517
Many happy returns, Molly.

999
01:30:49,122 --> 01:30:53,149
You Frenchies sure are
a kissy bunch of bananas!

1000
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:57,486
It's because we love you.

1001
01:30:57,697 --> 01:31:00,666
You've been a breath
of fresh air in our world.

1002
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:03,301
I'm a bag of wind, all right.

1003
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:07,437
No, darling, it's true.
You're a stimulant to all of us.

1004
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:10,174
You like everybody and everything.

1005
01:31:10,376 --> 01:31:13,812
I'm interested in everything
because I don't know nothing.

1006
01:31:14,113 --> 01:31:15,512
That's not true, Molly.

1007
01:31:15,715 --> 01:31:18,013
But I'm learning.
I'm really learning.

1008
01:31:18,217 --> 01:31:21,948
I can sit through the opera
without going to sleep.

1009
01:31:22,155 --> 01:31:22,985
Here you are.

1010
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:26,989
And I can paint a bowl of fruit
that'll draw flies.

1011
01:31:28,394 --> 01:31:32,990
And I can say "hello" and "how much"
in 10 different languages.

1012
01:31:33,399 --> 01:31:36,766
Hell, I'm just a hog for knowledge.

1013
01:31:38,037 --> 01:31:40,972
Molly, what did Johnny give you
for your birthday?

1014
01:31:41,974 --> 01:31:43,942
Something real sweet.

1015
01:31:44,143 --> 01:31:46,236
With a lot of sentiment attached.

1016
01:31:46,445 --> 01:31:51,041
$300,000 in cash and a box of matches.

1017
01:31:53,085 --> 01:31:56,282
He told us how you burnt the money
in your little stove.

1018
01:32:04,096 --> 01:32:07,463
<i>Belly up, belly up to the bar, boys</i>

1019
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:09,658
<i>Better loosen your belts</i>

1020
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:13,095
<i>Only drink when you're all alone</i>

1021
01:32:13,306 --> 01:32:17,106
<i>Or with somebody else</i>

1022
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:21,474
<i>Somebody else</i>

1023
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:31,185
It wasn't nice to stay away
from my birthday party.

1024
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,482
You went without me.

1025
01:32:32,692 --> 01:32:36,628
I left early with the grand duchess
to arrange the place cards.

1026
01:32:37,163 --> 01:32:38,926
You said you'd join us.

1027
01:32:39,265 --> 01:32:42,257
I didn't think I'd be missed,
not with the prince there.

1028
01:32:42,468 --> 01:32:46,234
In case you don't know it,
and I think you do, he's gone on you.

1029
01:32:46,539 --> 01:32:47,733
So what if he is?

1030
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,737
That's the way in Europe.

1031
01:32:49,942 --> 01:32:51,068
You're in a mood.

1032
01:32:51,277 --> 01:32:52,335
I am.

1033
01:32:52,912 --> 01:32:54,607
You've been in a mood for days.

1034
01:32:54,814 --> 01:32:57,180
I sure have. I'm going plumb crazy.

1035
01:32:57,383 --> 01:33:00,011
It ain't the prince.
I know that ain't serious.

1036
01:33:00,219 --> 01:33:03,279
It's just that
I've had culture up to here.

1037
01:33:03,723 --> 01:33:06,783
Drunk tea till my eyes are bubbly
and wine till I'm woozy.

1038
01:33:06,993 --> 01:33:10,156
I can't get the hang of
their lingo and their manners.

1039
01:33:10,363 --> 01:33:12,763
- I'm homesick.
- Do I get to talk?

1040
01:33:12,965 --> 01:33:14,728
All the time!
I got something to...

1041
01:33:14,934 --> 01:33:16,902
Ladies first, Mr. Brown.

1042
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:21,363
I just wanted you to know
I thought it was time we went home.

1043
01:33:24,076 --> 01:33:26,169
Well, that's what I was gonna say.

1044
01:33:26,913 --> 01:33:28,312
You ain't fooling me?

1045
01:33:32,585 --> 01:33:35,019
Colorado! Home!

1046
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:36,849
I'll get tickets tomorrow.

1047
01:33:37,757 --> 01:33:40,191
You'd better get about 10 of them.

1048
01:33:42,461 --> 01:33:43,325
Ten of them?

1049
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:47,128
I invited the crowned heads
of Europe to be our guests.

1050
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:50,769
I promised the grand duchess
and the prince we'd show them Denver.

1051
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:53,397
They have to bring along
their friends.

1052
01:33:53,606 --> 01:33:56,837
Because royalty don't even
go to the shed unescorted.

1053
01:33:57,743 --> 01:34:00,507
You showing off Denver
to the crowned heads...

1054
01:34:00,713 --> 01:34:04,012
...or the crowned heads off
to Denver and Mrs. McGraw?

1055
01:34:04,216 --> 01:34:05,911
Mrs. McGraw?

1056
01:34:06,185 --> 01:34:08,915
I wouldn't give a widow's wart
for Mrs. McGraw.

1057
01:34:09,355 --> 01:34:12,722
Molly Brown, you're either
Iying to me or to yourself.

1058
01:34:13,259 --> 01:34:16,626
When will you stop trying to be her?
You ain't got it in you.

1059
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,763
I could be anything I want.

1060
01:34:18,965 --> 01:34:20,159
Maybe.

1061
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,191
I like the old Molly best.

1062
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:25,532
Well, that's too bad, J.J.

1063
01:34:25,738 --> 01:34:27,171
Because the old me ain't...

1064
01:34:28,307 --> 01:34:29,706
- isn't no more.

1065
01:34:29,909 --> 01:34:32,139
I've had a grand time putting
the new me together.

1066
01:34:32,345 --> 01:34:35,405
I'm sorry you don't take to us
because you paid the bills.

1067
01:34:35,614 --> 01:34:38,583
And I'm gonna keep right on
paying them, chickapen.

1068
01:34:39,218 --> 01:34:41,618
I love you with a heart and a half.

1069
01:34:42,455 --> 01:34:47,256
<i>We got dignity and culture</i>
We can</i> parler français

1070
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:52,997
<i>We've spent a million dollars</i>
On the</i> rue de la Paix

1071
01:34:53,366 --> 01:34:58,303
<i>But none of that'll matter</i>
Once we're on our way to</i>

1072
01:34:59,972 --> 01:35:03,669
<i>Colorado, our home</i>

1073
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:08,906
<i>Colorado</i>

1074
01:35:11,117 --> 01:35:13,244
<i>Our...</i>

1075
01:35:14,754 --> 01:35:16,619
<i>... home</i>

1076
01:35:54,226 --> 01:35:56,490
Howdy, everybody.

1077
01:35:57,329 --> 01:36:01,197
Welcome. Glad to see
you're here at last.

1078
01:36:04,036 --> 01:36:06,231
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Brown.

1079
01:36:07,706 --> 01:36:10,106
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1080
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:13,936
- Thank you for coming.
- I'm happy to be here, dear.

1081
01:36:14,947 --> 01:36:16,471
Good evening, Father.

1082
01:36:16,682 --> 01:36:18,172
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1083
01:36:18,384 --> 01:36:20,147
They're all here this evening.

1084
01:36:20,352 --> 01:36:21,614
Good evening, I...

1085
01:36:22,121 --> 01:36:23,952
Good heavens, look at this place.

1086
01:36:24,156 --> 01:36:27,284
It's frightening.
What period would you call it?

1087
01:36:27,493 --> 01:36:29,586
I'd call it the "Reign of Terror."

1088
01:36:30,329 --> 01:36:32,194
A touch of red might help.

1089
01:36:32,665 --> 01:36:34,462
She likes red.

1090
01:36:37,803 --> 01:36:39,998
- Good evening, Roberts.
- Good evening.

1091
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:42,731
I figured I needed him
more than you did.

1092
01:36:43,275 --> 01:36:45,743
- Welcome, Gladys.
- Thank you.

1093
01:36:45,945 --> 01:36:47,776
You know Mr. Broderick, of course.

1094
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,208
I don't know as I do.

1095
01:36:49,415 --> 01:36:52,111
Then let me introduce you
to one of your guests.

1096
01:36:52,318 --> 01:36:55,116
<i>This is Mr. Malcolm Broderick
of the Denver Record.</i>

1097
01:36:55,321 --> 01:36:57,755
- How do you do, Mr. Broderick?
- How do you do?

1098
01:36:57,957 --> 01:36:59,925
You're the society writer.

1099
01:37:00,126 --> 01:37:03,254
I used to read
your society talk every day.

1100
01:37:03,462 --> 01:37:06,431
Thank you, Mrs. Brown.
I hope you found it interesting.

1101
01:37:06,632 --> 01:37:09,567
No, but it was good practice
for my reading.

1102
01:37:09,768 --> 01:37:11,167
I see.

1103
01:37:11,437 --> 01:37:14,929
And how do you find Denver
after being away so long?

1104
01:37:15,374 --> 01:37:18,673
<i>I don't know, mon ami,</i>
but I'm going to find out.

1105
01:37:18,878 --> 01:37:20,368
One thing's for damn sure...

1106
01:37:20,579 --> 01:37:23,343
...we ain't putting up with
no Rocky Mountain rudeness.

1107
01:37:23,549 --> 01:37:26,245
We're second-generation now.

1108
01:37:27,887 --> 01:37:29,252
May I quote you?

1109
01:37:29,455 --> 01:37:32,015
Bet your bottom. Write it all down.

1110
01:37:32,224 --> 01:37:34,419
And talk about your Sacred 36.

1111
01:37:34,627 --> 01:37:37,790
Wait till you take a look
at my royal flush!

1112
01:37:37,997 --> 01:37:39,794
Now, Roberts.

1113
01:37:40,733 --> 01:37:42,633
Shall we?

1114
01:38:00,486 --> 01:38:04,149
His Highness, Prince Louis de Lanière!

1115
01:38:32,051 --> 01:38:34,849
The Count and Countess Ferranti!

1116
01:38:50,035 --> 01:38:51,059
How do you do?

1117
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:54,728
Baron IKarl Ludwig von Ettenburg!

1118
01:39:16,462 --> 01:39:19,192
What a beautiful painting.

1119
01:39:19,398 --> 01:39:21,491
Is it one of yours, my dear?

1120
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,190
Yes, Herr Baron.

1121
01:39:24,169 --> 01:39:27,730
<i>I have one of Mrs. Brown's paintings
hanging in my Schloss.</i>

1122
01:39:30,209 --> 01:39:32,404
That's his castle on the Rhine.

1123
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:35,307
- How do you do, Mrs. McGraw?
- How do you do?

1124
01:39:35,781 --> 01:39:37,339
Do you paint, my dear?

1125
01:39:40,552 --> 01:39:42,144
What a pity.

1126
01:39:44,556 --> 01:39:46,820
Her Royal Highness...

1127
01:39:47,026 --> 01:39:50,587
...the Grand Duchess Elise Lupovinova!

1128
01:39:55,701 --> 01:39:59,797
You're supposed to curtsy, Gladys.
She's a royal highness.

1129
01:40:13,285 --> 01:40:16,652
Molly, dear, I've been admiring
your magnificent piano.

1130
01:40:16,855 --> 01:40:19,323
I hope you'll play us
some Chopin later on.

1131
01:40:21,694 --> 01:40:23,958
Do you play, Mrs. McGraw?

1132
01:40:25,164 --> 01:40:27,029
No, Duchess...

1133
01:40:27,866 --> 01:40:29,356
Your Highness...

1134
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,263
Your Royal...

1135
01:40:33,906 --> 01:40:34,736
Sorry.

1136
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:36,937
What a pity.

1137
01:40:39,578 --> 01:40:42,775
Mrs. Buttercup Grogan!

1138
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:53,519
Hello, Gladys.

1139
01:41:16,415 --> 01:41:17,939
Surprise, surprise!

1140
01:41:32,564 --> 01:41:34,691
Ladies and gentlemen...

1141
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:39,068
<i>...these are our amis</i>
from Leadville.

1142
01:41:39,271 --> 01:41:41,933
<i>Amis,</i> hell. These are our friends!

1143
01:41:48,347 --> 01:41:52,408
<i>Standing here is Christmas Morgan</i>
Sings in the choir and pumps the organ</i>

1144
01:41:52,618 --> 01:41:54,586
<i>If I should yell,</i>
"I'm a-drownin', Morgan!"</i>

1145
01:41:54,787 --> 01:41:56,618
<i>He'd come chargin' in</i>

1146
01:41:56,822 --> 01:42:00,383
<i>He's my friend</i>
And he'll stay my friend</i>

1147
01:42:00,592 --> 01:42:04,255
<i>Doesn't matter what</i>
The other people say</i>

1148
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:08,265
<i>He's my friend</i>
To the bitter end</i>

1149
01:42:08,467 --> 01:42:12,836
<i>Even though the bitter end's</i>
A million years away</i>

1150
01:42:15,974 --> 01:42:17,908
<i>Call him Tobin or call him Shamus</i>

1151
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:19,941
<i>Beat him in a fight</i>
And you'll be famous</i>

1152
01:42:20,145 --> 01:42:22,113
<i>If I should yell,</i>
"They got me, Shamus!"</i>

1153
01:42:22,314 --> 01:42:24,248
<i>He'd come chargin' in</i>

1154
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:28,011
<i>He's my friend</i>
And he'll stay my friend</i>

1155
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,917
<i>Doesn't matter what</i>
The other people say</i>

1156
01:42:32,958 --> 01:42:36,052
<i>He's my friend</i>
To the bitter end</i>

1157
01:42:36,261 --> 01:42:40,561
<i>Even though the bitter end's</i>
A million years away</i>

1158
01:43:04,957 --> 01:43:08,916
<i>This lass is my good friend Buttercup</i>
Makes me heart go flip and flutter up</i>

1159
01:43:09,127 --> 01:43:12,858
<i>Talk behind my back to Buttercup</i>
She'll come chargin' in</i>

1160
01:43:13,332 --> 01:43:16,961
<i>She's my friend</i>
And she'll stay my friend</i>

1161
01:43:17,169 --> 01:43:20,832
<i>Doesn't matter what</i>
The other people say</i>

1162
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:24,937
<i>She's my friend</i>
To the bitter end</i>

1163
01:43:25,143 --> 01:43:29,477
<i>Even though the bitter end's</i>
A million years away</i>

1164
01:43:53,739 --> 01:43:57,869
<i>Denver ladies next to a duchess</i>
Sashay like they're walkin' on crutches</i>

1165
01:43:58,076 --> 01:44:01,944
<i>If anyone bothers this here duchess</i>
I'll come chargin' in</i>

1166
01:44:02,281 --> 01:44:05,717
<i>She's my friend</i>
And she'll stay my friend</i>

1167
01:44:05,918 --> 01:44:09,820
<i>Doesn't matter what</i>
The other people say</i>

1168
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:13,883
<i>She's my friend</i>
To the bitter end</i>

1169
01:44:14,092 --> 01:44:18,620
<i>Even though the bitter end's</i>
A million years away</i>

1170
01:44:24,336 --> 01:44:27,396
<i>The most extraordinary thing in town</i>

1171
01:44:27,873 --> 01:44:31,001
<i>Is the perfectly charming Molly Brown</i>

1172
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:36,413
<i>And if anyone dares to presume</i>
To display a disparaging frown</i>

1173
01:44:37,683 --> 01:44:40,277
<i>They'll have me to reckon with</i>

1174
01:44:40,485 --> 01:44:41,952
<i>And me</i>

1175
01:44:42,154 --> 01:44:43,644
<i>And me</i>

1176
01:44:43,855 --> 01:44:45,152
<i>And me</i>

1177
01:44:50,762 --> 01:44:53,754
<i>She's my friend</i>
And she'll stay my friend</i>

1178
01:44:53,966 --> 01:44:57,299
<i>Doesn't matter what</i>
The other people say</i>

1179
01:45:00,138 --> 01:45:02,800
<i>She's my friend</i>
To the bitter end</i>

1180
01:45:03,008 --> 01:45:07,240
<i>Even though the bitter end's</i>
A million years away</i>

1181
01:47:58,283 --> 01:47:59,409
Shocking!

1182
01:47:59,618 --> 01:48:02,348
It's a dance for a bawdyhouse.

1183
01:48:02,554 --> 01:48:05,887
My dear, that's the way she earned
her living in Leadville.

1184
01:48:25,477 --> 01:48:27,911
- Mother!
- Shut up, Gladys!

1185
01:48:28,113 --> 01:48:29,910
Timber!

1186
01:48:49,634 --> 01:48:51,226
Please stop!

1187
01:49:21,066 --> 01:49:24,934
Well, at last
this place looks lived in.

1188
01:49:25,303 --> 01:49:27,464
- Good morning, Mr. Tobin.
- Morning.

1189
01:49:27,672 --> 01:49:31,802
Molly sure knowed what she was doing
when she made this place red.

1190
01:49:32,177 --> 01:49:34,042
The blood don't show.

1191
01:49:35,146 --> 01:49:38,741
You're a better man
than I thought, Mr. Roberts.

1192
01:49:39,217 --> 01:49:41,651
You did fine last night.

1193
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,320
Thank you very much, sir.

1194
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:48,989
It's dreadful! Simply dreadful!

1195
01:49:49,194 --> 01:49:53,460
Your Mr. Broderick isn't a reporter.
He's an ignorant, spiteful barbarian.

1196
01:49:53,665 --> 01:49:55,530
But it's lies. All lies.

1197
01:49:55,734 --> 01:49:58,828
Everybody knows the Merry Christmas
Saloon ain't no fancy-house.

1198
01:49:59,037 --> 01:50:00,561
The things he quotes me saying.

1199
01:50:00,772 --> 01:50:03,935
All those blanks
that stand for bad words.

1200
01:50:05,777 --> 01:50:08,507
Well, I guess I did let a couple go.

1201
01:50:10,382 --> 01:50:12,612
"'One thing's for blank sure,'
said Mrs. Brown.

1202
01:50:12,817 --> 01:50:17,754
'We ain't putting up with no
blank-blank Rocky Mountain rudeness.'"

1203
01:50:18,123 --> 01:50:21,092
And worst of all, it ain't even
on the society page.

1204
01:50:21,293 --> 01:50:23,591
It's on the sports page!

1205
01:50:25,263 --> 01:50:29,427
It isn't only Broderick, Molly.
It's all of your Sacred 36.

1206
01:50:29,634 --> 01:50:33,092
They've sent flowers and invitations
to Louis, to me and to the others...

1207
01:50:33,305 --> 01:50:35,273
...but nothing for you and Johnny.

1208
01:50:35,473 --> 01:50:38,442
I've never known
such uncivilized behavior.

1209
01:50:38,643 --> 01:50:41,510
Things were pretty uncivilized
here last night.

1210
01:50:41,713 --> 01:50:43,840
But it wasn't your fault.

1211
01:50:44,916 --> 01:50:47,783
Louis and I think we should
go home as soon as possible.

1212
01:50:47,986 --> 01:50:49,613
- Yes.
- All of us.

1213
01:50:49,821 --> 01:50:53,018
You've outgrown Denver.
You cannot exist here, my darling.

1214
01:50:53,224 --> 01:50:55,215
The air is much too thin.

1215
01:50:55,427 --> 01:50:57,793
Sail with us on the next boat.

1216
01:51:00,999 --> 01:51:05,095
<i>You are not the same here, chérie.</i>
You were free and happy in Europe.

1217
01:51:05,837 --> 01:51:06,701
Come back.

1218
01:51:07,038 --> 01:51:09,905
Let me make a happy world
for you again.

1219
01:51:10,108 --> 01:51:11,166
Louis...

1220
01:51:12,110 --> 01:51:13,702
...let us tell the others.

1221
01:51:13,912 --> 01:51:18,246
You all read in this morning's paper
about a free-for-all battle...

1222
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:23,114
...that took place last night
in this million-dollar pile of rock.

1223
01:51:24,723 --> 01:51:27,590
At a party given by
an overnight millionaire...

1224
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:29,123
...named Johnny Brown...

1225
01:51:29,327 --> 01:51:32,296
...the guests were attacked
by drunken miners.

1226
01:51:32,497 --> 01:51:37,093
It is known that although Mrs. Brown
now buys her jewels by the bushel...

1227
01:51:37,302 --> 01:51:41,966
...only a short while ago, she was
a bargirl in a mining town saloon.

1228
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:48,745
Get out of here
before I load up again!

1229
01:51:48,947 --> 01:51:51,916
Get out of here, you Iying,
stinking polecats!

1230
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:54,118
Are you out of your skull?

1231
01:51:54,319 --> 01:51:56,947
They came sightseeing.
I'll give them something to see!

1232
01:51:57,155 --> 01:51:59,316
They ain't turning us
into no sideshow!

1233
01:51:59,524 --> 01:52:01,719
Looks like you're making it
a three-ring circus...

1234
01:52:01,926 --> 01:52:04,121
...firing out like
a liquored-up redskin.

1235
01:52:04,329 --> 01:52:08,163
Liquored up? You're a fine one
to be bellowing about liquored up.

1236
01:52:08,366 --> 01:52:10,766
You and your Leadville friends!

1237
01:52:10,969 --> 01:52:15,872
I wish we'd kept at it till we had
this whole house tore clear to shreds!

1238
01:52:16,074 --> 01:52:18,372
I hate this place!

1239
01:52:19,377 --> 01:52:22,346
Good! Because we're leaving.
We're going home to Europe.

1240
01:52:22,547 --> 01:52:24,344
We're going home to Leadville.

1241
01:52:24,549 --> 01:52:27,313
No, we are not.
I ain't living in Colorado.

1242
01:52:27,519 --> 01:52:29,384
The air is much too thin!

1243
01:52:29,587 --> 01:52:32,112
Learn to breathe it
because we're living in Leadville.

1244
01:52:32,323 --> 01:52:33,585
I'm living in Europe.

1245
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,488
You're my wife. You live
under the roof I give you!

1246
01:52:36,694 --> 01:52:38,491
And it's gonna be in Leadville.

1247
01:52:38,696 --> 01:52:40,857
Don't talk so bossy, Johnny Brown.

1248
01:52:41,066 --> 01:52:44,593
I got only one life to live,
and I ain't living it in Leadville.

1249
01:52:44,803 --> 01:52:46,964
Europe's been good to me.
I learned a lot.

1250
01:52:47,172 --> 01:52:49,936
And if you're too plumb stubborn
or too plumb lazy...

1251
01:52:50,141 --> 01:52:53,440
...or too plumb stupid to learn,
then the devil with you!

1252
01:53:03,021 --> 01:53:05,819
Maybe we're mismatched, Mr. Brown.

1253
01:53:06,758 --> 01:53:11,058
What you and me want out of this life
sure is different.

1254
01:53:13,331 --> 01:53:16,027
You don't know what you want.
You got rich too quick.

1255
01:53:16,234 --> 01:53:17,929
You're all mixed up.

1256
01:53:19,003 --> 01:53:21,437
I'm asking you for the last time.

1257
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:23,840
You coming with me?

1258
01:53:31,649 --> 01:53:34,447
All right. You go to Europe
with your prince.

1259
01:53:34,652 --> 01:53:36,176
I'm not going.

1260
01:53:37,388 --> 01:53:40,016
I'm saying no to you at last.

1261
01:53:41,459 --> 01:53:42,585
No.

1262
01:54:39,317 --> 01:54:42,753
Molly, what happened to us?

1263
01:54:47,025 --> 01:54:51,291
<i>I'll never say no</i>

1264
01:54:55,466 --> 01:54:59,402
<i>I'll never say no</i>

1265
01:55:03,541 --> 01:55:04,940
Damn you!

1266
01:55:08,947 --> 01:55:11,245
Damn you, Molly Brown!

1267
01:55:18,756 --> 01:55:22,248
I just got one favor
to ask you, Molly.

1268
01:55:24,028 --> 01:55:26,087
We said goodbye, didn't we?

1269
01:55:26,764 --> 01:55:27,696
All right.

1270
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:31,892
Now, just stay away.
Don't you never come back.

1271
01:55:33,605 --> 01:55:36,733
When you say goodbye, mean goodbye!

1272
01:55:38,476 --> 01:55:39,568
Remember...

1273
01:55:39,777 --> 01:55:42,143
...I said goodbye at Leadville once.

1274
01:55:42,747 --> 01:55:45,580
Well, I meant it. Didn't I?

1275
01:55:46,084 --> 01:55:48,348
<i>Said goodbye</i>

1276
01:55:48,553 --> 01:55:51,750
<i>And walked away</i>

1277
01:55:52,757 --> 01:55:57,091
<i>Walked away from all I know</i>

1278
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:02,588
<i>From the sky and the trees</i>

1279
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,237
<i>And the snowcapped mountains</i>

1280
01:56:08,539 --> 01:56:13,306
<i>Said goodbye and left forever</i>

1281
01:56:16,014 --> 01:56:20,508
<i>Because I loved you</i>

1282
01:56:24,255 --> 01:56:29,124
<i>Oh, I could say goodbye</i>

1283
01:56:29,327 --> 01:56:31,192
<i>To many things</i>

1284
01:56:32,664 --> 01:56:37,226
<i>Deep inside my heart</i>

1285
01:56:39,337 --> 01:56:43,535
<i>I could easy take that heart</i>

1286
01:56:43,741 --> 01:56:46,335
<i>And tear it free</i>

1287
01:56:46,544 --> 01:56:50,640
<i>From every kind of memory</i>

1288
01:56:52,984 --> 01:56:57,648
<i>And I could say goodbye someday</i>

1289
01:56:59,357 --> 01:57:01,757
<i>To life itself</i>

1290
01:57:01,959 --> 01:57:05,224
<i>No matter when</i>

1291
01:57:10,435 --> 01:57:14,496
Would you stay away, Molly?
Just stay away!

1292
01:57:19,644 --> 01:57:24,411
<i>For I could never say</i>

1293
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:29,913
<i>Goodbye to you</i>

1294
01:57:34,759 --> 01:57:37,751
<i>Again</i>

1295
01:58:12,230 --> 01:58:14,755
I ordered a Nebuchadnezzar
of champagne.

1296
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:19,133
Good thing he's a prince.
I sure couldn't afford a king.

1297
01:58:22,607 --> 01:58:24,507
With Molly, I am a king...

1298
01:58:24,709 --> 01:58:26,700
...because she is a queen.

1299
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:27,900
Well, a toast.

1300
01:58:28,112 --> 01:58:31,639
To our own Queen Molly. International
Molly, queen of the world.

1301
01:58:31,849 --> 01:58:33,009
Hail, hail.

1302
01:58:45,463 --> 01:58:47,021
Queen of the world.

1303
01:58:48,132 --> 01:58:49,531
At last.

1304
01:58:51,068 --> 01:58:53,298
Queen of the world.

1305
01:58:56,707 --> 01:58:58,436
Here is my scepter.

1306
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:01,507
Here is my crown.

1307
01:59:06,751 --> 01:59:09,219
I'm queen of the world, so bow.

1308
01:59:13,558 --> 01:59:18,154
I'm Molly Tobin,
queen of the lard pail.

1309
01:59:18,629 --> 01:59:19,823
Bow.

1310
01:59:20,865 --> 01:59:21,957
Curtsy.

1311
01:59:31,642 --> 01:59:33,906
Drop my drawers.

1312
01:59:34,212 --> 01:59:36,077
It's Gladys McGraw.

1313
01:59:41,552 --> 01:59:43,110
Aren't you going to curtsy?

1314
01:59:49,193 --> 01:59:51,718
No, I guess you aren't.

1315
01:59:52,363 --> 01:59:53,853
And why should you?

1316
01:59:54,499 --> 01:59:57,627
I'm a vulgar, extravagant, ignorant...

1317
01:59:57,835 --> 02:00:01,271
...nouveau riche
American expatriate...

1318
02:00:01,472 --> 02:00:05,932
...clowning for a bunch of people
I don't know and don't care about.

1319
02:00:06,644 --> 02:00:08,805
Just a figure of fun.

1320
02:00:21,025 --> 02:00:22,993
Nice to see you, Gladys.

1321
02:00:41,212 --> 02:00:43,373
And this is what I've become.

1322
02:00:45,917 --> 02:00:49,819
I guess, last of all, comes
something you can't buy with money.

1323
02:00:51,322 --> 02:00:54,519
Last of all, it's just
living with yourself.

1324
02:00:56,127 --> 02:00:58,118
Maybe I'm getting there.

1325
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:01,725
Maybe that's where I'm getting.

1326
02:01:04,602 --> 02:01:06,399
Johnny used to say:

1327
02:01:07,204 --> 02:01:09,570
"Why don't you settle for happiness?"

1328
02:01:12,243 --> 02:01:15,610
But I thought happiness was
all the things I was doing.

1329
02:01:16,013 --> 02:01:17,776
It was what I wanted.

1330
02:01:18,215 --> 02:01:20,240
It was what I dreamed of.

1331
02:01:24,221 --> 02:01:25,552
I don't know.

1332
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:29,683
I don't know.

1333
02:01:32,363 --> 02:01:34,991
Seem to be saying that
pretty often, nowadays.

1334
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:37,427
I don't know. I don't know.

1335
02:01:38,636 --> 02:01:40,467
A letter from Johnny.

1336
02:01:49,146 --> 02:01:50,773
"Dear Mrs. Brown:

1337
02:01:50,982 --> 02:01:52,540
The time has come.

1338
02:01:52,817 --> 02:01:55,843
You can take the ring off now.

1339
02:01:58,889 --> 02:02:00,186
Sincerely...

1340
02:02:01,192 --> 02:02:04,161
...J.J. Brown."

1341
02:02:10,134 --> 02:02:12,466
He can't even spell "sincerely."

1342
02:02:15,106 --> 02:02:17,700
But he was the one taught me to read.

1343
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,405
Oh, uncle!

1344
02:02:27,318 --> 02:02:29,013
Uncle.

1345
02:02:30,788 --> 02:02:31,914
Uncle?

1346
02:02:34,692 --> 02:02:37,490
It's an old American expression...

1347
02:02:39,030 --> 02:02:40,554
...for when you're down.

1348
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,929
And I'm down.

1349
02:02:45,936 --> 02:02:47,801
I'm down real low.

1350
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:55,044
You and I, Louis...

1351
02:02:57,281 --> 02:02:59,374
...we're just fooling ourselves.

1352
02:03:02,353 --> 02:03:03,547
Forgive me.

1353
02:03:04,488 --> 02:03:06,786
I know it's been rough on you.

1354
02:03:08,526 --> 02:03:10,118
I have tried...

1355
02:03:10,928 --> 02:03:13,055
...but it's against my nature.

1356
02:03:16,367 --> 02:03:17,857
Love is funny.

1357
02:03:19,236 --> 02:03:23,229
It's a lot harder to mine
than gold or silver.

1358
02:03:23,841 --> 02:03:25,638
I had a rich claim.

1359
02:03:26,277 --> 02:03:28,040
I wasn't working it.

1360
02:03:29,814 --> 02:03:31,509
So I lost it.

1361
02:03:42,693 --> 02:03:44,957
Do you really believe
he no longer means...

1362
02:03:45,162 --> 02:03:47,756
...what he wrote inside this ring?

1363
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:50,060
Inside the ring?

1364
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,760
The inscription.

1365
02:03:54,305 --> 02:03:56,569
Didn't know there was
an inscription.

1366
02:03:58,542 --> 02:04:01,272
Never had it off
since the day he put it on.

1367
02:04:02,346 --> 02:04:04,007
He made me promise not to.

1368
02:04:05,449 --> 02:04:07,974
"Always remember two things:

1369
02:04:08,652 --> 02:04:10,347
That I love you...

1370
02:04:11,789 --> 02:04:13,882
...and the name of the bank."

1371
02:04:22,733 --> 02:04:24,291
Maybe I...

1372
02:04:24,568 --> 02:04:26,502
...ain't down yet.

1373
02:05:14,051 --> 02:05:15,780
Oh, my God. George!

1374
02:05:19,623 --> 02:05:21,648
- We're all going to die!
- Stop it!

1375
02:05:21,859 --> 02:05:24,020
Stop it! Sit down!

1376
02:05:24,228 --> 02:05:27,664
Sit down! You're rocking the boat!
Stop yelling!

1377
02:05:37,341 --> 02:05:39,002
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

1378
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:42,111
No, we ain't! I ain't ready to die!

1379
02:05:42,313 --> 02:05:44,543
Hell, I'm just learning how to live!

1380
02:05:44,748 --> 02:05:47,876
There you are, honey.
Now, you keep warm.

1381
02:05:48,652 --> 02:05:49,914
Now, stop crying.

1382
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:51,644
Crying ain't gonna help.

1383
02:05:51,856 --> 02:05:53,118
Here, take these.

1384
02:05:53,324 --> 02:05:55,485
Now, you hold on real tight.

1385
02:05:55,693 --> 02:05:58,321
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die!

1386
02:05:58,529 --> 02:06:00,156
Oh, God!

1387
02:06:02,032 --> 02:06:03,192
What are we gonna do?

1388
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:05,095
Ladies and gent...

1389
02:06:05,302 --> 02:06:08,703
...did I ever tell you about the time
I was a bargirl in a saloon?

1390
02:06:08,906 --> 02:06:12,273
I sang a song that
I'm gonna teach you now.

1391
02:06:12,676 --> 02:06:14,473
And you'll learn all the words.

1392
02:06:14,678 --> 02:06:16,009
- I'll try.
- You too.

1393
02:06:16,213 --> 02:06:18,807
We'll never make it.
We're going to sink!

1394
02:06:19,016 --> 02:06:20,916
Not with Molly Brown onboard.

1395
02:06:21,118 --> 02:06:23,746
That ship may be down, but not me.

1396
02:06:23,954 --> 02:06:25,922
I'm unsinkable!

1397
02:06:27,291 --> 02:06:31,318
I survived the Colorado floods when I
was 6 months old, so this is nothing!

1398
02:06:31,528 --> 02:06:35,328
So we're gonna be all right if we
keep our heads. Now let's sing!

1399
02:06:43,841 --> 02:06:46,469
"Denver's heroine,
our own Mrs. J.J. Brown...

1400
02:06:46,677 --> 02:06:50,113
...who is known throughout the world
as the Unsinkable Molly Brown...

1401
02:06:50,314 --> 02:06:52,282
...returns to Denver today.

1402
02:06:52,783 --> 02:06:56,116
When interviewed during
her triumphant week in New York...

1403
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:57,810
...she made light of her heroism...

1404
02:06:58,022 --> 02:07:01,287
...despite the glowing reports
from her fellow passengers.

1405
02:07:01,492 --> 02:07:03,824
She said, 'I sure as blank...

1406
02:07:04,028 --> 02:07:07,589
...wasn't ready for
a blank-blank watery grave.

1407
02:07:07,798 --> 02:07:11,495
So I just blank, well,
took the others along with me.'

1408
02:07:13,203 --> 02:07:16,604
On her last day in New York,
the Unsinkable Mrs. Brown...

1409
02:07:16,807 --> 02:07:21,642
...was decorated by the
British government for her courage.

1410
02:07:23,147 --> 02:07:25,672
When asked about the medal, she said:

1411
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:30,884
'A girl can always use
another piece of jewelry.'"

1412
02:07:32,690 --> 02:07:34,817
She's here. She's here now.

1413
02:07:45,202 --> 02:07:47,227
Thank you. Thank you.

1414
02:07:47,438 --> 02:07:49,565
Oh, my goodness. Pa!

1415
02:07:51,442 --> 02:07:53,137
Oh, Buttercup!

1416
02:07:53,677 --> 02:07:54,803
Christmas!

1417
02:07:55,579 --> 02:07:56,807
Polak!

1418
02:07:57,648 --> 02:07:59,513
Hello, Father.

1419
02:08:03,687 --> 02:08:06,417
- Johnny not here?
- Hey, Mol, look who's coming!

1420
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:15,498
Welcome home, Molly.

1421
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:17,658
Thank you, Gladys.

1422
02:08:17,868 --> 02:08:19,995
It's very nice of you to come over.

1423
02:08:20,204 --> 02:08:22,502
- Come on, tell her!
- Yes. Mother and I...

1424
02:08:22,706 --> 02:08:25,869
We're throwing a party for you
to celebrate your homecoming.

1425
02:08:26,076 --> 02:08:29,477
The Sacred 36 is ready
and waiting for you.

1426
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:33,343
Now, get out of them traveling clothes,
and get into a party dress.

1427
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:34,915
Hurry! Hurry!

1428
02:08:35,853 --> 02:08:38,845
Yes, I'll join you as soon as I can.

1429
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:40,755
Thank you, Gladys.

1430
02:08:41,091 --> 02:08:42,888
You're a good sport.

1431
02:08:44,495 --> 02:08:46,793
Molly, you're quite a woman.

1432
02:08:49,933 --> 02:08:51,400
Hurry up, now.

1433
02:08:54,772 --> 02:08:59,300
Molly, darlin', you should see all the
telegrams, flowers, letters and all.

1434
02:08:59,843 --> 02:09:01,310
- Any letter from Johnny?
- No.

1435
02:09:01,512 --> 02:09:03,503
But he wasn't much
for writing letters.

1436
02:09:03,714 --> 02:09:05,147
Shamus!

1437
02:09:05,516 --> 02:09:09,111
- Go on.
- Coming! Hurry up, darlin'.

1438
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:19,222
- Hello, Roberts.
- Welcome home, Mrs. Brown.

1439
02:09:19,430 --> 02:09:20,829
Thank you.
