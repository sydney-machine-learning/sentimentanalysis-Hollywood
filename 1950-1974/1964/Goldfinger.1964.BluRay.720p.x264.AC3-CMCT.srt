1
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,890
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,810
Mr Romales and his friends will be out of business.

3
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,060
He won't be using heroin-flavoured bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,190
Don't go back to your hotel, ser. They'll be watching you.

5
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,490
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but

6
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,700
first I have some unfinished business to attend to.

7
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,010
Forgive me.

8
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,180
Why do you always wear that thing?

9
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,680
I have a slight inferiority complex.

10
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,850
Where was I?

11
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,620
Shocking!

12
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,880
Positively shocking.

13
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,320
Goldfinger.

14
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,990
He's the man.

15
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,700
The man with the Midas touch.

16
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,700
A spider's touch.

17
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,250
Such a cold finger.

18
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,880
Beckons you.

19
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,390
To enter his web of sin.

20
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,430
But don't go in.

21
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,360
Golden words he will pour in your ear.

22
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,190
But his lies can't disguise what you fear.

23
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,700
For a golden girl.

24
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,160
Knows when he's kissed her.

25
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,250
It's the kiss of death.

26
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,420
From Mr Goldfinger.

27
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,710
Pretty girl.

28
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,170
Beware of this heart of gold.

29
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,470
This heart is cold.

30
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,270
Golden words he will pour in your ear.

31
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,900
But his lies can't disguise what you fear.

32
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,780
For a golden girl.

33
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,200
Knows when he's kissed her.

34
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,700
It's the kiss of death.

35
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,660
From Mr Goldfinger.

36
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,420
Pretty girl.

37
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,550
Beware of this heart of gold.

38
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,550
This heart is cold.

39
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,970
He loves only gold.

40
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,520
Only gold.

41
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,770
He loves gold.

42
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,860
He loves only gold.

43
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,990
Only gold.

44
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
He loves gold.

45
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,070
- How's this?
- It's nice... Very nice.

46
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,540
- Just here?
- No, a little lower.

47
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,080
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

48
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,790
Felix! How are you?

49
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,960
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!

50
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,130
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

51
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,300
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

52
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,470
Man talk.

53
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,230
You must be slipping, 007, letting the opposition get that close to you.

54
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,600
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica.

55
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,860
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

56
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,570
Not any more, you're not. Signal from London.

57
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,280
I knew M wouldn't book me into the best hotel here out of gratitude.

58
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,490
He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.

59
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,700
Auric Goldfinger. Sounds like a French nail varnish!

60
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,200
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.

61
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,370
Big operator, worldwide interests. All seem reputable.

62
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,540
Owns one of the finest US stud farms.

63
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,540
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean.

64
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,710
And where do I find him?

65
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,220
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

66
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,230
Goldfinger's been taking him to the cleaners every day for a week.

67
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,320
Morning, Mr Simmons! Ready for our little game?

68
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,280
Sure. When you're ten grand in the hole, you're ready for anything.

69
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,070
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!

70
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,330
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

71
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,910
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.

72
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,080
Five dollars a point.

73
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,630
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.

74
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,090
OK.

75
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,760
I'll get back and cable M you're on the job.

76
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,050
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

77
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,780
- Four.
- So soon?

78
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,700
How many?

79
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,870
7, 12, 18, 32,

80
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,040
44.

81
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,680
Miss?

82
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,840
Hey, what are you...?

83
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,310
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!

84
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,470
Yes, I know.

85
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,020
You're very sweet.

86
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,450
He just drew the king of clubs. That makes his count 59.

87
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,200
He's got a diamond run: Eight, nine, ten.

88
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,910
He's holding on to the six of spades, so I guess he thinks you want it.

89
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,460
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

90
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,420
He needs kings and queens.

91
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

92
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,060
Come on, come on!

93
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,650
That's more like it!

94
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,110
- What's your name?
- Jill.

95
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,660
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

96
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,000
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.

97
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,870
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.

98
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,800
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.

99
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
Just seen?

100
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,550
Just seen.

101
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,720
I'm so glad.

102
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,270
You're much too nice to be mixed up in anything like this, you know.

103
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,650
Now hear this, Goldfinger. Your luck has just changed.

104
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,320
I doubt if the Miami Beach police would take kindly to what you're doing.

105
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,160
Nod your head if you agree.

106
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,330
Nod.

107
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,870
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.

108
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,130
Shall we say $10,000?

109
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,300
No, let's be generous.

110
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,470
Let's make it $15,000.

111
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,180
May I see?

112
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,230
Hell, I can see this is really my day!

113
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,400
Gin!

114
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,820
Over and out.

115
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,910
That should keep him occupied for quite some time.

116
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.

117
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,750
Call me James.

118
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,090
More than anyone I've met in a long time... James.

119
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,380
What on earth are we going to do about it?

120
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,880
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.

121
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,050
Where?

122
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,390
Well, I know the best place in town.

123
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,200
Station WEDS brings you the latest in world news.

124
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,580
Washington. At the White House today,

125
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,670
the President said he was entirely satisfied...

126
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,010
That makes two of us.

127
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,060
- Hello.
- Leiter here.

128
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,230
Felix! Well, now?

129
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,400
What's that? Dinner?

130
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,570
No, look, I'm sorry.

131
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,230
I can't. Something big's come up.

132
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,280
How about breakfast?

133
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,450
OK Not too early.

134
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,490
- I'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.

135
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,660
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.

136
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,010
It's lost its chill!

137
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,850
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.

138
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,520
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.

139
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,440
Such as drinking Dom Pignon '53

140
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,400
above a temperature of 38?Fahrenheit.

141
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,990
That's as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs.

142
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,540
Now... where is this passion juice?

143
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,990
Jill?

144
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Yes, Mr Bond?

145
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,580
Beach 79432. Room 119.

146
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,920
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.

147
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,050
Get over here right away.

148
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,550
- What's happened?
- The girl's dead.

149
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,560
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.

150
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,940
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.

151
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,820
Gold?

152
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,950
All over?

153
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,580
She died of skin suffocation. It can happen to cabaret dancers.

154
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,040
You should leave a small bare patch at the base of the spine

155
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,210
to allow the skin to breathe.

156
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,170
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.

157
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,260
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

158
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,430
It's an assignment like any other.

159
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,520
And if you can't treat it as such, coldly and objectively,

160
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,690
008 can replace you.

161
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,060
You've hardly distinguished yourself.

162
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,860
You were to observe Mr Goldfinger. Not borrow his girlfriend.

163
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,570
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe and it's only thanks to Leiter

164
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,780
and my diplomatic intervention

165
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,700
that you're not being held by the Miami Beach police!

166
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,870
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.

167
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,540
But I'm prepared to continue this assignment in the spirit you suggest

168
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,340
if I knew what it was about,

169
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,210
sir.

170
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,090
What do you know about gold? Not paint, bullion.

171
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,890
I know it when I see it.

172
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,850
Meet me here at seven.

173
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,020
Black tie.

174
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,990
What do you know about gold, Moneypenny?

175
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,860
The only gold I know about is the kind you wear.

176
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,530
You know, on the third finger of your left hand.

177
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,200
One of these days we really must look into that.

178
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,830
What about tonight? Come round for dinner

179
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,040
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

180
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,420
Nothing would give me greater pleasure

181
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,050
but unfortunately I do have a... business appointment.

182
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,220
That's the flimsiest excuse you've ever given me!

183
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,800
Some girls have all the luck!

184
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,970
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

185
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,310
and kindly omit the customary by-play with 007. He's dining with me

186
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
and I don't want him to be late.

187
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,150
So there's hope for me yet?

188
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,900
Moneypenny...

189
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,070
Won't you ever believe me?

190
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,870
We here at the Bank of England

191
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,790
are the official depository for gold bullion.

192
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,080
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky, is for the United States.

193
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,170
We know the amounts we each hold and the amounts deposited in other banks.

194
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,590
We can estimate what is being held for industrial purposes.

195
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,010
Thus, both governments can establish

196
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,470
the true value of the dollar and the pound.

197
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,970
Consequently, we are concerned with unauthorised leakages.

198
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,140
I take it you mean smuggling.

199
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,770
Yes.

200
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,610
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted down and recast, is all but untraceable,

201
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,030
which makes it, unlike diamonds, ideal for smuggling,

202
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,400
attracting the biggest and most ingenious criminals.

203
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,660
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.

204
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,080
Have a little more of this... rather disappointing brandy.

205
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,870
- What's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine,

206
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,040
indifferently blended, sir.

207
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,000
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

208
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,800
Colonel Smithers is giving the lecture, 007.

209
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,050
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger has gold bullion on deposit

210
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,970
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong - worth?0 million.

211
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,390
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?

212
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,230
The price of gold varies from country to country.

213
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,570
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce, you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

214
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,650
and triple your money.

215
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,990
- If you have facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?

216
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,740
Apart from being a legitimate bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...

217
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,750
No, that's not quite fair.

218
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,420
Is, among his many other interests, a legitimate international jeweller.

219
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,960
He's legally entitled to operate modest metallurgical installations.

220
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,550
His British one is down in Kent.

221
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,930
We've failed to discover how he transfers his gold overseas.

222
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,890
And Lord knows we've tried.

223
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,970
If your department can establish that it is done illegally,

224
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,270
the bank can take action to recover most of his holdings.

225
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,860
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and I met.

226
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,020
Socially, of course.

227
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,190
I was hoping you'd say that.

228
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,700
It might lead to a business talk... Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.

229
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,870
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.

230
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,830
This is the only one we have from the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.

231
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,000
But there are undoubtedly others.

232
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,460
Mr Bond can make whatever use of it he thinks fit.

233
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,880
Providing he returns it, of course.

234
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,050
It's worth 5,000.

235
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,350
You'll draw it from Q branch with your equipment in the morning.

236
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,060
Of course, sir.

237
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,330
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.

238
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,490
This way, please.

239
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,710
My, we are busy this morning!

240
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,750
It's not perfected yet.

241
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,510
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

242
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,550
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

243
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,180
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5 with modifications.

244
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,350
Now, pay attention, please.

245
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,570
Windscreen - bulletproof. As are the side and the rear windows.

246
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,820
Revolving number plates, naturally.

247
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,990
Valid all countries.

248
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,620
Here's a nice little transmitting device, called a homer.

249
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,250
You prime it by pressing that back like this. You see?

250
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,120
The smaller model is now standard field issue,

251
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,580
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

252
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,750
Its larger brother is magnetic.

253
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,300
Right. It'll be concealed in the car you're trailing while you keep out of sight.

254
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,510
Reception

255
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,680
on the dashboard here.

256
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,560
Audiovisual, range 150 miles.

257
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,360
Ingenious, and useful too.

258
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,270
Allow a man to stop off for a quick one en route.

259
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,150
It has not been perfected out of years of patient research

260
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,490
entirely for that purpose, 007.

261
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,870
And incidentally we'd appreciate its return, along with your other equipment.

262
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,870
Intact, for once, when you return from the field.

263
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,210
You'd be surprised at the wear and tear that goes on out there in the field.

264
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,550
- Anything else?
- I won't keep you for more than an hour

265
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,970
if you give me your undivided attention.

266
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,760
We've installed some interesting modifications.

267
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,890
You see this arm here?

268
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,310
Now, open the top and inside are your defence mechanism controls.

269
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,770
Smoke screen. Oil slick.

270
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,940
Rear bulletproof screen.

271
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,610
And left and right front-wing machine guns.

272
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,860
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about. You see the gear lever here?

273
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,030
Now, if you take the top off,

274
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,450
you'll find a little red button.

275
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,040
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?

276
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,040
Because you'll release this section of the roof

277
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,040
and engage and fire the passenger ejector seat.

278
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,550
Ejector seat? You're joking!

279
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,380
I never joke about my work, 007.

280
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,350
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.

281
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,640
An old member has dropped by, sir. Same handicap as yours.

282
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,810
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?

283
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,150
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?

284
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,440
This is Mr Goldfinger.

285
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,450
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

286
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,160
- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.

287
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,790
- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.
- That'll be splendid.

288
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,500
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

289
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,630
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.

290
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,050
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.

291
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
He's an admirable manservant

292
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,480
but mute. He's not a very good caddy.

293
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,770
Golf is not yet the national game of Korea.

294
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,740
This meeting is not a coincidence.

295
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,410
What's your game, Mr Bond?

296
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,970
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.

297
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,570
A 1940 smelt from the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

298
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,450
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1944.

299
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,620
When the Nazis were on the run.

300
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,660
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.

301
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,210
Interesting.

302
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,170
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

303
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,550
Then you have no objection to increasing the stakes?

304
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,760
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.

305
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,770
- It's worth 5,000.
- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent!

306
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,940
Naturally.

307
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,780
Strict rules of golf?

308
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,990
But of course.

309
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,150
Bad luck, you're in the rough.

310
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,910
What a pity. Here it is.

311
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,040
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.

312
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,500
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger. Five minutes are almost up.

313
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,630
A lost ball will cost you stroke and distance.

314
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,770
I'm still training him as a caddy.

315
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,070
Successfully, too.

316
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,820
Slazenger No. 1.

317
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,530
Good.

318
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,950
If that's his original ball, I'm Arnold Palmer.

319
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,870
It isn't.

320
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,080
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

321
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,670
Why, you crafty old...!

322
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,880
Leave it.

323
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,300
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.

324
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,550
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.

325
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,140
Like me to mark it or knock it in?

326
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,310
Play it.

327
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,690
- This for a half.
- That's right.

328
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,630
One to go, that will be the clincher.

329
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,090
Fine.

330
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,840
Did you switch 'em, sir?

331
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,760
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.

332
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,060
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.

333
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,880
Down in five.

334
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,670
I have to sink this to halve the game, right?

335
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,350
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!

336
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,440
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

337
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,070
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.

338
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,480
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

339
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,700
You must have played the wrong ball on the 18th fairway.

340
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,860
We are playing strict rules, so

341
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,490
I'm afraid you lose the hole and the match.

342
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,870
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

343
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,160
- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.

344
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,960
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths have crossed. Let's leave it at that.

345
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,460
Didn't our first meeting convince you?

346
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,800
I see. You're worried about me not giving you a return game.

347
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,970
Both of us know perfectly well what we're talking about, Mr Bond.

348
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,350
But I see that it is necessary to remind you.

349
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,520
Oddjob!

350
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,230
Many people have tried to involve themselves in my affairs.

351
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,400
Unsuccessfully.

352
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,460
Remarkable. But what does the club secretary have to say?

353
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,630
Nothing, Mr Bond.

354
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,800
I own the club.

355
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,130
I assume you want the cheque made out to cash.

356
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,590
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

357
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,680
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

358
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,940
I believe this is yours.

359
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,350
Can I have your attention, please?

360
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,020
British United Air Ferries announce the final call

361
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,320
for the departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

362
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:03,330
British United Air Ferries announce the departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

363
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,040
Mr Bond!

364
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,000
I've got you booked on the next flight to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.

365
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,170
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.

366
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,080
Discipline, 007.

367
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,880
Discipline.

368
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,720
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.

369
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,770
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.

370
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,940
You should've pulled over further.

371
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Look at them!

372
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,900
A double blowout. I've never seen one of these before.

373
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,780
- How could new tyres...?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.

374
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,950
I'm so glad it's the car and not you.

375
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,700
You don't look like a girl who should be ditched.

376
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,160
Never mind that. Please take me to a garage.

377
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,330
Certainly.

378
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,540
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...

379
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,710
As quickly as possible.

380
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,180
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

381
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,900
What's your name, by the way?

382
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,070
Soames. Tilly Soames.

383
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,700
Here for the hunting season?

384
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,700
I had a case just like that one.

385
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,250
It's for my ice skates.

386
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,000
Lovely sport.

387
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,710
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.

388
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,050
I didn't know there was ice there this time of the year.

389
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,510
There's a garage.

390
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,670
They say it'll take 24 hours to get new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.

391
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,300
- Jump in. I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.

392
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,470
I hate to leave you here alone.

393
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,640
I can take care of myself.

394
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,810
Yes, I'm sure you can.

395
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,100
Well... don't forget to write.

396
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,180
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.

397
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,510
And art requires...

398
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,350
In this case, the bodywork of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.

399
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,560
We dismantle it here.

400
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,610
Reduce the gold in this special furnace, which in turn...

401
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,780
weighing approximately two tons.

402
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,620
I make six trips a year to Europe in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.

403
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,410
It would be wiser to suspend your other activities.

404
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,170
Mr Ling, please assure your principals.

405
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,170
Operation Grand Slam will have my undivided attention...

406
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,520
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

407
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,740
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!

408
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,900
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

409
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,620
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!

410
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,790
TM. Tilly Masterson.

411
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,620
I knew your sister Jill. I know what he did to her.

412
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,790
No, you don't! Let me go!

413
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,250
- So why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!

414
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,710
Well, you're a lousy shot.

415
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,880
But somebody else around here isn't.

416
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,010
Come on.

417
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,730
Get in the car. I'll take care of him.

418
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,020
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

419
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,780
Now!

420
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,020
Good evening, 007.

421
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,190
My name is James Bond.

422
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,360
And members of your curious profession are few in number.

423
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,370
You have been recognised.

424
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:44,710
Let's say by one of your opposite numbers, who is also licensed to kill.

425
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,040
That interesting car of yours!

426
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,380
I, too, have a new toy, but

427
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,510
considerably more practical.

428
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,340
You are looking at an industrial laser,

429
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,550
which emits an extraordinary light, unknown in nature.

430
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,100
It can project a spot on the moon.

431
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:07,190
Or at closer range, cut through solid metal. I will show you.

432
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,260
This is gold, Mr Bond.

433
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,140
All my life, I've been in love with its colour,

434
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,890
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

435
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,350
I welcome any enterprise that will increase my stock,

436
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,360
which is considerable.

437
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,320
I think you've made your point. Thank you for the demonstration.

438
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:02,450
Choose your next witticism carefully, Mr Bond. It may be your last.

439
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,500
The purpose of our two encounters is now very clear to me.

440
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,330
I do not intend to be distracted by another. Good night, Mr Bond.

441
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,760
Do you expect me to talk?

442
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,010
No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!

443
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,180
There is nothing you can talk to me about that I don't already know.

444
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,740
You're forgetting one thing.

445
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,320
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

446
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,580
I trust he will be more successful.

447
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,670
He knows what I know.

448
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,000
You know nothing, Mr Bond.

449
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,590
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

450
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,820
Two words you may have overheard

451
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,830
which cannot have any significance to you or anyone in your organisation.

452
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,120
Can you afford to take that chance?

453
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,180
You are quite right, Mr Bond.

454
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,350
You are worth more to me alive.

455
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,340
Who are you?

456
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,180
My name is Pussy Galore.

457
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,980
I must be dreaming.

458
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,320
I thought I'd wake up dead.

459
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,950
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.

460
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,120
I see.

461
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,920
I'm delighted to be here.

462
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,550
And, by the way, where is here?

463
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,180
35,000 feet flying southwest over Newfoundland.

464
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,220
That explains the humming.

465
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:14,350
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.

466
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,850
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.

467
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,360
I never realised he enjoyed my company that much.

468
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,070
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

469
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,240
Mei-Lei.

470
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,610
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?

471
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:33,290
Just a drink. A martini, shaken not stirred.

472
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,460
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

473
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,670
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.

474
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,590
You are?

475
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,760
And just how personal is that?

476
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,300
I'm a damn good pilot.

477
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,510
Period!

478
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,100
Well, that's good news. By the way,

479
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,390
- where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.

480
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,360
Thank you.

481
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,530
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

482
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,870
This should be a memorable flight.

483
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,920
You can turn off the charm. I'm immune.

484
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,230
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

485
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:42,190
our port of entry into the United States, in 55 minutes.

486
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,940
Mei-Lei.

487
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,360
I would like to arrive more appropriately dressed.

488
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:51,280
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

489
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,450
And my attach? Case?

490
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,620
Black attach? Case damaged when examined. So sorry.

491
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,960
Apologies quite unnecessary.

492
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,840
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei to keep an eye on him.

493
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,270
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

494
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,940
Do you want to play it easy... or the hard way?

495
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,110
And this isn't a tranquilliser.

496
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,480
Pussy, you know a lot more about planes than guns.

497
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,900
That's a Smith & Wesson. 45.

498
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:05,950
If you fire this close, the bullet will pass through me and the fuselage

499
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,120
like a blowtorch through butter.

500
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,370
The cabin will depressurise and we'll be sucked into outer space together.

501
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,040
If that's how you want to arrive, you're welcome.

502
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,210
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

503
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,250
That's very sensible.

504
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,420
And there's so much going on around Mr Goldfinger,

505
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,680
I wouldn't dream of not accepting his... hospitality.

506
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,390
He'll be very glad to see you, too.

507
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,970
You like close shaves, don't you?

508
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,230
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.

509
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,150
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.

510
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,030
It's about 007, sir. We picked up his homer signal

511
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,740
from Friendship Airport, Baltimore, where he's just landed.

512
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,080
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

513
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,250
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

514
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,420
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.

515
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,210
Registered to our old friend Auric Goldfinger.

516
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,960
I'm glad he's making progress. Keep an eye on him for us.

517
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,260
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky, is their final destination.

518
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,050
Don't charge in on him and spoil anything, will you?

519
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,350
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

520
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,790
- Mr Bond.
- Of course.

521
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,210
Any time.

522
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,500
Thank you.

523
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:55,980
Do mind your step, Captain.

524
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,140
Just keep playing it easy.

525
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,690
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's all right with Mr Goldfinger?

526
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,070
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.

527
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,010
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.

528
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,850
Come on.

529
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:34,010
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

530
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,180
I believe the bourbon and branch water is rather splendid here in Kentucky.

531
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:41,600
Well, now that we're both off duty, perhaps...

532
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,400
Manners, Oddjob.

533
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,530
I thought you always took your hat off to a lady.

534
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:58,000
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.

535
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,170
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.

536
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,470
Your final briefing is tonight. That'll be all for now.

537
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,750
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.

538
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,920
Lovely animal, isn't she?

539
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,550
Certainly better bred than the owner.

540
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:31,130
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.

541
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,200
Felix!

542
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,660
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.

543
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,710
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.

544
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,710
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.

545
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,680
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole in his shoes.

546
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,730
Yeah, I like this!

547
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,650
Gentlemen!

548
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,370
Goldfinger, why weren't we told New York and the West Coast were in on this?

549
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,700
Look who's talking!

550
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,160
I do not do business with Chicago.

551
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:28,120
I thought we had a private business deal to settle.

552
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,880
Now I find I'm attending a hoods' convention.

553
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,250
Goldfinger, I made a delivery. Where is my money?

554
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,260
- I made a delivery, too.
- You all made the deliveries we agreed.

555
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,720
And you owe me one million bucks.

556
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,640
I owe each of you a million

557
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,810
in gold bullion.

558
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,980
So, pay!

559
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,730
Gentlemen, you can have the million today.

560
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,320
Or ten millions tomorrow.

561
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,610
Did you say ten million?

562
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,360
As soon as my bank opens in the morning.

563
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,490
Banks don't open on Sunday.

564
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,700
My bank will.

565
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,040
What's with that trick pool table?

566
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:28,350
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.

567
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:30,520
Turn those lights back on!

568
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,980
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

569
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,520
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

570
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,660
I don't like being cooped up like this. What's that map doing there?

571
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,460
This is my bank.

572
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:01,090
The gold depository at Fort Knox, gentlemen.

573
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,720
In its vaults are $15 billion.

574
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,390
The entire gold supply

575
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,520
of the United States.

576
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,440
Knock off Fort Knox!

577
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:18,270
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.

578
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,950
There are 35,000 troops stationed around there!

579
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,110
41,000.

580
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,700
And who's gonna say boo to them, Goldfinger?

581
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,700
- What's going on here?
- What is this?

582
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:33,160
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?

583
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,770
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

584
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,270
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

585
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,440
He has fired rockets to the moon.

586
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,610
Split the atom.

587
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,660
Achieved miracles

588
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,160
in every field of human endeavour... except crime!

589
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,790
The underworld will applaud for centuries!

590
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,080
- Cut the commercial!
- Get to the point!

591
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,830
It's pointless. The depository's impregnable.

592
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,710
- The joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!

593
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,550
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.

594
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,680
Larger, better protected perhaps, but nonetheless a bank!

595
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,390
It can be... I think the expression is

596
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,100
blown.

597
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,060
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!

598
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:45,440
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

599
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:48,320
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

600
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:52,110
Every detail has been scrupulously prepared.

601
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:54,950
Every eventuality has been considered.

602
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,490
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

603
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,660
Your organisation, Mr Midnight,

604
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:03,500
brought a batch of these canisters across the Canadian border.

605
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,090
They contain Delta 9.

606
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:09,510
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas

607
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:16,100
which disperses 15 minutes after inducing complete... unconsciousness

608
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,260
for 24 hours.

609
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,940
Tomorrow at dawn,

610
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:25,730
the flying circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy Galore,

611
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,190
will spray it into the atmosphere.

612
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,490
Once the population, including the military, has been immobilised

613
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,410
my task force, which Mr Strap and his people

614
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,540
smuggled across the Rio Grande from Mexico,

615
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:45,710
will approach Fort Knox in motorised equipment

616
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:49,750
along Bullion Boulevard, which runs past the depository here

617
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,090
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

618
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:56,890
This fence surrounding the depository,

619
01:11:57,010 --> 01:12:00,560
as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.

620
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,730
It will be dynamited!

621
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:06,230
My task force will then move to the main entrance and demolish it.

622
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,400
How, may I ask?

623
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,110
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By using your influence in shipping circles

624
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,660
to bring through customs uninspected

625
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,830
a consignment labelled machine parts.

626
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:23,790
All that will then remain is to descend to the vaults where the bullion is stored.

627
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,960
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.

628
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,420
If you have no objection... I'll take my money now.

629
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:33,170
What's the matter, Solo? Too big for you to handle?

630
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,180
We must respect Mr Solo's decision.

631
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:47,480
Excuse me for a moment while I take care of him. Make yourselves comfortable.

632
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,140
Pussy!

633
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,390
Who taught you judo?

634
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,730
The gun you took.

635
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,860
The gun.

636
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,860
The gun, of course.

637
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:47,960
We must have a few fast falls together some time.

638
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,390
Hey, Strap! He's got the right answers.

639
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,310
You and me don't even have to be there. The boys can handle everything.

640
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,950
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!

641
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,030
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?

642
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,250
The gas!

643
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:59,990
Such a pity you did not choose to remain with the others, Mr Solo. However...

644
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,240
Mr Bond, I thought you were resting in your quarters.

645
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:12,170
They are delightful. But it's much too nice to stay indoors.

646
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:15,960
I ran into Miss Galore and she suggested that we join you.

647
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,420
Mr Solo, Mr Bond. Another of my distinguished guests.

648
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:21,590
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?

649
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:26,390
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

650
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:29,060
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

651
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,770
My plane will get you to New York on time

652
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,350
with your excess luggage.

653
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,400
Allow me.

654
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:42,650
My chauffeur's an excellent driver. You will be at the airport in a few minutes.

655
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,320
Goodbye, Mr Solo. Some other time, perhaps?

656
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:47,490
Happy landings, old boy.

657
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,710
I found him under the model.

658
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:01,210
Operation Grand Slam. I did enjoy your briefing.

659
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,350
So did I.

660
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,780
He's on the move.

661
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,390
Slow down, don't crowd him.

662
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,580
Are you blind or something? You missed the turn!

663
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,190
They've turned to the right just ahead here somewhere.

664
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,050
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

665
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,550
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

666
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,930
Dead.

667
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:20,180
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.

668
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,350
Why would he do that?

669
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,690
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.

670
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,580
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will make you a very rich woman, my dear.

671
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,090
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?

672
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,720
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

673
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,840
No, I've spotted a little island in the Bahamas.

674
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:01,350
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing",

675
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:03,520
and go back to nature.

676
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:09,110
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.

677
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:12,530
Touts looking for racing tips.

678
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,070
There's another possibility, however.

679
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,240
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.

680
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:24,450
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life in Switzerland,

681
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,710
if those gentlemen are his friends.

682
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:29,670
Let's convince them he needs no assistance.

683
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,920
For their benefit, Pussy, let's make him as happy as possible.

684
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,050
I suggest you change into something more suitable.

685
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,550
Certainly.

686
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,350
Business before pleasure.

687
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,240
He wants you.

688
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,550
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.

689
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,720
Mint julep?

690
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,550
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.

691
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,060
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

692
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,140
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

693
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:31,100
You know Operation Grand Slam simply won't work.

694
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:34,360
And incidentally Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

695
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,150
You are unusually well informed, Mr Bond.

696
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,740
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

697
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:44,280
Ha! American motorists kill that many every two years.

698
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:47,870
Yes, well... I've worked out a few statistics of my own.

699
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,040
$15 billion

700
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:53,790
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

701
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:59,090
60 men would take 12 days to load it onto 200 trucks.

702
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,260
At the most, you'll have two hours

703
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,680
before the army, navy, air force, marines move in and make you put it back.

704
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,100
Who mentioned anything about removing it?

705
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,400
Is the julep tart enough for you?

706
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,530
You plan to break into the world's largest bank

707
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,950
but not to steal anything.

708
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:23,910
Why?

709
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:25,620
Go on, Mr Bond.

710
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:28,750
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent at the factory?

711
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,040
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...

712
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,170
But of course! His government's given you a bomb.

713
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,760
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

714
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,300
It's small but particularly dirty.

715
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:46,300
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.

716
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,180
If you explode it in Fort Knox, the...

717
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:55,020
entire gold supply of the United States will be radioactive for...

718
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:57,190
57 years.

719
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,110
58, to be exact.

720
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,780
I apologise, Goldfinger. It's an inspired deal.

721
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:06,990
They get what they want - economic chaos in the West.

722
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,040
And the value of your gold increases many times.

723
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,750
I conservatively estimate... ten times.

724
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,920
Brilliant.

725
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:20,630
But the atomic device, as you call it,

726
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,050
is already, obviously, in this country.

727
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:25,800
Obviously.

728
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:30,640
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

729
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,770
could be risky. Very risky.

730
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,690
On the contrary, Mr Bond. The risk is all on your side.

731
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,900
If the authorities should attempt to locate it,

732
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,530
who knows where it might be exploded?

733
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:44,860
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens at New London,

734
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,660
Cape Kennedy,

735
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,700
near the White House.

736
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:53,960
But we are speculating idly. Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

737
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,210
You will be there to see for yourself.

738
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,420
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

739
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:12,100
Forgive me, Mr Bond,

740
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:15,520
but I must arrange to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.

741
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:19,440
As you said, he had a pressing engagement.

742
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:21,860
Very chic, Miss Galore. Don't you agree?

743
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,570
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.

744
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,740
I'll join you both later.

745
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,290
How about it, handsome?

746
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:38,670
Don't you think it's time we got to know each other socially?

747
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:40,840
The new Miss Galore.

748
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,760
Where do you hide your gold knuckles in this outfit?

749
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,840
I never carry weapons after business hours.

750
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:49,010
Yeah? So you're off duty?

751
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,800
I'm completely defenceless.

752
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,810
So am I.

753
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:03,110
That's my James!

754
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,650
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

755
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:08,070
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

756
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,410
Too bad it all has to end tomorrow morning.

757
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:15,620
He's quite mad, you know.

758
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,960
Well, now. What do we have here?

759
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,670
007 seems to have the situation well in hand.

760
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,800
Come on, I'm bushed. Let's get back to the motel.

761
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,260
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.

762
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:34,890
I'd like to think you're not in all of this... caper.

763
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,140
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

764
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:41,350
What would it take for you to see things my way?

765
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,820
A lot more than you've got.

766
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,690
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.

767
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:53,240
Isn't it customary to grant a condemned man his last request?

768
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,410
You've asked for this.

769
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,090
Get up!

770
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:08,170
Certainly.

771
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,980
Now let's both play.

772
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:58,100
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

773
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,770
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!

774
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,420
Speed: 220.

775
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,040
Wind check: Westerly.

776
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,100
Champagne leader to Champagne section. Commence dive... now.

777
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,280
Ready for Rockabye Baby.

778
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,370
Commence spray on countdown.

779
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:58,870
Five,

780
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:02,200
four, three, two,

781
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:03,410
zero.

782
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:50,600
Champagne leader to Grand Slam task force leader.

783
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,730
The baby is asleep.

784
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:56,480
I repeat, the baby is asleep. We're going home now.

785
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,650
Out.

786
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,840
Good morning, Mr Bond.

787
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,510
For once, you are exactly where I want you.

788
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:40,750
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.

789
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:44,210
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.

790
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:47,960
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

791
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:52,050
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

792
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:54,550
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.

793
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:31,550
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

794
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,460
Mr Ling, it is merely timing...

795
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:42,580
He's one of them, so is the girl.

796
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,740
I'll get her, you get the door open.

797
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,090
We're trapped!

798
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:02,220
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.

799
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,020
Don't be a fool!

800
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,180
You can be a hero, I'm not!

801
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:13,360
No, no!

802
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:36,640
Keep going! Hurry up!

803
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,830
What kept you?

804
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:01,200
You OK, James? Where's your butler friend?

805
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,370
He blew a fuse.

806
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:07,750
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger would've hit the jackpot.

807
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:10,420
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.

808
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:13,680
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.

809
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,470
By the way, what made her call Washington?

810
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:21,930
I must have appealed to her maternal instincts.

811
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:30,980
Come on, James. Get aboard. You can't keep the President waiting.

812
01:45:33,610 --> 01:45:35,660
Special plane, lunch at the White House. How come?

813
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,240
The President wants to thank you personally.

814
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:41,790
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.

815
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:44,960
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.

816
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,170
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

817
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:49,920
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.

818
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,260
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.

819
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:54,420
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.

820
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,420
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.

821
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:32,380
Well, congratulations on your promotion, Goldfinger.

822
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:37,550
- Are you going to the White House, too?
- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.

823
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:42,390
You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Mr Bond.

824
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:46,600
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes. I even had to warn Pussy about it.

825
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:51,020
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.

826
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:53,730
She is where she ought to be... at the controls.

827
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:41,530
Pussy!

828
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,330
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.

829
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:51,790
It's no good.

830
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,120
Oh, no, you don't!

831
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:31,500
This is no time to be rescued.
