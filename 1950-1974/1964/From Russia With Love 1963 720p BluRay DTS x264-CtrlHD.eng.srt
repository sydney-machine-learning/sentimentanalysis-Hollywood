1
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,053
Exactly 1 minute 52 seconds.
That's excellent.

2
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,079
Check.

3
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,293
Knight takes bishop.

4
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,092
Knight... takes bishop.

5
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,605
King to rook two.

6
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:19,525
King... to rook two.

7
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:32,290
Queen to king four.

8
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,546
Queen... to king four.

9
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:51,395
My congratulations, sir. A brilliant coup.

10
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:18,509
Siamese fighting fish.
Fascinating creatures.

11
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:21,596
Brave, but on the whole stupid.

12
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:24,725
Yes, they're stupid.

13
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,936
Except for the occasional one

14
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:31,024
such as we have here.
He lets the other two fight

15
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:34,403
while he waits.

16
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:44,873
Waits until the survivor is so exhausted
that he cannot defend himself.

17
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:49,211
And then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.

18
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,216
I find the parallel amusing.

19
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,636
Our organisation did not arrange
for you to come over

20
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:59,098
from the Russians just for amusement,
Number Three.

21
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,355
Come in, Kronsteen.

22
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,526
Sit down, Number Three, while we listen
to what Number Five has devised for us.

23
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:14,783
I hope his efforts as director of planning
continue to be as successful as his chess.

24
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,535
They will be.

25
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:20,080
According to your instructions,
I've planned for SPECTRE

26
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,793
to steal from the Russians
their new Lektor decoding machine.

27
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,212
We need the services
of a female member

28
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:29,007
of the Russian Cryptograph Section
in Turkey

29
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:32,303
and... the help of
the British Secret Service.

30
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:35,391
Neither the Russians
nor the British will be aware

31
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:38,018
that they are now working for us.

32
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:42,023
Number Three, is your section ready
to carry out Kronsteen's directives?

33
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:46,485
Yes, Number One. The operation will be
organised according to Kronsteen's plan.

34
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,323
I have selected a suitable girl
from the Russian Consulate in lstanbul.

35
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,492
She's capable, cooperative,

36
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:55,372
and her loyalty to the state
is beyond question.

37
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:58,207
You're sure she believes you're still

38
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,960
head of operations
for Soviet lntelligence?

39
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:04,506
It is most unlikely she would know
I'm now working for SPECTRE.

40
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:08,804
Moscow kept my defection secret from
all but a few members of the presidium.

41
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,972
For your sake, I hope so.

42
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,850
Kronsteen, you're sure

43
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,977
this plan is foolproof?

44
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:21,149
Yes, it is. Because I have anticipated
every possible variation of countermove.

45
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:25,196
But what makes you think that M,
the head of British lntelligence,

46
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,367
will oblige you
by falling in with your plan?

47
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,787
Because this is so obviously a trap.

48
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:35,750
My reading of the British mentality is that
they always treat a trap as a challenge.

49
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,546
And they couldn't possibly
pass up even the slightest chance

50
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,592
of getting their hands
on the Lektor decoder.

51
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,803
They have wanted one for years.

52
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:48,097
All that you say could be true.
What else?

53
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:51,852
As an added refinement, I think
SPECTRE would have the chance

54
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:56,150
of a personal revenge
for the killing of our operative... Dr No.

55
00:10:56,275 --> 00:11:00,862
Because the man the British will almost
certainly use on a mission of this sort

56
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:03,282
would be their agent James Bond.

57
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:08,496
Let his death be a particularly
unpleasant and humiliating one.

58
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,039
Good.

59
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:13,210
I shall put my plan
into operation straight away.

60
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:15,337
And there will be no failure.

61
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:58,971
Hurry!

62
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:08,857
Welcome to SPECTRE lsland.
I hope you had a pleasant flight.

63
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:11,693
My time is limited.
Is the man I requested ready?

64
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,821
- His dossier.
- Good.

65
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:19,994
Donald Grant, convicted murderer.

66
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:25,084
Escaped Dartmoor Prison in 1960,
recruited in Tangier, 1962.

67
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,545
Excellent. Where is he now?

68
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,591
- At the lake.
- Bring him to my office, will you?

69
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:34,386
Take me to the lake.

70
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,098
Through the training area.

71
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,101
This Grant's one of the best men
we've ever had.

72
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,315
A homicidal paranoiac. Superb material,
though his methods were a little crude.

73
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,486
His response to our training
and indoctrination have been remarkable.

74
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:08,215
I hope our work here
meets with your approval.

75
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:12,012
Training is useful.
But there is no substitute for experience.

76
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:14,308
I agree. We use live targets as well.

77
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:30,241
- Call him!
- Grant!

78
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:59,775
He seems fit enough. Have him
report to me in lstanbul in 24 hours.

79
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,912
Corporal of State Security
Tatiana Romanova.

80
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,830
Come in.

81
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,425
You know who I am?

82
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,347
Colonel Klebb,
head of operations for... for SMERSH.

83
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:42,309
I saw you once in Moscow, when
I worked for the English decoding room.

84
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:45,021
Did you tell the consulate
you were coming here?

85
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,190
- No, the message...
- Yes, I know.

86
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,985
I sent it.

87
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,908
Your work record is excellent.

88
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:58,327
- The state is proud of you.
- Thank you, Comrade Colonel.

89
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,497
Take off your jacket.

90
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,045
Turn around.

91
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:09,465
You're a fine-looking girl.

92
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,468
Sit down.

93
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,518
I see you trained for the ballet.

94
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:22,147
But I grew an inch
over the regulation height and so...

95
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,316
And then you have had three lovers.

96
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,361
What is the purpose
of such an intimate question?

97
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,989
You're not here to ask questions!

98
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,491
You forget to whom you are speaking!

99
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,290
- I was in love.
- And if you were not in love?

100
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:43,797
I suppose that would depend...
on the man.

101
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,216
Sensible answer.

102
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:48,050
This man, for instance.

103
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:53,433
I cannot tell.
Perhaps if he was kind and kulturny.

104
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:58,354
Corporal, I have selected you
for a most important assignment.

105
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,651
Its purpose is to give
false information to the enemy.

106
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:04,820
If you complete it successfully,
you will be promoted.

107
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:08,241
From now on,
you will do anything he says.

108
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,993
And if I refuse?

109
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:13,413
Then you will not leave this room alive.

110
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,711
I will obey your orders.

111
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,047
Good. Now, these are your instructions.

112
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,674
You report to me here

113
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,429
but the consulate security man
must not know that I'm in lstanbul.

114
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:30,307
- This is classified far above his level.
- I will say nothing to anyone.

115
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,478
If you do, you will be shot!

116
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,983
Come, come, my dear.

117
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:42,739
You're very fortunate to have been chosen
for such a simple, delightful duty.

118
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:46,744
A real labour of love,

119
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:49,872
as we say.

120
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,008
- Great sport, this!
- What did you say?

121
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:03,096
I said it's great sport, this punting.

122
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,973
I couldn't agree with him more.

123
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,519
I may even give up golf for it.

124
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:10,354
Really?

125
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,608
Not quite.

126
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:18,947
Souvenir from another jealous woman?

127
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:22,450
Yes. But I haven't turned
my back on one since.

128
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,876
- Excuse me.
- What?

129
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,050
- Give me my shirt, will you?
- What's going on?

130
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:40,472
- I have to make a phone call.
- But we haven't eaten yet.

131
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:43,182
I'm starving.

132
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:47,980
Come in, Univex. James Bond here. Over.

133
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:52,527
He's been asking for you all morning.
Where in the world are you, James?

134
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:56,657
Well, I've just been reviewing an old case.

135
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:00,202
- Oh, so I'm an old case now, am l?
- Ssh! It's the office.

136
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:03,665
- Tell him I'm on my way, will you?
- He is not on his way.

137
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,211
Sylvia, behave! We'll do this again
some other time soon.

138
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:10,882
Do what? Last time you said that,
you went off to Jamaica.

139
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,634
I haven't seen you for six months!

140
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:17,680
- I'll be there in an hour.
- I'll tell him.

141
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:21,976
Hey, your old case
sounds interesting, James.

142
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:25,773
Make that an hour and a half.

143
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,740
Now, about that lunch.

144
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,958
For my next miracle, l...

145
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,437
It'll be a miracle if he can explain
where he's been all day.

146
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:02,690
But I've never even heard
of a Tatiana Romanova.

147
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,527
- Ridiculous, isn't it?
- It's absolutely crazy.

148
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:09,115
Of course, girls do fall in love
with pictures of film stars.

149
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:14,497
But not a Russian cipher clerk
with a file photo of a British agent!

150
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,373
Unless she's mental.

151
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,626
No, it's some sort of trap.

152
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:24,465
Well, obviously. And the bait
is a cipher machine. A brand new Lektor.

153
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,051
A Lektor, no less.

154
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,347
The CIA's been after one for years.

155
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:30,805
Yes, so have we.

156
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:35,437
When she contacted Kerim Bey,
head of Station T, Turkey,

157
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:40,026
and told him she wanted to defect,
she said she'd turn it over to us.

158
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,068
On one condition.

159
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:47,241
That you went out to lstanbul and brought
her and the machine back to England.

160
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:50,954
Here's a snapshot
Kerim managed to get of her.

161
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,208
Well, I don't know too much
about cryptography, sir,

162
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,961
but, a Lektor could decode
their top secret signals.

163
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,340
The whole thing's so fantastic
it just could be... true.

164
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,594
That had occurred to me.

165
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,640
Besides, the Russians haven't
been up to any tricks recently.

166
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,519
Well, really, I'm not
too busy at the moment, sir.

167
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,023
You're booked on the 8.30 plane
in the morning.

168
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,402
If there's any chance of getting a Lektor,
we must look into it.

169
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:23,325
Suppose when she meets me in the flesh
I don't come up to expectations?

170
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,244
Just see that you do.

171
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,959
Miss Moneypenny, ask
the equipment officer to come in, please.

172
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,462
Q Branch has put together
a smart-looking piece of luggage.

173
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,966
We're issuing this
to all double-0 personnel.

174
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,929
An ordinary black leather case

175
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:45,265
with 20 rounds of ammunition,
here and here.

176
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:52,691
If you take the top off,
you'll find the ammunition inside.

177
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:56,905
In the side here, flat throwing knife.

178
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,866
Press that button there,
and out she comes.

179
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:07,000
Inside the case,
you'll find an AR7 folding sniper's rifle.

180
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:11,338
.25 calibre,
with an infrared telescopic sight.

181
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,970
If you pull out these straps,
inside are 50 gold sovereigns.

182
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:20,140
25 in either side.

183
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,934
Now, watch very carefully.

184
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,270
An ordinary tin of talcum powder.

185
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:27,480
Inside, a tear-gas cartridge.

186
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:31,569
That goes in the case
against the side here, like that.

187
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:33,738
It's magnetised, so it won't fall.

188
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,740
Shut the case.

189
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:37,993
Normally, to open a case like that,

190
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,537
you move the catches to the side.

191
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:44,208
If you do, the cartridge will explode...
in your face.

192
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:46,837
To stop the cartridge exploding,

193
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:50,340
turn the catches horizontally.

194
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:54,345
Like that. Then... open normally.

195
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,681
Now you try it.

196
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:03,815
- Turn the catches... Iike that.
- That's right.

197
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,984
And open ordinarily.

198
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,488
- You got it?
- Yes, I think so.

199
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:12,909
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thanks very much.

200
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:15,412
That's a nasty little Christmas present.

201
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,330
But I shouldn't think
I'll need it on this assignment.

202
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:21,751
All the same, take it with you.
Good luck, 007.

203
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,920
Thank you, sir.

204
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,554
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.

205
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,183
And one plane ticket. Lucky man.
I've never been to lstanbul.

206
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:37,728
- You've never been to lstanbul?
- No.

207
00:23:37,854 --> 00:23:41,066
Where the moonlight on the Bosphorus
is irresistible?

208
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,112
Maybe I should get you
to take me there someday.

209
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:47,405
I've tried everything else.

210
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,327
Darling Moneypenny, you know
I never even look at another woman.

211
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:53,497
Oh, really, James?

212
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:57,126
Let me tell you
the secret of the world.

213
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:03,258
Miss Moneypenny,
ask 007 to leave the photograph.

214
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:07,054
I'm sure he'll recognise the lady
when he sees her.

215
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:23,614
Good luck.

216
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:41,969
Hello, London.
Your flight PA1 just landed lstanbul.

217
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:46,933
Mr Bond?

218
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:50,478
- Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.
- Fine.

219
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:53,522
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.

220
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:56,277
- It's better still.
- Until they go wrong.

221
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:59,487
- Exactly.
- I'll get the car, sir.

222
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:39,116
Kerim Bey suggested you see him
before going to the hotel.

223
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:42,455
- Would that be convenient?
- Fine.

224
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,348
I suppose it's customary
to have people tailing you in these parts.

225
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,729
Oh, yes, sir.
Today it's Citroen H 31854 on duty.

226
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,481
They're Bulgarians
working for the Russians.

227
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,111
They follow us, we follow them.
It's a sort of understanding we have.

228
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,113
That's very friendly.

229
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,727
My friend! Come in, come in!

230
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:17,520
Glad to see you. Welcome to lstanbul.

231
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:21,777
Well, thank you for sending the car.
But it does rather tie you in with me.

232
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,903
You're in the Balkans now, Mr Bond.

233
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:26,991
The game with the Russians
is played differently here.

234
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:30,953
For day-to-day routine matters, we make
it easy to keep a tab on each other.

235
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:33,498
So I gathered from your chauffeur.

236
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:35,667
He's a rather intelligent young man.

237
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:38,002
He should be. He's my son.

238
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:41,340
- Coffee?
- Medium sweet.

239
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:43,217
Two medium sweet.

240
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:45,762
He also is my son.

241
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,102
All of my key employees are my sons.
Blood is the best security in this business.

242
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:53,103
You must have quite an establishment.

243
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,315
Biggest family payroll in Turkey.

244
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,484
Not bad for a man who started life

245
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,404
breaking chains and bending bars
in a circus.

246
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,198
But let's talk about this business of yours.

247
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:05,452
Well, M thinks I'm wasting my time here.

248
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:08,998
And so do l.
This is an old friend of mine.

249
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:12,709
- And it tells me something smells.
- Maybe.

250
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:15,712
But if there's a chance
of getting a Lektor...

251
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:18,383
Now you tell me,
where can I contact this girl?

252
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:21,928
She said she would make her own
arrangements. You'll have to wait.

253
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,352
Thank you.

254
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:30,271
My friend, if you really want my advice,

255
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:35,445
you should spend a few pleasant days
with us here in lstanbul, and then...

256
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,155
then go home.

257
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:09,774
- James Bond, I have a reservation.
- Mr Bond, your room is ready.

258
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,027
Number 32.

259
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:16,241
- 32 for Mr Bond.
- Hope you enjoy your stay.

260
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,242
Thank you.

261
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,480
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Only this.

262
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:46,441
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

263
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,321
- Mr Bond here.
- Yes?

264
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,491
- The room won't do.
- I'm sorry.

265
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:06,991
The bed's too small.

266
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,285
One moment, sir.

267
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:09,828
Did you hear that?

268
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:13,709
Tell him that's all there is.
Unless he would like the bridal suite.

269
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:18,046
I'm sorry, sir. That's all we have available.
Except the bridal suite.

270
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,799
Well, let's have a look at it. I may like it.

271
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:26,849
The porter will show it to you.
He will be up immediately.

272
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:28,892
Good.

273
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:09,106
Good work. Who can the Russians
suspect but the British?

274
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:13,693
The Cold War in lstanbul
will not remain cold very much longer.

275
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:39,389
Ali Kerim Bey.

276
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:51,321
Ali Kerim Bey.

277
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,241
Ali Kerim Bey...

278
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,304
You are not glad to see me
this morning, chéri?

279
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,431
Overjoyed.

280
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:21,645
I...

281
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,816
I no longer please you?

282
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,195
Be still!

283
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,411
Back to the salt mines.

284
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,941
Careful with those papers.

285
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,321
Well, who won?

286
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:06,363
I had visitors.

287
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:09,159
Limpet mine on the wall outside.

288
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:11,328
Timed to catch me at my desk.

289
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:15,332
But, by good fortune, I was relaxing
on the settee for a few moments.

290
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:19,628
- The girl left in hysterics.
- Found your technique too violent?

291
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:22,842
I cannot understand
this sudden breach of the truce.

292
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:25,970
It's unlike the Russians
to break the peace this way.

293
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:29,892
Most inconsiderate. I think my visit
might have something to do with it.

294
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:32,102
Let's try and find out.

295
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:42,446
Close up afterwards.

296
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:48,371
Quite a place you've got here.

297
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:52,249
The Emperor Constantine built it
as a reservoir... 1 ,600 years ago.

298
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:53,877
Really?

299
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,671
Here.

300
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,581
My daily exercise.

301
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:30,586
At eleven in the morning
and three in the afternoon.

302
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:33,881
Tie her up, will you?

303
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,144
Mind your head now.

304
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,197
Underneath the Russian Consulate.

305
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,951
A present from your navy.

306
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:06,460
Our friends were evicted while the Public
Works Ministry conducted a survey.

307
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:09,672
The story was that
the traffic shook the foundations.

308
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:13,133
By the time the place was declared safe,
I had this installed.

309
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,970
I can see everything
M said about you is right.

310
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:18,682
Or why I stay in this mad business?

311
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,518
It could be that you find
selling rugs a bore.

312
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:24,855
My friend, you should be a mind-reader.

313
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:29,110
Head of the table is General Vassili.
Director of Military lntelligence.

314
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:33,658
On his left, Koslovski. Chief of Security.

315
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,660
Opposite him, Benz. One of his agents.

316
00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:40,958
I can't see the face of the other man.

317
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:44,127
The one the general is shouting at.

318
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,927
He's giving him a hell of a blowing up.

319
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:53,847
It's too bad
we can't hear as well as see.

320
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:57,934
Tell me, does our girl Romanova
ever come to this room?

321
00:36:58,103 --> 00:36:59,896
Sometimes, with messages.

322
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:03,275
I can see the face of the other man now.

323
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,278
Krilencu!

324
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:08,446
So he's back.

325
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:11,660
Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.

326
00:37:12,702 --> 00:37:15,205
Just the man for the limpet mine job.

327
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,792
I've had trouble with him before.

328
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:22,755
But he's stayed out of lstanbul
for over a year now.

329
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:26,133
Take a look. You should remember him.

330
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,012
This man kills for pleasure.

331
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,768
Nice face.

332
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,769
Just a moment. A girl's just come in.

333
00:37:35,938 --> 00:37:38,940
Probably Romanova.
She's the only one who's allowed to.

334
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:40,692
How does she look to you?

335
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,200
Well, from this angle,

336
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:49,745
things are shaping up nicely.

337
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,879
I'd like to see her in the flesh.

338
00:37:58,046 --> 00:37:59,422
Yes.

339
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:03,468
- Could you get me a plan of that place?
- I wish I could.

340
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:06,430
The original drawing
must be registered somewhere.

341
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:08,475
I'll get onto that.

342
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:14,816
Now, I need a little time
to deal with this stinking Krilencu.

343
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:18,819
It will be better if you didn't stay
at the hotel tonight. Come!

344
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,417
I see now why you keep the Rolls.

345
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,254
One of my sons is driving it.
With two dummies in the back.

346
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,175
In the opposite direction.
They'll follow it for hours.

347
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:41,178
You'll like my Gypsy friends.

348
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:43,848
I use them like
the Russians use the Bulgars.

349
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:46,268
It's created a blood feud between them.

350
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,875
Hello, Krilencu?

351
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,482
We've come on the wrong night.

352
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:30,360
Two girls who love the same man
want to kill each other.

353
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,278
It must be settled the Gypsy way.

354
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:35,033
As I'm a family friend,
we'll be allowed to stay.

355
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:41,123
We're bidden to table.
I hope you can eat with your fingers.

356
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:42,289
Kerim Bey!

357
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:52,885
Raki! Filthy stuff!

358
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:11,518
Quick!

359
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,052
Tell our host
his hospitality overwhelms me.

360
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,350
Thank you, thank you!

361
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:46,542
No matter what happens now,
say and do nothing.

362
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:54,844
He's asking whether they will cease
their blood feud and give up this fight.

363
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:58,305
The tribe elders will decide
who will marry the chief's son.

364
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:06,857
- She's saying...
- Yes, I think I got it without the subtitles!

365
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:54,132
Thank you!

366
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:39,684
- Did you get Krilencu?
- No.

367
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:42,646
Just a minute. Here! Thank you.

368
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,610
You fought well.
I am nothing but a clumsy old man.

369
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:50,990
They're making one
of the wounded Bulgars talk.

370
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:56,370
It was me they were after.

371
00:46:56,495 --> 00:46:58,998
Why would they want me out of the way?

372
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:03,336
Tomorrow we will have to find
Krilencu's hide-out.

373
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:06,297
Meantime, I'll take care of this filthy stuff.

374
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:17,061
Vavra thanks you for saving his life.
You are now his son.

375
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,859
Thank you. I'd like to ask him a favour.
Could he stop the girl fight?

376
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:33,997
He says your heart is too soft
to be a real Gypsy.

377
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:36,248
But he lets you decide the matter.

378
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:40,086
As if I didn't have enough problems.

379
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,106
Vavra said for you to decide.

380
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,859
So decide! They're both yours!

381
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,410
This might take some time.

382
00:48:40,822 --> 00:48:43,242
Did you pick up that package at the hotel?

383
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:45,412
It's on the seat.

384
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:47,497
Thank you.

385
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:04,434
Twice that Krilencu has tried to kill me.

386
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:09,271
The third time he will succeed.
Unless I get him first.

387
00:49:09,397 --> 00:49:13,027
- And that I'll do tonight.
- Not with that arm you won't.

388
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,362
You'd better leave it to me.

389
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:17,824
I'm already too much in your debt.

390
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:20,369
How can a friend be in debt?

391
00:49:29,086 --> 00:49:30,880
Here.

392
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:36,428
Infrared lens.

393
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,554
My sons.

394
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:17,391
They will ring his doorbell.
He has a private escape hatch.

395
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,608
Try this for size.

396
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:30,615
- Do you notice anything?
- Not yet.

397
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,493
She has a lovely mouth, that Anita.

398
00:50:33,618 --> 00:50:35,496
Yes. I see what you mean.

399
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,420
Arm or no arm, I have to pull that trigger.

400
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:44,923
If you think you can.

401
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:47,091
You've got one shot, remember.

402
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:49,262
It'll have to do.

403
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:01,817
Quick, he's coming.

404
00:51:12,163 --> 00:51:13,164
Quick!

405
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:27,221
That pays many debts.

406
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:30,183
She should have kept her mouth shut.

407
00:52:04,347 --> 00:52:05,765
Hello?

408
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:09,020
Breakfast for one at nine please.

409
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:13,776
Green figs, yoghurt, coffee, very black.

410
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:15,277
Thank you.

411
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:31,613
You look surprised.

412
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:34,576
I thought you were expecting me.

413
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:37,913
So you are Tatiana Romanova?

414
00:53:38,037 --> 00:53:40,707
My friends call me Tania.

415
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:42,877
Mine call me James Bond.

416
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,718
Well, now that we've been
properly introduced...

417
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:51,636
Careful! Guns upset me.

418
00:53:53,056 --> 00:53:56,600
I'm sorry. I'm a bit upset myself.

419
00:53:57,269 --> 00:54:01,064
You look just like your... your photograph.

420
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,608
You're one of the most
beautiful girls I've seen.

421
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:06,987
Thank you, but I think
my mouth is too big.

422
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:09,365
No, it's the right size.

423
00:54:11,492 --> 00:54:13,286
For me, that is.

424
00:54:16,749 --> 00:54:18,459
Yes.

425
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:20,212
Is it here?

426
00:54:20,336 --> 00:54:22,630
What?

427
00:54:22,756 --> 00:54:25,717
The decoding machine, Lektor.

428
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,345
Must we talk about it now?

429
00:54:31,474 --> 00:54:33,601
Or is it at the Russian Consulate?

430
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,273
Yes.

431
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,737
Yes... I would need a plan of the place.

432
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:47,200
If you could get one, we could meet
at the Saint Sophia mosque.

433
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,079
- Like we were tourists.
- Why don't you ask me that

434
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,333
Iater?

435
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:57,504
Now what are you looking for?

436
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,715
The scar.
You see, I know all about you

437
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,593
from your file.

438
00:55:02,718 --> 00:55:07,264
You do? Well, I hope
you're not... disappointed.

439
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:10,643
I will tell you

440
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,315
in the morning.

441
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:06,957
We are now approaching the most
interesting corner of Saint Sophia.

442
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:09,543
Including these two great

443
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,924
red porphyry columns,
stolen and brought from Egypt.

444
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:15,884
In front of them,

445
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:20,557
alabaster urn
was brought from Bergama,

446
00:56:20,683 --> 00:56:24,978
a famous historical city near Smyrna.

447
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:29,942
Dates back
from the Alexander the Great period.

448
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:35,241
About 1648, Sultan Murad IV

449
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:38,535
brought it from Bergama.

450
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:42,457
It was used as an ablution fountain.

451
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:47,587
It contains a thousand litres of water.

452
00:56:47,714 --> 00:56:51,176
Right after the ablution fountain,

453
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:57,056
we are going to a highly
interesting column over there,

454
00:56:57,182 --> 00:57:02,355
known for centuries
as the Saint Sophia

455
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:04,399
wishing column.

456
00:57:04,524 --> 00:57:06,318
Tens of thousands

457
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:08,778
of people have wished here

458
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:13,118
putting their right hand

459
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:18,833
and middle finger in the hole...

460
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:35,212
I promise you,
it wasn't one of my men who killed him.

461
00:58:35,336 --> 00:58:37,506
He didn't die of old age.

462
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:40,258
All I know is that it saved me the job.

463
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:44,138
Once he'd seen the girl, she was
obviously compromised, and so...

464
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:46,891
And he wasn't killed because of that.

465
00:58:48,018 --> 00:58:51,479
Let's just say that lstanbul's a rough town.

466
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:56,151
Let's see how Tania's map
compares with your architect's plans.

467
00:58:56,278 --> 00:58:59,155
This is the conference room
of the Russian Consulate.

468
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:01,241
Yes, that checks.

469
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:04,870
And this here is the communication room.
That's the same.

470
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:08,373
She says she works there with the Lektor
between two and three.

471
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,501
How is she gonna get the machine to us?

472
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:13,922
She's leaving that to me.
She'll do anything I say.

473
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:16,716
Anything! My dear James...

474
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:18,761
You're not using this.

475
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:23,015
It all sounds too easy. We don't
even know if she's telling the truth.

476
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:27,271
- Well, I intend to find out.
- Where? ln the hotel?

477
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:30,273
She won't go there again.
Says it's too dangerous.

478
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,863
The old game.
Give a wolf a taste, then keep him hungry.

479
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:37,742
My friend, she's got you dangling.

480
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:40,451
That doesn't matter.

481
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:43,790
- All I want is that Lektor.
- All?

482
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,167
Are you sure that's all you want?

483
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:48,670
Well...

484
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:34,598
Lovely view.

485
01:00:34,722 --> 01:00:37,851
James, we must leave here now.

486
01:00:37,977 --> 01:00:40,229
If that agent reports my meeting you...

487
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:43,775
- Don't worry. He won't.
- But you don't understand the danger!

488
01:00:45,777 --> 01:00:47,655
James, look up!

489
01:00:47,779 --> 01:00:49,949
Smile.

490
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:55,329
Another one. Further back.

491
01:01:02,212 --> 01:01:03,798
About the machine...

492
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:07,177
That's all you are interested in. Not me.

493
01:01:07,301 --> 01:01:09,179
Business first.

494
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:11,808
I know, once you have got
what you want...

495
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:15,352
I haven't got it yet.
But if you tell me about the machine,

496
01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:18,440
we won't always be
working on the company's time.

497
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:22,820
All right. What do you want to know?

498
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,449
Talk into this.

499
01:01:26,573 --> 01:01:30,078
Answer my questions quietly, but clearly.

500
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,416
How large is the machine?

501
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:38,964
Like... Iike a typewriter.

502
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:40,841
Weight?

503
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:44,970
About ten kilos. In a brown case.

504
01:01:45,095 --> 01:01:46,555
Brown like your eyes.

505
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,014
Keep it technical.

506
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,893
Self-calibrating or manual?

507
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:56,942
Both, with an in-built compensator.
James,

508
01:01:57,066 --> 01:01:59,279
- couldn't we...
- Not now.

509
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:02,322
Talk into the camera.

510
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:05,786
- How many keys?
- Symbol or code keys?

511
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,204
Both.

512
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:10,624
There are 24 symbols, 16 code keys.

513
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,754
It is inserted in a slot and the message
comes out in a paper roll

514
01:02:14,879 --> 01:02:18,508
from another slot on the other side.
The mechanism is...

515
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:22,637
Oh, James, James, will you make love
to me all the time in England?

516
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:25,474
Day and night.
Go on about the mechanism.

517
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,810
Oh, yes, the mechanism.

518
01:02:27,936 --> 01:02:31,607
Once, when it was being repaired,
I saw the insides.

519
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:35,443
There were many perforated discs,
made, I think, ofcopper,

520
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:37,614
with a small light...

521
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:39,783
Dushka, tell me the truth.

522
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:42,328
Am I as exciting
as all those Western girls?

523
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:46,623
Once, when I was with M in Tokyo,
we had an interesting experience.

524
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,585
Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.

525
01:02:55,134 --> 01:02:56,719
Later, later.

526
01:02:56,843 --> 01:02:59,263
Those copper discs and the light...

527
01:02:59,387 --> 01:03:03,351
Oh, the light, the light.
James, come closer.

528
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:05,312
I want to whisper something.

529
01:03:05,436 --> 01:03:07,690
Go on.
No, not that, the mechanism!

530
01:03:07,814 --> 01:03:10,735
Miss Moneypenny,
as you're no doubt listening,

531
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:13,779
perhaps you'd take this cable?
Text reads,

532
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:19,452
"Merchandise appears genuine, stop.
Go ahead with deal. Signed, M."

533
01:03:20,412 --> 01:03:23,457
Now all I have to do
is to tell the girl the date.

534
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:28,005
- The 1 3th?
- The 14th.

535
01:03:43,355 --> 01:03:45,107
Visas?

536
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:47,067
Visas?

537
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:49,822
- Tam.
- Thank you.

538
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:00,250
Visa, please.

539
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:03,335
Your clock, is it correct?

540
01:04:03,462 --> 01:04:06,340
- Always.
- Of course.

541
01:04:07,842 --> 01:04:10,552
Gregori!

542
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:25,821
Excuse me!
You did say your clock was correct?

543
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,657
Russian clocks are always...

544
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,196
- Is this the Lektor?
- Yes.

545
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:06,325
Take this. It's only tear gas.

546
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:09,203
I thought it was for tomorrow,
but today is the 1 3th.

547
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:12,415
This is a hell of a time to be superstitious.
Come on.

548
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,843
Come on, quickly.

549
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:43,367
Keep your head down.

550
01:05:49,374 --> 01:05:50,793
Back inside.

551
01:05:56,049 --> 01:05:58,217
This way, quickly!

552
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,429
Quickly, quickly!

553
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,913
- What's the matter?
- Benz. The Russian security man.

554
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,667
Come on, never mind.

555
01:07:03,793 --> 01:07:05,294
Hurry!

556
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,922
Hurry!

557
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:32,075
Here's one of them.
And there's the other one.

558
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,968
Your passports.
The pictures do not do you justice.

559
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:50,638
I have rarely seen a handsomer couple.

560
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:52,849
Mr and Mrs David Somerset.

561
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:55,018
Your name's Caroline.

562
01:07:55,144 --> 01:07:57,521
Caroline! I like that name.

563
01:07:57,646 --> 01:08:00,857
We've been on a business trip.
On the way back to Derbyshire.

564
01:08:00,984 --> 01:08:03,110
- To our children?
- No children.

565
01:08:03,237 --> 01:08:05,988
- Not even one little boy?
- Nyet.

566
01:08:06,114 --> 01:08:08,366
I like big families.

567
01:08:08,493 --> 01:08:11,579
My whole life has been
a crusade for larger families.

568
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:12,997
So I heard.

569
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,458
- Tania!
- Yes?

570
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:16,793
Lock the door. I'll knock three times.

571
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:22,466
- I'll go see the conductor.
- Will he cooperate?

572
01:08:22,592 --> 01:08:24,635
We've done business before.

573
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,973
He'll stop the train near the frontier,
where my sons will be waiting with a car.

574
01:08:29,099 --> 01:08:31,309
We'll be there... about six o'clock.

575
01:08:31,436 --> 01:08:34,522
- And the airstrip?
- 20 miles.

576
01:08:43,573 --> 01:08:46,994
The plane is chartered to Athens.
You'll be in London tomorrow.

577
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,163
We'll drink to that in London.

578
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:58,799
We are really on our way to England.

579
01:08:58,924 --> 01:09:01,760
Yes. With a lovely
two-day honeymoon before us.

580
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,055
Honeymoon? And I've nothing to wear!

581
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,560
- Your trousseau.
- Oh, James!

582
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,729
One moment.

583
01:09:19,616 --> 01:09:22,159
Oh, no!

584
01:09:22,285 --> 01:09:24,412
James! James!

585
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:27,791
Oh, look! Look!

586
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,014
There!

587
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:51,277
I will wear this one... in Piccadilly.

588
01:09:51,401 --> 01:09:55,531
You won't.
They've just passed some new laws there.

589
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:14,636
- You're nearest.
- Oh, all right.

590
01:10:19,475 --> 01:10:20,643
Charming!

591
01:10:21,519 --> 01:10:23,313
Charming!

592
01:10:23,437 --> 01:10:26,232
Let's go to the restaurant car
for... that drink.

593
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,236
Surely.

594
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,279
Charming!

595
01:10:31,322 --> 01:10:33,866
We'll continue the fashion show later.

596
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,996
It's all arranged for me to stop the train.

597
01:10:39,123 --> 01:10:41,666
We'll get off at the restaurant car.
At that end.

598
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,837
Fine. We'll meet you there at six.

599
01:10:43,961 --> 01:10:47,215
Make it a little later.
There are slight complications.

600
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:52,137
One of the Russian security men - Benz.
He watches the stations. He's on the train.

601
01:10:52,263 --> 01:10:54,724
But he couldn't have contacted
the consulate.

602
01:10:54,849 --> 01:10:58,394
Just in case, I'll keep him company
until it's time to get off.

603
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,730
Perhaps you'd like me to introduce you.

604
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:02,691
Charming.

605
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,033
Ticket control.

606
01:11:27,594 --> 01:11:31,808
Do not be alarmed, my friend. We will
make you as comfortable as possible.

607
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:37,690
Now I'm sure Commissar Benz
will have a much safer journey.

608
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:40,609
I'm not mad about his tailor, are you?

609
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:44,448
James, life in lstanbul will
never be the same without you.

610
01:11:44,572 --> 01:11:47,076
See you in the restaurant car.

611
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,955
I've had a particularly fascinating life.

612
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,833
Would you like to hear about it?

613
01:11:53,957 --> 01:11:55,877
You would?

614
01:12:20,697 --> 01:12:24,660
- You like it?
- Yes. It does rather suit you.

615
01:12:24,784 --> 01:12:27,412
I will save everything else for England.

616
01:12:27,538 --> 01:12:29,957
It is four o'clock, you know.

617
01:12:30,082 --> 01:12:33,337
This is not kulturny in the afternoon?

618
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:35,338
Even on a honeymoon?

619
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:38,634
Then I will... take it off.

620
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,640
I think we're talking
at cross purposes again.

621
01:12:47,894 --> 01:12:49,564
Tania...

622
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:54,443
We'd better get dressed now.

623
01:12:54,568 --> 01:12:57,364
- Why?
- It's almost six.

624
01:12:58,407 --> 01:12:59,866
So?

625
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:03,580
Well, it's... it's teatime!

626
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:06,499
We'll have it in here.

627
01:13:06,624 --> 01:13:11,589
- We'll have all our meals here.
- Yes, that would be splendid.

628
01:13:12,297 --> 01:13:15,760
But I've arranged to meet Kerim
in the restaurant car.

629
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:19,973
You go alone. I will stay here.

630
01:13:20,098 --> 01:13:24,646
My dear Mrs Somerset, we're supposed
to be a respectable English couple.

631
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,691
They would certainly have tea
in the restaurant.

632
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:31,152
Now, listen...

633
01:13:31,278 --> 01:13:32,947
Just do as I say, will you?

634
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,991
Yes, James.

635
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:39,037
But there are some English customs

636
01:13:39,163 --> 01:13:42,707
- that are going to be changed.
- But of course, darling.

637
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:05,984
Do I look right, Mr Somerset?

638
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:08,988
Yes...

639
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:17,122
Mrs Somerset.

640
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:30,721
Mr Somerset!

641
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:35,100
- You're the friend of Kerim Bey?
- Yes.

642
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:39,397
There's been a terrible accident.
Please come with me.

643
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,236
- No tea?
- Later. Keep the door locked.

644
01:15:00,838 --> 01:15:03,050
They killed each other.

645
01:15:11,183 --> 01:15:14,021
This must be kept quiet
until we reach Trieste.

646
01:15:14,186 --> 01:15:16,190
It will be difficult.

647
01:15:16,356 --> 01:15:18,276
I'm sure.

648
01:15:19,067 --> 01:15:22,530
Kerim Bey was a very important man.
With many influential friends.

649
01:15:22,697 --> 01:15:25,283
I'm sure they also will reward you.

650
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:28,121
I will try.

651
01:16:29,481 --> 01:16:30,441
What is it?

652
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:34,654
- Kerim's dead.
- Dead?

653
01:16:37,866 --> 01:16:40,036
I want the truth.

654
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:44,915
- James, you are hurting me!
- I'll do worse if you don't tell me!

655
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,170
You're doing this under orders, I know.
What are they?

656
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:51,172
- I don't know what you mean.
- Liar!

657
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:58,348
Even if you kill me, I can say nothing.

658
01:16:58,515 --> 01:17:02,727
I did not know anything
like Kerim's death would happen.

659
01:17:02,853 --> 01:17:05,607
But, when we get to England, I tell you.

660
01:17:05,732 --> 01:17:06,899
Go on.

661
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:14,741
Maybe they didn't let you in on all of it,
but, whatever you do know, tell me.

662
01:17:14,909 --> 01:17:19,289
- I know I love you, James. I love you.
- Just tell me.

663
01:17:19,455 --> 01:17:21,958
I love you, I love you, it's true.

664
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:26,212
Sure.

665
01:17:51,034 --> 01:17:54,245
Beograd! Beograd!

666
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:29,911
Excuse me!

667
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:33,207
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.

668
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:36,126
- Better still.
- Until they go wrong.

669
01:18:39,714 --> 01:18:43,677
My brother telephoned me.
Why did the train not stop?

670
01:18:43,843 --> 01:18:46,848
Well, l... I have some bad news.

671
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,435
Your father's dead.

672
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,062
Who did it? Tell me.

673
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,815
He took care of that himself.
The other man died first.

674
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:58,068
Now, listen...

675
01:18:58,236 --> 01:19:02,532
I'll need help to get across the frontier
strip between Yugoslavia and Trieste.

676
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:04,784
I want you to send
a message to M in London.

677
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:08,496
Tell him to send someone
from Station Y to meet me in Zagreb.

678
01:19:08,664 --> 01:19:10,957
I will.

679
01:19:11,124 --> 01:19:13,127
Good.

680
01:19:16,172 --> 01:19:18,758
You'll... I think you'll want these.

681
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:24,056
- Mr Somerset, le train part.
- Thank you.

682
01:19:24,224 --> 01:19:26,100
- Ciao.
- The train is leaving!

683
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:13,458
- Nash, Captain Nash.
- Bond, travelling as Somerset.

684
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,627
My card.

685
01:22:16,922 --> 01:22:18,590
What kept you?

686
01:22:18,714 --> 01:22:21,425
I'm so sorry,
I only got M's wire an hour ago.

687
01:22:21,551 --> 01:22:23,929
I busted every record getting here.

688
01:22:27,267 --> 01:22:28,600
What were M's orders?

689
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:31,980
Only to contact you
and the lady on the train.

690
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:35,109
Good. Come this way.

691
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:39,195
Thank you.

692
01:22:46,037 --> 01:22:48,082
This is my wife Caroline. Captain Nash.

693
01:22:48,207 --> 01:22:50,251
How do you do? So pleased to meet you.

694
01:22:50,377 --> 01:22:51,543
This way, Nash.

695
01:22:51,668 --> 01:22:53,421
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

696
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,890
- Been long in Yugoslavia?
- About three years.

697
01:23:03,014 --> 01:23:06,436
- Interesting work?
- Yes. Sometimes.

698
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:08,688
You know how it is, old man.

699
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:10,982
You look very fit, Nash.

700
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:13,778
Yes. I try to keep in shape.

701
01:23:15,947 --> 01:23:17,991
So what's our problem, sir?

702
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:22,120
I can't risk taking this
through the customs

703
01:23:22,245 --> 01:23:24,832
at the Yugoslav-Trieste border.

704
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:27,794
No stops till then. We'll have to jump off.

705
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:29,922
Can you get us across?

706
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:31,882
Any of the opposition around?

707
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,261
Not in any condition to worry about.

708
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,429
Good. We'll make it.

709
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,767
I know this territory
like the back of my hand.

710
01:23:42,895 --> 01:23:46,814
Do you mind if we have a bite to eat?
I've been on the go since breakfast.

711
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,484
Of course not.
We'll go to the restaurant car.

712
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,697
Go with Nash to the restaurant car.

713
01:23:51,822 --> 01:23:53,823
I'll join you there in a few minutes.

714
01:23:53,949 --> 01:23:55,951
Whatever you say, old man.

715
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:57,996
Excuse me.

716
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:33,743
Excuse me.

717
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:41,253
There you are, old man.

718
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:44,423
I was worried
something had happened to you.

719
01:24:50,513 --> 01:24:52,391
- Voilà, monsieur.
- Thank you.

720
01:24:53,015 --> 01:24:54,559
Thank you.

721
01:24:54,726 --> 01:24:56,728
I'll have the grilled sole.

722
01:24:59,065 --> 01:25:01,109
And for madam. What about you, Nash?

723
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:05,782
Yes, that sounds very nice.
Make that three of those, will you?

724
01:25:05,948 --> 01:25:08,534
- Oui, monsieur.
- And a bottle of the blanc de blancs.

725
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,120
- Make mine chianti.
- White chianti, monsieur?

726
01:25:11,286 --> 01:25:13,456
No, the red kind.

727
01:25:14,082 --> 01:25:18,462
Well, enjoy your dinner, old man. I think
I've got the answer to our problems.

728
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:20,923
- Very simple, really.
- Good.

729
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,598
We should reach the border
in about an hour.

730
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,559
I'm

731
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:34,896
terribly sorry, Mrs Somerset.
That was clumsy of me.

732
01:25:36,357 --> 01:25:38,235
- Waiter!
- Monsieur!

733
01:25:40,153 --> 01:25:41,280
Waiter!

734
01:25:41,447 --> 01:25:43,449
Tout de suite, monsieur!

735
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:52,083
Excuse me. Merci.

736
01:25:52,251 --> 01:25:56,047
You'll... you'll find Trieste
quite interesting.

737
01:25:56,213 --> 01:25:58,257
Of course, it's not London.

738
01:26:00,093 --> 01:26:01,301
Cheerio.

739
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:04,265
Cheerio.

740
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:20,157
I don't feel very well.

741
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:23,410
My head...

742
01:26:23,537 --> 01:26:25,539
The lady's come over faint.

743
01:26:25,706 --> 01:26:28,041
- Bring her in here.
- May l?

744
01:26:35,675 --> 01:26:38,804
- Let's go next door.
- Exhaustion, I'd say.

745
01:26:48,106 --> 01:26:51,610
What was it,
the stuff you put in her drink?

746
01:26:51,736 --> 01:26:54,028
Chloral hydrate. Quick, but mild.

747
01:26:54,154 --> 01:26:57,283
- And?
- Take it easy, 007.

748
01:26:59,827 --> 01:27:02,789
My escape route's only for one.

749
01:27:02,914 --> 01:27:05,458
What are you after?
The girl or the Lektor?

750
01:27:11,008 --> 01:27:12,676
All right.

751
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:14,720
What is your plan?

752
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:19,475
- Explain it better on a map. All right?
- Sure.

753
01:27:23,021 --> 01:27:26,067
Now, we're here, you see?

754
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:31,614
When we reach there, there's a steep
gradient, the train slows down there.

755
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:36,202
We'll block the line, make for
that main road, pick up a car... there.

756
01:27:36,327 --> 01:27:38,163
A truck, in fact.

757
01:27:38,288 --> 01:27:40,833
That must be about 20 miles from here...

758
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:30,265
Keep still.

759
01:28:33,393 --> 01:28:35,939
All right, now get up on your knees.

760
01:28:41,111 --> 01:28:44,990
Put your hands in your pockets.
Keep them there.

761
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:50,328
Red wine with fish.
That should have told me something.

762
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:53,374
You may know the right wines

763
01:28:53,499 --> 01:28:55,711
but you're the one on your knees.

764
01:28:55,836 --> 01:28:57,880
How does it feel, old man?

765
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:03,636
Old man? ls that what you chaps
in SMERSH call each other?

766
01:29:03,762 --> 01:29:05,806
SMERSH?

767
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:14,524
Of course. SPECTRE.

768
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:18,569
Then it wasn't a Russian show at all.

769
01:29:18,696 --> 01:29:22,408
You've been playing us off
against each other, haven't you?

770
01:29:23,868 --> 01:29:27,664
Then it was SPECTRE who killed
the Russian agent in the mosque.

771
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,541
You?

772
01:29:33,169 --> 01:29:35,213
Kerim and the other man?

773
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:37,633
And Nash?

774
01:29:37,758 --> 01:29:40,178
I don't mind talking.

775
01:29:40,302 --> 01:29:43,140
I get a kick out of watching
the great James Bond

776
01:29:43,265 --> 01:29:46,685
find out what a bloody fool
he's been making of himself.

777
01:29:46,811 --> 01:29:48,771
We're pros, Mr Bond.

778
01:29:48,897 --> 01:29:53,068
We sweated your recognition code
out of one of your men in Tokyo

779
01:29:53,194 --> 01:29:56,529
before he died.
I've been keeping tabs on you.

780
01:29:56,655 --> 01:29:59,241
I've been your guardian angel.

781
01:29:59,367 --> 01:30:01,578
Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.

782
01:30:02,662 --> 01:30:04,413
Oh, yes.

783
01:30:05,165 --> 01:30:07,210
I'm much obliged.

784
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,171
We were keeping you alive
until you could get us the Lektor.

785
01:30:12,048 --> 01:30:15,843
So you had me deliver it on a plate.
That's brilliant.

786
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:18,847
Go on. I'm fascinated.

787
01:30:18,971 --> 01:30:22,310
Now that we've got it,
you and the girl are expendable.

788
01:30:22,435 --> 01:30:24,479
Between here and Trieste.

789
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:29,735
Girl?

790
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:31,903
Isn't she working for SPECTRE, too?

791
01:30:32,028 --> 01:30:34,114
No.

792
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,118
She thinks she's doing it all
for Mother Russia.

793
01:30:37,243 --> 01:30:39,705
She takes her orders
from Colonel Klebb.

794
01:30:41,123 --> 01:30:44,919
Rosa Klebb's Russian.
Head of operations for SMERSH.

795
01:30:45,043 --> 01:30:47,004
Was.

796
01:30:47,129 --> 01:30:49,173
Klebb works for SPECTRE now.

797
01:30:49,298 --> 01:30:51,217
The girl doesn't know that.

798
01:30:53,096 --> 01:30:55,139
Well, why kill her?

799
01:30:55,848 --> 01:30:57,599
Orders.

800
01:30:59,519 --> 01:31:01,563
That's only half of it, old man.

801
01:31:03,148 --> 01:31:05,400
Here's a roll of film.

802
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,485
She'll have this in her handbag.

803
01:31:07,612 --> 01:31:10,448
And on you... they'll find this letter.

804
01:31:10,573 --> 01:31:14,453
It's from her,
threatening to give the film to the press

805
01:31:14,578 --> 01:31:17,455
unless you marry her
for helping you get the Lektor.

806
01:31:17,582 --> 01:31:19,582
What film?

807
01:31:20,918 --> 01:31:23,671
Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.

808
01:31:24,755 --> 01:31:27,300
Something else the girl didn't know about.

809
01:31:27,426 --> 01:31:29,469
Or you.

810
01:31:30,428 --> 01:31:34,893
You must be a pretty sick collection
of minds to dream up a plan like that.

811
01:31:35,017 --> 01:31:37,061
Can't you see the headlines?

812
01:31:37,186 --> 01:31:40,857
"British agent murders beautiful
Russian spy, then commits suicide."

813
01:31:42,068 --> 01:31:45,487
Tell me, which lunatic asylum
did they get you out of?

814
01:31:46,823 --> 01:31:50,077
Don't make it tougher on yourself!

815
01:31:53,413 --> 01:31:56,835
My orders are to kill you
and deliver the Lektor.

816
01:31:56,959 --> 01:31:59,211
How I do it is my business.

817
01:31:59,337 --> 01:32:01,172
It'll be slow and painful.

818
01:32:01,297 --> 01:32:03,634
How much are they paying you?

819
01:32:03,758 --> 01:32:05,595
What's it to you?

820
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,181
We'll double it.

821
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:11,226
Your word of honour?

822
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,186
As an English gentleman?

823
01:32:20,737 --> 01:32:23,197
The first one won't kill you.

824
01:32:23,323 --> 01:32:25,368
Not the second.

825
01:32:25,492 --> 01:32:27,536
Not even the third.

826
01:32:29,246 --> 01:32:32,709
Not till you crawl over here
and you kiss my foot.

827
01:32:36,003 --> 01:32:38,007
How about a cigarette?

828
01:32:38,131 --> 01:32:40,009
Not a chance.

829
01:32:42,178 --> 01:32:44,012
I'll pay for it.

830
01:32:44,139 --> 01:32:46,308
What with?

831
01:32:46,432 --> 01:32:48,811
50 gold sovereigns.

832
01:32:48,936 --> 01:32:52,607
- Where are they?
- Up there, in my case.

833
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,828
You show me.

834
01:33:13,422 --> 01:33:15,967
Here you are. What about that cigarette?

835
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,844
Throw 'em down there.

836
01:33:21,556 --> 01:33:23,599
Any more in the other case?

837
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:33,654
I should imagine so. It's standard kit.
I'll have a look.

838
01:33:33,779 --> 01:33:35,322
Hands back in your pockets!

839
01:33:41,411 --> 01:33:43,582
Keep them there.

840
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:12,669
You won't be needing this,

841
01:36:13,586 --> 01:36:15,630
old man.

842
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,358
Tania! Wake up!

843
01:36:33,483 --> 01:36:36,196
Wake up, or I'll leave you behind.

844
01:36:36,321 --> 01:36:37,155
Tania,

845
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,992
wake up or I'll leave you behind,
do you hear me?

846
01:36:40,116 --> 01:36:42,912
Don't leave me. Never leave me.

847
01:36:49,043 --> 01:36:53,341
Tania! This is Nash's escape route.
You understand?

848
01:36:53,466 --> 01:36:57,427
We've got to get off here. Take this.

849
01:36:57,554 --> 01:36:59,097
Come on.

850
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:06,146
We must get
to the other side of the train.

851
01:37:06,271 --> 01:37:07,814
Under here.

852
01:37:54,995 --> 01:37:57,329
Grant! Where are you?

853
01:37:58,289 --> 01:37:59,624
Grant!

854
01:38:07,926 --> 01:38:09,011
Excuse me.

855
01:38:38,711 --> 01:38:40,755
Now don't run away.

856
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,008
Come on!

857
01:38:43,132 --> 01:38:46,886
- Come on, or I'll leave you here!
- Stay here with me.

858
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:57,773
Sleep it off in there.

859
01:38:57,899 --> 01:39:00,986
You'll feel better in the morning.

860
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:05,574
Come on, wake up.

861
01:40:06,101 --> 01:40:08,647
Try and straddle the truck.

862
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,998
I'll get them away from here.

863
01:40:24,123 --> 01:40:25,916
You hide under the truck.

864
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:49,513
Quick!

865
01:42:23,717 --> 01:42:26,514
I'd say one of their aircraft is missing.

866
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,030
Tania!

867
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:46,578
- Here, take this, and cast the rope off.
- All right.

868
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:49,914
Where's the key?

869
01:42:50,124 --> 01:42:53,585
- Where's the key?!
- In my coat. In the pocket.

870
01:42:57,508 --> 01:42:59,551
All right, get out. Move.

871
01:43:00,469 --> 01:43:01,553
In the boat.

872
01:43:20,574 --> 01:43:22,284
Do you swim?

873
01:43:23,036 --> 01:43:25,998
Here, take the wheel. This way, please.

874
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:29,459
Mind the step.

875
01:43:33,548 --> 01:43:36,051
Just isn't your day, is it?

876
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:43,600
- Where are we going?
- Venice.

877
01:43:44,018 --> 01:43:45,979
Take a look at that locker, will you?

878
01:43:46,103 --> 01:43:47,981
Charts,

879
01:43:48,107 --> 01:43:50,233
pistol, some flares.

880
01:43:50,358 --> 01:43:52,654
Give me those charts.

881
01:43:57,951 --> 01:44:00,745
Yes, we're here. Near lstria.

882
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:07,212
There's plenty of fuel. With a bit of luck
we'll be there by morning.

883
01:44:11,132 --> 01:44:15,262
Three man were found dead on the train
at Trieste. One of them was Grant.

884
01:44:15,387 --> 01:44:17,640
What have you to say, Number Five?

885
01:44:17,807 --> 01:44:20,393
He was Klebb's choice.
Her people failed.

886
01:44:20,559 --> 01:44:23,564
It was your plan!
They followed it implicitly!

887
01:44:23,729 --> 01:44:26,399
Impossible. It was perfect.

888
01:44:26,609 --> 01:44:29,279
Except for one thing.
They were dealing with Bond.

889
01:44:29,445 --> 01:44:31,405
Who is Bond

890
01:44:31,572 --> 01:44:33,450
compared with Kronsteen?

891
01:44:33,574 --> 01:44:35,995
Exactly. What have you to say to that,

892
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,372
Number Three?

893
01:44:44,379 --> 01:44:48,175
Bond is still alive and the Lektor
is not yet in our possession.

894
01:44:48,342 --> 01:44:52,138
I have already negotiated
with the Russians to return it to them.

895
01:44:52,304 --> 01:44:57,184
We've agreed a price. And SPECTRE
always delivers what it promises.

896
01:44:57,352 --> 01:45:00,982
Our whole organisation depends
on our keeping those promises.

897
01:45:03,901 --> 01:45:05,444
I warned you.

898
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:09,367
We do not tolerate failure, Number Three.
You know the penalty.

899
01:45:09,532 --> 01:45:12,201
Yes, Number One.

900
01:45:13,328 --> 01:45:15,831
Our rules are very simple. If you fail...

901
01:45:30,598 --> 01:45:35,480
1 2 seconds. One day we must
invent a faster-working venom.

902
01:45:35,604 --> 01:45:37,147
Number Three!

903
01:45:37,272 --> 01:45:38,899
Yes!

904
01:45:39,067 --> 01:45:42,319
I do not wish to tell the Russians
there will be another delay.

905
01:45:42,445 --> 01:45:44,489
There will be no delay, Number One.

906
01:45:53,916 --> 01:45:56,169
Which way are we going?

907
01:45:56,295 --> 01:45:59,841
The shortest route,
which is between those two mountains

908
01:45:59,966 --> 01:46:03,052
and straight along the coast.

909
01:46:18,028 --> 01:46:20,071
Ahoy, Mr Bond!

910
01:46:23,409 --> 01:46:25,703
Heave to, heave to!

911
01:46:46,352 --> 01:46:48,896
You're trapped, Mr Bond.

912
01:46:49,022 --> 01:46:53,069
You cannot escape!

913
01:46:53,818 --> 01:46:56,530
Rifle grenade, prepare to fire.

914
01:46:59,325 --> 01:47:02,161
We're coming through!
Pull over, SPECTRE Green.

915
01:47:02,286 --> 01:47:04,872
Get out of the way!
Give them a warning shot.

916
01:47:07,292 --> 01:47:08,711
Rifle grenade, fire!

917
01:47:12,966 --> 01:47:14,384
Forward machine gun, fire!

918
01:47:17,303 --> 01:47:18,764
You're firing too close.

919
01:47:18,888 --> 01:47:21,893
SPECTRE Red, SPECTRE Green,
you're firing too close.

920
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:27,232
You're trying to stop them,
not to sink them!

921
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:38,912
Here, take the wheel.

922
01:47:52,803 --> 01:47:54,639
Slow down.

923
01:47:56,599 --> 01:47:59,560
Slow down. Slow down all boats.

924
01:48:00,895 --> 01:48:03,607
Green, go alongside
while we keep you covered.

925
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:08,904
- Hands up, Mr Bond!
- Why give up?

926
01:48:09,029 --> 01:48:12,491
- Without the drums, we can go faster...
- Hand me the Very pistol.

927
01:48:12,616 --> 01:48:16,871
Keep your hands up, Mr Bond.
We're sending a boat to take you off.

928
01:48:28,052 --> 01:48:31,764
There's a saying in England.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

929
01:48:39,023 --> 01:48:41,525
Green, change your course! Go astern!

930
01:48:43,194 --> 01:48:45,738
Change course!

931
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:51,160
All boats, throw out your ammunition!
Get rid of it! Quick!

932
01:48:54,373 --> 01:48:55,373
Get rid of it!

933
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:00,463
Jump! Jump!

934
01:49:21,987 --> 01:49:24,367
Don't go away.

935
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:29,080
Yes?

936
01:49:29,288 --> 01:49:31,208
Thanks. Tell him to wait, will you?

937
01:49:31,332 --> 01:49:33,710
And send up a porter.

938
01:49:33,835 --> 01:49:35,254
Avanti!

939
01:49:35,962 --> 01:49:39,216
- Permesso, signore.
- Sì, prego.

940
01:49:39,341 --> 01:49:42,095
And also get me the British Consul.

941
01:49:42,886 --> 01:49:44,097
Thank you.

942
01:50:10,252 --> 01:50:12,546
Yes? Mr Maxwell, please.

943
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:16,051
- James Bond.
- James, we will miss the plane. We will...

944
01:50:16,175 --> 01:50:18,886
Hello, Paul. Bond here.

945
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:22,266
I want to thank you.
Tell the office we're on our way.

946
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:25,059
What was that?

947
01:50:26,102 --> 01:50:28,147
Here, leave that! I'll take it.

948
01:50:30,108 --> 01:50:33,237
Should be routine from here on in.
Not so many times...

949
01:50:34,822 --> 01:50:37,283
What was that you were saying?
Hello, hello?

950
01:50:37,408 --> 01:50:38,743
Klebb.

951
01:50:39,786 --> 01:50:42,788
James, are you still there? Hello!

952
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:51,006
Romanova,... the door!

953
01:51:17,371 --> 01:51:19,330
Take this.

954
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:24,281
Horrible woman.

955
01:52:24,405 --> 01:52:27,409
Yes. She's had her kicks.

956
01:52:44,429 --> 01:52:47,015
Here you are.
In case you ever need it again.

957
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:50,559
Oh, yes. All government property
has to be accounted for.

958
01:52:50,686 --> 01:52:54,605
But as I said before, we won't always
work on the company's time, will we?

959
01:52:54,731 --> 01:52:56,025
No.

960
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:04,617
James, behave yourself.
We are being filmed.

961
01:53:07,162 --> 01:53:09,457
Oh, not again.

962
01:53:15,505 --> 01:53:17,674
He was right, you know.

963
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,512
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
