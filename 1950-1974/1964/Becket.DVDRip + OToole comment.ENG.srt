1
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,940
Well, Thomas Becket,

2
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,420
are you satisfied?

3
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Here I am stripped,

4
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,660
kneeling at your tomb

5
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,060
while those treacherous
Saxon monks of yours

6
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,100
are getting ready
to thrash me.

7
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,340
Me, with my delicate skin.

8
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,420
I bet you'd never have
done the same for me.

9
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,780
But, I suppose I have
to do this penance

10
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,420
and make my peace with you.

11
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,980
What a strange
end to our story.

12
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,180
How cold it was
when we last met

13
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,820
on the shores of France.

14
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,220
Funny, it's nearly
always been cold,

15
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,740
except at the beginning

16
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,780
when we were friends.

17
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,740
We did have a few,

18
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,380
fine summer evenings
with the giris.

19
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,820
Did you love
Gwendolen, Archbishop?

20
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,660
Did you hate me the
night I took her from you,

21
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,460
shouting, "I am the King"?

22
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,260
Perhaps that's what you could

23
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,500
never forgive me for.

24
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,300
Look at them lurking there,

25
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,900
gloating.

26
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,700
Oh, Thomas,

27
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm ashamed of this
whole silly masquerade.

28
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,380
All right, so I've come
here to make my peace

29
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,700
with their Saxon hero,
because I need them now,

30
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,660
those Saxon peasants of yours.

31
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,780
Now I'll call them my sons,

32
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,060
as you wanted me to,

33
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,860
you taught me that too.

34
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,580
You taught me everything.

35
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,180
Those were the happy times.

36
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,260
Do you remember?

37
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
At the peep of dawn

38
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,460
and as usual
we'd been drinking

39
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,660
and wenching in the town.

40
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,500
You were even better
at that than I was.

41
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,680
Shhh, listen.

42
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,220
Upstairs.

43
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,700
She's up with someone.

44
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,260
Well, go on up.

45
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,020
Get up man, get on up there!

46
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,500
Quick, out through the window.

47
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,140
Thank you.

48
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,220
Come on now.

49
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,460
Come on.

50
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,260
Come on.

51
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,820
Come here.

52
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,380
I'll lay my hands on
her, the dirty slut.

53
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,780
Where is he the swine?

54
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,700
You don't,

55
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,420
don't you dare,
don't you dare.

56
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,980
Here catch.

57
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,460
Go on, get in there.

58
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,900
Here take my good boot.

59
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,299
I can't get my boot back on.

60
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,660
Faster now.

61
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,820
Oh, rub harder pig,

62
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm cold.

63
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,420
Ah, no one does it
the way you do, Thomas.

64
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,580
Thank you.

65
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,940
I think you actually
like the cold.

66
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,020
I made you a nobleman,

67
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
why do you play
at being my valet?

68
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,460
I'm your servant
in the council chamber,

69
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,980
or here in the bath.

70
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,700
My Norman Barons resent it,

71
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,380
they feel it's your Saxon way

72
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,740
of mocking their nobility.

73
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,300
Nobility lies
in the man, My Prince,

74
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,900
not in the towel.

75
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,820
Have you any idea
how much trouble

76
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,020
I took to make you noble?

77
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,900
I think so,

78
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,460
I recall you pointed
a finger and said,

79
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,500
"Thomas Becket
you are noble".

80
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,580
The Queen and your mother
became very agitated.

81
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,420
They're always agitated.

82
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,340
No, I mean trouble
from the Barons,

83
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,220
they hate you, you know?

84
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,540
Of course, one always
hates what one wrongs.

85
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,900
When you Norman's
invaded England,

86
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,260
you seized our Saxon land,

87
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,620
burned our Saxon homes,

88
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,260
raped our Saxon sisters.

89
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,100
Naturally you hate Saxons.

90
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,940
Don't include me,

91
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,740
it was my great
grandfather William

92
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,660
who was called
"The Conqueror",

93
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,500
I'm an old resident.

94
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,140
I did not mean you.

95
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,460
Didn't you?

96
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,020
You know when I took
you into my service,

97
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,900
everyone predicted you'd
put a knife in my back.

98
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,420
Did you believe them?

99
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,300
No, I showed them that
you were a man of honor,

100
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,460
and a collaborator.

101
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,060
That was accurate of you.

102
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,620
How do you combine the two?

103
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,860
My Lord?

104
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,660
Honor and collaboration?

105
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,220
I don't try.

106
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,620
I love good living,
and good living is Norman.

107
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,940
I love life and the
Saxons only birthright

108
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,780
is to be slaughtered.

109
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,100
One collaborates to live.

110
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,900
And honor?

111
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,860
Honor is a concern
of the living.

112
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,460
One can't very well
be concerned about it

113
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,140
once one's dead.

114
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,780
You're too clever
for me, Thomas,

115
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,460
but I know there's something

116
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,980
not quite right
about your reasoning.

117
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,580
Honor is a
private matter within,

118
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,540
it's an idea

119
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,860
and every man has
his own version of it.

120
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,580
How gracefully
you tell your King

121
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,420
to mind his own business.

122
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,020
Time for the council
meeting, My Lord.

123
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,020
Ugh.

124
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,260
Will My Lord dine
with me tonight?

125
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,660
On gold plates?

126
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,660
Always.

127
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,060
I am your King,
and I eat off silver.

128
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,060
Your expenses are heavy,

129
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,220
I have only my
pleasure to pay for.

130
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,540
Tonight you can
do me the honor

131
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,620
of christening my forks.

132
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,500
Forks?

133
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,620
Yes, from Florence.

134
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,740
A new little invention,

135
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,900
it's for pronging meat
and carrying it to the mouth,

136
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,460
it saves you
dirtying your fingers.

137
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,780
Then you dirty the fork.

138
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,140
Yes, but its washable.

139
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,140
So are you fingers,

140
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
I don't see the point.

141
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,140
Well, it hasn't any
practically speaking

142
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,060
but it's refined,

143
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,940
it's subtle,

144
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,220
it's very un-Norman.

145
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,260
You must order me some.

146
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,820
For my Barons.

147
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,940
I have enough
forks to go around,

148
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,420
bring the gentleman
with you tonight.

149
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,380
I shall.

150
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,300
We won't tell them
what they're for.

151
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,700
They'll probably think
they're a new kind of dagger.

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
All right, gentlemen,

153
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,940
the Council is open.

154
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Gentlemen,
I've called you here

155
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,420
to find out why
a simple request for taxes

156
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,140
causes such
unpriestly caterwauling.

157
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,060
My Lord...

158
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,780
We must come to
an understanding

159
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,540
about who rules this kingdom,

160
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,340
the church...

161
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,860
My Lord, I wish to ask you...

162
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,380
Just a moment, Archbishop.

163
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,060
The church, or me?

164
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,020
There are many troublesome
issues between us,

165
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,740
which call for a reckoning.

166
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,100
Amongst other abuses

167
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,220
is the claim you make

168
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,380
of judging your clergy

169
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,260
accused of civil crimes

170
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,100
in your own
ecclesiastical courts.

171
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
I warn you,

172
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,860
there can be only one
justice in this country,

173
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,020
and that is the Kings.

174
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,740
But before we quarrel,

175
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,020
here is some happy news.

176
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,580
I have decided to revive

177
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,380
the office of
Chancellor of England,

178
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,380
keeper of the Lion's Seal,

179
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,379
and entrust it to
our loyal servant

180
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,460
Thomas Becket.

181
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,340
Yes, my little Saxon?

182
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,740
My Lord?

183
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,700
Well, for once I've
taken you by surprise.

184
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,420
My Lord,

185
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,900
this is a stupendous honor,

186
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,980
for which I may
not be worthy.

187
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm inexperienced
in these matters

188
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,220
and frivolous by nature.

189
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,140
Rubbish,

190
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,860
you know more than
all of us put together.

191
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,900
He's read books
you know, its amazing.

192
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,940
He's drunk and wenched
his way through London

193
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,500
but he's thinking all the
time, aren't you, Thomas?

194
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,580
He'll checkmate
the lot of you,

195
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,940
even you Archbishop.

196
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,340
I never did anything
without your advice.

197
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,780
No one knew it,

198
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,220
now everyone will, that's all.

199
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,580
There,

200
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,340
that's the
Great Seal of England,

201
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,740
don't lose it,

202
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,340
without the seal
there's no more England

203
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,820
and we'll all have to pack up

204
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,740
and go back to Normandy.

205
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,460
May I crave leave

206
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,860
to greet our young
and learned friend,

207
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,380
for I noticed him

208
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,620
when he was first
made Archdeacon.

209
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
Thank you, Archbishop,

210
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,820
but don't rely
too much on Becket

211
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,140
to play your game,

212
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,540
he's my man.

213
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,260
I'd forgotten you were
an Archdeacon, Thomas.

214
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,020
So had I, My Prince.

215
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,780
Now to business.

216
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,700
The law demands

217
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,019
that every landowner

218
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,500
send soldiers
to give me service

219
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,140
or pay a tax in silver,

220
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,420
is that correct?

221
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,020
I have heard so, My Lord.

222
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,580
We are about
to cross the channel

223
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,300
to force Louis of France

224
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,300
to return the Norman towns
he has taken from us.

225
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,420
I have received
neither soldiers

226
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,540
nor silver from you
gentlemen, for this war.

227
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,660
But surely one must
distinguish between

228
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,340
the individual landowner

229
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,980
and God's church?

230
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,380
The law doesn't distinguish.

231
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,140
But this has never
been spoken of before.

232
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,180
I've never been
this poor before.

233
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,060
No, I've made up my mind

234
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,220
and I'm passing
around the plate,

235
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,620
just drop in the money.

236
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,420
Oh, my backside's sore.

237
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,940
Is that all,
count your blessings, Sire.

238
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,220
I don't know
about you, Thomas,

239
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,220
but I'm starving,

240
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,980
have them bring
us something to eat.

241
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,100
The layman who shirks his duty

242
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,140
and fails to supply
his King with arms

243
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,700
should pay the tax,

244
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,020
nobody will question that.

245
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,140
Least of all the clergy.

246
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,300
On the other hand,
a priest's duty

247
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,020
is to assist his
King with his prayers

248
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,260
for Godliness and peace,

249
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,220
he cannot maintain men at arms

250
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,300
without violating
the very essence

251
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,300
of that sacred function

252
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,420
therefore he cannot be
held liable for the tax.

253
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,260
Your priest
fought well enough

254
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,380
in the days of a conquest

255
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
when there was
booty to be had.

256
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,780
Sword in fist,
rumps in the saddle,

257
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,940
death to Saxons scum,
it's God's will,

258
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
it's God's will.

259
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,060
Those violent days are over.

260
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,900
The priest is back
in his sanctuary

261
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,940
it is peacetime now.

262
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,500
But not for long, pay up,

263
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,740
I don't intend to budge.

264
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,900
Come on Chancellor,
say something,

265
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,460
has your new title
made you tongue-tied?

266
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,140
May I respectfully draw

267
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,099
to My Lord
Archbishop's attention

268
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,540
one small point?

269
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,300
Respectfully but firmly,

270
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,940
you're Chancellor now.

271
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,620
England is a ship,

272
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,300
the King is the
captain of the ship.

273
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,460
That's neat, I like that.

274
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,980
My Lord Chancellor,

275
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,340
in point of fact,

276
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,220
there is also a saying

277
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,100
the captain is sole
master after God.

278
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,300
After God!

279
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,900
Nobody's questioning
God's authority, Archbishop.

280
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,300
Most certainly God
protects the ship

281
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,420
by inspiring the captain

282
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
but I've never heard

283
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,700
that he determines
the wages of the crew,

284
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,540
nor instructs the
paymaster in his duties.

285
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,220
God has more
important business.

286
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,580
Our young deacon's ambition

287
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,140
has carried him
away from the church

288
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,380
but he cannot have forgotten
that what is important

289
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,100
is revealed to man
only through his church

290
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,940
in the person of our
Holy Father in Rome,

291
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,020
his bishops and his priests.

292
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,620
Or does the Chancellor
think otherwise?

293
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,060
True, there is a priest
onboard every ship.

294
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,380
He gives God's blessings,

295
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,740
but neither God nor the church

296
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,660
ask him to take the
wheel from the helmsman.

297
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,020
My Reverend Lord,
the Bishop of London

298
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,619
who I understand
is the son of a sailor

299
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,460
surely cannot
have forgotten that.

300
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,580
I will not allow
personal insinuation

301
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,180
to compromise the integrity

302
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,820
and honor of the church.

303
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,100
Please, Bishop, no long words.

304
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,940
All that's at stake
here is its money.

305
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,900
I need money to
fight the French,

306
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,260
will the church give it to me,

307
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,660
yes or no?

308
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,780
My Lord,

309
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,020
your illustrious ancestor
William the Conqueror

310
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,740
granted these tax
exemptions to the church.

311
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,100
May he rest in peace,

312
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,620
where he is now,
he doesn't need money.

313
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,860
I'm still on Earth and I do.

314
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,300
This is not primarily

315
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,780
a question of money,
Your Highness,

316
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,260
this is a
question of principle.

317
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,780
I need troops, Bishop.

318
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,060
I've sent for 3,000 Swiss

319
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,140
to help me fight
the King of France

320
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,580
and no one has ever paid
the Swiss with principles.

321
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,940
My Lord, Chancellor,

322
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,740
it is pointless to
continue this discussion.

323
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,020
The law has given us
the means of coercion,

324
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,740
we will use it.

325
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,860
You,

326
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,740
you owe everything
to Holy Mother Church.

327
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,660
Would you dare plunge
a dagger into her bosom?

328
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,700
My Lord and King who
rules by the grace of God,

329
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,860
has given me his seal

330
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,820
with the three
lions to protect.

331
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,700
My mother is England now.

332
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,820
Traitor,

333
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,060
Saxon.

334
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
My Reverend friend,

335
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,540
I strongly suggest that
you respect my Chancellor

336
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,420
or else I'll call my guards.

337
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Ahh, here they are now.

338
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,140
Oh, no,

339
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,300
it's only my snack.

340
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,100
Now, gentlemen,
if you will excuse me,

341
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,220
at this hour in the morning

342
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,540
I need sustenance

343
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,980
or else I tend to feel weak

344
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,180
and a king must never weaken,

345
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,780
I'm sure you will agree.

346
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,700
I'll have it in my chapel.

347
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,140
Then I can pray
directly afterwards.

348
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,540
Come on, Thomas,
keep me company.

349
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,340
He means it's
time for the hunt.

350
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,060
Not until we have
eaten, my dear Bishop.

351
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,620
Race?

352
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,740
Right.

353
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,940
The Kings hunt.

354
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,500
Eh?

355
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,940
Oh, inside quick.

356
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,100
Let's get under cover

357
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,580
before we're drowned.

358
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,900
We've lost the Barons.

359
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Oh, they'll find us,

360
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,180
here, hold this.

361
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,140
Oh, I'm cold, my pretty.

362
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,820
Go on sit on there,
that's a good girl.

363
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,380
Go on, get on there.

364
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,780
I'm freezing,
get the fire going.

365
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,140
There'll be no
wood in this house.

366
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,100
In the middle of the forest?

367
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,060
These people are entitled

368
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,700
to two measures
of deadwood a year,

369
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,460
one branch more and they hang.

370
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,740
My edict?

371
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,340
Your edict.

372
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,940
Come here, old man.

373
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,340
We need firewood.

374
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,780
Don't be afraid.

375
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,980
Thomas!

376
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,660
Thomas, come here!

377
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,460
Look at this.

378
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,900
She stinks a bit
but we could wash her,

379
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,460
what would you think
of it, cleaned up a little?

380
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,940
She's a child.

381
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,140
What would it be
like when it's a woman.

382
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,060
How old would you
say it was, 16, 17?

383
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,420
It can speak, My Lord,
how old are you.

384
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,180
Eh?

385
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,540
Of course it can speak.

386
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,980
How old's your daughter, dog?

387
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,380
Odd the number of
dumb people I meet

388
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,580
when I set foot
out of my palace,

389
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,140
I rule over
a kingdom of mutes.

390
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,960
They're afraid.

391
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,100
Quite right, too.

392
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Don't stand there,
put the wood on the fire.

393
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,820
Hello, pretty.

394
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,500
Look at it.

395
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,100
The odd thing is it's so ugly,

396
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,300
yet it makes such
pretty daughters.

397
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,660
You're a member of the
family, explain that?

398
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,460
Well, at 20 before
he lost his teeth

399
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,980
and took on that ageless
look the common people have,

400
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,020
he may have been handsome.

401
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,220
He may have had
one night of love,

402
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,220
one moment when he was
a king and shed his fear.

403
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,580
Afterwards, his
paupers life went on

404
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,420
eternally the same.

405
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,620
The moment faded

406
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,660
and he forgot it all,

407
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,140
the seed was sown.

408
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,980
Will she grow ugly too?

409
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,620
Surely.

410
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,820
If we made her a whore

411
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,140
and kept her at the palace,

412
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,020
would she stay pretty?

413
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,260
Perhaps.

414
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,380
Then we'd be doing her
a service, wouldn't we?

415
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,660
No doubt.

416
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,900
Look at it,

417
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,940
it understands every word.

418
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,460
Stop staring at me, dog,

419
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,220
get me something to drink.

420
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,260
I have some
drink in my saddle.

421
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,820
What's the matter, Thomas?

422
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,180
Nothing.

423
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm getting you a drink.

424
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,020
Thank you, Thomas.

425
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,740
Our escort.
want some?

426
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,380
What's the matter, you hurt?

427
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,780
It's nothing.

428
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,460
Show me.

429
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,060
Now you know you can't
stand the sight of blood.

430
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,940
My horse bit me.

431
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,060
That is too funny.

432
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,340
My Lord here, makes us all
look silly at the jousts

433
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,060
with his fancy horsemanship,

434
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,300
he goes to his saddlebags

435
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,860
and gets bitten like a groom.

436
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,620
You look quite
shaken, little Saxon.

437
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,620
Funny, I can't bear
to think of you in pain.

438
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,340
All this just
to get me a drink

439
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,780
wounded in the
service of the king.

440
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,580
This deserves a gift.

441
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,340
What would you like?

442
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,500
This girl,

443
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,740
I fancy her.

444
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,580
That's very tiresome of you,

445
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,380
I fancy her myself,

446
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,780
and where that
subjects concerned

447
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,780
friendship goes by the boar.

448
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,660
All right, she's yours.

449
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,740
Thank you, My Prince.

450
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,780
But you will return the
favor equally one day.

451
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,780
At your pleasure.

452
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,980
Equally, favor for favor,

453
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,420
you give me your
word as a gentleman?

454
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,220
I do.

455
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,220
Right, she's yours.

456
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,260
Shall we take her with us

457
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,420
or shall we have her sent?

458
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,300
No, no, no, the
soldiers can bring her.

459
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,020
Wash your daughter,
dog, and kill her fleas,

460
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
she's coming to the palace

461
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,340
for My Lordship here.

462
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
He's a Saxon too,

463
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,980
so I hope you'll be pleased.

464
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,420
Give him money, Thomas,

465
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,580
I'm feeling generous
this morning.

466
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,100
Don't worry
about your daughter,

467
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,940
nobody will come
to take her away,

468
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,860
I'll see to that.

469
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,940
And tell your son

470
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,260
he should stay
hidden in the forest

471
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,220
until he can
handle a knife better.

472
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,820
Here.

473
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,300
Forgive me,

474
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,060
not for fighting,
my dear Baron,

475
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,980
for eating.

476
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,260
Go on, it's lovely.

477
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,820
Noisy brutes.

478
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,700
You seem to spend
a great deal of time

479
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,140
in their company.

480
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,100
No, I can forget it
when I come to you.

481
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,660
I'm happy that
I can relieve you.

482
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,380
Now don't tease me
tonight, Gwendolen.

483
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,580
I'm off to France
again tomorrow, and war.

484
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,660
I am My Lord's captive,

485
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,460
whatever his purpose

486
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,980
and whatever his mood.

487
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,260
I hope so.

488
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,900
It is God's will,

489
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,940
since he gave the Norman's

490
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,620
victory over my people.

491
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,540
And that's the only
reason you're here?

492
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,980
If the Welsh had won the war,

493
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,420
I would have married
a man of my own race

494
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,900
at my father's castle.

495
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,380
God did not will it so.

496
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,980
All right.

497
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,020
I'm sorry I was so
late coming to you

498
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,660
but the King is demanding

499
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,420
and the Barons
have to be kept at bay.

500
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,180
I'm lying,

501
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,500
you are My Lord,

502
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,940
God or no God.

503
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,900
If we had won the war,

504
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,300
you could just as easily

505
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,980
have taken me from
my father's castle.

506
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,100
I would have come with you

507
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,060
for you had taken my heart

508
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,620
before you captured my body.

509
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,820
Have I said
something wrong?

510
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,620
Somehow I can
never support the idea

511
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,820
of being loved.

512
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,540
I told you that.

513
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,660
Oh, please.

514
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,100
Sit.

515
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,180
Play something,

516
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,820
something sad,

517
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,220
it helps the digestion.

518
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,940
Play.

519
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,540
Oh, sweet and melancholy.

520
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,259
Sit, Thomas,

521
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,420
witness one of
my finer moments.

522
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I behave like a brute,

523
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,700
but I'm as soft as
swan's down inside.

524
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,660
You know, Thomas,

525
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,340
sometimes I think
that you and I

526
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,500
are the only civilized
men in England.

527
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
I eat with a fork,

528
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,260
and you've made
me into a man

529
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,380
of the most
delicate sensibilities

530
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,700
and now if you
really love me

531
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,300
you should find me a
beautiful well bred girl

532
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,460
to give me a little polish.

533
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,140
Favor for favor,

534
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,020
do you remember?

535
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
I am your servant, My Lord.

536
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,820
All that I have is yours.

537
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,060
But you are also
gracious enough to say

538
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,820
I am your friend.

539
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,780
Yes, that's what I mean,

540
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,140
as one friend to another.

541
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,220
You do care for her then?

542
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,220
You do care about something?

543
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,220
Or do you?

544
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,140
Go on, tell me,

545
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,940
tell me if you
care for her or not?

546
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,020
I said, "favor for favor"

547
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,180
and I asked for your word.

548
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,020
And I gave it to you.

549
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,420
Right.

550
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,620
Well, that's settled then.

551
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,260
May I have a moment's grace?

552
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,620
Surely, surely.

553
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,460
After all, I'm not a savage.

554
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,980
Did you promise me to him?

555
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,340
No.

556
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,260
I promised him
anything he asked for.

557
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,780
I never thought
it would be you.

558
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,180
If he sends me away tomorrow,

559
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,980
will you take me back?

560
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,620
No.

561
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,980
I leave you this,

562
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,780
you've almost
learned to play it.

563
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,700
You've not found anything

564
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,300
in the whole worid
to care for, have you?

565
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,420
No.

566
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,700
We both belong
to a conquered race,

567
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,020
but you've forgotten

568
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,500
that people
robbed of everything

569
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,420
can still have one thing
left to call their own.

570
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,340
Yes,

571
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,820
where honor should be,

572
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,220
in me there is only a void.

573
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,580
I loved you,

574
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,820
Thomas Becket.

575
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,340
My Lord.

576
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,060
Enter.

577
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,060
How careless you are, Thomas,

578
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,700
you had forgotten her.

579
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,060
But you told me
that you fancied her

580
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,020
and I remembered.

581
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,420
You see I really
am your friend

582
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,420
and you're wrong
not to love me.

583
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,340
Goodnight, Sire.

584
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,299
Shall I undress, My Lord?

585
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,179
What?

586
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,620
Shall I undress?

587
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,100
Thomas?

588
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,300
Thomas?

589
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,580
She's dead.

590
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,340
She's killed herself.

591
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,460
All this blood.

592
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,340
Help me, Thomas,

593
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,100
I'm frightened.

594
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,140
I'm the King!

595
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,860
Get rid of her.

596
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,860
Guard.

597
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
I'm sleeping here tonight.

598
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,860
Give this girl a silver
piece and let her go.

599
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,500
He won't hurt you.

600
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,780
I don't want to
be alone tonight.

601
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,860
I'm here, My Prince.

602
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,140
You'll hate me now.

603
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,660
I'll never be
able to trust you.

604
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,620
You have nothing to fear.

605
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,140
You gave me your seal,

606
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,500
and while I wear it

607
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,500
my duty is to my king.

608
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,380
But I'll never know

609
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,660
what you're thinking.

610
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,580
Sleep now.

611
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,420
We cross the channel tomorrow.

612
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,620
When we face the French
on the field of battle

613
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,780
there will be simple
answers to everything,

614
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,580
so long as Becket must
improvise his honor

615
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,900
from day to day,

616
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,180
he will serve you faithfully.

617
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,020
But what if one day

618
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,340
he should meet
his honor in truth,

619
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,300
face to face?

620
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,340
But where is Becket's honor?

621
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,900
An early good morning
to you, gentlemen,

622
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,420
I've just ridden
from the town.

623
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,860
I've arranged for
its capitulation.

624
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,339
Well, will there be loot?

625
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,580
No, I want these people

626
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,820
to collaborate
with good grace.

627
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,060
The French Bishop will
deliver the keys of the city

628
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,500
to the King at eight
o'clock in the cathedral.

629
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,580
No fighting,
what are we here for?

630
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,140
To secure King Henry's
possessions in France.

631
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,500
You have three more
towns to recapture.

632
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,500
I'd rather sack the town
and slaughter the lot.

633
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,180
Yes, and have a dead city.

634
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,660
No, I want to give
the King living cities

635
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,900
to increase his wealth.

636
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,020
From dawn this morning

637
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,580
I'm the townspeople's
dearest friend.

638
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,700
And what of England's pride?

639
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,620
England's pride, my dear Baron

640
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,420
is to succeed.

641
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,700
What a mentality.

642
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,700
Chancellor of England.

643
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Who knows what he is,

644
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,620
he's a Saxon.

645
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,660
Release him.

646
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,060
Leave us Sergeant.

647
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,860
My Lord?

648
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,580
Leave us.

649
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,900
What are you, a Saxon
monk doing in France,

650
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,020
they'll kill you, you know?

651
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,180
I'm prepared to die.

652
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,300
How old are you?

653
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,900
18.

654
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,540
Hmm, dying is easy at 18.

655
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,740
Your knife stinks of onions

656
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,780
like every proper
little Saxon's knife.

657
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,660
You used to be a Saxon.

658
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,380
Now you belong
to the Normans.

659
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,740
I see.

660
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,100
A Saxon knife

661
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,460
for a Saxon collaborator.

662
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,780
Did you think
that by killing me

663
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,980
you could liberate your race?

664
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,780
No, not my race, myself.

665
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
From what?

666
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,380
My shame and yours.

667
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,300
The Normans have
occupied England

668
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,020
for a hundred years
since Hastings,

669
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,900
shame is an old
vintage to the Saxon.

670
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,140
Your father and
your grandfather

671
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,660
drank it to the dregs.

672
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,140
The cup is empty now.

673
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,220
No, never.

674
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,980
What's your name?

675
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,780
What is your name?

676
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,740
John.

677
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,540
Sergeant.

678
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,900
Well, Brother John,

679
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,100
I'm going to save your life.

680
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,460
It has no importance for me

681
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,780
but it's very rare for fate

682
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,500
to bring one face to face

683
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,020
with one's own
ghost when young.

684
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,100
My Lord?

685
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,860
Have this monk
returned to England

686
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,580
to the custody of the
Abbott of his monastery.

687
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,060
I want him treated
without brutality,

688
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,940
but carefully watched.

689
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,900
Yes, My Lord.

690
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,780
My Lord?

691
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,220
Good morning, My Lord.

692
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,500
Oh, French wine.

693
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,700
I had a little
too much last night.

694
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,780
It's their major
contribution to civilization.

695
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,220
Here's another.

696
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,260
I must say I adore
my French possessions,

697
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,580
they're certainly
worth recapturing.

698
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,460
What's your name, my pretty?

699
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,500
Name?

700
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,380
Marie.

701
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,340
Marie, very French.

702
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,380
A French luxury
is very luxurious.

703
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,979
And for the moment free.

704
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,300
We take possession of
the town this morning.

705
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,620
Yes, I heard.

706
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,740
You managed that
very well, Thomas.

707
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,540
Personally, I shall
miss the fighting,

708
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,580
meanwhile we have
some business to discuss.

709
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,700
I've been studying the
dispatches from England.

710
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,220
You love work don't you?

711
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,740
If you love anything.

712
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,780
I love doing what I have
to do, and doing it well.

713
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,460
You'd be as efficient against
me as for me, wouldn't you?

714
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,700
If fate had
arranged it that way.

715
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,580
So what in most
people is morality,

716
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,940
in you it's
just an exercise in,

717
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
what's the word?

718
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,500
Aesthetics.

719
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,020
Yes, that's the word.

720
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,820
Always, aesthetics.

721
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,820
Yes.

722
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,820
Well now,

723
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,780
look at that.

724
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,100
Isn't that aesthetic, too?

725
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,100
Some people go into
ecstasies over cathedrals

726
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,340
but that's a work of art.

727
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,340
Look at it,

728
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,300
round as an apple.

729
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,100
Want her?

730
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,620
Business, My Lord.

731
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,020
All right, business.

732
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,340
Sit down.

733
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,900
Listen carefully, Marie,

734
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,100
to the droppings of the
greatest brain of our day.

735
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,500
Now piecing together
all the information

736
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,620
I've received from London

737
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,780
there are some unpleasant
deductions to be made.

738
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,300
The power of the
Bishops is increasing

739
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,300
like the pestilence,

740
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,540
soon it will rival your own.

741
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,980
Talk sense, Thomas,

742
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,339
priests are always intriguing

743
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,660
but I can crush
them anytime I wish.

744
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,820
If you don't crush them now,

745
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,980
in five year's time

746
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,020
there will be two
Kings of England,

747
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,220
the Archbishop of
Canterbury and you,

748
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,900
in ten year's time
there will be only one.

749
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,340
And it won't be me?

750
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,300
I fear not.

751
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,980
Grant to horse,
Thomas, to horse,

752
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,020
war on the clergy,
death to the Archbishop.

753
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,060
My Lord, I can't breathe.

754
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,820
What are you doing down there,

755
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,700
spying for the clergy?

756
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,780
Be off with you.

757
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,580
Put on your
clothes and go home.

758
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,740
My Lord, am I to come
back to the camp tonight?

759
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,660
Yes,

760
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,580
no,

761
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,700
I don't know.

762
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,700
I'm thinking of priests
now, not you, go away.

763
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,580
Wait, I'd rather be sure

764
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,340
I'm getting
another one as good.

765
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,140
Yes, come back tonight.

766
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,540
You're adorable.

767
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,180
You must always
tell them that,

768
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,940
even when you pay.

769
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,540
That's high politics too.

770
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,100
Only one,

771
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,180
it won't be me?

772
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,980
It won't be you.

773
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,020
But what will God say
if I attack his church,

774
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,980
after all they're his bishops?

775
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,380
We must manage the church.

776
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,700
One can always come to a,

777
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,420
sensible little
arrangement with God.

778
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,300
Becket, you're a monster.

779
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,460
You flatter me, My Lord.

780
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,140
But please,
My Lord, dress quickly.

781
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,740
It's, it's inelegant
for conquerors to be late.

782
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,500
You're a monster.

783
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,500
You see, they love us
dearly, these French.

784
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,100
So they should,
we paid them enough.

785
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,460
In that case, we
should have found some

786
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,620
that didn't dress
out of a rag barrel.

787
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,540
The rich are at home sulking.

788
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,060
Supporters of
King Louis of France?

789
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,420
No, it just
would've cost too much.

790
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,700
That sounds real.

791
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,220
Yes, we have soldiers
disguised in the crowd

792
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,580
to encourage enthusiasm.

793
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,820
Why must you destroy
all of my illusions?

794
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,900
Because you should
have none, My Prince.

795
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,820
What do you see?

796
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,420
Reality.

797
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,180
Stop here!

798
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,540
The Bishop is waiting.

799
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,900
As if it mattered what
I do with a Bishop

800
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,140
whose city I've just taken.

801
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,420
It matters.

802
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,020
Am I the strongest,
or am I not?

803
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,180
You are today,

804
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,060
but one must never drive
one's enemy to despair,

805
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,740
it makes him strong

806
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,100
gentleness is better politics,

807
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,660
it saps virility.

808
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,940
A good occupational
force must never crush,

809
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,740
it must corrupt.

810
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,620
Make a note of the house.

811
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,260
Oh, never mind.

812
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,660
My Lord, the Bishop.

813
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,220
Yes, papa.

814
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,900
No, papa.

815
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,180
Put your men at rest, Captain.

816
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,020
Is this William, of Corbeil?

817
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,300
Yes, Sire.

818
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,660
I hardly recognized you

819
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,740
without a tankard
covering your face.

820
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,140
How did they pry
you away from it?

821
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,300
I had urgent messages from
London for you, My Lord.

822
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,820
It seems that God

823
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,540
is on our side
after all, Thomas.

824
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,020
What is that, My Prince?

825
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,740
He's just recalled the
Archbishop of Canterbury

826
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,940
to his bosom.

827
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,500
That frail old man,

828
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:57,060
he was the first Norman
to take an interest in me.

829
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,900
God rest his soul.

830
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,260
He will, he will

831
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,620
and he'll be much
more use to God

832
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,500
than he ever was to me.

833
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,740
Thomas.

834
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,900
An extraordinary idea
is creeping into my mind.

835
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,940
A masterstroke,

836
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,340
I'm suddenly
very intelligent.

837
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,580
It probably comes
from making love

838
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,180
to that French
girl last night.

839
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,060
I'm subtle,

840
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,860
I'm even profound.

841
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,780
Oh, I'm so profound
it's making my head spin.

842
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,980
Are you listening
to me, Thomas?

843
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,980
I'm listening, My Prince.

844
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,420
We need a new
Archbishop of Canterbury.

845
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,980
I think there is
a man we can rely on.

846
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,580
No matter who it is,

847
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,460
once the Archbishop's
miter is on his head

848
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,180
he will not longer
be on your side.

849
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,100
But if the
Archbishop is my man,

850
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,700
if Canterbury
is for the King,

851
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,980
how could his power
possibly get in my way?

852
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,700
My Lord,
we know your bishops,

853
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,740
once enthroned at Canterbury,

854
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,620
every one of them will
grow dizzy with power.

855
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,900
Not this man.

856
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,060
This is someone who doesn't
know what dizziness means,

857
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,940
someone who
isn't afraid of God.

858
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,860
I'm sorry to deprive
you of the French giris

859
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,700
and the other
spoils of victory but,

860
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,180
are you listening
to me, Thomas?

861
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,020
You're leaving
for England tonight.

862
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,500
On what mission, My Prince?

863
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,340
You are going to
deliver a letter

864
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,980
to all the bishops of England.

865
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,020
Uh-huh.

866
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,780
My royal edict nominating
you, Thomas Becket,

867
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,580
Primate of England,

868
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,860
Archbishop of Canterbury.

869
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,340
Shut up.

870
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,660
Thomas, I'm in deadly earnest.

871
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,060
My Lord,

872
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,780
don't do this.

873
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,020
You have an odd way
of taking good news.

874
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,980
I should think
you'd be triumphant.

875
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,620
But I, I'm not even a priest.

876
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,620
You're a deacon,

877
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,300
you can be ordained priest

878
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,140
and consecrated
Archbishop the next day.

879
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,820
Have you considered
what the Pope would say?

880
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,940
I'll pay his price.

881
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,020
My Lord,

882
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,020
this frightens me.

883
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,260
I thought you had God in the
palm of your hand, Thomas.

884
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,860
I beg of you,

885
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,500
do not do this.

886
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,100
You've never
disappointed me, Thomas,

887
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,780
and you're the
only man I can trust.

888
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,900
You'll leave for
England tonight.

889
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,140
Becket?

890
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,780
Thank you for returning
to us the keys of our city.

891
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,460
The die is cast, Thomas,

892
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,980
make the most of it.

893
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,340
And if I know you,

894
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,460
I'm sure you will.

895
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,300
There you are.

896
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,060
Thank you, My Lord.

897
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,860
Thank you, My Lord.

898
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,260
You're welcome,
it will keep you warm.

899
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,740
He'll only sell it for drink.

900
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,100
Then that will keep him warm.

901
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,620
Yes, Your Grace.

902
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,580
No, not Your Grace,

903
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,740
I will not be consecrated
Archbishop until tomorrow.

904
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,420
I'm sorry, Father.

905
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,860
That is temporarily correct.

906
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,980
You don't really intend

907
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,580
to give away
your winter cloaks?

908
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,380
Everything, has all
the gold plate been sold?

909
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,900
Yes, the money from the
sales is in those purses.

910
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,260
Excellent, bring me
the rest of the money.

911
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,620
But Your Grace...
I mean, Father...

912
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,340
Everything.

913
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,900
Well, welcome to
Canterbury, My Lord Bishop,

914
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,900
is anything wrong?

915
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,140
May I ask what is
happening here?

916
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,500
Go sell all that thou hast
and give it to the poor

917
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,060
and thou shal't have
treasure in heaven.

918
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,460
I doubt if the Lord, Jesus

919
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,380
meant that to apply
to a Chancellor

920
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,220
about to be
consecrated Archbishop.

921
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,060
Perhaps then it's
a touch of vanity.

922
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,300
A truly saintly man,

923
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,540
I know would never
do all this in one day.

924
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,300
Let us call it
the clumsy gesture

925
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,820
of a spiritual gatecrasher.

926
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,340
Most clever,

927
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,540
an Archbishop who
gives all so dramatically

928
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,060
to the people would be
most popular with them.

929
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,300
Oh no, Folliot,

930
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,980
I'm simply
enjoying all of this.

931
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,100
I'm beginning to
believe he's not a

932
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,380
sad God after all.

933
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,780
Forgive me, I fear my
inexperienced methods

934
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,180
will never meet
with your approval.

935
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,060
I know that you cast
the only vote against me.

936
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,060
In the end I gave way
to the King's wishes.

937
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,740
I don't blame
your reluctance

938
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,500
as Bishop of London
and senior churchman

939
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,060
you should've
been Archbishop.

940
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,780
Now to have to
consecrate me instead

941
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,540
and place the
miter on my head.

942
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,300
I have no choice.

943
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,980
I'm only performing
my function as Bishop.

944
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,460
I see you still wear the seal

945
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,300
of the King's Chancellor.

946
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,180
Yes, I will
continue to wear it,

947
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,540
that and the
Archbishop's ring.

948
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,220
You do not find
this inconsistent?

949
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,740
No, God is best served

950
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,500
when the two rest
side by side in harmony.

951
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,060
These excessive
acts of humility

952
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,980
will not compensate for
subservience to the crown.

953
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,500
Thank you.

954
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,020
We are both aware of the
delicacy of my position.

955
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,820
Let us trust that God

956
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,340
will find a solution for it.

957
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,220
And now,

958
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,740
since humility seems to be

959
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,100
a little hard on the knees,

960
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,020
I trust you will be
comfortable under our roof,

961
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,020
My Lord Bishop.

962
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,140
Dear Lord,

963
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,500
I wish there was something

964
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,060
I really regretted
parting with

965
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,540
so that I might
offer it to you.

966
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,540
But forgive me, Lord,

967
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,180
it's like going on a holiday,

968
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,660
I've never enjoyed myself
so much in my whole life.

969
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,860
Lord,

970
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,180
are you sure you're
not laughing at me?

971
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,700
It all seems far too easy.

972
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:12,700
It is a Bishop's
duty to pass judgment,

973
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,060
to interpret,

974
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,580
to consecrate,

975
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,060
to ordain,

976
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,340
to offer sacrifice,

977
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,220
to baptize and to confirm.

978
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,260
Let us pray beloved Brother,

979
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,820
let the goodness
of Almighty God

980
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,020
providing for the
well-being of his church,

981
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,860
may bestow upon
this Bishop elect,

982
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,820
the abundance of his grace

983
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,340
through Christ our Lord,

984
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,380
Amen.

985
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,460
May these hands be anointed

986
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,940
with hallowed oil,

987
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,940
with the chrism
that sanctifies.

988
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,060
Even as Samuel
anointed David,

989
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,860
King and Prophet

990
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,940
so may these hands

991
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,260
be anointed and consecrated.

992
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,940
Take this ring,

993
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,380
token of the pledged word.

994
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,260
Yours it is,

995
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,260
donned with
unshakable fidelity

996
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,020
to preserve and guard,

997
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,260
in unblemished honor

998
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,100
God's bride, the Holy Church.

999
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,180
Lord, on the head
of this Bishop

1000
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,380
and champion of thine,

1001
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,020
I put the helmet of
defense and salvation

1002
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,780
that with forehead
thus adorned,

1003
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,700
head armed with the horns
of both testaments,

1004
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,780
he may appear fearsome

1005
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,060
to the enemies of truth.

1006
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,220
His Grace, will
receive you here.

1007
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,940
It isn't every day
that a Saxon monk

1008
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,660
has an audience
with an Archbishop.

1009
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,820
Open your eyes.

1010
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,820
You'll kiss his ring

1011
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,860
and show respect to His Grace,

1012
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,460
or you'll get my
foot on your backside.

1013
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,700
You're welcome to Canterbury.

1014
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,700
Kneel to His Grace.

1015
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,580
I see our young Brother
is quite unchanged.

1016
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,380
Has he been
troublesome to his Abbott?

1017
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,740
Stubborn as a mule, My Lord.

1018
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,060
Father Abbott tried kindness,

1019
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,340
but in the end
had to have recourse

1020
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,820
to bread and water,
even to the whip.

1021
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,260
Nothing has any effect.

1022
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,940
Except for a good
kick in the rump

1023
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,300
if Your Grace will
pardon the expression.

1024
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,900
Stand up straight.

1025
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,060
Pay attention to your Brother.

1026
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,660
As a rule, the sin of
pride stiffens a man's back.

1027
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,780
Look me in the face.

1028
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,140
Look me in the face.

1029
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,500
Now,

1030
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:42,860
what do you have
to say for yourself?

1031
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,740
I see.

1032
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,300
Now Brothers, we
relieve you for the day

1033
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,900
from your rule of abstinence.

1034
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,740
Go to our kitchen
before you depart

1035
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:54,180
and I hope you'll do
justice to our cuisine.

1036
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,660
And this one?

1037
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,300
We will keep him here with us.

1038
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,860
He's vicious, Your Grace?

1039
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,580
We are not afraid.

1040
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,980
Well, now,

1041
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,740
wouldn't you rather
have a Saxon Archbishop

1042
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,380
than a Norman one?

1043
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,740
I hope I won't
regret sending for you.

1044
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,820
Why did you?

1045
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,660
I'm not sure.

1046
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,380
Perhaps in a young,
intemperate way,

1047
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,380
yours is a voice that
is good for me to hear.

1048
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,200
Then why...

1049
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,100
But please, not too often

1050
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,860
and not too loud Brother John.

1051
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:30,060
You betrayed your Saxon race,

1052
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,900
now you betray God.

1053
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,860
Perhaps you will succeed
in teaching me humility,

1054
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,700
it's a virtue I've
never really mastered.

1055
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,180
Enter.

1056
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,660
Your Grace, Bishop Folliot
has just arrived from London,

1057
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,540
he wishes to speak
to you urgently.

1058
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,060
Well, My Lord
Bishop, what is it?

1059
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,300
But, Your Grace?

1060
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,380
You may speak freely,

1061
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,500
Brother John is
in our confidence.

1062
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,700
What is it?

1063
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,900
Your Grace, I have a most
serious matter to report,

1064
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,180
which requires your
immediate intervention.

1065
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,180
Proceed.

1066
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,820
A parish priest in
Lord Gilbert's domain,

1067
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,140
who is accused of
debauching a young girl,

1068
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,820
has been seized by
His Lordships soldiers

1069
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,220
and dragged before
the civil courts.

1070
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,220
Is the priest guilty?

1071
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,340
That is immaterial.

1072
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,900
As a consecrated
minister of God

1073
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,060
he can only be tried

1074
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,460
by our ecclesiastical courts.

1075
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:23,740
You must demand his release

1076
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,660
into church
custody immediately.

1077
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,580
The principle is a vital one.

1078
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,340
Does the King know of this?

1079
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,740
He knows, but he
turns a deaf ear.

1080
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,580
Lord Gilbert is his friend.

1081
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,940
I'm also a friend
of King Henry's.

1082
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,660
As Chancellor
you are his friend.

1083
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,780
But I wear the miter now.

1084
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,020
You also wear the
great seal of England

1085
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,100
and I warned you,

1086
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,380
you could never
do so honorably.

1087
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,860
It is fortunate that I do.

1088
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,660
I will plead our
case to the King.

1089
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,820
I did not come here to
ask you to plead a case.

1090
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,860
I'm asking you to
defend a principle

1091
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,340
and you'd better do so
quickly, Your Grace.

1092
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,700
Thank you for your warning.

1093
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,180
We appreciate your
efforts to chart the course

1094
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,060
you would naturally
have followed

1095
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,180
had you become Archbishop.

1096
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,420
At least, Your Grace,

1097
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,860
I could never
have been accused

1098
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,380
of divided loyalties.

1099
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,940
Should I go now?

1100
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,140
Can I go?

1101
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,500
No.

1102
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,340
See who's outside.

1103
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,940
This is
Brother Philip, Your Grace.

1104
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,620
He's come with a message
for the Bishop of London.

1105
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,700
I told him he just left

1106
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,060
but now he
insists on seeing you.

1107
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,620
Your Grace,

1108
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,060
I wouldn't have dreamed
of disturbing you but...

1109
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,060
It's you who are
disturbed, Brother Philip.

1110
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,580
What is it?

1111
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,540
I believe My Lord Bishop
of London came to you

1112
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,180
to demand the custody
of the accused priest.

1113
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,860
Yes.

1114
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,260
The priest is dead.

1115
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,420
Dead?

1116
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,060
Yes.

1117
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,140
He tried to escape

1118
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,900
but Lord Gilbert's
soldiers caught him

1119
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,900
and in the presence of
his Lordship, killed him.

1120
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,980
Thank you, Brother Philip,

1121
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,780
you may retire.

1122
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,100
Leave us now, Brother John.

1123
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,700
My Lord Jesus,

1124
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:32,140
I find it difficult
to talk to you.

1125
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,420
What can I say?

1126
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
I, who have
turned away from you

1127
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:43,260
so often with indifference

1128
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,620
I have been
a stranger to prayer,

1129
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,260
undeserving of your friendship

1130
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,020
and your love.

1131
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,540
I've been without honor

1132
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:56,860
and feel unworthy.

1133
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,740
I am a weak and
shallow creature,

1134
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,100
clever in only
in the second rate

1135
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:05,140
and woridly arts seeking
my comfort and pleasure.

1136
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,660
I gave my love,

1137
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,860
such as it was elsewhere,

1138
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,700
putting service
to my earthly king

1139
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,220
before my duty to you.

1140
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,940
But now,

1141
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,460
they have made me
the shepherd of your flock

1142
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,700
and guardian of your church.

1143
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,820
Please, Lord, teach me now

1144
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,060
how to serve you
with all my heart,

1145
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,020
to know at last
what it really is to love,

1146
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,180
to adore.

1147
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,940
So that I may
worthily administer

1148
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,420
your kingdom here upon earth

1149
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,580
and find my true honor

1150
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,020
in observing your divine will.

1151
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,180
Please, Lord,

1152
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,340
make me worthy.

1153
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,340
You are a creature
of extremes,

1154
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,860
aren't you, Brother John.

1155
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,100
Get up.

1156
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,420
Forgive me.

1157
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,220
I didn't know,

1158
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,460
I never realized.

1159
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,980
Nor did I.

1160
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,780
Get up.

1161
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,420
You were very good at
admonishing an Archbishop.

1162
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,380
Do you think you
could talk to a king?

1163
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,780
Yes.

1164
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,180
Good.

1165
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,940
Then you will
memorize what I write.

1166
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,220
Henry?

1167
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,020
Henry?

1168
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,500
What is it mother?

1169
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,620
Why do you keep
gazing out of the window?

1170
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,860
Becket won't come you know,

1171
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,900
he's much too busy

1172
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,660
giving money to the poor

1173
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,820
and fitting
sandals on beggars.

1174
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,580
I never liked him
as an adventurer,

1175
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,860
but now that he puts
on the airs of a saint,

1176
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,220
he certainly keeps himself

1177
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,620
in splendid isolation

1178
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,300
since you made
him Archbishop.

1179
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,180
He's in retreat.

1180
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,500
It's part of the ritual.

1181
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,780
Anyway, I don't need

1182
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,100
to be reassured
by his presence.

1183
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,580
He's my friend.

1184
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,900
More is the pity.

1185
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,740
He has a strange way
of showing gratitude.

1186
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,860
Your friend,

1187
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,100
you mean you went to
the whorehouses together.

1188
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,660
It was he who lured you away

1189
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,380
from the duties
you owed to me.

1190
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:56,780
Madam,
in matters of debauchery

1191
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:59,020
it was I who lured him

1192
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,060
and I didn't need
anyone to lure me

1193
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,980
away from the
duties I owe you.

1194
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,700
I made you four children
very conscientiously,

1195
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,340
thank the Lord
my duty is done.

1196
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,180
I pray heaven he
stays away from you.

1197
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,140
When you realize
how he has used you,

1198
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,340
you may appreciate the
joys of family life again.

1199
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,580
The joys of family life
are limited, madam,

1200
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:25,180
to be perfectly
frank, you bore me,

1201
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,980
you and your
everlasting backbiting.

1202
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:27,940
Stop this.

1203
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,940
And this eternal
tatting of yours.

1204
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,340
In God's name how long does
it take to make a tapestry

1205
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,260
and it's mediocre
beyond belief.

1206
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,780
One performs
according to one's gifts.

1207
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,420
Yes.

1208
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,540
Shut up, the lot of you!

1209
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,660
Which one are you?

1210
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,780
Henry the III.

1211
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,540
Not yet, sir,

1212
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,980
number two is in
the best of health.

1213
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:12,260
A fine way you bring up
your children, madam.

1214
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,980
Do you see yourself
as regent already?

1215
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,660
No wonder I shun your bed,

1216
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:21,060
it's not amusing to make
love to one's own widow.

1217
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,620
Who's that?

1218
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,540
A messenger

1219
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,260
from Canterbury

1220
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,300
if you can spare the time
from bullying your children.

1221
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,820
Messenger?

1222
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,020
Is your master ill?

1223
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,500
No, Your Highness,

1224
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,140
I have a message
from His Grace.

1225
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,340
A message?

1226
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,020
These are Becket's words.

1227
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:49,140
"Whereas men at arms
of the Lord Gilbert

1228
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,380
under his orders
and in his presence

1229
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,140
have seized and killed
a priest of the church,

1230
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,420
I Becket,

1231
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
Archbishop of Canterbury,

1232
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,300
Primate of England,

1233
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,620
do now ask that Your Highness

1234
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,100
in accordance with
the law of the Realm

1235
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,100
apprehend Lord Gilbert

1236
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,860
and charge him with
the crime of murder."

1237
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,500
Well, my son,

1238
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,140
now you have heard
from your friend.

1239
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,300
Get out!

1240
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:20,100
Get out, both of you!

1241
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,540
Take your royal
vermin with you!

1242
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,740
Your Highness,

1243
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,780
is there a reply
for the Archbishop?

1244
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,060
Your Grace.

1245
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:46,900
Yes?

1246
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,460
The King is here.

1247
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,260
Are you certain?

1248
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,940
He came mounted and alone,

1249
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,020
but I'm sure it's he.

1250
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,340
My Prince.

1251
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,900
Why did you send a messenger?

1252
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,580
Canterbury's only
five hours from London.

1253
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,260
I've just ridden it in four,

1254
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,340
I'm frozen stiff.

1255
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,300
Would you like some wine?

1256
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,300
No.

1257
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,780
Give me a reason.

1258
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,860
Why did you send a messenger?

1259
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:28,140
What answer did you give him?

1260
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:31,420
You've arrived
here before he has.

1261
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:36,460
I detect ill,
devious Becket here.

1262
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,140
What game are
you playing, Thomas?

1263
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:45,980
No game, My Prince.

1264
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,420
Lord Gilbert
murdered a priest.

1265
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,900
I want the guilty punished.

1266
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,060
The guilty of what?

1267
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,060
This priest was
a scandal to his parish.

1268
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,620
That was never proved.

1269
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,900
Gilbert should've
handed the accused

1270
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,420
over to the church
for process of law.

1271
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,460
If guilty, we would have
determined his punishment.

1272
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,180
I am the law.

1273
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,340
Gilbert will recourse to me,

1274
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,100
I gave him leave
to arrest this priest.

1275
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,540
I can't allow any of my clergy

1276
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,620
to be thrown into prison

1277
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,820
and tried by the
civil authorities.

1278
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,980
Neither can I stand by

1279
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,740
and let my
priests be murdered.

1280
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,140
You?

1281
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,220
You can't allow?

1282
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,260
You can't stand by?

1283
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,740
Are you taking yourself
seriously as Archbishop?

1284
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,020
I am the
Archbishop, My Prince.

1285
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,300
By my grace.

1286
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,380
Are you demented,
you're Chancellor of England,

1287
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,860
you're mine.

1288
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,220
I'm also the Archbishop

1289
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,580
and you have introduced
me to deeper obligations.

1290
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,860
And if I won't charge Gilbert?

1291
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,420
I can't force you,

1292
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,940
but there is always
a final judgment

1293
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,660
beyond the King's justice.

1294
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,860
Oh that, Lord Gilbert
will face his fate

1295
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:57,580
on the day of judgment,
as we all will.

1296
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,820
I'm sure he'll have a
great deal more to answer for

1297
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,220
than killing
a felonious priest.

1298
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,420
Lord Gilbert will
come to that judgment

1299
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,100
already damned, Sire.

1300
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:09,020
I intend to excommunicate him.

1301
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,180
You are demented.

1302
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,260
Don't you understand

1303
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,780
that when you attack
my nobles, you attack me,

1304
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,500
and when you attack me,
you attack England!

1305
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,100
There is more to
England than the crown.

1306
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,140
You must learn to face
that eventually, My Prince.

1307
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,340
Damn you, don't lecture me!

1308
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,940
You once told me

1309
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,260
you didn't know what honor
was, and I laughed at you.

1310
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,540
But now to betray me,

1311
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,980
to challenge my power.

1312
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,860
I do not seek
power, My Prince.

1313
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,460
It is only that
I finally discovered

1314
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,420
a real honor to defend.

1315
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,500
Whose honor?

1316
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:45,340
Whose honor is
greater than the King's?

1317
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,740
The honor of God.

1318
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,620
Forgive me.

1319
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,580
Hmm,

1320
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,180
you give the lions
of England back to me,

1321
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:24,620
like a little boy who
doesn't want to play anymore.

1322
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,500
I would have gone to war

1323
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,380
with all England's
might behind me

1324
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,100
and even against
England's interest

1325
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,620
to defend you, Thomas.

1326
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,260
I would have
given away my life

1327
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,660
laughingly for you,

1328
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,819
only I loved you

1329
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,420
and you didn't love me

1330
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,180
that's the difference.

1331
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,380
Stay away.

1332
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:54,900
But thank you for this
last gift as you desert me.

1333
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,300
Now I shall learn to be alone.

1334
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,700
Bishop.

1335
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,500
What do you want, Philip?

1336
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,980
Your Majesty,

1337
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,100
alone without an escort?

1338
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,500
The King nevertheless.

1339
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,940
Bishop, I wish to confess.

1340
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:04,020
The King has
his own confessor.

1341
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,380
It is an important
court prerogative.

1342
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,900
Don't be nervous, Bishop.

1343
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,460
I'm not asking for absolution.

1344
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,780
I have something far worse

1345
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,100
than a sin on my conscience.

1346
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:17,020
A mistake,

1347
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:20,020
a crass mistake.

1348
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,540
I ordered you
to vote for Becket

1349
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:24,060
in the election at Canterbury.

1350
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:25,660
I repent of it.

1351
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,700
I bowed beneath
the royal hand.

1352
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,140
Very reluctantly, I know.

1353
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:31,620
I'm told this compromise
with your conscience

1354
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,180
made you seriously
ill afterwards.

1355
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,540
God cured me.

1356
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,220
Very good of him.

1357
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,660
You wear his uniform
and have his ear.

1358
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,060
He's let me fall ill

1359
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,140
without lifting a finger

1360
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,300
and I must cure myself.

1361
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,340
I did not know of this...

1362
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:50,740
I have the
Archbishop on my stomach,

1363
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,940
a big, hard lump

1364
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,500
I shall have to vomit back.

1365
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,060
I think you are a man
one can talk to, Bishop.

1366
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,780
I believe I misjudged you,

1367
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,540
friendship blinded me.

1368
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:03,900
Is the King's friendship

1369
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,940
for Thomas Becket
dead, Your Highness?

1370
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,700
Yes, Bishop,
it died quite suddenly,

1371
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,460
a sort of heart failure.

1372
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,780
A curious phenomenon,
Your Highness,

1373
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,300
but quite frequent.

1374
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:16,420
I hate Becket now.

1375
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,140
I hate him,

1376
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,180
as much as you
are jealous of him.

1377
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,980
He's like an animal
tearing my guts,

1378
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,420
I can't bear it anymore.

1379
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,500
I shall have to
turn it loose on him.

1380
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:30,740
But I am the King

1381
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:34,060
and my office
stands in my way.

1382
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,980
I need someone to help me.

1383
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,940
My only interest
is for the church.

1384
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,780
Oh, come, Bishop.

1385
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,820
We're alone and
the church is empty.

1386
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,300
The church is never empty.

1387
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,500
The little red lamp
burns in the chapel

1388
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:52,740
signifying God's presence
in the tabernacle.

1389
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:56,500
Do you take me for one of
your sheep, Holy Pastor?

1390
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,700
I like playing games,

1391
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,620
but only with
boys of my own age.

1392
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,260
The one for whom that
little red lamp burns

1393
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,020
has seen into
your innermost heart

1394
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,740
and mine a long time ago.

1395
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,580
Of my hatred
of Thomas Becket

1396
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,140
and your envy of him,

1397
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,900
he knows all there is to know.

1398
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,580
Strange, I'd always
taken Your Highness,

1399
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,020
for a perennial adolescent

1400
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,740
who cared only
for his pleasures.

1401
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,460
One can be wrong
about people, Bishop,

1402
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,820
I made the same mistake.

1403
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,580
Now, if it could be proved

1404
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,180
that Becket had committed some

1405
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,300
gross impropriety
as Chancellor,

1406
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:34,380
say embezzlement,

1407
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,340
what would the church do?

1408
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,300
If that were established,

1409
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,140
I say if,

1410
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,460
the Bishops could
legally dissolve

1411
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,900
their allegiance to him

1412
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,460
pending their
report to the pope.

1413
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:46,660
And beyond that?

1414
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,900
You,

1415
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,860
you would go beyond that?

1416
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,900
The whole way.

1417
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:53,340
In his guilt,

1418
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,180
if he were found guilty,

1419
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:58,340
he would then be
charged under canon law.

1420
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,380
And the penalty?

1421
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,860
That would be for
Your Majesty to decide.

1422
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,340
Thomas.

1423
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,380
You love him don't you?

1424
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:07,700
You still love him.

1425
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,140
That impostor,
that Saxon guttersnipe,

1426
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:12,260
that mitered hog.

1427
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:15,260
Hold your tongue, Priest.

1428
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,060
All I confided to you

1429
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,980
was my hate, not my love.

1430
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,220
For England's sake,

1431
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,020
you'll help me get rid of him,

1432
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,020
but don't ever
insult him to my face.

1433
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,420
He will be accused,

1434
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,260
and you will play
your proper part.

1435
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:40,740
According to law.

1436
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:44,060
I would spit,

1437
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,580
if I were not
in God's house.

1438
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:05,940
My Brothers,

1439
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:06,940
as you have been told

1440
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:10,220
your presence
here is voluntary.

1441
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,500
If any of you have
second thoughts

1442
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,460
you may retire now.

1443
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,260
Thank you for attending.

1444
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,020
Good day, My Lords.

1445
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,620
I did not expect to
see you at Canterbury.

1446
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,780
Do you still disagree
with my decision?

1447
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:53,860
Your Grace, can nothing
persuade you to delay?

1448
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,100
Oh, yes, the King's
arrest of Lord Gilbert

1449
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,540
on the charge of
sacrilegious murder.

1450
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,860
There will be an arrest

1451
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,580
but not Lord Gilbert's.

1452
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,940
The sheriff of London
is waiting in the sacristy.

1453
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,140
He has orders to summon you

1454
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,860
before the King's
grand justicer,

1455
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,460
the instant you pronounce
the excommunication.

1456
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,620
How curious, on what charge?

1457
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,820
Embezzlement.

1458
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,020
The King finds that there are

1459
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,020
large sums of money
missing from the treasury

1460
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,620
during your
administration as Chancellor?

1461
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:20,820
How much?

1462
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,820
Forty thousand
pounds in fine gold.

1463
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,260
There was never that much
gold in the whole treasury.

1464
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,140
I beg of you do not do this.

1465
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,340
You will strike a blow

1466
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,100
that will split church
and state for a generation.

1467
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,220
If I do not strike it now

1468
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,540
the church as we know it

1469
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,620
will not survive a generation.

1470
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,580
God will see that it survives.

1471
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,740
No, the Kingdom of
God must be defended

1472
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,700
like any other Kingdom.

1473
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,140
Gentlemen,

1474
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,580
it is a supreme irony

1475
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,460
that the woridly Becket,

1476
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,660
the profligate and libertine

1477
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:57,500
should find himself

1478
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,580
standing here at this moment.

1479
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,580
But here he is

1480
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,900
in spite of himself.

1481
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:07,500
But the King for good or ill,

1482
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:10,300
chose to pass the burden
of the church onto me

1483
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,060
and now I must carry it.

1484
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,260
I've rolled up my sleeves,

1485
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,860
and taken the
church on my back.

1486
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:23,260
Nothing will ever make
me set it down again.

1487
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:26,660
Now, Lords,

1488
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,860
if you will forgive me.

1489
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,180
Lord Gilbert,

1490
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:08,140
Baron of England, by
the grace of His Majesty,

1491
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,220
King Henry the II,

1492
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:11,820
seized upon the
person of a priest

1493
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,300
of the holy church

1494
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:15,820
and unlawfully did
hold him in custody.

1495
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,300
Furthermore,

1496
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,020
in the presence
of Lord Gilbert

1497
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,740
and by his command,

1498
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,340
his men seized
upon this priest

1499
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,060
when he tried to escape

1500
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,140
and put him to death.

1501
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:29,900
This is the sin of
murder and sacrilege.

1502
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:31,140
In that,

1503
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,500
Lord Gilbert has rendered

1504
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,460
no act of contrition
or repentance

1505
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:37,060
and is at the moment
at liberty in the land,

1506
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:39,620
we do here and
now separate him

1507
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,820
from the precious body
and blood of Christ

1508
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,540
and from the society
of all Christians.

1509
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,580
We exclude him from
our Holy Mother Church

1510
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,220
and all her sacraments

1511
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,460
in heaven, or on earth.

1512
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:56,140
We declare him excommunicate

1513
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,900
and anathema.

1514
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:01,260
We cast him into
the outer darkness,

1515
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:04,300
we judge him
damned with the devil

1516
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,100
and his fallen angels

1517
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,180
and all the reprobate

1518
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,020
to eternal fire

1519
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,900
and everlasting pain.

1520
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,900
So be it.

1521
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,020
As the Lord
Sheriff of London,

1522
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,260
I'm commanded to summon you,

1523
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,340
Thomas Becket,
to the King's court

1524
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,780
on the charges
herein set forth,

1525
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,020
stamped with the King's seal.

1526
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:39,420
I Robert de Beaumont,

1527
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,300
Duke of Leicester,

1528
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:44,180
Grand Justicer of the Realm,

1529
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:45,900
do now summon Thomas Becket

1530
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,740
to this court of law,

1531
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:50,380
for the third and last time.

1532
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,100
Thomas Becket, step forward.

1533
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,740
He's doomed, isn't he?

1534
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,060
Yes.

1535
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,740
At last.

1536
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:12,820
I forbid you to gloat.

1537
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:15,220
At seeing your enemy perish.

1538
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,860
Why not?

1539
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:19,460
Becket is my enemy

1540
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,620
but in the human balance

1541
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,980
traitor that he is

1542
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,620
and naked as
his mother made him,

1543
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,580
he's worth 100 of you madam,

1544
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,420
with your crown
and your jewels

1545
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,180
and your august uncle the
emperor into the bargain.

1546
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:33,700
I'm forced to fight
him now and crush him

1547
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,900
but at least he gave
me with open hands

1548
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,300
everything that is
at all good in me,

1549
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,660
and you have never
given me anything

1550
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,340
but your coping mediocrity

1551
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,820
and your everlasting obsession

1552
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:44,220
with your puny little person

1553
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,660
and what you
thought was due to it!

1554
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,980
That's why
I forbid you to smile

1555
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:51,180
while Becket
is being destroyed!

1556
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,860
I gave you my youth,

1557
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,980
I gave you your children.

1558
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:56,980
I don't like my children!

1559
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:59,420
And as for your youth,

1560
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:01,860
that withered flower

1561
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,820
pressed between the
pages of a hymn book

1562
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,340
since you were 12 years old

1563
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,660
with its watery blood

1564
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,900
and stale insipid scent,

1565
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:12,780
you can bid farewell
to that without a tear.

1566
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:15,380
Your body was an
empty desert, Madame,

1567
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:18,380
which duty forced
me to wander in alone.

1568
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,980
But you have never
been a wife to me,

1569
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,300
and Becket was my friend,

1570
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,700
red blooded,

1571
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:27,340
generous and full of strength.

1572
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,460
Oh, my Thomas.

1573
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,580
And I?

1574
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:33,620
I have given you
nothing I suppose?

1575
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,300
Life, yes.

1576
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,060
Thank you.

1577
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,580
But after that
I never saw you

1578
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:44,700
except in a passageway
on your way to a ball,

1579
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,820
or in your crown
and ermine mantle

1580
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,460
10 minutes before
official ceremonies

1581
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:51,460
when you were forced
to tolerate my presence.

1582
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:56,340
No! No one on this earth has
ever loved me except Becket!

1583
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:57,660
Call him back then,

1584
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,620
absolve him if he loves you,

1585
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,460
give him back his power,

1586
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,500
but do something.

1587
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,980
I am.

1588
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,020
I'm learning to be alone.

1589
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,580
By the authority granted me,

1590
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,980
I, Robert de Beaumont,

1591
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,580
servant of the crown,

1592
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,060
do now before this council,

1593
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:00,500
charge Thomas Becket
with the crimes of...

1594
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:04,180
Robert.

1595
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:05,460
I charge you, Thomas Becket...

1596
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,660
Robert de Beaumont,

1597
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,580
hear me for the
sake of your soul,

1598
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:11,740
which is in
the gravest danger.

1599
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:12,940
All in this assembly

1600
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,580
know how faithfully I've
served My Lord the King.

1601
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,980
It was he who willed
that I be Archbishop

1602
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:21,580
and it was for love of
him alone that I accepted.

1603
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,700
I am innocent
of any wrongdoing

1604
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:24,900
in my administration

1605
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,540
of the King's treasury
as Chancellor,

1606
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,260
or at any other time.

1607
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:32,140
I therefore refuse to plea
to these trumped up charges.

1608
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:33,860
I will be judged

1609
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:35,900
by the Pope alone,

1610
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,180
to whom before you all

1611
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,820
I now appeal and place myself

1612
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,060
and my church
under his protection.

1613
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,340
As head of the
Church of England

1614
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,900
and as your spiritual father,

1615
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,940
I forbid you to
pass judgment on me.

1616
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,660
I command you

1617
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,780
and all who would charge
me to hold your peace

1618
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,900
on pain of endangering

1619
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,140
your immortal souls.

1620
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,940
Well played, Thomas.

1621
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,180
Do you think you can

1622
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:20,620
carry this off
indefinitely you fool?

1623
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,380
We are all God's
fools, My Lord.

1624
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,500
Becket,

1625
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:27,380
you are a liar!

1626
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,940
You are a traitor!

1627
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,260
Sheathe your sword Morville

1628
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,340
before you impale
your soul upon it!

1629
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,740
It's funny,

1630
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,700
it's too funny.

1631
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:59,220
He's made mincemeat of them.

1632
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:02,540
I'm surrounded by fools!

1633
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:05,020
Becket is the only
intelligent man

1634
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,940
in my kingdom
and he's against me!

1635
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,780
Your Highness,
it was impossible...

1636
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,060
Shut up,

1637
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,620
get to your feet.

1638
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,660
Did you hear him,

1639
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,220
he appeals to the Pope.

1640
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:24,180
If he gains the
Pope's ear, Bishop,

1641
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,660
we may find the
entire kingdom

1642
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,420
under Papal interdict.

1643
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
I could be
excommunicated myself.

1644
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:30,860
But, Your Highness,
I do not think that...

1645
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:35,700
I want no more thinking!

1646
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:39,060
Becket must not
cross the channel.

1647
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,100
King Louis of France

1648
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:42,820
would be the first to
help him get to the Pope.

1649
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:46,140
The Archbishop must not
leave England, see to it.

1650
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:50,020
From now on, Bishop,

1651
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,060
it is total war.

1652
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,100
Psssst...

1653
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,540
My French Knight

1654
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,780
takes your English Bishop.

1655
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,340
Your Majesty's adroit.

1656
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,100
Pardon, Sire.

1657
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:40,500
To snug.

1658
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:44,900
Why do all tailors want
to strangle one's armpits?

1659
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:47,860
Your Majesty, the English
ambassador's extraordinary

1660
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,100
insist that I convey
their compliments.

1661
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,540
They've already done that.

1662
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:53,660
I'll see them when I'm ready,

1663
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,420
that's my job.

1664
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:57,220
They wish respectfully Sire,

1665
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,860
to call your
attention to the fact

1666
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:00,860
that they have been
waiting for three days.

1667
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:02,780
Let them wait,
that's their job.

1668
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:05,220
Ambassadors are paid to
pace about in anterooms

1669
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,420
especially in these
times of uneasy peace.

1670
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,780
But they have an
urgent communication

1671
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,460
from Henry of England, Sire.

1672
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,820
The King of England
and his ambassadors

1673
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,300
can drown themselves
in what they are

1674
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:16,500
impertinent enough to
call their English channel.

1675
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:19,060
But, Your Majesty, the
extradition of a criminal

1676
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:20,340
is a courtesy due

1677
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,380
from one crowned
head to another.

1678
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,100
My dear man,
crowned heads are free

1679
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:25,860
to play a little
game of courtesy,

1680
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:29,220
but nations owe
one another none.

1681
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:31,260
Oh.

1682
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,620
All right, show them
in, show them in.

1683
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,540
No, you may stay.

1684
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,900
The ambassadors can
share our attention

1685
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:39,420
with our tailor.

1686
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,060
It will demonstrate
to the English

1687
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:43,860
that exact social
status of our court.

1688
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:48,060
May I be permitted to
present to, Your Majesty,

1689
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:49,860
the two envoys extraordinary

1690
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:52,100
from His Highness,
Henry of England,

1691
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,940
His Grace,
the Bishop of London

1692
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:56,380
and Robert de Beaumont,
Duke of Leicester.

1693
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:58,140
Welcome My Lords.

1694
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,180
Fresh from England?

1695
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,460
How is our good King Henry?

1696
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:03,660
He was well, Your Majesty,

1697
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,820
when we left him
two weeks ago.

1698
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:09,100
Two weeks to cross
the channel, gentlemen?

1699
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:12,660
We have been waiting upon
Your Majesty, for three days.

1700
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,820
Why was I not informed?

1701
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:15,940
Girot.

1702
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,420
Your Majesty?

1703
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,220
See what I have
to contend with.

1704
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,060
But perhaps I can
make it up to you.

1705
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,660
Would you permit
me to furnish you

1706
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:23,740
with some French garments

1707
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,340
made by our craftsmen here,

1708
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,020
it will only take two weeks?

1709
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,740
We thank, Your Majesty,

1710
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,740
but we have urgent
business in Rome.

1711
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,580
Too bad.

1712
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:36,260
Well, is there anything
else I can do for you?

1713
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,500
I wish to deliver a message

1714
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,140
from Henry, King of England

1715
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:42,100
to his friend Louis,
King of the French.

1716
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,299
We are all ears.

1717
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:44,220
He wishes you to know...

1718
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,620
Oh, just one moment.

1719
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,420
Yes, do continue.

1720
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,340
He wishes you to know
that Thomas Becket,

1721
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,980
Archbishop of Canterbury,

1722
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,860
has been found
guilty of treason

1723
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,180
and has forthwith
fled his kingdom.

1724
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:59,580
He therefore entreats you

1725
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:01,100
not to allow this criminal

1726
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,460
to reside within
your territories,

1727
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,460
nor to permit
any of your vassals

1728
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:08,220
to give counsel
or support to him.

1729
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:10,460
He solemnly declares
that your enemies

1730
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,580
would receive none from him,

1731
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,660
nor from his subjects.

1732
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:16,460
Henry, King of England,

1733
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,300
Duke of Normandy.

1734
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:24,180
Gentlemen, we have
listened most attentively

1735
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,300
to your sovereign's
gracious request,

1736
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,140
and we shall
shortly be drafting

1737
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:30,540
a formal reply to it.

1738
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:31,700
In the meantime, however,

1739
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:33,780
we can only express
our astonishment.

1740
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,260
No news has reached us

1741
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,580
of the Archbishop
of Canterbury's

1742
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:37,900
presence in our domains.

1743
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,260
But Sire, we have word

1744
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,980
that he is in your domains.

1745
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:43,740
He's taken refuge in
the Abbey of San Martin

1746
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:45,260
My Lord Bishop,
we flatter ourselves

1747
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,900
there is some
order in our kingdom.

1748
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,980
If he were there,

1749
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,780
we should most certainly
had been informed.

1750
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,700
Bring in Thomas Becket.

1751
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:29,020
Rise, Thomas Becket,

1752
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,780
and greet us as the
Primate of England.

1753
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:32,260
The bow would've been enough

1754
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:33,460
and if I know my etiquette

1755
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:34,820
you were entitled to

1756
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,140
a slight nod of
the head from me.

1757
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:39,820
That's done.

1758
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:41,420
I might also be
required to kiss the ring

1759
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,300
if this visit
were an official one

1760
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,140
but I am under the
impression that isn't.

1761
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,740
No, Sire.

1762
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:48,220
I'm on an exile.

1763
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,620
That too is an
important title in France.

1764
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:53,340
I'm told you are
a dangerous one.

1765
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,460
I'm afraid so, Sire.

1766
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:55,340
How delightful,

1767
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,220
shall we discuss
it in private.

1768
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:01,660
We enjoy danger Becket,

1769
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,420
it keeps us alive.

1770
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:04,700
Do you value candor?

1771
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:05,620
I do, Sire.

1772
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,220
Then let me tell you that
were you a French official

1773
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:09,180
I might have kept you
into prison myself.

1774
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,180
For the moment, however,

1775
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:12,580
we are pleased to grant
you our royal protection.

1776
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:13,980
I humbly thank
you, Your Majesty,

1777
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,100
but I'm bound to tell you

1778
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,380
that I cannot buy your favor

1779
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,380
with any act
hostile to my country.

1780
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:21,860
You do us an injustice,
that was understood.

1781
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:23,420
I believe that in
the past however,

1782
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,180
you have been no stranger

1783
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:28,380
to the art of
political maneuver.

1784
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:29,620
That is true, Sire.

1785
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,020
Well, speaking frankly,

1786
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:34,260
you suit our purpose
in our chess game.

1787
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:36,220
England is splitting
into the Henry camp

1788
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:37,780
and the Becket camp

1789
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:40,220
and that suits us admittible.

1790
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,580
We ask nothing further of you,

1791
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:45,540
but, there is always a but,

1792
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:46,940
as I'm sure you are aware?

1793
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,060
I am aware.

1794
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:50,860
I am responsible only for
France's interest, Becket.

1795
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,860
Unfortunately, I cannot
afford to shoulder

1796
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:55,180
those of heaven as well.

1797
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,380
For the moment it suits me

1798
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,540
to shelter any fugitive
from Henry's court.

1799
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:01,300
His recent impertinence
in claiming and capturing

1800
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:02,700
some of our frontier towns

1801
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,500
must be well known
to you, Thomas,

1802
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,300
since you more than
distinguished yourself

1803
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,540
in several of
these engagements?

1804
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:11,020
In a month or so, however,

1805
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,300
my dealings with Henry

1806
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,340
may require a
different tactic.

1807
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:15,860
I might even be obliged

1808
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:18,500
to ask you to leave France.

1809
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:20,660
I hope to have a solution
to such a dilemma.

1810
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:21,940
Oh?

1811
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,940
I intend to go onto Rome

1812
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:26,460
to put my case
before the Holy Father,

1813
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,340
if you will give
me safe conduct.

1814
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,060
You shall have it, of course,

1815
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:31,900
you're the ideal guest.

1816
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,020
But might I be permitted
to give you a word of advice.

1817
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,220
I would appreciate it.

1818
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:36,900
The Pope is a most holy man,

1819
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:38,820
but like so many
lofty personages

1820
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,140
he is surrounded by men

1821
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,940
of a somewhat inferior stamp.

1822
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,740
They need money

1823
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:47,900
and King Henry might
be willing to provide it.

1824
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:52,900
Keep your eyes open.

1825
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,060
I will.

1826
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:57,060
But permit me to
show you my aviary.

1827
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:17,380
That man Becket smacks
of too much sincerity.

1828
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:19,660
A practice that is
most disconcerting.

1829
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,740
Fiddlesticks.

1830
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,300
Sincerity is a
form of strategy

1831
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,500
just like any other.

1832
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,220
In a pinch I have been
known to use it myself.

1833
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,860
The trouble is,
if your opponent starts

1834
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:30,500
being sincere at the
same time you do,

1835
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:32,660
then the game becomes
horribly confusing.

1836
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,260
Shh.

1837
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,300
I assure you, Your Holiness,

1838
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,820
it's a simple matter.

1839
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:10,380
No, no, no, Zambelli,

1840
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,900
I don't agree,

1841
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:13,660
it is impossible.

1842
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:16,580
If we take the money
from King Henry,

1843
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:19,980
I cannot possibly
receive Becket.

1844
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:23,020
Receive the money from
the King, very Holy Father,

1845
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:25,180
and receive the
Archbishop too.

1846
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,540
The one will
neutralize the other.

1847
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,020
You know what they say,

1848
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,260
Becket is going to ask me?

1849
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,860
No, Holy Father.

1850
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:36,180
Zambelli, don't play
the fox with me.

1851
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,300
It was you who told me.

1852
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:39,700
I beg your pardon,
Holy Father.

1853
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:41,020
I had forgotten,

1854
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,220
or rather as Your Holiness
asked me the question

1855
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,380
I thought you had forgotten

1856
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,900
and so I took a chance and...

1857
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,339
Zambelli,

1858
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:53,940
if you start out maneuvering
yourself to no purpose,

1859
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:56,820
we'll be here all night.

1860
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:59,220
Well, bring him in.

1861
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,820
His Holiness
will receive you now.

1862
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:42,660
I'm sorry to be
importunate, Your Holiness,

1863
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:44,980
but time is running out
and my course concerns

1864
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,660
the very life of the
church in England.

1865
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,420
I know, I know,

1866
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,660
and your cause is worthy

1867
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,660
but nevertheless, Becket,

1868
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:55,660
the church must seek
to exist peacefully

1869
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:58,660
within the framework
of the state.

1870
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:00,540
I sought that with
desperation, Your Holiness.

1871
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:02,060
Precisely, Becket.

1872
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:04,580
You are new to God's service

1873
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,300
and perhaps for that reason

1874
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:09,140
you were somewhat hot headed

1875
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:12,500
and intemperate
in your methods.

1876
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:15,300
You have proved
your moral worth,

1877
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,060
but you have also split

1878
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:20,020
the church in England
into two parties

1879
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,660
and that is regrettable.

1880
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:25,780
Holy Father, I fear
this may be true

1881
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:29,620
and it has given
me much agony.

1882
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:32,420
If I'm guilty,
if my judgment was wrong,

1883
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,100
then I am most
sincerely repentant.

1884
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:38,020
unfortunately that
doesn't solve the problem.

1885
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,220
Holy Father,

1886
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,300
relieve me of the
title of Archbishop,

1887
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:47,020
let me be an ordinary priest.

1888
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,100
All right, done.

1889
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:52,420
Zambelli.

1890
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:55,620
Why do your request this?

1891
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:58,660
Then, Your Holiness, could
make a free and open decision.

1892
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,540
The protection of my position
as head of the English church

1893
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,420
may prove an embarrassment

1894
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,820
I would like to relive you of.

1895
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,460
No, that would mean

1896
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:11,100
our total surrender
to the state.

1897
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:14,500
You will maintain
your status as Archbishop

1898
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:16,820
but you will, for the present,

1899
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:22,420
maintain it in
a monastic retreat.

1900
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:26,220
Where do you wish
us to send you?

1901
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:29,700
To the Abbey of
San Martin in France.

1902
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:32,220
I ask only that
my former servant,

1903
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:35,580
Brother John
be allowed to accompany me.

1904
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,420
Of course,

1905
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:40,860
God grant you
peace, Thomas Becket.

1906
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:02,180
That man is obviously

1907
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:05,380
an abyss of ambition.

1908
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:07,100
How long a retreat?

1909
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:09,620
A very long retreat.

1910
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:11,940
I wouldn't count on it.

1911
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:15,620
Wait till he tastes
the food at the monastery.

1912
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,940
You look concerned,
Your Grace?

1913
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,380
Is something wrong?

1914
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,980
No, Brother John.

1915
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,580
You are unhappy here?

1916
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,180
No, perhaps I'm too happy.

1917
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:50,940
Can I help?

1918
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:53,740
No, only God can help.

1919
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:29,580
Lord,

1920
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:34,460
what do you
really want me to do?

1921
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:36,260
To remain here, a poor monk

1922
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:38,980
in simplicity of spirit,

1923
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:42,780
is it a path to bring
me nearer to you?

1924
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:44,580
Or is to easy a way,

1925
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:48,340
perhaps even a luxury?

1926
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:52,300
The path to holiness
in this monastery

1927
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:55,220
is too effortless.

1928
01:51:55,260 --> 01:52:01,220
I think it would be too
easy to buy you like this.

1929
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,500
Bargain price.

1930
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:10,780
It has pleased you
to make me Archbishop

1931
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:14,020
and to set me
like a solitary pawn

1932
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:17,940
face to face with the
King on the chessboard.

1933
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:19,900
I think you mean me
to defend your honor,

1934
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:20,980
peacefully if I can

1935
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:25,460
with argument
and with compromise

1936
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:27,820
and if I cannot

1937
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:30,940
then with the full
challenge of my office

1938
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:32,500
and the soaring force

1939
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:37,580
of what I know to be right.

1940
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:40,300
So,

1941
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:43,420
I shall take up
the miter again

1942
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:45,340
and the golden cope

1943
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:49,620
and the great silver cross

1944
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:52,020
and I shall go back

1945
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,380
and fight with the weapons

1946
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:55,780
it has pleased you to give me.

1947
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,260
All the rest,

1948
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:07,100
thy will be done.

1949
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,300
Look, Thomas,

1950
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,940
your King awaits you.

1951
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,020
I'm glad you weren't born

1952
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,540
on this side
of the channel, Thomas,

1953
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:38,380
you'd have been
a thorn in my side too.

1954
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,060
How did you bewitch me
into doing this for you?

1955
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:43,340
I convinced you that if
the King and I reconciled

1956
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:45,420
he will be placed
in your debt.

1957
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,460
True.

1958
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:50,260
Why does he hate you so?

1959
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:53,260
He's never forgiven me
for preferring God to him.

1960
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:56,940
Go, Thomas.

1961
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,819
You know, it's
a strange thing

1962
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:11,740
but Becket's safety has
become quite dear to me.

1963
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:40,340
You look older, Thomas.

1964
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:43,820
So do you, My Prince.

1965
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:45,140
Are you cold?

1966
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:47,540
I'm frozen stiff,

1967
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,580
chilblains are killing me.

1968
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,700
You love it of course,

1969
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,660
you're in your
element, aren't you,

1970
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,620
just that Monk's habit.

1971
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,740
I always told you
one must fight the cold

1972
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:57,340
with the cold's weapons.

1973
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,140
Strip yourself naked
every morning and...

1974
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:02,140
splash yourself with cold water.

1975
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:06,420
I used to,

1976
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,140
when you were
there to make me.

1977
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:12,260
I never wash now, I stink.

1978
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,820
How's your son?

1979
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,260
he must have come of age.

1980
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,260
He's an idiot

1981
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:18,180
and sly like his mother.

1982
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:22,020
Thomas, don't you ever marry.

1983
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,420
You took that
matter out of my hands

1984
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,620
when you had me ordained.

1985
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:26,460
If we start on that
we're sure to quarrel.

1986
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:29,220
Talk about something else.

1987
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:32,300
Very well.

1988
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:35,260
Has Your Majesty
done much hunting lately?

1989
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,620
Yes, every day.

1990
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:40,300
It doesn't amuse me anymore.

1991
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:42,700
Becket, I'm bored.

1992
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,580
My Prince,

1993
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:46,300
I wish I could help you.

1994
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,860
What are you waiting for?

1995
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,980
For the honor of God

1996
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:52,580
and the honor of the
King to become one.

1997
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,020
That may take long.

1998
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:59,460
Yes, that may take long.

1999
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,780
I'm the King, Thomas,

2000
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:04,060
and so long as
we are on this earth,

2001
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:06,180
you owe me the first move.

2002
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:07,820
I'm prepared to
forget a lot of things

2003
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:11,780
but not the fact
that I am King.

2004
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,140
You yourself taught me that.

2005
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,220
Never forget it, My Prince,

2006
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,460
you have
a different task to do,

2007
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,140
you have to steer the ship.

2008
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:21,020
And you, what do
you have to do?

2009
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,180
To resist you
with all my might

2010
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:25,060
when you steer
against the Lord God.

2011
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:26,740
What do you expect of me then?

2012
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:28,220
Are you hoping I'll weaken?

2013
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:31,020
No.

2014
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,660
I'm afraid we must only do

2015
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:38,860
absurdly, what it has
been given to us to do

2016
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:40,780
right to the end.

2017
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,900
Look suppose we
come down to earth

2018
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:44,260
and use words that make sense

2019
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:46,140
to a bore like myself

2020
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:48,300
otherwise we'll
never get anywhere.

2021
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:49,940
And there'll be
two frozen statutes

2022
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,660
trying to make their peace

2023
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:53,500
in a frozen eternity.

2024
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,820
My Lord, I was doing my best

2025
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:57,060
to make you understand.

2026
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:58,060
I'm an idiot then,

2027
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:59,780
talk to me like an idiot.

2028
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:01,499
Will you lift
the excommunication

2029
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,020
you pronounced
on Lord Gilbert?

2030
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,260
No, because it's the
only weapon I have left

2031
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:07,940
to defend what was
given into my care.

2032
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:09,340
Will you agree to
the ten proposals

2033
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,340
which the Bishop's
accepted in your absence,

2034
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:14,020
particularly, to the
surrender of priests

2035
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:15,180
who seek the
protection of the church

2036
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:17,260
to escape
my courts of justice?

2037
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:18,500
No.

2038
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:21,100
My role is to defend my sheep

2039
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:24,740
and they are my sheep.

2040
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:26,500
But I shall agree to
the nine other articles

2041
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,620
in the spirit of peace

2042
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,020
and because I know
you must remain King

2043
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:31,700
in all and of all,

2044
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,740
save the honor of God.

2045
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:45,740
All right,

2046
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:48,340
I will give way
on this one point

2047
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:51,900
in memory of
our past friendship.

2048
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:53,900
You may return to England.

2049
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,940
Thank you, My Prince.

2050
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:57,179
I meant to go back in any case

2051
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,620
and give myself
up to your power.

2052
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:02,580
For in all things
that concern this earth,

2053
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:04,620
I owe you obedience.

2054
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,620
We're finished now,

2055
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:13,580
and I'm cold.

2056
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:19,980
I feel cold too,

2057
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:22,380
now.

2058
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,780
You never loved
me did you, Thomas?

2059
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:29,380
In so far as
I was capable of love,

2060
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:31,260
yes, I did.

2061
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:34,380
Did you start to love God?

2062
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:35,820
You mule!

2063
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,980
Answer a simple question!

2064
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,380
Yes.

2065
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:45,180
I started to love

2066
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:50,180
the honor of God.

2067
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,860
I should never have seen you.

2068
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,299
It hurts too much.

2069
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,220
My Prince.

2070
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:57,820
No, no pity,

2071
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:01,060
it's dirty.

2072
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03,860
This is the last time
I shall come begging to you.

2073
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:06,900
Go back to England.

2074
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:09,900
Farewell, My Prince.

2075
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:13,500
I sail tomorrow.

2076
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,260
I know that I shall

2077
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,460
never see you again.

2078
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,620
How dare you say that to me

2079
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:19,860
when I've given
you my royal word.

2080
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:21,420
Do you take me for a traitor?

2081
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:33,140
Thomas!

2082
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:18,780
Sit.

2083
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:21,380
Come here you.

2084
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:27,340
Sit here.

2085
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:30,780
You look to me, sir,
not your mother.

2086
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:33,900
Sit, you witless baboon.

2087
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:35,500
What is the meaning of this?

2088
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,620
Henry, what are you doing?

2089
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:38,420
I know very well
what I'm doing madam.

2090
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:42,020
Out.

2091
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,700
Before you fill your bellies,

2092
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:46,100
we have something to announce.

2093
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:48,579
Reviving an ancient custom,

2094
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:50,420
we have decided
to have our successor

2095
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,540
crowned in our lifetime.

2096
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,100
We do this to
protect the kingdom

2097
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:57,020
from future
pretenders to the throne.

2098
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:58,020
Henry, this...

2099
02:00:58,100 --> 02:00:58,940
Shut up.

2100
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:02,460
Stop dribbling while
I raise you to glory.

2101
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:04,220
To my successor,

2102
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,300
Henry the III.

2103
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:11,300
Henry the III.

2104
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:13,700
When will the
coronation take place?

2105
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,740
As soon as we
arrive in England.

2106
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:17,180
Where, may I ask?

2107
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:19,460
You may well ask.

2108
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:20,540
At York.

2109
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:23,260
Not at Canterbury?

2110
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:25,180
My good mother, gentlemen,

2111
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:27,900
is hinting with her
customary delicacy

2112
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:31,220
that there is a double
purpose to this mummery.

2113
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:32,940
There is.

2114
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:34,180
We are going to show

2115
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:36,020
our freshly
reinstated Archbishop

2116
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:38,300
that we can still
do without him.

2117
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:40,660
A coronation of
the English King

2118
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:42,340
is the most jealously guarded

2119
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:45,580
privilege of Canterbury.

2120
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:48,100
I'd give anything
to see Becket's face

2121
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:50,100
when he learns he's lost it,

2122
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:52,540
and that York has got it.

2123
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:57,740
That will fix him.

2124
02:01:57,820 --> 02:02:00,340
Get out of there,
you young cretin,

2125
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:02,260
you're not crowned yet.

2126
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:10,820
What a look.

2127
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:15,980
Filial devotion

2128
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:19,700
is a beautiful thing.

2129
02:02:19,780 --> 02:02:21,220
You'd like to
be the real king,

2130
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:23,300
wouldn't you, you little pig.

2131
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:25,580
With that number
three after your name

2132
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:29,180
and papa good and
stiff in his tomb.

2133
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:31,180
Well, you'll have
to wait a bit.

2134
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,620
Papa is well,

2135
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:36,740
papa is very well indeed.

2136
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:39,420
My son, you know
I've always been against

2137
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,980
any reconciliation
with that wretch Becket.

2138
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,860
You know I understand
your hatred for him,

2139
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:46,900
but do not let it lead
you into an action,

2140
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,340
which you may
bitterly regret.

2141
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:51,060
This boy is not clever

2142
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:52,980
ambitious men will
use him against you

2143
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:56,380
long before you
cease to reign.

2144
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:58,780
I'm still very
much alive, madam,

2145
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:00,580
and in control.

2146
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:04,180
Henry, for all our
sakes, think of England

2147
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:07,660
and not of your disappointed
love for this man.

2148
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:09,180
Love?

2149
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:10,780
Love?

2150
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,780
A moment ago it was hate.

2151
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:14,220
And what gives
you the right madam

2152
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:16,180
to meddle in my
loves and hates?

2153
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,900
You have an
obsession about him,

2154
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,260
which is unhealthy

2155
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:21,300
and unnatural,

2156
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,580
and now that he no
longer gives you comfort...

2157
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:24,540
Oh, God.

2158
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:26,300
If Thomas Becket
were a faithless woman,

2159
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:28,300
you'd behave no differently.

2160
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:31,740
Sweet Jesus, you tear
him out of your heart.

2161
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:33,780
Oh, if I were a man.

2162
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:38,260
Thank God, madam,
he gave you breasts.

2163
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:39,860
An asset from which I derived

2164
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:42,820
not the slightest benefit.

2165
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:45,620
I was let out to be
suckled by a peasant girl.

2166
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:47,380
That no doubt
is why it is so difficult

2167
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:50,100
to see the king
beneath your crown.

2168
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:54,340
So you have something
to add my lady.

2169
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:56,460
Well go on, add it,

2170
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:58,540
add it, get it out of you,

2171
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:01,780
once and for all
in one great whine.

2172
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:04,780
Let's hear the poison
you've accumulated.

2173
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:06,780
I pity you.

2174
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:10,100
I tolerated your
mistresses, sir,

2175
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:12,540
but do you expect me
to tolerate everything?

2176
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:13,740
Becket!

2177
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:15,500
Always Becket!

2178
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,380
I am a woman,

2179
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:17,620
I am your wife,

2180
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:18,900
I am a Queen!

2181
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:20,380
I'll complain to my father!

2182
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:22,020
I'll complain to
my uncle the Emperor!

2183
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,980
I'll complain to
all the Kings of Europe!

2184
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:26,100
I'll complain to God!

2185
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:30,860
If I were you, madam,
I'd start with God!

2186
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:33,500
Go to your chapel
and see if he's at home!

2187
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:35,300
Get out the pack of you.

2188
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:37,780
I wretch with boredom
at the sight of you!

2189
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:39,060
To the devil,

2190
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:41,980
with my whole family
if he'll have you!

2191
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:42,980
And as for you,

2192
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:44,620
young Henry the III,

2193
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:46,060
here's my royal foot

2194
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,340
up your royal buttocks!

2195
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,460
Ah,

2196
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:06,900
that's better.

2197
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:10,380
Let us drink, gentlemen.

2198
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:11,980
Let us drink,

2199
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:13,620
till we roll under the table

2200
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:16,020
in vomit and oblivion.

2201
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:23,220
My faithful hounds.

2202
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,060
It's warm beside you,

2203
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,260
like beasts in a stable.

2204
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:31,100
Good sweat.

2205
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:34,620
Comfortable nothingness.

2206
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:37,700
Not the least glimmer inside

2207
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:40,180
to spoil the fun.

2208
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:44,140
And to think before
I met Becket I was like you,

2209
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:46,460
a well oiled machine,

2210
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:47,620
for belching,

2211
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:53,780
whoring and punching heads.

2212
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:56,540
What did you put
in mine, Thomas,

2213
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:58,620
That stopped the machine?

2214
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:04,380
Tell me, do you ever think?

2215
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:05,740
Never, Sire,

2216
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:09,819
a gentleman has
better things to do.

2217
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:11,420
Here, drink up.

2218
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:16,700
What's the news from England?

2219
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:19,300
Has Becket landed?

2220
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:23,500
He has landed, Sire.

2221
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:27,260
Was no one there
to receive him,

2222
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:30,660
Lord Gilbert for example?

2223
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:32,460
Oh, he was there,

2224
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:35,940
damned and
excommunicated as he still is.

2225
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,620
But there were
seven bishops there

2226
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:40,220
charging his soldiers
not to cause bloodshed

2227
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:41,980
and give the light
of the safe conduct

2228
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,220
you gave Becket.

2229
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,140
Yes,

2230
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,260
I gave him safe conduct.

2231
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:50,180
The peasants escorted him

2232
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:51,780
from village to village.

2233
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:52,860
They cheered him

2234
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,740
all the way to Canterbury.

2235
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:56,740
Not a single gentleman,

2236
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:59,300
not a single Norman
showed his face.

2237
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:00,540
Only Saxons?

2238
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:01,620
Yes.

2239
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:04,140
Swarms of them.

2240
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:06,060
Becket left
England a fugitive,

2241
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:07,860
an exile.

2242
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,660
He's returned there
to find an affection

2243
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:11,619
that people have always saved

2244
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:13,500
for their king.

2245
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:19,100
A man who ate my bread.

2246
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:24,540
A man I raised from nothing.

2247
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,140
A man I loved.

2248
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,700
Yes,

2249
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:37,020
I loved him.

2250
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:39,940
I loved him,

2251
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:44,580
and I still do.

2252
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:49,020
Enough, oh God, enough.

2253
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:52,140
Stop.

2254
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:54,100
Stop.

2255
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:04,100
I can do nothing,

2256
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:07,060
I'm as useless as a woman.

2257
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:12,100
So long as he's alive,

2258
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:14,060
I tremble,

2259
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:17,740
I shake.

2260
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:21,180
I'm the king,

2261
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:23,940
and yet I shake.

2262
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:35,020
Will no one rid me

2263
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:37,620
of this meddlesome priest?

2264
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:44,260
A priest who mocks me.

2265
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:47,139
Are all around me cowards,

2266
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:49,540
like myself?

2267
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:53,100
Are there no men
left in England.

2268
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,380
It's my heart.

2269
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:06,780
It's too fast,

2270
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:09,660
too fast,

2271
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:11,740
it's too...

2272
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:47,860
Thomas.

2273
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:00,420
Make haste.

2274
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,580
It's difficult with
all these little laces,

2275
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,580
it warrants a woman's hands.

2276
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:06,380
A man's hands
are better today.

2277
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,940
What's worth doing,
is worth doing well.

2278
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:11,220
Yes.

2279
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:12,220
If it's worth doing,

2280
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,460
it's worth doing well.

2281
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:19,140
Do up all the laces,
every one of them.

2282
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:23,580
I must look my best today.

2283
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:26,460
God will give us time.

2284
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:28,460
There, that's done.

2285
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:31,140
But I just as soon had cleaned
out our pigsty at home,

2286
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:33,420
it's not half
so much hard work.

2287
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,740
Are you fond of your pig?

2288
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:39,740
Yes, I was.

2289
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:41,340
At my father's house
we had some pigs too

2290
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,580
when I was a child.

2291
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:44,300
Did you now?

2292
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:51,100
Will it...

2293
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:54,620
be today?

2294
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:58,500
It's possible, my son.

2295
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:59,660
Are you afraid?

2296
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:00,980
Oh, no,

2297
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:04,740
not if I have time to fight.

2298
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,020
All I want is the chance

2299
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,940
to strike a few blows first,

2300
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:12,180
so I shan't have done nothing
but receive them all my life.

2301
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:15,780
If I can kill one
Norman first, just one,

2302
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:18,540
that'll seem fair
and right enough to me.

2303
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:20,100
Are you so set
in killing one?

2304
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:21,860
Yes, I am.

2305
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:23,020
I don't mind if I am

2306
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:25,340
just a grain of
sand in a machine

2307
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:26,500
because I know

2308
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:29,380
by putting more and more
grains of sand in a machine,

2309
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:32,420
one day it'll come
grinding to a stop.

2310
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,340
And on that day,

2311
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:35,460
what then?

2312
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:37,940
Well, we'll have a fine,
new, well oiled machine

2313
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,900
in place of the old one,

2314
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:43,340
and this time we'll put
the Normans into it instead.

2315
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:50,540
That's what justice
means, doesn't it?

2316
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:07,420
Now give me my silver cross,

2317
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,380
I must hold it.

2318
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:16,660
My Lord, it's heavy.

2319
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:20,460
A good swipe with this
and they'd feel it.

2320
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:23,260
Lucky little Saxon,

2321
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:24,620
for you that would
settle all accounts

2322
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:28,020
in this black worid,
wouldn't it?

2323
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:41,340
There Lord,

2324
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:45,220
I am ready,

2325
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,940
adorned for your festivities.

2326
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:53,740
Come,

2327
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,420
let us go to the altar.

2328
02:13:20,580 --> 02:13:22,020
Your Grace.

2329
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:25,300
Your Grace.

2330
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:27,460
There are armed
men at the doors.

2331
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:28,860
I bolted the doors but...

2332
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:30,980
It's time for vespers.

2333
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:32,900
Does one bolt the
doors during vespers,

2334
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:34,420
I've never heard of it?

2335
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:35,740
But Your Grace?

2336
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:37,860
Open them.

2337
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:39,260
Everything must
be as it should be

2338
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:41,140
for divine service.

2339
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:19,740
It is here now,

2340
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:22,540
the supreme folly,

2341
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:24,940
this is its hour.

2342
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:07,980
One does not carry
arms into God's house.

2343
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:11,140
What do you want?

2344
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:13,180
Your death.

2345
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:25,380
We will continue
with the service.

2346
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:34,100
Saxon!

2347
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:37,380
Dog!

2348
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:39,060
Traitor!

2349
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,580
Oh Lord,

2350
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:12,260
how heavy thy
honor is to bear.

2351
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:08,660
Poor, Henry.

2352
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:48,140
Thank you.

2353
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:51,340
Thank you.

2354
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:53,340
Yes, yes, it was all agreed.

2355
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:57,860
I forgive you, pigs.

2356
02:17:57,900 --> 02:18:01,580
Saxon pigs.

2357
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:06,300
They certainly wanted
their money's worth.

2358
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:10,020
Is there a
large crowd outside?

2359
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:12,260
Yes, Sire.

2360
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:15,140
There's nothing more
certain to win them over

2361
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:17,499
than the sight of
a king doing penance

2362
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:19,740
and humbling himself
under the lash.

2363
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:26,340
The honor of God, gentlemen,

2364
02:18:26,380 --> 02:18:28,900
is a very good thing

2365
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:30,180
and all things considered

2366
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:35,620
one gains by having
it on one's side.

2367
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:38,460
Thomas Becket our friend,

2368
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,540
always used to say so.

2369
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:45,100
Tonight in council,

2370
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:46,940
we will determine
what punishment

2371
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:50,260
his murderers should receive.

2372
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:52,420
Sire, they are unknown.

2373
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:56,780
Our justice will
seek them out,

2374
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:58,820
you may be sure.

2375
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:08,140
It is a time my dear Barons,

2376
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:10,860
for all of us to do penance.

2377
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:39,180
Hear me!

2378
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:41,260
People of Canterbury

2379
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:45,540
and citizens of England.

2380
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:48,980
As I have submitted
myself to the lash,

2381
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:52,700
so have I petitioned the Pope.

2382
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:54,380
And this day,

2383
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:56,860
I have received his answer.

2384
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,820
Thomas Becket,

2385
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:01,780
former Archbishop
of Canterbury

2386
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:03,700
and martyr to the cause

2387
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:06,500
of God and his church

2388
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:09,620
shall henceforth be honored

2389
02:20:09,700 --> 02:20:12,780
and prayed to in this kingdom

2390
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:14,860
as a saint.

2391
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:48,180
Is the honor of God

2392
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:51,260
washed clean enough?

2393
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:54,220
Are you satisfied now, Thomas?
