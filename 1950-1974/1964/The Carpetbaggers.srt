1
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:31,683
Every generation has
its modern carpetbaggers,

2
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:34,390
its adventurers
who gamble everything

3
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,627
to stand head and shoulders
above other men.

4
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,931
Among them could be
a creative giant,

5
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:42,233
a do-gooder, a tyrant
or a plunderer,

6
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,500
a man who leaves
his personal brand

7
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,906
on everything
and everyone he touches.

8
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:49,036
I guess in the past generation

9
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:53,139
it could have been someone
like the fictional and fabulous

10
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:54,376
Jonas Cord, Jr.--

11
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,181
the best or the worst,
depending on how much

12
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,381
you imagine he might
have hurt you

13
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:01,913
or how much you believed
he helped you.

14
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,291
The legend of Jonas
spanned almost two decades

15
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,491
and it began
that April morning in the 1920s

16
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,999
in the sky
over the Nevada desert.

17
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,501
There it is, Jonas!

18
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,765
We hit it right on the nose!

19
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,538
Let me take the stick
for a while.

20
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,739
You can't fly.

21
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:27,614
I've been watching
you. It's simple.

22
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,413
You pull it back and you go up.

23
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,545
You push it forward
and you go down.

24
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:36,422
Okay, it's yours,
but be careful.

25
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,899
You're gonna kill us!

26
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:51,170
Get your hands the hell
off that stick, kid!

27
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,174
That felt good.

28
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,903
I'm going to try it again.

29
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,911
Not with me in it.

30
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,277
Well, then get out--
it's my plane.

31
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:13,756
Look out!

32
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,435
Take her, Joe. Land it.

33
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,077
Hey, Nevada!

34
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,349
Where's your horse?

35
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,880
Still running from
that dive you made.

36
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:19,456
What the hell is that
pilot trying to prove?

37
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:24,523
Joe? He's a first-class flyer.

38
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,432
He does have a tendency
to get airsick.

39
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:29,097
Somebody should take
the plane away from him.

40
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,867
It’s not his-- it's mine.

41
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:33,535
Huh. You can't fly.

42
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,510
I just did.

43
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,537
I might have known it.

44
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,106
All right, what
did the rig cost you?

45
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,210
Nothing. I picked it up
in an all-night poker game

46
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:47,086
from an unlucky card player
named Buzz Dalton.

47
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:50,217
Now, he could fly this
through the hole in a doughnut.

48
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,227
You know, your father didn't
like the way you handled it.

49
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:56,492
My father didn't like the way
God handled the creation.

50
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:58,227
You scared the pinto beans

51
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:00,802
out of every Mexican
in the factory.

52
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,174
Nevada, who told the old man
about me and the girl?

53
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,766
The newspapers.

54
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,369
You had a pretty big spread.

55
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,108
Ah, it was a grandstand play.

56
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:13,513
She didn't want to die.

57
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,517
Came close to it.

58
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,485
Look, the longer we keep
the old man waiting

59
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,612
the more he's like a mule

60
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,814
with a burr under his tail.

61
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:20,879
Now come on, let's go.

62
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,533
Another ounce ought
to make it about 3:00.

63
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,162
Is that all
you've got to say

64
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:38,400
after ruining half
a day's production

65
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:41,410
with another one of
your crazy stunts?

66
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,004
Your message said to get
down here in a hurry.

67
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:45,206
Not through the roof.

68
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:46,442
Two more feet and everything

69
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:47,449
within three miles

70
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,212
of this powder keg
would have vanished.

71
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:52,517
Yeah. Yeah,
I gave that some thought.

72
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:55,615
Why the hell didn't you get
out of that hotel room

73
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:57,216
when McAllister told you?

74
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,387
'Cause the girl
tried to kill herself.

75
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:00,952
I couldn't leave her alone.

76
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:03,158
You didn't have
to go to the hospital

77
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,565
and to make a small
story on page ten

78
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,159
into page-one headlines.

79
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:10,728
Well, it would've read worse
if I tried to hide.

80
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:17,008
Well, what did you do

81
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:20,538
that made the girl
want to take her life?

82
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,642
A pretty ordinary thing.

83
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:26,177
I told her there
wouldn't be any wedding.

84
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:28,520
And if you had any brains...

85
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:29,683
Brains?

86
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:30,692
Right now.

87
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:32,956
Right now,
sitting in my conference room

88
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,021
there's a pair of vultures
waiting to pick my pockets

89
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:38,761
for $30,000 or they'll sue
for breach of promise

90
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,200
and who knows what else?

91
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,965
Tell them to go ahead.

92
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,699
Watch the price drop.

93
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:45,400
This is the fourth
girl in a year

94
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:46,703
that you've been
in trouble with.

95
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:50,178
Are you angry or... jealous?

96
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,543
Disgusted.

97
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,880
A son with everything--
name, money, business--

98
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:57,010
and he runs around

99
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,543
like some homeless moron.

100
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,885
Now, where do you
think you're going?

101
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:02,288
Back to Los Angeles.

102
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,987
You don't need me
to make up your mind.

103
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,485
You're either going
to pay him off, or you're not.

104
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,159
Besides, I got a date.

105
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:14,691
What are you trying to prove?

106
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:16,568
That you're a man?

107
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:21,304
Well, a man is judged
by what's in his head...

108
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,936
not in his bed.

109
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,040
You dried-up, impotent old man.

110
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,916
You ought to be glad
somebody in this family

111
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,442
still has what it takes.

112
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,955
otherwise, that
so-called wife of yours, Rina,

113
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,254
might think there was something
wrong with all of us Cords.

114
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,231
Jonas?

115
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:49,768
Jo...

116
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:03,074
Age 48. Survivors, wife Rina
Marlowe Cord and Jonas Cord, Jr.

117
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,417
Cause of death,
encephalic embolism.

118
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:08,355
That's medical for
''blood clot on the brain.''

119
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,655
Will you accept it or
do you want an autopsy?

120
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,251
Can you put down heart attack?

121
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,955
I'm afraid I can't do that.

122
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:15,930
Then keep it confidential.

123
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:19,332
I'll make the public
announcement my own way.

124
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,962
It’s your privilege.

125
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,699
I'll file it

126
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,536
and have my girl
send you copies.

127
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:36,275
The German contracts.

128
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,183
They're supposed
to be signed tomorrow.

129
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,379
Who's going to do it?

130
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:40,719
I am.

131
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:45,056
Denby,
I said I am.

132
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,688
You don't need
McAllister's permission.

133
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,425
Yes, Junior.

134
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:55,093
And don't you ever
call me Junior again.

135
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:00,542
Oh. Those people outside.

136
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,441
Give them $5,000, get a release

137
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:03,604
and kick them out.

138
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,375
Suppose, suppose
they won't take it?

139
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,541
Denby, their mother knows
she sent that girl

140
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,744
to trap me into marriage,
and I can prove it.

141
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:12,219
Yes, Junior, uh, Jonas.

142
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:13,778
Give the news
to the factory help.

143
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,814
Tell them they get
the rest of the week off,

144
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,325
a five percent
increase in wages,

145
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,554
and see to it they
attend the funeral to a man.

146
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:20,857
Got it?

147
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,126
Yes, Jonas.

148
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,233
Five percent increase?

149
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:27,530
But why?

150
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,629
Because next week
I'm going to ask them

151
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,696
to work 20º/º harder.

152
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:33,230
Yes, Jonas.

153
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,469
Good-bye.

154
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:42,073
I drew up your father's will.

155
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,585
He held 90º/º
of the stock in his name

156
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,780
and it's yours.

157
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,584
You'd better get it
probated right away.

158
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,717
Looks like I'm going to need

159
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,250
a personal consultant
and lawyer--

160
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,990
someone like you, Mac.

161
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,190
Full-time.

162
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,257
A hundred thousand a year
to start.

163
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,802
Yes or no?

164
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:04,897
How do you know you can afford
to pay that kind of money?

165
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,408
You're too smart to
say yes if I can't.

166
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:11,671
Well...

167
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,682
Now, the first thing
we'll have to do

168
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,048
is call a meeting
of the board of directors

169
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:19,213
and have you officially elected
president of the company.

170
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:23,214
lf I own 90º/º of the stock,
I just elected myself president.

171
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,293
Make the happy announcement.

172
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,229
Who owns the other 10º/º?

173
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,395
Well, two-and-a-half
percent each

174
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:36,233
Rina Cord and Nevada Smith.

175
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:39,400
Two percent each, Judge Samuel
Haskell and Peter Carmac,

176
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,739
president of the
Industrial Bank of Reno,

177
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:44,245
and one percent to
your father's secretary,

178
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,406
Eugene Denby.

179
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,881
What's our cash position?

180
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,646
Solvent, but thin.

181
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,245
What do we need
to be solid?

182
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:54,117
Oh, about $200,000.

183
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:55,646
What have you done about it?

184
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,921
What makes you think
I've done anything?

185
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,257
You're here. My father wouldn't

186
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:00,386
call you from Los Angeles

187
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,192
just to settle with
that girl's parents.

188
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,495
He could have done
that himself.

189
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:08,367
I arranged a loan from
Pioneer National Trust Company

190
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,463
of Los Angeles for $300,000.

191
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,768
Good.

192
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,741
That'll give me enough money
to buy out

193
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,073
the minority stockholders,

194
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,135
not counting Nevada
and Rina, of course.

195
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,806
What's the minority
stock worth?

196
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,338
Maybe $60,000.

197
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:22,680
I want complete control.

198
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:25,209
Offer the others...
25,000 for their stock.

199
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,219
But Jo...

200
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,550
They take it or leave it.

201
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,218
Tell them I'm so young
and inexperienced

202
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,919
and have such wild ideas

203
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:35,362
that in a year, the stock
might only be worth ten.

204
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:38,628
And after they take it,
tell Denby he's through.

205
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,726
He's too nervous to be honest.

206
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,567
Suppose they turn it down.

207
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,507
They won't,
if you're a good enough actor.

208
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:49,908
Well, is there anything else

209
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,537
I should take care of,
Counselor?

210
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,980
Well, you might think
over that German contract,

211
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,813
the one you're going
to sign tomorrow.

212
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:58,183
Contract for what?

213
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,415
Something to do
with a new product.

214
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,356
Plastics, I think he called it.

215
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:04,018
Have Denby give
you the file on it

216
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,890
before you talk to
him about his stock.

217
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:08,453
Study it, and give me a
breakdown tomorrow morning.

218
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,794
All right.

219
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,823
lf you'd prefer,
I'll clean out that desk,

220
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,494
take care
of the personal things.

221
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:16,504
Personal things?

222
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:21,304
He was an impersonal man.

223
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,834
The contents of this desk...

224
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,076
you could never tell he once
had a wife who had his son.

225
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,748
Your father was
a very remarkable man, Jonas.

226
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:33,914
My father was a greedy, selfish,

227
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:36,186
insensitive,
unsympathetic drunk.

228
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:39,251
How he got as far as he did,
I'll never know.

229
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,567
It was a present from my mother.

230
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:54,641
Have the plane ready,
tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m.

231
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:56,167
Airplane?

232
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,736
We're flying to Los Angeles
to get the money.

233
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,646
What about your
father's funeral?

234
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:01,877
Don't worry.

235
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,714
I wouldn't miss that
for anything.

236
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:08,329
Welcome home, Mr. Jonas.

237
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,395
Thank you, Jedediah.

238
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,664
My father's dead.

239
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:14,676
I know.

240
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,143
Mr. Denby called.

241
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,578
I'm deeply sorry, Mr. Jonas.

242
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,081
Anyone else know?

243
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:24,313
I didn't think it was
my position to tell them.

244
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:27,117
Mrs. Cord is in her room.

245
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,695
Louise, bring in my robe.

246
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:54,481
Jonas!

247
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:55,505
Hi.

248
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,381
Where's Louise?

249
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:58,477
Downstairs.

250
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,886
Your father wouldn't
like this.

251
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:02,287
He'll never know.

252
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:04,087
He will if I tell him.

253
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:05,184
You won't.

254
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:07,091
You seem pretty
sure of yourself.

255
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,391
I am.

256
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:11,955
Jonas, stop that...

257
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,729
What do you think you're...?

258
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,737
Have you gone
out of your mind?

259
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,001
Don't you know
at any minute now,

260
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,440
he could come walking in
that door?

261
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:23,808
No, he won't.

262
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,403
He won't?

263
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:29,679
Mrs. Cord, your dearly beloved
husband is dead.

264
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,387
He had a stroke.

265
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:44,828
He died about...
2:30 this afternoon.

266
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,168
I better get dressed.

267
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,643
Uh-uh.

268
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,742
I'm not finished.

269
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,578
What is there to finish?

270
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,049
You and me.

271
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:05,610
Didn't we start out together?

272
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,589
Didn't I bring you home
to show my father my girl?

273
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:09,590
The only girl?

274
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:10,921
Oh, Jonas...

275
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,927
Didn't I hold your hand
like a schoolboy?

276
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,725
Never once touching you below
the neck or above the knee.

277
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:16,822
And in five minutes,

278
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,560
didn't a coarse,
middle-aged rum pot

279
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,693
take you away from me
and straight up to bed?

280
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:21,725
Oh, Jonas, please...

281
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,896
Now, how did that happen?

282
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,132
What'd he tell you about me?

283
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,139
Jonas, please...

284
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,197
What'd he say?

285
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,707
He said you were too young.

286
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:29,142
And I don't-don't remember.

287
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:31,111
Well...

288
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:33,944
I'm not too young now.

289
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:37,383
I'm the master,
the head of the house.

290
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,712
And I've stood in line
long enough for you.

291
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:46,217
You wouldn't dare.

292
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,561
I'll scream. The servant...

293
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,831
Will think
you're screaming with grief.

294
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,409
Oh, Jonas...

295
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:12,181
Oh, Jonas, Jonas, Jonas...

296
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:13,482
You want me, Rina?

297
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:14,614
Oh, yes.

298
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:15,782
Why now?

299
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:17,519
Oh, I've always wanted you.

300
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,026
I've always wanted you.

301
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,618
But you chose my father?

302
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:22,653
I chose money.
I didn't have any.

303
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:25,188
Oh, Jonas, what
difference does it make?

304
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,133
We can do anything
we want now.

305
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,935
I'm yours any
way you want me.

306
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, love me, Jonas.

307
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,102
Love me, love me, love me.

308
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:36,201
What for?

309
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:37,573
You know you want me

310
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:40,410
more than anything
in the world.

311
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,474
I just wanted to see
how far you'd go

312
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:44,610
before your late husband
was cold.

313
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,348
I'd go further than
you'd ever dare.

314
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:47,719
You'd grab at anything now.

315
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:49,155
Oh, Jonas, you lost me once.

316
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,715
Don't do it again.

317
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:56,195
The day I take you is when
you've got everything you want--

318
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:57,698
when you're happy--

319
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:00,792
when you have nothing to gain
and everything to lose.

320
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,531
You're afraid,
scared you can't make it.

321
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:05,005
Afraid you're not half the man
that your father was.

322
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,065
And you're not,
you never could be!

323
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:08,632
You're not a man!

324
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:11,510
You're just a scared
little boy,

325
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:13,411
a scared little boy!

326
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:14,608
Junior!

327
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,640
Junior!

328
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,516
Junior!

329
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,381
Good afternoon.

330
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:23,755
Why, Mr. McAllister,

331
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,191
we thought you were in Nevada.

332
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,091
I was, four hours ago.

333
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:29,721
Mr. Moroni in?

334
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:32,130
Oh, I'm sure he is, but I'm
supposed to say I'll see.

335
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,634
I'll see.

336
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,809
lf Denby looked like that,
he'd still be working for me.

337
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:43,572
I thought the loan
was being made

338
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,045
to the Cord Chemical Company.

339
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,980
Well, Jonas...

340
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,609
A good banker looks through the
company, to the man behind it.

341
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:50,948
My experience is limited,

342
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,216
but it's still backed
by adequate collateral.

343
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,746
Here are the production
estimates, Mr. Moroni.

344
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,223
Very optimistic.

345
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,227
How well do you know your
business, Mr. Cord?

346
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:01,727
Not as well as I will
next month or next year.

347
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:04,323
But this much I do know:
Nothing stays the same.

348
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,926
In the years to come,
there'll be ways of making money

349
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:08,959
that never existed
in my father's time.

350
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,905
I presume you're referring
to this new product

351
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,534
you're acquiring
by the German contracts.

352
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:16,168
That's part of it.

353
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,769
And just how much
do you know about plastics?

354
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:22,374
I heard the word
for the first time yesterday.

355
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,443
And what makes you so sure
it's worth anything?

356
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:28,615
Eastman and Dupont's interest
in the American rights.

357
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,716
Anything
they're that interested in

358
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,488
has got to be worth something.

359
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:34,995
And before you agreed
to lend us the money

360
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,157
you must have given it
some thought.

361
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:40,031
Well, buying an option
and knowing what to do with it

362
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,626
are vastly different matters.

363
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,070
The day after the funeral, I'll
be on the first ship to Germany

364
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:45,834
to learn all there is to know
about plastics.

365
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:48,104
And while you're gone?

366
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:51,374
Mr. McAllister has agreed
to join us.

367
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,404
He'll run the company.

368
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:01,988
You will note that although
the loan is for $300,000

369
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:06,790
we are extending your credit
to the maximum of $500,000.

370
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:09,956
One of my banking
principles, Mr. Cord.

371
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,228
I don't believe in budgeting

372
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,825
my clients too closely.

373
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:17,133
Sometimes, a few dollars more

374
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:21,006
makes the difference
between success and failure.

375
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:23,602
Or the difference
between profit and loss

376
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,203
on the loan to the bank.

377
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:30,346
No strings
on the additional money?

378
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:33,252
Only my approval
when you spend it.

379
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,381
Thank you, Mr. Moroni.

380
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,722
Now, would you gentlemen like
to be my guests

381
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,920
at dinner this evening?

382
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,950
Well, unfortunately

383
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:42,725
we're due back
in Nevada tonight.

384
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:44,061
Tonight?

385
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,260
Well, the afternoon
train has already left.

386
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,268
I own my own plane.

387
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,030
We'll be home at 9:00.

388
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,766
9:00? Mr. Cord...

389
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:54,172
you-you better fly carefully

390
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,972
Mr. Cord.

391
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:59,412
After all, we just gave you
a lot of money.

392
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:01,915
Well, if anything happens to us
on the way down,

393
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,474
just stop payment on the check.

394
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:05,486
You must live
a terribly exciting life.

395
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,010
-Oh...
-What's your name?

396
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,147
Lisa.

397
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,555
Hey, Jonas!

398
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:11,991
What a surprise.

399
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,494
Hello, Buzz.

400
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:15,189
Mr. Dalton, Mr. McAllister,
Mr. Moroni.

401
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,390
How are you?

402
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:17,398
Mr. Dalton.

403
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:18,399
Glad to meet you.

404
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,400
Mr. Dalton is the pilot

405
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:20,594
from whom I secured the plane.

406
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:21,829
What are you doing here, Buzz?

407
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,667
Trying to get a stake
for another poker game?

408
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:24,831
In a way.

409
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:27,103
I've been trying
to see Mr. Moroni.

410
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:28,632
I got a mail contract.

411
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:32,238
L.A. to Frisco, 12 months
guaranteed at $10,000 a month.

412
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:35,839
But I have to pass it up,
unless I can find the dough

413
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,216
to buy the three planes
that I need.

414
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,515
How much it cost?

415
00:21:39,554 --> 00:21:43,615
30,000. 20 for the planes,
and 10 to keep them flying

416
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:45,250
until the first check comes in.

417
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,588
Are these the figures?

418
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,152
Yeah, got it all worked out.

419
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:49,686
I can net five grand a month

420
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,494
after expenses and amortization.

421
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:53,501
You got your money,
on two conditions.

422
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:55,560
I get 50º/º of the stock
in your company

423
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:57,503
and a chattel mortgage
on your planes

424
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,200
amortized
over a 12-month period,

425
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,834
both payable to Cord Chemicals.

426
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,400
Partner...

427
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:06,744
you now own
a brand-new business.

428
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,942
Mr. Moroni, would
you be kind enough

429
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:10,780
to arrange the
details for me?

430
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,047
Certainly, Mr. Cord.

431
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,554
Make the loan for 50,000.

432
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,715
Wait a minute.
I only asked for 30.

433
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:17,725
Yes, but I just
learned something

434
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,919
about good banking.

435
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,825
An honest man always needs more

436
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:21,920
than he asks for.

437
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,988
Good luck, Buzz.

438
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:25,863
Let's go, Mac.

439
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,663
Hey, what do we call
the company?

440
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:28,691
International Airways.

441
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:29,829
International?

442
00:22:29,871 --> 00:22:31,463
We're only going
from L.A. to Frisco.

443
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:34,134
This year.

444
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:36,109
Next year, who knows?

445
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:59,262
Watching you pack gives me
travel fever.

446
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,564
Take something for it.

447
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:03,434
I'm going to.

448
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,336
A powder, tonight.

449
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,967
No need to.

450
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:09,203
It’s your house now.

451
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:10,905
He left it to you.

452
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,139
I'm selling it.

453
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,204
You are?

454
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:16,306
Mm-hmm. To you.

455
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:19,013
For $100,000.

456
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:23,651
It only cost 55.

457
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:26,751
Along with it goes my stock
in Cord Chemicals.

458
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:29,229
The stock isn't
worth the difference.

459
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,594
Under the laws
of the State of Nevada

460
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,727
I'm entitled to one-third
of your father's estate

461
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:36,168
will or no will.

462
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,001
Facts of life, Jonas.

463
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,530
I could tie you up in court
for five years.

464
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,708
I can wait. Can you?

465
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:47,812
No.

466
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,613
Well, let's make it easy
on you, then.

467
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:52,142
I'll take 50,000 now

468
00:23:52,187 --> 00:23:54,917
and your note
endorsed by the company

469
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:58,619
for 10,000 a year
for the next five years.

470
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,708
How do you like
my widow's weeds?

471
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,210
lf you'd worn those
to the funeral

472
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:25,219
you wouldn't be a widow.

473
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:27,016
He'd have climbed right
out of the coffin.

474
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:36,687
The first installment.

475
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:37,755
Jonas...

476
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,788
You'll get my note

477
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,460
for the balance
tomorrow morning.

478
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:41,866
No, it's not that.

479
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:45,066
I'm sorry for what happened
the other day.

480
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:47,597
Neither of us meant
what we said.

481
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:49,610
I did.

482
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,249
Jonas, what can I do?

483
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:02,552
You can live well on $100,000.

484
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,148
Then at least do me one favor.

485
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,160
The way you feel,
it should be easy.

486
00:25:06,194 --> 00:25:07,559
Uh-uh.

487
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:09,495
The way I feel
doesn't include favors.

488
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,122
Well, then give
yourself a present.

489
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:12,598
Get your revenge over with.

490
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:13,658
Do it now.

491
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,464
Mistreat me,
make love to me, anything,

492
00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:18,199
only get it over with.

493
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,002
No, thank you.

494
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,601
Jonas, please,
it has to be done.

495
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:24,339
Anything, everything,
then throw me out.

496
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:26,313
That's what you enjoy,

497
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:29,373
the only thing
you really want, isn't it?

498
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,817
You don't know any more
about love than I do.

499
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:32,945
You want sensation--

500
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:34,784
the uglier, the better.

501
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:37,814
The more it hurts,
the nicer it is.

502
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,727
The more improper,
the more exciting.

503
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,697
I just want
to get this over with

504
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:46,359
so that you can have
your satisfaction

505
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:47,834
and I can pay my debts.

506
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:48,836
Who knows?

507
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,895
You might find out
you like me

508
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:51,928
more then you realize.

509
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:02,079
I do like you, Rina.

510
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:10,716
I like you a lot.

511
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:14,819
And I'm going
to go on liking you...

512
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:18,025
because for someone
with your hunger

513
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:21,524
that's the best torture
I can think of.

514
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:25,437
Now you have a nice time
with your paycheck.

515
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:55,860
Come in.

516
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,595
Well, Rina just pulled out

517
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:03,197
considerably richer
than when she arrived.

518
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,970
So I heard.

519
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:07,374
Where are you going?

520
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,902
Germany.

521
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,641
Hit the trail myself.

522
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:14,081
I figured on
taking you with me.

523
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,106
Oh, no, not me.

524
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:16,119
Stay here then.

525
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:17,142
I just bought my house.

526
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,848
I'll be back
in a couple of months.

527
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,948
No, I'm leaving tonight.

528
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:21,958
Why?

529
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:23,584
Oh, some houses just die.

530
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:25,959
It’s better to get out
of them quick.

531
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:32,128
You're the only friend I got,
Nevada.

532
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:33,136
You're my real father.

533
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,501
Now, don't split up the family.

534
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:37,507
Nicely said, Junior,

535
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,031
but I'm a hired hand,

536
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,566
and all jobs have
to end sometime.

537
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,239
Just remember what I taught you:

538
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:47,544
Choose your side, draw fast,

539
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,417
but don't hit
any innocent bystanders.

540
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:56,386
I'll try.

541
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,589
lf you're determined to leave,
I guess you'll need some money.

542
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:02,826
No. No, I'm okay.

543
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,382
It’s a going-away present.

544
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:33,624
Max Sand-- ever hear of him?

545
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:40,560
Cowboy father, indian mother,
grew up wild.

546
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,071
Went after three outlaws

547
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,629
who tortured and killed
his parents.

548
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:47,165
Gunned them down,
one at a time.

549
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:51,805
Bodyguard in a fancy house
in New Orleans.

550
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:53,748
Killed another man there.

551
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,648
Went to a prison camp,
escaped.

552
00:28:55,685 --> 00:29:00,054
Robbed banks, hid in Mexico.

553
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,250
Satisfied more women

554
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:03,417
than a cavalry regiment
on leave.

555
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,727
Wanted in six states.

556
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:11,928
Then something happened.

557
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:15,734
He hung up his guns,
turned soft.

558
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:18,502
Took a job as a companion
to a boy with no mother,

559
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,009
no father to speak of.

560
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:23,979
Max Sand.
Did you ever hear of him?

561
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:25,208
Well, I'll be.

562
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:29,376
Did you dig up
all this information yourself?

563
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,819
And that's the only copy.

564
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,620
Even your father didn't know.

565
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:38,150
Nobody did.

566
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,525
Nobody does.

567
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:42,361
How much you asking for this?

568
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,867
Nothing.

569
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,994
Take it with you.

570
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:50,234
But if you're ever tempted
to preach me a sermon sometime

571
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,241
just open it to any page
and recall your own sins.

572
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:59,010
Who has a better right
to preach than the sinner?

573
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,073
Junior, you're not going

574
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:01,640
to make me pay for this someday
are you?

575
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,586
Depend on it.

576
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:13,462
By the way, I almost forgot.

577
00:30:13,496 --> 00:30:15,259
I have something for you.

578
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:16,265
What is it?

579
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,096
All my stock in Cord Chemical,

580
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:21,262
signed over to you,
lock, stock and barrel.

581
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:23,101
Nevada, this is, this is...

582
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:24,572
Don't say anything.

583
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:25,973
It’s no use to me.

584
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:29,473
All right.

585
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:33,507
Well...

586
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,950
good-bye, Junior.

587
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:42,017
Good-bye, Nevada.

588
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,116
Keep in touch.

589
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:48,360
Sure.

590
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:01,071
Nevada?

591
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,579
Yeah?

592
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,580
Where you going?

593
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:05,945
What are you going to do?

594
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:08,678
Join up with a couple
of old saddle tramp buddies,

595
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:12,916
take a Wild West circus
around the country.

596
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,116
Something I've always
wanted to do.

597
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:17,058
I just wondered.

598
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,811
Jonas?

599
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:45,610
Jonas?!

600
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:48,276
Jonas, where are you?

601
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:51,218
Jonas?!

602
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:53,415
Jonas, what are you doing
in this room?

603
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,151
I was just...
I was just...

604
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,056
I told you never to come
in here again.

605
00:32:57,093 --> 00:32:58,060
I was only looking!

606
00:32:58,094 --> 00:32:59,083
Looking?
Looking for what?

607
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:00,289
There's nothing here anymore.

608
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,522
I want to see my brother.

609
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,031
You can't see him.
He's gone.

610
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,226
Your brother is gone.

611
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:05,325
The past is gone.

612
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,427
This room has nothing
to do with our lives now,

613
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,870
so get out and don't let me
catch you in here again.

614
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,100
No! No! I only want to see.

615
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,335
Come on out of here.

616
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,399
Let me go! Let me go!

617
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:14,671
You little...

618
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:16,679
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!

619
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:20,376
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!

620
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,384
Someday I'll kill you!

621
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,943
Someday I'll kill you!

622
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:29,450
Now, now, Mr. Jonas.

623
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:31,722
Just be quiet.

624
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,786
Take it easy.

625
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,493
Everything's going
to be all right.

626
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:40,469
Now, just come out of there.

627
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:43,063
Now, you know you shouldn't
go in there.

628
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,404
All it does is upset you,
to no purpose.

629
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,669
Come on.

630
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:48,574
I know, Jedediah.

631
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,942
Come on now.

632
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:51,446
Take it easy.

633
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:56,750
I know.

634
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,749
Hi.

635
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,126
Hi.

636
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:44,725
I'm going to change into
a flannel shirt and be natural.

637
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:58,747
Now, tell me

638
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:01,409
why did you want to come down
here tonight?

639
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,783
Because you were
going to be here.

640
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:08,184
Oh, let me button it.

641
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,192
I'm not helpless.

642
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:12,592
I want to do it.

643
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,358
My chest is already buttoned.

644
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,736
How old are you, Nevada?

645
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,863
You want the truth?

646
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,931
Not if a lie
is more interesting.

647
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:29,911
Born 1882. That makes me 43.

648
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:31,777
You look 30.

649
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:32,906
How old are you?

650
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:33,916
20.

651
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,975
You look 30.

652
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,880
We're the same generation.

653
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:44,451
Ma'am, do you always
talk with your body?

654
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:50,194
It speaks several languages,
fluently.

655
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:53,168
Mine's downright illiterate.

656
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:56,603
By morning, I'll have you
speaking like a native.

657
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:00,700
Ma'am...

658
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:04,304
we're taking different
trails out of here.

659
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:06,577
Let's still end up
liking each other, huh?

660
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,449
No sense of humor.

661
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:19,018
I came here to forget
all that's happened

662
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:22,896
and to have a high old time,
like after a roundup.

663
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,059
I'll sober up a little bit,

664
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,228
get myself a good honest job.

665
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:28,736
No problems.

666
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:31,171
No problems.

667
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:32,674
No trouble.

668
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,199
No trouble.

669
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:36,939
So I recommend you act your age

670
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,969
and I'll act mine.

671
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:42,144
That's a wonderful idea.

672
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:45,882
I haven't acted my age in years.

673
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,549
Ought to be fun.

674
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:59,765
You know, another time,
another place,

675
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,100
you might be just
the woman for me.

676
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,929
Sure.

677
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:10,237
During the next couple
of years,

678
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:14,404
Jonas started writing that
chapter of history for himself--

679
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:16,244
burning the Cord brand

680
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:19,979
on every factory and rooftop
he could buy or build.

681
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:24,615
Nevada's Wild West show
was too much fun to make money.

682
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:27,217
After the Sheriff padlocked it
in California,

683
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,228
the only place his kind
of cowboy was needed

684
00:37:29,262 --> 00:37:31,025
was in the movies.

685
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:35,432
That's all. Right here.
That's all.

686
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:38,494
Rina just naturally headed
for the place

687
00:37:38,538 --> 00:37:41,063
with the most action-- Paris,

688
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:45,009
and helped give
the Lost Generation its name.

689
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:47,911
They have a great
downhill slide there,

690
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:51,974
greased with fancy men,
fancy clothes

691
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:54,145
and absinthe.

692
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,825
Vive la...I

693
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,762
Vitel Vitel Vitel

694
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:12,896
Vive la France!

695
00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:02,546
We're way out in front, Buzz.

696
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:05,182
1  hours and 29 minutes,
and we're almost home.

697
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,852
lf nothing happens,
we've not only won the race,

698
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:10,691
we've got us another mail
contract from Uncle Sam.

699
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,027
We've got more than that.

700
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:13,190
We got a new business.

701
00:39:13,232 --> 00:39:14,199
What new business?

702
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:15,393
Passengers.

703
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:16,401
Six at a time?

704
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:17,732
There's no money in that.

705
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,737
20 at a time.

706
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:20,238
With what airplane,
you dreamer?

707
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:23,366
With the new Cord passenger
plane we're going to build.

708
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:26,003
Where you going to build it,
in your backyard?

709
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:27,205
We'll buy a factory.

710
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:30,374
Oh, sure, go buy Lockheed,
Martin or Curtis Wright.

711
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,816
Only you better find
a gold mine first.

712
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:36,720
Of course, I hear that Winthrop
Aviation is having trouble.

713
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:39,486
There is no Winthrop Aviation.

714
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:41,425
Take a look down there.

715
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,398
What's this thing you have

716
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:51,266
for painting
your name on rooftops?

717
00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:54,603
I'd paint it higher

718
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,972
but skywriting's
too impermanent.

719
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:06,707
Congratulations.

720
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:08,686
You've won yourself
a race, Mr. Cord.

721
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:10,518
I've won something that
last's longer than that--

722
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:11,523
a new mail contract.

723
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:12,524
How do you feel?

724
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:13,525
Numb.

725
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,526
Richer.

726
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,857
Is it true that you now
own Winthrop Aviation?

727
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:17,021
Cord Aviation.

728
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,621
Are you going to build
military planes?

729
00:40:18,664 --> 00:40:19,631
Passenger planes.

730
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:20,962
A year from now,
I'll be flying passengers

731
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,967
coast to coast in 24 hours.

732
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,595
Think of all the sleep you can
lose traveling that fast.

733
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,195
Are you trying to corner
the world, Mr. Cord?

734
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:27,205
There's an idea.

735
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:29,230
Mr. Cord, why is it
you're not married?

736
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:30,708
Why aren't you a millionaire?

737
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:31,869
Just lucky, I guess.

738
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:33,173
Me, too.
Let's go, Jedediah.

739
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:34,577
What's his rush?

740
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:38,913
It’s the world
that's turning too slow.

741
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:41,784
Jonas, you need a week off...

742
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:43,015
a month off.

743
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:47,189
Otto Strauss in Berlin

744
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:50,491
came up with a new high-speed
plastics injection mold.

745
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:52,622
I cabled him an offer,
he accepted.

746
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,428
That's how much
money we need.

747
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:56,492
You better hightail it
to New York

748
00:40:56,535 --> 00:40:58,127
and make the arrangements.

749
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,569
We're moving too fast.

750
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:01,072
By whose clock?

751
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:02,802
I spend half my time
borrowing money.

752
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,434
Which we pay back.

753
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:06,069
And every year
a new business.

754
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:07,636
It’s called growth, Mac.

755
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,410
Maybe, but we're
so cross-collateralized--

756
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:13,282
so interdependent,
that if one business goes,

757
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:15,216
the others might go with it.

758
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:16,619
Don't let one go.

759
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:20,056
Why don't we buy a hotel
with lots of beds.

760
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:21,286
That's an idea.

761
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:23,022
Make a note of that, Mac.

762
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:30,765
You'd better get some rest.

763
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:32,270
Sure.

764
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:34,101
You get right down
to the station.

765
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,903
Take the first
train to New York.

766
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:36,908
Tonight?

767
00:41:36,942 --> 00:41:38,671
I haven't even packed a bag.

768
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:40,508
That's a hundred-dollar suit.

769
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,241
It ought to keep its press.

770
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,647
Jedediah, let Mr. Dalton
sleep...

771
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:46,310
all the way back
to the factory.

772
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:47,785
Right, sir.

773
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,741
I thought this
was a private bar.

774
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:45,767
That's what makes
it so attractive.

775
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:51,709
Mmm.

776
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,016
Now, how in this world
did you ever guess?

777
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:02,716
Wingspread 37, fuselage 25...

778
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:04,752
and hand-rubbed, by the way.

779
00:43:04,797 --> 00:43:07,823
Tail assembly 36,
shockproof landing gear

780
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,391
and never stalls in a dive.

781
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:11,027
Well, come in for a landing.

782
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,401
Tell me what you want.

783
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:15,407
Well, to be straightforward
about the whole thing

784
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:16,874
I'm a newspaperman.

785
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:18,968
You can get arrested
in those clothes.

786
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:21,036
I was using
the generic term.

787
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,411
That's a relief.

788
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:23,745
What paper?

789
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:25,579
Oh, it's just a
little scandal sheet

790
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:28,178
called the Star Telegram
Picayune Times Bulletin.

791
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,448
Show me your press pass.

792
00:43:29,488 --> 00:43:31,615
Oh, no.

793
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:33,056
You don't get to see that

794
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:34,719
until after I get the story.

795
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,988
Well, what do
you want to know?

796
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,017
How much money do I have?

797
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:38,689
How does it feel to run
ten corporations

798
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:40,631
or what speed record
am I going to break next?

799
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,293
Heaven's no.

800
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:45,303
I leave stuffy old things
like that to the city editor.

801
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:46,530
I'm strictly feature.

802
00:43:46,572 --> 00:43:48,062
I go for the offbeat story.

803
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:49,131
Like?

804
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:53,304
Like, what do you
sleep in at night?

805
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:55,609
Depends on how lucky I am.

806
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:59,584
Well, now, who would you
most like to be stranded

807
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:01,586
on a desert island with?

808
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,056
The world's greatest
boat builder.

809
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,992
Let me put it this way--

810
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:13,362
which do you prefer,
quantity or quality.

811
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:15,390
Do I have a choice?

812
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:17,265
We're known as
a liberal newspaper.

813
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,930
Ma'am, you have
just won yourself

814
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:24,238
an exclusive
full-page layout.

815
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,008
It’s probably just
my city editor.

816
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,881
I'll disguise my voice.

817
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:36,752
Mr. Cord's suite.

818
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:39,519
Who is this?

819
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:42,356
It’s my father.

820
00:44:47,466 --> 00:44:49,263
Jonas Cord.

821
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:51,292
Who's the dame, Jonas?

822
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:53,837
It’s a body I picked up
at a rental agency.

823
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:55,169
Ah!

824
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:58,540
They said you wanted to see me.

825
00:44:58,577 --> 00:45:00,477
I do.

826
00:45:00,512 --> 00:45:01,774
Okay, I'll be right up.

827
00:45:01,814 --> 00:45:04,408
Uh-uh. I'll be right down.

828
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,887
Well, we can't very well
meet here in the lobby.

829
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:10,479
Okay, I need a shave anyway.

830
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:12,922
I'll meet you in
the second floor washroom.

831
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:19,764
You knew he was coming.

832
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:23,256
Yeah, but I didn't
know you were.

833
00:45:23,302 --> 00:45:24,667
Yes, you did.

834
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:27,263
lf you'll excuse me,
I have to get my razor

835
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:28,603
and $25,000.

836
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,005
Is that all, Jonas?

837
00:45:33,178 --> 00:45:35,009
Yes, that's all, Monica.

838
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:38,278
Did you come here thinking
there'd be more?

839
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:40,944
Jonas...

840
00:45:44,757 --> 00:45:46,156
Try to do it nicely.

841
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:50,423
I mean, give him something
to walk away with besides money.

842
00:45:50,462 --> 00:45:54,023
lf he doesn't try
to con me, I will.

843
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:55,931
Jonas.

844
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:57,230
Do you need him, Monica?

845
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:00,261
No.

846
00:46:00,305 --> 00:46:02,296
I did when I was little,

847
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:05,174
but he never had
any time for me.

848
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,475
And now I've got my own
money and my own life...

849
00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:10,709
and you.

850
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:12,410
What else do I need?

851
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:14,919
Well, you see
the truth is, Jonas,

852
00:46:14,953 --> 00:46:16,784
I need another $10,000.

853
00:46:16,822 --> 00:46:17,982
What happened to all the money

854
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,251
you got when you sold the stock?

855
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:20,256
Well, it's gone.

856
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:22,259
Creditors, ex-wives, judgments.

857
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:23,919
You know how much I owed.

858
00:46:23,962 --> 00:46:26,226
Amos, your contract
doesn't provide

859
00:46:26,265 --> 00:46:27,732
for advances like this.

860
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:30,997
I know, but this is important.

861
00:46:31,036 --> 00:46:33,266
Won't happen again, I promise.

862
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:36,274
It’s... it's for Monica.

863
00:46:36,308 --> 00:46:37,673
Monica?

864
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:39,108
What about her?

865
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:42,545
Well, I want to send her to her
mother in England.

866
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:45,914
She's getting too much
for me to handle, Jonas.

867
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:49,284
She's seeing some
playboy on the sly,

868
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:53,222
and... well, he's
teaching her bad habits.

869
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:56,227
Do you know who he is?

870
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:58,229
I wish I did.

871
00:46:58,263 --> 00:47:00,697
I'd kill him
with my bare hands.

872
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:06,193
A nice, sweet, innocent
kid like her.

873
00:47:06,238 --> 00:47:08,638
I've got to get
her away from him.

874
00:47:08,674 --> 00:47:10,198
You ever talk to her?

875
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:13,643
I've tried, but you know
how kids are nowadays.

876
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,341
Give them everything
and get nothing.

877
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:18,747
Hmm. You could try
being a father.

878
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:21,685
What the hell makes you
such an expert?!

879
00:47:23,856 --> 00:47:28,350
Wait till you get
kids of your own.

880
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:30,258
Now, what about
the money, Jonas?

881
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:32,627
It’s important to me
and Monica, and...

882
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:36,862
All right, I'll give
it to you, Amos.

883
00:47:36,902 --> 00:47:41,965
As a matter of fact,
I'll give you $25,000...

884
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:44,669
on one condition.

885
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,372
Why sure. Sure,
anything you say, Jonas.

886
00:47:47,412 --> 00:47:49,744
I want your resignation.

887
00:47:56,822 --> 00:48:01,418
You mean... from
Winthrop Aviation?

888
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,429
From Cord Aviation.

889
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:06,795
But I founded the company!

890
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:09,232
I can help you make it grow.

891
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:10,598
Take the money, Amos.

892
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:12,763
No!

893
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:15,671
No, that, that factory is me.

894
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:20,201
I laid out every machine,
the production, technique...

895
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,008
Take the money, Amos.

896
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:25,608
Like hell I'll take it.

897
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:30,953
I won't sell my life
for $25,000.

898
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:33,116
lf you spend it carefully,

899
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:36,252
it'll keep you in booze
for ten years.

900
00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:37,762
Oh, Jonas.

901
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:42,923
Please.

902
00:48:42,968 --> 00:48:45,960
One day you'll need help, too.

903
00:48:46,004 --> 00:48:50,532
lf I do, I won't bargain
with anything as precious

904
00:48:50,576 --> 00:48:53,374
as my only daughter to get it.

905
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:31,372
Did he take it?

906
00:49:31,413 --> 00:49:32,778
Yes.

907
00:49:32,814 --> 00:49:34,748
It won't last him long.

908
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:36,842
It should if he's smart.

909
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:39,854
All he understands
is machinery and production.

910
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:41,378
Not people.
Not even himself.

911
00:49:41,423 --> 00:49:46,019
A perfect description
of the late Jonas Cord, Sr.

912
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:47,460
No mothers, no home life,

913
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:49,191
fathers too busy with business.

914
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:51,461
You know, when you
think about it Jonas,

915
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,127
we're really very much alike.

916
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,969
But you're prettier.

917
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:01,373
But you're more exciting.

918
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:11,210
What are your plans, Monica?

919
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:12,584
Plans?

920
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:13,713
I don't know. Play?

921
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:15,222
Burn the candle at both ends

922
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:17,691
while I still got something
to light it with.

923
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:18,693
Who knows?

924
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:19,955
Maybe like my father

925
00:50:19,995 --> 00:50:21,519
I'll get paid off one day

926
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:23,531
and disappear into the woodwork.

927
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,260
Unless you find somebody.

928
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,996
I already have.

929
00:50:28,036 --> 00:50:30,334
But what can a gold miner
offer the gold,

930
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:31,929
except maybe a pretty pan

931
00:50:31,973 --> 00:50:34,100
and even that tarnishes fast.

932
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,480
What's the wildest thing
you've ever done?

933
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:42,881
I was hoping
I hadn't done it yet.

934
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,050
You know all the answers

935
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:47,749
to interest a man, don't you?

936
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:50,952
No. Only when I'm lucky enough

937
00:50:50,992 --> 00:50:53,927
to get the right questions.

938
00:50:53,962 --> 00:50:56,829
Go ahead. Ask me something.

939
00:50:56,865 --> 00:51:00,858
Something I can't answer.

940
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:02,699
Go on. I dare you.

941
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:12,309
-Good-bye.
-Good luck.

942
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:16,842
Sorry.

943
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:18,147
Congratulations.

944
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:19,153
Cold?

945
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:20,176
Mm, scared.

946
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:23,589
I can't believe it happened.

947
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,149
What do I tell'em, mister?

948
00:51:25,193 --> 00:51:26,888
Back to the airport.

949
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:29,123
What'd you like to see
on your honeymoon?

950
00:51:29,164 --> 00:51:32,327
Lots of lovely ceilings.

951
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,975
Merci beaucoup.

952
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,283
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi.

953
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:35,096
Excuse me.

954
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,065
This is probably
a foolish question.

955
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,761
You're not by any chance
a Miss Marlowe, are you?

956
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:44,533
This is probably a foolish
answer, but yes.

957
00:52:46,274 --> 00:52:48,538
Forget-me-nots.
That's for the D.A.R.

958
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:51,808
You're strictly long-stemmed,
American Beauty roses.

959
00:52:51,846 --> 00:52:54,076
Well, they're lovely anyway.

960
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:57,141
Nevada said
a very old friend of his.

961
00:52:57,185 --> 00:52:59,119
I was expecting to meet
his first grade school teacher.

962
00:52:59,154 --> 00:53:00,678
Well, on the way into town

963
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,849
I'll give you
a lesson in geography.

964
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:05,655
I think I've already had one.

965
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:08,094
Well, this way, please,
to the wheelchair.

966
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,530
All aboard!

967
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,107
My, my.

968
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:23,201
This is the first 12-cylinder
steer I've ever seen.

969
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:24,212
Fabulous, isn't it?

970
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:25,213
Designed it myself.

971
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,272
Whenever Nevada Smith
rolls through town

972
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:29,510
they know he's somebody
important.

973
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,212
Just think what you
could have done

974
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:32,345
for Abraham Lincoln.

975
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:37,285
How about this interior?

976
00:53:37,325 --> 00:53:39,190
Just run your hand
over that leather.

977
00:53:39,227 --> 00:53:40,194
Isn't that nice?

978
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,321
Feel like I've been
swallowed by a buffalo.

979
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,022
Showmanship-- public eats it up.

980
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,089
After all, Nevada Smith's

981
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,067
just about the most important
thing in movies.

982
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:49,036
Kids all over the country
are crazy about him.

983
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,731
He does all his own
stunts, you know?

984
00:53:55,577 --> 00:53:56,703
Tell me something.

985
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:57,712
Mm-hmm.

986
00:53:57,746 --> 00:53:58,770
Who are you?

987
00:53:58,813 --> 00:54:00,804
Oh, now, honey,
come on.

988
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:03,647
I'm Dan Pierce.

989
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:05,880
I'm Nevada's agent,
his manager.

990
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,720
Yes, I-I get him pictures,
make his deals, bank his money,

991
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:11,988
and, well, handle him,
personally.

992
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:13,392
I get ten percent.

993
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,760
That is, of everything
he gets.

994
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:18,823
Let me ask you,
Mister, uh...

995
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:20,960
Pierce. Dan Pierce.

996
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:24,631
Do you handle everybody,
personally?

997
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:27,437
Only those who show
possibilities.

998
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:29,636
Here, I'll trade these
for a drink.

999
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:36,811
lf we get arrested

1000
00:54:36,851 --> 00:54:39,115
I hope they put us
in the same cell.

1001
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,122
Do the kids know
about that?

1002
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:43,249
Oh, no. No,
we carry milk in here

1003
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,656
on personal appearances.

1004
00:54:44,693 --> 00:54:47,025
You see, Nevada never drinks
at a picture

1005
00:54:47,062 --> 00:54:48,723
and he never kisses
the girl.

1006
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:51,459
I guess that's the real
reason I never became

1007
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:52,898
a cowboy star.

1008
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:02,966
Here, I saved
ten percent for you.

1009
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,342
Well, thanks.

1010
00:55:06,915 --> 00:55:09,406
Say, do you mind
if I ask you

1011
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:11,112
a rather personal question?

1012
00:55:11,152 --> 00:55:13,086
Not at all.

1013
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:15,885
What is your, uh, relationship
to Nevada Smith?

1014
00:55:15,924 --> 00:55:17,482
Oh, nothing important.

1015
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:22,225
I'm going to marry him.

1016
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,888
Reach!

1017
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:59,422
Don't shoot.
I'm innocent.

1018
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:00,434
Innocent?

1019
00:56:00,468 --> 00:56:02,732
I thought you were
Rina Marlowe.

1020
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:04,966
Nevada.

1021
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:06,997
Oh, Nevada!

1022
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:12,846
Welcome home, Rina.

1023
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:15,941
Nobody in the world
thought about me but you.

1024
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:18,578
The money, tickets, love,
everything.

1025
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,714
Robin Hood
of the Rio Grande-- that's me.

1026
00:56:21,756 --> 00:56:22,984
Are those guns loaded?

1027
00:56:23,024 --> 00:56:23,991
Let's see.

1028
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:26,050
Oh!

1029
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:27,288
Blanks.

1030
00:56:27,328 --> 00:56:28,920
Now I'll ride off
into the sunset

1031
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:30,954
if I can find
dark glasses for my horse.

1032
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:32,227
What's your hurry,
partner?

1033
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,292
Isn't there
some generous way

1034
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:37,099
a lonesome widow
can show her gratitude?

1035
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:38,298
As a matter of fact,
there is.

1036
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:39,306
Got any buttermilk?

1037
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,307
Buttermilk?

1038
00:56:40,341 --> 00:56:43,469
Whatever happened
to bottles of red-eye

1039
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:44,944
dance hall girls?

1040
00:56:44,979 --> 00:56:46,412
That's the villains.

1041
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:47,847
I'm strictly a hero.

1042
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:50,112
I can believe it.

1043
00:56:50,151 --> 00:56:52,711
That outfit, this house

1044
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:55,917
that car of yours.

1045
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,858
I just try to act out
people's dreams:

1046
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:01,623
purity over passion,
goodness over evil.

1047
00:57:01,663 --> 00:57:02,652
But evil can be fun.

1048
00:57:02,697 --> 00:57:05,188
Oh, not when Nevada rides.

1049
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:08,202
Killing, yes, but kissing, no.

1050
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:12,236
How did it all happen?

1051
00:57:12,273 --> 00:57:15,970
Oh, I joined a Wild West show
that folded in Los Angeles.

1052
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,944
I became an extra, did stunts

1053
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:22,075
and people started
writing in about me

1054
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:23,083
and here I am.

1055
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:25,017
Do you like it?

1056
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:28,284
Yes, I do. It’s fun.

1057
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:31,382
Nobody gets hurt,
and maybe it helps a little.

1058
00:57:31,426 --> 00:57:34,589
Do you ever see Jonas?

1059
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,221
Talk about success.

1060
00:57:36,264 --> 00:57:40,792
There's a man who's going
to end up running the world.

1061
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:47,766
You can't ride, fly,
shoot a gun, mail a letter,

1062
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:51,267
make a phone call,
or drink a cup of coffee

1063
00:57:51,312 --> 00:57:54,179
that Jonas doesn't have
something to do with it.

1064
00:57:54,215 --> 00:57:56,183
But you never see him?

1065
00:57:56,217 --> 00:58:03,055
No. In the same town,
but different worlds.

1066
00:58:03,091 --> 00:58:04,149
You know he's married?

1067
00:58:07,562 --> 00:58:08,529
I didn't.

1068
00:58:08,563 --> 00:58:10,428
I heard he spent his honeymoon

1069
00:58:10,465 --> 00:58:12,990
going from one of his factories
to another,

1070
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:15,400
making new business deals
with bankers.

1071
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:21,032
Something borrowed,
something blue.

1072
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:24,010
Poor girl.

1073
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:27,276
So, let's forget him.

1074
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:30,716
It’s the hero's night off.

1075
00:58:30,752 --> 00:58:34,210
And for once, he's going
to let the lonesome widow

1076
00:58:34,255 --> 00:58:35,779
be properly grateful.

1077
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,455
Properly?

1078
00:58:41,496 --> 00:58:43,555
Not if I know the widow,

1079
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:46,465
and I do.

1080
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:50,164
Can you really forget Jonas?

1081
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:52,001
Jonas who?

1082
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,065
The only Jonas I ever heard of

1083
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:56,042
was swallowed by a whale.

1084
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:57,806
It’s the only thing
big enough

1085
00:58:57,845 --> 00:58:58,946
to take his ego.

1086
00:58:58,946 --> 00:58:59,742
to take his ego.

1087
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,247
lf my calculations
are correct,

1088
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:03,249
we should be able
to carry 20 passengers,

1089
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:05,147
in addition to the
pilot and copilot,

1090
00:59:05,185 --> 00:59:06,777
at a cruising speed
of about 250.

1091
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,549
Should be able
to fly for seven hours

1092
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:10,523
before refueling,
depending on the wind.

1093
00:59:10,557 --> 00:59:12,855
Fly from here to New York
with only two stopovers?

1094
00:59:12,893 --> 00:59:13,882
I don't believe it.

1095
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,952
What would it cost
to build the first one?

1096
00:59:15,996 --> 00:59:16,963
400-$500,000.

1097
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:18,828
A half a million bucks
for one airplane?

1098
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:20,730
Who do you think we are,
the government?

1099
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:21,756
You guys are nuts.

1100
00:59:21,802 --> 00:59:23,736
We'll never make
our money out of this.

1101
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:26,500
First-class passage,
coast to coast by train

1102
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,771
with compartment, meals
and tips comes to over $250

1103
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,107
and takes four full days.

1104
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:33,738
This plane can carry passengers
the same distance

1105
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,749
at the same cost in one day
and save three working days.

1106
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,614
Build it.

1107
00:59:38,652 --> 00:59:40,984
As stockholder who owns
half the stock--

1108
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:42,955
that's me--
just cancel that order.

1109
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,685
Cord Chemicals owns
the other half

1110
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:46,886
and also holds over
half a million dollars

1111
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:48,792
in mortgages
on International planes,

1112
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:50,729
most of which are
past due right now.

1113
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:56,225
You want to foreclose now,
make it official.

1114
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:57,429
You're a great pilot, Buzz.

1115
00:59:57,471 --> 00:59:59,632
You'd risk your life with
a quart of gas over the Rockies.

1116
00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:00,640
Now don't freeze up

1117
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:02,107
when I throw
a few figures at you.

1118
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:08,044
I should
have known better, Jonas.

1119
01:00:08,081 --> 01:00:09,776
I should have learned
my lesson

1120
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,306
when I lost that Waco to you

1121
01:00:11,418 --> 01:00:12,851
in a poker game.

1122
01:00:12,886 --> 01:00:14,911
Let me gamble the money.

1123
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:16,547
I'll make you rich.

1124
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:17,921
Fate it, shake'em and roll.

1125
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,449
They told me this was
where the action was.

1126
01:00:20,494 --> 01:00:22,257
Why, Mrs. Cord, good evening.

1127
01:00:22,295 --> 01:00:23,489
Mr. Morrissey, Buzz.

1128
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,519
Hi, Monica.

1129
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:25,656
What brings you down here?

1130
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:26,859
Oh, I don't know.

1131
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,300
The dishes were all done
and Amos and Andy was over.

1132
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:31,270
I'll have these duplicated
in the morning.

1133
01:00:31,304 --> 01:00:32,999
Don't let me break up
the conference.

1134
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,007
No, we were through.

1135
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,339
I'll think I'll go home
and wash my one shirt

1136
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:37,343
in case we lose it.

1137
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:39,641
Go home and order a silk one.

1138
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,908
As soon as we finish
this plane,

1139
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:42,744
we're going to start
designing another one--

1140
01:00:42,783 --> 01:00:46,150
40 passengers,
meals served on board.

1141
01:00:46,186 --> 01:00:49,280
That's what I was
really afraid of, Jonas.

1142
01:00:49,322 --> 01:00:51,347
Good night, all.

1143
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:54,291
Oh, good night,
Mrs. Cord, Mr. Cord.

1144
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:55,351
Good night.

1145
01:00:58,432 --> 01:01:00,263
The car's outside, darling.

1146
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,528
Want a ride home?

1147
01:01:01,568 --> 01:01:02,796
Mm, I'd like to...

1148
01:01:02,836 --> 01:01:03,860
Oh, good.

1149
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:05,303
...but I have to go
to the laboratory.

1150
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:07,067
Get them started
building a wind tunnel.

1151
01:01:07,107 --> 01:01:08,165
Tonight?

1152
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,232
Yeah.

1153
01:01:09,276 --> 01:01:13,212
I have to fly to Washington.

1154
01:01:13,246 --> 01:01:15,680
I'm building a plane to carry
passengers coast to coast,

1155
01:01:15,716 --> 01:01:17,445
and I haven't even got
a franchise yet.

1156
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:19,008
Ready to go?

1157
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:21,145
Not this time, Jonas.

1158
01:01:22,923 --> 01:01:23,912
Why not?

1159
01:01:23,957 --> 01:01:25,185
Why me?

1160
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:28,092
Only bride I know
who spent her entire honeymoon

1161
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:29,254
at 5,000 feet,

1162
01:01:29,296 --> 01:01:33,062
who's always airsick
instead of morning sick.

1163
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,830
I am an earthling.

1164
01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:36,893
Haven't you noticed?

1165
01:01:36,937 --> 01:01:40,270
Lovely valleys,
beautiful mountains.

1166
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:43,105
Then cut your motor.

1167
01:01:43,143 --> 01:01:46,442
Come in. Have fun.

1168
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,243
I thought we had fun.

1169
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:53,947
In between oxygen masks,
chemical samples and bankers.

1170
01:01:53,987 --> 01:01:56,251
You really must learn

1171
01:01:56,289 --> 01:01:59,258
to take one thing
at a time.

1172
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:02,659
For example, take me.

1173
01:02:02,696 --> 01:02:06,257
Any time, any place.

1174
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:08,859
Home, now.

1175
01:02:08,902 --> 01:02:10,767
I can't.

1176
01:02:10,804 --> 01:02:13,034
You sure?

1177
01:02:21,448 --> 01:02:22,574
Yeah?

1178
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:27,453
Put her on.

1179
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:29,045
It’s my father's widow.

1180
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:32,822
Hello, Rina.

1181
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:34,588
I thought you were in Europe.

1182
01:02:34,628 --> 01:02:37,028
Yes, I did.

1183
01:02:37,063 --> 01:02:40,328
We all were.

1184
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,868
What kind of trouble?

1185
01:02:42,903 --> 01:02:44,598
Hold it, hold it.

1186
01:02:44,638 --> 01:02:47,436
Look, where can I
meet you tonight?

1187
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:49,840
I'll see you there
in half an hour.

1188
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:52,945
Come on, I'll drop you off
at the hotel.

1189
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:54,674
A minute ago,
nothing in the world

1190
01:02:54,714 --> 01:02:57,239
could have kept you
from flying off on business.

1191
01:02:57,284 --> 01:02:59,548
The money vultures
are after Nevada Smith.

1192
01:03:01,555 --> 01:03:04,319
Oh.

1193
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,462
My name's Cord.

1194
01:03:18,505 --> 01:03:20,200
Where's the commissary?

1195
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,174
Straight ahead, Mr. Cord.

1196
01:03:59,546 --> 01:04:01,707
Hello, Rina.

1197
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,145
Hello, Jonas.

1198
01:04:06,186 --> 01:04:09,121
This is Mr. Ellis, the director.

1199
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:10,417
How do you do?

1200
01:04:10,457 --> 01:04:11,549
Mr. Cord.

1201
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:13,149
lf you'll excuse us
for a minute.

1202
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:14,592
Sure.

1203
01:04:33,513 --> 01:04:35,504
Congratulations.

1204
01:04:35,548 --> 01:04:37,277
Your bride's
a very pretty girl.

1205
01:04:37,317 --> 01:04:40,309
You said Nevada
was in trouble.

1206
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,149
How much trouble?

1207
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:44,588
Two million dollars worth.

1208
01:04:44,624 --> 01:04:47,024
I heard he was doing great,
making half a million a year.

1209
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,029
He was, but...

1210
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:53,931
Well, Nevada wanted to make
a picture his own way.

1211
01:04:53,967 --> 01:04:56,959
Put up everything he owned
for the chance.

1212
01:04:57,003 --> 01:04:58,595
Then something went wrong

1213
01:04:58,638 --> 01:05:00,799
and they don't want
to release it.

1214
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,205
Is it a stinker?

1215
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:05,439
I don't really know.

1216
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:07,469
They told him
that the theaters

1217
01:05:07,514 --> 01:05:09,709
would only play
talking pictures.

1218
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:11,979
Now the bank's
calling his loan

1219
01:05:12,018 --> 01:05:14,851
and that big operator
Bernard B. Norman

1220
01:05:14,888 --> 01:05:17,049
won't advance
any more money.

1221
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,615
I see.

1222
01:05:19,659 --> 01:05:22,093
Jonas, you've got to help him.

1223
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:23,493
I haven't got to do anything.

1224
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,929
One time you wanted something

1225
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:26,057
and he gave it to you.

1226
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:28,192
His Cord Chemical stock?

1227
01:05:28,234 --> 01:05:30,896
It didn't cost him $2 million.

1228
01:05:30,937 --> 01:05:32,768
What's it worth now?

1229
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:37,505
Close.

1230
01:05:37,544 --> 01:05:40,172
Rina and Mr. Ellis
showed me the picture.

1231
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:41,510
Max Sand.

1232
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:45,177
The going away present
you gave to me.

1233
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:47,277
I put it in a script.

1234
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,685
Wait a minute.

1235
01:05:48,722 --> 01:05:52,317
Something, uh...
here I don't understand?

1236
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:53,826
It’s a private joke.

1237
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,294
Why did you withdraw
your guarantee, Mr. Norman?

1238
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:58,729
Because he's a thieving,
unprincipled, son of a...

1239
01:05:58,765 --> 01:06:00,790
Please, please,
now let's deal in business

1240
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:01,892
and not personalities.

1241
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:02,924
Anger is for fools.

1242
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:04,459
You call ruining
a man's life business?

1243
01:06:04,504 --> 01:06:05,801
I'm not ruining anybody's life.

1244
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,739
This is gambling-- some days
we win, some days we lose.

1245
01:06:07,774 --> 01:06:09,366
You're the richest loser
I know, I know that.

1246
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:11,172
Look at him, the biggest
star you have on the lot.

1247
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:12,872
-Biggest cowboy star...
-Your bread and butter.

1248
01:06:12,912 --> 01:06:14,402
I make other pictures,
you know.

1249
01:06:14,447 --> 01:06:16,142
Art pictures that
don't make a dime.

1250
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:18,275
They add dignity and culture
to the business.

1251
01:06:18,385 --> 01:06:20,444
They add three starlets
a week to your bed.

1252
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:22,785
I don't have to listen
to this flesh-peddler.

1253
01:06:22,822 --> 01:06:24,585
Listen, let's sit down.

1254
01:06:24,624 --> 01:06:26,683
Let's sit down.
Mr. Pierce...

1255
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:34,493
Now, why did you withdraw
your guarantee, Mr. Norman?

1256
01:06:34,534 --> 01:06:36,161
Talking pictures, that's why.

1257
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:38,762
I can't sell The Renegade's Coat
for peanuts.

1258
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:41,000
Why didn't you make
a talking picture?

1259
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:43,236
I didn't think sound
was here to stay.

1260
01:06:43,276 --> 01:06:44,402
Who did?

1261
01:06:44,444 --> 01:06:46,275
What happens to the picture now?

1262
01:06:46,312 --> 01:06:48,212
You just throw it
in the ash can?

1263
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:51,615
Maybe we can salvage
a few pennies out of it--

1264
01:06:51,651 --> 01:06:54,313
South America,
Australia... who knows.

1265
01:06:54,354 --> 01:06:57,221
It still leaves Nevada
out in the cold.

1266
01:06:57,257 --> 01:06:59,589
My heart bleeds
for him-- truly.

1267
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:01,423
Oh, I think
I'm going to be sick.

1268
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:03,258
Take it easy, Dan,
I asked for it.

1269
01:07:03,296 --> 01:07:06,561
Well, you didn't ask to
get your pockets picked.

1270
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,432
Mr. Cord, if you'll back Nevada
with your cash, this pirate here

1271
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:10,902
won't be able
to touch the picture.

1272
01:07:10,937 --> 01:07:13,371
Now we can't let him get away
with everything for nothing.

1273
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:15,840
Well...

1274
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,502
Go easy making up your mind,
Junior.

1275
01:07:17,544 --> 01:07:19,034
You could blow the whole bundle.

1276
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:21,047
Nevada, don't start talking him
out of it.

1277
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:25,279
Mr. Cord, I agree with Nevada.

1278
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:27,718
What do you know about
making talking pictures?

1279
01:07:27,754 --> 01:07:30,245
Nothing,
but right now, who does?

1280
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,384
How many talking pictures
have you made?

1281
01:07:35,695 --> 01:07:38,528
One.

1282
01:07:38,565 --> 01:07:42,467
I'll take the shot, Nevada,
on one condition:

1283
01:07:42,502 --> 01:07:44,129
it'll be strictly my picture.

1284
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,934
I give the orders
and everyone does as he's told,

1285
01:07:46,973 --> 01:07:48,873
including you.

1286
01:07:48,908 --> 01:07:50,136
If I'm going to lose a hand,

1287
01:07:50,176 --> 01:07:52,041
the least I want to do
is deal the cards.

1288
01:07:52,078 --> 01:07:54,979
Your father's favorite saying.

1289
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:57,107
Sorry I used it.

1290
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,447
Well?

1291
01:07:58,485 --> 01:07:59,884
It’s a deal.

1292
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:03,521
Don't think you've caught
yourself a sucker, Pierce.

1293
01:08:03,556 --> 01:08:05,183
By the time we finish
this picture,

1294
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:07,455
you're going to earn your 10º/º
three times over.

1295
01:08:07,494 --> 01:08:10,088
First, line up
all the good talkies there are.

1296
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,222
I want to see them.

1297
01:08:11,264 --> 01:08:12,993
And second, get the writers in.

1298
01:08:13,032 --> 01:08:15,262
We're going to start
redoing the script.

1299
01:08:15,368 --> 01:08:16,835
What's the matter with it?

1300
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,167
No women.

1301
01:08:18,204 --> 01:08:19,535
In the real West,

1302
01:08:19,572 --> 01:08:22,666
I heard there were
a number of them-- real women.

1303
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:24,506
The kind men
killed each other for...

1304
01:08:24,544 --> 01:08:26,102
robbed banks to buy.

1305
01:08:26,146 --> 01:08:29,411
The kind the real Max Sand
built a reputation satisfying.

1306
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:31,679
It’s time somebody
gave the West

1307
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:32,946
back to the grownups.

1308
01:08:32,986 --> 01:08:35,614
Anything else, Mr. Cord?

1309
01:08:35,655 --> 01:08:38,453
Mr. Norman, you'll
have to make room for us.

1310
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:41,016
Get the best sound man
in the business.

1311
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:43,621
And find a cameraman

1312
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:45,563
who'd rather photograph
women than horses

1313
01:08:45,598 --> 01:08:47,862
and a dress designer
who doesn't use much cloth.

1314
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:50,233
And, Nevada,
start looking like Max Sand.

1315
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,067
Go out
and get that suit dirty.

1316
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:53,402
Hello?

1317
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,703
Yes, Mr. Cord is here.

1318
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:58,643
Oh, just a moment.

1319
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:00,578
Your wife.

1320
01:09:00,613 --> 01:09:02,012
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1321
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:07,813
Yes?

1322
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:10,618
Now, don't tell me that was
your stepmother who answered.

1323
01:09:10,657 --> 01:09:12,557
As a matter of fact,
it was.

1324
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:16,619
A voice like that... I suppose
you've been spending the night

1325
01:09:16,663 --> 01:09:19,257
reminiscing about dad
and good ol' days.

1326
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:20,994
Monica, what do you want?

1327
01:09:21,034 --> 01:09:23,400
You, of course.

1328
01:09:23,436 --> 01:09:27,202
Darling,
when are you coming home?

1329
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,266
You know we have some
interrupted business.

1330
01:09:30,343 --> 01:09:31,867
I'm on my way
to the factory.

1331
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:33,742
I'll get in touch
with you later.

1332
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:38,510
Trouble in paradise?

1333
01:09:43,856 --> 01:09:45,448
Places, please!

1334
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:47,425
Quiet!
Come on, quiet down!

1335
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,054
Starting position!

1336
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:55,193
Sound ready!
Get ready to roll.

1337
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:56,429
Interlock.

1338
01:09:58,771 --> 01:10:00,602
Interlock okay.

1339
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,507
All right, roller!

1340
01:10:03,543 --> 01:10:05,807
Quiet, please!

1341
01:10:05,845 --> 01:10:09,645
Quiet. Action.

1342
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:12,014
I run a pretty big place here.

1343
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:15,043
Downstairs there's several
gaming rooms and three bars.

1344
01:10:15,088 --> 01:10:19,752
Upstairs we provide other,
uh, natural pleasures.

1345
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:22,124
With so much money,
drinking and passion

1346
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:23,321
under one roof,

1347
01:10:23,396 --> 01:10:25,626
there's some kind of
explosion every night.

1348
01:10:25,907 --> 01:10:27,169
I need a bodyguard.

1349
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,836
To replace the one
who got killed?

1350
01:10:29,878 --> 01:10:33,041
Well, uh, I hoped
you hadn't heard.

1351
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:35,845
But, uh, if you still
want the job...

1352
01:10:35,884 --> 01:10:38,944
I do.

1353
01:10:38,987 --> 01:10:43,390
My hours will be your hours,
and, uh, you'll live upstairs.

1354
01:10:43,425 --> 01:10:46,121
Uh, you'll collect $100 a month,
but no drinking.

1355
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:47,958
And the first time I catch you

1356
01:10:47,996 --> 01:10:50,692
sleeping in any other
room than your own...

1357
01:10:53,068 --> 01:10:56,094
All right. Cut. Cut.
Cut it!

1358
01:10:57,973 --> 01:10:59,167
Mr. Cord, what's wrong?

1359
01:10:59,207 --> 01:11:01,573
Her. Get her off the set.
She's fired.

1360
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:04,203
Just a minute, Mr. Cord.

1361
01:11:04,245 --> 01:11:06,076
Just a minute here!

1362
01:11:06,114 --> 01:11:07,638
What the hell is going on?

1363
01:11:07,682 --> 01:11:08,774
She can't be fired.

1364
01:11:08,817 --> 01:11:11,650
Miss Randall is the most
important star we have.

1365
01:11:11,686 --> 01:11:13,551
That's what you told me
and I believed you.

1366
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:15,646
I just had my first lesson
in this business:

1367
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,055
don't listen to you.

1368
01:11:17,092 --> 01:11:19,754
Now look here, Miss Randall
has a contract for this picture.

1369
01:11:19,794 --> 01:11:20,886
You know that.

1370
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:22,863
She must have signed it
in your bedroom.

1371
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:26,894
Listen, Sonny...
me, you can forget

1372
01:11:26,935 --> 01:11:29,870
but you owe Miss Randall a
public apology for that insult.

1373
01:11:29,904 --> 01:11:32,805
lf that woman
ran an immoral house

1374
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:34,741
she'd have to pay me.

1375
01:11:41,783 --> 01:11:43,478
Oh, Bernie-cuns!

1376
01:11:43,518 --> 01:11:44,712
Oh...

1377
01:11:44,753 --> 01:11:46,448
Bernie, baby...

1378
01:11:46,488 --> 01:11:48,718
Get away. Get away!

1379
01:11:48,757 --> 01:11:50,918
I'll give you five minutes
to get her off the set,

1380
01:11:50,959 --> 01:11:52,358
or I'll close down this picture

1381
01:11:52,394 --> 01:11:54,589
and hit you with the biggest
lawsuit you ever saw.

1382
01:11:54,662 --> 01:11:56,027
Mr. Cord...

1383
01:11:57,032 --> 01:11:58,090
Mr. Cord!

1384
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:02,128
I'll fix you for this.

1385
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,535
I'm not fooling.

1386
01:12:03,638 --> 01:12:06,539
One of these days, I'll fix you.

1387
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:08,233
You'll see... someday...

1388
01:12:08,276 --> 01:12:09,538
someday I'll fix you.

1389
01:12:09,577 --> 01:12:10,669
Get of my way!

1390
01:12:10,712 --> 01:12:11,838
I'll fix you!

1391
01:12:16,518 --> 01:12:17,849
Excuse me.

1392
01:12:20,155 --> 01:12:21,179
Sorry, no dice.

1393
01:12:21,222 --> 01:12:22,450
Marion Davies is working.

1394
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,082
Look, I've called everybody.

1395
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:26,150
Garbo's agent won't
even talk to us.

1396
01:12:26,194 --> 01:12:28,526
Sally Eilers, Ranee Adoree,
Clara Blore...

1397
01:12:28,563 --> 01:12:29,791
all of them, tied up.

1398
01:12:29,831 --> 01:12:31,731
Everybody seems
to be conveniently

1399
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:33,233
"occupied" at the moment.

1400
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:35,327
Why?

1401
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,964
Thought you might be hungry,
so I sent out for these.

1402
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:44,277
Would you like
something to eat?

1403
01:12:44,312 --> 01:12:45,404
What do you got?

1404
01:12:45,447 --> 01:12:47,847
Oh, tuna, ham and
cheese, chicken.

1405
01:12:47,882 --> 01:12:48,940
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

1406
01:12:48,983 --> 01:12:50,211
Say, I've got an idea.

1407
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:51,309
Maybe I should get
to New York

1408
01:12:51,352 --> 01:12:52,785
and start looking
for an actress there.

1409
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:54,049
We've got to have
somebody great.

1410
01:12:54,089 --> 01:12:57,547
Everyday we don't shoot,
it costs us a fortune.

1411
01:12:57,592 --> 01:12:58,957
What do you think?

1412
01:12:58,993 --> 01:13:00,119
Rina, come here.

1413
01:13:00,161 --> 01:13:01,890
Look, I know a little...

1414
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:08,525
You're going to test
for the role.

1415
01:13:08,603 --> 01:13:09,900
Mr. Cord,
do you realize...

1416
01:13:09,938 --> 01:13:11,166
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1417
01:13:11,206 --> 01:13:12,537
I'm no actress.

1418
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,475
Come to think of it,
you're the best actress I know.

1419
01:13:17,512 --> 01:13:19,480
You never said an honest line
in your life.

1420
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:21,448
Don't talk that way to her.

1421
01:13:23,985 --> 01:13:26,681
You call it, Nevada--

1422
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:31,090
she tests,
or we all go home broke.

1423
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:53,107
Hi, Jonas.

1424
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:55,200
Well, I know it's been
a long time

1425
01:13:55,243 --> 01:13:56,540
since you've seen me,

1426
01:13:56,578 --> 01:13:58,136
but you haven't forgotten

1427
01:13:58,179 --> 01:14:00,374
what your wife looks like,
have you?

1428
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:02,610
How are you, Monica?

1429
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,639
Why don't you get in,

1430
01:14:03,685 --> 01:14:06,119
and I'll tell you all about it
on the way home.

1431
01:14:23,271 --> 01:14:24,431
Where are we?

1432
01:14:24,472 --> 01:14:26,030
I thought we were
going to the hotel.

1433
01:14:26,074 --> 01:14:27,098
No questions, please.

1434
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:28,699
Out.

1435
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:42,846
Welcome home, Mr. Jonas.

1436
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:44,586
Did he say home?

1437
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:47,593
Come on.

1438
01:14:51,532 --> 01:14:53,329
Merry Christmas.

1439
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:56,428
It can't be Christmas yet.

1440
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,803
Oh, it is here.

1441
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,468
Monica, did you buy this place?

1442
01:15:01,509 --> 01:15:03,238
No.

1443
01:15:03,278 --> 01:15:04,802
I only leased it for six months

1444
01:15:04,846 --> 01:15:07,508
so you could have the pleasure
of buying it yourself.

1445
01:15:07,548 --> 01:15:10,517
Come on,
I'll give you a tour.

1446
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:16,250
The living room.

1447
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:19,783
41 by 21 .

1448
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:21,954
Painting from a French palace,

1449
01:15:21,996 --> 01:15:24,123
fireplace of italian marble

1450
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:27,532
and hand-woven Persian rugs.

1451
01:15:27,568 --> 01:15:31,800
Out there are four acres
of land with oranges, lemons,

1452
01:15:31,839 --> 01:15:36,071
avocados, assorted flowers,
swimming pool, bathhouse,

1453
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,101
barbecue and tennis court.

1454
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:42,811
This way.

1455
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,841
The den.

1456
01:15:44,886 --> 01:15:48,083
To improve your mind,
ruin your stomach

1457
01:15:48,122 --> 01:15:51,091
and work if you must.

1458
01:16:01,035 --> 01:16:03,230
Grownup's playroom.

1459
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:08,903
For guests.

1460
01:16:08,943 --> 01:16:11,434
Or if anyone unexpected
turns up

1461
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:15,540
we can always just paint it
pink or blue overnight.

1462
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:18,847
Monica, you're not
pregnant, are you?

1463
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:25,255
Well, not that I know of,
but these things happen.

1464
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:27,523
I mean, look
at all the Chinese.

1465
01:16:27,562 --> 01:16:31,259
Besides, most accidents
take place in the home.

1466
01:16:36,871 --> 01:16:38,964
Well?

1467
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:48,242
I've seen enough plays
to know what it means

1468
01:16:48,282 --> 01:16:50,978
when a man has to pour
himself a stiff drink

1469
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:52,145
before he answers.

1470
01:16:52,186 --> 01:16:57,021
The heroine is about to be
told the ugly truth.

1471
01:16:57,058 --> 01:16:59,219
Monica, why this?

1472
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,751
For all the normal reasons.

1473
01:17:01,796 --> 01:17:04,196
Home is where people live.

1474
01:17:04,232 --> 01:17:05,995
You and I were hotel babies.

1475
01:17:06,034 --> 01:17:08,298
The stuffy elevators,
coffee shops,

1476
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:11,464
convention drunks and cigarette
burns on the rugs.

1477
01:17:11,506 --> 01:17:13,906
I thought we both missed this.

1478
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:15,272
Needed it.

1479
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:19,370
What I need is the most freedom
and the fewest responsibilities.

1480
01:17:23,718 --> 01:17:25,276
Why did you get married?

1481
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:30,723
Because I thought you
were the same kind.

1482
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:33,283
Hotels are
my way of life.

1483
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:36,296
Room service like that--
day and night.

1484
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,696
No trees to prune,
no grass to cut.

1485
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,566
Girls sent up
by the bell captain.

1486
01:17:41,602 --> 01:17:45,766
Well, don't forget,
I met you in a hotel.

1487
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:51,139
Oh.

1488
01:17:58,953 --> 01:18:01,478
Jonas, we can do
everything right here

1489
01:18:01,522 --> 01:18:03,251
we do in your hotel suite.

1490
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,725
Only with more privacy...

1491
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,627
more meaning.

1492
01:18:08,663 --> 01:18:11,154
Give it a try. Please.

1493
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,327
More than a playgirl,
I can be wife.

1494
01:18:14,368 --> 01:18:15,494
And mother?

1495
01:18:15,536 --> 01:18:17,026
Yes.

1496
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,172
lf you want.

1497
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,974
I don't want.

1498
01:18:25,012 --> 01:18:27,173
Excuse me, I have to get down

1499
01:18:27,215 --> 01:18:28,375
to the factory.

1500
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:30,316
Can't that airplane wait?

1501
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:32,046
I don't like to be
second in anything.

1502
01:18:32,086 --> 01:18:35,214
But I planned dinner here.

1503
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:37,554
Tomorrow morning I'll be
down at the studio

1504
01:18:37,658 --> 01:18:38,955
working on the picture.

1505
01:18:38,993 --> 01:18:40,756
The studio days
and the factory nights.

1506
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:42,558
You might not see me
for quite awhile.

1507
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:46,533
What do you want me to do
while I'm waiting?

1508
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,364
Get a divorce.

1509
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,573
Jonas, you... can't mean that.

1510
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:58,340
Afraid I do.

1511
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:00,347
Just like that?

1512
01:19:00,381 --> 01:19:02,315
Just like that.

1513
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:15,492
Mrs. Cord, when would
you like dinner served?

1514
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:18,966
Jedediah, you've
known Mr. Cord

1515
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,867
a long time, haven't you?

1516
01:19:21,903 --> 01:19:23,962
Since he was born.

1517
01:19:24,005 --> 01:19:27,338
Tell me about him.

1518
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:30,867
Mr. Jonas is not
easy to tell about.

1519
01:19:30,912 --> 01:19:36,782
Jedediah... Mr. Jonas
is not an easy man to love,

1520
01:19:36,817 --> 01:19:38,546
but I'm trying.

1521
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:40,746
And I'll try.

1522
01:19:40,788 --> 01:19:43,188
Please sit down.

1523
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:45,556
Thank you.

1524
01:19:50,464 --> 01:19:53,558
To be honest, I wasn't sure

1525
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:56,865
what kind of feeling
you had for Mr. Jonas.

1526
01:19:56,904 --> 01:19:58,565
But now, I have some idea

1527
01:19:58,606 --> 01:20:00,164
so I'd like to tell you

1528
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:02,676
what nobody else knows
about him but me...

1529
01:20:03,074 --> 01:20:04,598
I've got to eat my words,
Mr. Cord.

1530
01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:05,700
Rina's great. A natural.

1531
01:20:05,743 --> 01:20:06,835
In fact, she's fabulous.

1532
01:20:06,878 --> 01:20:08,470
Greatest screen test
I ever saw, Ed.

1533
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:09,479
She makes the Old West

1534
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:10,810
look like a new girl in town.

1535
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:11,815
Well, she's a long way

1536
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:13,111
from being an
actress yet, Mr. Cord.

1537
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:14,117
Thank you.

1538
01:20:14,151 --> 01:20:16,915
But she does have
the most important thing--

1539
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:19,354
that rare quality
of screen magnetism.

1540
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,823
Commonly called S-E-X.

1541
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,553
Oh, thank you.

1542
01:20:22,593 --> 01:20:24,424
We can teach her the rest.

1543
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:26,225
Fine.

1544
01:20:26,264 --> 01:20:27,424
Thank you, Mr. Ellis.

1545
01:20:27,465 --> 01:20:29,023
See you on the set tomorrow.

1546
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:30,033
Good night.
Good night.

1547
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:31,625
Good night.

1548
01:20:31,736 --> 01:20:33,636
Walk me to the car,
will you, Dan?

1549
01:20:33,738 --> 01:20:34,636
Sure thing.

1550
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:36,263
I can't do everything.

1551
01:20:36,307 --> 01:20:37,569
Building a plane--

1552
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:40,133
trying to run eight
other businesses.

1553
01:20:40,177 --> 01:20:42,509
I want you to come
to work for me.

1554
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,537
You really know the business.

1555
01:20:44,582 --> 01:20:46,777
You know when to fight
and when to take orders.

1556
01:20:46,817 --> 01:20:48,580
Well, my agency keeps
me pretty busy.

1557
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:51,019
Sell it.

1558
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:53,353
If this picture goes,
I'm in the movies to stay.

1559
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,325
I'll give you ten percent
of the profits

1560
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:56,519
and stock options later.

1561
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,584
Well, I don't know...

1562
01:20:57,628 --> 01:20:59,061
what about
an expense account?

1563
01:20:59,096 --> 01:21:00,290
As big as you need.

1564
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:01,662
Money's the one thing

1565
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:03,792
nobody talks back
to in this town.

1566
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:05,768
You can live on the expenses

1567
01:21:05,803 --> 01:21:07,327
and bank your salary.

1568
01:21:07,371 --> 01:21:11,034
By noon tomorrow I'll be
out of the agency business

1569
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,475
and hip deep
in Cord Productions.

1570
01:21:13,511 --> 01:21:15,274
Now that you're
working for me,

1571
01:21:15,313 --> 01:21:17,543
I'd like you to do
a couple of things.

1572
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,775
Anything you say, boss.

1573
01:21:18,816 --> 01:21:19,908
We'll get the writers

1574
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:21,350
to go over
the script again.

1575
01:21:21,385 --> 01:21:22,511
Build up Rina's part.

1576
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:24,987
Well, where does
that leave Nevada?

1577
01:21:25,022 --> 01:21:26,080
What do you care?

1578
01:21:26,123 --> 01:21:28,353
You're not working
for him anymore.

1579
01:21:30,027 --> 01:21:32,257
There's a certain logic
in that, I guess.

1580
01:21:32,296 --> 01:21:35,060
By the way, have you got
a little black book?

1581
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,088
One of the best.

1582
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:37,828
Good. Line me up
some girls.

1583
01:21:37,868 --> 01:21:40,063
But I... I thought
you were just... married.

1584
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,197
I want girls to take out,
to be seen with.

1585
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:43,638
Get my name in the columns.

1586
01:21:43,674 --> 01:21:45,005
Pictures whenever you can.

1587
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:46,942
Girls, names, pictures.

1588
01:21:46,978 --> 01:21:48,343
You're the boss.

1589
01:21:48,379 --> 01:21:51,507
Close the door, will you, Dan?

1590
01:21:51,549 --> 01:21:52,641
Oh, certainly.

1591
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,310
Let's go, Jedediah.

1592
01:21:55,353 --> 01:21:58,254
One more thing-- fire Ellis.

1593
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:01,190
Well, who's going
to direct the picture?

1594
01:22:01,225 --> 01:22:02,749
I am.

1595
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:06,729
I just discovered I know as much
about directing as he does.

1596
01:22:24,348 --> 01:22:26,282
Hold it, Mr. Cord,
please, for a picture.

1597
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:27,306
Thank you.

1598
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:29,319
Still... good.

1599
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:35,357
The work looks all right...

1600
01:22:35,393 --> 01:22:37,759
what there is of it.

1601
01:22:37,795 --> 01:22:40,457
We're more than a week
behind the schedule we set up.

1602
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:41,829
What happened?

1603
01:22:41,866 --> 01:22:44,767
Well, I, uh...
I don't know, Jonas.

1604
01:22:44,802 --> 01:22:46,326
Maybe I was wrong
about the schedule.

1605
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:48,065
Maybe I should have
allowed more time...

1606
01:22:48,105 --> 01:22:49,732
Cut it out, will you, Morrissey?

1607
01:22:49,774 --> 01:22:52,140
The only thing wrong
with our schedule is you.

1608
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:54,167
Every bolt,
every screw, every nut

1609
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:56,805
has to have your personal
thumbprint on it.

1610
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,941
You act as if we've never
seen an airplane before.

1611
01:22:59,984 --> 01:23:02,646
Only the great Jonas Cord
knows everything.

1612
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:05,052
You expect us to work
all day for the company

1613
01:23:05,089 --> 01:23:07,148
and all night for you?

1614
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,386
Well, Jonas Cord
might be a genius,

1615
01:23:09,427 --> 01:23:11,759
but Morrissey and me
are human beings

1616
01:23:11,796 --> 01:23:14,458
who get annoyed,
frustrated and damn tired.

1617
01:23:14,498 --> 01:23:16,693
You just wasted another minute.

1618
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:20,966
I expect you to make that week
up whether you sleep or not.

1619
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:22,905
Now, if you can't do it, I will.

1620
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,966
You'll never do it playing
amateur movie producer

1621
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,774
and a cavalry officer
on your casting couch.

1622
01:23:28,813 --> 01:23:32,476
Let's get back
to what we started.

1623
01:23:32,516 --> 01:23:34,381
Hello, Jonas.

1624
01:23:34,418 --> 01:23:36,147
Hello.

1625
01:23:36,187 --> 01:23:38,018
Do you have time for your wife?

1626
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,113
No.

1627
01:23:39,156 --> 01:23:41,181
Make time.

1628
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,386
I'm going to talk to you, Jonas,

1629
01:23:43,427 --> 01:23:45,952
and I'll do it
in front of Buzz and Phil

1630
01:23:45,996 --> 01:23:47,554
if that's what you want.

1631
01:23:47,598 --> 01:23:49,293
I think I'll get a drink.

1632
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:03,745
We're married.

1633
01:24:03,781 --> 01:24:06,147
We live in the same town,
but you never come home.

1634
01:24:06,183 --> 01:24:07,912
I don't have a home.

1635
01:24:07,952 --> 01:24:10,443
They won't even let me
in your hotel room.

1636
01:24:10,488 --> 01:24:12,479
I'm rarely there anyway.

1637
01:24:12,523 --> 01:24:13,547
The only time I see you

1638
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,491
is in the newspapers
with some other girl.

1639
01:24:15,526 --> 01:24:17,357
They aren't
very good pictures.

1640
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:19,589
Jonas, how much can I take?

1641
01:24:19,663 --> 01:24:22,131
There aren't any stress tables
for brunettes.

1642
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:25,067
Would you stop talking
like a damn footnote?

1643
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:28,538
Why don't you just...
say something that makes sense?

1644
01:24:28,572 --> 01:24:32,599
This makes sense-- I'm busy,
I don't want to be disturbed.

1645
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:33,870
Jonas...

1646
01:24:33,911 --> 01:24:35,811
Get out of here!

1647
01:24:42,653 --> 01:24:45,315
All right, Jonas.

1648
01:24:45,356 --> 01:24:48,086
Go talk to your lawyer.

1649
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:49,922
I don't have a lawyer

1650
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,394
and I don't want one.

1651
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:58,935
Good!

1652
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,459
It’s the Battle of
Bull Run, Armistice Day

1653
01:25:00,504 --> 01:25:02,199
and the stock market crash
all rolled into one.

1654
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,036
The picture killed them,
or should I say Rina did?

1655
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:05,166
Thank you, thank you.

1656
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:07,109
Listen to this, listen, Jonas.

1657
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:08,873
"Excellent".
"Excellent". "Excellent".

1658
01:25:08,913 --> 01:25:10,938
"Superior".
"Superior".  "Excellent".

1659
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:12,573
All the cards are
coming through that way.

1660
01:25:12,616 --> 01:25:13,583
She's outside.

1661
01:25:13,617 --> 01:25:15,050
Yeah, the crowd
doesn't want to leave.

1662
01:25:15,085 --> 01:25:16,575
They're trying to tear
her clothes off,

1663
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,087
get her autograph
or just to touch her.

1664
01:25:18,122 --> 01:25:19,851
Jonas, she's the biggest
thing to hit this town

1665
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:20,857
since the Spanish landed.

1666
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:21,915
It’s incredible.

1667
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:23,586
Yeah, all you can smell
in there air is gold.

1668
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:24,594
You ought to be here.

1669
01:25:24,628 --> 01:25:26,095
I don't have to be there, Dan--

1670
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,256
I knew it would happen.

1671
01:25:27,298 --> 01:25:29,391
Give her 15 more minutes
with the crowd,

1672
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:30,991
then hustle her out of there.

1673
01:25:31,035 --> 01:25:35,335
I want her here in my hotel
suite at 11:15 promptly.

1674
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:36,805
I don't think I can tear her...

1675
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,435
Dan, I don't care.
Just tell her.

1676
01:25:53,991 --> 01:25:56,858
Hello.

1677
01:25:56,894 --> 01:25:59,260
Jonas!

1678
01:25:59,296 --> 01:26:02,697
How are you?

1679
01:26:02,733 --> 01:26:05,361
Your hotel, 11:30?

1680
01:26:05,402 --> 01:26:07,962
I'll be there on the minute.

1681
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:10,132
Good-bye.

1682
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,875
Come in.

1683
01:26:28,259 --> 01:26:30,591
Signed, sealed and delivered.

1684
01:26:30,694 --> 01:26:35,222
Rina Marlowe, the cowboy's
home companion,

1685
01:26:35,266 --> 01:26:37,564
reporting for duty
as ordered.

1686
01:26:37,601 --> 01:26:40,195
And overdressed.
The bedroom's that way.

1687
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:44,600
The Jonas Cord
Collection Agency.

1688
01:26:44,642 --> 01:26:47,167
We never sleep...

1689
01:26:47,211 --> 01:26:49,236
alone.

1690
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,306
You're too cheerful about it.

1691
01:26:52,349 --> 01:26:55,045
By the way, I told Nevada
I was coming up here.

1692
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:58,145
Why the hell did you do
a stupid thing like that?

1693
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:01,555
Because Nevada and I
are going to be married.

1694
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:04,254
I told him I wanted
to be the first

1695
01:27:04,295 --> 01:27:06,889
to give our closest
friend the word.

1696
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,989
You can't marry him,
he's on his way out.

1697
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:10,557
After this picture's released,

1698
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,796
you'll be the biggest star
in the business.

1699
01:27:12,836 --> 01:27:14,701
So they tell me.

1700
01:27:18,042 --> 01:27:20,101
You've got nothing
to gain by marrying him.

1701
01:27:20,144 --> 01:27:23,341
I gain a man who helped me once
and who needs me now.

1702
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,371
Making you
a star was my idea.

1703
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:27,407
I didn't ask you for it!
I never wanted it!

1704
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:30,045
You even built up my part
as a monument to your own ego

1705
01:27:30,087 --> 01:27:31,520
while you cut his to the bone.

1706
01:27:31,555 --> 01:27:33,546
I didn't see you trying
to stop me.

1707
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:34,557
He's on the booze.

1708
01:27:34,591 --> 01:27:36,388
We both know his days
are numbered.

1709
01:27:36,427 --> 01:27:39,191
That's why he needs me
more than ever.

1710
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:40,526
Why do you think

1711
01:27:40,564 --> 01:27:41,588
I did all this?

1712
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,601
As always, just to give
and take on your own terms.

1713
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:47,160
Besides, what do you care
about Nevada and me?

1714
01:27:47,204 --> 01:27:48,501
You're already married.

1715
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:02,582
Miss Marlowe,

1716
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:07,682
I'd like you
to meet my wife, Monica.

1717
01:28:07,725 --> 01:28:10,489
Monica, this
is my stepmother.

1718
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,261
Would you like a drink or what?

1719
01:28:21,372 --> 01:28:25,706
I've seen what
you brought me here to see.

1720
01:28:25,743 --> 01:28:28,337
I'll file for divorce
in the morning.

1721
01:28:44,595 --> 01:28:48,224
Oh, you dirty, filthy,
perverted monster.

1722
01:28:48,265 --> 01:28:49,960
You can do better than that.

1723
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,592
You are the meanest, cruelest

1724
01:28:51,668 --> 01:28:53,602
most loathsome thing
I've ever met.

1725
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:54,864
Except for yourself.

1726
01:28:54,905 --> 01:28:55,929
Oh...

1727
01:28:55,973 --> 01:28:57,133
We belong together.

1728
01:28:57,174 --> 01:28:58,266
We're a set.

1729
01:28:58,308 --> 01:29:01,971
I promised to marry Nevada.

1730
01:29:02,012 --> 01:29:04,412
Who said anything
about marrying?

1731
01:29:04,448 --> 01:29:06,541
Oh, you really are
completely no good.

1732
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,380
But that's what's always
excited you, isn't it?

1733
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,648
You're just like me.

1734
01:29:10,687 --> 01:29:12,848
You can't make love
to anyone you like.

1735
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,551
We've known that, both of us.

1736
01:29:14,591 --> 01:29:16,320
Haven't we?

1737
01:29:17,828 --> 01:29:20,888
Oh, yes, yes.

1738
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:23,627
Oh, damn it, yes!

1739
01:29:26,503 --> 01:29:28,562
By the authority vested in me

1740
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,573
by the State of California

1741
01:29:30,607 --> 01:29:34,134
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1742
01:29:36,013 --> 01:29:38,072
You may kiss the bride.

1743
01:29:42,486 --> 01:29:44,454
All right, now.
Break it up, break it up.

1744
01:29:44,488 --> 01:29:46,649
I'll take my ten percent now.

1745
01:30:10,647 --> 01:30:12,911
Calling Dr. Kelly.

1746
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,076
Calling Dr. Kelly.

1747
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:16,051
Report to superintendent
on floor five.

1748
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,083
Jonas.

1749
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,785
Hello, Monica.

1750
01:30:26,063 --> 01:30:28,623
You know, I heard about
the passenger flight.

1751
01:30:28,665 --> 01:30:30,223
I think
that's so marvelous.

1752
01:30:30,267 --> 01:30:32,462
I don't know how
you do it so quickly.

1753
01:30:32,503 --> 01:30:35,563
Monica, about the baby...

1754
01:30:35,606 --> 01:30:37,506
Did you see her?

1755
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,566
Yes.

1756
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:42,443
Isn’t she absolutely
beautiful?

1757
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,642
I'm no expert on babies.

1758
01:30:45,716 --> 01:30:49,413
You can see that she is.

1759
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:52,650
I'm calling her Joanne.

1760
01:30:52,689 --> 01:30:54,816
Just a name I liked.

1761
01:30:56,393 --> 01:30:57,985
I hope you don't mind.

1762
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:08,069
Whose baby is it?

1763
01:31:08,105 --> 01:31:10,972
It’s mine, of course.

1764
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:13,135
That's not what I mean.

1765
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,980
Who's the father?

1766
01:31:20,817 --> 01:31:22,478
You are, Jonas.

1767
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,146
I'm not.

1768
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,620
But you are.

1769
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:30,285
When I filed for divorce
I didn't know I was pregnant,

1770
01:31:30,327 --> 01:31:31,419
but I was.

1771
01:31:31,461 --> 01:31:32,587
Are you sure?

1772
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:36,021
Sure?

1773
01:31:38,068 --> 01:31:40,002
I don't have to prove anything.

1774
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:42,403
I'm the mother,
and you're the father,

1775
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:44,430
and that's the way it is, Jonas.

1776
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:49,137
Don't worry
about the great Cord name.

1777
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:52,012
I'm calling her
Joanne Winthrop,

1778
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:54,074
so you have no worries,

1779
01:31:54,117 --> 01:31:56,813
no responsibilities,
no fears.

1780
01:31:58,989 --> 01:32:02,857
Now, get out of here.

1781
01:32:05,762 --> 01:32:08,788
Am I listed on the birth
certificate as father?

1782
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,992
Of course you are.

1783
01:32:10,033 --> 01:32:12,866
You expect me to put down
"father unknown"?

1784
01:32:19,176 --> 01:32:22,441
I just wanted to know.

1785
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:24,447
I'm on my way to Europe.

1786
01:32:24,481 --> 01:32:27,917
Well, stay there
and don't ever come back.

1787
01:32:27,951 --> 01:32:31,011
If you need anything
for the child--

1788
01:32:31,054 --> 01:32:33,147
money for clothes...

1789
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,216
nurses...

1790
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:39,387
special teachers...

1791
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:42,523
That baby only needs
what you can't give it,

1792
01:32:42,566 --> 01:32:44,864
'cause you don't have it--
faith!

1793
01:32:44,901 --> 01:32:46,926
Faith in yourself,
faith in your child

1794
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,267
and faith in the future!

1795
01:32:48,305 --> 01:32:50,500
What do you mean?

1796
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,474
Oh...

1797
01:32:57,514 --> 01:33:01,177
You know exactly what I mean,

1798
01:33:01,218 --> 01:33:03,345
Jonas Cord, Jr.

1799
01:33:17,197 --> 01:33:19,631
Seven or eight years went by.

1800
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,167
The world was crippled

1801
01:33:21,201 --> 01:33:23,294
by the Crash
and the Depression.

1802
01:33:23,336 --> 01:33:25,930
Everyone suffered from it,
except Jonas.

1803
01:33:25,972 --> 01:33:27,769
He was above it.

1804
01:33:27,808 --> 01:33:30,208
We can carry
eight more passengers in this

1805
01:33:30,243 --> 01:33:31,642
and one more crew member

1806
01:33:31,712 --> 01:33:33,646
and cruise 60 miles
an hour faster.

1807
01:33:33,747 --> 01:33:35,647
That's with an
increased gas load.

1808
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:37,182
How much of an increase?

1809
01:33:37,217 --> 01:33:38,445
A thousand miles.

1810
01:33:38,485 --> 01:33:40,419
New York's fogged in,
we can still make

1811
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:43,150
Washington, Philadelphia,
Boston with fuel to spare.

1812
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:45,920
Point that out
in the advertising.

1813
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:47,859
You could fire a
cannon off that nose

1814
01:33:47,894 --> 01:33:50,863
without it deviating a degree.

1815
01:33:50,897 --> 01:33:53,627
Good prototype for a bomber?

1816
01:33:53,667 --> 01:33:54,827
Yeah.

1817
01:33:54,868 --> 01:33:56,961
Waist guns, tail guns,
bomb bay.

1818
01:33:57,003 --> 01:33:59,494
Better than any plane
I can think of.

1819
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:00,665
Get busy.

1820
01:34:00,774 --> 01:34:02,105
Knock off a two-engine bomber

1821
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:04,372
and get a four-engine job
on the drawing boards.

1822
01:34:04,411 --> 01:34:05,742
Now, look, Jonas.

1823
01:34:05,779 --> 01:34:07,713
We're just beginning
to show a profit again...

1824
01:34:07,748 --> 01:34:08,942
There's a war coming.

1825
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:10,574
Which has nothing
to do with us.

1826
01:34:10,617 --> 01:34:12,608
Every war's got
something to do with us.

1827
01:34:12,652 --> 01:34:15,280
One day, three-star generals
will be scrambling around

1828
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:17,517
like scared ants
looking for military planes.

1829
01:34:17,557 --> 01:34:19,718
What about our overseas
passenger franchise?

1830
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,058
That'll have to wait.

1831
01:34:23,864 --> 01:34:25,957
Tell McAllister to come in.

1832
01:34:28,835 --> 01:34:30,359
Just keep it steady.

1833
01:34:30,403 --> 01:34:32,894
Keep the nose above the horizon.

1834
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:35,601
Don't push on anything.

1835
01:34:35,642 --> 01:34:37,405
Morrissey, when we get back,

1836
01:34:37,444 --> 01:34:40,242
I've got some sketches
of a pursuit plane

1837
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,147
I want to show you,
courtesy of the enemy.

1838
01:34:43,183 --> 01:34:44,810
What enemy?

1839
01:34:44,851 --> 01:34:47,012
Time.

1840
01:34:47,053 --> 01:34:48,520
Great plane, Jonas.

1841
01:34:48,555 --> 01:34:50,921
Years ahead
of anything in the air.

1842
01:34:50,957 --> 01:34:53,585
Thanks.

1843
01:34:53,627 --> 01:34:57,427
How much stock do we have
in Norman Pictures?

1844
01:34:57,464 --> 01:34:59,898
Four or five thousand shares.

1845
01:34:59,933 --> 01:35:02,060
I want control.

1846
01:35:02,102 --> 01:35:05,071
Start buying.
Use intermediaries.

1847
01:35:05,105 --> 01:35:07,232
That's only a hobby for you,
Jonas. There's...

1848
01:35:07,274 --> 01:35:09,003
Now, don't argue
with me, Mac.

1849
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,509
Just buy the stock.

1850
01:35:13,113 --> 01:35:15,047
You know,
you've always given me orders,

1851
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:16,605
and I've carried them out.

1852
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:19,346
But you've never treated me
like the village idiot before,

1853
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:20,785
and I don't like the feeling.

1854
01:35:20,821 --> 01:35:21,947
I'm turning in my badge.

1855
01:35:21,988 --> 01:35:23,546
You want more money?

1856
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:25,080
No, I want a rest--

1857
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:26,615
a vacation from you

1858
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:30,357
and your wild schemes
and midnight phone calls

1859
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:34,356
and from living up in the air
like a rich seagull.

1860
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:37,165
Stick with me
a while longer, Mac.

1861
01:35:37,204 --> 01:35:38,637
I need you.

1862
01:35:38,672 --> 01:35:41,004
What you need
is the same thing--

1863
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:42,872
a vacation from yourself.

1864
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:45,207
More than the rest of us, even.

1865
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:48,476
You're about to come apart
at the seams.

1866
01:35:48,515 --> 01:35:50,608
Will you buy the stock?

1867
01:35:52,986 --> 01:35:54,886
Yes, yes, like always.

1868
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:57,048
Only instead,
why don't we buy stock

1869
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,318
in a mental institution,

1870
01:35:58,358 --> 01:36:00,087
a whole string of madhouses?

1871
01:36:00,126 --> 01:36:02,287
That's where we're
all going to end up.

1872
01:36:02,329 --> 01:36:03,819
I need some coffee.

1873
01:36:03,864 --> 01:36:05,832
You take it, Mac.

1874
01:36:21,281 --> 01:36:22,248
Good morning, David.

1875
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:23,510
Good morning.

1876
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,415
Stock's gone up
another point and a half

1877
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:26,749
this morning, Uncle Bernie.

1878
01:36:26,786 --> 01:36:27,878
How 'bout that, huh?

1879
01:36:27,921 --> 01:36:29,013
Well, it excites you?

1880
01:36:29,055 --> 01:36:30,613
Well, eight points
in two weeks?!

1881
01:36:30,657 --> 01:36:31,919
Look what you picked up!

1882
01:36:33,793 --> 01:36:37,024
David, I'm a fat old elk
who's picked up

1883
01:36:37,063 --> 01:36:39,224
a hungry wolf on his trail.

1884
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:40,494
I don't get it.

1885
01:36:40,533 --> 01:36:43,798
Stock goes up
because someone is buying.

1886
01:36:43,837 --> 01:36:45,930
Why do people buy things?

1887
01:36:45,972 --> 01:36:48,770
So they can own them.

1888
01:36:48,808 --> 01:36:52,642
And who wants to own
the studio?

1889
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:54,203
Jonas...?

1890
01:36:54,247 --> 01:36:56,807
Jonas Cord, that's right.

1891
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:58,784
But he can't own the studio.

1892
01:36:58,818 --> 01:37:00,649
You have 51% of the stock.

1893
01:37:00,687 --> 01:37:04,214
51%! I'd sell it tomorrow
for the right price.

1894
01:37:04,257 --> 01:37:06,384
You'd sell?

1895
01:37:06,426 --> 01:37:09,190
David, we're a one-star studio.

1896
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:10,992
We always have been.

1897
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:14,000
Now, who's our star
for this week?

1898
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:16,025
Rina Marlowe.

1899
01:37:16,069 --> 01:37:18,697
Rina Marlowe.
That's right.

1900
01:37:18,738 --> 01:37:21,468
A lush, a bottle baby.

1901
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:24,409
Arrested five times
already for drunken driving.

1902
01:37:24,444 --> 01:37:27,072
And what it costs to
get her out of trouble

1903
01:37:27,113 --> 01:37:28,546
and to keep it quiet...

1904
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:30,048
Don't ask what it costs.

1905
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:31,414
So, I made the mistake

1906
01:37:31,451 --> 01:37:34,045
of calling her on the
carpet for last month

1907
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:36,146
and now she won't
even talk to me.

1908
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:38,350
How do you like that?

1909
01:37:38,391 --> 01:37:40,154
Hmm. Here.

1910
01:37:40,193 --> 01:37:41,285
Here's a script.

1911
01:37:41,328 --> 01:37:42,625
Blue Goddess.

1912
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:45,631
It’s about Africa,
written especially for her.

1913
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:47,189
She won't even read it.

1914
01:37:47,233 --> 01:37:49,224
Now, without her--

1915
01:37:49,269 --> 01:37:51,635
or someone like her--

1916
01:37:51,671 --> 01:37:55,437
what do you think my 51 º/º
is going to be worth next year?

1917
01:37:55,672 --> 01:38:00,439
Well, if it's that bad,
then, well, then sell.

1918
01:38:00,476 --> 01:38:04,105
David, buying and selling
is an art.

1919
01:38:04,147 --> 01:38:07,116
It’s an art in which
I have few equals

1920
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:09,277
including Jonas Cord.

1921
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:14,120
When I sell, I'll pick the time.

1922
01:38:14,157 --> 01:38:16,284
You know,
you're a good-looking boy.

1923
01:38:17,527 --> 01:38:20,860
Well, what has that got to do
with buying and selling?

1924
01:38:24,834 --> 01:38:26,131
Here.

1925
01:38:26,169 --> 01:38:29,468
Take this script
to Miss Marlowe.

1926
01:38:29,505 --> 01:38:32,133
Maybe she'll read it for you.

1927
01:38:32,175 --> 01:38:33,972
Wh...

1928
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:36,979
I-I don't know. D...

1929
01:38:37,013 --> 01:38:38,640
Do you think she would?

1930
01:38:38,681 --> 01:38:44,483
David, by the thousands
they write in for a photograph,

1931
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,318
autograph, a lock of hair.

1932
01:38:47,357 --> 01:38:49,120
lf they only knew it

1933
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:52,650
all they have to do
is push a doorbell--

1934
01:38:52,695 --> 01:38:54,219
they get everything.

1935
01:38:56,032 --> 01:38:57,329
Go ahead.

1936
01:38:57,367 --> 01:39:00,029
Go, go, go.

1937
01:39:05,642 --> 01:39:09,100
So, Uncle Bernie's
worried, is he?

1938
01:39:09,145 --> 01:39:12,581
Jonas made a mistake
putting me under contract

1939
01:39:12,615 --> 01:39:15,641
at the studio
instead of Cord Chemicals.

1940
01:39:17,654 --> 01:39:19,622
What did you say
your name was?

1941
01:39:19,656 --> 01:39:21,647
Uh, David.

1942
01:39:24,494 --> 01:39:28,954
"Little David was small...

1943
01:39:28,998 --> 01:39:32,525
but, oh, my".

1944
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:38,165
Are you small, but, oh, my?

1945
01:39:38,207 --> 01:39:40,471
I... don't exactly...

1946
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,137
Jonas hates me.

1947
01:39:42,178 --> 01:39:45,045
Oh, well, nobody could hate you,
Miss Marlowe.

1948
01:39:46,349 --> 01:39:47,816
That's sweet.

1949
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:51,980
Most foolish statements are.

1950
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:53,784
But he also loves me.

1951
01:39:53,823 --> 01:39:55,484
Oh, well, of course.

1952
01:39:55,525 --> 01:40:00,394
I mean, we all contain the seeds
of, uh, of our opposites.

1953
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:03,160
Oh...

1954
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,657
I like intelligent men.

1955
01:40:06,703 --> 01:40:09,831
I like men.

1956
01:40:09,872 --> 01:40:12,170
Or maybe I hate them.

1957
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:16,110
I'm not always sure.

1958
01:40:17,146 --> 01:40:19,614
Are you strong?

1959
01:40:19,649 --> 01:40:21,981
Jonas likes to think

1960
01:40:22,018 --> 01:40:25,419
he's strong and tough
and bad.

1961
01:40:25,455 --> 01:40:26,820
When he wants to be tough

1962
01:40:26,856 --> 01:40:28,847
he goes out
and buys another company.

1963
01:40:28,891 --> 01:40:31,689
So, he wants Norman Pictures.

1964
01:40:31,761 --> 01:40:35,197
When he wants to be bad
he needs me.

1965
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:38,029
So, he wants to buy me.

1966
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:39,864
You know something?

1967
01:40:39,902 --> 01:40:42,029
No.

1968
01:40:42,071 --> 01:40:45,040
I think he's going to do both.

1969
01:40:45,074 --> 01:40:46,405
Well...

1970
01:40:46,442 --> 01:40:48,205
lf you'll excuse me,
Miss Marlowe.

1971
01:40:48,244 --> 01:40:49,404
I...

1972
01:40:49,445 --> 01:40:51,470
have to be getting
back to the studio.

1973
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:53,379
I-I'm trying to
learn the business.

1974
01:40:53,416 --> 01:40:56,681
Ambitious, too?

1975
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,711
Well, you've come
to the right place.

1976
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:02,815
I'm something
of a schoolmarm myself.

1977
01:41:02,859 --> 01:41:04,156
Oh-oh, really?

1978
01:41:04,193 --> 01:41:05,182
Mm-hmm.

1979
01:41:05,228 --> 01:41:08,163
Until you learn about people
and their emotions

1980
01:41:08,197 --> 01:41:09,664
you don't know anything.

1981
01:41:09,766 --> 01:41:12,326
Oh, but I-I just want
to be a producer,

1982
01:41:12,368 --> 01:41:13,665
not an actor.

1983
01:41:13,703 --> 01:41:15,261
Well, how do you think

1984
01:41:15,304 --> 01:41:17,829
producers cast pictures,
from books?

1985
01:41:17,874 --> 01:41:19,171
Well, all right then.

1986
01:41:19,208 --> 01:41:21,005
Then you read the script
and then I can...

1987
01:41:21,043 --> 01:41:22,169
Oh, I'd like to,

1988
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:24,702
if you'll stay
and read it with me.

1989
01:41:26,715 --> 01:41:28,546
Mmm.

1990
01:41:34,389 --> 01:41:36,687
You know, Jennie, baby,

1991
01:41:36,725 --> 01:41:38,852
you've got the world
by the tail.

1992
01:41:38,894 --> 01:41:40,521
So I've heard.

1993
01:41:40,562 --> 01:41:41,688
Want a drink?

1994
01:41:41,797 --> 01:41:44,698
For 200 bucks, I should get
a champagne bath, shouldn't I?

1995
01:41:44,733 --> 01:41:46,997
Honey, you can leave
any time you like.

1996
01:41:47,035 --> 01:41:49,697
Oh, no, sweetie, don't get sore.

1997
01:41:49,738 --> 01:41:51,706
No, seriously, Jennie,
you're...

1998
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:54,868
you're nothing short
of terrific.

1999
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:56,036
I just know my job.

2000
01:41:56,078 --> 01:41:57,045
Mmm.

2001
01:41:57,079 --> 01:41:58,068
You like it?

2002
01:41:58,113 --> 01:42:00,206
For God's sakes.

2003
01:42:00,249 --> 01:42:01,546
Do I like it?

2004
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:02,845
How did I get started?

2005
01:42:02,885 --> 01:42:05,479
You going to ask those
same ol' john questions?

2006
01:42:05,521 --> 01:42:07,489
I thought you were
a sharp operator.

2007
01:42:07,523 --> 01:42:08,649
If I really were,

2008
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:10,521
I wouldn't have to be here,
would I?

2009
01:42:11,693 --> 01:42:13,490
You know, that's the
first intelligent thing

2010
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:14,655
I ever heard you say.

2011
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:16,664
Every now and then I get weak
and turn honest.

2012
01:42:16,698 --> 01:42:17,665
It won't happen again.

2013
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:19,326
I'm sure.

2014
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:22,166
Well... here's to Adam and Eve.

2015
01:42:22,204 --> 01:42:23,831
They hold the original
patents

2016
01:42:23,872 --> 01:42:25,999
but you've certainly
improved on them.

2017
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:29,374
Honey...
come around here, sit down.

2018
01:42:35,417 --> 01:42:36,714
You know...

2019
01:42:40,556 --> 01:42:42,217
Mmm...

2020
01:42:43,225 --> 01:42:45,022
Honey, I got an idea.

2021
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:49,520
Mmm, that wasn't
hard to guess.

2022
01:42:49,565 --> 01:42:52,193
How would you like
to be in pictures?

2023
01:42:52,234 --> 01:42:53,201
I was once.

2024
01:42:53,235 --> 01:42:54,202
Mmm?

2025
01:42:54,236 --> 01:42:55,863
All I wore was goose pimples.

2026
01:42:55,904 --> 01:42:57,531
Oh, that.

2027
01:42:57,573 --> 01:43:01,065
No, I-I mean the kind
that you can...

2028
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:05,479
...show at the corner bijou.

2029
01:43:05,514 --> 01:43:07,505
Oh, now, come on,
Mr. Pierce.

2030
01:43:07,549 --> 01:43:09,380
I've heard that one before.

2031
01:43:09,418 --> 01:43:12,319
I run a strictly
cash-and-carry business.

2032
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:16,154
No checks, no promissory notes

2033
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:18,819
no pie in the sky.

2034
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,851
Did you ever hear
of Jonas Cord?

2035
01:43:22,531 --> 01:43:24,499
You ever hear
of anybody who didn't?

2036
01:43:24,533 --> 01:43:26,831
He's everywhere,
like the flu.

2037
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:28,335
Twice as irritating,
they say.

2038
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:30,838
I'm his right-hand man.

2039
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:32,840
The price is still
the same.

2040
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:35,001
You're the kind of girl
he'd like, you know?

2041
01:43:35,043 --> 01:43:36,943
Monday's open--
send him up.

2042
01:43:36,979 --> 01:43:39,038
You know, he made a star
out of Rina Marlowe.

2043
01:43:39,081 --> 01:43:40,673
Of course,
she's on the bottle now,

2044
01:43:40,716 --> 01:43:42,013
earmarked for oblivion.

2045
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:44,348
But somebody's got
to take her place.

2046
01:43:44,386 --> 01:43:46,684
Mmm, look,
a joke's a joke.

2047
01:43:46,722 --> 01:43:48,417
I'll give you $300
for the test

2048
01:43:48,457 --> 01:43:50,254
and $750 a week
if we sign you.

2049
01:43:52,728 --> 01:43:55,162
You know what I am.

2050
01:43:55,197 --> 01:43:57,529
Jonas Cord doesn't.

2051
01:43:57,566 --> 01:44:00,194
I've got a feeling

2052
01:44:00,235 --> 01:44:02,100
that you've got what he likes
in a woman.

2053
01:44:03,138 --> 01:44:04,969
It’s crazy.

2054
01:44:05,007 --> 01:44:06,975
That's what Eve probably
said to Adam.

2055
01:44:07,009 --> 01:44:08,636
Look what that lead to.

2056
01:44:08,677 --> 01:44:11,305
This is a strange world.

2057
01:44:11,346 --> 01:44:14,509
Anything is possible.

2058
01:44:59,728 --> 01:45:01,662
Is she dead?

2059
01:45:01,697 --> 01:45:02,686
Not quite.

2060
01:45:02,731 --> 01:45:04,130
She's unconscious.

2061
01:45:04,166 --> 01:45:05,633
The doctor didn't give
anything

2062
01:45:05,667 --> 01:45:08,465
for her chances
of coming out of it.

2063
01:45:08,503 --> 01:45:10,801
Have you told Jonas
about this?

2064
01:45:10,839 --> 01:45:11,965
No, I'm afraid to.

2065
01:45:12,007 --> 01:45:14,134
That's why I came here first.

2066
01:45:14,176 --> 01:45:16,474
I'm trying to work
my way up to him.

2067
01:45:16,511 --> 01:45:18,979
How could she do this
to me?

2068
01:45:19,014 --> 01:45:21,642
How could she do it?

2069
01:45:21,683 --> 01:45:22,650
Cord wants my studio

2070
01:45:22,684 --> 01:45:24,311
more than anything else
in the world.

2071
01:45:24,352 --> 01:45:25,546
When he finds out
about Rina

2072
01:45:25,587 --> 01:45:27,145
I won't have a chance
of selling it.

2073
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:28,656
You know, I never realized

2074
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:30,988
what a cold-blooded...
character you are.

2075
01:45:31,026 --> 01:45:32,994
Now, listen, this is
a one-star studio.

2076
01:45:33,028 --> 01:45:34,325
When she goes, we go.

2077
01:45:34,362 --> 01:45:35,989
Now, I can't keep
her alive, can I?

2078
01:45:36,031 --> 01:45:36,998
No.

2079
01:45:37,032 --> 01:45:38,499
No, I got to think
about the living

2080
01:45:38,533 --> 01:45:39,500
and that's me.

2081
01:45:39,534 --> 01:45:40,865
Go ahead, laugh.

2082
01:45:40,902 --> 01:45:42,062
It’s you, too.

2083
01:45:42,104 --> 01:45:44,163
Your job dies with Rina.

2084
01:45:44,206 --> 01:45:46,674
-I never thought of that.
-Mm-hmm.

2085
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:48,938
You get to be
pretty cold-blooded fast

2086
01:45:48,977 --> 01:45:50,171
yourself, don't you?

2087
01:45:50,212 --> 01:45:53,181
You just shot me
with an icicle.

2088
01:45:53,215 --> 01:45:56,184
All right, now listen.

2089
01:45:56,218 --> 01:45:59,517
Maybe you can fix it
so that you never...

2090
01:45:59,554 --> 01:46:03,251
you never have to work
for anybody again, ever.

2091
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,782
I-I, I don't follow.

2092
01:46:05,827 --> 01:46:08,796
Are you sure Jonas doesn't
know anything about this?

2093
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:11,128
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2094
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:14,465
Do you think you can keep Jonas
from learning about the accident

2095
01:46:14,503 --> 01:46:15,629
for a couple of hours?

2096
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:17,001
Oh, now, wait a minute, Bernie.

2097
01:46:17,038 --> 01:46:18,130
Just what kind of a louse

2098
01:46:18,173 --> 01:46:19,640
do you think...?
Just a minute yourself.

2099
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:20,902
How much was he willing to pay

2100
01:46:20,942 --> 01:46:21,966
to buy me out?

2101
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:23,568
I don't know,
three or four million.

2102
01:46:23,612 --> 01:46:28,140
All right, I'll start with five.

2103
01:46:28,183 --> 01:46:29,741
lf the deal works,

2104
01:46:29,785 --> 01:46:32,811
you get 15%.

2105
01:46:32,854 --> 01:46:34,151
I get...?

2106
01:46:34,189 --> 01:46:35,554
You heard me, 15%.

2107
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:37,057
Now, it's worth it.

2108
01:46:37,092 --> 01:46:40,528
I waited a long time
for a chance like this.

2109
01:46:42,197 --> 01:46:44,665
Suppose he...?

2110
01:46:44,699 --> 01:46:46,030
Suppose he finds out...?

2111
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:48,501
I mean, about my
setting him up for the...?

2112
01:46:48,537 --> 01:46:50,027
Oh, no.

2113
01:46:50,071 --> 01:46:52,596
I'd be taking
a terrible chance. I...

2114
01:46:52,641 --> 01:46:55,166
Listen, it's worth
every penny of it.

2115
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:57,838
This way, you come out
with something!

2116
01:46:57,879 --> 01:46:59,312
Without Rina,
or the studio

2117
01:46:59,347 --> 01:47:01,508
how long do you think
it's going to take

2118
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:02,676
before he fires you?

2119
01:47:02,717 --> 01:47:04,116
Come on, get smart.

2120
01:47:04,152 --> 01:47:05,949
Suppose he won't meet
this morning?

2121
01:47:05,987 --> 01:47:07,818
Well, see that he does.

2122
01:47:07,856 --> 01:47:09,323
15º/º of $5 million.

2123
01:47:10,992 --> 01:47:12,289
$750,000.

2124
01:47:12,327 --> 01:47:14,625
Yeah. Nice little
nest egg, isn't it?

2125
01:47:14,663 --> 01:47:15,960
Come on, get busy.

2126
01:47:15,997 --> 01:47:17,259
I'll pull my lawyers
out of bed

2127
01:47:17,299 --> 01:47:18,789
and draw up two papers
of agreement.

2128
01:47:18,834 --> 01:47:19,960
We'll sign yours first.

2129
01:47:20,001 --> 01:47:21,628
Bernie...

2130
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:23,137
Yeah, sure.

2131
01:47:23,171 --> 01:47:24,138
Good. This is the day

2132
01:47:24,172 --> 01:47:25,639
we pluck Jonas Cord's
feathers.

2133
01:47:25,674 --> 01:47:26,641
Now, listen you.

2134
01:47:26,675 --> 01:47:28,302
You be at his hotel
at 8:00 sharp.

2135
01:47:28,343 --> 01:47:29,310
Not a minute late.

2136
01:47:29,344 --> 01:47:32,336
Sure. Not a minute late.

2137
01:47:33,849 --> 01:47:36,181
Yes!

2138
01:47:41,022 --> 01:47:43,149
Why this morning, like that?

2139
01:47:43,191 --> 01:47:45,489
Well, he's scared.

2140
01:47:45,527 --> 01:47:47,927
You know he's had a
couple of heart attacks

2141
01:47:47,963 --> 01:47:49,863
and last night
his doctor told him

2142
01:47:49,898 --> 01:47:52,992
he was on the edge of a third
and possible final attack

2143
01:47:53,034 --> 01:47:55,502
and he called me.

2144
01:47:55,537 --> 01:47:56,504
He wants to retire.

2145
01:47:56,538 --> 01:47:58,005
Jonas, you got him
on the hook.

2146
01:47:58,039 --> 01:47:59,199
Don't let him get away.

2147
01:48:00,876 --> 01:48:02,537
I'll get it.

2148
01:48:06,314 --> 01:48:07,281
Hello.

2149
01:48:07,315 --> 01:48:09,943
No, he's not at the moment.

2150
01:48:09,985 --> 01:48:12,954
I-I really don't know.

2151
01:48:12,988 --> 01:48:15,115
That's funny.

2152
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:16,384
Norman's lawyer.

2153
01:48:16,424 --> 01:48:19,291
Probably wants
to talk him out of it.

2154
01:48:19,327 --> 01:48:20,794
How much does he want?

2155
01:48:20,829 --> 01:48:22,797
Five million.

2156
01:48:22,831 --> 01:48:23,820
What'll he take?

2157
01:48:23,865 --> 01:48:25,298
Well, he wouldn't say.

2158
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:26,800
Guess.

2159
01:48:26,835 --> 01:48:29,827
Oh, four... and a half.

2160
01:48:36,845 --> 01:48:39,177
Uh, could you hold it
just a moment, please?

2161
01:48:40,348 --> 01:48:41,474
Oh, Mr. Woolf, Mr. Norman.

2162
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:42,676
Come in, won't you, please?

2163
01:48:43,852 --> 01:48:44,819
Yes?

2164
01:48:44,853 --> 01:48:46,650
Uh, no, no.

2165
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:48,188
No, you can't.

2166
01:48:48,223 --> 01:48:49,349
Morning, Mr. Cord.

2167
01:48:49,391 --> 01:48:50,358
Hold all calls

2168
01:48:50,392 --> 01:48:52,053
for the next half hour.

2169
01:48:52,093 --> 01:48:53,287
Hold them anyway.

2170
01:48:53,328 --> 01:48:55,091
My nephew, David.

2171
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:56,529
Mr. Cord.
Well, well, well.

2172
01:48:56,564 --> 01:48:58,657
We all finally get together
in one room.

2173
01:48:58,767 --> 01:49:00,826
Oh, here, Bernie,
you better sit down.

2174
01:49:00,869 --> 01:49:02,803
Excuse me.

2175
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:13,904
So you want to sell
at 8:00 in the morning?

2176
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:18,113
Mr. Cord...

2177
01:49:18,153 --> 01:49:20,883
that's a trick
I learned from you.

2178
01:49:20,922 --> 01:49:24,449
You see, you're at
your best late at night.

2179
01:49:24,492 --> 01:49:27,950
Me, I'm an early riser.

2180
01:49:27,996 --> 01:49:30,897
I figure it gives me
some advantage.

2181
01:49:30,932 --> 01:49:34,129
Besides...

2182
01:49:34,169 --> 01:49:38,299
I could be dead in 24 hours.

2183
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:41,605
So, not another minute
do I want to work

2184
01:49:41,643 --> 01:49:42,632
in this business.

2185
01:49:42,677 --> 01:49:43,905
How much?

2186
01:49:43,945 --> 01:49:46,470
Well, it's a sacrifice.

2187
01:49:46,514 --> 01:49:50,450
I have to-I have
to think of others.

2188
01:49:50,485 --> 01:49:51,577
My family...

2189
01:49:51,619 --> 01:49:52,608
How much?

2190
01:49:56,191 --> 01:49:58,751
Take it off my hands--
$5 million.

2191
01:49:58,793 --> 01:50:01,523
It pains me to see you
make such a sacrifice.

2192
01:50:01,563 --> 01:50:02,825
I'll give you three.

2193
01:50:02,864 --> 01:50:05,332
That's a million below
the market.

2194
01:50:05,367 --> 01:50:07,631
Which I helped to make.

2195
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:10,502
All right.

2196
01:50:10,538 --> 01:50:12,870
Listen, four-and-a-half.

2197
01:50:12,907 --> 01:50:14,772
Three-and-a-half.

2198
01:50:14,809 --> 01:50:17,471
Four.

2199
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:18,536
Three-and-a-half.

2200
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:20,172
And if you say four again,

2201
01:50:20,215 --> 01:50:22,012
I'll go back to three.

2202
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:24,848
Mr. Cord...

2203
01:50:24,886 --> 01:50:28,014
you're cheating a sick man.

2204
01:50:28,056 --> 01:50:30,183
All right.

2205
01:50:30,225 --> 01:50:33,023
All right.

2206
01:50:33,061 --> 01:50:35,894
Here's two letters
of agreement.

2207
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:39,195
Just fill in the amount
and sign it.

2208
01:50:39,234 --> 01:50:41,725
I've already signed it.

2209
01:51:02,424 --> 01:51:04,358
Witness that.

2210
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,575
David.

2211
01:51:28,616 --> 01:51:32,017
I told you to hold the calls.

2212
01:51:32,053 --> 01:51:34,453
Sorry, wrong number.

2213
01:51:36,591 --> 01:51:38,650
Thank you.

2214
01:51:38,693 --> 01:51:40,558
Thanks.

2215
01:51:47,302 --> 01:51:50,032
Well...

2216
01:51:50,071 --> 01:51:52,335
that's it, Mr. Cord.

2217
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:54,807
You now own Bernard
P. Norman Pictures.

2218
01:51:54,843 --> 01:51:56,868
Thanks.

2219
01:51:56,911 --> 01:51:58,435
"Thanks".

2220
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:01,711
You remember once
I told you, "One day"?

2221
01:52:01,816 --> 01:52:03,579
"One day".

2222
01:52:03,618 --> 01:52:06,246
Do you remember?

2223
01:52:06,287 --> 01:52:08,983
Well, this is the
day, Mr. Smart One.

2224
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:12,925
When you bought Norman Studios,
you bought a corpse.

2225
01:52:18,133 --> 01:52:20,067
What's that supposed to mean?

2226
01:52:20,101 --> 01:52:23,400
At this moment, your great
drunken star, Rina Marlowe,

2227
01:52:23,438 --> 01:52:26,669
is in the hospital dying
of an automobile accident.

2228
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:30,166
Here, you'll need it.

2229
01:52:44,058 --> 01:52:45,423
I-I didn't know.

2230
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:49,260
Not until this very
second, I swear it.

2231
01:52:49,297 --> 01:52:50,787
Jonas, I work for you.

2232
01:52:50,832 --> 01:52:52,595
How-how could
you even...?

2233
01:53:00,909 --> 01:53:02,274
Hey, there he is now.

2234
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:03,777
Here he is,
ladies and gentlemen.

2235
01:53:03,811 --> 01:53:05,870
Here he is, Jonas Cord.
I'm Virginia Gray.

2236
01:53:05,914 --> 01:53:07,973
My radio audience wants
to know, did you love her?

2237
01:53:08,016 --> 01:53:09,313
When did you hear, Mr. Cord?

2238
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:10,874
Was she really your
mother, Mr. Cord?

2239
01:53:10,919 --> 01:53:12,011
Was she really your mother?

2240
01:53:12,053 --> 01:53:13,452
Did you say was?

2241
01:53:13,488 --> 01:53:15,080
She's dead.

2242
01:53:15,123 --> 01:53:17,387
She died 20 minutes ago.

2243
01:53:39,013 --> 01:53:43,109
Good morning,
and welcome back to the world.

2244
01:53:48,452 --> 01:53:50,386
How long I been here?

2245
01:53:50,421 --> 01:53:52,184
Little over a week.

2246
01:53:52,223 --> 01:53:55,624
You know, I've seen some big
drinkers

2247
01:53:55,659 --> 01:53:58,127
on Third Avenue in my day--

2248
01:53:58,162 --> 01:54:01,063
my own father,
God have mercy on his soul--

2249
01:54:01,098 --> 01:54:03,589
but in my sight,
you take the record.

2250
01:54:03,634 --> 01:54:07,070
New York, huh?

2251
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:13,469
I hope I didn't mistreat you.

2252
01:54:13,511 --> 01:54:15,479
Never laid a glove on me.

2253
01:54:15,513 --> 01:54:18,346
Wasn't a woman
you were looking for.

2254
01:54:18,382 --> 01:54:21,476
It was the sorrow you were
trying to boil out of you.

2255
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:40,903
It’s all there

2256
01:54:40,938 --> 01:54:43,304
except I took out
for the whiskey.

2257
01:54:47,978 --> 01:54:50,003
Hey, take it easy.

2258
01:54:51,649 --> 01:54:53,776
Come on.

2259
01:55:02,893 --> 01:55:04,724
Sit down.

2260
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:08,290
When you feel up to it,

2261
01:55:08,332 --> 01:55:09,924
there's a razor in the bathroom.

2262
01:55:09,967 --> 01:55:11,229
And while you're shaving,

2263
01:55:11,268 --> 01:55:13,498
I can take your clothes
down to the cleaners

2264
01:55:13,537 --> 01:55:15,095
and have them pressed up a bit.

2265
01:55:15,139 --> 01:55:16,504
Get you some food,

2266
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:19,202
if you think you
can keep it down.

2267
01:55:19,243 --> 01:55:21,803
You're in the wrong business.

2268
01:55:21,846 --> 01:55:24,781
You ought to be
an angel of mercy.

2269
01:55:24,815 --> 01:55:27,079
The irish make
lousy hookers.

2270
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,212
We always get sentimental
over drunks.

2271
01:55:33,557 --> 01:55:36,583
Do you mind if I
give you a sermon?

2272
01:55:36,627 --> 01:55:38,094
What?

2273
01:55:38,129 --> 01:55:39,858
She's dead, you know.

2274
01:55:39,897 --> 01:55:42,695
And all the whiskey
in the world

2275
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,065
won't be bringing
her back to life.

2276
01:55:46,103 --> 01:55:48,162
Now, if you'll
try and stand up

2277
01:55:48,205 --> 01:55:49,866
and take your clothes off

2278
01:55:49,907 --> 01:55:52,432
you and I will get
on to the business

2279
01:55:52,476 --> 01:55:54,535
of living the best way we can.

2280
01:56:32,449 --> 01:56:34,713
...late from the office,
at least it's late...

2281
01:56:39,623 --> 01:56:41,215
lf you plan on working for me

2282
01:56:41,258 --> 01:56:43,488
stop looking
like small-town librarians.

2283
01:56:43,527 --> 01:56:45,461
Fix your hair,
put on higher heels,

2284
01:56:45,496 --> 01:56:47,464
shorter skirts
and half your looks.

2285
01:56:47,498 --> 01:56:49,159
Bring your books.

2286
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,598
Get the head of
the Art Department.

2287
01:56:57,641 --> 01:56:59,006
I want this place redecorated.

2288
01:56:59,043 --> 01:57:01,978
Send somebody to my hotel
to pick up my clothes.

2289
01:57:02,012 --> 01:57:03,411
Call my tailor.

2290
01:57:03,447 --> 01:57:05,847
Order four more suits,
same color.

2291
01:57:05,883 --> 01:57:07,976
Get rid of this stuff.

2292
01:57:08,018 --> 01:57:10,578
Have the barber in here
every morning, 7:00 a.m. sharp.

2293
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:13,419
Tell maintenance to open
the best cottage on the lot.

2294
01:57:13,457 --> 01:57:15,584
I'm going to live here.

2295
01:57:15,626 --> 01:57:19,858
And have the commissary keep
a cook on day and night.

2296
01:57:19,897 --> 01:57:23,094
Take the name Norman off
everything in this studio--

2297
01:57:23,133 --> 01:57:25,328
from the main gate
to the back lot--

2298
01:57:25,369 --> 01:57:27,667
and put my name up,
even on the roof.

2299
01:57:27,705 --> 01:57:31,607
Order the studio police to
keep Dan Pierce off this lot

2300
01:57:31,642 --> 01:57:33,075
till one of us dies.

2301
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:35,078
Set up appointments.

2302
01:57:35,112 --> 01:57:37,478
Nevada Smith...

2303
01:57:37,514 --> 01:57:39,607
David Woolf,

2304
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:42,016
McAllister,
my business associate,

2305
01:57:42,052 --> 01:57:44,816
and Buzz Dalton,
International Airways.

2306
01:57:44,855 --> 01:57:47,016
When you get that done,
come back.

2307
01:57:47,057 --> 01:57:48,922
There's more.

2308
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:51,587
Don't you read the papers?

2309
01:57:51,629 --> 01:57:54,462
The German army is
overrunning Europe.

2310
01:57:54,498 --> 01:57:56,125
The world is at war.

2311
01:57:56,166 --> 01:57:58,828
You've got a dozen businesses
standing by for orders,

2312
01:57:58,869 --> 01:58:01,463
and you sit here in this
Alice in Wonderland world,

2313
01:58:01,505 --> 01:58:03,496
cutting out paper dolls
or trying to find

2314
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:06,008
some big-busted blonde
to splash on a billboard.

2315
01:58:06,043 --> 01:58:07,874
Specifically, Buzz,
what do you want?

2316
01:58:07,911 --> 01:58:09,276
Your attention, for one thing.

2317
01:58:09,313 --> 01:58:11,873
In case you haven't heard,
the government just gave us

2318
01:58:11,915 --> 01:58:13,883
a big contract
for a two-engine bomber.

2319
01:58:13,917 --> 01:58:15,179
I heard.

2320
01:58:15,219 --> 01:58:17,050
Our Burbank plant is straining
at the seams

2321
01:58:17,087 --> 01:58:18,987
with passenger planes
and a new interceptor.

2322
01:58:19,023 --> 01:58:20,650
We can't even start
to build a bomber.

2323
01:58:20,691 --> 01:58:22,659
Get me the head of
the Story Department.

2324
01:58:22,726 --> 01:58:24,421
Of course I know
it doesn't compare

2325
01:58:24,461 --> 01:58:26,429
to a good sexy
boy-meets-girl situation,

2326
01:58:26,463 --> 01:58:29,432
but it's the biggest first-act
curtain I've seen this year.

2327
01:58:29,466 --> 01:58:31,229
Question is,
where's our second act?

2328
01:58:31,268 --> 01:58:33,463
This morning, I bought an
airplane factory in Buffalo.

2329
01:58:33,504 --> 01:58:35,870
I hired a private detective
agency to find Amos Winthrop.

2330
01:58:35,906 --> 01:58:37,168
I want him to run it.

2331
01:58:37,207 --> 01:58:39,004
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

2332
01:58:39,043 --> 01:58:42,501
Yeah, just for the record,
what the hell makes you tick?

2333
01:58:45,616 --> 01:58:47,880
I want you to make a series
of low-budget westerns

2334
01:58:47,918 --> 01:58:49,385
based on the Max
Sand character.

2335
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:50,978
You've got a long
and steady future

2336
01:58:51,021 --> 01:58:53,751
in this business, if we bring
your pictures in at a price.

2337
01:58:56,460 --> 01:58:58,690
Did Rina say anything to you
before she died?

2338
01:58:58,796 --> 01:59:00,229
Not to me.

2339
01:59:00,264 --> 01:59:01,891
Not a word.

2340
01:59:01,932 --> 01:59:02,921
Jonas?

2341
01:59:02,966 --> 01:59:04,160
What?

2342
01:59:04,201 --> 01:59:06,192
Why didn't you try to help her?

2343
01:59:06,236 --> 01:59:08,363
You were the only one who could.

2344
01:59:10,307 --> 01:59:13,538
She was doomed
from the start, Nevada.

2345
01:59:13,577 --> 01:59:16,239
There are people
on this Earth like that,

2346
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:18,111
beyond human help.

2347
01:59:18,148 --> 01:59:20,616
Maybe you're right.

2348
01:59:22,386 --> 01:59:24,251
When do I start?

2349
01:59:24,288 --> 01:59:26,950
Monday.

2350
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:30,118
Make sure the new contract
for the talent school

2351
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:32,321
includes the right
for the studio

2352
01:59:32,363 --> 01:59:35,196
to change the actors'
names if we want to.

2353
01:59:35,232 --> 01:59:37,996
Anything else, Mac?

2354
01:59:38,035 --> 01:59:40,230
Mac?

2355
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:43,171
Well, there's one thing more.

2356
01:59:45,376 --> 01:59:46,843
Jonas, I'm tired.

2357
01:59:46,877 --> 01:59:47,844
I want out.

2358
01:59:47,878 --> 01:59:48,970
Sure, Mac.

2359
01:59:49,012 --> 01:59:50,843
Take a month off,
two, if you need it.

2360
01:59:50,881 --> 01:59:52,041
We'll manage.

2361
01:59:52,082 --> 01:59:55,882
Oh, you'll manage,
all right, but I can't.

2362
01:59:55,919 --> 01:59:58,911
No, for years, I've been hoping

2363
01:59:58,956 --> 02:00:02,187
to get things organized
so that...

2364
02:00:02,226 --> 02:00:04,251
I'm a neat man, Jonas.

2365
02:00:04,294 --> 02:00:07,263
And you don't like
my corporate mess?

2366
02:00:07,297 --> 02:00:09,356
It’s exciting.

2367
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:11,061
Too exciting for me.

2368
02:00:11,101 --> 02:00:12,625
It’s eating me up.

2369
02:00:12,669 --> 02:00:15,399
Oh, I'm supposed to be
second-in-command

2370
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:18,431
yet I'm not really sure
what it's all about

2371
02:00:18,475 --> 02:00:21,535
because I... well,
because it's not in here.

2372
02:00:21,578 --> 02:00:23,205
It’s all in your head.

2373
02:00:23,247 --> 02:00:25,943
Only you know
how all the pieces fit.

2374
02:00:25,983 --> 02:00:28,281
You like it that way,
keep it that way.

2375
02:00:28,318 --> 02:00:30,718
You're the boss,
the total boss.

2376
02:00:30,788 --> 02:00:33,416
The rest of us are
messenger boys,

2377
02:00:33,457 --> 02:00:34,856
yes men.

2378
02:00:34,892 --> 02:00:36,223
What you're trying to say is

2379
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:38,421
you don't like my being involved
in all this?

2380
02:00:38,462 --> 02:00:40,327
No, what I'm trying to say

2381
02:00:40,364 --> 02:00:42,889
is that,
from a business standpoint,

2382
02:00:42,933 --> 02:00:45,128
you're crazy.

2383
02:00:46,937 --> 02:00:49,497
You're fired.

2384
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:52,407
Here's where you get off.

2385
02:00:52,443 --> 02:00:54,843
Good-bye, Mac.

2386
02:00:56,113 --> 02:00:58,206
That's a good line, Jonas.

2387
02:00:58,248 --> 02:01:01,979
And now it all makes sense.

2388
02:01:02,019 --> 02:01:03,953
You're not Jonas Cord, Jr.
at all.

2389
02:01:03,987 --> 02:01:06,114
You're somebody else.

2390
02:01:06,156 --> 02:01:09,284
You're acting out a part,
trying to be somebody else.

2391
02:01:10,828 --> 02:01:13,695
No wonder all this make-believe.

2392
02:01:13,797 --> 02:01:14,991
It was inevitable.

2393
02:01:15,032 --> 02:01:17,193
You've been acting
all your life,

2394
02:01:17,234 --> 02:01:20,203
and you've finally found
a big enough stage.

2395
02:01:23,307 --> 02:01:24,706
Well, I must say,

2396
02:01:24,741 --> 02:01:28,336
it was a bang-up, first-class,
fascinating performance.

2397
02:01:28,378 --> 02:01:31,836
Even I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.

2398
02:01:31,882 --> 02:01:35,340
What do you know!

2399
02:01:35,385 --> 02:01:37,580
Anyway, good-bye, Jonas.

2400
02:01:37,621 --> 02:01:39,452
It was one hell of a play.

2401
02:01:39,490 --> 02:01:42,288
There's only one more thing
I could ask for.

2402
02:01:42,326 --> 02:01:45,693
I'd like to be around when you
finally take off the makeup.

2403
02:01:45,729 --> 02:01:47,390
I'd give a year's pay to know

2404
02:01:47,431 --> 02:01:49,331
who you really are underneath.

2405
02:01:49,366 --> 02:01:51,357
Who knows?

2406
02:01:51,401 --> 02:01:54,029
You might even be the devil.

2407
02:02:05,983 --> 02:02:07,883
Miss Denton is here, Mr. Cord.

2408
02:02:07,918 --> 02:02:08,907
Who?

2409
02:02:08,952 --> 02:02:09,919
Miss Jennie Denton.

2410
02:02:09,953 --> 02:02:11,250
She's here for a screen test.

2411
02:02:11,288 --> 02:02:12,687
Never heard of her.

2412
02:02:12,756 --> 02:02:15,088
Well, apparently,
Mr. Pierce had set it up.

2413
02:02:15,125 --> 02:02:18,094
Pierce. Cancel it.

2414
02:02:21,565 --> 02:02:23,192
Miss Denton, you...

2415
02:02:23,233 --> 02:02:25,667
I just wanted to see
what you look like.

2416
02:02:27,337 --> 02:02:31,137
The great, towering,
remote Jonas Cord

2417
02:02:31,174 --> 02:02:32,698
who makes and breaks

2418
02:02:32,809 --> 02:02:34,333
who stamps his foot

2419
02:02:34,378 --> 02:02:37,677
and everything trembles
for miles around.

2420
02:02:37,714 --> 02:02:40,342
Snaps a switch and
the world goes off.

2421
02:02:42,185 --> 02:02:45,245
I never really thought there
would be a screen test,

2422
02:02:45,289 --> 02:02:48,281
but just for laughs, I
thought I'd go all the way.

2423
02:02:48,325 --> 02:02:50,816
Well, now I've seen you.

2424
02:02:50,861 --> 02:02:53,728
I can check you off my list.

2425
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:56,390
The Lincoln Memorial,
the Washington Monument,

2426
02:02:56,433 --> 02:02:57,695
the Grand Canyon,

2427
02:02:57,734 --> 02:02:58,928
Jonas Cord.

2428
02:02:58,969 --> 02:03:01,233
You're my first
disappointment.

2429
02:03:01,271 --> 02:03:04,297
I will say this for you.

2430
02:03:04,341 --> 02:03:06,673
At least there's
no Latin inscription

2431
02:03:06,743 --> 02:03:08,677
on your forehead.

2432
02:03:08,712 --> 02:03:10,680
I'm lousy at Latin.

2433
02:03:10,781 --> 02:03:13,944
Well, tempus fugit
(el tiempo pasa).

2434
02:03:13,984 --> 02:03:16,111
What did he promise you?

2435
02:03:16,153 --> 02:03:17,814
Pierce?

2436
02:03:17,854 --> 02:03:20,288
Probably what he
promises everybody.

2437
02:03:20,324 --> 02:03:21,586
Three bills for the test

2438
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,150
seven and a half a week
if and, and so on...

2439
02:03:24,194 --> 02:03:26,424
Come back here.

2440
02:03:26,463 --> 02:03:28,431
Please.

2441
02:03:30,467 --> 02:03:31,695
Please.

2442
02:03:47,618 --> 02:03:49,711
I like you.

2443
02:03:49,786 --> 02:03:52,880
Oh, now, Mr. Cord,
you're embarrassing me.

2444
02:03:52,923 --> 02:03:57,155
I'm sending a girl named Jennie
Denton for a screen test.

2445
02:03:57,194 --> 02:03:59,355
Give her all the time
and training she needs.

2446
02:03:59,396 --> 02:04:01,864
I want her to have the best
this studio can offer.

2447
02:04:01,898 --> 02:04:02,922
I'll direct it myself.

2448
02:04:02,966 --> 02:04:04,524
Very well, Mr. Cord.

2449
02:04:07,801 --> 02:04:08,790
Hello?

2450
02:04:08,836 --> 02:04:10,963
Oh, yeah.

2451
02:04:11,004 --> 02:04:15,270
Monica, it's for you--
long distance.

2452
02:04:15,309 --> 02:04:17,334
Hello?

2453
02:04:19,346 --> 02:04:21,246
Jonas, what a surprise.

2454
02:04:21,281 --> 02:04:23,272
It’s nearly eight years.

2455
02:04:23,317 --> 02:04:26,445
My father? Why do you
want to know?

2456
02:04:26,487 --> 02:04:30,287
Yes, I do, but I gave him my
word I wouldn't tell anybody.

2457
02:04:30,324 --> 02:04:34,385
Yes, he's off it,
he's all right.

2458
02:04:36,396 --> 02:04:39,331
You really want him for that,
Jonas? Really?

2459
02:04:39,366 --> 02:04:41,493
May I have a cigarette, please?

2460
02:04:41,535 --> 02:04:43,093
Well, I don't know.

2461
02:04:43,137 --> 02:04:46,629
The last time I mentioned
your name, he...

2462
02:04:46,673 --> 02:04:49,972
Yes, I know it's important,
but he hates you thoroughly.

2463
02:04:53,113 --> 02:04:58,016
No... no, I don't.

2464
02:04:58,051 --> 02:05:00,019
All right, if it's that vital

2465
02:05:00,053 --> 02:05:02,385
he's in Chicago,
working in a factory.

2466
02:05:02,422 --> 02:05:04,686
He's running a lathe
under an assumed name.

2467
02:05:05,893 --> 02:05:08,453
Because that's the way
he wanted it.

2468
02:05:11,899 --> 02:05:13,958
Well, certainly not
before Friday night.

2469
02:05:14,001 --> 02:05:15,491
I have a magazine to get out.

2470
02:05:18,238 --> 02:05:20,900
The... Ambassador.

2471
02:05:24,244 --> 02:05:28,203
Yes. Definitely.

2472
02:05:28,248 --> 02:05:30,512
Good-bye, Jonas.

2473
02:05:34,354 --> 02:05:36,219
Now, which Jonas
is that?

2474
02:05:36,256 --> 02:05:38,087
Is there more than one?

2475
02:05:40,694 --> 02:05:42,252
Good morning, boss!

2476
02:05:42,296 --> 02:05:45,060
What are you so
happy about today?

2477
02:05:45,098 --> 02:05:47,623
Oh, I feel like
somebody important.

2478
02:05:47,668 --> 02:05:49,158
Like a queen, maybe.

2479
02:05:49,203 --> 02:05:51,728
Everywhere I go on the lot,
people smile at me and wave

2480
02:05:51,805 --> 02:05:52,965
or say, "Hi, Jennie",

2481
02:05:53,006 --> 02:05:54,940
"Hello, Jennie",
"Good morning, Miss Denton".

2482
02:05:54,975 --> 02:05:56,943
Hey, was the test
that good?

2483
02:05:56,977 --> 02:05:58,740
You're just the kind of girl

2484
02:05:58,845 --> 02:06:01,712
people like to smile
at, wave at, look at.

2485
02:06:02,983 --> 02:06:04,314
What's this?

2486
02:06:04,351 --> 02:06:07,582
Six copies of a seven-year
contract with Cord Studios.

2487
02:06:07,621 --> 02:06:10,681
Check them over
with your lawyer.

2488
02:06:10,724 --> 02:06:13,056
If you like it, sign 'em.

2489
02:06:15,128 --> 02:06:17,619
Jonas, I'm going
to ask you something

2490
02:06:17,664 --> 02:06:19,359
that might make you mad.

2491
02:06:19,399 --> 02:06:22,300
Ask it now, instead of later.

2492
02:06:22,336 --> 02:06:25,271
Will I be under contract
as an actress...

2493
02:06:25,305 --> 02:06:27,705
or as some executive's
girlfriend?

2494
02:06:27,808 --> 02:06:30,800
That contract's
strictly for the screen.

2495
02:06:30,844 --> 02:06:31,868
I like you.

2496
02:06:31,912 --> 02:06:34,710
Well enough to fly
to Chicago with me

2497
02:06:34,748 --> 02:06:36,477
in a couple of hours?

2498
02:06:36,516 --> 02:06:38,575
Mm, I don't know about that.

2499
02:06:38,619 --> 02:06:40,985
It gets pretty cold in Chicago.

2500
02:06:41,021 --> 02:06:43,717
I'll find some way
to keep you warm.

2501
02:06:43,790 --> 02:06:47,157
...paragraph one of this
memorandum, "You agree"...

2502
02:06:47,194 --> 02:06:48,593
-In there.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Cord.

2503
02:06:48,629 --> 02:06:49,891
"You agree to render
such services

2504
02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:52,364
"as the undersigned
corporation may request of you

2505
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:55,163
"under and pursuant to the
provision that employment"...

2506
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:58,269
They're beautiful!

2507
02:06:58,305 --> 02:07:01,706
''...shall request during said
period of your incapacity...''

2508
02:07:06,246 --> 02:07:07,270
Thank you, Mr. Cord!

2509
02:07:07,314 --> 02:07:08,679
"...in less case,
on such day or days

2510
02:07:08,749 --> 02:07:10,876
"you shall be actually be unable
to render such"...

2511
02:07:15,622 --> 02:07:17,988
Yeah?

2512
02:07:18,025 --> 02:07:19,049
Hello, Jonas.

2513
02:07:25,999 --> 02:07:28,024
You look wonderful, Monica.

2514
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:32,202
Jonas, I want you
to meet Joanne.

2515
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:33,968
Joanne, this is Mr. Cord.

2516
02:07:34,007 --> 02:07:35,736
How do you do, Mr. Cord?

2517
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:41,011
You're a big girl.

2518
02:07:41,048 --> 02:07:43,107
Just as pretty as your mama.

2519
02:07:43,150 --> 02:07:45,482
Nobody's that pretty.

2520
02:07:46,753 --> 02:07:49,221
Mommy, you said we
were going to have lunch.

2521
02:07:49,256 --> 02:07:50,223
Joanne...

2522
02:07:50,257 --> 02:07:51,622
I think it's a great idea.

2523
02:07:51,658 --> 02:07:53,956
I never ate in a hotel
dining room before.

2524
02:07:53,994 --> 02:07:56,895
Okay, Joanne, it's
the Pump Room for us.

2525
02:07:56,930 --> 02:07:58,227
I'll get my coat.

2526
02:07:58,265 --> 02:08:00,324
Jonas, it's beautiful...

2527
02:08:05,005 --> 02:08:06,495
Oh, I...

2528
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:08,474
I'm sorry.

2529
02:08:10,277 --> 02:08:12,177
I beg your pardon,
Jonas.

2530
02:08:12,212 --> 02:08:15,511
I seemed to have played
this scene before.

2531
02:08:15,549 --> 02:08:17,540
-Come on, Joanne.
-Mommy...

2532
02:08:17,584 --> 02:08:18,608
I said, come on.

2533
02:08:18,652 --> 02:08:20,244
Monica,

2534
02:08:20,287 --> 02:08:23,279
wait a minute.

2535
02:08:23,323 --> 02:08:26,156
There's the name and address
that you wanted.

2536
02:08:26,193 --> 02:08:31,187
Do both of us a favor...
don't ever come near me again.

2537
02:08:45,512 --> 02:08:46,706
Jonas...

2538
02:08:46,813 --> 02:08:49,976
I didn't mean
to louse things up for you.

2539
02:08:50,016 --> 02:08:52,041
You didn't do anything.

2540
02:08:57,057 --> 02:08:58,649
Things were loused up
a long time ago.

2541
02:09:02,129 --> 02:09:05,064
You like the coat?

2542
02:09:05,098 --> 02:09:07,362
So much, I don't know
what to say.

2543
02:09:07,401 --> 02:09:10,370
Then don't say anything--
just show me.

2544
02:09:40,997 --> 02:09:43,056
Oh, Jonas!

2545
02:09:47,604 --> 02:09:49,037
I'm speechless.

2546
02:09:49,072 --> 02:09:51,632
You don't have to say much.

2547
02:09:51,675 --> 02:09:53,438
"Yes" or "no" will do.

2548
02:09:53,477 --> 02:09:55,741
But you've done so much
for me already.

2549
02:09:55,779 --> 02:09:56,973
You don't have to...

2550
02:09:57,013 --> 02:09:59,208
I never do what I have to--

2551
02:09:59,249 --> 02:10:01,012
only what I want to.

2552
02:10:07,724 --> 02:10:10,284
Oh, Jonas.

2553
02:10:10,327 --> 02:10:13,888
Oh, darling...

2554
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:16,728
There's no one like
you in the whole world.

2555
02:10:18,335 --> 02:10:21,099
My, my. You really hit
the jackpot this time

2556
02:10:21,137 --> 02:10:22,104
didn't you, honey?

2557
02:10:22,138 --> 02:10:24,072
Mm-hmm.

2558
02:10:24,107 --> 02:10:25,972
Old star-maker

2559
02:10:26,009 --> 02:10:27,408
marriage broker,
Dan Pierce.

2560
02:10:27,444 --> 02:10:31,141
Pyg... malion's agent.

2561
02:10:32,616 --> 02:10:36,074
Takes a handful of...
shall we say... dirt?

2562
02:10:36,119 --> 02:10:38,781
And makes it into
a diamond ring.

2563
02:10:38,822 --> 02:10:41,450
A rag, a bone,
and a hank of hair

2564
02:10:41,491 --> 02:10:44,619
and presto--
the Bride of Frankenstein.

2565
02:10:44,661 --> 02:10:47,391
You grateful?

2566
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:49,694
-Extremely.
-Then show it.

2567
02:10:49,733 --> 02:10:51,496
Well, not with
this script, Dan.

2568
02:10:51,535 --> 02:10:52,524
It’s not for me.

2569
02:10:52,569 --> 02:10:53,797
It is if you say it is.

2570
02:10:53,904 --> 02:10:56,372
What Jennie wants,
Jennie gets these days.

2571
02:10:56,406 --> 02:10:59,170
While you're laying on
the pillow, whisper in his ear,

2572
02:10:59,209 --> 02:11:01,040
and he'll buy it,
and for $300,000.

2573
02:11:02,145 --> 02:11:04,238
You used to get 200 bucks.

2574
02:11:04,281 --> 02:11:06,545
Wouldn't it give you a kick

2575
02:11:06,583 --> 02:11:10,713
to hear somebody tell you
it was worth $300,000?

2576
02:11:10,754 --> 02:11:13,518
I couldn't do that to him.

2577
02:11:15,258 --> 02:11:16,350
Too much for an old pal

2578
02:11:16,393 --> 02:11:18,452
who showed you
the way to millions, huh?

2579
02:11:18,495 --> 02:11:19,553
It’s too much.

2580
02:11:19,596 --> 02:11:21,826
Ooh! Conscience,
character...

2581
02:11:23,433 --> 02:11:24,764
Well, I always say,

2582
02:11:24,834 --> 02:11:29,203
there's nothing more righteous
than a reformed hooker.

2583
02:11:29,239 --> 02:11:33,403
Well, Jenny girl,
you leave me no choice.

2584
02:11:37,681 --> 02:11:43,449
A little present...
for you.

2585
02:11:43,486 --> 02:11:45,920
Pandora's box.

2586
02:11:45,956 --> 02:11:47,719
Go ahead, open it up.

2587
02:11:47,757 --> 02:11:49,520
Oh, here, let me help you.

2588
02:11:56,333 --> 02:11:59,496
Jennie Denton's
first starring role.

2589
02:11:59,536 --> 02:12:02,369
Recognize yourself
in the group?

2590
02:12:02,405 --> 02:12:05,738
You're the one that's
wearing the goose pimple.

2591
02:12:05,775 --> 02:12:13,113
Jennie, I'll... I'll
leave this... for you.

2592
02:12:14,384 --> 02:12:15,976
Course, being
a far-sighted fellow,

2593
02:12:16,019 --> 02:12:17,611
I have a couple
dozen more copies,

2594
02:12:17,654 --> 02:12:18,746
just in case you wanted

2595
02:12:18,788 --> 02:12:20,585
to give some to your friends...
or I do.

2596
02:12:20,624 --> 02:12:23,024
By the way,
it might make

2597
02:12:23,059 --> 02:12:25,755
a nice wedding gift
for Jonas.

2598
02:12:25,795 --> 02:12:28,889
He could run it on your
honeymoon for inspiration.

2599
02:12:28,932 --> 02:12:31,298
And information, too.

2600
02:12:31,334 --> 02:12:35,236
Jennie, dear,
read the script again.

2601
02:12:35,271 --> 02:12:37,705
I think you'll
love it this time.

2602
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:41,643
You know, Jennie baby, Jonas
doesn't know about you.

2603
02:12:41,678 --> 02:12:44,340
He's a great man
with a corporation,

2604
02:12:44,381 --> 02:12:48,112
but when it comes to people,
he's a real... jerk.

2605
02:12:49,919 --> 02:12:55,152
Oh, when the check arrives,
you can have the other copies.

2606
02:12:57,293 --> 02:12:59,955
Well, toodle-ooh, Jennie.

2607
02:12:59,996 --> 02:13:02,863
Onward and... upward.

2608
02:13:09,673 --> 02:13:10,640
Jonas?

2609
02:13:10,674 --> 02:13:11,641
In here.

2610
02:13:11,675 --> 02:13:12,937
-Hi, Jennie.
-Hello, Jennie!

2611
02:13:12,976 --> 02:13:14,102
Hello, honey.

2612
02:13:14,144 --> 02:13:15,611
I've been trying
all day to reach you.

2613
02:13:15,645 --> 02:13:17,306
Well, I had to fly to Vegas.
I just got in.

2614
02:13:17,347 --> 02:13:18,371
I've got to talk to you, Jonas.

2615
02:13:18,415 --> 02:13:19,575
Sure, but take off your coat

2616
02:13:19,616 --> 02:13:20,583
and have a drink first.

2617
02:13:20,617 --> 02:13:22,585
Now. It’s important.

2618
02:13:22,619 --> 02:13:23,643
All right.

2619
02:13:25,288 --> 02:13:27,279
Drink up,
we'll be right back.

2620
02:13:34,998 --> 02:13:36,795
What happened?

2621
02:13:39,302 --> 02:13:42,032
Jonas, I can't go
through with it.

2622
02:13:44,908 --> 02:13:49,470
All right, you can't
go through with it.

2623
02:13:49,512 --> 02:13:51,104
Let's eat dinner.

2624
02:13:51,147 --> 02:13:52,444
Does it mean
that little to you?

2625
02:13:52,482 --> 02:13:53,949
No, but I'll pay you
the compliment

2626
02:13:53,983 --> 02:13:55,780
of taking your word
the whole thing's wrong

2627
02:13:55,819 --> 02:13:56,911
and let it go at that.

2628
02:13:58,688 --> 02:14:01,054
I don't want to
take the easy way out

2629
02:14:01,091 --> 02:14:02,285
because I love you.

2630
02:14:02,325 --> 02:14:03,519
Of course you do--

2631
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:05,187
and we've got hungry
friends waiting out there.

2632
02:14:05,228 --> 02:14:06,855
No, Jonas, you don't
know anything about me--

2633
02:14:06,896 --> 02:14:08,591
who I am, where I come from,
what I've done...

2634
02:14:08,631 --> 02:14:09,620
I know all I need to.

2635
02:14:09,666 --> 02:14:10,963
No, you don't.
You couldn't.

2636
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,401
Well, gentlemen...

2637
02:14:14,437 --> 02:14:16,234
the betting window
is now open.

2638
02:14:16,272 --> 02:14:18,263
I'll give you Cupid
and ten points

2639
02:14:18,308 --> 02:14:19,434
and back the devil.

2640
02:14:19,476 --> 02:14:20,602
Put me down for $100

2641
02:14:20,643 --> 02:14:22,508
and pay me off
at the wedding, huh?

2642
02:14:22,545 --> 02:14:23,534
Son, you're on.

2643
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:25,172
But there ain't
gonna be no wedding.

2644
02:14:25,215 --> 02:14:28,707
Little Ella is on her
way back to the cinders.

2645
02:14:28,752 --> 02:14:30,583
What made you say that?

2646
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:33,316
Experience... percentage...
track record...

2647
02:14:33,356 --> 02:14:36,086
plus the fact that
she's obviously in there

2648
02:14:36,126 --> 02:14:38,390
making some last
minute confession.

2649
02:14:39,963 --> 02:14:43,160
To Jonas, the word confession
reads the same as "excuse",

2650
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:44,689
and you know what
he thinks of that word.

2651
02:14:47,203 --> 02:14:49,763
Jennie Denton--
lovely young screen star.

2652
02:14:49,806 --> 02:14:52,001
Desired, envied, sought after.

2653
02:14:52,041 --> 02:14:55,704
Well, there she is in her
greatest starring role.

2654
02:14:55,745 --> 02:14:58,578
Let's all have
one for the road, which--

2655
02:14:58,615 --> 02:15:01,607
if we're smart--
we'll hit... post-haste.

2656
02:15:03,319 --> 02:15:05,082
Jonas...

2657
02:15:07,157 --> 02:15:08,715
I'm sorry.

2658
02:15:15,465 --> 02:15:20,630
I'm more than sorry...
I'm ashamed.

2659
02:15:20,670 --> 02:15:23,935
You were so good to me,
you deserve better.

2660
02:15:23,973 --> 02:15:27,204
All I can give you
in return is the truth,

2661
02:15:27,243 --> 02:15:28,642
as dirty as it is.

2662
02:15:28,678 --> 02:15:30,202
We'll pay Pierce's blackmail,

2663
02:15:30,246 --> 02:15:32,305
then I'll take care
of him my own way.

2664
02:15:32,348 --> 02:15:33,906
And what good will that do?

2665
02:15:33,950 --> 02:15:36,748
Another Pierce will show up,
and then another.

2666
02:15:36,786 --> 02:15:38,481
Even you haven't got
enough money

2667
02:15:38,521 --> 02:15:40,045
to buy off
all the Dan Pierces

2668
02:15:40,089 --> 02:15:42,353
who had your lovely
fiancée before you did.

2669
02:15:42,392 --> 02:15:44,326
Let me worry about that.

2670
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,657
Oh, Jonas, I'm only good
for one thing!

2671
02:15:45,695 --> 02:15:46,753
I can't even have children!

2672
02:15:46,863 --> 02:15:48,888
Don't you think I know that?

2673
02:15:48,932 --> 02:15:51,662
How could you?

2674
02:15:51,701 --> 02:15:55,501
I know everything about
everybody who works for me.

2675
02:15:57,173 --> 02:16:02,042
You were born at 7:02 a.m.,
delivered by Dr. Corn.

2676
02:16:02,078 --> 02:16:05,707
You were attacked, successfully,
by three boys in a public park

2677
02:16:05,782 --> 02:16:07,181
at the age of 15.

2678
02:16:07,217 --> 02:16:09,811
You worked as a student nurse,
liked better things,

2679
02:16:09,853 --> 02:16:10,945
turned pro at 20.

2680
02:16:10,987 --> 02:16:13,012
New Orleans, San Francisco,
Las Vegas,

2681
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,717
your house in Coldwater Canyon.

2682
02:16:14,824 --> 02:16:16,485
I can name you dollars, dates,

2683
02:16:16,526 --> 02:16:17,993
and anything else you want.

2684
02:16:18,027 --> 02:16:20,518
As for this film...

2685
02:16:20,563 --> 02:16:23,054
I've seen it twice.

2686
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:25,431
You had good lighting
and a bad director.

2687
02:16:27,637 --> 02:16:29,537
You knew.

2688
02:16:29,572 --> 02:16:32,735
Of course I did.

2689
02:16:32,809 --> 02:16:36,404
You were no good,
that's why I wanted you.

2690
02:16:36,446 --> 02:16:37,470
You were beautiful
and no good,

2691
02:16:37,513 --> 02:16:38,741
that made it better.

2692
02:16:38,781 --> 02:16:40,408
And when I found out you
couldn't have children,

2693
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:42,611
-you were perfect.
-Jonas, don't!

2694
02:16:42,652 --> 02:16:44,176
Don't say anymore!

2695
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:46,450
One of us is crazy, but I'm not
sure which one it is.

2696
02:16:46,489 --> 02:16:48,582
Don't you ever say that to me!

2697
02:16:48,625 --> 02:16:49,887
Jonas!

2698
02:16:49,926 --> 02:16:51,450
Why do you think
I put you in a movie,

2699
02:16:51,494 --> 02:16:52,756
spent $2 million on publicity,

2700
02:16:52,795 --> 02:16:54,854
crammed your face and figure
down everyone's minds

2701
02:16:54,898 --> 02:16:56,490
till they could
never forget it-- why?

2702
02:16:56,532 --> 02:16:59,433
Because I wanted to make you
important enough

2703
02:16:59,469 --> 02:17:01,061
to marry Jonas Cord,
and when you do--

2704
02:17:01,104 --> 02:17:03,629
and you will--

2705
02:17:03,673 --> 02:17:05,834
no one will dare
raise his voice against you,

2706
02:17:05,875 --> 02:17:08,708
or I'll step on him
like an ant.

2707
02:17:08,778 --> 02:17:10,712
This is the best sale
you ever made...

2708
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,305
and all I ask for is your beauty
and your sex.

2709
02:17:13,349 --> 02:17:15,909
I don't want love or children
or home-baked cookies.

2710
02:17:15,952 --> 02:17:18,386
I just want a woman
who's there when I need her.

2711
02:17:18,421 --> 02:17:20,252
In return,
you'll live like a queen.

2712
02:17:20,290 --> 02:17:21,848
Now pick up the ring.

2713
02:17:35,905 --> 02:17:39,341
Now, let's go to dinner,

2714
02:17:39,375 --> 02:17:41,036
make the happy announcement.

2715
02:18:08,034 --> 02:18:10,400
We all heard what
happened in there.

2716
02:18:12,138 --> 02:18:14,231
Buzz and Morrissey
couldn't listen anymore.

2717
02:18:16,609 --> 02:18:19,476
You think the two of us
can eat a dinner for five?

2718
02:18:19,512 --> 02:18:22,379
I've watched over you

2719
02:18:22,415 --> 02:18:26,146
rode with you, taught you,
believed in you

2720
02:18:26,185 --> 02:18:27,743
since you were a boy.

2721
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:30,948
I know. But...

2722
02:18:30,990 --> 02:18:34,517
You've done some strange things.

2723
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:36,289
Foolish things.

2724
02:18:36,329 --> 02:18:38,524
And brilliant things.

2725
02:18:38,564 --> 02:18:40,361
I've tried to understand them.

2726
02:18:45,671 --> 02:18:47,639
Yes, and?

2727
02:18:47,673 --> 02:18:50,733
I've watched your meanness
and your cruelty.

2728
02:18:50,776 --> 02:18:55,543
I stood by while you grew big
in power and small in humanness.

2729
02:18:55,581 --> 02:18:58,641
I've seen you make men
throw up with fear

2730
02:18:58,684 --> 02:19:01,278
and woman cry
with misery and shame.

2731
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:06,815
Oh, dialogue from one
of your old movies, Nevada.

2732
02:19:06,859 --> 02:19:08,724
But never
until this moment

2733
02:19:08,761 --> 02:19:12,492
have I judged the full measure
of your cruelty and madness.

2734
02:19:12,532 --> 02:19:15,126
To put it bluntly,
Jonas,

2735
02:19:15,168 --> 02:19:17,636
I think you're crazy.

2736
02:19:22,742 --> 02:19:25,108
I'm glad you did that, kid.

2737
02:19:25,144 --> 02:19:27,009
Now I don't need an excuse.

2738
02:19:27,046 --> 02:19:30,743
Come on, get up,
you jailbird, you killer.

2739
02:19:30,783 --> 02:19:32,148
Get up and show me
how to be normal.

2740
02:19:32,185 --> 02:19:33,948
Get up.

2741
02:22:10,376 --> 02:22:14,369
I advise you
to sell everything you own,

2742
02:22:14,413 --> 02:22:18,747
vanish into the hills.

2743
02:22:18,784 --> 02:22:21,218
Your luck just ran out
in this town.

2744
02:22:21,253 --> 02:22:26,418
By the order of Jonas Cord, Jr.

2745
02:22:26,459 --> 02:22:30,896
From the law
of supply and demand.

2746
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:35,162
Nothings like you
are no longer needed.

2747
02:22:39,071 --> 02:22:43,531
Well, go on,
cowboy star, get out.

2748
02:22:43,576 --> 02:22:46,477
Just don't try to act
your way out the door,

2749
02:22:46,512 --> 02:22:49,072
you'll never make it.

2750
02:22:49,115 --> 02:22:51,811
If it hadn't been for me,

2751
02:22:51,884 --> 02:22:54,079
you'd be back
where you belong--

2752
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,485
shoveling steer manure.

2753
02:22:55,521 --> 02:22:57,887
You don't know when
to quit, do you?

2754
02:23:01,827 --> 02:23:03,317
If you don't mind,

2755
02:23:03,362 --> 02:23:04,886
I don't usually drink
with hired hands

2756
02:23:04,930 --> 02:23:05,954
or ignorant half-breeds.

2757
02:23:05,998 --> 02:23:08,398
You don't drink with anybody

2758
02:23:08,434 --> 02:23:12,495
because nobody can stand you.

2759
02:23:12,538 --> 02:23:16,599
Just the sound of your name
makes people sick.

2760
02:23:16,642 --> 02:23:18,769
Only the weak and the jealous.

2761
02:23:18,878 --> 02:23:21,779
I took a one-horse factory,
run by an alcoholic misfit

2762
02:23:21,881 --> 02:23:24,782
and built into something
that nobody'll ever forget.

2763
02:23:24,850 --> 02:23:26,875
Only because
he gave you the means.

2764
02:23:26,919 --> 02:23:30,514
Oh, he gave me nothing.

2765
02:23:30,556 --> 02:23:35,892
If he could, he'd have locked me
in a room, like he...

2766
02:23:35,928 --> 02:23:38,089
Like he did your brother?

2767
02:23:43,903 --> 02:23:46,269
I haven't got a brother.

2768
02:23:47,573 --> 02:23:49,040
Your twin brother.

2769
02:23:49,074 --> 02:23:51,668
Never had one.

2770
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:53,644
Get out, Nevada.

2771
02:23:53,679 --> 02:23:57,012
"Joseph Cord died
before he really lived".

2772
02:23:57,049 --> 02:23:58,573
Recognize that?

2773
02:23:58,617 --> 02:24:00,346
It’s off his tombstone.

2774
02:24:00,386 --> 02:24:01,785
I said get out.

2775
02:24:01,821 --> 02:24:04,756
Born with you, died without
you at the age of nine.

2776
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:06,189
Incurably insane.

2777
02:24:11,363 --> 02:24:13,331
Incurably insane.

2778
02:24:15,334 --> 02:24:19,430
He died before
I could ever speak to him.

2779
02:24:19,472 --> 02:24:25,536
And the day he died,
my father took to this...

2780
02:24:25,578 --> 02:24:28,103
and against me.

2781
02:24:28,147 --> 02:24:30,775
He looked at me
as if I were a leper.

2782
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:35,219
Watching, waiting for the other
apple in the same barrel

2783
02:24:35,254 --> 02:24:36,949
to turn rotten on him.

2784
02:24:36,989 --> 02:24:38,786
So your brother
died raving mad

2785
02:24:38,858 --> 02:24:40,951
and your father
turned against you

2786
02:24:40,993 --> 02:24:44,724
and you decided to take it out
on everyone else around you.

2787
02:24:44,763 --> 02:24:46,196
That's your excuse?

2788
02:24:46,232 --> 02:24:50,464
That is my explanation.

2789
02:24:50,503 --> 02:24:51,800
It’s not good enough.

2790
02:24:51,837 --> 02:24:53,896
Why did you take it out on Rina?

2791
02:24:53,939 --> 02:24:56,703
I gave her as good as I got.

2792
02:24:56,742 --> 02:24:58,141
And Jennie?

2793
02:24:58,177 --> 02:24:59,667
I made her a star.

2794
02:24:59,712 --> 02:25:00,736
And Monica?

2795
02:25:00,779 --> 02:25:03,907
She wanted to be a mother.

2796
02:25:03,949 --> 02:25:05,382
Was that wrong?

2797
02:25:05,417 --> 02:25:08,409
Me as father, it was.

2798
02:25:08,454 --> 02:25:10,752
I haven't got the right
to be anybody's father.

2799
02:25:10,856 --> 02:25:13,848
Because you might have
some of your brother in you.

2800
02:25:13,893 --> 02:25:16,521
I don't know,

2801
02:25:16,562 --> 02:25:19,998
but I've lived with
the fear of it all my life.

2802
02:25:20,032 --> 02:25:22,262
Racing against time,

2803
02:25:22,301 --> 02:25:25,099
thinking any minute
of any day it could happen.

2804
02:25:25,137 --> 02:25:28,163
You rest easy, Junior.

2805
02:25:28,207 --> 02:25:32,337
You're not mad at all,
you never will be.

2806
02:25:32,378 --> 02:25:35,438
You see, you're not
like your brother.

2807
02:25:35,481 --> 02:25:36,914
You're just like your father.

2808
02:25:38,717 --> 02:25:40,947
I never was,
I never could be like him.

2809
02:25:40,986 --> 02:25:41,884
You even sound like him.

2810
02:25:41,921 --> 02:25:43,149
-Shut up!
-Hollering to make

2811
02:25:43,188 --> 02:25:44,917
-Don't say that.
-yourself important.

2812
02:25:44,957 --> 02:25:45,924
Wobbling around red-faced

2813
02:25:45,958 --> 02:25:46,947
with a drink in your hand.

2814
02:25:46,992 --> 02:25:47,788
I said shut up!

2815
02:25:47,893 --> 02:25:49,224
All right, look at him!

2816
02:25:56,268 --> 02:25:57,701
Need anymore proof?

2817
02:26:05,210 --> 02:26:07,110
Nevada.

2818
02:26:09,248 --> 02:26:10,579
What can I do?

2819
02:26:10,616 --> 02:26:14,279
Junior, I haven't
the faintest idea.

2820
02:26:55,928 --> 02:26:58,021
Let's change this color
and make it more compatible...

2821
02:26:58,063 --> 02:26:59,530
Switching the color,
that's fine,

2822
02:26:59,565 --> 02:27:01,556
but the colors have to go
in this space...

2823
02:27:02,801 --> 02:27:03,790
Hello, Monica.

2824
02:27:07,272 --> 02:27:08,933
Jonas, I'm busy.

2825
02:27:08,974 --> 02:27:11,602
I have to talk to you. Now.

2826
02:27:11,644 --> 02:27:13,737
There's nothing to talk about.

2827
02:27:13,812 --> 02:27:15,507
Just go away.

2828
02:27:15,547 --> 02:27:19,074
Well, I don't want
to make a scene

2829
02:27:19,118 --> 02:27:21,712
but if I have to, I will.

2830
02:27:27,559 --> 02:27:29,993
Jonas, I told you
I wanted you out of my life.

2831
02:27:30,029 --> 02:27:31,724
I never wanted
to see you again.

2832
02:27:31,764 --> 02:27:34,927
Monica, I only want
two minutes of your time.

2833
02:27:34,967 --> 02:27:36,491
Would you please
keep your voice down.

2834
02:27:36,535 --> 02:27:37,763
Do you want me to lose
my job?

2835
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:40,065
If I have to,
I'll buy this place.

2836
02:27:40,105 --> 02:27:42,039
Now that's typical
Cord procedure.

2837
02:27:42,074 --> 02:27:44,304
Something gets in your way,
just buy it.

2838
02:27:44,343 --> 02:27:46,777
I'm not buying anymore,
Monica, I'm selling.

2839
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:47,937
I've sold the movie studio,

2840
02:27:47,980 --> 02:27:49,607
$40 million's worth
of assorted industries,

2841
02:27:49,648 --> 02:27:51,240
and tomorrow morning
I'm meeting with...

2842
02:27:51,283 --> 02:27:53,649
What's that
supposed to mean?

2843
02:27:53,686 --> 02:27:56,951
First I've got
to tell you something.

2844
02:27:56,989 --> 02:28:00,584
I've been living
with a secret.

2845
02:28:00,626 --> 02:28:02,753
Oh, there are
no secrets about you, Jonas.

2846
02:28:02,795 --> 02:28:04,126
This is something
that nobody knows.

2847
02:28:04,163 --> 02:28:06,154
A long time ago,
Jedediah told me

2848
02:28:06,198 --> 02:28:08,530
all about your father
and your brother

2849
02:28:08,567 --> 02:28:11,593
and what it did to you.

2850
02:28:13,405 --> 02:28:17,466
Why do you think I let you do
the things you did to me?

2851
02:28:17,509 --> 02:28:21,138
Why I didn't remarry
and I waited

2852
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:24,081
hoping you'd find out
there was nothing wrong with you

2853
02:28:24,116 --> 02:28:26,084
and nothing wrong
with your daughter?

2854
02:28:26,118 --> 02:28:28,109
You know, someday,

2855
02:28:28,153 --> 02:28:30,678
you ought to take a look
at her report card.

2856
02:28:36,161 --> 02:28:39,096
I'm not promising
anything, Monica.

2857
02:28:39,131 --> 02:28:41,326
I am asking for a chance,

2858
02:28:41,366 --> 02:28:46,599
for you, for my daughter,
but mostly for me.

2859
02:28:46,638 --> 02:28:50,130
And spend the rest of my life
walking into hotel suites

2860
02:28:50,175 --> 02:28:53,201
finding naked girls
all wrapped up in fur coats?

2861
02:28:53,245 --> 02:28:54,940
Well, no thank you, Jonas.

2862
02:28:54,980 --> 02:28:57,949
I've canceled
all my hotel suites.

2863
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:07,318
I bought a house...

2864
02:29:07,359 --> 02:29:10,419
for you.

2865
02:29:19,404 --> 02:29:21,497
I love you

2866
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:23,405
and I need you.

2867
02:29:31,683 --> 02:29:34,481
You do need me.

2868
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:37,785
You need me.

2869
02:29:53,786 --> 02:29:56,486
Vtg
