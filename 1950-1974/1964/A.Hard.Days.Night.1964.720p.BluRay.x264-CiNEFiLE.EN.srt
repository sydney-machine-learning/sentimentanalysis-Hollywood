- That little old man.

Oh, that one.
That's my grandfather.

49

- Your grandfather?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,650
- That's not your grandfather.
- It is, you know.

51

But I've seen your grandfather.
He lives in your house.

the trip would do him good.

65
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,190
Of course he can talk.
He's a human being, isn't he?

66
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,700
Well, if he's your grandfather,
who knows? Ha ha ha.

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,080

are we?

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,120
- I look after meself.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,410
He's got you worried, then?

70
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,370
Him, he's a villain,
a real mixer...

71
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,630
and he costs you a fortune
in breach of promise cases.

72

- GEORGE: Get on.
- No, straight up.

- You got on all right, then?
- No.

76
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,600

79
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,890
It's Paul's grandfather.

80
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,940
- Oh, aye, but I thought...
- No, that's his other one.

81
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Oh, that's all right, then.

82
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,740
Clean, though, isn't he?

83
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,570
Oh, aye. He's very clean.

84
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,700
- NORM: Mornin', lads.
- Hi, Norm.

85
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,120
Thank God you've all got here.
Look, I've had a marvelous idea.

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Just for once,
let's all try to behave...

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
like ordinary
respectable citizens.

88
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,290
<i>Let's not cause any trouble,
pull any strokes...</i>

89
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,210
or do anything
I'm gonna be sorry for...

90
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,840
especially tomorrow in that
television theater, because...

91
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,590
Are you listening to me,
Lennon?

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,590
You're a swine.
Isn't he, George?

93
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,140
Yeah, a swine.

94
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,020
Thanks. Hey!

95
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,230
ALL:
Who's that little old man?

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,650
- Well, who is he?
- He belongs to Paul.

97
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,900
Oh, well. I'm going down
for a cup of coffee.

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,690
- Anyone coming?
- We'll follow you down.

99
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,150
I want me coffee.

100
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,070
You can come with Shake and me,
if you like.

101
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,660
<i>PAUL: Look after him. I don't
want to find you've lost him.</i>

102
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,330
Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him
to me with promises.

103
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,420
Very clean, isn't he?
Come out, granddad.

104
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,840
Make up your mind, will you?

105
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,360
Hello. Morning.

106
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,200
All right?

107
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,630
Whoa.

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,380
Do you mind if we have it open?

109
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,880
Yes, I do.

110
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, there are four of us,
and we'd like it open...

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,560
not if it's
all the same to you, that is.

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,690
It isn't. I travel
on this train regularly...

113
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,020
twice a week, so I suppose
I have some rights.

114
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,400
So have we.

115
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,410
[Playing rock and roll]

116
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,990
And we'll have that thing
off as well. Thank you.

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,490
- [Turns off]
- But...

118
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,330
An elementary knowledge
of the Railway Acts...

119
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,000
would tell you that I am
perfectly within my rights.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,250
<i>Yeah, but we want to hear it.
There's more of us than you.</i>

121
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,420
We're a community,
a majority vote.

122
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,710
Up the workers
and all that stuff.

123
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,500
Then I suggest
you take that damn thing...

124
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,760
into the corridor, or
some other part of the train...

125
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,630
where you obviously belong.

126
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,090
Give us a kiss.

127
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,510
Look, mister, we paid
for our seats, too, you know.

128
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,390

regularly, twice a week.

129
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,230
Knock it off, Paul.
You can't win with his sort.

130
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,890
After all, it's his train,
isn't it, mister?

131
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,100
And don't take that tone
with me, young man.

132
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,980
I fought the war for your sort.

133
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,480
I bet you're sorry you won.

134
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,280
- I shall call the guard.
- Ah, but what?

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,400
They don't take kindly
to insults, you know.

136
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,950
Let's go have some coffee
and leave the kennel to Lassie.

You stick to that story, son.

143
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,560
I can't help it.
I'm just taller than you are.

Well, I've got me eye on ya.

146
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,190
I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help
being taller than you.

147
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,990
Well, don't rub it in! I've
a good mind to thump you, Shake.

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,610
If you're gonna have a barney,
can I hold your coat?

- I did not. You did.

Well, what happened?

151
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,620
The old fella said that...

152
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,990
could he have these pictures,
and Norm said, "No."

153
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,370
And all I said was,
"Well, why not be big about it?"

154
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,460
- And?
- Your grandfather pointed out...

155
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,210
that Shake was always being
taller than me just to spite me.

156
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,710

could come over and join you.

176

I'd ask you myself,
only I'm shy.

177

I'm sorry, miss. You mustn't
fraternize with me prisoners.

- Prisoners?
- Convict in transit.

- Who?
- Paul's grandfather.

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,210
Oh, I didn't notice.
Where'd he go?

184
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,830
- Down the, uh...
- Oh, down the, uh...

Hey, have you seen
Paul's grandfather?

188
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,970
Of course.
He's concealed about me person.

189
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,850
Now, he must've slipped off
somewhere.

190
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,560
- Have you lost him?
- Now, don't exaggerate.

Honest, you can't trust you
with anything, Norm.

194

If you've lost him,
I'll cripple ya.

195
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,740
- He can't have got far.
- Let's look up the sharp end.

196
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,660
What's the matter
with you, then?

197
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,330
It's his grandfather.

198
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,790
I can tell he doesn't like me.
It's 'cause I'm little.

199
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,250
You've got an inferiority
complex, you have.

200
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,920
Yeah, I know.
That's why I play the drums.

201

No, she'll only
reject me in the end...

You never know.
You may be lucky this time.

206

No, I know

Excuse me. Have you seen that

209

We've broken out...

210
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,340
Have you got a nail file?
These handcuffs are killing me.

211
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,470

I don't want to go!

No, it's probably
a honeymoon couple...

or something.

01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,230
Norm?
There's only three of 'em.

1172
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,570
Oh, we were
looking for Ringo...

1173
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:04,070
but we realized
he must've come back here.

1174
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,740
Well, do you realize
that we are on the air live...

He must be here somewhere.

1179
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,370
Aye, well, we'll look
in the dressing room.

1180
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,580
- Shake.
- Yes, the dressing room.

1181
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,750
Hey, where's my grandfather?

1182
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,750
Don't worry about him, Paul.
He can look after himself.

1183
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,920
I suppose so.

1184
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,090

All right, break it up.
Break it up. Move on.

1190
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,900
Hey, what's going on here?
Right, move over. Move over.

1191
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,100
- Come on, move along.
- Here you are.

1192
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,230
Why don't you go back home?
You're making a disturbance.

1193
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,570
Will you just move along now?

1194
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,900

Come on! Ooh, yeah.</i>

1202
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,530
I'm Ringo Starr.

1203
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,490
I've got a show to do.
I'm on in a few minutes.

1204
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:34,320
You've got to let me go.
I'm Ringo.

1205
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,870
Yeah, that's what
they all say these days.

1206

Look, I don't care who you are.

1207
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,750
You can save that
for the stipendiary.

1208
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:41,540
- Here you are, sarge.
- All right. What is he?

1209
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,960
Yeah, I got a little list here.

1210

<i>OFFICER:
You name it, he's done it.</i>

Oh, a little savage, is he?

1215
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,640
Yeah, a proper

1216
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,060
- I demand to see my solicitor.
- What's his name?

1217
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,770
Well, if you're gonna
get technical about it.

1218

GRANDFATHER: Dragging me

Hello, it's gonna be
one of those nights, is it?

1220

Sit Charlie Peace down

1221

Well, you got me here,
so do your worst...

1222
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,570
but, by God,
I'll take one of you with me.

1223
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:13,410
- Ow!
- I know your game!

1224
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:17,990
Get me into that tiled room and
then out come the rubber hoses.

1225
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,250
Oh, there's a fire, is there?

1226
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,170
You ugly great brute.
You have sadism...

stamped all over
your bloated British kisser.

1228
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,670
- Eh?
- I'll go on hunger strike.

1229
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,590
<i>I know your caper.</i>

1230
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:31,590
The kidney punch
and the rabbit clout.

1231
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:34,760
The third degree and
the size twelve boot ankle tap.

1232
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,180
What's he on about?

1233
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,180
<i>GRANDFATHER: I'm a soldier

will you?

1240
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,780
<i>OFFICER: Come on, dad.

Ringo, me old scout!

1242
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,410
So they grabbed your leg
for the iron, too, have they?

1243
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,030
I'm not exactly
a voluntary patient.

1244
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,870
Shh, shh.
Have they roughed you up yet?

1245
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,040
What?

1246
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,210
<i>Oh, they're a desperate crew
of drippings...</i>

1247
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,460
and they've fists
like matured hams...

1248
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,540
for pounding poor
defenseless lads like you.

1249
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,800
Right, that's it, then.

1250
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,550
<i>GRANDFATHER:
One of us has got to escape.</i>

1251
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,710
<i>I'll get the boys.</i>

1252
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,720
- Hold on. I'll be back for you.
- For me?

1253
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,970
If they get you on the floor,
watch out for your brisket.

1254
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,550
They seem all right to me.

1255
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,560
Ah, sure, that's what
they want you to think.

1256
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,390
All coppers are villains.

1257

<i>SERGEANT: Would you two

1258

See? Sly villains.

1259
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,480
Um, no, thank you,
Mr. Sergeant, sir.

1260
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,400
No, not for me. Please don't.

1261
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,240
So you just
brought the old chap...

1262
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,740
out of the crowd
for his own good, eh?

1263
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,240
Well, he was getting
a bit nasty, you see...

1264
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,570
so we had to bring him in.

1265
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:40,240
Well, he can't stop here.

1266
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,910
This is the stuff
he's been hawking around, eh?

1267
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:44,410
- Yes, sergeant... photographs.
- Photographs.

1268
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,920
Well, son, it's now or never.

1269
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,420
All right, you paid assassins!
Johnny McCartney...

1270
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,250
will give you a run
for your thruppence halfpenny.

1271
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,670
Hey, you forgot
your photographs.

1272
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,270
Only half an hour,
and you're on.

1273
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,600
- Can I say something?
- Yes. Anything.

1274
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,100
It seems highly unlikely
we'll be on.

1275
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,860
I mean, the law of averages
are against it.

1276
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:14,280
I think if you could
get the juggler on...

1277
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,400
with a couple more clubs...

1278
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,570
that would fill in
a bit of time.

1279
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,540
Come on, let's go!

1280
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,800

off of you lot.

1282
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,640
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself. Go home.

1283
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,800
I must see Pauly.

1284
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,600
Go home, then,
and see him on the telly.

1285
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,060
- Can you fix him for me?
- Yeah.

1286
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,440
Sixpence.

1287
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,440
- Each.
- In advance.

[Audience screaming]

1516
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:41,020
Now, I've got the stuff.
Come here, lads.

1517
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,230
- Aren't we going...
- No, we're not.

1518
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,940
The office has been on
the phone and think it's best...

1519
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,730
if we push on to Wolverhampton
straight away.

1520
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,860
- Tonight? We'll never make it.
- You've got a midnight matinee.

1521
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,030
Aye, Norm!

1522
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,570
There's only one thing I've got
to say to you, John Lennon.

1523
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,780
- What?
- You're a swine.

1524
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,530

a hard day's night #</i>

1529
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,510
Come on,
you're hanging up the parade!

1530
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,050
Get rid of those things!

1531
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,970

everything #</i>

1535
