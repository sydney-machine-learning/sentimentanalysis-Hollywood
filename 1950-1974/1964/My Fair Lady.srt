1
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,250
Freddy, go and find a cab.

2
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,250
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

3
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,150
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

4
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,350
All right, I'll get one.

5
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,550
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

6
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,250
I'm so sorry.

7
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,650
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

8
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,250
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

9
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,450
He's your son, is he?

10
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,850
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

11
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,850
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

12
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,850
Go about your business, my girl.

13
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,050
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

14
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,650
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

15
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,650
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

16
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,350
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

17
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,650
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

18
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,550
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

19
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,050
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

20
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,750
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

21
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,350
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

22
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,650
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

23
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,850
Thank you, sir.

24
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,450
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

25
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,450
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

26
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,050
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

27
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,550
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

28
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,350
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

29
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,750
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

30
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,250
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

31
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,950
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

32
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,850
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

33
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,650
Who's doing all that shouting?

34
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,650
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

35
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,750
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

36
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,550
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

37
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,450
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

38
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,450
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

39
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,450
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

40
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,850
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

41
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,150
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

42
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,450
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

43
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,450
I can.

44
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,350
"l say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl."

45
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,850
Oh, it's cause I called him "Capt'n."

46
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,250
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

47
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,750
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

48
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,950
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

49
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,950
...until I ask you.

50
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,450
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

51
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,550
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

52
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,650
How are all your people down at Selsey?

53
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,250
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

54
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,450
Never mind, they do.

55
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,250
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

56
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,750
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

57
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,050
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

58
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,950
Live where you like but stop that noise!

59
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,550
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

60
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,950
I'm a good girl, I am.

61
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,550
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

62
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,350
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

63
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,750
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

64
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,750
Madam, it's stopped raining.

65
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,850
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court..

66
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,150
Isn't that where you live?

67
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,350
What impertinence!

68
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,650
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

69
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,950
Cheltenham, Harrow...

70
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,550
...Cambridge and...

71
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,050
...India?

72
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,550
Quite right.

73
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,950
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

74
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,850
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

75
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,150
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

76
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,550
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

77
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,350
How do you do it, may I ask?

78
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,650
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,850
Anyone can spot an lrishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

80
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,050
...but I can place a man within six miles.

81
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,950
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

82
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,850
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

83
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,850
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

84
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,650
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

85
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,350
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

86
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,050
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

87
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,150
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

88
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,050
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

89
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,650
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

90
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,550
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

91
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,350
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

92
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,450
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

93
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,450
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

94
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,250
"Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters"

95
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,650
"Condemned by every syllable she utters"

96
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,750
"By right she should be taken out and hung"

97
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,550
"For the cold-blooded murder
of the English tongue"

98
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,850
Heavens, what a sound!

99
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,550
"This is what the British population"

100
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,350
"Calls an elementary education"

101
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,150
Come, sir, I think you've picked
a poor example.

102
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,050
Did l?

103
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,850
"Hear them down in Soho Square
Dropping H's everywhere"

104
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,250
"Speaking English any way they like"

105
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,250
"Hey, you, sir, did you go to school?"

106
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,950
"What ya tike me for, a fool?"

107
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,950
"No one taught him 'take' instead of 'tike"

108
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,450
"Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse
Hear a Cornishman converse"

109
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,950
"l'd rather hear a choir singing flat"

110
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,450
"Chickens cackling in a barn
Just like this one"

111
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,550
"Garn!"

112
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,150
"l ask you, sir, what sort of word is that?"

113
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,550
"lt's 'aoow' and 'garn'
that keep her in her place"

114
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,550
"Not her wretched clothes and dirty face"

115
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,150
"Why can't the English
teach their children how to speak?"

116
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,850
"This verbal class distinction
by now should be antique"

117
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,550
"If you spoke as she does, sir,
instead of the way you do"

118
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,250
"Why, you might be selling flowers, too"

119
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,350
I beg your pardon.

120
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,150
"An Englishman's way of speaking
absolutely classifies him"

121
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,950
"The moment he talks he makes
some other Englishman despise him"

122
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,150
"One common language
I'm afraid we'll never get"

123
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,150
"Oh, why can't the English learn to...

124
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,750
...set a good example to people
whose English is painful to your ears"

125
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,350
"The Scotch and the Irish
leave you close to tears"

126
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,050
"There even are places
where English completely disappears"

127
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,850
"Why, in America
they haven't used it for years!"

128
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,150
"Why can't the English
teach their children how to speak?"

129
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,750
"Norwegians learn Norwegian,
the Greeks are taught their Greek"

130
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,750
"In France every Frenchman
knows his language from 'A' to 'Z'"

131
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,850
"The French don't care
what they do actually"

132
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,650
"As long as they pronounce it properly"

133
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,250
"Arabians learn Arabian
with the speed of summer lightning"

134
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,050
"The Hebrews learn it backwards
which is absolutely frightening"

135
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,450
"Use proper English,
you're regarded as a freak"

136
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,150
"Oh, why can't the English"

137
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,150
"Why can't the English learn to speak?"

138
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,950
Thank you.

139
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,250
See this creature
with her curbstone English...

140
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,150
...that'll keep her in the gutter
till the end of her days?

141
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,450
In six months I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

142
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,550
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

143
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,450
...which requires better English.

144
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,550
What's that you say?

145
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,050
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf!

146
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,050
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns!

147
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,850
You incarnate insult
to the English language!

148
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,350
I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba.

149
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,850
You don't believe that, Capt'n?

150
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,950
Anything's possible.
I, myself, am a student of Indian dialects.

151
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,950
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

152
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,450
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?

153
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,550
I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.

154
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,250
I came from India to meet you!

155
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,650
I was going to India to meet you!

156
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,750
-Where are you staying?
-At the Carleton.

157
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,650
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.

158
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,550
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

159
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,650
Indian dialects have always fascinated me.

160
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,550
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.

161
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,550
Liar!

162
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,050
You said you could change half a crown.

163
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,950
You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought!

164
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,950
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket
for a sixpence!

165
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,650
A reminder.

166
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,750
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?

167
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,850
Indian dialects?

168
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,950
No fewer than 147 distinct languages
are recorded as vernacular in India.

169
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,250
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

170
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,550
Would you be lookin'
for a good butler, Eliza?

171
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,450
Well, you won't do.

172
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,750
"lt's rather dull in town
I think I'll take me to Paris"

173
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,050
"The missus wants to open up
the castle in Capri"

174
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,450
"Me doctor recommends
a quiet summer by the sea"

175
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,550
"Wouldn't it be loverly?"

176
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,950
Where are ya bound for this year, Eliza?
Biarritz?

177
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,150
"All I want is a room somewhere"

178
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,750
"Far away from the cold night air"

179
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,050
"With one enormous chair"

180
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,650
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

181
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,750
"Lots of chocolate for me to eat"

182
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,350
"Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat"

183
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,450
"Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet"

184
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,250
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

185
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,550
"Oh, so loverly sittin'"

186
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,750
"Absobloominlutely still"

187
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:05,650
"l would never budge till Spring"

188
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,350
"Crept over the winder sill"

189
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,450
"Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee"

190
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,250
"Warm and tender as he can be"

191
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,350
"Who takes good care of me"

192
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:26,750
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

193
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:37,050
"Loverly"

194
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,950
"All I want is a room somewhere"

195
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,450
"Far away from the cold night air"

196
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,450
"With one enormous chair"

197
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,950
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

198
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,150
"Lots of chocolate for me to eat"

199
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,650
"Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat"

200
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,750
"Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet"

201
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,350
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

202
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,350
"Oh, so loverly sittin'"

203
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,350

"Crept over the winder sill"

206
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,650
"Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee"

207
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,250
"Warm and tender as he can be"

208
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,250
"Who takes good care of me"

209
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,550
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

210
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,950
"Loverly"

211
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,250
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

212
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,450
"Loverly"

213
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:58,250
"Wouldn't it be loverly?"

214
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,950
Come on, Alfie, let's go 'ome now.
This place is givin' me the willies.

215
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,250
Home? What do you want to go 'ome for?

216
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,050
It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

217
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,250
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

218
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,250
That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

219
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,050
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

220
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,250
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

221
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,450
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

222
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,350
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

223
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,750
Life!

224
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,350
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

225
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,050
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

226
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,350
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

227
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,850
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

228
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,150
I give 'er all that.

229
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,150
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

230
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,550
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

231
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,750
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

232
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,050
You got a good 'eart.
But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...

233
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,850
...you better have a good story.

234
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,350
Leave that to me, my boy.

235
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,150
-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.

236
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,800
Not a brass farthin'.

237
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,650
There she is.

238
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,550
Why, Liza, what a surprise.

239
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,950
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me

240
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,950
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.

241
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,550
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

242
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,850
Eliza, what a surprise.

243
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,550
Not a brass farthin'.

244
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,950
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

245
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,350
I ain't gonna take me 'ard-earned wages...

246
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,050
...and let you pass 'em on
to a bloody pubkeeper.

247
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,650
You wouldn't send me 'ome
to your stepmother...

248
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,750
...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

249
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,950
Stepmother, indeed!

250
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,150
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

251
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,350
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

252
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,650
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

253
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,950
Slip your ol' dad just 'alf a crown
to go 'ome on.

254
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,450
Well, I had a bit o' luck meself last night.

255
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,250
But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

256
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,050
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

257
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,650
"Beer, beer, glorious beer

258
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,050
"Fill yourself right up"

259
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,150
See this creature
with her curbstone English...

260
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,750
...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

261
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,950
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

262
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,950
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

263
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,950
...which requires better English.

264
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,650
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns!

265
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,050
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

266
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,950
...which requires better English.

267
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,950
How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

268
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,750
I believe I counted 24.

269
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,450
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

270
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,150
Listen to them one at a time.

271
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,950
Must l? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

272
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,450
Your name, please?

273
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,850
Your name, miss?

274
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,950
My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

275
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,550
One moment, please.

276
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,950
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

277
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,450
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

278
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,150
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

279
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,850
Could you tell me what it's about?

280
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,450
It's business of a personal nature.

281
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,950
One moment, please.

282
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,550
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

283
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,150
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

284
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,550
A young woman?

285
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,750
What does she want?

286
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,550
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

287
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,650
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

288
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,750
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

289
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,650
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

290
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,450
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

291
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,950
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

292
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,950
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

293
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,250
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph..."

294
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:36,450
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

295
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,750
This is the young woman, sir.

296
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,150
Good mornin', my good man.

297
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,150
Might I 'ave a word with you?

298
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,750
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

299
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,050
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

300
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,050
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

301
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,750
Be off with you. I don't want you.

302
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,150
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

303
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,050
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

304
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,150
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

305
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,350
...what you came in?

306
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,150
Oh, we are proud.

307
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,450
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so

308
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,650
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

309
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,450
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

310
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,050
Good enough for what?

311
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,850
Good enough for you.

312
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,850
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

313
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,450
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

314
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,250
Well!

315
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,650
And what do you expect me to say?

316
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,250
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

317
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,650
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

318
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,750
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

319
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,250
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

320
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,450
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

321
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,050
What do you want, my girl?

322
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,350
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

323
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,250
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

324
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,050
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

325
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,450
He said 'e could teach me.

326
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,650
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

327
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,550
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

328
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,250
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

329
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,150
How much?

330
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,050
Now you're talkin'.

331
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,750
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

332
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,950
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

333
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,750
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

334
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,050
Sit down.

335
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,250
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

336
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,950
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

337
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,450
What's your name?

338
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,050
Eliza Doolittle.

339
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

340
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,750
I don't mind if I do.

341
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,850
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

342
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,450
Oh, I know what's right.

343
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,450
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

344
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,450
...from a real French gentleman.

345
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,850
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

346
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,750
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French

347
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,950
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

348
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,550
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

349
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,050
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

350
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,550
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

351
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,750
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

352
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,250
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

353
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,550
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds

354
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,950
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

355
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,750
But I ain't got 60 pounds

356
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,550
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

357
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,050
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

358
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,950
Sit down!

359
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,850
Anybody'd think you was my father!

360
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:55,250
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

361
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,650
What's this for?

362
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,650
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

363
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,550
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

364
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,250
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop

365
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,150
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

366
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,950
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

367
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,150
Higgins, I'm interested.

368
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,450
What about your boast...

369
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,450
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

370
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,350
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

371
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,750
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

372
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,550
I'll even pay for the lessons

373
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,650
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

374
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,350
It's almost irresistible.

375
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,650
She's so deliciously low.

376
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,350
So horribly dirty.

377
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,950
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

378
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,350
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

379
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,950
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

380
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,450
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

381
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,550
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

382
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,750
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

383
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,350
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

384
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,950
I'm a good girl, I am.

385
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,450
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

386
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,850
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

387
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,250
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

388
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,750
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

389
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,650
I'll call the police, I will.

390
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,350
I've got no place to put her.

391
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,350
Well, put her in the dustbin.

392
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,450
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

393
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,050
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

394
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,350
You can't walk over everybody like this.

395
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,150
I?

396
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,050
Walk over everybody?

397
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,250
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

398
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,550
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

399
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,550
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

400
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,750
...or yours.

401
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,050
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

402
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,750
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

403
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,050
Why not?

404
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,950
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

405
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,950
What about her parents?
She may be married.

406
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,550
Garn!

407
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,450
There. As the girl
very properly says, "garn! "

408
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,850
Who'd marry me?

409
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,050
By George, Eliza...

410
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,650
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

411
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:31,050
...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

412
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,350
I'm goin'.

413
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,950
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

414
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,250
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes

415
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,550
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.

416
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,150
Go home to your parents, girl.

417
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,050
I ain't got no parents.

418
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,050
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

419
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,550
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

420
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,150
What's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?

421
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,950
Do be sensible, sir.

422
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,550
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

423
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,250
She'll drink if you give her money.

424
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,050
You are a brute! It's a lie!

425
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,650
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

426
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,850
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that

427
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,150
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

428
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,450
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

429
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,650
Well, have you, Eliza?

430
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,050
I got me feelings same as anyone else.

431
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,450
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

432
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,950
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

433
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,850
You must look ahead a little, sir.

434
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,150
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

435
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,650
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

436
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,250
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

437
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,650
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

438
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,450
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

439
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,250
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

440
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,450
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

441
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,650
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

442
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,450
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

443
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,050
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

444
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,550
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

445
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,850
Pledge of good faith.

446
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,250
I'll take one half.

447
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,750
And you take the other.

448
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,950
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

449
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,050
You'll live on them, eh?

450
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,650
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

451
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,550
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

452
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,250
...and gold and diamonds.

453
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,450
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

454
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,750
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

455
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,850
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

456
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:45,250
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

457
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,750
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

458
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,950
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

459
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,750
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

460
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,250
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

461
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,750
But if you are naughty and idle...

462
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,650
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

463
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:14,050
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

464
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,150
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

465
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,850
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

466
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,950
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

467
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,250
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

468
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,250
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

469
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,850
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

470
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,350
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

471
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,350
If you refuse this offer...

472
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,850
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

473
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:54,150
...and the angels will weep for you!

474
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,950
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

475
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,050
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

476
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,650
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

477
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,650
Come with me.

478
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,450
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

479
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,450
You're a great bully, you are!

480
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,850
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me

481
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,350
Don't answer back, girl.

482
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,650
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

483
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,950
In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

484
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,850
...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

485
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,250
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

486
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,050
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

487
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,350
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

488
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,350
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

489
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,650
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

490
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,650
It's too good for the likes o' me.

491
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,950
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

492
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,850
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

493
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,150
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

494
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,850
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

495
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,150
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

496
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,250
Not me!

497
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,450
I shall catch me death.

498
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,150
Come along now.

499
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,450
Come along.

500
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,350
Take your clothes off.

501
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,550
Here, come on. Help me take these--

502
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,250
Take your hands off me!

503
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,150
I'm a good girl, I am!

504
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,450
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

505
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,550
Get your hands off me!

506
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,350
I'm a good girl, I am!

507
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,350
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

508
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,350
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.

509
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,350
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

510
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,150
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

511
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,250
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

512
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,650
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

513
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,050
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

514
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,250
Yes, very frequently.

515
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,650
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

516
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,050
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

517
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,550
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

518
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,750
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

519
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,550
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

520
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,050
Well, after all, Pickering....

521
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,050
"l'm an ordinary man"

522
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,450
"Who desires nothing more"

523
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,650
"Than just an ordinary chance"

524
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,950
"To live exactly as he likes"

525
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,350
"And do precisely what he wants"

526
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,550
"An average man, am I"

527
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,950
"Of no eccentric whim"

528
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,750
"Who likes to live his life"

529
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,150
"Free of strife"

530
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,750
"Doing whatever he thinks is best for him"

531
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,250
"Oh, just an ordinary man"

532
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,150
"But let a woman in your life"

533
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,150
"And your serenity is through"

534
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,950
"She'll redecorate your home
From the cellar to the dome"

535
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,250
"Then go on to the enthralling fun
of overhauling you!"

536
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,850
"Let a woman in your life"

537
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,750
"And you are up against a wall"

538
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,650
"Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind"

539
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,450
"So rather than do either
You do something else that neither"

540
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,150
"Likes at all!"

541
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,050
"You want to talk of Keats or Milton"

542
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,650
"She only wants to talk of love"

543
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,350
"You go to see a play or ballet"

544
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,150
"And spend it searching for her glove"

545
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,550
"Let a woman in your life"

546
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,050
"And you invite eternal strife"

547
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,850
"Let them buy their wedding bands"

548
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,050
"For those anxious little hands"

549
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,150
"l'd be equally as willing
For a dentist to be drilling"

550
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,950
"Than to ever let a woman in my life!"

551
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,650
"l'm a very gentle man"

552
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,850
"Even-tempered and good-natured
Whom you never hear complain"

553
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,450
"Who has the milk of human kindness
By the quart in every vein"

554
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,750
"A patient man am I
Down to my fingertips"

555
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,050
"The sort who never could
Ever would"

556
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:26,750
"Let an insulting remark escape his lips"

557
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,750
"A very gentle man"

558
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,050
"But let a woman in your life"

559
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,050
"And patience hasn't got a chance"

560
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,950
"She will beg you for advice
Your reply will be concise"

561
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,250
"And she'll listen very nicely"

562
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,450
"Then go out and do precisely
What she wants!"

563
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,250
"You were a man of grace and polish"

564
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,950
"Who never spoke above a hush"

565
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,750
"Now all at once you're using language"

566
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,550
"That would make a sailor blush"

567
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,050
"Let a woman in your life"

568
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,550
"And you're plunging in a knife!"

569
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,350
"Let the others of my sex"

570
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,450
"Tie the knot around their necks"

571
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,850
"l'd prefer a new edition
Of the Spanish Inquisition"

572
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:17,650
"Than to ever let a woman in my life"

573
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,450
"l'm a quiet-living man"

574
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,550
"Who prefers to spend the evenings"

575
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,750
"In the silence of his room"

576
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,350
"Who likes an atmosphere as restful"

577
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,350
"As an undiscovered tomb"

578
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,650
"A pensive man am I
Of philosophic joys"

579
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,050
"Who likes to meditate, contemplate"

580
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:43,050
"Free from humanity's mad, inhuman noise"

581
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,450
"A quiet-living man"

582
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,850
"But let a woman in your life"

583
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,650
"And your sabbatical is through"

584
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,350
"In a line that never ends
Come an army of her friends"

585
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,650
"Come to jabber and to chatter
And to tell her"

586
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,750
"What the matter is with you!"

587
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,450
"She'll have a booming, boisterous family"

588
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,250
"Who will descend on you en masse"

589
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,950
"She'll have a large, Wagnerian mother"

590
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,550
"With a voice that shatters glass!"

591
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,150
"Let a woman in your life"

592
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,850
"l shall never let a woman...

593
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,250
...in my life!"

594
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,650
Get out of 'ere. Jamie, you get out, too!

595
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:54,950
Come on, Doolittle. And remember,
drinks is to be paid for or not drunk.

596
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,250
Thanks for your 'ospitality, George.

597
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,550
Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.

598
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,050
Well, Alfie, there's nothin' else to do.
I guess it's back to work.

599
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:07,150
Work! Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

600
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,650
Look at all these poor blighters down here.

601
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,450
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise

602
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,450
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.

603
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,150
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.

604
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,150
How do you think you'll do that?

605
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,550
How? Same as always.

606
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,050
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

607
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,950
"The Lord above gave man an arm of iron"

608
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,850
"So he could do his job and never shirk"

609
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:40,150
"The Lord above gave man
an arm of iron, but"

610
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,750
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck"

611
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,850
"Someone else'll do the blinkin' work!"

612
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,150
"With a little bit"

613
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,350
"With a little bit o' luck
You'll never work"

614
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,150
"The Lord above made liquor
for temptation"

615
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,850
"To see if man could turn away from sin"

616
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:07,250
"The Lord above made liquor
for temptation, but"

617
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,850
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck"

618
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,750
"When temptation comes
you'll give right in."

619
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:18,150
"With a little bit"

620
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,250
"With a little bit o' luck
You'll give right in."

621
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,050
"Oh, you can walk the straight and narrow"

622
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,950
"But with a little bit o' luck
you'll run amuck!"

623
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,650
"The gentle sex was made
for man to marry"

624
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,550
"To share his nest
and see his food is cooked"

625
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,850
"The gentle sex was made
for man to marry, but"

626
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,350
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck"

627
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,450
"You can have it all and not get hooked."

628
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,750
"With a little bit"

629
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,950
"With a little bit of luck
you won't get hooked."

630
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,600
"With a little bit"

631
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,750
"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck!"

632
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,550
"They're always throwing goodness at you"

633
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,550
"But with a little bit o' luck a man can duck"

634
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,250
"The Lord above made man
to 'elp his neighbor"

635
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,050
"No matter where on land, or sea, or foam"

636
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,450
"The Lord above made man
to 'elp his neighbor, but"

637
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,050
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck"

638
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:32,950
"When he comes around
you won't be home"

639
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
"With a little bit"

640
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,950
"With a little bit of luck,
you won't be home."

641
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,100
"With a little bit"

642
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,850
"With a little bit of bloomin' luck!"

643
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,150
You'd make a good suffragette, Alfie.

644
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,450
Why, there's the lucky man now.

645
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,750
The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.

646
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,750
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

647
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,550
Her former residence!

648
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,050
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

649
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,150
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

650
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,450
What are you talkin' about?

651
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,850
Your daughter, Eliza.

652
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,450
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

653
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,850
What about Eliza?

654
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,650
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.

655
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,350
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

656
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,550
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

657
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,850
An' ain't been home for three days.

658
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:36,850
Go on.

659
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,050
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.

660
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,550
She wants her things sent over...

661
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,850
...to 27A Wimpole Street...

662
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,350
...care of Professor Higgins.

663
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,850
An' what things does she want?

664
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:56,750
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

665
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,050
But she says:

666
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,150
"Never mind about sending any clothes."

667
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,050
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

668
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,550
We're in for a booze-up.

669
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,150
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

670
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,150
"A man was made
to 'elp support his children"

671
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,950
"Which is the right and proper thing to do"

672
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,350
"A man was made
to 'elp support his children, but"

673
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,950
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck"

674
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,950
"They'll go out and start supportin' you"

675
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,250
"With a little bit"

676
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:43,250
"With a little bit o' luck
They'll work for you"

677
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,700
"With a little bit"

678
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,450
"With a little bit of bloomin' luck!"

679
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,450
"lt's a crime for a man to go philanderin'"

680
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,250
"And fill his wife's poor 'eart
with grief and doubt"

681
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:09,450
"lt's a crime for a man
to go philanderin', but"

682
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,150
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck"

683
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,950
"You can see the bloodhounds
don't find out!"

684
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,700
"With a little bit"

685
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,150
"With a little bit of luck
she won't find out!"

686
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,600
"With a little bit"

687
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,850
"With a little bit of bloomin' luck!"

688
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,900
"With a little bit of bloomin' luck!"

689
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,350
The mail, sir.

690
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,950
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

691
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,950
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

692
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,250
Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

693
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,250
...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

694
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,850
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

695
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,550
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

696
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,150
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

697
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,450
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

698
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,650
Throw it away.

699
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,150
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

700
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,950
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

701
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,450
If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

702
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,550
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

703
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,950
I say!

704
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,050
Well, send the blackguard up.

705
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,150
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

706
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,850
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

707
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,350
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

708
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:33,650
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

709
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,350
Doolittle, sir.

710
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,150
-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

711
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,750
Where?

712
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,050
Good morning, Governor.

713
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:54,950
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

714
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,350
Brought up in Houndslow.

715
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,250
Mother Welsh, I should think.

716
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,950
What is it you want, Doolittle?

717
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,550
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

718
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,150
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

719
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,850
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

720
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,650
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

721
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,250
What?

722
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,350
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

723
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,250
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

724
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,450
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

725
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,150
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

726
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:34,450
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

727
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,550
You sent her here on purpose!

728
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,950
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

729
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,250
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

730
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,750
...a plot to extort money by threats.

731
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,750
I shall telephone the police.

732
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,250
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

733
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,950
Domnu say '.
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

734
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,950
Well, what else did you come for?

735
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,350
What would a bloke come for?

736
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,150
Be 'uman, Governor.

737
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,450
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

738
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,250
So help me, Governor, I never did.

739
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,750
How did you know she was here?

740
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,750
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

741
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,850
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

742
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:23,450
I'm waiting to tell ya!

743
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,550
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric..

744
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,750
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

745
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:34,850
"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you."

746
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,250
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

747
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,950
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

748
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,550
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

749
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,850
She said she didn't want no clothes.

750
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,950
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

751
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:56,050
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

752
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,950
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

753
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,750
Mrs. Pearce!

754
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,350
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

755
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,750
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

756
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:12,850
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

757
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,050
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

758
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,550
I think so indeed, sir!

759
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,650
Here, Governor.
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

760
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:30,650
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

761
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,950
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

762
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,450
All I ask is my rights as a father.

763
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:40,450
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

764
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,750
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

765
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,050
So...

766
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,550
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

767
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,250
I think you should know, Doolittle...

768
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,850
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

769
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:59,150
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

770
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,050
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

771
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,650
Have you no morals, man?

772
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:11,050
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

773
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,350
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

774
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,650
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too? Why not?

775
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,650
Look at it my way. What am l?

776
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:29,750
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

777
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,950
Think what that means to a man.

778
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:36,250
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

779
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:40,250
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

780
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,050
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it."

781
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:47,150
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

782
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:51,750
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

783
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,650
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

784
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,450
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

785
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,050
...a lot more.

786
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,150
I'm playin' straight with you.

787
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,350
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

788
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,450
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth

789
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:15,250
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

790
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,850
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up..

791
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,250
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

792
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:28,750
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

793
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,550
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

794
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,950
And I leave it to you.

795
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,650
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

796
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:45,550
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales

797
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,350
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

798
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,450
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

799
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,050
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

800
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:57,250
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

801
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,250
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

802
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,950
You couldn't spend it better.

803
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,050
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

804
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,350
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

805
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,150
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

806
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:13,150
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

807
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:17,250
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

808
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,650
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

809
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,850
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

810
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,350
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

811
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,050
Who told you that, Governor?

812
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:32,750
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

813
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,450
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

814
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,350
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

815
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,850
Are you sure you won't have ten?

816
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,950
No. No, perhaps another time.

817
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,450
I beg your pardon, miss.

818
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,250
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

819
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,250
Blimey, it's Eliza.

820
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,850
I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

821
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,950
She does me credit, don't she?

822
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,650
What are you doin' here?

823
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:05,650
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

824
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,050
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

825
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,650
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

826
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:16,150
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

827
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:23,550
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water

828
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,650
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

829
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,050
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

830
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:33,150
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

831
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,150
What did he come for?

832
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,350
Say your vowels.

833
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,450
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

834
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,850
If you know them, say them.

835
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:46,550
-Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.
-A, E, I, O, U.

836
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,650
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

837
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,550
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

838
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,750
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

839
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,050
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

840
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,650
Drilling is what she needs.

841
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,150
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

842
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:06,350
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

843
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,150
Of course.

844
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,650
Say "A".

845
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,650
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

846
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:23,650
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

847
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:29,950
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

848
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:44,050
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait"

849
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:48,550
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late"

850
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:53,150
"You'll be broke and I'll have money
Will I help you? Don't be funny!"

851
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:57,650
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait"

852
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:02,050
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Till you're sick"

853
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:06,550
"And you screams
To fetch a doctor double-quick"

854
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,350
"l'll be off a second later
And go straight to the theater"

855
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:16,050
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!"

856
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:25,650
"Just you wait
Until we're swimmin' in the sea"

857
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:33,150
"And you get the cramp
a little ways from me"

858
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:39,150
"When you yell you're gonna drown
I'll get dressed and go to town"

859
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:47,050
"Just you wait!"

860
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,550
"One day I'll be famous
I'll be proper and prim"

861
01:01:54,850 --> 01:02:00,450
"Go to St. James so often
I will call it St. Jim"

862
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:06,050
"One evening the king will say"
"Oh, Liza, old thing"

863
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:12,350
"l want all of England your praises to sing"

864
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:16,850
"Next week on the 20th of May"

865
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:22,350
"l proclaim Liza Doolittle Day"

866
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:27,350
"All the people will celebrate
the glory of you"

867
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:33,250
"And whatever you wish and want
I gladly will do"

868
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:39,150
"Thanks a lot, King,' says I
in a manner well-bred"

869
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:45,150
"But all I want is 'Enry 'lggins' 'ead'"

870
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:46,250
"Done!"

871
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:50,250
"Says the king with a stroke"

872
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:54,450
"Guard, run and bring in the bloke'"

873
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:59,450
"Then they'll march you, 'Enry 'lggins,
to the wall"

874
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,250
"And the king will tell me"

875
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,250
"Liza, sound the call"

876
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,250
"As they raise their rifles higher"

877
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:12,750
"l'll shout: 'Ready, aim, fire!"

878
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:18,350
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins, down you go"

879
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,950
"Just you wait!"

880
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:09,250
-All right, Eliza, say it again.
-"The rine in Spine
stais minely in the pline."

881
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,450
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain."

882
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,650
Didn't I saiy that?

883
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,650
No, Eliza, you didn't "saiy" that.
You didn't even "say" that.

884
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:23,050
Every night before you go to bed,
where you used to say your prayers...

885
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,350
...l want you to say:

886
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,750
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain."

887
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,450
Fifty times.

888
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:34,450
You'll get much further with the Lord
if you learn not to offend His ears.

889
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:37,150
Now for your "H's."

890
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,150
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

891
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,450
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

892
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,550
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

893
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,550
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

894
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,850
Now, you see that flame?

895
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,450
Every time you pronounce the letter "H"
correctly the flame will waver...

896
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,850
...and every time you drop your "H"
the flame will remain stationary.

897
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,650
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

898
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,550
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

899
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:07,950
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

900
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,350
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

901
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:15,550
"...hurricanes hardly ever happen."

902
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:21,650
Now you repeat that after me.
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen."

903
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:27,150
"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire
'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen."

904
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:28,950
Oh, no, no!

905
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,850
Have you no ear at all?

906
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,750
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.

907
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:38,150
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

908
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:49,150
Go on, go on..

909
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:53,550
Does the same thing hold true in India?

910
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,750
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

911
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:02,550
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like "hever" instead of "ever"?

912
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,350
The girl, Higgins!

913
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,350
Go on. Go on.

914
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:36,350
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins"

915
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:42,550
"Night and day he slaves away"

916
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,600
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins"

917
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,450
"All day long on his feet"

918
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:55,950
"Up and down until he's numb"

919
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:00,350
"Doesn't rest, doesn't eat"

920
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:04,950
"Doesn't touch a crumb"

921
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:08,750
Again, Eliza.

922
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,850
"How kind of you to let me come."

923
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:18,850
No. "Kind of you."
Kind of you.

924
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,800
"How kind of you to let me come."

925
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,650
No. "Kind of you."

926
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,350
"Kind of you". lt's like ''cup of tea.''

927
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,300
Cup of tea. Say, "cup of tea."

928
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,050
Cuppatea.

929
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,800
No. "A cup of tea."

930
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:38,550
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

931
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:44,950
First rate. And those strawberry tarts
are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

932
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,250
Try it again.

933
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:53,950
-Did you try the--
-Pickering!

934
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,150
Again, Eliza.

935
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,450
Cuppatea.

936
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,150
Oh, no.

937
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,750
Can't you hear the difference?

938
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:05,050
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

939
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:08,950
And then say "cup."
Then say "of."

940
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:14,850
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of."

941
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,550
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

942
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,850
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

943
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:24,850
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.

944
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:31,450
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

945
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:46,950
"Poor Professor Higgins"

946
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:54,050
"On he plods against all odds"

947
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,800
"Poor Professor Higgins"

948
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:02,850
"Nine p.m., ten p.m."

949
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,250
"On through midnight every night"

950
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:13,850
"One a.m., two a.m., three..."

951
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,250
Four.

952
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,250
Five.

953
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:22,150
Six marbles.

954
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,550
I want you to read this
and I want you to enunciate...

955
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:29,050
...every word just as if the marbles
were not in your mouth.

956
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:31,850
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

957
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,650
"...were thickly crusted, one and all."

958
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:38,250
Each word, clear as a bell.
"With blackest moss the flower pots."

959
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,750
I can't!

960
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:48,950
I say, Higgins, are those pebbles
really necessary?

961
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:53,550
If they were necessary for Demosthenes
they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

962
01:09:53,850 --> 01:10:02,250
Go on, Eliza.
"With the blackest moss the flower pots
were thickly crusted one and--"

963
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:07,550
I can't understand a word, not a word.

964
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,650
Perhaps the poem is
a little too difficult for the girl

965
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:18,250
Why don't you try something simpler,
like The Owl and the Pussycat?

966
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,550
Yes, that's a charming one.

967
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:25,350
Pickering, I can't hear a word
the girl is saying

968
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,250
What's the matter?

969
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:31,650
I swallowed one.

970
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:37,450
It doesn't matter. I've got plenty more.
Open your mouth. One, two....

971
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:45,350
"Quit, Professor Higgins"

972
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:52,450
"Hear our plea, or payday we will quit"

973
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:59,150
"Ay' not 'l', 'O' not 'ow'"

974
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:03,650
"Pounding, pounding in our brain"

975
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:11,950
"Ay' not 'l', 'O' not 'ow'"
"Don't say 'rine' say 'rain'"

976
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,750
"The rain in Spain...

977
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:22,150
...stays mainly in the plain."

978
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:24,150
I can't!

979
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,750
I'm so tired!

980
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,650
For God's sake, Higgins,
it must be 3:00 in the morning.

981
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,750
Do be reasonable.

982
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:38,750
I am always reasonable.

983
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:44,850
Eliza, if I can go on
with a blistering headache, you can.

984
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:48,450
I got a 'eadache, too.

985
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,950
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.

986
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:59,450
I know your nerves are as raw
as meat in a butcher's window.

987
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:04,150
But think what you're trying to accomplish.

988
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:08,650
Just think what you're dealing with.

989
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,750
The majesty and grandeur
of the English language...

990
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,150
It's the greatest possession we have.

991
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:18,650
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed
through the hearts of men...

992
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:22,750
...are contained in its extraordinary,
imaginative...

993
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,550
...and musical mixtures of sounds.

994
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,750
And that's what you've set yourself
out to conquer, Eliza.

995
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:36,350
And conquer it you will.

996
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,050
Now try it again.

997
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:09,850
"The rain in Spain...

998
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:15,550
...stays mainly in the plain."

999
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,050
What was that?

1000
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,950
"The rain in Spain ...

1001
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:32,450
...stays mainly in the plain."

1002
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:40,150
Again.

1003
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:50,450
I think she's got it.

1004
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:57,150
"By George, she's got it
By George, she's got it"

1005
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:00,550
"Now once again
Where does it rain?"

1006
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,750
"On the plain, on the plain"

1007
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,850
"And where's that soggy plain?"

1008
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:11,550
"In Spain, in Spain"

1009
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:26,250
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire"

1010
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:30,350
"Hurricanes hardly happen"

1011
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:35,350
"How kind of you to let me come"

1012
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,550
"Now once again
Where does it rain?"

1013
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,750
"On the plain, on the plain"

1014
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,850
"And where's that blasted plain?"

1015
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:49,350
"In Spain, in Spain"

1016
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:50,150
We're making fine progress, Pickering.
I think the time has come to try her out.

1017
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:51,950
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?

1018
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,650
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?

1019
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,150
-Very well, thank you.
-Good.

1020
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,950
Let's test her in public
and see how she fares.

1021
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,750
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding

1022
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,350
Do you know what it might have been?

1023
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:06,650
I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?

1024
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:09,150
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.

1025
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:12,050
-I know. We'll take her to the races.
-The races?

1026
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,050
My mother's box at Ascot.

1027
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:19,350
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.

1028
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:23,050
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1029
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,950
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

1030
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,650
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1031
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,850
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1032
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,150
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1033
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:35,150
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1034
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,550
Whitely's, of course.

1035
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:37,750
How do you know that?

1036
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,350
Common knowledge.

1037
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:41,250
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1038
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:45,950
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

1039
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,550
We'll buy something simple and modest...

1040
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,950
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

1041
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:54,550
Perhaps with a bow.

1042
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:58,050
Yes. That's just right.

1043
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:03,050
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.

1044
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,350
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

1045
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:08,050
You must put down your books
and go to bed.

1046
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:11,150
"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed"

1047
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:16,450
"My head's too light to try to set it down"

1048
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,250
"Sleep! Sleep! I couldn't sleep tonight"

1049
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:27,150
"Not for all the jewels in the crown!"

1050
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:32,050
"l could have danced all night"

1051
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:39,950
"And still have begged for more"

1052
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,250
"l could have spread my wings"

1053
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:52,350
"And done a thousand things
l've never done before"

1054
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:59,150
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"

1055
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:05,750
"Why all at once my heart took flight"

1056
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:11,450
"l only know when he"

1057
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,550
"Began to dance with me"

1058
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:19,450
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."

1059
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:24,050
"...all night!"

1060
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,450
It's after three now.

1061
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,950
Don't you agree now?

1062
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:44,650
She ought to be in bed!

1063
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,300
"l could have danced all night"

1064
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:57,450
"And still have begged for more"

1065
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,200
"l could have spread my wings"

1066
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:10,350
"And done a thousand things
l've never done before"

1067
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:17,100
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"

1068
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:23,650
"Why all at once my heart took flight"

1069
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:29,600
"l only know when he"

1070
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:33,350
"Began to dance with me"

1071
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:38,500
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."

1072
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,250
"...all night!"

1073
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,450
It's all been grand, dear.

1074
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:50,250
But now it's time to sleep!

1075
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:02,500
"l could have danced all night"

1076
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:08,950
"And still have begged for more"

1077
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,700
"l could have spread my wings"

1078
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:21,350
"And done a thousand things
l've never done before"

1079
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:29,200
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"

1080
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:35,250
"Why all at once my heart took flight"

1081
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,800
"l only know when he"

1082
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:44,550
"Began to dance with me"

1083
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,300
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."

1084
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:56,550
"...all night!"

1085
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:38,850
"Every duke and earl and peer is here"

1086
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:42,650
"Everyone who should be here is here"

1087
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:46,050
"What a smashing, positively dashing"

1088
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:50,550
"Spectacle, the Ascot opening day"

1089
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:53,950
"At the gate are all the horses"

1090
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:58,550
"Waiting for the cue to fly away"

1091
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:01,850
"What a gripping, absolutely ripping"

1092
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:06,650
"Moment at the Ascot opening day"

1093
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:10,450
"Pulses rushing"

1094
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:14,350
"Faces flushing"

1095
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:18,350
"Heartbeats speed up"

1096
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:22,350
"l have never been so keyed up!"

1097
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,450
"Any second now"

1098
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,350
"They'll begin to run"

1099
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,150
"Hark! A bell is ringing"

1100
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:31,150
"They are springing forward. Look!"

1101
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:35,550
"lt has begun"

1102
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:03,950
"What a frenzied moment that was"

1103
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:08,550
"Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?"

1104
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,950
"lt was a thrilling, absolutely chilling"

1105
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:17,550
"Running of the Ascot opening race!"

1106
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,350
Mother!

1107
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,650
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

1108
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,350
Hello, Mother.

1109
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:52,550
How nice you look.

1110
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:56,050
What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

1111
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,650
I can't. I'm here on business.

1112
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,550
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

1113
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,150
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

1114
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:05,050
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

1115
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,650
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

1116
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,750
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1117
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:13,150
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1118
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:16,650
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

1119
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:20,350
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1120
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:23,250
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1121
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,950
Common flower girl?

1122
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:26,950
I taught her how to speak properly.

1123
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,350
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1124
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,850
She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

1125
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:36,050
"Fine day! " and "How do you do?"
Not let herself go on.

1126
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:38,250
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

1127
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,550
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1128
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,650
She's got to talk about something.

1129
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:43,950
Where is the girl now?

1130
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,350
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

1131
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:52,050
I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

1132
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:57,150
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1133
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:58,950
You know my son, Henry.

1134
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,750
How do you do?

1135
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,150
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.

1136
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:07,450
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

1137
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:12,950
Where the devil can they be?

1138
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,450
Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1139
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:51,750
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1140
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,250
My dear Miss Doolittle.

1141
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:56,050
How kind of you to let me come.

1142
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,450
Delighted, my dear.

1143
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:02,250
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?

1144
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,550
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?

1145
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,550
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?

1146
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,250
How do you do?

1147
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:13,350
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1148
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,650
How do you do?

1149
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:19,550
How do you do?

1150
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,050
Miss Doolittle.

1151
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:26,050
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1152
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,250
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1153
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,750
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1154
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:40,850
Will it rain, do you think?

1155
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:46,750
"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain."

1156
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:55,950
"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen."

1157
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,550
How awfully funny.

1158
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:01,350
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1159
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,650
Smashing.

1160
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:05,650
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1161
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:09,250
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1162
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,350
They bring on so much influenza.

1163
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:14,250
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

1164
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:19,050
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1165
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:24,050
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

1166
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:26,050
Done her in?

1167
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,950
Yes, Lord love you.

1168
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,450
Why should she die of influenza...

1169
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:34,550
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

1170
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:37,350
Fairly blue with it she was.

1171
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,350
They all thought she was dead.

1172
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:45,250
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1173
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:54,150
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon

1174
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:56,750
Dear me!

1175
01:28:56,950 --> 01:29:00,150
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

1176
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:02,750
...have to die of influenza?

1177
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:08,850
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1178
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:13,250
Somebody pinched it.

1179
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,250
And what I say is:

1180
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:19,450
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1181
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:22,750
Done her in? "Done her in," did you say?

1182
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:24,550
Whatever does it mean?

1183
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:29,750
That's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.

1184
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,450
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1185
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,850
Do I not?

1186
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:40,250
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1187
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:42,750
But it can't have been right
for your father...

1188
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:46,050
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1189
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:47,750
It might have killed her.

1190
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:51,950
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1191
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:57,850
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

1192
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:59,650
Do you mean that he drank?

1193
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:04,250
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1194
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:10,050
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1195
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:13,450
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

1196
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:18,050
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1197
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:22,150
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1198
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,050
Not at all, my dear.

1199
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:27,750
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1200
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:32,650
I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

1201
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:34,850
...but come, my dear.

1202
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:38,550
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

1203
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,850
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1204
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,550
That's very kind of you.

1205
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,750
His name is Dover.

1206
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,950
Come along.

1207
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:50,650
"There they are again"

1208
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,750
"Lining up to run"

1209
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,550
"Now they're holding steady"

1210
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,850
"They are ready for it. Look!"

1211
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:01,950
"lt has begun"

1212
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:09,650
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1213
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:23,150
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

1214
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:31,050
Oh, my dear.

1215
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:48,250
You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1216
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:49,850
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1217
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:52,250
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1218
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,650
Her language may need
a little refining, but--

1219
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:58,350
Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

1220
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:00,050
...then you must be potty about her.

1221
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,250
I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

1222
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:03,950
...or this poor girl through any more.

1223
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:06,550
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

1224
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:10,150
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1225
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:15,150
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1226
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:18,750
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1227
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:21,850
Here's the car.

1228
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,250
Good evening, sir.

1229
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:43,750
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.

1230
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:47,550
Good evening, Professor Higgins

1231
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:08,350
"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon"

1232
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:12,150
"She completely done me in"

1233
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:16,150
"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon"

1234
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:21,450
"When she told about her father
and the gin"

1235
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:26,150
"And I never saw a more enchanting farce"

1236
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:31,850
"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--'"

1237
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:33,950
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?

1238
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:35,850
Whom shall I say is calling?

1239
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:39,250
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

1240
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:42,250
...tell her I'm the chap
who was "sniggering" at her.

1241
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:43,350
Yes, sir.

1242
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:45,750
And will you give her these?

1243
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,050
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1244
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,250
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

1245
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:54,550
No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

1246
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:06,950
"l have often walked
down this street before"

1247
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:12,550
"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before"

1248
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:18,150
"All at once am I several stories high"

1249
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:24,150
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live"

1250
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:29,750
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?"

1251
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:35,650
"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?"

1252
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:41,250
"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?"

1253
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:47,750
"No, it's just on the street where you live"

1254
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:52,850
"And, oh, the towering feeling"

1255
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:59,150
"Just to know somehow you are near"

1256
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:04,150
"The overpowering feeling"

1257
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:10,650
"That any second you may suddenly appear"

1258
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:16,150
"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me"

1259
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:22,150
"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be"

1260
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:25,250
"Let the time go by"

1261
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:30,050
"l won't care if I"

1262
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:36,450
"Can be here on the street where you live"

1263
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,050
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1264
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:47,250
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

1265
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:49,050
But why? She was unbelievable.

1266
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:53,450
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

1267
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:54,750
Tell her that I'll wait.

1268
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:57,250
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

1269
01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:01,550
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1270
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:14,750
"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me"

1271
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:20,550
"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be"

1272
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:24,150
"Let the time go by"

1273
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:29,450
"l won't care if I"

1274
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:35,850
"Can be here on the street where you live"

1275
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:46,950
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1276
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:50,050
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

1277
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:53,150
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

1278
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,950
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

1279
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:59,550
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1280
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:01,850
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.

1281
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:03,850
This experiment is over.

1282
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:10,050
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

1283
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:14,450
You understand, Higgins? It's over.

1284
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,250
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

1285
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:19,950
...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

1286
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:21,250
...it'll be on your head alone.

1287
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:22,650
Eliza can do anything.

1288
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:24,450
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1289
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,450
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1290
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:30,950
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1291
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:33,550
Think of how agonizing it would be.

1292
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:36,350
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1293
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,950
You could always rejoin your regiment.

1294
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,850
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1295
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:42,050
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

1296
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,150
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

1297
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:47,250
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

1298
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:49,350
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

1299
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:52,450
I'm not nervous.

1300
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:55,950
-Where is it?
-On the piano.

1301
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:57,150
The car's here, sir.

1302
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,950
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

1303
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:02,650
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1304
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,750
I warned you about these French designers.

1305
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:08,250
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

1306
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:12,350
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

1307
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:21,650
re you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1308
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:23,650
Well, we shall see.

1309
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:26,450
Suppose she doesn't?

1310
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:28,150
I lose my bet.

1311
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:31,950
There's one thing I can't stand about you,
your confounded complacency.

1312
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:34,050
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

1313
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:39,350
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1314
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:43,050
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1315
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:46,050
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1316
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,550
What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

1317
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:52,150
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

1318
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:56,450
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

1319
01:39:56,750 --> 01:40:00,350
It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

1320
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:02,350
...and soul from soul.

1321
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:06,850
Oh, she matters immensely.

1322
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:30,350
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1323
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:32,050
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1324
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:35,750
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1325
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:41,050
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1326
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:13,750
Maestro! Maestro!

1327
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:15,450
Don't you remember me?

1328
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,150
No. Who the devil are you?

1329
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:20,750
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1330
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:24,450
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1331
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:26,450
I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

1332
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:28,450
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

1333
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:30,250
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1334
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:33,950
I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

1335
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,050
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1336
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:38,050
Where did you get these old coins?

1337
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,050
These are decorations for languages.

1338
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:41,950
The Queen of Transylvania is here.

1339
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:45,150
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1340
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:48,150
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

1341
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:50,350
No imposter can escape my detection.

1342
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:54,150
Professor Karpathy.

1343
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,850
The Greek ambassador.

1344
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:57,950
Greek, my foot!

1345
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,850
He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

1346
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:03,950
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker

1347
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,450
He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

1348
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:09,850
...without betraying his origin.

1349
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:13,650
I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

1350
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:18,850
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

1351
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:41,050
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1352
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:46,850
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1353
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:51,350
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

1354
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:12,350
The Count and Countess Demereau.

1355
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:14,950
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

1356
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:18,550
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1357
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:21,750
Lord and Lady Clanders.

1358
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:26,450
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.

1359
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,550
Professor Higgins.

1360
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:33,650
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle

1361
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:35,050
How do you do?

1362
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:38,750
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.

1363
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:42,150
What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.

1364
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:43,950
Well, who is she?

1365
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:48,050
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1366
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,450
Professor Higgins.

1367
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:53,850
Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1368
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:57,850
So she has. A sort of garden.

1369
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:28,450
Henry gotta go home.
Here is an expert in languages.

1370
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:32,350
-Sort of, you know, "imposterologist."
-I beg you pardon?

1371
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:35,050
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

1372
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,850
Find out who she is.

1373
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:38,550
With pleasure.

1374
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:42,850
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1375
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:49,550
Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

1376
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:53,250
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1377
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:57,250
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1378
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:07,450
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

1379
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:12,350
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1380
01:46:56,950 --> 01:47:00,450
Charming. Quite charming.

1381
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:04,050
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1382
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:43,450
Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

1383
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:51,750
Absolutely fantastic.

1384
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:54,950
A lot of tomfoolery.

1385
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:57,050
It was an immense achievement.

1386
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,950
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1387
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:02,350
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

1388
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:06,050
Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

1389
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:10,150
Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

1390
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:11,950
Not during the whole evening?

1391
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:13,750
Not when I saw we were going to win.

1392
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:15,850
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

1393
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:17,550
It was an immense achievement.

1394
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:20,750
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

1395
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:22,150
Absolutely fantastic.

1396
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:23,750
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1397
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:25,850
Higgins, I salute you.

1398
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:28,650
The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1399
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:31,850
"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it"

1400
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:34,750
"You said that you would do it
And indeed you did"

1401
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:37,850
"l thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it"

1402
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:41,050
"But now I must admit it
That succeed you did"

1403
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,750
"You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight"

1404
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:47,150
"Oh, it was nothing, really nothing"

1405
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:50,150
"All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight"

1406
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:53,450
"Now wait, now wait
Give credit where it's due"

1407
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:56,650
"A lot of the glory goes to you"

1408
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:59,750
"But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it"

1409
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:02,750
"As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter"

1410
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,150
"There's no doubt about it"

1411
01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:09,250
"You did it!"

1412
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:15,050
"l must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright"

1413
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:18,950
"Never was there a momentary lull"

1414
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:23,050
"Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win"

1415
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:27,050
"And after that I found it deadly dull"

1416
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,350
"You should have heard
The 'oohs' and 'aahs'"

1417
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:31,450
"Everyone wondering who she was"

1418
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:34,850
"You'd think they'd never seen
a lady before"

1419
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:40,150
"And when the Prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her"

1420
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:45,450
"And gave his arm to lead her to the floor"

1421
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:48,550
"l said to him: 'You did it
You did it, you did it'"

1422
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:51,850
"They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic"

1423
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:56,150
"And they never knew
That you..."

1424
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:59,350
"...did it"

1425
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:01,650
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1426
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:04,050
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom

1427
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:06,350
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1428
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:09,650
Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks.

1429
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:12,150
"That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech"

1430
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:15,350
"More to blackmail and swindle than teach"

1431
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:18,150
"He made it the devilish business of his"

1432
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:22,250
"To find out who this Miss Doolittle is"

1433
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:24,750
"Every time we looked around
There he was"

1434
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:28,750
"That hairy hound from Budapest"

1435
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:32,050
"Never leaving us alone
Never have I ever known"

1436
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:35,550
"A ruder pest"

1437
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:41,350
"Finally I decided it was foolish
Not to let him have his chance with her"

1438
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:47,350
"So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her"

1439
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:52,850
"Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor"

1440
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:57,650
"Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away"

1441
01:54:57,850 --> 01:55:02,450
"And when at last the dance was done
He glowed as if he knew he'd won"

1442
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:06,150
"And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad"

1443
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:10,550
"He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud"

1444
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:13,650
No!

1445
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:23,550
"Her English is too good,' he said
That clearly indicates that she is foreign"

1446
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:26,650
"Whereas others are instructed
In their native language"

1447
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:30,250
"English people aren't"

1448
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:36,650
"Although she may have studied with
an expert dialectician and grammarian"

1449
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:43,050
"l can tell that she was born"

1450
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:45,950
"Hungarian"

1451
01:55:46,150 --> 01:55:49,550
"Not only Hungarian but of royal blood"

1452
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:51,850
"She is a princess"

1453
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:55,750
"Her blood,' he said
Is bluer than the Danube is or ever was"

1454
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:58,850
"Royalty is absolutely written on her face"

1455
01:55:59,050 --> 01:56:02,050
"She thought I was taken in
But actually I never was."

1456
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:05,550
"How could she deceive
Another member of her race?"

1457
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:10,150
"l know each language on the map"
Said he

1458
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:16,250
"And she's Hungarian
As the first Hungarian Rhapsody"

1459
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:26,750
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins"

1460
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:30,450
"For your glorious victory"

1461
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:34,650
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins"

1462
01:56:34,850 --> 01:56:39,850
"You'll be mentioned in history"

1463
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:03,550
Well, thank God, that's over.

1464
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:08,050
Now I can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow.

1465
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:11,050
-Good night, Mr. Higgins.
-Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

1466
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:15,050
I think I'll turn in, too. Good night.
It's been a great occasion.

1467
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:17,550
Good night, Pickering.

1468
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:19,850
Mrs. Pearce?

1469
01:57:20,050 --> 01:57:24,650
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

1470
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:30,350
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.

1471
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:19,250
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.

1472
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:21,150
I'll leave my head behind
one of these days.

1473
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:25,550
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

1474
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:29,950
Here are your slippers!

1475
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:38,050
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

1476
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,050
What on earth? What's the matter?

1477
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:41,850
Is anything wrong?

1478
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:44,950
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?

1479
01:58:45,150 --> 01:58:48,350
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?

1480
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:52,050
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!!

1481
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:53,850
Why did you throw the slippers at me?

1482
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:57,350
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1483
01:58:57,650 --> 01:58:59,650
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

1484
01:58:59,850 --> 01:59:03,550
You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

1485
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:07,950
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1486
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:12,050
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

1487
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:13,750
Sit down and be quiet!

1488
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:18,150
What's to become of me?

1489
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,550
How do I know what's to become of you?

1490
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:22,750
What does it matter?

1491
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:25,550
You don't care. I know you don't care.

1492
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:28,150
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

1493
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:30,050
Not as much as them slippers.

1494
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:31,250
Those slippers!

1495
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:36,750
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

1496
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:41,650
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1497
01:59:41,850 --> 01:59:44,350
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1498
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:45,350
No.

1499
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:48,550
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1500
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:49,850
No.

1501
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:53,750
Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1502
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:54,850
No.

1503
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:57,750
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1504
01:59:58,050 --> 02:00:01,350
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1505
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:04,050
Would you have a chocolate?

1506
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:08,350
No, thank you.

1507
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:12,850
Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

1508
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:14,750
Nothing more to worry about.

1509
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:18,950
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

1510
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:22,350
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1511
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:25,750
Why? In heaven's name, why?

1512
02:00:25,950 --> 02:00:29,850
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1513
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:32,250
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1514
02:00:32,450 --> 02:00:35,750
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

1515
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:37,050
Go to bed and sleep it off.

1516
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:41,850
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable..

1517
02:00:42,150 --> 02:00:43,850
I heard your prayers.

1518
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:45,750
"Thank God it's all over."

1519
02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:47,550
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1520
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:50,050
Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

1521
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:53,850
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1522
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:57,250
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1523
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:00,450
And what's to become of me?

1524
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:05,050
That's what's worrying you, is it?

1525
02:01:05,150 --> 02:01:06,950
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1526
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:13,150
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1527
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:17,750
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1528
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:20,150
You might marry, you know.

1529
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:24,150
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1530
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:27,850
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1531
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:28,950
You're not bad-looking.

1532
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:31,550
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1533
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:33,150
Not now, when you've been crying.

1534
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:35,050
You look like the very devil, but...

1535
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:41,350
...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

1536
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:43,850
Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

1537
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:49,450
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

1538
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:56,050
I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

1539
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:58,250
We were above that at Covent Garden.

1540
02:01:58,450 --> 02:01:59,950
What do you mean?

1541
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:03,250
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1542
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:06,450
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1543
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:09,150
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

1544
02:02:09,450 --> 02:02:12,350
...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

1545
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:14,450
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1546
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:16,150
What else am I to do?

1547
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:18,050
Oh, there are lots of things.

1548
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:20,650
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1549
02:02:20,850 --> 02:02:23,750
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1550
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:25,750
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1551
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:30,050
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1552
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:33,650
Come on now. You'll be all right.

1553
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:38,150
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1554
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:40,450
I was looking for something. What was it?

1555
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:42,250
Your slippers.

1556
02:02:42,450 --> 02:02:46,050
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1557
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:50,150
Before you go, sir.

1558
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:56,250
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1559
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:58,550
What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

1560
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:00,550
Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

1561
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:02,150
What may I take away with me?

1562
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:05,250
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1563
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:07,350
Stealing?

1564
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:10,750
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

1565
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:14,950
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

1566
02:03:15,150 --> 02:03:18,450
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1567
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:22,450
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1568
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:24,850
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1569
02:03:25,150 --> 02:03:27,750
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1570
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:31,050
Stop, please.

1571
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:35,050
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1572
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:39,750
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1573
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:43,150
Hand them over! If these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1574
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:46,050
...l'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

1575
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:51,450
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1576
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:54,750
I don't want it now.

1577
02:03:56,450 --> 02:03:58,450
Don't you hit me!

1578
02:03:58,650 --> 02:04:01,650
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

1579
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:04,450
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1580
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:09,150
I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

1581
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:12,850
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

1582
02:04:13,050 --> 02:04:15,750
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

1583
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:18,350
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce
about the coffee..

1584
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:20,050
...for it won't be done by me!

1585
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:24,850
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

1586
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:28,250
Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

1587
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:34,150
...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1588
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:30,150
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!"

1589
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:36,350
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late"

1590
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:40,250
"You will be the one it's done to"

1591
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:44,150
"And you'll have no one to run to"

1592
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:47,450
"Just you wait"

1593
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:20,150
"l have often walked
down this street before"

1594
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:25,950
"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before"

1595
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:31,750
"All at once am I several stories high"

1596
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:37,750
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live"

1597
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:43,550
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?"

1598
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:49,550
"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?"

1599
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:55,550
"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?"

1600
02:06:55,750 --> 02:07:01,550
"No, it's just on the street where you live"

1601
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:07,150
"And, oh, the towering feeling"

1602
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:13,650
"Just to know somehow you are near"

1603
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:18,550
"The overpowering feeling"

1604
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:24,950
"That any second you may suddenly appear"

1605
02:07:25,150 --> 02:07:29,950
"People stop and stare, they don't...."

1606
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:37,350
Darling.

1607
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:39,250
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1608
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:43,150
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

1609
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:44,850
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1610
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:51,050
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle,"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

1611
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:54,850
Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1612
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:57,950
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1613
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:01,550
I've written two and three times a day
telling you. Sheets and sheets.

1614
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:05,050
"Speak, and the world is full of singing"

1615
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:10,550
"And I am winging higher than the birds"

1616
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:14,350
"Touch, and my heart begins to crumble"

1617
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:18,350
"The heavens tumble
Darling, and I'm--"

1618
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:21,450
"Words, words, words
I'm so sick of words"

1619
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:24,750
"l get words all day through
First from him, now from you"

1620
02:08:24,950 --> 02:08:29,750
"ls that all you blighters can do?

1621
02:08:29,850 --> 02:08:32,950
"Don't talk of stars burning above"

1622
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:36,250
"If you're in love, show me"

1623
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:39,550
"Tell me no dreams filled with desire"

1624
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:42,750
"If you're on fire, show me"

1625
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:45,250
"Here we are together
In the middle of the night"

1626
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:49,350
"Don't talk of spring
Just hold me tight"

1627
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:51,750
"Anyone who's ever been in love'll
Tell you that"

1628
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:55,550
"This is no time for a chat"

1629
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:59,350
"Haven't your lips longed for my touch?"

1630
02:08:59,550 --> 02:09:03,450
"Don't say how much, show me"

1631
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:07,750
"Don't talk of love lasting through time"

1632
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:11,050
"Make me no undying vow"

1633
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:17,050
"Show me now"

1634
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:20,950
"Sing me no song, read me no rhyme"

1635
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:24,450
"Don't waste my time, show me"

1636
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:27,850
"Don't talk of June, don't talk of fall"

1637
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:31,250
"Don't talk at all, show me"

1638
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:33,650
"Never do I ever
want to hear another word"

1639
02:09:33,950 --> 02:09:37,950
"There isn't one I haven't heard"

1640
02:09:38,150 --> 02:09:40,450
"Here we are together
in what ought to be a dream"

1641
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:44,650
"Say one more word and I'll scream"

1642
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:48,150
"Haven't your arms hungered for mine?"

1643
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:52,250
"Please don't explain, show me"

1644
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:57,950
"Don't wait until wrinkles and lines"

1645
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:06,150
"Pop out all over my brow
Show me now!"

1646
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:10,550
-Where are you going?
-To the river.

1647
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:14,450
-What for?
-To make a hole in it.

1648
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:18,150
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?

1649
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:30,950
-But I've no money.
-I have.

1650
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:35,350
-Where are we going?
-Where I belong.

1651
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:51,850
Darling, shall I come with you?

1652
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:20,150
"With one enormous chair"

1653
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:25,750
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

1654
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:30,750
"Lots of chocolate for me to eat"

1655
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:36,250
"Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat"

1656
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:40,050
"Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet

1657
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:46,150
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"

1658
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:50,250
Buy a flower, miss?

1659
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:53,350
Yes, please.

1660
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:33,150
Good morning, miss. Can I help you?

1661
02:12:34,350 --> 02:12:36,350
Do you mind if I warm my hands?

1662
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:39,650
Go right ahead, miss.

1663
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:49,450
Excuse me. For a second
I thought you were somebody else.

1664
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:51,050
Who?

1665
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:54,850
Forgive me, ma'am. Early morning light
playing tricks with my eyes.

1666
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:57,850
Can I get you a taxi?
A lady shouldn't be walkin' alone...

1667
02:12:58,050 --> 02:13:02,250
...around London this hour of the morning.

1668
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:05,250
No, thank you.

1669
02:13:13,150 --> 02:13:17,250
"Someone's head restin' on my knee"

1670
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:22,150
"Warm and tender as he can be"

1671
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:25,650
"Who takes good care of me"

1672
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:30,050
"Oh, wouldn't it..."

1673
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:33,650
"...be loverly?
Loverly"

1674
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:54,150
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle.
We value your patronage always.

1675
02:13:54,450 --> 02:13:58,050
Thank you, my good man. Thank you.
Here. Come 'ere.

1676
02:13:58,250 --> 02:14:00,650
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton
with my compliments.

1677
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:03,850
Thank you, Mr Doolittle.

1678
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:07,950
Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

1679
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:10,750
Father?

1680
02:14:11,450 --> 02:14:14,850
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

1681
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:20,750
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

1682
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:25,050
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

1683
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:27,850
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

1684
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:29,350
As if you didn't know.

1685
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:33,550
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

1686
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,550
What's he done to you?

1687
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:36,850
Ruined me, that's all.

1688
02:14:37,150 --> 02:14:41,150
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

1689
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:42,650
And don't you defend him.

1690
02:14:42,850 --> 02:14:47,250
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford..

1691
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:51,950
...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

1692
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:56,550
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1693
02:14:56,850 --> 02:14:59,650
...a common dustman?

1694
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:01,750
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1695
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:05,250
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1696
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:10,950
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1697
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:15,650
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

1698
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:19,950
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1699
02:15:20,150 --> 02:15:24,250
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

1700
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:27,850
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1701
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:30,050
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

1702
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:34,250
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

1703
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:39,650
I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1704
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:43,050
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

1705
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:46,250
-Church?
-Yeah, church.

1706
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:48,750
The deepest cut of all.

1707
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:52,450
Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1708
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:54,450
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1709
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:57,650
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

1710
02:15:57,850 --> 02:16:01,050
If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

1711
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:03,350
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1712
02:16:03,650 --> 02:16:06,150
It's easy to say chuck it...

1713
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:08,250
...but I 'aven't the nerve.

1714
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:10,950
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

1715
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:14,450
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

1716
02:16:14,650 --> 02:16:17,150
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

1717
02:16:17,450 --> 02:16:19,850
Not my precious professor.

1718
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:23,550
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1719
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:29,050
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

1720
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:31,750
That's all part of his plan...

1721
02:16:31,950 --> 02:16:34,250
...but you double-cross him.

1722
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:38,950
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

1723
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:42,650
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it

1724
02:16:42,850 --> 02:16:46,250
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

1725
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:48,450
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1726
02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:52,650
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

1727
02:16:52,850 --> 02:16:55,350
St. George's, Hanover Square, 10:00.

1728
02:16:55,550 --> 02:16:57,450
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

1729
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:00,150
No, thank you, Dad.

1730
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:02,850
Are you all finished here, Eliza?

1731
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:07,650
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

1732
02:17:10,050 --> 02:17:11,450
Good luck, Dad.

1733
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:14,650
Thank you, Eliza.

1734
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:31,750
Come along, Alfie.

1735
02:17:32,050 --> 02:17:33,650
How much time have I got left?

1736
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:36,750
"There's just a few more hours"

1737
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:39,150
"That's all the time you've got"

1738
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:41,850
"A few more hours"

1739
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:45,150
"Before they tie the knot"

1740
02:17:45,450 --> 02:17:48,550
There's drinks and girls all over London.

1741
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:53,150
And I gotta track 'em down
in just a few more hours.

1742
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:55,450
Set 'em up, me darlin'.

1743
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:59,850
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"

1744
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:03,950
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"

1745
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:07,950
"Pull out the stopper
Let's have a whopper"

1746
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:12,450
"But get me to the church on time"

1747
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:16,550
"l got to be there in the mornin'"

1748
02:18:16,850 --> 02:18:20,750
"Spruced up and looking in me prime"

1749
02:18:21,050 --> 02:18:24,550
"Girls, come and kiss me
Show how you'll miss me"

1750
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:28,350
"But get me to the church on time"

1751
02:18:28,550 --> 02:18:32,550
"If I am dancin'
Roll up the floor"

1752
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:37,450
"If I am whistlin'
Me out the door"

1753
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:41,650
"For I'm getting married in the mornin'"

1754
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:45,950
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"

1755
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:49,750
"Kick up a rumpus
But don't lose the compass"

1756
02:18:49,950 --> 02:18:53,450
"And get me to the church"

1757
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:57,350
"For God's sake
Get me to the church...

1758
02:18:57,650 --> 02:19:01,350
...on time"

1759
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:06,650
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"

1760
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:10,550
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"

1761
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:14,350
"Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table"

1762
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:17,650
"But get me to the church on time"

1763
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:21,650
"If I am flyin'
Then shoot me down"

1764
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:25,850
"If I am wooin'
Get her out of town"

1765
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:30,250
"For I'm getting married in the mornin'"

1766
02:19:30,450 --> 02:19:34,450
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"

1767
02:19:34,650 --> 02:19:38,050
"Feather and tar me
Call out the Army"

1768
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:40,350
"But get me to the church"

1769
02:19:40,650 --> 02:19:43,750
"Get me to the church"

1770
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,500
...on time"

1771
02:19:56,150 --> 02:20:00,050
"Pull out the stopper

1776
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:40,250
"Drug me or jail me
Stamp me and mail me"

1777
02:20:40,450 --> 02:20:42,350
"But get me to the church"

1778
02:20:42,550 --> 02:20:44,150
"Get him to the church"

1779
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:50,850
"For God's sake
Get me to the church on time"

1780
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:42,900
"Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table"

1781
02:21:43,150 --> 02:21:46,650
"But get me to the church on time"

1782
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:30,350
"Starlight is reelin'
Home to bed now"

1783
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:37,050
"Mornin' is smearin' up the sky"

1784
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:41,150
"London is wakin'"

1785
02:22:41,350 --> 02:22:44,550
"Daylight is breakin'"

1786
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:47,250
"Good luck, old chum"

1787
02:22:47,550 --> 02:22:49,350
"Good health"

1788
02:22:49,650 --> 02:22:53,650
"Goodbye"

1789
02:22:54,750 --> 02:23:01,750
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"

1790
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:09,350
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"

1791
02:23:09,350 --> 02:23:13,450
"Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me"

1792
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:19,150
"For God's sake
Get him to the church on time"

1793
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:36,950
Didn't she say where to send her clothes?

1794
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:39,750
I told you, sir, she took them all with her.

1795
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:42,750
Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.

1796
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:46,050
Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go
without telling me about it!

1797
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:48,650
What'll I do? I got tea this morning
instead of coffee.

1798
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:51,450
I don't know where anything is,
what my appointments are.

1799
02:23:51,650 --> 02:23:53,350
-Eliza'd know.
-Damn it, she's gone!

1800
02:23:53,550 --> 02:23:55,550
Did either of you frighten her last night?

1801
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:57,850
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

1802
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:59,750
Did you bully her after I went to bed?

1803
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:01,150
She threw the slippers at me.

1804
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:03,150
I never gave her the slightest provocation.

1805
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:05,750
The slippers came at my head
before I uttered a word.

1806
02:24:06,050 --> 02:24:09,750
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.

1807
02:24:09,950 --> 02:24:12,450
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

1808
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:13,450
I'm dashed!

1809
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:17,050
Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

1810
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:19,750
Phone the police. What are they there for?

1811
02:24:20,050 --> 02:24:22,350
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

1812
02:24:22,650 --> 02:24:24,550
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

1813
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:26,550
But why not? I want to find the girl.

1814
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:29,550
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.

1815
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:32,550
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1816
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:35,750
Get me some coffee, would you please?

1817
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:37,650
Scotland Yard?

1818
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:42,650
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.

1819
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:45,850
27A Wimpole Street.

1820
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:48,750
I want to report a missing person.

1821
02:24:49,050 --> 02:24:52,050
Miss Eliza Doolittle.

1822
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:54,250
About 21.

1823
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:58,350
I should say about 5 foot 7.

1824
02:24:58,650 --> 02:25:02,650
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....

1825
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:06,250
-Brown.
-Brown.

1826
02:25:07,450 --> 02:25:11,950
Her hair? Good Lord.
Sort of a nondescript neutral sort of--

1827
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:13,750
Brown, brown, brown!

1828
02:25:13,950 --> 02:25:16,450
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

1829
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:19,050
No. This is her residence. 27A--

1830
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:24,050
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.

1831
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:28,050
No.... She's no relation, no.

1832
02:25:28,350 --> 02:25:31,450
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1833
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:33,050
I beg your pardon?

1834
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:35,850
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor
of that question.

1835
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:39,550
What the girl does here is our affair.

1836
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:43,650
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

1837
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:46,950
Well, I'm dashed!

1838
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:50,750
"What in heaven
could have prompted her to go?"

1839
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:53,750
"After such a triumph at the ball"

1840
02:25:54,050 --> 02:25:55,350
"What could have depressed her?"

1841
02:25:55,650 --> 02:26:01,150
"What could have possessed her?
I cannot understand the wretch at all"

1842
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:05,750
Higgins, I have an old school chum
at the Home Office. Perhaps he could help.

1843
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:09,350
Think I'll give him a ring.

1844
02:26:09,350 --> 02:26:13,650
Whitehall: 7244, please.

1845
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:17,250
"Women are irrational
That's all there is to that"

1846
02:26:17,450 --> 02:26:20,350
"Their heads are full of
Cotton, hay and rags"

1847
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:24,150
"They're nothing but exasperating
lrritating, vacillating, calculating"

1848
02:26:24,450 --> 02:26:28,750
"Agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags"

1849
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:32,550
I want to speak
to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

1850
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:35,750
Yes, I'll wait.

1851
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:44,350
Pickering, why can't a woman
be more like a man?

1852
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:46,050
I beg your pardon?

1853
02:26:46,250 --> 02:26:50,150
Yes, why can't a woman
be more like a man?

1854
02:26:50,450 --> 02:26:53,350
"Men are so honest, so thoroughly square

1855
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:56,750
"Eternally noble, historically fair"

1856
02:26:56,950 --> 02:27:00,150
"Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat?"

1857
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:03,850
"Why can't a woman be like that?"

1858
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:07,250
"Why does every one do
What the others do?"

1859
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:10,750
"Can't a woman learn to use her head?"

1860
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:13,550
"Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?"

1861
02:27:13,850 --> 02:27:17,150
"Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?"

1862
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:20,250
"Why can't a woman take after a man?"

1863
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:23,650
"Men are so pleasant, so easy to please"

1864
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:26,950
"Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease"

1865
02:27:27,250 --> 02:27:30,150
"Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?"

1866
02:27:30,350 --> 02:27:33,450
"Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?"

1867
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:36,550
"Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?"

1868
02:27:36,850 --> 02:27:40,750
"Well, why can't a woman be like you?"

1869
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:44,150
"One man in a million may shout a bit"

1870
02:27:44,450 --> 02:27:47,550
"Now and then
There's one with slight defects"

1871
02:27:47,850 --> 02:27:50,050
"One perhaps whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit"

1872
02:27:50,350 --> 02:27:54,150
"But by and large
We are a marvelous sex"

1873
02:27:54,350 --> 02:27:57,250
"Why can't a woman take after a man?"

1874
02:27:57,550 --> 02:28:00,550
"Cause men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind"

1875
02:28:00,850 --> 02:28:04,050
"A better companion
You never will find"

1876
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:07,150
"If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?"

1877
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:10,450
"If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?"

1878
02:28:10,650 --> 02:28:13,650
"Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?"

1879
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:18,150
"Well, why can't a woman be like us?"

1880
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:22,650
Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

1881
02:28:22,850 --> 02:28:28,250
Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is.

1882
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:33,150
You're quite right, it is. Good heavens.
By George, what a memory.!

1883
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:36,850
How are you, Bruzzie?
Nice to hear your voice.

1884
02:28:37,150 --> 02:28:40,650
What? You don't say.
Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?

1885
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:41,950
Right. Yes, oceans of water

1886
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:44,350
Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.

1887
02:28:44,550 --> 02:28:48,150
Something rather unpleasant
has happened. Could I come and see you?

1888
02:28:48,450 --> 02:28:50,250
I could, yes. Now, straight away?

1889
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:51,550
Right. Good. Thank you.

1890
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:55,750
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.

1891
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:04,650
Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along
to the Home Office.

1892
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:07,050
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

1893
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:09,050
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

1894
02:29:09,250 --> 02:29:14,450
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her

1895
02:29:24,850 --> 02:29:27,050
-Mrs. Pearce?
-Yes, sir.

1896
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,150
Where's the Colonel?

1897
02:29:28,450 --> 02:29:31,350
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

1898
02:29:31,650 --> 02:29:38,150
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs
for help. Now there's a good fellow..

1899
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:41,850
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

1900
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:45,550
"Why can't a woman be more like a man?"

1901
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:48,750
"Men are so decent
Such regular chaps"

1902
02:29:49,050 --> 02:29:52,050
"Ready to help you
Through any mishaps"

1903
02:29:52,350 --> 02:29:55,250
"Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum"

1904
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:59,150
"Why can't a woman be a chum?"

1905
02:29:59,350 --> 02:30:02,550
"Why is thinking
Something women never do?"

1906
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:05,750
"And why is logic never even tried?"

1907
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:08,850
"Straightening up their hair
ls all they ever do"

1908
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:12,350
"Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?"

1909
02:30:12,650 --> 02:30:15,650
"Why can't a woman behave like a man?"

1910
02:30:15,950 --> 02:30:18,950
"If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball"

1911
02:30:19,150 --> 02:30:22,250
"Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all"

1912
02:30:22,450 --> 02:30:25,350
"Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?"

1913
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:28,450
"Or carry on as if my home were in a tree?"

1914
02:30:28,750 --> 02:30:31,750
"Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?"

1915
02:30:31,950 --> 02:30:36,250
"Why can't a woman be like me?"

1916
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:41,950
You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...

1917
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:43,550
...without making a mistake...

1918
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:45,650
...they just sat there
and never said a word?

1919
02:30:45,850 --> 02:30:49,450
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

1920
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:50,250
Not a word.

1921
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:53,550
They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.

1922
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:56,150
The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

1923
02:30:56,350 --> 02:30:57,950
...and what a bore it had all been.

1924
02:30:58,250 --> 02:31:01,350
This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

1925
02:31:01,550 --> 02:31:03,750
I should have thrown the fire irons.

1926
02:31:03,950 --> 02:31:04,950
Who's that?

1927
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:09,550
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

1928
02:31:09,550 --> 02:31:11,450
Now, remember...

1929
02:31:11,650 --> 02:31:17,550
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

1930
02:31:22,850 --> 02:31:27,150
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

1931
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:30,650
You!

1932
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:35,250
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

1933
02:31:35,450 --> 02:31:40,150
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

1934
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:43,150
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

1935
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:44,950
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

1936
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:46,550
You've caused me enough trouble.

1937
02:31:46,850 --> 02:31:50,650
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

1938
02:31:50,950 --> 02:31:52,350
How did this baggage get here?

1939
02:31:52,550 --> 02:31:55,350
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

1940
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:58,450
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

1941
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:00,550
I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

1942
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:04,350
...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

1943
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:06,250
That's precisely what I mean.

1944
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:07,850
I'll see her damned first.

1945
02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:11,250
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

1946
02:32:11,450 --> 02:32:15,650
It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

1947
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:19,650
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

1948
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:22,050
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

1949
02:32:22,250 --> 02:32:27,250
...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

1950
02:32:28,250 --> 02:32:31,750
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

1951
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:35,650
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

1952
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:39,250
...but how she is treated.

1953
02:32:40,450 --> 02:32:42,850
For Professor Higgins,
I will always be a florist ...

1954
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:47,150
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

1955
02:32:47,350 --> 02:32:49,350
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

1956
02:32:49,650 --> 02:32:54,450
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

1957
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:59,050
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

1958
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:01,950
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

1959
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:04,550
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

1960
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:06,750
I should be excommunicated.

1961
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:09,350
I'll see him in the library.

1962
02:33:09,650 --> 02:33:12,250
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

1963
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:15,050
...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

1964
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:21,050
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

1965
02:33:47,350 --> 02:33:49,250
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

1966
02:33:49,450 --> 02:33:52,750
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

1967
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:54,750
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

1968
02:33:55,050 --> 02:33:57,950
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

1969
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:59,750
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

1970
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:01,250
Then what are we talking about?

1971
02:34:01,550 --> 02:34:02,950
Well, about you, not about me.

1972
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:05,750
If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

1973
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:08,050
I can't change my nature or my manners.

1974
02:34:08,350 --> 02:34:11,050
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

1975
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:14,950
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

1976
02:34:15,150 --> 02:34:17,250
I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

1977
02:34:17,550 --> 02:34:19,950
I see. The same to everybody.

1978
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:22,750
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

1979
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:26,750
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

1980
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:31,850
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

1981
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:34,450
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

1982
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:37,950
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

1983
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:40,050
I don't care how you treat me.

1984
02:34:40,250 --> 02:34:43,150
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

1985
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:46,450
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over

1986
02:34:46,750 --> 02:34:48,450
Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

1987
02:34:48,650 --> 02:34:50,650
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

1988
02:34:50,850 --> 02:34:55,150
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

1989
02:34:55,350 --> 02:34:57,950
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

1990
02:34:58,150 --> 02:35:02,150
I know you can. I told you, you could.

1991
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:06,450
You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

1992
02:35:06,650 --> 02:35:10,050
...whether I could get along without you?

1993
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:14,350
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

1994
02:35:14,550 --> 02:35:18,750
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

1995
02:35:20,350 --> 02:35:24,950
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

1996
02:35:25,250 --> 02:35:29,350
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

1997
02:35:30,750 --> 02:35:32,950
ell, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

1998
02:35:33,150 --> 02:35:38,950
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

1999
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:43,450
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2000
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:47,550
You are a devil!

2001
02:35:47,850 --> 02:35:50,150
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily..

2002
02:35:50,450 --> 02:35:52,750
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2003
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:54,850
What am I to come back for?

2004
02:35:55,150 --> 02:35:57,050
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

2005
02:35:57,250 --> 02:35:59,850
You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2006
02:36:00,150 --> 02:36:03,350
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want

2007
02:36:03,650 --> 02:36:04,650
And live with my father?

2008
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:07,350
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2009
02:36:07,550 --> 02:36:11,150
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2010
02:36:11,350 --> 02:36:14,450
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher

2011
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:17,350
That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

2012
02:36:17,650 --> 02:36:19,650
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way..

2013
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:22,850
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2014
02:36:23,150 --> 02:36:26,950
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2015
02:36:27,150 --> 02:36:31,950
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2016
02:36:32,250 --> 02:36:34,150
I want a little kindness.

2017
02:36:34,450 --> 02:36:37,950
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2018
02:36:38,250 --> 02:36:40,450
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

2019
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:45,850
What I done...what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2020
02:36:46,150 --> 02:36:50,850
...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to...came...

2021
02:36:51,150 --> 02:36:52,650
...to care for you.

2022
02:36:52,950 --> 02:36:54,550
Not to want you to make love to me...

2023
02:36:54,850 --> 02:36:57,750
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2024
02:36:57,950 --> 02:37:01,550
...more friendly like.

2025
02:37:01,850 --> 02:37:04,450
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2026
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:08,150
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2027
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:09,650
That's not the proper answer.

2028
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:11,650
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2029
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:13,950
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2030
02:37:14,150 --> 02:37:16,650
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2031
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:18,750
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2032
02:37:18,950 --> 02:37:21,250
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2033
02:37:21,550 --> 02:37:23,450
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2034
02:37:23,650 --> 02:37:25,450
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2035
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:28,250
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2036
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:31,750
If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2037
02:37:32,050 --> 02:37:34,650
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2038
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:36,550
I'm always in the wrong.

2039
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:38,950
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2040
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:41,150
...to be trampled on and talked down.

2041
02:37:41,350 --> 02:37:46,150
I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

2042
02:37:46,450 --> 02:37:48,850
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

2043
02:37:49,150 --> 02:37:50,950
...even if he had the guts to try?

2044
02:37:51,150 --> 02:37:54,850
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

2045
02:37:55,050 --> 02:37:57,850
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2046
02:37:58,150 --> 02:38:00,950
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

2047
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:03,150
I'll go and be a teacher.

2048
02:38:03,350 --> 02:38:05,250
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2049
02:38:05,450 --> 02:38:09,550
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

2050
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:17,250
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2051
02:38:17,550 --> 02:38:21,350
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2052
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:23,550
Teach him my methods, my discoveries

2053
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:26,250
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!

2054
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:31,550
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2055
02:38:33,250 --> 02:38:36,050
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2056
02:38:36,250 --> 02:38:40,450
Now, I don't care for your bullyin'
an' your big talk.

2057
02:38:40,750 --> 02:38:42,450
"What a fool I was"

2058
02:38:42,750 --> 02:38:44,350
"What a dominated fool"

2059
02:38:44,650 --> 02:38:47,750
"To think you were the earth and sky"

2060
02:38:48,050 --> 02:38:49,550
"What a fool I was"

2061
02:38:49,850 --> 02:38:51,450
"What an addle-pated fool"

2062
02:38:51,650 --> 02:38:56,050
"What a mutton-headed dolt was I"

2063
02:38:56,250 --> 02:38:59,750
"No, my reverberating friend"

2064
02:38:59,950 --> 02:39:05,650
"You are not the beginning and the end"

2065
02:39:06,850 --> 02:39:08,350
You impudent hussy!

2066
02:39:08,550 --> 02:39:14,350
There's not an idea in your head or a word
in your mouth that I haven't put there.

2067
02:39:14,650 --> 02:39:19,850
"There'll be spring every year without you"

2068
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:23,750
"England still will be here without you"

2069
02:39:23,950 --> 02:39:27,550
"There'll be fruit on the tree
And a shore by the sea"

2070
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:31,350
"There'll be crumpets and tea without you"

2071
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:35,150
"Art and music will thrive without you"

2072
02:39:35,450 --> 02:39:38,950
"Somehow Keats will survive without you"

2073
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:42,850
"And there still will be rain
On that plain down in Spain"

2074
02:39:43,150 --> 02:39:46,650
"Even that will remain without you"

2075
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:50,250
"l can do without you"

2076
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:55,850
"You, dear friend"

2077
02:39:56,050 --> 02:40:00,350
"Who talk so well"

2078
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:04,050
"You can go to"

2079
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:07,350
"Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire"

2080
02:40:07,650 --> 02:40:11,050
"They can still rule the land without you"

2081
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:14,850
"Windsor Castle will stand without you"

2082
02:40:15,050 --> 02:40:18,550
"And without much ado
We can all muddle through"

2083
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:20,550
"Without you!"

2084
02:40:20,750 --> 02:40:22,950
You brazen hussy!

2085
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:27,250
"Without your pulling it the tide comes in"

2086
02:40:27,550 --> 02:40:31,350
"Without your twirling it the earth can spin"

2087
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:36,650
"Without your pushing them
the clouds roll by"

2088
02:40:36,950 --> 02:40:42,050
"If they can do without you, Ducky,
So can I"

2089
02:40:42,350 --> 02:40:45,850
"l shall not feel alone without you"

2090
02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:49,550
"l can stand on my own without you"

2091
02:40:49,850 --> 02:40:53,850
"So go back in your shell
I can do bloody well--"

2092
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:57,850
"By George, I really did it
I did it, I did it"

2093
02:40:58,150 --> 02:41:00,650
"l said I'd make a woman and indeed I did"

2094
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:03,550
"l knew that I could do it
I knew it, I knew it"

2095
02:41:03,850 --> 02:41:06,450
"l said I'd make a woman
and succeed I did"

2096
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:08,650
Eliza, you're magnificent.

2097
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:11,250
Five minutes ago you were
a millstone around my neck...

2098
02:41:11,450 --> 02:41:13,350
...and now you're a tower of strength.

2099
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:16,350
A consort battleship.

2100
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:19,750
I like you this way.

2101
02:41:20,450 --> 02:41:25,850
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.
You shall not be seeing me again.

2102
02:41:37,950 --> 02:41:40,550
Mother!

2103
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:46,050
What is it, Henry? What's happened?

2104
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:47,350
She's gone.

2105
02:41:47,650 --> 02:41:51,750
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?

2106
02:41:53,650 --> 02:41:54,750
What am I to do?

2107
02:41:54,950 --> 02:41:58,150
Do without, I suppose.

2108
02:41:58,350 --> 02:42:01,650
And so I shall.

2109
02:42:03,350 --> 02:42:06,250
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs...

2110
02:42:06,450 --> 02:42:09,750
...let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her.

2111
02:42:10,050 --> 02:42:13,650
She's an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine.

2112
02:42:13,850 --> 02:42:15,750
Let her go. I can do without her.

2113
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:18,250
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul!

2114
02:42:18,550 --> 02:42:22,950
-My own spark of divine fire!
-Bravo, Eliza.

2115
02:42:47,350 --> 02:42:52,050
"Damn, damn, damn, damn"

2116
02:42:52,850 --> 02:42:56,550
"l've grown accustomed to her face"

2117
02:42:58,850 --> 02:43:01,750
"She almost makes the day begin"

2118
02:43:01,950 --> 02:43:05,150
"l've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon"

2119
02:43:05,450 --> 02:43:09,050
"Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs"

2120
02:43:09,250 --> 02:43:12,250
"Are second nature to me now"

2121
02:43:12,450 --> 02:43:15,550
"Like breathing out and breathing in"

2122
02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:19,550
"l was serenely independent and content
Before we met"

2123
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:24,250
"Surely I could always be that way again"

2124
02:43:24,950 --> 02:43:29,350
"And yet I've grown
Accustomed to her looks"

2125
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:31,650
"Accustomed to her voice"

2126
02:43:31,950 --> 02:43:37,250
"Accustomed to her face"

2127
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:52,150
Marry Freddy.

2128
02:43:52,450 --> 02:43:56,950
What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do.

2129
02:43:57,250 --> 02:44:00,250
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.

2130
02:44:00,450 --> 02:44:04,650
It's doomed before they even take the vow!

2131
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:08,350
"l can see her now
Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill"

2132
02:44:08,650 --> 02:44:11,550
"In a wretched little flat above a store"

2133
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:14,450
"l can see her now, not a penny in the till"

2134
02:44:14,750 --> 02:44:17,550
"And a bill collector beating at the door"

2135
02:44:17,850 --> 02:44:20,450
"She'll try to teach the things I taught her"

2136
02:44:20,750 --> 02:44:23,550
"And end up selling flowers instead"

2137
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:26,050
"Begging for her bread and water"

2138
02:44:26,250 --> 02:44:30,550
"While her husband has
his breakfast in bed"

2139
02:44:32,550 --> 02:44:36,850
"In a year or so
when she's prematurely gray"

2140
02:44:37,150 --> 02:44:40,550
"And the blossom in her cheek
has turned to chalk"

2141
02:44:40,750 --> 02:44:43,850
"She'll come home and lo
he'll have upped and run away"

2142
02:44:44,150 --> 02:44:47,050
"With a social-climbing heiress
from New York"

2143
02:44:47,250 --> 02:44:48,350
"Poor Eliza"

2144
02:44:48,650 --> 02:44:50,050
"How simply frightful"

2145
02:44:50,350 --> 02:44:52,450
"How humiliating"

2146
02:44:52,650 --> 02:44:56,050
"How delightful"

2147
02:44:57,050 --> 02:44:59,850
"How poignant it will be
On that inevitable night"

2148
02:45:00,050 --> 02:45:03,050
"When she hammers on my door
In tears and rags"

2149
02:45:03,250 --> 02:45:06,950
"Miserable and lonely
Repentant and contrite"

2150
02:45:07,150 --> 02:45:09,550
"Will I take her in
Or hurl her to the wolves?"

2151
02:45:09,750 --> 02:45:12,750
"Give her kindness
Or the treatment she deserves?"

2152
02:45:13,050 --> 02:45:17,750
"Will I take her back
Or throw the baggage out?"

2153
02:45:19,250 --> 02:45:21,750
"Well, I'm a most forgiving man"

2154
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:24,750
"The sort who never could, ever would"

2155
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:29,750
"Take a position
and staunchly never budge"

2156
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:35,050
"A most forgiving man"

2157
02:45:36,750 --> 02:45:39,650
"But I shall never take her back"

2158
02:45:39,950 --> 02:45:42,450
"If she were crawling on her knees"

2159
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:45,150
"Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan"

2160
02:45:45,350 --> 02:45:50,650
"l'll slam the door
And let the hellcat freeze"

2161
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:55,450
Marry Freddy.

2162
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:11,550
"But I'm so used to hear her say"

2163
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:14,050
"Good morning' every day

2164
02:46:14,350 --> 02:46:16,750
"Her joys, her woes"

2165
02:46:16,950 --> 02:46:19,550
"Her highs, her lows"

2166
02:46:19,750 --> 02:46:23,350
"Are second nature to me now"

2167
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:27,550
"Like breathing out and breathing in"

2168
02:46:27,850 --> 02:46:32,150
"l'm very grateful she's a woman
And so easy to forget"

2169
02:46:32,450 --> 02:46:37,250
"Rather like a habit one can always break"

2170
02:46:38,450 --> 02:46:43,250
"And yet I've grown
Accustomed to the trace"

2171
02:46:43,450 --> 02:46:47,250
"Of something in the air"

2172
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:53,550
"Accustomed to her face"

2173
02:48:29,650 --> 02:48:35,150
Oh, we are proud. He ain't above
givin' lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so.

2174
02:48:35,350 --> 02:48:37,350
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

2175
02:48:37,550 --> 02:48:40,450
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

2176
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:41,850
Good enough for what?

2177
02:48:42,050 --> 02:48:44,650
Good enough for you.
Now you know, don't ya?

2178
02:48:44,850 --> 02:48:47,150
I'm come to 'ave lessons.
And to pay for 'em, too...

2179
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:48,250
...make no mistake.

2180
02:48:48,450 --> 02:48:50,050
What do you want, my girl?

2181
02:48:50,350 --> 02:48:53,550
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop,
'stead o' sellin'...

2182
02:48:53,850 --> 02:48:56,050
...at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

2183
02:48:56,350 --> 02:49:01,350
But they won't take me unless I can talk
more genteel. He said he could teach me.

2184
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:07,050
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay. Not askin'
any favor, and he treats me as if I was dirt.

2185
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:11,450
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

2186
02:49:11,750 --> 02:49:14,950
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

2187
02:49:15,250 --> 02:49:19,750
It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.

2188
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:23,050
So horribly dirty. I'll take it.

2189
02:49:23,350 --> 02:49:28,250
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

2190
02:49:28,350 --> 02:49:32,850
I washed my face and 'ands
before I come, I did.

2191
02:49:45,850 --> 02:49:49,450
Where the devil are my slippers?
