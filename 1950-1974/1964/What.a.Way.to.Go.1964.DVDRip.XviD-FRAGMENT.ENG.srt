1
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,286
$17.52.

2
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,619
That settles my back taxes
for '59 and '60.

3
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,285
- That does it.
- Gougers, all of you.

4
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,955
- Gougers!
- Don't tell it to me.
I make 60 bucks a week here.

5
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,193
- Go ahead, lady. I can wait.
- Oh, thank you.

6
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,500
Is this where you give the money in?

7
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,807
Excuse me.
Is this where you give the money in?

8
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,741
Let me see your form, miss.

9
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,877
I mean, did you make out a form?
I mean, where are your papers?

10
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:18,083
Oh. This is the only paper
that I thought was necessary.

11
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,753
Oh, I can't take your check
without the regular 1040 form.

12
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,595
It's to be sure it's the correct amount
according to your return.

13
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,294
Well, this isn't according
to any return. It's just money.

14
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,303
I wanna give it to the government.

15
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,305
Well, this is very irregular.

16
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,070
First of all, this is the Department
of Internal Revenue and...

17
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,623
Oh, I get it.

18
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,852
April fool. Next!

19
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,951
- No, please.
- Next!

20
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,629
And... And I went to see
the head clerk...

21
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,401
and then the assistant
to the Secretary of Treasury...

22
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,068
and then the Secretary of Treasury...

23
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,078
But...

24
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,411
but when I insisted
on seeing the president...

25
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,713
they insisted I come to see you!

26
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,720
Dr. Svenson...

27
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,915
do you think I'm crazy too?

28
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,960
The... The name is "Steffanson"...

29
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,087
Victor Steffanson...

30
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,133
and, um... and we never
use that word around here.

31
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,933
Now, Mrs. Benson, you just take
one of these and try to relax. Here.

32
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,939
You know, Mrs...

33
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,771
Aaah! Pink!

34
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,572
Pink. They're pink pills!

35
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,342
- My husband was pink!
I can't take a pink pill!
- Ju-Just crunch it.

36
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,681
Crunch it right down.
Th-That's right. That's right.

37
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,893
Uh, Mrs. Benson...

38
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,796
You are obviously the victim
of some inner disturbance...

39
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,232
in which, well,
for the want of a better word...

40
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,738
your guilts have led you
to a state of fantasy...

41
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,898
in which, um, "A,"

42
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,239
you are burdened
with some fantastic wealth...

43
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,405
and... and "B," you are eager
to rid yourself of it...

44
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:26,248
as in the ancient ritual of exorcising
some dybbuk or, uh, evil spirit.

45
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,413
- Now, now, now, now.
Now, this is normal.

46
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,923
Excuse me.

47
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,262
Yes. Please don't...
What?

48
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,264
Oh, yes.
Put him on, please.

49
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,028
Oh, hello, Fred. Uh-huh.
You investigated. And?

50
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,539
F- Fred.
Th-The check is good?

51
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,368
Uh-huh. Yes.

52
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,380
Uh-huh.
Thank you, Fred.

53
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,614
I have the strangest
tingling sensation in my...

54
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,678
my toes.

55
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,820
Are you all right?

56
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,328
What?

57
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,332
- Uh, w-what happened?
- Well, "A," you fainted
and "B," I poured water on you.

58
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,096
I'm terribly sorry,
but I didn't know what else to do.

59
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,231
No, it-it's all right.
You did the right thing.

60
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,400
Um, do you faint often?

61
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,569
Oh, just once in a while.

62
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,706
It's the shock of realization whenever
I've been dead wrong about something.

63
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,444
The fainting is, um, running away,
as it were...

64
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,748
from the reality that I'm not...

65
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,585
I'm not infallible.

66
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,093
Y- You see,
it's been the pattern of my life...

67
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,651
from the time I was a...

68
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,129
Wait a minute.
What is this?

69
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,532
Who's doing what to who...
or whom?

70
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,662
Mrs. Benson,
you are a young woman...

71
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:57,437
who is apparently worth
in the neighborhood of... $200 million!

72
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,377
And for some incredible reason,
you wanna give it to the government!

73
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,904
Y- You don't need a psychiatrist.
You need your head examined.

74
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,213
- Now, out of my office! Out!
- No, Dr. Steffanson.

75
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,378
- Out of my office!
- You said something a minute ago...

76
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,718
that was very understanding and true.

77
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,726
I never heard it expressed before.
But I want your help.

78
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,955
- Mrs...
- Oh, please!

79
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,997
Ah, yes.

80
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,229
Yes, the oath I took forbids me
to turn away from a cry for help.

81
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,236
S- Sit down, Mrs. Benson.

82
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,399
Oh! It was what you said about
my wanting to get rid of my money...

83
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,741
like exorcising some evil spirit.

84
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,906
- Ah, yes.
- Dr. Steffanson.

85
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,917
- Mm-hmm?
- I think I may be some kind of a witch.

86
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,919
Oh-ho-ho. Come, come now,
Mrs. Benson.

87
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,080
This is the 19th centur...
er, uh, 20th century.

88
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:47,649
No! Really!
Every man whose life I touch withers.

89
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,586
Really?
Uh, Mrs...

90
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,967
Mrs. Benson, please,
just turn over and... and try to relax.

91
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,366
Go right ahead.

92
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:09,039
Well, I was born Louisa May Foster...

93
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,710
in the small town of Crawleyville, Ohio.

94
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,221
Oh, I can't understand it.
I never wanted money.

95
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,554
All I ever wanted
was to lead a simple life...

96
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,890
with one man to love
and to love me.

97
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,261
A simple life
somewhere in a little cottage...

98
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,894
that's all I ever wanted
ever since I was a little girl
with my mother and father.

99
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,336
Oh, your mother.
What was your mother like?

100
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,136
Mother? Well...

101
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:40,804
Mother kept Daddy and me clean,
neat as a pin, and took us to church
every Sunday.

102
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,544
So now I say unto you,
love thy neighbor as thyself.

103
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,485
'Tis better to give than to receive.

104
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:53,218
Money is the root of all evil.

105
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,557
Mother even had embroidered
these very sentiments...

106
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,427
on samplers
for our living room at home.

107
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:03,093
But we were poor, and Mother
found it hard to live up to these ideas.

108
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,603
Good day, Mrs. Jenkins.

109
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,105
Sherman, did you see Emily Jenkins?

110
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,768
That slob smothered in a mink cape.

111
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,141
I hate her guts!

112
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,146
Look what I've got.

113
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,048
Her husband was a shipping clerk
15 years ago, same as you.

114
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,713
Now look at him. Look at you. Where's
your drive? Where's your ambition?

115
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,588
That's what counts in this world...
Success! Money!

116
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,823
Success! Money!
President of the Nice Fellows Club!

117
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
Money! Success! Get to the top!

118
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,964
Money! Success! Money!
Money, money, money!

119
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,645
As the years went by...

120
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,648
I saw my dear, sweet Daddy
dwindle away under this...

121
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,310
till you practically didn't know
he was there.

122
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,551
I began to understand what Mother
really meant by those samplers.

123
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,765
You play your cards right
and we'll have more money than we need.

124
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,602
But, Mother, money isn't everything!

125
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,268
I know Leonard Crawley
owns Crawley's Emporium...

126
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,937
and three quarters of the property
in Crawleyville...

127
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,675
but I'm not gonna marry him just
because he's the richest man in town.

128
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,809
He's a sneak and a bore
and a drag...

129
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,446
and, oh, he's been
with every girl there is...

130
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,456
and besides, I don't love him!

131
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,618
- There's no such thing as love!
- He's a snob!

132
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,492
He's ashamed of you
and where we live.

133
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,964
Why, he won't even walk in this house
when he comes to call for me.

134
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,968
I wouldn't come in here either,
if I didn't have to.

135
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,130
Louisa, you turned out real beautiful.

136
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,040
You have something to sell.
Take a mother's advice. Sell it now!

137
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,145
- There's Leonard. You better hurry.
- No, I'm not going!

138
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,584
How dare you turn down
a man like Leonard Crawley!

139
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,748
I tell you he has money.
You go and get it!

140
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,927
Leonard was waiting.

141
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,122
I thought over
everything he had to offer.

142
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,759
The Crawley home, the Crawley stables...

143
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,803
Crawley's department store...

144
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,964
but then there was Leonard himself.

145
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,666
Leonard Crawley was, um...

146
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,706
Hmm. How shall I say it?

147
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,807
Well, that's not fair, I guess.

148
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,045
He was just Leonard Crawley,
son of wealth.

149
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,844
Put 'er right down next to mine, baby.

150
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,517
- Gee, I wish I'd said that.
- Aw, you can use it anytime you want.

151
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,618
Just give credit to Crawley.

152
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,528
That's more than Crawley
ever did for anyone else in this town.

153
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,895
Oh, by the way,
you better let your mom know...

154
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,904
that the payment's due
on her refrigerator.

155
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,304
Don't let her get the idea
that 'cause we're getting married...

156
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,308
I'm gonna let her off the hook.

157
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,311
Oh, no, no. By the way,
she couldn't be your real mother.

158
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,313
She must've been
left on your front doorstep...

159
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,248
one stormy night in a cage.

160
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,410
Why are you so intent on marrying me...

161
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,080
when it's perfectly obvious
I'm indifferent to you...

162
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,317
and all of the so-called advantages
you have to offer?

163
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,292
That's just it, baby.
You're the only girl in town...

164
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,092
who doesn't throw herself in front of me
in the mud and scream, "Take me."

165
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,258
You know, you suggest good breeding.

166
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,267
Heaven knows where you got it from.

167
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,599
But, uh, also
you'll produce me an heir...

168
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,764
and, uh, then my mother
will stop nagging me...

169
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,604
about carrying on the Crawley tradition.

170
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,611
- Any better reason than that
for getting married, huh?

171
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,443
- Hmm?
- How about love?

172
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,951
Love?
Well, let me put it this way, honey.

173
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,453
I'm very rich and you're very poor.

174
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,217
And sooner or later,
you're gonna come around.

175
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,488
Mm. You know the indifference I felt?

176
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,893
Hmm?

177
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,954
Well, it's beginning to change.

178
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,969
- It's beginning to blossom
into complete contempt.

179
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,971
What'd I tell you, honey?

180
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,872
I told you you were gonna come around
sooner or later.

181
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,010
I gotta pick up the 6:00 town news
from my store manager.

182
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,178
Mm. The Crawley gestapo.

183
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,814
Ohhh, yes.

184
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,125
Huh? Oh, that eyesore.

185
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,957
The only spot in town we don't own.

186
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,760
But it's just a matter of time before
old Hopper will come around.

187
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,662
Just like you, baby.

188
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,172
Good afternoon, Mr. Crawley,
Miss Foster. Nice weather we're having.

189
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,177
- All right. Make it fast, Driscoll.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,442
Mrs. Willoughby was five minutes late
getting back from the doctor's today.

191
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,415
- Oh. Five dollars fine off her salary.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,749
Hopper sent back the answer
to your latest bid on his property.

193
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,551
It's still "no."
He says he doesn't want to make money.

194
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,592
He just wants to
keep his little place as it is.

195
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,593
Edgar Hopper.

196
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,255
I haven't run into him
since high school.

197
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,229
Hmm. I wonder how many days
I'd get for manslaughter.

198
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,397
In Crawleyville,
they wouldn't even fine you, sir.

199
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,594
- Hi, Lenny.
- Edgar, you better
watch where you're going.

200
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:33,096
Yeah, you're right, Lenny.
I was looking at the sun.

201
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:36,258
- Aren't you angry?
- Why should I be angry? It was my fault.

202
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:39,098
- Then maybe we could fight.
- There's no sense in doing that, Lenny.

203
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,106
You'd kick the heck out of me...
all that football and golf and tennis
and everything.

204
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,267
You're a real winner, Lenny.

205
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,277
What are you,
an orthodox coward?

206
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:50,337
No, Lenny, I just believe
in passive resistance.

207
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,349
Oh. A Mahatma Hopper, I presume.

208
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,046
No, as a matter of fact, Gandhi and I
both got it from this guy... Henry Thoreau.

209
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,611
You're all covered with mud, Edgar!

210
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,386
Oh. I mean, Mr. Hopper.

211
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,054
Louisa...
Louisa Foster, isn't it?

212
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,723
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, I haven't seen you
since Mrs. Pritchard's class.

213
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,063
Hey, you've grown... or maybe I shrunk.

214
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,068
He wouldn't be covered
with all this mud...

215
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,070
if he'd let the town
pave that piece of road...

216
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,072
in front of his property
like anybody else.

217
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,074
It costs too much, Lenny.

218
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:22,078
For what you Crawleys
charge for a bag of cement,
this town oughta be paved with gold.

219
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,273
Thanks, Lenny.
Hey, I gotta be going.

220
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:27,079
- I don't wanna keep those trout waiting.
- See you.

221
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,086
Uh, don't grow any more, Miss Foster.

222
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,782
You're just right now.
Good-bye.

223
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,848
Bye.

224
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:08,392
- Oh!
- Hello. Imagine finding you here.

225
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,723
I just happened to be swimming by.

226
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,729
Well, you scared the fish away.

227
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:16,631
You could pull me in.
I am full grown... you said so yourself.

228
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:20,126
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

229
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,066
Here. Put this on.

230
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:26,576
Thanks.
Did you catch any?

231
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:28,737
Well, yeah.
Three, including you.

232
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,906
I'll cook them for you.

233
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,950
My clothes are right down there.

234
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,247
Do you have anything to cook them in?

235
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,756
Well, my baronial estate's
right over there.

236
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:42,259
- Is that where you live?
- Yeah. I...

237
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,421
It's kind of on the simple side.
I know.

238
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,158
Simple. Yes.

239
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:52,100
"Oh, our lives are frittered away
by detail.

240
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,661
Simplify, simplify."

241
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,673
What did you say?

242
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:01,201
- "Our lives are frittered away...
- "by detail.

243
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,043
Simplify, simplify."

244
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,481
A girl who can quote Thoreau!

245
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,884
Oh, I couldn't quote him before
I went to the library this morning.

246
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,388
I'd never even heard of him
before yesterday.

247
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:16,553
Wh... Uh, you mean you didn't
swim by my boat just by accident?

248
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:21,354
No.

249
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,366
Gee.

250
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,089
What is the future Mrs. Leonard Crawley
doing here anyway?

251
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:47,522
Well, now,
whatever gave you that idea about me?

252
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:51,995
Well, I don't know.
Everybody in town takes it for granted.

253
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,997
You are engaged to him, aren't you?

254
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,090
Well, he takes it for granted.

255
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,431
Tsk. Ohhh.

256
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,199
But, Edgar...

257
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:03,866
as far back as I can remember...

258
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,375
in grammar school,
in Mrs. Pritchard's class...

259
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:08,537
you know, when I sat in front of you?

260
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:13,107
I wished that I had had long pigtails
so you could stick them in the inkwell.

261
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,448
Did you really?

262
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,784
I'm not gonna marry Leonard Crawley.

263
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:20,790
Of course, he'll never understand
anyone turning him down.

264
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,893
Especially for you.

265
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:28,557
Louisa! You...

266
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,965
You mean you'd take this...

267
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,299
instead of all that?

268
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:36,204
But, Louisa, I've got... nothing.

269
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:38,208
I'll... I'll always have nothing.

270
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:42,576
- I'll always be nothing.
- Edgar, that's what I want... nothing.

271
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:45,912
To quote me and not Thoreau...

272
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,974
I love you.

273
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,453
Oh, Louisa.

274
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,193
I'll make you happy.
I'll never work hard.

275
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:06,134
I'll never make good.
I swear it!

276
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:11,637
It's true, Mother.
I've married Edgar Hopper.

277
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:20,276
Whereas Mother received the
news of my marriage to Edgar...

278
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,444
with ill-disguised displeasure...

279
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,182
Leonard took the news in his stride.

280
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:38,635
For a while, Edgar and I
led an idyllic life.

281
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,137
He went off to the store
a couple of hours a week...

282
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,639
but the rest of the time belonged to us.

283
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:48,543
As I look back on it, I see our life
together as a wonderful old silent movie.

284
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,027
Oh, I'll have this leak fixed in no time.

285
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:48,463
Well, that ol' water tank
always gave a lot of trouble.

286
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,625
I'm going down to the store
one of these days...

287
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,635
and get some chicken wire
and fix these springs.

288
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:56,639
- You can do almost anything
with chicken wire.
- I sure do love chicken wire.

289
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:58,971
- Leonard.
- If you're thinking of running
something up for dinner...

290
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,977
I'd be pleased to stay.

291
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,979
- Hello, Leonard.
- Hi. Hi.

292
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,914
If it isn't the happy Hoppers at home.
I've been all over the world.

293
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,747
This is the first chance I've had
to come over and see you lovebirds.

294
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:11,253
You know, I saw the Taj Mahal
by moonlight, Louisa?

295
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:13,916
- Hmm.
- Oh, but I envy you... here.

296
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:16,926
- What's that, uh, camera for?
- Oh. I'm doing a documentary.

297
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:19,827
Slum conditions in, uh, Crawleyville.

298
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,092
- Ahhh.
- Oh, come now, Leonard.

299
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,100
You needn't be such a sore loser.

300
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:28,764
Well, you gave me up for all this,
and I can understand it, you know?

301
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,433
A nice roof under your feet,
rain a-face at night...

302
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,944
all the grass you can eat.

303
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:38,948
Hey, Leonard, get outta here before
I twist your head off like a turnip.

304
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:41,780
Well, is this the voice
of passive resistance speaking?

305
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:44,787
No, just get out of here.

306
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,949
Oh! Oh, Louisa, you all right?

307
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,994
- Ohhh!
- Oh!

308
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,795
Well, another
innovation for modern living, huh?

309
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,027
Instant shower for milady.

310
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,570
- Well, well.
- I'm afraid I'm not a bit handy, Edgar.

311
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:02,572
Oh, no, but you are handy.

312
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,904
I could use you at the store
doing odd jobs...

313
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,910
and I'd pay you
and you could be earning a living.

314
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,572
- My wife doesn't have to work! I'm sorry.
- Aaah!

315
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,673
Ohhh.

316
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,684
Uh, let me...

317
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,516
Ed. Seriously, Ed.
Why don't you come down this afternoon...

318
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,579
and sell me
that piece of property of yours?

319
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,591
Uh, someone could
do something with it...

320
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,752
not you, of course,
but, uh, someone.

321
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:26,592
- I said to get outta here. Get outta here!
- All right, all right.

322
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:29,827
I will. I'm gettin' out. Sorry to have
barged in on you kids like this...

323
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,164
but I'll send a Christmas basket.

324
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,774
What's the matter, darling?

325
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,286
Oh, nothing.
I... think I'll go down to the store...

326
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:51,287
for a little while this afternoon.

327
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:53,789
But you were there just 10 days ago!

328
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,622
Well, it's got that chicken wire
I want...

329
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:59,458
and, uh, some nails.

330
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,158
You know, it's end of summer.

331
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,895
People come home from vacation.
Somebody might want something.

332
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:08,433
Uh, well, I'll be back.

333
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:15,070
But he never really
did come back...

334
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,444
not the Edgar Hopper I knew.

335
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,918
When he hadn't returned
by the next day, I hurried into town.

336
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:24,250
Hop, hop into Hopper's.
The lowest prices in town.

337
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:28,087
Unlimited credit. This is the biggest sale
in the history of our county.

338
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,094
Don't crawl to Crawley's, folks.
Hop, hop to Hopper's.

339
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,188
I guarantee you 10% off
because we've no air conditioning.

340
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,495
This is it, folks.
Right here on Main Street.

341
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,263
Hop, hop to Hopper's.
We undersell everybody.

342
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,327
Come right in, folks.
Instant credit.

343
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,999
If we haven't got it,
we'll get it for you, folks.

344
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,475
Don't crawl to Crawley's.
Hop, hop to Hopper's.

345
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,274
So all you shop...
Louisa.

346
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:55,679
- What is all this?
- Hopper's Taj Mahal, honey,
and it's all for you.

347
00:25:55,753 --> 00:26:00,315
Listen, Louisa, when that snake rattled
into our house, something snapped.

348
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,552
But where have you been?
Why didn't you come home?

349
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:06,323
There you were, mending the roof...
my wife!

350
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,662
Hop, hop, hop, you shoppers.
Hop to Hopper's.

351
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:13,294
Honey, I wanna get you things...
dresses and things for the house...

352
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,600
- a house!
- But I like our house.

353
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,607
What is it that makes a family...

354
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:20,769
go to the same store over
and over and no place else?

355
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,372
Well, I don't know.
Free eats, free toys for the kiddies.

356
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:28,077
That's it!
We'll stuff'em and then we'll sell 'em.

357
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:32,418
- Hop, hop, hop, you shoppers!
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's!

358
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,481
Come on, honey.
Let me show you around.

359
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,995
Hey, you kids. Get up on there and keep
with the "Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's."

360
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,997
- Eddie, this is wonderful.
- Oh, thanks, folks.

361
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,999
- Terrific.
- Thanks for coming.

362
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:45,433
- There's more bargains than that. Okay.
- We'll be back, Eddie.

363
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,437
- Some buys, Eddie.
- Edgar, uh...

364
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,599
- Congratulations, Eddie.
- Oh, thanks. The prices are low,
the goods are right...

365
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,608
so come to Hopper's
from morn till night.

366
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,940
- We'll be back.
- No kidding. We're open
till 10:00 every night.

367
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:57,776
- How's it going there, folks?
Those are all on sale.
- Oh, great.

368
00:26:57,848 --> 00:27:00,612
- Edgar, when will
we ever see each other?
- Huh?

369
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:04,484
Honey, as soon as this thing gets going,
we'll have more time together than ever.

370
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:07,353
But we had all our time
together before.

371
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,824
- What about Thoreau?
- Thoreau?

372
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,887
You don't want to "keep pace"
like all the others. You heard
"a different drummer," remember?

373
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:15,898
Oh, yeah.
I hear a different drummer, all right.

374
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:18,366
And the music I hear
says, "Hop, hop, Eddie.

375
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:20,426
Hop, hop."

376
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:26,240
Well, it looks like
we've got him at last, Driscoll.

377
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,778
Have we?
The people seem to be eating it up.

378
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:31,007
Anybody'll run to look at a freak.

379
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:34,949
I figure I give him three months and he'll
hop, hop himself right into oblivion.

380
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,419
<i><i>Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's <i><i>

381
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:40,082
<i> Hop, hop, hop, hop to Hopper's <i>

382
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:43,251
<i> Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's, Hop <i><i>

383
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:46,922
For-Forgive me, sir,
but we really must advertise.

384
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:49,329
We must, huh?
You're fired!

385
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:55,597
- Merry Christmas and
a hop, hop, "hoppy" new year!

386
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,941
Merry Christmas...

387
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,204
and a hop, hop, "hoppy" new year!

388
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,212
- I really bought a lot of stuff.
- I think you bought out the store.

389
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:08,547
And it's no trouble at all,
Mrs. Freeman. No trouble.

390
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,553
If you can't leave Hopper's,
Hopper's leaves with you.

391
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:13,215
Hey, Ned, you drop Mrs. Freeman off
on your way home, okay?

392
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,224
Okay, boss.

393
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,887
Oh, thank you, Edgar,
and Merry Christmas.

394
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:22,057
- Edgar.
- Be right with you, lady.
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Freeman!

395
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:24,066
Edgar.

396
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:26,568
Oh, hi, honey!
Excuse me. I gotta get back.

397
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:29,401
But, Edgar,
aren't you coming home soon?

398
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,907
Ooh, I'm sorry, Louisa.
We're staying open till midnight tonight.

399
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,171
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

400
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,577
I'm just a little lonely, that's all.

401
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,808
What? In that big beautiful
new house, lonely?

402
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:42,249
I'm the only one who's ever in it.

403
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,787
Edgar, it's Christmas.

404
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:47,619
But, yes, and Christmas is business...
big business.

405
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:50,785
You're working entirely too hard,
darling.

406
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:54,092
Honey, by this time next year, we'll be
so rich we can take a real vacation.

407
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:56,598
- Italy?
- Italy.

408
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,431
- Merry Christmas!
- Besides, what's the matter with work?

409
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:02,199
- A little hard work never killed anybody.
- Merry Christmas...

410
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,468
- Hi there.
- And a hop, hop, "hoppy" new year.

411
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,382
Edgar's hard work included hitting out...

412
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:22,050
with every modern sales device
known to man...

413
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,856
- And Crawleyville
was his captive audience.

414
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:26,725
We were millionaires overnight.

415
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,556
Darling,
I've checked the hotels in Rome...

416
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,067
and I have the reservations
for our vacation.

417
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm sorry, honey.
That'll have to wait till next year.

418
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,701
- Next year?
- Yes, next year.

419
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,742
In the meantime,
get yourself a couple of art books...

420
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,743
and a box of spaghetti.

421
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:44,247
Oh! You liar!
You cheat!

422
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,909
- You deceived me!
- Deceived you?

423
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:49,578
What, you think I got a blond tootsie
on the side or something?

424
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,587
Oh! I just wish you had!

425
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:54,089
At least then
I'd know you were relaxing!

426
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,854
Ohhh.

427
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:02,524
Oh! You don't even
have any feelings anymore.

428
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,261
When we got married,
you promised for better or for worse...

429
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,100
that you'd never make good,
that you'd always be nothing!

430
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:11,938
Well, look at us! We're so rich
we never even see each other anymore.

431
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:16,946
Edgar! You're "frittering away your life
in detail. Simplify, simplify."

432
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:20,950
Simplify schmimmplify!
A little hard work never killed anybody.

433
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,190
Edgar was bewitched like
the sorcerer's apprentice.

434
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:29,451
- He couldn't stop.
- Get me 300,000 feet
of rust-proof chicken wire.

435
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:31,460
What is with our order...

436
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,894
on the Mother Goose
atomic disintegrator kit?

437
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:39,368
No, make 'em think they can't live
without doorknobs that light up
in the dark. Think big!

438
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:42,462
Our musical mop which plays
"Let Me Call You Sweetheart,
I'm in Love with You,"

439
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,473
is a marketing failure.

440
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:48,068
Get something happier
like "Star and Stripes Forever"
to guarantee musical mop-up.

441
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,238
So it is just a simple equation!

442
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:54,478
Service quotient "X" plus
condensation-atmospheric quotient "Y"...

443
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,644
plus smile-and-affability quotient "X"...

444
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,314
show in the last three months
a sales gain line...

445
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,880
that has hop, hop, hopped
right off the lousy board!

446
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,587
In short, boys,
we are becoming, by the figures...

447
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,754
the big, bigger, biggest!

448
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:14,529
Uh, "In re yours of the 23rd,
I am impatiently awaiting your order."

449
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,698
Uh, "Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper."

450
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,833
"There can be no delays. If you insist
on delaying, you can always be replaced.

451
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,844
Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper."

452
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,846
"Since your delivery service
has not been quick enough...

453
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:25,848
"we are terminating
our agreement with you.

454
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,850
Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper."

455
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,819
"I'd like all those folders rushed out
to the entire mailing list by Monday.

456
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:32,821
Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper."

457
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,914
"Order canceled. We asked you for goods,
you gave us promises.

458
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,392
Hastily yours," uh, "Edgar Hopper."

459
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:40,897
"All the displays in all the branch stores
must be changed daily and rotated.

460
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:42,898
Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper."

461
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:45,332
"That is my final word on the subject.
Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper."

462
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:47,802
"I've got to have
10,000 bedsprings at once.

463
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:50,305
"Hostilely yours, Edgar Haper...
Heaver... " uh, "Hop... "

464
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,808
Uh, uh, "Hastily yours, the hop head,"

465
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,504
uh, "Hastily yours, the Boss."

466
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,570
All right. I'd like that
all in triplicate right away.

467
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:00,481
Mr. Hopper, no one can work like this.
The pace, it's too fast.

468
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,916
W- We're not machines.
We're human beings.

469
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:06,922
There is no place here
for anyone who cannot keep up
with the pace of modern living.

470
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,981
You are fired.

471
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,570
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's.
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's.

472
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:07,779
Yes? It happened!

473
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,945
Get me my house, quick!

474
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,421
You just closed the deal?
My wife! Hurry!

475
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,424
Leonard Crawley
just handed over the keys.

476
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:18,086
Louisa. Louisa! Louisa!

477
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:23,129
- Hello.
- Louisa, it happened.

478
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
- What's happened?
- The next time you walk down Main Street...

479
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,770
there won't be any Crawley's there.

480
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:29,806
It's gonna say "Hopper's."
Louisa, I did it!

481
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,068
I wiped him out!
He's through in this town!

482
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:35,543
I guess that's
what you wanted, isn't it?

483
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:40,208
Oh, I got what I wanted. And I got money,
wealth, success, position.

484
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:43,844
And next year, this town
is gonna be called Hopperville.

485
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,184
And how'd I get all these things?
Through work.

486
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:48,781
Just good hard work.

487
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:51,350
Which all goes to prove...

488
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:53,953
that a little hard work
never killed anybody.

489
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:02,096
"And outside of the bequest...

490
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:06,165
"of one roll of chicken wire
to Leonard Crawley...

491
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:09,610
"I bequeath my entire fortune
and worldly goods...

492
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,241
to my wife,
Louisa May Foster Hopper."

493
00:34:14,317 --> 00:34:17,252
Edgar had left me
approximately $2 million...

494
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,254
in cash and securities.

495
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:23,156
And as Thoreau probably never said,
that's a lot of lettuce.

496
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,393
But, uh, my dear...

497
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:31,400
you... you mustn't think that this,
in any way, makes you a witch.

498
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:34,869
Oh, of course,
it is tragic that Edgar died...

499
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:37,270
but one swallow
doesn't make a summer.

500
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,776
Your, uh, behavior sounds exemplary
to say the least, the very least.

501
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:45,440
Oh, why did Edgar change that way?

502
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:48,916
Oh, normal.
Quite normal.

503
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:51,954
You see, he was the, uh...
the weakest of the tribe...

504
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:54,616
who had somehow won the prize... you...

505
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,784
without really having had
to fight for you.

506
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,953
Uh, latent feelings of inadequacy
lay dormant...

507
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:03,659
until he was triggered by
Leonard parading before you in
his rich, many-colored feathers.

508
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:08,397
Edgar, naturally,
felt impelled to get even more feathers...

509
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:12,909
and driven by this ego drive,
he smothered in his own, uh, feathers.

510
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:15,911
It happens every day, you know.

511
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:19,278
Tell me, um,
what happened to the other feather...

512
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,216
or, uh, fellow, this, uh, Leonard?

513
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,584
I never heard from him again.

514
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,820
- Dr. Steffanson... Aaah! Aaah!
- Oh!

515
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:36,058
Oh! Oh! Louisa!

516
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:38,999
I'm sorry. Just relax!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

517
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:45,436
There.
Now, please, please, ju-just relax.

518
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,443
- Mm. Yes.
- Try to relax.

519
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:50,605
Uh, y-you were saying about,
uh, Leonard. Leonard.

520
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,615
W- Where did Leonard go?

521
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:56,243
Uh, well...

522
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:59,786
he just walked away
like a plucked chicken.

523
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:02,882
Uh-huh. Normal.
Quite... Quite normal.

524
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:06,486
Yeah. Well, I...

525
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:09,464
I put all the money in the bank and...

526
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:12,024
- I gave the house to Mama.
- Uh-huh.

527
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:16,766
Then I took a small allowance
for myself and I got out of Crawleyville.

528
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,774
Mm-hmm.

529
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:23,245
I took a trip to Europe alone,
to Paris.

530
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:25,247
I wanted to forget...

531
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:29,149
and I was determined
never to marry again.

532
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,098
The bus tours were thrilling
and exhausting.

533
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:06,718
Place de la, uh...

534
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,054
des jardins de...

535
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,218
Ohhh.

536
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:14,786
- "Est-ce que... "
- I ain't got all day, lady.
Where do you wanna go?

537
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:19,426
- Oh. You speak English.
- All of us foreigners do. It's compulsory.

538
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:22,437
You American?

539
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:25,269
Nah, lady,
I'm a Russian spy for the C.I.A.

540
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,276
Well, what'll it be, huh...

541
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:30,074
go to the American ghetto
at the bar at the Georges Cinq...

542
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:32,410
or go visit
some of your phony friends...

543
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,677
learning about life
at Les Deux Magots?

544
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,553
Well, frankly, I'd like to do either,
but, uh, I don't know anybody here.

545
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,450
Well?

546
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:10,213
Oh. Well.

547
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:13,255
Uh, well, I think I'd like to
see some more pictures.

548
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,883
I've just been through the Louvre,
and that was wonderful.

549
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,554
The Louvre. Now, what is that?
It's the garbage pail of the arts.

550
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:21,563
Et vous! Allez, allez!

551
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,565
Démarrez!

552
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:27,399
Well, uh, how about the show
at the Galeries Lafayette?

553
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,404
That's a department store, lady...

554
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:32,236
but I'd rather hang up
one of their face towels
than some of that other junk.

555
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:35,243
Listen, I'm sure
you're an expert taxi driver...

556
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:37,336
and I don't mean
to belittle your profession...

557
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:39,348
but why should I listen
to your opinion on art?

558
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:44,078
Because I happen to be
one of five people today...

559
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:46,088
who could definitely
be called an artist.

560
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:48,852
Maybe six, including Frieda.

561
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:53,385
- Who's Frieda?
- A chimpanzee on my block.

562
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:58,423
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

563
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,799
I mean, you see a technique like that,
it just wipes you out.

564
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,430
- I go ape!
- Uh, what is it?

565
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:05,531
What is it?
Innocence!

566
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:09,066
Van Gogh had it, but, uh,
then he had to chop his ear off...

567
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:11,079
in order to free himself.

568
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:14,708
- Free himself from what?
- Intellectual hang-up.

569
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:17,252
You know, if we could all do that,
go back to a life like that...

570
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,254
uncluttered, unhung...

571
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:21,984
simple.

572
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:25,494
- Oh.
- Well, Frieda had the best
teacher in the world, you know.

573
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:27,757
- Rene Carrere there.
- Ohhh.

574
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:31,631
I'm very happy to meet you, Mr. Carrere.
I'm Louisa May Hopper.

575
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:37,071
You don't look anything like
the Emile Desjardins it said
you are in your cab.

576
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,404
The name is Larry Flint.

577
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:43,276
I just take Emile's cab out for him
once a year... the day his wife has a baby.

578
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:45,473
Frieda is finished now.

579
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,781
It's a masterpiece!

580
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:51,980
Boy! Look at the line!

581
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:55,286
And the color and the sweep
and the texture.

582
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:57,883
Marvelous!

583
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,260
A testament to the human spirit!

584
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,925
Total primitive articulation!

585
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,764
- Mwah!
- Does Frieda's work sell?

586
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:10,101
Sell? You think Frieda cares
whether her work sells?

587
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,107
You think I care
whether my work sells?

588
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:15,508
Typical American yardstick...
the eternal buck!
That's why I left the place.

589
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:18,604
Well, Mr. Flint,
I was only asking. Um...

590
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,115
Aaah! What's that?

591
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:23,846
She's at it again.

592
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,320
Aaah! Well, is someone
being murdered? Aaah!

593
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:28,323
Are we going to the police?

594
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:33,359
Hey, Larry.
She shot three already!

595
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,726
Hey, Polly,
you're working again.

596
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:43,136
Yeah. For weeks
I thought I couldn't paint again...

597
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,538
and now, suddenly, it's all come back!

598
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:53,307
One of the greats.

599
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,681
Ugh! That picture makes me sick!

600
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,686
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

601
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:59,813
Good. Feel sick.
It should make you feel sick.

602
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,823
It's destruction, pure and simple.

603
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:05,088
That's what today is all about.
That technique is her way of expressing it.

604
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:08,858
Ugh! Aaah!

605
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:12,925
What was I doing in Paris
4,500 miles away from home?

606
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:16,267
It was fate.
I had come to meet Larry Flint...

607
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,432
an unspoiled, dedicated artist...

608
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:21,944
searching in his own troubled way
for the simple life.

609
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:24,844
Suddenly,
I knew I wanted to share that life.

610
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:29,546
Well, I never did go back to the Ritz.

611
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:31,553
I'll never forget the wedding.

612
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,283
Frieda made a lovely bridesmaid.

613
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:37,121
As a matter of fact,
she caught the bridal bouquet and ate it.

614
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:42,958
For a while,
Larry and I led an idyllic life.

615
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:47,594
As I look back on it,
it all seems like one of those
wickedly romantic French movies.

616
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:21,997
To your health, Louisa!

617
00:43:01,577 --> 00:43:04,045
- Louisa!
- Louisa!

618
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:09,168
The rest of the time, I kept house.

619
00:44:09,244 --> 00:44:11,644
Ah, la vie de Bohème!

620
00:44:11,714 --> 00:44:13,909
Le sacrifice d'amour.

621
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,731
- This week's dinner.
- Oh, darling!

622
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,200
Beautiful!

623
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:37,261
- How did you...
- Opus 752.

624
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:41,275
But, darling, that's one of
your most beautiful paintings.

625
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,277
Well, we can see it anytime
we go to the butcher shop.

626
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:46,314
Monsieur Blanchard has got it hanging
right over the tripe and the sweetbreads.

627
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:51,376
- But I've told you so many times,
in the United States in a bank...
- Won't touch it... not a nickel!

628
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:54,115
Money corrupts.
Art erupts.

629
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,453
Oh, that's a beautiful saying.

630
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:58,686
It's immortal.
I just made it up.

631
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:02,458
Hey, uh, say, listen, why don't you
bring some of that downstairs for me?

632
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:04,624
Will you?
I got some erupting to do.

633
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:38,165
Darling, your soup's on.

634
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,167
Soup.

635
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:49,611
Darling, must you make
so much noise when you paint?

636
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:52,680
Ain't no other way, honey.

637
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:54,682
Tools of my trade, like I told you.

638
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,514
See, the sound, the sonic vibrations,
they go in there.

639
00:45:57,586 --> 00:46:00,111
And then that gets transmitted
to that photoelectric cell...

640
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:03,647
which gives those dynamic impulses
to the brushes and the arms...

641
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:09,220
and it's a fusion of the mechanized world
and a human soul.

642
00:46:09,298 --> 00:46:12,495
It's the only affirmative statement
being made in the world of art today.

643
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:15,435
I- I'm sorry. I forgot.

644
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:17,472
It's a terrible thing, being so dumb.

645
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,473
Well, you're really not so dumb, honey...

646
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,339
'cause, to tell the truth,
I don't understand it myself.

647
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:42,763
I left the machine on.

648
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:45,800
Larry!

649
00:46:45,868 --> 00:46:48,359
Larry.

650
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,928
I know this probably
sounds stupid to you...

651
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:53,941
but what if we take a record...

652
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:56,842
and we put it on and we play it
through the, uh... the...

653
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:59,676
- Sonic palette.
- The sonic palette.

654
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:02,649
Silly kid. Go ahead.

655
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,652
Mendelssohn's "Spring Song"...

656
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,711
that's my favorite.

657
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,881
Larry?

658
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:19,724
Larry. Oh, I like the ones
you make with your own noises.

659
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:21,956
They're the real you.

660
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:27,632
Yeah, but, uh,
I hate to waste a good canvas...

661
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:30,729
so I might try to pay a bill with it.

662
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:33,639
Maybe the butcher
won't know the difference...

663
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:36,234
between a real Larry Flint
and a Mendelssohn.

664
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:44,249
Hey, Louisa. Hey!
Guess what.

665
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,083
- What, darling?
- I didn't leave it at the butcher's.

666
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:50,750
I was there showing it to him,
and there was this customer
there buying pig's knuckles.

667
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:55,593
So, um, he looks at the picture
and then he puts on his glasses
and he gives me his card...

668
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:58,098
and he gives me 40,000 francs!

669
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,760
That's almost $200.

670
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:02,861
Oh. Why, that's wonderful, darling.

671
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:05,702
All from that silly little idea.

672
00:49:05,774 --> 00:49:07,867
Yeah, well, I gotta go downstairs
and get to work.

673
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:13,778
I'll be listening for all those
dear funny little noises.

674
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:59,659
Aha! Das ist gute, Ludwig.

675
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,260
The show was a smashing success.

676
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:38,288
- Merci, madame.
- Larry
was famous and rich overnight.

677
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:41,461
In the middle of this excitement,
I was filled with apprehension...

678
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:43,470
although I tried to conceal it.

679
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:46,302
- Congratulations, Master.
- I am insufferably honored.

680
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:49,310
Frieda and I are very happy.

681
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:52,814
At last, painting which is music
and music which is painting.

682
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:56,476
- How do you do it?
- Oh, can anyone explain
the workings of the inner man?

683
00:50:56,551 --> 00:51:00,817
Actually, the act of creation might best
be described as pure animal instinct.

684
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:04,916
If only Beethoven were alive
to just hear this painting.

685
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:07,587
Ah, yes. Pauvre Ludwig.
I think he'd be very pleased.

686
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:11,428
Your paintings make me
want to kneel, pray and cry.

687
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,525
Well, in that case, Baroness,
why don't you buy one...

688
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:15,661
then you can kneel and pray
and cry at home.

689
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:17,796
Sensation, Master!

690
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:22,276
- Please.
- Please. Please let me
introduce you to all Paris.

691
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:25,609
Well, thank you very much,
but me wife and I don't
take much to the high places.

692
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,446
We'll just go back to our little garage
and attic. I got work to do.

693
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,616
But, of course, we didn't
go back to the old place.

694
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:36,816
We had a lovely house
on Isle St. Louis.

695
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:38,826
But Larry was never there.

696
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:40,828
If he wasn't entertaining
at the gallery...

697
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:43,364
he was at his studio
just outside of Paris.

698
00:51:58,814 --> 00:52:01,305
I was tired of being alone...

699
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:04,910
tired of wearing these ridiculous outfits
Larry painted for me.

700
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:07,079
What kind of life was this?

701
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:09,248
I was just another canvas to him...

702
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:11,758
just another walking catalog.

703
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:14,421
Where was the simple life
Larry and I had had...

704
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:16,589
that vie de Bohème?

705
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:18,758
He was obsessed with success.

706
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:22,429
I had to get him back. I couldn't
let that happen to me a second time.

707
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:24,563
Suddenly, I had an idea.

708
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:50,221
What are you doing up there?
Get down! Down!

709
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:53,392
What the...

710
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,934
Stop that right now!
Stop that! Stop that!

711
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,237
Come on, now! Stop that!

712
00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:06,113
Louisa, what are you doing here?

713
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:08,911
Darling, I haven't seen you in so long.

714
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:11,919
What do you mean? We had dinner together
only last week. What do you want?

715
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:14,080
Uh, I have a surprise for you.

716
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,381
Aha!

717
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:25,659
Larry!

718
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:30,631
Larry!

719
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:32,673
Look who's here!

720
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:35,938
- Well, how is Frieda?
- Oh, painting better than ever.

721
00:53:36,011 --> 00:53:39,447
Larry. Larry, we have missed you,
Larry.

722
00:53:39,514 --> 00:53:41,675
Oh, yes. I have missed you too.

723
00:53:46,988 --> 00:53:49,456
Listen, Larry.
We have a picnic.

724
00:53:49,524 --> 00:53:52,789
Some bread and wine and cheese,
and I thought we could all...

725
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:55,796
No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I'm working against a deadline.

726
00:53:55,864 --> 00:53:59,459
This mural's for Neiman Marcus.
That's a department store in Texas.

727
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:02,401
150 thou!

728
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,735
I've got to get it rolled up
and on a jet by tomorrow.

729
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:10,577
What are you doing up there?

730
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:14,137
Aaargh! Oh, I never should have had
these damn things made in Paris!

731
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:20,420
What are you doing? Where are you going?
Get back in line here!

732
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:22,922
Stop that now!

733
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:25,755
- I'm terribly sorry, Rene. I'm sorry.
- Stop that!

734
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,920
Get back there!
Get back there!

735
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:31,727
Larry! Larry, what is the matter with you?
What is the matter?

736
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,167
- Get back there!
- Larry, why can't it be
the way it used to be?

737
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:38,535
Larry, I never dreamed this could happen!

738
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:40,541
What is the matter with you, Larry?

739
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:44,045
What is the matter with you?

740
00:54:48,283 --> 00:54:50,251
- Larry!
- Rene, let's go.

741
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:31,786
150 thou! Ohhh!

742
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,589
What the...

743
00:55:33,662 --> 00:55:36,062
Aaaah!

744
00:55:57,686 --> 00:56:00,450
- En Anglais, s'il vous plait.
- Pardon, madame.

745
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:02,956
"I, Larry Flint, bequeath all my... "

746
00:56:03,024 --> 00:56:05,390
What Larry Flint had left me in cash...

747
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,451
plus the sale
of his remaining pictures...

748
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:11,226
brought me in the neighborhood
of $4 million in American money.

749
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:14,904
It was an amount even Picasso
wouldn't be ashamed of.

750
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:18,837
After several months
of trying to lose myself in Paris...

751
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,842
I decided to leave.

752
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,310
Oh!

753
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,858
I was here an hour early
and you kept me sitting in that lounge...

754
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:40,418
and everyone said, "Well, don't worry.
You'll hear the announcement."

755
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:44,592
We phoned for them to hold up for you,
but I guess they didn't get the message,
madame.

756
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,601
Believe me...
Believe me, it's just...

757
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,933
All my luggage is on that plane!

758
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:51,598
Oh, I had my heart set
on getting out of here tonight.

759
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:07,914
- But I can't possibly stay
in Paris for another day.
- Madame...

760
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,357
- You missed the last trolley back to town?
- Oh, Mr. Anderson.

761
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,361
Should I have that plane brought back?

762
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:16,296
- No, no. I'll take it from here.
- Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

763
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:19,664
Excuse me, Mr. Anderson.
Overseas call, sir. San Francisco.

764
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:22,966
Okay. Excuse me.
Hello? Uh-huh.

765
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,098
I recognized him immediately...

766
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:28,507
unbalding, glamorous
Rod Anderson, Jr...

767
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:31,011
millionaire tycoon, up from riches...

768
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,141
inheriting 10 million from
senior Anderson's maple syrup empire.

769
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:38,414
Unmarried, he seemed to have no trouble
in getting what he wanted...

770
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:42,116
- in business or in pleasure.
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Buy it. Thank you.

771
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:44,489
Well, Mrs. Flint,
where would you like to go?

772
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,791
I was sorry to read of your loss. I saw you
at one of your late husband's openings.

773
00:57:47,863 --> 00:57:50,696
I didn't buy anything, though.
I don't like his paintings.

774
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:53,997
Well, I don't like your airplanes.
Where are you going?

775
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,062
New York, Miami, Irkutsk...
anyplace you'd like to go.

776
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:59,505
I just flew in from New York
this evening for some party.

777
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:02,567
I stayed about a half an hour,
and I'd had it. I don't like parties.

778
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,637
So, you just put on your
Superman suit and fly away home.

779
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:10,277
That's right. And there it is...
or don't you accept hitches
from strange men?

780
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:12,820
Oh, I know who you are, Mr. Anderson.

781
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:14,822
I just don't know
if I'll be very good company.

782
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,358
I just got...
I don't have much small talk.

783
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:20,224
- I haven't any time for small talk either.
- Excuse me, Mr. Anderson.

784
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,891
- Overseas call. Hong Kong calling.
- Excuse me. Uh-huh.

785
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:28,699
Yeah. Uh-huh.
All right. Sell it. Thank you.

786
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,934
- Well, where shall it be?
- New York.

787
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:34,635
New York it is.

788
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:44,812
What was I getting into?
What was on that plane?

789
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:48,084
I looked at the name of it.
"Melissa."

790
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,682
Naturally it would be
named after a woman.

791
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,990
I'd heard enough
about those dissolute playboys.

792
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:14,375
What are you doing after the orgy?

793
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,179
The, uh, plane is ready.

794
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:24,522
- Pretty name, "Melissa."
- Someone I knew a long time ago.

795
00:59:43,612 --> 00:59:46,103
- Good evening, Mr. Anderson.
- Good evening, Mark.

796
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:50,778
Mark, this is Mrs. Flint.
She'll be flying back with us.
What sort of weather have we?

797
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,619
- It's clear, sir, all the way
through to New York.
- Excellent.

798
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:04,161
- Good evening, Willard.
- Good evening, Mr. Anderson.

799
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,565
- Willard, this is Mrs. Flint.
- How do you do?

800
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:09,126
- Mrs. Flint will be flying back with us.
- Yes, sir.

801
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,366
Her bags left on the 11:19.

802
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,739
You have them picked up
at Idlewild and delivered to...

803
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,973
- Uh, the Montclair Hotel?
- Is that your favorite?

804
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:22,643
- Well, I've never, uh, been in New York.
Only for a few hours en route.
- Mm-hmm.

805
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:27,018
- You better make that my suite
at the St. Regis, Willard.
- Very good, sir.

806
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:29,421
It's reserved for visiting executives.

807
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:33,086
I camp about 10 blocks
further up the street on Fifth Avenue.

808
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,859
- And Willard, have the chef come 'round
and take Mrs. Flint's order, will you?
- Yes, sir.

809
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:40,026
You have anything you like.
We have some rather fine wines aboard.

810
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:43,333
- I'll, uh, just have my usual.
- Yes, sir.

811
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:46,841
- Whatever you have is all right with me.
- Oh, really?

812
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:52,313
My usual is two soft-boiled eggs,
gluten toast and a glass of yogurt.

813
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:56,818
And Willard, Mrs. Flint will have
the, uh, crème Senegalese, steak Diane...

814
01:00:56,886 --> 01:01:02,290
pomme soufflé, profiteroles
with, uh, chocolate sauce, and
break out a bottle of La Tache.

815
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,758
- Very good, sir.
- And that'll be all, Willard. Thank you.

816
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,354
Now, let's step into the bar.

817
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:11,399
- I'll make you one of
my very special martinis.
- Oh, thank you, no.

818
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,766
I'll have a, uh... a scotch on the "rotch."

819
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:18,534
- Uh, on the rocks.
- Oh. Very well.

820
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:22,872
I was raised on maple syrup,
you know.

821
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,913
Cured me of drinking anything at all.

822
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,144
- Oh. Well, then I won't have...
- No, no, no. You go right ahead.
Drink up. It's good for you.

823
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:35,019
Telephone.
Watkins in Chicago.

824
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,081
Excuse me.

825
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,903
You know,
you really are rather beautiful...

826
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,806
but, uh, is that your hair?

827
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,901
Yeah. Hello.

828
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:59,914
Okay. You just sit tight. No, no.
I think Prescott's bluffing anyway.

829
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,973
True, there was no orgy on board.

830
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,020
- He wasn't
the Diamond Jim Brady of the jet set.

831
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:09,285
But he was arrogant, cold,
sure of himself, ordering people around...

832
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,761
another object lesson in what money
and power can do to a human being.

833
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:17,822
But for all of it, he really seemed
to be a miserable and lonely man.

834
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,770
Why he never even smiled. Not once
had a smile lit that stoney, sunless face.

835
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,535
- Well, a tycoon's work
is never finished, is it?

836
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,476
- That's what you call yourself,
isn't it? A tycoon?
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

837
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:35,347
Every morning I get up
and look at myself in the mirror,
and I say, "Good morning, tycoon."

838
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,977
I, uh... I know you don't approve of me,
Mrs. Flint...

839
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:40,817
but that need be of no concern
to either one of us.

840
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:43,551
I'm going into my office now.
I've got some work to do.

841
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:49,495
I promise not to interrupt by
calling out points of passing interest
or the weather conditions over Baffin Bay.

842
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:53,057
I'll see you in New York,
and don't forget to fasten your seat belt.

843
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,570
What was wrong with my hat anyway?

844
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:08,479
- Okay, Mark. I'll take her.
- Okay, sir.

845
01:03:09,718 --> 01:03:12,016
I wondered who Melissa was.

846
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:15,523
Some forgotten Hollywood starlet,
no doubt.

847
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:26,391
I was scared.
I hated being alone during the takeoff.

848
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:24,385
It was so beautiful looking down...

849
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,362
the lights, the sky, the stars.

850
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:32,227
How I wished I had
someone to share it with...

851
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:37,170
not this unsmiling,
airborne cigar-store Indian.

852
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,674
Then, the fatal thing happened.

853
01:04:46,448 --> 01:04:50,077
I'm glad you decided to join me.

854
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:53,144
Nice to have someone
to share it with, isn't it?

855
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,724
Beautiful.

856
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:01,752
Excuse me, sir.
Telephone. Zurich.

857
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:06,062
Willard, tell the gentleman
I just stepped out.

858
01:05:20,282 --> 01:05:22,944
I never did get to the St. Regis.

859
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:26,545
We were married in New York
in his fabulous penthouse.

860
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,099
Thank you, Timothy.

861
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,105
Hello.

862
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:48,439
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

863
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:51,445
Okay.

864
01:05:51,513 --> 01:05:54,004
I felt so safe at last.

865
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:58,416
Rod had all the wealth and success
he wanted long before he met me.

866
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,854
I felt I couldn't possibly jinx his life.

867
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,724
- Uh-huh.
As for the mysterious Melissa...

868
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:09,320
I decided never
to question him about it.

869
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,889
I dismissed it from my life.

870
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,237
A little trinket from Harry Winston's.

871
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,837
As I look back on it now,
our life together was like...

872
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:30,545
one of those glamorous
Hollywood movies all about love
and what'll she wear next.

873
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,709
Remind me to tell you later
that I love you.

874
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:11,123
I'll remind you
if you'll remind me.

875
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,544
- Louisa!
- Hello, Doris.

876
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:41,639
- Now, Louisa, you look divine.
- Oh, Chester, thank you.

877
01:08:46,054 --> 01:08:49,956
- You remember Peter, don't you, darling?
- Oh, but of course.

878
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:55,857
We met at El Morocco the other evening.

879
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:59,059
- You play beautifully.
So nice of you to come.
- Thank you.

880
01:08:59,134 --> 01:09:02,831
- That's a beautiful dress.
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

881
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:08,672
It's my favorite...
my very own favorite.

882
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,678
I wanna talk to you.

883
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:13,476
- What is it, dear?
- You remind me to tell you later...

884
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:15,743
that I love you.

885
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:18,445
- Rod!
- Nicky!

886
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,847
Louisa!

887
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:28,658
Louisa, darling, here is someone
you simply must meet.

888
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:40,007
- Darling, now you know Nicky Cathcart...
- Wonderful to meet you.

889
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,009
- Mrs. Cathcart.
- How do you do?

890
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,342
- Louisa.
- I do hope the two of you
can come down to us for a shoot.

891
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:48,905
Mmm! Love to.
We always get a bang out of a shoot.

892
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,679
Remind me...
to tell you...

893
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:54,744
that...

894
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:55,847
I...

895
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:57,255
love...

896
01:09:57,325 --> 01:09:59,316
you.

897
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:19,410
I'll remind you just as soon
as I change my nightgown.

898
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,781
Lord Kensington,
Lady Kensington...

899
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,793
may I present my wife, Louisa?

900
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,795
- How do you do?
- So nice.

901
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,797
- Delighted.
- How do you do?

902
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,356
We're so happy
you could fly in for the evening.

903
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:44,133
- I hope the two of you can come
down to the abbey this weekend.
- Oh, we'd love to.

904
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:47,141
Oh, but darling,
I haven't a thing to wear.

905
01:10:50,745 --> 01:10:55,944
- I'm reminding you to remind me
to tell you that I love you.
- Thank you for reminding me.

906
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:59,077
I'm reminding you...

907
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:02,885
that you said to
remind me to tell me
that you love me.

908
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,688
Thank you for reminding me.

909
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,921
Thank you.

910
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,600
- I love you.
- I love you.

911
01:11:56,077 --> 01:12:00,070
- Why didn't he tell me before?
- Hello, darling. I'm sorry I'm late.

912
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:03,242
Well you tell him that he's through.
This is total disaster.

913
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:05,809
How could it possibly happen to me?

914
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,980
- What happened?
- Louisa...

915
01:12:08,056 --> 01:12:10,547
ever since we got married,
I've been neglecting my business.

916
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:15,324
I've been so much in love with you
that I've paid no attention to it at all.
I've let it slide.

917
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:20,630
- Well, I've just been reading
these business reports.
- Are you faced with ruin?

918
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:24,160
I am three times as rich
as I was the day we got married.

919
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,173
Oh, no!

920
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:30,177
Nobody triples the business
of Anderson Enterprises but Rod Anderson.

921
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,543
Someone has been giving orders...

922
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,549
somewhere,
somebody in my organization.

923
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,551
Why, that's absolute treachery.

924
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:41,020
Someone's been giving orders
behind my back! Imagine that?

925
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:43,922
If I wanna lose a fortune,
I'll lose a fortune.

926
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:48,452
If I wanna triple it, I'll triple it...
no one else.

927
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,090
I'm gonna get to every one
of my offices all over the world...

928
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,192
and I'm gonna find out
who's been running things behind my back.

929
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:58,569
Triple it? How could he possibly triple it?
Who can the guy be?

930
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,599
You spend years training employees,
executives, to serve you faithfully...

931
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:06,204
and they stab you behind the back?

932
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,876
That's loyalty for you.
Willard?

933
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:14,081
Willard, you make arrangements
for trips to, uh, Sidney, Johannesburg...

934
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:16,089
Hong Kong and Bombay.

935
01:13:16,157 --> 01:13:19,684
I'm looking for somebody,
and I'm not coming back until I find them.

936
01:13:19,761 --> 01:13:22,161
I knew there was no man to look for.

937
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,391
It was only me
and my witch's curse.

938
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:29,900
Sleep was impossible. Next morning,
Rod would go out of my life forever...

939
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,439
and meet his doom somewhere.

940
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:36,671
I was terrified.
I tried to think of a way to save him.

941
01:13:46,087 --> 01:13:50,387
"Melissa.
Happy days on his uncle's farm."

942
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:53,894
The simple life.

943
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:10,309
- Moo.
- Hmm?

944
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:13,506
Moo.

945
01:14:13,581 --> 01:14:16,072
Melissa?

946
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:21,282
Melissa.
Mmm.

947
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:32,529
We had a simple, modest little farm...

948
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,797
two dozen leghorns for me to look after...

949
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:40,671
And a cow named Melissa...
Melissa I... and a bull named Melrose.

950
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,836
Well, Ma, how do I look?

951
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,846
The neighbors all say I look real fine.

952
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:48,815
Wonderful, Pa. Real elegant.

953
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:51,875
Have one more nip of our local cider.

954
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:55,616
Well, it's my fourth,
and I'm not a drinkin' man,
but seein' as how it's welcomin' day...

955
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,521
- here's to ya.
- Hey, thank ya.

956
01:14:57,592 --> 01:15:01,187
Good day, Mr. Anderson.
Good day, Mrs. Anderson.

957
01:15:01,262 --> 01:15:03,696
- Have another drink.
- No, I'm drivin'.

958
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:10,032
- We'll see you, Rod.
- Come on. Get him up.

959
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,972
- Come on. Let's get him to the wagon.
- Come on. Let's go.

960
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,975
No more.

961
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:23,073
I'm sure glad I listened to you.

962
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,210
This is our first day here,
and already...

963
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:28,312
- I realize that this is what
I always wanted to come back to.

964
01:15:28,389 --> 01:15:32,325
And you made me do it.

965
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:35,021
Uh-oh. Feedin' time.

966
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:39,157
I'll go feed Melissa,
and you milk the chickens, huh?

967
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:43,068
- I've been waitin' a lot of years for that.
- Can't it wait till tomorrow?

968
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:46,335
That shows how much you know
about farmin'. You don't milk her now,
and she'll be...

969
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:48,705
Mooin' all night long.

970
01:15:48,776 --> 01:15:50,767
Let's go.

971
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:05,720
Hello, Melissa, baby.

972
01:16:05,793 --> 01:16:07,727
Oh, sw...

973
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:12,231
How're you doing, honey?

974
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,632
Just great, honey.

975
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:17,933
'Atsa girl, Melissa, baby.
Mmm.

976
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:24,969
Whoa, baby. Whoa, Melissa.
That's a girl.

977
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,276
Melrose!

978
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,284
Forgive me!

979
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:52,965
"And all the rest of my holdings,
cash and securities... "

980
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,975
Several months after the funeral...

981
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,978
I had to listen
to the grim business details.

982
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:02,415
Rod had sold out everything so quickly
that his fortune was pitifully reduced.

983
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:05,179
It came to a mere $ 150 million.

984
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:10,782
I felt alone and lost,
and I was determined to live
alone for the rest of my life.

985
01:17:10,858 --> 01:17:14,851
It was the only fair thing to do.

986
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:40,711
Isn't there any way
of getting a cup of coffee here?

987
01:17:40,788 --> 01:17:44,417
<i> Isn't there any way
of gettin' a cup of coffee here <i>

988
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:46,153
What's your name, Miss?

989
01:17:46,227 --> 01:17:48,695
Uh, Louisa May Hop...

990
01:17:48,763 --> 01:17:50,697
Hop...

991
01:17:50,765 --> 01:17:54,861
Hop... Fli... Anderson.

992
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,928
<i> Isn't there any way
of gettin' a cup of coffee here <i>

993
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:02,033
<i>Asked Louisa May
Hop-Hop-Hop-Fli-Anderson <i>

994
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,739
<i> Pretty eyes, pretty hair
And she asked so clear <i>

995
01:18:05,813 --> 01:18:09,806
<i> Isn't there any way
of gettin' a cup of coffee here <i><i>

996
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:17,484
Uh, Louisa May
Hop-Hop-Hop-Fli-Anderson, huh?

997
01:18:17,558 --> 01:18:19,685
That's a funny name.

998
01:18:21,262 --> 01:18:23,958
It's just Anderson.

999
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:28,059
Uh, please stay, Miss Anderson.

1000
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,627
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

1001
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:34,038
Clancy must... must be out back somewhere.
I'm in here all the time.

1002
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:37,043
Say, uh...

1003
01:18:37,111 --> 01:18:39,443
I, uh... I hope you didn't think
I was being fresh.

1004
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,641
That's just part of my act, you know.

1005
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:44,207
I get a list of the customers' names
each night before the show...

1006
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:47,448
and then I make up little rhymes
using all their names.

1007
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:50,320
It's one my specialties,
that ad-lib stuff.

1008
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:52,325
Coffee?

1009
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:54,327
Sugar?

1010
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:58,559
Danish?
Serve the Danish.

1011
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,431
And for a big finale, a napkin.

1012
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:04,130
There's our Pinky.
Always at it.

1013
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:06,230
Pinky, ain't you ever off the floor?

1014
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:08,366
Why, it's Herman Bodkin, I do declare...

1015
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,968
and Ernie Wilkens
who's with him there.

1016
01:19:11,045 --> 01:19:14,208
I said with a grin,
"Ernie, your hair is gettin' thin,"

1017
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:17,809
and Ernie answered,
"Who wants fat hair?"

1018
01:19:19,854 --> 01:19:24,154
- Ah, it's true.
I, uh, never seem to stop being on.

1019
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:27,092
Oh, I liked it.

1020
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:29,561
You performing around here?

1021
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:33,191
Am I performing around here?

1022
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,395
Look.

1023
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,840
That's me... Pinky Benson.

1024
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:44,002
- Can I get you anything else?
- Mm-mm.

1025
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:46,979
- It's on me.
- No, thank you.

1026
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,983
- What's doin'?
- I got it, Clance.

1027
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,451
Thank you.

1028
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,456
Say, uh, if you're not busy later,
would you like to watch my act?

1029
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:00,089
I hadn't decided what to do later.

1030
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:04,120
I even thought of staying in this town
for a few days till I made up my mind.

1031
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:06,428
Well?

1032
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:12,528
Well, uh...

1033
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:15,006
- Well, sure. I'll come.
- Good.

1034
01:20:15,075 --> 01:20:17,566
Um, I gotta kinda rush
over there right now.

1035
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:21,206
It takes me two hours for my props
and to put on my costume and makeup.

1036
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:23,910
Oh. Really?
How's it going?

1037
01:20:23,984 --> 01:20:28,717
Well, the management must love me.
I've been playing there for 14 years.

1038
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:33,126
See you later.

1039
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:41,197
- Who ordered the well-done,
green peas, succotash?

1040
01:20:41,268 --> 01:20:43,702
- Here. Over here.
- Medium-well.

1041
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:46,399
- Side of spinach.
- Hey. I ordered the creamed spinach.

1042
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:51,571
Ah, that's better for you. No cholesterol.
Mashed potatoes, well-done.

1043
01:20:51,645 --> 01:20:55,979
- One rare, hashed brown!
- I ordered French fries. Take it back!

1044
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,610
- Ah, you always make such a fuss.
- Ah, shut up!

1045
01:20:58,686 --> 01:21:04,454
I agree. But stuff yourself, honey.
No man wants a fistful of bones.

1046
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:09,792
- Okay! Okay! Here he is...
for your dinner pleasure...

1047
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:14,892
Jersey City's own uh-Pinky uh-Benson!

1048
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,605
Well, good evening, friends and neighbors.

1049
01:21:23,677 --> 01:21:27,613
- Hey, who do we have here
with us tonight? The Shimkins.

1050
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:32,778
Rosie Shimkin
was able to get a ringside table.
She's wearing a rose in her hat.

1051
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:36,414
- And with her is her husband,
Matt. And that is that.

1052
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:39,926
Dennis Horner is sittin'over there
in the corner. Hiya, Dennis!

1053
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:43,020
And Peggy Norton...
Peggy Norton and her sister Min.

1054
01:21:43,097 --> 01:21:46,396
Chewin' on those bones like Rin Tin Tin.

1055
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:49,334
So, welcome, all!
Welcome, one.

1056
01:21:49,403 --> 01:21:52,531
Lend an ear and have some fun.

1057
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:57,976
- <i> I think that you and I
should get acquainted <i>

1058
01:21:58,045 --> 01:22:01,776
- <i> I'll just come up to you
and ask your name <i>
- What I say is live...

1059
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:05,649
- <i> I'll tell you mine, and I'll say,
Isn't the weather fine <i>
- and leave me alone.

1060
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:10,213
<i>And aren't you really glad
so glad that you came <i>

1061
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:14,352
<i>Then after you and I
become acquainted <i>

1062
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:18,421
<i> I'll ask you
if you'd like to stay a while <i>

1063
01:22:18,499 --> 01:22:22,265
<i>You'll say you would
You'll give me a smile <i>

1064
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:26,636
<i> Oh, goody-good
You'll make my evenin' worthwhile <i>

1065
01:22:26,707 --> 01:22:30,643
<i> Before our little rendezvous ends <i>

1066
01:22:30,711 --> 01:22:34,203
<i>We won't just be acquainted <i>

1067
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:38,308
<i>We'll be
the very very best of friends <i><i>

1068
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:04,041
- I could see
why the management loved him.

1069
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:09,048
He didn't interfere one bit
with the sale of food and liquor.

1070
01:23:38,078 --> 01:23:41,309
It was the worst act I'd ever seen.

1071
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:43,907
Just looking at Pinky
made me want to cry.

1072
01:23:43,984 --> 01:23:46,214
But he was so happy and untroubled.

1073
01:23:46,286 --> 01:23:49,016
And I feel at home here,
as you can see.

1074
01:23:49,089 --> 01:23:53,048
And in all the 14 years,
you've never wanted to play anywhere else?

1075
01:23:53,127 --> 01:23:55,891
- Oh, you mean, uh, the big time?
- Mm-hmm.

1076
01:23:55,963 --> 01:24:00,366
Boy, why does everybody seem to think
you have to wanna play the big time?

1077
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:02,868
Why?
You get to the top of the ladder...

1078
01:24:02,936 --> 01:24:05,734
you're a slave to your fans,
you got no life of your own.

1079
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:09,708
Then you gotta start worryin' about
staying up there. Oh, no. Not for me.

1080
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:12,109
I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

1081
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:15,148
And you know what?
I teach dancing to kids in the daytime.

1082
01:24:15,215 --> 01:24:18,981
- That's nice.
- Yeah. My, uh... My wife
wanted me to get ahead.

1083
01:24:19,053 --> 01:24:23,319
She wanted me to get an agent, press agent,
publicity, audition, push, push, push.

1084
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:26,757
- Your wife?
- Yeah. I was married once.
We were... We were a team.

1085
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:29,523
She always wanted to be way up there,
so I let her go.

1086
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:33,623
- And today
that woman is Greta Garbo.

1087
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:38,400
Nah. She married a guy with a lotta dough
and she left the business.

1088
01:24:38,472 --> 01:24:41,100
I don't blame her.

1089
01:24:41,175 --> 01:24:43,370
I don't blame her at all.

1090
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:48,775
I was just a guy who wanted
the simple kinda life.

1091
01:24:51,251 --> 01:24:53,185
<i>And that's the story of my life <i>

1092
01:24:53,253 --> 01:24:56,780
<i>As told to Louisa May Hop-Hop-Hop <i>

1093
01:24:56,857 --> 01:24:59,257
<i> Hop-Fli-Anderson
Boom Boom, Be-Doom Be-Doom <i><i>

1094
01:25:01,628 --> 01:25:04,859
Oh.

1095
01:25:21,048 --> 01:25:25,348
Louisa May Hop-Fli-Anderson Benson.

1096
01:25:25,419 --> 01:25:27,785
Yes. We were married...
happily married.

1097
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:31,120
And we lived on our lovely houseboat
on the Hudson.

1098
01:25:31,191 --> 01:25:33,853
I told him I had a great deal
of money somewhere...

1099
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:35,895
but both of us
forgot all about it.

1100
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:39,126
Ho! <i> Good mornin', Mrs. Benson
Good mornin' to you <i>

1101
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,827
<i> Good mornin', Mrs. Benson
How do you do <i>

1102
01:25:41,902 --> 01:25:44,871
<i> I'll give you just one kiss
Then I'll stop <i>

1103
01:25:44,938 --> 01:25:48,271
<i> 'Cause I gotta give our little boat
a mop, mop, mop <i><i>

1104
01:25:53,614 --> 01:25:56,276
As I look back on it now...

1105
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:59,183
our life together
was like a gay musical number...

1106
01:25:59,253 --> 01:26:02,188
from one of those big,
Hollywood movie musicals.

1107
01:26:02,256 --> 01:26:06,352
<i> On our little houseboat <i>

1108
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:11,955
<i> Built for two <i>

1109
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:16,992
<i>Tiny little houseboat <i>

1110
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:21,006
<i>Just for me <i>

1111

01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:41,189
<i>All alone together <i>

1113
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:45,129

01:27:14,661 --> 01:27:16,595

1123
01:28:20,527 --> 01:28:24,088
<i>All alone together <i>

and tars and spars, Louisa <i>

1138
01:30:23,784 --> 01:30:27,413
<i> For us you are the captain
and the crew <i>

1139
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:42,266
<i> Oh, how we love Louisa <i>

1140
01:30:42,335 --> 01:30:48,296
<i> She's sent from heaven up above <i>

1141
01:30:49,376 --> 01:30:52,834
<i>Just like the tower of Pisa <i>

1142
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:55,848
<i>There's only one Louisa <i>

1143
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:59,613
<i> L-O <i>

1144
01:30:59,686 --> 01:31:03,122
<i>V-E <i>

1145
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:08,355
<i> Love <i><i>

1146
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:19,129
Love.

1147
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:22,402
Then it began to happen.

1148
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:26,640
We were planning a birthday party
for Pinky after the last show.

1149
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:29,682
Well, I guess we got everything:
The hot dogs, the rolls, and...

1150
01:31:29,749 --> 01:31:32,718
- Hey! Look at the clock.
I gotta get made up.
- Oh, you've got time.

1151
01:31:32,786 --> 01:31:35,220
No. I don't.
I have less than two hours.

1152
01:31:35,288 --> 01:31:39,088
It takes you two hours
to get out of that makeup.
You'll be late for your party.

1153
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:42,617
- Couldn't you just skip it?
- Skip the performance?

1154
01:31:42,696 --> 01:31:45,665
No. Skip the makeup, I mean.
Do it just as you are.

1155
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:47,791
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
The makeup's the whole act.

1156
01:31:47,868 --> 01:31:50,063
- Here's the bucket of lemonade, Pinky.
- Thank you.

1157
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:54,233
Thank you.
Mr. Trentino, because of the party...

1158
01:31:54,307 --> 01:31:58,539
would it be all right if... if Pinky went on
tonight without putting on all his stuff?

1159
01:31:58,612 --> 01:32:02,275
Sure! You don't wanna miss
your own birthday party.

1160
01:32:02,349 --> 01:32:04,977
- Okay, honey?
- Oh, uh...

1161
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:07,747
I'll feel... I'll feel naked. I...

1162
01:32:07,821 --> 01:32:10,483
Well, leave out the verses too.

1163
01:32:10,557 --> 01:32:13,219
Leave out the verses?

1164
01:32:13,293 --> 01:32:15,227
Just this once.

1165
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:21,628
Well, all right,
on account of the party, but...

1166
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:24,033
I feel funny. I...

1167
01:32:24,104 --> 01:32:26,834
I'm gonna lay an awful egg.

1168
01:32:26,907 --> 01:32:28,841
- And now for your enjoyment...
- Who ordered the well-done...

1169
01:32:28,909 --> 01:32:31,901
- New Jersey's own ha-ha boy...
- green peas, succotash?

1170
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:34,469
- Uh-Pinky uh-Benson!
- Let's get outta here.

1171
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:37,540
Waiter, check!

1172
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:44,218
Well, I...

1173
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:46,521
- Frankie dropped him
in the second...

1174
01:32:46,593 --> 01:32:48,891
- because I said, "Hey... "
- It was the fifth.

1175
01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:51,795
- I was there.
- Mr. Trentino, may we have some relish?

1176
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:53,799
Sure. Help yourself.

1177
01:32:53,867 --> 01:32:57,564
- One rare, hashed brown.
- I ordered French fries!

1178
01:33:02,509 --> 01:33:07,640
- <i> I think that you and I
should get acquainted <i>
- Who ordered the well-done?

1179
01:33:07,714 --> 01:33:12,174
<i> I'll just come up to you
and ask your name <i>

1180
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:17,383
<i> I'll tell you mine,
I'll say isn't the weather fine <i>

1181
01:33:17,457 --> 01:33:22,918
- <i>And aren't you really glad
so glad that you came <i>

1182
01:33:22,996 --> 01:33:28,332
- <i>Then after you and I
become acquainted <i>

1183
01:33:28,401 --> 01:33:30,892
<i> I'll ask you if you'd like to stay <i>

1184
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:33,599
- <i>A while <i>
- Hey, doc.

1185
01:33:33,673 --> 01:33:35,971
- Who do you got... Sh!
- <i>You'll say you would <i>

1186
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:37,976
<i>You'll give me a smile <i>

1187
01:33:38,044 --> 01:33:43,744
<i>Aw, goody-good
You'll make my evenin' worthwhile <i>

1188
01:33:43,817 --> 01:33:48,982
<i>And before our little rendezvous ends <i>

1189
01:33:49,055 --> 01:33:53,617
<i>We won't be just acquainted <i>

1190
01:33:53,693 --> 01:33:58,790
<i>We'll be the very very best of friends <i><i>

1191
01:35:01,593 --> 01:35:03,686
Bravo! Bravo!

1192
01:35:05,464 --> 01:35:07,455
Bravo!

1193
01:35:30,956 --> 01:35:35,188
<i> I think that you and I
should get acquainted <i><i>

1194
01:35:37,963 --> 01:35:39,931
I've grown accustomed to this place.

1195
01:35:47,139 --> 01:35:49,767
What! Caesar!

1196
01:35:49,842 --> 01:35:52,140
- Cut. Print.
- Magnificent, Pinky.

1197
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:55,840
- Wonderful, Pinky.
- Magnificent.
I'll never direct a better actor.

1198
01:35:55,914 --> 01:36:00,044
- And to think they wanted to
put that Welshman in the part.

1199
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:09,387
Well, I was still near water...

1200
01:36:09,461 --> 01:36:12,589
sitting by our beautiful
Hollywood pool alone.

1201
01:36:12,664 --> 01:36:15,292
I had done it again,
and I had lost Pinky...

1202
01:36:15,367 --> 01:36:19,428
lost him to fame, fortune, his agents,
publicity men, secretaries...

1203
01:36:19,505 --> 01:36:21,564
and his adoring fans.

1204
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,541
How about my preview
in Westwood last night, huh?

1205
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:26,942
- What a gas.
- Sure was, Pinky.

1206
01:36:27,012 --> 01:36:31,244
All those Pinky Benson fans
screaming, yelling, crying...

1207
01:36:31,316 --> 01:36:35,753
Ah-ha. The little people.
I love 'em. I love 'em.

1208
01:36:35,821 --> 01:36:38,381
And if the studio
tries to cut one minute of that film...

1209
01:36:38,457 --> 01:36:41,654
I'm gonna burn that nuthouse
to the ground.

1210
01:36:41,727 --> 01:36:45,254
Five and a half hours is not too long
for a Pinky Benson fan.

1211
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,298
Yes, Mr. Benson.

1212
01:36:47,366 --> 01:36:51,234
Now, about the premiere.
Everybody on the ball. See?

1213
01:36:53,005 --> 01:36:54,939
Hi, Louisa.

1214
01:36:55,007 --> 01:36:58,340
Hi, Pinky.
Going in for a dip?

1215
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:00,401
No. I'm goin' to Brown Derby.

1216
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:02,504
I got a business luncheon
with these creeps.

1217
01:37:02,581 --> 01:37:05,573
- Ciao, baby.
- Ain't you gonna change?

1218
01:37:05,651 --> 01:37:09,212
- What for?
- You know you can't get
in the Derby without a tie on.

1219
01:37:09,288 --> 01:37:12,086
Geez.

1220
01:37:12,157 --> 01:37:15,615
And Pinky, after lunch you gotta
tape a speech to send to Jersey City.

1221
01:37:15,694 --> 01:37:18,720
- Yeah, you told me. What's it for?
- Pinky Benson Day.

1222
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:20,788
Big ceremony in your honor.

1223
01:37:20,866 --> 01:37:25,633
Citizens are getting together
to paint the front of the house
you were born in in pink.

1224
01:37:25,704 --> 01:37:27,968
Yeah?

1225
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,532
Gee. That's kinda sweet.

1226
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:36,377
- I wonder who thought o' that?
- I did.

1227
01:37:36,448 --> 01:37:40,179
Yeah? Well, here's an idea from me.
What's the matter with this place?

1228
01:37:40,252 --> 01:37:42,846
The fans in the busses
go by here every afternoon.

1229
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:46,357
Let's let 'em know without a doubt
which house is Pinky's house!

1230
01:38:39,111 --> 01:38:42,171
Yes. Yes, it is! Pinky Benson.

1231
01:38:42,247 --> 01:38:45,705
He's arriving in his famous,
all-pink Rolls-Royce.

1232
01:38:45,784 --> 01:38:48,082
Oh, I've never seen anything like this.

1233
01:38:48,153 --> 01:38:51,919
I've covered the biggest
of all premieres: Ben-Hur, Cleopatra.

1234
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:55,551
But this, Flaming Lips...
this is the biggest of them all.

1235
01:38:55,627 --> 01:38:58,528
All the greats in show business
are here tonight...

1236
01:38:58,597 --> 01:39:00,792
the great
and the near-great...

1237
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:03,426
and all the little people...

1238
01:39:03,502 --> 01:39:06,938
Awaiting the premiere
of Flaming Lips.

1239
01:39:07,005 --> 01:39:12,966
Mrs. Pinky Benson seems to be wearing
a pink... all-pink chinchilla coat.

1240
01:39:13,045 --> 01:39:16,811
Now he's introducing
Mrs. Pinky Benson to the crowd.

1241
01:39:16,882 --> 01:39:19,373
Oh, this is fabulous.

1242
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:28,521
The crowd is roaring so much. I hope
you can hear me, ladies and gentlemen.

1243
01:39:28,594 --> 01:39:30,585
I have never seen
a premiere like this.

1244
01:39:30,662 --> 01:39:33,153
And now they're going
into the theater, as Pinky Benson...

1245
01:39:33,231 --> 01:39:35,631
Tonight, in Flaming Lips,
Pinky Benson proved...

1246
01:39:35,701 --> 01:39:38,898
that a comedy
can run five and a half hours.

1247
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:43,237
Earlier today, Pinky told us his next film
will run seven and a half hours.

1248
01:39:43,308 --> 01:39:45,606
- Listen to that applause!
- Oh, Pinky, baby, you were right.

1249
01:39:45,677 --> 01:39:48,373
- This is a gas!
- This is the greatest thing
you've ever done.

1250
01:39:48,447 --> 01:39:51,143
I don't ever want to direct
another actor for the rest of my life.

1251
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:54,811
Thank you, pal. Let's get rid of that creep.
I'll direct the next one myself.

1252
01:39:54,886 --> 01:39:57,878
This picture is a cinch to do 50 million
at the box office.

1253
01:39:57,956 --> 01:39:59,981
- Yeah. Too bad I only get half of that.
- Yeah.

1254
01:40:00,058 --> 01:40:03,152
And the studio wants you to co-star
with Frank, Marlon and Cary...

1255
01:40:03,228 --> 01:40:05,696
- in a remake of The Four Horsemen.
- Well!

1256
01:40:05,764 --> 01:40:09,666
- Why should I carry those deadweights?
I'll play all four.
- We want Pinky!

1257
01:40:09,735 --> 01:40:12,363
- And he can do it too.
- Let's get out of here. The mob is coming.

1258
01:40:12,437 --> 01:40:17,033
- Break it up. Break it up.
Everybody outta the way.
- We want Pinky! We want Pinky!

1259
01:40:17,109 --> 01:40:20,010
Mr. Benson, you was divine!

1260
01:40:20,078 --> 01:40:24,879
- Just divine!
- And now, coming to our cameras,
the co-star of Flaming Lips...

1261
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:28,477
Miss Linda Putty...
another Pinky Benson discovery.

1262
01:40:28,553 --> 01:40:32,922
Making new discoveries
is the basis of our industry.

1263
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:34,925
And now,
coming to our microphone...

1264
01:40:34,993 --> 01:40:40,090
here she is, Mrs. Pinky Benson.

1265
01:40:40,165 --> 01:40:42,895
My wife has always been my inspiration.

1266
01:40:42,968 --> 01:40:44,959
Pinky, we'll never get out
the front way.

1267
01:40:45,037 --> 01:40:48,632
- Why don't you just slip out
the side way, darling?
- Yes. I guess so. But I...

1268
01:40:48,707 --> 01:40:50,641
I hate to do this to them.

1269
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:52,904
After all, I'm what they came to see.

1270
01:40:52,978 --> 01:40:56,209
- Yeah. We know. Come on. This way.
- Let's go, Pinky. That's all.

1271
01:40:56,281 --> 01:41:00,047
We want Pinky! We want Pinky!

1272
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:06,079
- The little people.
I love 'em. Love 'em.

1273
01:41:11,229 --> 01:41:13,959
Ah, bless 'em.
I can't let 'em down.

1274
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:17,195
After all, I'm the stuff
their dreams are made of.

1275
01:41:17,269 --> 01:41:19,965
I belong to them.

1276
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:22,802
Hey, fellas. Fellas!

1277
01:41:22,874 --> 01:41:27,402
Look who's here.
It's me. It's your Pinky!

1278
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,778
Look! It's Pinky!

1279
01:41:30,849 --> 01:41:35,548
Pinky! Pinky!

1280
01:42:22,734 --> 01:42:25,999
Ah, yes, Miss Benson.
I know. I know.

1281
01:42:26,071 --> 01:42:29,700
But it's "Willsville Time in Dixie,"
and we've gotta face the facts...

1282
01:42:29,775 --> 01:42:31,709
death wise, that is.

1283
01:42:31,777 --> 01:42:35,679
So I'm gonna give it to you short and sweet.
You get all the moo. All of it.

1284
01:42:35,747 --> 01:42:37,681
But there's one catch.

1285
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:44,453
"And so I order to be built
the Pinky Benson Memorial Museum,
dedicated to my fans...

1286
01:42:44,523 --> 01:42:48,152
"and within it will be preserved
all my dancing shoes dipped in bronze...

1287
01:42:48,226 --> 01:42:50,990
"and a giant gold replica of my larynx.

1288
01:42:51,062 --> 01:42:53,826
"A permanent, pink light
will burn before my statue...

1289
01:42:53,899 --> 01:42:58,927
"and in the 15,000-seat auditorium,
my pictures will run 24 hours a day.

1290
01:42:59,004 --> 01:43:03,532
Everything else I bequeath to my wife,
Louisa May Benson."

1291
01:43:05,143 --> 01:43:06,872
Pinky was right.

1292
01:43:06,945 --> 01:43:09,072
He did belong to his fans...

1293
01:43:09,147 --> 01:43:11,377
forever.

1294
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:14,680
He was such a sweet man
when I met him.

1295
01:43:14,753 --> 01:43:18,382
- And then came...
- Well, that's all.

1296
01:43:18,456 --> 01:43:21,619
Why? Isn't that enough?

1297
01:43:21,693 --> 01:43:23,820
Oh, I was left
with another $30 million...

1298
01:43:23,895 --> 01:43:28,491
and I flew right here to Washington
and that brings us up to date.

1299
01:43:28,567 --> 01:43:32,526
And I'm gonna give that money away.
The government's not gonna stop me either,
and neither are you.

1300
01:43:33,538 --> 01:43:36,166
Please answer my question,
Dr. Steffanson.

1301
01:43:36,241 --> 01:43:39,677
Am I a witch, or am I not?

1302
01:43:42,914 --> 01:43:46,714
Well, you haven't said anything
for the last two husbands.

1303
01:43:50,889 --> 01:43:54,518
- Well, you're not even listening to me.
- Uh, who? Uh, what?

1304
01:43:54,593 --> 01:43:56,925
- Well, you're an analyst!
- Huh?

1305
01:43:56,995 --> 01:43:59,657
- Analyze!
- Oh, that. Yes.

1306
01:43:59,731 --> 01:44:02,256
Uh, now, let me see.
Um, you... you got married...

1307
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:05,235
to four men for love,
mm-hmm?

1308
01:44:05,303 --> 01:44:07,498
All of them were doomed
to success and extinction.

1309
01:44:07,572 --> 01:44:10,598
There was Hopper, Flint,
Anderson and... and Benson.

1310
01:44:10,675 --> 01:44:14,338
And one man... one man you hated.
That was Leonard Crawley.

1311
01:44:14,412 --> 01:44:16,903
Well, that's a very strong emotion, hate.

1312
01:44:16,982 --> 01:44:19,348
Say, you... I think, for...

1313
01:44:19,417 --> 01:44:22,284
Wait a minute. What do you expect of me?
Instant analysis?

1314
01:44:22,354 --> 01:44:25,983
Why-Why your case might take
24 hours a day for the next 50 years.

1315
01:44:26,057 --> 01:44:28,617
In other words, Louisa...

1316
01:44:29,694 --> 01:44:32,788
Would you marry me?

1317
01:44:32,864 --> 01:44:36,527
- Dr. Steffanson...
- If it's simplicity you want,
you should see my apartment.

1318
01:44:36,601 --> 01:44:41,004
I'm a dedicated man of science,
and I'm so tired washing out
my own socks.

1319
01:44:41,072 --> 01:44:43,006
What do you say, Louisa?

1320
01:44:43,074 --> 01:44:49,035
- Victor, I'm honored that
you'd risk your life for me.
- Thank you.

1321
01:44:49,114 --> 01:44:52,606
But it isn't fair.
I simply don't love you.

1322
01:44:52,684 --> 01:44:54,652
No?

1323
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:58,621
But would you mail my check in
for me anyway?

1324
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,885
Oh, please don't feel so bad.

1325
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:03,257
Maybe you helped me after all.

1326
01:45:03,328 --> 01:45:07,196
I said "yes" to four men and I said
"no" to you. Isn't that progress?

1327
01:45:07,265 --> 01:45:09,199
Of a sorts, I guess.

1328
01:45:09,267 --> 01:45:12,566
You see, after listening
to my accumulated life story...

1329
01:45:12,637 --> 01:45:15,401
you naturally assumed
that I'd say "yes."

1330
01:45:15,473 --> 01:45:18,169
But you were wrong.

1331
01:45:18,243 --> 01:45:20,234
- Wrong?
- Yes.

1332
01:45:20,312 --> 01:45:23,042
I was wrong.

1333
01:45:23,114 --> 01:45:27,107
I... I have the strangest...
tingling sensation in my...

1334
01:45:29,387 --> 01:45:31,981
Dr. Stef... Victor, are you all right?

1335
01:45:32,057 --> 01:45:34,150
Wake up, Doctor! Oh, dear.

1336
01:45:34,225 --> 01:45:37,285
How do I get... I've got to... Oh!

1337
01:45:37,362 --> 01:45:40,058
- Oh, please help me.
- Oh, excuse me. I, uh...

1338
01:45:40,131 --> 01:45:43,726
Would you please press that button
and let this thing down?

1339
01:45:43,802 --> 01:45:46,236
Dr. Steffanson.

1340
01:45:58,450 --> 01:46:01,851
Ma'am, I...
What? Louisa?

1341
01:46:02,988 --> 01:46:05,923
- Leonard Crawley!
- Mm.

1342
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:08,425
What happened to the doctor?

1343
01:46:08,493 --> 01:46:11,223
Uh, he fell off.

1344
01:46:11,296 --> 01:46:13,230
Well, he always does.

1345
01:46:13,298 --> 01:46:17,001
Dr. Steffanson.

1346
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:23,162
Doctor? Doctor.

1347
01:46:24,508 --> 01:46:26,976
- Leonard.
- Hmm?

1348
01:46:27,044 --> 01:46:28,978
- You're the custodian here.
- What?

1349
01:46:29,046 --> 01:46:32,072
Now, look, Louisa,
let's call a spade a spade.

1350
01:46:32,149 --> 01:46:35,312
- I'm the janitor here.
- Oh, how awful!

1351
01:46:35,386 --> 01:46:39,720
Oh, no, no, no. I deserved it.
You know... "poetic justice" it's called.

1352
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:43,521
- But in a way, I ruined your life too.
- Oh, no. You made it.

1353
01:46:43,594 --> 01:46:47,894
In fact, you know, when I lost everything,
I just began to live.

1354
01:46:47,965 --> 01:46:50,263
And... And I'll always
be grateful to you...

1355
01:46:50,334 --> 01:46:52,894
and your friend.

1356
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:55,803
- Thoreau!
- Mm-hmm. He said, "Simplify."

1357
01:46:55,873 --> 01:46:58,865
And you can't get much more simpler
than bein' a janitor.

1358
01:47:00,477 --> 01:47:02,411
- Leonard.
- Mm-hmm?

1359
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:05,380
You're the only man in the world
I ever really hated.

1360
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:08,918
Hate's a very strong emotion,
you know?

1361
01:47:08,986 --> 01:47:12,513
But I think the thing
I hated most was that I knew...

1362
01:47:12,589 --> 01:47:15,114
that deep down,
under that small-town emperor...

1363
01:47:15,192 --> 01:47:18,252
there was a human being
that I wanted to know...

1364
01:47:18,328 --> 01:47:20,819
and you wouldn't let come out.

1365
01:47:44,688 --> 01:47:46,622
Leonard, lunch!

1366
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:50,126
- Hey, Mom.
- All right, honey.
Now, you spread these around.

1367
01:47:50,194 --> 01:47:52,685
Jonathan, lunch!

1368
01:47:55,099 --> 01:47:58,068
Hey. Look, Mom.
Look what I caught.

1369
01:47:58,135 --> 01:48:01,127
- Sharks!
- Well. Wonderful.
We'll have these for dinner.

1370
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:03,139
Now, help your brother.

1371
01:48:03,207 --> 01:48:07,200
Geraldine, lunch, honey!

1372
01:48:08,679 --> 01:48:13,844
- Now, don't you drop this.
- What do you think I am, a baby?

1373
01:48:13,917 --> 01:48:18,854
All right. All right. Help is on the way.

1374
01:48:23,994 --> 01:48:26,690
- Here's the chair, Mom.
- Okay.

1375
01:48:26,763 --> 01:48:31,462
- All right, children.
You can start your milk now.
- Aren't we gonna wait for Daddy?

1376
01:48:31,535 --> 01:48:34,698
Nope. Daddy's finishing the plowing
he started this morning.

1377
01:48:39,643 --> 01:48:44,376
- And the princess had
four beautiful children:

1378
01:48:44,448 --> 01:48:50,409
Leonard and Jonathan
and Geraldine and Butch.

1379
01:48:50,487 --> 01:48:54,514
And they all lived happily ever after.

1380
01:49:19,349 --> 01:49:23,410
Louisa!

1381
01:49:23,487 --> 01:49:26,513
It's oil! It's oil!

1382
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:31,254
Louisa! Look! It's oil.
It's oil! Look at it.

1383
01:49:33,263 --> 01:49:36,721
It... can't be happening.
It can't be true.

1384
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,030
It can't be happening!

1385
01:49:39,102 --> 01:49:44,938
But it is, Louisa. It's real.

1386
01:49:45,008 --> 01:49:47,806
Hey! Look at this. It's real! It's oil!

1387
01:49:47,878 --> 01:49:49,812
You bet it's real.
And it's ours!

1388
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,041
- Yours?
- Yes, you idiot! It belongs to us.

1389
01:49:52,115 --> 01:49:54,948
You punched a hole in our pipeline.

1390
01:49:55,018 --> 01:49:57,316
- It's not ours?
- No. It's ours!

1391
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:08,297
My wonderful, wonderful failure.
