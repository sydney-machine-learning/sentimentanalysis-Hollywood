1
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,207
Commissioner Dreyfus.

2
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,835
Ah. Yes, my darling.

3
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,589
I was just about to call you.
I'm on my way.

4
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:04,300
I've got the cheese
and the beaujolais.

5
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,343
What?

6
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:09,180
My love.
Kiss the children for me.

7
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,931
Huh?

8
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,683
Hold on.

9
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,726
Yes?

10
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,561
Your wife is on the other line.

11
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,814
Tell her I'm out of town.

12
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:23,235
Yes, my love.
I'll be with you in 20 minutes.

13
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:36,207
Monsieur Dreyfus. Oh, monsieur.

14
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:38,876
A catastrophe. We've just had
a report of a shooting

15
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:40,795
at the Chateau
de la Pierre Blanche.

16
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:42,254
So?

17
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:45,091
- Monsieur Ballon.
- What, Ballon the millionaire?

18
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,426
- Yes.
- That is a catastrophe.

19
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:50,221
Oh, no. I mean, it's not
so much the shooting

20
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,589
- that is a catastrophe.
- No?

21
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,517
No. You see, when the report
came in, there were few details,

22
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,936
just that someone had been
shot, and the address.

23
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:58,854
I didn't, until a
few moments ago, realize

24
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:01,065
that it was the home of
the millionaire Ballon.

25
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:05,027
- So?
- So I made a terrible mistake.

26
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:09,490
Who did you assign to the case?

27
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,828
- Clouseau.
- Oh, my God.

28
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:24,964
Argh!

29
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:45,025
- Inspector Clouseau.
- Good evening, sir.

30
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,032
- What is your name?
- My name is Henri LaFarge.

31
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,201
Make a note of that.

32
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,288
- You are the butler?
- I am the head butler.

33
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:58,454
The head butler.

34
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:01,041
Cross out "butler"
and put down "head butler".

35
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:10,050
This is Monsieur Ballon.

36
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,469
Monsieur Ballon,
it is a great honor.

37
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:14,889
Oh, excuse me.

38
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:18,726
I am Inspector Clouseau
of the Sûreté.

39
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,146
I must apologize for my appearance.
I had a slight accident.

40
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,025
Well, uh, would you like
a bathrobe or something?

41
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:30,279
Oh, no, nothing at all. It's just
a little dampness. It will soon go.

42
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:34,491
Monsieur Ballon,
you reported a shooting?

43
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,785
- No, I didn't. Maurice did.
- Maurice?

44
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,163
- Yes, he's guarding Maria.
- Ah.

45
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,790
I was at the airport at the time
the shooting occurred.

46
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,666
I've just arrived.

47
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,711
Of course, of course, of course.
That will not be necessary.

48
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,172
I shall have this case
cleared up in a few seconds.

49
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,258
Would you like to
examine the body?

50
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,011
- I would be delighted.
- This way, sir.

51
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:21,538
- You are Maurice?
- Yes, monsieur.

52
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,178
Monsieur Ballon said
you were guarding someone.

53
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:37,596
Yes, monsieur.

54
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,617
This pen has been
fired recently.

55
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,248
- And you are?
- Maria Gambrelli.

56
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,503
- I am Inspector Clouseau.
- How do you do?

57
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,217
See what else you can find.
What are you doing?

58
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:18,470
- I'm checking the gun, Inspector.
- This is my pistol pen.

59
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,348
- I know it's your pen.
- Get your own pistol pen, please.

60
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,434
This is my own personal one.

61
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,233
Don't look in here.
Look outside.

62
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,324
- What did you say?
- Nothing, monsieur.

63
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:40,242
All right, you can go.

64
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,918
Now then.

65
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:55,382
Um...

66
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,594
Please.

67
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,680
You found the body?

68
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,932
- Yes, monsieur.
- Mm.

69
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:07,269
He's a friend of yours?

70
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:13,567
- Have you any idea who killed him?
- I've no idea.

71
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:14,776
- She killed him.
- What?

72
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,111
That's not true.

73
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,072
- She says it's not true.
- She is lying.

74
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,075
- You watch your tongue.
- I heard four shots, monsieur.

75
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,443
- You heard four shots.
- Yes.

76
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:24,161
You did not see four...

77
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,455
I am sorry.

78
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:29,083
- You did not see these four shots.
- No, monsieur.

79
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,503
No. Well, then, you could not
possibly know who fired those shots.

80
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,671
The door was locked,
monsieur, from the inside.

81
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,131
So, what does that prove?

82
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,009
When I broke it open, I found
Miguel where you see him now

83
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:41,178
and Maria with a gun
in her hand.

84
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:45,557
- With the gun in her hand?
- Still smoking.

85
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:47,226
Did you have the gun
in your hand?

86
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:53,816
- And was it still smoking?
- I suppose so, but...

87
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,860
I don't know how it got there.
I really don't.

88
00:14:57,069 --> 00:14:59,738
- Ridiculous.
- I will decide what is ridiculous.

89
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:03,242
- Monsieur, you surely don't believe...
- I believe everything.

90
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,036
And I believe nothing.

91
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,497
I suspect everyone.

92
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:10,707
And I suspect no one.

93
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:15,629
I gather the facts,
examine the clues...

94
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:20,467
and before you know it,
the case is solved.

95
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,390
Oh, yes. There is much here that does not
meet the eye. That is quite obvious.

96
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:33,564
- What was that you said?
- Nothing, monsieur.

97
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,608
All right. You can go now.

98
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,027
Yes, monsieur.

99
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:45,451
But do not try to leave. Everyone
in this household is under suspicion.

100
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,661
Yes, monsieur.

101
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,801
Now, supposing
you tell me what happened.

102
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,053
He was having
difficulty with the buttons.

103
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:08,515
- Buttons?
- The buttons on my dress.

104
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:10,434
Well, you know that is
very strange because

105
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,978
there are no buttons
on this dress.

106
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:15,564
Well, that is because he
was having difficulty with them.

107
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,525
So he just tore the dress off.

108
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:21,236
- He attacked you.
- Oh, no.

109
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:24,490
I would have helped him
but... but he couldn't wait.

110
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:27,701
The buttons are probably
all over the room.

111
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,456
He was so impetuous.
A passionate Spaniard, you know?

112
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:40,380
And he tore your dress off, eh?

113
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:41,590
Yes.

114
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:44,176
And then suddenly someone
opened the door.

115
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:46,261
And Miguel leapt up and...

116
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,750
Well, that is the last
I remember

117
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,098
until Maurice came in
and found me with the gun.

118
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:53,143
Hmm. Yes.

119
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:55,312
There is, if you'll excuse me,

120
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:58,273
something here that I
do not quite understand.

121
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,235
What don't you understand?

122
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:06,406
I don't understand...

123
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:10,160
when you say
that you don't remember.

124
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,705
- I guess I was unconscious.
- Unconscious?

125
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,332
- I have a bump.
- A beump?

126
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,293
- Yes.
- Where? Let me see.

127
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,170
Oh, yes.

128
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:23,382
I don't know how it happened
but it is so painful.

129
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,926
That is beautiful perfume
you are wearing.

130
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,803
- It's bath oil.
- Ls it?

131
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,931
I really can't figure it out.
Someone must have hit me.

132
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:36,019
Yes. You have received a
mild concussion with that beump.

133
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,855
- You have cream on your nose.
- What? Oh, that's nothing.

134
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:42,109
- It's from that thing over there.
- You're all wet.

135
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:43,777
- What? Oh, yes.
- Ls it raining?

136
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:46,071
No, it's just that
stupid driver of mine

137
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,115
parked too close
to the fountain.

138
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,203
You should get out of
these clothes immediately.

139
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,619
You'll catch your death
of pneumonia, you will.

140
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,204
Yes, yes, I probably will,

141
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:57,874
but it's all part of life's
rich pageant, you know.

142
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,252
We police have to put up
with a lot of things

143
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,170
in the course of our duties

144
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,882
that in private life
one wouldn't normally tolerate.

145
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,443
Why don't we have a smoke?

146
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,553
Helps to calm the nerves

147
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:13,056
and enable us
to think more clearly.

148
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:21,148
- It is lovely perfume you're wearing.
- That's not perfume. That's bath oil.

149
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:24,151
Oh, is it? Well, it's very beautiful.

150
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,195
- Thank you.
- I can still smell it.

151
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,283
- Now, where were we?
- My bump.

152
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,160
Beump, that's right.

153
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:35,495
That you received
when somebody hit you.

154
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:38,613
Or, at least,
we presume somebody hit you.

155
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,220
How else could it have happened?

156
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,610
Well, you see,
in the police force,

157
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:43,920
first, we presume,
after, we find out.

158
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,929
That is the way we work.
Always work that way.

159
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,633
Because if we work
the other way...

160
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:50,344
Goodness, it's a
bit stuffy in here.

161
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:52,304
- Your coat!
- Yes, it is my coat.

162
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,514
- But it's on fire!
- What?

163
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,225
My coat is on fire!

164
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:00,228
My goodness, I'm burning!

165
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:06,401
- Clouseau?
- Argh!

166
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,944
He fell out of the window!

167
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:11,114
Clouseau?

168
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,373
Are you all right?

169
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:23,460
Mm? Oh, yes. I'm perfectly
all right, thank you.

170
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,548
- In that case, you may go home.
- Go home?

171
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:30,967
- You are relieved.
- Relieved?

172
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,970
I am taking charge.
Good night, Clouseau.

173
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,726
Good night, sir.

174
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,946
- Argh!
- I'm sorry, sir.

175
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:55,742
You idiot. You fool. It's a good job
I was able to check my reflexes.

176
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:59,454
I might have killed you
with a karate chop.

177
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,710
You...

178
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:06,336
you fool!

179
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:10,382
Just for that you are...
you're off the case.

180
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,600
Back to town.

181
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,402
When can I have the report?

182
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,588
I'll give you the report
first thing in the morning.

183
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:33,780
That'd be good.

184
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:38,076
- Excuse me. Monsieur Ballon?
- Yes.

185
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:43,373
- I'm Commissioner Dreyfus.
- Ah. Well, where's Inspector Clouseau?

186
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:45,584
I'm personally taking charge
of this investigation.

187
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:46,293
Oh, I see.

188
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,901
I promise that you
and Madame Ballon

189
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:49,796
will be inconvenienced
as little as possible

190
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:51,565
and that the Ballon name
will not suffer

191
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:54,676
the sensationalism of the press.

192
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,387
He was a strange fellow,
but I rather liked him.

193
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,681
- Huh?
- I mean Clouseau.

194
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,186
Oh. Yes, yes. He's a...
he's an extraordinary man.

195
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:41,640
Argh!

196
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:28,645
- Argh!

197
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:32,107
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

198
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:35,360
One moment, please.
Commissioner Dreyfus.

199
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:45,912
- Hello, Inspector Clouseau here.
- Get down here immediately.

200
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:49,040
- You're back on the Gambrelli case.
- The Gambrelli case?

201
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:53,378
Maria Gambrelli.
The maid who killed the chauffeur.

202
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:55,964
Oh, Maria Gambrelli,
the maid. Yes, yes.

203
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:59,301
Excellent. I'll be down there
right away. Thank you.

204
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,761
Well, Kato,
I am back on the case.

205
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:07,183
I tell you, Maria Gambrelli is beautiful.
Innocent. Hah!

206
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,706
By the way, Kato, that was a
very good workout today.

207
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,040
You're showing
marked improvement.

208
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,941
Every day you're getting better!

209
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:24,951
Facts, Hercule, facts.

210
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,370
Nothing matters but the facts.

211
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,540
Without them, the science
of criminal investigation

212
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:33,627
is nothing more
than a guessing game.

213
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:37,547
You listen to me, Hercule,
and you will learn something.

214
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:41,509
Now, then.
The facts in this case are...

215
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:46,598
the body of the chauffeur was found
in the bedroom of the second maid. Fact.

216
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:50,435
Cause of death - four bullets
in the chest. Fact.

217
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,859
The bullets were fired at close range
from a .25 caliber Beretta automatic. Fact.

218
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:02,989
Maria Gambrelli was discovered
with the murder weapon in her hand. Fact.

219
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:07,494
The murder weapon was registered in
the name of the deceased, Miguel Ostos,

220
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:12,290
and was kept, mark you, in the glove
compartment of the Ballon Rolls-Royce.

221
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:13,917
Fact

222
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:18,838
Now, then. Members of the household staff
have testified that Miguel Ostos beat...

223
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:26,346
Careful, you fool. You broken my pointing
stick. I've got nothing to point with now.

224
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:32,310
...have testified that Miguel Ostos
beat Maria Gambrelli frequently.

225
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,688
And, now, finally comes
the sworn statement

226
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,523
of Monsieur and Madame Ballon,

227
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:39,484
as well as all the
members of the staff,

228
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:42,070
each of them with
perfect alibis.

229
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,451
Now then, Hercule, what is the
inescapable conclusion?

230
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:53,498
- Maria Gambrelli killed the chauffeur.
- What? You idiot.

231
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:57,002
- Impossible. She's protecting someone.
- How do you know that?

232
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,462
- Instinct.
- But the facts...

233
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:01,351
You are forgetting
the most important fact.

234
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:03,174
- Motive.
- He beat her.

235
00:25:03,383 --> 00:25:06,302
- He was Spanish.
- He tore her dress off.

236
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:11,016
Don't be ridiculous. Would you kill
somebody who tore your dress off?

237
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:14,227
- No, I suppose not.
- No, of course not.

238
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:19,691
No, no. There is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever, Hercule.

239
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:23,611
Maria Gambrelli is most definitely
protecting somebody.

240
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,239
Find that somebody,
and you have found the murderer

241
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:30,618
and I shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

242
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:35,498
Maria Gambrelli will tell me
who he is. Oh, yes.

243
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,253
- What was that you said?
- Uh, nothing.

244
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:44,382
I see. All right.
Well, you can go, Hercule.

245
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:04,944
Argh!

246
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:13,495
I don't understand.

247
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:17,540
Why in the name of heaven did you
reassign Clouseau to the Gambrelli case?

248
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:22,212
That is a good question,
and it deserves an answer.

249
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,299
But what I'm about to tell you
must remain in the strictest confidence.

250
00:26:27,258 --> 00:26:32,305
This morning, at six o'clock,
I received a phone call from a superior.

251
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:37,519
I was informed that certain extremely
influential parties were interested

252
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,939
in having Clouseau back
on the case.

253
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:44,692
- I had no choice but to comply.
- Amazing.

254
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:47,278
If I were to divulge
the identity of the caller,

255
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:49,447
you'd realize
how amazing it really is.

256
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:51,074
But Why?

257
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:54,160
That's another good question,
and for that I have no answer.

258
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:58,331
Ah. They're bringing in
the Gambrelli woman.

259
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:10,969
Sit down, Miss Gambrelli.

260
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:18,786
Sit down, Miss Gambrelli.

261
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:29,464
Now, where were...

262
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:33,760
Good morning, monsieur.

263
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:39,307
- Oh. Good morning, Miss Gambrelli.
- Good morning.

264
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:42,143
- You slept well?
- No.

265
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:47,106
- Wonderful.
- It is not easy to sleep in prison.

266
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:50,735
It isn't? No, no, no,
of course it isn't. No, no, no.

267
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:53,529
We shall have to do something
about that, won't we?

268
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:56,950
Uh...

269
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:03,539
Stupid box. Yes.

270
00:29:03,748 --> 00:29:07,585
But, anyway, first,
a few simple questions.

271
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,299
- Is it all right if I smoke?
- Oh, yes, of course, yes.

272
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:16,135
- Have one of mine.
- Thank you.

273
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,722
- Ah.
- Well, have one of mine.

274
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:22,433
Mm? Oh, thank you.

275
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:25,270
That's very kind of you.
Very, very kind of you.

276
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:28,106
- That's all right.
- Allow me.

277
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,568
- Thank you. Other way around.
- Hm? What? Oh.

278
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,779
It tastes very bad
when you do that.

279
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:39,659
Well, now...

280
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:43,746
Are you comfortable?

281
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:45,873
They should have chairs
like this in the prison.

282
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:47,625
Yes, yes.
Most certainly they should.

283
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:50,753
As I recall, the furniture is
deplorable. Extremely bad taste.

284
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:52,880
Terrible. One might
as well sit on the floor.

285
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:54,357
Yes, yes...

286
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:57,385
it's really high time that somebody
did something about it, don't you think?

287
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:58,720
Sure.

288
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:01,806
As a matter of fact, I will do
something about it this very moment.

289
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:05,310
Give me the prison
superintendent immediately.

290
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:06,602
Yes, sir.

291
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,440
You know, sometimes it's
necessary to cut through the red tape

292
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:12,608
and strike directly at
the heart of the matter.

293
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:15,695
Prison is bad enough
without uncomfortable furniture.

294
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:20,283
Yes?

295
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:23,619
Superintendent,
this is Inspector Clouseau.

296
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:24,888
When are you going
to do something

297
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:27,915
about that terrible
furniture in your prison? Hmm?

298
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,002
Well, we are not savages.
This is not the Middle Ages.

299
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,672
I mean, you are running a house
of correction, not a torture chamber.

300
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:38,231
That made him think.

301
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:40,845
Well, I suggest that you take
the matter under serious consideration.

302
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:43,389
I mean, if one is to cope
with a modern criminal,

303
00:30:43,598 --> 00:30:45,475
it is necessary to
use modern methods.

304
00:30:45,683 --> 00:30:48,394
I mean, you can't have
a contemporary prison

305
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:51,856
without, uh,
contemporary furniture.

306
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,942
Yes. Well, that's
my opinion, anyway.

307
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:59,530
Oh. And the same to you,
Superintendent.

308
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,367
Filthy swine.

309
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:04,619
You're not at all
like a policeman.

310
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,082
Your dossier.

311
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:15,588
I always keep my important
documents under lock and key

312
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:18,674
because one can
never be too sure.

313
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:21,302
Now, here...

314
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:24,514
Oh.

315
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:27,350
Oh, uh...

316
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:29,227
Excuse me.

317
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:31,020
Stupid.

318
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:41,447
Oh.

319
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:48,287
Now, um...

320
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:57,880
Miss Gambrelli, your dossier contains
some very, very interesting facts.

321
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:02,760
It seems that you have known
this Miguel Ostos for quite some time.

322
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:03,719
Yes.

323
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:06,681
- And were you in love with him?
- Yes.

324
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,475
You're in love
with the man that raped you?

325
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:12,437
That what?

326
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:17,483
Testimony of Georges Duval, gardener.
Referring to Ostos, you described him,

327
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:22,196
and I quote, as "that crazy Spaniard
who raped me in my father's field".

328
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:25,366
He did not rape me.

329
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:30,371
- He did not force you?
- Well, you see, I tripped over a root,

330
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:36,335
and I grabbed Miguel to keep me
from falling, and somehow we both fell.

331
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:43,468
I cried a little bit afterwards but that
wasn't because I was sorry it happened.

332
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:46,679
- It was something he said.
- He insulted you.

333
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:51,684
Oh, no. He lit a cigarette
and took a long puff, and...

334
00:32:53,352 --> 00:32:56,230
Tell me, why do so many men
smoke afterwards?

335
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,733
No wonder tobacco
companies get rich.

336
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:05,615
Yes, I must admit I had never
thought of it quite that way.

337
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:10,828
Hmm. Last night, it was to be our
last night. It was all finished.

338
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:15,333
- You were leaving him?
- Oh, no. He was leaving me.

339
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:19,504
Poor Miguel. He was really in one
of his moods last night.

340
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:22,757
First he babbled in Spanish,
and then he cried.

341
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,218
You know, he really
broke down and cried.

342
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:27,178
- You don't say.
- I do say.

343
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:30,389
And then when I tried to console him,
make him feel better,

344
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:35,561
suddenly he was tearing off my clothes
and cursing like a madman.

345
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,146
Hmm.

346
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,983
Very strange.

347
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:43,736
Very strange.

348
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:46,155
The thing I don't understand...

349
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:49,075
Ostos was leaving you

350
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:51,035
and yet by your own account

351
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:53,871
he was behaving like
a jealous madman.

352
00:33:54,747 --> 00:34:00,753
Well, you see, I thought
if he was leaving me he'd suffer,

353
00:34:00,962 --> 00:34:03,047
thinking that I was alone.

354
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:07,635
And... and so I told him
there was someone else.

355
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:09,262
Mm-hmm.

356
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,556
It was a lie. I admit that.

357
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:13,766
But only out of kindness.

358
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:15,434
Ah!

359
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:18,212
- Oh, uh...
- I'm sorry.

360
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,042
It's nothing at all, really.
Stupid tailor.

361
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,424
Beautiful suit.

362
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:26,487
Yes, I know, but don't worry.
A few stitches and you'll never know.

363
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:29,282
Miguel? Ah!

364
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,075
Hercule?

365
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:35,913
Must I go back to prison?

366
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:39,000
Unfortunately, yes.

367
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:42,253
But... don't give up hope.

368
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,423
- What do you want?
- You sent for me.

369
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:47,592
Of course I sent for you!

370
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:50,845
Goodbye.

371
00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:54,682
Goodbye, my dar...
uh, Miss Gambrelli.

372
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:17,246
Well, there's no doubt in my mind
she is shielding someone.

373
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:20,541
- Do you think you can break her down?
- Mm.

374
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,669
Given enough time, I could
have her eating out of my hand.

375
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:27,632
Yes, anyway, we have no time.

376
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
I must catch this man
before he leaves the country.

377
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:33,262
- But if you don't know who he is...
- She will lead me to him.

378
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:36,140
- Release her.
- Release her?

379
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:37,892
Of course. How can
she lead me to him

380
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,328
if she's still in prison,
you idiot?

381
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:43,564
- But Commissioner Dreyfus...
- I will assume complete responsibility.

382
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:47,818
Release her immediately. I will
apprehend this culprit within 24 hours.

383
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:49,403
Argh!

384
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:54,075
Get me out of here.
Quick, nurse, the screens.

385
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,874
Look, I've got Africa
all over my hand now.

386
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,144
Nice balloons.

387
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,191
Do you have a license
to sell these balloons?

388
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,028
License?

389
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,529
- Yes?
- Good morning, monsieur.

390
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:16,699
Good morning, Georges. Is there
something I can do for you?

391
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:21,996
Well, yes. And perhaps there's
something I can do for you.

392
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:24,832
What could you
possibly do for me?

393
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,585
You remember the night
of the murder?

394
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:30,796
- Is that a rhetorical question?
- What?

395
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,257
Now, come along, Georges.
What is it you want?

396
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:37,470
I saw you climbing down
from Maria's room.

397
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,682
- You have sharp eyes.
- Oh, yes.

398
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:46,854
And a big stomach. It's so hard
to keep it filled, prices these days.

399
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:49,148
Are we going to discuss
the national economy

400
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:50,916
or will you presently
come to the point?

401
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:54,320
The point is 100,000 francs.

402
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,739
You know, for the groceries.

403
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:01,786
Then perhaps my eyes
will grow small again.

404
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:07,625
Yes. Well, we'll certainly have to
do something about your stomach.

405
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:32,983
Hey!

406
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,571
Nice dog. Nice dog.

407
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:47,122
Nice doggie.

408
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:52,670
Oh. Excuse me. I just happened
to be passing and I...

409
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:55,005
Ah. Ah.

410
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:58,592
Ah.

411
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:00,678
Ah, my little...

412
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:03,723
Oh, you have been cutting flowers.

413
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:07,010
You must have been cutting something.
There's blood all over your cutting shears.

414
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:10,145
- Ah. Ah.
- That's very strange.

415
00:39:10,354 --> 00:39:13,649
Ah!

416
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:15,860
Ah.

417
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:19,738
Facts, Hercule. Facts.

418
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:25,077
Behind them lies the whole
fabric of deductive truth.

419
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:28,831
Now, Hercule, let us
examine these facts.

420
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,335
One - she was found with the
murder weapon in her hand.

421
00:39:33,544 --> 00:39:37,256
Two - the murder weapon
was fresh with blood.

422
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:41,010
Three - there were no fingerprints
on the murder weapon other than hers,

423
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:47,766
and four - all the members of the Ballon
household staff have perfect alibis.

424
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:52,187
Now then, Hercule,
what do these facts add up to?

425
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:55,608
Maria Gambrelli killed
Georges the gardener.

426
00:39:55,774 --> 00:39:57,067
You are an idiot.

427
00:39:57,276 --> 00:40:00,279
Only a fresh-faced novice would
come up with a conclusion like that.

428
00:40:00,487 --> 00:40:02,031
- But the facts...
- Listen.

429
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,742
Whoever killed Miguel
killed Georges the gardener.

430
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,077
And he did it
to cover up the first crime.

431
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:08,763
Now, what he is trying to do
is lay the blame

432
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:10,873
at the foot of this...
This poor servant girl.

433
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:13,751
Well, who do you suspect?

434
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:18,422
I suspect everyone.

435
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:20,883
- I suppose that is possible.
- Possible?

436
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:24,553
What do you mean "possible"?
I deal in certainties.

437
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:29,016
I have only to break her down, make
her admit she's protecting somebody

438
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:32,394
and then force her
to divulge his identity.

439
00:40:33,854 --> 00:40:37,316
There can be no more
cat and mouse.

440
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:40,152
No more subtle interrogation.

441
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:45,449
For her own sake,
and for the sake of justice,

442
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:49,453
I will resort to any means,
short of brute force,

443
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:52,039
to drag it out of her, Hercule.

444
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:54,041
True, she will suffer.

445
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:59,838
But in the end she will be free
and we will have our killer.

446
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:03,926
- You released her again?
- Yes, sir.

447
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,424
Well, shall we settle
this thing now,

448
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:45,718
or do you intend
making me late for the recital?

449
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:49,972
We can't just fire her.
She has given us no cause.

450
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,933
Cause? We are up to our necks
in dead bodies.

451
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:56,186
What are you waiting for?
The last act of Hamlet?

452
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:58,439
If you're going to compare
the Ballon household

453
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,940
with a Shakespearean tragedy,

454
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:03,235
I suggest that Macbeth
would be more appropriate.

455
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:06,739
Oh, darling, my cue ball.

456
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,304
That was Madame Ballon.

457
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:34,308
Follow her. When you have discovered
her destination, call me immediately.

458
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:40,189
Inspector Clouseau.

459
00:42:44,818 --> 00:42:47,422
- Good evening, Monsieur Ballon.
- Good evening, Inspector.

460
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:48,757
If you don't mind,
there are one or two

461
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:49,841
questions I would like to ask.

462
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:52,367
- Of course.
- Some points that need clearing up.

463
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:54,536
Certainly. Do you
play billiards, by any chance?

464
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:58,082
Billiards. Oh, well, yes, I have played
some billiards in my time.

465
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,669
I find that it makes for a more relaxed
and friendly conversation. How about you?

466
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:04,505
- Yes.
- Take a cue.

467
00:43:04,713 --> 00:43:07,132
Ah. A cue. Yes.

468
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:10,052
Hmm.

469
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,221
That should do.

470
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:19,520
- That's very strange.
- I think you'd be better off

471
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:20,479
with an ordinary cue.

472
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:24,525
- That's what we call a bridge.
- Ah, the bridge cue, yes.

473
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:28,153
Yes, I much prefer the good,
old-fashioned, plain cue, you know.

474
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:30,364
Yes, yes.

475
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:39,164
Oh, I'm most terribly sorry.
I'm dreadfully sorry.

476
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:41,959
Oh, that's all right.
I've broken a few in my time.

477
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:45,420
Try this one.
This is my favorite cue.

478
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,802
You'll find that it's great
for curved shots.

479
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:10,070
You, uh, had some
questions, Inspector.

480
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:11,279
Yes.

481
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:15,409
I had rather hoped
to have a talk with your wife.

482
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:19,454
- Well, she's out. You just missed her.
- On the contrary.

483
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:24,084
She just missed me
in the driveway going out. Ah!

484
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:34,845
Monsieur Ballon,
did you not state...

485
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:40,893
that, uh... on the night
of the murder...

486
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:47,566
you had, uh, just arrived from
London on the 11 o'clock flight?

487
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,278
Yes. Why do you ask?

488
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:54,364
It was canceled
due to bad weather.

489
00:44:54,573 --> 00:44:57,701
I arrived on an earlier flight.

490
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,120
I put it to you directly,
Monsieur Ballon,

491
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:04,208
that it was you who
murdered Miguel Ostos.

492
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:08,045
Don't be ridiculous.

493
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:10,380
Oh.

494
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:13,133
Uh... look,
if you can just move...

495
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:17,346
That's it. These curved cues
can be difficult.

496
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:19,514
Now pull.

497
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:25,187
Yes, I disliked
Miguel intensely.

498
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:27,075
But I am not in the habit
of killing people

499
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:30,150
merely because I dislike them.
Oh, I beg your pardon.

500
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:34,797
As long as you
know about the canceled flight,

501
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:36,341
I may as well
tell you the whole thing.

502
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,158
The night that
Miguel was killed,

503
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:40,786
I arranged for him to meet
the 11 o'clock plane.

504
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:42,996
I arrived on the nine o'clock.

505
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:46,500
Now, he would be on his way to the
airport while I was on my way home.

506
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:49,002
My wife was at a dinner party.

507
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:54,132
This would give me a whole hour,
at least, alone in the house.

508
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,928
For what?

509
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:00,931
For Maria.

510
00:46:03,642 --> 00:46:04,726
What?

511
00:46:05,811 --> 00:46:07,646
Does that surprise you?

512
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,575
Then I submit, Inspector Ballon,
that you arrived home,

513
00:46:20,784 --> 00:46:23,453
found Miguel
with Maria Gambrelli,

514
00:46:23,662 --> 00:46:26,540
and killed him in
a rit of fealous jage.

515
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:30,752
I admit to the affair,
but to kill for her?

516
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:34,256
- Would you kill for her?
- Of course... uh, not.

517
00:46:35,507 --> 00:46:38,593
- Well, it's still your shot.
- Yes. Mm.

518
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:40,762
Ah. Mm.

519
00:46:41,763 --> 00:46:43,181
Mm.

520
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:05,662
I'm dreadfully sorry,
Monsieur Ballon.

521
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:09,082
I appear to have grazed
your billiard table.

522
00:47:11,626 --> 00:47:14,338
Telephone, monsieur,
for Inspector Clouseau.

523
00:47:14,963 --> 00:47:17,174
Ah, that would be for me.

524
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:27,684
Yes? This is Inspector Clouseau.

525
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:42,908
All right. If you stay there
I will come over immediately.

526
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:46,453
Monsieur Ballon,
I wonder if you could oblige.

527
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:49,664
I have to meet my assistant
and I am without a car.

528
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:52,334
- Oh, well, I'll have Pierre drive you.
- Excellent.

529
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:55,921
Well, I suppose it's the end of our game.
Do you mind putting my cue away?

530
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:02,959
Have Pierre bring the car around.

531
00:48:24,741 --> 00:48:27,244
Your car is ready, monsieur.

532
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:31,998
Look, I'm, uh, dreadfully sorry,
Monsieur Ballon.

533
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:34,501
Oh, please don't
concern yourself, Inspector.

534
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:36,294
Maurice will do it for you.

535
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:43,385
Let go of my back, you...

536
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:50,350
Thank you, monsieur.

537
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:53,895
Really, Monsieur Ballon,
whoever invented that rack

538
00:48:54,104 --> 00:48:55,939
should have his head examined.

539
00:48:56,148 --> 00:48:57,941
Well...

540
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,571
- We will continue at another time.
- A pleasure at any time.

541
00:49:06,158 --> 00:49:09,494
I suggest you have your
architect investigated as well.

542
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,261
Madame Ballon is in
apartment 12, second floor.

543
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:30,390
You stay here. If I'm not out within
ten minutes, send reinforcements. Alright?

544
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:01,254
Argh!

545
00:51:41,146 --> 00:51:42,689
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

546
00:51:42,897 --> 00:51:44,649
I'm the game warden.

547
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:48,987
- Do you have a hunting license?
- Hunting license?

548
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,127
He was shooting crows?

549
00:52:04,336 --> 00:52:07,589
He was disguised as a hunter in
order to watch the Ballon house.

550
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:09,382
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

551
00:52:13,303 --> 00:52:17,891
Give me ten men like Clouseau
and I could destroy the world.

552
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:21,269
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

553
00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:24,064
After I got his release,
he got a phone call.

554
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:28,610
He ran out of his office saying he had an
important lead that would crack the case.

555
00:52:28,818 --> 00:52:32,658
This case is already so full of cracks I guess
one more won't make any difference, hmm?

556
00:52:41,164 --> 00:52:43,875
- François?
- Yes, Commissioner?

557
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:47,045
I've just cut off my thumb.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

558
00:52:59,808 --> 00:53:04,729
Now then. You say you followed Maria
Gambrelli to this godforsaken place?

559
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:08,233
She took a taxi this far,
then I followed her up the pathway

560
00:53:08,441 --> 00:53:10,402
to the entrance
to Camp Sunshine.

561
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,404
- Camp Sunshine?
- Yes.

562
00:53:12,612 --> 00:53:13,405
I would have called you,

563
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:15,773
but then I perceived Dudu
the maid also enter the camp.

564
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:17,701
- Up the path, you say?
- Yes, but Inspector...

565
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:21,538
Look, you return to the Ballon residence
and look for more clues.

566
00:53:21,746 --> 00:53:22,414
Inspector...

567
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:25,208
I will try to see what is afoot
at this... Camp Sunshine.

568
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:26,217
Inspector, I think I should...

569
00:53:26,227 --> 00:53:28,537
Hurry up, man.
There's not a second to lose.

570
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:58,658
Good afternoon.

571
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:00,368
Hmm.

572
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:03,413
I am Inspector Clouseau
of the Sûreté.

573
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:05,832
Oh.

574
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,378
Tell me, have you anyone registered here
by the name of Maria Gambrelli?

575
00:54:10,754 --> 00:54:14,841
Gambrelli. Yes, I believe
she checked in about an hour ago.

576
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:17,135
Yes. Gambrelli.

577
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,764
- 11:45.
- Where can I find her?

578
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:26,352
Well, she could be most anywhere, but
my guess would be the recreation area.

579
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:28,563
Thank you.

580
00:54:33,777 --> 00:54:36,738
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes?

581
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:39,949
Have you been... swimming?

582
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:42,911
Why, yes. How did you know?

583
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,747
It is my business to know.

584
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:10,939
Ah, ah, ah. And where
do you think you're going?

585
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:16,820
I do not think, sir.
I know where I am going.

586
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:19,239
I am going to
the recreation area.

587
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:22,158
- Not like that, you're not.
- What was that you said?

588
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,954
I said you're not going
to the recreation area like that.

589
00:55:26,162 --> 00:55:29,666
- I am Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.
- How do you do? I'm Turk.

590
00:55:29,874 --> 00:55:31,209
I am here on official business,

591
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:34,128
and I am looking for someone
at the recreation area.

592
00:55:34,337 --> 00:55:36,172
Not unless you
take off your clothes.

593
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:41,678
- You, sir, are under arrest.
- Arrest? What for?

594
00:55:41,886 --> 00:55:43,366
For making lewd and
suggestive remarks

595
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:45,073
to an official
of the French government.

596
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:47,767
- Lewd and suggestive remarks?
- Also for indecent exposure.

597
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:49,412
Doesn't anyone wear
any clothes around here?

598
00:55:49,336 --> 00:55:51,283
- No.
- What?

599
00:55:51,383 --> 00:55:52,730
This is a nudist colony.

600
00:55:55,108 --> 00:55:58,194
- A nudist colony?
- Right.

601
00:55:58,361 --> 00:56:00,905
And nobody gets in unless
they take their clothes off.

602
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:05,118
What, all of them?

603
00:56:05,493 --> 00:56:08,746
All of them.
Right down to your mustache.

604
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:04,236
Argh!

605
00:58:25,717 --> 00:58:27,760
- Are you the one who called the police?
- I?

606
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:30,009
Someone called from this camp
and reported a murder.

607
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:31,138
Murder?

608
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:33,216
Tell the men to spread out
and search the camp.

609
00:58:33,316 --> 00:58:35,101
One of your men is already in the camp.

610
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:38,521
- One of my men?
- Yes. Inspector Clouseau.

611
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:40,440
Hmm.

612
00:58:40,648 --> 00:58:42,248
- Ah!
- I'm so sorry, I can't understand.

613
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:43,484
Murder?

614
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:45,069
Oh!

615
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:17,143
Pssst!

616
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:19,979
- Beg your pardon?
- Clouseau!

617
00:59:23,274 --> 00:59:24,692
Over here.

618
00:59:31,657 --> 00:59:33,076
Quick.

619
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:38,081
Listen, that's Dudu.

620
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:40,625
- Dudu?
- She's dead.

621
00:59:41,709 --> 00:59:43,753
Dead? Dudu?

622
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:03,815
Come out! Out.

623
01:00:04,023 --> 01:00:05,316
Round up everyone.

624
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:08,528
And get me that idiot,
that is if you can find him.

625
01:00:08,736 --> 01:00:10,947
Straight away, sir.

626
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:16,661
If someone has been murdered here,
please, let it be Clouseau, hmm?

627
01:00:26,587 --> 01:00:27,856
What are we going to do?

628
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,192
We must do something.
We can't leave here without our clothes.

629
01:00:30,216 --> 01:00:33,469
I am getting cold.
Just look at those goose pimples.

630
01:00:47,316 --> 01:00:48,818
Clouseau!

631
01:01:23,895 --> 01:01:24,890
I know how you feel but...

632
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:27,607
I'm having a bad dream.
It's a nightmare.

633
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:29,543
Believe me, it's nothing
to what would have happened

634
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:30,276
if they'd caught us.

635
01:01:30,484 --> 01:01:34,030
- What do we do now?
- Well, you keep down,

636
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:36,532
and then they can only see
the top half of me.

637
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:39,141
Perhaps they will think that
I have just come from the beach,

638
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:40,345
from a swim, you know.
And, uh...

639
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:43,706
- We can't just keep driving around?
- No.

640
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:45,625
- Please.
- No, no, that's right.

641
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:50,338
I will take us to my apartment and
somehow I will try to get us inside.

642
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:53,382
Please, whatever happens,
try to keep calm.

643
01:01:58,721 --> 01:02:00,431
I can assure you
she's not in the house.

644
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,018
I'm sorry, Monsieur Ballon, but it
is necessary that I see for myself.

645
01:02:12,068 --> 01:02:13,548
She has not been
in the house all day?

646
01:02:13,736 --> 01:02:16,197
All I can tell you is that she
left before I did this morning

647
01:02:16,405 --> 01:02:19,659
and she wasn't here
when I got back an hour ago.

648
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,289
- Henri can verify that.
- Henri?

649
01:02:25,498 --> 01:02:28,668
- The head butler.
- I'd like to talk to Henri.

650
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,757
Well, he could have verified it.

651
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:23,723
- Only a few more blocks now.
- I feel like I'm losing my mind.

652
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:26,684
I think I'm going to start screaming
and I won't be able to stop.

653
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:29,645
Please, please, try to
hold on to yourself.

654
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:58,758
Control yourself, please.

655
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,650
You are off the Gambrelli case.

656
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:18,920
And you will report for duty
to the Department of Records.

657
01:04:18,944 --> 01:04:19,612
Department of Records?

658
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,364
- In Martinique.
- What?

659
01:04:21,572 --> 01:04:23,991
Tomorrow morning,
or you can forget your pension.

660
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,036
But that is not fair.
I was only doing my duty.

661
01:04:27,244 --> 01:04:30,998
And I am right, you will see.
Maria Gambrelli is not a murderer.

662
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,211
There is something
personal in this.

663
01:04:35,419 --> 01:04:38,047
Yes. Deeply personal.

664
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:43,511
I hate you. Every little
bit of you. Now get out!

665
01:04:43,928 --> 01:04:45,554
You want me to leave?

666
01:04:51,685 --> 01:04:53,771
You are making
a terrible mistake.

667
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:57,441
If Maria Gambrelli is not a
murderer, and I say she is not,

668
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:01,445
you are sending an innocent girl
to the guillotine!

669
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:05,574
Excuse me, François.

670
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:09,495
And another thing!

671
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,132
Martinique?

672
01:05:24,802 --> 01:05:26,595
He's on his way.

673
01:05:28,722 --> 01:05:33,394
What about those influential
parties that wanted Clouseau on the case?

674
01:05:34,645 --> 01:05:39,275
Whatever they do to me now,
it is not half of what he has done already.

675
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:42,611
Ah.

676
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:49,076
Besides, I feel certain I know
who is behind those influential requests.

677
01:05:49,285 --> 01:05:51,745
- Ballon.
- Ballon?

678
01:05:51,954 --> 01:05:54,874
It's obvious he was having
an affair with Maria Gambrelli.

679
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:56,876
Most likely.

680
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,253
At first I couldn't understand
why anyone

681
01:05:59,462 --> 01:06:02,756
would want a man like Clouseau
to be in charge of a murder case,

682
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:04,925
especially a case
of this importance.

683
01:06:05,134 --> 01:06:08,429
- But why would Ballon?
- He wouldn't.

684
01:06:08,637 --> 01:06:10,764
Unless he was
protecting someone.

685
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:15,478
Now if you were protecting someone, who
would be the perfect man on the case?

686
01:06:15,644 --> 01:06:19,565
A fool. A detective
who is a complete and utter fool.

687
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:22,026
- Clouseau?
- Of course.

688
01:06:22,234 --> 01:06:26,363
If Maria Gambrelli is convicted, Ballon
is up to his ears in a very nasty scandal

689
01:06:26,572 --> 01:06:30,493
and Clouseau was his insurance policy
against such a scandal.

690
01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:33,829
Well, he has gone.

691
01:06:35,331 --> 01:06:36,874
Ah.

692
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:40,169
I feel like a child again.

693
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:44,798
It's an interesting theory,
but what if you are wrong?

694
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,011
I know it's an extremely
remote possibility,

695
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:53,140
but what if you are wrong and
Ballon is not protecting Maria Gambrelli?

696
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:56,727
What if she is innocent,
as Clouseau claims?

697
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:59,230
- Ridiculous.
- But a possibility.

698
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:01,690
What if Ballon is
protecting someone else,

699
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:05,903
or what if Ballon himself
is the guilty party?

700
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,657
- It's a sadistic thing to suggest.
- But, if only for the sake of discussion,

701
01:07:09,865 --> 01:07:11,909
what if you are wrong,

702
01:07:12,117 --> 01:07:17,039
and Clouseau - a fool,
a complete and utter fool...

703
01:07:17,248 --> 01:07:20,918
- I'd be ruined.
- It's something to consider.

704
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:31,637
- François?
- Yes, Commissioner?

705
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:34,014
Would you please
call for a doctor?

706
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:36,642
Are you ill?

707
01:07:37,393 --> 01:07:40,771
I seem to have stabbed myself
with a letter opener.

708
01:08:03,168 --> 01:08:04,920
Argh!

709
01:08:05,129 --> 01:08:08,591
Kato, you fool. Get off of me,
will you? Get off me!

710
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,427
Kato, what are
you doing? Not now.

711
01:08:18,183 --> 01:08:21,562
Kato. Release me, you fool.

712
01:08:26,025 --> 01:08:28,235
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

713
01:08:28,444 --> 01:08:31,405
Give me that telephone,
you idiot.

714
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:35,993
- Inspector Clouseau here.
- This is the commissioner.

715
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:39,038
You are back
on the Gambrelli case.

716
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:43,792
Well, Kato,
I'm back on the case.

717
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:52,051
Now to set the trap,
catch the killer,

718
01:08:53,135 --> 01:08:58,349
and prove to the world that Maria
Gambrelli is innocent of murder.

719
01:08:59,433 --> 01:09:04,146
Hello? This is Inspector Clouseau. Connect
me with my assistant immediately, will you?

720
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:09,610
I am ashamed of myself, Kato.
I forgot the first rule of self-defense.

721
01:09:09,818 --> 01:09:12,988
No matter what the circumstances,
always anticipate the unexpected.

722
01:09:13,197 --> 01:09:15,366
Had you been a real assassin,
you might have killed me.

723
01:09:15,574 --> 01:09:17,785
We're going to have to
accelerate our training program.

724
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:20,633
You must learn to attack me
whenever and wherever I least expect it

725
01:09:20,829 --> 01:09:23,624
and you must give no quarter.
Understand?

726
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:26,293
Hello, Hercule?
This is Clouseau.

727
01:09:26,502 --> 01:09:31,382
I am back on the case.
Right, release Maria Gambrelli at once

728
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:35,135
and make a reservation
for two, tonight, 8:00, at the Café Olé.

729
01:09:35,344 --> 01:09:37,346
Right. Bye bye.

730
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:41,725
Kato, unpack my things
and lay out my new blue suit.

731
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:45,229
I'm going to have a lovely hot soak
in a nice warm bath,

732
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:48,190
and I will plan out my strategy.

733
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,609
He released her again.

734
01:10:33,777 --> 01:10:36,655
And he's taking her
out to dinner.

735
01:10:38,782 --> 01:10:41,243
Every paper in Paris
has the story,

736
01:10:41,994 --> 01:10:44,329
including the
Christian Science Monitor,

737
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:46,749
and he gave them the story.

738
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:49,752
You see, he claims
she's protecting her lover

739
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,380
and the best way to force him
into the open is to make him jealous.

740
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,550
Jealous!

741
01:10:56,759 --> 01:11:00,345
That nincompoop.
That megalomaniac.

742
01:11:00,554 --> 01:11:05,058
He's setting the science of criminal
investigation back a thousand years.

743
01:11:05,267 --> 01:11:07,436
And I can't do
anything about it.

744
01:11:07,603 --> 01:11:09,646
- Why not?
- Why not?

745
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:13,317
What if he's right?

746
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:17,613
- What if he is?
- I'm finished. Washed up.

747
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:21,909
Sanity and reason become
things of the past. Madness reigns.

748
01:11:22,117 --> 01:11:23,827
- Just relax.
- Relax?

749
01:11:24,036 --> 01:11:25,704
With Clouseau
loose in the world?

750
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:29,166
You go about offering irresponsible
suggestions like that, doctor,

751
01:11:29,374 --> 01:11:31,293
and you better find yourself
a good analyst.

752
01:11:31,502 --> 01:11:34,087
- Now, just lie down.
- Just lie down.

753
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:35,923
- And relax.
- Relax.

754
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:38,884
Don't you think I want to relax?

755
01:11:39,092 --> 01:11:42,221
Don't you think I'd give my
right arm for a good night's sleep?

756
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:45,265
I haven't closed my eyes in three days.

757
01:11:45,474 --> 01:11:49,019
I've only eaten a chicken leg
and some clear broth since Wednesday.

758
01:11:49,228 --> 01:11:52,689
I'm cracking up.
I'm coming apart at the seams.

759
01:11:54,024 --> 01:11:58,654
Look at my eye. I used to have
a perfectly good eye. Two eyes, I mean.

760
01:11:58,862 --> 01:12:03,784
No, Doctor, there is no hope. There is
no hope unless I can get rid of Clouseau.

761
01:12:04,785 --> 01:12:06,787
I must get rid of Clouseau.

762
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:54,788
Ese gitano de Cordoba,
o sea que eres unico, arsa, mira.

763
01:16:55,492 --> 01:16:58,453
Pei do dna! Pei do dna!

764
01:17:32,821 --> 01:17:35,240
Pei do dna! Pei do dna!

765
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,992
What's wrong?

766
01:19:12,254 --> 01:19:16,091
I'm not gonna let you look at me
going up the stairs, you naughty thing.

767
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:19,302
Come on, then.

768
01:19:19,928 --> 01:19:22,806
No, I'm just unlocking the door. No.

769
01:19:23,431 --> 01:19:28,603
You just split up your pants so you could
lure me into this apartment of yours.

770
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:32,399
Well, this is my apartment.

771
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,985
I know this is your apartment.

772
01:19:35,193 --> 01:19:39,531
- How about a little lure?
- Nothing lure. You lure, you.

773
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:42,534
Oh, lu-lu-lu-lu-lure.

774
01:19:43,493 --> 01:19:45,203
- Do you know?
- What?

775
01:19:45,412 --> 01:19:49,708
I know this is your apartment.
But that won't help you in the least bit.

776
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:52,294
Why won't that help me
in the least bit?

777
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:53,920
- Because...
- Question...

778
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:58,133
- Question, answer, Mr. Police Inspector.
- Jacques Clouseau is the name.

779
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:00,343
I've given up sex.

780
01:20:00,552 --> 01:20:02,012
Oh.

781
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:05,015
Quel brutto momento.

782
01:20:05,223 --> 01:20:07,600
I've given up sex.

783
01:20:28,038 --> 01:20:30,665
- Promise me.
- What, darling?

784
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:35,545
Afterwards,
you will not smoke, hm?

785
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:40,508
I give you my word
as an officer and a gentleman.

786
01:20:40,717 --> 01:20:42,552
Also, a policeman.

787
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:45,597
Policeman.

788
01:20:45,805 --> 01:20:48,016
- Jacques?
- Yes, darling.

789
01:20:49,309 --> 01:20:51,102
Carry me.

790
01:20:51,311 --> 01:20:52,771
All right, my darling.

791
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:56,483
Jacques?

792
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:58,360
- Yes, my darling?
- I swore I'd never...

793
01:20:58,568 --> 01:20:59,319
- Ooh!
- Oh.

794
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:00,278
Sorry, my darling.

795
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:02,989
Jacques, I swore I'd never,
never do it again, you know.

796
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:06,868
- Yes, darling.
- And I resolve to be so strong.

797
01:21:07,077 --> 01:21:08,246
Yes, darling.

798
01:21:08,266 --> 01:21:11,748
You know, we all pay for our sins,
don't we?

799
01:21:11,956 --> 01:21:17,170
Could you open the door, my darling?
Anything... worth waiting for is worth...

800
01:21:17,379 --> 01:21:18,505
Oh.

801
01:21:21,299 --> 01:21:23,301
Oh, darling.

802
01:21:28,765 --> 01:21:32,227
My darling.
My dear, sweet darling.

803
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:37,440
My sweet darling,
let's have the...

804
01:21:42,153 --> 01:21:43,193
- Jacques?
- What, darling?

805
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:45,448
It may be somebody
important, Jacques.

806
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:48,017
Oh, darling, listen. What could
be more important than this?

807
01:21:48,118 --> 01:21:50,912
Jacques, look what you are doing.
Look at my sleeve.

808
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:51,965
It's all right, darling.

809
01:21:51,985 --> 01:21:53,449
- Jacques, go to the door.
- It looks better that way.

810
01:21:53,473 --> 01:21:55,208
Darling, go to the door.

811
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:58,002
- Probably somebody important.
- Don't go away.

812
01:21:58,211 --> 01:22:00,505
- Don't go away. What?
- Darling, hurry.

813
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:02,715
Hurry, yes.

814
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:40,545
- Darling!
- Coming, my lovely little darling.

815
01:22:41,629 --> 01:22:43,882
That's very strange.

816
01:22:52,724 --> 01:22:53,724
Darling.

817
01:22:53,892 --> 01:22:56,311
- Oh, my darling.
- Come here.

818
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:03,693
Oh! Oh, this is too much
for a simple policeman.

819
01:23:06,905 --> 01:23:09,157
Oh, my darling.

820
01:23:09,365 --> 01:23:12,243
Wait, I... Wait, wait, wait.

821
01:23:12,452 --> 01:23:14,829
Wait, my darling. Wait.

822
01:23:20,543 --> 01:23:22,253
You beautiful, wonderful...

823
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:25,340
- You're like a... Like a little pin.
- Like a pin?

824
01:23:33,431 --> 01:23:35,058
- Argh!
- No!

825
01:23:36,893 --> 01:23:40,438
- No!
- Kato! Kato, you fool!

826
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:44,984
Kato!

827
01:23:47,737 --> 01:23:49,239
Kato!

828
01:24:02,794 --> 01:24:03,795
Jacques!

829
01:24:04,003 --> 01:24:07,006
Don't worry, my darling.
It's only Kato. It's only Kato.

830
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:09,217
This poor fool.

831
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:35,994
Jacques! Oh, Jacques!

832
01:24:36,202 --> 01:24:38,329
- I killed him.
- Don't worry, you didn't.

833
01:24:38,538 --> 01:24:42,500
He's all right, my darling. It's nothing
to worry. Nothing can happen to us now.

834
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:57,682
"Trail of death
follows Inspector Clouseau."

835
01:25:01,644 --> 01:25:06,733
Four people - a doorman,
two customers, and a Cossack.

836
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:10,320
Most regrettable.

837
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:15,783
Regrettable? Including the Ballon murders
this brings the grand total to eight!

838
01:25:15,992 --> 01:25:19,495
Well, that just goes to prove
what I have said all along.

839
01:25:22,123 --> 01:25:25,585
What you've said all along, Clouseau,
qualifies you as the greatest prophet

840
01:25:25,793 --> 01:25:29,464
since General Custer said he was
going to surround all those Indians!

841
01:25:29,672 --> 01:25:31,633
Maria Gambrelli did not kill
those four people.

842
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:34,552
- Which four people?
- The last four people.

843
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:37,401
Someone else killed those four people.
I was with her all the time.

844
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:40,558
And whoever he is, he's the same man
who killed the first four people.

845
01:25:40,767 --> 01:25:43,728
- A doorman? A Cossack?
- Innocent bystanders.

846
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:46,314
The murderer was after me.
Fortunately he missed.

847
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:48,566
"Fortunately" is not the word.

848
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:51,152
Nevertheless, it proves
that my theory is correct.

849
01:25:51,361 --> 01:25:53,041
You see, because of
some misguided loyalty,

850
01:25:53,154 --> 01:25:55,514
Maria Gambrelli will not divulge
the name of her former love

851
01:25:55,615 --> 01:25:58,409
and that man is so jealous
he will kill rather than lose her.

852
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:01,663
Are you saying that this man,
the man Maria Gambrelli is protecting,

853
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:05,458
her former lover, killed eight people
because he was jealous?

854
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:06,834
Insanely jealous.

855
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:10,505
So jealous he made it look like
Maria Gambrelli was the murderer?

856
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:12,548
He's a madman, a psychotic.

857
01:26:12,757 --> 01:26:14,550
- What about the maid?
- The maid?

858
01:26:14,759 --> 01:26:17,220
Was he jealous of her, too?
He strangled her.

859
01:26:17,428 --> 01:26:20,431
It's possible that his intended victim
was a man and he made a mistake.

860
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,934
- A mistake? In a nudist camp?
- Nobody's perfect.

861
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:25,186
- Idiot! Nincompoop!
- Sir. Commissioner.

862
01:26:25,395 --> 01:26:26,938
Lunatic!

863
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:29,315
I will have your murderer
for you by tonight.

864
01:26:29,524 --> 01:26:30,650
What?

865
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,320
- I have a plan.
- What sort of plan?

866
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:37,949
A plan that
cannot possibly fail.

867
01:26:53,381 --> 01:26:57,135
Right. Now, remember,
at eight o'clock sharp,

868
01:26:57,343 --> 01:27:00,888
you pull the master switch
just as I am about to name the murderer.

869
01:27:01,097 --> 01:27:03,659
- Leave the lights off for five seconds.
- Yes. Not a second longer.

870
01:27:03,683 --> 01:27:08,271
Just long enough for the murderer to leave
the room. Understand? You quite clear?

871
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:10,106
Right, now we synchronize watches.

872
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:16,237
In seven seconds it will be precisely...

873
01:27:17,363 --> 01:27:19,407
2:43.

874
01:27:22,285 --> 01:27:26,748
- 2:43?
- Your watch must have stopped. I've 7:46.

875
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:29,208
Yes. 7:46, yes.

876
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:33,838
- No, no, no. Now it's nearly 7:47.
- Yes, all right. 7:47.

877
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:37,759
- Are we synchronizing on 7:47?
- That is what you said.

878
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:43,181
No, I said it was nearly.
I've now, ooh... ten seconds to 7:47.

879
01:27:44,265 --> 01:27:47,143
- I've got ten seconds after 7:47.
- You'll have to put your watch back.

880
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,896
- Yes, all right, all right.
- Five seconds.

881
01:27:50,104 --> 01:27:51,689
- Yes. Four.
- Four.

882
01:27:51,898 --> 01:27:52,982
Three.

883
01:27:53,191 --> 01:27:55,359
Two. One.

884
01:27:55,568 --> 01:27:56,944
Now.

885
01:27:58,488 --> 01:28:02,116
That's strange.
The second hand is not moving.

886
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:05,661
- It's ticking.
- It's moving now.

887
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:10,833
What? Yes. Yes, it is. Yes.
I know that. I can see that is moving now.

888
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:14,712
- And now I've 7:47 and 23 seconds.
- All right.

889
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:18,299
- Let's synchronize on 7:47 and a half.
- Very good.

890
01:28:18,508 --> 01:28:20,927
Five. Four.

891
01:28:21,135 --> 01:28:22,303
Three.

892
01:28:22,512 --> 01:28:24,514
Two. One.

893
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,226
- Now.
- My watch has stopped.

894
01:28:28,434 --> 01:28:30,603
Your watch has stopped?

895
01:28:30,812 --> 01:28:33,022
A remarkable coincidence.
It's stopped completely.

896
01:28:34,774 --> 01:28:35,942
Hmm.

897
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:39,403
- Look here. Take my watch.
- But, what about you?

898
01:28:39,612 --> 01:28:41,985
Don't worry.
I'll keep talking till the lights go out.

899
01:28:42,085 --> 01:28:43,758
But we still won't be synchronized.

900
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:48,246
Yes, it'll be all right. Don't worry.
I'll find a way out of it.

901
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:17,859
Very kind of you. There's no need
for you to stand. Please sit down.

902
01:29:20,236 --> 01:29:24,407
Now then. I expect you're wondering
why I've asked you all here.

903
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:26,909
Well, whatever the reason,
it's a damn nuisance.

904
01:29:27,118 --> 01:29:30,478
We usually have dinner at nine o'clock and
you've brought everything to a standstill.

905
01:29:30,788 --> 01:29:34,458
You will not be inconvenienced
for long, Monsieur Ballon.

906
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:45,803
Your clock has stopped,
Monsieur Ballon.

907
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:49,390
Yes, but if you want to know
the time, it's exactly 7:50.

908
01:29:49,599 --> 01:29:51,976
You are slow, darling.
It's 7:52.

909
01:29:52,768 --> 01:29:57,732
No, my love. This watch has not lost
a second since the day you gave it to me.

910
01:29:58,316 --> 01:29:59,984
I didn't give it to you.

911
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,697
I have 7:55, monsieur.

912
01:30:04,906 --> 01:30:07,408
- That is what I have.
- You are both fast.

913
01:30:07,617 --> 01:30:10,661
No, my watch is right.
I'll prove it to you.

914
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:16,918
Would you tell me
the right time, please?

915
01:30:17,919 --> 01:30:19,712
7:54. Thank you.

916
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:26,385
Yes? It's for you, Inspector.

917
01:30:27,011 --> 01:30:29,472
Ah, it's for me.

918
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:37,563
- Yes?
- What time is it?

919
01:30:37,772 --> 01:30:39,774
What?

920
01:30:40,524 --> 01:30:44,570
- Your watch has stopped.
- Where are you?

921
01:30:45,363 --> 01:30:48,115
In the basement. I had the
operator call this number.

922
01:30:48,324 --> 01:30:50,177
What do I do? I can't
pull the switch at eight o'clock

923
01:30:50,201 --> 01:30:51,494
if I don't know what time it is.

924
01:30:51,953 --> 01:30:55,164
- It's, uh, 7:54.
- 55 now.

925
01:30:55,373 --> 01:30:57,249
55 now, yes.

926
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:01,629
I just realized something.
I still won't know when it's eight o'clock.

927
01:31:02,046 --> 01:31:04,674
- Count.
- What?

928
01:31:04,966 --> 01:31:06,384
Count.

929
01:31:06,592 --> 01:31:09,095
Oh, count. You mean seconds?

930
01:31:09,303 --> 01:31:14,392
Yes, that is exactly what I mean,
and don't dare call me here again.

931
01:31:16,852 --> 01:31:17,852
Now then.

932
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:46,298
Now then. I will tell you...
why I have called you all here tonight.

933
01:31:47,508 --> 01:31:51,929
One of you... is a murderer.

934
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:03,315
36... 37...

935
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:05,735
38... 39.

936
01:32:07,153 --> 01:32:09,822
Before I name the killer...

937
01:32:10,823 --> 01:32:16,579
I will explain to you the facts
that led me to discover his...

938
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:19,874
or her... identity.

939
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:40,519
Now then.
The night the chauffeur was...

940
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:48,958
The night the chauffeur was killed.
What was the chauffeur's name?

941
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:51,155
- Migwell, yes.
- No, Miguel.

942
01:32:51,363 --> 01:32:53,866
- Migwell.
- Miguel.

943
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:56,452
- Well, this Italian...
- Well, he was a Spaniard.

944
01:32:58,162 --> 01:33:03,501
Well, this Spaniard, um, Mingwell,
he was furious with Maria Gambrelli.

945
01:33:03,709 --> 01:33:06,754
He tore her dress off.
He protested violently.

946
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:09,423
Argh! Ooh, my foot!

947
01:33:09,632 --> 01:33:14,386
I'm terribly sorry. I beg your pardon.
I did not notice her. Excuse me.

948
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:20,142
He tore her dress off, and at that
precise moment, the door opened...

949
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:24,688
and somebody...
somebody shot him.

950
01:33:24,897 --> 01:33:28,818
Now Maria could not see who the killer was
because she was unconscious.

951
01:33:29,026 --> 01:33:32,905
And the reason she was unconscious because
she had received a beump upon the head.

952
01:33:33,114 --> 01:33:35,157
A what?

953
01:33:35,366 --> 01:33:37,618
A beump.

954
01:33:37,827 --> 01:33:41,247
Now, there is only one way she could
have received a beump like that.

955
01:33:41,455 --> 01:33:43,874
She was hit upon the head
by an object,

956
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:47,336
and the object was the knob
on the closet door.

957
01:33:47,545 --> 01:33:50,798
Somebody was hiding
in that closet,

958
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:54,593
and when they opened the door
she received a beump upon the head.

959
01:33:54,802 --> 01:33:57,563
Oh, for heaven's sake, Inspector,
come to the point.

960
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:58,864
Don't tangle words with...

961
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:02,476
- Ow! You clumsy idiot!
- Sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

962
01:34:02,685 --> 01:34:04,103
Ow!

963
01:34:04,311 --> 01:34:06,021
Oh!

964
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:07,898
Oh, those feathers.

965
01:34:08,107 --> 01:34:12,027
Oh, I am coming, Maria, my darling.
My darling, I...

966
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:17,616
Ooh.

967
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:20,870
Careful, monsieur, with me.
Do not tangle with me.

968
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:25,374
I'm a trained expert in karate.
My hands are lethal weapons.

969
01:34:28,377 --> 01:34:29,795
Hmm.

970
01:34:31,589 --> 01:34:33,591
Now then.

971
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:39,847
There is something that I am very
interested to know. These rumors...

972
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:44,268
- What happened? What?
- You fell off the sofa, you stupid...

973
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:47,771
I know I fell off the sofa, madame.
There is no need to tell me.

974
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,816
Everything I do
is carefully planned, madame.

975
01:34:51,025 --> 01:34:52,610
I know that.

976
01:34:53,402 --> 01:34:54,653
Now, then.

977
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:56,488
Uh...

978
01:34:57,448 --> 01:35:00,117
What was I saying? uh...

979
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:04,288
Listen, you, you daydreaming fool.
What are you doing there? I mean...

980
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:07,392
Can't you pay attention when I'm talking?
Don't you know what I was saying?

981
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:08,476
You're not listening to me.

982
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,261
With the greatest respect, monsieur,
I heard every word that you said.

983
01:35:11,462 --> 01:35:14,039
Would you be kind enough to tell me
what it was that I said?

984
01:35:14,048 --> 01:35:16,450
You were talking about the closet,
monsieur.

985
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:17,593
Well, yes?

986
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:19,841
You were saying that when
the closet door was opened

987
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:21,305
Maria received a
bump on the head

988
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:24,767
and from that that you inferred
that someone had been hiding...

989
01:35:24,975 --> 01:35:27,728
She received a beump on...
And listen, monsieur.

990
01:35:27,937 --> 01:35:32,942
Next time I may test you without warning,
so pay attention at all times.

991
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:36,403
- Yes, monsieur.
- Now then.

992
01:35:36,612 --> 01:35:38,660
Whoever was in that closet,

993
01:35:38,656 --> 01:35:42,201
opened the door
and knocked Maria unconscious.

994
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:45,249
And whoever the man was
that was in that closet

995
01:35:45,269 --> 01:35:47,020
had a reason to be in that closet.

996
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:49,217
How do you know it was a man?

997
01:35:49,237 --> 01:35:52,336
Because we found his fingerprints,
Monsieur Ballon.

998
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:56,257
And... they were your fingerprints.

999
01:35:56,465 --> 01:35:59,176
Well, why not? It's my house.
I've often been in that closet.

1000
01:35:59,385 --> 01:36:01,679
- For what reason?
- Last time it was moths.

1001
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:02,972
Meuths?

1002
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,765
- Moths.
- Yes, meuths.

1003
01:36:04,974 --> 01:36:07,226
Maria was complaining of meuths.

1004
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:08,936
Meuths?

1005
01:36:09,103 --> 01:36:12,523
Is that right, Maria, that you were
complaining about these meuths?

1006
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:15,067
Yes, I did complain about moths.

1007
01:36:15,276 --> 01:36:18,237
Oh, you mean meuths. Yes, the
flying meuths, you mean.

1008
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,406
Yes, of course,
of course, of course.

1009
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:24,702
No, but what I do not understand is
that in a household of this size,

1010
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:28,163
the question of meuths should be brought
to the attention of Monsieur Ballon,

1011
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:31,500
not one of the servants
or the local meuth exterminator.

1012
01:36:31,709 --> 01:36:33,961
However, for the moment,
we will pass over that,

1013
01:36:34,128 --> 01:36:40,926
and we will continue to concentrate
on another type of local exterminator.

1014
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:12,791
212, 213, 214...

1015
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:17,129
Maria Gambrelli, even though
she now realizes it was a mistake,

1016
01:37:17,338 --> 01:37:21,833
is not a sort of a woman to have
an affair with a man and then expose him.

1017
01:37:21,942 --> 01:37:26,555
And we cannot condemn her, because
she does not believe this man was a killer.

1018
01:37:26,764 --> 01:37:29,383
But this man was not only a killer.

1019
01:37:29,491 --> 01:37:31,485
He was an unprincipled villain

1020
01:37:31,593 --> 01:37:35,847
who would rather see Maria Gambrelli go to
the guillotine than lose her to another man.

1021
01:37:35,956 --> 01:37:39,651
He was hiding in the closet when she
came into the room with the Spaniard.

1022
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,155
He opened the door, shot the Spaniard,
and put the gun in Maria's hand.

1023
01:37:43,364 --> 01:37:45,074
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1024
01:37:45,282 --> 01:37:47,701
- Benjamin. Shut up.
- I think that...

1025
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:49,665
You have something to say,
Monsieur Ballon?

1026
01:37:49,995 --> 01:37:51,580
He has nothing to say.

1027
01:37:51,789 --> 01:37:54,404
No, but she has.
Why don't you ask her?

1028
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:55,718
How dare you!

1029
01:37:56,794 --> 01:37:58,512
She was having an affair
with my husband.

1030
01:37:58,532 --> 01:37:59,371
Liar!

1031
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:02,340
You are a fine one to talk. Your husband
was having an affair with my wife.

1032
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:03,884
- Liar!
- Thank you, Pierre.

1033
01:38:04,093 --> 01:38:06,387
- And what about you?
What about you and Simone? - Oh, no!

1034
01:38:06,595 --> 01:38:08,347
- And what about you and Georges?
- Liar!

1035
01:38:08,555 --> 01:38:09,264
- You killed him!
- What?

1036
01:38:09,473 --> 01:38:11,466
I saw you go to the greenhouse
just before Maria.

1037
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:13,760
He's crazy!
Why should I kill Georges?

1038
01:38:13,769 --> 01:38:16,289
- Because you were having an affair with him.
- I should kill him for that?

1039
01:38:16,313 --> 01:38:18,899
You killed him because you knew
he was carrying on with Madame.

1040
01:38:19,108 --> 01:38:20,734
- I saw you kill Dudu.
- Liar!

1041
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:23,695
- I saw you.
- It's insane. Why should I kill Dudu?

1042
01:38:23,904 --> 01:38:28,158
Because you discovered... you discovered
that she was having an affair with Pierre.

1043
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:29,827
- That's not true.
- She told me.

1044
01:38:30,035 --> 01:38:31,346
Ah, yes, yes, yes,
of course she told you,

1045
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:33,414
because you and Dudu
were blackmailing the Madame.

1046
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:36,792
- You liar!
- She told me! She saw Madame kill Miguel.

1047
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,280
- Shut up!
- That's not possible.

1048
01:38:38,377 --> 01:38:38,836
- What was that?
- What?

1049
01:38:39,044 --> 01:38:41,754
Georges told me he saw Monsieur Ballon
climbing out of Maria's window

1050
01:38:41,774 --> 01:38:42,804
right after the shooting.

1051
01:38:42,965 --> 01:38:44,007
Well, I didn't kill him.

1052
01:38:44,258 --> 01:38:45,735
- I was the one in the closet.
- Oh ho!

1053
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:48,971
My wife expected to find me with Maria
and shot Miguel by accident.

1054
01:38:49,179 --> 01:38:50,994
I put the gun in Maria's hand
to protect my wife.

1055
01:38:50,994 --> 01:38:52,909
I arrest you for
putting the gun in Maria's hand.

1056
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:56,186
- Oh, you keep out of this.
- You self-righteous hypocrite. You...

1057
01:38:56,395 --> 01:38:57,956
- What about Henri?
- Well, what about Henri?

1058
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:59,940
- You killed him.
- Why should I kill him?

1059
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:01,989
- I arrest you.
- I saw you put the... shut up!

1060
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:04,319
I saw you put the gun,
drag his body into Maria's room.

1061
01:39:04,528 --> 01:39:05,904
- It was you.
- Yes, it was.

1062
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:09,241
- Why should I kill Henri?
- It's alright, darling.

1063
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:21,420
298, 299.

1064
01:39:25,048 --> 01:39:26,800
Hercule, turn on the lights.

1065
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,101
Let me in, Benjamin. Ow!

1066
01:39:38,854 --> 01:39:40,314
No!

1067
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:45,152
No! Stop! Come back, you fools!

1068
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,360
Come back!

1069
01:39:46,487 --> 01:39:47,488
Clouseau!

1070
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:49,281
- Stop them. Stop them!
- What?

1071
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:51,241
- The bomb!
- The what?

1072
01:39:54,536 --> 01:39:56,038
The bomb?

1073
01:39:58,165 --> 01:39:59,249
It was meant for you.

1074
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:02,294
What do you mean it was
meant for me, Commissioner?

1075
01:40:02,503 --> 01:40:04,963
The doorman, the two customers
and the Cossack,

1076
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:08,300
and now, six more
innocent people.

1077
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:11,803
They were all murderers, except Maurice
who was a blackmailer, Commissioner.

1078
01:40:12,012 --> 01:40:16,475
- Compared with you they were all saints.
- Commissioner, what are you doing?

1079
01:40:16,683 --> 01:40:18,977
- I hate you, Clouseau.
- Commissioner, please.

1080
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:20,186
I hate you.

1081
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:22,564
Commissioner, what are you
doing to me? Let go of me.

1082
01:40:22,773 --> 01:40:25,901
Let... Commissioner, let go of my leg.

1083
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:30,072
Hercule! Get him off me.

1084
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,699
- Commissioner. Commissioner.
- Commissioner. Commissioner.

1085
01:40:34,868 --> 01:40:38,372
Argh, Commissioner!

1086
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:54,179
Jacques.

1087
01:40:55,639 --> 01:40:58,517
Jacques? Are you all right?

1088
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,479
It's all over now, darling.

1089
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:04,690
You're free.

1090
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,325
Argh!

1091
01:41:15,826 --> 01:41:17,786
Whoa!
