1
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:10,468
Give it over, Michael.

2
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:13,761
Thanks.

3
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,440
Rose!

4
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:24,151
- Yours?
- Aye.

5
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,484
My dad got it when they
sold up Lady Pawson's.

6
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:28,322
Lady Pawson, is it?

7
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:35,168
Fine fish, Michael.

8
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:39,251
Give him a smile and you'll maybe
get one of the claws for your supper.

9
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,342
Michael!

10
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:50,429
I've told you, Michael,
they're created creatures!

11
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:54,479
Get off!

12
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,356
It'll make me sick!

13
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,737
Poor Mike's no answer to
a young maid's dreams...

14
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:09,947
but do you not think he
just possibly knows that?

15
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:12,660
I can't abide him, Father Hugh.

16
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,539
You used to ride to
school on his back.

17
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:18,498
- I can walk for myself now.
- Aye.

18
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,040
Where are you walking this
afternoon dressed up like that?

19
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:25,218
- Nowhere precisely.
- Just so.

20
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:29,630
What do you do, Rose, mooning
about all day by yourself?

21
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:31,846
Read.

22
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:46,614
- Well, I wasn't really reading it.
- You're doing nothing, then?

23
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:51,236
- I suppose so.
- Have you nothing to do?

24
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,824
Precisely that!

25
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:58,918
Well, Miss Precisely, that's a pity.

26
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:02,958
Doing nothing is a
dangerous occupation!

27
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:57,760
Morning.

28
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:04,017
- Blowy day?
- That's right, Corporal.

29
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,486
It's the wind.

30
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,858
Only want to be friendly, kids.

31
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:12,365
Then go back to London
and write us a letter.

32
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,491
- Don't come from London, love.
- Go anyway.

33
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:30,342
- Morning, Mr. O'Connor.
- Good morning to you, Corporal.

34
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:32,712
Will you listen to that now?

35
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:37,974
Aren't the police a dirty lot,
hobnobbing with the British soldiers?

36
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,731
I heard that, Maureen Cassidy.

37
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:44,515
You were meant to, Constable O'Connor.

38
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,695
Hey, Michael!

39
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:52,363
Michael, darling, show us your fish.

40
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:58,028
How much does he weigh then, Mike?

41
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,536
How long is it, Michael?

42
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,715
I've never seen a
lobster the equal of that.

43
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:13,380
- Michael, can I touch it?
- Come here and show it to us, Michael.

44
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:14,800
Michael.

45
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:09,647
Now what? Now what?

46
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,744
What am I to do with you? What?

47
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:23,583
- Actually it's only a bit of fun, Father.
- Fun?

48
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:27,665
Are you brainless,
Maureen Cassidy, or what?

49
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:32,587
Fun.

50
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,842
Devil take me if the lot of
you is not possessed and damned.

51
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,840
I don't know what's the matter
with the youngsters in this place.

52
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:19,945
I don't at all.

53
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:24,992
Their talk is filthy, their doings
are secret, and cruelty for fun.

54
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,449
Unemployment is the matter
with them, Father Hugh.

55
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:31,163
It's the deliberate policy
of the British government...

56
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,625
that Irish youngsters
shall corrupt in idleness.

57
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,671
Well, it's working fine.

58
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:40,546
I just seen your Rosy
loafing about the beach again.

59
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:44,807
How much you give for
that black lace umbrella?

60
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,761
Three and six.

61
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:50,061
You'll ruin that girl.

62
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:54,775
It's time she had a fellow of her own,
Tom. A house of her own. Floors to scrub.

63
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,311
My princess isn't interested
in fellows, Father.

64
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,152
Your princess has
fellows enough in here.

65
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,179
And fellows running loose in
there will do a girl more damage...

66
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,825
than a barrack full of drunk dragoons.

67
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,779
Well...

68
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:14,501
if there's one of that lot as is fit for
her, maybe you'll point him out, Father.

69
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,601
Rose.

70
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,483
Mr. Shaughnessy.

71
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:45,321
Well...

72
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,078
this is nice, Rose.

73
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:50,868
Well, you're back, then?

74
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,915
Yes, I'm back, and I...

75
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,216
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

76
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,933
I came to meet you.

77
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,569
Well, that was kind.

78
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,898
A party of us went to a couple
of concerts while we were there.

79
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,696
I saved you the programs.

80
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:33,915
- "The Royal Philharmonic."
- Berlioz and Tchaikovsky.

81
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,085
- No Beethoven?
- No Beethoven.

82
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:39,543
Do you know that the British
government has got a law now...

83
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:42,301
- forbidding the playing of German music?
- No.

84
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:45,919
- Can you imagine such foolishness?
- British.

85
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,930
Well, all governments
is foolish, more or less.

86
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:51,305
An Irish government would be the same.

87
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,849
Well, maybe.

88
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:55,979
Thank you.

89
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,357
- You enjoyed yourself in Dublin, then?
- Well, I did and I didn't.

90
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:05,897
A conference of village school
teachers, you know, is not exactly a...

91
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:09,158
- Bacchanalia?
- Bacchanalia. Precisely.

92
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,492
We did have some interesting
discussions, though.

93
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:16,958
There was a lady teacher among us
from Belfast, a stimulating woman.

94
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,117
Oh.

95
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,465
- Did she come to the concert?
- She had the score.

96
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:29,336
In what way, precisely,
was she stimulating?

97
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:33,678
She had a fine and fresh mind,
Rose. Very modern in her thoughts.

98
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,897
She'd been at the
teaching for over 50 years.

99
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,688
Old folk with fresh minds
are very stimulating.

100
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:46,361
Then there was a ministry
inspector, he gave us an address...

101
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,337
But the best we had was this
professor from the Sorbonne.

102
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:04,711
Now, there was a man
with a mind, if you like.

103
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,383
- Why? What did he say?
- I couldn't tell you, Rose.

104
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,175
Whatever it was, it was wasted on us.

105
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,886
Teachers are a poor lot, surely.

106
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:18,386
If teachers were the poor lot,
like you're always making out...

107
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,481
how would the pupils
be learning such riches?

108
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,315
What?

109
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:30,027
Some young fellow's
going to be a lucky man.

110
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,752
- Rose?
- I've something in my eye.

111
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,703
Rose.

112
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:52,257
The nuisance.

113
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:57,096
- Will I get it out, then?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

114
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,763
It's only the wind.

115
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:05,317
- Are you away to the schoolhouse, then?
- No, Rose, I think...

116
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:08,569
I'll scramble up the dunes
and pay my respects to my wife.

117
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:09,770
Oh, yes.

118
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:11,604
Good day, Rose.

119
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,068
Good day, Mr. Shaughnessy.

120
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:54,135
Hello, Michael.

121
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,174
- Shaughnessy.
- There you are, Mr. Shaughnessy.

122
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:04,103
So, you're back again, Charles.

123
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,679
Home is the voyager,
safe from the sea.

124
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,850
- The usual?
- Thanks.

125
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,314
And...

126
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,311
what did you see in Dublin?

127
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:16,074
- You mean, the trouble?
- What else?

128
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:18,067
Well, nothing, really.

129
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,743
- Did you not go and see Sackville Street?
- I passed it, yes.

130
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,321
- Passed it?
- Well, I'll be damned.

131
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,538
What did you see as
you passed it, Charles?

132
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:30,498
- It did look terrible smashed about, Father.
- It's true, then.

133
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:32,831
- The Government used guns.
- I've not said that, Father.

134
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:36,543
All right, you've not said
anything. What did you hear?

135
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:39,089
I heard they used heavy guns...

136
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:41,589
like them they're using on the
Western Front against the Germans.

137
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:43,842
And our poor lads pursued
from house to house...

138
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:46,012
with not one rifle between three.

139
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:47,931
Now, if the Germans
had an ounce of sense...

140
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:49,863
they'd send us guns to
use against the British.

141
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,979
That's treason you're talking.

142
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,977
And friends that are
listening surely to God.

143
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,020
It's foolish, all the same. You'll
blather yourself into jug some day.

144
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:01,494
Charles, what do they say they'll do
with the lads they've got in prison?

145
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,744
They say they'll hang them, Father.

146
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,409
Good luck to all Irishmen.

147
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:11,872
Bad luck to the British.
Success to the Germans.

148
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:13,162
And...

149
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,795
And a very good morning
to you, Corporal.

150
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:20,378
Two black stouts, please, Mr. Ryan.

151
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:22,677
And one for yourself?

152
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,684
Well, seeing you're a man
of wealth, Corporal, yes.

153
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,391
- Father?
- No.

154
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:32,191
- Mr. Shaughnessy? -
Well, I don't mind if I-

155
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:37,355
No, I'd best be on my way. Term
is starting tomorrow, you know...

156
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,125
It seems the Jerries...

157
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:52,792
are giving your brave lads out
there a terrible scrimmage, then.

158
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,710
Aye.

159
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:59,383
You see, Tom, Jerry's
a tougher proposition...

160
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,758
than unarmed Irish children.

161
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:05,966
So far as I know, Mr. McCardle,
no children were killed.

162
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:09,391
All right, then. There were.

163
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:16,608
They get you in this uniform.

164
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,897
You point your gun where
you're told to point it...

165
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:20,567
and you pull the trigger.

166
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,449
And so does Jerry.

167
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:26,572
And so would you.

168
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:35,915
You've seen that place,
Passchendaele, maybe?

169
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:39,089
No, not Passchendaele.

170
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:43,043
- You're well out of it, Corporal.
- That's right.

171
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:02,337
Well, duty calls.

172
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:05,127
Good day, Charles.

173
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,933
Well, good day.

174
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:16,479
Welcome home.

175
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:22,984
Will you imagine that fellow?

176
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:26,191
A fortnight in Dublin.
Does nothing, sees nothing.

177
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,201
It's working with children,
makes a man childish.

178
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:32,821
No, it was that wife of his,
knocked all the spirit out of him.

179
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,907
She was a good, pure woman.

180
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:39,334
- Pure, she was.
- Is that nothing?

181
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,331
Oh, no. No.

182
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:56,286
Well, did you come to
lend me a hand, then?

183
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:05,293
Well, now, let's see. For a
start, you could put the kettle on.

184
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:11,301
I didn't come for that at all.

185
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:15,259
I've come to say something.

186
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:20,392
I feel like a child in this place.

187
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:24,355
And I'm not a child.

188
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:26,103
Do you know that?

189
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:30,650
I know that.

190
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,944
Rose, I've...

191
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:37,159
maybe an idea of what you came to say.

192
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:39,914
You have no idea at all.

193
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:44,870
Well, I'm just saying, in case
it helps a bit, I maybe have.

194
00:28:53,222 --> 00:28:54,597
I love you.

195
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:05,308
- Will you come inside?
- No.

196
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:08,644
Will you sit down, then?

197
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:11,062
- Why?
- I'd like to talk to you, Rose.

198
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:17,784
Well, I know what that means.

199
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:26,501
Rose, this sort of thing
can come about, you know...

200
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:29,079
a girl taking a fancy to a teacher.

201
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:32,424
- Thanks.
- Fancy's all it is, Rose.

202
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:38,884
Rose, you've mistaken a
penny mirror for the sun.

203
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,518
Do you not see that?

204
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:44,519
I see you always digging
a low pit for yourself...

205
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:47,560
when you should be
standing on a heap of pride.

206
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,239
Well, Rose...

207
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,540
your coming here today and
saying what you've said...

208
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:04,197
is the only cause I've
ever had for pride.

209
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:09,129
Don't you see, Rose? I
only taught you about...

210
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:14,042
Byron and Beethoven and Captain Blood.
I'm not one of them fellows myself.

211
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:17,216
- I'm not daft, you know.
- But you're terribly young.

212
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:21,303
- Aye, and that's a hanging matter, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

213
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,267
Well, then?

214
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,028
It's not a hanging
matter to be young...

215
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:41,696
but it maybe should be a hanging
matter for a man of middle age...

216
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:44,458
to try and steal the
youth from a young girl.

217
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:49,037
Especially a man like
me and a girl like you.

218
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:57,422
You were meant for the wide world,
Rose, not this place, not this.

219
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:59,886
Me, I was born for it.

220
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:03,350
It wouldn't do, Rose.

221
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:05,894
I just know it wouldn't.

222
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,736
So you don't want me, then?

223
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:31,546
Don't want you?

224
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:35,538
- Yes.
- Oh.

225
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:19,635
Would you like a fat pheasant,
Constable? It'll cost you nothing.

226
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,388
Whoa.

227
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:30,146
He recognized you.

228
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,603
- Well, you'll have
to be quick... Shut up!

229
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:49,867
Bring the cart!

230
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:53,414
Jesus.

231
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:11,156
- Fine pair of gunrunners we are.
- Come on.

232
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:51,117
We'll never walk to
the coast, Commandant.

233
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:54,206
- It's 200 miles.
- We'll walk to Limerick.

234
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,864
- Limerick?
- The lads are waiting for us.

235
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,286
- Oh.
- And cheer up, Pat.

236
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:01,621
They're waiting with a lorry.

237
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,324
About 30 fellows.

238
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:05,482
Now...

239
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:10,610
marriage is a sacrament ordained
by God. That means, Rosy...

240
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,699
once it's done, it's not up to me,
nor you, nor Charles. It's done...

241
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:18,406
- till one or other of you is dead.
- I understand that.

242
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:22,534
God ordained it for three reasons.

243
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:27,121
First, that Charles and you should
be a comfort to each other...

244
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:30,551
in the long, dull days
and the weary evenings.

245
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,595
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

246
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:38,643
Secondly, for the procreation of children,
and to bring them up as good Catholics.

247
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,805
- Well, you understand that.
- Yes.

248
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,481
And, thirdly...

249
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,936
- for the satisfaction of the flesh.
- Yes.

250
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,981
Are you scared of that?

251
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,158
Yes.

252
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:56,572
It's nothing to be scared of,
Rosy. A function of the body.

253
00:36:58,457 --> 00:37:01,541
I suppose all girls
is a bit scared before.

254
00:37:01,627 --> 00:37:03,121
And fellows, too.

255
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:04,955
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

256
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:12,084
It will make me a
different person, won't it?

257
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:16,046
- Marriage?
- No, the satisfaction of the flesh.

258
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:18,976
That's a gate I have not
been through myself...

259
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:22,431
but, no, it won't make
you a different person.

260
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,483
I want it to.

261
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,603
Child, what are you expecting?

262
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:49,918
Wings, is it?

263
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,724
All right, try it.

264
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,882
Seven boats. All currachs.

265
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,469
One thing at a time. Keep a look out.

266
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,015
Top of the morning, Father.

267
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:49,812
Morning!

268
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,698
- Morning, Father.
- Morning, tinker.

269
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:11,789
You'll find nothing much here. It all
gets carried round the head to Killins.

270
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:13,045
Ah.

271
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,886
- Good luck with it, anyway.
- Thanks, Father.

272
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:24,677
And if them two's tinkers,
I'm the Bishop of Cork.

273
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:31,307
Now, we'll have one
light on the beacon...

274
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:33,485
and one on the cliff.

275
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,858
- What now, then? Back to Dublin?
- Tomorrow.

276
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:39,658
I want to see what Ryan's like.

277
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,876
Are you not done, Mrs. McCardle?

278
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:54,538
Easy, Mr. Ryan, dear.
They'll not start without her.

279
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:56,832
Women.

280
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,974
Tim, did you review the volunteers
in Phoenix Park before the war?

281
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,058
- Yes, why?
- Will you come here?

282
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:27,121
Aye, you're looking
at me picture, lads.

283
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:29,829
Here.

284
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:42,004
You recognize someone?

285
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:46,299
- That's yourself, landlord.
- It is.

286
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,552
And he that has me by the hand...

287
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:52,520
- is Commandant Tim O'Leary.
- Never.

288
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,567
Red Tim himself. That
1,000 secret policemen...

289
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,812
have been hunting for
these last five years.

290
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:02,571
And himself, no doubt at this very moment
walking the broad streets of Dublin.

291
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:06,491
- He's a brave man, surely.
- Nerves of steel.

292
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,330
You know him well, then?

293
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:17,545
- I get my orders from time to time.
- Landlord, you're a desperate man.

294
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,053
I'll tell you something.

295
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:27,676
- Come on then, Mr. Ryan.
- Right, ma'am.

296
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:30,600
Good luck to the young lady.

297
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:34,393
Talk.

298
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:38,563
This whole cursed country
will capsize with talk.

299
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,111
The locals are no good.

300
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,242
I'll have to bring you some
hard lads from Dublin...

301
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,209
when the time comes.

302
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:57,082
- When will that be, Commandant?
- I don't know.

303
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,789
Depends on our clever lads in Germany.

304
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,548
And they're great talkers, too.

305
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:21,109
With this ring, I thee wed.

306
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,900
With this ring, I thee wed.

307
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:27,026
In the name of the Father...

308
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:28,782
the Son...

309
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:31,613
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

310
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:38,797
This gold and silver, I give thee...

311
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:40,873
token of all my worldly goods.

312
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,819
Good night, Father Hugh.

313
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:14,235
Good night, Rosy.

314
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:40,342
Well, is no one going
to kiss the bride?

315
00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:00,199
Steady, lads. Steady!

316
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:14,846
Get off out of it!

317
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,896
Enough. Now, cut it out.

318
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:41,659
Now, then. That's
enough. Come on, boys.

319
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,084
That's enough.

320
00:46:45,794 --> 00:46:47,917
Now, lads, that's enough.

321
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:07,314
- Lucky man, and how are you feeling?
- Lucky.

322
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:09,308
Are you all right, princess?

323
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:12,442
It was only their bit of fun.

324
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,445
Good night, Father.

325
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,079
Good night, Rosy.

326
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:25,449
Now, go on, away in with you.

327
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:33,291
Well, you'll be away early
in the morning, I suppose?

328
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,423
We will, yes, Mr. Ryan.

329
00:49:24,953 --> 00:49:27,195
You're a wonderful girl, Rose.

330
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,744
No.

331
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,668
No, I'm not.

332
00:50:57,546 --> 00:50:59,704
Charles, how you getting on?

333
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:02,372
Them fellows has an
elegant sense of humor.

334
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,258
It doesn't matter.

335
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:41,381
Charles, get a handful of this.

336
00:51:56,688 --> 00:51:58,231
Now, come away.

337
00:53:49,384 --> 00:53:52,255
- Rose?
- Yes?

338
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:54,054
Are you all right?

339
00:53:55,474 --> 00:53:56,553
Yes.

340
00:53:57,726 --> 00:54:01,142
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Charles.

341
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:28,430
Rose?

342
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:32,110
I got you these.

343
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,199
They're all growing, see?

344
00:55:42,581 --> 00:55:46,495
- When did you do it?
- Last thing yesterday. Just before church.

345
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:52,712
Charles, you're a rare man.

346
00:55:57,805 --> 00:55:59,180
Well done.

347
00:56:00,265 --> 00:56:02,507
- Here, no.
- They're not heavy.

348
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,564
I can't believe you're here.

349
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:19,659
Well, I am.

350
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:24,492
Well, now.

351
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:03,870
Beethoven.

352
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,105
I...

353
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:22,148
I don't think you care
much for my flowers, do you?

354
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,858
I like them better growing, surely.

355
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:28,871
Well, sure, things are better growing.

356
00:59:02,614 --> 00:59:04,987
I'm afraid you're too
late for snapdragons.

357
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:08,242
Well, I'll put in some
lilies, then. I like them.

358
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:14,079
- What's the matter?
- My shirt, Rose. I'd like to get my shirt.

359
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:16,659
Charles, you're fine as you are.

360
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,457
Well, all right, Rose.

361
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,093
I don't know, Rose,
suppose somebody came in.

362
00:59:32,186 --> 00:59:33,300
Charles.

363
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:38,107
- You're always on about if someone came.
- Well, it's not decent.

364
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:40,350
- Decent.
- Well, it's not, you know.

365
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,653
All right, then.

366
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:50,028
I'm sorry, Charles.

367
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:51,950
Put it on.

368
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,824
No. What does it matter?

369
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,745
No, you're right. Please, put it on.

370
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:02,625
No, well, I'll be
out again in a minute.

371
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,136
Six ones are six.

372
01:00:11,225 --> 01:00:13,301
Six twos are twelve.

373
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:16,217
Six threes are eighteen.

374
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,721
Six fours are twenty-four.

375
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,974
Six fives are thirty.

376
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:23,191
Six sixes are thirty-six.

377
01:00:23,278 --> 01:00:25,604
Six sevens are forty-two.

378
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:27,773
Six eights are forty-eight.

379
01:00:27,866 --> 01:00:29,823
- Six nines are...
- Fifty-four.

380
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,653
Fifty-four.

381
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:33,868
Six tens are sixty.

382
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:36,198
Six elevens are sixty-six.

383
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,916
Six twelves are...

384
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,414
Seventy-two.

385
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:46,171
Now, your work is on the board.
You've all got your pencils.

386
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,759
There's no need for talking,
Kathleen. Now get on with it.

387
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:50,926
Get on.

388
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:00,394
Rose?

389
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,381
Rose.

390
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:50,859
- Where are you going, Rosy?
- Nowhere.

391
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:53,571
You're in the devil of a hurry there.

392
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,404
Now, stop.

393
01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:01,118
Now, what exactly is the
trouble between you and Charles?

394
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:02,752
No. No trouble.

395
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,338
Are you asking me to
believe you're happy?

396
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,590
- I'm not asking you anything.
- Are you happy?

397
01:02:11,887 --> 01:02:12,918
No.

398
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:14,962
Why not?

399
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:17,301
I don't know.

400
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:21,093
- Come on, Rosy, now give me a try.
- I don't.

401
01:02:21,188 --> 01:02:22,351
All right.

402
01:02:22,856 --> 01:02:25,478
Because I am stupid and conceited...

403
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:28,402
and self-centered and ungrateful
like you've always told me.

404
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:30,167
For I have everything
I wanted, have I not?

405
01:02:30,197 --> 01:02:31,442
You have!

406
01:02:31,698 --> 01:02:35,613
- What more are you wanting now?
- I don't know that, either.

407
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:37,695
- That's a lie.
- It's not.

408
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:41,076
How can I know?

409
01:02:44,086 --> 01:02:46,755
I don't even know what more there is.

410
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:01,259
- You've got a good man now, haven't you?
- The best.

411
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:03,013
Well?

412
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:05,726
And you've got enough
money. Not much, but enough.

413
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:06,895
Aye.

414
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,569
And you've got your health.

415
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,313
- You're not sick?
- No.

416
01:03:11,405 --> 01:03:14,074
There is nothing more,
you graceless girl.

417
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:16,945
- But, there is.
- There is not.

418
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:18,530
I know there is.

419
01:03:19,788 --> 01:03:22,410
- There must be, Father Hugh.
- Why?

420
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:26,912
Glory be to God, why must there
be? Because Rosy Ryan wants it?

421
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:29,710
Aye.

422
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:50,685
Have you got any warm old clothes,
Rosy? Poor Patsy Wheelan's in a bad way.

423
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:53,895
I'll find some, Father.

424
01:03:55,491 --> 01:03:56,736
Thanks.

425
01:04:04,082 --> 01:04:07,202
Rosy, don't nurse your wishes.

426
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:10,160
You can't help having them,
but don't nurse them...

427
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:13,256
or sure to God, you'll get
what you're wishing for.

428
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:10,659
Major Doryan, sir.

429
01:06:13,796 --> 01:06:16,333
Sorry, sir, I had to change a wheel.

430
01:06:21,762 --> 01:06:22,793
Sir.

431
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,788
Get in.

432
01:07:01,176 --> 01:07:02,291
In!

433
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:21,747
Come on, kids, out of it.

434
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:50,610
You were in Second Battle of
the Marne, weren't you, sir?

435
01:08:50,702 --> 01:08:53,372
- Yes.
- So was I, sir.

436
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:57,659
- Yes?
- It was too much for me, sir.

437
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:00,420
I reckon that's why they sent me here.

438
01:09:00,671 --> 01:09:02,628
Camp coming up, sir.

439
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:17,592
Slope...

440
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:18,968
arms.

441
01:09:30,993 --> 01:09:32,535
Capt. Smith, sir.

442
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:33,699
Hey.

443
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:49,134
That's all we're short of,
that is. A crippled bloody hero.

444
01:10:04,693 --> 01:10:05,974
Well, now, sir.

445
01:10:06,695 --> 01:10:10,479
This is our communication
with the outside world.

446
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:17,244
Field telephone to the police
station down the village.

447
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,492
Now, then. Records.

448
01:10:25,464 --> 01:10:27,871
Hello? Constable O'Connor here.

449
01:10:27,966 --> 01:10:31,667
- Were you calling?
- No, no, Constable, just testing.

450
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,554
Well, now, sir, where was I?

451
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:39,885
Oh, aye. Records. Records. Transport.

452
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:42,894
They're sending a...

453
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:45,223
Well, I guess you'd
better see your room.

454
01:10:49,738 --> 01:10:51,778
Well, now, duty.

455
01:10:51,865 --> 01:10:54,403
Our duties are light.

456
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:55,987
Oh, good lad, Jimmy.

457
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:59,454
Jimmy will look after you
right nicely, Major Doryan.

458
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:07,042
Tired?

459
01:11:08,382 --> 01:11:09,413
Yes.

460
01:11:09,716 --> 01:11:13,299
- That leg gives you gyp, don't it?
- Yes.

461
01:11:14,596 --> 01:11:17,087
Sent you here for a rest, did they?

462
01:11:17,933 --> 01:11:20,091
Yes, I think they did.

463
01:11:20,185 --> 01:11:24,397
Well, you'll get that, if naught else.
There's nothing to do here but walk.

464
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:27,520
Oh, I'm sorry. I expect walking's out.

465
01:11:27,985 --> 01:11:30,820
No, I'm supposed to
walk. Five miles a day.

466
01:11:31,447 --> 01:11:34,447
Oh. Well, then. They've
sent you to the right place.

467
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,526
There's some nice walks here.

468
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:39,109
Our duties are light
enough, God knows.

469
01:11:39,955 --> 01:11:43,122
Our duties. It's more
like police work, isn't it?

470
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:48,039
The publican's a
source of information.

471
01:11:49,047 --> 01:11:53,092
- An informer?
- Aye. Publican, name of Ryan.

472
01:11:53,177 --> 01:11:55,715
Well, he's nothing to inform, has he?

473
01:11:55,804 --> 01:11:59,636
But the police slip him a
fiver now and then, you know.

474
01:12:01,769 --> 01:12:03,429
Oh, he's all right.

475
01:12:03,854 --> 01:12:06,855
Big mouth, open hand,
empty pocket, you know?

476
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:09,977
Typical publican. But
he's all right, really.

477
01:12:10,736 --> 01:12:12,527
- Jimmy.
- Sir?

478
01:12:12,613 --> 01:12:14,855
- Are my bags on the lorry?
- Yes, sir.

479
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,700
I'll be straight off, if
it's all the same, sir.

480
01:12:19,787 --> 01:12:22,704
- I've given myself leave.
- Yes?

481
01:12:22,915 --> 01:12:24,575
Embarkation leave.

482
01:12:27,252 --> 01:12:28,497
France.

483
01:12:32,174 --> 01:12:34,665
Second battalion,
Southeast Lancashires.

484
01:12:35,803 --> 01:12:37,842
They're in the front line.

485
01:12:43,018 --> 01:12:45,426
Will you tell me
something, man to man?

486
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,722
What's it like, really?

487
01:12:48,816 --> 01:12:50,191
Front line?

488
01:12:58,242 --> 01:13:00,649
Aye. Well...

489
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:03,033
I'll find out soon enough.

490
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:09,583
I'm a coward, you see.

491
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:12,747
No, I always have been.

492
01:13:13,257 --> 01:13:14,881
From being a lad.

493
01:13:16,301 --> 01:13:18,211
I can't master it.

494
01:13:18,303 --> 01:13:21,340
Well, perhaps I've
never tried, really.

495
01:13:22,224 --> 01:13:25,474
But, I'd give my left arm to
have a bit of what you've got.

496
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,103
I hate it.

497
01:13:27,187 --> 01:13:30,390
Just the bloody thought
of it gives me the shakes.

498
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,817
That's my nightmare, as a
matter of fact, the shakes.

499
01:13:34,903 --> 01:13:36,611
I don't mind dying.

500
01:13:37,114 --> 01:13:40,779
Not if it's quick. Life's
not that much, is it?

501
01:13:42,744 --> 01:13:45,414
I wouldn't mind a gammy
leg like you've got.

502
01:13:45,497 --> 01:13:47,739
Though I don't suppose it's funny.

503
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,113
But the shakes?

504
01:13:49,918 --> 01:13:51,496
Shellshock.

505
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:56,458
Just shaking and shambling
like a epileptic baby.

506
01:13:58,135 --> 01:14:00,127
Nay, I'd rather be dead.

507
01:14:02,598 --> 01:14:04,555
I can see what's coming.

508
01:14:05,476 --> 01:14:07,717
I'm going to disgrace myself.

509
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:15,440
You don't know what you'll do.

510
01:14:15,527 --> 01:14:18,730
No one does. You don't
know what you're doing.

511
01:14:24,328 --> 01:14:25,526
Really?

512
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,954
I read what you did in the newspapers.

513
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,161
That were no flash in the pan.

514
01:14:36,131 --> 01:14:38,669
You'd do the same again, I dare say.

515
01:14:39,718 --> 01:14:40,916
You'd be wrong.

516
01:14:43,486 --> 01:14:46,986
Well, you've done your bit.

517
01:14:47,073 --> 01:14:49,481
It's someone else's turn now, eh?

518
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:00,578
Oh, dear. You look
about finished, sir.

519
01:15:01,588 --> 01:15:02,703
Here.

520
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,545
Good stuff, this. Cheap, too.

521
01:15:15,769 --> 01:15:17,643
That's the generator.

522
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:21,394
The bloody thing stays on all
night, but you'll get used to that.

523
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:30,485
This your house?

524
01:15:32,244 --> 01:15:34,651
- Yes.
- Well, I never.

525
01:15:36,456 --> 01:15:38,781
- Wife?
- Yes.

526
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:41,283
- May I?
- Please.

527
01:15:43,588 --> 01:15:44,703
Oh.

528
01:15:45,257 --> 01:15:46,667
Bonny woman.

529
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,920
Thank you.

530
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:53,756
- She'll be coming out, then?
- No, I don't think so.

531
01:15:59,437 --> 01:16:01,145
There's no local crumpet.

532
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,562
It's married or virgin here, you know.

533
01:16:06,152 --> 01:16:09,771
And that priest down there has
got eyes in the back of his head.

534
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:13,815
It gets bloody lonely here.

535
01:16:14,035 --> 01:16:15,993
Why not have her out?

536
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:21,907
Sorry.

537
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,830
Fools rush in, eh?

538
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:31,963
You're probably better
on your own a bit.

539
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:33,334
Excuse me.

540
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,847
I'll pop back to say goodbye.

541
01:17:11,051 --> 01:17:12,759
It's him.

542
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,782
Peg leg.

543
01:18:24,624 --> 01:18:25,703
Sir?

544
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:27,552
Excuse me, I didn't
realize you were serving.

545
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,207
Well, I'm just minding.
What did you want?

546
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:32,204
Whiskey.

547
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,350
Water?

548
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:54,144
Did you want water?

549
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:55,978
Please.

550
01:18:59,993 --> 01:19:01,321
Thank you.

551
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,880
I must open the door.

552
01:23:40,899 --> 01:23:42,642
Sit, please.

553
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:57,203
- Is this where you live?
- What?

554
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:58,998
Is this where you live?

555
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,290
- I live at the schoolhouse.
- Schoolhouse?

556
01:24:07,926 --> 01:24:11,377
- I'm married to the teacher.
- Oh.

557
01:24:15,141 --> 01:24:16,386
They're back.

558
01:24:20,605 --> 01:24:24,935
- I don't know your name.
- Shaughnessy, Rose Shaughnessy.

559
01:24:28,113 --> 01:24:31,861
Come away in, then.
One round on the house!

560
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,444
That's my dad.

561
01:24:34,953 --> 01:24:38,073
Your father is the publican?

562
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:39,789
Yes, why not?

563
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:57,473
Now, I can't just say
you're very welcome, sir.

564
01:24:57,851 --> 01:25:00,852
Not in your official function.

565
01:25:00,937 --> 01:25:04,271
But in yourself, you're welcome.

566
01:25:04,357 --> 01:25:07,892
A brave man is a brave
man in any uniform.

567
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:12,779
English khaki, Irish
green, aye, or German gray.

568
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:18,694
Aye, you've a large mind, sir.

569
01:25:18,997 --> 01:25:20,491
Put it there.

570
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,292
You've met my daughter, then?

571
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:28,120
Yes.

572
01:25:28,632 --> 01:25:31,502
All right, everyone, the
Major isn't a peep show.

573
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:33,135
Princess.

574
01:25:34,554 --> 01:25:38,006
Guess what your old dad's got
for you this time from the fair?

575
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,428
Guess.

576
01:25:39,518 --> 01:25:41,843
- I don't know, Father.
- Come and look.

577
01:25:48,527 --> 01:25:51,611
- Now, then.
- Father, you can't afford it.

578
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:52,859
Oh, it's nothing.

579
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:55,902
Just a little blood mare I
picked up at the fair, is all.

580
01:25:55,992 --> 01:25:58,946
- She's a Connemara.
- All right.

581
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:03,366
You look as if you'd be a judge, sir.
Maybe you'll favor us with your opinion.

582
01:26:05,919 --> 01:26:07,034
Now.

583
01:26:10,674 --> 01:26:12,797
It's a fine horse, Mr. Ryan.

584
01:26:13,218 --> 01:26:15,791
- Are you away, then?
- Yes.

585
01:26:16,888 --> 01:26:19,510
Good day, Mr. Ryan, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

586
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:31,230
Snob!

587
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,771
Of course he's a snob. Isn't that
what the English is famous for?

588
01:26:34,865 --> 01:26:36,193
Aye.

589
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:39,994
On the house.

590
01:26:52,257 --> 01:26:53,420
Hello.

591
01:26:59,556 --> 01:27:01,963
Did you see our lord and master, then?

592
01:27:02,058 --> 01:27:06,222
- I did. Fine looking young man.
- Blather.

593
01:30:37,816 --> 01:30:40,651
- Will you meet me tomorrow?
- How?

594
01:30:45,782 --> 01:30:46,945
Where?

595
01:30:47,492 --> 01:30:49,983
- The tower.
- What tower?

596
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:51,491
Ask.

597
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:53,445
When?

598
01:30:53,832 --> 01:30:56,501
- 3:00?
- Yes.

599
01:31:51,097 --> 01:31:52,889
Whatever is this, darling?

600
01:31:53,391 --> 01:31:55,514
It must be the lilies.

601
01:32:07,072 --> 01:32:08,696
You're restless, Rosy.

602
01:32:09,241 --> 01:32:10,616
Yes, I am a bit.

603
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:22,082
I think maybe I'll take
Princess out tomorrow.

604
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:24,079
Aye, yes, do that.

605
01:32:24,673 --> 01:32:26,712
It'll please your father.

606
01:40:37,123 --> 01:40:38,997
How long will you be here?

607
01:40:41,586 --> 01:40:43,413
Till I ask to be sent back.

608
01:40:44,923 --> 01:40:46,382
To the front?

609
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:49,718
To my unit.

610
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:52,048
They're at the front.

611
01:40:55,016 --> 01:40:56,511
You'll not do that?

612
01:40:57,686 --> 01:40:59,559
No. Not now.

613
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:02,731
Not now.

614
01:41:05,652 --> 01:41:07,443
Oh, darling.

615
01:41:08,113 --> 01:41:09,227
Darling.

616
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:22,372
- Tomorrow?
- If I can.

617
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:25,163
Good night, darling.

618
01:41:27,257 --> 01:41:28,585
Good night.

619
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:10,858
Rosy.

620
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,108
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Rose.

621
01:42:17,078 --> 01:42:19,070
Where've you been, Rose?

622
01:42:19,163 --> 01:42:21,571
What's happened, Rosy?

623
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:25,414
- Princess took a fall.
- Rose, no.

624
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,126
I'm fine. I'll just change.

625
01:42:33,094 --> 01:42:35,003
It was my own fault, really.

626
01:42:36,555 --> 01:42:39,260
I put her at a ditch
she wasn't up to, and...

627
01:42:39,392 --> 01:42:42,309
she lay on my leg and wouldn't get up.

628
01:42:42,395 --> 01:42:46,606
- Your leg, darling? Let me have a look.
- It's nothing at all.

629
01:42:47,942 --> 01:42:50,978
- If you're sure.
- I'm certain sure. It's nothing.

630
01:42:50,979 --> 01:42:54,185
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org.

631
01:43:05,418 --> 01:43:07,743
But she wouldn't get up for anything.

632
01:43:10,798 --> 01:43:13,585
Do you know who came
to get me out of it?

633
01:43:14,969 --> 01:43:17,045
That new English officer.

634
01:43:19,306 --> 01:43:22,224
- Major Doryan?
- Aye, him.

635
01:43:24,603 --> 01:43:26,561
He came and got her up.

636
01:43:26,856 --> 01:43:29,263
Well, that was lucky.

637
01:43:42,455 --> 01:43:45,159
- What have you been doing?
- Waiting for you.

638
01:43:46,417 --> 01:43:49,038
You mustn't worry about
me, darling. I can ride.

639
01:43:49,128 --> 01:43:53,173
You can ride Champion, surely. But
the mare's not properly broke, Rose.

640
01:44:00,264 --> 01:44:03,514
Rose, she's not properly broke.

641
01:44:07,313 --> 01:44:11,311
Well, Major what's-his-name
did say he'd help me.

642
01:44:17,531 --> 01:44:19,773
- With the horse?
- Aye.

643
01:44:22,828 --> 01:44:25,236
But, I don't suppose he meant it.

644
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:31,920
- He looks a man of his word to me.
- Does he, Charles?

645
01:44:33,339 --> 01:44:35,912
Seems like a fine
young fellow all around.

646
01:44:37,343 --> 01:44:40,427
You always think the
best of people, don't you?

647
01:44:40,846 --> 01:44:42,044
Why not?

648
01:44:46,769 --> 01:44:48,512
Well, we'll see.

649
01:44:48,604 --> 01:44:51,938
- Could you eat some supper?
- I could have a go at it, yes.

650
01:45:01,617 --> 01:45:02,862
Rose?

651
01:45:04,787 --> 01:45:05,866
Yes?

652
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:21,511
You'd never be unfaithful
to me, would you?

653
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:26,550
Charles.

654
01:45:29,562 --> 01:45:31,471
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have asked that.

655
01:45:31,564 --> 01:45:34,730
No, that's a rotten question
for a man to ask his wife.

656
01:50:55,484 --> 01:50:58,936
Sir, what's that there?

657
01:50:59,113 --> 01:51:01,022
What's that?

658
01:51:01,115 --> 01:51:03,688
Well, that's not the cuttlefish
that I told you to look for.

659
01:51:03,784 --> 01:51:06,820
That's for a start.
That is an insulator.

660
01:51:07,079 --> 01:51:09,202
Aye, an insulator, that is.

661
01:51:09,748 --> 01:51:11,824
Probably off a German battleship.

662
01:51:11,917 --> 01:51:15,167
I'm sure there's no German
battleships coming here, sir.

663
01:51:15,254 --> 01:51:18,623
- You don't know, there might be.
- No, Timmy's right.

664
01:51:18,716 --> 01:51:20,293
Now, tell me this.

665
01:51:20,384 --> 01:51:22,709
Why is there so much
stuff around Killins Bay?

666
01:51:22,803 --> 01:51:26,635
It's a tide... Tidal
eddy around the head.

667
01:51:26,724 --> 01:51:29,511
Tidal eddy. Very good, Tim. Good.

668
01:51:30,519 --> 01:51:32,891
All right, come on,
now. Go on looking.

669
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:35,981
The tide's going
down. Go on, hurry up.

670
01:51:47,411 --> 01:51:49,736
Go on, Kathleen. Off with the others.

671
01:51:52,416 --> 01:51:55,168
You never know, you might
find a diamond tiara.

672
01:52:29,203 --> 01:52:31,077
Sir, sir.

673
01:52:31,997 --> 01:52:33,741
Aye, that's a cuttlefish.

674
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:36,491
- Good lad.
- I'll try and find a bigger one.

675
01:52:36,585 --> 01:52:37,996
You do that, Tim.

676
01:55:43,939 --> 01:55:45,102
Come on.

677
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:16,630
What is it, sir?

678
01:56:21,101 --> 01:56:23,972
No, it's nothing. Nothing.
'Tis all right, Kathy.

679
01:56:24,813 --> 01:56:26,012
Come on.

680
01:56:27,483 --> 01:56:29,725
Time we had lunch.
We're eating at Barrow.

681
01:56:29,818 --> 01:56:31,478
It's a long way to Barrow, sir.

682
01:56:31,570 --> 01:56:34,275
Step off, then. That's
where we're eating.

683
01:57:01,475 --> 01:57:03,349
Tide's coming in, sir.

684
01:57:07,356 --> 01:57:08,601
So it is.

685
01:59:36,213 --> 01:59:39,048
Hey, would you look at Michael?

686
01:59:41,719 --> 01:59:42,798
Michael.

687
01:59:47,516 --> 01:59:49,723
It's the Major.

688
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:02,189
Hey, Tom, will you
have a look at this?

689
02:00:07,912 --> 02:00:09,951
He's getting worse, you know.

690
02:00:10,039 --> 02:00:14,582
Michael, let's have
a look at your V.C.

691
02:00:17,129 --> 02:00:19,418
- How many Germans did you kill, Michael?
- All right.

692
02:00:19,507 --> 02:00:22,757
All right, very entertaining.

693
02:00:25,888 --> 02:00:28,094
Michael, you're a perfect fool.

694
02:00:28,182 --> 02:00:32,014
You ask for trouble. Come on,
now, take the foolish things off.

695
02:00:34,188 --> 02:00:38,186
Michael, take them off, now. Come on.

696
02:00:42,446 --> 02:00:43,691
Michael!

697
02:00:55,167 --> 02:00:57,124
What's eating him?

698
02:00:57,211 --> 02:01:00,295
- What've you been doing?
- Don't know, Father.

699
02:01:00,756 --> 02:01:02,749
We've not done anything.

700
02:01:03,926 --> 02:01:06,678
Come on now, Michael.
What're you up to?

701
02:01:47,219 --> 02:01:48,417
Let go!

702
02:01:49,471 --> 02:01:52,009
Michael, let go, or I'll hit you.

703
02:01:56,145 --> 02:01:58,434
Michael, darling, let go.

704
02:02:28,093 --> 02:02:31,379
Major, darling, let me touch your V.C.

705
02:02:31,472 --> 02:02:35,470
You see, my husband hasn't got one.

706
02:03:19,937 --> 02:03:20,968
Well?

707
02:03:21,564 --> 02:03:22,643
Well.

708
02:03:22,773 --> 02:03:25,145
What was the meaning
of that pantomime?

709
02:03:26,068 --> 02:03:27,527
I don't know.

710
02:03:27,736 --> 02:03:30,654
- Where have you been?
- Riding...

711
02:03:31,532 --> 02:03:34,901
- with Major Doryan.
- You're bold as brass.

712
02:03:35,452 --> 02:03:39,284
You think that's a suitable
connection for a decent Irish wife?

713
02:03:39,373 --> 02:03:42,457
I think that is for my
husband to say, Father Hugh.

714
02:03:42,543 --> 02:03:44,417
- You've told him, have you?
- Yes.

715
02:03:44,503 --> 02:03:45,962
Yes, you would.

716
02:03:46,046 --> 02:03:48,419
Your husband would say anything
you wanted, pretty well...

717
02:03:48,507 --> 02:03:51,259
because he loves you
sorely, doesn't he?

718
02:03:54,763 --> 02:03:58,132
- Yes, he does.
- Have you nothing to say to me?

719
02:03:59,143 --> 02:04:01,812
- What should I have to say to you?
- You could say:

720
02:04:01,896 --> 02:04:04,256
"Father Hugh, there's nothing
between me and Major Doryan."

721
02:04:04,315 --> 02:04:06,806
- There isn't.
- Say it, then.

722
02:04:09,195 --> 02:04:12,564
There is nothing between
me and Major Doryan.

723
02:04:12,656 --> 02:04:14,281
Look at me, Rosy.

724
02:04:16,994 --> 02:04:19,200
Oh, child, what a face.

725
02:04:23,167 --> 02:04:25,705
- Rose, tell me now.
- What?

726
02:04:25,794 --> 02:04:28,167
You'll have to tell it in
confessional, you little fool.

727
02:04:28,255 --> 02:04:29,999
I don't have to come...

728
02:04:30,090 --> 02:04:32,546
- to the confessional.
- Child!

729
02:04:33,969 --> 02:04:35,345
Child?

730
02:04:41,268 --> 02:04:44,055
- Father.
- Hello, then.

731
02:04:44,146 --> 02:04:45,177
Rosy...

732
02:04:47,733 --> 02:04:49,690
was there something?

733
02:04:50,778 --> 02:04:53,067
No, I just...

734
02:04:53,155 --> 02:04:55,527
- Will you take the prayers, then?
- Aye.

735
02:05:04,625 --> 02:05:05,704
"Our Father..."

736
02:05:05,793 --> 02:05:08,663
"who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name."

737
02:05:08,754 --> 02:05:10,913
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done..."

738
02:05:11,006 --> 02:05:13,046
"on Earth as it is in heaven."

739
02:05:13,133 --> 02:05:17,380
"Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses..."

740
02:05:17,471 --> 02:05:20,721
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us."

741
02:05:20,808 --> 02:05:24,675
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."

742
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:28,305
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

743
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:30,557
All right, children, off with you.

744
02:05:35,906 --> 02:05:38,278
Thank you, Father. Good day.

745
02:05:38,576 --> 02:05:40,449
Glad to help, Charles.

746
02:05:40,828 --> 02:05:43,615
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

747
02:05:43,706 --> 02:05:45,497
No, I don't think so.

748
02:05:45,875 --> 02:05:48,200
Well, I'll be off home, too, then.

749
02:06:05,895 --> 02:06:09,145
- You're late.
- I took them for a nature walk.

750
02:06:09,607 --> 02:06:11,350
Up Brandon?

751
02:06:11,442 --> 02:06:13,102
Along the shore.

752
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:17,272
- For cuttlefish?
- Aye.

753
02:06:17,781 --> 02:06:19,276
For cuttlefish.

754
02:06:26,165 --> 02:06:29,368
If you'd come up Brandon,
we might have seen you.

755
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:30,788
Why?

756
02:06:30,878 --> 02:06:33,451
- Did you go to Brandon?
- Aye.

757
02:06:33,797 --> 02:06:35,589
I got some heather.

758
02:06:36,175 --> 02:06:37,634
So you did.

759
02:06:40,804 --> 02:06:43,046
You haven't been to the beach, then?

760
02:06:43,933 --> 02:06:44,964
No.

761
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,352
Oh, well.

762
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:53,180
- It's nice up Brandon.
- Aye, it's grand.

763
02:09:10,788 --> 02:09:12,531
Is something the matter?

764
02:09:12,623 --> 02:09:14,580
I don't know, Rose. Is there?

765
02:09:16,168 --> 02:09:18,790
There's nothing the matter with me.

766
02:09:19,547 --> 02:09:21,670
Nothing's the matter, then.

767
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:38,270
And the jam, and the...

768
02:09:41,151 --> 02:09:42,895
The jam...

769
02:09:43,529 --> 02:09:45,438
and the soap.

770
02:09:45,531 --> 02:09:46,729
Maggie.

771
02:09:49,785 --> 02:09:51,577
That'll be 18 pence.

772
02:09:52,997 --> 02:09:55,535
Could it wait to the
end of the week, missus?

773
02:09:55,624 --> 02:09:58,246
Aye, to the end of the week.
Not to the crack of doom.

774
02:09:58,335 --> 02:09:59,913
Thank you.

775
02:10:04,216 --> 02:10:07,799
- What was it, then?
- I want a dishcloth, please.

776
02:10:08,137 --> 02:10:10,379
- I've none.
- Oh.

777
02:10:10,472 --> 02:10:13,473
Then I'll just take some
potatoes. Five pound.

778
02:10:13,893 --> 02:10:15,636
I've no potatoes, either.

779
02:10:18,647 --> 02:10:20,687
What's them, then?

780
02:10:20,774 --> 02:10:22,814
Aye, them.

781
02:10:22,902 --> 02:10:26,520
They're gone. I've no potatoes.

782
02:10:30,242 --> 02:10:31,653
Oh, I... I see.

783
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:42,580
The way I see it, Mrs. Kenyon, there's
loose women and there's whores...

784
02:10:42,671 --> 02:10:46,123
and then there's
British soldiers' whores.

785
02:11:35,558 --> 02:11:38,808
- Coming up fast, Father.
- Aye.

786
02:11:38,894 --> 02:11:41,136
Will you look at those things?

787
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:53,443
You'd think they was
announcing the coming of Christ.

788
02:12:07,381 --> 02:12:10,002
- Off you go!
- Right.

789
02:12:12,219 --> 02:12:14,212
Put her down!

790
02:12:15,264 --> 02:12:17,221
Slowly does it.

791
02:12:54,929 --> 02:12:58,380
All right, now! That's it. Come
on, Joe, there's a good lad.

792
02:12:59,767 --> 02:13:01,261
Come on, it's late.

793
02:13:02,186 --> 02:13:04,593
All right. Come on, Sean.

794
02:13:05,606 --> 02:13:08,097
Come on, Tom. You've
got to go to sleep.

795
02:13:09,777 --> 02:13:11,437
Go on. Good night!

796
02:13:35,427 --> 02:13:36,838
Hello, Tom.

797
02:13:38,347 --> 02:13:42,641
- You? What are you doing here?
- Come on, now, Tom.

798
02:13:43,269 --> 02:13:47,053
Phoenix Park, 1913.

799
02:13:51,777 --> 02:13:53,152
Tim O'Leary.

800
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:58,282
Come on.

801
02:14:01,745 --> 02:14:03,323
Right, lads.

802
02:14:03,414 --> 02:14:06,083
Now, what do you usually
do at this time, Tom?

803
02:14:06,167 --> 02:14:07,625
- I go to bed.
- Right.

804
02:14:07,710 --> 02:14:09,453
This is Bernard. Go on up, lads.

805
02:14:09,545 --> 02:14:11,253
- Paddy.
- Paddy.

806
02:14:11,338 --> 02:14:12,453
Sean.

807
02:14:12,923 --> 02:14:15,414
Joseph, Peter...

808
02:14:16,510 --> 02:14:17,839
Mr. O'Keefe.

809
02:14:18,512 --> 02:14:20,968
- And you know Pat.
- Which room?

810
02:14:21,056 --> 02:14:22,467
At the back.

811
02:14:23,309 --> 02:14:26,144
But, Commandant,
sir, what's happening?

812
02:14:39,992 --> 02:14:41,486
Guns, is it?

813
02:14:41,577 --> 02:14:45,657
- That's right, Tom. German guns.
- German?

814
02:14:45,748 --> 02:14:49,164
Dynamite, grenades. All the
stuff the movement needs.

815
02:14:49,627 --> 02:14:52,331
We tried to launch the boat...

816
02:14:55,674 --> 02:14:58,878
- You must get to them somehow, then.
- We can't.

817
02:14:58,969 --> 02:15:03,678
But Sean here says there's a good chance
some of it will break away and come to us.

818
02:15:03,766 --> 02:15:05,509
- Float in?
- You're on to it.

819
02:15:05,601 --> 02:15:07,475
But, if it does, we won't know where.

820
02:15:07,561 --> 02:15:10,479
You can't see the nose on
your face out there now.

821
02:15:10,564 --> 02:15:12,356
So we'll wait till daylight.

822
02:15:12,441 --> 02:15:15,193
- Absolute madness.
- Will you shut up?

823
02:15:15,277 --> 02:15:16,440
Tom...

824
02:15:17,404 --> 02:15:20,192
if it's to be done in
daylight, it's to be done quick.

825
02:15:20,282 --> 02:15:22,571
So we must have some
fellows, say a dozen...

826
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:26,527
good, strong fellows, and
that's where you come in.

827
02:15:30,042 --> 02:15:32,877
- What if it don't break away?
- Exactly.

828
02:15:33,045 --> 02:15:35,714
Then we'll wait one
hour and go without it.

829
02:15:35,798 --> 02:15:37,209
One hour, Tom...

830
02:15:37,299 --> 02:15:40,217
and 12 strong men.
That's all I'm asking.

831
02:15:40,511 --> 02:15:42,005
Can you do it?

832
02:15:42,596 --> 02:15:44,838
I could rout out a dozen, yes.

833
02:15:45,641 --> 02:15:47,883
- Do you want them now?
- Not at all.

834
02:15:48,727 --> 02:15:51,265
The later they know
we're here, the better.

835
02:15:51,355 --> 02:15:53,727
You let them lie till nearer morning.

836
02:15:53,816 --> 02:15:57,351
Can you find us something to
eat? It's gonna be a long night.

837
02:16:30,936 --> 02:16:33,427
Paddy, Tom.

838
02:16:34,565 --> 02:16:36,723
Take the Constable his breakfast.

839
02:16:47,786 --> 02:16:49,909
Jesus and Mary, what a night.

840
02:16:57,630 --> 02:17:01,129
Now, do not make one sound, Constable.

841
02:17:07,389 --> 02:17:09,429
Right. You.

842
02:17:09,517 --> 02:17:11,639
Fat guts, get the handcuffs.

843
02:17:12,686 --> 02:17:14,893
- Where are they?
- In the cupboard.

844
02:17:15,856 --> 02:17:17,054
Turn around.

845
02:17:28,327 --> 02:17:30,783
- I'm acting under duress.
- Shut up.

846
02:17:31,330 --> 02:17:32,908
Put them on him.

847
02:17:42,049 --> 02:17:43,876
Open your mouth, Constable.

848
02:17:59,275 --> 02:18:01,314
Is that a telephone line?

849
02:18:04,613 --> 02:18:05,858
Cut it.

850
02:18:33,225 --> 02:18:34,601
Oh, God.

851
02:18:35,311 --> 02:18:37,552
Why have you done this to me?

852
02:18:45,905 --> 02:18:47,731
Hello?

853
02:18:48,365 --> 02:18:49,776
This is Ryan.

854
02:18:51,076 --> 02:18:53,199
- Did you cut the wire?
- I did.

855
02:18:53,287 --> 02:18:55,161
You're doing well, Tom.

856
02:18:58,334 --> 02:19:00,825
- Where's the Constable?
- In the cellar.

857
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:02,996
We can put a bullet
in him if you like.

858
02:19:03,088 --> 02:19:05,247
Constable... No!

859
02:19:05,341 --> 02:19:08,128
- Then get your men.
- Aye, Commandant.

860
02:19:09,261 --> 02:19:10,424
Right.

861
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:57,559
They've gone!

862
02:19:59,645 --> 02:20:01,020
Busted loose!

863
02:21:17,848 --> 02:21:20,090
It's no good, Commandant!

864
02:21:20,184 --> 02:21:23,635
Why don't you get up
out of it while you can?

865
02:21:25,231 --> 02:21:26,310
Tim!

866
02:21:55,261 --> 02:21:59,128
- Hey, are you Tim O'Leary?
- Yes, son, yes.

867
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:12,187
Father, what the hell
have you done this for?

868
02:22:12,278 --> 02:22:14,436
I didn't, they did!

869
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:16,321
Well, do you know what you're doing?

870
02:22:16,407 --> 02:22:18,280
- Do you know what we've come for?
- Aye.

871
02:22:18,367 --> 02:22:20,692
- Have you got it?
- Well, look.

872
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:26,617
- T'will be on the slabs.
- Where?

873
02:22:26,709 --> 02:22:28,084
The slabs!

874
02:23:49,625 --> 02:23:50,905
Tim!

875
02:25:02,156 --> 02:25:03,615
Come on.

876
02:25:12,708 --> 02:25:13,787
Yes, Kathy?

877
02:25:13,876 --> 02:25:16,367
- Aren't you coming to the beach, sir?
- The beach?

878
02:25:16,462 --> 02:25:18,170
Everyone's at the beach.

879
02:25:18,506 --> 02:25:22,290
- And why is everyone at the beach?
- I don't know, sir. I think it's a wreck.

880
02:25:22,384 --> 02:25:23,629
A wreck?

881
02:25:39,985 --> 02:25:43,354
Now, that's enough, Tom. You're
not as young as you used to be.

882
02:25:43,447 --> 02:25:44,692
Aye, come on!

883
02:26:00,130 --> 02:26:02,704
Oh, God.

884
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:14,473
Pull!

885
02:26:52,016 --> 02:26:56,594
Right, up you get. You, too,
Father. Up. Keep it going.

886
02:26:58,147 --> 02:26:59,855
That's right, darling.

887
02:27:02,818 --> 02:27:04,147
That's right.

888
02:27:19,835 --> 02:27:21,495
Hey!

889
02:27:24,089 --> 02:27:25,370
Dynamite.

890
02:28:25,985 --> 02:28:28,191
What are you doing here?

891
02:28:28,904 --> 02:28:31,312
- Why shouldn't I be?
- Why?

892
02:28:35,786 --> 02:28:37,411
Thank you, ma'am.

893
02:28:39,039 --> 02:28:41,744
You know, we made speeches
about these people...

894
02:28:41,834 --> 02:28:43,328
but, by God...

895
02:28:59,351 --> 02:29:02,518
Thanks. You're a man!

896
02:29:20,915 --> 02:29:23,121
Come on, then!

897
02:29:25,753 --> 02:29:27,212
One!

898
02:29:27,296 --> 02:29:28,541
Two!

899
02:29:28,631 --> 02:29:30,339
Three!

900
02:31:05,519 --> 02:31:06,682
Sean?

901
02:31:07,813 --> 02:31:10,055
- I must take a chance.
- Aye.

902
02:31:10,149 --> 02:31:11,263
Good luck.

903
02:31:32,379 --> 02:31:34,538
Thank you. Get down, please.

904
02:31:34,632 --> 02:31:36,174
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

905
02:31:36,717 --> 02:31:38,377
You, here. You.

906
02:31:44,892 --> 02:31:48,343
No. No trouble now,
for your own sakes.

907
02:31:48,437 --> 02:31:49,552
O'Leary.

908
02:31:51,649 --> 02:31:53,937
That thing could kill
a lot of people, Major.

909
02:31:54,026 --> 02:31:55,105
Sir?

910
02:31:55,402 --> 02:31:56,434
No.

911
02:32:05,788 --> 02:32:07,412
Go on. Run, Tim!

912
02:32:08,916 --> 02:32:10,031
Run, Tim.

913
02:32:10,125 --> 02:32:11,750
Make it, Tim. Come on!

914
02:32:12,878 --> 02:32:14,254
- Run.
- O'Leary!

915
02:32:16,298 --> 02:32:17,378
Sir.

916
02:32:20,135 --> 02:32:22,258
- No!
- No!

917
02:32:24,515 --> 02:32:26,223
- Murderer!
- Don't shoot.

918
02:33:11,145 --> 02:33:13,137
What's wrong with the bastard?

919
02:33:30,664 --> 02:33:32,491
Boo!

920
02:33:35,669 --> 02:33:37,627
Shoot that slut, Shaughnessy.

921
02:33:38,923 --> 02:33:40,168
Careful, man.

922
02:33:42,384 --> 02:33:44,626
My God, they're a well-matched pair.

923
02:33:47,014 --> 02:33:48,556
All right, sir?

924
02:33:49,850 --> 02:33:51,843
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, sir.

925
02:34:24,426 --> 02:34:26,549
Is there anything you want?

926
02:34:26,762 --> 02:34:28,091
Cigarette.

927
02:34:37,147 --> 02:34:40,065
- Anything else?
- Yes.

928
02:34:41,777 --> 02:34:44,398
Get out of my country.

929
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:49,157
God bless you, Tim O'Leary!

930
02:35:06,427 --> 02:35:09,593
What are they going to
do with them boys, Father?

931
02:35:09,930 --> 02:35:11,638
They'll hang them, dear.

932
02:35:12,266 --> 02:35:13,760
They'll hang them.

933
02:35:24,778 --> 02:35:26,154
Bastard!

934
02:35:37,958 --> 02:35:39,038
Bastard!

935
02:36:01,857 --> 02:36:03,316
Get out!

936
02:36:19,291 --> 02:36:21,782
You're very kind to me today.

937
02:36:21,877 --> 02:36:23,040
Am I?

938
02:36:24,171 --> 02:36:26,330
Yes. Why?

939
02:36:27,883 --> 02:36:30,090
Am I not usually kind to you?

940
02:36:30,970 --> 02:36:33,840
Yes, you are. Always.

941
02:36:39,687 --> 02:36:42,890
Charles, do you know or not?

942
02:36:45,025 --> 02:36:46,270
I know.

943
02:36:51,031 --> 02:36:53,701
- Since when?
- The beginning.

944
02:36:57,037 --> 02:36:59,160
Don't lower your head, Rose.

945
02:37:06,797 --> 02:37:08,589
Why didn't you speak?

946
02:37:10,426 --> 02:37:11,885
I should have, shouldn't I?

947
02:37:14,638 --> 02:37:16,097
I don't know.

948
02:37:18,309 --> 02:37:22,258
It was easier not to, I suppose.
I didn't want to know, you know.

949
02:37:23,314 --> 02:37:27,525
And then I thought, if I let you
burn it out, the pair of you...

950
02:37:27,610 --> 02:37:29,851
you'd perhaps come back to me.

951
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:16,165
Charles?

952
02:41:16,839 --> 02:41:17,870
Charles?

953
02:42:16,982 --> 02:42:20,980
Mr. Shaughnessy has been called
away, so I'm taking class.

954
02:42:27,159 --> 02:42:30,030
What's the first lesson today, Danny?

955
02:42:32,122 --> 02:42:35,408
- Danny?
- My father says not to speak to you, miss.

956
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:19,751
- It's right then, he's not here?
- No.

957
02:43:20,379 --> 02:43:22,253
I don't know where he is.

958
02:43:22,339 --> 02:43:24,747
- You mean he's gone off?
- Yes.

959
02:43:24,842 --> 02:43:25,957
When?

960
02:43:26,886 --> 02:43:28,261
Last night.

961
02:43:30,347 --> 02:43:32,139
You had a row?

962
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:33,849
I wasn't here.

963
02:43:33,934 --> 02:43:35,428
Where were you?

964
02:43:36,812 --> 02:43:38,769
Oh, I see.

965
02:43:40,107 --> 02:43:43,143
There's nothing I can do tonight,
I'll find him in the morning.

966
02:43:43,235 --> 02:43:46,355
- If he turns up, you'll tell me.
- Father?

967
02:43:48,115 --> 02:43:50,404
You'd better take his clothes.

968
02:43:52,286 --> 02:43:54,279
His clothes?

969
02:44:03,172 --> 02:44:05,414
He was in bed?

970
02:44:05,591 --> 02:44:07,465
Yes.

971
02:44:07,551 --> 02:44:10,671
You left his bed and went to...

972
02:44:16,477 --> 02:44:18,185
Rose.

973
02:44:21,106 --> 02:44:23,265
Oh, Rose.

974
02:44:59,144 --> 02:45:01,054
Come on, this isn't a picnic.

975
02:45:01,146 --> 02:45:03,720
All right, Corp, but
there's nothing here.

976
02:45:31,177 --> 02:45:33,003
He's got something there, sir.

977
02:45:33,095 --> 02:45:34,293
Padre.

978
02:45:44,565 --> 02:45:46,474
Good morning, padre.

979
02:45:46,567 --> 02:45:49,437
I'm sorry, but what is
it you have there, please?

980
02:45:53,490 --> 02:45:55,234
A man's clothes.

981
02:45:56,660 --> 02:45:57,905
I see.

982
02:45:58,204 --> 02:46:00,991
- And where are you taking them, Father?
- To the man.

983
02:46:01,081 --> 02:46:03,121
Come on, padre. I don't
suppose you mean any harm...

984
02:46:03,209 --> 02:46:06,328
but after the other day, we've
got to be careful. What man?

985
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:10,632
A man whose wife went off two
nights back with her fancy fellow.

986
02:46:11,467 --> 02:46:14,088
And a man I've been looking
for since dawn today.

987
02:46:14,178 --> 02:46:16,550
- A man...
Excuse me, sir.

988
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:21,217
A man who must be half out of his mind
to have gone off as he did, barefoot.

989
02:46:22,770 --> 02:46:26,103
That's right. Charles Shaughnessy.

990
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:42,956
I think we're finished here, sir.

991
02:46:44,291 --> 02:46:45,951
Very well.

992
02:47:40,222 --> 02:47:43,009
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Father.

993
02:47:46,187 --> 02:47:48,475
I've brought your clothes.

994
02:47:48,564 --> 02:47:52,015
Thanks, Father. I was
wondering how I should get home.

995
02:47:52,610 --> 02:47:55,397
- And something to drink.
- Thanks.

996
02:48:01,577 --> 02:48:04,246
- Yourself?
- Aye, I will.

997
02:48:09,585 --> 02:48:12,669
- You seem all right, man.
- Aye, more or less.

998
02:48:12,755 --> 02:48:14,747
Well, I'll get dressed now.

999
02:48:48,916 --> 02:48:50,790
Michael.

1000
02:48:52,586 --> 02:48:55,872
He'll be after catching
a few flounders.

1001
02:48:58,676 --> 02:49:01,427
So, what have you been
doing down here, Charles?

1002
02:49:01,512 --> 02:49:04,085
Oh, thinking.

1003
02:49:04,557 --> 02:49:06,882
About Rosy?

1004
02:49:07,184 --> 02:49:09,426
About myself, mostly.

1005
02:49:10,187 --> 02:49:14,102
Thanks for the clothes. You're
a man in a million, Father Hugh.

1006
02:50:00,029 --> 02:50:02,187
The children haven't come today, then?

1007
02:50:02,281 --> 02:50:03,396
No.

1008
02:50:05,159 --> 02:50:08,658
Rose, I have something
to say to you. Come in.

1009
02:50:17,296 --> 02:50:19,123
Sit down, will you?

1010
02:50:23,469 --> 02:50:27,882
Rose, I thought I could stand by and
let you two burn it out, like I said.

1011
02:50:27,973 --> 02:50:30,215
But I find I can't.

1012
02:50:31,644 --> 02:50:36,140
I'm not sure I ought to have
tried, but anyway, I can't.

1013
02:50:37,733 --> 02:50:40,058
So I'm going to leave you.

1014
02:50:44,573 --> 02:50:47,029
- Very well.
- Sit still a minute, Rose.

1015
02:50:48,244 --> 02:50:50,402
What about you? You and him?

1016
02:50:52,915 --> 02:50:56,118
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

1017
02:50:57,294 --> 02:50:58,670
It's over.

1018
02:51:00,548 --> 02:51:03,798
Was that because I
went and stayed away?

1019
02:51:03,884 --> 02:51:04,915
No.

1020
02:51:06,679 --> 02:51:08,054
It's over.

1021
02:51:09,807 --> 02:51:12,642
- Have you told him?
- No.

1022
02:51:12,726 --> 02:51:15,348
He doesn't know, then?

1023
02:51:15,437 --> 02:51:17,430
Yes, he knows.

1024
02:51:17,523 --> 02:51:18,982
How?

1025
02:51:19,775 --> 02:51:21,056
He must.

1026
02:51:23,571 --> 02:51:25,978
You're as close as that, are you?

1027
02:51:28,492 --> 02:51:30,449
We were, yes.

1028
02:51:51,974 --> 02:51:53,967
Rose, you must tell me the truth.

1029
02:51:54,059 --> 02:51:56,729
Do you think you're
ever gonna forget him?

1030
02:51:56,812 --> 02:51:59,220
Of course not.

1031
02:51:59,315 --> 02:52:01,640
He'd be like a ghost about the place.

1032
02:52:02,276 --> 02:52:04,399
Rose, am I right?

1033
02:52:06,488 --> 02:52:08,528
Yes, you're right.

1034
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:11,574
It's busted, Charles.

1035
02:52:12,786 --> 02:52:14,197
I busted it.

1036
02:52:17,666 --> 02:52:20,916
Now, have you thought what to do?

1037
02:52:21,003 --> 02:52:23,411
- No.
- Well, I have.

1038
02:52:24,465 --> 02:52:27,419
I don't think either of us can
stay in this village any longer.

1039
02:52:27,510 --> 02:52:28,541
No.

1040
02:52:28,636 --> 02:52:32,384
It's time I moved on anyway. And
you were never worse suited here.

1041
02:52:33,599 --> 02:52:37,050
I've reckoned up, I've
got about 200 pounds.

1042
02:52:38,938 --> 02:52:42,805
Take all this, without the
gramophone, fetch another 50.

1043
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:45,058
We'll split it down the middle.

1044
02:52:45,152 --> 02:52:46,860
I can't do it.

1045
02:52:49,198 --> 02:52:50,573
We're not enemies, Rose.

1046
02:52:51,867 --> 02:52:55,236
Stop that! There's to be none of that.

1047
02:53:06,882 --> 02:53:08,674
But why must it be Rosy?

1048
02:53:08,759 --> 02:53:11,546
Because she was
fornicating with the fellow.

1049
02:53:14,431 --> 02:53:16,720
So, you're back, are you?

1050
02:53:16,809 --> 02:53:18,848
What is this? What do you want?

1051
02:53:19,103 --> 02:53:21,594
- Not you.
- Well, then get out.

1052
02:53:22,648 --> 02:53:25,768
- Go on, get out.
- Shut up, Shaughnessy.

1053
02:53:28,946 --> 02:53:30,570
We're waiting for her.

1054
02:53:32,283 --> 02:53:33,611
You.

1055
02:53:33,868 --> 02:53:37,817
You've been tried and found
guilty. You're the informer.

1056
02:53:39,415 --> 02:53:42,998
- What?
- Busting at the seams with innocence.

1057
02:53:43,127 --> 02:53:46,044
Joe, for God's sake, don't
hurt her, Joe. Don't hurt her.

1058
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:49,795
If she was a man, Mr.
Ryan, she'd be shot.

1059
02:53:51,218 --> 02:53:54,718
- What is this?
- Listen, numbskull.

1060
02:53:55,139 --> 02:53:57,808
Someone that morning
went up to the camp...

1061
02:53:57,892 --> 02:53:59,931
and betrayed Tim O'Leary.

1062
02:54:00,394 --> 02:54:03,597
Now, who lives near
enough? Who had time enough?

1063
02:54:03,939 --> 02:54:06,430
Who would? Who did?

1064
02:54:07,067 --> 02:54:09,226
That bitch you call your wife.

1065
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:10,648
String her up!

1066
02:54:14,825 --> 02:54:17,945
But anyone could have, if anyone
did. The whole village was abroad.

1067
02:54:18,037 --> 02:54:20,195
No. The village was down on the beach.

1068
02:54:20,289 --> 02:54:21,867
- Except you.
- You came late.

1069
02:54:21,957 --> 02:54:25,457
- We came together. We spoke to no one.
- You'd say that, of course.

1070
02:54:25,544 --> 02:54:26,873
Young Kathy was with us.

1071
02:54:26,962 --> 02:54:29,667
Young Kathy would say black
was white if you told her.

1072
02:54:29,757 --> 02:54:32,508
Then anyone, anyone at all could've
gone into the police station...

1073
02:54:32,593 --> 02:54:35,510
- and used the telephone.
- That's where you're wrong.

1074
02:54:35,596 --> 02:54:38,550
They couldn't. Could they, Tom?

1075
02:54:38,641 --> 02:54:40,598
- No.
- Why not?

1076
02:54:40,684 --> 02:54:44,385
Because Tom went in there
himself and cut the wire.

1077
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:46,638
Didn't you, Tom?

1078
02:54:48,901 --> 02:54:51,855
Well, you went in there
yourself, didn't you?

1079
02:54:53,072 --> 02:54:56,441
- Yes.
- And you cut the wire, didn't you?

1080
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:02,455
Yes.

1081
02:55:11,006 --> 02:55:14,458
Well, what do you say now?

1082
02:55:16,428 --> 02:55:18,053
Nothing.

1083
02:55:18,264 --> 02:55:19,758
Take her out.

1084
02:55:20,140 --> 02:55:23,344
No, you're taking her nowhere.

1085
02:55:24,103 --> 02:55:25,977
Stop it!

1086
02:55:33,445 --> 02:55:35,105
- Informer.
- There she is!

1087
02:55:48,627 --> 02:55:49,956
Hold him.

1088
02:56:05,436 --> 02:56:07,060
Take him by the hands.

1089
02:56:18,741 --> 02:56:21,658
Quiet! Get back!

1090
02:56:23,412 --> 02:56:25,155
Get back!

1091
02:56:30,336 --> 02:56:31,534
Do it.

1092
02:57:16,298 --> 02:57:17,579
Princess...

1093
02:57:31,939 --> 02:57:33,219
What is it?

1094
02:57:45,202 --> 02:57:46,994
There she is.

1095
02:58:49,683 --> 02:58:53,218
Look here, Father Hugh, the
stripping of her was an accident.

1096
02:58:53,312 --> 02:58:54,510
Steady, Joe.

1097
02:58:54,605 --> 02:58:57,013
You're taking advantage
of your cloth, Father Hugh.

1098
02:58:57,107 --> 02:58:59,943
- That's what it's for.
- Come on, Joe.

1099
02:59:00,986 --> 02:59:03,738
It's not right. A
priest is only a man.

1100
03:00:00,546 --> 03:00:01,744
Go on.

1101
03:00:04,633 --> 03:00:06,626
Go on, Michael, get off.

1102
03:00:11,974 --> 03:00:13,801
Get off out of it!

1103
03:02:01,876 --> 03:02:03,074
Hello.

1104
03:02:36,911 --> 03:02:38,191
Keep it.

1105
03:03:31,006 --> 03:03:32,501
What?

1106
03:03:36,095 --> 03:03:38,004
They really thought...

1107
03:03:39,306 --> 03:03:43,304
I was the one who betrayed that man.

1108
03:03:43,936 --> 03:03:45,430
Rose...

1109
03:03:45,688 --> 03:03:49,222
I don't for one moment suppose
that anyone betrayed him.

1110
03:03:50,359 --> 03:03:52,850
Why should they? They just...

1111
03:03:52,945 --> 03:03:56,812
They just wanted it so, that's all.
And they wanted it to be you, too.

1112
03:03:56,907 --> 03:03:58,864
For other reasons.

1113
03:03:58,951 --> 03:04:02,035
Truth was told, they envy
you. They always have.

1114
03:04:02,913 --> 03:04:06,199
They've always had a rare,
old contempt for me, too.

1115
03:04:07,334 --> 03:04:10,538
I tell you, I'm not for letting any
of that lot know we've busted up.

1116
03:04:10,629 --> 03:04:13,714
We'll just keep up a front
until I'm well and out of it.

1117
03:04:15,259 --> 03:04:16,753
What?

1118
03:04:17,636 --> 03:04:19,676
I don't know.

1119
03:04:19,763 --> 03:04:21,922
It just seemed funny, that's all.

1120
03:07:10,392 --> 03:07:13,726
Michael, give that to me.

1121
03:07:19,360 --> 03:07:21,851
All right, keep it.

1122
03:07:24,281 --> 03:07:26,357
I thought we were friends.

1123
03:07:35,251 --> 03:07:38,121
That one, too. Give it to me.

1124
03:07:38,212 --> 03:07:40,964
No! Look.

1125
03:08:05,739 --> 03:08:08,990
For Christ's sake, man,
I'm not going to hurt you.

1126
03:10:05,901 --> 03:10:09,021
- It'll be the soldiers.
- Soldiers?

1127
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:10,655
Aye.

1128
03:10:10,739 --> 03:10:14,903
The beach was fairly littered with
stuff. They'll be destroying it.

1129
03:10:15,995 --> 03:10:17,240
Oh, yes.

1130
03:10:58,787 --> 03:11:00,614
Come on, lads, pick them up.

1131
03:11:00,706 --> 03:11:03,707
What about my blisters, Corporal?

1132
03:11:03,792 --> 03:11:06,996
- Well, they're not mourning long.
- No.

1133
03:11:08,839 --> 03:11:11,793
Does she think he killed
himself deliberate?

1134
03:11:11,884 --> 03:11:13,164
She says...

1135
03:11:15,012 --> 03:11:17,764
I think he was a man who
suffered, Father Hugh.

1136
03:11:19,141 --> 03:11:21,715
You love her sorely,
don't you, Charles?

1137
03:11:21,810 --> 03:11:22,890
Yes.

1138
03:11:29,109 --> 03:11:31,861
- Ready, then?
- Yes.

1139
03:11:41,163 --> 03:11:44,828
It's not all your doing, Rosy.
I should not have married you.

1140
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:46,080
No.

1141
03:11:48,254 --> 03:11:50,460
You can tell Father Hugh that
we're parting if you like.

1142
03:11:50,548 --> 03:11:51,627
No.

1143
03:12:22,663 --> 03:12:24,620
- Rosy.
- Father.

1144
03:12:25,791 --> 03:12:28,709
It'll be a fair day for
the journey, yet, I think.

1145
03:12:29,086 --> 03:12:31,292
I hope so, yes.

1146
03:12:34,091 --> 03:12:36,416
Well, now, how shall we manage?

1147
03:12:36,677 --> 03:12:37,840
Margaret.

1148
03:12:37,928 --> 03:12:40,217
Come here, Margaret. Come here.

1149
03:13:09,001 --> 03:13:11,041
Kathy, come in.

1150
03:13:18,219 --> 03:13:21,670
Kathy, will I take the belt to you?

1151
03:13:51,210 --> 03:13:53,037
Take my arm.

1152
03:14:15,651 --> 03:14:17,442
A rousing sendoff.

1153
03:14:18,195 --> 03:14:20,686
We'll be out of it in five minutes.

1154
03:14:41,468 --> 03:14:42,548
Dad.

1155
03:14:53,939 --> 03:14:56,181
Goodbye, Dad.

1156
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:58,811
Bye, princess.

1157
03:15:03,532 --> 03:15:05,655
I'm all right.

1158
03:15:06,535 --> 03:15:09,738
- Are you, darling?
- Aye.

1159
03:15:09,997 --> 03:15:13,864
I'm looking forward
to Dublin and that.

1160
03:15:14,668 --> 03:15:16,578
Really.

1161
03:15:16,670 --> 03:15:19,244
That's your mother speaking.

1162
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:22,839
- Do you remember your mother, Rose?
- A bit.

1163
03:15:24,678 --> 03:15:26,885
Do you, like...

1164
03:15:26,972 --> 03:15:29,724
- remember the rows?
- Aye.

1165
03:15:29,808 --> 03:15:33,343
- I never raised a fist to her, Rose.
- I know that, Dad.

1166
03:15:35,523 --> 03:15:38,559
You wouldn't hurt a fly
if you could help it.

1167
03:15:45,491 --> 03:15:48,527
- I'll write to you.
- And I'll write to you.

1168
03:15:49,370 --> 03:15:52,240
- Well, maybe.
- No. I swear to God, Rose.

1169
03:15:52,331 --> 03:15:55,782
- I will write every...
Every... All right, Dad.

1170
03:15:56,961 --> 03:15:58,953
We'll both write regular.

1171
03:16:01,674 --> 03:16:02,705
Bye-bye.

1172
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:06,169
Well, wait a minute, I must
say goodbye to your husband.

1173
03:16:10,057 --> 03:16:12,014
You know, Rose...

1174
03:16:12,101 --> 03:16:16,181
when you married him, I thought
you could have done a lot better.

1175
03:16:19,191 --> 03:16:21,729
Now I'm not so sure
they come much better.

1176
03:16:23,279 --> 03:16:25,567
Would you tell him that?

1177
03:16:25,656 --> 03:16:28,527
It's not a thing one fellow
can easily say to another.

1178
03:16:32,288 --> 03:16:33,616
Shaughnessy.

1179
03:16:35,040 --> 03:16:36,998
Mike.

1180
03:16:40,171 --> 03:16:41,748
Goodbye, Shaughnessy.

1181
03:16:43,090 --> 03:16:45,083
Goodbye, Mr. Ryan.

1182
03:16:45,176 --> 03:16:47,845
Are you all right for money,
you two? I have a bit by me.

1183
03:16:47,928 --> 03:16:51,712
We're fine for money,
Dad. Thanks. Goodbye.

1184
03:17:02,735 --> 03:17:04,063
Good luck.

1185
03:17:35,643 --> 03:17:38,893
- Get out and don't come back!
- Get out!

1186
03:17:40,856 --> 03:17:41,935
Informer.

1187
03:18:27,152 --> 03:18:29,110
Bus will be here in a minute.

1188
03:18:35,828 --> 03:18:39,078
It's brightened for you, like I said.

1189
03:18:39,165 --> 03:18:40,410
Aye.

1190
03:18:41,250 --> 03:18:43,207
Grand day for a journey.

1191
03:18:45,754 --> 03:18:47,379
Sign of good luck.

1192
03:19:22,917 --> 03:19:24,115
Thanks.

1193
03:19:26,253 --> 03:19:27,747
Bus is coming.

1194
03:19:34,470 --> 03:19:37,803
You won't have an address
in Dublin yet, I suppose.

1195
03:19:38,474 --> 03:19:39,802
No, Father, we...

1196
03:19:39,892 --> 03:19:42,976
I've wrote down here the name
and address of a decent woman...

1197
03:19:43,062 --> 03:19:46,644
who'll ask six shillings a week
for a dry room and a clean bed.

1198
03:19:48,901 --> 03:19:50,940
Six shillings, the pair of you.

1199
03:19:52,404 --> 03:19:55,358
You'll not do better
than that, not in Dublin.

1200
03:19:56,158 --> 03:19:58,365
No, I don't suppose so.

1201
03:20:00,496 --> 03:20:02,120
Thanks, Father.

1202
03:20:22,184 --> 03:20:23,762
Bye, Michael.

1203
03:20:31,151 --> 03:20:34,437
I have a parting gift
for you here, Rose.

1204
03:20:34,530 --> 03:20:37,697
It's supposed to be a fragment
of St. Patrick's staff.

1205
03:20:38,242 --> 03:20:40,650
I don't suppose it is, though.

1206
03:20:43,914 --> 03:20:45,871
God bless you, child.

1207
03:20:47,042 --> 03:20:49,878
Come on, now. Come on, get on up.

1208
03:20:50,838 --> 03:20:52,712
I'll help you load up.

1209
03:21:06,729 --> 03:21:10,394
Thanks, Father. Thanks
for a great many things.

1210
03:21:10,482 --> 03:21:11,858
Charles?

1211
03:21:11,942 --> 03:21:15,607
I think you have it in your mind
that you and Rosy ought to part.

1212
03:21:16,614 --> 03:21:18,820
Yes, I thought as much.

1213
03:21:18,908 --> 03:21:21,909
Well, maybe you're right,
maybe you ought, but I doubt it.

1214
03:21:21,994 --> 03:21:25,445
And that's my parting
gift to you. That doubt.

1215
03:21:29,960 --> 03:21:31,336
God bless.

1216
03:21:44,308 --> 03:21:45,802
I don't know.

1217
03:21:48,103 --> 03:21:51,437
I don't know at all. Come on, Michael.
