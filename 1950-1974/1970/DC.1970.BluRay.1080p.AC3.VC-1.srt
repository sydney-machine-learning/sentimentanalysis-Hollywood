1
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:40,789
Okay, go ahead.

2
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:44,710
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...

3
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,962
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.

4
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,216
I was here when
this crowd really came.

5
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:55,220
We expected fifty thousand a day,
and there must have been a million!

6
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:59,516
I, myself, was hungry for two days,
because I couldn't get any food in.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,726
I couldn't get out to buy any food.

8
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,229
I was eating cornflakes for two days!

9
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,400
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.

10
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,402
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,738
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.

12
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:19,036
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,208
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!

14
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:29,630
And when they see this picture in
the news, over the moving pictures...

15
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,006
...they'll really see something!

16
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:49,066
"It's been a long time coming..."

17
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:57,658
"...because it's been
a long time gone..."

18
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:06,959
"...and it appears to be a long..."

19
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,088
"...appears to be a long..."

20
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,843
"...appears to be a long..."

21
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:20,973
"...time. It's a long,
long, long, long time..."

22
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,642
"...before the dawn."

23
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:37,114
"Turn, turn any corner."

24
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:44,830
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."

25
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:47,833
"...what the people say."

26
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,963
"You know that something..."

27
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:57,301
"...is going on around here."

28
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:02,222
"But surely, surely, surely..."

29
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:05,476
"...one day I'm going to have my day."

30
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:11,565
"Oh, it appears to be
a long, yes it does..."

31
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:16,320
"...appears to be a long..."

32
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,032
"...appears to be a long..."

33
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:26,038
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."

34
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,751
"...before the dawn."

35
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,512
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."

36
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,847
"...against the madness."

37
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,895
"You've got to speak your
mind, yes, today..."

38
00:03:55,943 --> 00:04:00,614
"...but don't, no, don't, don't
try to get yourself elected."

39
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,081
"If you do, you'll have
to cut your hair..."

40
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,089
"...and it appears to be
a long, yes, it does..."

41
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,301
"...appears to be a long..."

42
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,055
"...appears to be a long..."

43
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,103
"...time, such a long,
long, long time..."

44
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,981
"...before the dawn."

45
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:46,660
"It's been a long time coming..."

46
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:54,668
"...it's going to be
a long time gone..."

47
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,175
"...but you know..."

48
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,596
"...the darkest hour..."

49
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:14,104
"...the darkest phase, is always
just before the dawn..."

50
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,612
"...and it appears to be a long..."

51
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,783
"...appears to be a long..."

52
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:31,455
"...appears to be a long time..."

53
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:36,710
"...such a long, long,
long, long time..."

54
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,462
"...before the dawn."

55
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,895
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part
of running one of these things?

56
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,398
The worst part?

57
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,191
What's the worst part of running one?

58
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:01,902
I don't know.

59
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:03,946
You dig it all?

60
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:11,620
I guess the biggest hassle is
dealing with politics. You know.

61
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,789
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?

62
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,000
And you got that solved?

63
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,418
Well, it looks that way.

64
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,838
How long did it take you to put
it together. Two, three months?

65
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,298
Uh, been working on it
for about nine months.

66
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,384
Nine months! Full time?

67
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,639
Are you in charge of the whole thing?

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,807
Yes.

69
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,017
But you got backers?

70
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,686
Partners and backers.

71
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:37,104
Where are you going to go from here?

72
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:38,814
I mean, are you going
to do another one?

73
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:40,274
If it works.

74
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:47,948
Aw, you're really good tonight!

75
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:49,366
You know...

76
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,288
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!

77
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,165
There's only one thing I wish.

78
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,875
I sure have to pee!

79
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,879
And there just is nowhere to go!

80
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,176
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.

81
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,617
"I'm going up the country,
baby, don't you want to go?"

82
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:37,623
"I'm going up the country,
baby, don't you want to go?"

83
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:43,420
"I'm going to someplace,
where I've never been before."

84
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,634
"I'm going, I'm going, where
the water tastes like wine."

85
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:55,849
"I'm going where the
water tastes like wine."

86
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:01,105
"We can jump in the water,
stay drunk all the time."

87
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,962
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."

88
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,968
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."

89
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:37,474
"All this fussing and fighting,
man, you know I sure can't stay."

90
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,354
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."

91
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,690
"Just exactly where
we're going, I cannot say..."

92
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:49,153
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."

93
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:55,576
"Because it's a brand new
game and I want to play."

94
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:19,224
"No use in your running or
screaming and crying..."

95
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:25,230
"...because you've got a home
as long as I've got mine."

96
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:54,695
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."

97
00:10:55,487 --> 00:11:00,159
"...because that is something everybody,
everywhere does in the same way."

98
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:19,178
"I can't see why you called
a friend from the other side."

99
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,515
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."

100
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,853
"...can you tell me who I am?"

101
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,909
"Say, can I have some of
your purple berries?"

102
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,914
"Yes, I've been eating them
six or seven weeks now."

103
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:52,294
"Haven't got sick once,
probably keep us both alive."

104
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,430
"Wooden ships on the water..."

105
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,059
"...very free, easy, easy."

106
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,480
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."

107
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,486
"Silver people on the
shoreline, let us be."

108
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:22,241
"Talking about very free and easy."

109
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:48,267
"All the ships that
watch as you die..."

110
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,440
"...all they can do is
echo your anguished cry."

111
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,362
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"

112
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,826
"We are leaving. You don't need us."

113
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,514
What do you think?

114
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,849
Well, what could I think?

115
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,812
We're in the middle of the, of the
situation and we make the best of it.

116
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,147
It's about all we can do.

117
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:43,197
We were standing on the curbs
watching them come in, uh, last night.

118
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,406
All the townspeople.

119
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,203
It was just like a, an army invading
a town. It's hard to believe.

120
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,329
Do you live here?

121
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,164
No, we're here for a vacation.

122
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,916
Are you having one?

123
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,586
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.

124
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,587
Who is they?

125
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,172
Freaks.

126
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,383
Is that what you call yourselves?

127
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,511
Sure.

128
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,512
Why?

129
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,222
Well, because that's what
everybody else calls us.

130
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,765
What do you call yourself that for?

131
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,560
Because we admit it. Compared
to everybody else, we're freaks.

132
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,564
I don't think you are. As long as you
behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.

133
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,236
I'm not putting bad connotations on the
word "freak", you know. I'm just...

134
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,198
Don't you think that the word "freak"
itself has a bad connotation?

135
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:27,908
It's whatever you think about it.

136
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,746
Last time we saw anything like this was
at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.

137
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,747
That's right.

138
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,462
Like four ice cubes
out of the bag, you know.

139
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,715
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?

140
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,799
Yeah, right.

141
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,054
I don't know, what can you charge
them for ice cubes? You know.

142
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:53,017
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.

143
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,226
Something we needed.

144
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,774
As far as whether it will leave a
favorable effect later, besides money...

145
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,069
...we'll know when the festival is over.

146
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,655
Uh, they're beautiful people.

147
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,246
Well is this festival
affecting you in any way?

148
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,915
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.

149
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:17,958
In what way?

150
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,046
Just to take care of,
to try to get the people fed,

151
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,839
I would say is one of the main
objectives here.

152
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,049
I know all these young fellows here,

153
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,259
they've got to be fed
and they're going to get hungry.

154
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,387
I hope that they can bring
enough supplies in for, for...

155
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,264
That seems to be the big trouble.

156
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,059
And traffic, that's... well, you know
yourself without me telling you.

157
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,268
What's it done for business?

158
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:37,603
Oh, come on.

159
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,690
What's it done?
Increased it about what?

160
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,485
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.

161
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll say one thing for the young people.

162
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,030
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.

163
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,829
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like
some kind of Biblical, epochal...

164
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,123
...unbelievable scene!

165
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,878
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars,

166
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,547
they're strewn on the sides of
the roads from the helicopters and...

167
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,718
...in all different angles, you know. They
look like jackstraws and stuff like that.

168
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,680
There is this continual flow of people
just riding the stream.

169
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,098
They're going along and it...

170
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,060
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.

171
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,938
Well, I mean, I mean,
from a practical point of view,

172
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,357
what do you think,
how could they limit this crowd?

173
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,152
They didn't want this many people
here, really, I don't think.

174
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,906
So you find the control points at
the beginning of the highways...

175
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,035
...and those with tickets are allowed
in and those without tickets are not.

176
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,245
You have to have some control.

177
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,041
You know, when you
have man-eating...

178
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,878
...Barabunda ants coming over
a hill in South America...

179
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,881
...they want to cut them off and stop
them from coming. They make a ditch...

180
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,175
...they put oil in the ditch and
they make a flame.

181
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,219
Now I'm not saying they should put up
flames to stop the people...

182
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,099
...but there has to be some way of
stopping the influx of humanity.

183
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,893
Uh, in numbers, tell me,
how many do you expect?

184
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,186
Two hundred thousand.

185
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,064
Two hundred thousand people
here over the three days?

186
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:05,858
Where will you put them?

187
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,112
We have contracted for land
surrounding the area...

188
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,199
...setting up camp grounds, water
facilities, toilets, electric, food.

189
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,285
What does it cost to put one
of these things together?

190
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,077
A fortune.

191
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,914
And I suppose the returns
will also be good.

192
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,752
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't
know what the returns will come up to...

193
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,879
...up to what it's cost or not, but...

194
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,758
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.

195
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,722
In other words, you have to make
two million dollars to break even?

196
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,184
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.

197
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,145
The point is that it's
happened and it's working...

198
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,397
...and it's enough for now.

199
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,360
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?

200
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,696
What is it the musicians have that they
can communicate so well to the kids?

201
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,405
Music!

202
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,282
I mean, they've always had music.

203
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,743
Music has always been a
major form of communication.

204
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,454
Only now the lyrics and the type
of music is a little bit...

205
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,790
...more involved
in society than it was.

206
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,459
I need something now, let me tell you,

207
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,796
to kind of run as a voice over...
when I'm showing this music on...

208
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,548
If you could, if you could tell me...

209
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,593
...that I can run your voice over
while this music is playing...

210
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,597
...what the music is saying, kind
of, you know, what that's about.

211
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,557
It's about what's happening now...

212
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,769
...and if you listen to the lyrics
and you listen to the, to the rhythm...

213
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,979
...and, and what's in the music...

214
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,648
...then you'll know what's,
what's going on with the culture.

215
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,316
I've got to split.

216
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,152
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.

217
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,868
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.

218
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,412
I'd like to see a little bit of him.

219
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,873
Just natural sound, while he's
getting harassed and bugged. Okay?

220
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,294
Now, goddamnit, I was going
to call you last week!

221
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,341
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.

222
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,802
Now I'm going to order
a five-passenger helicopter.

223
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,179
I'm really scared the roads
are going to get jammed up.

224
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,723
If anybody wants anymore rooms...

225
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,809
...shows up with more people
than they're supposed to have...

226
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,311
...tell them they can drop
back fifteen yards and punt!

227
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,647
They've got about as much chance
as a snow ball in hell...

228
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,816
...of getting a room closer
than Middletown.

229
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,818
There's a Holiday Inn in
Middletown, New York.

230
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,713
Let's clear the road, please!

231
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,884
Peel back, peel back there!
Let them through.

232
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,386
Everything has room to flow here.

233
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,516
Please walk...

234
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,185
...on the grass.

235
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:57,321
Walk on the sides of the road if you're
going to walk through here. Let's go.

236
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,911
How is it out there?

237
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,002
We apologize for the, uh, noise
of the choppity-choppy, but...

238
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,382
...it seems there are a few cars blocking
the road, so we're flying everybody in.

239
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,095
I almost made the worst pun in the world
about high musicians, but we'll skip that.

240
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,931
You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld.

241
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,599
How you doing, man?

242
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,435
Good to see you, man.

243
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,020
Glad you could make the party.

244
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,691
It's going beautifully, man.
Wouldn't have it any other way.

245
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,858
It's really together.

246
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,653
Look at the way...
It really worked out nice, didn't it?

247
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,363
Looks fantastic!

248
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,073
The vibes are so beautiful.

249
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,408
Everybody helps everybody.

250
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,077
Today it feels so great
right here, you know?

251
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,207
How can I ever live on the east
side of Manhattan after this scene?

252
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,920
Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries!

253
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,298
It's perfume! Oh, it is!

254
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,351
"Just Like A Woman"...

255
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,647
...and "Let's Get Stoned."

256
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,904
We're in sync, but you can't
hear a fucking thing...

257
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,659
...because of the fucking helicopters,
so I'm going to quit!

258
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,244
Because of the fucking helicopters...

259
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,622
...I can't get a fucking piece
of dialogue at all, man.

260
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm hanging around
blowing my brains out!

261
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,174
We're getting it tied up.

262
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,092
Two or three of the groups are in.

263
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,762
We're just trying to match up two groups
and equipment and we'll be okay.

264
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,601
Can those of you in the back hear well?

265
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,605
Raise your hands please.
It's all right? Thank you.

266
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,400
Marijuana! Exhibit A.

267
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,072
Look at all those people!

268
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:10,329
The Daily News, in rather large
headlines, still costing ten cents...

269
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,707
..."TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."

270
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,672
See, if you see the,
show the picture in India...

271
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,715
...they won't believe
this is taken in America.

272
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,053
Because their impression
of American children...

273
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,055
...and American ways
is completely different.

274
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,602
All neatly dressed, put on hat
and tie and sitting on chairs.

275
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,229
That's not like this at all.

276
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,401
Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag
with your medicine.

277
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,821
Please meet at the information booth
as soon as you can, please.

278
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,409
Helen Savage, please call your father
at the Motel Glory in Woodridge.

279
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,875
The warning that I've received
you might take it...

280
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,919
...with however many grains
of salt you wish...

281
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:04,758
...that the brown acid that is circulating
around is not specifically too good.

282
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,138
It is suggested that you stay
away from that...

283
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,223
...but it's your own trip, so be my guest.

284
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,184
Please be advised there is
a warning on the one, okay?

285
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,274
Sam, can you get the monitors on?

286
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,695
Get some more guys over here.
This is going to be the heavy side.

287
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,159
Richard Boch, get back to Eddie
Kramer in the sound truck.

288
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,666
- Watch your fingers right up there!
- Hold it.

289
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,051
Mr. Richie Havens!

290
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,906
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

291
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,076
"...marching to the fields of concord?"

292
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,581
"Looks like Handsome Johnny, with
his flintlock in his hand..."

293
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,250
"...marching to the Concord war."

294
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,171
"...hey, marching to the Concord war."

295
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,270
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

296
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,273
"...marching to the fields of Dunkirk?"

297
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,611
"Looks like Handsome Johnny
with a carbine in his hand..."

298
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,364
"...marching to the Dunkirk war."

299
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,868
"Hey, marching to the Dunkirk war."

300
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,972
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

301
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,726
"...marching to the fields of Korea?"

302
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,980
"Looks like Handsome Johnny
with his M-1 in his hand..."

303
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,650
"...marching to the Korean war."

304
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,737
"Hey, marching to the Korean war."

305
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:58,742
"Still marching, still
marching, still marching."

306
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,999
"It's a long, hard road..."

307
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,927
"...that he fought so we'll be free."

308
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:22,016
"That he fought, we'll be free.
Yeah, free!"

309
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:52,713
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

310
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,717
"...marching to the
fields of Birmingham?"

311
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,804
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with
his hand rolled in a fist..."

312
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,974
"...marching to the Birmingham war."

313
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,978
"Hey, marching to the Birmingham war."

314
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,988
"Hey, what's the use
of singing this song?"

315
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,241
"Some of you are not even listening."

316
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,579
"Tell me what it is we've got to do?"

317
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,832
"Wait for the bombs to start whistling?"

318
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,670
"Wait for the blitz to start blitzing?"

319
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,423
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."

320
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,927
"...and here comes a guided missile."

321
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,931
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."

322
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,935
"...I cannot hear it whistle!"

323
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:53,107
"I can almost hear its whistle,
yeah, yeah, yeah!"

324
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,549
There are a hundred million
songs going to be sung tonight.

325
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,344
All of them are going to be
singing about the same thing...

326
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,474
...which I hope everybody who
came, came to hear, really.

327
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:32,062
And it's all about you, actually.

328
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,067
And me and everybody around this stage
and everybody that hasn't gotten here.

329
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,446
And the people who are going
to read about you tomorrow.

330
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,785
And how really groovy you were.

331
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,915
All over the world.
If you can dig where that's at.

332
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,917
That's really where it's really at.

333
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,760
Guitar mike, please.

334
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,779
"Freedom! Freedom!"

335
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:23,382
"Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child..."

336
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:43,318
"...a long way from home."

337
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,827
"Yeah, yeah, Lord..."

338
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,999
"...singing freedom! Freedom!"

339
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:18,270
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm almost gone..."

340
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:45,422
"...a long, long, long
way, way from home."

341
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,221
"Clap your hands!"

342
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,170
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."

343
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,841
"...and I can call
him up from my heart."

344
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,845
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."

345
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,016
"...and I can call him
up from my heart..."

346
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:38,600
"...when I need my brother!"

347
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,688
"When I need my father! "

348
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:46,942
"Mother!"

349
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:50,612
"Sister!"

350
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,658
"When I need my brother!"

351
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,329
"Brother! Hey! Mother! "

352
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,308
"Mr. Richie Havens."

353
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,650
What better way to start than
with the beautiful "Richie Havens."

354
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,329
It's worth it.

355
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,128
Just to see the lights
go on last night, man!

356
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,381
Just to see the people stand up,
man, it makes it worth it.

357
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,554
I mean, I feel there will be people,
you know...

358
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,931
...there are people out there
that really don't dig it.

359
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,599
Very few of them.

360
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:46,103
But you know, it really is to
the point where it's just a family, man.

361
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,817
All box office people please
go to the main box office.

362
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,610
We don't need it any more.

363
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,948
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.

364
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,993
Number two, number three.

365
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,544
You are not giving the world's
greatest three day freebee!

366
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:11,962
Okay, there's only one way to do it.

367
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,297
There's a way to do it, man.

368
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,506
There is no way.

369
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,342
The only way to do it is
to get into a rap with...

370
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,635
It's okay. Come here. Come here.

371
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:24,058
This is one thing I was going to wait
a while before we talked about it.

372
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,311
But maybe we'll talk about it now so
you can think about it.

373
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,855
It's a free concert from now on!

374
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:39,865
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...

375
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,409
...we're going to put the
music up here for free.

376
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,246
What it means is that the people
who are backing this thing...

377
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,540
...who put up the money for it,
are going to take a bit of a bath.

378
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:53,379
A big bath. There's no hype, that's
true. They're going to get hurt.

379
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:58,133
But what it means is that these
people have it in their heads...

380
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,137
...that your welfare is a hell
of a lot more important...

381
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,056
...and so is the music, than a dollar.

382
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,395
Look, when they hook the electricity up,
a great jolt runs all the way through here.

383
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,272
If you've got the ticket,
you disconnect the circuit and...

384
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,024
...otherwise you disintegrate.

385
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,111
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...

386
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,155
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.

387
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:26,078
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.

388
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,541
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim
used to sing there. Did you know that?

389
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,420
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!

390
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,381
Could I get the picture, too?

391
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,760
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?

392
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,263
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?

393
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,348
My name is Hugh.

394
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,268
How do you do? My name is Sue.

395
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,061
I'll see you around.

396
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,940
Ah, here they come, here they come.

397
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:08,370
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.

398
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:12,916
Some people call it bum trips. I don't
think there is such a thing as a bum trip.

399
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,045
We're working with hobo voyages.

400
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,257
A half an hour after we release anybody
from our section...

401
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,550
...we turn them into doctors...

402
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:26,930
...and they care for people that were
tripping like they were when they came in.

403
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,061
Now people have been saying that
some of this acid is poison.

404
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:37,066
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.

405
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,609
If you can find out who it is, we...

406
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,987
Anybody who thinks they've
taken some poison, forget it.

407
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:47,159
And if you feel like experimenting,
only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.

408
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:08,532
You know, the Japanese
made that motorcycle.

409
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,579
The Japanese affected that
thing over there...

410
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,791
...with the yellow robes,
or the Indian.

411
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,382
Really does a lot for the music
that motorcycle.

412
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:09,513
Who's on?

413
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,516
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.

414
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,729
So the order of everything
just went kaplooey?

415
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:18,188
You're closing tonight, honey.

416
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:23,193
Maybe there'll be
a few more people here by then.

417
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,737
I don't like a puny gathering like this.

418
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:34,204
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of
my husband, David's, favorite songs.

419
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:38,542
And let me just tell you
that he is fine. And...

420
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:52,014
...and we're fine too.

421
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:58,479
And David was just shifted
from the county jail...

422
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:03,317
...which is very much of a drag,
to Federal prison...

423
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,319
...which is kind of like
a big summer camp...

424
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:08,155
...after you've been
in county jail long enough.

425
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:09,865
See I just, just now got a letter.

426
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:14,578
I have it with me. About the trip from the
county jail. Manacles on his legs...

427
00:49:14,912 --> 00:49:19,249
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.

428
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:23,087
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...

429
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,757
...where the first time he felt afraid
in the whole thing, was a couple of...

430
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,303
...I guess guards, or something,
they started talking very loud.

431
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:32,429
And he started saying...

432
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:34,807
...talking about the last draft case
that they had been through...

433
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:37,101
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll
get you, motherfucker," you know?

434
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:40,729
He just prayed a little bit harder.

435
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:45,442
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but
it's not a very comfortable feeling.

436
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:47,236
But nothing has happened.

437
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,907
Anyway, this is, this
is an organizing song.

438
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:53,909
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...

439
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:56,453
...after David had been in jail
for two and a half weeks...

440
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:59,081
...he already had a very,
very good hunger strike...

441
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:01,458
...going on with forty-two
federal prisoners...

442
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:04,044
...none of whom were draft people.

443
00:50:10,884 --> 00:50:14,888
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."

444
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:20,394
"...alive as you and me."

445
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:27,192
"Sez I, 'But Joe,
you're ten years dead!"'

446
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:32,281
"'I never died, ' said he."

447
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:46,128
"'The copper bosses
killed you, Joe!"'

448
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:50,174
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."

449
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:57,056
"'Takes more than guns
to kill a man'..."

450
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,643
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'

451
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:15,699
"And standing there as big as life..."

452
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,162
"...and smiling with his eyes."

453
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:26,710
"Says Joe, 'What they
can never kill,"

454
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:31,298
"...went on to organize."'

455
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,562
"From San Diego up to Maine..."

456
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:49,984
"...in every mine and mill..."

457
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:56,573
"...where working men
defend their rights..."

458
00:51:57,032 --> 00:52:00,494
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"

459
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:10,689
"Swing low..."

460
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,030
"...sweet chariot..."

461
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,580
"...coming to carry me home."

462
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:37,299
"Swing low..."

463
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:44,056
"...sweet chariot..."

464
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:51,897
"...coming for to carry me on home."

465
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:01,323
"Well, I looked over yonder..."

466
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:04,994
"...and what did I see..."

467
00:54:07,788 --> 00:54:12,418
"...coming to carry me home?"

468
00:54:17,464 --> 00:54:21,427
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."

469
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:31,103
"...were a-coming for me..."

470
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:37,526
"...coming for to carry me on home."

471
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:47,286
"Swing low..."

472
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,629
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."

473
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:05,637
"...coming for to carry
me on home. Home!"

474
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,268
"See me,"

475
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,231
"feel me,"

476
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:01,943
"touch me,"

477
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,781
"heal me."

478
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:06,257
"Listening to you, I get music."

479
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,179
"Gazing at you, I get heat."

480
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,351
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."

481
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,521
"I get excitement at your feet."

482
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:28,529
"Right behind you, I see the millions."

483
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:33,326
"On you, I see the glory."

484
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:37,997
"From you, I get opinions."

485
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:42,460
"From you, I get the story."

486
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:48,966
"Listening to you, I get music."

487
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:53,179
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."

488
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:57,642
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."

489
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:01,479
"I get excitement at your feet."

490
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:08,069
"From behind you, I see the millions."

491
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:12,240
"On you, I see the glory."

492
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,327
"From you, I get opinions."

493
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:20,373
"From you, I get the story."

494
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:53,878
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."

495
01:01:57,131 --> 01:02:01,135
"...about a-working all summer,
just to try and earn a dollar."

496
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:07,725
"Well, I went to the boss,
said, 'I've got a date."'

497
01:02:08,101 --> 01:02:11,479
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'

498
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:15,149
"Sometimes, I wonder
what I'm going to do."

499
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:19,237
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."

500
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:37,338
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'

501
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:44,595
"'... if you want to use the
car to go riding next Sunday."'

502
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:51,019
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."

503
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:55,189
"Says they, 'You can't use the car,
because you didn't work a lick."'

504
01:02:55,523 --> 01:02:58,693
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."

505
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:02,864
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."

506
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:18,356
"I'm going to take two weeks,
going to have a fine vacation."

507
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:25,446
"Going to take my problems
to the United Nations."

508
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:31,786
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."

509
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,790
"'... l'd like to help you, son,
but you're too young to vote."'

510
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:39,377
"Sometimes I wonder
what I'm going to do."

511
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:43,798
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."

512
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:22,313
Ladies and gentlemen...

513
01:06:26,526 --> 01:06:27,527
...The Who!

514
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,995
The word I get is that...

515
01:06:37,245 --> 01:06:39,247
...maybe the best thing
for everybody to do...

516
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:42,000
...unless you have a tent
or some place specific to go to...

517
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:46,212
...just carve yourself out
a piece of territory...

518
01:06:47,255 --> 01:06:48,589
...say goodnight to your neighbor...

519
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:55,054
...and say thank you to yourself
for making this the most peaceful...

520
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:58,474
...most pleasant day anybody has
ever had in this kind of music.

521
01:07:07,442 --> 01:07:08,276
Well, music is a thing that...

522
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,194
Well, you're obviously
not here for the girls.

523
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,530
Oh, that's good, that's a basic
thing, you know, like...

524
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:14,907
...there are a lot of girls here
and they're probably...

525
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:16,951
...a lot freer than,
you know, other places.

526
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:20,079
I'm sure there's going
to be a lot of balling.

527
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,624
Well, you bring your own coals
to Newcastle?

528
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:26,294
Are you two going together
or are you just hitching together?

529
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:31,215
We've lived together for about
four months, or five months.

530
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,219
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...

531
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:37,555
...a communal thing, or someone
else would call a communal thing.

532
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:40,725
But it's just, we just live together...

533
01:07:40,892 --> 01:07:43,186
...and so we just decided to come down
together because we were coming here.

534
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:47,190
And like there's nothing, I mean,
no definite thing about...

535
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,359
We're not necessarily going to be
together throughout the whole thing.

536
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,527
So you're not particularly
jealous of him?

537
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,781
Are you two going together?

538
01:07:56,366 --> 01:07:57,408
But you two came up here together.

539
01:07:59,285 --> 01:07:59,952
You like that?

540
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:03,748
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.

541
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:05,750
What do you think about all this?

542
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,585
Well, the way I look at it...

543
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:12,256
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.

544
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:15,176
When he moved into the family group...

545
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:17,261
...that I was alr...
that I already knew for quite a while...

546
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:22,767
...in that time, I got to know him
real well and I learned to love him.

547
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,604
Like, you know, we ball
and everything, but...

548
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:31,275
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.

549
01:08:31,651 --> 01:08:35,488
Because if we're not going together and
we're not in love or anything like that...

550
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,450
Can you communicate
with your parents?

551
01:08:39,826 --> 01:08:43,413
I can communicate with
them on, on one level.

552
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:46,124
Now that I've been away
from home for two years.

553
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,792
But at first it was very rough.
Now...

554
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:51,796
...they, you know, they're beginning
to mellow about it.

555
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:53,798
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.

556
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:56,467
But I can't really communicate to them...

557
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:59,387
...about anything that's really important
because they just could not understand it.

558
01:09:00,263 --> 01:09:02,807
My mother is really, she really...

559
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:04,183
...lives in a lot of pain...

560
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,644
...because she's sure I'm going to
go to hell and there's nothing I can do...

561
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:11,149
...to tell her that there is,
that it just does not exist for me.

562
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:15,445
So I, there's no communication
on, on those levels.

563
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:19,198
My father was asking whether I was in a
communist training camp or something...

564
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:20,992
...in, in the house that I lived in.

565
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,830
I could understand, you know, where
he came from. Because when he...

566
01:09:26,914 --> 01:09:27,915
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.

567
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,334
And so he came over here
to better himself...

568
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,544
...economically and so forth,
and all that other rot.

569
01:09:32,545 --> 01:09:36,341
And, to make it better for me and he can't
understand why I didn't play, you know...

570
01:09:37,008 --> 01:09:38,384
...saying, "Why aren't
you playing the game?"

571
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:42,013
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...

572
01:09:42,055 --> 01:09:43,348
...which have so much value."

573
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:45,308
But they only have value to him...

574
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:47,810
...and he can't understand
why they don't have value to me.

575
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:52,315
But he does have wisdom enough
to know, to allow me to be who I am.

576
01:09:55,026 --> 01:09:57,153
I guess he had some kind of
idea in his head that...

577
01:09:57,904 --> 01:10:01,824
...I will, by doing what I'm doing,
learn for myself how to live.

578
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:03,868
And that's what he wants me to do,
anyway.

579
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,995
So he, he can't understand
why I am the way I am...

580
01:10:06,329 --> 01:10:08,539
...but he, he very much wants
me to be that way.

581
01:10:08,665 --> 01:10:10,833
Because he knows that's
the only thing for me.

582
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:13,878
He started his trip when
he was four years old.

583
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:14,837
Really?

584
01:10:14,879 --> 01:10:16,881
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?

585
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:19,050
Me, neither.

586
01:10:19,926 --> 01:10:21,219
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?

587
01:10:21,594 --> 01:10:24,722
I, I don't know. I, I used
to be into drugs and...

588
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:29,352
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...

589
01:10:29,686 --> 01:10:31,896
...now it seems like
it's almost contrived.

590
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,484
It's like drugs and revolution
and the united front and all.

591
01:10:38,528 --> 01:10:41,197
You know, I'm a human being and that's
all I want to be. And I don't...

592
01:10:42,991 --> 01:10:44,575
...I don't want to have a mass change...

593
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:47,620
...because a mass change only brings
around mass insanity.

594
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:52,917
I just want to be myself and find
out, find a place where I can...

595
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:58,589
...maintain some kind of
balance within myself, you know.

596
01:10:58,965 --> 01:11:01,926
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip,
you know. To be or not to be.

597
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:05,638
Do you think you could ever communicate
with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?

598
01:11:05,805 --> 01:11:06,806
I hope so.

599
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:08,641
They're doing their thing, aren't they?

600
01:11:09,392 --> 01:11:13,104
I don't know. It's like they,
they're neurotic or psychotic or...

601
01:11:13,813 --> 01:11:16,232
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.

602
01:11:16,566 --> 01:11:17,984
They could say the same thing of you.

603
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:22,572
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
I, I don't need all that power, you know.

604
01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:25,742
Where I can just, I can just sit
here right on this roadside...

605
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:28,786
...and I, I don't have to become
President of the United States.

606
01:11:28,828 --> 01:11:31,122
And I don't have to go all that way up.

607
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,124
I don't have to make the climb.

608
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:37,420
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.

609
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,381
Do you have tickets to this thing?

610
01:11:40,757 --> 01:11:41,424
No.

611
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:43,092
How are you going to get in?

612
01:11:46,888 --> 01:11:47,847
I don't really know.

613
01:11:50,558 --> 01:11:51,893
I figured, you know, once I got here...

614
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:54,646
...l'd see whatever happens
and go along with it.

615
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:58,066
It's like people that are nowhere
are coming here...

616
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:59,609
...because there are people
they think are somewhere...

617
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:03,446
...so everybody is really looking for,
you know, for some kind of answer.

618
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:04,906
Where there isn't one.

619
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:08,284
Why would three hundred thousand...

620
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:10,036
...or a hundred and
twenty thousand sixty thousand...

621
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:12,538
...seventy thousand people come
to anything just because it's music?

622
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:16,959
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.

623
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:22,006
People don't know, they don't know how
to live and they don't know what to do...

624
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:23,341
...and they think that if they...

625
01:12:23,383 --> 01:12:25,593
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...

626
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:27,011
...or how to maintain with it.

627
01:12:29,055 --> 01:12:31,015
It's just like people
are very lost, I think.

628
01:12:34,227 --> 01:12:38,856
America leads the whole
world in several ways.

629
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:45,154
Very recently, when
I was in the East...

630
01:12:46,906 --> 01:12:48,866
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...

631
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:54,372
...met me and asked me...

632
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:57,041
...what's happening in America?

633
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:01,838
And I said,

634
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,467
"America is becoming a whole."

635
01:13:09,262 --> 01:13:12,515
"America is helping everybody..."

636
01:13:13,933 --> 01:13:15,393
"...in the material field..."

637
01:13:16,978 --> 01:13:21,649
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."

638
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:24,736
"...with spirituality, also."

639
01:13:50,553 --> 01:13:51,220
"At the hop..."

640
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,557
"...we can rock to and fro and
never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."

641
01:13:55,767 --> 01:13:57,935
"When the records are playing,
people eat a lot of chicken..."

642
01:13:58,019 --> 01:13:59,020
"...at the hop, hop, hop."

643
01:13:59,395 --> 01:14:02,106
"If you've got a little chicken, share
it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."

644
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:06,069
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."

645
01:14:06,402 --> 01:14:11,074
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"

646
01:14:23,544 --> 01:14:27,507
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the
hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"

647
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,635
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."

648
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,973
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"

649
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:47,860
"We will go rocking and rolling
and stomping at the hop!"

650
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,531
"When the records are playing and the
women start a-singing at the hop!"

651
01:15:06,462 --> 01:15:08,172
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "

652
01:15:08,798 --> 01:15:13,469
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."

653
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,056
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"

654
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,226
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Sha-Na-Na!

655
01:15:44,602 --> 01:15:45,728
Harold, turn up the mike.

656
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:52,359
Now, very slowly, start coming back up.

657
01:15:52,777 --> 01:15:55,529
Lower the lock and
pull yourself back up.

658
01:16:04,497 --> 01:16:06,582
And then keep breathing
as fast as you can.

659
01:16:09,293 --> 01:16:10,377
Then exhale.

660
01:16:14,965 --> 01:16:18,344
And relax. Then just feel the energy.

661
01:16:19,804 --> 01:16:23,766
These, these are all beginning
exercises of Kundalini Yoga.

662
01:16:24,433 --> 01:16:25,726
Yoga means union.

663
01:16:26,393 --> 01:16:30,106
It's the same energy force that
drugs give you with a rush.

664
01:16:30,564 --> 01:16:31,899
Right? It's, it's the same channels...

665
01:16:31,982 --> 01:16:35,236
...only drugs do it for you
and this way you can do it yourself.

666
01:16:36,278 --> 01:16:37,238
You can do it when you want to...

667
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:38,948
...and you don't have to score
to be able to do it.

668
01:16:39,073 --> 01:16:40,574
All you've got to score is some clean air.

669
01:16:41,617 --> 01:16:42,576
I learned it in Los Angeles.

670
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,122
And there was only a couple of months
of clean air when I was learning it.

671
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:49,542
That's hard, too, these days.

672
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,795
But while there's still some
clean air left, it would be groovy to...

673
01:16:53,129 --> 01:16:56,215
...experiment with it like those guys
who have been experimenting for...

674
01:16:56,924 --> 01:16:59,969
...at least six thousand years
and getting very high behind it.

675
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:04,598
The Kundalini nerve, it's
called the nerve of awareness.

676
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:08,644
You can't dissect it. It's a current
that runs up the center of your spine.

677
01:17:09,812 --> 01:17:11,814
I don't know if any of you
have ever sat down...

678
01:17:11,856 --> 01:17:14,150
...and crossed your legs and smoked
DMT and watched what happens.

679
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:15,818
But what happens to me is this big thing...

680
01:17:15,901 --> 01:17:19,155
...goes "uuurrrah" up my spine!
And flashes in my brain!

681
01:17:20,573 --> 01:17:25,244
Well apparently, that's what is going
to happen if I do this stuff and learn it.

682
01:17:25,786 --> 01:17:28,831
It takes years, I guess,
but this is the beginning of it.

683
01:17:28,998 --> 01:17:30,833
These exercises are exercises to create...

684
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:34,628
...those channels in your body
and to free your body of blocks.

685
01:17:35,212 --> 01:17:36,589
The major block is your solar plexus.

686
01:17:36,672 --> 01:17:38,966
That's why we're doing
a lot of breath of fire.

687
01:17:39,425 --> 01:17:40,760
It loosens the solar plexus.

688
01:17:41,135 --> 01:17:42,636
And there are blocks in your spine and...

689
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,806
...back and wherever you've got blocks,
to keep that energy from flowing.

690
01:17:48,184 --> 01:17:50,978
Go within yourself and
meditate on each breath.

691
01:17:51,312 --> 01:17:53,856
Make each breath a complete breath.

692
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:58,444
And if you do it right,
you'll be flashing momentarily.

693
01:18:17,671 --> 01:18:21,342
Just keep up, concentrate on your
breathing and hold that position.

694
01:18:22,009 --> 01:18:24,678
Roll your toes forward
so they point forward.

695
01:18:41,195 --> 01:18:43,864
We're going to leave you
with the usual thing.

696
01:18:44,115 --> 01:18:48,869
Only thing I can say, as I said to so
many people, this title, just about...

697
01:18:50,788 --> 01:18:54,250
...puts it all into focus. It's called
"With A Little Help From My Friends."

698
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:55,584
Remember it.

699
01:20:04,945 --> 01:20:09,617
"What would you do if
I sang out of tune..."

700
01:20:11,702 --> 01:20:15,289
"...would you stand up
and walk out on me?"

701
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:22,171
"Lend me your ears and
I'll sing you a song."

702
01:20:24,882 --> 01:20:28,636
"I will try not to sing
out of tune, yes."

703
01:20:29,386 --> 01:20:31,639
"Oh, I'll get by..."

704
01:20:31,931 --> 01:20:34,058
"...with a little help from my friends."

705
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:37,895
"Well, I never come up alive."

706
01:20:40,898 --> 01:20:44,485
"Hey, there are so many ways."

707
01:20:47,113 --> 01:20:50,866
"Well, I'm going back
there for my friends."

708
01:20:55,329 --> 01:20:59,917
"What do I do when my love is away?"

709
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:05,423
"Does it worry you to be alone?"

710
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:07,967
"Ho, no, no."

711
01:21:08,801 --> 01:21:13,514
"How do I feel at the end of the day?"

712
01:21:14,098 --> 01:21:17,351
"Are you sad because
you're on your own?"

713
01:21:18,769 --> 01:21:21,689
"I'll tell, never say it any more."

714
01:21:21,981 --> 01:21:24,233
"Going to get a little
help from my friends."

715
01:21:26,235 --> 01:21:28,904
"I've got to buy favors for them."

716
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:35,369
"Don't bother about the love I gave."

717
01:21:37,955 --> 01:21:41,375
"Help me find my way."

718
01:21:50,926 --> 01:21:53,763
"Do you need anybody?"

719
01:21:56,849 --> 01:22:00,019
"Oh, I need someone to love."

720
01:22:03,022 --> 01:22:06,108
"Could it be anybody?"

721
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:10,112
"Oh, I need somebody..."

722
01:22:11,781 --> 01:22:14,617
"...to dream about. I know her."

723
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,417
"Oh, I love her."

724
01:22:27,838 --> 01:22:32,510
"Well, I'm going there,
I'm going there."

725
01:22:33,803 --> 01:22:36,305
"Then I'm going to say
that I'll know my way."

726
01:22:40,559 --> 01:22:44,772
"Don't you know I care for my friends?"

727
01:22:48,776 --> 01:22:53,447
"Would you believe in
a love at first sight?"

728
01:22:56,367 --> 01:23:00,538
"I'm sure that it happens all the time."

729
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:01,789
"You know it does."

730
01:23:02,081 --> 01:23:06,752
"What do you see when
you turn out the light?"

731
01:23:08,879 --> 01:23:10,631
"I don't see nothing."

732
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:23,644
"I told you I get a lift, I've got
to have a lift from my friends."

733
01:23:26,105 --> 01:23:29,066
"Nobody cares the way I feel now."

734
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:35,197
"Oh, I sat there all alone."

735
01:23:44,248 --> 01:23:47,585
"Do you need anybody?"

736
01:23:53,299 --> 01:23:57,052
"Oh, Lord, I don't need anybody."

737
01:23:57,595 --> 01:24:00,389
"Could it be that you're lonely?"

738
01:24:01,098 --> 01:24:02,892
"Oh, Lord, I love her. I'll stand by."

739
01:24:05,311 --> 01:24:07,980
"Going to dream about her, I know I am."

740
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:12,443
"Somebody said, 'Oh, I love her'."

741
01:24:27,124 --> 01:24:31,837
"I've got to get my friends, I've
got to get my friends to go..."

742
01:24:33,964 --> 01:24:38,636
"Don't you know I said,
there before your eyes...?"

743
01:24:43,182 --> 01:24:44,850
"...l've got to get
my friends together."

744
01:24:49,814 --> 01:24:52,566
"All I've got to do is that now."

745
01:25:01,492 --> 01:25:03,661
"I'm going to take them
home with me now."

746
01:25:07,498 --> 01:25:10,167
"You've got to get
all your friends now."

747
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:16,298
"...you've got to get
all your friends now."

748
01:25:18,592 --> 01:25:20,219
"Nobody goes away..."

749
01:25:24,056 --> 01:25:26,934
"...nobody goes away, yeah."

750
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:30,604
"You've got your friends,
you've got your friends..."

751
01:25:31,522 --> 01:25:33,482
"...you've got your friends, yeah."

752
01:26:10,227 --> 01:26:12,646
"With a little help from my friends."

753
01:26:13,898 --> 01:26:16,400
"Got to have love from my friends."

754
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:37,671
The Grease Band and myself
thank you all very much, indeed.

755
01:26:38,506 --> 01:26:40,007
See you again! Beautiful!

756
01:27:12,373 --> 01:27:14,875
It looks like we're going to get a
little bit of rain, so you better cover up.

757
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:20,464
If it does and if we should have
any slight power problems...

758
01:27:21,715 --> 01:27:25,928
...just cool it out. We'll sit
here with you. It will be okay.

759
01:27:30,099 --> 01:27:32,435
All right, everybody, just sit down,
wrap yourself up.

760
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:34,270
We're going to have to ride it out.

761
01:27:37,231 --> 01:27:38,732
Hold on to your neighbor, man.

762
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:44,780
Please get off those towers!
We don't need any extra weight on them!

763
01:27:52,329 --> 01:27:56,625
Please move away from the towers.
The lamps might give us a problem.

764
01:27:57,084 --> 01:28:00,504
Everybody who is in the
back, please move back.

765
01:28:03,174 --> 01:28:05,009
We have to get away from these towers.

766
01:28:06,093 --> 01:28:07,845
Please move away from the towers!

767
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:12,516
Put the mike stands down on the floor.
Cover all the equipment.

768
01:28:15,519 --> 01:28:17,146
Let's keep it nice and cool.

769
01:28:18,522 --> 01:28:21,525
We'll be back with Country Joe in just
a second as soon as we get set up.

770
01:28:22,693 --> 01:28:24,945
Okay, so come on down off the towers.

771
01:28:29,533 --> 01:28:34,205
Hey, if you think really hard,
maybe we can stop this rain! Yeah.

772
01:28:36,874 --> 01:28:38,793
Please move away from the towers.

773
01:28:42,546 --> 01:28:44,799
Jody, get off the stage.

774
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:53,891
The wind is blowing this way.
Please be on this side of the towers.

775
01:28:54,225 --> 01:28:57,812
Everyone in the back, please move back.
Just take it calm and easy.

776
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:06,487
I see it. Please move
away from the towers.

777
01:29:16,705 --> 01:29:19,083
I think the wind has run through it.
It is okay?

778
01:29:24,547 --> 01:29:28,676
Give us some room. Go slowly,
but move back. It will be cool.

779
01:29:29,009 --> 01:29:30,010
Just move away from those towers!

780
01:29:30,094 --> 01:29:32,680
We don't want one
of those lamps to be blown. Please!

781
01:29:35,599 --> 01:29:38,519
That's it. Everybody just help get
away from the towers and clear them.

782
01:29:39,437 --> 01:29:44,066
And look up, very seriously. Let's
think hard to get rid of it, please.

783
01:29:44,692 --> 01:29:47,903
No rain! No rain! No rain!

784
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:03,210
Keep thinking it!
Keep your eyes on those towers.

785
01:30:05,421 --> 01:30:06,756
It's going to blow through.

786
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:10,092
Try and keep yourselves comfortable.
And keep an eye on the towers.

787
01:30:10,718 --> 01:30:12,720
Hey, cut the power off
up there, all right?

788
01:30:13,053 --> 01:30:13,721
What do you want?

789
01:30:18,309 --> 01:30:20,978
We're going to have to turn off
some microphones for a minute.

790
01:30:21,812 --> 01:30:24,899
Hang in there with us.
God bless you and watch those towers.

791
01:30:45,336 --> 01:30:46,629
Let me get down with the mike.

792
01:31:57,908 --> 01:31:58,993
Oh, can I talk to you a minute?

793
01:31:59,577 --> 01:32:01,036
Sure. What do you want to know?

794
01:32:01,412 --> 01:32:02,204
Do you like the rain?

795
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,832
Yes, yes. It's nice.
It, it gets you clean.

796
01:32:05,249 --> 01:32:08,252
What are you thinking about?
Does, is this encouraging, or what?

797
01:32:08,586 --> 01:32:11,505
Definitely not. It's great! Just a
little added attraction, that's all.

798
01:32:11,922 --> 01:32:15,217
You, at least, you don't have
to wait for clothes to get dry.

799
01:32:16,594 --> 01:32:18,888
Groovy! I dig it! I dig it!

800
01:32:19,346 --> 01:32:22,183
Do you think it's coming off well
with all those fuck-ups, or what?

801
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,020
Yes. The only, the only
hassle is the mud, that's all.

802
01:32:38,866 --> 01:32:43,079
Does this discourage you at all?
Or is it all right?

803
01:32:43,454 --> 01:32:44,413
Mud. A drag!

804
01:32:45,289 --> 01:32:46,248
I can't believe it!

805
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:55,132
Do you feel discouraged at all,
or is this all right?

806
01:32:55,466 --> 01:32:56,383
It's a bummer!

807
01:32:56,759 --> 01:32:57,718
It's fine.

808
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:09,939
Peace, brother!

809
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:23,411
I've got something to say.

810
01:33:23,494 --> 01:33:25,913
I want to know how come the Fascist
pigs have been seeding the clouds?

811
01:33:26,247 --> 01:33:27,748
Right! For the last hour and a half.

812
01:33:28,082 --> 01:33:29,250
Going over twice with that, with all...

813
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:32,294
...with all the smoke coming out of them,
seeding the clouds.

814
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:35,464
I want to know, know why that
stuff is going down there.

815
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,801
And why doesn't the media
report that stuff to the people?

816
01:33:39,176 --> 01:33:40,469
You want to talk about what's happened?

817
01:33:40,845 --> 01:33:41,804
I'm telling you these planes...

818
01:33:41,887 --> 01:33:44,348
...come over an hour and a half
and they seeded all the clouds.

819
01:33:44,682 --> 01:33:46,767
This is the second time
they did it today!

820
01:33:50,146 --> 01:33:52,440
I don't know what they
hope to prove, man.

821
01:33:54,692 --> 01:33:55,860
What's going on here?

822
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:10,124
Sharon Silverstein,
return home immediately.

823
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:13,878
Your father has been taken
for open heart surgery.

824
01:34:14,754 --> 01:34:17,882
Please stop at the
information booth right away.

825
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,223
The first Aquarian Exposition.

826
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,982
The forecast for this afternoon is...

827
01:38:03,441 --> 01:38:07,361
...intermittent entertainment
between intermittent showers.

828
01:38:07,862 --> 01:38:10,656
Somebody was saying this is the
second largest city in New York.

829
01:38:11,031 --> 01:38:14,785
There's been no police.
There's been no trouble.

830
01:38:15,161 --> 01:38:16,162
If you check the statistics out...

831
01:38:16,245 --> 01:38:17,037
...you'll find that...

832
01:38:17,121 --> 01:38:19,874
...these people have lived,
over three hundred thousand people...

833
01:38:20,249 --> 01:38:22,960
...have lived together peacefully,
loving each other...

834
01:38:25,045 --> 01:38:28,382
...feeling for each other, want,
needing for each other...

835
01:38:28,883 --> 01:38:30,968
...and wanting to make
this the experience it is.

836
01:38:40,186 --> 01:38:41,061
What are they doing?

837
01:38:41,395 --> 01:38:44,273
They're dropping dry, they're
dropping flowers and dry clothes.

838
01:38:44,648 --> 01:38:45,733
Out of that helicopter?

839
01:38:48,069 --> 01:38:50,446
You said a moment ago that
this wasn't the end of this festival...

840
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:52,156
...that this was a beginning.

841
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:53,699
What do you mean, a beginning?

842
01:38:55,159 --> 01:38:55,993
Well, well, look at it!

843
01:38:57,203 --> 01:38:59,163
This is the beginning
of this kind of thing.

844
01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:07,755
This culture and generation, away from
the old culture and the older generation.

845
01:39:08,839 --> 01:39:10,341
And you see how they
function on their own.

846
01:39:10,716 --> 01:39:13,969
Without cops, without guns,
without clubs, without hassle.

847
01:39:14,345 --> 01:39:17,139
Everybody pulls together and everybody
helps each other and it works.

848
01:39:17,181 --> 01:39:19,058
It's been working since we got here.

849
01:39:19,683 --> 01:39:20,684
And it's going to continue working.

850
01:39:20,768 --> 01:39:23,896
And no matter what happens when they
go back to the city, this thing happened.

851
01:39:24,188 --> 01:39:25,481
And it proves that it can happen.

852
01:39:27,525 --> 01:39:30,861
That's what it's all about, you know.
That's the whole thing right there.

853
01:39:34,532 --> 01:39:37,535
Mr. Kornfeld, was, was this
a suc... , a financial success?

854
01:39:37,868 --> 01:39:40,704
From the point of view of
the fellows that put it on?

855
01:39:41,038 --> 01:39:42,456
It was a financial disaster!

856
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:44,917
Why do you say that?

857
01:39:45,209 --> 01:39:47,920
Well, we just opened the gates and let
everybody in. It's a free festival...

858
01:39:49,713 --> 01:39:51,757
...paid for by the people
who put up the money...

859
01:39:52,216 --> 01:39:54,552
...or the people that are
going to have to pay it back?

860
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:58,347
Uh, paid for by the people
who bought the tickets.

861
01:39:58,889 --> 01:40:02,977
The two hundred thousand, of which I
don't know how many of them got here.

862
01:40:04,812 --> 01:40:08,274
No, this was paid for by, by
all the people that bought it.

863
01:40:09,066 --> 01:40:10,067
By all the people...

864
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:13,738
...that had the thought that put it
to the point, to get us in a position...

865
01:40:15,156 --> 01:40:17,158
...to just be a tool,
like, like a vehicle...

866
01:40:17,241 --> 01:40:19,368
...like everybody else.
Just to get it to this point.

867
01:40:19,744 --> 01:40:20,661
You're in the red?

868
01:40:20,995 --> 01:40:21,996
Oh? The company?

869
01:40:22,788 --> 01:40:25,458
Financially? If you tried
to think in those terms...

870
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:28,627
...when you're talking
about something like this...

871
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:30,921
...financially, this is a disaster.

872
01:40:31,672 --> 01:40:32,923
But you, you, you look so happy!

873
01:40:33,257 --> 01:40:33,924
I'm very happy!

874
01:40:35,092 --> 01:40:36,260
You can't buy that for anything!

875
01:40:36,594 --> 01:40:38,804
Sure, this is really beautiful, man!

876
01:40:39,263 --> 01:40:41,265
These people are communicating
with each other.

877
01:40:41,307 --> 01:40:43,309
That, that rarely happens
anywhere anymore.

878
01:40:44,185 --> 01:40:47,772
It has nothing to do with money.
It has nothing to do with tangible things.

879
01:40:49,607 --> 01:40:51,275
You have to realize
the turnabout...

880
01:40:51,358 --> 01:40:54,278
...that I've gone through in the last,
in the last three days.

881
01:40:55,029 --> 01:40:58,949
In the last three million years
that I, meaning us, all of us...

882
01:40:59,283 --> 01:41:00,701
What do you mean, the turnabout
in the last three days?

883
01:41:01,035 --> 01:41:05,706
Just to see, just to really realize,
what's really important.

884
01:41:07,291 --> 01:41:10,628
The fact that, that if we can all
live together and be happy...

885
01:41:10,961 --> 01:41:13,047
...if you have to be afraid
to walk out in the street...

886
01:41:13,339 --> 01:41:16,675
...if you have to be afraid
to smile at somebody...

887
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:21,722
...what kind of a way is that
to go through this life?

888
01:41:27,853 --> 01:41:29,396
Marijuana!

889
01:41:29,814 --> 01:41:34,443
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Waters, Country Joe and The Fish!

890
01:41:48,499 --> 01:41:49,834
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

891
01:41:51,335 --> 01:41:52,962
We're certainly delighted
to be here today.

892
01:41:54,713 --> 01:41:56,715
I'd like to start off
my portion of the show...

893
01:41:56,799 --> 01:41:59,135
...by giving you a taste
of a little something we call...

894
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:01,345
...rock and soul music.

895
01:42:57,068 --> 01:42:58,903
"Oh, your love is like a rainbow..."

896
01:42:59,987 --> 01:43:02,364
"...your love is like a
rainbow, darling. Now..."

897
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:05,451
"...your love is like
a rainbow, I said..."

898
01:43:05,826 --> 01:43:10,456
"...your love is like a rainbow,
all around my shoulders, yeah..."

899
01:43:10,915 --> 01:43:12,917
"...performing all around my shoulders."

900
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,544
"You know that your love
is like a rainbow..."

901
01:43:16,921 --> 01:43:20,925
"...falling all around my shoulders.
And I said I love you..."

902
01:43:21,342 --> 01:43:24,678
"...you know I do!"

903
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:31,477
A lot of freaks!

904
01:43:49,954 --> 01:43:53,374
"Coming in from London
from over the Pole..."

905
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:57,294
"...flying in a big airliner..."

906
01:43:58,212 --> 01:44:02,466
"...chickens flying everywhere
around the plane."

907
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,762
"Could we ever feel much finer..."

908
01:44:07,138 --> 01:44:09,765
"...coming into Los Angeles..."

909
01:44:11,475 --> 01:44:13,727
"...bringing in a couple of keys?"

910
01:44:15,729 --> 01:44:20,401
"Don't touch my bags, if you
please, Mr. Customs Man."

911
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,616
"A guy with a ticket to Mexico..."

912
01:44:28,534 --> 01:44:31,537
"...no, he couldn't
look much stranger..."

913
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:36,625
"...walking in a hall with
his things and all..."

914
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,836
"...smiling, said he
was the Lone Ranger."

915
01:44:41,505 --> 01:44:44,175
"Coming into Los Angeles..."

916
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,095
"...bringing in a couple of keys."

917
01:44:50,055 --> 01:44:54,685
"Don't touch my bags, if you
please, Mr. Customs Man."

918
01:45:31,305 --> 01:45:35,976
"There's a hip woman walking
on a moving block..."

919
01:45:36,477 --> 01:45:39,313
"...tripping on the escalator."

920
01:45:39,897 --> 01:45:43,901
"There's a man in the line,
she's blowing his mind..."

921
01:45:44,735 --> 01:45:48,572
"...thinking that he's
already made her."

922
01:45:49,156 --> 01:45:51,409
"Coming into Los Angeles..."

923
01:45:53,494 --> 01:45:55,704
"...bringing in a couple of keys."

924
01:45:57,748 --> 01:46:02,420
"Don't touch my bags, if you
please, Mr. Customs Man."

925
01:46:06,006 --> 01:46:09,718
"Coming in from London from
over the Pole..."

926
01:46:10,344 --> 01:46:13,097
"...flying in a big air liner..."

927
01:46:13,431 --> 01:46:18,102
"...chickens flying
everywhere around the plane."

928
01:46:18,936 --> 01:46:22,606
"Could we ever feel much finer?"

929
01:46:23,441 --> 01:46:25,276
Folk music has come a
long way hasn't it, Arlo?

930
01:46:25,609 --> 01:46:27,528
It used to be the walk down
the road trip, you know.

931
01:46:28,112 --> 01:46:30,489
It's incredible. I heard the
New York Throughway is closed.

932
01:46:32,783 --> 01:46:34,201
This morning we heard
they were backed down...

933
01:46:34,285 --> 01:46:35,745
...on Route Seventeen
with an eight hour delay!

934
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,205
Right. Well, the New York
State Throughway is closed.

935
01:46:38,748 --> 01:46:39,415
It's incredible!

936
01:46:39,749 --> 01:46:40,583
Isn't that far out?

937
01:47:00,561 --> 01:47:02,730
I don't know if you,
I don't know how many...

938
01:47:02,813 --> 01:47:05,232
...of you can dig how many people
there are, man!

939
01:47:06,358 --> 01:47:10,029
Like I was rapping to the fuzz.
Huh, can you dig it?

940
01:47:10,488 --> 01:47:13,491
Man there are supposed to be a
million and a half people here by tonight!

941
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:15,242
Can you dig that?

942
01:47:15,576 --> 01:47:17,953
New York State Throughway
is closed, man!

943
01:47:20,998 --> 01:47:23,000
Yeah, it's far out, man!

944
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:28,005
Hey, man, I've just got to say...

945
01:47:29,632 --> 01:47:30,716
...that you people...

946
01:47:31,717 --> 01:47:34,970
...have got to be the strongest
bunch of people I ever saw.

947
01:47:35,846 --> 01:47:40,017
Three days, man, three days!
We just love you!

948
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:44,230
Tell them who we are.

949
01:47:44,522 --> 01:47:45,981
They'll know if you just sing.

950
01:47:46,482 --> 01:47:48,734
Test. Forty-nine. Sixty-five.
Hike!

951
01:47:55,533 --> 01:48:00,037
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
with us Crosby, Stills and Nash!

952
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,386
"It's getting to the point..."

953
01:48:16,053 --> 01:48:20,391
"...where I'm no fun any more."

954
01:48:21,851 --> 01:48:24,812
"I am sorry."

955
01:48:26,772 --> 01:48:28,774
"Sometimes it hurts..."

956
01:48:29,275 --> 01:48:33,404
"...so badly, I must cry out loud."

957
01:48:34,697 --> 01:48:37,032
"I, I, I am lonely."

958
01:48:37,867 --> 01:48:41,537
"I am yours, you are mine."

959
01:48:41,912 --> 01:48:44,081
"You are what you are."

960
01:48:44,915 --> 01:48:47,918
"You make it hard."

961
01:48:52,798 --> 01:48:56,594
"Remember what we said and did..."

962
01:48:57,303 --> 01:49:00,556
"...and felt about each other."

963
01:49:01,098 --> 01:49:03,809
"Oh, babe, have mercy."

964
01:49:06,228 --> 01:49:10,900
"Don't let the past remind
us of what we are, not now."

965
01:49:13,402 --> 01:49:16,864
"I, I, I am not dreaming."

966
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:20,826
"I am yours, you are mine."

967
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:24,121
"You are what you are."

968
01:49:24,455 --> 01:49:26,957
"You make it hard."

969
01:49:36,926 --> 01:49:41,597
"Tearing yourself away from me now."

970
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:47,353
"You are free, and I am crying."

971
01:49:50,356 --> 01:49:53,651
"This does not mean I don't love you."

972
01:49:53,984 --> 01:49:58,114
"I do. That's forever, baby."

973
01:49:58,447 --> 01:50:01,283
"Yes, and for always."

974
01:50:01,826 --> 01:50:04,995
"I am yours, you are mine."

975
01:50:05,454 --> 01:50:07,498
"You are what you are."

976
01:50:08,499 --> 01:50:10,668
"You make it hard."

977
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:17,883
"Something inside is telling
me that I've got your secret."

978
01:50:21,637 --> 01:50:24,807
"Are you still listening?"

979
01:50:26,142 --> 01:50:30,813
"Here is the lock and latch
of the key to your heart."

980
01:50:34,817 --> 01:50:37,278
"Yes, and I love you."

981
01:50:37,695 --> 01:50:41,323
"I am yours, you are mine."

982
01:50:41,824 --> 01:50:43,784
"You are what you are."

983
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:49,540
"You make it hard, hard..."

984
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:55,921
"...and you make it hard,
you make it hard."

985
01:51:06,182 --> 01:51:08,851
"Friday evening..."

986
01:51:12,521 --> 01:51:16,859
"...Sunday in the afternoon..."

987
01:51:20,029 --> 01:51:24,200
"...what have you got to lose?"

988
01:51:28,954 --> 01:51:31,582
"Tuesday morning..."

989
01:51:35,503 --> 01:51:40,174
"...please be gone. I'm tired of you."

990
01:51:43,052 --> 01:51:45,721
"What have you got to lose?"

991
01:51:50,518 --> 01:51:53,396
"Can I tell it like it is?"

992
01:51:54,772 --> 01:51:57,066
"Listen to me, baby..."

993
01:51:58,734 --> 01:52:00,694
"...it's my heart..."

994
01:52:01,362 --> 01:52:04,865
"...that's a sad feeling in your
heart, and that's what I am."

995
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:15,292
"I've got an answer."

996
01:52:18,087 --> 01:52:22,758
"I'm going to try and play."

997
01:52:25,594 --> 01:52:27,805
"What have I got to lose?"

998
01:52:34,645 --> 01:52:38,149
"Please come see me..."

999
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:44,321
"...Thursdays and Saturdays."

1000
01:52:48,409 --> 01:52:52,079
"What have you got to lose?"

1001
01:53:33,704 --> 01:53:36,665
"Chestnut brown canary..."

1002
01:53:36,999 --> 01:53:39,710
"...ruby-throated sparrow..."

1003
01:53:40,211 --> 01:53:44,882
"...sing a song, don't be long,
thrill me to the marrow."

1004
01:54:03,025 --> 01:54:05,903
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."

1005
01:54:06,237 --> 01:54:09,115
"Ring around the moonlight."

1006
01:54:09,532 --> 01:54:11,992
"Asking me, said she so free..."

1007
01:54:12,743 --> 01:54:15,621
"...'How can you catch the sparrow?"'

1008
01:54:31,929 --> 01:54:34,723
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."

1009
01:54:35,224 --> 01:54:38,060
"Oozing life, not lamenting."

1010
01:54:39,061 --> 01:54:43,733
"Change my life, make it right.
Be my lady."

1011
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:14,490
Thank you. We needed that!

1012
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,994
This is our second gig.
This is the second time...

1013
01:56:19,078 --> 01:56:21,330
...we've ever played
in front of people, man!

1014
01:56:21,664 --> 01:56:23,249
We're scared shitless!

1015
01:56:39,306 --> 01:56:43,477
That's near enough for jazz.
I'd like to say thank you again to you.

1016
01:56:49,483 --> 01:56:51,819
This is a thing called
"I'm Going Home by Helicopter."

1017
01:57:20,181 --> 01:57:23,476
"Going home, my baby."

1018
01:57:32,777 --> 01:57:35,529
"My baby, baby, I'm going home."

1019
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:39,700
"Baby, baby, I'm going home."

1020
01:57:41,285 --> 01:57:43,954
"Baby, baby, I said I'm going home."

1021
01:57:44,872 --> 01:57:47,792
"Going home, my baby."

1022
01:57:49,043 --> 01:57:51,545
"Go home, my baby."

1023
01:57:53,214 --> 01:57:56,300
"'Go home, baby, I'm going."

1024
01:58:09,563 --> 01:58:11,732
"My baby, see my baby around."

1025
01:58:13,275 --> 01:58:15,611
"See my baby, see my baby around."

1026
01:58:17,321 --> 01:58:19,573
"Love you, baby,
I feel so good tonight."

1027
01:58:20,991 --> 01:58:23,828
"Going home, see my baby."

1028
01:58:24,912 --> 01:58:27,748
"I'm going home now, see my baby."

1029
01:58:29,417 --> 01:58:31,752
"Oh, baby, baby, see my wife."

1030
01:58:41,929 --> 01:58:43,764
"Ohh! Baby, going to have more fun."

1031
01:58:44,807 --> 01:58:46,016
"Baby, you don't go..."

1032
01:58:46,434 --> 01:58:47,768
"...baby, if we don't go..."

1033
01:58:50,813 --> 01:58:51,856
"If you don't go..."

1034
01:58:53,149 --> 01:58:55,860
"...baby, we don't go.
Man, you hurt me so."

1035
01:58:56,527 --> 01:58:59,905
"I love my baby with the red dress on."

1036
01:59:04,618 --> 01:59:07,747
"I'm going to shake it on a great big
doll. I'm going to have more fun."

1037
01:59:17,631 --> 01:59:20,009
"Go back, baby, baby, I want
to be a half with you."

1038
01:59:21,135 --> 01:59:24,054
"I love you, baby, Lord knows I do."

1039
01:59:24,889 --> 01:59:27,975
"I love you, baby, God knows I do."

1040
01:59:28,976 --> 01:59:32,063
"We're going steady, doll,
that's what we're trying to do."

1041
01:59:41,989 --> 01:59:44,158
"Go on, baby, I love that way you walk."

1042
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:50,247
"One for the money, two for the show.
Three to get ready, and go, cat, go, go!"

1043
01:59:51,082 --> 01:59:52,333
"Don't you step on my blue suede shoes."

1044
01:59:53,876 --> 01:59:56,420
"You can do anything, baby, but
lay off my blue suede shoes!"

1045
01:59:57,671 --> 02:00:00,091
"Well, back it up, down in front."

1046
02:00:02,468 --> 02:00:04,553
"I've got a baby, mean as she can be."

1047
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:08,474
"Not now, my baby, don't be mean to me."

1048
02:00:09,517 --> 02:00:12,645
"Yeah, I'm coming on, baby.
Oh, not sitting, going home."

1049
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:16,690
"Climbing on, baby. Oh, I'm
not sitting, going home."

1050
02:00:17,942 --> 02:00:20,486
"Well, baby, I'm not sitting.
Going home."

1051
02:00:21,946 --> 02:00:25,699
"Well, shake up, baby, shake.
Well, shake it, baby, shake."

1052
02:00:26,283 --> 02:00:29,578
"Shake up, baby, shake.
Shake, baby, shake."

1053
02:00:31,122 --> 02:00:33,707
"Well, love you, baby.
I love the way you walk to me."

1054
02:00:42,633 --> 02:00:44,969
"Oh, baby, I love that way you walk."

1055
02:00:50,057 --> 02:00:53,310
"I'll sit you right down,
knock you off your feet."

1056
02:00:54,145 --> 02:00:57,565
"Whoa, baby, I've got a craving."

1057
02:01:11,162 --> 02:01:14,749
"I love you, baby, like God knows I do."

1058
02:01:19,503 --> 02:01:21,922
"Take your love, baby,
yeah, one more time."

1059
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:25,760
"Oh, do the stomp, do the stomp."

1060
02:01:55,623 --> 02:01:58,209
"I gave my baby, I gave one more time."

1061
02:01:58,542 --> 02:02:02,546
"Yeah, you quit, I'm
going to see my baby."

1062
02:02:03,547 --> 02:02:07,551
"I'm going home.
Home to see my ba-baby."

1063
02:02:08,219 --> 02:02:11,222
"Oh, baby, I played the blues for you."

1064
02:03:35,055 --> 02:03:38,726
"Yeah, I love you, baby,
with your red dress on."

1065
02:03:44,982 --> 02:03:46,150
"Baby, I love you so."

1066
02:03:59,747 --> 02:04:02,666
"I'm going home, I'm going home."

1067
02:04:20,684 --> 02:04:23,187
"Love you, baby.
Love that way you walk."

1068
02:04:24,105 --> 02:04:25,189
"I'm going home."

1069
02:05:01,559 --> 02:05:04,478
"Love you, baby. I'm going home."

1070
02:05:21,412 --> 02:05:24,832
"Look out, baby! I'm coming to get you!
One more time! Going home! "

1071
02:05:41,432 --> 02:05:45,853
"Yeah, home, baby.
Going home, home to my baby."

1072
02:06:44,578 --> 02:06:49,166
"Going home. I'm going home.
I'm going home."

1073
02:07:03,431 --> 02:07:05,850
"I'm going home, home, home, my baby."

1074
02:07:14,942 --> 02:07:17,945
"Going home to see my mama!"

1075
02:07:41,135 --> 02:07:42,887
Ten Years After!

1076
02:07:50,144 --> 02:07:52,980
Please a warm thank you
for Ten Years After!

1077
02:08:53,165 --> 02:08:55,418
Alright friends, now you have seen
the heavy groups...

1078
02:08:55,584 --> 02:08:57,837
...now you will see morning maniac music.

1079
02:08:58,087 --> 02:08:59,004
Believe me.

1080
02:09:00,172 --> 02:09:00,965
It's a new dawn.

1081
02:09:04,301 --> 02:09:05,803
The regular guys.

1082
02:14:36,467 --> 02:14:38,302
Don't you get a dial tone, or anything?

1083
02:14:39,845 --> 02:14:42,681
Yeah, there are some toilets around here,
some of those rolling outhouses...

1084
02:14:42,765 --> 02:14:44,308
...like they had in Newport.

1085
02:14:46,352 --> 02:14:47,686
You ask for somebody that doesn't exist...

1086
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:50,022
...and then they don't accept the charges
and they know you're okay.

1087
02:14:50,356 --> 02:14:51,857
You cheat the telephone company.

1088
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:55,694
Oh, yeah. I'm fine, man.

1089
02:14:56,695 --> 02:14:58,030
We don't take the car. We walk.

1090
02:15:00,783 --> 02:15:01,867
It's the only way to get there.

1091
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:07,665
Why? Because my mother wants
to make sure I'm all right.

1092
02:15:11,377 --> 02:15:13,003
I'm going to call my mother
and father because...

1093
02:15:14,505 --> 02:15:17,425
...oh, they think this is going to be
like another Chicago.

1094
02:15:17,508 --> 02:15:18,801
Like I'm going to get my head beaten in.

1095
02:15:19,176 --> 02:15:22,430
They're terrified. So I'm going to call
and tell them...

1096
02:15:22,513 --> 02:15:23,806
..."Ha-ha, I fooled you. I'm alive!"

1097
02:15:24,306 --> 02:15:26,809
They've got, they've, you don't even
have to bother bringing your tickets...

1098
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,978
...or anything, because they're not
going to collect them.

1099
02:15:30,521 --> 02:15:31,522
There's no way they can.

1100
02:15:32,898 --> 02:15:34,358
They've got a fence
that's half up...

1101
02:15:34,442 --> 02:15:35,901
...and there are people
just sitting in that field.

1102
02:15:35,943 --> 02:15:37,528
It's really beautiful.

1103
02:15:38,904 --> 02:15:42,032
I'll try. It's like I say, really,
you know how crowded it is here.

1104
02:15:43,325 --> 02:15:45,161
It, it's just swarming! What?

1105
02:15:46,912 --> 02:15:48,289
Out, out on the ground.

1106
02:15:50,374 --> 02:15:51,792
It was nice. We got wet.

1107
02:15:55,379 --> 02:15:56,922
All I miss is the bathtub.

1108
02:15:57,965 --> 02:15:59,508
Okay. Goodbye.

1109
02:16:00,092 --> 02:16:02,053
I didn't even finish
dialing and they said...

1110
02:16:05,389 --> 02:16:07,933
It's so great in some ways
and so lousy in others.

1111
02:16:08,350 --> 02:16:10,936
Look at the people you're meeting.
Everybody is here for one purpose.

1112
02:16:15,024 --> 02:16:16,025
It's ridiculous!

1113
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:19,320
It's getting worse every time.

1114
02:16:19,612 --> 02:16:23,074
There is no water. No water,
no food and no medical supplies.

1115
02:16:23,407 --> 02:16:24,283
Why don't we pray for rain?

1116
02:16:24,617 --> 02:16:27,328
They're telling everybody to go home.
They called it a disaster area.

1117
02:16:27,745 --> 02:16:29,580
Oh, that's rot!
They called this a disaster?

1118
02:16:29,622 --> 02:16:31,624
You should see,
everybody's happy!

1119
02:16:34,627 --> 02:16:35,461
Who are you calling?

1120
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:37,338
My mother.

1121
02:16:46,889 --> 02:16:49,100
Somebody may have noticed,
or all of you may have noticed...

1122
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:52,269
...a familiar colored
helicopter over there.

1123
02:16:53,437 --> 02:16:56,107
The United States Army has
lent us some medical teams...

1124
02:16:58,651 --> 02:16:59,985
...and giving us a hand.

1125
02:17:01,779 --> 02:17:03,823
They're with us, man.
They are not against us.

1126
02:17:03,906 --> 02:17:06,450
They're here to give us all
a hand and help us.

1127
02:17:07,827 --> 02:17:09,161
And for that they deserve it.

1128
02:17:16,168 --> 02:17:18,838
There are forty-five doctors
or more.

1129
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:20,297
I know at least forty-five...

1130
02:17:20,756 --> 02:17:25,428
...who are here without pay
because they dig what this is into.

1131
02:17:29,473 --> 02:17:32,852
Look, it's acid and shit like that.
One kid died, a heroin overdose.

1132
02:17:35,146 --> 02:17:38,315
Yeah, another guy died.
Run over, I believe.

1133
02:17:39,942 --> 02:17:41,527
The army is really doing
a great job, you know.

1134
02:17:42,611 --> 02:17:45,531
All those guys calling them pigs
and shit like that, it's not right.

1135
02:17:45,614 --> 02:17:47,032
They've done a good job.

1136
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:52,955
Dr. Jack Maitland, please,
with full suturing equipment...

1137
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:54,999
...your presence is requested.

1138
02:17:56,959 --> 02:17:58,502
You've got a delivery to make!

1139
02:18:03,048 --> 02:18:06,385
Marilyn Cohen. Wherever
you are, Marilyn Cohen...

1140
02:18:07,053 --> 02:18:08,929
...Greg wants you to meet him
at the information booth...

1141
02:18:09,055 --> 02:18:10,890
...because he wants to marry you!

1142
02:18:13,559 --> 02:18:14,894
There goes Marilyn!

1143
02:18:16,562 --> 02:18:18,981
About how long does it take to...?

1144
02:18:20,149 --> 02:18:21,984
Well, before it was
backed up, eight hours.

1145
02:18:22,359 --> 02:18:24,904
And they've been working at it
and there are still some cats...

1146
02:18:24,987 --> 02:18:26,989
...that think they can come here
for Sunday.

1147
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:30,910
And they're stopping them in Monticello
and all that, you know...

1148
02:18:30,993 --> 02:18:32,703
...so it's really getting to be a mess.

1149
02:18:33,496 --> 02:18:36,373
So, you know what I would do?
I would wait, because this way...

1150
02:18:36,916 --> 02:18:39,085
There's no gas in the gas stations.

1151
02:18:39,710 --> 02:18:42,546
Because this is the third
largest city in the world.

1152
02:18:43,881 --> 02:18:45,549
So I would wait, you know?

1153
02:18:47,343 --> 02:18:48,094
Until when?

1154
02:18:48,344 --> 02:18:50,388
Until this traffic starts clearing up.

1155
02:18:51,097 --> 02:18:52,473
You know, like Monday morning.

1156
02:18:53,516 --> 02:18:55,726
I've got to be in North
Carolina Monday morning.

1157
02:18:56,602 --> 02:18:58,896
Oh, wow! Do you? Why? A job?

1158
02:19:00,481 --> 02:19:03,192
Well, like what? This has been declared
a disaster area.

1159
02:19:03,275 --> 02:19:05,111
Because I called
long distance to Buffalo...

1160
02:19:05,444 --> 02:19:07,655
...and asked some cats there
and they said...

1161
02:19:07,738 --> 02:19:10,116
...it definitely has been declared
a disaster area.

1162
02:19:11,283 --> 02:19:12,576
Is there any way to get out?

1163
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:14,495
They're trying to evacuate it today.

1164
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:19,291
So maybe late tonight, you know.
You know, like one.

1165
02:19:19,625 --> 02:19:20,709
How are they going to evacuate?

1166
02:19:21,293 --> 02:19:23,963
We're not sure. I think they're trying
to get all the cats in the cars...

1167
02:19:24,046 --> 02:19:25,089
...and just direct the cars to get out.

1168
02:19:25,464 --> 02:19:26,799
I mean, you can try it.

1169
02:19:28,300 --> 02:19:30,052
I mean, like it's all up to you, man.

1170
02:19:31,137 --> 02:19:32,805
But if your car gets, you know...

1171
02:19:33,597 --> 02:19:34,974
Yeah, if you run out of gas somewhere,
there's no gas in the stations.

1172
02:19:35,224 --> 02:19:35,850
You're screwed.

1173
02:19:36,976 --> 02:19:38,936
Yeah, I mean, like you'd be even more
stuck on the highway...

1174
02:19:38,978 --> 02:19:40,271
...than you are here, because...

1175
02:19:40,604 --> 02:19:41,981
...at least here there
are a lot of other cats.

1176
02:19:43,566 --> 02:19:47,111
I have to get out of here because
there are just too many people!

1177
02:19:47,486 --> 02:19:50,906
And I can't leave because
my friends will be lost.

1178
02:19:51,282 --> 02:19:55,953
And I can't, I can't stay here
any more. It's too crowded!

1179
02:20:02,334 --> 02:20:04,295
We are only taking drastic emergencies.

1180
02:20:04,837 --> 02:20:06,297
Nobody worries. Nobody up here
has any money.

1181
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:08,299
You could live and eat here a week
without money, so don't worry about it.

1182
02:20:08,632 --> 02:20:10,509
I know, but I've got to
go back to California.

1183
02:20:10,843 --> 02:20:11,969
You can get a ride to California, too.

1184
02:20:12,344 --> 02:20:15,014
You know, everybody here, it's the
same thing with them, you know.

1185
02:20:15,097 --> 02:20:16,766
You just have to dig it and live with it.

1186
02:20:22,021 --> 02:20:23,689
About thirty hours, at least.

1187
02:20:24,356 --> 02:20:26,650
Thirty hours straight? No naps?

1188
02:20:28,986 --> 02:20:29,987
Are you on speed?

1189
02:20:30,321 --> 02:20:32,990
No, I'm not on anything.

1190
02:20:33,866 --> 02:20:34,784
Blind faith?

1191
02:20:36,202 --> 02:20:37,661
Blind Faith is a groovy group.

1192
02:20:39,872 --> 02:20:42,041
You wouldn't believe some of
the kids that come in here.

1193
02:20:43,459 --> 02:20:48,089
They're really spaced out. Last night,
this cat, this cat comes in and says...

1194
02:20:49,882 --> 02:20:54,136
..."If anger is red and envy is
green, what color is jealousy?"

1195
02:20:55,679 --> 02:20:56,764
And I mean he's really spaced out!

1196
02:20:56,847 --> 02:20:58,891
And you just don't go fucking people's
heads up when they're spaced out!

1197
02:20:59,558 --> 02:21:02,520
So I said, uh, "Black, right?
Because jealousy is poison."

1198
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:07,066
He says, "Yeah, but it's got to be
something else than that."

1199
02:21:07,108 --> 02:21:09,402
And I said, "Green, because after all,
jealousy is like envy."

1200
02:21:10,236 --> 02:21:13,114
"Except that envy is over things
and jealousy is over people."

1201
02:21:13,489 --> 02:21:15,825
"A lot of people treat other people as,
you know, things."

1202
02:21:15,908 --> 02:21:17,368
And he says, "Wow! Groovy!"

1203
02:21:17,701 --> 02:21:19,620
And he walks off
and I never saw that cat!

1204
02:21:19,703 --> 02:21:22,373
Another cat comes up and he asks me
to tell him about his wild eyes!

1205
02:21:26,419 --> 02:21:27,420
Did he have wild eyes?

1206
02:21:28,254 --> 02:21:30,881
He was speeding. Really groovy.

1207
02:21:31,757 --> 02:21:34,093
And all the people that come up here
asking, you know...

1208
02:21:34,093 --> 02:21:36,429
...if we can page
their freaked out friends.

1209
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:39,265
I mean, like right now
I'm missing my sister.

1210
02:21:41,058 --> 02:21:43,728
I lost her. She was on, uh, on mesc.

1211
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:48,524
And I lost her during
Richie Haven's performance.

1212
02:21:51,444 --> 02:21:54,905
I've got her tickets home.
I haven't seen her since.

1213
02:21:56,073 --> 02:21:56,782
She's all right.

1214
02:21:57,366 --> 02:21:58,033
Sure she is.

1215
02:21:58,951 --> 02:22:01,620
It's just that I'd like to see her
so I can get home in time.

1216
02:22:01,704 --> 02:22:03,289
She's got to be back Monday for Court.

1217
02:22:04,749 --> 02:22:06,292
Otherwise, you know, I wouldn't care.

1218
02:22:07,918 --> 02:22:09,420
Otherwise, I'd probably
let her hitch home.

1219
02:26:50,568 --> 02:26:51,819
City McGee...

1220
02:26:53,237 --> 02:26:55,197
...please come immediately
to backstage right.

1221
02:26:55,281 --> 02:26:57,867
I understand your wife is having a baby.
Congratulations!

1222
02:27:05,041 --> 02:27:06,375
John Sebastian!

1223
02:27:24,018 --> 02:27:27,021
This is really a mind
fucker of all times, man!

1224
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:30,066
I've never seen anything like this, man!

1225
02:27:33,903 --> 02:27:36,906
It's Newport, right? But they owned it.

1226
02:27:38,282 --> 02:27:39,408
It was something else!

1227
02:27:41,911 --> 02:27:45,164
Just love everybody around you,
and clean up a little garbage...

1228
02:27:45,289 --> 02:27:46,624
...on your way out and everything
is going to be all right.

1229
02:27:52,797 --> 02:27:57,093
And Chip. My man, Chip.
Aw, you're doing so well, man.

1230
02:27:57,802 --> 02:28:01,764
He says to look out for the fence, too,
man. You have to look after the fence.

1231
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:07,270
Like the, the press can only, can only say
bad things unless there ain't no fuck-ups.

1232
02:28:09,146 --> 02:28:11,732
And it's looking like there
ain't going to be any fuck-ups.

1233
02:28:12,191 --> 02:28:13,526
This is going to work!

1234
02:28:16,904 --> 02:28:19,282
I'd like to hear a tune about...

1235
02:28:20,491 --> 02:28:23,661
...I guess about those discussions
I was talking about that...

1236
02:28:24,203 --> 02:28:28,207
...small circles of friends
around living rooms...

1237
02:28:28,916 --> 02:28:32,628
...around pipes, when they weren't
selling any papers on the street...

1238
02:28:33,337 --> 02:28:37,133
...and we weren't walking around this
beautiful green place smoking, and...

1239
02:28:39,176 --> 02:28:40,469
...not being afraid.

1240
02:28:41,846 --> 02:28:44,181
There's a cat, and I really don't even
know his name...

1241
02:28:44,265 --> 02:28:46,309
...but I remember
that Chip said that...

1242
02:28:49,270 --> 02:28:52,273
...his old lady just had a baby and that
made me think.

1243
02:28:52,356 --> 02:28:53,941
Wow, it really is a city here!

1244
02:28:58,362 --> 02:29:01,574
But this is, this is for you
and your old lady, man! Whew!

1245
02:29:03,868 --> 02:29:05,453
That kid is going to be far out!

1246
02:29:18,132 --> 02:29:22,803
"Why must every generation
think their folks are square?"

1247
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:29,602
"And no matter where their heads are,
they know Moms ain't there."

1248
02:29:30,895 --> 02:29:35,608
"Because I swore when I was small,
that I'd remember when..."

1249
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:42,031
"...I knew what's wrong with them,
that I was smaller, then."

1250
02:29:46,577 --> 02:29:51,207
"I determined to remember
all the cardinal rules..."

1251
02:29:52,583 --> 02:29:57,213
"...like sun-showers are legal
grounds for skipping school."

1252
02:29:58,756 --> 02:30:03,094
"I know I have forgotten
maybe one or two..."

1253
02:30:04,887 --> 02:30:09,559
"...but I hope that I recall them
all before the baby is due."

1254
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:14,814
"And I know he'll have
a question or two..."

1255
02:30:17,108 --> 02:30:21,821
"...like, 'Hey, Pop, can
I go ride my zoom..."

1256
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:26,117
"...that goes two hundred
miles an hour..."

1257
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:28,327
"...suspended on balloons?"'

1258
02:30:29,287 --> 02:30:33,916
"'And I can put a droplet of
this new stuff on my tongue..."

1259
02:30:35,126 --> 02:30:39,839
"...and imagine frothing dragons
while you sit and wreck your lungs?"'

1260
02:30:41,632 --> 02:30:43,926
"And I must be permissive..."

1261
02:30:44,635 --> 02:30:48,598
"...understanding the
younger generation..."

1262
02:30:54,353 --> 02:30:57,148
"...and then I'll know
that all I've learned..."

1263
02:31:02,153 --> 02:31:06,490
"...and then I'll know that
all I've learned, my kid..."

1264
02:31:10,828 --> 02:31:15,458
"...then I'll know that all I've
learned, my kid assumes..."

1265
02:31:16,667 --> 02:31:21,005
"...and all my deepest worries
must be his cartoons..."

1266
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:27,303
"...and still I'll try to tell
him all the things I've done..."

1267
02:31:28,971 --> 02:31:33,643
"...relating to what he can
do when he becomes a man..."

1268
02:31:35,311 --> 02:31:39,023
"...and still he'll stick
his fingers in the fan..."

1269
02:31:41,317 --> 02:31:45,988
"...and, 'Hey, Pop, my girl
friend is only three..."

1270
02:31:47,031 --> 02:31:51,744
"...she's got her own bitty
phone and she's taking LSD..."

1271
02:31:53,454 --> 02:31:58,125
"...and now that we're best friends,
she wants to give a taste to me."'

1272
02:31:59,627 --> 02:32:04,298
"'But what's the matter, Daddy?
How come you look so mean?"'

1273
02:32:05,550 --> 02:32:09,387
"'Could it be that you can't
live up to your dreams?"'

1274
02:32:10,763 --> 02:32:14,725
No, it's not true, because we're
doing it! I love you. Goodbye.

1275
02:32:20,731 --> 02:32:24,026
Ladies and gentlemen, John Sebastian!

1276
02:32:39,959 --> 02:32:40,793
Give me an "F"!

1277
02:32:42,253 --> 02:32:43,087
Give me a "U"!

1278
02:32:44,422 --> 02:32:45,256
Give me a "C"!

1279
02:32:46,465 --> 02:32:47,425
Give me a "K"!

1280
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:49,468
What does that spell?

1281
02:32:49,802 --> 02:32:50,469
Fuck!

1282
02:34:17,473 --> 02:34:18,140
Sing it!

1283
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:42,225
More! More!

1284
02:35:43,226 --> 02:35:44,143
Country Joe!

1285
02:36:04,038 --> 02:36:05,540
Sir? You live here?

1286
02:36:05,873 --> 02:36:07,208
I sure as hell do!

1287
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:08,751
Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

1288
02:36:09,126 --> 02:36:11,087
I'm right here to answer them.

1289
02:36:11,379 --> 02:36:14,298
Have you been affected by this
festival at all? In any way?

1290
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:16,801
What? We lost all of our milk.

1291
02:36:18,469 --> 02:36:23,182
We're just trying to put together a film,
to show what the whole picture was like.

1292
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:25,393
You know, from all sides.

1293
02:36:25,851 --> 02:36:26,519
How do you feel about it?

1294
02:36:26,852 --> 02:36:28,479
Do you want me to
explain in plain English?

1295
02:36:28,854 --> 02:36:29,814
A shitty mess!

1296
02:36:30,523 --> 02:36:31,774
Tell me, in what way?

1297
02:36:32,858 --> 02:36:33,693
No bathrooms.

1298
02:36:34,068 --> 02:36:36,279
Our hundred fifty acres.
Gone, that's all.

1299
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:39,991
And we didn't rent to them.
They all trespassed, every one!

1300
02:36:41,325 --> 02:36:43,327
Clarence, first tell me
where you want this to go.

1301
02:36:44,537 --> 02:36:45,746
Can I ask you a question?

1302
02:36:46,831 --> 02:36:48,291
Is it okay if we use your telephone?

1303
02:36:48,541 --> 02:36:49,584
Oh, we have none. It's out.

1304
02:36:49,917 --> 02:36:52,295
This is a disaster area.
We don't even have a phone.

1305
02:36:52,336 --> 02:36:53,713
It's been out since yesterday morning.

1306
02:36:54,088 --> 02:36:54,714
Water?

1307
02:36:55,089 --> 02:36:56,090
Water I can give you.

1308
02:36:57,008 --> 02:36:59,635
And I'm sorry the phone has been
out, I had an emergency call.

1309
02:37:00,011 --> 02:37:02,096
It's a disgraceful mess, if
you want to know the answer!

1310
02:37:02,388 --> 02:37:04,098
What, specifically, has happened to you?

1311
02:37:04,515 --> 02:37:08,394
My fields are all cut up.
Our second cutting of hay is going.

1312
02:37:09,645 --> 02:37:12,565
Our cows, the milk truck didn't get here.
The milk had to be thrown out.

1313
02:37:13,858 --> 02:37:15,985
May I ask you how much money
you made on this, uh, four days?

1314
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:18,321
I have no, no conception.

1315
02:37:18,863 --> 02:37:20,197
Did you make five thousand dollars?

1316
02:37:20,489 --> 02:37:21,866
have no idea.

1317
02:37:22,199 --> 02:37:23,284
It's too private a question?

1318
02:37:23,576 --> 02:37:26,037
It's, it's not only too private,
I didn't even have a chance...

1319
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:28,289
...to total up the amount
of purchases we made...

1320
02:37:29,373 --> 02:37:30,499
...the amount of money we took in.

1321
02:37:30,917 --> 02:37:35,588
We just, uh, haphazardly
sent it to our home...

1322
02:37:36,214 --> 02:37:39,508
...and had it locked up until we had
a chance to sit down and count it...

1323
02:37:39,884 --> 02:37:42,303
...which would probably be in
about, uh, two to three days.

1324
02:37:42,970 --> 02:37:43,930
Would you like to see it again next...?

1325
02:37:44,305 --> 02:37:45,306
I'd love to see it again!

1326
02:37:47,183 --> 02:37:47,934
You'd love to see it, though?

1327
02:37:48,309 --> 02:37:49,602
I can't say the farmers would.

1328
02:37:50,937 --> 02:37:52,772
Well, it, it's, it's
a matter of opinion.

1329
02:37:53,147 --> 02:37:54,148
What are your feelings
about the garbage?

1330
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:59,153
Where there are people, there is garbage.
You, you can't stop, stop progress.

1331
02:38:00,154 --> 02:38:03,324
Saturday night we got word
over WVOS that...

1332
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:05,952
...a lot of kids in town
didn't have anything to eat.

1333
02:38:06,786 --> 02:38:08,871
Word went out that everybody should
contribute food.

1334
02:38:08,913 --> 02:38:10,331
We went over to the park...

1335
02:38:11,707 --> 02:38:13,459
...the village permitted
them to camp there.

1336
02:38:15,419 --> 02:38:18,089
A police car went up the street here
with a loud speaker...

1337
02:38:18,172 --> 02:38:20,091
...and told the kids to come up there.

1338
02:38:20,466 --> 02:38:23,052
And we fed them Saturday
night and all day Sunday.

1339
02:38:24,095 --> 02:38:28,474
Excess stuff was taken over to the school
and they flew it to the, to the site.

1340
02:38:29,183 --> 02:38:30,393
How do you feel about them now?

1341
02:38:30,726 --> 02:38:33,396
Very good. I have a
nineteen-year-old myself.

1342
02:38:33,729 --> 02:38:38,401
He's out on the Coast, and I felt that
we've got to give them a fair shake here.

1343
02:38:39,193 --> 02:38:40,820
If kids are hungry, you've got
to feed them. I don't know...

1344
02:38:41,237 --> 02:38:43,864
...maybe we ought to put, we
ought to put everybody on pot.

1345
02:38:44,615 --> 02:38:47,034
And those kids were all happy.
They were all on pot.

1346
02:38:47,451 --> 02:38:48,160
Well, whatever it is...

1347
02:38:48,452 --> 02:38:49,370
It never should have happened.

1348
02:38:49,662 --> 02:38:50,997
If pot makes them happy and no trouble...

1349
02:38:51,122 --> 02:38:52,999
...maybe we ought to put all
the adults on pot!

1350
02:38:53,374 --> 02:38:55,668
You want a fifteen-year-old girl
sleeping in the field in a tent?

1351
02:38:55,751 --> 02:38:57,003
What are you, out of your mind?

1352
02:38:57,461 --> 02:38:58,379
It never should have happened!

1353
02:38:59,005 --> 02:39:01,465
Do you feel bad about the kids
who were killed in Vietnam?

1354
02:39:01,799 --> 02:39:02,675
This has nothing to do with...

1355
02:39:03,009 --> 02:39:04,510
It's the same thing. The same thing.

1356
02:39:04,844 --> 02:39:05,511
There's no comparison.

1357
02:39:05,845 --> 02:39:09,849
People get more excited about the kids
in Monticello than they do about...

1358
02:39:11,434 --> 02:39:13,227
Fifteen-year-old kids
sleeping in the field?

1359
02:39:13,769 --> 02:39:14,520
They wanted to.

1360
02:39:14,854 --> 02:39:16,230
They're all high on pot!

1361
02:39:18,065 --> 02:39:22,069
Look, maybe if pot made them peaceful,
maybe we all should take pot!

1362
02:39:27,241 --> 02:39:30,077
I was giving them water all along the
road here, right up on the bridge...

1363
02:39:30,161 --> 02:39:31,871
...and they were not on pot!

1364
02:39:32,830 --> 02:39:34,457
Very lovely children, believe me.

1365
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:37,251
They were selling stuff.
There was plenty of stuff there.

1366
02:39:37,335 --> 02:39:38,377
There's no doubt about it.

1367
02:39:38,836 --> 02:39:40,546
They had hundreds of kids in that house.

1368
02:39:43,174 --> 02:39:45,801
If you have four hundred
and fifty thousand kids...

1369
02:39:45,843 --> 02:39:47,470
...and you've got two or three hundred...

1370
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:52,475
...they were selling these,
these blue acid tablets...

1371
02:39:52,642 --> 02:39:53,809
...which are bad,
and they were selling them.

1372
02:39:55,186 --> 02:39:56,520
True, but figure the law of averages.

1373
02:39:56,812 --> 02:39:59,815
If you took 500 adults and brought
them together and had plenty of booze...

1374
02:39:59,857 --> 02:40:01,484
...you know what
would have happened?

1375
02:40:02,401 --> 02:40:03,361
You didn't see any drunks.

1376
02:40:03,653 --> 02:40:07,073
That's right. There was no fighting.
There was nobody stealing.

1377
02:40:08,574 --> 02:40:10,535
We had to feed them! What the hell
else was there to do?

1378
02:40:10,576 --> 02:40:11,327
There was nothing else to do!

1379
02:40:17,458 --> 02:40:18,334
Having a good time?

1380
02:40:18,918 --> 02:40:19,585
Very nice.

1381
02:40:20,545 --> 02:40:21,337
The water is nice.

1382
02:40:22,713 --> 02:40:25,049
We were all sitting on a tree
stump over there.

1383
02:40:25,132 --> 02:40:27,176
And the more people got on it,
the lower it got.

1384
02:40:29,053 --> 02:40:31,556
About a year ago, I wouldn't have
believed this was the way to swim...

1385
02:40:31,597 --> 02:40:33,349
...but this is the way to swim!

1386
02:40:34,225 --> 02:40:35,768
It's the way to go all
the time, actually.

1387
02:40:36,978 --> 02:40:37,937
Think that's going to happen?

1388
02:40:38,271 --> 02:40:39,272
It's got to happen!

1389
02:40:40,356 --> 02:40:42,525
You go walking down the street
where all the cars were coming in...

1390
02:40:42,608 --> 02:40:44,986
...and it's just the first day,
and it was just beautiful!

1391
02:40:46,153 --> 02:40:47,822
Everybody is free.
Everybody is talking.

1392
02:40:49,574 --> 02:40:50,908
Everybody is really nude.

1393
02:40:53,953 --> 02:40:56,497
I don't think, uh, people
come here to get uptight.

1394
02:40:57,665 --> 02:40:59,000
They come here to dig what's going on.

1395
02:40:59,917 --> 02:41:01,919
And even if they don't get
into a festival, it's just a groove...

1396
02:41:02,003 --> 02:41:03,129
...being with all the people.

1397
02:41:03,629 --> 02:41:06,883
You know, you realize all over the
country, they're coming together.

1398
02:41:07,925 --> 02:41:10,261
You realize that you're not
the only people in your city...

1399
02:41:10,303 --> 02:41:12,597
...who are doing the things you are,
but they're everywhere.

1400
02:41:13,639 --> 02:41:14,849
We're taking over!

1401
02:41:17,602 --> 02:41:19,312
I think the body is beautiful.

1402
02:41:22,899 --> 02:41:27,570
I think skinny dipping is just beautiful
if, if you want to do it, if you can do it.

1403
02:41:28,404 --> 02:41:30,656
Some people can't, because all their...

1404
02:41:30,990 --> 02:41:34,744
...their environment made them,
you know, feel that it's wrong.

1405
02:41:35,119 --> 02:41:37,747
Even though they know in their
subconscious that it's right...

1406
02:41:38,789 --> 02:41:43,502
...it's kind of normal and natural, but
we've been made to feel that it's wrong.

1407
02:41:45,171 --> 02:41:47,381
Row, row, row!

1408
02:41:53,930 --> 02:41:57,350
"Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the stream..."

1409
02:41:57,934 --> 02:42:01,312
"...merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, life is but a dream."

1410
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:27,880
No, I haven't done
this too often before.

1411
02:42:30,466 --> 02:42:32,051
Get it pointed in the right direction!

1412
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:34,804
Well, did I miss any big spots?

1413
02:42:35,721 --> 02:42:36,472
Your cheekbone.

1414
02:42:36,806 --> 02:42:37,473
Here?

1415
02:42:39,058 --> 02:42:40,643
Why don't you tell me
something really interesting?

1416
02:42:42,478 --> 02:42:44,772
I can't, really, standing
there with the microphone.

1417
02:42:45,064 --> 02:42:48,734
Don't worry about it. Don't let it
intimidate you. It's just a microphone.

1418
02:42:49,068 --> 02:42:50,903
I know, but it's very intimidating.

1419
02:42:54,574 --> 02:42:57,076
Just tell me anything, like
anybody you'd like to meet.

1420
02:42:59,745 --> 02:43:01,330
Oh, wow! I don't know.

1421
02:43:02,290 --> 02:43:03,082
What did you think about the kids?

1422
02:43:03,457 --> 02:43:06,377
From what I've heard from outside
sources for many years...

1423
02:43:07,086 --> 02:43:10,172
...I was very, very much surprised.
And I'm very happy to say...

1424
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:13,593
...we think the people of this
country should be proud of these kids.

1425
02:43:13,885 --> 02:43:16,888
Notwithstanding the way they dress
or the way they wear their hair.

1426
02:43:16,971 --> 02:43:18,598
That's their own personal business.

1427
02:43:18,890 --> 02:43:21,893
But their, their inner workings,
their inner selves...

1428
02:43:22,894 --> 02:43:25,897
...their, their self-demeanor
cannot be questioned.

1429
02:43:26,314 --> 02:43:28,774
They can't be questioned
as good American citizens.

1430
02:43:29,233 --> 02:43:30,943
That's kind of surprising
coming from a cop.

1431
02:43:31,986 --> 02:43:33,613
I'm not a cop. I'm a Chief of Police.

1432
02:43:42,788 --> 02:43:46,125
We've got one more tune for you.
It's called "Soul Sacrifice."

1433
02:52:44,997 --> 02:52:47,583
Ladies and gentlemen, Santana!

1434
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:47,435
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."

1435
02:53:49,270 --> 02:53:51,355
"...take you higher."

1436
02:53:52,607 --> 02:53:55,443
"Baby, baby, baby, light my fire!"

1437
02:53:57,528 --> 02:53:59,363
"I'll take you higher."

1438
02:54:23,596 --> 02:54:28,267
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."

1439
02:54:30,269 --> 02:54:31,771
"...take you higher..."

1440
02:54:38,319 --> 02:54:39,862
"...take you higher..."

1441
02:55:08,516 --> 02:55:10,017
"...take you higher!"

1442
02:55:49,557 --> 02:55:54,228
"I wanta, I wanta take you higher!"

1443
02:56:22,256 --> 02:56:26,928
"I wanta, I wanta,
wanta take you higher!"

1444
02:58:25,504 --> 02:58:29,884
What we would like to do
is sing a song together.

1445
02:58:30,676 --> 02:58:31,886
Now, you see, what usually happens...

1446
02:58:33,846 --> 02:58:35,848
...you get a group of people
that might sing...

1447
02:58:37,975 --> 02:58:42,313
...and for some reasons that are not
unknown anymore, they won't do it.

1448
02:58:43,105 --> 02:58:44,565
Most of us need approval.

1449
02:58:45,566 --> 02:58:48,903
Most of us need to get approval
from our neighbors...

1450
02:58:49,737 --> 02:58:52,657
...before we can actually let it
all hang down, you dig?

1451
02:58:54,784 --> 02:58:55,910
But what is happening here...

1452
02:58:57,536 --> 02:58:59,747
...is a sing-along. Now, a lot of
people don't like to do it...

1453
02:58:59,830 --> 02:59:02,208
...because they feel
it might be old-fashioned.

1454
02:59:03,668 --> 02:59:06,295
But you must dig that it is not
a fashion in the first place.

1455
02:59:07,129 --> 02:59:08,089
It is a feeling...

1456
02:59:09,965 --> 02:59:12,176
...and if it was good in the past,
it's still good.

1457
02:59:13,302 --> 02:59:15,304
We would like to sing a song
called "Higher"...

1458
02:59:15,388 --> 02:59:18,015
...and if we could get everybody
to join in, we'd appreciate it.

1459
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:30,569
"Wanta take you higher!"

1460
02:59:30,945 --> 02:59:32,029
"Higher!"

1461
02:59:32,571 --> 02:59:36,575
What I want you to do, is say "higher"
and throw the peace sign up.

1462
02:59:36,909 --> 02:59:37,952
It will do you no harm.

1463
02:59:40,913 --> 02:59:43,457
Still again, some people
feel that they shouldn't...

1464
02:59:45,334 --> 02:59:47,294
...because there are situations
where you need approval...

1465
02:59:48,379 --> 02:59:50,631
...to get in on something
that could be so good.

1466
02:59:57,346 --> 02:59:59,056
"I wanta take you higher!"

1467
02:59:59,348 --> 03:00:00,266
"Higher!"

1468
03:00:00,558 --> 03:00:04,145
Now, if you'll throw the peace sign up
and say "higher", get everybody to do it.

1469
03:00:04,979 --> 03:00:07,231
There's a whole lot of people here
and a whole lot of people...

1470
03:00:07,314 --> 03:00:08,315
...might not want to do it...

1471
03:00:08,774 --> 03:00:11,319
...because they can somehow
get around it...

1472
03:00:11,694 --> 03:00:14,155
...they feel there are enough people
to make up for it...

1473
03:00:14,905 --> 03:00:16,365
...and on and on, et cetera.

1474
03:00:20,661 --> 03:00:23,331
We're going to try higher again,
and if we get everybody to join in...

1475
03:00:23,414 --> 03:00:24,790
...we'd appreciate it.
It will do you no harm.

1476
03:00:25,791 --> 03:00:27,293
"Yeah, I wanta take you higher!"

1477
03:00:27,626 --> 03:00:28,419
"Higher!"

1478
03:00:29,378 --> 03:00:31,672
"Way upon a hill, I'll take you higher!"

1479
03:00:32,798 --> 03:00:34,508
"Yeah, I'll take you higher!"

1480
03:02:18,821 --> 03:02:20,072
"Going to take you higher!"

1481
03:02:20,406 --> 03:02:21,240
"Higher!"

1482
03:03:47,159 --> 03:03:48,994
How are you out there?

1483
03:03:55,334 --> 03:03:57,878
You're staying stoned and
you've got enough water...

1484
03:03:58,045 --> 03:04:00,130
...and you've got a place to sleep,
and everything?

1485
03:10:37,102 --> 03:10:38,186
Good morning.

1486
03:10:39,897 --> 03:10:44,401
What we have in mind is breakfast
in bed for four hundred thousand.

1487
03:10:48,405 --> 03:10:51,533
Now, it's not going to be
steak and eggs, or anything...

1488
03:10:52,910 --> 03:10:55,537
...but it's going to be good food
and we're going to get it to you.

1489
03:10:56,371 --> 03:10:58,373
It's not just the Hog Farm, either.

1490
03:10:58,916 --> 03:11:01,251
It's like the Ohio Mountain family
and the Pranksters...

1491
03:11:01,293 --> 03:11:03,545
...and everybody else that volunteered...

1492
03:11:04,254 --> 03:11:06,757
...putting in their time into the free
kitchens. In fact, it's everybody.

1493
03:11:07,925 --> 03:11:10,052
We're all feeding each other.

1494
03:11:12,596 --> 03:11:14,556
We must be in heaven, man!

1495
03:11:18,143 --> 03:11:21,688
There's always a little bit
of heaven in a disaster area.

1496
03:11:23,982 --> 03:11:26,026
So, if you want to make it
back to your campsites,

1497
03:11:26,068 --> 03:11:28,612
we'll try and get the food to you.

1498
03:11:29,279 --> 03:11:32,074
Or if you stay here, we'll
try and get the food to you.

1499
03:11:32,449 --> 03:11:36,245
Now, there's a guy up there,
some hamburger guy...

1500
03:11:36,787 --> 03:11:39,414
...had his stand
burned down last night.

1501
03:11:40,874 --> 03:11:42,709
But he's still got a
little stuff left...

1502
03:11:43,293 --> 03:11:47,089
...and for you people that still believe
that capitalism isn't that weird...

1503
03:11:47,464 --> 03:11:49,925
...you might help him out and
buy a couple of hamburgers.

1504
03:11:56,932 --> 03:11:58,642
Okay, here it comes! Mess call!

1505
03:12:18,328 --> 03:12:19,288
Good morning.

1506
03:12:24,418 --> 03:12:27,462
Left side of the audience,
stage right here...

1507
03:12:28,672 --> 03:12:31,466
...that wants to be fed...

1508
03:12:32,593 --> 03:12:36,013
...has got to slowly move
it through the forest...

1509
03:12:36,930 --> 03:12:41,518
...to the Hog Farm where we've got about
seventeen lines going, uh, to serve with.

1510
03:12:45,022 --> 03:12:48,984
If you start your lines going through
the forest, you'll wind up...

1511
03:12:49,651 --> 03:12:51,653
...going into a line
that will take you

1512
03:12:51,695 --> 03:12:53,655
right to where all
the food is being served.

1513
03:12:54,197 --> 03:12:56,158
Helen Hayman, to the front.
Jim MacLean,

1514
03:12:56,199 --> 03:12:58,827
please go to the pink and white tent
hospital as soon as possible.

1515
03:13:00,245 --> 03:13:02,247
And kissing builds up your mouth.

1516
03:13:04,458 --> 03:13:07,794
Richard Moss and Barbara, meet
us at the information booth.

1517
03:13:09,546 --> 03:13:12,591
Cort Ritcher or Greg Hollander, go to
the Ferris wheel at twelve o'clock.

1518
03:13:12,883 --> 03:13:14,259
Greg's sister has his medicine.

1519
03:13:16,219 --> 03:13:20,891
Okay, Gayle, wow!
S, i, r, i, n, c, i, o, n, e...

1520
03:13:22,392 --> 03:13:26,813
...meet your daddy-o at the first aid
station, near the security office.

1521
03:13:31,735 --> 03:13:33,820
If you've got food, feed other people.

1522
03:13:35,113 --> 03:13:37,449
Bugsy, to the pink and white tent.

1523
03:13:37,824 --> 03:13:39,201
Keep feeding each other.

1524
03:13:41,203 --> 03:13:44,498
And if you're too tired
to chew, pass it on.

1525
03:16:56,656 --> 03:16:57,949
We have a gentleman with us.

1526
03:16:59,576 --> 03:17:03,038
It's the gentleman upon whose
farm we are. Mr. Max Yasgur!

1527
03:17:23,934 --> 03:17:24,810
Is this on?

1528
03:17:32,401 --> 03:17:34,661
I'm a farmer. I don't know...

1529
03:17:39,908 --> 03:17:41,827
I don't know how to speak to...

1530
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:44,329
...twenty people at one time,
let alone a crowd like this!

1531
03:17:47,707 --> 03:17:51,711
But I think you people have
proven something to the world.

1532
03:17:52,546 --> 03:17:56,383
Not only to the town of Bethel, or
Sullivan County, or New York State...

1533
03:17:56,716 --> 03:17:58,468
...you've proven something to the world.

1534
03:17:58,927 --> 03:18:03,640
This is the largest group of people
ever assembled in one place.

1535
03:18:08,228 --> 03:18:12,649
We have had no idea that there
would be this size group...

1536
03:18:13,692 --> 03:18:16,486
...and because of that you had quite...

1537
03:18:16,695 --> 03:18:19,656
...a few inconveniences as far as
water and food and so forth.

1538
03:18:19,865 --> 03:18:24,077
Your producers have done a mammoth
job to see that you're taken care of.

1539
03:18:24,453 --> 03:18:26,163
They would enjoy a vote of thanks.

1540
03:18:33,795 --> 03:18:38,008
But above that, the important thing
that you've proven to the world...

1541
03:18:39,050 --> 03:18:41,011
...is that a half a million kids...

1542
03:18:41,470 --> 03:18:44,806
...and I call you kids, because I have
children that are older than you are...

1543
03:18:45,265 --> 03:18:48,310
...a half a million young people
can get together...

1544
03:18:48,769 --> 03:18:54,024
...and have 3 days of fun and music
and have nothing but fun and music.

1545
03:18:54,357 --> 03:18:56,234
And I, God bless you for it!

1546
03:19:22,385 --> 03:19:24,054
I see we meet again.

1547
03:28:11,706 --> 03:28:14,376
"Purple haze was in my brain."

1548
03:28:15,794 --> 03:28:18,505
"Lately things don't seem the same."

1549
03:28:19,506 --> 03:28:22,676
"I'm acting funny,
but I don't know why."

1550
03:28:23,427 --> 03:28:26,513
"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."

1551
03:28:29,808 --> 03:28:32,769
"Purple haze all around."

1552
03:28:33,186 --> 03:28:36,523
"Don't know if I'm coming up or down."

1553
03:28:37,774 --> 03:28:40,444
"Am I happy or in misery?"

1554
03:28:40,902 --> 03:28:44,614
"Whatever it is, that
girl put a spell on me."

1555
03:28:47,909 --> 03:28:51,121
"Help me, baby. Help me, baby!"
