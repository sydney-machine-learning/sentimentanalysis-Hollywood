1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,461
<i>What can you say about</i>
<i>a 25-year-old girl who died?</i>

2
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:00,049
<i>That she was beautiful and brilliant?</i>

3
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:04,879
<i>That she loved Mozart and Bach?</i>

4
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,403
<i>The Beatles?</i>

5
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,770
<i>And me?</i>

6
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,954
- Do you have this book?
- You have your own library.

7
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:33,664
- Answer my question.
- Answer mine first.

8
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,450
We're allowed to use
the Radcliffe library.

9
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,340
I'm not talking legality,
I'm talking ethics.

10
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,132
Harvard's got five million books,
Radcliffe a few thousand.

11
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:46,796
I only want one. I've got
an hour exam tomorrow, damn it!

12
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:50,597
Please watch your profanity, preppy.

13
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,689
Why do you think
I went to prep school?

14
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:58,942
- You look stupid and rich.
- Actually, I'm smart and poor.

15
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,310
No, <i>I'm</i> smart and poor.

16
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:05,361
- Why are you so smart?
- I won't have coffee with you.

17
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:09,359
- I wouldn't ask you.
- That's what makes you stupid.

18
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,957
Comp. Lit. 105. Not bad.

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,923
Music 150. Not bad.
Music 201, that's a graduate course.

20
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:25,755
- Renaissance polyphony.
- What's polyphony?

21
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,640
Nothing sexual, preppy.

22
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,553
I told you, my name is Oliver.

23
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:33,807
- First or last?
- First.

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,436
- Oliver what?
- Barrett.

25
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:41,978
- Barrett like the poet?
- Yeah, no relation.

26
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:46,323
- Barrett like the hall?
- Yes.

27
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:49,533
I'm having coffee
with a Harvard building.

28
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:53,872
I'm not Barrett Hall. My great
grandfather just gave it to Harvard.

29
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:57,533
So his not-so-great grandson
could get in?

30
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:03,755
If you think I'm a loser, why did you
bulldoze me into buying you coffee?

31
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:07,217
I like your body.

32
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:17,221
- I major in Social Studies.
- It doesn't show.

33
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:21,566
- It's an honours programme.
- I know you've got a few brains.

34
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:26,023
- Really?
- You're hung up on me, aren't you?

35
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:33,067
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

36
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:37,831
Listen, you Radcliffe bitch.
There's a hockey game on Friday.

37
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,913
- So?
- I want you to come.

38
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,794
Why would I go
to a lousy hockey game?

39
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,878
- Because I'm playing.
- For which side?

40
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:30,426
Two minutes for number seven.
Holding.

41
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:36,589
<i>Penalty. Barrett, Harvard.</i>
<i>Two minutes. Holding.</i>

42
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,272
Why are you here
when your friends are playing?

43
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm in the penalty box.

44
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,202
- What did you do?
- I tried too hard.

45
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:58,448
- Is that a big disgrace?
- I'm trying to concentrate.

46
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,452
- On what?
- On how I'll total that bastard.

47
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,206
Come on, Harvard, let's go!

48
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,920
Are you a dirty player?
Would you ever total me?

49
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:12,510
- I will right now if you don't shut up.
- I'm leaving. Goodbye.

50
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:26,812
<i>Barrett back in the game.</i>
<i>Harvard have full strength.</i>

51
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:03,851
<i>And a goal. Ackerman.</i>
<i>Assist, Barrett.</i>

52
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,847
- Now I've seen a hockey game.
- What did you like best?

53
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,650
- When you were on your ass.
- Thanks for coming.

54
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:14,780
I didn't say you could kiss me.

55
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,075
- I was carried away.
- I wasn't.

56
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,791
I may not call you for a few months,

57
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:28,417
or I might call you
when I get back to my room.

58
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,544
- Bastard.
- You can dish it out, but not take it.

59
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,925
- Hello, animals.
- Hey, Ollie.

60
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:44,978
- What did you get?
- An assist.

61
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:48,391
- Off Cavilleri?
- None of your business.

62
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,977
- I'm your roommate!
- Has Barrett got a new goodie?

63
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:57,022
Jenny Cavilleri.
It's a music type from Rhode Island.

64
00:06:57,241 --> 00:07:02,200
- I know her. Real tight-ass.
- Plays piano for the Bach Society.

65
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:07,538
- What does she play with Barrett?
- Probably hard to get.

66
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:10,077
Simpson. Up yours.

67
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,416
That proves it.

68
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,142
Hello, Jen?

69
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:39,031
What would you say if I told you...
I think I'm in love with you?

70
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:46,039
Never say "love" if you don't mean it.
You're a known quantity.

71
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,577
Meaning?

72
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:52,952
You're known for quantity.
At Radcliffe, every hall is Barrett Hall.

73
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:00,046
- You've been checking up on me.
- I won't dine outdoors with anybody.

74
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:05,262
- Am I just anybody?
- What do you think, preppy?

75
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,938
You'll have to fend for yourself
this weekend.

76
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:18,030
I'll be mixing it up
with Francis LaPierre.

77
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,443
- Very funny.
- Are you jealous?

78
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,444
He's the captain
of the Cornell hockey team.

79
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:29,749
You've been reading the sports page.

80
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,671
I wouldn't mind
watching you play against Cornell.

81
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,220
No. I'll be involved.

82
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:48,181
Oh, yeah. The All-Ivy title.

83
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,273
- More than the All-Ivy title?
- A lot more.

84
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:07,825
<i>Cornell goal.</i>
<i>Score tied, 3-3.</i>

85
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,130
Come on, man! Quit!

86
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:27,429
I'll kick your ass back to Montreal!

87
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:34,857
Get up!

88
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,695
You're out of the game, Barrett.
Come on!

89
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:46,691
<i>- Je vais te casser la gueule!</i>
- I'll break yours before mine!

90
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:50,529
Come on, Barrett, get off the ice!

91
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,128
You Montreal faggots!

92
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,341
What?! Francis LaPierre
started the fight!

93
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,794
- Get in!
- Come on!

94
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,586
Five minutes for number seven. Fight.

95
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:13,098
<i>Penalty. Barrett, Harvard.</i>
<i>Five minutes for fighting.</i>

96
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,635
You probably want a steak, son.

97
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:32,469
No, thanks. The doctor took care of it.

98
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:35,638
I meant for your stomach, Oliver.

99
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:42,144
- I'm supposed to eat with the team.
- Oh, that's fine.

100
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,361
- Does your face hurt?
- No, sir.

101
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,818
- Jack Wells should take a look at it.
- That's not necessary.

102
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:55,737
- Jack's a specialist.
- It's nothing special.

103
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:01,993
- My car's there. Can I give you a lift?
- I'll walk you to your car.

104
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:06,506
Have you heard from the Law School?

105
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:10,217
I haven't exactly decided
on the Law School.

106
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:16,053
I was merely asking
if the Law School had decided on you.

107
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,807
- No.
- There really isn't any doubt.

108
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:23,684
- About what?
- The school needs good men like you.

109
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:29,062
- They haven't got a hockey team.
- You have other qualities, Oliver.

110
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,405
I'm sorry you had to see Harvard lose.

111
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,656
I came to see you play.

112
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:41,748
The Dean of the school
is an old classmate...

113
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,203
That's very nice, sir.

114
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,167
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

115
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:58,219
- Give my best to Mother.
- Yes, I will.

116
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:24,366
Briggs Hall. Sandy Davidson.

117
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,794
Jennifer Cavilleri.

118
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,209
You have a call.
She's in the downstairs phone booth.

119
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:33,593
- Where is that?
- Around the corner.

120
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:40,512
Would you please...
For God's sake, Phil!

121
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:46,894
Yes. Yeah, yeah,
for the million-and-oneth time, yeah!

122
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,321
Absolutely! Oh, I love you, too, Phil.

123
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,736
Yeah, I love you, too.

124
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,619
Goodbye.

125
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,662
- What happened? You look terrible.
- I'm injured.

126
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,545
Did you make
the other guy look worse?

127
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:08,873
I always make
the other guy look worse.

128
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:12,040
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

129
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,711
- Who's Phil?
- My father.

130
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:21,140
You call your father Phil?

131
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:24,935
- It's his name, what do you call yours?
- Son-of-a-bitch.

132
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:28,149
- To his face?
- I never see his face.

133
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,775
- Why? Does he wear a mask?
- In a way.

134
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:35,404
He must be proud.
You're a Harvard jock.

135
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:39,151
- So was he.
- Bigger than All-Ivy?

136
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,534
He rowed single sculls
in the 1928 Olympics.

137
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,454
- Did he win?
- No.

138
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,836
- Then why is he a son-of-a-bitch?
- He leans on me.

139
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,666
- He makes me do the right things.
- So?

140
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:59,425
I don't like to have to put out X amount
of achievement every term.

141
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:02,891
You hate making the Dean's list
and being All-Ivy!

142
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:08,476
He expects no less, and when
I come through, he is so indifferent.

143
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,776
- Ridiculous!
- And what did he say after the game?

144
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:14,358
He went all that way to watch you play?

145
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:20,575
After I was nearly massacred
by the wild Canadian hordes,

146
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,242
do you know what he said to his son?

147
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:27,785
- Whores in Ithaca?
- "I know the Dean of the Law School."

148
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:31,418
What did you expect him to say?
"How is your sex life?"

149
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,542
- Whose side are you on?
- I didn't know it was a war.

150
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:41,634
- You don't understand.
- More than you wish I did.

151
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:45,799
Did the son-of-a-bitch
at least get lousy grades?

152
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,607
- He was a Rhodes scholar.
- There's a problem of overachievement.

153
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,566
- Forget about it. There's no problem.
- Right.

154
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,284
Do I call my father on the phone?
Do I say, "I love you, Phil?"

155
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,115
- No.
- There you are.

156
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,206
And do you know why?
Because his name is Oliver.

157
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:15,464
The great Barrett Hall.
Don't you salute when you pass it?

158
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,838
- It's ugly. I've never been inside.
- That's a mature attitude.

159
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:23,139
It's not easy living with history.

160
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:28,058
- How many have to cope with that?
- I could name two.

161
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:30,732
Thanks.

162
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:46,743
<i>Must you play music while we study?</i>

163
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:50,871
<i>I'm studying the music.</i>
<i>It's called "Analysis of Form".</i>

164
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,461
<i>Yeah...</i>

165
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,457
<i>You'll flunk if you just stare at me.</i>

166
00:16:55,673 --> 00:17:00,169
<i>- I'm not. I'm studying.</i>
<i>- Bullshit. You're looking at my legs.</i>

167
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,716
<i>- You're not that great looking.</i>
<i>- I can't help if you think so.</i>

168
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:08,882
<i>- Let's change the subject.</i>
<i>- I wasn't aware there was one.</i>

169
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:13,053
<i>You think that I wanted</i>
<i>to make love to you.</i>

170
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:19,028
<i>- But I'm not interested.</i>
<i>- Then we've got one thing in common.</i>

171
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:25,407
I'm tired of playing your game.
You are a supreme Radcliffe smart-ass.

172
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,325
The best. You put down
anything in pants.

173
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:32,454
But verbal volleyball
is not my idea of a relationship.

174
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:37,829
If that's what you think it's all about,
go back to your music waltz.

175
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:45,341
I think you're scared. You put up
a wall to keep from getting hurt,

176
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:50,218
but it also keeps you
from getting touched.

177
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,055
It's a risk, isn't it, Jenny?

178
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,528
At least I had the guts
to admit what I felt.

179
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:05,279
Some day you'll have to come up with
the courage to admit that you care.

180
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,581
I care.

181
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:12,389
- Would your priest like this?
- I don't have one.

182
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:20,307
- Aren't you a good Catholic girl?
- Well, I'm a girl...

183
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,656
...and I'm good, right?

184
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:30,401
So that's two out of three.

185
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,949
- Why do you wear it?
- It was my mother's.

186
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:39,543
Why did you leave the Church?

187
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,709
I don't know.
I never really joined.

188
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:51,546
I never thought there was another world
better than this one.

189
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:56,758
What could be better than Mozart?

190
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,648
Or Bach?

191
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,442
Or you?

192
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,071
Jenny?

193
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,486
I'm up there with Bach and Mozart?

194
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,034
And The Beatles.

195
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,843
- Let me sack in your couch.
- How come?

196
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:33,091
- Barrett.
- Who's the guest of honour?

197
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:36,890
- Cavilleri.
- Again? Still?

198
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,511
Barrett's slipping.

199
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:00,073
It's amazing.

200
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,203
I'm really studying.

201
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:10,334
<i>- I'm</i> studying.
- Sorry.

202
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:19,228
Oliver?

203
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:25,018
I love you.

204
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:37,459
You were great.

205
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,880
- You know nothing about music.
- I know enough.

206
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:46,933
Wise up, would you please, Barrett?
I wasn't great or All-Ivy, just OK. OK?

207
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,314
OK.

208
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:54,856
- I mean you should keep at it.
- Who said I won't?

209
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,940
I'm going to study
with Nadia Boulanger.

210
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,198
Who?

211
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:03,738
Next year.
I have a scholarship in Paris.

212
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:05,830
Paris?

213
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:10,202
Yeah, I've never been to Europe.
I can hardly wait.

214
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:14,498
- How long have you known?
- It's inevitable.

215
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,042
What is?

216
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:19,507
That we'll separate.
You'll go to Law School.

217
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:24,714
- What are you talking about?
- You're a millionaire, I'm a social zero.

218
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:29,310
What do you mean?
We're together, we're happy.

219
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,941
Harvard is like a bag full of toys,
but when the holiday is over,

220
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:38,187
you have to go back
where you belong.

221
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:43,197
- Back to bake cookies?
- Pastries. Don't make fun of my father.

222
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,529
Then don't leave me, Jenny!

223
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,834
Please.

224
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:57,921
What about my scholarship
and Paris, which I've never seen?

225
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:03,553
- What about our marriage?
- Who said anything about marriage?

226
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:06,680
I'm saying it, now.

227
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:10,058
You want to marry me?

228
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:12,188
Yeah.

229
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,315
Why?

230
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:23,157
Because.

231
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,658
That's a good reason.

232
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,802
- You're driving like a maniac.
- Everybody does in Boston.

233
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,104
You'll kill us before
your parents can murder us.

234
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:59,312
- My parents will love you.
- Even the son-of-a-bitch?

235
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:03,607
Of course. Where is
the old Radcliffe confidence?

236
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:08,035
- Back at Radcliffe.
- It's going to be OK, Jenny.

237
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:12,289
- What did you say on the phone?
- Just that I'd drop by.

238
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,416
- Very casual, huh?
- Yeah, right.

239
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:18,663
How often do you visit during a term?

240
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,498
- Never.
- Oh, that's casual...

241
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,125
Holy shit!

242
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,833
Stop, Oliver. No kidding, stop the car.

243
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:17,055
I didn't think it would be like <i>this.</i>

244
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:20,142
- Like what?
- I mean, like this rich.

245
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:26,779
- This is too much for me.
- Don't worry. It'll be a breeze.

246
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:33,194
Yeah, but why do I wish my name
were Abigail Adams or Wendy Wasp?

247
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,710
Don't be scared.

248
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:42,252
- Aren't you?
- No.

249
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,726
- So far, so good.
- That's not saying much.

250
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,565
- Your hand is cold.
- So is yours.

251
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:11,406
- Let's get away from here.
- Master Oliver! Hello!

252
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:14,702
Hello, Florence. This is Jenny.

253
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:18,116
"Master"? I always knew
you had slaves.

254
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:27,247
Let me take your wrap.
Your parents are in the drawing room.

255
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,389
Thank you, Florence.

256
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:38,600
Half the buildings of Harvard
are hanging there.

257
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,349
Oh, it's nothing.

258
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:44,435
You're related to
the Sewall Boat House?

259
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:48,980
Yes, I come from a long line
of wood and stone.

260
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,032
Hello there.

261
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:06,081
- I'd like you to meet Jennifer Calaveri.
- Cavilleri.

262
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:10,758
- As in "Cavalleria Rusticana"?
- Right. No relation.

263
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:13,341
- Hello, Mum.
- Hello, darling.

264
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:16,259
Nice to meet you.
How are you, son?

265
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,842
Fine, sir, fine.

266
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:24,935
Please sit down
and make yourself at home.

267
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:39,821
We'll have to go soon.

268
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,741
Why are you so uncomfortable
with your parents?

269
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:49,706
- Why did you want to leave at once?
- I didn't like how they treated you.

270
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:52,249
"What is it your parents are in?"

271
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:56,217
- What is it your people are in?
- My father bakes cookies.

272
00:30:56,431 --> 00:31:00,345
- What's the name of the firm?
- Phil's Bake Shop.

273
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,973
- Of Cranston, Rhode Island.
- How interesting...

274
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:10,266
- So your people are from Cranston?
- Mostly. My mother is from Fall River.

275
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:15,694
- The Barretts have mills in Fall River.
- Where they exploited the poor.

276
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,031
In the 19th century.

277
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:22,112
When you inherit,
you can give all our money back.

278
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,833
That's what the philosopher
Saint-Simon advocated.

279
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:28,083
In the 18th century.

280
00:31:31,382 --> 00:31:34,632
- It's late.
- Aren't you staying for dinner?

281
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:37,335
- Yes.
- No. I have to get back.

282
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:40,675
You're staying for dinner
and that's an order.

283
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:44,510
Everything is an order,
a directive, a command.

284
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:47,302
Where is your sense of humour?

285
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:50,560
In school, he used to send me memos.

286
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,528
Memos! Don't you find that odd?

287
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:56,443
I find it rather cute.

288
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:02,069
Have you heard from Law School?

289
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,871
- Not yet.
- He'll get in. Who's better than Oliver?

290
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:09,250
I agree. He'll graduate with honours.

291
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:13,246
He's always done well in school.
At Exeter, he was...

292
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:18,294
It doesn't mean a thing.
I'm just one of many trying to get in.

293
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:24,924
- I could give Price Zimmermann a ring.
- No! I mean, please don't, sir.

294
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,517
Just to find out if he knows.

295
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:32,191
I want to get my letter
with everyone else. Please.

296
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,359
- He was only trying to be helpful.
- I don't need that kind of help.

297
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:43,412
- OK.
- No, it's not OK.

298
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:48,579
He's not going to be satisfied
until he cuts them off.

299
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:51,628
What you wouldn't like to be cut off.

300
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:56,508
Oh... Well, we've got
to take care of those.

301
00:32:56,718 --> 00:33:02,507
- Take care.
- Get there a minute later, but get there.

302
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:13,556
- You really like to bug your father.
- The feeling is mutual.

303
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:17,276
You wouldn't stop at anything
to get to him.

304
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:21,107
It's impossible to get to Oliver Barrett III.

305
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:26,988
Unless maybe if you marry
Jennifer Cavilleri?

306
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:36,788
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, it's part of it.

307
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:40,916
You don't believe I love you?

308
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:45,764
Yes, but you also love
my negative social status.

309
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,018
No.

310
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,102
I can't pass judgement.
I just think so.

311
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:58,685
I love not only you,
but also your name and your numeral.

312
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:02,653
After all, it's part of what you are.

313
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,738
- Oh, how can you do it?
- What?

314
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:11,082
How can you see me
and still love me?

315
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:14,329
That's what it's about, preppy.

316
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:48,120
- How are you, son?
- I'm OK, sir.

317
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,366
Did you hear from Law School?

318
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:55,995
- Yes. I called you, remember?
- Yes. Congratulations.

319
00:34:56,212 --> 00:35:00,791
- You'll be on the Supreme Court.
- I may just chase ambulances.

320
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:03,844
Fine. How's Raymond?

321
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:06,627
He's fine. Got into OCS.

322
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:09,968
Army? That's good.

323
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:12,478
That's bad.

324
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:17,524
You haven't mentioned Jennifer.

325
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:22,230
What is there to say? You're
presenting us with a <i>fait accompli.</i>

326
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:26,859
- But what did you think?
- She's absolutely charming.

327
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:30,694
With her background,
to get to Radcliffe is...

328
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:36,204
- Get to the point!
- It doesn't concern her, but you.

329
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:39,539
Your rebellion. And you <i>are</i> rebelling.

330
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:41,633
I fail...

331
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:48,844
I fail to see how marrying a brilliant
Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.

332
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:52,058
She's not some crazy hippie.

333
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:55,103
She's not many things.

334
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:58,896
What irks you most,
that she's Catholic or poor?

335
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:02,312
- What attracts you most?
- I'm leaving.

336
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:09,575
Don't go off half-cocked.
I would only ask that you wait a bit.

337
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:11,695
Define "bit".

338
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:15,911
Finish Law School.
If it's real, it'll stand the test of time.

339
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,375
It is real,
but why should I put it through a test?

340
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:23,122
- I'm asking you.
- You're commanding me!

341
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:28,584
If you marry her now,
I'll not give you the time of day.

342
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:33,264
Father, you don't know the time of day!

343
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:01,910
We're looking forward
to having you with us.

344
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,799
Me too, Dean Thompson.

345
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:08,670
- Something has come up.
- A change of heart?

346
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:12,718
No, I'm still set on Law School, but...

347
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:16,345
I'm going to need a scholarship.

348
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:20,520
- Really?
- That's why I'm here.

349
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,770
That's rather curious,
considering your background.

350
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:30,987
- I'm not his son anymore.
- I beg your pardon?

351
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:38,874
We have had a misunderstanding.
It's a parting of the ways.

352
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:46,624
- This is very unfortunate, Mr Barrett.
- I'm not exactly jumping for joy.

353
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:51,550
We have many entering students
in far worse straits than you.

354
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:56,970
What's worse than destitution?
I'm getting married next month.

355
00:37:57,185 --> 00:38:03,686
We'll work all summer, and then
Jenny will teach in a private school.

356
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,313
That's a living, but not tuition.
Your tuition is pretty steep.

357
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:09,572
Yes.

358
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:16,363
I need a scholarship.
I have already been accepted.

359
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:21,040
- I don't have any money.
- You have a millionaire father.

360
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,874
<i>Had.</i> Why should I be penalised just
because I was related to a rich man?

361
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:35,096
Mr Barrett, I don't think that this office
should enter into a family quarrel.

362
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:40,472
- A rather distressing one, at that.
- I see. Thank you.

363
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:46,021
Perhaps at mid-year's.

364
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:52,316
Thank you. You've been
very generous with your time.

365
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:03,079
- We just passed my junior high school.
- I can't believe he liked my poverty.

366
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:06,827
He did! Now you've got
something in common.

367
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:10,249
God, when I first told him
Oliver Barrett...

368
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:14,250
- Yeah?
- He couldn't believe it.

369
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,175
He reminded me
of the Eleventh Commandment.

370
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,435
- Eleventh?
- "Do not bullshit thy father."

371
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,366
Any other commandments
I should know?

372
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,450
Yeah. "Stay loose."

373
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:52,726
- So is he for it? Does he approve?
- What do you think?

374
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:57,516
- I won't allow it, do you get me?
- You're tilting at windmills, Phil.

375
00:39:57,734 --> 00:40:02,811
Stop calling his father a windmill.
He's a distinguished citizen...

376
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,071
- Mr Cavilleri...
- Phil.

377
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:10,159
- I'll call his goddamn father.
- It won't do any good, goddammit!

378
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:13,538
- Don't use profanity in this house.
- You do.

379
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,668
- What will he think?
- That you've gone mad.

380
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:20,128
Because I won't allow a parent
to reject a child?

381
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,175
- Mr Cavilleri...
- Phil.

382
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:28,179
Phil, sir... I reject him, too!

383
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,597
Don't talk like that. A father's love
is something to cherish and respect.

384
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:37,228
- It's a rare thing.
- Especially in my family.

385
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:41,485
- Let's get him on the phone.
- We have this cold line.

386
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:47,448
He'll thaw and melt. Believe me,
when it's time to go to church...

387
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:50,494
Let's get him on the phone.

388
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,827
- Please, Phil.
- What?

389
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:56,704
About the church bit...

390
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,955
Well, we're kind of negative on it.

391
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:07,178
I didn't necessarily mean
the Catholic Church.

392
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:16,010
You know that Jennifer is Catholic?
She may have told you that.

393
00:41:16,229 --> 00:41:21,437
And her sainted mother
always dreamed of

394
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:24,937
the whole mass rigmarole,
but you're...

395
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:30,074
But God would bless this union
in any church.

396
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:33,037
- Phil?
- Yeah?

397
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:35,737
- About the God bit.
- Yeah?

398
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:40,536
- We're sort of negative about that, too.
- About God?

399
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:47,881
- About anybody's God?
- Neither of us believe.

400
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:52,050
And we won't be hypocrites.

401
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:58,386
If that's what you wish.
Just tell me who performs the wedding.

402
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:00,941
We do.

403
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,773
You mean to do it yourself?

404
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:14,613
That's... wonderful.

405
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:23,085
I mean, that's just... wonderful.

406
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:31,634
Do it yourself, huh?
I think that's just wonderful.

407
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:37,889
But, tell me, is it?
What's the word?

408
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:41,055
- You mean "legal"?
- Is it?

409
00:42:41,273 --> 00:42:46,231
Yes. One of the college chaplains
just sort of...

410
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:51,957
He presides over it,
and the couple address each other.

411
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:54,787
You mean the bride speaks, too?

412
00:42:57,714 --> 00:43:03,633
- It's a new world, Philip.
- Oh, yeah. It's new, all right.

413
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:19,027
Ready?

414
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:23,862
- Amen.
- They haven't started, yet.

415
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:27,442
How will I know?
I've never been to a do-it-yourself.

416
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,610
Listen to the words they have chosen
to read on this occasion.

417
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:32,874
Amen.

418
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,741
The priest said "sacred".

419
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:41,754
- He's not a priest.
- He is to me.

420
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:56,344
"When our two souls stand up
erect and strong

421
00:43:56,564 --> 00:44:01,107
"Face to face, silent,
drawing nigh and nigher

422
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:05,269
"Until the lengthening wings
break into fire at either curved point,

423
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,945
"What bitter wrong
can the earth do to us

424
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,279
"That we should not
long be here contented?

425
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:15,659
"Think! In mounting higher,
the angels would press on us

426
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:19,244
"And aspire to drop some golden orb
of perfect song

427
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:22,131
"Into our deep, dear silence

428
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,753
"Let us stay rather on earth, Beloved,

429
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:30,595
"Where the unfit contrarious
moods of men recoil away

430
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:33,642
"And isolate pure spirits

431
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:37,517
"And permit a place
to stand and love in for a day

432
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,858
"With darkness and
the death-hour rounding it."

433
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:45,446
"I give you my hand!

434
00:44:47,115 --> 00:44:51,990
"I give you my love
more precious than money

435
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:56,865
"I give you myself
before preaching or law

436
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:02,706
"Will you give me yourself?
Will you come travel with me?

437
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:09,503
"Shall we stick by each other
as long as we live?"

438
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,728
I, Oliver Barrett,
take you, Jennifer Cavilleri,

439
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:21,353
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...

440
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,858
...to love and to cherish
till death do us part.

441
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:32,946
I, Jennifer Cavilleri,
take you, Oliver Barrett,

442
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:36,744
as my wedded husband
from this day forward,

443
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:41,286
to love and to cherish
till death do us part.

444
00:45:54,182 --> 00:45:57,551
By the authority vested in me by
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

445
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:00,935
I pronounce you man and wife.

446
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:07,608
Now I'm being kept.

447
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,146
- You won't like it.
- I already do.

448
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:13,947
The school only pays me 3,000 a year.

449
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,743
- Why?
- Because my name is Mrs Barrett.

450
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:23,875
- Couldn't you be Miss Cavilleri?
- Then I'd be the Queen of Paris.

451
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:26,126
It's a bargain.

452
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:30,882
Four rooms for 82.50 a month
is impossible this side of Mongolia.

453
00:46:31,094 --> 00:46:34,676
But this is the Mongolian section
of Cambridge.

454
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,952
Gee...

455
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:48,738
I have to admit that
it's even worse than I expected.

456
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,742
- Yeah, but it's home.
- Yeah.

457
00:46:52,962 --> 00:46:55,204
- Well?
- Well what?

458
00:46:55,423 --> 00:46:59,420
- Carry me over the threshold.
- Do you believe that nonsense?

459
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:03,336
- Carry me and I'll tell you.
- We're at the top floor!

460
00:47:03,556 --> 00:47:06,889
OK, I'll be a young
and beautiful divorcee.

461
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:11,103
Hey, what is this, Barrett?

462
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:14,517
I'll tell you after we cross the threshold.

463
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,316
- This is not a threshold.
- Our name is there.

464
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:26,234
It's not an official threshold.
Upstairs, you preppy!

465
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:35,203
- Why are you so heavy?
- I might be pregnant.

466
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:38,090
- Are you?
- Scared you, didn't I?

467
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:41,549
- No, I...
- Don't bullshit me.

468
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:46,304
For a second I clutched.
Is this the official threshold?

469
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:49,137
- What do think?
- If you don't say yes...

470
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:50,394
Yes!

471
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:58,034
- Where's Barrett?
- Where are the kids?

472
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:03,758
Asleep, thank God. It's siesta time.
I've got 45 minutes.

473
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:07,052
That's more than they give me.

474
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:19,150
Damn it!

475
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:23,018
- What's wrong with this engine?
- You're a Harvard Magna.

476
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:26,523
- Not in mechanics.
- Welcome to the world, preppy.

477
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:29,611
- Listen, Cavilleri...
- The name's Barrett, Barrett.

478
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:32,911
Sometimes you are really a bitch.

479
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:44,164
- How are they treating you?
- Fine, except for one brat.

480
00:49:44,383 --> 00:49:47,052
He'll be breaking and entering
before 10.

481
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:50,926
- What now?
- He tried to pinch me.

482
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,675
- I don't blame him.
- Next time, I'll wallop him.

483
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:57,563
Not until you get his parents' tip.

484
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:02,443
Damn it!

485
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,947
- Let's get out of here.
- Don't touch me.

486
00:50:09,158 --> 00:50:14,532
- What a thing to say to your husband!
- Wash. You can touch me afterwards.

487
00:50:14,747 --> 00:50:19,788
I had another salary hassle today
with Miss Anne Miller Whitman.

488
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:27,417
- I hope you laid it on thick this time.
- I told her I was proud to work for them.

489
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:31,502
I said, "Even Barretts
have to pay their rent."

490
00:50:31,722 --> 00:50:35,138
- To which she retorted...
- "Ho, ho, ho!"

491
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:41,728
- Define "Ho, ho, ho".
- 3,500 for the year.

492
00:50:41,941 --> 00:50:43,483
Ridiculous!

493
00:50:43,692 --> 00:50:48,853
Would you like to support me while I
take courses to teach in public school?

494
00:50:51,617 --> 00:50:55,401
- Would you please say something?
- Ho, ho, ho.

495
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:46,373
- I thought you'd call after the meeting.
- I wanted you to study.

496
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:49,210
- Have you eaten?
- I waited for you.

497
00:51:49,425 --> 00:51:52,212
- You're a growing boy.
- Not anymore.

498
00:51:52,428 --> 00:51:55,345
Yes, in the mind.
Did you check the mail?

499
00:51:55,556 --> 00:51:59,684
Just one second.
This is a crucial precedent.

500
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:11,362
- Did you check the mail?
- No. Anything vital?

501
00:52:11,572 --> 00:52:15,486
- We are cordially invited...
...to pay the light bill.

502
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:18,204
To a dinner.

503
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:21,657
Your father's 60th birthday.

504
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:26,290
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

505
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:27,546
RSVP.

506
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:32,382
- You even have to ask?
- It's about time.

507
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:34,633
- For what?
- You know.

508
00:52:34,845 --> 00:52:38,095
Does he have to crawl here?
He's reaching out.

509
00:52:38,307 --> 00:52:41,261
My mother addressed it.

510
00:52:41,477 --> 00:52:46,269
Think. 60 years old. Maybe he won't
be around for a reconciliation.

511
00:52:46,482 --> 00:52:48,521
There won't be one.

512
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:52,186
- Oliver V will bug you...
- He won't be called that!

513
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:57,150
He can be called Bozo. He'll still
resent you for being a Harvard jock!

514
00:52:57,368 --> 00:53:00,951
- You'll be on the Supreme Court...
- He won't resent me!

515
00:53:01,163 --> 00:53:03,203
- Why not?
- Because I...

516
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:07,579
Your father loves you
like you'll love Bozo,

517
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:12,706
but you Barretts are so proud that you'll
always think you hate each other.

518
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:17,219
If it weren't for you?
The case is closed!

519
00:53:21,684 --> 00:53:27,271
- There's still the RSVP.
- I think you can handle it.

520
00:53:28,482 --> 00:53:32,812
I have never deliberately hurt anyone,
and I don't think I could.

521
00:53:33,028 --> 00:53:34,688
Jennifer!

522
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:38,112
Just answer no.

523
00:53:39,118 --> 00:53:43,863
- OK. What's the number?
- Can't you write a note?

524
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:47,035
I'll lose my nerve.
What's the number?

525
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:51,331
338-3434, and dial 1 first.

526
00:54:07,855 --> 00:54:14,189
Good evening, this is Jennifer Barrett.
Mr Barrett! Good evening, sir.

527
00:54:14,403 --> 00:54:16,894
Fine, thank you.

528
00:54:17,114 --> 00:54:19,688
Yes, we did. That's why I'm calling.

529
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:24,156
I'm terribly sorry,
I mean <i>we're</i> terribly sorry,

530
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:27,041
but... no, we can't.

531
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,753
I'm sorry.

532
00:54:32,004 --> 00:54:35,207
Oliver, please talk to him.
Just say hello.

533
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:40,761
- I will never talk to him.
- Can't you do it for me?

534
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:47,057
I've never asked you to do anything
in my whole life. Just for me.

535
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,312
No.

536
00:54:52,066 --> 00:54:55,186
You're a heartless bastard.

537
00:54:56,362 --> 00:54:59,612
Mr Barrett?
Oliver would like you to know

538
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:04,236
that in his own special way,
he loves you very much.

539
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:07,822
Get the hell out of my life!

540
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:52,598
I forgot my key.

541
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:56,720
Jenny, I'm sorry.

542
00:58:57,728 --> 00:58:58,979
Don't.

543
00:59:00,106 --> 00:59:02,857
Love means
never having to say you're sorry.

544
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,843
Concentrate on blending
and stop showing off your voice.

545
01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:19,511
But I wasn't!

546
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:24,219
- No bullshit. You were showing off.
- Sorry, Jenny.

547
01:02:24,438 --> 01:02:29,146
One last time and this time
I want crisp diction.

548
01:03:15,422 --> 01:03:21,507
Wow! That was really
incredibly, absolutely...

549
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:24,386
...not bad.

550
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:33,266
- Tomorrow at 8.30, OK?
- OK. Bye, Jenny.

551
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:54,369
Well, Barrett,
what brings you to church?

552
01:03:54,586 --> 01:03:57,706
The saloons closed early.

553
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:01,738
Did you get us a tree?

554
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,382
Don't worry about it.
We'll get one on the way home.

555
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:12,181
What are you doing New Year's Eve?

556
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,738
Sleeping.

557
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,055
I thought you'd want
to spend it with me.

558
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:25,864
What are you doing?

559
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:28,605
Sleeping.

560
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,993
Some day, we'll look back
on these days...

561
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,712
The sooner, the better.

562
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:49,099
Go!

563
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:57,679
Jennifer, come here!

564
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:02,486
Jennifer, come here!

565
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:07,108
What? Come on!
Start it over again.

566
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:10,944
- What is it?
- I have something important to tell you.

567
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:16,157
- Couldn't you tell me over there?
- No, I want to be alone with you.

568
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,331
Fantastic news. Here, read.

569
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:23,538
Harvard Law School?
You got kicked out.

570
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:26,510
Read it, will you?
It's great news.

571
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:32,473
- You were first in the class?
- Not quite. Third.

572
01:05:32,684 --> 01:05:37,642
- Only third, huh?
- That means I make the Law Review.

573
01:05:40,192 --> 01:05:42,765
Say something, please.

574
01:05:42,986 --> 01:05:47,695
Not until I've met
numbers one and two.

575
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:07,459
And the William DeJersey Memorial
Award for the finest senior essay to...

576
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:10,548
...Oliver Barrett Iv.

577
01:06:26,947 --> 01:06:29,070
- On your feet.
- How much?

578
01:06:29,282 --> 01:06:31,156
500 big ones!

579
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:32,945
Holy shit!

580
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:37,075
- Get up! Come on!
- Quiet!

581
01:06:41,253 --> 01:06:45,749
The Jennifer Barrett Maternity Award!

582
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:06,937
- It was a good apartment for 80 bucks.
- Now our garage will cost that.

583
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:11,317
- Why have a car in New York?
- House calls, Jenny.

584
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:15,613
Lawyers for Jonas and Marsh
don't make house calls.

585
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:19,957
- Yes, to Mr Jonas and Mr Marsh.
- You can walk there.

586
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:23,701
- Rich people ride.
<i>- Nouveau riche</i> people.

587
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,877
That's us.

588
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:31,000
You won't laugh? I'm actually
getting to like the name Bozo.

589
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:33,378
- For what?
- Our kid.

590
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:36,218
Our huge and bruising All-Ivy tackle.

591
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:40,347
- Bozo Barrett?
- It's the name of a Harvard superjock.

592
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:44,975
You would actually call
our offspring Bozo?

593
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:47,861
Only if it's a boy.

594
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:03,247
- We have crossed the poverty line.
- Not quite.

595
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,212
- What?
- Not until I'm carried over the threshold.

596
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:10,715
- We've done that!
- Now you're a lawyer. It'll be legal.

597
01:08:10,926 --> 01:08:14,129
- It's on the tenth floor!
- Carry me in the elevator.

598
01:08:14,346 --> 01:08:16,801
Thank God for that.

599
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,793
- Can I help?
- Barrett. 10-H. The bags are in the car.

600
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:25,735
- Is the lady all right?
- I will be when I'm over the threshold.

601
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,070
- Newly-weds, huh?
- Eternally.

602
01:08:29,286 --> 01:08:31,078
Move your ass, preppy.

603
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:46,365
You've got it made, you bastard.
Made in the shade.

604
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:52,395
- Snug as a bug in a rug.
- Cut the crap and play.

605
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:56,111
Working for Jonas and Marsh,
pulling in the coin...

606
01:08:56,323 --> 01:08:59,277
- Play, damn it!
- I can't help it.

607
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,501
Married to "Foul Mouth Angelface".

608
01:09:05,712 --> 01:09:07,834
Pay attention.

609
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:12,127
- Why should you have all the luck?
- It was a long drag.

610
01:09:12,343 --> 01:09:16,637
This is the first week
that Jenny hasn't had to work.

611
01:09:16,848 --> 01:09:21,973
- What is she going to do?
- I want her to study, she wants a baby.

612
01:09:22,186 --> 01:09:25,436
- So?
- So we're making babies.

613
01:09:27,692 --> 01:09:33,315
- Do you need any help, old buddy?
- I'll call you if I need you.

614
01:10:02,351 --> 01:10:08,354
- Whose fault is it?
- I wouldn't use the word "fault".

615
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:11,772
OK, we'll put it your way.

616
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:19,157
Two 24-year-olds can't make a baby.
One must be malfunctioning. Who?

617
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,952
Jenny.

618
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,785
All right, then we'll adopt kids.

619
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:31,875
The problem is more serious.
Jenny is very sick.

620
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,592
Define "very sick".

621
01:10:39,011 --> 01:10:41,514
She's dying.

622
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:49,308
That's impossible.

623
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:53,315
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

624
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:57,481
That's impossible.

625
01:10:58,531 --> 01:11:01,318
It's a mistake, it has to be.

626
01:11:01,534 --> 01:11:06,825
We repeated her blood test three times.
The diagnosis is correct.

627
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:10,702
She'll have to be told soon.

628
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:16,375
We can withhold treatment
for a little while, but not for long.

629
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:21,585
We'll have to begin therapy
sometime during the next few weeks.

630
01:11:21,804 --> 01:11:24,473
She's only 24.

631
01:11:28,811 --> 01:11:31,931
- Will it be painful?
- Hopefully not.

632
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:37,853
You'll want to talk to a haematologist.
I can refer you to Dr Addison.

633
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,323
Yeah.

634
01:11:43,075 --> 01:11:46,610
What do I do?
What can I do for Jenny?

635
01:11:47,914 --> 01:11:52,492
Act as normal as possible,
for as long as possible.

636
01:11:54,212 --> 01:11:57,296
That's really the best thing.

637
01:11:59,175 --> 01:12:00,635
Normal.

638
01:12:02,345 --> 01:12:06,045
OK, I'll be as normal as hell.

639
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,142
Jen?

640
01:13:39,187 --> 01:13:41,017
Jenny, I'm home.

641
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:45,067
- I need a lawyer.
- I'm a lawyer.

642
01:13:45,277 --> 01:13:47,435
I need you.

643
01:13:47,654 --> 01:13:51,486
- I need you, too.
- Why? I'm not a lawyer.

644
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:55,744
No, but you're a nut,
and I happen to need a nut.

645
01:13:56,621 --> 01:14:00,121
- You look lovely, Jenny.
- Bullshit.

646
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:04,497
- OK, you look terrible.
- No, I never look terrible.

647
01:14:04,713 --> 01:14:09,339
- I look OK for Thursday evening, OK?
- There's no poetry in "OK".

648
01:14:09,551 --> 01:14:13,418
Screw poetry.
Just tell me what you see.

649
01:14:13,638 --> 01:14:17,221
- I see you.
- That's poetry.

650
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:22,060
Did Dr Shapeley tell you
that we both checked out?

651
01:14:22,272 --> 01:14:23,315
Yeah.

652
01:14:23,815 --> 01:14:27,350
So we just have to keep trying, right?

653
01:14:28,528 --> 01:14:32,484
- Yeah, let's try now.
- At this very minute?

654
01:14:33,366 --> 01:14:34,930
Even sooner.

655
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,891
Jenny?

656
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:08,183
Get out there and support me in
the manner to which I'll be accustomed.

657
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:09,861
Get up.

658
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:15,692
- Are you meeting Stratton today?
- Who?

659
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:21,069
Ray Stratton, your best friend.
Your roommate before me.

660
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:27,087
- We're supposed to play, but I'll cancel.
- The hell you will!

661
01:15:27,295 --> 01:15:31,163
- Why not?
- I don't want a flabby husband.

662
01:15:31,383 --> 01:15:35,048
- All right, but I'll take you out to dinner.
- Why?

663
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:38,595
Can't I take my wife
to dinner if I want to?

664
01:15:38,807 --> 01:15:43,634
- OK, Barrett, what's her name?
- What?

665
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:49,393
If you take your wife out in the middle
of the week, you're screwing somebody.

666
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:08,868
- What's the matter?
- Off day.

667
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:13,085
You've had an off day
for two weeks now.

668
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:17,845
Jonas wants me to go to Chicago
on a big case.

669
01:16:18,888 --> 01:16:21,973
That newscaster
that got beat up by the cops.

670
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:25,718
Fantastic. You on the other side
of a punch-out rap.

671
01:16:25,937 --> 01:16:28,689
- I turned him down.
- Why?

672
01:16:28,898 --> 01:16:32,398
I couldn't see living in some hotel.

673
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:35,611
Boy, you're really married!

674
01:16:37,407 --> 01:16:40,278
Your time will come.

675
01:17:40,053 --> 01:17:41,677
Mrs Barrett!

676
01:17:41,888 --> 01:17:44,593
I'm in the kitchen where I belong.
Come here.

677
01:17:44,808 --> 01:17:47,762
- Guess what.
- You got fired.

678
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:52,390
- I got fired up. Guess where to.
- Reno, Nevada.

679
01:17:52,607 --> 01:17:56,107
Paris, France.
We'll be there Christmas Day.

680
01:17:57,654 --> 01:18:00,904
No, that's not the way we'll do it.

681
01:18:01,116 --> 01:18:05,493
- Do what?
- I don't want Paris, I don't need Paris.

682
01:18:05,704 --> 01:18:09,867
- I just want you.
- That you got, baby.

683
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:16,413
And I want time,
which you can't give me.

684
01:18:21,303 --> 01:18:22,845
You saw Dr Shapeley?

685
01:18:25,056 --> 01:18:28,472
And his buddy, too.
He's a very nice guy.

686
01:18:31,146 --> 01:18:33,815
- Good. Who?
- Dr Addison.

687
01:18:34,024 --> 01:18:38,982
He's a Yalie, college and med school.
But I said you wouldn't mind.

688
01:18:41,072 --> 01:18:43,398
Not if he's nice.

689
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:47,532
He didn't bullshit me,
and that's what I wanted.

690
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:55,143
- OK, then for the Yalie doctor.
- OK.

691
01:19:07,974 --> 01:19:11,748
I'm counting on you to be strong,
you goddamn hockey jock.

692
01:19:13,647 --> 01:19:16,517
I will, baby. I will.

693
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:23,021
It will be hardest for Phil.

694
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:28,649
You, after all, are going to be
the merry widower.

695
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:37,370
- I won't be merry.
- Yes, you will. I want you to be merry.

696
01:19:37,587 --> 01:19:40,671
You'll be merry, OK?

697
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:43,551
OK.

698
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:46,554
OK.

699
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,728
- Enough?
- No. I love watching you.

700
01:21:22,937 --> 01:21:28,726
- The old hockey fake-out.
- That's you, the old hockey fake-out.

701
01:21:28,943 --> 01:21:32,692
- Can we get hot chocolate?
- Sure, I'll even pay.

702
01:21:32,906 --> 01:21:38,991
- Very gracious of you.
- I liked it best when I supported you.

703
01:21:39,204 --> 01:21:44,364
You always supported me.
After all, what's money?

704
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:46,826
I don't know.

705
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:58,337
- Could we afford a taxi?
- Sure. Where do you want to go?

706
01:22:00,194 --> 01:22:02,347
The hospital.

707
01:23:31,608 --> 01:23:36,768
She's getting white cells and platelets,
which she needs most.

708
01:23:36,988 --> 01:23:40,772
- She doesn't want antimetabolites.
- What's that?

709
01:23:40,992 --> 01:23:46,746
A treatment that slows cell destruction.
But there are unpleasant side effects.

710
01:23:46,956 --> 01:23:49,827
Jenny's the boss.
Whatever she wants.

711
01:23:50,043 --> 01:23:54,372
Do everything you can
to make sure it doesn't hurt.

712
01:23:54,589 --> 01:23:57,792
- We will.
- I don't care what it costs.

713
01:23:58,009 --> 01:24:01,129
- It could take months.
- Screw the cost.

714
01:24:01,346 --> 01:24:05,723
There's no way of knowing
how long she'll linger.

715
01:24:05,934 --> 01:24:08,432
I want her to have the very best.

716
01:24:09,187 --> 01:24:15,183
I'm wealthy. I'm rich.
Really, I'm like a millionaire.

717
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,466
- How have you been?
- Fine, sir.

718
01:24:57,861 --> 01:25:01,815
- And how is Jennifer?
- She's fine, sir.

719
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:10,284
I need to borrow 5,000 dollars
for a very good reason.

720
01:25:15,504 --> 01:25:16,547
Well?

721
01:25:18,591 --> 01:25:22,042
- Sir?
- May I know the reason?

722
01:25:23,304 --> 01:25:27,467
I can't tell you.
Just lend me the money, please.

723
01:25:27,683 --> 01:25:30,969
- Don't they pay you at the firm?
- Yes, sir.

724
01:25:31,817 --> 01:25:34,970
- And doesn't she teach...
- Don't call her "she".

725
01:25:36,317 --> 01:25:38,986
- Doesn't Jennifer...
- Leave her out of it.

726
01:25:39,194 --> 01:25:44,276
Just write out a cheque.
It's a very important personal matter.

727
01:25:45,576 --> 01:25:47,810
You got some girl in trouble?

728
01:25:50,289 --> 01:25:52,827
Yeah, that's it.

729
01:25:58,714 --> 01:26:00,541
Please lend me the money.

730
01:26:43,759 --> 01:26:46,332
Thank you, Father.

731
01:27:52,995 --> 01:27:54,573
How is she?

732
01:27:54,788 --> 01:27:57,030
She wants the troops home
for Christmas.

733
01:27:57,249 --> 01:28:01,710
- Always running the show.
- She may succeed.

734
01:28:01,921 --> 01:28:04,875
- That fast?
- Yes.

735
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,642
Hello, baby.

736
01:28:25,861 --> 01:28:26,904
Phil.

737
01:28:27,655 --> 01:28:30,572
How is it going, Mrs B?

738
01:28:30,783 --> 01:28:34,733
It's going, preppy.
The troops will be home for Christmas.

739
01:28:34,954 --> 01:28:38,951
- That's a little trite.
- It's the goddamn truth.

740
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:43,460
Watch your language.
There's a grown-up present.

741
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:47,336
I hope so. Phil made a few promises.

742
01:28:47,549 --> 01:28:49,589
Don't worry, Jenny.

743
01:28:52,263 --> 01:28:55,263
Maybe I ought to let you guys...

744
01:28:55,474 --> 01:28:57,763
I'll be nearby.

745
01:29:07,695 --> 01:29:10,364
It doesn't hurt, Ollie.

746
01:29:11,907 --> 01:29:15,407
It's like falling off a cliff in slow motion.

747
01:29:17,288 --> 01:29:22,282
Only after a while you wish you'd hit
the ground already, you know?

748
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:23,544
Yeah.

749
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:27,082
Bullshit. You've never fallen off a cliff.

750
01:29:28,465 --> 01:29:31,799
Yes, I did. When I met you.

751
01:29:33,971 --> 01:29:35,014
Yeah.

752
01:29:36,098 --> 01:29:39,016
"What a falling off was there."

753
01:29:40,019 --> 01:29:43,222
- Who said that?
- I don't know. Shakespeare?

754
01:29:43,785 --> 01:29:45,416
Yeah, but who?

755
01:29:47,192 --> 01:29:49,108
I mean, what play?

756
01:29:49,904 --> 01:29:53,118
I went to Radcliffe, I'm supposed
to remember those things.

757
01:29:58,579 --> 01:30:01,816
I once knew all
the Mozart Koechel listings.

758
01:30:03,379 --> 01:30:06,293
- Big deal.
- You bet it was.

759
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:12,089
What number is
the A Major Concerto?

760
01:30:13,802 --> 01:30:19,592
- I don't know. I'll look it up.
- But I used to know all those things.

761
01:30:22,186 --> 01:30:27,809
- Do you want to talk music?
- What do you want to talk? Funerals?

762
01:30:29,985 --> 01:30:32,488
No, I don't.

763
01:30:39,286 --> 01:30:40,537
Ollie?

764
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:46,501
I told Phil you could have
a Catholic service

765
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:50,411
and you'd say OK. OK?

766
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:56,335
It'll really help him a lot, you know?

767
01:30:59,473 --> 01:31:00,516
OK.

768
01:31:03,644 --> 01:31:06,645
Now you've got to stop being sick.

769
01:31:07,314 --> 01:31:08,357
Me?

770
01:31:09,942 --> 01:31:13,477
That guilty look on your face,
it's sick.

771
01:31:20,494 --> 01:31:25,536
Stop blaming yourself,
you stupid preppy. It's nobody's fault.

772
01:31:31,839 --> 01:31:34,508
It's not your fault.

773
01:31:40,389 --> 01:31:44,524
That's the only thing I'll ask you.
Otherwise, you'll be OK.

774
01:32:02,036 --> 01:32:04,408
Screw Paris!

775
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,584
What?

776
01:32:10,169 --> 01:32:14,992
Screw Paris and music and everything
you thought you stole from me.

777
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:18,390
I don't care, don't you believe that?

778
01:32:29,521 --> 01:32:33,409
Then get the hell out of here!
I don't want you at my deathbed!

779
01:32:38,948 --> 01:32:41,486
I believe you.

780
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,156
I really do.

781
01:32:46,413 --> 01:32:47,975
That's better.

782
01:32:53,411 --> 01:32:55,994
Would you please
do something for me?

783
01:33:02,722 --> 01:33:04,669
Would you please hold me?

784
01:33:16,652 --> 01:33:20,799
I mean really hold me. Next to me.

785
01:34:33,687 --> 01:34:35,147
Philip?

786
01:34:47,701 --> 01:34:49,578
I wish...

787
01:34:54,416 --> 01:34:57,549
I wish I hadn't promised Jenny...

788
01:35:03,592 --> 01:35:07,289
I wish I hadn't promised Jenny
to be strong for you.

789
01:35:51,181 --> 01:35:52,510
Oliver.

790
01:35:53,851 --> 01:35:55,699
Why didn't you tell me?

791
01:35:56,478 --> 01:36:00,909
I made some calls, and when I found out
I jumped in the car.

792
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,069
Oliver, I want to help.

793
01:36:05,154 --> 01:36:07,320
Jenny's dead.

794
01:36:09,825 --> 01:36:11,941
- I'm sorry.
- Love...

795
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:17,488
Love means
never having to say you're sorry.

796
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:10,979
