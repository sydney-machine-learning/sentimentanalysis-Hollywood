1
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,477
Come here!

2
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,048
Close the door..

3
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,447
Close the door!

4
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:02,015
You ain't at the photographer's!

5
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:06,186
You ain't gettin' your picture taken..

6
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,564
Move!

7
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,419
Oh fuck!

8
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,215
Oh, you got a sweet, um..

9
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:09,240
You got a sweet, sweetback!

10
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,827
Besides, we're getting a lot
of static from the chief

11
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:24,037
about that stiff that was found yesterday.

12
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,569
You know what I mean?

13
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,564
We don't know nothin' about no dead man.

14
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,971
We know that but the commissioner doesn't.

15
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,237
We just want to borrow one of
your boys for a couple of hours

16
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:52,486
and take him downtown to
make us look good, official-wise.

17
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,658
Why me? I'm short one man already!

18
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,566
George is sick!

19
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,746
You're our friend.
We knew you'd be willing to lend a hand.

20
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,351
Hmm. When did you people start getting
so interested in black folks..

21
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:07,314
.. Dead or alive?!

22
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,490
It's progress!

23
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:27,859
I can't..

24
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,171
I'm short!

25
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,136
I only got two guys working now...

26
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:32,948
Donald to explain,

27
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:37,383
Sweetback to train,
and the two of 'em to trounce and bounce.

28
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,676
We got a nice understanding, Beatle.

29
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,095
It's mutual..

30
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,514
Everybody profits...

31
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:17,683
Let's keep it that way!

32
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,987
I'm the good dyke fairy godmother.

33
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,579
Yes, the good dyke fairy godmother.

34
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:55,560
Why didn't you know
that all good dykes..

35
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,097
had fairy godmothers?

36
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,392
And I'm here to answer
to the prayers

37
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,536
of a good dyke.

38
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,287
Yes, the good dyke fairy godmother.

39
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,375
Didn't you know that all good dykes

40
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:20,186
have fairy godmothers?

41
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,584
And I'm here to answer the prayers

42
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:26,792
of a good dyke.

43
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,001
Zap, child.

44
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:53,820
Why me? I'm short-handed as it is..

45
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,114
George is sick!

46
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:04,623
Come on baby, Sweetback.
Come on, girl!

47
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:07,819
Clean on down to the bone!

48
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,647
Do it, do it do it!

49
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,966
You got it, Sweetback!

50
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,276
Get to it, brother!

51
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,843
You're cool, Sweetback!
You're cool!

52
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:45,426
.. or one of the other boys..

53
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:48,458
We'll have him back for you
before tomorrow noon.

54
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,836
Ha ha!
Now Sweetback here's the greatest!

55
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,970
Absolute greatest!

56
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,346
Greatest in the world!

57
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,316
Oh, I know what the hell you're thinking...
Ha!

58
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,605
How many times have I heard that before?

59
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,192
Well, as a special added attraction,

60
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,863
If one of you young ladies would
like to step up and try this gentleman,

61
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:21,391
I'm sure you will find him
more than lively.

62
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:31,387
But, uh, that is to say, uh,

63
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,935
However...

64
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,524
You know this offer is, um..
only open to, um...

65
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,594
.. Sisters?!

66
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,977
An ounce of prevention...

67
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,887
.. is worth a pound of sniffin' around.

68
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,897
Hey!

69
00:12:58,887 --> 00:12:59,828
That's all, folks.

70
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:05,128
When Sweetback gets dressed,
tell him I want to see him.

71
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:55,178
Go with these gentlemen for the evening.
See you tomorrow.

72
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,614
That's a hell of a show you guys put on!

73
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,414
We aren't going to use the handcuffs.

74
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,538
Just like we told Beatle.
Just a little eye-wash.

75
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:29,895
Cigarette?

76
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,741
Calling W2, calling W2.

77
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:10,166
Read you loud and clear!

78
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,871
Proceed to Unit 1. Crenshaw, Sector 2.

79
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:17,352
Back up ten, W4. Community disturbance,
possible 415 developing.

80
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:19,636
Step on it!
- Roger!

81
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,380
I got the cuffs...

82
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:42,210
It's just for appearance sake. We don't want
anyone to come around here and find you just sitting here.

83
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,804
Don't go away!

84
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:23,995
He must be the ringleader.

85
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:27,905
Come on, let's get him out of here
before a crowd forms.

86
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:20,999
You been stirring up the natives, kid?

87
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,616
Nice night!

88
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah.

89
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,677
Nice night for a drive..

90
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,950
.. A little walk, too, maybe.

91
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,595
All right, why don't you step out over here?

92
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:51,064
Get some fresh air.
.. That's better.

93
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,016
Looky, here...
He doesn't look very tough to me,
does he look tough to you?

94
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:59,731
Naw, he don't look too tough.

95
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:04,275
Be careful. Don't mark his face!
- Oh no, no.. we're not gonna hurt his face.

96
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:11,515
All right!
- Why sir, I think he's drunk!

97
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:14,780
Stand on your feet!
You're a tough man!

98
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:24,739
Wait a second.. Hey, Sweetback.

99
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,870
I'm sorry, man.

100
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,110
Forgot you two were attached together.

101
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:33,485
Let's see if we can't get
a little air between ya.

102
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,554
There. You step over here.

103
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,085
That's better, isn't it?

104
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,941
Let's see this militant.
You don't look too tough now!

105
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:54,042
Stay home at night,

106
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,263
and you wouldn't get into
all this.. trouble, would you?

107
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,921
What's the matter with you, you drunk?

108
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,926
He looks like a sniper to me!

109
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:41,890
Thanks, man.

110
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,336
Where we goin'?

111
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,414
Where d'you get that "we" shit?

112
00:23:57,672 --> 00:24:01,684
Sweetback!
Yeah..

113
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,110
Oh, hang loose, baby.
Yeah..

114
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,368
We gotta chop a skoch, you know?

115
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:13,478
I'm gonna lay it on ya, hmmm,

116
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,607
Sweetback, baby!

117
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,672
Looking good, yeah.

118
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,177
You looking good!

119
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:31,917
Yeah, baby, you gonna have to be awful cool.

120
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:34,965
Cause what you do, it'll affect
all the rest of our little ol' employees.

121
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:38,113
and we can't have that
'cause we got a good operation goin' here.

122
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:42,983
Being in public relations,
a nice little business.

123
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,946
But you don't have to worry about nothin'
I'm Beatle. Me, Beatle?.. I'm your man.

124
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:06,351
Everybody got a man. I'm your man!

125
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:09,563
It's rough now. Don't worry about it, baby!

126
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:11,884
Don't worry about it!

127
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:26,485
That make me feel like a new one, baby.
Can you dig it? A brand new one. Yeah..

128
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:29,697
But you know what, man?

129
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:36,416
Like you gonna have to kinda lay out..
.. you know?

130
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:41,301
Stretch out a little while, be real cool..
.. Kinda lay dead!

131
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,239
Ol' Beatle'll let you know what's
happenin', what's goin' down.

132
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:48,205
You don't have to worry about nothin'.
If you need anything, anything at all..

133
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:54,826
Brother, just keep the faith in Beatle -
ol' Beatle goin' to bring you through,

134
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,030
cause this is just a skirmish, yeah!
You know how the games goes, baby!

135
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:06,294
But you keep the faith in me and you my man.
You my favorite man!

136
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:12,168
Can you dig it, baby? Together,
you know? Maintain!

137
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,754
They can't bother you as long
as Beatle's with you.

138
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,826
Now you go on and hibernate
like that ol' bear

139
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:22,226
and don't go nowhere. Can you dig it?
... Yeah? Ha! Mellow!

140
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,476
Go out the back door, now.

141
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:26,094
Speed along and don't let
nobody know where you at.

142
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:30,499
Let sleeping dogs rest.
Can you dig it, baby? Ha, ha, yeah!

143
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,676
You were in the car.

144
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:05,745
Were you still in the car, Sweetback?

145
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:09,122
How many men were in the ambush?

146
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,034
How'd they work it?

147
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,227
You know they're still unconscious.

148
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:21,080
Come on, they were your friends too.

149
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,001
Do you know where Moo-Moo might be?

150
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,643
We can't figure out what they
used to beat them with.

151
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,617
Here, give me your coat.

152
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,322
Sir, I think we discovered the
weapon and one of the assailants.

153
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:00,908
Uh-huh?
- The suspect is a Mr. Sweetback.

154
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:02,304
Yeah?

155
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,812
I think we have a new development in the case.

156
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:07,023
Wash your car, mister?
- Stop bothering me, now get away from here...

157
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:09,710
I'm sorry, sir.

158
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:12,168
Proceed.

159
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:15,450
He didn't tell me where Mr. Moo-Moo was,
or anybody else.

160
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,311
Proceed!

161
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:21,960
No charge if you don't like it!
- Yeah, no charge if you don't like it!

162
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:23,903
Now just move away from the car.

163
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:27,451
Oh yes, I see.

164
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,697
You have the witness
called Sweetback...

165
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:37,331
.. and Mr. Sweetback knows the
whereabouts of the suspect,

166
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:43,280
but that Mr. Sweetback has
been injured in a fall.

167
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:45,736
Not too badly, I hope.

168
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,301
Fell down and bruised himself, sir?

169
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:48,692
Can we print that, Commissioner?

170
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:52,228
Of course. I have no secrets from the press.

171
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:56,295
I don't?? I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.
- Fine!.. Fine!

172
00:28:57,606 --> 00:29:01,693
You say the witness has given
you the whereabouts of the suspect.

173
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:05,718
Too bad the witness has injured
himself in a fall!

174
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:08,547
Okay.. right, sir!

175
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:11,956
Proceed!

176
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,700
Well?

177
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:28,363
Commissioner says beat the information
out of the nigger before we get
him to the station.

178
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:52,255
Wait a minute.. let's take him some place
where we can really work on him.

179
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:04,883
Twelve units have been alerted and a search pattern..
-- The suspect has escaped..

180
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,301
from arresting Unit 6A-2
-- has been constructed over the area

181
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:09,093
Barricades have been set up immediately adjoining the streets..
-- An explosion denoted vehicles causing extensive damage.

182
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,240
4 additional units are now on the scene assisting.

183
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:13,654
When second officer went to the rescue of the driver..
-- All other available units are being deployed..

184
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,828
.. the witness disappeared
-- in searching the area..

185
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,490
Apprehension, a matter of moments! Impossible to..
-- .. busy crowd.

186
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:32,538
You sure are Jive!

187
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,376
And don't tell me you came here looking for Steve.
You know Steve's not here!

188
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,962
He's got two more months to do!

189
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:43,806
What are you, some kind of
Indian giver or something?

190
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:45,551
You gave me to him..

191
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:48,996
I knew you'd be back.

192
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:53,684
What do you want me to do, take them off?

193
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,042
Beg...
- No!

194
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:57,809
You too proud to beg?

195
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:00,441
No.. but you wouldn't take them off if I did.

196
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,136
You know every Goddamn thing, don't you?

197
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:08,616
Well, first things.. first!

198
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:38,853
Where's Sweetback?
- Where's Sweetback?

199
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,934
I don't -- I don't know where Sweetback is.

200
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:41,736
Where's Sweetback??

201
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:44,488
I don't know. I don't know where Sweetback is.
I don't know where Sweetback..

202
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,649
Come on, you can tell us.

203
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:48,194
He seems to be hard of hearing.
- No, uh-uh!

204
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:50,209
If he don't talk, he's going to be!

205
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,619
Where's Sweetback?
- Where is he?

206
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,720
Where's Sweetback?

207
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:56,122
I don't know where Sweetback...

208
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,118
Where is Sweetback?

209
00:33:58,349 --> 00:33:59,607
Come on, boy!

210
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:01,923
I don't know Sweetback is.

211
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,239
Come on boy, talk!

212
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:05,127
So, where's Sweetback?
- I don't no where Sweetback is!

213
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:06,921
Come on, boy!
- Where's Sweetback?

214
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,238
He must be deaf!

215
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:09,565
If he isn't, he's going to be.

216
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,305
Look at me.

217
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,258
Where's Sweetback?

218
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:13,722
I don't know where he is.

219
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:14,967
Where is he?

220
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,126
I don't know where Sweetback--
I don't know where Sweetback is.

221
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:19,961
Come on! You know it!
- Where is Sweetback?

222
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:21,044
I don't know where is Sweetback!

223
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,927
Tell me!
- Where's he at?

224
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:26,175
I don't know where Sweetback is.
I don't know where he is..
I haven't seen Sweetback!

225
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,001
Come on boy..
- Sweetback!!!

226
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:31,458
You only got one good ear left, boy,
D'you want to save it?

227
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,392
D'you want to talk?

228
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:43,227
This guy is tough! Both ears are gone..
.. and he still won't talk!

229
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:46,672
Oh, Jesus!

230
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,804
Oh save him, Lord.
Save my brother!

231
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:15,826
Oh, Lord!

232
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,466
Oh, Jesus!

233
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,828
Take him into glory, Lord.
You know his heart..

234
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:40,710
Oh, Jesus!

235
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,182
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, I hope you know..
-Such a good Lord!

236
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,609
Yes, Lord!

237
00:35:56,347 --> 00:35:57,624
Black misery!

238
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:18,183
Jesus! Save him Lord!
You know his heart!

239
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:23,260
You know his heart!
You know my brother's heart, Lord. Save him!

240
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:27,664
Jesus!

241
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:33,631
Brothers and sisters, one of us..
brothers and sisters,

242
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:38,868
we're here 'cause one of our brothers

243
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:41,871
is in that box.

244
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,790
But he's not dead.

245
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:48,210
He's alive and with us!

246
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:53,382
We can't see him but we know he's here...

247
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,055
I'm glad to tell you today...

248
00:36:58,366 --> 00:37:00,852
that though he may be in that box,

249
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:03,783
he's gonna be in heaven with us.

250
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,929
I can see him now!

251
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:11,458
Good God Almighty,
that's our man!

252
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:15,293
Yes, my children, he is dead.

253
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,200
.. but he is not dead,
He is with us here today.

254
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:25,046
Our brother died here today of an overdose,

255
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:30,189
An overdose of black misery!

256
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:35,992
Yes, Lord!

257
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:46,359
We'll bow our head in prayer.

258
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:04,715
What are you doing here, Sweetback?
They're looking for you.

259
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,232
You're as hot as little sister's twat!

260
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:13,418
Where you goin'?

261
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:16,862
I don't want you to cover for me...
I'm goin' upstairs to the farm.

262
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:19,920
To the farm? You can't hide there!

263
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:12,795
You can't hide there.
They know all about the farm,

264
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:18,269
And not only yesterday, the unwed mothers...
the girls I get you from upstairs.

265
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,143
The Man knows about.. everything!

266
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,492
Ain't it strange when we die,

267
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:30,606
Our folks like to rejoice --

268
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,390
But when it comes to the living,

269
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:38,821
.. that's it!

270
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:43,136
The hype I'm layin' down for them
people inside, it ain't dangerous.

271
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:47,148
I'm just selling them a little bit o' happiness.
You know.. from the Happy Land!

272
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:50,015
We all are gonna die,

273
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:55,697
so all I want 'em to have is
some peace.

274
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:58,348
It's my job, to make
them believe that

275
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,525
they're going to get it better
on the other side.

276
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:03,980
It's my job!

277
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:08,227
Moo-Moo, the boy you saved,
and those other kids,

278
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:12,247
they're layin' down the real
religion. They've got it!

279
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:18,627
You offer pretty good news to me,
slappin' up on some white cops!

280
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:22,976
Ha-ha-ha-ha..
Yes, indeed!

281
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:29,753
I'm gonna say a black Ave Maria
for you.

282
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,265
Like the kids say,
"Later for waiting."

283
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,244
You saved a plant..

284
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:40,593
that they were planning to
pick in the bud!

285
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:44,749
That's why the Man's down on you.

286
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,477
That's why the Man's down on you!

287
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:51,881
I'm still gonna say..

288
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,375
.. a black Ave Maria for you!

289
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:01,217
Right, on we go on
KGFJ Soul Radio with 'Sandra Z',

290
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:04,117
the newest hit by "Earth, Wind and Fire".

291
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:36,756
What does a dead man need bread for?

292
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:39,528
So they was whipping a brother!

293
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:42,042
How many brothers
have you whipped?

294
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,574
How many sisters
have you slipped?

295
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:46,856
Life is tough, baby.

296
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:51,424
A real struggle,
from the womb to the tomb.

297
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,878
Every dollar we make,

298
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:58,859
the guineas get 20. The pol-ice
get 40 and Goldberg gets 50.

299
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,960
Anybody can tell you that
don't add up to a dollar.

300
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,459
That adds up to a dollar and a dime!

301
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,689
That's why all of us niggers
is so far behind.

302
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,525
And Africa shall stretch forth her arms!

303
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:13,068
Yeah, and bring back a bloody stump!

304
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:15,282
Viva Puerto Rico Libre!

305
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,266
I haven't forgotten you staked me.
Sweetback, if I had the dough..

306
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:25,481
I would lay it on you,
but I don't have it.

307
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:32,947
I wouldn't shuffle or shit you, baby.
I wouldn't do it for nothing.

308
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:37,854
You can't get out of this town
on wings, wheels or steel.

309
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:40,779
I wouldn't shuffle or shit you, brother.

310
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:42,161
Like I said,

311
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,876
what does a dead man
need bread for?

312
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:49,238
Albuquerque, Wichita Falls - Ramp 7.
San Diego..

313
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:52,222
Just like the railroad station, boss.
Full of pigs!

314
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,486
I'm Moo-Moo, brothers!

315
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,352
You the guy who got my buddy
in all this trouble?!
- Yeah!

316
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:41,995
Where you brothers goin'?

317
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:36,673
This is the best that I can
do for you on such a short notice.

318
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:46,342
Buy yourself a last supper...
You're a dead man!

319
00:45:43,148 --> 00:45:45,584
What have we here?

320
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,268
Well, looks like we have a
couple of, uh

321
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:53,898
private trespasses, and you
just trespassed on private property.

322
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,588
And that's a no no!

323
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,131
Let's stomp 'em, man.
- Stomp 'em!

324
00:46:00,116 --> 00:46:01,750
They got to pay, man, they got to pay!

325
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,791
Give 'em a chance, man,
this is a democracy!

326
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:08,773
Look it!

327
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:12,027
Look at this, look what
he brought me!

328
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:16,020
Payment number one!
- He's go the goods.
- Let me kick his fucking ass!

329
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:21,303
No, no. Naw, you ought to save him.
Save him for something even heavier than you.

330
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:23,962
For what?
- Something sporty.
- Like what?

331
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:25,947
Well, how about a duel?

332
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,627
A duel?
- A duel?

333
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:28,773
Sounds out of sight to me!

334
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:31,434
Yeah, like the good old days.
- The good old days!

335
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,340
Me! Me and hairnet!
- No, no, no.

336
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:40,339
Got to throw him back!
He's too little!
That's the one!
- Yeah, right on!

337
00:46:40,474 --> 00:46:44,005
I think we should have a good..
something.. we could really lay on something good.

338
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,747
All right! The Prez!

339
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:49,979
Yeah. The Prez!

340
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:52,979
The Prez.. that'll be good!

341
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,447
Yeah, when the Prez comes back.
Yeah, you're gonna get it!

342
00:46:58,574 --> 00:47:02,943
The Prez gonna come for you.
That's when you and the Prez are gonna.. shw-shw.. duel!
Right on!

343
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:10,718
Hey Prez!
Hey Prez, get over here!

344
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:18,583
Hey Prez, have we
got news for you!

345
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,825
Have we got work for you..

346
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:26,703
We gotta guy here for you to duel.

347
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:31,978
Your fight, man...

348
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:37,795
What's it gonna be?..

349
00:47:39,932 --> 00:47:41,227
Wrestlin'??

350
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:01,157
Hey, how about knives?
- ha ha ha!

351
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:06,273
Yo baby.
No!

352
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,422
Come on man, your choice.
What's it gonna' be?

353
00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:17,389
Huh? What's it gonna be, man?

354
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,831
Come on, man. Come on, baby,
What's it gonna be?

355
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:27,058
Huh? What's it gonna be?
It's your choice, baby!

356
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:38,210
Fucking!

357
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:48,474
Shut up!

358
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,315
Well?

359
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:57,327
Bet Sambo's so scared he
can't even get it on.

360
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:02,316
After the Prez does you in,
then we'll do you in!

361
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,168
Ball him in the bad health, Prez.

362
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:15,172
Do it to him, Prez.
.. get it on!

363
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,860
Get it, Prez. Get it!

364
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,459
Ooo--oooh!
Sweetback!

365
00:52:35,513 --> 00:52:42,453
Ooh-ooah! Oooooah, Sweetback!
Yeah, Sweetback!

366
00:52:43,706 --> 00:52:50,933
Ooah! Oaaah, Sweetback!
hehe-he.

367
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,643
Shit.

368
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,457
You'll be cool here.

369
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:53,863
We'll fix you up with help in the morning.
- Nobody'll bother you here...

370
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,001
Have a good time...
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here..

371
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,408
Come on... hahaha yeah.

372
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:04,639
No danger here.

373
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:13,905
Did they get 'em on the phone?
- Yeah.. How long will it take?

374
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:09,042
Big Sadie, the Prez, heard her guys planning
this cross...

375
00:58:09,293 --> 00:58:11,169
so she called us.

376
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:29,938
Look here, I can only take one of you...
I won't get ten feet with
three people on this bike...

377
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:34,985
Now, they told me to pick up Sweetback
... You Sweetback, ain't you?

378
00:58:38,363 --> 00:58:40,324
Take him.

379
00:58:40,824 --> 00:58:42,784
You know what you're doin', man?

380
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:47,723
He's our future, Br'er.
Take him.

381
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:18,784
Take these straps here.

382
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:23,810
Sweetback ...

383
01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:06,109
Come on feet!

384
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,328
Cruise for me!

385
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:11,623
Trouble ain't no place to be!

386
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,334
Come on feet!

387
01:00:14,876 --> 01:00:16,003
Do your thing!

388
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:24,903
Come on feet!

389
01:00:25,223 --> 01:00:26,423
Do your thing!

390
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:29,516
You all know Whitey's game!

391
01:00:31,112 --> 01:00:33,761
Come on legs!
Come on, run!

392
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:44,242
Come on legs!
Come on, run!

393
01:00:45,282 --> 01:00:47,701
Guilty's what he say you done!

394
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:52,205
Come on knees!
Don't be mean!

395
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:02,318
Come on knees!
Don't be mean!

396
01:01:03,508 --> 01:01:05,969
Ain't first red you ever seen

397
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:09,672
Come on feet!
Do your thing!

398
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:20,067
Come on baby!
Don't cop out on me!

399
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,404
Come on baby!
Don't give in on me!

400
01:01:27,412 --> 01:01:30,130
Come on feet!
Cruise for me!

401
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,577
Come on legs!
Come on, run!

402
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:40,519
Come on feet!
Do your thing!

403
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,514
Who put the bad mouth on me?

404
01:01:52,262 --> 01:01:55,133
Anyway the way I pick em up

405
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:58,855
And put em down
Even if it got it

406
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,192
Got my name on it.

407
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,903
Won't catch me now.

408
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:08,240
I want them!

409
01:02:08,615 --> 01:02:11,104
I want them, do you hear?
And I want them now!

410
01:02:11,552 --> 01:02:14,616
God, there could be
an uprising on our hands.

411
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:17,969
Cop killers and niggers to boot!

412
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:21,982
No patrol will be safe in their area..

413
01:02:23,045 --> 01:02:23,862
That's all.

414
01:02:29,919 --> 01:02:32,940
Hey, Rossie, Bill, just a minute...

415
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:39,155
Ah, look, you guys, I didn't mean any
offense by, aah, uh, by that word I used.

416
01:02:40,011 --> 01:02:44,810
It was just a... it's a figure of
speaking, you understand?

417
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,702
You know you guys could be a
real credit to your people,

418
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:51,440
if you brought those guys in.
Okay?

419
01:03:04,892 --> 01:03:06,943
Bet I broke the Olympic 220

420
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:08,851
Or cross country..

421
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:11,762
Or something!

422
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:15,429
Sure is lonely

423
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,913
Sure most quietest turf I ever seen

424
01:03:21,002 --> 01:03:23,440
What happened to the sun?

425
01:03:24,445 --> 01:03:26,124
Sure gone away

426
01:03:27,962 --> 01:03:30,631
Sure blacker than a landlord's soul!

427
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:33,240
Must have run all day!

428
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,292
Yeah, must have run all day!

429
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,548
Sure am a bitch..
Must have run all day!

430
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,748
Sure yeah!

431
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:45,604
Yeah baby!

432
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:49,011
Come on feet!

433
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:51,734
Cruise for me!

434
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,328
Come on feet!

435
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,589
Come on run!

436
01:03:56,704 --> 01:03:57,637
Come on legs!

437
01:03:58,941 --> 01:04:00,474
Come on run!

438
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,695
Come on feet!

439
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:04,776
Do your thing!

440
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:06,946
Come on feet!

441
01:04:07,069 --> 01:04:08,469
Do your thing!

442
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,933
That's not him!

443
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:46,778
So what?

444
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:48,693
Come on feet!

445
01:04:49,322 --> 01:04:50,763
Cruise for me!

446
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:53,030
Come on feet!

447
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:55,414
Come on, run!

448
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:57,508
Come on legs!

449
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,306
Come on, run!

450
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:02,066
Come on feet!

451
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:04,107
Do your thing!

452
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:06,483
Come on feet!

453
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,102
Do your thing!

454
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:45,936
Bingo, we got him!

455
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:50,067
If things change,

456
01:05:50,522 --> 01:05:53,784
the majority of people will
decide where and when.

457
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:56,665
This is a democracy, it's not communism.

458
01:05:57,373 --> 01:06:01,344
And we're all going to respect
the law or pay the consequences.

459
01:06:11,283 --> 01:06:13,759
As a citizen, you are required by law

460
01:06:13,879 --> 01:06:16,138
to aid us in this identification...

461
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:19,336
Is this Sweetback's body?

462
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,240
I ain't learned to read lips yet.

463
01:06:26,804 --> 01:06:30,575
He lost his hearing.
He ain't able to read lips yet.

464
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:03,219
I told you one time I ain't seen Sweetback...

465
01:08:03,403 --> 01:08:07,148
Never heard of him.
What else did he go by?

466
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:14,544
I'm positive I've never seen him...

467
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:22,894
Huh, yeah? Thank you.

468
01:08:37,256 --> 01:08:38,645
I've been looking for him myself.

469
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,117
I don't know nothing about no Sweetback!

470
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:56,966
I ain't saw Sweetback!

471
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,938
I haven't seen him.

472
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,315
I just keep kids for the county

473
01:09:24,905 --> 01:09:27,605
and make these things for the old people...

474
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,957
Like this. Isn't that pretty?

475
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:35,921
Ain't they pretty?

476
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,199
But when the kids get so grown
and so bad..

477
01:09:39,988 --> 01:09:41,841
it takes them away from me...

478
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,959
I might have had a Leroy once,
but I don't rightly remember.

479
01:09:47,153 --> 01:09:49,153
They get so bad and so grown...

480
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:53,106
I might have had a Leroy once,
but I don't rightly remember.

481
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,650
Make these things for older people
and these kids for the county.

482
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,498
It jes takes 'em away from me.

483
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:04,257
I might have had a Leroy once,
but I can't rightly remember.

484
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:09,818
And when the kids get bad and older,
they usually take them away from me.

485
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,963
I might have had a Leroy,

486
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:13,819
but I don't rightly remember.

487
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:18,338
When the kids get older and bad,
they usually take them away from me,

488
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:20,025
I might have had a Leroy,

489
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:24,996
When the kids get older and bad,
they usually take them away from me.

490
01:10:25,379 --> 01:10:26,779
jest takes 'em away from me.

491
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:30,413
I might have had a Leroy,
but I can't rightly remember.

492
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:47,748
Fuck!

493
01:10:58,763 --> 01:11:04,695
No! Other people I don't give a damn about...
I don't know nobody but my own Goddamn self...

494
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,899
No, I haven't seen Sweetback.

495
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:23,529
I haven't seen him in a long time...
Look, I don't, I don't see the cat.

496
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:29,702
If I never see him, it won't be
too soon for me, you understand?
You understand, man?...

497
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:33,289
I haven't seen the cat and I don't want to see him.

498
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,250
You just keep leaning and leaning and leaning,

499
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,794
Get the fuck off o' my back, man!

500
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:44,341
I'm, I'm clean, man. Look. I'm clean.
There's nothing there! Look, look!

501
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,927
When I get pissed off, man,

502
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:51,260
I will throw a natural-born
nigger fit on you, understand?

503
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:55,202
So why don't you leave? Why don't you leave?

504
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,490
I am clean!

505
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,702
Look... nothing, nothing!
No place, man. I'm clean!

506
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,574
So stop leaning on me.
I ain't on the street no more, understand?

507
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,410
I ain't in the trade no more.

508
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,831
I just want to be left alone, baby.
So, don't push me!

509
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:19,465
You're pushing my button, baby!
You're pushing my button!

510
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:24,423
Leave! Split!
Leave, motherfucker!

511
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:32,267
Sweetback, man, shit!

512
01:12:48,428 --> 01:12:55,543
/I love you,
I love you-oooo-uuu,
I lovvvve you!/

513
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,254
Fuck the reporters!

514
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,215
I know they're out there!

515
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,175
Now look..

516
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,803
This guy's got one chance!

517
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,305
Right here!

518
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,767
Now let's get him!

519
01:13:30,226 --> 01:13:31,966
No, no, I haven't seen him.

520
01:13:33,966 --> 01:13:35,072
Sweetback??

521
01:13:35,173 --> 01:13:37,651
Never heard of him.
I haven't, I haven't seen him.

522
01:13:37,686 --> 01:13:41,358
Getting by, that's my main concern.
Thank you, but I haven't seen him.

523
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,314
I haven't seen him.

524
01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:13,783
/ They bled your Mama /

525
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,078
/ They bled your Papa /

526
01:14:17,488 --> 01:14:18,954
But they won't bleed me!

527
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,165
Niggers scared and pretend they don't see..

528
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,584
Just like you Sweetback!

529
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,294
Just like I used to be!

530
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,798
Work your black behind to the gums,

531
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,309
And you supposed to Thomas til he done.

532
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:35,221
You got to Thomas, Sweetback!

533
01:14:36,879 --> 01:14:39,382
/ They bled your brother /

534
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:43,670
/ They bled your sister /

535
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,898
But he won't bleed me!

536
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,017
All right, now why'd you run?

537
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,203
Why'd I run?
- Uh huh.

538
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:43,641
I ran cause I gave my word I'd run.
- Gave what word?

539
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:45,909
I promised ... to run.

540
01:16:46,373 --> 01:16:47,937
You promised who? What?

541
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:51,440
This guy gave me five dollars
to change duds with him...

542
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,610
Told me if anybody come after me
just, uh, keep on running.

543
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,471
Was he a black guy?

544
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,743
Yeah, he's colored.
- What'd he look like?

545
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:06,664
Like a buddy I used to pal around with
back in Denver.

546
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:10,543
Now would you say he was about this tall?
Around this size?

547
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,754
Yeah, about like that.

548
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,383
What was he doing?
- Poorly.

549
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,136
You mean how he was doin'.

550
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,443
... Yeah, poorly.

551
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:39,540
Progress, Sweetback!
- That's what He wants you to believe.

552
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,254
No!
Progress, Sweetback!

553
01:17:42,289 --> 01:17:46,337
He ain't stopped clubbing us for 400 years,
And he don't intend to for a million!

554
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,450
He sure treat us bad, Sweetback!

555
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,224
We can make him do us better!

556
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,541
Chicken ain't nothing but a bird,

557
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:57,784
White man ain't nothing but a turd!
Nigger ain't shit.

558
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:00,092
/ God's gonna trouble the water /

559
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,304
/ Wade in the water /

560
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:07,308
/ Wade in the water, children /

561
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,477
Get my hand on a trigger!

562
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:11,437
You talking revolution, Sweetback!

563
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:16,560
I want to get off these knees!
- You talking revolution, Sweetback!

564
01:18:16,595 --> 01:18:17,860
Somebody listen to me!!

565
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:21,530
If he can't burn you out,
he'll stomp you out!

566
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,240
He won't waste me!

567
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:28,619
/ Let it shine, let it shine,
let it shine! /

568
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:13,082
/ He bopped your Mama /

569
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,129
/ He bopped your Papa /

570
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,549
But he won't waste me!

571
01:19:22,997 --> 01:19:25,497
You can't make it on wings,
wheels or steel, Sweetback.

572
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:27,256
We got feet!

573
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,142
You can't get away on wings,
wheels or steel, Sweetback.

574
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,269
Nigger's got feet!

575
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,150
/ They bled your brother /

576
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:43,237
/ They bled your sister /

577
01:19:58,169 --> 01:20:00,254
Your brother and your sister too...

578
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:05,009
How come it took me so long to see...

579
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,553
How he gets us to use each other...

580
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,138
Nigger's scared.

581
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,727
We got to get it together...

582
01:20:11,236 --> 01:20:14,451
If he kick a brother...
it gotta be like he's kicking your mother!

583
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:20,107
/ He got your brother /

584
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:24,195
Don't let him get you!

585
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:27,531
Haul your black ass, Sweetback!

586
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,082
He ain't gonna let you stand tall, Sweetback!

587
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,379
The Man knows everything, Sweetback!

588
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:44,011
The Man knows everything!

589
01:20:44,441 --> 01:20:47,147
Then he oughta know -
I'm tired of him fucking with me!

590
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:50,289
Right on, brother!
Right on, brother!

591
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:03,943
Run, Sweetback!

592
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,822
Run, motherfucker!

593
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:12,743
/ They bled your sister /
- They won't bleed me!

594
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,205
Run, Sweetback!
Run, motherfucker!

595
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,607
No child, I mean, officer..

596
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:03,680
I didn't see a Mr. Sweetback.

597
01:23:04,497 --> 01:23:06,687
If you see him, send him here!

598
01:23:07,403 --> 01:23:08,962
I'm a militant queen!

599
01:23:09,052 --> 01:23:11,157
Won't I do, officer?

600
01:24:29,386 --> 01:24:33,846
"Anybody can tell you that don't add up to a dollar,
that adds up to a dollar and a dime!"

601
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:39,158
"Come on, stand up straight... what's the matter with you?"

602
01:24:41,711 --> 01:24:44,288
"Buy yourself a last supper, you're a dead man!"

603
01:24:46,941 --> 01:24:49,418
"Your fight, man. What's it gonna be?"

604
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,362
"Your choice, baby!"

605
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:13,836
/ They bled my sister /

606
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:18,215
/ They bled my brother /

607
01:26:54,318 --> 01:26:56,712
I swear I saw Sweetback.
- Where?

608
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:35,180
You saw him?
- Over there in that clump of bushes.

609
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:36,593
You sure it's him?

610
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:39,153
If it ain't Sweetback,
why'd he go in the wrong direction?

611
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:49,265
No wonder he was goin' the wrong way!

612
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,134
Hey!

613
01:31:07,714 --> 01:31:09,782
He's heading for the border!

614
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:20,524
He's going to get there before we do!

615
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,827
He's gonna get across the border
before we can catch him!

616
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:47,778
He's gonna get there before we do!

617
01:31:47,823 --> 01:31:49,678
Goddamn dogs!

618
01:31:51,883 --> 01:31:54,427
Dogs movin' faster than we are!

619
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:56,760
Just let me draw a bead on his black ass..

620
01:31:57,447 --> 01:31:59,098
.. and he's dead!

621
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:02,935
He's further ahead than that!

622
01:32:05,688 --> 01:32:08,733
Just one Goddamn glimpse of
his black ass and he's dead!

623
01:32:10,802 --> 01:32:11,578
He's gonna make it!

624
01:32:11,684 --> 01:32:13,604
Let the dogs go!
- No, I won't do it!

625
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:16,173
Let the dogs go!
I can't do it. I won't!

626
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:18,908
Goddamn it.
They'll tear him apart! I don't give 2 fucks..

627
01:32:19,178 --> 01:32:20,928
Do it!
- I can't let them do it!

628
01:32:21,085 --> 01:32:22,981
They've got four legs, we only got two!
- I won't do it!

629
01:32:23,152 --> 01:32:24,433
They'll tear him apart!

630
01:32:34,117 --> 01:32:36,218
Let the dogs go!
- I won't do it!

631
01:32:36,223 --> 01:32:38,623
Turn loose of those dogs!

632
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:51,442
Sorry..

633
01:32:52,263 --> 01:32:54,755
No hard feelings, I just had to catch him.

634
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:56,483
Well, what's done is done.

635
01:32:56,941 --> 01:32:59,449
I guess it'll save the taxpayers some money.

636
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:04,940
Listen.

637
01:33:06,155 --> 01:33:08,507
No barking.
- Yep.

638
01:33:09,741 --> 01:33:12,309
Well, I guess there's no sense of
you hanging around here, Rinny.

639
01:33:13,465 --> 01:33:14,906
No use in you missing the fun, Rinny.

640
01:33:15,771 --> 01:33:17,946
You go get in on it. Go on, boy...
