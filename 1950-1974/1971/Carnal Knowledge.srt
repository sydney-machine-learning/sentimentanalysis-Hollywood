1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,570
If you had a choice, -

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,898
- would you rather love a girl,
or have her love you?

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,412
- I want it mutual.
- If you couldn't have that.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,932
Would I rather be the one who loves,
or is loved?

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,895
It's not an easy question.
I think I'd rather be in love.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,777
Me, too.
I wouldn't want to get hurt, though.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,737
- You were in love with Gloria.
- I was starting to be.

8
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,456
Then she let me feel her up on the
first date. Turned me right off.

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,778
- You kept going with her.
- Well, she let me feel her up.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,412
- What about Gwen?
- Her I could talk to.

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,650
- I never could talk to any girl.
- I was getting crazy about her.

12
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,011
But she wouldn't let me
lay a hand on her.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,010
- So I went back to Gloria.
- You want perfection.

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,294
- What do you want?
- She just has to be nice.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,016
- Not beautiful?
- She doesn't have to be.

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,099
- I'd like her built, though.
- I want mine sexy.

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,057
- She shouldn't look like a tramp.
- Sexy doesn't mean like a tramp.

18
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,458
- There's a middle ground.
- I would want that.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,815
Tall, very tall...

20
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,977
That would scare me.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,777
She should be very understanding.
Start the same sentences together.

22
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,259
- I'd like that.
- Big tits...

23
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,253
- Yeah, but still a virgin.
- I don't care about that.

24
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,375
I wouldn't mind if she was a little
ahead of me, with those big tits.

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,936
And knew hundreds of different ways.

26
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,289
I want a companion. The other stuff
I can get on the outside.

27
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,053
The first time I do it, I don't want
to waste it on some beast.

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,129
I feel about getting laid
the same way I feel about college.

29
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,491
I'm being pressured into it.

30
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,857
- You like that?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,009
I give her to you.
I'm a generous guy.

32
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,771
I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?

33
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,737
Go over there.
There's a way to talk to girls.

34
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,971
Tell her ajoke. Tell her about
your unhappy childhood.

35
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,890
- That's not bad.
- But don't make it like an act.

36
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,251
Go ahead.

37
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,739
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.

38
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,819
You can't even stand up.

39
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,973
- I fucked up.
- My turn.

40
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,810
- She's mine, you gave her to me.
- You struck out.

41
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,092
I get two more times at bat.

42
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,130
- This is my first college mixer.
- I hate them.

43
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,219
- It's so phony.
- Everybody puts on an act.

44
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,177
- You don't know who you meet.
- Because you're meeting the act.

45
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,578
- I'm not sure I agree.
- I don't either.

46
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,059
- You don't agree with yourself?
- How do you feel about it?

47
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,139
People like to think they put on
an act, but it's really them.

48
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,654
- They think they can change it.
- They're kidding themselves?

49
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,650
- It is an act, but the act is them.
- Then how can it be an act?

50
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,014
- Because they're an act.
- They're also real. So I'm not real?

51
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,850
- I'm an act?
- It's all right, so am I.

52
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,178
Don't you behave differently
with different people?

53
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,413
- With your family?
- I thought you meant people.

54
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,092
- Sure, with my family...
- And with friends, another way.

55
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,296
And with your teachers, still
another way. So which one is you?

56
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,975
- You ought to be a lawyer.
- I'm gonna be a lawyer.

57
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,138
A lady lawyer.

58
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,499
You're from Smith, right?

59
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,376
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. Do you like Amherst?

60
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,938
Sure. My parents worked very hard
to send me.

61
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,811
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name?

62
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,410
- Susan.
- I'm Sandy.

63
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,292
I think you can make out with her.
She's stuff.

64
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,290
- You think so?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

65
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,891
- Shouldn't I try somebody else?
- Who?

66
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,136
She was the best-looking girl
at the mixer. Wasn't she?

67
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,131
- Her tits were too small.
- Yeah. The hell with her.

68
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,813
- But her legs were great.
- I was standing too close.

69
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,057
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

70
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,574
- She's got funny ideas.
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

71
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,296
- Don't rush me.
- What is it? I like you very much.

72
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:03,413
It's our third date.
You let me kiss you last week.

73
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:10,331
If I could kiss you once last week,
I should kiss you twice tonight.

74
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,013
- You're the only boy I can talk to.
- I can't see you being quiet.

75
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,769
If somebody doesn't approve
of what you are...

76
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,258
- Whatever that is.
- You just don't tell him.

77
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,339
If I want a boy to like me,
and I'm brighter than him, -

78
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,930
- I can't show it or I'll lose him.

79
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,578
- I don't want anyone overly bright.
- You wouldn't feel threatened.

80
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,173
Not nearly as much as some people.
I want to write novels.

81
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,852
Later, when I have something to say.
Does that threaten you?

82
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,858
No.

83
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,893
Maybe a little.

84
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,053
Don't press so hard.

85
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,130
It's better when it's gentle.

86
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,779
See?

87
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,172
What are you grinning at?

88
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,338
- Did you feel her up yet?
- I don't want to ruin things.

89
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,135
Was I right about kissing her?

90
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,332
- You won?
- I don't know.

91
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,819
- You let yourself be pushed around.
- You're pushing me around.

92
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,649
I guess I won,
she kissed me five times.

93
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,296
That's when you should've put
your hand on her tit.

94
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,211
- I should do <i>that</i> to her?
- She's not doing you a favor.

95
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,329
When a girl lets you kiss her,
and feel her up...

96
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,498
Go all the way
and all the rest of it...

97
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,696
Isn't it a favor? What's in it
for her? She's not getting paid.

98
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,139
Fuck you.

99
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,938
Okay, I'll feel her up.

100
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,773
Please take your hand off my breast.
I want you to.

101
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,816
- It can't be fun if I don't want it.
- I didn't say it was fun.

102
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,777
- Then why is your hand there?
- I should be feeling you up by now.

103
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,898
I don't feel that way about you.

104
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,654
I feel that way about you.

105
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,219
Don't you want me to feel something
for you, too?

106
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,699
I do like you, but for other reasons.

107
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,374
If we went any further,
there wouldn't be those reasons.

108
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,971
- We might have something else.
- What?

109
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,297
Something else.

110
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,651
You're the first girl
I've ever done that to.

111
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,371
- I didn't know that.
- It doesn't show?

112
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,133
It's something
we both have to go through.

113
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,894
Susan, are you a virgin?

114
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,893
What do I do with my other hand?

115
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,779
What are you gonna do
with your hands?

116
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,971
Then she told me to take my hand off
her breast. I said I didn't want to.

117
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,650
She said how could it be fun for me
if she didn't like it?

118
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,253
I said I thought she liked me.
She said, "for other reasons."

119
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,773
I told her I really needed this.
That it was my first time.

120
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,893
- What did you say exactly?
- I don't remember exactly.

121
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,615
That she was the first girl
I ever tried to feel up.

122
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,577
Was that a mistake?
Then she got nicer to me.

123
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,296
- She put my hand on her breast.
- You mean she left it on.

124
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,177
- She picked it up and put it on.
- She took your hand?

125
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,410
- And put it on like this?
- Yes. I didn't know what to think.

126
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,898
Suddenly she gets pretty aggressive.

127
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,412
Then I asked if she was a virgin.
Was that a mistake?

128
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,010
- Anyhow, she is.
- <i>She</i> says.

129
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,610
So you got one or two hands
on her tits?

130
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,133
- She put the other hand on the other.
- Two hands?

131
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,460
I said, "What are you gonna do
with your hands?"

132
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,974
- Then what?
- She unzipped my fly.

133
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,971
- Bullshit artist! Then what?
- Then she did it.

134
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,411
Did what?

135
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,933
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?

136
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,013
Is this Susan?

137
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,974
I'm a friend of Sandy's.
His roommate.

138
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,935
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?

139
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,578
I'm here at Smith just for tonight,
practically on campus.

140
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,934
I was just taking a drive and I
found myself practically on campus.

141
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,380
Do you like Smith?

142
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,619
- Where did you go to high school?
- What do you do in the summer?

143
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,778
You always answer with a question?

144
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,699
You always date
your best friend's girl?

145
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,973
- Sandy told me you were beautiful.
- He told me you were sexy.

146
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,972
- I guess he's a poorjudge.
- He meant you had personality.

147
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,016
- You have a special quality.
- I'm hardly that special.

148
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,978
Most girls I talk to it's like we're
spies from foreign countries, -

149
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,889
- speaking in code.
Everything means something else.

150
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,298
I say, "How about a walk?"
And it means something else.

151
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,051
"No, I've got a French test tomorrow."
And it means something else.

152
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,013
And you say, "I'll help you study."

153
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,897
You're sharp, I like that.
You're too sharp.

154
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,891
- Does that bother you?
- It interests me.

155
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,139
- We'd be good together.
- I'm dating your best friend.

156
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:30,256
- He won't mind. I won't tell him.
- What if I mind?

157
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,332
- Want to go out Friday?
- I'm seeing Sandy.

158
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,657
- Saturday?
- I have a date.

159
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,330
- Sunday?
- I'm seeing my folks.

160
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,338
- Where do they live?
- Newton.

161
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,773
- Sunday night?
- I'll be too tired.

162
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,177
I'll help you get over your folks.

163
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,535
- What are you so afraid of?
- Not you.

164
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,815
I think I'm in love.

165
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,968
- Bullshit artist.
- I really think so.

166
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,054
- Did you get in yet?
- What's that got to do with it?

167
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:40,416
How do you know if you don't know
how you are in bed together?

168
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,136
She tells me thoughts
I didn't even know I had.

169
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,413
- I can talk to her.
- You can talk to me.

170
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,853
I can say things to her
I wouldn't dare say to you.

171
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,975
- Things you'd laugh at.
- I'm laughing now.

172
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,972
She thinks I'm sensitive.

173
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,298
Sensitive? Oh, boy!

174
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,174
- Do you talk about flowers?
- Books.

175
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,688
- I read more books than you do.
- I'm gonna start.

176
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,495
- I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
- What's that?

177
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,171
Her favorite book.
Ever hear of "Jean Christophe"?

178
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,455
It's a classic, you moron.
I'll read it after "The Fountainhead."

179
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,179
Ever read "Guadalcanal Diary"
by Richard Tregaskis? I read it.

180
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,252
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"?
Or "A Bell For Adano"?

181
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,818
- I'm gonna read everything.
- I read more than you.

182
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,774
So who's sensitive?

183
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,688
- I've had a messed-up childhood.
- What does your father do?

184
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,373
- He fails. It's not funny.
- I'm sorry. Were you very poor?

185
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,529
My father couldn't hold on to ajob.
He kept giving me advice.

186
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,656
The more he failed, the more advice.
He's a Communist.

187
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,457
We're Republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a Communist.

188
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,735
Me, too. We have so much,
and other people have so little.

189
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,298
After I get set up as a lawyer,
I really want to go into politics.

190
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,416
Public service. It gets me that
I was too young to fight in the war.

191
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,772
That was all about proving that,
if everybody pitches in, -

192
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,858
- plain people have a chance.

193
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,850
So although I'm the first in my family
to get an education, -

194
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,133
- I don't ever want to
forget where I came from.

195
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,419
- You're more serious than I thought.
- I know.

196
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,855
I'm another person with her.
The things I say...

197
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,088
- Boy! Is she built?
- She has... a quality.

198
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,373
She doesn't talk much,
but the things she says are sharp.

199
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,292
We should double-date.

200
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,211
I want to know her better
before we double-date.

201
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,574
Isn't it great? A month ago,
neither of us even knew a girl.

202
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,056
- What's her name?
- Myrtle.

203
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,570
Bullshit artist!

204
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,810
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!

205
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,778
- Next it's my turn.
- I don't think she'll do it.

206
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,417
- Sandy, find somebody else.
- Are you crazy? I'm on the verge.

207
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,771
I'll see her tomorrow night.

208
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,615
Sandy?
Do you ever talk to her about me?

209
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,129
Sometimes.

210
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,856
Do me a favor.
Don't tell her I got laid.

211
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,818
Please, Susan.

212
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,174
Sometimes I want to do it,
and then I don't.

213
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,329
I don't know why you put up with me.

214
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,936
- I don't think I can do it.
- It really hurts, Susan.

215
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,498
- Let me.
- Not anymore.

216
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,692
Susan, let's do it.

217
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,618
I love you.

218
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,889
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?

219
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,969
- Not a year or anything?
- I'm sure it's okay.

220
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,420
- I'm not taking any chances.
- These have to be okay.

221
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,495
It's okay.

222
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,129
I'm positive it's okay.

223
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,130
- You're not the first to get laid.
- It's <i>my</i> first time.

224
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,936
I don't crow about it.
There's such a thing as good taste.

225
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,770
After you started scoring,
what did I get out of you?

226
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,498
"We did it standing, sitting,
in the car, under the car. Myrtle..."

227
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,172
I knew Susan before you knew
Myrtle. But you scored first.

228
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:20,410
It made me very jealous.
But I didn't try to shut you up.

229
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,331
- I'm your friend, I sat through it.
- Okay, you made your point.

230
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,452
I'm a better friend to you
than you are to me.

231
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,579
Didn't you ever do that?

232
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,570
Of course,
I knew what "misled" meant.

233
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,615
But when I saw it,
I thought it was "myzeled"!

234
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,856
I kept wondering what it meant.

235
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,136
Anybody ever heard of
"Round John Virgin"?

236
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,858
- Little John!
- What did you say?

237
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:24,693
- Round John Virgin.
- Round yon virgin mother and child.

238
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,574
All right: Gunshee.
G-u-n-s-h-y.

239
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,733
Susan, do the one about the bear.

240
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,094
The hymn we used to sing
about the bear with crossed eyes?

241
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,895
Whose name was Gladly.
Don't you know it?

242
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,651
Gladly the cross I'd bear.

243
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,250
Oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear!

244
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,530
Pronounce this:
C-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.

245
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,334
Chophus...

246
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,539
Chop house.

247
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,816
- This has to stop.
- I don't know how to tell him.

248
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,491
- You tell him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?

249
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,056
You never talk to me
the way you talk to him.

250
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,811
- What way?
- I don't know.

251
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,691
- I don't want to hurt him.
- You're hurting <i>me</i>.

252
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,652
- He loves me.
- That's no reason to sleep with him.

253
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,098
You would have just gone on
if he hadn't told me, wouldn't you?

254
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,010
- I would never have known.
- I don't know. Maybe.

255
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,090
- You're really something.
- I don't feel like something.

256
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,452
I feel like nothing.

257
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,690
How much longer
do you expect me to take this?

258
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,131
- I'm trying to tell him.
- I see how you're trying.

259
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,457
It's not my fault.

260
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,451
You're supposed to be in love
with me. I'm gonna tell him.

261
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,619
What? No, Jonathan!

262
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,577
- Try understanding me for once.
- You're stronger.

263
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,090
- You tell him everything else.
- Who says so?

264
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,373
He tells me, he's my best friend.

265
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,214
Are you going to tell him?

266
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,930
He's so helpless.

267
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,051
Susan, I love you.

268
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:35,573
Why can't you be more with me
like you are with Sandy?

269
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,290
She says she's no good for me.

270
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,609
Maybe she's trying
to let you down easy.

271
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,575
Go ahead and laugh. It adds up.

272
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,211
Go ahead and laugh.

273
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,331
You don't know every mood of mine
like you know his. How come?

274
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,977
You don't tell me thoughts
I never knew I had.

275
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,490
- You can do it with me.
- I can't.

276
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,010
You can do it with him,
you can do it with me.

277
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:24,614
- I can't with you.
- This has gone far enough.

278
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,779
- I can't stand any more ultimatums.
- Tell him tonight.

279
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,852
Or tomorrow I tell him. Look at me!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!

280
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,010
- You didn't do it, did you?
- No.

281
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,456
<i>- Why not?</i>
- He looks at me with such trust.

282
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,131
- <i>How do I look at you?</i>
- With bitterness.

283
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,972
<i>It used to be trust.</i>
<i>At least you know my thoughts.</i>

284
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,129
- Did you tell him?
- <i>What do you think?</i>

285
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,134
<i>What do we do now?</i>

286
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,657
- I guess I get an ultimatum.
<i>- Is there any sense in this?</i>

287
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,496
- In what?
- <i>In you and me.</i>

288
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,728
- That's up to you.
<i>- No, it's up to you</i>.

289
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,856
<i>I don't see any point in it.</i>
<i>I wish I were wrong.</i>

290
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,498
I don't feel anything anymore.

291
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,536
Neither do I.

292
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,376
The reason
I didn't say anything to Sandy...

293
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,858
...I knew he wouldn't believe me.

294
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,056
And I'd go into details.
I knew he'd come running to you, -

295
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,288
- you'd tell him it was all true,
and then you'd go to bed with him.

296
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,613
That sounds like what would happen.

297
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,452
- So?
- So?

298
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,296
Jonathan...

299
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:31,537
- I'll always be your friend.
- Jesus, Susan, I hope not.

300
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,053
It's going to be buggy.
It's the tropics, the jungle.

301
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,253
- Just cover yourself.
- I'll get eaten alive.

302
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,534
You've never camped out.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?

303
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,971
- You're a real city boy.
- How about the cot?

304
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,971
- We've got a sleeping bag.
- Are we sleeping on the ground?

305
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,652
- This knapsack's heavy.
- Why did you pack a pillowcase?

306
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:18,059
- Put it back.
- Isn't he a nut, Jonathan?

307
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,776
- Let me pack my things.
- I'm just trying to help...

308
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,736
- Jesus...
- Do you want her?

309
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,013
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Look at the pair on her.

310
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,498
- That schmuck's trying to keep up.
- They're always with those guys.

311
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,375
- He must be 60.
- He might have a heart attack.

312
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,176
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.

313
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,099
You bastard...

314
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,691
- How's Susan?
- Couldn't be better.

315
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,338
I always said it:
You found yourself ajewel.

316
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,016
- Not bad, that one.
- You get more than your share.

317
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:14,090
- I'd marry if I found the right girl.
- Bullshit. You and your actresses...

318
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,055
You got the deal, <i>Doctor</i>.
What can I say?

319
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,129
"Take your clothes off,
I wanna check your capital gains."

320
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,337
- I just look.
- Sure you do.

321
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,979
Susan is plenty enough woman
for one man. Look at that.

322
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,609
- That's Sally Joyce.
- I saw her on TV.

323
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,089
I fucked her once.
We used to do her taxes.

324
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,054
- She's with another firm now.
- Why not say hello?

325
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,209
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster.

326
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,857
I've been through the mill
with her kind.

327
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,417
You think a girl goes for you,
but it's your money or your balls...

328
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:15,014
<i>And</i> your balls. Women today
are better hung than the men.

329
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:29,697
- I should have your problems.
- It used to be easier to get laid.

330
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,337
I don't fuck more than a dozen
new girls a year now.

331
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:40,695
I may be too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close.

332
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,051
Good tits. Not great.

333
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:49,050
Almost no ass at all, and that
bothered me. Sensational legs.

334
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:55,210
I'd settle for the legs, if she had
two more inches here and three here.

335
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,892
- That took two years out of my life.
- You don't want a family?

336
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,536
Who needs it?

337
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,098
- Fucking can't be your life's work.
- Don't tell me what I can't do.

338
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,417
You're so well-off?

339
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,770
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.

340
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,575
I come home, everything is
in its place. I like that.

341
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,854
It's tiring, a full day at the office,
then the hospital for a few hours.

342
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:58,851
So it's nice when everything's in
its place. Martini, dinner, the kids.

343
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,690
We don't watch much TV.
We read aloud to each other.

344
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,371
We used to have more friends.

345
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:20,056
On weekends we might entertain
a little, or go to see a friend.

346
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,617
Come into town,
see a play or a good film.

347
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,935
It's not glamorous or anything.

348
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,528
There are other things than glamor.

349
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,335
- You have a long lifeline.
- I like that.

350
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,532
The way you run your nail
across my...

351
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:57,212
- You're difficult to get along with.
- Me? Bobbie...

352
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,859
- You always know your own mind.
- Right this minute, anyway.

353
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,330
You won't stop
until you get what you want.

354
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,097
Let me see your hand.

355
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,329
- Well?
- You are built.

356
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:30,853
- Do you see that in my hand?
- Even your hand is built.

357
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,975
- You're a dirty old man.
- I'm a dirty <i>young</i> man.

358
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,570
- How old are you?
- What do you think?

359
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,251
19... 20?

360
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,811
- 21? 22...
- No.

361
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,172
- 24.
- You skipped 23.

362
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,214
- 23?
- No.

363
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,015
24? 25?

364
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,939
- 26? 27?
- You're getting warm.

365
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,811
28? 29.

366
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,009
I like going out with older women.

367
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,732
Are you married?
You don't want to get married?

368
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,899
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?

369
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,490
- Spaghetti.
- I can cook spaghetti.

370
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,172
- Good, you do the cooking.
- What'll you do?

371
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,771
- What would you like me to do?
- What would you like to do?

372
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,451
- I asked you first.
- I'm not gonna answer.

373
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,653
- Well... I can sew.
- Not much of a marriage.

374
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:15,130
- Me cooking, you sewing.
- Wanna divorce? I'll take every cent.

375
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:19,777
I didn't know
I was marrying a gold-digger.

376
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,896
- You won't take pity on me?
- Only if you say you're sorry.

377
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:33,329
- I'm sorry.
- And you'll never do it again.

378
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,978
- And you'll always be a good boy.
- Yes, Mama.

379
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,097
- Do you like to be mothered?
- I like to be <i>smothered</i> by you.

380
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,895
What else
would you like me to do to you?

381
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,053
Well, how do you like it?

382
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:24,176
- How do I like what?
- My... you know.

383
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,217
- What do I know?
- You know everything.

384
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,170
- I know you.
- And I know you.

385
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,659
Well, I almost came that time.

386
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,896
- Nurse?
- What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?

387
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,651
- Come in here a minute, please.
- Certainly.

388
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,936
Why, Mr. Weisenborn!

389
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,857
Most guys I know are pricks.

390
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,177
I don't know what they want.

391
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:47,535
I'll tell you. They want the boodle.

392
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,699
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.

393
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,017
Because this kid here has got it.

394
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,499
You're pretty sure of yourself.

395
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,408
- You're a nice man.
- And you're a very lucky girl.

396
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:25,498
- You know something, Sam?
- What is it, sweetheart?

397
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,174
Would it be a mistake
if we shacked up?

398
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:46,170
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last weeks we got on so well.

399
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,015
The idea...

400
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,498
I like you very much.

401
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,488
So much that this idea...

402
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:14,616
To be perfectly honest,
it sounds very good to me.

403
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,898
Let's give it a couple of days
to think about it.

404
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:29,291
It sounds like... very good.

405
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,532
Very, very...

406
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,018
Good.

407
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,577
Only, our eyes should be open.

408
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:52,253
We should know exactly
what we're getting into.

409
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:56,578
I'm not asking you for marriage.

410
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:03,378
- As long as we both understand that.
- We do.

411
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,495
It's better to get it all
out on the table, -

412
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,091
- so later there can be
no misunderstanding.

413
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,736
Many business deals
have come to grief...

414
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,534
Okay...

415
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,052
You're a real prick, you know that?

416
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,650
Prick?

417
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,728
I could get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.

418
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:55,492
Just between the two of us, for
the last year, I've been having...

419
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:03,090
A little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still...

420
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:10,092
A little trouble with... myself.

421
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,536
...Getting hard.

422
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:27,815
It took a long time.
Girls today judge you very quickly.

423
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:34,812
So I had a real rough time
a couple of times.

424
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:42,415
Some very nasty innuendos.
As I say, I wasn't too worried...

425
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,733
I won't lie to you, I <i>was</i> worried.

426
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,011
Then along comes Bobbie.
One look at the pair on her -

427
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:02,774
- and I never doubted
that I'd be okay again. And I was.

428
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:10,612
With all our kidding, I don't mind
telling you I had tears in my eyes.

429
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:17,692
She's really the one in the airline
commercial? You lucky son of a bitch.

430
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:25,250
I don't want to get in over my head.
I did that already.

431
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,772
And you have to be a real bastard.

432
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,218
I don't like being put
in that position.

433
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,973
- What would you do?
- If she looks like she does on TV...

434
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,129
- Size 38, with a D cup.
- Looks aren't everything.

435
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,413
Believe me, looks are everything.

436
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,890
Maybe.

437
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:09,454
- I'm hungry.
- I'll get up.

438
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:15,098
- Why do we always eat so late?
- Because I work late.

439
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,897
- Why do you work at all?
- Brings in extra money.

440
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:25,935
- I make enough.
- You want me to quit?

441
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:31,260
I thought you were bored with it.
So quit.

442
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:37,973
- What would I do?
- What do other women do?

443
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,337
Have children.

444
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,813
Well, you asked me.

445
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,054
- What about my beer?
- We're all out.

446
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,379
- I really wanted a beer.
- Should I run to the corner?

447
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:10,174
- You're too tired.
- I don't mind.

448
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,578
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

449
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,774
It's my fault. I should have
reminded you when I called.

450
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,454
I'm sorry.

451
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:29,536
You're more tired now
than when you were working.

452
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,210
I'm in the house all day.

453
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:39,859
Did you get up at all? What do you
do? When you're not on the phone?

454
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:48,493
- I'm not on the phone that much.
- It took 45 minutes to get through.

455
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,339
- I'll get the beer.
- I'll go.

456
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,738
- I thought you were too tired.
- I haven't been out all day.

457
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,649
Fresh air will do you good.

458
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:17,250
- Will you walk with me?
- Then I may as well go myself.

459
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,690
You wanna make love?

460
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,496
We haven't in a week.

461
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,652
Is it a week?

462
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,773
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.

463
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,690
We undress in front of each other,
spend 15 minutes on foreplay.

464
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,849
We do it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.

465
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,813
We do it when we feel like it.

466
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:23,738
We don't feel we always need to be
passionate. Necking can be more fun.

467
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:34,854
We're considerate of each other.
I had a tendency to be selfish.

468
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,259
But I don't do that now.

469
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:50,499
We try to be patient, and we are.
Gentle with each other.

470
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,373
Maybe it's not meant to be
enjoyable with women you love.

471
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:09,530
Do you want to get laid?

472
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,088
Please.

473
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,614
Very nice.

474
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,819
I almost had it. Right, Cindy?

475
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,772
- See that, Cindy?
- He was lucky.

476
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:53,298
- Bastard, that was out.
- Bullshit.

477
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,698
- We'll do it over, all right?
- All right.

478
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,618
Deuce!
You see that shot, Cindy?

479
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,937
Now we got some tennis.

480
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:30,855
- Game! Luck, my ass!
- You want to take me on, Cindy?

481
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,531
- It's my turn.
- Come on, Bobbie, you're so awful.

482
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,898
You serve.

483
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:46,496
Very nice. You play well.
Look, Sandy!

484
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,658
Terrific, Cindy.

485
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,775
She's racking me up,
I'm not kidding.

486
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:05,935
Look at this. 40-love.
And I'm not taking it easy.

487
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:38,058
You and Lord & Taylor's
have to work out a trial separation.

488
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,453
The water was running.
What did you say?

489
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,688
You and Lord & Taylor's
have to work out a trial separation.

490
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,329
Look at the date.

491
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:01,089
Five months ago.

492
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,774
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.

493
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:09,329
I want to get married.

494
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:41,298
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
The answer is yes.

495
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:47,177
You said, "Am I ever."
I need more in life than this.

496
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,690
After a long bed hunt,
you finally chose me.

497
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:55,576
Cindy's not a virgin either!

498
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,978
Is that what brought this on?

499
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:05,174
You must have a low opinion of me
to think I'd do that to Sandy.

500
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:11,774
No, you wouldn't cheat on Sandy.
He spends half his life here.

501
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:19,136
You just had me screwing Cindy.
Am I screwing Sandy now?

502
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:24,209
I'm going too fast?
Your mind works like an IBM.

503
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,175
First Cindy, then Sandy.
How about Cindy <i>and</i> Sandy?

504
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,295
When I heard about your checkered
past, I felt like a celibate.

505
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,015
- You made me tell.
- Sure, I twisted your arm.

506
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:42,259
- It got you hot!
- Something has to.

507
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:00,973
- You have such contempt for me.
- You worked hard for it. It's yours.

508
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:05,617
- The way you paw me at parties.
- Now affection is contempt.

509
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:09,938
Everything upside down.

510
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,815
Feeling me up in public
is not affection.

511
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:21,574
I know I'm doing a terrible job,
but you're not helping me.

512
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:25,932
- I help <i>you</i>.
- I can do without your kind of help.

513
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,132
Can you really?

514
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:38,453
You'll do anything to ruin my day.
I got up today feeling so good.

515
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:43,609
You couldn't leave us alone.
We were doing so well.

516
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,335
It was great what we had.

517
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:54,412
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way?

518
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:59,899
- I really don't see why.
- Do you want it over?

519
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:07,330
Why must it be one or the other?
I want you here where you belong!

520
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:13,456
- What about you?
- When I'm here, I'm here. Or there.

521
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:19,929
No. I'm a man-eater and a
ball-buster... I want to get married.

522
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,737
Where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!

523
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:35,778
You look like you fell out of bed!
You're in bed longer than a baby!

524
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:41,930
I sleep all day
because I can't stand my life...

525
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,052
Now I'll fall in love with you
all over again.

526
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:55,129
- Marry me, Jonathan. Please.
- You're trying to kill me.

527
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,299
- Marriage isn't death.
- Why now?

528
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:06,133
Two years ago I slept 8 hours,
a year ago it was 12.

529
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:09,571
- Soon it'll be 24.
- Are you trying to scare me?

530
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,614
- I need a life!
- Get ajob!

531
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:18,689
- I want you.
- I'm taken, by me! Go out!

532
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:24,133
- Do something useful!
- You wouldn't let me work.

533
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,810
You throw a tantrum
if I'm out when you call.

534
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,137
I'm out there in the jungle
eight hours a day!

535
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,936
- You even tell me who to vote for.
- You want ajob? I got it!

536
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:41,419
Fix up this pigsty! You get a pretty
good salary for testing this bed.

537
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:47,536
You want $50 extra? Try vacuuming!
An extra 100? Make this bed!

538
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:53,895
Open some windows!
It smells like a coffin in here!

539
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,969
You don't need me.
Why do you take this kind of abuse?

540
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:10,014
Walk out. Please leave me.

541
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:16,853
- I'd almost marry you if you'd leave.
- Abuse? I'm used to worse.

542
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:22,815
With all your carrying on,
to me you're a gift.

543
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,970
So what's it gonna be?

544
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38,858
- You sure know how to ruin things.
- Where does that leave us?

545
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,528
Is this an ultimatum?

546
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:46,814
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting bitch!

547
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:53,050
If it is, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do with your ultimatum!

548
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,491
You can make this goddamned bed!
That's what you can do...

549
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:01,091
Clean these filthy sheets...!

550
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:10,379
- She's not ready.
- We're a little early.

551
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:15,335
- You're looking good, Cindy.
- Will Bobbie be long?

552
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,100
No...

553
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:27,336
- Do we have to go to this party?
- How about it, Cindy?

554
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:32,330
Where's the powder room?
I'm going, you do what you want.

555
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:45,858
Man, she's really something.

556
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:52,533
- I'm bored out of my mind.
- With that? You must be kidding.

557
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,496
Do you have to go to this party?

558
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:05,569
- Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.

559
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,656
I just did my hair.

560
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:26,052
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?

561
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:30,811
- We'll have to have a rematch.
- Any time.

562
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:49,769
Is she always that way?
Boy, is she competitive.

563
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:54,098
She is. I find that attractive.

564
01:13:55,780 --> 01:14:00,456
You know her problem?
She wants balls.

565
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:04,699
- She's all right.
- It's no criticism.

566
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:08,779
- I wish she were more feminine.
- She is a little masculine.

567
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:15,738
- She always demands her way.
- She's got a great body.

568
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:20,172
I have to give her
everything she wants.

569
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:24,771
I wouldn't mind giving her something.

570
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:29,656
You got Bobbie.
I should have it that good.

571
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:35,014
I've never seen a body
like Bobbie's.

572
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:41,489
She could do with more of what
Cindy's got. She's so passive.

573
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:50,615
I wouldn't mind Cindy lying still. Her
instructions in bed are like a drill.

574
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:57,259
I wouldn't mind a little of that.
If she remembers who's boss.

575
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,610
You wouldn't want to swap?

576
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:20,416
- Are you serious?
- It might liven things up.

577
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:30,491
- She can miss one party.
- What about Bobbie?

578
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:37,856
She's so mad at me
she'll jump on you just for revenge.

579
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:43,780
- Seriously?
- She's in the bedroom.

580
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:49,259
If you're quiet, you can do it
and she won't even know.

581
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,458
Give me a minute.

582
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,016
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.

583
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:45,212
I hope you dance
better than you play tennis.

584
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,898
- Sandy won't mind.
- What's he got to do with it?

585
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,092
You're his girl.

586
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,776
He said it would be okay.

587
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:59,571
- What did Sandy say?
- That you and me... you know.

588
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:07,734
- And you had nothing to do with it?
- A little.

589
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:12,377
- A little or a lot?
- This much.

590
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:16,573
I'm surprised it took you this long.

591
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:26,174
- Sandy and I have to go to a party.
- Sandy's busy.

592
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:58,171
You can come around, alone, that's
one thing. I've been expecting that.

593
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:05,058
But you tell Sandy that if he lays
one hand on that tub of lard, -

594
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:08,297
- not to come home.

595
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,774
So you call me.

596
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:46,578
Jesus!

597
01:19:54,460 --> 01:20:00,092
She's semi-comatose. Send a
resuscitation unit and an airway.

598
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:06,933
Be ready to give her an IV.
We'll put her in intensive care.

599
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:13,298
Bastard.

600
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:40,575
Very slick. Very clever!

601
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:44,819
Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie!

602
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,534
JONATHAN FUERST PRESENTS

603
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,179
A JONATHAN FUERST
PRODUCTION

604
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:08,092
BALLBUSTERS ON PARADE!

605
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:14,892
That's Bonnie, my first love.
She lived upstairs from us.

606
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:20,811
We exposed ourselves to each other
at ten. My mother caught us.

607
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:25,172
She washed my mouth out with soap.
I never got the connection.

608
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:32,696
Here's Emily, my first steady.
I never laid a hand on her.

609
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:40,896
Mildred I think this one's name was.
She followed me around at school.

610
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,855
The fellas kidded me about her.
I told her to stop or I'd beat her up.

611
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,894
She dropped her drawers
and shoved her ass at me.

612
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,694
So I got my first sight of ass at 12.

613
01:21:54,620 --> 01:22:01,651
Marcia, 13½. I kissed her
at a spin-the-bottle party.

614
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:09,530
This was Rosalie. She looked
just like Elizabeth Taylor.

615
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:14,450
I had a crush on her
and I never went near her.

616
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,049
In those days, we had illusions.

617
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:23,256
Here's Charlotte. Not much on looks,
but great tits for 15.

618
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:31,738
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.
My first French kiss, 16 years old.

619
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:35,979
Here's Gloria,
the best-built girl in school.

620
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,968
I took her to the zoo
and copped a cheap feel.

621
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,448
Here's Gwen. I tried for a year
to get her to put out, -

622
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,096
- but she was saving me for marriage.

623
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:53,771
Every guy at Evander
got into her pants except me.

624
01:22:53,980 --> 01:23:00,852
Here's my first... No, that's not it.
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.

625
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:06,930
She was a modern dancer.
Great body, but a waste. Frigid.

626
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:13,732
Here's Nancy. Sweet kid.
She went into biology. Very frigid.

627
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:21,697
Here's Bobbie! My wife.
The fastest tits in the West.

628
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:25,575
And king of the ball-busters.
Conned me into marriage.

629
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:29,136
Now she's killing me with alimony.

630
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,851
How did this one get in here?
This is my little girl, Wendy.

631
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:39,053
"Princess," I call her.
Isn't she a dreamboat?

632
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:47,259
Here's a real cunt. I forget her name.
A Nazi. I banged her in Berlin.

633
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:55,459
This I went with for a few months.
Banged her on a yacht race.

634
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:03,214
This slob I went with a year. I got
sick of her and couldn't get it up.

635
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:10,290
Can't remember her name.
This was my Jap in the sack.

636
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,335
I heard Oriental girls were different.
Not in America, they're not.

637
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:22,569
Here's a 16-year-old I gave $20 to
one night when I was drunk.

638
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:27,331
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.

639
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,492
That's all, folks.

640
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:41,452
What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.

641
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,698
Sorry about that.

642
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:09,055
- So, what else is new?
- I don't see anybody anymore.

643
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,380
- Neither do we.
- You've got each other.

644
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:22,211
- I thought she was your daughter.
- She's older than I in many ways.

645
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:28,097
She knows worlds
I can't even begin to touch yet.

646
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,578
- I found out who I am.
- You're in big trouble.

647
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:38,218
Same old Jonathan.
Let me talk to her about you.

648
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:42,698
Talk to her about me?
I'm forty, she's nine.

649
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:47,849
- You just don't get it.
- I've been getting it a long time.

650
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:53,259
What's the point? You found a
good piece of ass. God bless you.

651
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:57,578
You're my friend, I'm happy for you,
for as long as it lasts.

652
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:02,900
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it. Why fight?

653
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:07,571
All those games.
You don't need them, Jonathan.

654
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:12,535
I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son, bright student, -

655
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:19,339
- the cocksman's game.
The good husband and father game.

656
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:25,297
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.

657
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:32,099
I don't want to argue,
so let's just agree to disagree, okay?

658
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,649
Jennifer knows more at 18
than Susan knows to this day.

659
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:41,934
- You found yourself a real jewel.
- She's my love teacher.

660
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:48,898
- Finally got it up, huh?
- You give off such bad vibrations.

661
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:55,619
I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, open.

662
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:01,975
Maybe schmuckiness is what
you need to stay young and open.

663
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:06,458
Don't listen to me. You're doing great
and I'm making money.

664
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,812
You can find what I found.

665
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,330
Don't make me insult you.

666
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,008
Women...

667
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:40,576
All ball-busters, right?

668
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:44,056
When you think of what
he has to dip into, -

669
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:47,969
- any guy with a conscience
has a right to turn soft.

670
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:52,139
- Am I right, Louise?
- You're always right, lover.

671
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:26,257
I don't think we're going to have
any trouble tonight.

672
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:31,691
- Are you sure?
- Want to bet?

673
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,733
- How much?
- The sky's the limit.

674
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:37,659
Goddammit!

675
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:43,971
- You're doing it all wrong.
- I'm doing it like always.

676
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:49,573
You never said that before.
"The sky's the limit."

677
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:54,092
- Never.
- What do I say?

678
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,337
You forgot, didn't you?

679
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:08,372
I say a hundred.

680
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:28,255
- Okay.
- Itjust came out.

681
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:31,736
I just want it right.

682
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:53,050
I don't think we're going to have
any trouble tonight.

683
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:57,811
- Are you sure?
- Wanna bet?

684
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:02,059
- How much?
- A hundred.

685
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:20,971
- You sound pretty sure.
- With your kind, why shouldn't I be?

686
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:26,530
What kind of man am I?

687
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:32,369
A real man. A kind man.

688
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:40,658
- I'm not kind.
- I don't mean weak, like many men.

689
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:46,651
I mean the kindness that comes
from an inner power so strong -

690
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:53,891
- that every act is more proof
of that power. Women resent that.

691
01:31:54,100 --> 01:32:01,814
That's why they try to cut you down.
Because your knowledge is so true -

692
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:08,129
- that it exposes the lies which
every scheming one of them lives by.

693
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:13,209
It takes a true woman to understand
the purest form of love:

694
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:18,494
To love a man who denies himself
to her. A man who inspires worship.

695
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:24,536
Because he has no need for any
woman. Because he has himself.

696
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:31,134
And who is better, more beautiful,
more powerful, more perfect...

697
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:37,734
You're getting hard...
More masculine, extraordinary.

698
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:44,209
More robust... It's rising.

699
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,934
More virile, domineering.

700
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:51,019
More irresistible...

701
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:56,292
It's up, in the air.

702
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:38,336
