1
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>When I was 15, and my family
came to the island for the summer... </i>

2
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:03,756
<i>... there weren't nearly as many houses
or people as there are now. </i>

3
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:10,100
<i>The geography of the island
and the singularity of the sea... </i>

4
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,198
<i>... were far more noticeable then. </i>

5
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:19,071
<i>And if a guy wasn't to die of loneliness,
his family made certain... </i>

6
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:24,379
<i>... that other families from his neighborhood
contributed other kids to the island. </i>

7
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:35,587
Look out, Hermie.

8
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,691
Look out.

9
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,165
<i>Present with me in the summer of '42... </i>

10
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,827
<i>... were Oscy, my best friend. </i>

11
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:49,199
<i>And Benjie, my next to best friend. </i>

12
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:54,337
<i>We called ourselves "The Terrible Trio. "</i>

13
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>And that house up there... </i>

14
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,828
<i>... that was her house. </i>

15
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,696
<i>And nothing, from that first day I saw her... </i>

16
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,340
<i>... and no one
that has happened to me since... </i>

17
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,378
<i>... has ever been as frightening
and as confusing. </i>

18
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:29,777
<i>For no person I've ever known... </i>

19
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,514
<i>... has ever done more
to make me feeI more sure... </i>

20
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,020
<i>... more insecure... </i>

21
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,157
<i>... more important... </i>

22
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,954
<i>... and less significant. </i>

23
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,329
He's gonna take her
right into that bedroom.

24
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,127
He better put the wood down first.

25
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,570
Funny.

26
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:53,999
Hey, come on!

27
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,803
Oscy, for Christ's sakes!

28
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:01,708
Hey, come on, Hermie.
Will you move your ass, please?

29
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:19,427
Give it back, Oscy!

30
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:14,176
Boy, I'd like to feel every one of those girls.

31
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,589
You know, I should've tripped on them.
They'd never know I was getting a feel.

32
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,753
That's not the way to do it.

33
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,626
So what is the way to do it?

34
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,792
You have to say things.

35
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,628
<i>All right, so I'll say, ''Excuse me. ''</i>

36
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,894
You know what I mean.

37
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,638
You just can't go up to a girl
and fall on her.

38
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,437
- It isn't done.
- Why not?

39
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,078
I did it with Gladys Potter.

40
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:42,382
She was only 12 years old.
What did she know?

41
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:45,377
I don't know.
She didn't seem to mind though.

42
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,814
Well, she was surprised.

43
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:50,521
Hell, so was I. She had nothing to feel.

44
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,785
Come on, Benjie, stop dragging.

45
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,097
I don't know what's gonna become of him.

46
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,557
He has no emotions.

47
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,227
He's just confused.

48
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:09,805
Yeah. So am I.

49
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:14,378
I've been waking up lately,
in the middle of the night.

50
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:15,975
A lot.

51
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,683
Yeah, that's okay. I do, too.

52
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,878
- You do?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:29,621
I wake up feeling crazy
and thinking about Vera Miller.

54
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,829
- So what?
- So, I hate Vera Miller.

55
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:36,226
Jesus!

56
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:38,994
You think I'm in love with her?

57
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:41,140
I don't know.

58
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:46,740
I hope I'm not in love with her. I hate her!

59
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,443
What kind of thoughts
do you have about her?

60
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:53,743
Well, I forget.

61
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:58,817
- Then how can I help you?
- Who the hell is asking you to help me?

62
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:02,224
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing you'd understand.

63
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,986
Screw you!

64
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:06,424
Yeah, that's your whole problem, Benjie.

65
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,693
You're only interested in screwing me.

66
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,637
- Why don't you try screwing a girl?
- Okay.

67
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:16,107
<i>''Okay,'' he says. Boy, that's something.</i>

68
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,675
- You wouldn't know the first thing to do.
- I would so!

69
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,548
Okay, what's the first thing you do?

70
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,542
You feel them.

71
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,477
Wrong! You kiss them.

72
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:28,853
We didn't kiss Gladys Potter.

73
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:31,716
We weren't in love with Gladys Potter.

74
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,020
If you're in love with a girl,
you're supposed to kiss her first.

75
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,563
- Ain't that right, Hermie?
- It's polite.

76
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,592
It's not required.

77
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,962
It's required, you ninny!

78
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:43,666
It is not!

79
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,369
How do you know?

80
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,664
Because I found a book.

81
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:05,324
<i>If my mother knew I took that book...
It doesn't belong to me.</i>

82
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,520
It doesn't belong to my mother.
It belongs to the house.

83
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:15,629
If you guys get your fingerprints
on those pages, it's your funeral.

84
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,636
My mother's gonna miss that book!

85
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:23,938
It's the biggest on the shelf.
Ten books fell when I pulled it out.

86
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,534
- Hold it!
- Will you hurry up?

87
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,080
Kill me. I don't read as fast as you do.

88
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,244
Okay, turn.

89
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,253
Jesus! Do you believe all this stuff?.

90
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:44,195
It's a medical journal.
Why should they lie?

91
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,726
How do they take pictures like that?

92
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:50,833
- They must have special cameras.
- What drugstores would develop them?

93
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:54,533
If we took film like that to Sanders,
we'd be put in a reform school.

94
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,706
I guess they develop them themselves.

95
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,212
Yeah, I guess that's what they do.

96
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,673
- Let me look.
- Go away. You'll foam at the mouth.

97
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,742
- It's my book.
- Come on, let him look.

98
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,016
There, they're doing it!

99
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,628
- I don't believe it.
- You'd better believe it.

100
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:19,665
One day your turn will come
and you'd better know what to do.

101
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:22,668
I don't believe it.
My mother and father never did that!

102
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,765
- Never.
- Why not?

103
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,299
Because it's stupid!

104
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:29,240
I hate to break the news,
but that's the way it's done.

105
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:33,211
You better stop pushing me around.
It could be dangerous. It could.

106
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,374
Benjie, if you just look at the pictures,
it does look dumb.

107
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:39,782
But if two people are in love,
it's supposed to be very pleasant.

108
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:42,253
How do you know? You've never done it!

109
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:46,251
Well, it's right here in the book.
In black and white and color.

110
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:49,887
That's why people kiss first.
It gives them a chance to know each other.

111
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,455
Once they get to know each other,
they fall in love, then they make love.

112
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,001
Foreplay! It's called foreplay.

113
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:59,105
Everyone takes off their clothes
and they play foreplay.

114
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:02,938
Then he does this and she does this,
and he does this.

115
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,968
And before you know it, they're screwing!
Now what could be simpler than that?

116
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:12,184
Now, listen, before I saw these pictures,
I didn't think it was possible either.

117
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,720
But these are pictures, Benjie, pictures!

118
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:17,279
These aren't drawings.
I've seen those drawings.

119
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:18,722
These are pictures!

120
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:33,395
In an emergency, it could mount...

121
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,609
...350 caliber jobs.

122
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,445
Probably handle about...

123
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,771
...a dozen or so depth charges.

124
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:45,580
It'd sink if it hit a fish.

125
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:48,253
Stripped down it could do 30 or 40 knots.

126
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,289
Thirty or 40 knots?

127
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,919
Thirty or 40 knots straight down.

128
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:54,051
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,504
<i>Two, three, four, five... </i>

130
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:07,856
<i>One, two, three, four, five... </i>

131
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,331
Sixty-nine, seventy.

132
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:55,765
I wish somebody
would invade this dopey island.

133
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,767
I'm going mad!

134
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,077
Hey, Oscy, it's that lady again.

135
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:24,965
Hermie, you're not gonna go into
another deathlike trance again, are you?

136
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,634
I swear, Hermie,
I don't know what's come over you.

137
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,733
That's a very old person over there.

138
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,269
I don't see the attraction.

139
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:38,976
<i>Maybe it's her mind.
Maybe their minds meet and say, ''Hello. ''</i>

140
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,148
Why don't you go
and say hello to her mind, Hermie?

141
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:43,849
Go on, go say hello.

142
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,015
Cut it out.

143
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:48,250
Come on. If she's the love of your life,
go say hello to her.

144
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,526
Come on, we want to see you go say hello.

145
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:54,761
Maybe you're some kind of a hotshot lover
we don't know about.

146
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,392
- Cut it out!
- Say hello.

147
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,936
- Knock it off!
- Come on!

148
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:00,105
Come on. Go say hello to her, Hermie.

149
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:02,300
- Go say hello to her.
- Yeah, go say hello.

150
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,434
Come on, we want to see you go say hello.

151
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,635
Hey, lady in the pink suit!
It's Hermie the rape artist!

152
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,796
It's Jack the Ripper!

153
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:11,167
It's Herman the German, Nazi spy!

154
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:14,638
- It's a sex fiend!
- It's Hermie the rape artist!

155
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:40,534
Goddamn!

156
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:43,702
<i>Oscy, I'll... </i>

157
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,979
Hey, come on, Herm.

158
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:52,807
Come on.

159
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:54,510
We were only kidding.

160
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:57,447
Hermie, it was a joke!

161
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,322
Look out, Oscy! Look out!

162
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,068
Knock it off, Hermie!

163
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,272
Knock it off! Cut it out!

164
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,842
Now I'm gonna let you go, okay?

165
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,684
Okay, now, I'll let you go.

166
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:41,666
Goddamn it, Hermie! You're really crazy!

167
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,469
You're really crazy, you know that? Crazy!

168
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:46,694
Jesus.

169
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,143
It's enough, goddamn it! Enough!

170
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:55,608
Son of a bitch!

171
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:56,940
Jesus!

172
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,617
Jesus, Oscy, you killed him.

173
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:06,953
Oh, shit!

174
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:09,694
Hey, leave him alone, Benjie.

175
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,523
Leave him alone!

176
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,664
The son of a bitch threw sand in my face.

177
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,666
<i>- Goddamn it, I mean...
- We'll see you later, Hermie, okay?</i>

178
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,635
Bastards!

179
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:37,922
- Hermie, where're you going?
- The Planet Mongo.

180
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:41,618
- It's not even 8:00!
- I can't do anything about that!

181
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,929
- What did you have for breakfast?
- An elephant!

182
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:48,194
- Bring me back a newspaper.
- Okay.

183
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:50,926
<i>And a Time magazine for your father!</i>

184
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:52,397
Jesus!

185
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:19,448
May I offer some assistance?

186
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:22,153
Oh, yes, you may.

187
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:26,927
I really didn't expect to buy so much.
I should have brought my wagon.

188
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:31,898
- Yeah, you should've brought your wagon.
- Yes.

189
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:40,135
- What you really need is a wagon.
- I think you're right. I can take one.

190
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,437
No, it's okay. It's okay.

191
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:45,480
If you take some and I take some,
I think we can manage.

192
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:49,078
- I'll be happy to pay you.
- No, I wouldn't think of it. Really.

193
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,146
My house is a pretty long walk.

194
00:21:51,424 --> 00:21:53,449
- I know where it is.
- You do?

195
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:55,185
Yeah. It's that way.

196
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:01,864
- Are you sure it's okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

197
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:05,136
- Well, won't you let me take one?
- No, no.

198
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,667
- Do you live on the island?
- In the summer.

199
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:13,036
- With your family?
- Yeah.

200
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,547
But they don't bother me.

201
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,508
I pretty much go my own way.

202
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:33,031
Aren't they pretty?

203
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,527
- Oh, yeah.
- I couldn't resist.

204
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:49,179
I got a 12-page letter today!

205
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,541
- That's nice.
- It sure is.

206
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:25,975
Hey, Hermie!

207
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:27,675
Somebody called you.

208
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:29,581
Not me.

209
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:31,289
Is your name Hermie?

210
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:33,218
Yeah.

211
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,556
Well, somebody back there called you.

212
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:37,460
No, not me.

213
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,757
Well, he called Hermie.

214
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,961
Well, Hermie is a pretty common name.

215
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:04,281
This is it.

216
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,384
I can go further.

217
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:08,826
There's really no need.

218
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:10,226
Okay.

219
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,028
- Oh, can you bring them in?
- Sure.

220
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,533
Hang on.

221
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:24,765
Got it.

222
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:28,542
- In there, in the kitchen.
- Okay.

223
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,809
You can put them on the table.

224
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,956
- They should make these bags stronger.
- I think you're right.

225
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,456
- Please let me give you some money.
- I wouldn't think of it.

226
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:45,421
Well, how can I repay you?

227
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,458
It's okay, really.

228
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,870
I'm gonna have some coffee.
Would you like some?

229
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:55,169
Sure.

230
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:56,969
Great. Sit down.

231
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:09,618
These are marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

232
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,816
Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.

233
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,421
You drink coffee, don't you?

234
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:21,157
I consume a couple of cups a day.

235
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:26,197
- Well, I have milk.
- Oh, no, I take it black.

236
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,505
- Are you in high school?
- I'm a sophomore.

237
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:33,968
I thought you were older.

238
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:37,678
Next year I'll be a junior. And so on.

239
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:42,376
Now, don't be in too big a hurry. You can
end up in the Army before you know it.

240
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,455
Well, I'm prepared to go.

241
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:49,521
I'm taking preflight courses in high school,
and I guess I'll get my wings.

242
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:53,724
And maybe I can team up with my brother.
He's a paratrooper.

243
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,362
And maybe I can drop him out.

244
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,335
So, your brother is a paratrooper?

245
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,343
But, mostly, I have a sister in high school.

246
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:11,643
Coffee is ready.

247
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:16,284
I hope it's all right. It's from this morning.

248
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,151
It looks fine.

249
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,854
I have a little bit of sugar.
Would you like some?

250
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,292
No, no thanks. I'll take it black.

251
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:44,410
I forgot to tell you.
It's awfully hot. Are you all right?

252
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:45,984
Let me get you some milk.

253
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:48,383
Do you think I could have
a glass of ice water?

254
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,526
Why don't I put the ice in your coffee.
You like ice coffee?

255
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:57,719
- Sure. Great.
- I'm sorry.

256
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,997
- Are you all right?
- It's okay.

257
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:04,764
I'm really sorry.

258
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,566
Do you have many friends on the island?

259
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,702
Two.

260
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:17,415
But they're immature, you know.

261
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,485
What do you do to keep yourself busy?

262
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,844
Well, I lean toward basketball.

263
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,250
But I think there's a lot
to be said for baseball.

264
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:31,526
At least in baseball you don't get
round-shouldered from dribbling.

265
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,864
No, that's true.

266
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:46,276
- Do you like music?
- Yeah, I'm quite musical.

267
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,474
Do you play an instrument?

268
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,571
I sing.

269
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:55,179
Well, I think a voice is like an instrument.

270
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:56,919
I do, too.

271
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:01,290
And then for a change,
you can always whistle.

272
00:28:01,794 --> 00:28:03,091
I can see that.

273
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,925
- You'll like those.
- They're good.

274
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:12,765
- I think I'll be going.
- Do you have to go?

275
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:16,073
- Yes, I really think I should.
- Wait.

276
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,267
Here, take the rest of the doughnuts.
Seems the least I can do.

277
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,579
- Thank you very much.
- No, I thank you.

278
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,184
You're welcome. It was a privilege.

279
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,648
Next time I'll be sure to take my wagon.

280
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:31,255
I think you should. You could get a hernia.

281
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:35,185
Goodbye, Hermie. And thanks again.

282
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:37,324
Goodbye. And you're welcome.

283
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:40,995
Perhaps I'll see you again some time.

284
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,295
It would be a privilege.

285
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:45,931
Goodbye.

286
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:52,769
Hernia! Jesus!

287
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:12,186
Hermie!

288
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:16,963
Wait a minute.

289
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,536
Hermie, hold on.

290
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:27,443
- Hi.
- You were in there a long time.

291
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:31,242
You could've brought those bags in
and be out in 10 seconds. What happened?

292
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,807
- We had drinks.
- You're kidding? They had drinks.

293
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,786
- Big deal.
- She let you get funny?

294
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:37,480
You're a dope.

295
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:41,014
Come on, an older woman like that,
what's a little feel to her?

296
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:44,460
- She let you have a feel, Hermie?
- She gave me some doughnuts.

297
00:29:45,364 --> 00:29:47,628
Probably stinks from perfume.

298
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,228
Grow up!

299
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,862
Come on, will you tell us
what happened in there all that time?

300
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:55,702
I wasn't aware of the time.

301
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:57,502
It flew quickly.

302
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,040
Boy, I'm telling you,
I'd like to give her a feel.

303
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,776
I thought you were mature, Oscy.

304
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,841
It's very mature to feel girls.
My brother does it all the time.

305
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,443
How come he's a dentist?

306
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,318
Don't get to be such a big shot
all of the sudden.

307
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,881
Don't try to tell us
something went on in there.

308
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,958
I ain't trying to tell you anything.

309
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:20,088
Which is exactly the same as telling us
a lot went on in there. A lot!

310
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:21,424
Screw you!

311
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,667
I ain't gonna tell you
that something happened if it didn't.

312
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:25,829
Nothing happened!

313
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:29,734
If you believe something happened,
then I'm sorry, because nothing happened.

314
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:33,804
- Jesus! I don't even know her name!
- You expect us to believe that?

315
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:36,843
I don't care what you believe!
I'm going home.

316
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:40,641
<i>My father is waiting for his newspaper
and his Time magazine.</i>

317
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:42,952
Going home?

318
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:45,880
Yeah, I'm going home!

319
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:49,254
A few things to think over. Going home.

320
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:53,354
- Well, what are you gonna do later?
- Gonna kill myself!

321
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,093
- No, after that?
- I don't know, Oscy, I don't know!

322
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,297
Hernia! Jesus!

323
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,757
Good evening.

324
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:04,302
Fine night for an evening of movies.

325
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,829
Are you old enough to be up this late?

326
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:08,898
I have two charming friends.

327
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,900
You have ice cream on your face.

328
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:15,573
That perfume! I grow dizzy.

329
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:20,774
My friends and I would like
you three ladies to join us in the movies.

330
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,418
Dutch treat, I suppose.

331
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,655
Yeah. But, we'll spring for refreshments.

332
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:32,530
- Where are they?
- It's those two rascals over there.

333
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,495
- Where?
- Over there.

334
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:38,101
Smile. Look older.

335
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:40,633
Here, come on.

336
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,802
They're coming this way.

337
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,308
- What's your name?
- Oscy.

338
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:49,404
- Don't panic.
- I'm sweating.

339
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:51,573
Don't sweat!

340
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:57,246
This is Hermie and this is Benjie.
And this is Miriam.

341
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,149
This is Aggie and this is Gloria.

342
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,962
Let's see. Hermie, you're with Aggie
because you're both intellectual.

343
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,455
Benjie, you're with Gloria, because.

344
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:09,966
I have to go home.

345
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:12,897
- If Gloria doesn't go, we don't go.
- Benjie!

346
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,337
- It's not important that I go.
- Don't be silly!

347
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,807
I'm not being silly, I don't want to go.

348
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:20,106
- Well, then we won't go.
- Go without her.

349
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:22,942
- She's our friend. We stick together.
- Go without me.

350
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:25,815
- She wants you to go without her.
- She doesn't.

351
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,545
- She does!
- She does not!

352
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:29,848
She left. Now, come on, let's get in line.

353
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:32,857
The night is still young.
I don't want to miss the cartoon.

354
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:35,486
- Hello.
- Hi.

355
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,766
Then we each want a 15-cent candy.

356
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,164
Sure, okay.

357
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:58,043
Fifteen cents.

358
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,078
That's the last time
I ever do anything for Benjie.

359
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:06,387
He's too young. It's beyond him.

360
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,983
Christ, he almost screwed up
the whole arrangement.

361
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:11,962
- I got bad news.
- What?

362
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:14,792
You have to lend me a dime.

363
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:18,600
Here's a nickel.
Hold on, I got some pennies.

364
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,569
Catch the boobs on Miriam.

365
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,904
You catch them.

366
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:28,412
She throws them, I'll catch them.
I'll be ready.

367
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:31,911
Those boobs come at me,
I'll be there to catch them.

368
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:34,684
Hermie. Hi.

369
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:35,885
Hi, there.

370
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,047
- Going to the movies?
- Yeah.

371
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,588
That's nice. Good to see you.

372
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:47,857
- She really knows you.
- Jesus, it's embarrassing.

373
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,298
- What?
- Her, seeing me with that.

374
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:51,768
Hermie, excuse me.

375
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:54,738
Do you think you could come by my house
Thursday afternoon?

376
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,707
I have some heavy things to move
and I'll need some help.

377
00:34:57,776 --> 00:34:59,505
- Sure! Okay.
- Great.

378
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:03,881
Maybe Thursday morning would be better.
About 10:00? Is that all right?

379
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:08,317
- Sure. We'll have coffee.
- Yes. You like it black, right?

380
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:12,048
- Yeah, right.
- See you Thursday. Enjoy the picture.

381
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:17,554
- Hey, you're in.
- Shut up!

382
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:19,857
You're in, boy. I can't believe it.

383
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:23,059
She's mad about you.
Coffee at 10:00. Shit.

384
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:24,295
Will you shut up?

385
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,669
I'm all excited. I'm gonna squeeze the crap
out of Miriam, soon as the lights go out.

386
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,341
You're really something.
You can't even wait till the cartoon is over.

387
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:34,402
I can't wait. I can't wait!

388
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:43,178
<i>Silly name, isn't it?</i>

389
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:46,019
<i>My father named me
after a professor he was fond of. </i>

390
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:49,527
<i>I was J.D. in college
and my wife calls me J. Duveaux. </i>

391
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:52,027
<i>But I'm Jerry to my friends. </i>

392
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:55,125
<i>And now, won't you tell me who you are?</i>

393
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:58,965
<i>My name is Vale. V-a-I-e. </i>

394
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:03,601
<i>If it ever appears on the passenger list,
it will be C. Vale. </i>

395
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,108
Stop it!

396
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:09,413
<i>- Are you one of the Vales of Boston?
- One of the lesser ones. </i>

397
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,011
<i>Well, which one?</i>

398
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,649
<i>I don't even know yet
whether it's Miss or Mrs. </i>

399
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:15,447
<i>It's Aunt. </i>

400
00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:18,117
<i>Every family has one, you know. </i>

401
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,483
<i>But Aunt what?</i>

402
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,755
<i>My name is Charlotte Vale. </i>

403
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,556
<i>Miss Charlotte Vale. </i>

404
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:28,990
<i>It was like a miracle happening. </i>

405
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,192
<i>Like having your child. </i>

406
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,970
- Stop it!
- All right.

407
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,466
<i>I even allowed myself
to indulge in the fantasy... </i>

408
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:41,205
<i>... that both of us loving her,
and doing what was best for her together... </i>

409
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:44,609
<i>... would make her seem actually
like our child after awhile. </i>

410
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,384
<i>But I see no such fantasy
has occurred to you. </i>

411
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:52,480
<i>Again, I've been a big sentimentaI fooI.
It's a tendency I have. </i>

412
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,588
<i>Wait a minute. </i>

413
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:59,196
<i>I was afraid
you were keeping Tina out of pity. </i>

414
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:02,729
<i>But there was no note of pity
in your ridicule of me just now. </i>

415
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:06,569
<i>I know you still love me,
and it won't die, what's between us. </i>

416
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:11,231
<i>Do what you will:
ignore it, neglect it, starve it. </i>

417
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:12,872
Stop it!

418
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,037
<i>It's stronger than both of us together. </i>

419
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:17,341
<i>Please, let me go. </i>

420
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,308
<i>Charlotte. </i>

421
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,415
<i>Please, let me go. </i>

422
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:40,160
<i>Jerry?</i>

423
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:43,104
<i>Dr. Jaquith knows about us. </i>

424
00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:47,200
<i>When he said I could take Tina,
he said, "You're on probation. "</i>

425
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,004
<i>Do you know what that means?</i>

426
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:54,285
<i>It means that I am on probation
because of you and me. </i>

427
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,180
<i>He allowed this visit as a test. </i>

428
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,058
<i>If I can't stand such tests... </i>

429
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:03,717
<i>... I'll lose Tina. </i>

430
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,625
<i>Then we'll lose each other. </i>

431
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:10,325
<i>Jerry, please help me. </i>

432
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:16,766
<i>Shall we just have a cigarette on it?</i>

433
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,768
<i>Yes. </i>

434
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:57,745
<i>May I sometimes come here?</i>

435
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:01,345
<i>Whenever you like. It's your home, too. </i>

436
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:04,521
<i>There are people here who love you. </i>

437
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:10,127
<i>To look at you and Tina,
see everything peace and contentment. </i>

438
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:14,059
<i>Of course. And just think,
it won't be for this time only. </i>

439
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,361
<i>That is if you will help me
keep what we have. </i>

440
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,869
<i>We'll both try hard to protect
that little strip of territory that's ours. </i>

441
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:27,538
<i>We can talk about your child. </i>

442
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:28,938
<i>Our child. </i>

443
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:32,847
<i>Thank you. </i>

444
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:35,250
<i>And will you be happy, Charlotte?</i>

445
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,986
<i>Jerry, don't let ask for the moon. </i>

446
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:41,419
<i>We have the stars. </i>

447
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:09,853
Where do you live?

448
00:40:10,422 --> 00:40:11,753
That's off the point.

449
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:17,717
- Let's go to the beach and watch the surf.
- No, it's late. We really have to go.

450
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:18,853
Come on.

451
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:22,490
No! But maybe we'll see you
on the beach tomorrow.

452
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,866
- Will you be on the beach tomorrow?
- Ain't gonna be on a mountain.

453
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,461
Well, then we'll see you.

454
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,034
'Bye.

455
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:33,968
Yeah, 'bye.

456
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:39,605
Come on.

457
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,420
- How did you make out?
- Pretty good.

458
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,288
- What did you do?
- I held her breast.

459
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:57,327
- You didn't?
- For almost 11 minutes.

460
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:59,335
Fantastic!

461
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,462
- Eleven full minutes.
- You timed it!

462
00:41:05,677 --> 00:41:08,771
The longest I ever got
was eight minutes with Lila Harrison.

463
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:11,106
- So, you broke your record!
- By three minutes.

464
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:15,219
What did it feel like?

465
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:18,388
What'd you mean, what'd it feel like?
It felt like a breast.

466
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,580
Didn't it feel like an arm?

467
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:22,488
An arm?

468
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:26,658
- No, it felt like a breast.
- Come on, I bet it felt like an arm.

469
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:31,763
- Why the hell should it feel like an arm?
- Because it was an arm.

470
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:35,229
Now, what's the matter with you, Oscy?

471
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:39,239
You were feeling her arm. I was looking.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

472
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:42,107
You were squeezing an arm
for 11 minutes, you schmuck.

473
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,880
So the eight minute record
with Lila Harrison still stands.

474
00:41:46,618 --> 00:41:50,145
- God damn it, Oscy, you're lying!
- I wouldn't lie about an arm, Hermie.

475
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,188
An arm?

476
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:58,655
Jesus, I was passing out
and it was an arm.

477
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,428
A very lovely arm.

478
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:05,136
- Well, you're a son of a bitch!
- What?

479
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:07,433
- Son of a bitch! Why did you tell me?
- What?

480
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:11,464
- Why not just let me think it was a breast?
- I thought you should know the truth.

481
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:14,803
I thought you should know
so you won't make that mistake again.

482
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:17,677
You wanted to ruin my memory of it,
you son of a bitch!

483
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:18,545
The hell!

484
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:21,881
What do I care if you spend
your whole life squeezing arms?

485
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:24,114
I just thought you ought to face reality.

486
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:27,621
Especially if you're putting a clock on it
and going for records.

487
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:30,693
I guess you're right.

488
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:36,761
God, how can I ever face her again?

489
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,339
Make sure she's wearing long sleeves.

490
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:46,175
An arm.

491
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:48,305
An 11-minute arm!

492
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:54,613
Lila Harrison, your record is safe!

493
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:56,912
Lila Harrison. Jesus!

494
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:05,161
Nothing is too heavy
when love is in the air.

495
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:09,129
Laughter becomes you.

496
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,502
Coffee is exquisite. Exquisite.

497
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,182
- Is that you, Hermie?
- It is I.

498
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,461
Come on in. The door is open.

499
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,795
I'll be out in a minute.
Why don't you sit down?

500
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,336
I certainly will.

501
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:50,162
Shall.

502
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:52,867
<i>Well... </i>

503
00:44:18,603 --> 00:44:19,365
Hi.

504
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:32,976
We'll have the coffee later, all right?

505
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:36,876
Okay.

506
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:39,850
- Your coffee is exquisite.
- Thank you.

507
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:44,592
I hope it wasn't an inconvenience
for you to come by like this.

508
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:45,924
No, it's okay.

509
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:57,636
- What's up there?
- Dust.

510
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:01,272
- May I see?
- Sure.

511
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,494
There's lots of room.
We shouldn't have any trouble.

512
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:27,336
Thank you. You're right.
There's lots of dust up there.

513
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:29,736
Laughter becomes you.

514
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:35,945
The best thing for me to do is hand you
the boxes one at a time, don't you think?

515
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:37,940
Yeah, okay.

516
00:45:58,536 --> 00:45:59,730
How are you doing?

517
00:46:01,706 --> 00:46:02,502
Fine.

518
00:46:08,146 --> 00:46:10,376
Hermie, what's wrong? Are you all right?

519
00:46:12,984 --> 00:46:13,780
Yeah.

520
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:17,177
Well, your leg is shaking.

521
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:22,584
I don't think your ladder is too good.

522
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:26,958
Do you want me to hold it?

523
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:33,734
I think you better hand me another box.

524
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:43,136
Just two more.

525
00:46:54,759 --> 00:46:56,249
That's it. Come on down.

526
00:47:09,373 --> 00:47:10,397
Good job.

527
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:20,608
Look, this time you really must let me
give you some money.

528
00:47:20,752 --> 00:47:23,585
- No, I couldn't take any money.
- But you have to!

529
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:26,680
I couldn't possibly have gotten
those boxes up there myself.

530
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:28,150
It's okay.

531
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:30,553
I like you.

532
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,797
That's very sweet of you, Hermie.
I like you, too.

533
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:42,229
I mean, I don't like many people.

534
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:04,386
Hermie! Hey, Hermie!

535
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,195
Come on!

536
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,191
Come on, will you, hurry up?

537
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:14,837
Get up here, come on. What happened?

538
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:18,002
- Nothing.
- What went on in there all that time?

539
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:19,099
Nothing.

540
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,877
Come on, try to remember.
What happened?

541
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,816
Well, the way it went,
we went in and we chatted.

542
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:26,711
Yeah?

543
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:29,342
And than I put the boxes in the attic.

544
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:31,852
- And then she kissed me.
- Kissed you?

545
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:34,247
Yeah, right here. See any lipstick?

546
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:36,757
Jesus! He's right. Lipstick!

547
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:40,691
- That's blood. It's a mosquito bite.
- No, it's lipstick.

548
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:45,593
- That's definitely lipstick!
- Look, Oscy, I like her kissing me, not you.

549
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,802
It's blood. She's a goddamn vampire!

550
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:53,507
As I left, I'm sure she asked me
to come back. Any time.

551
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:56,512
You know, Hermie,
I really think you've struck gold.

552
00:48:56,614 --> 00:48:57,638
I really do.

553
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:06,184
- Benjie! We're gonna need the book again.
- You can just whistle.

554
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:09,749
You drooled all over it. I don't want
to get blamed for any warped pages.

555
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:11,294
My glasses for the book.

556
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:14,991
You'll have loads of fun
identifying enemy aircraft over the island.

557
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:18,558
- You'll be a hero!
- Nothing flies over this island except birds!

558
00:49:18,636 --> 00:49:21,764
- Maybe they're enemies.
- Jesus Christ, no go!

559
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:23,134
It's a fair swap.

560
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:25,698
What's more,
you can have the glasses for two days.

561
00:49:25,776 --> 00:49:27,937
I only need the book for one afternoon.

562
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:30,503
If you don't like my offer,
I'll break your nose.

563
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,311
- Come on, Oscy.
- Come on, Hermie! Christ!

564
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:37,052
In the name of the USA,
I award you these field glasses.

565
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:38,683
Good hunting.

566
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:53,594
Benjie, come on, hurry up.

567
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:55,829
Hurry up, Benjie. Come on.

568
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,300
Come on, hurry up.

569
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:39,883
Come on.

570
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,614
<i>Now, Backstage Wife.</i>

571
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:50,120
<i>The beloved story of Mary Noble.
Now Mary Noble, war wife. </i>

572
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:55,691
<i>Her husband Larry, former Broadway star,
now Lieutenant Noble of the Coast Guard... </i>

573
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:56,698
Come on.

574
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,735
<i>... somewhere in the South Pacific. </i>

575
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:03,134
<i>If you recall, when we last heard
from Larry, he and a lone companion... </i>

576
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:06,734
<i>... Bosun's Mate Smith, were stranded
on an enemy infested island... </i>

577
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:09,575
<i>... after their rubber boat
had been wrecked in a squall. </i>

578
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,518
Come on.

579
00:51:22,727 --> 00:51:25,355
<i>- Mrs. Larson didn't.
- She didn't, but now she does. </i>

580
00:51:25,596 --> 00:51:27,291
<i>Yes, now she does use Duz. </i>

581
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:31,563
<i>Now Mrs. Larson knows Duz.
D-u-z does everything in her wash. </i>

582
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:34,334
<i>She's convinced
this new kind of soap is best. </i>

583
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:38,273
<i>Why, it's even improved her disposition.
She used to be a crosspatch on washday. </i>

584
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:40,572
- Watch that step.
- Okay, okay.

585
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:43,803
<i>She's twice as sunny. </i>

586
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:46,714
<i>You wouldn't dirty up so many towels
if you had to wash them. </i>

587
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:50,315
<i>I know your rayon undies
don't look bright anymore... </i>

588
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:51,514
Come on.

589
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:55,150
<i>Ah, but then Mrs. Larson
started using Duz instead of... </i>

590
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,720
Hermie, I just cleaned in there.

591
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:01,296
Goddamn it!

592
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:06,196
- Where's the paper?
- It's in the drawer.

593
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,973
I found it. Where's the carbon paper?

594
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:17,202
In there!

595
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:26,750
What are you doing?

596
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:29,686
Making two copies.
One for me and one for you.

597
00:52:29,794 --> 00:52:33,457
You can keep it with you at all times,
and refer to it and learn it.

598
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:34,561
What for?

599
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:37,596
You can't call on your lady
with a book under your arm...

600
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:39,966
...so I'm condensing it. Point by point.

601
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:42,335
Stay close to this and you'll do okay.

602
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:46,438
You know, Oscy, I'm troubled.
I think I have a deep feeling for her.

603
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,699
So what?

604
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:50,170
Well, so I don't want to just lay her.

605
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:51,840
I respect her.

606
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:56,052
There's something you have to understand.
It's all right to respect a lady.

607
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,089
But, she's won't respect you
if you don't try to lay her.

608
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:00,453
I don't believe that.

609
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:03,789
It's true! My brother told me.
That's the way ladies are.

610
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:06,629
They want you to try,
even if they don't let you.

611
00:53:06,764 --> 00:53:09,597
Because even though they don't let you,
they want you to.

612
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,931
- I think I understand.
- Good. Now you start memorizing.

613
00:53:23,114 --> 00:53:24,604
- This is crazy.
- What?

614
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:25,804
Point three.

615
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:27,716
What's crazy about it?

616
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:32,252
- I've never even heard of the word.
- It's Latin. The original guys were Latins.

617
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:36,882
- I wouldn't even know how to pronounce it.
- You don't pronounce it, you just do it!

618
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:38,961
I don't even know where it is!

619
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:43,427
And what the hell is this in number four?

620
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:46,903
That's Latin, too.
It's all in Latin, Hermie. Jesus!

621
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:50,167
Yeah? I may just have to ask her
where some of these things are!

622
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:54,467
<i>They're all in approximately
the same place. ''Seek and ye shall find. ''</i>

623
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:57,573
Besides, she's supposed to be
helping you out.

624
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:01,579
Well, I hope so because I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

625
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:06,786
Point six, Hermie, very important.

626
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:10,049
- Foreplay.
- Right! That word keeps cropping up.

627
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:13,759
I still don't know what I'm supposed to do.

628
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:16,061
<i>What do I say?
''How about a little foreplay?''</i>

629
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,294
I told you. You don't have to say a word.

630
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:21,598
Yeah? Point two definitely states
that we're supposed to converse.

631
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:24,573
Swell, but when you get to Point six,
there's no more talking.

632
00:54:24,642 --> 00:54:26,337
Just moaning and sighing.

633
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,268
Just moan and sigh.

634
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:32,146
- Well, she'll think I'm sick.
- No, she'll be moaning and sighing, too.

635
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:35,545
It's gonna get pretty noisy. Boy.

636
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:39,283
I got news on Miriam today.
One of the lifeguards told me.

637
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:42,382
Once she gets started,
she's supposed to really be something.

638
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:43,949
I'm home, Hermie, home!

639
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:48,687
Look, Oscy, if I follow these 12 points,
she just might have a kid.

640
00:54:48,933 --> 00:54:52,494
I can't afford a kid at this stage of my life.
So the whole thing is off!

641
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:55,605
I really can't believe it, Hermie.
You are really dumb.

642
00:54:55,773 --> 00:54:58,207
I may be dumb,
but I'm not gonna be a father!

643
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:01,267
- Two wrongs don't make a right.
- You use protection.

644
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:05,046
You use a rubber.
Haven't you ever heard of a rubber?

645
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:08,278
- Yeah, of course I have.
- All right, so that's what you use!

646
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,184
I already have mine.

647
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:15,525
When my brother went into the service,
he willed it to me.

648
00:55:16,093 --> 00:55:18,186
I've been carrying it around ever since.

649
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,053
It's my lucky charm.

650
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,895
- How much do you want for it?
- It's from my brother.

651
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:27,196
It's a family heirloom.

652
00:55:27,438 --> 00:55:29,804
You have to get your own.
Go to the drugstore.

653
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:33,305
I'm not gonna risk it.
I happen to be underage.

654
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:36,811
Also, for information, Oscy,
women shop in drugstores.

655
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,781
So where do you want to get them?
A sporting goods store?

656
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:43,219
If you were a really good friend,
you'd lend me yours.

657
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,254
- What?
- Well, I'll return it.

658
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:48,954
Hermie, I'm beginning to think
that maybe you're a homo.

659
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:52,686
- Swell, Oscy, thanks a lot.
- No, I mean, you don't know anything.

660
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:56,758
A rubber's to be used once, and only once.
And only by one party.

661
00:55:57,301 --> 00:56:00,293
Not even the best of friends
can go half-sies on a rubber.

662
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:04,837
- Just forget the whole damn thing.
- I'm doing this for you, Hermie.

663
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:08,835
I'm doing this out of friendship,
because your time has come.

664
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:11,413
Yeah? Let's forget it!

665
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:13,917
I can't. It's all arranged.

666
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:17,786
- What's arranged?
- Marshmallow roast, on the beach tonight.

667
00:56:18,255 --> 00:56:22,214
Me and Miriam and you and Aggie.
Don't try to get out of it, it's all set.

668
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:25,692
- Here are your instructions.
- I'm not interested in Aggie!

669
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:30,129
You're not ready for the older lady.
I have to sharpen you up on someone else.

670
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:31,824
Aggie is all I got.

671
00:56:32,236 --> 00:56:35,694
- You know, Oscy, you're really crazy!
- Yeah. Crazy, man!

672
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:38,104
Sorry. Listen.

673
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:42,701
I'm not asking you to get to Point 12
because I don't believe in miracles!

674
00:56:43,113 --> 00:56:45,343
I'll be happy if you get to Point two.

675
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:48,442
- Now, all I want you to do is give it a try.
- Forget it.

676
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:51,283
I'm not sticking my neck out for Aggie.
Jesus, Aggie!

677
00:56:51,355 --> 00:56:53,346
Tomorrow morning, you'll thank me.

678
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:56,985
So, tonight, I'll bring the marshmallows
and you bring a rubber.

679
00:57:19,883 --> 00:57:22,010
- Go on.
- All right.

680
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:27,022
Well, go on. Come on. Get in there.

681
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:47,201
- Anything else?
- Yes, a large bottle of cod liver oil.

682
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:49,643
- Ma!
- Shut up, it's good for you.

683
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:54,079
It's $2.18. Thank you. Come again.

684
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:59,017
- Move.
- All right, all right.

685
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:00,852
Move, move already.

686
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,952
Can I help you?

687
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:40,159
No. Just looking.

688
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:15,757
Did you get them?

689
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,531
- Not yet.
- Well, go get them.

690
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:20,831
There's a lady in there.

691
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:56,670
Okay. Get going. Go on.

692
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,772
- All right.
- Go!

693
01:00:20,531 --> 01:00:21,395
Yes?

694
01:00:22,232 --> 01:00:24,496
It's me. The same guy as before.

695
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,928
I just stepped outside for some air.

696
01:00:31,742 --> 01:00:34,575
Just what is it you're looking for?
Maybe I can help you.

697
01:00:35,279 --> 01:00:36,746
I'll know when I find it.

698
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:49,991
Maybe if you'd tell me what it is?

699
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:54,987
I'll tell you. I just remembered.

700
01:00:57,401 --> 01:00:58,129
Well?

701
01:01:00,904 --> 01:01:02,735
A strawberry ice cream cone.

702
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,504
All right, come with me.

703
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,844
One dip or two?

704
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,087
Better make it a triple.

705
01:01:27,598 --> 01:01:30,362
All right. That'll be 10 cents.

706
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:37,973
There's something else I need.
I just remembered.

707
01:01:39,343 --> 01:01:40,708
Well, what is it?

708
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,911
Sprinkles.

709
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:48,448
All right.

710
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,256
Sprinkles. Here you go.

711
01:01:56,994 --> 01:01:58,461
Thanks a lot.

712
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,258
That'll cost you 12 cents.

713
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:06,797
Is there something else?

714
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:11,572
<i>Well, I hate to bother you, but... </i>

715
01:02:15,212 --> 01:02:16,702
Speak up, son.

716
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:20,416
How about a napkin?

717
01:02:21,752 --> 01:02:22,810
All right.

718
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:28,558
- Anything else?
- How about some rubbers?

719
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:34,753
Pardon?

720
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:37,900
I understand that you carry them.

721
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:40,333
Carry what?

722
01:02:40,937 --> 01:02:42,564
Come on, you know what.

723
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,037
Contraceptives?

724
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:47,301
Yeah. Right.

725
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:49,707
And you want to buy some?

726
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:51,639
Yeah.

727
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:54,617
What for?

728
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:57,316
Come on. You know what for.

729
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:02,282
All right.

730
01:03:14,638 --> 01:03:15,764
What brand?

731
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:18,604
- Brand?
- Brand and style.

732
01:03:20,177 --> 01:03:23,305
- The usual.
- Well, there's a number to choose from.

733
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,916
Do you have to flash them around?

734
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:33,814
Which is your usual?

735
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:42,930
- The blue ones.
- And how many would you like?

736
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:46,061
Three dozen.

737
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,760
You planning a big night?

738
01:03:49,606 --> 01:03:50,903
Just the usual.

739
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:55,004
That'll be $12.

740
01:03:55,946 --> 01:03:58,813
- $12?
- And 12 cents for the ice cream.

741
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:02,548
Well, how much just for a dozen?

742
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:04,653
$4.

743
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:07,848
And how many for $1? Three.

744
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:13,221
- I'll take two.
- They come three to a package.

745
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:18,734
Can I just owe you
for the ice cream cone, then?

746
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:23,163
All right now, son. Fun is fun.

747
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,031
- But how old are you?
- Sixteen.

748
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:28,376
How old?

749
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:30,479
On my next birthday.

750
01:04:32,282 --> 01:04:34,375
What are you planning to do with these?

751
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:38,085
Well, they're for my brother. He's older.

752
01:04:38,855 --> 01:04:41,187
Why can't he come in
and get them for himself?.

753
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:42,952
Well, he's sick.

754
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,719
Well, then what does he need them for?

755
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,296
For when he's feeling better.

756
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:50,262
He's a Ranger.

757
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:55,027
Do you know what these are used for?

758
01:04:57,274 --> 01:05:01,142
Sure. You fill them up with water,
and then you throw them off the roof.

759
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,537
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you knew what they were for.

760
01:05:05,382 --> 01:05:06,542
Of course I know.

761
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:10,074
My brother wouldn't send me in
to buy them without telling me.

762
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,287
We'll call it $1 even,
including the ice cream.

763
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:15,046
Okay.

764
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:20,023
Thank you!

765
01:05:24,801 --> 01:05:27,031
- Hi, Hermie.
- Hi, Aggie.

766
01:05:28,138 --> 01:05:30,003
I had a very nice time at the movie.

767
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,737
- I'm sorry if I was rough on your arm.
- That's all right.

768
01:05:34,044 --> 01:05:35,443
Is it healing well?

769
01:05:35,512 --> 01:05:38,379
It's okay, really.
I'm looking forward to tonight.

770
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:42,384
Oscy is outside.
He's bringing the marshmallows.

771
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:44,579
Yeah, I saw him. What are you bringing?

772
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:48,382
I'll see you later Aggie, okay?

773
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:51,490
- Tonight. 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

774
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:10,441
Can I toast you
another tasty marshmallow?

775
01:06:10,914 --> 01:06:12,245
If you like, but...

776
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:15,541
...shouldn't we save a few
for Oscy and Miriam?

777
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,582
We may never see them again.

778
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:22,354
They seem to be getting along very well.

779
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:27,025
Yes, they're very friendly.

780
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:31,766
Hermie.

781
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:37,363
- Excuse me for a moment, please.
- Sure.

782
01:06:37,574 --> 01:06:38,598
Thank you.

783
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:44,169
Hi. Let me see your notes.
Mine are all sweaty and crumpled.

784
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:47,072
Hey, come on. Come on, fork over.

785
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:49,742
- What number you up to?
- Six.

786
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:53,083
Six? Six is foreplay! You up to six?

787
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:55,817
Yeah, but that crazy Miriam.
She's up to nine!

788
01:06:56,326 --> 01:06:58,260
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

789
01:06:58,328 --> 01:06:59,852
She's ruining my timing!

790
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:04,124
Jesus Christ!

791
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:07,736
How you doing with Aggie?

792
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:11,302
- We're up to the marshmallows.
- No time for gabbing, I got to go.

793
01:07:23,153 --> 01:07:24,518
- That was Oscy.
- Yes.

794
01:07:28,992 --> 01:07:31,483
- Feel like another marshmallow?
- What's that paper?

795
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:34,585
This?

796
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:37,156
It's a map.

797
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:40,859
- A buried treasure?
- Yeah. I think so.

798
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:42,165
Can I see it?

799
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,004
Why don't you just have
another marshmallow?

800
01:07:47,744 --> 01:07:48,768
All right.

801
01:07:58,288 --> 01:07:59,152
Hermie.

802
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:02,847
Hermie!

803
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:05,958
- Would you excuse me again?
- Yes.

804
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:07,394
You're very kind.

805
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:11,491
- What?
- Give me a rubber!

806
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:15,731
- What happened to your heirloom?
- It was spoiled. I guess they don't keep.

807
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:18,001
Come on, for Pete's sake!

808
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,043
Come on, it's cold.

809
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:33,888
Don't you even say thank you?

810
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:35,982
Thank you, Hermie.

811
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:46,598
<i>Why did Miriam say, ''Thank you''?</i>

812
01:08:48,338 --> 01:08:50,431
- Because she's a lady.
- Oh, I see.

813
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:54,033
- See what?
- Pardon?

814
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:57,747
- You said you saw. What did you see?
- Actually nothing.

815
01:08:58,882 --> 01:09:01,578
- Then don't say you see when you don't.
- Okay.

816
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:33,405
Need a rubber?

817
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:35,950
I need a breather.

818
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,344
I also need another rubber.

819
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,183
Did you get to Point 12 yet?

820
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:47,389
<i>Twelve? We're so far past 12... </i>

821
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:51,266
But, that's as far as the book goes.
What's after 12?

822
01:09:54,304 --> 01:09:58,070
There's 13 and 14.

823
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:03,405
Fifteen. Hermie, you have no idea.

824
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:07,712
And 16, 17 and 18.

825
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:19,528
I think Miriam and I
should be getting home now.

826
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:23,627
- I'll take you home, come on.
- I think I'd better get Miriam.

827
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:26,195
Hey, Aggie!

828
01:10:26,503 --> 01:10:29,472
No, I don't think so!
Aggie, I'll take you home.

829
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:09,902
Hi.

830
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,106
Hermie, hi.

831
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:16,570
- How have you been?
- Fine, thank you. And you?

832
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,213
- Pretty good.
- Good.

833
01:12:23,653 --> 01:12:25,746
What a beautiful morning!

834
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,447
Should be a really nice day.

835
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,196
How are the boxes we put away?
Any trouble?

836
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,327
No. They're fine. Still up there.

837
01:12:40,937 --> 01:12:42,598
I think they'll be all right.

838
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:53,543
I'd ask you to the movies,
but it's the same picture.

839
01:12:54,851 --> 01:12:56,216
Like to see it again?

840
01:12:57,854 --> 01:12:59,082
No. No thanks.

841
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,355
I don't blame you.

842
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:05,724
Once you know the ending,
it kills the thrill.

843
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:15,802
Tide is coming in.

844
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,831
So it is.

845
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:30,383
Have you any other
heavy objects you want moved?

846
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:33,719
No, none that occur to me.

847
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,119
If you can think of any, feel free.

848
01:13:38,895 --> 01:13:41,125
All right, I will. Thank you.

849
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:55,038
Will you be at home tonight?

850
01:13:56,145 --> 01:13:57,077
Pardon?

851
01:13:57,914 --> 01:14:01,179
Well, I thought I might drop by.
I have to be in the neighborhood.

852
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:07,482
Feel free to drop by.

853
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,927
I'm not saying I can come for sure,
so don't plan on it.

854
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:17,963
It's getting late!

855
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:21,231
I've got to get to the post office
and get these letters off.

856
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:26,699
- I'll run them down for you.
- No, thanks. It's tricky postage, overseas.

857
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,636
Thanks, anyway.

858
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:34,042
Hello!

859
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:36,776
I don't even know your name.

860
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,148
Dorothy.

861
01:14:39,756 --> 01:14:41,781
I had a cat named Dorothy.

862
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,350
Got hit by a truck.

863
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:46,824
'Bye.

864
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:43,275
Hi.

865
01:15:50,026 --> 01:15:52,017
- You know what?
- What?

866
01:15:52,662 --> 01:15:53,856
It's all over.

867
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,527
- What?
- Me and Miriam.

868
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,194
- What happened?
- I'm embarrassed to tell you.

869
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:02,927
- Then don't tell me.
- You won't believe it.

870
01:16:03,206 --> 01:16:06,801
- After last night, I'll believe anything.
- It's not what you think.

871
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:10,646
- Oscy, I'm in kind of a hurry.
- We had an argument this afternoon.

872
01:16:10,713 --> 01:16:13,580
And I went over to her house
to apologize to her.

873
01:16:14,584 --> 01:16:16,211
She's got appendicitis.

874
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:20,280
Took her over to the mainland.
Hope they leave her there.

875
01:16:20,356 --> 01:16:25,293
- I hope they don't cut up her boobs.
- I don't think the scar goes that far.

876
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:29,263
She told me she was breaking our date.
The next thing I know, appendicitis!

877
01:16:29,532 --> 01:16:31,659
Christ, she sure goes to extremes.

878
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:34,425
They loaded her on the speedboat
on a stretcher.

879
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:36,266
Maybe it's all for the better.

880
01:16:36,339 --> 01:16:38,637
For the better?
How can you say such a dumb thing?

881
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,871
- Because I'm not really interested.
- Bullshit! You're interested.

882
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:44,572
You took yourself some long look
at us last night.

883
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:47,582
- We knew you were looking.
- I only caught a glimpse.

884
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:51,214
Will you shut up, Oscy?
I don't want to hear your dirty details.

885
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:54,752
- You don't want me to tell you?
- I don't want to hear about it.

886
01:16:54,824 --> 01:16:57,054
- I was gonna tell you everything.
- Don't!

887
01:16:57,293 --> 01:17:00,558
When you want to hear about it,
I'm not gonna tell you.

888
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,426
Good!

889
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:03,897
Something's wrong with you.
You're not normal.

890
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:04,694
Good!

891
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,701
- Going to her house?
- Screw you.

892
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:08,600
Got your instructions handy?

893
01:17:08,971 --> 01:17:11,166
It's not gonna be that kind of an evening.

894
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,470
You wouldn't understand
because you're so crass.

895
01:17:13,543 --> 01:17:15,272
Crass? What the hell is crass?

896
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:18,142
- Leave me alone!
- What the hell are you so mad about?

897
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:20,305
- I don't know.
- Got your rubbers?

898
01:17:21,217 --> 01:17:22,809
You're a regular comedian!

899
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:25,410
You know what?
I'm sorry I ever tried to help you!

900
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:26,978
Well, that makes two of us.

901
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:29,786
I gave up my binoculars
to get you educated, goddamn it!

902
01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:32,020
- Tough!
- Word's getting out on you, Hermie.

903
01:17:32,161 --> 01:17:33,253
You're a homo.

904
01:17:33,996 --> 01:17:37,022
If you don't cut it out, Oscy,
you're gonna get a fat lip!

905
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:55,172
Homo!

906
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:53,931
Hello.

907
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:27,476
Hello?

908
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:11,115
Dorothy, it's Hermie.

909
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:13,787
Hermie, from the beach.

910
01:21:12,882 --> 01:21:14,008
Hi, Hermie.

911
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:17,174
Hi.

912
01:21:25,194 --> 01:21:27,059
I don't look very nice, do I?

913
01:21:30,299 --> 01:21:31,459
I think you do.

914
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:33,699
I think I don't.

915
01:23:39,828 --> 01:23:40,920
I'm sorry.

916
01:34:22,003 --> 01:34:23,470
Good night, Hermie.

917
01:34:26,975 --> 01:34:28,101
Good night.

918
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:18,676
Miriam pulled through.

919
01:36:23,058 --> 01:36:24,992
I talked to her mother this morning.

920
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:30,456
Jesus, they didn't even operate.

921
01:36:30,999 --> 01:36:32,398
They froze her.

922
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:39,434
I'm relieved about it.

923
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:42,333
She's through for the summer.

924
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:46,506
Won't be back on the island again.

925
01:36:49,784 --> 01:36:51,081
My first lay.

926
01:36:52,153 --> 01:36:53,745
Gone with the wind.

927
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:03,756
Have you seen Benjie anywhere?

928
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:05,966
That rat still has my glasses.

929
01:37:14,676 --> 01:37:18,043
You know, you shouldn't feel so bad,
no matter what happened.

930
01:37:22,283 --> 01:37:24,217
And you don't have to tell me.

931
01:37:27,756 --> 01:37:29,951
But if you want to tell me, you can.

932
01:37:34,028 --> 01:37:36,496
But you don't have to unless you want to.

933
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:53,070
Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass!

934
01:38:06,494 --> 01:38:09,793
I thought maybe we'd attack
the Coast Guard station tonight.

935
01:38:10,565 --> 01:38:12,123
You know, give them a scare.

936
01:41:26,694 --> 01:41:29,390
<i>Dear Hermie, I must go home now. </i>

937
01:41:31,099 --> 01:41:35,160
<i>I'm sure you'll understand,
there's much I have to do. </i>

938
01:41:37,038 --> 01:41:40,337
<i>I won't try and explain
what happened last night... </i>

939
01:41:40,608 --> 01:41:43,076
<i>... because I know that, in time... </i>

940
01:41:43,277 --> 01:41:45,837
<i>... you'll find a proper way
in which to remember it. </i>

941
01:41:47,315 --> 01:41:51,945
<i>What I will do is remember you,
and I pray that... </i>

942
01:41:52,553 --> 01:41:54,748
<i>... you be spared all senseless tragedies. </i>

943
01:41:57,592 --> 01:42:01,392
<i>I wish you good things, Hermie,
only good things. </i>

944
01:42:02,864 --> 01:42:04,525
<i>Always, Dorothy. </i>

945
01:42:10,038 --> 01:42:11,938
<i>I was never to see her again. </i>

946
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:15,437
<i>Nor was I ever to learn
what became of her. </i>

947
01:42:17,512 --> 01:42:20,447
<i>We were different then, kids were different. </i>

948
01:42:22,483 --> 01:42:25,077
<i>It took us longer to understand
the things we felt. </i>

949
01:42:27,055 --> 01:42:29,785
<i>Life is made up
of small comings and goings... </i>

950
01:42:30,892 --> 01:42:35,488
<i>... and for everything we take with us,
there is something that we leave behind. </i>

951
01:42:37,799 --> 01:42:42,702
<i>In the summer of '42, we raided
the Coast Guard station four times. </i>

952
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:46,806
<i>We saw five movies,
and had nine days of rain. </i>

953
01:42:48,276 --> 01:42:50,176
<i>Benjie broke his watch. </i>

954
01:42:50,378 --> 01:42:52,346
<i>Oscy gave up the harmonica. </i>

955
01:42:53,281 --> 01:42:55,272
<i>And in a very speciaI way... </i>

956
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:58,214
<i>... I lost Hermie forever. </i>
