1
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,364
Where is he?

2
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:58,691
I shan't ask you politely next time.

3
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,617
Where is Blofeld?

4
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,293
Cai... Cai...

5
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:07,996
Cairo!

6
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,256
Cards.

7
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,752
Hit me.

8
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,805
One chance.

9
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,760
Where can I find him?

10
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:25,352
Marie...

11
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:26,972
Ask Marie.

12
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:28,563
Who are you?

13
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:33,900
My name is Bond. James Bond.

14
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,435
Is there something I can do for you?

15
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:39,323
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

16
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,819
There is something I'd like you
to get off your chest.

17
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,824
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?

18
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,167
Speak up, darling. I can't hear you.

19
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,297
We now come to phase four: The nose.

20
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:02,087
In my opinion, the most difficult part
of a plastic transformation.

21
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,344
I want the operation done tonight.

22
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,715
- But, señor...
- There's no time left.

23
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,100
But, Señor Blofeld,
this is a most delicate procedure.

24
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:12,055
Tonight!

25
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:26,325
Keep the temperature
at precisely 80 degrees.

26
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:38,598
Making mud pies, 007?

27
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,145
He would have been me
in a matter of days

28
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:48,849
if you'd given the poor fellow a chance.

29
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:52,521
Such a pity. I was dying to see
how the operation turned out.

30
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:54,696
Get his gun.

31
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:57,983
Hold it! Get your hands up.

32
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,633
Kill him!

33
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:47,366
Welcome to hell, Blofeld.

34
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,624
Star of South Africa.

35
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,793
83.5 carats rough.

36
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:53,998
47.5 carats cut.

37
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:57,217
The Akbar Shah. 116 carats rough.

38
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,718
Are you paying attention, 007?

39
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,970
The Akbar Shah, 116 carats rough.

40
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:07,723
But surely, sir, there's no need
to bring in our section

41
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,688
on a relatively simple smuggling matter.

42
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:13,388
Sir Donald has convinced the PM
otherwise.

43
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,277
May I remind you, 007,
that Blofeld's dead.

44
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:17,898
Finished!

45
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,359
The least we can expect from you now
is a little plain, solid work.

46
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,076
Good morning, gentlemen.

47
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:28,369
- Sir Donald will see you now.
- Thank you.

48
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,206
Good morning, Sir Donald.

49
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:34,034
- This is Commander Bond.
- How do you do? Please sit down.

50
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,254
- Sherry?
- Not for me, thanks. Doctor's orders.

51
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,587
- Commander Bond?
- Yes, thank you.

52
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,836
You've been on holiday, I understand.

53
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,009
Relaxing, I hope.

54
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,055
Hardly relaxing but... most satisfying.

55
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:50,223
Cheers.

56
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:55,894
Pity about your liver, sir.
It's an unusually fine Solera.

57
00:08:56,024 --> 00:09:00,151
- '51, I believe.
- There is no year for sherry, 007.

58
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,520
I was referring to the original vintage
on which the sherry is based, sir.

59
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,443
1851.

60
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,286
Unmistakable.

61
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,205
Precisely.

62
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,241
Tell me, Commander.

63
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,242
How far does your expertise extend
into the field of diamonds?

64
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,170
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.

65
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,715
They've replaced a dog
as a girl's best friend. That's about it.

66
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:31,261
Refreshing to hear there's one subject
you're not an expert on.

67
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,135
Perhaps I'd better give you
a brief background into our problem.

68
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,097
Eighty per cent of the world's diamonds
come from mines in South Africa.

69
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:44,850
Most are dug out of shafts
of diamond-bearing clay

70
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,729
at depths of up to 3,000 feet.

71
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:52,403
The whole process, from start to finish,
is subject to an airtight security system.

72
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:54,574
It's an essential precaution,

73
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:58,950
though the industry prides itself on
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.

74
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,705
Naturally the security measures
tend to ensure that loyalty,

75
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,918
as do the extensive amenities
and social services we provide.

76
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,885
There's a permanent staff
of doctors, nurses,

77
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,554
even dentists.

78
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,306
The whole process, from start to finish,
is subject to an airtight security system.

79
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:19,976
It's a necessary precaution,

80
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:23,934
though the industry prides itself on
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.

81
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:25,060
Next!

82
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:32,978
The scorpion.

83
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:35,652
Mother nature's finest killer, Mr. Wint.

84
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:39,282
One is never too old
to learn from a master, Mr. Kidd.

85
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,342
Dr. Tynan? Good evening.

86
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:07,601
Who are you? And where is Joe?

87
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,770
Joe couldn't make it tonight.

88
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,726
I'm Mr. Wint.

89
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:13,686
This is Mr. Kidd.

90
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:18,527
I see.

91
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,460
What's the matter with him?

92
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,590
It's my wisdom teeth.
I haven't had 'em out yet.

93
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:41,006
Would you mind having a look, Doctor?

94
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:42,678
Of course.

95
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,963
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.

96
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,138
No, no. Open wide.

97
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:01,567
Curious

98
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:05,446
how everyone who touches
those diamonds seems to... die.

99
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:22,458
- Stop right there! Who are you?
- Dr. Tynan sent us.

100
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,676
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.

101
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,843
Bitten by the bug.

102
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,011
He sent this for you.

103
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,649
If God had wanted man to fly...

104
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:47,610
He would have given him wings, Mr. Kidd.

105
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,918
No security system is perfect.

106
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:03,128
We've always accepted
a percentage of smuggling.

107
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:08,212
But over the past two years, despite all
our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.

108
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:11,178
And none of the stones
have reached the market.

109
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:13,877
Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.

110
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:19,174
Our concern is that someone might dump
them on the market to depress prices or...

111
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,885
Make you agree to perpetual blackmail.

112
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,647
Exactly.

113
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:27,771
What we need to know is

114
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:30,607
who the stockpilers are.

115
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,363
The letter U

116
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,317
is for umbrella.

117
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,489
We take it lest it rain.

118
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,741
We hope we shan't want it

119
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,910
till we're home again.

120
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,080
Two men to see you, missy.

121
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,248
Gentlemen, Joshua.

122
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:49,375
I shan't be long, children.
Joshua is going to read you a story.

123
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,796
How nice to see you again!

124
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,008
- Where to this time?
- Amsterdam.

125
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:58,176
Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely!

126
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:02,553
I shall have to bring back some pictures
of the canals for the children.

127
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:05,472
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs. Whistler.

128
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,100
Thus endeth the lesson
for today, gentlemen.

129
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:16,363
Several recent murders in South Africa
have complicated matters.

130
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,692
If they shut down operations
before we discover them...

131
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,866
It would be catastrophic for us

132
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,071
and for the government.

133
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:28,250
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.

134
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,293
For some time we've had our eyes
on a smuggler - Peter Franks.

135
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:35,414
He's due to leave for Amsterdam.

136
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,541
Do we know who his contacts are?

137
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,761
We do function
in your absence, Commander.

138
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,348
Passport, sir?

139
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:53,393
Mr. Franks. There's a message
for you at Passport Control.

140
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,193
That door over there.
You can park outside.

141
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:57,942
Thank you.

142
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,133
Mr. Franks...

143
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:28,386
Your passport is quite in order.

144
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:31,302
Anyone seeing you
in that outfit, Moneypenny,

145
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,637
would certainly be discouraged
from leaving the country.

146
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,893
What can I bring you back from Holland?

147
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,683
A diamond?

148
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,441
In a ring?

149
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:46,105
Would you settle for a tulip?

150
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,190
Yes.

151
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,837
Ahead is one of
the oldest bridges in Amsterdam.

152
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,883
The Skinny Bridge.

153
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,058
It was built over 300 years ago

154
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:21,306
by two sisters who wanted
to visit each other every day.

155
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,232
Unfortunately they ran out of money. So
that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge.

156
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,112
On your right,
those beautiful old houses

157
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:33,022
can be seen in the paintings
of our famous painter, Rembrandt.

158
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,198
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

159
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,705
if you will look to your left
as we go down the Amstel, you can see...

160
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:53,753
Mrs. Whistler did want some pictures
of the canals for the children.

161
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,508
How kind of you, Mr. Kidd.

162
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,177
The children will be so thrilled.

163
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,540
Yes?

164
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,705
Franks. Peter Franks.

165
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:29,542
Come up. Third floor.

166
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,138
Make yourself at home!
I'll be out in a minute!

167
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:57,233
Help yourself to a drink!

168
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:00,403
Is Mr. Case not at home?

169
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:04,031
There is no Mr. Case. The T is for Tiffany.

170
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,826
Tiffany Case?

171
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,995
Definitely distinctive.

172
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,413
I was born there, on the first floor,

173
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:15,414
while my mother was
looking for a wedding ring.

174
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:18,915
I'm glad for your sake
it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.

175
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,803
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?

176
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,507
Could be.

177
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,218
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.

178
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:34,393
And which do you prefer?

179
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,151
Providing the collars and cuffs match...

180
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:40,315
We'll talk about that later.

181
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,484
Let me have your glass.

182
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,652
I'll get you some ice.

183
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:17,639
That's quite a nice little nothing
you're almost wearing. I approve.

184
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,810
I don't dress for the hired help.

185
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,062
Let's see your passport, Franks.

186
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,318
Occupation: Transport consultant?

187
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,071
That's a little cute, isn't it?

188
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:33,948
- I'll finish dressing.
- Please don't. Not on my account.

189
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:19,320
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.

190
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,493
But somehow it seems to suit you.

191
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,661
It's my own.

192
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,032
But it is in need of some soft lighting.

193
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:30,000
- I know a little restaurant...
- I never mix business with pleasure.

194
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:32,004
- Neither do I.
- Good!

195
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:37,090
Then save the cute remarks until after
you get the diamonds into Los Angeles.

196
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,304
- Where are they now?
- That's not your problem.

197
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:42,388
Your problem is getting them in.

198
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,972
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.

199
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:50,523
At 142 carats an ounce, that's
an awful lot of ice. That won't be easy.

200
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,105
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.

201
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:56,770
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?

202
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:01,199
And, Franks, for God's sakes,
come up with something original.

203
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:10,081
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.

204
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,874
An obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.

205
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:18,962
M's been trying to get in touch with you.
That Peter Franks fellow's escaped.

206
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:21,927
Killed one of the guards
on the way up to London.

207
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,133
Hello?

208
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,636
Hello!

209
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,806
Are you there?

210
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:51,702
- Yes?
- Peter Franks.

211
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,871
Third floor.

212
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,040
- Guten Abend.
- Good evening.

213
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:58,872
Bitte.

214
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,377
- You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.

215
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:05,506
I speak English.

216
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:10,546
- Who is... your floor?
- Three, please.

217
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,984
Is he dead?

218
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,151
I sincerely hope so.

219
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,785
- Who is he?
- No idea.

220
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:52,950
This chap's been following me
all day today.

221
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:58,581
My God!

222
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,292
You've just killed James Bond!

223
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:09,262
Is that who it was?

224
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:12,345
It just proves no one's indestructible.

225
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,177
You don't kill James Bond and
wait around for the cops to arrive!

226
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,148
We've got to get those diamonds
out of here fast!

227
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:20,900
Where are they?

228
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:26,563
A little old lady dropped them by
yesterday morning.

229
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,991
Priceless.

230
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,327
I think we ought to let Mr. Bond
carry the load from here on out.

231
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:50,927
It's funny.

232
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:55,348
All the things one wanted to say
to one's brother... when it's all too late.

233
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:58,180
Let me assure you
of our deepest condolences.

234
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:00,684
Would you please board the aircraft?

235
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:06,602
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr. Franks.

236
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:14,441
Lufthansa announce the departure
of flight LH450 to Los Angeles.

237
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:21,870
Please fasten your seat belts,
and no smoking until airborne.

238
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,625
Thank you.

239
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:29,579
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.

240
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:31,755
For a lady.

241
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:43,143
Lufthansa announce the arrival
of flight LH450 from Amsterdam...

242
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,310
- Mr. Franks?
- Yes.

243
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,478
Follow me to Customs, please.

244
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,525
Peter Franks, Jerry.

245
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,744
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.

246
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,956
Death certificate, please, Mr. Franks.

247
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,088
Well, well, well!
Felix Leiter, you old fraud.

248
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:19,167
On behalf of the CIA,
welcome to America.

249
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,848
Someone sent their brain trust
down to meet you.

250
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:35,268
I give up. I know
the diamonds are in the body,

251
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:37,194
but where?

252
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:39,360
Alimentary, Dr. Leiter.

253
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,740
So long, James. Keep in touch.

254
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:50,573
The rest of your luggage
has been cleared, Mr. Franks. OK, fellas!

255
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:15,273
You wanna sit in the front, Mr. Franks?

256
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:18,269
It's a lot smoother ride
in the front, Mr. Franks.

257
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:20,773
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.

258
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:45,504
The stiff - deceased back there.

259
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,674
Your brother, Mr. Franks?

260
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:49,842
Yes, it was.

261
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:52,011
I got a brudder.

262
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,309
Small world.

263
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,831
Mr. Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.

264
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,420
Please accept my heartfelt condolences
at this most difficult hour.

265
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,750
He is heading
for a better world, Mr. Slumber.

266
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,090
There is some consolation in that.

267
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,422
Now then, if we're ready
to begin the final journey...

268
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,666
May his soul rest in peace.

269
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,210
Oh, yes. Amen.

270
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:18,387
If you'd come into my comfortable office,
we will bring you the urn.

271
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:22,641
I'm so happy you chose our half-couch,
hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.

272
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,767
I'm sure your brother
would have appreciated it.

273
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:27,934
I'm sure he did.

274
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:30,102
Please, be seated.

275
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:56,002
Ashes to ashes...

276
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,963
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.

277
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:03,339
At a moment like this, I'm sure
you'd rather be left alone, for reflection.

278
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:05,013
Most thoughtful.

279
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:09,267
We've selected a private niche for your
brother in our Garden of Remembrance.

280
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:13,522
The one with the restful chartreuse
curtains and Angel's Breath gold trim.

281
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:15,687
I hope you'll find everything in order.

282
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:18,142
The arrangements
have been impeccable

283
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,688
so far.

284
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,934
Very... moving.

285
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:44,103
Heart-warming, Mr. Wint.

286
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:46,271
A glowing tribute, Mr. Kidd.

287
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:40,443
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink!
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies!

288
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:46,489
No, don't tell me. You're St. Peter?

289
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,293
Paste! Glass!
Where's the real stuff, Franks?

290
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:53,712
Where's the real money? You wouldn't
burn 50,000 real dollars, would you?

291
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,508
One last break.
Where are the real diamonds?

292
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,672
You get me the real money

293
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:01,257
and I'll bring you the real diamonds.

294
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:03,427
Where do you think you're goin'?

295
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:06,723
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana
is quite comfortable.

296
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:08,891
My condolences, gentlemen.

297
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,224
Hello, Felix.

298
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:13,929
Very comfortable.
But there's one problem.

299
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:16,639
I want the real merchandise -
rather quickly.

300
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:20,311
Q has just arrived with it.
We'll be up with them in the morning.

301
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:24,575
So I'd sit tight if I were you.
There's no sense in looking for trouble.

302
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:27,904
Just enjoy yourself, James.
I'm sure you know how.

303
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:30,077
Quite. I'll probably take in a show.

304
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:15,196
How do you like me so far?

305
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:17,869
People say I have
the body of Rock Hudson.

306
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:21,914
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it,
he'll be madder than hell.

307
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:23,790
I call these girls my Acorns.

308
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:28,549
Actually, they're a gift from Willard Whyte,
who is upstairs right now

309
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:31,512
playing Monopoly with real buildings.

310
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:37,683
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like
tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.

311
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:41,642
On behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know

312
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,813
you've been a lousy audience.

313
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,981
So get lost. See ya later.

314
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:07,960
Shady Tree!

315
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:14,126
- Shady, we just adored your act!
- What taste, style!

316
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:16,337
And we have a few suggestions.

317
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:20,600
Critics and material I don't need!
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.

318
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:28,394
Hold it! Don't go in there.

319
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,977
We didn't get the real diamonds,
so we need Tree - alive.

320
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:36,153
That's most annoying.

321
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:57,923
- Get down there!
- Crap. Boxcar, the loser.

322
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:01,137
That's it, pussycat.
I shot the whole wad.

323
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:03,304
What do you say? Back to my place?

324
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:06,433
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.

325
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:10,060
Why don't you go and take a nap?
And I'll see you next year.

326
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:14,227
May I have $5,000? No, make it $10,000.

327
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,853
$2,000 limit.

328
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,190
Is there some problem?

329
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:23,364
Mr. Saxby.

330
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:27,325
Gentleman wants $10,000 credit
with a $2,000 limit.

331
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:29,613
My name is Franks.

332
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,907
Peter Franks.

333
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,498
Mr. Franks' credit's good.

334
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:38,294
- Good luck to you, Mr. Franks.
- Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.

335
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,798
Give the gentleman 4,000.

336
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,588
Thank you.

337
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,761
Hi! I'm Plenty.

338
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,381
- But of course you are.
- Plenty O'Toole.

339
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,516
Named after your father, perhaps?

340
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,599
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.

341
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,771
That's very kind of you.

342
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,193
Coming out. Coming out.

343
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,523
Next shooter is a lady.
Ladies are lucky. For the lady.

344
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,066
Nine. Mark nine.

345
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:15,743
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.

346
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:19,460
New shooter. Your shot, Mr. F.

347
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:31,553
- Willard Whyte speakin'.
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.

348
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,599
It's Peter Franks.

349
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,766
Hard ten. Ten's the number.

350
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,268
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.

351
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:50,029
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.

352
00:38:50,157 --> 00:38:53,193
Say! You've played this game before!

353
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,366
Just once.

354
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,914
- Now what do we do?
- Don't bother me with details, Bert!

355
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,999
Just get me the diamonds!

356
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:10,884
You handle those cubes
like a monkey handles coconuts.

357
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,877
Thank you, gentlemen,
for such a sterling service.

358
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:17,054
That's 50,000 dollars!

359
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:21,476
Minus $5,000 for you... leaves me
$45,000, and thank you very much.

360
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:23,643
It was nothing, really!

361
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:28,311
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy!

362
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:30,649
A little weird, but a terrific guy!

363
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:33,565
Why don't we go someplace
and have a drink?

364
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:34,896
A drink?

365
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:40,117
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.

366
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:43,661
How pretty!
What a super place you have!

367
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:05,181
Just give me one second, lover.

368
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:17,487
Good evening.

369
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:25,404
I'm afraid you've caught me
with more than my hands up.

370
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:29,665
What the hell is this?!
A perverts' convention or something?!

371
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,701
You can't do this to me!

372
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:35,287
Stop that! I've got friends in this town!

373
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,468
Exceptionally fine shot.

374
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:48,505
I didn't know there was
a pool down there.

375
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:56,055
Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...

376
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,562
The real diamonds.

377
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:19,078
Good evening, Miss Case.

378
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:27,554
Sorry about your fulsome friend.

379
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,348
I'll bet you really missed something.

380
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:33,890
The evening may not be
a total loss after all.

381
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,723
Why don't we talk a bit first?

382
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:38,894
First?

383
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:41,894
What would you like to talk about?

384
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:45,233
You pick a subject.

385
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:47,604
- Diamonds?
- Good boy!

386
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,284
And you want to know where they are,
and whether I'm working alone or not.

387
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:55,867
So far, so good. Keep going.

388
00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:59,247
And if not, then with whom.

389
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:02,117
So you can inform your superiors and...

390
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:05,377
acquire the diamonds.

391
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:06,917
Peter!

392
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,088
I'm very impressed.

393
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:12,385
There's a lot more to you
than I had expected.

394
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:15,218
Presumably I'm the condemned man,

395
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:18,433
and obviously you're the hearty breakfast.

396
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,841
Right?

397
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:26,646
You're not going to tell me
where the diamonds are, are you?

398
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:28,857
What diamonds?

399
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:31,276
Sooner or later you'll have to talk.

400
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,445
They'll make you.

401
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:36,943
At the very least, you'll never
get out of town alive.

402
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,910
I can solve that little problem.

403
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,621
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.

404
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:50,794
Fifty-fifty split.

405
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:54,374
You get the diamonds, I get us out.

406
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:56,053
Us?

407
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:59,594
I can't very well help you
and then stick around.

408
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:03,555
We could be on a plane and
out of the country by tomorrow night.

409
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:06,520
Rio... Hong Kong...

410
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,687
I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.

411
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:10,855
Hong Kong.

412
00:43:11,652 --> 00:43:15,566
All right. I'll get the diamonds,
you get the plane tickets.

413
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:17,736
No. The airport's too obvious.

414
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:20,535
A rented car should
do us fine for openers.

415
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,699
That's good thinking.

416
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:27,989
And since you're the one being watched,
I'll get the diamonds, you get the car.

417
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:30,165
That's very good thinking.

418
00:43:30,294 --> 00:43:32,251
Oh, Peter!

419
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:36,922
I have a feeling this is the beginning
of a wonderful relationship.

420
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,555
Darling...

421
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,725
Where do I pick up the diamonds?

422
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:54,941
When was the last time
you visited a circus?

423
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:58,608
Circus Circus proudly presents

424
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:01,524
the Flying Palacios!

425
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,212
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.

426
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,181
James, next time, pick a contact point
when you're standing up.

427
00:44:33,311 --> 00:44:37,854
- Felix, if she gives your men the slip...
- Relax. I have 30 agents down there.

428
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:40,686
A mouse with sneakers on
couldn't get through.

429
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:06,963
Give Maxwell his cue.

430
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:08,468
This is Quarterback.

431
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:10,634
Operation Passover, commence.

432
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:12,802
Quarterback to Tight End.

433
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:15,090
Operation Passover, commence.

434
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:17,886
Roger.

435
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:50,998
She's on her way. So far, so good.

436
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:54,585
- Good luck, Felix. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?

437
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,843
The car rental agency.

438
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:59,178
Our little rendezvous?

439
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:03,306
You don't actually think she'll show up?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.

440
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:05,062
No, more like even money.

441
00:46:05,189 --> 00:46:09,233
Her devotion to larceny
versus my... incomparable charm.

442
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:19,241
All right, kiddies!
Ready? Aim! Fire!

443
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,120
What did I tell you?
Didn't I promise you a winner every time?

444
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,289
There you are, young man.

445
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:32,163
Boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...

446
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:35,915
Here we have a little lady,
here we have a little man,

447
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,090
and here we have a big lady.

448
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:41,422
You're a little out of your league,
aren't ya, sister?

449
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:43,513
Point the gun. You know what to do.

450
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:45,717
All ready? Get set.

451
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:48,010
Now hold it till I say go.

452
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:48,810
Go!

453
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:51,640
Come on! That's it!

454
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:55,356
Everybody point right at the clown.
A winner every time!

455
00:46:57,487 --> 00:47:00,274
There we are! All right!
That's the way to do it!

456
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,243
Look at that!
And we have another winner!

457
00:47:07,413 --> 00:47:09,655
Annie Oakley on the end!

458
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,241
Here we are. What an eye! What an eye!

459
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,046
Wait a second!
I saw the whole thing!

460
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:18,709
The machine's fixed!
Who's she - your mother?

461
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,879
Blow up your pants!

462
00:47:22,845 --> 00:47:25,051
One win! She only had one win!

463
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,753
You're supposed to have 24
to win that dog!

464
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:29,930
Will you give it a rest, kid?

465
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:32,467
All right, boys and girls! Here we go!

466
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:07,833
Here for the first time, see Zambora,
strangest girl ever born to live.

467
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,840
She was captured
near Nairobi, south Africa,

468
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:14,673
and is believed to be part of a cruel,
inhuman experiment.

469
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,889
This beautiful girl
will be locked into a steel cage,

470
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:23,518
will change very slowly
into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla.

471
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:28,525
Please be very still, ladies and gentlemen.

472
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,695
We must have absolute silence

473
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,738
so we wouldn't disturb Zambora
from her transcendental state.

474
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,369
We must warn you that
in every scientific experiment

475
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,491
there's always a danger.

476
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,199
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.

477
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:47,499
God forbid something should go wrong
over here, get outta here!

478
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:53,043
Now we start the transformation.

479
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:56,464
Very dangerous. Very quiet, please.

480
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:26,205
Wake, my beauty, wake!

481
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:42,345
Hey, lady, not through there.
The other way.

482
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:46,810
Come on!

483
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:13,170
- No show?
- Felix, don't tell me you lost her?

484
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:15,038
We lost her.

485
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,428
Nice place you have here.

486
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,680
Take something off. Enjoy the sun.

487
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:31,217
You've got a lot of guts showing up here!

488
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:34,936
Letting me freeze my behind off
at a blackjack table for two hours

489
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,272
waiting for some nonexistent diamonds!

490
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,604
And what the hell
is my black wig doing in the pool?!

491
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:58,791
- She's...
- Dead.

492
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:02,005
Supposed to be you.
The next link in the pipeline.

493
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:05,547
What are you talking about?

494
00:51:05,677 --> 00:51:09,212
Poor Plenty must have
stumbled in here looking for you.

495
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,387
I don't believe you.

496
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:15,644
A dentist is dead in South Africa.
That little old lady in Amsterdam.

497
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:18,641
Shady got his last night.
They've missed me once.

498
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:20,647
And you're next.

499
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:23,776
- Now, who's your connection?
- You sound like a cop...

500
00:51:25,112 --> 00:51:29,192
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.

501
00:51:29,324 --> 00:51:33,368
They got me this place and told me
to wait for further instructions.

502
00:51:33,496 --> 00:51:35,951
You'd find it difficult to hear under water.

503
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:38,619
- Now, where's the stuff?
- Who are you?

504
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,455
You're not a cop
and you're not Peter Franks.

505
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:44,587
You're not the type to turn
the other cheek. Where is it?

506
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:50,081
Eastern Airlines announce the arrival
of flight 112 from Los Angeles,

507
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:52,128
gate 7.

508
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:23,957
Thank you.

509
00:52:54,988 --> 00:52:57,111
Fill it up, please.

510
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,782
It's Bert Saxby.

511
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:01,743
Willard Whyte's right-hand man.

512
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:09,123
Do you see the top? The penthouse?

513
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:13,296
They say Willard Whyte hasn't
set foot out of there in three years.

514
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:15,461
And no one has seen him - no one.

515
00:53:20,053 --> 00:53:22,674
- How much is that?
- Did you pay for this?

516
00:53:22,805 --> 00:53:24,299
Cut him off.

517
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:36,648
Hey, Curly! What about my stamps?

518
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,983
Where are you going?
Are you mad? Let me by!

519
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:41,069
Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet!

520
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:45,444
- OK, so shove a coupla gallons in!
- Well, back it up.

521
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:52,785
Keep leaning on that tooter, Charlie,
and you'll get a shot in the mouth!

522
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,495
Come on, lady, move it!

523
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:57,034
OK, lady, you win, you win.

524
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:02,215
- Will someone move that car?!
- Do what he says!

525
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:07,382
Hey! I wanted high-test!

526
00:54:08,431 --> 00:54:11,717
Forget it, Curly!
You had your chance and you blew it!

527
00:55:18,163 --> 00:55:19,787
OK, Professor.

528
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:44,659
- Hello.
- Hi.

529
00:56:44,786 --> 00:56:48,285
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

530
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:51,498
- New here?
- I've been here three years. G Section.

531
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:53,748
How are things in G Section?

532
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:56,084
Still the same old grind. You know.

533
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,213
Checking radiation shields
for replacement.

534
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:01,463
By the way, where's yours?

535
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:06,172
I've been waiting a couple of days
for you guys to deliver them.

536
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:09,675
Gee, I'm sorry. You should have
given us a phone call.

537
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:13,225
Look, I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.

538
00:57:13,354 --> 00:57:17,019
You keep that on. You can't be
too careful about radiation.

539
00:57:17,149 --> 00:57:19,770
Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.

540
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:21,941
See you around.

541
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:49,508
Who are you? What do you want?

542
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:51,761
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.

543
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,760
Just... checking on radiation shields.

544
00:57:54,893 --> 00:57:56,766
Now let me see. You are...?

545
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:59,646
Professor Dr. Metz. Our shields are fine!

546
00:57:59,772 --> 00:58:01,349
Now get out!

547
00:58:01,482 --> 00:58:04,187
I'm sorry. It won't take a moment but

548
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,358
I must verify.

549
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:08,859
Metz. How do you spell it?

550
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:12,405
M- E... Will you please leave,
you irritating man?

551
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,819
Doctor, there's no reason
to run down the little people.

552
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:19,702
G Section may not be as important
to the operation as you are,

553
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:21,660
but we do have our orders.

554
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,833
Dr. Metz... Willard Whyte for you.

555
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:26,001
Right. Out, out.

556
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:31,836
Hello, WW.

557
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,008
Yes, it's finally here.

558
00:58:35,722 --> 00:58:37,845
Quite enough for completion.

559
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:42,016
We'll be through shortly.

560
00:58:42,146 --> 00:58:44,138
No. No problems at all.

561
00:58:46,483 --> 00:58:48,107
Right.

562
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:55,189
- Now will you get out of here?!
- Certainly, Doctor.

563
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,530
I've seen everything I need to see.

564
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,699
Thank you very much.

565
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:06,290
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

566
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,457
G Section.

567
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,338
Checking radiation shields?

568
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:31,811
There he is! Behind the rock! Come on!

569
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:36,728
What is this? Amateur night?

570
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:38,902
Stop him, Harry!

571
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,449
Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy.

572
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:48,075
Get out of that moon buggy!

573
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:18,484
It's gone berserk!

574
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:22,943
Hey, what do you think you're doin'?!

575
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:06,665
That way!

576
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:07,760
- What happened? The diamonds...
- Get in the car!

577
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:11,174
If you see a mad professor
in a minibus, just smile!

578
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,990
Fred, get the sheriff's office.

579
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:44,423
Drop me off at the next corner.
This is getting out of hand.

580
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,138
When you start stealing moon machines
from Willard Whyte,

581
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:49,760
goodbye and good luck!

582
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:53,558
Just relax. I have a friend named Felix
who can fix anything.

583
01:03:53,688 --> 01:03:56,262
Is he married?

584
01:03:58,444 --> 01:04:01,648
There goes that
son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur!

585
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:16,668
Relax! You've got a friend
named Felix who can fix anything.

586
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:19,003
Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte.

587
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:26,338
Why, you dirty...

588
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:49,921
Come in, Larry. Larry?

589
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:52,467
Larry?

590
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:54,634
Did you get him, Larry?

591
01:06:56,264 --> 01:06:58,304
I think Larry got him.

592
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:00,473
- Sheriff...
- Attaboy, Larry.

593
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:02,228
Come in. Larry?

594
01:07:02,355 --> 01:07:03,730
Sheriff...

595
01:07:19,707 --> 01:07:20,953
I got you now.

596
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,830
Lean over.

597
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:01,418
Darling...

598
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:05,672
Why are we suddenly staying
in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?

599
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:09,050
In order to form
a more perfect union, sweetheart.

600
01:08:09,178 --> 01:08:10,803
James...

601
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:14,476
May I finally call you James?

602
01:08:17,812 --> 01:08:19,852
What's going to happen to me?

603
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:25,147
You did talk to
your friend Felix about me?

604
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:28,406
What did he say?

605
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:31,948
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.

606
01:08:32,077 --> 01:08:34,914
- 20 years to life?!
- Relax, darling.

607
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,365
I'm on top of the situation.

608
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:49,594
Mr. and Mrs. Jones?

609
01:08:49,723 --> 01:08:52,592
Yes, that's the name
on the register, Mr. Leiter.

610
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:55,644
- What's the score with WW?
- Washington says no go.

611
01:08:55,771 --> 01:08:57,810
- We sit still for now.
- Sit still?

612
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:02,817
And Miss Tiffany Case "Jones" has
a lifetime reservation at another hotel.

613
01:09:02,946 --> 01:09:05,068
The kind the government... runs.

614
01:09:05,281 --> 01:09:07,571
I'm cooperating, Mr. Leiter.

615
01:09:07,702 --> 01:09:09,528
Really I am.

616
01:09:09,662 --> 01:09:11,700
I can vouch for that.

617
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:15,449
Felix, this is not the real White House,
and he's not the president.

618
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:19,083
- Why don't we go and see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.

619
01:09:19,212 --> 01:09:22,915
But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.

620
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:25,885
In the meantime, I'm sure
you and "Mrs. Jones"

621
01:09:26,012 --> 01:09:28,255
can find some way to amuse yourselves.

622
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:32,434
And just to make sure you're not
disturbed, I have a man upstairs.

623
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,563
And Hamilton... is right out here.

624
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,729
So long, James.

625
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:40,314
- Well, that's a switch!
- What's that?

626
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:43,530
The wolf being guarded
by the three little pigs.

627
01:09:45,408 --> 01:09:47,865
I won't be long, darling.

628
01:09:47,996 --> 01:09:50,154
Where are you going?

629
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:52,958
I'm just popping upstairs for a moment.

630
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:05,298
- Sixteenth floor?
- No, lady. Starlight Lounge only.

631
01:10:06,223 --> 01:10:09,724
OK, folks. Stand clear
of the doors. Here we go.

632
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:53,730
Starlight Lounge to the left.
Express to street level only, folks.

633
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:57,311
OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.

634
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,522
Howdy, son. We've been expectin' you.

635
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,944
You got any personal business
to take care of in there,

636
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,952
you go right ahead.

637
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,653
First, I suspect you're wearin' a hog leg.

638
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,497
Would you mind standin' up
and takin' it off?

639
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:48,005
Isn't that nice?

640
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:50,174
You are a pleasant fella.

641
01:13:51,387 --> 01:13:53,428
Why don't you just come on in, son?

642
01:13:53,558 --> 01:13:55,846
Relax. Make yourself comfortable.

643
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:58,098
That's good. Right on over there.

644
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:21,335
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

645
01:14:21,463 --> 01:14:22,838
Blofeld.

646
01:14:25,425 --> 01:14:27,253
Good evening, 007.

647
01:14:31,014 --> 01:14:32,592
Double jeopardy, Mr. Bond.

648
01:14:32,724 --> 01:14:36,260
You killed my only other double,
I'm afraid.

649
01:14:36,396 --> 01:14:41,023
After his death, volunteers were
- understandably - rather scarce.

650
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:43,772
Such a pity. All that time and expense

651
01:14:43,903 --> 01:14:47,356
simply to provide you
with one mock-heroic moment.

652
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,202
Willard Whyte speakin'.

653
01:14:57,543 --> 01:14:59,751
Yes, Governor. I got your message.

654
01:14:59,881 --> 01:15:03,463
No, I'm afraid a personal appearance
is quite out of the question.

655
01:15:03,592 --> 01:15:06,213
I'll send a deposition to the committee.

656
01:15:07,055 --> 01:15:09,094
Thank you, Governor.

657
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:12,433
Well, that's a neat trick.

658
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,600
A voice box, Mr. Bond.

659
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:16,971
Science was never my strong suit,

660
01:15:17,107 --> 01:15:19,395
but the principle is easy enough.

661
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:22,226
Someone's voice patterns and resonance

662
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:25,233
stored in a small oral-signature tape.

663
01:15:25,366 --> 01:15:29,447
And a miniature, transistorized version
is installed in his neck.

664
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:31,785
Or is it his neck? I never can remember.

665
01:15:31,915 --> 01:15:34,750
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.

666
01:15:37,254 --> 01:15:39,293
My congratulations to you both.

667
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:45,342
Nice little company.

668
01:15:47,182 --> 01:15:50,551
Explosives, oil, electronics,
houses, aviation.

669
01:15:50,685 --> 01:15:52,808
I've done rather well with it, too.

670
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:57,185
Tried to cut some of the fat off,
but Mr. Whyte's a splendid administrator.

671
01:15:57,317 --> 01:15:59,144
Damn thing runs itself.

672
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:01,106
I suppose you killed him.

673
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:02,899
Nothing so melodramatic.

674
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:06,116
I'm simply holding him
in cold storage, so to speak.

675
01:16:06,245 --> 01:16:10,372
An insurance policy against any
outside interference with my plans.

676
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,118
The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.

677
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:16,791
Who'd miss someone
who's already missing?

678
01:16:16,922 --> 01:16:18,998
How clever you are, Mr. Bond.

679
01:16:19,133 --> 01:16:23,712
Nice to see you haven't lost
that fine mental edge, 007.

680
01:16:23,847 --> 01:16:26,386
Please don't get any foolish notions.

681
01:16:26,518 --> 01:16:28,973
That missile is not a practical weapon.

682
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:33,732
Well, it's hardly worth the effort.

683
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:37,395
After all, I wouldn't know
which one of you to kill.

684
01:16:37,528 --> 01:16:40,151
We appreciate
your predicament, Mr. Bond.

685
01:16:40,282 --> 01:16:42,240
We deeply sympathize.

686
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,922
Right idea, Mr. Bond.

687
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:05,382
But wrong pussy.

688
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:09,386
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr. Bond.

689
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:13,651
However potentially painful they may be.

690
01:17:13,777 --> 01:17:16,233
But I'm afraid this one
has come to an end.

691
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:19,198
What do you intend to do
with those diamonds?

692
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:21,364
An excellent question.

693
01:17:21,495 --> 01:17:25,029
And one which will be hanging
on the lips of the world quite soon.

694
01:17:25,164 --> 01:17:27,323
If I were to break the news to anyone,

695
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:30,032
it would be to you first. You know that.

696
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,625
But it's late, I'm tired,

697
01:17:32,757 --> 01:17:34,797
and there's so much left to do.

698
01:17:37,927 --> 01:17:39,969
Good night, Mr. Bond.

699
01:17:47,564 --> 01:17:50,351
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.

700
01:17:50,483 --> 01:17:52,774
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".

701
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:58,815
In any event, I'm sure
you'll find it much more convenient

702
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:02,238
than mountaineering about
outside the Whyte House.

703
01:18:02,372 --> 01:18:04,411
You press L, Mr. Bond.

704
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,831
The word "lobby" begins with L.

705
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:42,078
If at first you don't succeed, Mr. Kidd...

706
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:44,246
Try, try again, Mr. Wint.

707
01:21:52,543 --> 01:21:54,998
One of us smells like
a tart's handkerchief.

708
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:05,432
I'm afraid it's me.
Sorry about that, old boy.

709
01:22:45,768 --> 01:22:49,634
I don't mind the cockamamie machine
breaking down twice a day.

710
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:54,730
But why the hell does it always have to be
500 yards away from the nearest hatch?

711
01:22:57,154 --> 01:23:00,405
All right, Charlie.
It's your turn to play hunchback.

712
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,411
Thank you very much.

713
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,204
I was just out walking my rat
and I seem to have lost my way.

714
01:23:14,758 --> 01:23:16,251
Willard Whyte speakin'.

715
01:23:16,383 --> 01:23:18,423
This is Bert.

716
01:23:20,222 --> 01:23:22,049
We got a problem.

717
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:26,635
What's wrong with your voice?
Got a cold?

718
01:23:29,982 --> 01:23:32,023
Never mind about that.

719
01:23:32,152 --> 01:23:34,192
I just saw James Bond in the casino.

720
01:23:34,321 --> 01:23:37,275
- That's impossible.
- Come and see for yourself.

721
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:39,033
Hey, listen.

722
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,943
If he's half the genius they say he is,
we're in for real trouble.

723
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:46,331
- Calm down, Bert.
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.

724
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:49,080
This place must be
crawling with agents by now.

725
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:52,000
- I think we should move Willard Whyte.
- Nonsense.

726
01:23:52,133 --> 01:23:55,003
Mr. Whyte is perfectly safe
at his own summerhouse.

727
01:23:55,135 --> 01:23:57,626
It's on the ridge,
about ten miles out of town.

728
01:23:57,762 --> 01:24:01,049
I'm a little surprised, Bert.
It's not like you to panic.

729
01:24:01,184 --> 01:24:04,967
I just don't enjoy messing around
with a guy as tough as James Bond.

730
01:24:05,105 --> 01:24:08,556
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.

731
01:24:08,691 --> 01:24:12,358
I'm afraid Mr. Whyte has suddenly
outgrown his usefulness.

732
01:24:12,488 --> 01:24:14,646
- Do it cleanly, Bert.
- Don't worry.

733
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:16,820
Just leave everything to me.

734
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:22,285
That ridiculous contraption
actually seems to work, Q.

735
01:24:22,415 --> 01:24:24,787
You've surpassed yourself this time.

736
01:24:24,917 --> 01:24:28,619
Not a bit of it. Made one of these
for the kids last Christmas.

737
01:24:28,755 --> 01:24:31,211
Maxwell, James and I
will head for the house.

738
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:34,177
Get set to hit the penthouse
as soon as we find Whyte.

739
01:24:34,304 --> 01:24:36,342
Let me speak to Metz.

740
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:40,173
There's been a change.
Push all plans forward by 24 hours.

741
01:24:40,311 --> 01:24:42,598
I'm joining you immediately.

742
01:24:49,402 --> 01:24:53,448
Give me five minutes to get up there
and five minutes to find Whyte.

743
01:24:53,574 --> 01:24:55,650
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

744
01:24:57,536 --> 01:24:59,660
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.

745
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:05,545
Tell Maxwell to stand by
to hit the penthouse.

746
01:25:57,561 --> 01:25:58,973
Well, hi there!

747
01:26:05,154 --> 01:26:06,564
I'm Bambi.

748
01:26:08,323 --> 01:26:10,150
Good morning... Bambi.

749
01:26:10,283 --> 01:26:12,111
And I'm Thumper.

750
01:26:13,204 --> 01:26:15,659
Is there something we can do for you?

751
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:18,661
I can think of several things offhand but

752
01:26:18,794 --> 01:26:21,664
at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.

753
01:26:21,796 --> 01:26:23,290
Oh, Willie.

754
01:26:23,423 --> 01:26:25,463
Why, he's right out there.

755
01:26:28,178 --> 01:26:31,298
And that's all there is to it?

756
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:33,472
Not quite.

757
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:38,015
First... we're gonna have a ball.

758
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,196
All yours, Bambi!

759
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:03,922
You're on again, Bambi!

760
01:27:09,014 --> 01:27:11,256
Thumper...

761
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,613
Hello, Felix.

762
01:28:38,739 --> 01:28:41,230
Willard Whyte is about to be executed,

763
01:28:41,366 --> 01:28:44,320
and guess who's giving
breaststroke lessons.

764
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,365
- Where the hell is Whyte?
- I haven't found out yet.

765
01:28:53,714 --> 01:28:55,338
Still haven't found out.

766
01:29:03,515 --> 01:29:05,343
Right!

767
01:29:30,545 --> 01:29:32,124
FBI?

768
01:29:32,256 --> 01:29:34,296
- CIA?
- No.

769
01:29:34,425 --> 01:29:36,880
British Intelligence, Mr. Whyte.
James Bond.

770
01:29:39,472 --> 01:29:42,472
I see you've met my friends,
Bambi and Thumper.

771
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,641
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.

772
01:29:45,687 --> 01:29:49,138
What the hell's happened to me
and what can I do about it?

773
01:29:49,274 --> 01:29:53,273
Let's get out of here first
and I'll explain it to you en route.

774
01:29:54,197 --> 01:29:56,866
Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...

775
01:30:10,924 --> 01:30:12,548
Saxby.

776
01:30:13,677 --> 01:30:16,926
- Bert Saxby?!
- Yeah.

777
01:30:17,054 --> 01:30:19,095
Tell him he's fired.

778
01:30:34,657 --> 01:30:37,113
Hi there, Mr. Q. Are you having any luck?

779
01:30:37,243 --> 01:30:39,914
I'm being somewhat successful,
thank you.

780
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:42,244
Listen, Mr. Q. I... I was wondering.

781
01:30:42,374 --> 01:30:44,582
Have you heard any talk about me

782
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:46,751
from Felix or James?

783
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,918
No, I'm afraid not.

784
01:30:49,048 --> 01:30:51,836
I guess I'm working
for the good guys now,

785
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:55,882
but I'm two steps away from
the slammer if they want me there.

786
01:30:56,014 --> 01:31:00,345
I thought... you might be able
to put in a good word.

787
01:31:07,694 --> 01:31:09,733
That's unbelievable!

788
01:31:11,407 --> 01:31:15,071
An electromagnetic RPM controller.

789
01:31:15,202 --> 01:31:17,990
Been aching to give it a try. You see,

790
01:31:18,123 --> 01:31:21,456
pressure on the case when
the desired symbols appear

791
01:31:21,584 --> 01:31:27,623
causes the rotation of the cylinders to
stutter at the precise moment needed to...

792
01:31:37,353 --> 01:31:38,976
Cab, lady?

793
01:31:46,612 --> 01:31:50,443
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

794
01:31:50,574 --> 01:31:52,782
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.

795
01:31:52,911 --> 01:31:56,825
I'd so dreaded the prospect of
making this tedious journey alone.

796
01:32:01,003 --> 01:32:03,042
This way, Mr. Whyte.

797
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,011
It was right here.

798
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,631
About six feet high, with a solar panel.

799
01:32:14,767 --> 01:32:18,552
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.

800
01:32:18,689 --> 01:32:21,061
Was Dr. Metz on your payroll, Mr. Whyte?

801
01:32:21,191 --> 01:32:24,562
No. But I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.

802
01:32:24,696 --> 01:32:27,815
The world's leading expert
on laser refraction.

803
01:32:27,949 --> 01:32:30,404
A committed idealist to peace.

804
01:32:30,536 --> 01:32:34,663
And how in the hell Blofeld got
his hooks in him, I will never know!

805
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:38,409
How did he get security clearance
to work here in the first place?

806
01:32:38,544 --> 01:32:41,628
From you, sir. I talked
to you personally about it.

807
01:32:41,755 --> 01:32:44,129
I even recognized your voice just now.

808
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:46,299
I'm sure I must've told you

809
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:50,557
not to keep the usual duplicate
microfilm records of the project.

810
01:32:50,683 --> 01:32:52,510
Exactly, sir.

811
01:32:52,644 --> 01:32:56,178
Tom, what did I tell you to do with this?

812
01:32:56,313 --> 01:32:58,354
Send it to Vandenberg, sir.

813
01:32:58,483 --> 01:33:00,938
Well, get 'em on the phone - now!

814
01:33:07,993 --> 01:33:09,404
Yeah?

815
01:33:09,536 --> 01:33:11,281
You won't believe this.

816
01:33:11,414 --> 01:33:13,453
- Willard Whyte for you!
- Wow.

817
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:16,453
- This is a real honor, sir.
- Shove your honor!

818
01:33:16,585 --> 01:33:20,714
- Where's that satellite I sent down there?
- Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.

819
01:33:24,929 --> 01:33:29,555
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.

820
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:38,557
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment.

821
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:41,612
The scanners have gone crazy.

822
01:33:41,738 --> 01:33:45,238
- Premature first-stage separation!
- It doesn't make sense!

823
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:58,502
Stand by to abort!

824
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:04,421
We can't control it, sir.

825
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:05,671
Abort it!

826
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,301
It's negative.

827
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:10,519
We can't. Something's taken over
the guidance system!

828
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,020
It's as if it had a will of its own.

829
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:16,687
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

830
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:19,489
We're working on it.
I'll call you back, Mr. Whyte.

831
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:26,911
Whatever it is,
your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.

832
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:37,964
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated
by an expert in light refraction.

833
01:34:38,092 --> 01:34:41,377
The first laser beam
was generated through a diamond.

834
01:34:41,512 --> 01:34:44,087
And if old Metz deserves his reputation,

835
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:46,894
the power of that thing
could be incredible.

836
01:34:47,019 --> 01:34:48,810
And Blofeld's got it.

837
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:55,226
- Where is it now?
- Approaching North Dakota.

838
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,402
Alert Strategic Air Command.

839
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,239
Gimme an open line to SAC.

840
01:35:01,117 --> 01:35:05,448
Attention all personnel.
Attention all personnel.

841
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:09,530
We have a red alert. Stand by
for emergency procedure.

842
01:35:28,271 --> 01:35:30,313
Willard Whyte.

843
01:35:34,404 --> 01:35:36,443
Yes, General.

844
01:35:39,493 --> 01:35:44,322
One of our missiles just "accidentally"
blew up in North Dakota.

845
01:35:45,667 --> 01:35:48,501
Whatever's happenin',
Mr. Bond, has started.

846
01:36:09,025 --> 01:36:12,940
- Is this your herd?
- Mr. Whyte, phone call from Washington.

847
01:36:13,072 --> 01:36:15,110
- Urgent.
- I'll catch it in the john.

848
01:36:15,241 --> 01:36:17,281
- What about Blofeld?
- Not a trace.

849
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:19,450
We found a tunnel. We'll check it out.

850
01:36:19,579 --> 01:36:22,663
- Where's Tiffany?
- Do you mind if we find Blofeld first?

851
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,830
Come on! Let's hit that tunnel!

852
01:36:52,532 --> 01:36:56,445
Washington just got word
from your friend with the cat.

853
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:01,239
Would you believe that this whole
damn country is bein' held for ransom

854
01:37:01,374 --> 01:37:04,080
and we've got
till noon tomorrow to pay up?

855
01:37:04,212 --> 01:37:07,295
So that's it. Well, I'm sure
you won't be alone.

856
01:37:07,423 --> 01:37:09,462
An international auction,

857
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:13,127
with nuclear supremacy
goin' to the highest bidder.

858
01:37:15,682 --> 01:37:18,969
Tell me, what does he need
to control that satellite?

859
01:37:19,103 --> 01:37:21,854
A simple set of tapes
fed into a computer bank.

860
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:24,104
All he really needs is a building.

861
01:37:24,234 --> 01:37:26,855
And these tapes? Large or small?

862
01:37:28,237 --> 01:37:30,278
Conceivably any size.

863
01:37:30,407 --> 01:37:32,447
From six inches to a cassette.

864
01:37:34,077 --> 01:37:37,281
Assuming he's still using
your empire as a cover,

865
01:37:37,415 --> 01:37:39,822
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.

866
01:37:39,959 --> 01:37:41,998
From Alaska to Florida.

867
01:37:42,127 --> 01:37:44,168
From Maine to Oregon.

868
01:37:44,297 --> 01:37:46,966
From Texas to... Baja California.

869
01:37:48,927 --> 01:37:50,552
Baja?!

870
01:37:51,973 --> 01:37:54,011
I haven't got anything in Baja!

871
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:04,607
There is still no official explanation

872
01:38:04,736 --> 01:38:08,151
of the apparent nuclear accidents
in North Dakota and Russia.

873
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:12,115
Presidential news secretary John Fenner
refused comment on a report

874
01:38:12,245 --> 01:38:15,779
that an emergency meeting of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session.

875
01:38:15,914 --> 01:38:20,458
It is believed the United States and
the Soviet Union have assured each other

876
01:38:20,586 --> 01:38:23,921
that no offensive action
has been taken by either nation.

877
01:38:24,049 --> 01:38:28,213
Reports of another nuclear accident
in Red China are as yet unconfirmed.

878
01:38:28,887 --> 01:38:32,672
Two more submarines have taken up
position not ten miles away.

879
01:38:32,809 --> 01:38:35,762
Are those military aircraft
going to stand off forever?

880
01:38:35,895 --> 01:38:39,395
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they attack?

881
01:38:39,524 --> 01:38:43,653
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical
show of force was only to be expected.

882
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:46,815
The Great Powers
flexing their military muscles

883
01:38:46,949 --> 01:38:48,988
like so many impotent beach boys.

884
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:53,448
I deeply regret my threat to destroy
a major city unless they give in,

885
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:58,292
but the nuclear powers, like all bullies,
can only be intimidated by force.

886
01:38:58,421 --> 01:39:02,121
- But how can you...
- They still have an hour left to reply.

887
01:39:02,257 --> 01:39:07,050
One hour for both of us to achieve
our common dream: Total disarmament

888
01:39:07,179 --> 01:39:09,219
and peace for the world.

889
01:39:11,143 --> 01:39:14,345
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?

890
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:16,520
Two miles, and closing.

891
01:39:18,318 --> 01:39:20,274
Stage One alert, please.

892
01:39:20,402 --> 01:39:22,395
Command Center.

893
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:24,439
All crew to Stage One.

894
01:39:27,368 --> 01:39:29,407
Up the top! Second platform!

895
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:33,703
There he is!

896
01:39:57,277 --> 01:39:59,768
- Aim!
- Hold your fire!

897
01:40:14,837 --> 01:40:19,998
All recovery crew personnel,
proceed to docking level and stand by.

898
01:40:30,814 --> 01:40:33,897
Good morning, gentlemen!
The Acme Pollution Inspection.

899
01:40:34,024 --> 01:40:38,154
We're cleaning up the world. We thought
this was a suitable starting point.

900
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:12,896
How disappointing! I expected
one head of state, at the very least.

901
01:41:13,026 --> 01:41:15,731
Surely you haven't come
to negotiate, Mr. Bond?

902
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:19,363
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.

903
01:41:19,492 --> 01:41:23,870
Search him from his toenails to the last
follicle on his head. Then bring him to me.

904
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:51,690
I do so hate martial music.

905
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:57,152
As usual, Mr. Bond,
you were absolutely right.

906
01:41:57,284 --> 01:42:02,159
You guessed correctly that that box
contained the satellite control tape

907
01:42:02,288 --> 01:42:06,157
and you came aboard presumably
hoping to substitute this

908
01:42:06,293 --> 01:42:08,333
for the real thing.

909
01:42:10,465 --> 01:42:14,379
So sorry to have ruined
the line of your suit for nothing.

910
01:42:16,013 --> 01:42:19,595
Talking about lines,
which one did you use on Miss Case?

911
01:42:19,724 --> 01:42:21,764
She has taken a reasonable attitude.

912
01:42:21,893 --> 01:42:26,022
Like any sensible animal,
she's only threatening when threatened.

913
01:42:27,775 --> 01:42:30,777
Well, it appears that
you're holding all the aces.

914
01:42:30,905 --> 01:42:34,652
- Right down to the dragon lady here.
- Jealousy? From you, Mr. Bond?

915
01:42:34,783 --> 01:42:36,823
I'm flattered.

916
01:42:36,952 --> 01:42:39,573
As La Rochefoucauld observed:

917
01:42:39,705 --> 01:42:42,494
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."

918
01:42:42,626 --> 01:42:44,665
I do hold the winning hand.

919
01:42:45,753 --> 01:42:50,048
Why don't you let me take you
on a little tour of our facilities?

920
01:42:50,175 --> 01:42:53,092
Your chance to see
the real tape once again.

921
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:55,378
Can I tag along, Ernst?

922
01:42:57,934 --> 01:43:01,302
I'd put something on
over that bikini first, my dear.

923
01:43:01,437 --> 01:43:04,226
I've come too far
to have the aim of my crew

924
01:43:04,358 --> 01:43:06,848
affected by the sight of a pretty body.

925
01:43:06,984 --> 01:43:09,026
No word yet from anyone!

926
01:43:10,114 --> 01:43:12,153
Only 12 minutes left.

927
01:43:12,283 --> 01:43:16,495
I suppose a little gentle prodding
is called for.

928
01:43:17,581 --> 01:43:21,957
As you see, Mr. Bond,
the satellite is at present over

929
01:43:22,084 --> 01:43:24,328
Kansas.

930
01:43:25,547 --> 01:43:29,712
If we destroy Kansas, the world
may not hear about it for years.

931
01:43:29,844 --> 01:43:32,679
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.

932
01:43:32,805 --> 01:43:35,642
It would give them a chance
for a fresh start.

933
01:43:35,768 --> 01:43:38,093
Washington, DC. Perfect.

934
01:43:38,228 --> 01:43:41,846
Since we have not heard from them,
they will hear from us.

935
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:44,818
- See to it, Metz.
- Washington. Right.

936
01:43:46,111 --> 01:43:50,240
And this, presumably,
is the control bank with the coded tape.

937
01:43:50,366 --> 01:43:52,240
Right again, Mr. Bond.

938
01:43:52,368 --> 01:43:55,369
All satellites are controlled
by a coded tape.

939
01:43:55,498 --> 01:43:57,953
The trick is, of course, to have the code.

940
01:43:58,083 --> 01:43:59,494
Obviously.

941
01:43:59,626 --> 01:44:04,171
It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose
one just presses that and out it pops.

942
01:44:08,929 --> 01:44:10,588
Put it back, Mr. Bond.

943
01:44:10,723 --> 01:44:12,761
Immediately.

944
01:44:18,856 --> 01:44:20,397
Hi, Ernst.

945
01:44:20,523 --> 01:44:22,684
Is Superman giving you any trouble?

946
01:44:22,819 --> 01:44:24,859
Put it back... very carefully.

947
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,610
You've suddenly
become tiresome, Mr. Bond.

948
01:44:33,746 --> 01:44:36,037
Target fixed! Commence countdown!

949
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:38,124
Ten minutes and counting!

950
01:44:39,086 --> 01:44:41,542
Take him away and throw him in the brig.

951
01:44:42,591 --> 01:44:45,082
And search him again, just to make sure.

952
01:44:53,101 --> 01:44:54,098
Bitch!

953
01:44:57,524 --> 01:44:58,934
Come on!

954
01:44:59,067 --> 01:45:01,439
Your problems are all behind you now.

955
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:33,685
Stop him!

956
01:45:37,151 --> 01:45:39,985
Nine minutes and counting.

957
01:45:45,451 --> 01:45:48,120
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.

958
01:45:48,245 --> 01:45:51,034
You stupid twit. You put
the real one back in.

959
01:45:51,166 --> 01:45:53,205
Come on, let's go!

960
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:15,314
A weather balloon!

961
01:46:16,945 --> 01:46:20,444
- What do you think, Mr. Leiter?
- That must be the signal.

962
01:46:20,573 --> 01:46:24,702
There isn't a low-pressure area
within 200 miles of here. Let's go!

963
01:46:26,704 --> 01:46:28,948
This is Charlie One to Squadron.

964
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:33,080
Charlie One to Squadron.
Ready all guns and proceed to target.

965
01:46:33,211 --> 01:46:35,253
I repeat: Proceed to target.

966
01:46:35,382 --> 01:46:37,505
Roger, Charlie One. Out.

967
01:46:38,259 --> 01:46:41,425
Come on, Bond. Get the hell off that rig.

968
01:46:41,554 --> 01:46:43,963
Eight minutes and counting.

969
01:46:47,977 --> 01:46:52,308
Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly.
Range... five miles.

970
01:46:52,441 --> 01:46:54,481
But I... I don't understand!

971
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:58,229
- You said they wouldn't attack!
- The balloon was a signal.

972
01:46:58,365 --> 01:47:02,233
The stupid fools must think
Mr. Bond has accomplished his mission.

973
01:47:02,370 --> 01:47:04,907
- Activate defenses!
- Activate defenses.

974
01:47:17,178 --> 01:47:19,928
Seven minutes and counting.

975
01:47:30,901 --> 01:47:32,727
This is Charlie One.

976
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:34,734
Commence attack!

977
01:47:34,862 --> 01:47:36,904
Commence attack!

978
01:48:09,735 --> 01:48:11,893
Six minutes and counting.

979
01:48:12,029 --> 01:48:14,068
Get them on the radio, Blofeld!

980
01:48:14,197 --> 01:48:15,741
- Tell them we give up!
- Give up?

981
01:48:15,867 --> 01:48:18,073
I've waited too long for this moment.

982
01:48:18,202 --> 01:48:21,487
They'll pay dearly
for making a fool out of me.

983
01:48:21,624 --> 01:48:25,039
I see it all now.
You don't give a damn about peace!

984
01:48:25,168 --> 01:48:27,624
- All you care about...
- Shut up, Metz.

985
01:48:29,632 --> 01:48:31,174
Tiffany, my dear.

986
01:48:32,884 --> 01:48:36,255
We're showing a bit more cheek
than usual, aren't we?

987
01:48:42,855 --> 01:48:45,524
Take her below and
lock her up with Mr. Bond.

988
01:48:45,649 --> 01:48:48,936
What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.

989
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:51,312
If only they were brains.

990
01:48:51,447 --> 01:48:53,606
Destroy this, Metz.

991
01:49:08,967 --> 01:49:11,636
Five minutes and counting.

992
01:50:05,653 --> 01:50:07,693
Four minutes and counting.

993
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:31,681
Tell them we surrender!
This is utter madness!

994
01:50:31,807 --> 01:50:35,509
One more word, Metz, and I'll
have you shot! Get back to your post!

995
01:50:40,317 --> 01:50:42,559
Prepare my bathosub immediately.

996
01:50:51,621 --> 01:50:54,112
Three minutes and counting.

997
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:12,886
All systems interlock.

998
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:15,558
Bathosub to crane. Commence lift.

999
01:51:31,832 --> 01:51:33,824
Two minutes and counting.

1000
01:51:45,638 --> 01:51:48,676
Power and breathing systems on.

1001
01:51:48,809 --> 01:51:51,134
Release catch is open.

1002
01:51:52,646 --> 01:51:53,761
Lower away.

1003
01:51:56,318 --> 01:51:59,068
Bathosub to crane! Lower away!

1004
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:02,607
Wake up, man! Lower away!

1005
01:52:09,749 --> 01:52:12,286
You stupid idiot! You could've killed me!

1006
01:52:12,417 --> 01:52:14,126
Disengage!

1007
01:52:14,588 --> 01:52:16,213
Disengage!

1008
01:52:21,971 --> 01:52:23,549
Disengage!

1009
01:52:23,681 --> 01:52:26,432
Lower! Not up!

1010
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,769
One minute and counting.

1011
01:52:35,069 --> 01:52:37,310
Blofeld to Command Center!

1012
01:52:37,446 --> 01:52:39,485
Come in!

1013
01:52:39,615 --> 01:52:41,739
Blofeld to Command Center!

1014
01:52:41,868 --> 01:52:43,659
Come in!

1015
01:52:51,961 --> 01:52:53,076
Damn you!

1016
01:52:53,213 --> 01:52:55,253
Command Center, come in!

1017
01:52:58,885 --> 01:53:02,172
40 seconds and counting.

1018
01:53:08,105 --> 01:53:09,101
Get the gun.

1019
01:53:13,318 --> 01:53:15,608
- Here!
- Shoot 'em!

1020
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:32,624
Jump!

1021
01:53:34,343 --> 01:53:36,584
Ten... nine...

1022
01:54:22,562 --> 01:54:26,180
So long, James! I'll wire M
you're on your way home!

1023
01:54:26,315 --> 01:54:29,022
Don't tell him
which direction we've taken!

1024
01:54:29,153 --> 01:54:30,979
If you're havin' a good time,

1025
01:54:31,112 --> 01:54:35,241
let the captain know and
I'll have him steam around in circles!

1026
01:54:48,007 --> 01:54:52,964
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you

1027
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:55,088
about us.

1028
01:54:56,849 --> 01:55:01,311
I know in a relationship like ours, the
girl's not supposed to be the one to ask.

1029
01:55:01,438 --> 01:55:03,478
But I can't help it.

1030
01:55:03,607 --> 01:55:05,646
And please

1031
01:55:05,776 --> 01:55:07,816
think before answering.

1032
01:55:07,945 --> 01:55:09,985
That I promise.

1033
01:55:10,448 --> 01:55:12,190
James...

1034
01:55:25,255 --> 01:55:28,589
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.

1035
01:55:28,718 --> 01:55:30,757
No mistake, sir.

1036
01:55:30,886 --> 01:55:35,633
On the specific instructions and with
the compliments of Mr. Willard Whyte.

1037
01:55:35,768 --> 01:55:37,759
Oysters Andaluz.

1038
01:55:38,811 --> 01:55:40,806
Shashlik.

1039
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:42,435
Tidbits.

1040
01:55:42,567 --> 01:55:44,605
Prime rib en jus.

1041
01:55:45,694 --> 01:55:47,735
Salade Utopia.

1042
01:55:50,033 --> 01:55:52,275
And for dessert,

1043
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:55,496
the pièce de résistance...

1044
01:55:56,999 --> 01:56:00,451
la bombe surprise.

1045
01:56:02,756 --> 01:56:05,709
That looks fantastic! What's in it?

1046
01:56:05,841 --> 01:56:09,294
But then there would be
no surprise, would there, madame?

1047
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:12,347
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.

1048
01:56:12,474 --> 01:56:16,555
This will just take a moment,
and then we will leave you in peace.

1049
01:56:17,646 --> 01:56:19,438
Wine, sir?

1050
01:56:19,565 --> 01:56:21,605
Mouton Rothschild '55.

1051
01:56:22,361 --> 01:56:25,194
- May we begin?
- Please do.

1052
01:56:38,377 --> 01:56:40,502
A happy selection, if I may say.

1053
01:56:40,631 --> 01:56:42,670
I'll be the judge of that.

1054
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:46,250
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.

1055
01:56:46,386 --> 01:56:49,009
Strong enough to bury anything.

1056
01:56:52,935 --> 01:56:54,975
But the wine is quite excellent.

1057
01:56:55,104 --> 01:56:59,102
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.

1058
01:56:59,233 --> 01:57:01,357
Of course.

1059
01:57:01,487 --> 01:57:05,567
Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked with clarets.

1060
01:57:06,908 --> 01:57:09,863
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.

1061
01:57:11,538 --> 01:57:15,953
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.

1062
01:58:17,403 --> 01:58:20,820
He certainly left
with his tails between his legs.

1063
01:58:21,909 --> 01:58:23,947
Oh, James!

1064
01:58:24,077 --> 01:58:26,567
Oh, yes. What were you about to ask me?

1065
01:58:27,873 --> 01:58:29,913
James...

1066
01:58:30,042 --> 01:58:33,126
How the hell do we get
those diamonds down again?
