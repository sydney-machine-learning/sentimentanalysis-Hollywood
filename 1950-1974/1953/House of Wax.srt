1
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,981
Hello, Matthew,
what are you doing here so late?

2
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:54,021
I came to get the books.
I want to study our accounts.

3
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,115
We've been doing very well lately.

4
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,558
Over 200 paid admissions today.

5
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:00,960
You call that good Saturday business?

6
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,488
If you weren't so stubborn,
we'd be turning them away from here.

7
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,933
Who cares a hang about history in wax?

8
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,528
There are people in the world
who love beauty.

9
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:12,096
But more who want sensation, shock!

10
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,608
Morbidly curious! I won't cater to them.

11
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:18,169
Their money is as good as anybody else's.

12
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,478
You should have seen them turning
them away at that Wax Museum...

13
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,486
on 23rd Street tonight: the Eden MusÃ©e.

14
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,182
The story's the same at
Madame Tussaud's in London.

15
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:29,952
-If you'd only listened to me--
-I know, Matthew.

16
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:34,224
I'd put in a Chamber of Horrors:
murder, torture, executions...

17
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,698
scare the life out of people.
I don't care for that kind of patronage!

18
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,997
You're a great artist, a genius sculptor.

19
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,766
I'm an ordinary businessman who wants
a quick return on his investment.

20
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,866
I've put $20,000
in this historic peep show of yours.

21
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:50,572
-I could use that to better advantage.
-All right, Matthew.

22
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:54,440
I've known for some time
you wanted to dissolve our partnership.

23
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,145
-I may be able to accommodate you.
-How?

24
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:01,783
A friend is bringing Sidney Wallace,
the art critic, to see my work tonight.

25
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,528
Wallace is rich, and I think
I might persuade him to buy you out.

26
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,597
That sounds interesting.

27
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,595
-I'll want a profit on my investment.
-Yes, Matthew.

28
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,635
I understand.

29
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,101
You leave everything to me,
and I promise you it will be--

30
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,805
-That should be they, now.
-I'll wait in the office.

31
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:23,072
I've heard of Wallace.
He has a pot of money.

32
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,910
If he likes your stuff, put a stiff price on it.

33
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,423
-Does Jarrod live here?
-Yes, he has a room upstairs.

34
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:44,261
You'll like him, Sidney.
He speaks your language.

35
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,863
Please come in.
I'm happy to see you, Bruce.

36
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,269
I thought you wouldn't come
on such a bad night.

37
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,773
We were delayed.
He had to be at a gallery.

38
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,810
Mr. Sidney Wallace. Professor Jarrod.

39
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,811
-A pleasure.
-For me also, Professor.

40
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,848
That title was bestowed on me
when I became an exhibitor.

41
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,111
It has little to do with my real work.

42
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,881
If you come, I will show you
what that work is.

43
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,218
The visit of such a distinguished critic...

44
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,622
may cause my children
to become conceited.

45
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:13,685
To you, they're wax. But to me,
their creator, they live and breathe.

46
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,998
Here we have two great lovers
from the past.

47
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,795
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt,
and Mark Antony. Their last meeting.

48
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:25,032
You'll recall, Antony,
believing Cleopatra to be dead...

49
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,938
killed himself with his own sword.

50
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,410
When Cleopatra found out what happened,
she quickly followed her lover.

51
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,380
You noticed how cleverly
the hair is mounted on the scalp?

52
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,076
Yes. How do you do that?

53
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:38,177
Real hair of the proper color and texture...

54
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,451
is pressed into the slightly warmed wax
with a scalpel...

55
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,957
one hair at a time.

56
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:46,392
Each wave and curl
of the subject's own hair is reproduced.

57
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:56,433
Here's President Lincoln and his assassin,
John Wilkes Booth...

58
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:59,235
one of my few concessions
to the macabre.

59
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,409
That's the best figure of Booth I've ever
seen. You almost expect him to speak.

60
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,142
-I wonder what he'd say.
-I'm sure he'd rant a bit.

61
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:11,118
Even after he shot Lincoln and jumped
from the President's box onto the stage...

62
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,247
he couldn't resist turning to the audience
and taking a bow.

63
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,450
I found him a very stubborn person.

64
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,924
-Stubborn?
-Unbelievably.

65
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:22,294
For days I argued with this fellow
before he posed the way I wanted him to.

66
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,958
-You mean, he talked back to you?
-Of course.

67
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:27,863
It's not easy to shut an actor's mouth.

68
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,831
These groups are like
dimensional paintings of the old masters.

69
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:35,142
This is not only a great show,
it's an art exhibit.

70
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,872
That's what I told you.

71
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,609
Here we have Joan of Arc,
a favorite subject of mine.

72
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,710
-I understand that. It's beautifully done.
-Thank you.

73
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,923
I've done her over a dozen times,
and still she doesn't complain.

74
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,151
What was wrong with her?

75
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,456
There are no
authentic portraits available...

76
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:55,361
so sculptors and painters
have to work from models.

77
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,922
I've never found the right one,
but I will someday.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,232
It's a shame to race through this exhibit.
These figures should be studied.

79
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:05,763
You're very kind.
My creations have some merit, I suspect...

80
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:09,071
but in bringing back to life
the lovely Marie Antoinette...

81
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,113
I feel I've done my best work.

82
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,515
I've never seen anything so exquisite.

83
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:16,380
People say they can see
my Marie Antoinette breathe...

84
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,511
that her breast rises and falls.

85
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:21,585
Look at her eyes,
they follow you wherever you go.

86
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:23,557
She is very real to me.

87
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,352
You know, her eyes do follow you.

88
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:30,627
They're made of glass, more's the pity.
The exact size and color of the original.

89
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,063
They're inserted into the sockets
from inside...

90
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:37,902
by way of the hollow neck,
before the head is attached to the body.

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,669
Forgive me, my dear,
for discussing your intimate secrets.

92
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,774
I'm sorry. I lose myself at times.

93
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,081
If people knew what you have
inside these walls...

94
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,516
you couldn't accommodate the crowds.

95
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,282
What you need here is exploitation,
more advertising.

96
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,519
-That's what I've been telling him.
-My partner wouldn't agree.

97
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,857
He's not happy here.
He wants to invest in something else.

98
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,696
Would you become a partner
in this venture? Would you buy him out?

99
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:08,763
I might be interested if my
lawyers approve and the price is right.

100
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,705
With your support, I'd do wonders.
I'd make any sacrifice.

101
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:15,642
Unfortunately, I'm leaving for Egypt.
I'm financing some excavations there.

102
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,179
I'll be back in three months,
then we can discuss--

103
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,976
You make me very happy.

104
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:23,718
You intrigue me, Professor.
I believe we'd get along together.

105
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,447
-Good night.
-Good night.

106
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,012
-And I'm grateful to you--
-It's all right.

107
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,729
Thank you for your visit
and your encouragement.

108
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,389
I'll see you in three months.

109
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,160
-Good night.
-Good night.

110
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:56,008
Mr. Wallace is a great art critic, darling.
You heard what he said.

111
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,848
Does he make you happy?

112
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,889
Of course you'd say that.
But I don't care about success.

113
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,447
The world will acknowledge your beauty.

114
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,620
And you, my friends...

115
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:09,255
Cleopatra, Mark Antony,
Lincoln, Joan of Arc, all of you.

116
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,959
How would it suit you to be famous again?

117
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,630
I know it'll please you,
you conceited devil.

118
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:19,441
It was like you to get yourself shot down
in a burning barn.

119
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,443
Couldn't do it
without a spotlight, could you?

120
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,911
Do you really hear what they say?

121
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:26,840
Of course.

122
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,182
A man has to be a little nuts
to be a good showman.

123
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,280
The sooner I'm out of it, the better.

124
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,949
You'll be out soon, Matthew.

125
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,426
Mr. Wallace returns from Egypt
in three months.

126
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,463
He'll be ready to talk business then.

127
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,363
-I heard him. That's no good for me.
-But, surely--

128
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:48,369
I want to buy something. It'll pay off
in a big way and three months is too late.

129
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:51,304
What guarantee do I have
that he won't go cold on the deal?

130
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,308
-Sorry. It's the best I could do.
-I can do better.

131
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,977
How would you like
to split $25,000 with me?

132
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,674
And you call me crazy?

133
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:02,945
You ever thought of what would happen
if we had a fire here?

134
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:06,215
In the cellar, there are six barrels of wax.
Wax is paraffin based.

135
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:09,815
It's highly inflammable.
This place would go up like a paint factory.

136
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,554
Burn? Burn all my people?

137
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,959
-Do you think I'm a murderer?
-Stop dreaming.

138
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,023
These dummies are insured for $25,000.
That's $12,500 for each of us.

139
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,663
You'd have money to begin again.

140
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,570
I'd rather die myself
than see my friends destroyed.

141
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,165
I won't let you do it,
and I'll kill you if you try.

142
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,710
Don't be stupid.

143
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:32,907
All you have to do is to strike a match
and the thing is done.

144
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,905
Yes, my friend was a genius.
A great artist.

145
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,873
Only I could understand him.

146
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:43,312
We were like that, Cathy. Just like that.

147
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:47,286
-Couldn't they ever find him after the fire?
-Not a sign of him.

148
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:51,019
The place burned like a paint factory.
Like a volcano.

149
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,857
He was such an impractical fellow.

150
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,158
But I still loved him.

151
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,926
Had I been there, I might have saved him.

152
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,629
You might have gotten burned yourself.

153
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,364
Yes. Such is life.

154
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,932
No matter how much we lose,
we must still go on living.

155
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,911
Was there any insurance
on the Wax Museum?

156
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,446
Yes. I had a little difficulty about that.

157
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,182
According to the partnership agreement...

158
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,914
the money was to go
to the survivor of the others.

159
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:23,549
The insurance company
insists upon proof of my partner's death.

160
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,823
They always want a corpse.

161
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,896
But they settled finally.
This afternoon, in fact.

162
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:34,331
Certified check. I got it cashed.
The money is in my safe.

163
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,230
-You know what that means, baby?
-No, what?

164
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,269
That little trip
I was talking to you about....

165
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,372
You're such a card!

166
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,410
-How much did you get?
-$25,000.

167
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,577
Where would you like to go? Atlantic City?

168
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:57,922
Niagara Falls.
We can get the license in Buffalo.

169
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,090
-License?
-Yes. You know.

170
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:03,893
Legitimate.

171
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,392
Why not? It might be fun.

172
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:08,993
Waiter, my check.

173
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,987
Pull it tighter, Sue.

174
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,825
I want a waist like Anna Held.

175
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:27,460
If I pull it any tighter,
you're not going to be able to breathe.

176
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:31,300
That's all right.
I don't need much breath, anyway.

177
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,168
As my late friend Matty used to say:

178
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:37,342
"If a girl don't watch her figure,
the men won't."

179
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,071
Wasn't that the man you were to marry?

180
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,548
Yes, but he hung himself instead.

181
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,653
Matty was such a card.

182
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,321
Where is your new friend
gonna take you tonight?

183
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,121
The Hoffman House for dinner,
and then to a vaudeville show.

184
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:55,654
-That sounds like fun.
-He's a free spender, all right.

185
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,060
Little bit older than I like 'em,
but very distinguished looking.

186
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,432
-Is he nice?
-Awfully nice.

187
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:05,163
A real gentleman,
except when he has had a couple of drinks.

188
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,037
That's to be expected.

189
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:09,406
I'm moving up.

190
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,643
I'm moving up in the world, honey.

191
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,877
No girl ever hits the jackpot
till after she passes 14th Street.

192
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:18,215
-Is that how it goes?
-Sure.

193
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:20,947
Look at me.

194
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,820
Not too long ago,
I was down on Delancey Street.

195
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:27,419
And tonight I'll be right up there
among the bright lights on 23rd.

196
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:30,362
Now, when you get up there tonight,
don't drink too much.

197
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,229
Don't worry, I won't.

198
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,760
He keeps trying to pour the liquor into me,
but I always manage to keep my head.

199
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:40,296
After all, now that I'm going regular
with a swell...

200
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,666
I got social obligations.

201
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:47,071
You know how it is when a fella....
No, of course you don't know.

202
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,940
You're not like me. You never could be.

203
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:55,186
You got all the brains
and all I've got is what I've got.

204
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:58,423
You know, I'm surprised
you even talk to me.

205
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,893
What nonsense.
You've been so good to me.

206
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:02,423
Why not?

207
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:05,432
A girl needs a friend
when she is down on her luck.

208
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:08,468
Holy smoke! Look at the time.
I've got to hurry.

209
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,370
Did you find a job yet?

210
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:14,067
No, but they need a hat-check girl
at the Silver Slipper...

211
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,508
and I've got an appointment
with the manager.

212
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,808
I know that fellow. Watch out for him.

213
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,008
-But why? What's the matter with him?
-Nothing much.

214
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,841
-Long as you know how to duck.
-That kind?

215
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:25,908
Yes.

216
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,649
-Did you eat today?
-I had everything I needed.

217
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,418
To hear you tell it.

218
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,052
-Besides, you're behind in your room rent.
-Mrs. Flannigan will wait for me.

219
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,461
Don't count on that.

220
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:39,022
The old buzzard
almost locked me out once.

221
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,159
There.

222
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:44,296
If I don't sizzle him tonight,
I might as well give up.

223
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:49,171
He's picking me up in a hansom cab.
No trolley for him. He is real society.

224
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:55,878
All I've got is 50 cents.
Buy some dinner with it.

225
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,783
-No, Cathy.
-Come on.

226
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,653
My friend will give me some money
tonight and then I'll stake you.

227
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:06,182
I don't need any mad money.
I never get mad.

228
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:11,223
Good luck tonight at the Silver Slipper.
And don't forget to duck.

229
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,771
Just a moment, Miss Allen.

230
00:24:57,312 --> 00:25:01,271
-What are you coming in so quietly for?
-I didn't want to disturb anybody.

231
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,873
-Did you get the job?
-No.

232
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,351
-Why not?
-I had trouble with the boss.

233
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,845
You'll get your money.

234
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:10,755
Cathy promised to lend me some tonight
when she comes home.

235
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:14,124
You better get right up there, then.
Because she's home now.

236
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,931
-Couldn't it wait until tomorrow?
-No, it could not.

237
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,491
If you want to sleep in this house tonight,
you get that money.

238
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,539
All right, I'll try.

239
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,347
Cathy, it's Sue. Are you there?

240
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:41,973
I tell you, the scream came from up there.

241
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:48,984
Let's look into it.

242
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:46,711
-Usually there's a policeman at the corner.
-That's why I'm blowing the whistle.

243
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:05,154
Cabbie!

244
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:41,551
-What is it, Mother?
-It's Sue.

245
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:45,517
This is a surprise.
I was just thinking about....

246
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:51,424
-What happened to you, dear?
-What's wrong?

247
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,990
-Wait a minute.
-What happened?

248
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:56,298
-Wait a minute.
-What is it?

249
00:30:57,905 --> 00:31:02,638
Cathy Gray, the girl in my rooming house,
was murdered tonight.

250
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:05,368
-What?
-I found her.

251
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:09,783
The man who killed her
was there in the room.

252
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,077
I tried to get away from him.

253
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:17,748
But he followed me into the street.

254
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,057
No, Scott, please don't go out there.

255
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,064
It's all right, darling. Don't be frightened.

256
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,658
It's all right now, dear. You're safe.

257
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:46,449
-Who found the body?
-One of my roomers. A friend of Cathy's.

258
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,785
-Sue Allen.
-Which one is Miss Allen?

259
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,285
-She isn't here.
-Where is she?

260
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:54,393
I don't know. We heard her scream.

261
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,623
When we went looking for her,
she was gone.

262
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:59,359
-Are all your roomers in?
-All but Miss Allen.

263
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:03,862
Lt. Brennan will want a statement
from each one of you.

264
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,099
See that nobody leaves the house.

265
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:17,547
When I arrived at the rooming house,
this girl had been dead for several hours.

266
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,415
The immediate cause of death
was strangulation.

267
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:23,149
The mark of a cord is still on her throat.

268
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:26,555
My examination indicated
she'd probably been given a drug.

269
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,922
-You were right.
-What was it?

270
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:32,596
Something to make her sleep.
Veronal, perhaps.

271
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,301
I'll know as soon as we hear
from the laboratory.

272
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,564
How long would it take
for such a drug to work?

273
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:40,163
That would depend upon
how much it was diluted.

274
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:42,732
It was probably given to her in a drink.

275
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,071
That's how it's usually done.

276
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,947
-Business is slow tonight.
-What?

277
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:51,576
-Three suicides and two murders....
-And a traffic case since 9:00.

278
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:53,916
The fellow got hit by an automobile.

279
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:56,855
I didn't think they go fast enough
to hurt anybody.

280
00:32:56,924 --> 00:33:00,018
Give them time.
They're getting better every day.

281
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,301
I hope you like it here, honey.
It's the best we've got.

282
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,686
-What's the matter with this one?
-You'll get used to that.

283
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,280
The embalming fluid makes them jump.

284
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:32,751
One of the suicides. Just like a woman.

285
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,523
They always have to have the last word.

286
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:02,175
-Why didn't you tell the police?
-She's doing that.

287
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,835
Last night was the time to do it.

288
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,642
-She was in no condition to come here.
-This is murder, Mrs. Andrews.

289
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,386
The body of Cathy Gray
was stolen from the morgue last night.

290
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:13,511
No.

291
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:16,152
Why would anyone
want to take Cathy's body?

292
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,487
We are as much in the dark as you are.

293
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,190
We had a similar case before.
Matthew Burke.

294
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,388
I read about that.

295
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:25,023
And Patterson,
a Deputy City Attorney disappeared.

296
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,862
We found no trace of him.

297
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:32,029
We could've laid our hands
on that man that you saw last night.

298
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,674
That's the strangest description
I've ever heard.

299
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,473
-No human being can look like that.
-Sure you didn't imagine it?

300
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:42,015
I did see him.
Just as I described him to you.

301
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,017
He was incredible, but very real.

302
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:46,519
Could he be the man
who took Miss Gray to dinner?

303
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:47,918
That's impossible.

304
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:50,957
She told me
that he was very good-looking.

305
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:53,789
That's what the landlady said,
it's a man with gray hair.

306
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:57,126
We have no suspects
fitting your description.

307
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,359
If we did,
we'd have him in the crazy house.

308
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,061
Don't leave town. Where can we find you?

309
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,001
27 Lafayette Street.

310
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:07,871
-Miss Allen will stay in our home.
-Make sure of that. She's our only witness.

311
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:09,637
That's all. Thank you.

312
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,038
How do you do?

313
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:43,736
I received a letter giving this address
and signed Professor Jarrod.

314
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:47,747
But I know the Professor's dead.
Can you tell me who wrote this letter?

315
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,108
My name is Sidney Wallace.

316
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,136
It's so good....

317
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:22,680
Forgive me. Shaking hands with me
is an unpleasant experience.

318
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,810
My hands are no longer hands.
Sit down, please.

319
00:38:26,987 --> 00:38:30,445
This is Igor. He's a deaf-mute.
He is one of my assistants.

320
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:34,490
I'm going to open another wax museum
under a different name.

321
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:39,264
-lt startled you, seeing me here?
-I thought you were dead.

322
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,563
Jarrod is dead. I am a reincarnation.

323
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,729
When I saw your signature,
I thought somebody was fooling me.

324
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:46,966
I don't understand
how you escaped the fire.

325
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,872
It's a mystery to me, too.

326
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,776
All I can remember is
that I tried to get out of my studio.

327
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:55,440
-I failed at first, but here I am.
-What a frightful experience.

328
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:58,383
Somehow I made my way
to the house of a doctor.

329
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,181
I still have my limbs but
they won't bear the weight of my body.

330
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,057
As for my hands,
they are no use to me now.

331
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:10,187
As a sculptor, I can't control them.
But they serve for ordinary functions.

332
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,397
-But you're beginning again?
-With the help of my pupils, yes.

333
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:17,729
I'm rebuilding my exhibition
from the ground up.

334
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:20,136
I'm going to give the people
what they want:

335
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:22,402
sensation, horror, shock.

336
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:25,270
Send them out in the streets
to tell their friends...

337
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:27,871
how wonderful it is to be scared to death.

338
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,143
I'll show you one of my subjects.

339
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:36,182
Do you recall the case of Kemmler,
the first man to die in the electric chair?

340
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,818
-Yes.
-Igor is working on a model of his head.

341
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:43,523
He has a strange obsession,
this mute of mine.

342
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:47,490
Every head he models
takes on the shape of his own face.

343
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,098
But in this case I humor him,
for he somewhat resembles Kemmler.

344
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:57,433
Crimes of violence
will be reproduced in wax...

345
00:39:57,544 --> 00:40:00,843
and exhibited while they are still fresh
in the public mind.

346
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,139
What do you think of my scheme?

347
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:07,753
It will succeed, commercially,
though it doesn't sound like you.

348
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:10,850
-Have you turned your back on beauty?
-No.

349
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:14,051
But I can no longer create it.

350
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:17,726
-I never forgot your Marie Antoinette.
-Nor have l.

351
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,601
She will be the leading lady
of my new exhibition.

352
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,398
But I must find her first.

353
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,495
-Find her?
-A model, I mean.

354
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,567
Yes, there will be beauty,
for contrast, if nothing else.

355
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:32,437
But each subject must be taken from life.

356
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:37,011
How can I convince my audience
they're alive, if I don't believe it myself?

357
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,619
I have something I think will interest you.

358
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:44,914
You follow Igor down into the basement.

359
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,928
I have to go my own way.

360
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,841
Here we are. Interesting, isn't it?

361
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:14,114
One of my pupils is about to dip a body
into a bath of wax.

362
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,379
-Body?
-Yes.

363
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,549
The bodies are constructed separately...

364
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:21,185
to exact specifications,
of reinforced plaster of Paris.

365
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,594
This is Leon, another one of my pupils.

366
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:26,496
-Mr. Wallace.
-How do you do?

367
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,333
The wax is melted in the cauldron
you see above the vat...

368
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,032
liquefied and brought to a boiling point...

369
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,474
so that it will distribute itself
evenly over the body.

370
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,578
The head and hands,
tinted by my own secret process...

371
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:43,275
are attached to the body
after it is covered with its skin of wax.

372
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,712
Now watch.

373
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:18,985
I wondered how it was done.

374
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:21,987
It's a method of my own.
Crude but adequate.

375
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:30,018
-Have you found a home for your museum?
-This is it, the building upstairs.

376
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:33,833
We'll continue to use the cellar
as the workshop...

377
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:37,894
it's an excellent location, and the building
can be leased at the right price.

378
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:41,563
I have some capital, but I need more.
$30,000, at least.

379
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:44,341
That's why I've asked you to come here.

380
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:46,774
-I'll think it over.
-Good.

381
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:48,874
She is about right, now.

382
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,975
Leon, drain out the surplus,
and let her cool.

383
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:55,522
Leon, open up number 27.

384
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:57,715
Come this way, please.

385
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:02,083
I told you that I intend to exhibit
scenes of violence.

386
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:04,423
Here is an interesting subject.

387
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,830
A mystery they are still talking about.

388
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,532
All right, Leon.

389
00:43:10,604 --> 00:43:13,630
I saw his picture in the papers.
This is a remarkable likeness.

390
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:16,699
-But it can't be a death mask.
-No, it's from memory.

391
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:24,849
He hanged himself in an elevator shaft.

392
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:58,214
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
See the House of Wax.

393
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,854
See the Chamber of Horrors.

394
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:11,120
Here's three lovely ladies right over here.

395
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:14,561
Would you like to see Little Egypt?

396
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:18,264
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,
Little Egypt, Queen of the Harem...

397
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:22,172
who danced at the Colombian Exposition
in Chicago in 1893.

398
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,370
Is she wax, or is she flesh and blood?

399
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:28,175
See the world in wax, the Hall of Fame.

400
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,613
The Chamber Of Horrors.

401
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:33,141
A cultural exhibition
that'll enlighten you, amaze you....

402
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,654
-I think I could do that.
-No, you couldn't.

403
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:38,213
I could, too, if I took my stays off.

404
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:40,557
Don't do that. Don't talk that way.

405
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:42,151
Watch it, young lady.

406
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:46,324
Careful, sir. Keep your head down
or I'll tap you on the chin.

407
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,424
Look out.

408
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,038
That's a becoming hat you're wearing.

409
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:56,132
I wonder if I could clip a flower off it.
Hold steady, now. Don't move your head.

410
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,609
Or you'll lose the powder off your nose.

411
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:02,010
There is someone with a bag of popcorn.

412
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:04,312
Close your mouth,
it's the bag I'm aiming at.

413
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,409
Not your tonsil. Here she comes.

414
00:45:06,853 --> 00:45:08,787
Look at that, it's in the bag.

415
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,587
See the lovely centers of ancient times,
ladies and gentlemen.

416
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,719
Beauties who died and tortured
out on the block.

417
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,423
Visit our Chamber of Horrors.

418
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:20,330
And pass the time of day
with notorious murderers...

419
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,460
who killed with the rope,
the knife, and the axe.

420
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,266
Thrills, chills, a lot of dirt
for a price within the reach of all.

421
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:32,374
I hope you don't think I've gone too far
hiring this fellow to bring people in.

422
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:35,472
-He makes it sound like a sideshow.
-Try him for a week or two.

423
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:37,744
Once we're established,
we won't need that sort of thing.

424
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,356
He looks like a real man.

425
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:50,828
You'd be surprised.

426
00:45:50,897 --> 00:45:52,865
It's a real man. Sorry.

427
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,292
The historic figures I'm about to show you
will be more interesting...

428
00:45:57,371 --> 00:46:01,398
when I tell you that their faces were
molded from the original death masks...

429
00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:04,501
now in the possession
of certain European governments.

430
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:06,545
First, we have Anne Boleyn...

431
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:09,912
second wife of Henry the VIII.,
and the mother of Queen Elizabeth.

432
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:12,975
With the executioner
Henry borrowed from the French king...

433
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:17,012
so that Anne's head would be cleaved
from her body without too much pain.

434
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:19,216
He was a thoughtful husband, Henry.

435
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:22,193
It was he who invented
the short cut to divorce.

436
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:24,631
A very bad pun, I'm afraid.

437
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:27,658
Here is another scene of historic violence.

438
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,932
Charlotte Corday and Marat...

439
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:32,301
one of the leaders
of the French Revolution.

440
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:36,741
The lady found him taking a bath,
and plunged the knife into his heart.

441
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,937
-Quelle femme terrible!
-What a shocking thing.

442
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:42,311
Yes, wasn't it? The poor man
was dreadfully embarrassed.

443
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:48,149
The exhibits in this room
will be added to...

444
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:51,019
from time to time
as various crimes are committed.

445
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:53,355
You'll read about them
in your newspaper...

446
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:56,294
and see them enacted here
in waxen tableaux.

447
00:46:56,496 --> 00:46:57,724
By the way, ladies...

448
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:01,700
this is how your ancestor
carried his bride across the threshold.

449
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:03,859
During the French Revolution...

450
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:06,963
a certain doctor invented
a labor-saving device...

451
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,372
to take the place of a headmen's ax.

452
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:11,736
So successful was this machine...

453
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,406
at cutting off the heads
of the French aristocrats...

454
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,415
they named it after its creator.

455
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,781
Here it is, the bloody guillotine.

456
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:24,723
I don't think I can stand it.

457
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,516
Pull yourself together.

458
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:30,552
Twelve years ago, the electric chair
was first used in New York state.

459
00:47:30,897 --> 00:47:33,058
Here we have an authentic reproduction...

460
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:37,536
of the execution of William Kemmler
on August 3, in 1890.

461
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:42,870
Kemmler killed without mercy
and 2,000 volts sent him to a higher court.

462
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,770
The torture of the rack. In this case...

463
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:51,113
Lady Anne Askew, an English noblewoman
accused of treason...

464
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:53,076
is being put to the question.

465
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:56,054
Needless to say,
she admitted she was a traitor.

466
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,591
Who wouldn't,
under that sort of pressure?

467
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:01,786
-Is it your corset?
-It's my stomach. It turned over.

468
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:03,227
Mine turned over, too.

469
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:04,558
Now, my friends...

470
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:09,125
we have that jolly old gentleman
known as the modern Bluebeard.

471
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:12,872
Like his namesake,
he killed not wisely, but too well...

472
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:15,907
and did away with eight wives.

473
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:24,109
-Smelling salts, ladies? Help yourself.
-Thank you very much.

474
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:29,449
Next door to him, we have a mystery
of more recent date.

475
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:31,850
Matthew Burke, the stockbroker.

476
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:36,853
He was found hanged in the elevator shaft
of the building where he had his offices.

477
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:40,993
Was it murder or suicide?

478
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,128
Only time will tell.

479
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:49,005
"Foul deeds will rise, though all the world
o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."

480
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,277
Thank you.

481
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,283
-You like him?
-He looks exactly like my Uncle Rufus.

482
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:05,119
They ought to have a policeman like this
in the Eden MusÃ©e.

483
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,217
-Haven't you been there?
-No.

484
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:10,286
From what I see in the papers,
this museum is even better.

485
00:49:10,363 --> 00:49:11,853
We'll soon find out.

486
00:49:16,236 --> 00:49:18,670
Meet my good friend, Mr. Sidney Wallace.

487
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:20,365
-Miss Sue Allen.
-A pleasure.

488
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,068
-I heard you were in town.
-You should have looked me up.

489
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:26,772
I expect great things of Scott.
He's one of our most promising sculptors.

490
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:29,372
-Has he been working hard?
-He never knows when to stop.

491
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:32,316
-Sue's been posing for me.
-Indeed, lovely subject.

492
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,410
She's not a professional model.
She's a guest.

493
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:36,045
Our mothers were great friends.

494
00:49:36,122 --> 00:49:38,488
-Have you been inside?
-Is it exciting?

495
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,254
If anything, too much so.
But I'm sure it'll catch on.

496
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:43,523
Jarrod, the owner,
is a good friend of mine.

497
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:46,464
You'll be interested in him.
Let's go in, shall we?

498
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:58,141
-These figures are excellent.
-I thought you'd agree with me.

499
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:00,936
They're not only well done
but they're good theater.

500
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,642
-What do you think?
-I know they are only wax...

501
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:06,948
but they seem so real,
just looking at her makes my neck hurt.

502
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,181
Wait till you see the Chamber of Horrors.

503
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,123
I told Jarrod he should have
a nurse on duty there.

504
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:15,624
He lost the use of his hands.

505
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:18,923
-Who did these figures?
-His pupils, but he supervised the work.

506
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,832
-His is the mastermind.
-Surely knows his anatomy.

507
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,648
Sue, what is it?

508
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:24,093
-Are you crying?
-What's wrong, Miss Allen?

509
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,031
A dear friend of mine was murdered
and I found her.

510
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,701
She means Cathy Gray, the girl
whose body was stolen from the morgue.

511
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,738
What made you think of her now?

512
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:37,167
That's her face. I know every line of it.

513
00:51:37,243 --> 00:51:40,337
I wake up at night and I see it.
I can't get it out of my mind.

514
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:43,007
Perhaps that's the reason
you see a resemblance.

515
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,847
-It's more than a resemblance.
-It's wax, my dear.

516
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:47,318
I know, but....

517
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:50,856
But why should it be so like Cathy?

518
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,855
I think I can explain that.

519
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,425
-This is a pleasure.
-You see, Miss Allen--

520
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:01,797
I heard what the young lady said.

521
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,668
The figure of Joan of Arc
is a traditional exhibit in wax museums.

522
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:08,731
It was completed just in time
for our opening tonight.

523
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:12,073
You're right, my dear.
It is more than a chance resemblance.

524
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:15,940
When I create an important figure,
I can't take just any face.

525
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:18,949
I saw pictures of your Cathy Gray
in the newspaper.

526
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:22,045
Her face fascinated me. And here she is.

527
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,490
Immortalized as the victim
of an earlier event.

528
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:29,986
-Do you really think she'd mind?
-No, I don't think she'd mind.

529
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,099
Cathy loved to "dress up" as she called it.
She used to take fancy dresses...

530
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,999
and imitate the actresses
she saw in the theater.

531
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:40,795
-I don't think she'd mind.
-Then I'm forgiven?

532
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:42,808
There's nothing to forgive.

533
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:46,405
I just don't understand
how it can seem so real.

534
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:50,245
That's the finest compliment
I have ever received. Thank you, my dear.

535
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,847
Did I hear your name correctly,
Scott Andrews?

536
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,218
-Yes, Mr. Jarrod.
-The sculptor I've been telling you about.

537
00:52:56,523 --> 00:52:58,787
Sidney showed me
photographs of your work.

538
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:00,587
He was right. You have great promise.

539
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,823
-What are you doing now?
-I'm doing a head of Miss Allen.

540
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,725
Let me see your hands.

541
00:53:08,902 --> 00:53:10,836
Mine were once like that.

542
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:14,470
How I envy you.

543
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:20,374
Would you be interested in some modeling
for me, some originals I have in mind?

544
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,812
Yes. I'd be honored.

545
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:25,078
Good. Come here tomorrow morning,
we'll make the arrangements.

546
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:26,846
I think you'll like it.

547
00:53:28,888 --> 00:53:30,879
I want you to look at this girl.

548
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,517
-With pleasure.
-Who does she remind you of?

549
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:35,458
I've been wondering about that.

550
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:37,587
I haven't known her
more than 10 minutes...

551
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:39,325
but there's something about her face--

552
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:42,994
That haunts you as the face
of my Marie Antoinette has haunted me.

553
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:47,472
Of course. I should have seen it at once.

554
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:50,137
A figure in wax.
Mr. Jarrod's greatest work.

555
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,337
More than wax. She lived.

556
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,039
-You mean I look like she did?
-Exactly as she did.

557
00:53:56,382 --> 00:53:59,749
Once in his lifetime,
every artist feels the hand of God...

558
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,379
and creates something that comes alive.

559
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:05,915
So it was with my Marie Antoinette.
And I loved her.

560
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:09,924
But she is gone now. Horribly destroyed.

561
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,690
Perhaps you would help me
to bring her back.

562
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,401
You will come to see me? Soon?

563
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:19,802
I'd be glad to.

564
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:23,872
You'll be welcome at any time,
no matter what I'm doing.

565
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,408
-And you, Mr. Andrews, in the morning....
-I'll be here, very eager to begin.

566
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,840
It has been a very exciting day for me
and I'm a little tired.

567
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,450
So if you'll forgive me, I'll say good night.

568
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:40,289
-Sidney, one moment, please.
-Excuse me, I'll be right back.

569
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:45,489
Forget about it.
You heard what Mr. Jarrod said.

570
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,728
Cathy's face was inspiration.
It's a portrait in wax.

571
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,632
Why should it seem so real?

572
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,775
I hate to drag you away.

573
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:02,144
That's fine. I'm going to work here.
We'll see it all another time.

574
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,739
Yes, another time.

575
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:07,748
Still time to see the entire exhibition,
ladies and gentlemen.

576
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,950
Get your tickets from the fine little lady
in the box office and go right in.

577
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,389
See the world in wax
and improve your mind.

578
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,226
See the Chamber of Horrors
and scare yourself out of a year's growth.

579
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:36,180
Not again.

580
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:13,478
What happened? Why did you scream?

581
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:14,945
I saw Cathy again.

582
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,241
And the man who killed her
was right here in this room.

583
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,043
I must have been dreaming.

584
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:23,217
Of course you were, dear.

585
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:24,644
A lager for the gentleman.

586
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:26,717
Sarsaparilla for the lady.

587
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,489
-And two knockwurst on rye.
-Thank you.

588
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:35,391
-Enjoying yourself?
-It's exciting.

589
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:39,093
-Do nice people come here?
-Of course.

590
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:42,100
-These Sunday matinees are very popular.
-I don't know.

591
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:46,571
It doesn't seem proper,
all those girls showing their talents.

592
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,807
You never saw a show
like this in Provincetown?

593
00:58:51,644 --> 00:58:56,013
Don't worry, your reputation is safe.
You've been worrying too much...

594
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:59,176
about wax figures
and seeing monsters in your dreams.

595
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:03,051
You need something like this
to bring you back to normalcy.

596
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,447
Prosit!

597
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:40,559
Remember Mr. Jarrod said he first saw
Cathy's picture in the newspaper.

598
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:42,457
Yes. What's wrong with that?

599
00:59:43,463 --> 00:59:44,987
I knew her so well.

600
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,062
I knew every little expression
and they are all there.

601
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:51,296
They would be. The man's an artist.

602
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:55,170
There's something else I saw
that night in the museum.

603
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:58,802
Cathy had a habit
of wearing an earring in her right ear.

604
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:02,481
She had the lobe of her right ear only
pierced for that.

605
01:00:03,649 --> 01:00:07,380
But that's there, too.
How could he see that in a photograph?

606
01:00:08,221 --> 01:00:11,713
-How can he make it so real unless....
-What?

607
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:15,423
Unless it is Cathy.

608
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:19,855
I'm going to take you
to Lt. Brennan's office tomorrow.

609
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:23,800
Tell him exactly what you told me here.
He's a policeman, he knows.

610
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,135
He'll convince you once and for all
that no such thing could happen.

611
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,731
Now relax, honey, and enjoy the show.

612
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:07,342
I know it sounds fantastic,
but you asked me to tell you everything.

613
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:11,349
You can see this idea is an obsession,
an unhealthy one, if you ask me.

614
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,352
-You say Jarrod is a cripple?
-He uses a wheelchair.

615
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,348
He can walk with crutches,
but not very well.

616
01:01:17,723 --> 01:01:21,386
Such a man came and asked to see
police photographs of Cathy Gray.

617
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,328
That's how it's done. Every detail
is studied to make the features true to life.

618
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:28,026
But why should Joan of Arc
have her right ear pierced?

619
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,035
-Why not? They wore them then.
-Two, not one.

620
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:35,501
Lieutenant, it's not a suspicion.
It's more a kind of fear, an intuition.

621
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:39,375
Intuition isn't much help in police work.
Facts are what we need.

622
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,812
Suppose you forget about it,
and let us do the worrying.

623
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:44,782
You mean you'll investigate it?

624
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,148
-Of course he does.
-Yes, that's what I mean.

625
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:50,416
-You both think I'm crazy.
-We think nothing of the kind.

626
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:54,084
It was very good of you to listen
and be so patient. Thank you.

627
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:56,027
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

628
01:01:56,262 --> 01:01:57,456
Thanks.

629
01:02:03,903 --> 01:02:06,394
This is Brennan speaking. Give me Shane.

630
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:09,566
Hello. I want you to go
to the City License Bureau...

631
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:12,236
and check up
on a man named Henry Jarrod.

632
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,747
Yes, he opened a museum
on 29th Street, near Broadway.

633
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:18,877
Yes, The House of Wax.

634
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:23,086
Dig up all you can. Get a list
of his employees and check with me here.

635
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:51,039
That's a copy of her face, all right.

636
01:02:51,117 --> 01:02:53,642
But she didn't look like that
when I saw her.

637
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:56,347
-Not so composed.
-Poor kid.

638
01:02:56,589 --> 01:02:58,523
You know, this fellow Jarrod's good.

639
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:02,220
-You think Miss Allen's fears are justified?
-Heck, no. Do you?

640
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,952
That's wax, how could it be anything else?

641
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,091
Leave it to a skirt
to dream up a crazy idea like that.

642
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,203
So you did you come to see me,
my Marie Antoinette?

643
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:53,177
Or was it that you came to see?

644
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:57,545
Mr. Jarrod, I'm so sorry. I know
I'm not supposed to touch the figures.

645
01:03:57,616 --> 01:04:00,346
You couldn't help yourself.
Don't let it trouble you.

646
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,252
I beg your pardon,
this is Leon Averill and Igor.

647
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:07,224
-How do you do?
-Igor isn't impolite. He simply can't talk.

648
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:09,619
Leon is an artist in his own right.

649
01:04:09,695 --> 01:04:13,096
It was he who did the waxwork
on the figure of Joan of Arc.

650
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:16,362
-Does she still seem real to you?
-As life itself.

651
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,432
Of course, her hair is different,
but that doesn't change her face.

652
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:24,540
What puzzles me is
how you can get such detail from a photo.

653
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:29,544
Was Cathy wearing her earrings
when the police photographed her?

654
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,607
Earrings? I don't remember.
Was she, Leon?

655
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:36,014
No. I don't think so.

656
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,285
The police would remove the jewelry
from the body, wouldn't they?

657
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,351
Yet you were careful to show that
both her ears had been pierced for them.

658
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:45,253
Yes, of course.

659
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:49,290
If I missed a detail of that sort,
Mr. Jarrod would be most displeased.

660
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:51,233
He insists on reality.

661
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,162
I can understand that.

662
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:54,932
Just a moment, Leon.

663
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:59,000
There's something in this box
I think would interest you. Open it, Leon.

664
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:09,377
Your Mr. Andrews permitted us
to make a cast of the head he did of you.

665
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:12,856
Leon has just finished it in wax.
Do you like it?

666
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:16,588
It's sort of a shock
to see your head detached that way.

667
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:20,557
-I guess it's a very good likeness.
-Yes, and no.

668
01:05:20,966 --> 01:05:23,799
Andrews is clever,
but like all modern sculptors...

669
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:27,305
he has too much imagination.
He would improve on nature.

670
01:05:27,373 --> 01:05:30,206
What I need for my Marie Antoinette
is you.

671
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:31,673
The real you.

672
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:34,012
Nothing less will satisfy me.

673
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:37,443
Will you come to see me again, my dear?

674
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:06,470
You know this fellow Jarrod's
quicker at finding these guys than we are?

675
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,241
That's what he says in his advertising.

676
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:11,972
Look at that. Even the twist in the neck.

677
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,082
That's a case that gets me.
Where is Burke? Who got him?

678
01:06:15,154 --> 01:06:18,123
-Who'd want him?
-We better find out pretty quick.

679
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,216
-Did you read the blast in today's World?
-Yeah, it's dynamite.

680
01:06:21,293 --> 01:06:23,488
The Chief had me in his office
this morning.

681
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,725
If I'm not careful,
I'll be pounding a beat in the Bronx.

682
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,710
Come here, Jim.

683
01:06:41,313 --> 01:06:44,680
Do you remember Patterson, the
Deputy City Attorney who disappeared?

684
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,774
Sure.

685
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:48,684
Does Booth look like Wilbur,
or am I crazy?

686
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:51,646
He does a tad with the brush off his lip.

687
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:55,519
The hair is different, of course,
but the features are like Patterson's.

688
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:59,655
Maybe he looked like Booth. I've seen
dummies that look like people I know.

689
01:07:00,032 --> 01:07:02,660
The caveman is a spitting image
of the new Commissioner.

690
01:07:02,735 --> 01:07:05,670
Please. Don't touch the exhibits.

691
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:07,999
-Can't you read the sign?
-I'm sorry.

692
01:07:08,073 --> 01:07:11,531
Look, where'd you get the face
for this guy that shot Lincoln?

693
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:14,846
-From photographs.
-They take them at that time?

694
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,538
If you go to the City Library...

695
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:20,176
you'll find the volume of Mathew Brady's
photos taken during the Civil War.

696
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:22,015
-Do you work here?
-Yeah.

697
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,415
-You make these things?
-Some of them.

698
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,082
What's your name?

699
01:07:26,525 --> 01:07:28,720
Leon Averill. What's yours?

700
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:32,753
Jim Shane. I'm an engineer on the
9th Avenue El. It was nice meeting you.

701
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:42,240
You know me. I'm no good at names,
but I don't forget faces.

702
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:44,100
If I can take the muff off of that one
I might be able to place it.

703
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,403
It was a long time ago.

704
01:07:52,484 --> 01:07:55,476
Mr. Wallace, I'm Lt. Brennan. Sgt. Shane.

705
01:07:55,554 --> 01:07:57,988
-Glad to know you.
-Won't you sit down?

706
01:07:58,057 --> 01:08:00,252
-Sorry I kept you waiting.
-That's all right.

707
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:03,659
This is the first time I've been
asked to come to Police Headquarters.

708
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:04,923
What am I suspected of?

709
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,160
Nothing. We thought perhaps
you might be able to help us.

710
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,996
We heard that your partner
is the same Professor Jarrod...

711
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:14,130
whose museum on 24th Street
burned down some time ago.

712
01:08:14,206 --> 01:08:15,400
That's true.

713
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:20,505
This Professor Jarrod was
supposed to have been killed in the fire.

714
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:23,878
-Apparently, a slight mistake.
-You suspect him of some criminal act?

715
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:26,144
-We haven't a thing on him.
-We're curious.

716
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:28,186
So is the insurance company.

717
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:30,819
What do you know about his employees?

718
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:34,950
-There's Scott Andrews, a protÃ©gÃ© of mine.
-Yes, we know of him.

719
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:39,621
Then there's Igor, deaf-mute,
and Leon Averill, who does the wax work.

720
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:44,860
Averill's an odd character.
Periodical drunkard, but a fine artist.

721
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:48,573
I've seen some of his sketches.
One of the Savior with his disciples.

722
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,039
Beautiful work.

723
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:55,276
-I'm afraid I haven't been much help.
-You never can tell. Thank you.

724
01:08:55,514 --> 01:08:58,540
-Please don't mention this to your partner.
-I won't.

725
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,254
You know, I gamble on Jarrod.

726
01:09:03,355 --> 01:09:06,483
He's strange, unpredictable,
but I think he's a man of integrity.

727
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:10,460
-I'm sure of it. Thank you very much.
-Not at all. Good day, gentlemen.

728
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,162
Remember I told you
I knew the man with the whiskers?

729
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:19,068
Do you remember that artist in Sing Sing
who painted The Last Supper on his cell?

730
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:22,335
Hendricks. They called him a genius
and gave him a parole.

731
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,968
But when they turned him loose,
he became a drunk.

732
01:09:25,044 --> 01:09:28,343
He broke parole a year ago.
We've had him on the wanted list since.

733
01:09:29,715 --> 01:09:31,239
-Carl Hendricks?
-That's him. Alias, Leon Averill.

734
01:09:31,316 --> 01:09:33,181
-Bring him in.
-Can do.

735
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,885
A little more bitterness
in that face, my boy.

736
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,717
Remember, this fellow has been
badly used by the world...

737
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,383
and he despises all the people in it.

738
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,690
Deepen those lines
around the corner of the mouth.

739
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:18,688
Not too much.

740
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:20,988
There. That's better.

741
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,425
What I wouldn't give
to have those fingers of yours.

742
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:28,906
-Thank you, Mr. Jarrod.
-I'm sorry I kept you so late tonight, Scott.

743
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:32,067
That's all right.
Miss Allen is meeting me here.

744
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:35,078
It's her birthday.
We're going to celebrate at Chiles'.

745
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:36,808
Charming creature.

746
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:41,012
I was worried. The shock of finding
that murdered girl gave her strange ideas.

747
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:42,110
I know.

748
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:45,350
I took her to Lt. Brennan, he set her right.

749
01:10:45,424 --> 01:10:47,756
That's very good now. Excellent.

750
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:51,158
Before you go, would you mind
running over to Metzgers for me?

751
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:54,097
-Metzgers?
-Where they make the artificial flowers.

752
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:58,169
They're doing a background
for this new group. Take a look at it.

753
01:10:58,237 --> 01:11:01,263
You know what I want.
Advise them on the color scheme.

754
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,174
I'd go myself,
but it's so hard for me to get about.

755
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:08,042
I know. I'll be glad to do it.
I'll go right now.

756
01:11:08,113 --> 01:11:09,774
Thank you very much.

757
01:11:14,286 --> 01:11:16,413
I followed him through his bender.

758
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:20,457
Sometimes, he gets the shakes so bad,
you expect to see his teeth fall off.

759
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,255
-Is this all he had on him?
-Yes.

760
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:23,487
No money?

761
01:11:27,299 --> 01:11:28,561
Gold.

762
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:36,768
"To Wilbur Patterson....

763
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:41,545
"With affection and admiration.

764
01:11:41,613 --> 01:11:44,776
"City Attorney's Office.
December 25, 1900."

765
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:54,888
Where did you get this?

766
01:11:55,427 --> 01:11:57,156
-I found it.
-Where?

767
01:11:57,362 --> 01:11:58,920
-On the El.
-What line?

768
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:01,893
-Third Avenue, downtown.
-When?

769
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,467
I don't remember, it was months ago.

770
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:07,628
-Book him on suspicion of murder.
-No. I found that.

771
01:12:07,706 --> 01:12:10,334
I never knew the man who owned it.
I never saw him.

772
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,535
Lock him up.

773
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:15,046
Please don't put me in a cell. I'm sick.

774
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,748
Can't you see my nerves are all shattered?

775
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:20,881
Look, please give me one little....

776
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:23,746
Can I have one little drink--

777
01:12:23,822 --> 01:12:28,020
You're not going to get anything
until you tell us where you got this watch.

778
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,595
-Take him out.
-Let's go.

779
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,128
You shouldn't have done that, my dear.

780
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,096
It is Cathy.

781
01:17:42,941 --> 01:17:45,000
It's Cathy's body under the wax.

782
01:17:45,477 --> 01:17:47,911
I knew it. I knew it all the time.

783
01:18:13,872 --> 01:18:17,205
Everything I ever loved
has been taken away from me.

784
01:18:17,642 --> 01:18:21,373
Not you, my Marie Antoinette,
for I will give you eternal life.

785
01:18:49,374 --> 01:18:53,208
This is where I recreated my Joan of Arc.
It's an interesting process.

786
01:18:53,278 --> 01:18:57,044
If you have patience with me, my dear,
I'll show you how it's done.

787
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,594
I can't stand it.

788
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,115
All right.

789
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,491
All right, I'll tell you what I know.

790
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,494
Patterson was killed
because he looked like Booth.

791
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:46,291
-You killed him.
-No, not l. Jarrod, at the waxworks.

792
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:49,464
His hands were no good.
He had to take subjects from life.

793
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:51,934
-You helped him?
-No, they were already dead.

794
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:53,470
What about Burke?

795
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:56,066
He's there, too. In wax.

796
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:59,504
He was the one
who set fire to the old museum.

797
01:19:59,911 --> 01:20:02,038
Jarrod came out of it alive, but insane.

798
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:05,674
-Cathy Gray?
-Joan of Arc. That's Cathy.

799
01:20:06,317 --> 01:20:09,718
She's there with all the rest of them.
The whole place is a morgue.

800
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:12,655
He'll do the same to Sue Allen,
if he gets his hands on her.

801
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:16,387
You've got to stop him
before he does any more killing.

802
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:43,620
That look of horror spoils your lovely face.

803
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:46,350
What if it should show,
even through the wax?

804
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:37,799
Are you in there?

805
01:21:45,049 --> 01:21:46,414
Where's Sue?

806
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:49,948
Where is she?

807
01:23:35,126 --> 01:23:37,594
The end will come quickly, my love.

808
01:23:37,662 --> 01:23:40,256
There's a pain beyond pain,
an agony so intense...

809
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:42,925
it shocks the mind into instant oblivion.

810
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:45,527
We'll find immortality together...

811
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:48,128
for they'll remember me through you.

812
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,473
Where's Jarrod?

813
01:25:20,598 --> 01:25:23,226
Andrews, where's Jarrod?

814
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:28,968
In the cellar. He's got Sue.

815
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:31,568
Take care of him.

816
01:27:21,886 --> 01:27:24,218
The People's Exhibit Number One.

817
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:28,084
You almost lost your head. Would you
care to keep that one as a spare?

818
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,592
No, thank you.

819
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,959
We'll never forget you and your men.
Thanks to you, we're still alive.

820
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:36,830
But every time I shave,
I can still feel that guillotine blade.

821
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:40,098
-Please, let's not talk about it anymore.
-Yes, you're right.

822
01:27:41,038 --> 01:27:45,338
Mr. Brennan, thank you
for the use of your coat.

823
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,979
-That was nothing.
-It meant a lot to me.

824
01:27:49,046 --> 01:27:52,015
When I found
you weren't dressed too warmly...

825
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:54,577
I didn't want you to catch a cold.

826
01:27:57,388 --> 01:28:00,414
Goodbye, Mr. Brennan,
and thanks for everything.

827
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:03,787
-Bless you, Mr. Shane.
-Thank you, Miss Allen.

828
01:28:05,696 --> 01:28:08,494
By the time this guy
gets out of Sing Sing...

829
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:11,599
this head will grow a long beard.

830
