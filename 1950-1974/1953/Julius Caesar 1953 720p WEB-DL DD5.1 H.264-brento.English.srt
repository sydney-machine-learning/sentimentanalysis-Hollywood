1
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,699
Hence! Home, you idle creatures,
get you home!

2
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,067
This is a holiday. What trade art thou?

3
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,805
Why, sir, a carpenter.

4
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,611
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?

5
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,344
You, sir, what trade are you?

6
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:48,946
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman,
I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.

7
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,719
But what trade art thou?
Answer me directly.

8
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:54,693
A trade, sir, that I hope,
I may use with a safe conscience,

9
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:57,821
which is indeed, sir,
a mender of bad soles.

10
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,060
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?

11
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:04,466
Why dost thou lead these men
about the streets?

12
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:08,906
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes,
to get myself into more work.

13
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:13,435
But indeed, sir,
we make holiday to see Caesar

14
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:16,779
- and to rejoice in his triumph.
- Wherefore rejoice?

15
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:19,613
What conquest brings he home?

16
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:22,184
What tributaries follow him to Rome,

17
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:25,224
to grace in captive bonds
his chariot wheels?

18
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,527
You blocks, you stones,

19
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:31,295
you worse than senseless things!

20
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:35,529
O you hard hearts,
you cruel men of Rome,

21
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,765
knew you not Pompey?

22
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:42,268
Many a time and oft have you climbed
up to walls and battlements,

23
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:45,278
to towers and windows,
yea, to chimney tops,

24
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,671
your infants in your arms,

25
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:51,374
and there have sat the live-long day
with patient expectation

26
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,486
to see great Pompey
pass the streets of Rome.

27
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,489
And when you saw his chariot but appear,

28
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,752
have you not made a universal shout,

29
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:02,659
that Tiber trembled underneath her banks,

30
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:07,596
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores?

31
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,930
And do you now put on your best attire?

32
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:13,064
And do you now cull out a holiday?

33
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,302
And do you now strew flowers in his way

34
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:19,243
that comes in triumph
over Pompey's blood?

35
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,779
Be gone! Run to your houses,

36
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,079
fall upon your knees,

37
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:26,779
pray to the gods to intermit the plague

38
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:29,685
that needs must light on this ingratitude.

39
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,992
See where their basest metal
be not moved.

40
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:37,929
They vanish tongue-tied
in their guiltiness!

41
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,899
Go you down that way toward the Capitol.

42
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:44,266
This way will I. Disrobe the images if you
do find them decked with ceremonies.

43
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:46,999
May we do so?
You know, it is the feast of Lupercal.

44
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:50,907
It is no matter. Let no images be hung
with Caesar's trophies.

45
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,212
These growing feathers,
plucked from Caesar's wing,

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,215
will make him fly an ordinary pitch.

47
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:58,717
Who else would soar
above the view of men

48
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,653
and keep us all in servile fearfulness?

49
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:54,267
- Calpurnia.
- Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.

50
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:55,940
Calpurnia!

51
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,467
Here, my lord.

52
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:03,346
Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
when he doth run his course.

53
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:07,818
- Antonius.
- Caesar, my lord?

54
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,884
Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
to touch Calpurnia,

55
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,087
for our elders say, the barren touched
in this holy chase

56
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,392
shake off their sterile curse.

57
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:25,063
When Caesar says "do this,"
it is performed.

58
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,904
Set on and leave no ceremony out!

59
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,171
Caesar!

60
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,808
- Who calls?
- Bid every noise be still!

61
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:41,214
- Peace yet again!
- Who is it in the press that calls on me?

62
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:44,815
I hear a tongue,
shriller than all the music, cry "Caesar."

63
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:48,259
Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.

64
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:51,487
Beware the ides of March.

65
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,094
What man is that?

66
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:01,831
A soothsayer bids you
beware the ides of March.

67
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,505
Set him before me. Let me see his face.

68
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,142
Fellow, come from the throng.

69
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:20,921
Look upon Caesar.

70
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,998
What sayest thou to me now?
Speak once again.

71
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,960
Beware the ides of March.

72
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,134
He is a dreamer. Let us leave him.

73
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,141
Pass. Pass!

74
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,575
Will you go see the order of the course?

75
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,947
- Not I.
- I pray you do.

76
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:23,751
I am not gamesome. I do lack some part
of that quick spirit that is in Antony.

77
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,288
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
I'll leave you.

78
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:29,955
Brutus, I do observe you now of late.

79
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,490
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
and show of love as I was wont to have.

80
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:38,628
You bear too stubborn and too strange
a hand over your friend that loves you.

81
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,900
Cassius, be not deceived.
If I have veiled my look,

82
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:44,501
I turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself.

83
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:48,012
Vexed I am of late,
with passions of some difference.

84
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:49,478
Conceptions only proper to myself,

85
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:52,609
which give some soil, perhaps,
to my behaviors,

86
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,977
but let not therefore
my good friends be grieved,

87
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,523
among which number, Cassius,
be you one.

88
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:02,255
Nor construe any further my neglect
than that poor Brutus with himself at war

89
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,125
forgets the shows of love to other men.

90
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,736
Tell me, good Brutus,
can you see your face?

91
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:15,505
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
but by reflection,

92
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,303
by some other things.

93
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:21,371
'Tis just. And it is very much lamented,
Brutus, that you have no such mirrors

94
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:23,609
as will turn your hidden worthiness
into your eye,

95
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:25,811
that you might see your shadow.

96
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,353
I have heard where many
of the best respect in Rome,

97
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,321
except immortal Caesar,

98
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,417
speaking of Brutus
and groaning underneath this age's yoke,

99
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:37,191
have wished
that noble Brutus had his eyes.

100
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:38,959
Into what dangers
would you lead me, Cassius,

101
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,593
that you would have me seek
into myself for that which is not in me?

102
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,728
Therefore, good Brutus,
be prepared to hear.

103
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:46,898
And since you know you cannot
see yourself so well as by reflection,

104
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,670
I, your glass, will modestly
discover to yourself

105
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:52,109
that of yourself
which you yet know not of.

106
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,203
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.

107
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,249
Were I a common laugher and
did use to stale with ordinary oaths

108
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,308
my love to every new protester,

109
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,218
or if you know that I profess myself
in banqueting to all the rout,

110
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,188
then hold me dangerous.

111
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,752
What means this shouting?

112
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,031
I do fear the people choose Caesar
for their king.

113
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,658
Ay, do you fear it?

114
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,630
Then must I think
you would not have it so?

115
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:19,935
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.

116
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:24,001
But what is it you would impart to me?

117
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,738
If it be aught toward the general good,

118
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,336
set honor in one eye
and death in the other,

119
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,779
and I will look on both indifferently.

120
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:32,650
For let the gods so speed me
as I love the name of honor

121
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,017
more than I fear death.

122
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:38,320
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
as well as I do know your outward favor.

123
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:41,088
Well, honor is the subject of my story.

124
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:44,455
I cannot tell what you
or other men think of this life,

125
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:47,600
but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be

126
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:51,263
as live to be in awe
of such a thing as I myself.

127
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,865
I was born free as Caesar. So were you.

128
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,007
We both have fed as well,

129
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,445
and we can both endure the winter's cold
as well as he.

130
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:04,113
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,

131
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:06,482
the troubled Tiber chafing at her shores,

132
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:09,750
Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius,
now leap in with me

133
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:12,985
"into this angry flood
and swim to yonder points?"

134
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,324
Upon the word, accoutered as I was,
I plunged in and bade him follow,

135
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:18,057
so indeed he did.

136
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:21,664
The torrent roared,
and we did buffet it with lusty sinews,

137
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:25,169
throwing it aside and stemming it
with hearts of controversy.

138
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:27,571
But ere we could arrive
the point proposed,

139
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:31,236
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"

140
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,915
And this man is now become a god,

141
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,711
and Cassius is a wretched creature

142
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:42,949
and must bend his body
if Caesar carelessly but nod on him.

143
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:47,621
Caesar! Caesar!

144
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:50,986
He had a fever when he was in Spain,

145
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:53,554
and when the fit was on him,
I did mark how he did shake.

146
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:57,866
It is true, this god did shake.
His coward lips did from their color fly,

147
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:01,998
and that same eye whose bend doth awe
the world did lose his luster.

148
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,542
I did hear him groan.

149
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,873
Ay, and that tongue of his
that bade the Romans

150
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:08,140
mark him and write his
speeches in their books,

151
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:12,515
alas, it cried, "Give me some drink,
Titinius," as a sick girl.

152
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,881
Ye gods! It doth amaze me a man
of such a feeble temper

153
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,824
should so get the start
of the majestic world

154
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,824
and bear the palm alone.

155
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:23,794
Caesar! Caesar!

156
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:25,865
Another general shout.

157
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:30,836
Why, man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a colossus.

158
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,507
And we petty men walk
under his huge legs

159
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:38,511
and peep about
to find ourselves dishonorable graves.

160
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:42,643
Men at some time are masters
of their fates.

161
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:46,817
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,

162
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,784
but in ourselves, that we are underlings.

163
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,548
Brutus and Caesar.

164
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,487
What should be in that Caesar?

165
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,755
Why should that name be sounded
more than yours?

166
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,796
Write them together,
yours is as fair a name.

167
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,764
Sound them,
it doth become the mouth as well.

168
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:02,198
Weigh them, it is as heavy.
Conjure with them,

169
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:05,260
Brutus will start a spirit
as soon as Caesar.

170
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:08,239
Now, in the name of all the gods at once,

171
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:11,004
upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,

172
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:13,444
that he is grown so great?

173
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:16,313
Age, thou art shamed!

174
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,978
Rome, thou hast lost
the breed of noble bloods.

175
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,947
When went there by a time,
since the great flood,

176
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:25,786
but it was famed
for more than for one man?

177
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,917
When could they say, till now,
that talked of Rome,

178
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,986
that her wide walls encompassed
but one man?

179
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:36,194
O you and I have heard our fathers say,
there was a Brutus once

180
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,298
that would have brooked the eternal devil

181
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:41,272
to keep his state in Rome
as easily as a king.

182
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,767
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.

183
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:47,973
What you would work me to,
I have some aim.

184
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:49,515
How I have thought of this
and of these times

185
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,210
I shall recount hereafter.

186
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:52,343
For this present,

187
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:56,287
I would not, so with love I might
entreat you, be any further moved.

188
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:57,618
What you have said I will consider.

189
00:13:57,691 --> 00:14:02,060
What you have to say, I will with patience
hear and find a time both meet to hear

190
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,960
and answer such high things.

191
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,266
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this.

192
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:11,567
Brutus had rather be a villager

193
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:15,131
than to repute himself a son of Rome
under these hard conditions

194
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,698
as this time is like to lay upon us.

195
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:20,638
I am glad that my weak words

196
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:24,641
have struck but thus much show
of fire from Brutus.

197
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:32,852
The games are done
and Caesar is returning.

198
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:50,333
Look you, Cassius, the angry spot
doth glow on Caesar's brow,

199
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,307
and all the rest look like a chidden train.

200
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:57,009
Casca will, after his sour fashion, tell us
what hath proceeded worthy note today.

201
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,351
Calpurnia's cheek is pale,

202
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:02,719
and Cicero looks with such ferret
and such fiery eyes

203
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:06,520
as we have seen him in the Capitol being
crossed in conference by some senators.

204
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:09,220
Casca will tell us what the matter is.

205
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:24,643
Antonius, let me have men about me
that are fat,

206
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,407
sleek-headed men,
and such as sleep a-nights.

207
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:32,385
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much.

208
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,985
Such men are dangerous.

209
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:38,188
Fear him not, Caesar. He is not dangerous.

210
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:42,491
Would he were fatter.

211
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,487
But I fear him not.

212
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:46,498
Yet if my name were liable to fear,

213
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:50,229
I do not know the man I should avoid
so soon as that spare Cassius.

214
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,969
He reads much.

215
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:56,331
He is a great observer, and he looks
quite through the deeds of men.

216
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,269
He loves no plays as thou dost, Antony.

217
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:02,244
He hears no music.

218
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:05,009
Seldom he smiles,
and smiles in such a sort

219
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:07,019
as if he mocked himself,
and scorned his spirit

220
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,578
that could be moved to smile at anything.

221
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:12,321
Such men as he be never at heart's ease

222
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:15,327
whilst they behold
a greater than themselves,

223
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:18,023
and therefore are they very dangerous.

224
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:23,230
I rather tell thee what is to be
feared than what I fear,

225
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:25,533
for always I am Caesar.

226
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,039
Come on my right hand,
for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly

227
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,101
what thou think'st of him.

228
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,266
- Would you speak with me?
- Ay, Casca.

229
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,571
Tell us what hath chanced today,
that Caesar looks so sad.

230
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:06,407
Why, you were with him, were you not?

231
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:09,543
I should not then ask Casca
what had chanced.

232
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:13,315
Why, there was a crown offered him,
and, being offered him,

233
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:16,015
he put it by
with the back of his hand, thus,

234
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,353
and then the people fell a-shouting.

235
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:20,187
What was the second noise for?

236
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,660
- Why, for that too.
- They shouted thrice.

237
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:25,823
- What was the last cry for?
- Why, for that too.

238
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,296
- Was the crown offered him thrice?
- Ay, marry, it was,

239
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:32,805
and he put it by thrice,
every time gentler than other,

240
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:35,700
and with every putting by
mine honest neighbors shouted.

241
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,768
- Who offered him the crown?
- Why, Antony.

242
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,981
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

243
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,016
I can as well be hanged
as tell the manner of it.

244
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:47,746
It was mere foolery. I did not mark it.

245
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,879
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown.

246
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:53,187
Yet it was not a crown neither,
it was one of those coronets.

247
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,127
And as I told you, he put it by once,
but, for all that, to my thinking,

248
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,629
he would fain have had it.

249
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,325
Then he offered it to him again,
then he put it by again,

250
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,631
but, to my thinking, he was very loath
to lay his fingers off it.

251
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:07,195
Then he offered it a third time.
He put it a third time by.

252
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:10,436
And still as he refused it, the rabblement
hooted and clapped their chapped hands

253
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,409
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps

254
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:15,709
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath
because Caesar refused the crown,

255
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:19,080
that it had almost choked Caesar
for he swounded and fell down at it.

256
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:21,676
And for mine own part I durst not laugh,
for fear of opening my lips

257
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:23,449
and receiving the bad air.

258
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:26,024
What? Did Caesar swoon?

259
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:29,357
He fell down and foamed at the mouth
and was speechless.

260
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,859
'Tis very like he hath the falling sickness.

261
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,527
No, Caesar hath it not,

262
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:42,871
but you and I and honest Casca,
we have the falling sickness.

263
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:47,440
I know not what you mean by that,
but I am sure Caesar fell down.

264
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,515
What said he when he came unto himself?

265
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,073
When he came to himself again,

266
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:53,585
he said if he had done
or said anything amiss,

267
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:56,781
he desired their worships
to think it was his infirmity.

268
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,057
Three or four wenches where I stood
cried, "Alas, good soul,"

269
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,527
and forgave him with all their hearts.

270
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,256
There's no heed to be taken of them.

271
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:07,698
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers,
they would have done no less.

272
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,531
And after that he came, thus sad, away?

273
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:11,935
Ay.

274
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:13,438
Did Cicero say anything?

275
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,770
- Ay, he spoke Greek.
- To what effect?

276
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:18,604
Nay, an I tell you that,
I'll never look you in the face again,

277
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:21,613
but those that understood him smiled
at one another and shook their heads,

278
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,945
but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.

279
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,008
I could tell you more news, too.

280
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,846
Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves
off Caesar's images, are put to silence.

281
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:33,681
Fare you well.

282
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:37,559
There was more foolery yet,
if I could remember it.

283
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,299
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?

284
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,701
No, I am promised forth.

285
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,638
Will you dine with me tomorrow?

286
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:55,010
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold,
and your dinner worth the eating.

287
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,173
Good. I will expect you.

288
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,850
Do so. Farewell, both.

289
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:05,722
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be.

290
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,588
He was quick metal
when he went to school.

291
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,925
So is he now in execution
of any bold or noble enterprise.

292
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,357
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,

293
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:18,428
which gives men stomach to digest
his words with better appetite.

294
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:20,874
And so it is.

295
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,539
For this time I will leave you.

296
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,170
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you.

297
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:29,841
Or, if you will, come home to me,
and I will wait for you.

298
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:33,612
I will do so. Till then, think of the world.

299
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,122
Well, Brutus, thou art noble,

300
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:45,062
yet I see thy honorable metal
may be wrought from that it is disposed.

301
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:49,433
Therefore, it is meet that noble minds
keep ever with their likes,

302
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:52,266
for who so firm that cannot be seduced?

303
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,807
Caesar doth bear me hard,
yet he loves Brutus.

304
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:02,181
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
he should not humor me.

305
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:06,346
I will this night, in several hands,

306
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,855
in at his windows throw,
as if they came from several citizens,

307
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:14,222
writings all tending to the great opinion
that Rome holds of his name,

308
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:19,253
wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition
shall be glanced at.

309
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:22,697
And after this let Caesar seat him sure,

310
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:24,733
for we will shake him,

311
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:27,466
or worse days endure.

312
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,961
Good even, Casca.

313
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,731
Why are you breathless?
And why stare you so?

314
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:40,005
Are not you moved, when all the sway
of earth shakes like a thing unfirm?

315
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,479
O Cicero, I have seen tempests,

316
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:43,914
when the scolding winds have rived
the knotty oaks,

317
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,417
and I have seen the ambitious
ocean swell and rage and foam,

318
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:48,613
to be exalted with the threatening clouds.

319
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:52,852
But never till tonight, never till now,
did I go through a tempest dropping fire.

320
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,791
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,

321
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:58,819
or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
incenses them to send destruction.

322
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:01,263
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?

323
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,665
A common slave,
you know him well by sight,

324
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:04,895
held up his left hand,

325
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,065
which did flame and burn
like 20 torches joined.

326
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:09,369
And there were drawn upon a heap

327
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,172
100 ghastly women,
transformed with their fear,

328
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:15,840
who swore they saw men all in fire
walk up and down the streets.

329
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:19,214
And yesterday the bird of night did sit,
even at noonday, upon the marketplace,

330
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:20,513
hooting and shrieking.

331
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:22,817
When these prodigies
do so conjointly meet,

332
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:25,949
let not men say, "These are their reasons,
they are natural."

333
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:30,394
For, I believe, they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon.

334
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:33,891
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?

335
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:42,501
He doth, for he did bid Antonius send word
to you he would be there tomorrow.

336
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,441
Good night then, Casca.

337
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,741
This disturbed sky is not to walk in.

338
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:49,773
Farewell, Cicero.

339
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:13,169
- Who's there?
- A Roman.

340
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,968
Casca, by your voice.

341
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:19,238
- Cassius, what night is this?
- A very pleasing night to honest men.

342
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:20,836
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

343
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:23,610
Those that have known
the earth so full of faults.

344
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:25,378
You are dull, Casca,

345
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,681
and those sparks of life
that should be in a Roman

346
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:30,086
you do want, or else you use not.

347
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,626
You look pale and gaze and put on fear
and cast yourself in wonder,

348
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:36,628
to see the strange impatience
of the heavens.

349
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:41,834
Now could I, Casca, name to thee
a man most like this dreadful night

350
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:45,666
that thunders, lightens,
opens graves and roars.

351
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:48,365
A man no mightier than thyself or me.

352
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,203
'Tis Caesar that you mean,
is it not, Cassius?

353
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:51,264
Let it be who it is.

354
00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:54,836
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
mean to establish Caesar as a king.

355
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:57,041
And he shall wear his crown
by sea and land,

356
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,107
in every place save here in Italy.

357
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:01,585
I know where I will wear this dagger, then.

358
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:04,453
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.

359
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:07,857
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.

360
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:10,452
So can I, so every bondman
in his own hand

361
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,260
bears the power to cancel his captivity.

362
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,568
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?

363
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:19,503
Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf

364
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:22,063
but that he knows
the Romans are but sheep.

365
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:25,406
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.

366
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:29,547
They that with haste will make
a mighty fire begin it with weak straws.

367
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,616
What trash is Rome,
what rubbish and what offal,

368
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,416
that it serves for the base
matter to illuminate

369
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:38,889
so vile a thing as Caesar.

370
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,090
But, O grief, where hast thou led me?

371
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:46,389
I, per chance, speak this
before a willing bondman.

372
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:51,798
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
that is no fleering tell-tale.

373
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:53,371
Here's my hand.

374
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:56,101
And I will set this foot of mine
as far as who goes farthest.

375
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:57,972
There's a bargain made!

376
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:00,977
Stand close awhile.

377
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:06,076
'Tis Cinna. I do know him by his gait.
He is a friend.

378
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:11,389
- Cinna, where haste you so?
- To find out you.

379
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:12,890
Who's that? Metellus Cimber?

380
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,223
No, it is Casca,
one incorporate to our attempts.

381
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,661
- Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
- Yes, you are.

382
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,665
Cassius, if you could but win the noble
Brutus to our party...

383
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:23,793
Be you content.
Good Cinna, take this paper,

384
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,736
and look you lay it in the praetor's
chair, where Brutus may but find it,

385
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:30,901
and throw this in at his window,
set this up in wax upon old Brutus' statue.

386
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:33,945
All this done, repair to Pompey's porch,
where you shall find us.

387
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:35,809
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

388
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:39,444
All but Metellus Cimber,
and he's gone to seek you at your house.

389
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,781
Now, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
seek Brutus at his house.

390
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,889
Three parts of him is ours already,

391
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,656
and the man entire
upon the next encounter yields him ours.

392
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,900
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
give guess how near to day.

393
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:43,276
Lucius.

394
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,884
Awake, I say. Lucius.

395
00:27:52,892 --> 00:27:55,986
I would it were my fault
to sleep so soundly.

396
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:05,927
Called you, my lord?

397
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:09,771
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

398
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:11,399
I will, my lord.

399
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:27,992
It must be by his death,

400
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:34,096
and, for my part, I know no personal cause
to spurn at him but for the general.

401
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:36,968
He would be crowned.

402
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:41,006
How that might change his nature,
there's the question.

403
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:43,564
For it is the bright day
that brings forth the adder,

404
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:45,736
and that craves wary walking.

405
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:48,309
Crown him. That.

406
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:53,617
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
that at his will he may do danger with.

407
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:59,217
The abuse of greatness is
when it disjoins remorse from power.

408
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:01,826
And, to speak truth of Caesar,

409
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:05,330
I have not known when his affections
swayed more than his reason.

410
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:10,131
But 'tis a common proof
that lowliness is young ambition's ladder,

411
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,063
whereto the climber upward turns
his face,

412
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:15,733
but when he once attains
the upmost round,

413
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:19,107
he then unto the ladder turns his back,
looks in the clouds,

414
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:23,210
scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend.

415
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:25,673
So Caesar may.

416
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,519
Then lest he may, prevent.

417
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:34,855
And, since the quarrel will bear no color
for the thing he is, fashion it thus,

418
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:39,120
that what he is, augmented,
would run to these and these extremities.

419
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,097
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg

420
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,998
which, hatched, would, as his kind,
grow mischievous,

421
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,507
and kill him in the shell.

422
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:59,013
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

423
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:02,714
Searching the window for a flint,
I found this paper thus sealed up,

424
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:05,689
and I am sure it did not lie there
when I went to bed.

425
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:07,623
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

426
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:08,717
I know not, sir.

427
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:12,253
- Look in the calendar and bring me word.
- I will, sir.

428
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,538
"Brutus, thou sleep'st.

429
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:22,040
"Awake and see thyself.

430
00:30:23,242 --> 00:30:25,176
"Shall Rome, etcetera."

431
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,313
"Speak, strike, redress!

432
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,609
"Brutus, thou sleep'st. Awake!"

433
00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:36,482
Such instigations have been often dropped
where I have took them up.

434
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:39,148
"Shall Rome, etcetera."

435
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,950
Thus must I piece it out.

436
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:45,524
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?

437
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:47,098
What, Rome?

438
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:50,734
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
the Tarquin drive,

439
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:52,828
when he was called a king.

440
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:55,831
"Speak, strike, redress."

441
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:59,137
Am I entreated to speak and strike?

442
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:02,211
O Rome, I make thee promise.

443
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:05,948
If the redress will follow,
thou receivest thy full petition

444
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,815
at the hand of Brutus.

445
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:10,721
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

446
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:12,785
'Tis good.

447
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,490
Go to the gate. Somebody knocks.

448
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:27,529
Since Cassius first did whet me
against Caesar, I have not slept.

449
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,474
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion,

450
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:34,036
all the interim is like a phantasma,

451
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:36,182
or a hideous dream.

452
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:40,641
The genius and the mortal instruments
are then in council,

453
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,180
and the state of man,

454
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:47,248
like to a little kingdom,
suffers then the nature of an insurrection.

455
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:55,228
I fear we are too bold upon your rest.

456
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,133
Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?

457
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:59,695
I have been up this hour, awake all night.

458
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:02,207
Know I these men
that come along with you?

459
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:04,971
Yes, every one of them.
And no man here but honors you.

460
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:07,308
And every one doth wish
you had but that opinion of yourself

461
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,575
which every noble Roman bears of you.

462
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:11,048
This is Trebonius.

463
00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:13,114
- He is welcome hither.
- This, Decius Brutus.

464
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:15,415
- He is welcome, too.
- This, Casca. This, Cinna.

465
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:18,321
- And this, Metellus Cimber.
- They are all welcome.

466
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:21,154
What watchful cares
do interpose themselves

467
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:23,252
betwixt your eyes and the night?

468
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:25,796
Shall I entreat a word?

469
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:36,836
Here lies the east.
Doth not the day break here?

470
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:39,939
- No.
- O pardon, sir, it doth.

471
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:43,912
Yon gray lines that fret the clouds
are messengers of day.

472
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:46,315
You shall confess
that you are both deceived.

473
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:49,821
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises.

474
00:32:57,096 --> 00:33:00,724
- Give me your hands all over, one by one.
- And let us swear our resolution.

475
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,289
No, not an oath.

476
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:06,500
If not the face of men, the sufferance
of our souls, the time's abuse,

477
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,734
if these be motives weak,
break off betimes,

478
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:10,743
and every man hence to his idle bed.

479
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:12,870
So let high-sighted tyranny range on

480
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:14,880
till each man drop by lottery.

481
00:33:15,215 --> 00:33:18,673
What need we any spur but our own cause
to prick us to redress?

482
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:21,419
What other bond than secret Romans
that have spoke the word

483
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,217
and will not palter?

484
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,651
What other oath
than honesty to honesty engaged,

485
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:28,193
that this shall be or we will fall for it?

486
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:31,019
Swear priests and cowards
and men cautelous,

487
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,191
old feeble carrions and such suffering
souls that welcome wrongs.

488
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:38,833
Unto bad causes swear
such creatures as men doubt,

489
00:33:39,238 --> 00:33:42,003
but do not stain the even virtue
of our enterprise,

490
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:44,441
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirit,

491
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:47,969
to think that or our cause
or our performance did need an oath.

492
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:51,081
But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?

493
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:53,048
I think he will stand very strong with us.

494
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,850
O let us have him, for his silver hairs
will purchase us a good opinion

495
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:59,083
and buy men's voices
to commend our deeds.

496
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:00,989
Let us not leave him out.

497
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:04,620
O name him not. For he will never follow
anything that other men begin.

498
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:07,188
- Then leave him out.
- Indeed, he is not fit.

499
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:12,029
Shall no man else be touched
but only Caesar?

500
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:14,167
Decius, well urged.

501
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:17,237
I think it is not meet Mark Antony,
so well beloved of Caesar,

502
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:18,901
should outlive Caesar.

503
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,943
We shall find in him a shrewd contriver,

504
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:22,913
and, you know, his means,
if he improve them,

505
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:25,450
may well stretch so far as to annoy us all,

506
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:28,316
which to prevent,
let Antony and Caesar fall together.

507
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:31,083
Our course will seem too bloody,
Caius Cassius,

508
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,349
to cut the head off
and then hack the limbs,

509
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:35,655
like wrath in death and envy afterwards.

510
00:34:35,728 --> 00:34:38,094
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.

511
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,860
Let us be sacrificers,
but not butchers, Caius.

512
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:44,297
We all stand up
against the spirit of Caesar.

513
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,895
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.

514
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:48,867
O that we then could come
by Caesar's spirit,

515
00:34:48,941 --> 00:34:52,343
and not dismember Caesar.
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.

516
00:34:52,846 --> 00:34:56,111
And, gentle friends,
let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.

517
00:34:56,183 --> 00:35:00,677
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.

518
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:02,880
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,

519
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:06,050
for he can do no more than Caesar's arm
when Caesar's head is off.

520
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,354
Yet I do fear him,

521
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:11,089
- for the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar.
- Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.

522
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:14,064
If he love Caesar,
all that he can do is to himself.

523
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,291
Take thought and die for Caesar.

524
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:19,003
And that were much he should,
for he is given to sports,

525
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,629
to wildness and much company.

526
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:23,072
There is no fear in him. Let him not die,

527
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:25,770
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter.

528
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:28,204
'Tis time to part.
The morning comes upon us.

529
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:30,010
We'll leave you, Brutus.

530
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:35,820
But it is doubtful yet whether Caesar
will come forth today or no,

531
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:38,356
for he is superstitious grown of late.

532
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:41,587
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
the unaccustomed terror of the night,

533
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,720
and the persuasion of his augurers,
may hold him from the Capitol today.

534
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:49,234
Never fear that.
If he be so resolved, I can oversway him,

535
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:53,235
for he loves to hear that unicorns may be
betrayed with trees,

536
00:35:53,305 --> 00:35:56,433
lions with toils and men with flatterers.

537
00:35:56,575 --> 00:35:59,169
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,

538
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:02,111
he says he does,
being then most flattered.

539
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,739
Let me work,
and I will bring him to the Capitol.

540
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:08,014
Nay, we will all of us be there
to fetch him.

541
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:12,253
By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?

542
00:36:12,324 --> 00:36:14,554
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

543
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:17,061
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,

544
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:18,825
who rated him
for speaking well of Pompey.

545
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:20,526
I wonder none of you have thought of him.

546
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,295
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.

547
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:24,098
He loves me well,
and I have given him reasons.

548
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,502
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

549
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:30,133
And friends, disperse yourselves,
but all remember what you have said,

550
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,869
and show yourselves true Romans.

551
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:34,708
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.

552
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,078
Let not our looks put on our purposes.

553
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,218
And so, good morrow to you, everyone.

554
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,521
Portia, what mean you?
Wherefore rise you now?

555
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,868
It is not for your health thus
to commit your weak condition

556
00:36:56,936 --> 00:37:00,064
- to the raw cold morning.
- Nor for yours neither.

557
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:03,398
You've ungently, Brutus,
stole from my bed,

558
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,404
and yesternight at supper
you suddenly arose and walked about

559
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:09,913
musing and sighing
with your arms across.

560
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:11,539
And when I asked you
what the matter was,

561
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:13,984
you stared upon me with ungentle looks.

562
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:16,584
I urged you further,

563
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:20,347
and then you scratched your head and
too impatiently stamped with your foot.

564
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:22,326
Yet I insisted, yet you answered not,

565
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:26,262
but, with an angry wafture of your hand,
gave sign for me to leave you.

566
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:27,760
So I did,

567
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:31,967
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seemed too much enkindled,

568
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,731
and withal hoping it was
but an effect of humor,

569
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:37,332
which sometime hath his hour
with every man.

570
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,775
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep.

571
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,408
And, could it work
so much upon your shape

572
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:46,416
as it hath much prevailed
on your condition,

573
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:48,544
I should not know you, Brutus.

574
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:53,583
Dear my lord, make me acquainted
with your cause of grief.

575
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:56,151
I am not well in health, and that is all.

576
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:59,196
Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,

577
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:02,291
he would embrace the means
to come by it.

578
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:03,961
Why, so I do.

579
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,470
Good Portia, go to bed.

580
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:10,374
Is Brutus sick?

581
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:12,467
And is it physical to walk unbraced

582
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:15,308
and suck up the humors
of the dank morning?

583
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:16,778
What, is Brutus sick?

584
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,840
And will he steal
out of his wholesome bed

585
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:22,580
to dare the vile contagion of the night,
and add unto his sickness?

586
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:25,122
No, my Brutus.

587
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:28,058
You have some sick offense
within your mind,

588
00:38:28,628 --> 00:38:32,086
which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of.

589
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:34,931
And, upon my knees, I charm you

590
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,901
by my once-commended beauty,

591
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:39,129
by all your vows of love
and that great vow

592
00:38:39,204 --> 00:38:41,365
which did incorporate and make us one,

593
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,274
that you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
why you are heavy,

594
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:49,410
and what men tonight
have had resort to you,

595
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:53,950
for here have been some six or seven who
did hide their faces even from darkness.

596
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,386
Kneel not, gentle Portia.

597
00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:59,084
I should not need
if you were gentle Brutus.

598
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,654
Within the bond of marriage,
tell me, Brutus,

599
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:06,362
is it excepted I should know no secrets
that appertain to you?

600
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:10,301
Am I yourself but, as it were,
in sort or limitation,

601
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:13,200
to keep with you at meals,
comfort your bed,

602
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:14,864
and talk to you sometimes.

603
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:18,741
Dwell I but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure?

604
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:23,072
If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot,
not his wife.

605
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:28,985
You are my true and honorable wife,

606
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:33,022
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
that visit my sad heart.

607
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,620
If this were true,
then should I know this secret.

608
00:39:37,397 --> 00:39:38,830
I grant I am a woman,

609
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:41,696
but withal a woman
that Lord Brutus took to wife.

610
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:45,602
I grant I am a woman, but withal a woman
well-reputed, Cato's daughter.

611
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:51,270
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
being so fathered and so husbanded?

612
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:54,838
Tell me your counsels.
I will not disclose them.

613
00:39:57,783 --> 00:39:59,444
Portia, go in a while.

614
00:39:59,518 --> 00:40:02,919
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my heart.

615
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,148
All my engagements
I will construe to thee,

616
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:07,692
all the charactery of my sad brows.

617
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:19,169
Here is a sick man
that would speak with you.

618
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:24,432
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.

619
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,634
Boy, stand aside.

620
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:28,236
Vouchsafe good morrow
from a feeble tongue.

621
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:31,840
What a time have you chose out,
brave Caius, to wear a kerchief.

622
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,814
- Would you were not sick.
- I am not sick,

623
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:38,220
if Brutus have in hand any exploit
worthy the name of honor.

624
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,155
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

625
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:42,193
had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

626
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:46,028
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
I here discard my sickness.

627
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:49,191
Bid me run,
and I will strive with things impossible.

628
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:51,133
Yea, get the better of them.

629
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:53,967
For it sufficeth that Brutus leads me on.

630
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,606
What's to do?

631
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,336
A piece of work
that will make sick men whole.

632
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:02,240
But are not some whole
but we must make sick?

633
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:04,642
That must we also.

634
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,225
Caesar! Help!

635
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:25,096
Help!

636
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:30,638
They murder Caesar! They murder Caesar!

637
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:32,868
They murdered Caesar!

638
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:35,512
They murdered Caesar!

639
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:39,879
Who's within?

640
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:42,381
Who's within?

641
00:41:44,022 --> 00:41:45,046
My lord.

642
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:48,854
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
and bring me their opinions of success.

643
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:50,394
I will, my lord.

644
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:09,773
Nor heaven nor earth
have been at peace tonight.

645
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:15,649
What mean you, Caesar?

646
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,821
Think you to walk forth?

647
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:20,685
You shall not stir out of your house today.

648
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,583
Caesar shall forth.

649
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:25,161
The things that threatened me
never looked but at my back,

650
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,460
when they shall see the face of Caesar,
they are vanished.

651
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:28,897
Caesar,

652
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:31,799
I never stood on ceremonies.

653
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:33,898
Yet now they fright me.

654
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,740
There is one within, besides
the things that we have heard and seen,

655
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:40,710
recounts most horrid sights
seen by the watch.

656
00:42:41,046 --> 00:42:43,446
A lioness hath whelped in the streets,

657
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:47,551
and graves have yawned
and yielded up their dead.

658
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,354
Fierce fiery warriors
fought upon the clouds,

659
00:42:50,423 --> 00:42:53,688
and ghosts did shriek
and squeal about the streets.

660
00:42:55,295 --> 00:42:58,458
O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,

661
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:01,361
and I do fear them.

662
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,290
Yet Caesar shall go forth,

663
00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:06,736
for these predictions are to the world
in general as to Caesar.

664
00:43:06,806 --> 00:43:10,469
When beggars die,
there are no comets seen.

665
00:43:10,743 --> 00:43:14,839
The heavens themselves
blaze forth the death of princes.

666
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:17,382
Cowards die many times
before their death.

667
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,044
The valiant never taste of death but once.

668
00:43:21,954 --> 00:43:24,081
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,

669
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:27,057
it seems to me most strange
that men should fear,

670
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:30,560
seeing that death, a necessary end,
will come

671
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:33,293
when it will come.

672
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:37,601
What say the augurers?

673
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:40,194
They would not have you
to stir forth today.

674
00:43:40,572 --> 00:43:42,507
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,

675
00:43:42,575 --> 00:43:45,135
they could not find
a heart within the beast.

676
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:49,745
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.

677
00:43:50,183 --> 00:43:53,982
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
if he should stay at home today for fear.

678
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:55,713
No, Caesar shall not.

679
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:58,755
Danger knows full well
that Caesar is more dangerous than he,

680
00:43:58,824 --> 00:44:00,849
and Caesar shall go forth!

681
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:05,094
Alas, my lord, your wisdom
is consumed in confidence.

682
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:08,297
Do not go forth today.

683
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:12,134
Call it my fear that keeps you
in the house and not your own.

684
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:14,563
We'll send Mark Antony
to the senate house,

685
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:17,437
and he shall say you are not well today.

686
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:20,644
Let me prevail in this.

687
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:25,108
Mark Antony shall say I am not well.

688
00:44:27,086 --> 00:44:30,249
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.

689
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,285
Here's Decius Brutus.
He shall tell them so.

690
00:44:36,662 --> 00:44:40,530
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar.

691
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:43,131
I come to fetch you to the senate house.

692
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:46,432
And you are come in very happy time
to bear my greeting to the senators,

693
00:44:46,505 --> 00:44:48,905
and tell them that I will not come today.

694
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,669
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser.

695
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:54,403
I will not come today.
Tell them so, Decius.

696
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:57,341
- Say he is sick.
- Shall Caesar send a lie?

697
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,843
Have I in conquest
stretched mine arm so far

698
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:02,012
to be afeard to tell graybeards the truth?

699
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:04,613
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

700
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:08,384
Most mighty Caesar,
let me know some cause,

701
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:11,321
lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.

702
00:45:11,663 --> 00:45:14,223
The cause is in my will. I will not come.

703
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:16,494
That is enough to satisfy the senate.

704
00:45:17,502 --> 00:45:21,461
But, for your private satisfaction,
because I love you, I will let you know.

705
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,065
Calpurnia here, my wife,
stays me at home.

706
00:45:24,776 --> 00:45:26,870
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,

707
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:31,280
which like a fountain with 100 spouts
did run pure blood.

708
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:34,747
And many lusty Romans came smiling

709
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:37,618
and did bathe their hands in it.

710
00:45:38,757 --> 00:45:42,557
And these does she apply for warnings
and portents and evils imminent,

711
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:45,926
and on her knee hath begged
that I will stay at home today.

712
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:53,632
This dream is all amiss interpreted.

713
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,140
It was a vision fair and fortunate.

714
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:02,479
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
in which so many smiling Romans bathed,

715
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:05,315
signifies that, from you,

716
00:46:05,585 --> 00:46:08,679
great Rome shall suck reviving blood,

717
00:46:08,754 --> 00:46:13,123
and that great men shall press
for tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.

718
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:16,822
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

719
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:19,592
And this way have you well expounded it.

720
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:22,230
I have, when you have
heard what I can say.

721
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:23,893
And know it now.

722
00:46:24,036 --> 00:46:27,733
The senate have concluded
to give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.

723
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:30,770
If you shall send them word
you will not come,

724
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:32,833
their minds may change.

725
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:37,015
Besides, it were a mock apt
to be rendered for some one to say,

726
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,984
"Break up the senate till another time,

727
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:43,211
"when Caesar's wife
shall meet with better dreams."

728
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:44,950
If Caesar hide himself,

729
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:48,653
shall they not whisper,
"Lo, Caesar is afraid?"

730
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:49,988
Pardon me, Caesar,

731
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:53,225
for my dear, dear love to your proceeding
bids me tell you this,

732
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:55,596
and reason to my love is liable.

733
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:58,067
How foolish do your fears seem
now, Calpurnia!

734
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:02,129
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go!

735
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:12,479
And look where Publius
has come to fetch me.

736
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:16,019
- Good morrow, Caesar.
- Welcome, Publius.

737
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:18,815
What, Brutus,
are you stirred so early, too?

738
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:20,691
Good morrow, Casca.

739
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:23,785
Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne'er
so much your enemy

740
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:26,353
as that same ague
which hath made you lean.

741
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:29,294
- What is't o'clock?
- Caesar, 'tis after eight.

742
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:33,597
See. Antony, that revels long
o' nights is notwithstanding up.

743
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:37,740
- Good morrow, Antony.
- So to most noble Caesar.

744
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:45,509
I am to blame to be thus waited for.

745
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:48,547
Good friends, go in
and taste some wine with me,

746
00:47:48,621 --> 00:47:51,249
and we, like friends,
will straightaway go together.

747
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:02,728
Now, Cinna.

748
00:48:02,802 --> 00:48:05,270
Now, Metellus. What, Trebonius!

749
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:07,866
I have an hour's talk in store for you.

750
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,204
Remember that you call on me today.

751
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:14,276
- Be near me, that I may remember you.
- Caesar, I will.

752
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:51,278
"Caesar, beware of Brutus.

753
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,944
"Take heed of Cassius.
Come not near Casca.

754
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,420
"Have an eye to Cinna.
Trust not Trebonius.

755
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,424
"Mark well Metellus Cimber.

756
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:04,824
"Decius Brutus loves thee not.
Thou has wronged Caius Ligarius.

757
00:49:05,664 --> 00:49:10,124
"There is but one mind in all these men,
and it is bent against Caesar.

758
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:12,736
"If thou be'st not immortal,
look about you.

759
00:49:12,805 --> 00:49:15,467
"Security gives way to conspiracy.

760
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:19,871
"The mighty gods defend thee.
Artemidorus."

761
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:37,421
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along.

762
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,691
If thou read this, O Caesar,
thou mayst live.

763
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:45,965
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

764
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:05,112
The ides of March are come.

765
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,884
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.

766
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:15,693
Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.

767
00:50:16,068 --> 00:50:19,435
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read,
at your best leisure, this his humble suit.

768
00:50:19,505 --> 00:50:20,938
O Caesar, read mine first.

769
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:23,496
For mine's a suit that touches Caesar
nearer. Read it, great Caesar.

770
00:50:23,575 --> 00:50:25,805
What touches us ourself
shall be last served.

771
00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:27,572
Delay not, Caesar, read it instantly.

772
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:29,340
What, is the fellow mad?

773
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,449
Sirrah, give place.

774
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:36,179
What, urge you your petitions
in the street?

775
00:50:36,254 --> 00:50:37,721
Come to the Capitol.

776
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:46,223
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.

777
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:49,424
- What enterprise, Popilius?
- Fare you well.

778
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:55,229
What said Popilius Lena?

779
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:57,207
He wished today
our enterprise might thrive.

780
00:50:57,276 --> 00:51:00,803
- I fear our purpose is discovered.
- Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.

781
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:05,612
Brutus, what shall be done?

782
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:09,085
If this be known, Cassius or Caesar
never shall turn back, for I will slay myself.

783
00:51:09,155 --> 00:51:10,383
Cassius, be constant.

784
00:51:10,456 --> 00:51:13,254
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,
for, look, he smiles,

785
00:51:13,325 --> 00:51:15,349
and Caesar doth not change.

786
00:51:18,496 --> 00:51:20,795
Trebonius knows his time,
for, look you, Brutus,

787
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:23,061
he draws Mark Antony out of the way.

788
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:50,022
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
and presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

789
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:53,530
He is addressed.
Press near and second him.

790
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,869
Casca, you are the first
that rears your hand.

791
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:11,973
Are we all ready?

792
00:52:12,217 --> 00:52:15,744
What is now amiss that Caesar
and his senate must redress?

793
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,618
Most high, most mighty,
and most puissant Caesar,

794
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,023
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
an humble heart.

795
00:52:22,093 --> 00:52:23,651
I must prevent thee, Cimber.

796
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:25,959
These couchings
and these lowly courtesies

797
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:30,128
might fire the blood of ordinary men,
and turn pre-ordinance and first decree

798
00:52:30,203 --> 00:52:31,932
into the law of children.

799
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:35,907
Be not fond to think
that Caesar bears such rebel blood

800
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:39,841
that will be thawed from the true quality
by that which melteth fools.

801
00:52:40,145 --> 00:52:41,669
I mean sweet words,

802
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,181
low-crooked courtesies
and base spaniel fawning.

803
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:49,011
Thy brother by decree is banished.

804
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:51,954
If thou dost bend and pray
and fawn for him,

805
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:54,549
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.

806
00:52:55,227 --> 00:52:59,061
Know, Caesar doth not wrong,
nor without cause will he be satisfied.

807
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:01,121
Is there no voice
more worthy than my own

808
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,497
to sound more sweetly
in great Caesar's ear

809
00:53:03,568 --> 00:53:05,969
for the repealing of my banished brother?

810
00:53:06,272 --> 00:53:09,139
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,

811
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:12,644
desiring thee that Publius Cimber
may have an immediate freedom of repeal.

812
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,076
What, Brutus?

813
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,439
Pardon, Caesar. Caesar, pardon.

814
00:53:16,515 --> 00:53:18,449
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,

815
00:53:18,517 --> 00:53:20,951
to beg enfranchisement
for Publius Cimber.

816
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,352
I could be well moved if I were as you.

817
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:26,117
If I could pray to move,
prayers would move me.

818
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:28,623
But I am constant as the northern star,

819
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:32,954
of whose true fixed and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament.

820
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:35,192
The skies are painted
with unnumbered sparks.

821
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:37,700
They are all fire and every one doth shine,

822
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:40,637
but there's but one in all
doth hold his place.

823
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,436
So in the world,
'tis furnished well with men,

824
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:48,105
and men are flesh and blood,
and apprehensive,

825
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,071
yet in the number I do know but one,

826
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:54,709
that unassailable holds on his rank,
unshaked of motion,

827
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,282
and that I am he.
Let me a little show it, even in this.

828
00:53:58,356 --> 00:54:00,551
That I was constant
Cimber should be banished,

829
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,924
and constant do remain to keep him so.

830
00:54:02,995 --> 00:54:04,462
- O, Caesar!
- Hence!

831
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,498
- Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
- Great Caesar!

832
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:10,126
- Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
- Speak, hands, for me!

833
00:54:46,571 --> 00:54:51,407
<i>Et tu, Brute? Then fall Caesar.</i>

834
00:54:57,282 --> 00:54:58,544
Liberty! Freedom!

835
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:00,009
Tyranny is dead!

836
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:02,349
Run hence!
Proclaim, cry it about the streets!

837
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:06,949
Some to the common pulpits and cry out,
"Liberty, freedom, enfranchisement!"

838
00:55:07,026 --> 00:55:09,392
People and Senators, be not affrighted.

839
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:13,860
Fly not, stand still.
Ambition's debt is paid.

840
00:55:14,198 --> 00:55:16,325
- Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
- Where's Publius?

841
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,801
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

842
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,304
Stand fast together, lest some
friend of Caesar's should chance to...

843
00:55:21,372 --> 00:55:23,499
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer.

844
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:26,442
There is no harm intended to your person,
nor to no Roman else.

845
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:28,104
So tell them, Publius.

846
00:55:29,948 --> 00:55:31,916
- Where is Antony?
- Fled to his house amazed.

847
00:55:31,984 --> 00:55:35,750
Men, wives and children stare,
cry out and run, as it were doomsday!

848
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:38,115
Now leave us, Publius.

849
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,488
Lest that the people, rushing on us,
should do your age some mischief.

850
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,926
Do so, and let no man abide this deed,
but we the doers.

851
00:55:57,709 --> 00:55:59,904
Fates, we will know your pleasures.

852
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,179
That we shall die, we know.

853
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:06,609
'Tis but the time and drawing days out
that men stand upon.

854
00:56:06,685 --> 00:56:11,019
Why, he that cuts off 20 years of life,
cuts off so many years of fearing death.

855
00:56:13,725 --> 00:56:16,250
Grant that, and then is death a benefit.

856
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:21,031
So we, Caesar's friends, that have
abridged his time of fearing death.

857
00:56:23,068 --> 00:56:27,402
Stoop, Romans, stoop, and let us
bathe our hands in Caesar's blood.

858
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:31,830
How many ages hence shall
this our lofty scene be acted over,

859
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,635
in states unborn and accents yet unknown.

860
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:38,108
How many times shall
Caesar bleed in sport,

861
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:42,910
that now on Pompey's basis lies along
no worthier than the dust.

862
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:45,147
So oft as that shall be,

863
00:56:45,224 --> 00:56:49,661
so often shall the knot of us be called
the men that gave their country liberty.

864
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:03,073
Soft, who comes here?

865
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:06,405
A friend of Antony's.

866
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,645
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.

867
00:57:11,717 --> 00:57:13,844
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down.

868
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:16,388
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say,

869
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,890
"Brutus is noble, wise, valiant and honest.

870
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,986
"Caesar was mighty, bold,
royal and loving.

871
00:57:23,462 --> 00:57:25,555
"Say I love Brutus and I honor him.

872
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:28,827
"Say I feared Caesar,
honored him and loved him.

873
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:33,396
"If Brutus will vouchsafe that
Antony may safely come to him

874
00:57:33,772 --> 00:57:37,037
"and be resolved how Caesar
hath deserved to lie in death,

875
00:57:37,342 --> 00:57:40,869
"Mark Antony shall not love
Caesar dead so well as Brutus living,

876
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:44,041
"but will follow the fortunes
and affairs of noble Brutus

877
00:57:44,116 --> 00:57:46,517
"through the hazards of this untrod state

878
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:48,142
"with all true faith."

879
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:50,816
So says my master Antony.

880
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:55,557
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.
I never thought him worse.

881
00:57:56,128 --> 00:57:59,154
Tell him, so please him come
unto this place, he shall be satisfied,

882
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:01,995
and, by my honor, depart untouched.

883
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:04,463
I'll fetch him presently.

884
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:09,806
I know that we shall have him well
to friend.

885
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,103
I wish we may.

886
00:58:11,276 --> 00:58:13,300
And yet I have a mind
that fears him much,

887
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:16,437
and my misgiving still fall
shrewdly to the purpose.

888
00:58:41,472 --> 00:58:44,339
Welcome, Mark Antony.

889
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,325
O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low?

890
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:05,191
Are all thy conquests, glories,
triumphs, spoils,

891
00:59:05,264 --> 00:59:07,357
shrunk to this little measure?

892
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:10,592
Fare thee well.

893
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:18,438
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,

894
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,172
who else must be let blood,
who else is rank.

895
00:59:21,513 --> 00:59:25,313
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
as Caesar's death hour,

896
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:28,944
nor no instrument of half that worth
as those your swords,

897
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:32,047
made rich with the most
noble blood of all this world.

898
00:59:32,457 --> 00:59:34,322
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

899
00:59:34,393 --> 00:59:38,261
now, whilst your purpled hands do reek
and smoke, fulfill your pleasure.

900
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:42,993
Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die.

901
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:47,702
No place will please me so,
no mean of death, as here by Caesar,

902
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:49,740
and by you cut off,

903
00:59:51,176 --> 00:59:53,736
the choice and master spirits of this age.

904
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:58,538
O Antony, beg not your death of us.

905
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:01,209
Though now we must appear
bloody and cruel,

906
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:03,617
as by our hands and this our
present act, you see we do,

907
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:07,055
yet see you but our hands and this
the bleeding business they have done,

908
01:00:07,124 --> 01:00:08,786
our hearts you see not.

909
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:12,562
They are pitiful.
And pity to the general wrong of Rome,

910
01:00:12,631 --> 01:00:16,089
as fire drives out fire, so pity, pity,
hath done this deed on Caesar.

911
01:00:16,168 --> 01:00:19,626
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
in the disposing of new dignities.

912
01:00:19,705 --> 01:00:21,764
Only be patient
till we have appeased the multitude

913
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,307
beside themselves with fear.

914
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,865
And then we will deliver you
the cause why I,

915
01:00:25,943 --> 01:00:29,209
that did love Caesar when I struck him,
have thus proceeded.

916
01:00:29,281 --> 01:00:31,078
I doubt not of your wisdom.

917
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,848
Let each man render me his bloody hand.

918
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:36,987
First, Marcus Brutus, do I shake with you.

919
01:00:37,856 --> 01:00:40,324
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.

920
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:44,188
Now, Decius Brutus, yours.

921
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:47,362
Yours, Metellus.

922
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:49,790
Yours, Cinna.

923
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:52,597
And my valiant Casca, yours.

924
01:00:54,473 --> 01:00:57,704
Though last, not least in love,
yours, good Trebonius.

925
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:06,007
Gentlemen all.

926
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,917
Alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands

927
01:01:09,988 --> 01:01:11,888
on such slippery ground,
that one of two bad ways

928
01:01:11,957 --> 01:01:15,949
you must conceit me,
either a coward or a flatterer.

929
01:01:19,131 --> 01:01:21,622
That I did love thee, Caesar, O it is true.

930
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:24,560
If then thy spirit look upon us now,

931
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:26,866
shall it not grieve thee dearer
than thy death

932
01:01:26,938 --> 01:01:29,099
to see thy Antony making his peace,

933
01:01:29,474 --> 01:01:33,843
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
most noble in the presence of thy corse?

934
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:37,273
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,

935
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:39,874
weeping as fast
as they stream forth thy blood,

936
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:44,353
it would become me better than to close
in terms of friendship with thine enemies.

937
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:47,987
- Mark Antony?
- Pardon me, Caius Cassius.

938
01:01:49,393 --> 01:01:51,759
The enemies of Caesar shall say this.

939
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:54,128
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

940
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:56,764
I blame you not for praising Caesar so,

941
01:01:56,835 --> 01:01:59,303
but what compact mean you
to have with us?

942
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,063
Will you be pricked in number
of our friends,

943
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:02,572
or shall we on, and not depend on you?

944
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:04,542
Therefore I took your hands,

945
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:09,071
but was indeed swayed from the point
by looking down on Caesar.

946
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:12,572
Friends am I with you all and love you all.

947
01:02:13,118 --> 01:02:14,642
Upon this hope

948
01:02:15,487 --> 01:02:19,253
that you shall give me reasons
why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

949
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:22,054
Or else were this a savage spectacle.

950
01:02:22,427 --> 01:02:24,452
Our reasons are so full of good regard

951
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:27,760
that were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
you should be satisfied.

952
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,160
That's all I seek,

953
01:02:29,529 --> 01:02:33,397
and am moreover suitor that I may
produce his body to the marketplace,

954
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:37,491
and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
speak in the order of his funeral.

955
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,003
- You shall, Mark Antony.
- Brutus, a word with you.

956
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:48,541
Do not consent that Antony
speak in his funeral.

957
01:02:48,614 --> 01:02:50,377
Know you how much
the people may be moved

958
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:52,610
- by that which he will utter?
- By your pardon,

959
01:02:52,684 --> 01:02:56,051
I will myself into the pulpit first, and
show the reason of our Caesar's death.

960
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:59,420
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission,

961
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:02,891
and that we are contented Caesar shall
have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.

962
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,122
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

963
01:03:05,197 --> 01:03:08,223
I know not what may fall. I like it not.

964
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,833
Mark Antony, here,
take you Caesar's body.

965
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:22,039
You shall not in your funeral speech
blame us,

966
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:24,305
but speak all good
you can devise of Caesar,

967
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,543
and say you do it by our permission.

968
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:29,484
Else shall you not have any
hand at all about his funeral,

969
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:32,022
and you shall speak in the same pulpit
whereto I am going

970
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:33,818
after my speech is ended.

971
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:37,492
Be it so. I do desire no more.

972
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:52,637
O, pardon me,
thou bleeding piece of earth,

973
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:56,569
that I am meek and gentle
with these butchers.

974
01:04:59,244 --> 01:05:03,908
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times.

975
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:11,382
Woe to the hand
that shed this costly blood.

976
01:05:13,324 --> 01:05:16,191
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,

977
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:19,497
which like dumb mouths
do ope their ruby lips

978
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:22,090
to beg the voice
and utterance of my tongue,

979
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,934
a curse shall light upon the limbs of men.

980
01:05:27,073 --> 01:05:31,169
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall
cumber all the parts of Italy.

981
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:35,644
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
and dreadful objects so familiar,

982
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:38,239
that mothers shall but smile
when they behold their infants

983
01:05:38,317 --> 01:05:39,875
quartered with the hands of war.

984
01:05:39,952 --> 01:05:42,944
All pity choked with custom of fell deed.

985
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:44,880
And Caesar's spirit,

986
01:05:45,591 --> 01:05:49,891
ranging for revenge,
with Ate by his side come hot from hell,

987
01:05:50,395 --> 01:05:54,661
shall in these confines
with a monarch's voice cry "Havoc!"

988
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:59,368
And let slip the dogs of war.

989
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:05,073
That this foul deed shall smell
above the earth

990
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:09,074
with carrion men, groaning for burial.

991
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:29,389
Caesar!

992
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:44,239
Romans!

993
01:06:45,283 --> 01:06:47,251
Countrymen!

994
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:54,854
I will hear Brutus speak!

995
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,687
Hear me for my cause!

996
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:02,866
Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks!

997
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,298
Romans,

998
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,631
countrymen,

999
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,775
be patient till the last!

1000
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:15,205
Hear me for my cause,
and be silent, that you may hear.

1001
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:17,945
Believe me for mine honor,

1002
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:21,316
and have respect to mine honor,
that you may believe.

1003
01:07:21,553 --> 01:07:24,545
Censure me in your wisdom,
and awake your senses,

1004
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,284
that you may the better judge.

1005
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:27,689
Caesar! Caesar!

1006
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:29,624
Caesar!

1007
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:37,927
If there be any in this assembly,

1008
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:40,561
any dear friend of Caesar's,

1009
01:07:41,006 --> 01:07:44,874
to him I say that Brutus' love
to Caesar was no less than his.

1010
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:50,237
If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar,

1011
01:07:50,415 --> 01:07:52,280
this is my answer.

1012
01:07:52,617 --> 01:07:57,281
Not that I loved Caesar less,
but that I loved Rome more.

1013
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,526
Had you rather Caesar were living,
and die all slaves,

1014
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:05,923
than that Caesar were dead,
to live all free men?

1015
01:08:05,997 --> 01:08:07,589
- No!
- No!

1016
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,332
- No!
- No!

1017
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:14,897
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him.

1018
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,835
As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.

1019
01:08:17,942 --> 01:08:20,342
As he was valiant, I honor him.

1020
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:24,314
But as he was ambitious, I slew him.

1021
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:28,484
There's tears for his love,
joy for his fortune,

1022
01:08:28,553 --> 01:08:33,184
honor for his valor,
and death for his ambition.

1023
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:38,163
Who is here so base
that will be a bondsman?

1024
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:40,994
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1025
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:44,800
Who is here so rude
that would not be a Roman?

1026
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:47,570
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1027
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:53,368
Who is here so vile
that will not love his country?

1028
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:56,879
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1029
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,909
I pause for a reply.

1030
01:09:06,658 --> 01:09:08,285
None, Brutus. None!

1031
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,418
None!

1032
01:09:09,494 --> 01:09:11,086
- None!
- None!

1033
01:09:11,763 --> 01:09:13,754
- None!
- None!

1034
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:16,164
Then none have I offended.

1035
01:09:16,802 --> 01:09:20,499
I have done no more to Caesar
than you shall do to Brutus.

1036
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:24,840
The question of his death
is enrolled in the Capitol.

1037
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,743
His glory not extenuated,
wherein he was worthy,

1038
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,141
nor his offenses enforced,

1039
01:09:30,282 --> 01:09:32,477
for which he suffered death.

1040
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:55,565
Here comes his body,

1041
01:09:55,707 --> 01:09:57,538
mourned by Mark Antony,

1042
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:02,803
who, though he had no hand in his death,
shall receive the benefit of his dying,

1043
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:07,543
a place in the commonwealth,
as which of you shall not?

1044
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:11,018
With this I depart.

1045
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,120
That, as I slew Caesar
for the good of Rome,

1046
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:19,164
I have the same dagger for myself,

1047
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,491
when it shall please my country
to need my death.

1048
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:24,694
- Live, Brutus!
- Live! Live!

1049
01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:26,999
- Live!
- Live!

1050
01:10:36,147 --> 01:10:39,344
Bring him with triumph
home unto his house!

1051
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:42,649
- Give him a statue with his ancestors!
- Live, Brutus!

1052
01:10:42,722 --> 01:10:43,746
- Live!
- Live!

1053
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,018
Let him be Caesar!

1054
01:10:46,092 --> 01:10:49,528
Caesar's better parts
shall be crowned in Brutus!

1055
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,958
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

1056
01:10:53,865 --> 01:10:56,265
- Good countrymen.
- Peace! Silence!

1057
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:58,165
Brutus speaks!

1058
01:10:59,104 --> 01:11:02,301
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,

1059
01:11:02,574 --> 01:11:05,236
and for my sake, stay here with Antony.

1060
01:11:05,744 --> 01:11:08,076
Do grace to Caesar's corpse,

1061
01:11:08,413 --> 01:11:11,576
and grace his speech
tending to Caesar's glories,

1062
01:11:11,716 --> 01:11:15,174
which Mark Antony, by our permission,
is allowed to make.

1063
01:11:15,654 --> 01:11:18,054
I do entreat you, not a man depart,

1064
01:11:18,423 --> 01:11:20,983
save I alone, till Antony hath spoke.

1065
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,999
Stay, ho! Let us hear Mark Antony!

1066
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:31,968
Let him go up into the public chair.
We'll hear him.

1067
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,901
Noble Antony, go up.

1068
01:11:34,272 --> 01:11:37,435
For Brutus' sake, I am beholden to you.

1069
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:39,372
What does he say of Brutus?

1070
01:11:39,444 --> 01:11:43,641
He says for Brutus' sake,
he finds himself beholding to us all.

1071
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,862
It were best he speak no harm
of Brutus here!

1072
01:12:03,936 --> 01:12:06,666
- This Caesar was a tyrant!
- Nay, that's certain.

1073
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,104
We are blessed that Rome is rid of him!

1074
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:12,169
You gentle Romans.

1075
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:16,270
Gentle Romans, hear me!

1076
01:12:24,956 --> 01:12:29,018
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears.

1077
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,736
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

1078
01:12:39,971 --> 01:12:44,135
The evil that men do lives after them,
the good is oft interred with their bones.

1079
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:46,006
So let it be with Caesar.

1080
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:51,615
The noble Brutus hath told you
Caesar was ambitious.

1081
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,448
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

1082
01:12:56,054 --> 01:12:58,818
and grievously hath Caesar answered it.

1083
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:04,190
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,
for Brutus is an honorable man,

1084
01:13:04,896 --> 01:13:07,387
so are they all, all honorable men,

1085
01:13:08,099 --> 01:13:10,659
come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

1086
01:13:12,003 --> 01:13:15,131
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.

1087
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:18,368
But Brutus says he was ambitious,

1088
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,204
and Brutus is an honorable man.

1089
01:13:22,948 --> 01:13:25,280
He hath brought many captives
home to Rome,

1090
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:29,582
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

1091
01:13:31,456 --> 01:13:34,152
When that the poor have cried,
Caesar hath wept.

1092
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:38,488
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.

1093
01:13:39,598 --> 01:13:42,192
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,

1094
01:13:43,035 --> 01:13:45,265
and Brutus is an honorable man.

1095
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:51,803
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

1096
01:13:52,144 --> 01:13:54,407
which he did thrice refuse.

1097
01:13:54,979 --> 01:13:57,174
Was this ambition?

1098
01:13:58,316 --> 01:14:02,252
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
and, sure, he is an honorable man.

1099
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:09,055
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

1100
01:14:09,928 --> 01:14:12,761
but here I am to speak what I do know.

1101
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,767
You all did love him once,
not without cause.

1102
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:20,467
What cause withholds
you then to mourn for him?

1103
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:24,642
O judgment!
Thou art fled to brutish beasts,

1104
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,106
and men have lost their reason!

1105
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:36,418
Bear with me.
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

1106
01:14:36,488 --> 01:14:38,922
and I must pause till it come back to me.

1107
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,432
Methinks there is much reason
in his saying.

1108
01:14:51,803 --> 01:14:55,603
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Caesar has had great wrong.

1109
01:14:56,007 --> 01:14:57,600
Has he, masters?

1110
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,435
I fear there will a worse come in his place.

1111
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,171
Marked ye his words?

1112
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,881
He would not take the crown.

1113
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:06,315
Therefore it is certain
he was not ambitious.

1114
01:15:06,385 --> 01:15:09,218
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

1115
01:15:10,456 --> 01:15:13,015
There's not a nobler man
in Rome than Antony.

1116
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:17,417
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

1117
01:15:17,962 --> 01:15:21,398
Poor soul.
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.

1118
01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:26,699
But yesterday, the word of Caesar
might have stood against the world.

1119
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:31,836
Now lies he there, and none
so poor to do him reverence.

1120
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:35,779
O masters!

1121
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:42,208
If I were disposed to stir your hearts
and minds to mutiny and rage,

1122
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:45,254
I should do Brutus wrong
and Cassius wrong,

1123
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:49,155
who, you all know, are honorable men.

1124
01:15:51,062 --> 01:15:53,155
I will not do them wrong.

1125
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:55,924
I rather choose to wrong the dead,

1126
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,630
to wrong myself and you,
than I will wrong such honorable men.

1127
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:02,438
But here's a parchment

1128
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:06,573
with the seal of Caesar.
I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will.

1129
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:09,479
Let but the commons hear this testament,

1130
01:16:10,748 --> 01:16:13,546
which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,

1131
01:16:14,018 --> 01:16:17,112
and they would go
and kiss dead Caesar's wounds,

1132
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:20,280
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood,

1133
01:16:20,592 --> 01:16:24,824
yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
and, dying, mention it within their wills,

1134
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:27,930
bequeathing it as a rich legacy
unto their issue.

1135
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:30,432
We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony!

1136
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,468
We will hear Caesar's will!

1137
01:16:32,536 --> 01:16:34,130
- The will!
- The will!

1138
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,195
We'll hear it, Antony!

1139
01:16:35,274 --> 01:16:38,107
Have patience, gentle friends.
I must not read it.

1140
01:16:38,877 --> 01:16:41,812
It is not meet you know
how Caesar loved you.

1141
01:16:42,214 --> 01:16:45,115
You are not wood,
you are not stones, but men.

1142
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,016
And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,

1143
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:50,317
it will inflame you, it will make you mad.

1144
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,620
It is good you know not
that you are his heirs.

1145
01:16:53,959 --> 01:16:56,449
For if you should,
O what would come of it?

1146
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:58,495
Read the will. We'll hear it, Antony!

1147
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:01,157
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will!

1148
01:17:01,266 --> 01:17:02,699
Read us the will!

1149
01:17:03,968 --> 01:17:06,459
Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?

1150
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:09,005
I have overshot myself to tell you of it.

1151
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:13,701
I fear I wrong the honorable men
whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.

1152
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:15,610
They were traitors. Honorable men!

1153
01:17:15,681 --> 01:17:17,376
- They were villains, murderers!
- The will!

1154
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:18,882
The will!

1155
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,855
You will compel me then to read the will?

1156
01:17:26,024 --> 01:17:28,288
Then make a ring around
the corpse of Caesar,

1157
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:30,554
and let me show you him
that made the will.

1158
01:17:30,628 --> 01:17:32,960
Shall I descend,
and will you give me leave?

1159
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:37,365
- Come down!
- Come down!

1160
01:17:57,388 --> 01:17:59,788
If you have tears,

1161
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:02,793
prepare to shed them now.

1162
01:18:06,931 --> 01:18:09,058
You all do know this mantle.

1163
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:12,862
I remember the first time ever
Caesar put it on.

1164
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:17,298
It was on a summer's evening in his tent
that day he overcame the Nervii.

1165
01:18:18,142 --> 01:18:20,907
Look, in this place ran
Cassius' dagger through.

1166
01:18:21,547 --> 01:18:23,674
See what a rent the envious Casca made.

1167
01:18:23,749 --> 01:18:27,344
Through this
the well-beloved Brutus stabbed,

1168
01:18:28,253 --> 01:18:32,713
and, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,

1169
01:18:33,192 --> 01:18:37,561
as rushing out of doors, to be resolved
if Brutus so unkindly knocked or no.

1170
01:18:38,063 --> 01:18:40,587
For Brutus, as you know,
was Caesar's angel.

1171
01:18:41,165 --> 01:18:44,362
Judge, O you gods,
how dearly Caesar loved him!

1172
01:18:44,836 --> 01:18:47,669
This was the most unkindest cut of all.

1173
01:18:47,905 --> 01:18:51,534
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
ingratitude,

1174
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:55,107
more strong than traitors' arms,
quite vanquished him,

1175
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:57,278
then burst his mighty heart,

1176
01:18:57,349 --> 01:18:59,647
and, in his mantle muffling up his face,

1177
01:18:59,952 --> 01:19:03,752
even at the base of Pompey's statue,
which all the while ran blood,

1178
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:06,849
great Caesar fell.

1179
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:12,259
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

1180
01:19:13,197 --> 01:19:14,562
Then I,

1181
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:17,800
and you, and all of us fell down,

1182
01:19:17,902 --> 01:19:20,803
whilst bloody treason flourished over us.

1183
01:19:25,309 --> 01:19:26,742
Oh.

1184
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,639
Now you weep.

1185
01:19:30,549 --> 01:19:33,711
And I perceive you feel the dint of pity.

1186
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:37,379
These are gracious drops.

1187
01:19:39,323 --> 01:19:43,987
Kind souls, what, weep you when you
but behold our Caesar's vesture wounded?

1188
01:19:45,163 --> 01:19:46,756
Look you here.

1189
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:50,298
Here is himself, marred,
as you see, with traitors.

1190
01:19:54,673 --> 01:19:56,300
O noble Caesar.

1191
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,407
O most bloody sight.

1192
01:20:09,288 --> 01:20:11,779
- Traitors.
- Villains.

1193
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:21,160
- We will be revenged!
- Let not a traitor live!

1194
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:23,998
Stay, countrymen!

1195
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:33,369
Good friends, sweet friends,
let me not stir you up

1196
01:20:33,444 --> 01:20:35,674
to such a sudden flood of mutiny.

1197
01:20:36,547 --> 01:20:39,072
They that have done this deed
are honorable.

1198
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:43,179
What private griefs they have, alas,
I know not

1199
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,722
that made them do it.

1200
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,621
They are wise and honorable,

1201
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:49,354
and will, no doubt,
with reasons answer you.

1202
01:20:51,229 --> 01:20:53,697
I come not, friends,
to steal away your hearts.

1203
01:20:53,764 --> 01:20:55,959
I am no orator, as Brutus is,

1204
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:59,135
but, as you know me all,
a plain blunt man

1205
01:20:59,203 --> 01:21:02,536
that loved my friend,
and that they know full well

1206
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,871
that gave me public leave to speak of him.

1207
01:21:04,942 --> 01:21:08,810
For I have neither wit, nor words,
nor worth, action, nor utterance,

1208
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,474
nor the power of speech
to stir men's blood.

1209
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:15,413
I only speak right on. I tell you that
which you yourselves do know,

1210
01:21:15,686 --> 01:21:19,782
show you sweet Caesar's wounds,
poor, poor dumb mouths,

1211
01:21:19,857 --> 01:21:21,688
and bid them speak for me.

1212
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,019
But were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony,

1213
01:21:26,832 --> 01:21:30,268
there were an Antony
would ruffle up your spirits,

1214
01:21:30,702 --> 01:21:33,296
and put a tongue
in every wound of Caesar

1215
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:36,102
that should move the stones of Rome
to rise and mutiny.

1216
01:21:36,174 --> 01:21:38,404
We'll mutiny!
We'll burn the house of Brutus!

1217
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,570
- Yet hear me, countrymen!
- We'll mutiny!

1218
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,341
Yet hear me speak!

1219
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,813
Why, friends, you go
to do you know not what.

1220
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:48,846
Wherein hath Caesar
thus deserved your love?

1221
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,288
Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.

1222
01:21:52,357 --> 01:21:54,188
You have forgot the will I told you of.

1223
01:21:54,259 --> 01:21:55,419
The will!

1224
01:21:57,729 --> 01:22:01,221
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.

1225
01:22:02,267 --> 01:22:06,966
To every Roman citizen he gives,
to every several man,

1226
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:09,339
75 drachmas!

1227
01:22:12,343 --> 01:22:15,801
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,

1228
01:22:16,447 --> 01:22:20,406
his private arbors and new-planted
orchards on this side Tiber.

1229
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:24,646
He hath left them you
and to your heirs forever.

1230
01:22:25,423 --> 01:22:29,360
Common pleasures,
to walk abroad and recreate yourselves.

1231
01:22:31,997 --> 01:22:33,828
Here was a Caesar.

1232
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:38,230
When comes such another?

1233
01:22:38,302 --> 01:22:39,735
Never, never!

1234
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:43,804
Go fetch fire!

1235
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:46,775
Come away, away!

1236
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:01,107
These many then shall die.
Their names are pricked.

1237
01:24:01,185 --> 01:24:02,914
Your brother too must die.

1238
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:05,616
- Consent you, Lepidus?
- I do consent.

1239
01:24:06,257 --> 01:24:07,281
Prick him down, Antony.

1240
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:09,690
Upon condition Publius shall not live,

1241
01:24:10,561 --> 01:24:12,826
who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.

1242
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,457
He shall not live.
Look, with a spot, I damn him.

1243
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,994
But, Lepidus, go you fetch Caesar's will,

1244
01:24:21,172 --> 01:24:24,539
and we then shall determine
how to cut off some charge in legacies.

1245
01:24:24,608 --> 01:24:25,973
What, shall I meet you here?

1246
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:28,068
Or here, or at the Capitol.

1247
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:39,286
This is a slight unmeritable man,
meet to be sent on errands.

1248
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:42,283
Is it fit, the three-fold world divided,

1249
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,658
he should stand
one of the three to share it?

1250
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,196
So you thought him.

1251
01:24:46,397 --> 01:24:48,559
And took his voice
who should be pricked to die

1252
01:24:48,633 --> 01:24:50,999
in our black sentence and prescription.

1253
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:54,800
Octavius, I have seen more days than you.

1254
01:24:55,073 --> 01:24:57,200
And though we lay these honors
on this man

1255
01:24:57,275 --> 01:24:59,937
to ease ourselves
of diverse slanderous loads,

1256
01:25:00,278 --> 01:25:03,213
he shall but bear them
as the ass bears gold,

1257
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:07,984
to groan and sweat under the business,
either led or driven, as we point the way.

1258
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,211
And having brought our treasure
where we will,

1259
01:25:10,288 --> 01:25:12,881
then take we down his load
and turn him off,

1260
01:25:13,057 --> 01:25:16,720
like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
and graze in common.

1261
01:25:16,827 --> 01:25:20,524
You may do your will,
but he's a tried and valiant soldier.

1262
01:25:20,931 --> 01:25:25,392
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
I do appoint him store of provender.

1263
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:28,166
And now, Octavius, listen great things.

1264
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:31,204
Brutus and Cassius are levying powers.

1265
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:32,538
We must straight make head.

1266
01:25:32,611 --> 01:25:35,045
Therefore let our alliance be combined,

1267
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,807
and let us presently go sit in council,

1268
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,372
how covert matters
may be best disclosed

1269
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,315
and open perils surest answered.

1270
01:25:41,385 --> 01:25:46,220
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
and bayed about with many enemies,

1271
01:25:46,323 --> 01:25:50,589
and some that smile have in their hearts,
I fear, millions of mischiefs.

1272
01:26:58,762 --> 01:27:01,663
Stand, ho!

1273
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:05,991
Give the word, ho!

1274
01:27:06,203 --> 01:27:07,864
Stand, ho!

1275
01:27:07,938 --> 01:27:09,270
Stand, ho.

1276
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:23,010
What now, Lucilius? Is Cassius near?

1277
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:27,046
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master.

1278
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,821
He greets me well.

1279
01:27:32,363 --> 01:27:35,093
Your master, Pindarus,
in his own change, or by ill officers,

1280
01:27:35,165 --> 01:27:38,498
hath given me some worthy cause
to wish things done, undone,

1281
01:27:38,569 --> 01:27:40,264
but if he be at hand, I shall be satisfied.

1282
01:27:40,337 --> 01:27:43,272
I do not doubt but that
my noble master will appear,

1283
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,434
such as he is, full of regard and honor.

1284
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,171
He is not doubted.

1285
01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:51,978
A word, Lucilius.
How he received you, let me be resolved.

1286
01:27:52,317 --> 01:27:55,775
With courtesy and with respect enough,
but not with such familiar instances,

1287
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,187
nor with such free and friendly
conference, as he hath used of old.

1288
01:27:59,257 --> 01:28:01,953
Thou has described a hot friend cooling.

1289
01:28:02,093 --> 01:28:05,062
Ever note, Lucilius, when love begins
to sicken and decay,

1290
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:07,325
it useth an enforced ceremony.

1291
01:28:07,465 --> 01:28:09,490
There are no tricks
in plain and simple faith.

1292
01:28:09,567 --> 01:28:11,057
Stand, ho!

1293
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,775
Most noble brother,
you have done me wrong.

1294
01:28:26,851 --> 01:28:29,547
Judge me, you gods!
Wrong I mine enemies?

1295
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:31,054
And, if not so,
how should I wrong a brother?

1296
01:28:31,122 --> 01:28:34,023
Brutus, this sober form of yours
hides wrongs, and when you do them...

1297
01:28:34,092 --> 01:28:36,720
Cassius, be content.
Speak your griefs softly.

1298
01:28:36,828 --> 01:28:38,125
I do know you well.

1299
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:40,756
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
which should perceive nothing

1300
01:28:40,832 --> 01:28:43,197
but love from us, let us not wrangle.

1301
01:28:46,036 --> 01:28:49,437
That you have wronged me doth appear
in this. You have condemned and noted

1302
01:28:49,506 --> 01:28:52,441
Lucius Pella for taking bribes here
of the Sardians.

1303
01:28:52,943 --> 01:28:56,971
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
because I knew the man, were slighted off.

1304
01:28:57,048 --> 01:28:59,073
You wronged yourself
to write in such a case.

1305
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:01,141
In such a time as this it is not meet
that every nice offense

1306
01:29:01,219 --> 01:29:02,243
should bear its comment.

1307
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,254
Let me tell you, Cassius,
you yourself are much condemned

1308
01:29:04,322 --> 01:29:05,516
to have an itching palm,

1309
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:08,183
to sell and mart your offices
for gold to undeservers.

1310
01:29:08,258 --> 01:29:10,351
I an itching palm!

1311
01:29:11,061 --> 01:29:12,551
You know that you are Brutus
that speak this,

1312
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:15,120
or, by the gods,
this speech were else your last!

1313
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,531
The name of Cassius honors
this corruption,

1314
01:29:17,601 --> 01:29:19,432
and chastisement doth, therefore,
hide his head.

1315
01:29:19,503 --> 01:29:20,527
Chastisement!

1316
01:29:20,604 --> 01:29:23,129
Remember March,
the ides of March, remember.

1317
01:29:23,474 --> 01:29:26,034
Did not great Julius bleed
for justice sake?

1318
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:29,380
What villain touched his body
that did stab, and not for justice?

1319
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:32,508
What, shall one of us that struck
the foremost man of all this world

1320
01:29:32,585 --> 01:29:36,520
but for supporting robbers, shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes,

1321
01:29:36,588 --> 01:29:40,149
and sell the mighty space
of our large honors for so much trash

1322
01:29:40,392 --> 01:29:42,019
as may be grasped thus?

1323
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:45,229
I'd rather be a dog and bay the moon
than such a Roman.

1324
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:47,287
Brutus, bay not me. I'll not endure it.

1325
01:29:47,365 --> 01:29:49,162
You forget yourself to hedge me in.

1326
01:29:49,234 --> 01:29:52,431
I am a soldier, I, older in action,
abler than yourself to make conditions.

1327
01:29:52,504 --> 01:29:53,835
Go to. You are not Cassius.

1328
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:55,463
- I am.
- I say you are not.

1329
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,098
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.

1330
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:59,506
Have mind upon your health.
Tempt me no further.

1331
01:29:59,576 --> 01:30:01,203
Away, slight man.

1332
01:30:02,946 --> 01:30:04,004
Is it possible?

1333
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:06,482
Must I give way and room
to your rash choler?

1334
01:30:06,551 --> 01:30:09,042
Shall I be frighted
when a madman stares?

1335
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:12,913
O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?

1336
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,093
All this! Ay, more.
Fret till your proud heart breaks.

1337
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:19,289
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
and make your bondmen tremble.

1338
01:30:19,364 --> 01:30:20,831
Must I budge?

1339
01:30:20,932 --> 01:30:21,990
Must I observe you?

1340
01:30:22,067 --> 01:30:24,592
Must I stand and crouch
under your testy humor?

1341
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,159
By the gods, you shall digest
the venom of your spleen,

1342
01:30:27,237 --> 01:30:29,398
though it do split you,
for, from this day forth,

1343
01:30:29,473 --> 01:30:32,909
I'll use you for my mirth, yea,
for my laughter, when you are waspish.

1344
01:30:32,976 --> 01:30:34,534
Is it come to this?

1345
01:30:34,611 --> 01:30:35,703
You say you are a better soldier.

1346
01:30:35,779 --> 01:30:38,873
Let it appear so. Make your vaunting true,
and it shall please me well.

1347
01:30:38,949 --> 01:30:42,113
For mine own part, I shall be glad
to learn of noble men.

1348
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,011
You wrong me every way.
You wrong me, Brutus.

1349
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:47,388
I said an elder soldier, not a better.

1350
01:30:47,759 --> 01:30:50,592
- Did I say better?
- If you did, I care not.

1351
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,496
When Caesar lived,
he durst not thus have moved me.

1352
01:30:53,564 --> 01:30:56,397
Peace, peace!
You durst not so have tempted him.

1353
01:30:56,467 --> 01:30:58,025
- I durst not!
- No!

1354
01:30:58,102 --> 01:30:59,433
What, durst not tempt him?

1355
01:30:59,503 --> 01:31:00,765
For your life you durst not.

1356
01:31:00,838 --> 01:31:04,935
Do not presume too much upon my love.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

1357
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:07,500
You have done that
you should be sorry for.

1358
01:31:07,612 --> 01:31:11,207
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
for I am armed so strong in honesty,

1359
01:31:11,282 --> 01:31:14,946
that they pass by me as the idle wind,
which I respect not.

1360
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:19,379
I did send to you for certain sums of gold,
which you denied me,

1361
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:21,891
for I can raise no money by vile means.

1362
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:26,086
I did send to you for gold
to pay my legions, which you denied me.

1363
01:31:26,264 --> 01:31:27,322
Was that done like Cassius?

1364
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:28,763
- I denied you not!
- You did.

1365
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,996
I did not. He was but a fool
that brought my answer back.

1366
01:31:32,103 --> 01:31:33,866
Brutus has rived my heart.

1367
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,339
A friend should bear
his friend's infirmities,

1368
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:38,034
but Brutus makes mine
greater than they are.

1369
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:40,043
I do not, till you practice them on me.

1370
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:42,238
- You love me not.
- I do not like your faults.

1371
01:31:42,313 --> 01:31:44,246
A friendly eye could never see such faults.

1372
01:31:44,314 --> 01:31:45,838
A flatterer's would not,

1373
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:48,180
though they do appear as huge
as high Olympus.

1374
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:55,248
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,

1375
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:58,254
revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,

1376
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,991
for Cassius is aweary of the world.

1377
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:03,993
Hated by one he loves,
braved by his brother,

1378
01:32:04,369 --> 01:32:08,032
checked like a bondman,
all his faults observed,

1379
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:12,735
set in a notebook, learned and conned
by rote to cast into my teeth.

1380
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:16,608
O, I could weep the spirit from mine eyes!

1381
01:32:18,549 --> 01:32:20,881
Here is my dagger,
and here my naked breast.

1382
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:23,442
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth.

1383
01:32:23,587 --> 01:32:26,148
I, that denied thee gold,
will give my heart.

1384
01:32:26,491 --> 01:32:28,755
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar,

1385
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:31,618
for, I know, when thou didst
hate him worst,

1386
01:32:31,996 --> 01:32:36,796
thou lovedst him better
than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

1387
01:32:37,668 --> 01:32:39,295
Sheathe your dagger.

1388
01:32:39,704 --> 01:32:41,831
Be angry when you will,
it shall have scope.

1389
01:32:41,906 --> 01:32:44,374
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.

1390
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:47,909
Hath Cassius lived to be but mirth
and laughter to his Brutus,

1391
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,873
when grief and blood
ill-tempered vexeth him?

1392
01:32:51,015 --> 01:32:53,506
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered, too.

1393
01:32:54,252 --> 01:32:56,152
Do you confess so much?

1394
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:59,422
- Give me your hand.
- And my heart, too.

1395
01:32:59,924 --> 01:33:03,655
O Brutus, have you not love enough
to bear with me,

1396
01:33:03,861 --> 01:33:07,319
when that rash humor that my mother
gave me makes me forgetful?

1397
01:33:07,532 --> 01:33:08,760
Yes, Cassius.

1398
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,770
And from henceforth, when you are
over-earnest with your Brutus,

1399
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,398
he'll think your mother chides,
and leave you so.

1400
01:33:19,143 --> 01:33:23,409
Lucilius, bid the commanders prepare
to lodge their companies tonight.

1401
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:27,640
And come yourself, and bring Messala
with you immediately to us.

1402
01:33:29,987 --> 01:33:34,321
Lucius, a bowl of wine.

1403
01:33:40,798 --> 01:33:43,028
I did not think
you could have been so angry.

1404
01:33:45,169 --> 01:33:49,538
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

1405
01:33:50,008 --> 01:33:54,502
Of your philosophy you make no use,
if you give place to accidental evils.

1406
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,079
No man bears sorrow better.

1407
01:33:59,783 --> 01:34:01,307
Portia is dead.

1408
01:34:04,388 --> 01:34:05,787
Portia?

1409
01:34:08,091 --> 01:34:09,490
She is dead.

1410
01:34:11,095 --> 01:34:13,859
How escaped I killing
when I crossed you so?

1411
01:34:14,332 --> 01:34:16,767
O, insupportable and touching loss!

1412
01:34:18,537 --> 01:34:20,266
Upon what sickness?

1413
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:25,403
Impatient of my absence,
and grief that young Octavius

1414
01:34:25,476 --> 01:34:27,944
with Mark Antony
have made themselves so strong,

1415
01:34:28,713 --> 01:34:31,079
for with her death that tidings came.

1416
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,850
With this she fell distract,

1417
01:34:34,552 --> 01:34:38,283
and, her attendants absent,
swallowed fire.

1418
01:34:39,123 --> 01:34:40,522
And died so?

1419
01:34:41,526 --> 01:34:42,754
Even so.

1420
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,225
O ye immortal gods.

1421
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,062
Speak no more of her.

1422
01:35:09,487 --> 01:35:12,513
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

1423
01:35:12,989 --> 01:35:15,787
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.

1424
01:35:23,701 --> 01:35:25,134
Come in, Lucilius.

1425
01:35:25,203 --> 01:35:26,465
Welcome, good Messala.

1426
01:35:26,537 --> 01:35:30,769
Now, sit we close about this taper here,
and call in question our necessities.

1427
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:35,575
- Portia, art thou gone?
- No more, I pray you.

1428
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:38,742
Messala, I have here received letters

1429
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:42,376
that young Octavius and Mark Antony
come down upon us with a mighty power,

1430
01:35:42,452 --> 01:35:44,818
bending their expedition toward Philippi.

1431
01:35:44,888 --> 01:35:47,152
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.

1432
01:35:47,224 --> 01:35:48,555
With what addition?

1433
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,616
That by prescription and bills of outlawry,

1434
01:35:50,694 --> 01:35:53,960
Octavius, Antony and Lepidus
have put to death 100 senators.

1435
01:35:54,031 --> 01:35:55,123
Therein our letters do not well agree.

1436
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,964
Mine speak of 70 senators
that died by their prescriptions,

1437
01:35:58,036 --> 01:35:59,367
Cicero being one.

1438
01:35:59,538 --> 01:36:02,098
- Cicero?
- Cicero is dead,

1439
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,471
and by that order of prescription.

1440
01:36:07,412 --> 01:36:10,142
Had you your letters
from your wife, my lord?

1441
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:13,016
No, Messala.

1442
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,550
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

1443
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,247
Nothing, Messala.

1444
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,947
Well, to our work alive.

1445
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,321
What do you think of marching
to Philippi presently?

1446
01:36:21,392 --> 01:36:23,917
- I do not think it good.
- Your reason?

1447
01:36:24,595 --> 01:36:27,723
This it is. 'Tis better
that the enemy seek us.

1448
01:36:28,132 --> 01:36:31,498
So shall he waste his means,
weary his soldiers, doing himself offense,

1449
01:36:31,568 --> 01:36:34,936
whilst we, lying still, are full of rest,
defense, and nimbleness.

1450
01:36:35,006 --> 01:36:37,531
Good reasons must, of force,
give place to better.

1451
01:36:37,608 --> 01:36:39,542
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground

1452
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,077
do stand but in a forced affection.

1453
01:36:41,145 --> 01:36:42,669
Hear me, good brother.

1454
01:36:42,747 --> 01:36:44,408
Under your pardon.

1455
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:50,446
You must note, beside, that we have
tried the utmost of our friends.

1456
01:36:50,521 --> 01:36:53,354
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.

1457
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:57,960
The enemy increaseth every day.
We, at the height, are ready to decline.

1458
01:36:58,195 --> 01:37:00,663
There is a tide in the affairs of men,

1459
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:03,460
which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune.

1460
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:08,028
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries.

1461
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:11,098
On such a full sea are we now afloat,

1462
01:37:11,175 --> 01:37:14,770
and we must take the current
when it serves, or lose our ventures.

1463
01:37:15,346 --> 01:37:17,439
Then, with your will, go on.

1464
01:37:18,549 --> 01:37:21,575
We'll along ourselves,
and meet them at Philippi.

1465
01:37:21,886 --> 01:37:23,853
There is no more to say?

1466
01:37:24,287 --> 01:37:25,515
No more.

1467
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:27,950
Good night.

1468
01:37:28,024 --> 01:37:30,493
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

1469
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:33,822
Lucius, my gown!

1470
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,791
- Good night, Lucilius.
- Good night, my lord.

1471
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:40,528
Farewell, good Messala.

1472
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:42,574
Good night, Lord Brutus.

1473
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:47,609
Noble, noble Cassius,
good night, and good repose.

1474
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:48,771
O my dear brother.

1475
01:37:48,847 --> 01:37:51,212
This was an ill beginning to the night.

1476
01:37:51,682 --> 01:37:54,150
Never come such division 'twixt our souls.

1477
01:37:54,819 --> 01:37:56,116
Let it not, Brutus.

1478
01:37:56,187 --> 01:37:57,916
Everything is well.

1479
01:37:58,523 --> 01:38:00,286
Good night, my lord.

1480
01:38:00,525 --> 01:38:02,516
Good night, good brother.

1481
01:38:18,776 --> 01:38:22,542
- Where is thy instrument?
- Here in the tent, sir.

1482
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:24,974
What, thou speak'st drowsily?

1483
01:38:25,049 --> 01:38:27,950
Poor knave, I blame thee not.
Thou art over-watched.

1484
01:38:28,686 --> 01:38:30,381
Call Claudius and some other of my men.

1485
01:38:30,454 --> 01:38:32,979
I'll have them sleep on cushions
by my tent.

1486
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,289
Varro and Claudius.

1487
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:42,127
Look, Lucius,
here's the book I sought for so.

1488
01:38:42,299 --> 01:38:44,426
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

1489
01:38:44,534 --> 01:38:46,399
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

1490
01:38:46,469 --> 01:38:49,165
Bear with me, good boy,
I am much forgetful.

1491
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:51,334
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,

1492
01:38:51,408 --> 01:38:53,138
and touch thy instrument
a strain or two?

1493
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,768
Ay, my lord, an't please you.

1494
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:58,076
It does, my boy. I trouble thee too much,
but thou art willing.

1495
01:38:58,149 --> 01:38:59,616
'Tis my duty, sir.

1496
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,743
I should not urge thy duty past thy might.

1497
01:39:01,819 --> 01:39:03,912
I know young bloods
look for a time of rest.

1498
01:39:03,988 --> 01:39:05,889
I have slept, my lord, already.

1499
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:08,187
It was well done,
and thou shalt sleep again.

1500
01:39:08,259 --> 01:39:09,988
I will not hold thee long.

1501
01:39:10,761 --> 01:39:14,219
If I do live, I will be good to thee.

1502
01:39:26,444 --> 01:39:29,710
<i>Now, O now</i>

1503
01:39:29,781 --> 01:39:34,274
<i>I needs must part</i>

1504
01:39:34,986 --> 01:39:39,855
<i>Joy once fled cannot return</i>

1505
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:46,291
<i>If that parting</i>

1506
01:39:46,364 --> 01:39:50,664
<i>be offense</i>

1507
01:39:51,435 --> 01:39:54,598
<i>It is she</i>

1508
01:39:54,939 --> 01:39:57,464
This is a sleepy tune.

1509
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,608
<i>Which thus offends</i>

1510
01:40:09,987 --> 01:40:11,978
O murderous slumber,

1511
01:40:12,123 --> 01:40:16,025
lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
that plays thee music?

1512
01:40:17,662 --> 01:40:22,656
Gentle knave, good night. I will not
do thee so much wrong to wake thee.

1513
01:40:37,981 --> 01:40:41,418
And, good boy, good night.

1514
01:40:44,022 --> 01:40:48,982
Let me see, let me see. Is not the leaf
turned down where I left reading?

1515
01:40:50,829 --> 01:40:52,591
Here it is, I think.

1516
01:41:27,031 --> 01:41:29,226
How ill this taper burns.

1517
01:41:39,143 --> 01:41:40,667
Who comes here?

1518
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:48,376
I think it is the weakness of my eyes
that shapes this monstrous apparition.

1519
01:41:53,824 --> 01:41:55,485
Art thou anything?

1520
01:41:56,660 --> 01:42:00,790
Art thou some god, some angel,
or some devil,

1521
01:42:01,232 --> 01:42:04,998
that mak'st my blood cold
and my hair to stare?

1522
01:42:06,403 --> 01:42:08,428
Speak to me what thou art!

1523
01:42:08,906 --> 01:42:11,066
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

1524
01:42:12,475 --> 01:42:14,375
Why com'st thou?

1525
01:42:14,778 --> 01:42:19,773
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

1526
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:24,520
Well, then I shall see thee again.

1527
01:42:25,257 --> 01:42:28,818
Ay, at Philippi.

1528
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:30,926
Why,

1529
01:42:33,131 --> 01:42:35,190
I will see thee at Philippi, then!

1530
01:42:39,103 --> 01:42:41,367
Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.

1531
01:42:44,208 --> 01:42:47,143
III spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.

1532
01:42:51,282 --> 01:42:54,649
Boy, Lucius! Lucius, awake!

1533
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,143
My lord?

1534
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,120
Didst thou dream, Lucius,
that thou so criedst out?

1535
01:42:58,189 --> 01:42:59,851
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

1536
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:01,517
Yes, that thou didst.
Didst thou see anything?

1537
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,219
Nothing, my lord.

1538
01:43:03,994 --> 01:43:05,928
Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake!

1539
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:07,788
- My lord.
- My lord.

1540
01:43:07,865 --> 01:43:10,095
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

1541
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:11,225
Did we, my lord?

1542
01:43:11,302 --> 01:43:12,633
Ay. Saw you anything?

1543
01:43:12,703 --> 01:43:15,263
- No, my lord, I saw nothing.
- Nor I, my lord.

1544
01:43:17,174 --> 01:43:19,574
Go and commend me
to my brother Cassius.

1545
01:43:19,677 --> 01:43:23,044
Bid him set on his powers
betimes before, and we will follow.

1546
01:43:23,214 --> 01:43:25,239
It shall be done, my lord.

1547
01:43:58,249 --> 01:44:01,582
Now, most noble Brutus,
the gods today stand friendly,

1548
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:04,813
that we may, lovers in peace,
lead on our days to age.

1549
01:44:06,223 --> 01:44:09,090
But, since the affairs of men
rest still uncertain,

1550
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:11,452
let's reason with the worst
that may befall.

1551
01:44:11,529 --> 01:44:13,929
If we do lose this battle,
then is this the very last time

1552
01:44:14,032 --> 01:44:15,260
we shall speak together.

1553
01:44:15,867 --> 01:44:18,097
What are you, then, determined to do?

1554
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:21,805
Think not, thou noble Roman,
that ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.

1555
01:44:21,872 --> 01:44:23,897
He bears too great a mind.

1556
01:44:24,074 --> 01:44:27,407
But this same day must end that work
the ides of March begun.

1557
01:44:27,811 --> 01:44:30,541
And whether we shall meet again
I know not.

1558
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,377
Therefore, our everlasting farewell take.

1559
01:44:35,085 --> 01:44:37,451
Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius.

1560
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:41,188
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.

1561
01:44:41,725 --> 01:44:44,523
If not, why then,
this parting was well made.

1562
01:44:45,297 --> 01:44:47,890
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.

1563
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:50,666
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed.

1564
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:54,428
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

1565
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,669
Why, then, lead on.

1566
01:44:59,109 --> 01:45:02,772
O, that a man might know the end
of this day's business ere it come.

1567
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:07,541
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
and then the end is known.

1568
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,151
- Messala.
- What says my general?

1569
01:45:19,696 --> 01:45:23,758
Messala, this is my birthday.
As this very day was Cassius born.

1570
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:27,100
Give me thy hand, Messala.

1571
01:45:27,338 --> 01:45:30,967
Be thou my witness that against my will,
as Pompey was,

1572
01:45:31,275 --> 01:45:34,803
I am compelled to set upon one battle
all our liberties.

1573
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:36,346
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off!

1574
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,388
This hill is far enough.

1575
01:49:45,862 --> 01:49:47,659
Look, look, Titinius.

1576
01:49:47,864 --> 01:49:50,799
Are those my tents
where I perceive our light?

1577
01:49:51,735 --> 01:49:53,396
They are, my lord.

1578
01:49:54,037 --> 01:49:56,130
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
mount thou my horse

1579
01:49:56,206 --> 01:49:57,571
and hide thy spurs in him,

1580
01:49:57,641 --> 01:50:00,337
till he have brought thee up
to yonder troops and here again,

1581
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:03,038
that I may rest assured
whether those troops be friend or enemy.

1582
01:50:03,113 --> 01:50:05,911
I will be here again, even with a thought.

1583
01:50:11,989 --> 01:50:14,287
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.

1584
01:50:14,424 --> 01:50:15,982
My sight was ever thick.

1585
01:50:16,059 --> 01:50:19,893
Regard Titinius, and tell me
what thou notest about the field.

1586
01:50:31,608 --> 01:50:33,439
This day I breathed first.

1587
01:50:34,278 --> 01:50:35,905
Time is come round,

1588
01:50:36,046 --> 01:50:39,244
and where I did begin, there shall I end.

1589
01:50:39,951 --> 01:50:41,509
My life is run its compass.

1590
01:50:41,586 --> 01:50:43,952
- My lord!
- Sirrah, what news?

1591
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:46,186
O, my lord!

1592
01:50:46,291 --> 01:50:50,318
Titinius is enclosed at round about with
horsemen that make to him on the spur.

1593
01:50:50,395 --> 01:50:51,987
Yet he spurs on.

1594
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:54,221
Now they are almost on him.

1595
01:50:54,298 --> 01:50:56,425
Now, Titinius! Now! Now!

1596
01:51:01,204 --> 01:51:02,569
He's taken.

1597
01:51:06,276 --> 01:51:09,302
Come down. Behold no more.

1598
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:19,685
O, coward that I am, to live so long

1599
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:23,920
to see my best friend taken
before my face.

1600
01:51:29,833 --> 01:51:31,357
Come hither, sirrah.

1601
01:51:34,504 --> 01:51:36,699
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,

1602
01:51:36,973 --> 01:51:39,464
and then I swore thee, saving of thy life,

1603
01:51:39,609 --> 01:51:42,772
that whatsoever I did bid thee do,
thou shouldst attempt it.

1604
01:51:42,846 --> 01:51:44,575
Come now, keep thine oath.

1605
01:51:45,015 --> 01:51:46,481
Now be a freeman,

1606
01:51:49,252 --> 01:51:52,483
and with this good sword,
that ran through Caesar's bowels,

1607
01:51:53,056 --> 01:51:54,489
search this bosom.

1608
01:51:54,825 --> 01:51:57,293
Stand not to answer. Take thou the hilts.

1609
01:51:57,928 --> 01:51:59,521
Guide thou the sword.

1610
01:52:08,339 --> 01:52:10,364
Come now, keep thine oath!

1611
01:53:26,983 --> 01:53:28,143
Where is he?

1612
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,277
Safe, Octavius. Brutus is safe enough.

1613
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:36,125
I dare assure thee that no enemy
shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.

1614
01:53:53,344 --> 01:53:57,177
Yet, countrymen,
O yet hold up your heads!

1615
01:54:00,851 --> 01:54:04,810
Come, poor remains of friends,
rest on this rock.

1616
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:40,586
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet.

1617
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:46,063
Thy spirit walks abroad
and turns our swords

1618
01:54:47,732 --> 01:54:51,189
in our own proper entrails.

1619
01:55:02,712 --> 01:55:04,373
Hark thee, Clitus.

1620
01:55:09,819 --> 01:55:11,514
What, I, my lord?

1621
01:55:11,856 --> 01:55:13,881
No, not for all the world.

1622
01:55:14,224 --> 01:55:17,660
- Peace, then. No words.
- I'd rather kill myself.

1623
01:55:20,064 --> 01:55:23,864
Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word.

1624
01:55:29,907 --> 01:55:31,465
What says my lord?

1625
01:55:31,576 --> 01:55:35,774
Why this, Volumnius.
The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me

1626
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,609
two several times by night,

1627
01:55:37,682 --> 01:55:40,980
at Sardis once, and this last night
here in Philippi fields.

1628
01:55:41,051 --> 01:55:42,643
I know my hour is come.

1629
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:43,743
Not so, my lord.

1630
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:46,948
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.

1631
01:55:48,258 --> 01:55:50,783
Thou seest the world, Volumnius,
how it goes.

1632
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:53,192
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.

1633
01:55:53,763 --> 01:55:58,531
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
than tarry till they push us.

1634
01:55:59,403 --> 01:56:03,601
Good Volumnius, thou know'st
that we two went to school together.

1635
01:56:04,175 --> 01:56:08,304
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
hold thou my sword-hilts,

1636
01:56:08,411 --> 01:56:10,140
whilst I run on it.

1637
01:56:11,514 --> 01:56:14,347
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

1638
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:26,161
Fly, fly, my lord. There is no tarrying here!

1639
01:56:28,331 --> 01:56:33,325
Farewell to you, and you,
and you, Volumnius.

1640
01:56:34,871 --> 01:56:37,931
Countrymen, my heart doth joy
that yet, in all my life,

1641
01:56:38,008 --> 01:56:40,476
I found no man but he was true to me.

1642
01:56:41,645 --> 01:56:45,376
I shall have glory by this losing day,
more than Octavius and Mark Antony

1643
01:56:45,448 --> 01:56:48,144
by this vile conquest shall attain unto.

1644
01:56:48,786 --> 01:56:50,515
So, fare you well at once,

1645
01:56:51,122 --> 01:56:54,319
for Brutus' tongue hath almost ended
his life's history.

1646
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:59,351
Night hangs upon mine eyes.
My bones would rest,

1647
01:57:00,363 --> 01:57:03,196
that have but labored to attain this hour.

1648
01:57:25,955 --> 01:57:30,016
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy Lord.

1649
01:57:33,563 --> 01:57:35,360
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.

1650
01:57:35,432 --> 01:57:37,900
Thy life hath had
some smatch of honor in it.

1651
01:57:41,138 --> 01:57:43,436
Hold then my sword,
and turn away thy face,

1652
01:57:43,507 --> 01:57:45,338
while I do run upon it.

1653
01:57:45,743 --> 01:57:47,404
Wilt thou, Strato?

1654
01:57:52,215 --> 01:57:54,183
Give me your hand first.

1655
01:57:57,387 --> 01:57:59,287
Fare you well, my lord.

1656
01:58:00,223 --> 01:58:02,088
Farewell, good Strato.

1657
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:24,203
Caesar, now be still.

1658
01:58:24,748 --> 01:58:27,912
I killed not thee with half so good a will.

1659
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:23,097
According to his virtue,
let us use him

1660
01:59:23,173 --> 01:59:25,801
with all respect and rites of burial.

1661
01:59:26,544 --> 01:59:30,071
Within my tent his bones tonight
shall lie, most like a soldier,

1662
01:59:30,247 --> 01:59:32,374
ordered honorably.

1663
01:59:34,251 --> 01:59:37,219
This was the noblest Roman of them all.

1664
01:59:41,224 --> 01:59:45,456
All the conspirators, save only he,
did that they did in envy of great Caesar.

1665
01:59:46,729 --> 01:59:49,323
He only, in a general honest thought

1666
01:59:49,399 --> 01:59:51,833
and common good to all,
made one of them.

1667
01:59:52,836 --> 01:59:54,531
His life was gentle,

1668
01:59:55,305 --> 01:59:56,829
and the elements so mixed in him

1669
01:59:56,906 --> 01:59:59,807
that Nature might stand up
and say to all the world,

1670
02:00:01,446 --> 02:00:03,413
"This was a man."
