1
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:14,591
In the sky the bright stars glittered

2
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,761
On the bank the pale moon shone

3
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,055
Somebody's coming, Pa.

4
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,644
Well, let him come.

5
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:34,896
I was seeing Nellie home

6
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,043
It was from Aunt Dinah's

7
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,507
I was seeing

8
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,562
Hope you don't mind
my cutting through your place.

9
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,358
- No, I guess not.
- I'm heading north.

10
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,739
Didn't expect to find
any fences around here.

11
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,118
Hello, boy.

12
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,749
- You were watching me, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

13
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:34,296
I like a man who watches things
going around.

14
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,048
It means he'll make his mark some day.

15
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,848
Long time since I've seen a Jersey cow.

16
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:49,311
You'll see a lot more.
Jerseys and Holsteins...

17
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,856
and the like.

18
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,818
- Can I offer you some water?
- Thanks.

19
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,086
You're a little touchy, aren't you?

20
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,879
Joey.

21
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,803
- You know not to point guns at people.
- I wasn't pointing at anybody, Mother.

22
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,978
Sure had me snorting, son.

23
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,858
I just wanted you to see my rifle.

24
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,904
Bet you can shoot.

25
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,451
- Can't you?
- Little bit.

26
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,423
Looks like your friends are a little late.

27
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,677
What are the Ryker boys up to this time?

28
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,221
- Rykers?
- That's what I said.

29
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,891
I wouldn't know a Ryker
from your Jersey cow.

30
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,646
Don't forget to close the gate
on your way out.

31
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,191
Would you put down that gun?
Then I'll leave.

32
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,987
What's the difference?
You're leaving anyway.

33
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,781
I'd like it to be my idea.

34
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,193
Howdy, Starrett.

35
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,782
Expecting trouble?

36
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:12,329
I don't want no trouble, Starrett.
I came to inform you.

37
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,374
I got that reservation beef contract.

38
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,794
- So many to tell me that?
- I mean business.

39
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,964
- Then, tend to your own.
- That's just what I'm doing.

40
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,801
I'm gonna need all my range.

41
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,637
Now that you've warned me,
get off my place.

42
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,931
Your place?

43
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,726
You'll have to get out before the snow.

44
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,313
- Supposing I don't?
- You and the other squatters.

45
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,234
- Homesteaders, you mean.
- I could blast you out of here right now.

46
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,902
You and the others.

47
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,658
Listen to me. The time for gun-blasting
a man off his place is passed.

48
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,787
- They're building a penitentiary to take care of...
- Joe, that's enough.

49
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,503
Who are you, stranger?

50
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,549
I'm a friend of Starrett's.

51
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,679
Well, Starrett, you can't say
I didn't warn you.

52
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,808
All right, you've told me.
Now get off my claim.

53
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:39,791
Supper'll be ready in a little while, Joe.
Won't be very long.

54
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,043
Wait, mister, I...

55
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,007
I swear, I... Wait a minute, please.

56
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,052
I take that back, what I...

57
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,348
Look, this thing ain't even loaded.

58
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,561
- Not loaded?
- No, no, Joey's too young to go loaded.

59
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,022
That's his gun.

60
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,359
If this don't beat all.

61
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,324
My name is Starrett, Joe Starrett,
and this here's Joey.

62
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,662
You heard what my little woman said.
Come on in, I feel like eating.

63
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,877
- You can call me Shane.
- Guess I spook kind of easy these days.

64
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,046
Hello, Joe.

65
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:34,304
My place ain't very much yet,
but my wife sure can cook.

66
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:40,519
It won't be long till supper.
You can wash up right here.

67
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:48,151
In case you wanted to know,
that's Ryker's spread all over there.

68
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,863
He thinks the whole world
belongs to him.

69
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,241
The old-timers can't see it yet...

70
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,369
but running cattle
on an open range can't go on.

71
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,664
It takes too much space
for too little results.

72
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,751
Those herds aren't any good,
they're all horns and bone.

73
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,632
Cattle that is bred for meat and fenced in
and fed right, that's the thing.

74
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,845
You gotta pick your spot,
get your land, your own land.

75
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:20,267
A homesteader can't run but a few beef,
but he can grow grain...

76
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:26,106
and then with his garden
and hogs and milk, he'll be all right.

77
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:31,152
We make out, don't we, Marian?

78
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,779
Of course.

79
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,707
It's that calf again.
Joey, chase her out of there.

80
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,129
Joey. Run on, son.

81
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,218
Don't forget to shut that gate.

82
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,139
Joey.

83
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,269
Come on, shoo!

84
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,983
I wouldn't ask you where you're bound.

85
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:16,156
One place or another.
Some place I've never been.

86
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:26,583
- The only way I'll leave is in a pine box.
- What do you mean, Pa?

87
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,630
I mean they'll have to shoot me
and carry me out.

88
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,175
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- It's the truth.

89
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,470
You love this place.
We've got our roots down.

90
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,599
- I wish you wouldn't talk that way.
- Our first real home.

91
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,437
- What did you mean?
- Joey, be quiet. The men want to talk.

92
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:52,233
There's just more work here
than I can do.

93
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,154
If I could hire me a man that...

94
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,741
I had one once,
but the Rykers roughed him up...

95
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,452
so he lit out, cussing me.

96
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,121
They knocked his teeth out.

97
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,749
Ready for pie?

98
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:14,130
If nobody else is gonna eat this biscuit,
I guess I'll have to.

99
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,897
- We're kind of fancy, aren't we?
- What is, Pa?

100
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,233
Good plates, an extra fork.

101
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,361
What about me, Ma?

102
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,698
- What's the matter, Marian?
- Nothing.

103
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,091
That was an elegant dinner, Mrs. Starrett.

104
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,845
Excuse me.

105
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,811
Where's Mr. Shane going?
He didn't even say goodbye.

106
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,691
He's not going, Joey.
He wouldn't go without taking that.

107
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,902
I'm going outside with him.

108
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,615
- Did you ask him to stay the night?
- I'll do that right now.

109
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,207
Well, I'll be doggone.
Come here a minute.

110
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,679
Joe, why don't you hitch up the team?

111
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:32,310
Marian, I've been fighting
this stump off and on for two years.

112
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,605
Use the team now,
this stump could say it beat us.

113
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:41,402
Sometimes nothing will do
but your own sweat and muscle.

114
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,114
All right.

115
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,796
Bang! Bang!

116
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:30,011
I wish they'd give me
some bullets for this gun.

117
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,021
- Good morning, Joey.
- How did you know it was me?

118
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,317
Well, I figured the cow couldn't work
that latch.

119
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,157
- Why are you up so early?
- You're to stay for breakfast.

120
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,077
Well, thank you.

121
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,207
- Then where will you go?
- Where would you say, Joey?

122
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,292
I...

123
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,338
I wish you'd stay here.

124
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:10,343
- Would you teach me to shoot?
- You'd like to learn to shoot?

125
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,639
Pa wishes you'd stay too.
I heard him tell Mother.

126
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,560
He said he didn't want you
to fight his fights for him...

127
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,563
just help with the work.

128
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,484
I bet you wouldn't leave
just because it's dangerous.

129
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,362
Joey. Joey.

130
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,156
Joey, come here this minute.

131
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:37,036
I hope you'll stay, Mr. Shane.
Coming, Mother.

132
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,163
Close the gate, Joey.

133
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:44,711
What are you doing in your nightshirt?
Come in and put your clothes on.

134
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:50,049
Would you like to hitch up the team
and haul that wire from Grafton's?

135
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:54,053
- Anything you say.
- Get off the bed. Go on.

136
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,223
He's holding it for me at the store.

137
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:02,979
While you're there, you might as well
get yourself some work clothes.

138
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,690
- What can I bring Joey?
- Soda-pop.

139
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,192
You don't need anything, Joey.

140
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,739
Be careful. I don't want my troubles
to be none of yours.

141
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,408
Aren't you wearing your six-shooter?

142
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,412
I didn't know there was
any wild game in town, Joey.

143
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,039
Come on, son.

144
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,887
Joey, come back here.

145
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,641
Bang!

146
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,435
Bang!

147
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:47,023
- Who are you shooting at?
- Rykers. Bang! Bang!

148
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,859
- Did you get many?
- Missed one.

149
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,779
Well, can't stand for that.

150
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,783
Pa, do you guess
Shane will teach me to shoot?

151
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,162
I'll teach you myself
once I get the time, Joey.

152
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,127
- Can you shoot as good as Shane?
- I've never seen him shoot.

153
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,254
But I doubt it.

154
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,966
He didn't wear his gun today.
Why's that, Pa?

155
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:20,098
Well, he's trading at the store,
not holding it up.

156
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,268
But why, Pa? Honest, why didn't he?

157
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,482
- I don't wear one myself.
- It goes with him, though.

158
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,320
- Somebody's coming, Joe.
- I know. It's Ernie Wright.

159
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,287
Could you whip him, Pa?
Could you whip Shane?

160
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,457
- Can't you ask nothing but questions?
- But could you?

161
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,419
Oh, maybe.

162
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:55,299
No call for that though, Joey.
Shane's on our side.

163
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,802
Howdy, Joe.

164
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,804
How are you, Ernie?

165
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,598
- No good.
- What's the matter?

166
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,852
I'm pulling stakes.
No use of your talking.

167
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:11,649
- Now what's the matter?
- My wheat. Them Rykers raided it.

168
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:16,154
Fence cut, steers drove in.
It's just stubs now.

169
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,197
- When?
- Last night.

170
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,034
I'm leaving, and don't try
to talk me out of it.

171
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,621
- You can't.
- Just don't try, that's all.

172
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,589
- I listened to you too much already.
- Go ahead, nobody's holding you.

173
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:34,380
Oh, Ernie. You wouldn't leave
your home and land, and...

174
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,799
Oh, Ernie, you...

175
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:42,054
I'm wore down and out.
Tired of being insulted by them fellas.

176
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:46,017
Called a pig-farmer.
Who knows what comes next?

177
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,061
Well, don't throw your tail up.

178
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:55,318
Tell you what, we'll all get together here
tonight and figure out something.

179
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,111
I don't know about me.

180
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,490
I'll get the word around.
You tell Shipstead and Torrey.

181
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,245
All right,
but if we're having a meeting...

182
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:11,000
it'd better be more than poking holes
in the air with your finger.

183
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:46,410
- Anything I can do you for?
- I came to get wire for Joe Starrett.

184
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,456
I've been holding wire
for Starrett for quite a spell.

185
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:55,461
- Are you new?
- Yes, I'm working for Starrett.

186
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,130
- Got ready-made pants to fit me?
- Farm rig?

187
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,718
I outfit all these farmers.

188
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,644
- Step right in back and try them on.
- Thanks.

189
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,983
Will.

190
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,073
Hey, Will.

191
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,164
You're thirsty, ain't you, Chris?

192
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:40,006
- Will. Who's tending bar around here?
- Coming right in.

193
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,642
- How is it?
- Good enough.

194
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,022
- How much do I owe you?
- Now, let's see.

195
00:21:56,189 --> 00:22:00,818
Pants, a dollar. Two shirts, 60 cents.

196
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,655
Belt.

197
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:13,873
Young man, you owe me
two dollars and two bits.

198
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,543
What's the matter, son?
You look kind of pale.

199
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,297
Been a long time since
I got store-bought clothes.

200
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,216
Money don't go very far these days.

201
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,720
A new sodbuster?

202
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,724
Thought I smelled pigs.

203
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,061
- Anything else?
- Got any soda-pop?

204
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:40,733
I sure do. I wish more men
around here would drink it.

205
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,028
- In my bar, in there.
- Thanks.

206
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:04,423
Will. Let's keep the smell of pigs
out from where we're drinking.

207
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,558
- Bartender.
- What can I do for you?

208
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,935
Do you have any soda-pop?

209
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:24,360
Are you gonna get him out
or do I have to?

210
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,408
Let me take him, Chris.

211
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,790
What'll it be?

212
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,128
Lemon, strawberry or lilac, sodbuster?

213
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,300
You speaking to me?

214
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,012
I don't see
nobody else standing there.

215
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,395
Here, have some of this.

216
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,148
Smell like a man.

217
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:07,570
Don't it smell better in here, Grafton?
Chris just fumigated a sodbuster.

218
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,822
Just take it easy.

219
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,285
I was just asking about sody-pop...

220
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,747
pigs and taters
and one thing and another.

221
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:23,419
Which one of them tater-pickers
are you working for?

222
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,047
Or are you just
squatting on the range?

223
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,010
Joe Starrett, if it's any of your business.

224
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,472
Supposing I make it my business?

225
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,480
Here's your soda-pop, mister.

226
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:54,200
Now you and your soda-pop
get out of here and stay out of here.

227
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,670
And don't come back.

228
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,509
- Did you see that, Rufe?
- What, Bubba?

229
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,969
Chris just put the run on a sodbuster.

230
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,598
That's it. Keep them on the move.

231
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,396
Warm it up for you?

232
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,526
It's getting so I don't like
to ride at night.

233
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,903
Let's hope the meeting starts.

234
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:36,408
- Ls Shane going to be at the meeting?
- Mr. Shane. Yes, I suppose so.

235
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,119
We all know why we're here.

236
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:43,040
Ryker's war party's
been around to see all of us.

237
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:49,505
I'm here to tell you,
I ain't leaving now or any other time.

238
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,758
Start with you, Axel. What do you say?

239
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,886
Well, Joe, you see...

240
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,139
I know what I want to say.
Start with me.

241
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:04,144
Ernie, we're gonna hear
everybody in turn. Go ahead.

242
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,022
Most of you don't know Shane.

243
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,733
- Shane, this is Yank Potts.
- Howdy.

244
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,445
- Fred Lewis here.
- Yeah. I seen you in town.

245
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,116
- Ernie Wright here, and Ed Howells.
- Howdy, Shane.

246
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,244
- And Johnson.
- Howdy, Shane.

247
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,580
- See anybody else coming?
- No.

248
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:27,376
- We're waiting for Torrey.
- How far is Ryker gonna push us?

249
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,588
Let's not talk scared,
that's what Ryker wants.

250
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,717
He thinks he can shoo us off
like a flock of chickens.

251
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,635
Here's Torrey.

252
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,430
- Hello, Reb.
- Hello, Yank.

253
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,806
About time you showed up.

254
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,397
That's enough out of you, Yank.

255
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,820
- And you too.
- All right. Cool off, Stonewall.

256
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,782
Shake hands with Shane, there.
Shane's working for me.

257
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,077
Shane. Oh, yeah.

258
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,497
I heard about you, at Grafton's.

259
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,500
Go on, Joe.

260
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,840
Well, Stonewall, it's like this...
Leaving Ernie out, maybe...

261
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,343
we've all agreed we're gonna stick.

262
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,764
Now you're whistling.
Ain't nobody pushing me off my claim.

263
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,518
- I think you all know that I'm staying.
- I too will stay.

264
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,522
I'll string along,
leastways till the shooting starts.

265
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,943
There ain't but seven of us,
if it comes to a fight.

266
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,862
Him. That's eight.

267
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,368
- Can't count on him.
- He's proved that much.

268
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,411
Watch what you're saying.

269
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,540
Shane can tell you what happened
with Ryker's man, Chris.

270
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,085
They're talking about Shane.

271
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,296
What is this, Shane?

272
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,716
Let him say.

273
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:04,556
- Lewis seen and heard it.
- He let Chris buffalo him at Grafton's.

274
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,186
Fred, I told Shane
to stay away from trouble. He did right.

275
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:14,441
- Let's finish the story.
- He didn't. Shane didn't let him do that.

276
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:21,073
This Chris went around bragging
he put the run on a sodbuster.

277
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,663
Shane, you don't have to leave.

278
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,376
I figured you could talk freer
if I weren't around.

279
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,422
It's too late to finish this now.

280
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:41,343
- He didn't, did he?
- Joey, I want you to go to sleep.

281
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,597
- It's all right, everything's all right.
- Shane isn't going away, is he?

282
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,184
No, he isn't. Now, get back into bed.

283
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,604
Stay there.

284
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,986
- Shane.
- Shane.

285
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:05,451
- I know you ain't afraid.
- It's a long story, Joey.

286
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,247
I think we know...

287
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,666
Shane.

288
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:21,341
Don't stand in the rain.
You'll catch your death of cold.

289
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:32,478
So, on Saturday, we'll get together
and go into town for our supplies.

290
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,857
That's a good idea.
There's some strength in a whole bunch.

291
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,861
I don't need no bodyguard.
I'll put on my.38 and go when I please.

292
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,124
- Joey.
- Yes?

293
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,878
Don't get to liking Shane too much.

294
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,756
Why not?

295
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,177
I don't want you to.

296
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,642
- Is there anything wrong with him?
- No.

297
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,772
- Then what, Mother?
- He'll be moving on one day, Joey.

298
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,277
You'll be upset,
if you get to liking him too much.

299
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:31,036
- Marian, you're pretty enough, come on.
- I'm coming.

300
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:36,500
I wish she'd hurry so we could get going.
I don't like this business.

301
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,462
Get in the wagon, son.

302
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,727
One thing a married man
has to get used to is waiting for women.

303
00:30:55,937 --> 00:31:00,023
- Hurry up, Ma!
- Here she comes.

304
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,817
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

305
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,737
Sometimes the waiting is worth it.

306
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,949
Take care and get a woman
worth waiting for.

307
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,868
Water's good.

308
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,500
Think I can get ready
as quickly as you?

309
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,337
Hold your horses, we wanted
to see how pretty you were.

310
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,590
Come on here.

311
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,096
All set?

312
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,466
Come on, girls.

313
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,594
- Hello, Ernie.
- Morning.

314
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,389
- Are you all set?
- Reckon we are.

315
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,142
- Hello, Marian.
- Where's Stonewall?

316
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,105
He got thirsty and went on in.
Said he had business that couldn't wait.

317
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,275
I got to stay and mind the girls.

318
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,236
- Bye.
- Bye.

319
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,781
Come on.

320
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,117
- Come on, Red.
- Bye, Marian.

321
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:47,190
Stonewall, what are you doing?
We agreed to come together.

322
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:52,696
I had a little business to attend to.
We can't buy a drink.

323
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,075
Get down off that horse.
You're acting like a darn fool.

324
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,547
A whole bunch came in.
They brought their women to protect them.

325
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,385
- My jars come yet?
- Howdy, Starrett.

326
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,887
What can I do you for?

327
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,306
My, my, my.

328
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,643
What will they think of next?

329
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,772
Susan.

330
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,358
- Did you bring your mother's list?
- Yes, Pa.

331
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,944
Get the coal oil can from the wagon.

332
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,531
My woman want we get together
on the Fourth of July.

333
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,119
We make big celebration,
don't we, Marian?

334
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,663
Fine, that's just what we need.

335
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,292
It's Joe Starrett's anniversary,
the Fourth of July.

336
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,046
- We'll have a big party.
- Oh, Mr. Grafton...

337
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,299
Have you got gunpowder
for the fireworks?

338
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:59,930
- How about some of those jellies?
- We'll talk about that later.

339
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,183
- What do I get for the empty?
- The usual.

340
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,646
- Thank you.
- Give the bottle to Will.

341
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,275
I need some white flour, Mr. Grafton,
and four pounds of coffee.

342
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,319
Joey.

343
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,326
- Let me take it in.
- You come too, Shane.

344
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,286
Thank you.

345
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,923
Well, now lookie here what we got.

346
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:49,187
That's one of the new ones.
They call him Sody-Pop.

347
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:53,150
- Deal me out.
- What's the matter, Pete?

348
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,279
Just say I'm superstitious, that's all.

349
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,996
I guess you don't hear very well,
sodbuster.

350
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:13,086
I told you, if you want to keep healthy,
stay out of here. Now, get going.

351
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:23,138
Look, pig farmer. Get back with
the women and kids, where it's safe.

352
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,726
Don't push it, Calloway.

353
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,147
Did you hear me? I said get going.

354
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:40,280
Did you think you were gonna come
and drink with the men?

355
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,825
Set them up, bartender. Two whiskies.

356
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,495
You bought me a drink
last time I was in here.

357
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:51,208
Now I want to buy you one.

358
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,419
You ain't gonna drink that in here.

359
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,716
You guessed it.

360
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,695
Let me have him.

361
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,323
- Let him go.
- Let me have him.

362
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,825
Go get him, Chris.

363
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,833
Tear him apart.

364
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,586
Get that sodbuster.

365
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,465
- Hang one on him, Chris.
- Bust him.

366
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,968
Break his back.

367
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,470
This is bad, this is bad.

368
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,349
- I'm going in there.
- No, Stonewall, stay right here.

369
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,477
If we join in, we'll get run out.

370
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,772
- Go on.
- Go get him, Chris.

371
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,822
There ain't a marshal
within a hundred-mile ride.

372
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,366
Get after him, Chris.

373
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,912
Plow him under, Chris.

374
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,128
Beat his brains out.

375
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,890
Get him.

376
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:38,064
- Land that right, Chris.
- Knock him into that pigpen, Chris.

377
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,823
Dirty pig farmer.

378
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,209
- Stop this.
- Go on, get at it.

379
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,837
Here, men, stop this.

380
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,676
Settle it outside.

381
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:48,927
- Looks like it's all over.
- We should get out of here.

382
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,684
- Maybe you'd like to draw straws.
- Hold on, young fella.

383
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:00,480
You may have a friend
you don't know you've got.

384
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,943
- I could use a man like you.
- I'm working for Starrett.

385
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:10,365
You don't belong on the end of a shovel.
Anything to stop you drawing your time?

386
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,784
I like working for Starrett.

387
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:18,623
- Whatever he's paying, I'll double.
- It's no use.

388
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,460
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

389
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,469
- Pretty wife, Starrett's got.
- You dirty old man!

390
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,973
- People don't talk to me that way.
- I'm talking that way!

391
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,769
You had a chance. Nobody messes up
my boys and gets away with it.

392
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,564
We'll ride you out of this valley.

393
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:47,610
Gonna rough you up and ride you out
and you're gonna stay out.

394
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,159
- Shane, come on.
- Joey, get out of here.

395
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,581
But, Shane, there's too many.

396
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,419
You wouldn't want me to run away,
would you?

397
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,591
But there's too many, Shane.

398
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,931
Go on, son, please.

399
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,483
- Stop!
- I'll pay the damages.

400
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,027
- No more fighting.
- Keep out of this.

401
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,280
- This man's unarmed.
- It ain't a shooting.

402
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,116
Quit butting in.

403
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,368
I'll take him.

404
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,752
Stop it, men. Stop fighting.

405
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,061
Stop it, men.

406
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,356
Stop this!

407
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,246
Break his neck.

408
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,752
- Where's Joey?
- Pa, they're going to kill Shane.

409
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,297
- They're trying to kill him.
- Stay with your mother.

410
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,217
- Joe, don't go in.
- Shane's in there.

411
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,637
What Ryker's got coming
ain't fit for a woman to see.

412
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,056
Don't go in there, Joe.

413
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,517
Beat his brains in!

414
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,832
Stop it!

415
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,293
Stop it!

416
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:56,966
Stop it! You fools have had enough of it.
You'll all get killed.

417
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,719
Starrett, you and Shane
back on out of here.

418
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:08,686
That's making some sense, Starrett.
You've won.

419
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:15,026
- Get out of here.
- Ryker ain't paying for this damage.

420
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,945
I'm paying for what's broke.

421
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:23,743
No, by Godfrey, we're paying
for what's broke, me and Shane.

422
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:37,507
Morgan, put one of the boys
on a good horse.

423
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:43,054
He's got a long trip,
all the way to Cheyenne.

424
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,224
I'm through fooling, Grafton.

425
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:53,398
From now on, when we fight with them,
the air's gonna be full of gun smoke.

426
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,529
- I saw it all, Mother, every bit.
- It's no place for you, Joey.

427
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,906
No place for you either, Marian.

428
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:07,203
I was scared. Then Pa picked up
that man and slung him on the floor.

429
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,082
I didn't do much. It was all Shane.

430
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,168
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

431
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:19,006
You did, Joe.
It was ugly and you were both wonderful.

432
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:23,928
When that chair came down on you,
Shane, I thought you were a goner.

433
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,181
It was an easy chair, Joey.

434
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,312
I bet you two could lick anyone.

435
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,817
Well, one thing's for sure,
Ryker's gonna think twice.

436
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:43,614
- Don't talk about Ryker any more now.
- I wish we could forget him.

437
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,956
- This turpentine'll hurt.
- He wouldn't say nothing.

438
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,334
No matter how much it hurt.
Would you, Shane?

439
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,297
I'm afraid I would, Joey,
if it hurt bad enough.

440
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:04,552
- It stings like anything.
- Joey, go on to bed.

441
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,807
It does smart, I know.

442
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,643
- Ouch!
- Gosh!

443
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:17,607
- Joey, for the last time, go to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

444
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,067
Come on, son.

445
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:24,405
- Will you kiss me good night, Mother?
- All right.

446
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,576
Your head...
Your head needs a bandage.

447
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,291
It's good enough, Marian, it's fine.
Thanks very much.

448
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:42,673
- You wanna know something, Mother?
- What is it?

449
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,515
- What is it, Joey?
- Mother...

450
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:56,145
- ...I just love Shane.
- Do you?

451
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,690
I love him almost as much as I love Pa.

452
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,444
That's all right, isn't it?

453
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:08,658
- He's a fine man.
- He's so good.

454
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:13,037
Don't you like him, Mother?

455
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,707
Yes, I like him too, Joey.

456
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,377
Good night, Joey.

457
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,685
What's the matter, honey?

458
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,563
Joe...

459
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,942
hold me.

460
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:48,030
Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.

461
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:04,088
- Night, Ma.
- Good night, Joey.

462
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,009
- Night, Pa.
- Night, son.

463
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,721
Night, Shane!

464
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,739
Where's Ryker?

465
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,577
He's getting a little sleep.

466
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,414
- He sent for me.
- Sit down for a minute.

467
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,668
We're having a celebration today.

468
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,966
- Where's the coffee?
- I'll put it right on.

469
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,477
- What's going on here?
- Plenty.

470
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,231
- Going somewhere?
- Looks that way, don't it?

471
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,025
Don't let them bluff you, Ernie.

472
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,486
Bluff?

473
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:55,658
See that?
They killed my sow last night.

474
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:00,162
Kept shooting
and yelling what they'd do next.

475
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,042
Woke up the kids
and scared the missus half to death.

476
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,089
- We're gonna put a stop to that.
- I said I'd stay for one more hand.

477
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,759
Well, this is it. I had enough of Ryker.

478
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,890
Here they come again!

479
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,955
Right through my plowed ground.

480
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,377
What do you think of that,
Stonewall Torrey?

481
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:53,174
Well, Starrett and the rest of us
are gonna take the juice out of them...

482
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:56,343
one of these days.

483
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:00,014
Anyhow, I'm going to Grafton's
to get a bottle.

484
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:04,894
- Show them it's Independence Day.
- Ma, you getting ready?

485
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:10,107
- Good luck.
- Good luck for you too, Stonewall.

486
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,946
Can't see a pig in sight.

487
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,533
I don't see none,
but I sure can smell them.

488
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:33,047
They cut Mr. Wright's fence
and Mr. Shipstead's too.

489
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,382
They did?

490
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:41,180
Shane, what would you do
if you caught them cutting our fence?

491
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,558
I'd ask them
to please go around by the gate.

492
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,602
Shane.

493
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:53,818
- Come on, I'll race you to the barn.
- It's a go.

494
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,023
Why don't you ever wear
your six-shooter, Shane?

495
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:37,278
I guess I don't see
as many bad men as you do.

496
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,323
Shane.

497
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:47,872
- You want me to tell you something?
- If you want to.

498
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,042
I saw your gun in there, one day.

499
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,214
I took a look at it.

500
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:05,472
- Are you mad?
- No, I guess not.

501
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,643
But if I were you,
I'd leave a thing like this alone.

502
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:14,565
- I wrapped it up in the blanket again.
- That's a good boy.

503
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,817
Could I see it again?

504
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,573
You promised you'd show me
how to shoot.

505
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,244
Please.

506
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,371
All right, Joey. Come on.

507
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,090
Get them up.

508
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,220
We've got some learning to do.
Come on.

509
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,722
You stand right here.

510
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,517
All right, put your arms
down to your side..

511
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:55,105
Your holster's too low.
Never have your holster at arm's length.

512
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,608
Let's fix this.

513
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:03,113
You always have it here, with the grip
between the elbow and the wrist.

514
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,199
So when your hand comes up...

515
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,536
the gun clears the holster
without coming up too high, see?

516
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,957
Now you try it, real fast and straight.
That's it.

517
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:17,962
- Gosh, is that what real gunfighters do?
- No, Joey.

518
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:21,298
Most of them have tricks of their own.

519
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:24,468
One, for instance,
likes a shoulder holster.

520
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:28,973
Another one puts it
in the belt of his pants.

521
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:34,061
And some like two guns.
But one's all you need if you can use it.

522
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:39,149
After 15 paces. No good for putting
a bullet where you want it.

523
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
Which is the best way?

524
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,322
What I'm telling you is as good as any,
better than most.

525
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:50,661
- Let me see you shoot.
- What do you want me to shoot at?

526
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,164
The little white rock over there, see?

527
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,513
Gosh, almighty, that is good!

528
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:17,021
You see, Joey?
Now look. Remember.

529
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,316
When your hand comes up,
you still clear your holster.

530
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,486
- Shane.
- Hello, Mrs. Starrett.

531
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,032
- I was teaching Joey a little shooting.
- I don't want...

532
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,036
You ought to see Shane shoot.
He's teaching me.

533
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:37,708
- Yes, I know. Get ready for the party.
- Ma.

534
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,627
Guns aren't going to be my boy's life.

535
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,715
Why do you always
have to spoil everything? Bang! Bang!

536
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,719
A gun is a tool,
no better or worse than any other tool.

537
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,555
An ax, a shovel, or anything.

538
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:57,603
A gun is as good or as bad
as the man using it. Remember that.

539
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:03,067
We'd all be better off if there
wasn't a single gun in this valley...

540
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,028
including yours.

541
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,490
What's all the shooting about?

542
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:15,245
You're starting the celebrating
a little early, aren't you?

543
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:20,084
Well, look at that woman,
in her wedding dress.

544
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,920
Shane, you better hitch up that team...

545
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:28,258
because today we're really gonna
celebrate the Fourth of July.

546
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:49,571
I'm supposed to say to the squatters,
"I'm busted but you're welcome."

547
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,908
- It ain't that bad.
- That's easy for you to say.

548
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,870
I've been your friend a long time,
I'm reasonable.

549
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:02,292
- But something's got to give.
- Out here a man can go just so far.

550
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:07,297
I've gone along with the new law.
I've stayed away from gunfighting.

551
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,509
Sure, I've tried to buffalo the sodbusters.

552
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:15,013
You got to admit,
my men have kept their six-guns cased.

553
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,309
And now?

554
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:42,040
- I can guess what's on your mind.
- Keep your guesses to yourself.

555
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,920
- I like Joe Starrett.
- Fool ought to listen to reason.

556
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,632
- Your reason?
- What's the matter with you?

557
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,552
No offense, Rufe.

558
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,433
It's your own conscience eating on you.

559
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,060
Conscience.

560
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,694
Hello, Torrey.
Something I can do you for?

561
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:16,867
- A jug. It's the Fourth.
- Come in, come in.

562
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,046
Jug. And a whiskey.

563
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:49,858
Here's to you, Ryker,
for running Ernie Wright off his claim.

564
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,904
Another.

565
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,241
- Is that one of them?
- Yeah.

566
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:03,664
It's a downright dirty shame.
It's all he had and he worked hard for it.

567
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:12,881
I want to tell you something, Ryker.
He's running because he's a coward.

568
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:19,221
And here's to me, because I ain't a coward
and you ain't getting my claim.

569
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,642
They're hot-headed.

570
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,730
You'd get him to draw
without any trouble.

571
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,941
It'd be easy.

572
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,947
You can't scare me
any more than you can Joe Starrett.

573
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,705
No. It's Starrett we want.

574
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:49,960
- Three cheers for Wyoming!
- The rest of you care to join me?

575
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,338
Drink a toast to the greatest state
in the Union?

576
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,425
I'm from Wyoming.

577
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:06,727
Here's to the independence
of the sovereign state of Alabama.

578
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,734
There you are.

579
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:16,171
I'm through with all you Yanks.
Listen, you Yankees.

580
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,798
Hello, Axel.

581
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:21,468
You're late, Reb,
we took Richmond two hours ago.

582
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,180
- Everybody, come here.
- Marian.

583
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,934
You come too,
I have something important to tell you.

584
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:34,272
- Axel.
- Ja, Mama. Now...

585
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,695
you all know what today is.
It's Independence Day.

586
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,365
Except for one man here. Yes, sir.

587
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:48,662
This was the day, Joe Starrett
got himself hooked, by golly!

588
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,542
Well, no...

589
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,505
- What I'd like to say is...
- Well, say it, Joe.

590
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,760
- I'd like to say that Axel's right.
- What did he say, Joe?

591
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:10,517
I gave up my independence
10 years ago today.

592
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:14,896
But no man ever gave it up
as easy as I did, heh.

593
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:20,068
And what's more, I wouldn't trade
places with any man in this world.

594
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:26,324
- Good speech.
- Go on, Joe, give her a kiss.

595
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,369
Come here.

596
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,958
Fast falls the eventide

597
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:39,463
The darkness deepens

598
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,842
Fail and comforts flee

599
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:52,010
Help of the helpless
O, abide with me

600
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,979
Congratulations.

601
01:02:56,147 --> 01:03:00,150
Pass the word to the boys,
I got some cheer for us.

602
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,361
Many more, Joe.

603
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:06,782
We were ready to give you up,
you and Ernie.

604
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,827
Ernie's getting out today.
Packed up kit and caboodle.

605
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:14,498
- Oh, been expecting that.
- Ryker's boys bluffed him out.

606
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:18,335
- Maybe he had sense.
- What were you doing in town?

607
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,762
- Joe, I want to dance.
- Oh, Marian, they've fenced me out here.

608
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,282
Goodbye, old Paint

609
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:55,205
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

610
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,250
I'm off for Montan'

611
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,127
Goodbye, old Paint

612
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,214
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

613
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,967
Goodbye, old Paint

614
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:13,181
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

615
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,767
I'm off for Montan'

616
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,562
Goodbye, old Paint

617
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:22,274
I'm a-leaving Cheyenne

618
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:38,415
- Joe don't want you in town by yourself.
- It's just Ryker and Grafton gabbing.

619
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,250
Grafton's fair enough.

620
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:44,004
Another man was there,
likely hired by Ryker.

621
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,884
- Who was that?
- Stranger, decked out like a gunfighter.

622
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:53,263
- Did you say "guns"?
- Yeah, two guns.

623
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,266
- What did he look like?
- You'll know him when you see him.

624
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,060
Packs two guns, kind of lean.

625
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,396
He wears a black hat.

626
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,482
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No.

627
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,278
A man named Wilson looks like that,
a gunfighter.

628
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,406
- Jack Wilson?
- Gunfighter out of Cheyenne.

629
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,118
- Can't be him, can it?
- I didn't ask him his name.

630
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,997
- What about him?
- What's a gunman doing around here?

631
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:23,376
- Pow-wowing with Ryker?
- Don't start. We don't know it's Wilson.

632
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:27,839
This Wilson, would you know him, Shane?
If you saw him?

633
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:35,221
Maybe. If it is Wilson,
he's fast on the draw, so be careful.

634
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:39,726
You seem to know a lot about
this kind of business, Shane.

635
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:43,146
That is enough. Come and eat
before things get cold.

636
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:47,150
I don't want no part of gunslinging.
Murder's a better name.

637
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:52,739
We eat now, everyone.
You fellows get the shoe game.

638
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:56,826
Torrey, I want to go to the blacksmith's...

639
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,497
but Joe says we shouldn't go alone.

640
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:05,001
Any time you wanna go to town,
I'll ride along with you.

641
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:08,672
I'm a soldier who's done fighting
in real battles.

642
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,924
I can shoot just as straight...

643
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,685
Shane.

644
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,064
- Yes, Joey?
- Think that was him?

645
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:30,610
- Who?
- That man Torrey seen in town.

646
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,822
Do you think that was Wilson?

647
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:39,494
- Don't worry about things like that.
- Rest, Joey. It's past your bedtime.

648
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,830
Yes, Mother.

649
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,545
- No, Joey. I'll open it.
- All right.

650
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,715
All right. I'll open the gate for you.

651
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,217
Who goes there?

652
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,803
Brother Rufe's come
to pay you a little visit.

653
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,406
Howdy, Starrett.

654
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,493
Evening, ma'am.

655
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,415
I had something I wanted
to talk over with you.

656
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,878
Whatever business we got,
we can talk over right here.

657
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:35,050
I'll just lay it on the barrelhead, then.
How'd you like to work for me?

658
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,511
I work for myself.
Done enough working for others.

659
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,930
Wait till I tell you.

660
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:46,519
I'll pay you top wages.
More than you make on this patch of ground.

661
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:49,189
No, I'm not interested.

662
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:55,111
I haven't said it all.
You can run your cattle with mine.

663
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:58,698
What's more, I'll buy your homestead.

664
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:03,536
Set a price you think is reasonable,
you'll find me reasonable.

665
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:06,039
Is that fair?

666
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:10,126
You've made things hard for us,
and we're in the right.

667
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,047
Right? You in the right?

668
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:23,181
When I came to this country,
you weren't much older than your boy.

669
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:30,230
We had rough times. Me and other men
that are mostly dead now.

670
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:35,068
I got a bad shoulder yet
from a Cheyenne arrowhead.

671
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:39,656
We made this country,
we found it and we made it...

672
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:42,951
with blood and empty bellies.

673
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:47,580
Cattle we brought in were hazed off
by Indians and rustlers.

674
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:51,918
They don't bother you much any more
because we handled them.

675
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,505
We made a safe range out of this.

676
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:59,926
Some of us died doing it,
but we made it.

677
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:05,682
Then people move in who never
had to raw-hide it through the old days.

678
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:11,020
They fence off my range
and fence me off from water.

679
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:16,860
Some of them plow ditches,
take out irrigation water.

680
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:23,616
So the creek runs dry sometimes
and I gotta move my stock because of it.

681
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:27,453
And you say we have no right
to the range.

682
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:31,791
The men that did the work
and ran the risks have no rights?

683
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:37,172
I take you for a fair man, Starrett.

684
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:43,553
I'm not belittling what you did,
but you didn't find this country.

685
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:47,515
There were trappers here
and Indian traders before you.

686
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:51,311
- They tamed this country.
- They weren't ranchers.

687
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:56,524
Rights. You think you've the right
to say nobody else has got any.

688
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,777
That ain't the way
the government looks at it.

689
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:05,742
I didn't come to argue.
I made you a fair proposition.

690
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,036
What about the others?

691
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:12,081
- Shane knows he can work for me.
- The other homesteaders?

692
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,751
Look, be reasonable.

693
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:20,757
After all, there's just so many hands
in a deck of cards.

694
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:29,432
- Then, I've got to say no.
- You don't give a man much choice.

695
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:42,028
How do you feel about it, son?
Would you like to go partners with me?

696
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:47,033
I don't want trouble with your father.
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

697
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:51,955
- Joey ain't quite of age, Ryker.
- How about it, son?

698
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,582
Come here, Joey.

699
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,803
I don't want you to be sorry, Starrett.

700
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,432
I'll see you.

701
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,286
What do you make of him?

702
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,497
He's no cow-puncher.

703
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,625
No. He doesn't look the part.

704
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:13,911
I like Starrett too,
but I'll kill him if I have to.

705
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:19,083
- I'll kill him if I have to.
- You mean I'll kill him if you have to.

706
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:25,214
I can't have any run-in with the law.
You heard Grafton.

707
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:31,471
Just get Starrett in here.
It wouldn't take much to bait him.

708
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:38,728
Well, lookie here.

709
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,612
Lookie here.

710
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:10,176
Why don't we just gun him
and get on with it?

711
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:15,556
One's run already.
It won't take much to stampede the rest.

712
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:23,773
Remember, Wilson, you got
to make this look right to Grafton.

713
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,339
Hey, come here.

714
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:38,764
Torrey. I wouldn't go over there, Torrey.

715
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:42,059
Nobody's gonna buffalo me.

716
01:14:55,824 --> 01:15:01,370
- What can I do for you?
- Where do you think you're going?

717
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,874
- To get a whiskey.
- Torrey.

718
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,007
Torrey.

719
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,728
Torrey.

720
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:58,427
They tell me they call you "Stonewall."

721
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:04,141
- Anything wrong with that?
- It's just funny.

722
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:10,690
I guess they named a lot of that...

723
01:16:10,857 --> 01:16:14,360
Southern trash after old Stonewall.

724
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:22,535
Who'd they name you after?
Or would you know?

725
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:29,875
I'm saying that "Stonewall" Jackson
was trash himself.

726
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:35,256
Him and Lee,
and all the rest of them Rebs.

727
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,677
You too.

728
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:45,433
- You're a low-down, lying Yankee.
- Prove it.

729
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,520
No, Torrey.

730
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:16,255
One less sodbuster.

731
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,926
- What?
- He tried to pull on Wilson.

732
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:25,723
- Ain't that right, Swede?
- He tried to reach for a...

733
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:29,685
All right. Get him out of here.

734
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:34,815
Tell your friends
we'll be waiting for any more...

735
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,110
that come in looking for trouble.

736
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:42,323
You understand that, Swede?

737
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,826
Now get him out of here.

738
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,705
- What happened?
- The sodbuster tried to kill Wilson.

739
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:55,878
- What's the shooting?
- Sodbuster tried to pull on Wilson.

740
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:05,388
Lewis!

741
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:12,144
- Lewis!
- Pa! What's happened?

742
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:17,400
- Lewis!
- Fred!

743
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,486
Fred!

744
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,920
Torrey, he is dead!

745
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:41,340
Ryker did it!

746
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:46,887
I'll go get Starrett.

747
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:55,396
Shane, we sure enough
earned our keep today.

748
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:00,609
If they just leave us alone,
we'll make a farm out of this yet.

749
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:03,446
Somebody's coming, Pa.

750
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:10,244
- Looks like Shipstead.
- It's Mr. Shipstead.

751
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,122
Starrett!

752
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,417
Torrey, he is dead!

753
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,837
Torrey?

754
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,883
Torrey, he is dead!

755
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:30,973
The new man shot him,
the new man that works for Ryker did it.

756
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:39,315
I was across the street,
I heard anger in the voices.

757
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,401
The two of them reach for pistols...

758
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:46,280
but the new man is
quick, terribly quick.

759
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:51,160
One shot, Torrey dead.

760
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,580
- One shot.
- What happened?

761
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:59,877
We go to town together.
He say it be safe.

762
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:03,506
It was all quiet. We separate.

763
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:09,136
Then the anger in the voices, I hear.
Only the anger, not the words.

764
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,473
Ryker's men were all around.

765
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,266
What started it?

766
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:20,272
I passed Lewis,
his missus and Johnson. They're scared.

767
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,984
- Who saw it?
- Just the Ryker men and me.

768
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:29,907
Morgan say they wait for any more
who come looking for trouble.

769
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:34,453
Marian, you get ready.
Mrs. Torrey will need you.

770
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:38,791
Shane, hitch up the team.

771
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,293
What are you going to do, Joe?

772
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:45,548
- Go to town. I'm gonna see about this.
- You can't go alone.

773
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:49,468
- Marian, I'm going.
- She's right, Joe.

774
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:55,808
But the others are all in this,
it's not just you. Wait for them.

775
01:20:55,976 --> 01:21:02,982
- Sooner or later, someone's got to go.
- But not now. Don't you go alone.

776
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:09,238
The other homesteaders, I think they run.
I think they get out of here.

777
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:16,745
Here comes Joe Starrett.
Wish he'd tend to his own business.

778
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:26,046
- What goes on?
- We're going on. I've had enough.

779
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,841
I sure figured you for a better man.

780
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:33,262
You saw what's happened.
Torrey's dead.

781
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,557
Just gonna pile up your plunder and skip.

782
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,185
Too scared to see Torrey
get a decent funeral.

783
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:43,272
I don't want him killed. We're going.

784
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:47,026
It ain't a question
of who stays or who runs.

785
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:51,363
We gotta see Stonewall
get a Christian burial...

786
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:55,492
and his wife hear some words of comfort
said over her man.

787
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,912
We'll make sure it's done.

788
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,291
Torrey's already dead.
I don't want it to happen to my man.

789
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:08,505
Fred, if you ain't at that funeral,
I'll sure take it bad of you.

790
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:13,761
Well, cemetery hill's
on the way out, Martha.

791
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:21,393
Before my closing eyes

792
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:25,314
Shine through the gloom

793
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:30,986
And point me to the skies

794
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:35,950
Heav'n's morning breaks

795
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:41,747
And earth's vain shadows flee

796
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:46,877
In life, in death, O Lord

797
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:47,929
Abide with me

798
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:08,190
Shipstead, would you please,
lead us in the Lord's Prayer?

799
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:16,198
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

800
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:22,830
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.

801
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,874
Give us this day our daily bread...

802
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:32,172
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

803
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:37,803
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

804
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:41,348
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power...

805
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,810
and the glory, forever. Amen.

806
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,948
He's gonna bite you.

807
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:27,556
Goodbye, Mrs. Starrett, we're going.

808
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:33,478
Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye, Axel.
Goodbye, John.

809
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:36,648
Sue, you put the kids in the wagon.

810
01:26:36,816 --> 01:26:40,194
Wait for me, Lewis.
I'm coming with you.

811
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:46,533
Wait a minute, let's not be in a hurry.
There's one more thing.

812
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,495
Torrey was a pretty brave man.

813
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:54,917
We'd be doing wrong
if we wasn't the same.

814
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:58,295
Last time you argued that,
Torrey was alive.

815
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:03,884
- You want us to stay for more of this?
- We can have a regular settlement.

816
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:07,930
We can have a town,
and churches and a school.

817
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:10,807
Graveyards.

818
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:16,396
You've just got to, that's all.

819
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:21,944
He wants you to stay for something
that means more than anything.

820
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:23,946
Your families.

821
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:26,949
Your wives and kids.

822
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:30,744
Like you, Lewis, your girls...

823
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,373
and Shipstead with his boys.

824
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:38,835
They've got a right to stay here
and grow up and be happy.

825
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:44,341
It's up to you people
to have nerve enough to not give it up.

826
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:51,306
That's right. We can't give up this valley
and we ain't gonna do it.

827
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:57,646
This is farming country, a place for
people to bring up their families.

828
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:03,235
Who's Ryker to run us
away from our own homes?

829
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,447
He only wants to grow beef,
and we want to grow families...

830
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:12,244
to grow them good and strong,
the way they were meant to be grown.

831
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:16,623
God didn't make all this country
just for one man like Ryker.

832
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:20,168
He's got it though,
and that's what counts.

833
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:22,921
- Look, look there.
- A fire.

834
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:26,174
It's Lewis's place.

835
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,180
It's our place.

836
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,893
- Ryker lit it.
- He had no right.

837
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:40,022
He wouldn't have, if you hadn't left it.

838
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:42,899
I built it with my own hands.

839
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,320
- Not the girls' room.
- I was getting round to it.

840
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:50,157
If we stick together,
we can put that place back up.

841
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,367
- Can't we?
- Right.

842
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:56,330
We'll help you build the room,
Johnson and Joe.

843
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:59,041
- Shane'll help.
- Yeah.

844
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:03,920
We'll get the timber
and put it right back up, right?

845
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,299
- Yes, sir. We'll do it.
- Me too, I'll help.

846
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:11,053
- You'll do that for us?
- All that, just for us?

847
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:16,058
Not just for you, Martha,
for all of us in this valley.

848
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:19,478
Come and help.
Maybe we can save part of that.

849
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:25,650
That's the spirit.
Let's get to the Lewises' place.

850
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,488
Come on, men.

851
01:29:29,655 --> 01:29:32,657
Hey, come on.

852
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:40,707
Boss. Looks like Lewis is going back.

853
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,674
Starrett's holding them together.

854
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:53,637
- He could set fire to mine.
- Stay on your ground.

855
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,390
He'll do us like he did Torrey.

856
01:29:56,557 --> 01:30:01,478
- There's a law against killing.
- The law is three days' ride from here.

857
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:05,190
- You know that.
- What does that leave us with?

858
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:09,111
- Give me time.
- Who's gonna fight Ryker?

859
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:13,240
- He knows he's got us on the run.
- You men hang on.

860
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,285
- Hang on?
- I promise something's gonna be done.

861
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:19,955
But what, Joe?

862
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,500
Leave that to me.
I'll have it out with Ryker.

863
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:28,630
- You're taking on too much.
- If I have to kill him.

864
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:35,303
That's wrong. Don't even think that.

865
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,907
Starrett's got to go.

866
01:30:56,075 --> 01:31:00,912
I've warned him twice, but he's
pig-headed. He'll have to pay for it.

867
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:21,099
Joe, you can't do it.

868
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:26,313
If the Lewises have the courage
to start over, I won't let them down.

869
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:32,402
But you can't go in town
to kill Ryker. He'll kill you.

870
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:38,366
Tell him I'm a reasonable man,
things have gone far enough.

871
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:42,370
Tell him I'm beat, anything,
but, by Jupiter, get him here!

872
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:46,583
He'll come.
He thinks he's a reasonable man.

873
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:49,294
Hello, Calloway.

874
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:02,891
- He'll kill you.
- It's a chance I gotta take.

875
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:07,521
This is a false square knot, Joey,
it won't hold.

876
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:13,151
Shane. Tell him he can't go.
Tell him it won't work. Tell him.

877
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,987
Shane!

878
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:21,201
Wait, Joe, till things cool off.
Wait that long, anyway.

879
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,037
That's right, isn't it, Shane?

880
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:28,750
I can't tell Joe what's right, Marian.

881
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,785
Please wait, Joe.

882
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:08,456
Won't you do even this for me?

883
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,316
Starrett?

884
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:37,652
Mr. Starrett.

885
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:06,431
- Who is it?
- Peace party, from Ryker.

886
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,937
One of you can come across and talk.

887
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:27,869
- Stay out of that garden.
- We ain't armed.

888
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:38,380
Brother Rufe wants to see you.

889
01:34:40,549 --> 01:34:43,885
He says to tell you
he's a reasonable man.

890
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:47,055
He's responsible for Torrey's killing.

891
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:51,810
My brother wouldn't kill anybody.
He don't wanna go to jail.

892
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:55,188
Torrey was a hot-head,
he picked on a stranger.

893
01:34:55,356 --> 01:35:01,194
Torrey didn't wanna be reasonable.
You wanna be reasonable, don't you?

894
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,988
I always figured on being reasonable.

895
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:08,576
My brother's waiting.
He'll see you at Grafton's.

896
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:11,830
Who else?

897
01:35:11,997 --> 01:35:16,084
Not us. We're heading home.

898
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:21,297
I'll see your brother.

899
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:08,762
Shane.

900
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,062
Shane.

901
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:23,151
- Who is it?
- Calloway. Chris Calloway.

902
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:29,574
- Stay where you are. I can drill you.
- Hold it, I got something to tell you.

903
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:36,498
- What do you want?
- Starrett's up against a stacked deck.

904
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:38,249
Bang! Bang!

905
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:41,127
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

906
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:48,343
- Why are you telling me?
- I reckon something's come over me.

907
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:52,013
- I don't figure.
- I'm quitting Ryker.

908
01:36:52,848 --> 01:36:53,890
Bang! Bang!

909
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,393
- So long.
- Chris.

910
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:00,897
Thanks.

911
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:05,109
Be seeing you.

912
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:08,905
Bang! Bang!

913
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:21,960
No use to argue, Marian.
I'm going into this with my eyes open.

914
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:23,920
No!

915
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:27,841
Isn't there anything I can say
to change things?

916
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,718
Maybe this is a chance.

917
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,304
Morgan and them boys went home.

918
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:37,016
You don't really believe that,
that's not the reason.

919
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:43,147
It's just too much for me to give up,
this place and our valley.

920
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:46,025
- All the things that will be.
- Will be.

921
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:47,944
Bang!

922
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:51,656
Bang, bang, bang!

923
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:56,035
Joey, don't point that thing!
Go play outside.

924
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:59,205
Play outside, Joey!

925
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,920
Please, dear. Go outside and play.

926
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:15,597
It's just pride, that's all,
a silly kind of a pride.

927
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:20,602
Don't I mean anything to you, Joe?
Doesn't Joey?

928
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:24,564
Marian.

929
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:34,198
Honey, it's because you mean
so much to me that I've got to go.

930
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:41,122
Could I go on living with you,
and you thinking I'd showed yellow?

931
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,918
And what about Joey?
How would I explain that to him?

932
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:46,628
Oh, Joe.

933
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,130
Joe.

934
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:55,011
I've been thinking a lot, and...

935
01:38:56,513 --> 01:39:01,476
I know I'm kind of slow sometimes,
but I see things.

936
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:07,649
And I know if anything happened to me
that you'd be took care of.

937
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:13,446
You'd be took care of,
better than I could do it myself.

938
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:18,534
I never thought I'd live
to hear myself say that, but...

939
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:23,539
I guess now's a pretty good time
to lay things bare.

940
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:27,669
You talk as though
I'd be glad for you to go.

941
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:33,508
Honey, you're the most honest
and the finest girl that ever lived.

942
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:39,931
I couldn't do what I gotta do if I hadn't
always known I could trust you.

943
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,859
Now, don't you go counting me out.

944
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:57,865
I wouldn't have lived this long
if I wasn't pretty tough.

945
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:25,226
Pa, Shane's got his gun on.
He's coming.

946
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:27,228
Gun?

947
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:34,193
- What's the idea?
- Don't let him go. Don't anybody go.

948
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:37,572
- This is my kind of game.
- But it ain't yours.

949
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:43,036
Maybe you're a match for Ryker, maybe not,
but you're no match for Wilson.

950
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:47,415
Then, I'll outlast him.
But I do appreciate it, Shane.

951
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:51,627
You're both out of your senses.
This isn't worth a life.

952
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:56,382
Are you fighting for this shack,
this ground and nothing but work?

953
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:01,721
I'm sick of it, I'm sick of trouble.
Let's move, let's go on, please.

954
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:06,434
Marian, don't say that.
You love this place more than me.

955
01:41:06,643 --> 01:41:09,937
- Not anymore.
- Even if it's true, it changes nothing.

956
01:41:10,105 --> 01:41:14,025
There must be some way, Shane?
Some way?

957
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:19,947
- It's no use, Joe.
- No use? What's stopping me?

958
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:23,409
- I am.
- Get out of my way.

959
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:29,290
- Am I gonna have to fight you too?
- That depends on you.

960
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:35,129
No!

961
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,178
Stop!

962
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:04,575
Stop!

963
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:47,678
No.

964
01:43:56,021 --> 01:44:00,733
Shane, you hit him with your gun.
I hate you!

965
01:44:08,367 --> 01:44:14,789
- Walk him around when he comes to.
- Joey, bring water and a towel.

966
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:17,875
Here, Marian. Hide this.

967
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:21,963
He'll be all right.

968
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:26,926
No one can blame him
for not keeping that date.

969
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:30,721
Shane, wait.

970
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:39,647
- You were through with gunfighting.
- I changed my mind.

971
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:43,484
Are you doing this just for me?

972
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:46,362
For you, Marian...

973
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:49,824
and Joe and little Joe.

974
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:56,163
Then we'll never see you again?

975
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:59,375
Never's a long time, Marian.

976
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:04,255
Tell him...
Tell him I was sorry.

977
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:08,009
No need to tell him that.

978
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:11,512
Please, Shane.

979
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:16,142
Mother.

980
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,940
Please.

981
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,406
Take care of yourself.

982
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:47,840
Mother. Pa's coming along all right.

983
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,470
Yes, Joey.

984
01:45:52,637 --> 01:45:56,807
- Why did Shane?
- Shane did what he had to do.

985
01:45:56,975 --> 01:46:01,562
- You don't hate Shane.
- I know, Mother.

986
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:07,026
Shane.

987
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:10,738
I'm sorry.

988
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:14,700
He didn't hear you.

989
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:24,752
Shane!

990
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:31,550
Shane! I'm sorry!

991
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,853
I came to get your offer, Ryker.

992
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:57,358
I'm not dealing with you.
Where's Starrett?

993
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:02,946
- You're dealing with me, Ryker.
- I got no quarrel with you, Shane.

994
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:06,492
You can walk out now
and no hard feeling.

995
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:10,788
- What's your offer, Ryker?
- To you, not a thing.

996
01:51:10,955 --> 01:51:14,875
- That's too bad.
- Too bad.

997
01:51:15,043 --> 01:51:20,047
You've lived too long.
Your kind of days are over.

998
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:25,302
- My days? And yours, gunfighter?
- The difference is I know it.

999
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:29,306
So we'll turn in our six-guns
to the bartender...

1000
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:33,560
and we'll all start hoeing spuds,
is that it?

1001
01:51:33,728 --> 01:51:36,230
Not quite yet.

1002
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:41,402
We haven't heard from your friend here.

1003
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:52,788
I wouldn't push too far if I were you.

1004
01:52:14,936 --> 01:52:17,896
Our fight ain't with you.

1005
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:23,986
- It ain't with me, Wilson?
- No, it ain't, Shane.

1006
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:27,573
I wouldn't pull on Wilson, Shane.

1007
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:30,826
Will, you're a witness to this.

1008
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:36,123
So you're Jack Wilson.

1009
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:39,126
What's that mean to you, Shane?

1010
01:52:39,294 --> 01:52:42,171
I've heard about you.

1011
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:46,967
What have you heard, Shane?

1012
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:59,897
I've heard that you're
a low-down, Yankee liar.

1013
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:10,157
Prove it.

1014
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,440
Shane, look out!

1015
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:21,019
Shane.

1016
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:27,734
I knew you could, Shane.
I knew it just as well as anything.

1017
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:31,196
Was that him? Was that Wilson?

1018
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:36,326
That was him.
That was Wilson, all right.

1019
01:54:36,494 --> 01:54:40,706
He was fast, fast on the draw.

1020
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,668
Joey, what are you doing here?

1021
01:54:46,254 --> 01:54:51,425
- I'm sorry, Shane.
- You don't have to be.

1022
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:56,597
- You'd better run back.
- Can't I ride home behind you?

1023
01:54:58,099 --> 01:55:00,684
I'm afraid not, Joey.

1024
01:55:00,852 --> 01:55:04,021
Please. Why not?

1025
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:08,275
I gotta be going on.

1026
01:55:09,402 --> 01:55:12,279
Why, Shane?

1027
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:18,076
A man has to be what he is, Joey.
Can't break the mold.

1028
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:25,500
- I tried it and it didn't work for me.
- We want you, Shane.

1029
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:33,425
Joey, there's no living with a killing.
There's no going back from one.

1030
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:37,471
Right or wrong, it's a brand.
A brand sticks.

1031
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:42,100
There's no going back.

1032
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:45,896
Now you run on home to your mother,
and tell her...

1033
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:52,027
Tell her everything's all right and there
aren't any more guns in the valley.

1034
01:55:52,195 --> 01:55:53,987
Shane.

1035
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:58,325
It's bloody. You're hurt.

1036
01:56:01,663 --> 01:56:04,623
I'm all right, Joey.

1037
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:11,672
Go home to your mother and father
and grow up to be strong and straight.

1038
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:16,134
And, Joey...

1039
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:20,681
take care of them, both of them.

1040
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:27,354
Yes, Shane.

1041
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:43,120
He'd never have shot you
if you'd seen him!

1042
01:56:43,287 --> 01:56:45,205
Bye, little Joe.

1043
01:56:48,793 --> 01:56:53,380
He'd never even have cleared
the holster, would he, Shane?

1044
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:09,396
Pa's got things for you to do!
And Mother wants you!

1045
01:57:09,605 --> 01:57:12,107
I know she does!

1046
01:57:13,234 --> 01:57:13,734
Shane!

1047
01:57:26,664 --> 01:57:28,749
Come back!

1048
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,888
Bye, Shane!
