1
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,232
Is Mr. Benton here yet?
The agent for the apartment.

2
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,484
- Yes, he's in there waiting for you.
- Thank you.

3
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:33,034
- Good morning.
- I hope I haven't kept you waiting?

4
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:38,080
Not at all. But I'm afraid
you won't meet Mr. Denmark, the owner.

5
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:42,706
- He flew to Europe.
- I'm disappointed. Wasn't that sudden?

6
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:48,504
Very. But you know how tax people
are when you skip a whole year.

7
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,933
The result is that
a longer lease is now possible.

8
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:59,515
- Open, if you don't mind.
- Hm? Oh.

9
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,896
Certainly.

10
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:13,659
How long a lease? Not that it matters
if he insists on 1000 a month.

11
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,402
That's why I wanted to see him.

12
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:22,080
He won't need the place for years.
Mr. Whiskers really blew his top.

13
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:27,670
- He can't come back to this country?
- It would be the very height of folly.

14
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,007
Oh, I see.

15
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:35,173
That throws an entirely different
light. Where's that lease?

16
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,514
- I haven't got it with me.
- Never mind. You can mail it.

17
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,891
This is for two months,
first and last.

18
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,266
- Isn't that the deal?
- Correct.

19
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:50,236
- When would you like to take it?
- Anything wrong with now?

20
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:56,030
- Nothing at all. It's a bit unusual...
- Thank you. You've been awfully kind.

21
00:09:56,204 --> 00:10:01,828
Thank you. It's a pleasure to do
business with a lady of such decision.

22
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:06,711
- Bye, now.
- Yes, of course.

23
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:11,550
- How long shall I make the lease for?
- A year will be quite enough.

24
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,010
Don't you think you ought...?

25
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,025
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Bingo.

26
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,692
<i>I'll be right over!</i>

27
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,833
- To the left.
- Thanks.

28
00:10:56,265 --> 00:11:01,604
Put them on, no men here yet.
You got here fast. Did you take a cab?

29
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:08,224
I didn't have money. I got the Chrysler
people to demonstrate the car again.

30
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:13,486
- The one with gold trim?
- Was it gold? I didn't wear my specs.

31
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,193
The one they sent for me
had gold trim.

32
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,575
- Smooth, huh?
- Creamy.

33
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,042
- Are we really in?
- Built in.

34
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,798
- I'll call Loco.
- Loco who?

35
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,582
The girl I told you about,
from Jersey.

36
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:38,637
- You didn't say her name was Loco.
- It's what the models call her.

37
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,468
- It means crazy.
- That's what I know.

38
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,062
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Bingo.

39
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,395
- Hold that.
- Just a minute.

40
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,354
I can't live with a dame
I never met.

41
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,861
You don't have to.
I'll just ask her over.

42
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,610
If you don't like her,
that's the end.

43
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,450
- Is she class?
- Is she?

44
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:00,987
She's been on <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>
three times.

45
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:05,246
- She knows how to handle it?
- Let's see if she does.

46
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:09,328
- How much money you got?
<i>- I've got a quarter.</i>

47
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:14,791
Wonderful. Stop on your way and
pick up something for lunch for us.

48
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,464
<i>- How many?</i>
- Three.

49
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:19,427
<i>Okay, as soon as</i>
<i>I get something on.</i>

50
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:24,013
A fine addition to a million-
dollar proposition. One quarter.

51
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:29,392
Maybe. But she's awful clever
with a quarter.

52
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,148
I don't know how to thank you.
I'm still so embarrassed.

53
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:41,699
No reason to be. Anybody can forget
their money, I've done it myself.

54
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:45,704
- Hi, honey.
- Come on in.

55
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,619
I met this man at the meat counter.
What was your name?

56
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:53,379
Tom Brookman. B-R-O-O-K-M-A-N.

57
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,177
This is Miss Pola Debevoise.
And this is Miss Page, isn't it?

58
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:01,763
- Mrs. Page.
- How do you do? It was very funny.

59
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:06,269
I was ordering, and Miss Dempsey
said she only had a quarter...

60
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:10,650
- Just set that down.
- Shall I put them in the kitchen?

61
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:15,402
- Better not, the cook's not dressed.
- Really?

62
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,316
- Thank you.
- I thought...

63
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,442
Another day.
Give us a ring.

64
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:22,655
- I don't know the number.
- It's in the book.

65
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,662
- Thank you very much.
- I don't know your first name.

66
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,539
He was nice.
I thought he'd have lunch.

67
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:34,878
The first rule is, gentleman callers
have got to wear a tie.

68
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:41,801
If we begin with characters like him,
we might as well throw in the towel.

69
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:02,990
Thanks, Nick. Keep the change.

70
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:08,364
- How do you do, Mr. Brookman?
- Hi, Pete.

71
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:14,920
The thing to remember is,
a man in the cold cuts...

72
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:19,213
...is not as attractive as one
in the mink department.

73
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:21,878
- He was cute.
- Sure he was.

74
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:26,220
- I never met a gas jockey that wasn't.
- Is that what he is?

75
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:32,100
You bet your life he is. I know,
I married one once. Very cute.

76
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:36,604
- I didn't know you were married.
- She just got back from Reno.

77
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,897
- Then you must be loaded.
- No.

78
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:43,071
You won't read about my divorce,
the wife finished second.

79
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:45,118
Isn't that against the law?

80
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:48,705
I was nuts about him.
Know what he did to me?

81
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,786
First, he gave me a phony name.
Second, he was already married.

82
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:58,590
Third, the minute the preacher
said amen, he never did any work.

83
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,964
Then he stole my TV set. I asked him
about it and he hit me with a chicken.

84
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:08,391
- A live chicken?
- No, baked and stuffed.

85
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,646
He sounds incompatible to me.

86
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:18,102
Last I saw him, I got out of the car
at a gas station and had to walk home.

87
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm surprised you'd want
to marry again.

88
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,074
That's the point of this setup.
Of course I want to get married again.

89
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:31,660
Who doesn't? It's the biggest thing
you can do in life.

90
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:40,174
Most people use more brains picking a
horse than they do picking a husband.

91
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:43,421
- Really?
- Use your head, not your heart.

92
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,878
I see.

93
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:47,305
Tell her your idea.

94
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,056
The idea is this, if you could
choose anyone in the world...

95
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:56,015
...would you marry
a rich guy or a poor one?

96
00:15:56,193 --> 00:16:00,357
- I'd rather marry a rich one.
- Where would you meet one?

97
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:04,695
In a walkup on Amsterdam Avenue,
or in a joint like this?

98
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:10,243
- I should say in a joint like this.
- Okay then, that's it.

99
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:16,288
We all work, so we combine what we
make and organize this marriage caper.

100
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,957
Class address, class background,
class characters.

101
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:25,970
- Nothing under six figures a year.
- I've never heard anything so smart.

102
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,387
To catch a mouse, set a mousetrap.
So we set a bear trap.

103
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:35,312
- One of us has got to knock off a bear.
- You mean marry him?

104
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:39,267
If you don't, you haven't caught him,
he's caught you.

105
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:46,112
Ever since I was a girl, I've had
the same dream: Marry a zillionaire.

106
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:49,244
- You know who I'd like to marry?
- Who?

107
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:50,534
Rockefeller.

108
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:53,500
- Which one?
- I don't care.

109
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:58,792
- I wouldn't mind marrying a vanderbilt.
- Or Mr. Cadillac.

110
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:03,211
- No such person. I checked.
- Is there a Mr. Texaco?

111
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,928
No.

112
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:09,883
- How about one of those rich maharajas?
- How about three of them?

113
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,226
It'd be wonderful if
they all married us!

114
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:19,482
- Think of all the diamonds and rubies.
- And all those crazy elephants.

115
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:25,489
- This is really living it up.
- People living another way are crazy.

116
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,654
- Who's gonna pay for it?
- How about that?

117
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:32,197
- I'll tell you.
- I knew it couldn't last.

118
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:36,406
Relax, will you?
Break open that other bottle.

119
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:45,918
I'm from the Bennett Music Company.
Are you the lady...?

120
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:49,222
- That's right, come right in.
- Thank you.

121
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:56,386
The reason I called is, what will
you give for this piano, cash?

122
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:03,523
Well, it's a very handsome
instrument.

123
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:11,780
Pola, I think she's the most
intelligent person I ever met.

124
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:17,163
It's not in first-class condition,
you understand...

125
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:22,253
...but we might be interested
in paying you, say, $2500?

126
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,050
Take it.

127
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:33,725
Well, kids? Where'll we eat
tonight? Stork or "21"?

128
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,914
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Trafalgar-75098?</i>

129
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,209
- Yes.
<i>- Who 's this, Miss Page?</i>

130
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:04,998
<i>- Yes. Who 's this?</i>
- This is Tom Brookman.

131
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:08,176
- You remember me?
<i>- Oh, sure, but...</i>

132
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:13,090
I didn't realize who you were
until I picked up an old magazine.

133
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:16,973
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- You were Miss Steinbach Beer.

134
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:22,567
- Yes, I believe I was.
<i>- That's you jumping around in a girdle?</i>

135
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:26,649
I wouldn't say jumping around,
I'm supposed to be dancing.

136
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:31,615
I was wondering if you'd have dinner
with me some night.

137
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:35,238
<i>- What about tonight?</i>
- I can't tonight.

138
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:38,167
<i>- Tomorrow night?</i>
- I'm sorry.

139
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:42,367
<i>- What about Thursday night?</i>
- You're wasting your time.

140
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:45,002
Don't call again, will you?

141
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:03,228
- Hey, kid. Pola!
- Yes?

142
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:10,028
- Think we'll ever get this going?
- What do you mean?

143
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:14,577
Nearly three months,
and we can't even get engaged.

144
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,695
- I could've got engaged last week.
- Who to?

145
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,330
- The English fellow.
- What fellow?

146
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,421
The one that borrowed
five dollars.

147
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:29,299
Here we are set up for the
carriage train, and what do we get?

148
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:34,012
You hook a schnook, I'm invited
to Hamburger Heaven for dinner...

149
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:38,310
...and Loc shows up each night
with a man from the drugstore...

150
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:44,225
...with more shower caps and quarts
of aspirin. Where will that get us?

151
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:49,982
It's not us. It's the men.
They're getting more and more nervous.

152
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,362
Especially the loaded ones.

153
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,944
Meanwhile, where we gonna
sit next week?

154
00:20:56,204 --> 00:21:02,871
We're trying. It isn't always easy to
find out if they're rich or married.

155
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,873
They look at you like you're prying.

156
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,713
Something's got to break,
or we'll be on the street.

157
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:14,713
And all we need is just one.
That's the beauty of a bear trap.

158
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:20,726
You don't have to catch a herd.
All you need is one nice, big fat one.

159
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:27,935
Probably Miss Perth Amboy again
with another load of Kleenex.

160
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,651
Thanks.

161
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,195
- Hello, Schatze.
- Hello.

162
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,944
This is...
Sorry, what was your name?

163
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:42,657
- J.D. Hanley.
- This is Schatze Page.

164
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,752
- And Pola Debevoise.
- How do you do?

165
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,338
We met in the mink department
at Bergdorf's.

166
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,792
- Really?
- Yes. The clerk was...

167
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:56,388
Please excuse the apartment.
We sent everything to be cleaned.

168
00:21:56,598 --> 00:22:01,260
- But if you don't mind the dining room?
- Of course not.

169
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:10,153
With the maid off, we're roughing it.
Won't you sit down?

170
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:14,817
Thank you, but I can't stay.
I just came to help Miss Dempsey.

171
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:19,488
- Mr. Hanley is from Dallas, Texas.
- Really?

172
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:23,328
- In the oil business?
- A little, but mostly stock.

173
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,586
- Stocks and bonds?
- No. My stock is white-faced Hereford.

174
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:31,458
- Come again?
- Cattle.

175
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,544
You know, like cows.

176
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:38,921
- I see. Sure you won't sit down?
- I haven't time right now.

177
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:43,560
But I was telling Miss Dempsey
about an organization I'm in...

178
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:49,565
...the Oil Institute. We're having
an informal reception tonight.

179
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,776
If you'd honor us with your presence,
you'd make us all very happy.

180
00:22:54,948 --> 00:23:00,370
- You mean nothing but oil men?
- Well, probably a few bankers too.

181
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:04,072
- Bankers will be all right.
- Naturally.

182
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:10,584
I realize this is sudden, but there'll
be dancing, a few drinks, and laughs.

183
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,544
- Sounds creamy to me.
- I like laughs.

184
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:15,629
- It's a deal?
- I'd love it.

185
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:19,096
Wonderful.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

186
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:22,682
- We'll meet the other men too?
- All of them.

187
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:27,810
- And they're not all old like me.
- Oh, stop it!

188
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:31,731
- You look just the prime to me.
- Thank you, ladies.

189
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:35,486
You've already made my trip
to New York worthwhile.

190
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,148
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

191
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,877
I think this is it, kids.

192
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:59,176
A great big room full of nothing
but rich millionaires. And us.

193
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,514
Very good idea. Where shall we go?

194
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,232
Well, there's a new place...

195
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:21,027
- Good evening.
- Have you a table for two?

196
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:23,776
Certainly, sir. This way, madame.

197
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,089
- Champagne?
- We might as well.

198
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:45,763
- A table for two, Philip.
- Certainly. This way.

199
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:49,055
- The best, you know.
- Certainly, sir.

200
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:53,139
The best we have, sir.

201
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:58,281
- A quart of champagne.
- What kind?

202
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:01,367
- The best you've got.
- Very good, sir.

203
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,909
- Good evening.
- Two, please.

204
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:06,369
This way, please.

205
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:15,294
- This way, my dear.
- I'm so sorry.

206
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,543
I am sorry.

207
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:34,850
- You said you were alone here?
- There's a party of us up from Texas.

208
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:36,225
All men?

209
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:41,826
Some wives too. You met some tonight.
The others went to a show.

210
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:45,160
- You know how women are in New York.
- I know.

211
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:49,534
I think Ella has seen five shows
in the last three days.

212
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:50,990
I see.

213
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,661
- Ella's my daughter.
- Oh, really?

214
00:25:54,922 --> 00:26:00,082
- Is Mrs. Merrill here with you?
- There is no Mrs. Merrill.

215
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:04,508
And I live in New York.
Does that clear the situation?

216
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:07,683
Yes, indeedy it does.

217
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,889
- Are you married?
- Married?

218
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,847
At times I think
I'm the most married man in the U.S.A.

219
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:18,810
Do you know how many females
were at my house tonight?

220
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:22,820
- No, I can't say that I do.
- Seven.

221
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:28,746
My wife. Her divorced sister, and
I don't blame the guy for a second.

222
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:35,664
Their mother, who's 110 if she's
a day. An aunt from Massachusetts.

223
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:39,797
And three more whose names
I didn't even catch.

224
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:44,843
To tell the truth, I never felt
the loneliness of being a widower...

225
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:51,634
...until the past few years. At first
there were the children for company.

226
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:57,400
But they're grown up now.
My son's married, Ella's engaged.

227
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:01,614
The house is beginning
to seem pretty big and empty.

228
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:06,408
- I can imagine.
- That's why I've been traveling.

229
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:11,917
London, south of France, Capri.
That's really no good, you know.

230
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:15,120
Oh, no, I know. No good at all.

231
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:20,087
Some years ago I chartered a boat.
Not large, but comfortable.

232
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:25,763
Took six months, just loafing
around the world. But it was no use.

233
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:31,350
I suppose there's really only
one cure for loneliness.

234
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,937
Yes?

235
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:36,313
- Human companionship.
- You're so right.

236
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:38,980
You don't know how right you are.

237
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:42,320
I'm not used to going out
with a married man.

238
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:47,365
If I'd asked earlier,
I don't know that I'd have come here.

239
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:49,861
This is quite innocent, isn't it?

240
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,165
If it is, it's the first time I ran
into it under similar circumstances.

241
00:27:57,462 --> 00:28:02,587
My first impulse was to go to Arabia
and take a look at the situation.

242
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,635
I was sure the chaps from Socony
would have somebody on the spot.

243
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:13,642
After all, there's quite a sum
involved, 200 or 300 million dollars.

244
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:17,181
Naturally, I wasn't going
to take any chances.

245
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,899
Well, naturally.

246
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:25,734
I've got a thing for guys that work in
gas stations. They always send me.

247
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:31,150
This one handled a Standard Oil pump.
You don't own that, do you?

248
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:33,537
No.

249
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:38,542
Standard Oil is one of the interests
of a man named Rockefeller.

250
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:42,875
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No, I'm afraid not.

251
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,133
Oh, well. But as I was saying...

252
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:52,679
When you live in an asylum like that,
you need to get away, you know?

253
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:54,430
Perfectly.

254
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:59,100
But I got that all fixed.
I got me a lodge in Maine.

255
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:02,110
I love lodges.

256
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:07,938
- You do?
- Simply adore them.

257
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:13,159
You mean, you'd like to see mine?

258
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:18,242
Well, I was speaking more figuratively
than relatively.

259
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:23,544
Because if you would,
I'm going up there Friday afternoon.

260
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:26,629
Simply adore them.

261
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:39,063
If you want to know
what kind of a guy I've got...

262
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:46,945
I'm happy. Not only is Mr. Hanley
a doll, he's absolutely unaffiliated.

263
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:51,741
- You don't think he's old?
- Wealthy men are never old.

264
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:56,787
- Mine's loaded too. But a real yawn.
- He doesn't look single.

265
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,627
- He's not.
- Then why waste your time?

266
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:03,744
What else have I got?
Unless you'd like me to join you?

267
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:08,585
- You do, I'll break your neck.
- He's invited me to a big party.

268
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:11,680
- Yeah? When?
- We're leaving Friday.

269
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:14,422
- For where?
- His lodge in Maine.

270
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,178
Are you crazy?

271
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:21,310
- I don't think so. I like lodges.
- You can't go. It violates the idea.

272
00:30:21,482 --> 00:30:27,521
- I could meet someone else up there.
- Who you gonna meet in Maine, Eskimos?

273
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:30,072
You saw who I'm with?

274
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:32,068
- I saw.
- How does he look?

275
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:35,452
- Nice for a one-eyed man.
- That's all he's got?

276
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:40,540
- Why do you think he has that patch?
- I thought someone belted him.

277
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:44,916
Can't you keep those on long enough
to see who you're with?

278
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:48,501
You know what they say
about girls with glasses.

279
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,261
Maybe he got shot.

280
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:53,804
He sounds great.
I wish I knew how he looked.

281
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:55,724
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

282
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:59,517
But he hasn't mentioned anything
under $ 1,000,000.

283
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:04,315
My guy's class. Never mentions
his wealth, just refers to it.

284
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:07,569
Mr. Brewster talks about
his horrible family.

285
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:11,783
But we haven't ordered anything yet
under $5 a portion.

286
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,035
Don't forget to take the leftovers.

287
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:18,579
We'd better get back
before they cool off.

288
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,164
Where is Maine anyway?

289
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:13,837
I'll take that, and that,
and that and that, and that.

290
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:17,224
And that, and that,
and that and that.

291
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,930
- And charge it.
- Yes, Mrs. Hanley.

292
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,153
Next stop, Arabia, sir.

293
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,269
Is he kidding?

294
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:11,778
No. It's an old custom
to make a stranger feel welcome.

295
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:18,151
Tell him from me he's simply a doll.
I'm crazy about these old customs.

296
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,553
Hello, Fashion House?

297
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:48,308
Is Mr. Antoine in for Mr. Brookman?
Thank you.

298
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:51,689
Mr. Antoine?

299
00:33:51,945 --> 00:33:53,736
On the phone.

300
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:56,070
- Tony? Hi.
<i>- How are you?</i>

301
00:33:56,324 --> 00:34:00,452
Fine. Tell me, how are you
fixed for beach stuff?

302
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,823
<i>- You mean...?</i>
- I wanna get something for my aunt.

303
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,282
<i>- How old?</i>
- About 25. A young aunt.

304
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:09,994
<i>- I can accommodate you.</i>
- Could I see it on them?

305
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,538
<i>- Today?</i>
- That's the idea.

306
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,255
- Know a model named Schatze?
<i>- Who?</i>

307
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:16,927
Schatze.

308
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:20,630
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Page.</i>
- That's the one.

309
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,144
- Nice joint you got here.
- Thank you, sir.

310
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,019
- Sit here.
- If you'll excuse me.

311
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:34,695
- Is your aunt blond or brunette?
- Depends on the weather.

312
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,399
I'm not going to stall
at all with Mr. Hanley.

313
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,865
What will you do, mother him?

314
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:46,452
That's all right for kids. But I don't
think that's what he has in mind.

315
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:51,503
Our first we call
"Rainbow over the Everglades."

316
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:58,171
It's a pastel plaid silk day dress
with a voluminous skirt...

317
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,593
...for cocktail parties
and afternoon gatherings.

318
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,318
You know, of course, that diamonds
are a girl's best friend.

319
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,735
This is our proof of it.

320
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,047
- You're not going with him, are you?
- For heaven's sakes, no.

321
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,926
- You're on, Loc.
- Goodness!

322
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,390
This one we call
"Lookie, Lookie, Lookie."

323
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,064
It begins as
a spectator sports dress.

324
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,985
- Well, get you!
- Hi.

325
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:02,694
Which converts into a one-piece play
costume of jersey and matching wool.

326
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,503
Our next is
"Good Afternoon, Sweetheart."

327
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,839
This is a tea dress which plunges
in the back, not the front.

328
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:29,387
Made of imported printed sheer,
with parasol to match.

329
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,698
- You like that, monsieur?
<i>- Comme ci, comme ça</i>

330
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,533
- He's really the end of the line.
- Still think he's cute.

331
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,165
- Who is he?
- That garage man.

332
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,169
- What garage?
- The fellow with the cold cuts.

333
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,299
"Trouble in the Afternoon."

334
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,386
A beach boy's shirt of gingham,
with a deep rose cummerbund...

335
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,926
...and a coolie hat of natural straw.

336
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,441
"Hard-Hearted Hannah"
is a Palm Beach stroller...

337
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:23,147
...consisting of mustard crash pants
and a blouse of gray and white silk.

338
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:33,076
Next is "Double Frozen Daiquiris,"
a beach costume with sleek pants...

339
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,956
...with a wraparound of Thai silk.

340
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:40,459
Notice the Egyptian influence
in the bazaar raffia hat.

341
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:46,878
"South of the Border" is Mexican
grace of black cotton...

342
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:51,766
...a tamale-colored serape,
and a Payon straw hat.

343
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,146
Can I take a look
at that pink and blue job?

344
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,234
Of course, sir. Miss Schatze?

345
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:33,810
- Much obliged, Tony.
- Not at all, sir.

346
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,856
- Can I put anything aside?
- No, nothing I want. Thanks again.

347
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,438
All right, girls. Thank you.

348
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,108
- Mr. Antoine?
- Yes?

349
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:53,574
I know him. He's making
a chump out of you.

350
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,207
Do I tell you how to put on a girdle?

351
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,377
You bet your life you don't.

352
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:04,043
Then would you be good enough
not to tell me how to do business?

353
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:06,192
- Mr. Brewster?
- Yes.

354
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:08,280
I'll take these.

355
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,573
Board!

356
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,310
- You're not the regular driver.
- No. Pa's the regular driver.

357
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:47,946
He went to a Republican rally
last night and couldn't get up.

358
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:52,741
- Certainly is a funny place for it.
- Funny place for what?

359
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,402
A convention.

360
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:17,349
- What's this?
- The lodge, naturally.

361
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,271
This house?

362
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:35,904
- It'll look better with a fire.
- Where are the others?

363
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,369
- Other what?
- Members.

364
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:43,244
I'm sorry. I don't know what
you're talking about half the time.

365
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,255
- You said it was a lodge.
- I did. It is.

366
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:49,342
Where are the members?
Like the Elks Lodge.

367
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:55,098
I went to a convention two years ago.
There were thousands of members.

368
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:57,182
It was the happiest time.

369
00:41:57,435 --> 00:42:01,765
- Is that what you thought this was?
- Naturally, what else?

370
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:04,693
- Where do you want these?
- In the car.

371
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:08,270
- Something wrong?
- No, we're just going back.

372
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,112
Not today.
No more trains until tomorrow.

373
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:15,902
- I may slit my throat.
- Would you like a fire?

374
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:18,742
- I was about to.
- I'll do it.

375
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:22,829
- I never saw so much snow.
- I'm sorry about this.

376
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:27,131
Be patient. I'll get you
out of here as soon as I can.

377
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:32,375
I figured I might have to put on
some skis, but not in this snow.

378
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:36,889
I have some rum in the pantry,
I'll get you a drink.

379
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:42,563
- Maybe you'd like a little music.
- Maybe I'd like a little poison too.

380
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:54,231
- You got radio up here?
- Sure. Radio, houses, everything.

381
00:42:54,409 --> 00:43:00,328
- Here. Take the first one straight.
- Listen. All the way from New York.

382
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:04,199
- Good old Harry James.
- Is it? How can you tell?

383
00:43:04,377 --> 00:43:08,209
How I can tell is
because it is Harry James.

384
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:12,877
<i>You're listening</i>
<i>to the music of Ziggy Colombo.</i>

385
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:18,765
- Turn that liar off!
- Stop acting like a brat and behave.

386
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:22,801
I've never been in
a situation like this...

387
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:28,899
...and I never will again! But it
does no good to stand here and jaw.

388
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:35,189
- I feel awful. All tingly.
- Well, I wish I did. Drink it!

389
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:41,496
- Is this rum?
- Medford Rum. Over 100 years old.

390
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:46,707
- Then I'm sick. Call a doctor.
- What are you talking about?

391
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:52,585
When rum smells like a carnation,
I've got a fever. Get a doctor, now.

392
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,465
- Don't get hysterical.
- Don't hit me!

393
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,719
I want to feel your forehead.

394
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:00,809
- There's a thermometer outside.
- Get it!

395
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:03,509
Will you please call a doctor?

396
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:07,732
- You do feel warm.
- Are you calling a doctor or not?

397
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,732
I can't, people know me here.
Don't you understand?

398
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:16,946
Am I supposed to die because
you've got a big name around here?

399
00:44:17,284 --> 00:44:20,451
- It's a little large.
- Is there a hospital?

400
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:21,747
Open.

401
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:24,363
- What?
- I'll take your temperature.

402
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,620
- Not with that flute.
- It's a thermometer.

403
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:32,836
- That's not for people!
- Open your mouth, I tell you.

404
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:36,709
And don't try to talk
until I take that out.

405
00:44:43,102 --> 00:44:45,474
If it was my daughter,
know what I'd do?

406
00:44:45,688 --> 00:44:50,848
She's not your daughter. She's not mine
either, if that's what you're driving at.

407
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:55,068
- How much is it?
- 102.

408
00:44:55,323 --> 00:44:59,569
- Is that bad?
- It's definitely a slight temperature.

409
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:03,991
Maybe you call it slight,
but she ought to be in bed.

410
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:08,745
I'm gonna die, I know it,
out here in this jungle!

411
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:12,419
- I can call Ma, she's a nurse.
- What good is that?

412
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:16,250
We tell her the symptoms,
she'll give us answers.

413
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:19,090
All right.
Be careful what you tell her.

414
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:22,264
I'll tell her what you
tell me to tell her.

415
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:30,475
Hazel? Eben.
Bring Ma, will you?

416
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:33,936
Brewster's lodge.
Yeah, he's here with...

417
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:35,352
His skis.

418
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,903
If it's mumps, I'll die.

419
00:45:38,075 --> 00:45:44,243
What's it a sign of if a girl shivers
and has a temperature of 102?

420
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:48,452
- Her eyes watering?
- Like two faucets.

421
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:50,536
They're watering.

422
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:52,788
Look at her tongue.

423
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:58,626
- It looks kind of red.
- Tongue's blotchy.

424
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:04,385
- Look behind her ears.
- Have you been scratching yourself?

425
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,898
- Models aren't allowed to scratch.
- Breaking out behind the ears.

426
00:46:21,368 --> 00:46:23,076
I see.

427
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:24,946
Okay. Thanks, Ma.

428
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,661
- Nothing to worry about.
- What is it?

429
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,951
- Measles.
- Measles?

430
00:46:31,169 --> 00:46:34,953
- I've got nothing to worry about?
- Get her to bed.

431
00:46:35,132 --> 00:46:39,379
Keep her quiet, and the room dark,
so you avoid complications.

432
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:42,512
She'll be as good as new
in a week or two.

433
00:47:01,325 --> 00:47:04,325
- Keep it.
- Much obliged.

434
00:47:13,378 --> 00:47:15,916
Yes, sir?

435
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:20,549
- Hi, Mike.
- How are you, Mr. Denmark?

436
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,346
- I thought you were in Europe.
- I was. Come back here.

437
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:31,477
- You're a friend, aren't you?
- You bet.

438
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:35,017
I'm in a jam with the tax
department. I need help.

439
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:38,983
Anything you want.
I've had tax trouble myself.

440
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:43,735
- Who's got my apartment?
- Three young businesswomen.

441
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:46,656
I have to get in.
Can you arrange it?

442
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:52,078
You can get in now. One is out with
the Texan, one with the one-eyed man.

443
00:47:52,293 --> 00:47:56,457
- And the other one?
- She's at an Elks convention.

444
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:01,256
- Want me to wait?
- If you can.

445
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:02,844
If I get a buzz, I'll come back.

446
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:08,131
That's not them. They never
get in till late. Be right back.

447
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,924
- Okay if I turn on the light?
- Sure.

448
00:49:02,488 --> 00:49:04,398
Pola left the lights on.

449
00:49:04,657 --> 00:49:09,070
- What will you have to drink?
- Milk, if you don't mind.

450
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:10,371
Milk?

451
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,706
If we've got any. Go to the kitchen,
I'll be there in a minute.

452
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:19,770
- Is that the best we've got?
- Apparently.

453
00:50:19,942 --> 00:50:26,027
But it's all I want. Schatze, you've
made my visit a very pleasant one.

454
00:50:26,198 --> 00:50:29,697
I'd like to do something
to show my appreciation.

455
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:32,656
- Don't be silly.
- Tell me something.

456
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:38,334
Is the furniture really being cleaned,
or is there another explanation?

457
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:44,125
- You don't have to worry about that.
- Did you sell it, or hock it?

458
00:50:44,383 --> 00:50:48,677
- Well, we sold it.
- Will they sell it back?

459
00:50:56,228 --> 00:51:01,567
And now, dear Schatze,
I'm afraid we must say goodbye.

460
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:05,234
I thought you were staying
until next week.

461
00:51:05,488 --> 00:51:10,150
I was. But something has happened
that I had never dreamed.

462
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:15,534
- I think it's wise to leave at once.
- What do you mean?

463
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:21,084
- Remember the first time I came here?
- Yes.

464
00:51:21,254 --> 00:51:24,208
I came in a subtle, aging widower.

465
00:51:24,466 --> 00:51:28,629
- With the rest of my days laid out.
- Really?

466
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:33,347
- But that isn't the way I went out.
- You didn't?

467
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:37,179
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

468
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:43,522
- Absolutely. No question about it.
- I don't. Not at my age anyway.

469
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:47,608
Will you stop talking about age?
You're no Methuselah.

470
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:51,280
Don't you know
you're in the prime of life?

471
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:55,318
- How old are you?
- Forty.

472
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:03,076
Oh, Schatze. That's probably
the sweetest lie you've ever told.

473
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:08,759
- 25 would be more like it.
- Don't jump to conclusions.

474
00:52:08,927 --> 00:52:15,546
It's no use, darling. I'm 56
years old, 30 years older than you.

475
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:18,596
By your standards, an old man.

476
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:23,598
We might be able to support
this difference for five years.

477
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:30,321
- What happens when I'm truly old?
- Listen, I hate young men.

478
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,167
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

479
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:51,093
- Do you have to go?
- I'm afraid so.

480
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:54,048
- Well, nighty-night.
- Good night.

481
00:52:56,976 --> 00:53:02,053
I've always liked older men.
Look at Roosevelt, Churchill.

482
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:06,976
Look at what's his name
in <i>African Queen.</i> Crazy about him.

483
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:10,030
- So you see...
- Pardon me.

484
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:12,867
- Come in.
- Hope I'm not intruding.

485
00:53:13,034 --> 00:53:17,197
- You're entitled to hope.
- Don't let her kid you.

486
00:53:17,371 --> 00:53:19,909
- I've got to go anyway.
- So early?

487
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:23,036
- I'm flying home tomorrow.
- Oh, no.

488
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:27,837
I've got to. Goodbye. It's been
a pleasure knowing all of you.

489
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:34,092
- Goodbye. Come back, will you?
- Some day, perhaps. Goodbye.

490
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:38,882
- What time does your plane leave?
- Nine.

491
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:42,347
Don't you believe anything I say?

492
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:48,272
I believe nothing could be more
wonderful, for me, than marrying you.

493
00:53:48,444 --> 00:53:53,023
- And nothing worse for you.
- Will you call before you go?

494
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,275
- It's too early.
- Please.

495
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:57,862
Very well.

496
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:01,613
Good night, darling.

497
00:54:09,131 --> 00:54:13,840
- What's the matter with him?
- I ought to punch you in the nose.

498
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:16,218
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

499
00:54:16,472 --> 00:54:19,971
Nothing but break up a play
on the two-yard line.

500
00:54:20,184 --> 00:54:24,182
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Miss Bubblehead is sorry.

501
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:27,730
- I was just anxious to tell you.
- What?

502
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:30,190
We're going to be married.

503
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:33,190
- You and who?
- Me and Stewart.

504
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:35,273
- You mean Blinky?
- Yes.

505
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:40,407
And if he doesn't fly to London,
I'll meet his mother Saturday.

506
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:44,447
- Down where?
- Atlantic City.

507
00:54:45,459 --> 00:54:50,881
- What did you say this guy did?
- Oil, darling. Simply barrels of it.

508
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:56,257
- Says he.
- You ought to hear him talk about it.

509
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:01,056
- We ought to put a check on him.
- Why? What do you mean?

510
00:55:01,226 --> 00:55:04,809
Nobody's mother lives
in Atlantic City on Saturday.

511
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,228
- Hello?
- <i>Miss Page?</i>

512
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:13,148
That's right. It's still no.

513
00:55:54,738 --> 00:55:57,194
- Who thought of this?
- What?

514
00:55:57,449 --> 00:56:00,485
- Skiing on snow.
- What else would you ski on?

515
00:56:00,744 --> 00:56:04,030
The natural way.
In Florida. On water.

516
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:08,197
Ski on water? Why, you...

517
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:24,883
Mrs. Salem.

518
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:27,594
Here she is now.

519
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:33,224
- How you feeling?
- Never mind. Where were you?

520
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:35,193
- On a mountain.
- Who with?

521
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:37,900
- Nobody.
- What's that?

522
00:56:38,156 --> 00:56:40,565
I'm going to give you
a manicure.

523
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:43,234
- What was his name?
- Eben.

524
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:46,580
You don't wanna get mixed up
with that guy.

525
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,291
- Don't I?
- Never.

526
00:56:48,543 --> 00:56:50,998
Who should
I get mixed up with?

527
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:56,544
- I won't always have measles, you know.
- Say, you are getting better!

528
00:56:56,718 --> 00:57:00,169
- Wait until we get back.
- I don't dig you sometimes.

529
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,628
What do you mean?

530
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:06,635
- Is your wife a spook?
- No. She's a true credit to her sex.

531
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:09,931
- Oh, brother.
- I mean it.

532
00:57:10,189 --> 00:57:12,645
- Then why did you flip?
- Pardon?

533
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:18,648
- What set you off that night?
- Well, you're a very beautiful woman.

534
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:22,773
- I know.
- And I was a little upset that night.

535
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:26,119
My daughter had run away
and got married.

536
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:30,867
- What's wrong with that?
- The guy's no good. He's a gigolo.

537
00:57:31,044 --> 00:57:34,413
- I might know him. What's his name?
- Martinez.

538
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,082
I read about that, a dancer.
"Hoofer Weds Heiress."

539
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:40,216
- She isn't anymore.
- What?

540
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,636
- I disinherited her.
- Disinherited her?

541
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:48,931
I'll say one thing for poor people,
they don't disinherit their children.

542
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:52,887
- They've got nothing to disinherit.
- Say that again.

543
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:56,933
Poor families don't have
any money to pass on.

544
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:59,151
It doesn't make a difference.

545
00:57:59,364 --> 00:58:04,702
No matter how much she didn't have,
my mother wouldn't disinherit me.

546
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:07,870
Do you mind if we don't talk
for a while?

547
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:10,494
Not at all.
I like not to talk.

548
00:58:57,923 --> 00:59:01,837
- This is what I wanted you to see.
- It's nice.

549
00:59:02,011 --> 00:59:05,344
It's all mine.
From the crest of that ridge...

550
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:11,184
...as far as your eye can see
to the west, to beyond Old Baldy.

551
00:59:11,478 --> 00:59:14,016
- All yours?
- Yes.

552
00:59:14,273 --> 00:59:18,436
You mean all those trees,
and mountains and everything?

553
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:19,737
That's it.

554
00:59:19,987 --> 00:59:24,067
- Well, for crying out loud.
- Isn't it beautiful?

555
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:28,405
- Isn't that what they call timber?
- Best in the world.

556
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,112
Well, what do you know about that?

557
00:59:31,373 --> 00:59:34,458
I think it's the most
beautiful sight.

558
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:40,789
- I certainly don't blame you.
- It's pure, clean and plenty of room.

559
00:59:40,966 --> 00:59:45,094
Do you think you could ever
come to like it?

560
00:59:45,262 --> 00:59:50,505
Well, I never thought about it before,
but I imagine I could.

561
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:54,896
You should see it at night,
with the moon and stars.

562
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:58,605
Look, show me again
how much is yours.

563
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:03,438
From the crest of that ridge north,
around to the west...

564
01:00:24,052 --> 01:00:29,093
It's all right. One went to work, one
to the bank, one's with the Elks.

565
01:00:29,307 --> 01:00:34,265
- You said that the other night.
- This time I'm positive.

566
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,421
Hello?
Oh, hello.

567
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:51,088
- Hello.
- Just a moment.

568
01:01:51,348 --> 01:01:53,554
- She's not back.
- She isn't?

569
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:56,513
- Want to wait?
- I'd better be going.

570
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,605
- I'll tell her you were here.
- Thanks.

571
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:02,098
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

572
01:02:05,028 --> 01:02:08,563
Sorry. One of Schatze's
friends just popped in.

573
01:02:08,823 --> 01:02:11,314
- I'll tell you what I want.
<i>- Yes?</i>

574
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:16,915
I've got to nip down to Washington
for dinner with a certain party.

575
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:20,576
<i>- Yes?</i>
- That means I'll stay overnight.

576
01:02:20,836 --> 01:02:24,288
<i>So I want you to fly</i>
<i>to Atlantic City alone...</i>

577
01:02:24,465 --> 01:02:27,134
<i>... and I'll meet you there.</i>

578
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,379
<i>- Is that all right?</i>
- Of course it is.

579
01:02:30,638 --> 01:02:32,796
Then here's the schedule.

580
01:02:33,057 --> 01:02:38,051
There's a very good flight
from La Guardia Airport at 5.

581
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:21,312
Fasten your seat belts, please.
May I take these?

582
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,691
Well, everything's okay.

583
01:04:10,155 --> 01:04:13,441
- Well, I'll be darned.
- Pardon?

584
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,527
Haven't we met before?

585
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:19,320
You're Schatze's friend.
What happened to you?

586
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:21,206
- When?
- Yesterday.

587
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,031
I told her you'd come back.

588
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:26,702
- I got tied up.
- Your wife?

589
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,747
- I'm not married.
- That's nice.

590
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:55,156
- Look.
- Yes?

591
01:04:55,367 --> 01:05:00,159
- Didn't you bring your glasses?
- What glasses?

592
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:06,333
- Don't you wear glasses?
- Oh, no! Whatever gives you that idea?

593
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:09,338
Then you've got peculiar vision.

594
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:13,290
- Why do you say that?
- You're reading upside down.

595
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:17,045
- But I'm no such thing.
- Not you, the book.

596
01:05:22,477 --> 01:05:25,727
- Isn't it silly, though?
- Is it astigmatism?

597
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:28,898
- No, just blind as a bat.
- Me too.

598
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:33,729
Really? Then why aren't
you wearing glasses?

599
01:05:34,948 --> 01:05:38,613
I am wearing glasses.

600
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:43,873
Well, there you are.

601
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:48,453
I used to be like that,
shaking hands with lamp posts...

602
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,790
...because I didn't wanna
be called "four eyes."

603
01:05:51,965 --> 01:05:55,417
Then something happened
which cured me forever.

604
01:05:55,677 --> 01:05:56,721
What was that?

605
01:05:56,888 --> 01:06:01,265
One night I said hello to three
different men I owed money to.

606
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:08,107
- But it's different with girls.
- How is it?

607
01:06:08,274 --> 01:06:12,354
You know what they say
about girls who wear glasses.

608
01:06:12,612 --> 01:06:14,439
What are you talking about?

609
01:06:14,697 --> 01:06:17,484
"Men don't attend to girls
who wear glasses."

610
01:06:17,784 --> 01:06:20,868
Did you ever try it?

611
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:24,613
- You brought them with you?
- Yes.

612
01:06:24,874 --> 01:06:28,457
Why don't you put them on
and find out?

613
01:06:28,628 --> 01:06:31,712
- With you?
- Why not?

614
01:06:33,174 --> 01:06:35,665
Well...

615
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:44,851
If you're worried about me, I already
think you're quite a strudel.

616
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:46,134
Honestly?

617
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:50,476
I've thought so from
the first minute I saw you.

618
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:55,944
Well, if you really think so.

619
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:01,109
Go ahead, put them on.

620
01:07:04,998 --> 01:07:06,955
You're crazy.

621
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:10,706
- You look better with them.
- I do?

622
01:07:10,962 --> 01:07:13,963
Gives your face a certain mystery.

623
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:18,833
- No kidding?
- And a certain kind of distinction.

624
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:21,052
What do you know about that?

625
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:24,549
You're very pretty,
if you don't mind me saying.

626
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:25,768
Not at all.

627
01:07:25,977 --> 01:07:31,647
Glasses of that type give your face
a very interesting difference.

628
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:35,524
I don't look like an old maid?

629
01:07:35,862 --> 01:07:41,532
I've never seen anybody in my life
that reminded me less of an old maid.

630
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:50,538
What's your name?

631
01:07:58,218 --> 01:08:02,263
What happened was, I sent
this check to this tax expert.

632
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,476
Instead of paying the tax,
he took the money.

633
01:08:06,643 --> 01:08:09,348
- Didn't you tell the government?
- I did.

634
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:13,056
They were sympathetic,
but still wanted the dough.

635
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:19,770
- After you told them he was a crook?
- To them, the only crook was me.

636
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:23,068
I had to have proof.
I had to get this check.

637
01:08:23,285 --> 01:08:24,827
How do you like that?

638
01:08:25,037 --> 01:08:31,371
I found out he'd gone to Kansas City.
He'll pay, or I'll break his neck.

639
01:08:31,543 --> 01:08:35,327
- Is that where he is?
- So I understand.

640
01:08:36,382 --> 01:08:41,886
- Why are you going to Atlantic City?
- Who's going to Atlantic City?

641
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:47,681
- Doesn't this plane go there?
- What are you talking about?

642
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:51,849
- This is a Midland Sky Chief.
- Are you kidding?

643
01:08:52,022 --> 01:08:56,898
Of course not. We should be
in Kansas City in 20 minutes. Why?

644
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:03,321
Nothing. Just one of those things.

645
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:10,832
Go on, tell me some more.
Tell me anything.

646
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:45,050
- Does your family live with you?
- They couldn't do that.

647
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:49,839
- So they have a place of their own.
- Sure, at Dexter Mills.

648
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:56,683
I saw a picture in <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>
of a mountain shack. It was creamy.

649
01:10:03,529 --> 01:10:07,112
- Well, here we are.
- Here we are where?

650
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:12,075
- The shack. This is it.
- What do you mean? This is a shack.

651
01:10:12,246 --> 01:10:15,532
Of course.
It's very comfortable inside.

652
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:19,243
Just a minute.
Is this really on the level?

653
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:23,411
- Is what on the level?
- Is this really your home?

654
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:26,966
It is when I'm on duty.
What did you expect?

655
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:29,466
Well, certainly not this.

656
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:34,384
It's a forestry lookout station.
They're all pretty much alike.

657
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,807
If you're so rich,
why couldn't you build a bigger one?

658
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:41,651
Rich? Who's rich?

659
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:44,099
Aren't you?

660
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,400
That's a good one. Where on earth
did you get that idea?

661
01:10:48,616 --> 01:10:54,156
- You said all these trees were yours.
- Mine to watch. That's my job.

662
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,785
But I don't even own a bush.

663
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:02,456
But I thought...
Oh, darling, this is the worst.

664
01:11:02,713 --> 01:11:05,204
What's the matter?
I don't get it.

665
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:08,669
I'm so crazy about you.

666
01:11:08,886 --> 01:11:12,587
That's wonderful.
I'm crazy about you too.

667
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:13,921
But l...

668
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:16,389
Oh, honey.

669
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:22,770
I see. You're not interested
in a man without trees.

670
01:11:22,942 --> 01:11:28,398
That's not it at all.
I'm crazy about you, but l...

671
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:33,235
- Let's not talk about it. Do you mind?
- If only you'd told me.

672
01:11:33,412 --> 01:11:38,868
I told you the first day
we went skiing that I was a ranger.

673
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,421
- Is that what you meant?
- What else could I have meant?

674
01:11:44,589 --> 01:11:49,832
I'm sorry. I just thought you meant
you came from Texas.

675
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:15,651
- What's wrong with your dad?
- Another Republican rally.

676
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:20,414
- He should join the Democrats.
- Not in Maine, too lonely.

677
01:12:38,268 --> 01:12:42,266
- Can we rent a car in Portland?
- Suppose so.

678
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,226
You mean we're driving to New York?

679
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:50,643
It's expensive, but it's the safest
way not to be seen by anybody.

680
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:06,165
When you got the measles, I thought
I'd never get out of this jam.

681
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:08,165
- Know what I did?
- What?

682
01:13:08,382 --> 01:13:12,166
I called a few friends
in Chicago and St. Louis.

683
01:13:12,427 --> 01:13:16,010
They sent telegrams to my wife,
signed with my name.

684
01:13:16,181 --> 01:13:21,009
All about this unexpected
business trip. Worked like a charm.

685
01:13:21,186 --> 01:13:23,643
That sounds very intelligent.

686
01:13:29,946 --> 01:13:33,113
If I hadn't had
that stroke of brilliance...

687
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:37,903
...there could have been serious
results in my home. And business.

688
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,413
- How you gonna show you're grateful?
- What?

689
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:46,079
You ought to do something for
the injured party, don't you think?

690
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:47,541
For instance?

691
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:53,295
You should pop into Cartier's and get
your wife a bauble for her wrist.

692
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:58,178
- How about some flowers?
- Is that all the grateful you are?

693
01:13:58,349 --> 01:14:01,350
If I gave her jewelry
not on her birthday...

694
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:05,724
...she'd have 25 private detectives
on me in minutes.

695
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:10,940
- I'd be ashamed to admit it.
- I'll send her a nice box of roses.

696
01:14:11,154 --> 01:14:14,902
- She'll love that.
- She's not used to expensive gifts.

697
01:14:15,116 --> 01:14:18,319
Anything more than flowers
would upset her.

698
01:14:18,494 --> 01:14:21,780
How about something nice
for your daughter?

699
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,079
- What?
- Inherit her again.

700
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,373
That's out of the question.

701
01:14:26,586 --> 01:14:30,963
- It won't cost until you're dead.
- I'd rather not discuss it.

702
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:35,344
What's wrong? Everybody loves
their children, even monkeys.

703
01:14:35,511 --> 01:14:40,968
- It's a law of Mother Nature.
- She never dealt with a gigolo.

704
01:14:41,142 --> 01:14:46,184
- And what were you trying to be?
- The difference should be obvious.

705
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:50,484
- Even to you.
- Would you kindly specify how?

706
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:54,601
I don't care to debate
the question with you.

707
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:59,739
Once you get one foot on the ground,
you're quite a jerk.

708
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,710
Where are we now?

709
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:14,301
- The George Washington Bridge.
- What are we doing over there?

710
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:19,711
I could be recognized. This side
of the river, no one knows me.

711
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:24,885
Another example of the use
of intelligence in this situation.

712
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:04,381
If you've got good old American
know-how, you don't need anything else.

713
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:10,556
The truth is, when the chips are down,
man is the master of his own fate.

714
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,852
The captain of his destiny.

715
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:17,231
- What is it?
- Motorcycle cops.

716
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,161
Are you sure you're not on the lam?

717
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:36,840
- It's all right, keep moving.
- Sorry if I'm going too fast.

718
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,630
You're all right. Just follow me.

719
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:03,197
- Can I ask...?
- It's George Washington Bridge week.

720
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:07,071
The city congratulates
the happy couple...

721
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:11,329
...driving the 50 millionth
car across our edifice.

722
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:14,872
- Hold it!
- Another smile, lady.

723
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:29,217
I'm sorry I can't give you
any more, Mrs. Page.

724
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:32,397
You know what the market is
these days.

725
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:35,229
Thank you again, Mrs. Page.

726
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:43,981
- Hello?
- <i>Miss Page?</i>

727
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,826
Oh, it's you again.

728
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:56,797
You good for seconds?
Let's order now.

729
01:17:57,048 --> 01:18:00,998
- Two more, Mac, well done.
- Slap some chili on it.

730
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,799
- Know the trouble with you?
- Which one?

731
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:07,257
You're a hamburger dame
and won't admit it.

732
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:10,388
Wonder how long it took
to work that out.

733
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:14,513
- I know you better than you do.
- Ketchup?

734
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:20,236
- Coleslaw?
- If I can get it on here.

735
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:23,489
You're not the girl
you pretend to be.

736
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:27,074
That's quite a line
you've got there.

737
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:30,164
- Pickles?
- Thanks.

738
01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:34,710
It's all an act. You know
that money isn't everything.

739
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,128
- Who told you it wasn't?
- Nobody had to.

740
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,374
Did you ever have any?

741
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:45,387
- A little, yes.
- How do you know it isn't everything?

742
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:49,596
Do you believe that money
will bring happiness?

743
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:53,931
- No, but it doesn't depress me.
- I don't believe you.

744
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:58,685
I'm in a jam, understand?
I'm in a bad financial situation.

745
01:18:58,861 --> 01:19:03,190
If the girls don't come back,
I'm on the hook for a year's rent.

746
01:19:03,407 --> 01:19:07,737
So should I fall in love with a guy
who doesn't own a tie?

747
01:19:07,912 --> 01:19:10,948
- Haven't they written?
- They're illiterate.

748
01:19:11,165 --> 01:19:13,323
- But listen...
- It's no use.

749
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:17,706
As soon as I finish this,
I never want to see you again.

750
01:19:22,093 --> 01:19:26,256
- Hello?
- <i>Want to see Miss Liberty today?</i>

751
01:19:26,722 --> 01:19:28,347
Well...

752
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:39,234
I had it once with someone like you,
and that's all I want of that.

753
01:19:39,485 --> 01:19:43,946
Okay. Take a look out there
and give me a rest for a moment.

754
01:19:44,115 --> 01:19:50,153
The truth is, if you're not loaded,
you already got two strikes on you.

755
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:53,829
I said okay.
What else do you want me to say?

756
01:19:54,083 --> 01:19:57,950
As soon as we get off,
I never want to see you again.

757
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,711
- Yes?
- <i>Tonight?</i>

758
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:10,432
No.

759
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:19,604
I mean it. As soon as we get home,
I never want to see...

760
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:34,034
- Sorry we can't give more.
- I already laughed at that.

761
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,117
Thanks again.

762
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,005
May I come in?

763
01:20:51,016 --> 01:20:54,266
- May I change my mind?
- Is this on the level?

764
01:20:54,478 --> 01:20:59,685
- From the bottom of my heart.
- Then hold it for just one second.

765
01:21:03,445 --> 01:21:06,232
Fred? This is Mrs. Page.

766
01:21:06,406 --> 01:21:11,780
Tell that furniture man to bring
that stuff right back up here.

767
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:14,409
Don't even move!

768
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:37,429
Well?

769
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:42,225
Yes.

770
01:22:02,087 --> 01:22:06,832
- Something wrong, Mrs. Page?
- I just feel sort of lonely.

771
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:09,167
- Your friends?
- Yeah.

772
01:22:09,344 --> 01:22:12,760
I wanted those two dingbats
to stand up with me.

773
01:22:12,973 --> 01:22:16,673
- They may come yet.
- I'll throw them out.

774
01:22:16,935 --> 01:22:20,636
I wanted them yesterday.
No time to laugh at them now.

775
01:22:22,524 --> 01:22:26,522
- For crying out loud, a party!
- Wait a minute.

776
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:30,858
- There's Loco!
- Well, hi!

777
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:34,398
- What is it?
- Schatze's wedding.

778
01:22:34,578 --> 01:22:37,283
- Who to?
- Dallas, Texas.

779
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:39,580
Well!

780
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:43,750
- My name's Ding Dong.
- How do you do?

781
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:48,382
- Did you have much trouble?
- Trouble? He's insane about me.

782
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:50,876
- No kidding?
- Out of his mind.

783
01:22:51,137 --> 01:22:53,046
- Know what he's worth?
- What?

784
01:22:53,222 --> 01:22:54,800
- 30 mil.
- He's not!

785
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:57,097
Give or take a mil.

786
01:22:57,852 --> 01:23:02,348
- Isn't that wonderful!
- And he's a perfect doll.

787
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:06,058
- What a break!
- It's a dream marriage.

788
01:23:06,277 --> 01:23:08,815
Where have you been
all this time?

789
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:13,235
- I went back to Maine.
- What do you mean, "went back"?

790
01:23:13,409 --> 01:23:17,537
To tell you the truth,
I got married up there.

791
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:20,706
- Not to that Shriner?
- He was already married.

792
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:23,794
That's what I thought.
Who'd you marry?

793
01:23:24,003 --> 01:23:27,503
Well, he's not anybody in particular.

794
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,843
Just a fellow I met up there.
But I'm absolutely crazy about him.

795
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:38,391
How do you like that?
Both of us at the same time.

796
01:23:38,559 --> 01:23:41,347
- What does he do?
- He's a ranger.

797
01:23:41,604 --> 01:23:42,885
Cattle, you mean?

798
01:23:43,147 --> 01:23:47,525
- No, he's a forest ranger.
- That's not bad.

799
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:51,905
Those trees can be worth
something. How did you meet?

800
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:55,774
I don't mean he owns them,
he just watches them.

801
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:58,443
You mean, just looks at them?

802
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:02,572
He's got a house on the mountain.
He watches for fires.

803
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:04,577
So the trees don't burn.

804
01:24:04,836 --> 01:24:09,711
- How can he make any dough from that?
- He doesn't, much.

805
01:24:09,882 --> 01:24:13,583
- You mean he's a kind of fireman?
- That's it.

806
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:21,888
Thank you.

807
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:23,763
- Mr. Hanley?
- Judge.

808
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:27,349
- You have the license?
- Yes, right here.

809
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:36,238
- Wouldn't you like to meet him?
- Sure. Is he here?

810
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,237
I'll get him.

811
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:53,258
- Hi, Schatze!
- Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!

812
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:57,888
Congratulations! We read about it
on the plane. Just creamy!

813
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,809
- Know how much he's got?
- How much?

814
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,310
- 50 mil. Give or take a mil.
- Brother!

815
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:09,106
- Have you been shopping?
- When they open the doors, I fall in.

816
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:12,655
- What a break!
- Where have you been?

817
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:15,188
- Kansas City.
- For what?

818
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:19,446
- Freddie and I got married there.
- You married that crowbar?

819
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,241
- Why, yes...
- You need a governess.

820
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:25,167
I pegged that guy as a phony.

821
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:30,203
- Not Stewart. I married Freddie.
- Freddie? Who he?

822
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:35,089
It's a little mixed up.
I got on a plane to Kansas City...

823
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:40,088
- What about Atlantic City?
- The plane stopped in Kansas City.

824
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:43,890
I don't want to hear any more.
Tell me one thing.

825
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:45,639
Is he holding or not?

826
01:25:45,896 --> 01:25:50,439
- Well, yes and no.
- Not you too.

827
01:25:50,609 --> 01:25:53,361
He'd be holding if he could get it.

828
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,234
- Say that again.
- He's on the lam.

829
01:25:56,448 --> 01:25:57,611
A thief?

830
01:25:57,783 --> 01:26:02,112
Not a thief. As a matter of fact,
he owns this apartment.

831
01:26:02,288 --> 01:26:05,739
- He gave a tax check...
- Then why's he on the lam?

832
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:10,003
He went to break the guy's neck,
but his glasses fell off.

833
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,962
- Whose glasses?
- Freddie's.

834
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:16,426
- So the guy nearly broke his neck.
- You mean he's blind too?

835
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:19,127
Blinder than me.

836
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:26,884
- Here he is. This is Schatze.
- Congratulations.

837
01:26:27,063 --> 01:26:30,646
- Thank you. And you too. She's okay.
- I think so.

838
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:33,610
- And this is Pola.
- Glad to meet you.

839
01:26:33,778 --> 01:26:36,067
H-Holy Toledo!
- Isn't he cute?

840
01:26:36,323 --> 01:26:38,362
Just a minute.

841
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:43,616
Two more pounds, and she could
be arrested for bigamy.

842
01:26:43,872 --> 01:26:47,704
Mr. Hanley would like to know
if there's a maid of honor.

843
01:26:47,876 --> 01:26:50,367
- If he can find one.
- Can I be it?

844
01:26:50,587 --> 01:26:52,994
Matron is all you can hope for.

845
01:26:53,256 --> 01:26:54,964
- Shall I tell him?
- Take it.

846
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:57,256
Come on, before Pola gets it.

847
01:26:57,469 --> 01:26:59,426
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

848
01:27:01,723 --> 01:27:04,640
It's just Schatze, come on.

849
01:27:05,477 --> 01:27:07,600
- Here he is.
- Hi, Mrs. Page.

850
01:27:07,812 --> 01:27:13,055
- Is that going to be permanent?
- No, he takes it off at night.

851
01:27:13,234 --> 01:27:17,398
I'll get even with him.
I just have to lay low for a while.

852
01:27:17,572 --> 01:27:20,490
We're going underground
after the ceremony.

853
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:23,067
- You don't mind?
- Love it.

854
01:27:23,328 --> 01:27:25,949
Well, congratulations to you too.

855
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:30,868
We'd better get started.
Some of the kids are foaming over.

856
01:27:35,048 --> 01:27:39,591
Okay. Tell him to blow the whistle.

857
01:27:44,849 --> 01:27:48,717
- You're still sure?
- Of course.

858
01:28:19,677 --> 01:28:23,924
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...

859
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,385
Please.

860
01:28:25,641 --> 01:28:30,469
- What's the matter, dear?
- My ankle. Can you take me back?

861
01:28:30,646 --> 01:28:33,137
Yes, of course.

862
01:28:43,075 --> 01:28:47,951
You're too nice to marry someone
who doesn't love you all out.

863
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:52,618
- Was that what it was?
- What else?

864
01:28:54,378 --> 01:28:59,336
I can think of many reasons
why you shouldn't have considered me.

865
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:04,550
- Have I hurt you very bad?
- You have.

866
01:29:04,722 --> 01:29:09,514
- But I'll recover.
- You sound like you already have.

867
01:29:09,685 --> 01:29:14,643
No, that's just one of the
few advantages of age.

868
01:29:14,815 --> 01:29:18,979
Disappointments become
a normal part of life.

869
01:29:19,236 --> 01:29:22,855
But what should I tell the guests?

870
01:29:23,032 --> 01:29:28,821
That Mrs. Page has blown her stack
at last. No one will argue.

871
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,666
You won't talk to Loc and Pola first?

872
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:34,833
- Those bubbleheads.
- Why do you say that?

873
01:29:35,086 --> 01:29:37,755
Did you see what they turned up with?

874
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:42,003
- I saw Loc's forest ranger.
- A fireman for trees.

875
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:45,627
- He seemed nice.
- Did you see what Pola brought?

876
01:29:45,888 --> 01:29:51,131
- No.
- A fugitive. And a blind one at that.

877
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:56,766
Young man?

878
01:29:56,983 --> 01:30:00,601
As far as I could tell,
behind that Halloween getup.

879
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:09,367
- Well, they love them, don't they?
- Drooling, all four.

880
01:30:10,956 --> 01:30:15,285
- And who is your young man?
- What young man?

881
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:19,209
- The one you're in love with.
- Who said I was in love?

882
01:30:19,423 --> 01:30:21,166
I did.

883
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:22,426
Well...

884
01:30:24,303 --> 01:30:29,759
It's a sin and a shame,
but I've got to admit it, I am.

885
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:33,136
- Who is he?
- What does that matter?

886
01:30:33,312 --> 01:30:37,973
It's not unnatural that
I have some curiosity.

887
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:41,316
He's absolutely nothing.

888
01:30:41,528 --> 01:30:44,446
A character straight
from Characterville.

889
01:30:44,614 --> 01:30:47,699
- Is that his name?
- Brookman.

890
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:51,610
- Brookman what?
- Tom Brookman.

891
01:30:51,788 --> 01:30:56,664
- You say he's non-holding?
- One more hamburger would break him.

892
01:30:56,835 --> 01:31:02,174
- What does he do?
- He won't say, but I already know.

893
01:31:02,424 --> 01:31:05,923
- What?
- He's a gas pump jockey.

894
01:31:06,136 --> 01:31:08,129
How do you know?

895
01:31:08,305 --> 01:31:14,723
How do I know how I know?
I can just spot those guys every time.

896
01:31:14,895 --> 01:31:19,640
- I married one once, remember?
- Does he really love you?

897
01:31:19,816 --> 01:31:25,237
- If you hear him tell it, he does.
- What's to stop you marrying him?

898
01:31:25,405 --> 01:31:31,029
Nothing, now. But it's scarcely
what you call progress.

899
01:31:31,203 --> 01:31:33,694
- He's here now, you know.
- Where?

900
01:31:33,956 --> 01:31:35,948
- Out there.
- How do you know?

901
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:39,998
There's a man out there who
looks like a gas pump jockey.

902
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,875
- Has he got on a tie?
- No tie.

903
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:47,288
And at a formal ceremony!
You see what I mean?

904
01:31:47,392 --> 01:31:50,055
<i>De gustibus non est disputandum.</i>

905
01:31:50,263 --> 01:31:52,221
You can say that again.

906
01:31:52,391 --> 01:31:55,178
I said I never wanted
to see him again.

907
01:31:55,435 --> 01:31:59,730
Who does he think he is,
crashing my wedding?

908
01:31:59,941 --> 01:32:01,020
Well...

909
01:32:01,234 --> 01:32:04,934
- Suppose I ask him.
- Just a minute, J.D.

910
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:22,082
- How are you, Tom?
- Okay, I guess. Congratulations.

911
01:32:22,255 --> 01:32:25,838
- Congratulations to you.
- Don't be funny.

912
01:32:26,009 --> 01:32:29,793
- Still the character?
- All she talks about is dough.

913
01:32:30,013 --> 01:32:34,390
If that's all she wants, you can
have her. I don't want her.

914
01:32:34,559 --> 01:32:38,307
That's the way she talks,
but not the way she feels.

915
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:43,598
- I'll bet. What happened there?
- There was a delayed decision.

916
01:32:43,776 --> 01:32:46,446
- In your favor.
- Are you kidding?

917
01:32:46,696 --> 01:32:48,107
Not in the least.

918
01:32:48,323 --> 01:32:51,193
- You told her about me?
- Of course not.

919
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:54,487
So far as she knows,
you hustle a gas pump.

920
01:32:54,662 --> 01:32:56,240
I don't believe it.

921
01:32:56,873 --> 01:32:59,280
- Let's go ask her.
- Wait a minute.

922
01:33:01,085 --> 01:33:04,003
Wait, J.D. Should I tell her now?

923
01:33:04,255 --> 01:33:09,676
Are you crazy? She likes gas pump
jockeys better than millionaires.

924
01:33:09,844 --> 01:33:13,379
What do you want to do?
Disillusion the girl?

925
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:16,047
Mr. Brookman, darling.

926
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:23,599
- A formal wedding, and no tie!
- Listen, will you...?

927
01:33:23,858 --> 01:33:27,192
Everybody's in striped pants and you...

928
01:33:27,362 --> 01:33:31,940
- Listen, Schatze!
- I never want to see you...

929
01:33:33,618 --> 01:33:36,488
How about a cheese dog burger
this time?

930
01:33:36,704 --> 01:33:38,578
That's a good idea.

931
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:41,912
- Two with chili.
- Me too!

932
01:33:42,335 --> 01:33:45,704
After the ceremony, they went
to a greasy spoon...

933
01:33:45,922 --> 01:33:48,758
...where delicious
dog burgers were served.

934
01:33:48,926 --> 01:33:52,758
- What happened to the zillionaires?
- What always happens?

935
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:57,592
I've got no need to worry.
What are you worth in round figures?

936
01:33:57,768 --> 01:34:00,888
About $ 14.00, give or take a nickel.

937
01:34:01,063 --> 01:34:03,898
- And in cash too!
- How about you, killer?

938
01:34:04,066 --> 01:34:09,143
- If I can get my hands on it...
- Yeah, you'll fix it good.

939
01:34:09,405 --> 01:34:14,232
Wait. I want to hear from
Mr. Fill-Her-Up. What's your fortune?

940
01:34:14,451 --> 01:34:16,777
About 200 million, I'd imagine.

941
01:34:16,996 --> 01:34:18,241
Not enough!

942
01:34:18,455 --> 01:34:24,079
- Might that all be in cash?
- I could dig up a couple million.

943
01:34:24,878 --> 01:34:27,548
What might the rest be in?

944
01:34:27,756 --> 01:34:29,665
Some oil.

945
01:34:30,718 --> 01:34:36,258
Some airline stock. A little steel,
some cattle down in Texas.

946
01:34:36,432 --> 01:34:41,674
Coal mines in Alabama, a little
real estate. Automobile stock.

947
01:34:41,854 --> 01:34:45,721
The Brookman Building.
And Brookman, Pennsylvania.

948
01:34:45,899 --> 01:34:49,944
A whole city! I'd love to have
a city named after me!

949
01:34:50,154 --> 01:34:52,727
- Give me the check, Mac.
- Schatze, Idaho.

950
01:34:52,948 --> 01:34:55,735
Yes, and Pola, Illinois, and Loc...

951
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,123
Keep the change, Mac.

952
01:35:13,302 --> 01:35:15,793
Gentlemen.

953
01:35:15,971 --> 01:35:18,047
To our wives.

954
