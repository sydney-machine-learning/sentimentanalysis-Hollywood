1
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,647
<i>This is the Appian Way...</i>

2
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,027
<i>... the most famous road</i>
<i>that leads to Rome...</i>

3
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,605
<i>... as all roads lead to Rome.</i>

4
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:54,576
<i>On this road march</i>
<i>her conquering legions.</i>

5
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,237
<i>Imperial Rome is</i>
<i>the center of the empire...</i>

6
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:00,665
<i>... and undisputed master of the world.</i>

7
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:04,750
<i>But with this power</i>
<i>inevitably comes corruption.</i>

8
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:06,832
<i>No man is sure of his life.</i>

9
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,380
<i>The individual is at the mercy</i>
<i>of the state.</i>

10
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,960
<i>Murder replaces justice.</i>

11
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:16,966
<i>Rulers of conquered nations surrender</i>
<i>their helpless subjects to bondage.</i>

12
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:20,061
<i>High and low alike</i>
<i>become Roman slaves...</i>

13
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,772
<i>... Roman hostages.</i>

14
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,649
<i>There is no escape</i>
<i>from the whip and the sword.</i>

15
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,655
<i>That any force on earth</i>
<i>can shake the foundations...</i>

16
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:32,230
<i>... of this pyramid</i>
<i>of power and corruption...</i>

17
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:37,071
<i>... of human misery and slavery,</i>
<i>seems inconceivable.</i>

18
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:41,494
<i>But 30 years before this day,</i>
<i>a miracle occurred.</i>

19
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:46,911
<i>On a Roman cross in Judea,</i>
<i>a man died to make men free...</i>

20
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,004
<i>... to spread the gospel</i>
<i>of love and redemption.</i>

21
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:55,010
<i>Soon that humble cross is destined</i>
<i>to replace the proud eagles...</i>

22
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:59,131
<i>... that now top</i>
<i>the victorious Roman standards.</i>

23
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:04,019
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of that immortal conflict.</i>

24
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:08,225
<i>In this, the early summer</i>
<i>in the year 64 A. D...</i>

25
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:12,187
<i>... in the reign of the Antichrist</i>
<i>known to history as the Emperor Nero...</i>

26
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:16,315
<i>... the victorious 14th Legion</i>
<i>is on its way back to Rome...</i>

27
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:20,278
<i>... under the command</i>
<i>of one Marcus Vinicius.</i>

28
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:26,037
We can see Rome
from the top of the hill.

29
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,691
Well, there it stands. Rome.

30
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,736
Three years is a long time, eh, Fabius?

31
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:00,366
Yes, Marcus, a long time.

32
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,073
Drusilla and the children.
Tonight I sleep at home.

33
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,701
Man of the family to the bitter end.

34
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,919
It's not sleep I'll be looking for.

35
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:13,668
It seems we've been given an escort.

36
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,919
The least they could do.

37
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:25,058
Hail, in the name of the divine Nero,
prince emperor and supreme pontiff.

38
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,230
Hail.

39
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,562
Captain Flavius,
Praetorian Guard, salutes you.

40
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,604
The news of your brilliant victories
has preceded you to Rome.

41
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:34,020
We're rather anxious to be there.
Lead us in.

42
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm sorry, commander. I have orders.

43
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,193
Imperial orders.

44
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,373
By the body of...

45
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,784
A fine welcome
after a three-year campaign.

46
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,878
We're ordered to pull up and camp here
until notified to enter.

47
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,458
What for? How many days' wait?

48
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:54,126
I know nothing but the orders.

49
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,792
Rome loves her brave warriors.

50
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,250
Give that man 10 lashes.

51
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,632
Fall out!

52
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:03,380
And double it for any more complaints.

53
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,225
Make camp here. Out of the way.

54
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:08,768
- Where to, Marcus?
- To the palace, where else?

55
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,983
Out of the way!

56
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,471
Commander Marcus Vinicius.
I request an audience with the emperor.

57
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,012
I will report immediately, commander.

58
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,973
Commander, sir,
if I might presume, sir...

59
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:51,017
...there's been much discussion
of your unsurpassed victories.

60
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:54,357
- Did you fight the Britons with a mass...?
- We fought with our bowels.

61
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,197
- Try it sometime.
- Yes, commander.

62
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,576
Yes, well, now you have it
as I composed it.

63
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,871
Now, from the beginning.

64
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:14,393
<i>O lambent flames</i>

65
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,841
<i>O force divine</i>

66
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:22,213
<i>O omnivorous powers, hail</i>

67
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:24,630
"Omnivorous."

68
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,053
Omnipotent.

69
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:27,685
Yes.

70
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:32,224
<i>Omnipotent power, hail</i>

71
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
Seneca, don't you think
omnipotent is better?

72
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,016
Far better, Divinity.

73
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:39,025
There's no conviction in your voice.

74
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,273
You disturb me.

75
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:47,031
Petronius, you're my arbiter of elegance.
Which is it?

76
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,154
I find omnipotent most feeble, Divinity.

77
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,412
In fact, puerile.

78
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:55,169
Puerile? Feeble?

79
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:59,088
Omnivorous has
your pure, inspired imagery in it.

80
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:01,382
It is vivid, comprehensive.

81
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:04,886
A genius, Divinity,
should hold to his first thoughts...

82
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:06,800
...on any subject.

83
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:10,758
Petronius. Dear Petronius.

84
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,428
What would I do
without your clear insight into...?

85
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:17,354
You clumsy toad!

86
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:21,394
Isn't the inner agony of my creating
enough without you carving me to bits?

87
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:22,771
Take her away.

88
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:25,784
Oh, where was I? What now?

89
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:29,072
Commander Marcus Vinicius.
He wishes an immediate audience.

90
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,492
Marcus, here?

91
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,290
Vinicius? Who is Marcus Vinicius?

92
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,163
My nephew. Just returned
with his legions from Britain.

93
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:38,041
Oh, yes. Bid him enter.

94
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:41,418
There seems to be
a disregard for orders here.

95
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:44,000
You sent word to Vinicius
to remain outside the city.

96
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,429
So I did. That's true, Tigellinus.

97
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,307
Does this nephew of yours consider...

98
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,931
...that his conquests give him
a right to override...?

99
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:55,971
I cannot believe that he entered with his
army, Divinity, knowing Marcus as I do.

100
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,984
Doubtless he has come
to make obeisance and pay homage...

101
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:02,236
...to his emperor and his god in private.

102
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:07,023
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

103
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:10,737
I fear that a natural humility
often blinds me.

104
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:11,914
Yes.

105
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,493
Hail Nero, emperor.

106
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:19,084
Commander, hail. Come forward.

107
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:24,542
Your proud uncle has been explaining
the impetuosity of your devotion to me.

108
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,637
It's a joy to be such an inspiration
to my commanders.

109
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:30,427
My loyalty and my life always, Caesar.

110
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,260
My men have been away a long time.

111
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:34,475
They have fought and died
for their emperor.

112
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:37,600
They have gladly accepted
weeks of forced marches to reach home.

113
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:40,526
They're anxious to see their families,
their women.

114
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:42,603
Just as you said, Petronius.

115
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,187
Such loyalty, such devotion.

116
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,737
You see, the delay
in my men reaching their homes...

117
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,534
...it's a question of morale.

118
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:51,407
Didn't you explain in...?

119
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,153
Maybe good Tigellinus
left the reason out of his orders.

120
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:57,002
- An oversight...
- Reasons are not given in imperial orders.

121
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:00,004
Oh, Tigellinus, how boorish.

122
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:02,081
How ungrateful.

123
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,380
We desire that you wait
until you are joined...

124
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:08,216
...by the legions from Africa and Asia,
which should be a matter of hours.

125
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,464
Tomorrow you will enter Rome
in triumph.

126
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,890
More and more the people
need diversion these...

127
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,018
Or rather, shall we say
that this too is a question of morale?

128
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,888
They demand a spectacle.

129
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,566
A look at heroes.
Bear with me in this, dear commander.

130
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:27,986
- It is now clear to me, emperor.
- Divinity, may I retire with my nephew?

131
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:29,616
We have much to talk over.

132
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:30,827
Naturally.

133
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:34,078
I shall expect you at the feast
after the triumph, Vinicius.

134
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,738
We shall try to make it diverting.

135
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,752
An added honor, emperor.

136
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,873
Now, again.

137
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:50,049
No arms missing? No legs?

138
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:53,507
No. I picked up a good healthy slash
in the side here.

139
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,470
- You seem to be faring well, uncle.
- Oh, indestructible.

140
00:12:56,645 --> 00:13:00,014
You're gonna spend time with me
before rushing to your estates in Sicily?

141
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,348
I intend a full month's relaxation
in Rome.

142
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:05,562
And as I remember,
your house is the best place for it.

143
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:09,438
Marcus, I've recently purchased
several new delectable slaves.

144
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,905
There's one from Spain. Skin like cream.

145
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:15,659
Hair with the sheen of a young raven.
She's yours.

146
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,740
- I might stay two months.
- Hmm.

147
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,917
Tonight I've arranged for you
to stay at Plautius' country place.

148
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:22,128
It's near your camp.

149
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:24,620
Aulus Plautius, the old retired general?

150
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,078
That's a gloomy outlook.

151
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:29,461
I know. And his wife's not young either,
besides being virtuous.

152
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,510
Still, it's better quarters than a tent.

153
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,391
Body of Bacchus,
I've been listening to that since noon.

154
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:39,766
He seems in rare voice.

155
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:44,316
Is it true what I heard while I was gone,
that he murdered his wife and mother?

156
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:47,900
My dear boy, you must learn
the language of privileged government.

157
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,072
Let us rather say that poor Agrippina
and Octavia were removed...

158
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:52,652
...for the good of the empire.

159
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,818
The new wife, Poppaea,
sounds interesting.

160
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,323
A harlot for an empress.

161
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,033
My dear commander,
what a proletarian observation.

162
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,791
You must realize that a woman has
no past when she mates with a god.

163
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:06,961
Well, he's our emperor.

164
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,919
There are some in the senate
who are not so pleased with him.

165
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,418
They would like to replace Nero
with General Galba.

166
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:13,840
I know nothing of politics.

167
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,220
Just as long as there's money
to pay the army...

168
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,467
...Rome will stand forever,
that I'm sure of.

169
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:39,286
I bid you welcome, Marcus Vinicius.

170
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:40,498
I salute the general.

171
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:43,785
We traveled the splendid roads you built
in Britain and Gaul.

172
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,668
My wife, the Lady Pomponia.

173
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,043
Our house is honored
to have you as guest.

174
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:50,290
My tribune, Fabius Nerva.

175
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:53,005
These young men
must wish to wash and change.

176
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,716
The baths are ready.
Will you show them, my dear?

177
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,003
This way, commander.

178
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:59,673
Dinner is at the 9th hour.

179
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,347
You're expecting other guests
this evening, general?

180
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,147
We're not intruding
on any festivities, I hope.

181
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,736
Oh, no. We live a quiet life here.

182
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:26,080
"Oh, no. We live a quiet life here."

183
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:30,085
Here we are, transforming ourselves
into sweet-smelling flowers...

184
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:31,944
...only to bloom in a hay field.
- Ha-ha.

185
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,048
You know, Marcus,
Drusilla last sent word...

186
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,924
...that the oldest boy
is almost as tall as she is now.

187
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,469
When I left,
I carried him around on my shoulder.

188
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:42,262
That little slave from Spain
Petronius told me about...

189
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,013
...I'll let her sit on mine.

190
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,682
Speaking of things that grow,
cast your eye on this one.

191
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,071
For your bath.

192
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:58,285
Stand up, fellow.

193
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:03,330
Body of... What a prospect.

194
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:06,582
What's going on in the arena these days?
Is Croton still champion?

195
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,210
I do not know.

196
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:12,082
General Plautius never thought
of having you trained as a gladiator?

197
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:14,249
He'd win enough gold
to fill your sandals.

198
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:17,046
I do not fight.

199
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,631
You don't fight?

200
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,806
Why, with one arm strapped,
you could kill 50 Nubians an hour.

201
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,892
I'll speak to your master about you.
I can make you a champion.

202
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,268
It is a sin to kill.

203
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:33,225
Half-witted.

204
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:36,439
Grew so fast,
his brain hit the top of the stable.

205
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:10,981
Behold, she stands
with her gown hung loose.

206
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,184
Framed is her face in golden tresses...

207
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:16,816
...reflecting the milk-white beauty
of her shoulders.

208
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:21,652
So it was that Venus stood before Mars,
welcoming her lover.

209
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:26,537
Nothing do I see that is not perfection.

210
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,246
You're in service to this household,
I take it?

211
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,581
Very much so.

212
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,959
- Your name?
- Lygia.

213
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,665
Lygia. Lygia, you're a windfall.

214
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:41,377
I shall sacrifice a dozen white doves
to Venus to commemorate our meeting.

215
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,053
Your sacrifice
will be in vain, commander.

216
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:49,471
By the gods, the old general
must know a good slave market.

217
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:53,062
Not only beauty, but spirit as well.

218
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,854
There are no slaves in this household.

219
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,899
The old general, as you call him...

220
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:03,691
...well, I have the honor
and the joy to be his daughter.

221
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,318
I crave your pardon.

222
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:11,412
Three years in the field
have dulled my perceptions.

223
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,744
Truly, I'm sorry, Lygia.
Will you forgive me?

224
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:17,879
You've done nothing
to ask forgiveness for.

225
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,963
For a long time,
the only women I've seen or known...

226
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:24,090
...have been poor, dull barbarians,
very uninspiring.

227
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:25,343
Barbarians?

228
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:28,551
I've heard the women of Britain and Gaul
are most beautiful.

229
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,185
Lygia, I'm forced to tell you...

230
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:33,188
...that the women of Britain
cover themselves with deer fat.

231
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:36,393
I'd say that was
an understandable desire to be warm.

232
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:40,316
The warmth is not transferable,
I assure you. Only in its aroma.

233
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:43,569
And as for the women of Gaul...

234
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:47,360
...well, their hair is like
the frazzled ends of rope.

235
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:51,827
Not a soft, red-gold crown
with stars in it.

236
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,460
And their palm was
the hide of a wild boar.

237
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:58,795
- Not like this soft...
- At least that proves they are diligent.

238
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:01,088
Yes, at building mud huts.

239
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,584
But not in bringing
a man's thoughts to life.

240
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:06,461
I'm not sorry at all.

241
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:11,144
- Sorry?
- That Petronius arranged my stay here.

242
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:17,806
If things go as fate surely meant,
the man should be decorated.

243
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:23,986
If you will excuse me,
I must decorate the table.

244
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:35,328
And so you see, sir,
you can understand my problem.

245
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:36,913
We were outnumbered at least...

246
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,708
- Well, wouldn't you say three to one?
- Easily.

247
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:44,508
I drew up the spearmen in a formation
much like the Macedonian phalanx.

248
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,587
Let me tell you, your barbarous Briton...

249
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:49,005
...is as worthy an opponent
as I've ever engaged.

250
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:52,183
They impaled themselves on the
spearheads like meat to the spit.

251
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,925
We were standing ankle deep
in their blood.

252
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,517
Can you understand the strategy, Lygia?
Can you see it?

253
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:02,776
I can only see the awful necessity
of defending one's home.

254
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:04,191
Defending?

255
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,689
They were in revolt against Rome.

256
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:09,702
But as I say, I credit courage.

257
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:14,033
A general's daughter can understand it
gives no pleasure to overcome weaklings.

258
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,502
The battle loses its zest.

259
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:19,877
Right, general?

260
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:24,625
- I find I've outgrown that zest.
- Don't be modest, general.

261
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:29,133
Look here, you don't seem to be excited
by the glorious exploits of your legions.

262
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:31,382
That's an odd attitude
for a woman of Rome.

263
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:34,134
I am not a Roman, I am a Lygian.

264
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:36,884
A Lygian? I thought, uh...

265
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:39,305
She's our adopted daughter.

266
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:42,898
Oh, I see. Lygian, Lygia.

267
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:46,569
She was named Callina,
but she prefers to be called Lygia.

268
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,488
As a child, she was taken prisoner
during my campaign in Lygia.

269
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,827
- A slave, then.
- No, no. Her father was king of Lygia.

270
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:55,906
She was assigned to me as a hostage.

271
00:20:56,082 --> 00:21:01,456
We've tried to erase the wrong done her
with the love we have for her.

272
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:04,414
You should envy me such love,
commander.

273
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:08,588
Lygia, I envy the roof that covers you.

274
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:10,885
This one or any future.

275
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,219
May a traveler interrupt
with his greetings?

276
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:20,349
- Paul.
- Paul, you're here.

277
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:24,023
- We've been counting the days.
- Pomponia. Lygia, dear.

278
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:27,942
One need not pray that peace be with
this house. It's written in your faces.

279
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:29,739
Paul, our two guests.

280
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:33,028
Tribune Fabius Nerva
and Commander Marcus Vinicius.

281
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:35,610
You must have seen their army
camped along the road.

282
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:36,831
Ah, yes.

283
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:42,075
- Gentlemen, our friend Paul of Tarsus.
- Our very dear friend.

284
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:45,457
- You mustn't let me interrupt your meal.
- We've done with it.

285
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:48,253
Come, let's sit in here.

286
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,969
Commander?

287
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:57,515
You must be tired, Paul.
Will you have food? A cup of wine?

288
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:00,307
No, thank you, my dear.
I supped along the way.

289
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,351
And the rigors of travel
always fall away rapidly here.

290
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,276
I take it, like us, you've just returned
from a journey.

291
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:09,149
Oh, yes. Antioch, Corinth.

292
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:10,698
Oh.

293
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:15,279
- You're Greek.
- No, I'm a Jew.

294
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:18,822
A citizen of Rome,
though I was born in Tarsus.

295
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:21,406
Oh, yes, Tarsus. North of Palestine.

296
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:23,127
That's correct.

297
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:25,536
You come from a troublesome
part of the world.

298
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:28,121
Much unrest down there in the past.

299
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,419
- You're a merchant of some sort?
- No, I'm a rabbi.

300
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:35,885
Well, I'm just a heavy-skulled soldier.
What in the name of Jupiter is a rabbi?

301
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,643
- I...
- Paul is a teacher.

302
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,600
Oh, what do you teach?

303
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:46,233
He teaches...

304
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:49,355
- He teaches philosophy.
- Yes.

305
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:53,109
Yes, I suppose you'd call it that.

306
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:56,533
Did you know that all this time,
I've been teaching you philosophy?

307
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,660
I don't know
a great deal about philosophy.

308
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,697
And lovely women shouldn't have the time
to think that deeply.

309
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:06,327
As for me, Lygia, would you ever think
that I was fond of flowers?

310
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:08,378
I should like to see the garden.

311
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:11,335
You have the evening tour of the camp
to make, commander.

312
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:14,047
You must see to the disposition
of the men.

313
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,175
Will you excuse me?

314
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:25,019
I shall be back early.
In time for the flowers, I hope.

315
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:38,824
And now tell us the things
we've been waiting to hear.

316
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:41,913
- Did you see Peter?
- Yes, how is our big fisherman?

317
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,205
I missed him all along the way.

318
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:47,163
Wherever I went,
Peter had been there before me.

319
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:50,042
At Antioch,
they said he'd gone on to Jerusalem.

320
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:53,085
Others said that he'd set out
for Persia and the East.

321
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,213
Finally, in Corinth,
I learned he was on his way here...

322
00:23:56,388 --> 00:23:58,546
...and that he would come to us
any day now.

323
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:01,973
Peter? In Rome? Magnificent.

324
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:03,851
All of us.

325
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,433
To be able to speak with a man
who talked with Christ, our Lord.

326
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:11,479
I saw results of seeds Peter has planted.

327
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:14,322
Green shoots are sprouting.
There will be a good harvest.

328
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:17,940
Everywhere, strangers approached
and drew the sign of the fish before me.

329
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,948
And we spoke of the great work ahead.

330
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:23,742
The work is difficult
and dangerous now, Paul.

331
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:26,916
Ever since you were tried here,
even though you were acquitted...

332
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,243
...Christians
are under constant suspicion.

333
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:32,624
I noticed you seemed worried
in the presence of your two guests.

334
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,753
Believe me,
I would have exercised caution.

335
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:40,388
Though at times, I admit the desire
to cry the message aloud.

336
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:45,978
But I suppose tactics must be applied
even in the spreading of love and faith.

337
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:48,767
Be patient, Paul. Your time will come.

338
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,104
Those two vital young men, for instance.
They are Rome.

339
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,228
If we could teach them,
we could teach the world.

340
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:02,450
Marcus Vinicius?

341
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:05,618
You are asking for miracles.

342
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,790
I am.

343
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:10,290
I am, indeed.

344
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:49,037
There is still nothing I see
that is not perfection.

345
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:54,709
However, if you're thinking of me,
as you undoubtedly were...

346
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:57,337
...do I look that much like a fish?

347
00:25:57,717 --> 00:25:58,717
Oh.

348
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:03,968
It wasn't anything to do with you.

349
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:10,726
You're too lovely
to be a lonely artist, Lygia.

350
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:13,388
But then, I did ask you to wait up for me.

351
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:17,695
- It was merely that I couldn't sleep.
- Nor can I.

352
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:20,819
I'll tell you what, Lygia.
The night's still young.

353
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:25,071
This place is unworthy of our first
meeting. Let's go to Petronius' house.

354
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:27,570
There will be gaiety there
you've never dreamed of.

355
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,203
Dancers, musicians, singers.
The best in Rome.

356
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,744
My uncle's house was built
by the goddess of love herself.

357
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,542
No. No, it's too late, I...

358
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:38,423
I mean, it's impossible.

359
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:41,758
Well, we could plan it
more discreetly, perhaps.

360
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:45,214
What about tomorrow?
You'll come see my triumph, won't you?

361
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,059
Tomorrow, there will be
a feast to tempt all the gods.

362
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:52,224
No. No, I don't wish
to watch your triumph.

363
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:54,722
I must go in now.
Good night, commander.

364
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:56,442
Tell me.

365
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,602
- What is it?
- What?

366
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:01,352
What is it you see that you don't like?

367
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:06,240
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't attracted
by what I see, Marcus Vinicius.

368
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:10,195
- Well, then...
- It's what I hear I don't like.

369
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:14,536
You see, a man's fame
always brings him fresh enemies.

370
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:19,254
- Who's been telling you stories about me?
- You have, from your own lips.

371
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,378
Ugly stories
of conquests and bloodshed.

372
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:24,461
Conquest? But what's conquest?

373
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:27,592
Only method of uniting
and civilizing the world under one power.

374
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,758
- Have to spill a little blood to do it.
- No.

375
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:33,138
There's a gentler
and more powerful way of doing that.

376
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:35,389
Without bloodshed and war.

377
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:39,894
Without slaves and captives bound
in chains to your triumphal chariots.

378
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,311
There will always be slaves.
Who will do the work?

379
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:45,940
Paul speaks of a world
where there would be no slaves.

380
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,576
That beggar-faced philosopher...

381
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:51,243
...shouldn't be stuffing your
luscious little head with such nonsense.

382
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,744
How could I expect you to understand?

383
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,291
I wish you were a slave,
as I first thought.

384
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:01,334
I'd offer a price for you.
King's ransom for a king's daughter.

385
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:04,213
And taken me to your estates in Sicily
with all the others?

386
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:05,844
On a special ship.

387
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:08,420
What a way for a conqueror
to win a woman.

388
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:11,967
To buy her like an unresisting beast.

389
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:15,678
What false security you must have
in your heart and soul.

390
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:19,141
In your manhood, Marcus Vinicius.

391
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:22,769
What hidden scorn
you must have for yourself.

392
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:26,611
You're forgetting
you're a hostage of Rome, aren't you?

393
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:33,198
Here, you, hostage, come back here.

394
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:35,946
- No, commander.
- Out of my way.

395
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,371
I guard her, commander.

396
00:28:37,544 --> 00:28:40,082
By whose orders? Who are you?

397
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:43,920
I am Ursus.
I guarded the king, her father.

398
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,337
I guard her now.

399
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:52,220
Guard her well, my gray-haired colossus.

400
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,301
Guard her well.

401
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:06,227
Romance seems to have been
short-lived.

402
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:11,947
There's always a weapon
to bring down a flighty dove, my friend.

403
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:20,242
And please, dear Lord,
forgive me my anger and my spite.

404
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:23,881
I do not know what came over me.

405
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,759
It was temptation, perhaps.

406
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:31,925
A selfish desire
that this man might see your light.

407
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:34,850
For my sake rather than for his.

408
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:40,895
And yet I pray that one day,
he shall feel the joy of your love.

409
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,604
I pray with all my heart.

410
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,901
Captain, what's the delay here?

411
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:31,278
The emperor has not yet appeared
on the balcony.

412
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:34,154
You will hear the trumpets, commander.

413
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,297
Gods of Rome.

414
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:52,869
Mighty.

415
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:55,113
Eternal.

416
00:30:55,473 --> 00:31:01,179
Beneath whose auspices,
Rome rules the world.

417
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:02,932
Hear us.

418
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:05,146
We worship you.

419
00:31:05,317 --> 00:31:07,025
We worship you.

420
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:09,445
Venus...

421
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:11,190
...goddess of love.

422
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:13,564
We worship.

423
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:17,392
Mars, god of war.

424
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:19,328
We worship.

425
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:23,116
Juno, goddess of heaven.

426
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,451
We worship.

427
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:29,080
Jupiter, father of the gods.

428
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,457
We worship.

429
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:35,585
And Nero, his divine son.

430
00:31:44,731 --> 00:31:47,732
They are impatient, Divinity.
They hunger to see you.

431
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,653
They're impatient?
What about my patience?

432
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:54,404
Oho. A triumph to divert them?
Who diverts me?

433
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:58,738
I slave, I agonize for them.
I have no privacy.

434
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:02,245
You are the sun in their heavens.
Does the sun have privacy?

435
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:06,745
The sun has the night.
They expect me to shine daily, hourly.

436
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,078
And for whom? For the people.

437
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:12,459
For that foul-smelling rabble.

438
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,677
It's so hot today.

439
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:18,379
This heat of Rome oppresses me.
It stifles me.

440
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:23,515
They demand too much.
I tell you, this mob, this mob tortures me.

441
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,893
I hate it second only to Rome itself.

442
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:30,941
The foul breath of that mob
floats in my house.

443
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,269
In my garden.

444
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:35,914
I wish...

445
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,230
Oh, I wish...

446
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:40,493
Your wish, Caesar.
Tell me, that I may execute it.

447
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:45,288
I wish it had but a single throat,
that mob, that I might cut it.

448
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,784
It could be done
if your wish were a command.

449
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,037
A typical butcher's solution.

450
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:53,630
Tigellinus would deprive you
of the one thing an artist must have:

451
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,089
- His audience.
- But they irk me, those people.

452
00:32:56,261 --> 00:32:57,375
They irk me.

453
00:32:57,554 --> 00:32:59,760
Do I live for them or do they live for me?

454
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:04,095
Unfortunately, Caesar, as a ruler,
you must have subjects to rule.

455
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:06,475
Sheer population is a necessary evil.

456
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:09,316
It is easy for Petronius to talk,
but the burden is on you.

457
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:13,892
On the only shoulders in the world
strong enough to bear it.

458
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:17,318
That's true, isn't it, Petronius?

459
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,818
It's lonely to be an emperor.

460
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:23,070
It is lonelier still to be a genius.

461
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:28,875
You're the only one who understands
the complications of my tortured nature.

462
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:31,416
Is that not a theme for a poem,
Petronius?

463
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:33,995
It is a theme for an epic, Divinity.

464
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:37,377
But to write it, you must suffer it.

465
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:42,264
Yes.

466
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,019
Where is Poppaea?
Where is my empress?

467
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:49,725
Here, lord. Always at your side.

468
00:33:49,898 --> 00:33:51,855
Come. Petronius, you were right.

469
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:57,193
I must feel it, know it, live it.

470
00:33:57,364 --> 00:33:59,440
Come, Petronius, attend me closely.

471
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:02,736
Attend me closely in my ordeal.

472
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,881
Hail Nero, son of Jupiter.

473
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:28,217
Look at him, my darling, the emperor.

474
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:31,479
- Wife killer. Mother killer.
- Quiet, woman, you'll have us all...

475
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:34,221
Everybody knows it. He's a beast.

476
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,601
Quiet.

477
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:38,810
No man is a beast.

478
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,230
Look at him
and know that he is but sick.

479
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:45,820
Sick in heart and spirit, in his soul.

480
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:51,489
You were right, Petronius.
How they love me.

481
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,826
How, indeed.

482
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,811
Remember, thou art only a man.

483
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,711
Remember, thou art only a man.

484
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,698
Marcus Vinicius.

485
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:42,795
Isn't he the one
who came to see Nero yesterday?

486
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:45,586
An arrogant man. He bears watching.

487
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,922
From what I hear, he might bear
watching at much closer range.

488
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,801
Poppaea, what are you muttering about?
Ha-ha.

489
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,801
Come closer.

490
00:37:55,435 --> 00:38:01,271
Look, they march as they fight.
Strong, brave, relentless.

491
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:03,897
Our unconquerable children.

492
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:06,904
We must take them to our breast.

493
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:09,444
Yes, my lord.

494
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,458
Well.

495
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:22,460
The hero at last.

496
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:25,665
You know, Marcus, usually one
is embarrassed by one's relatives...

497
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,335
...but today I was proud of you.

498
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,382
Hot work in that sun. A hippodrome.

499
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:32,222
The emperor positively adores you.

500
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:34,844
He called you his brave, relentless child.

501
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:40,637
If you play your hand well, you can have
a military governorship. Egypt, perhaps.

502
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:46,231
Sit down.
Relax before you take your bath.

503
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,855
Oh, very well.

504
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,115
And taste this.
Straight from the vines of Olympus.

505
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:55,984
Your Sicilian vintages
will pale to nothing.

506
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,161
- Well?
- What's the law regarding hostages?

507
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,824
Hostages?

508
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:04,996
Can they be bought, reassigned, what?

509
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,500
Well...

510
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,798
I take it this hostage is female?

511
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,673
Head to toe, hip to hip. What's the law?

512
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:15,716
When you see what I have for you,
you'll think of nothing else.

513
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,933
Now, this is the...

514
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:20,010
Well, here she is.

515
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,104
Bring her here.

516
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,729
Your exquisite wildflower
from the hills of Spain, Marcus.

517
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,905
- What's her name? I've forgotten.
- You called me Eunice, my lord.

518
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,154
Silence.

519
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:35,946
Oh, yes.

520
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,519
Eunice.

521
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:40,695
Lift your chin, Eunice.

522
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:46,253
Did you ever see such skin, Marcus?

523
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:48,994
Turn around, slowly.

524
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:54,049
Flawless proportions.

525
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:57,049
Fold your arms behind your head.

526
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,806
Makes one wish one were a sculptor.

527
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,380
Lovely.

528
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:08,317
Enough of my collector's enthusiasm.
She's the commander's.

529
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:10,228
Take her to his apartment.

530
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:12,065
I won't go.

531
00:40:12,238 --> 00:40:13,898
What did you say?

532
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:15,484
Don't give me away, my lord.

533
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:18,576
Whip me, beat me,
but don't send me from here.

534
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:21,034
Don't send me from you, my lord.

535
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:23,163
You can stay here, girl. I don't want you.

536
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,613
You don't want her?

537
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:28,209
And I refused an offer from Seneca
of six Arabian stallions.

538
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,918
Keep her, Petronius. She's yours.

539
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,332
Well, by the body of Juno.

540
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:36,423
Nevertheless,
give her five lashes for impertinence.

541
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:38,221
You won't give me away, then, lord?

542
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,098
That depends on your future conduct.

543
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,840
Oh, yes. Yes, my good lord.

544
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:47,386
Ply the lash carefully, now.

545
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:48,764
Don't damage her skin.

546
00:40:48,942 --> 00:40:50,769
No, master.

547
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:55,312
Tell me, now.
Can one purchase a hostage?

548
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:58,029
Where is this precious gem?

549
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:00,609
At Plautius' place. You should see her.

550
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,910
A fiery young Lygian.
She throws flames at you.

551
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:04,872
A Lygian?

552
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,625
Yes, I do recall a child assigned to him.

553
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:10,752
It was some years ago, I'd forgotten.

554
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:12,749
How can I get my hands on her?

555
00:41:12,924 --> 00:41:16,174
Hostages are wards of the state.
She belongs to Nero.

556
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:18,384
Perfect. He would give me Egypt?

557
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:21,472
He can keep Egypt and give me Lygia.
We'll go to the palace.

558
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:26,138
Plautius may not be in accord with this.

559
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:28,020
Well, she will be.

560
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:30,894
They've sentimentalized her
into an adopted daughter.

561
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:33,819
Philosophers, teachers, fools.

562
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:36,525
This one wasn't born to think,
she was born to feel.

563
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:42,321
But, Marcus, with Plautius regarding her
as his daughter, I mean, is this ethical?

564
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:44,453
After all, he was a general of the empire.

565
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,829
I'll have her if I have to abduct her.

566
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:50,374
I sense a certain frustration.

567
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:53,665
Is your little barbarian
entirely in sympathy with your plan?

568
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,592
She'll be cooing like a pigeon
in the right circumstances.

569
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,883
I wish I had your confidence.

570
00:42:00,055 --> 00:42:04,598
I've never been able to discover
an honest warmth in any woman.

571
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,084
Oh, my dear, beautiful lord.

572
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:33,079
I love you so.

573
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:36,873
Please, how can I let you know?

574
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:54,858
Open.

575
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:56,562
Open in the name of the emperor.

576
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,199
I have an order from the emperor.

577
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,912
- Yes?
- For the hostage, Lygia.

578
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,200
My orders are to take her
to the women's quarters in the palace.

579
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,538
She's not a slave.

580
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,908
She is our daughter.

581
00:43:13,086 --> 00:43:15,755
My orders are to take her at once.

582
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,110
Wait here.

583
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:04,470
You are the hostage, Lygia?

584
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:06,305
Yes.

585
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:10,094
Welcome to Nero's house of women.

586
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:12,391
My name is Acte, I am in charge here.

587
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:14,721
May I ask why I am here?

588
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:17,858
I would say you have attracted
the attention of the emperor.

589
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:19,900
And you have been commanded
to the feast.

590
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,694
But the emperor has never seen me.

591
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:23,523
There must be some other reason.

592
00:44:23,698 --> 00:44:28,325
Nero ordered you brought here, just as
I was brought here seven years ago.

593
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:30,950
He loved me then, more than he knew.

594
00:44:31,122 --> 00:44:33,993
Prepare the bath, oil of lilies.

595
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:37,618
And bring me the beaded cloth
from Persia, mostly blues, I think.

596
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:40,915
And, yes,
the strand of fine gold at the waist.

597
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:47,551
I am not honored by this.

598
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:51,091
You were brought up in the home
of Plautius and Pomponia, weren't you?

599
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:53,307
Yes. Yes, do you know them?

600
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:54,676
I know of them.

601
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:58,021
- Lygia, child, listen to me.
- Yes, yes, yes, chatter, chatter, chatter.

602
00:44:58,191 --> 00:45:00,397
You'd think each one
had the hair of a queen.

603
00:45:00,568 --> 00:45:04,020
Well, this one has possibilities at least.

604
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:07,857
What were you going to tell me?

605
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:11,989
Simply that you are the chosen guest
of Nero.

606
00:45:12,163 --> 00:45:14,619
You are in the hands
of the master of the world.

607
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:19,418
You will have to consider that
your good fortune and your fate.

608
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:36,976
The hostage, Lygia.

609
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,314
Aren't you coming?

610
00:45:40,483 --> 00:45:43,021
The emperor did not ask me.

611
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:20,143
She needed a poet, not a soldier,
to describe her.

612
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:22,770
Everything's there but the smile.

613
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,518
I leave that to you.

614
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:27,945
Petronius is quite right.

615
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:29,443
I wish I were a poet.

616
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:33,619
But I had you escorted here
in great honor.

617
00:46:33,787 --> 00:46:35,910
I deserve a smile for that.

618
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:37,872
It was gracious of you.

619
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:42,335
Ten big, strong Praetorian Guards
to support my eagerness to come.

620
00:46:42,504 --> 00:46:44,081
Well said, Lygia.

621
00:46:44,255 --> 00:46:48,384
But you know a caravan of rare
merchandise is always well-guarded.

622
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:49,927
And you belong here, Lygia.

623
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:53,170
A king's daughter in a royal palace.

624
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:56,468
That's something
you should have a natural appetite for.

625
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:00,646
And I can tell you,
you have other natural appetites too.

626
00:47:00,814 --> 00:47:03,387
Hasn't old Dull-Beard,
your philosopher friend, Paul...

627
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:05,524
...told you about those?

628
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:09,153
Or has he lived in a cave all his life?

629
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:12,443
You should have seen my triumph today.
It was quite a display.

630
00:47:12,617 --> 00:47:16,994
I looked for you, but then, I imagine
they had you chained to a peach tree.

631
00:47:17,497 --> 00:47:21,411
Here. The panacea for all reticence.

632
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:25,831
You're right.

633
00:47:26,006 --> 00:47:28,497
Your mouth has its own sweetness.

634
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:31,000
I know I'll find it so.

635
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:33,338
Don't look so frightened, Lygia.

636
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:36,004
I'm no heartless,
unfeeling machine of war.

637
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:39,349
I won't rush upon you
like a boulder from a catapult.

638
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,390
You've only to relax, smile a little,
and before you know it...

639
00:47:42,564 --> 00:47:46,431
I can think of nothing, pray for nothing
but that this is over soon...

640
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,982
...so that you can send me home again.

641
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:50,154
Home?

642
00:47:50,947 --> 00:47:51,947
Yes.

643
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,458
Hail Nero.

644
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:07,378
Hail Nero.

645
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,508
Hail Nero.

646
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:22,843
Have you ever seen your emperor
and your god this close before?

647
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,607
No, I have never seen Nero
this close before.

648
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:56,047
Same faces.

649
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:58,260
Same noses.

650
00:48:58,431 --> 00:49:00,431
All green.

651
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:04,599
Just for variety, divine lord, try a ruby.

652
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,158
Is that the hostage I brought
for Vinicius?

653
00:49:27,794 --> 00:49:29,834
Oh, yes, yes, Divinity.

654
00:49:30,005 --> 00:49:31,047
Mm, Vinicius has an eye.

655
00:49:31,214 --> 00:49:32,377
She's exquisite.

656
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:34,246
You are generous, lord.

657
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:36,667
Perhaps you've overlooked something
for yourself.

658
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:37,845
Yes.

659
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,511
What do you think, Petronius?

660
00:49:40,682 --> 00:49:42,224
Put a dress on an olive stump...

661
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:45,144
...and my poor, untutored nephew
would call it beautiful.

662
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:47,553
I know your incomparable judgment,
Divinity.

663
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:50,482
And I'll wager you've already decided,
even from here...

664
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,817
...that she is too narrow in the hips.

665
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:57,488
Yes, yes, that's exactly what I think.

666
00:49:57,657 --> 00:49:59,982
Dear Poppaea,
one woman should never judge another.

667
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,326
She hasn't the glands for it. Ha-ha-ha.

668
00:50:03,496 --> 00:50:04,907
Isn't that witty, Petronius?

669
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,453
Among the gods, your humor is unique.

670
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:10,209
Dear Petronius.

671
00:50:10,378 --> 00:50:11,978
Oh, yes.

672
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:14,497
Too narrow in the hip.

673
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,095
Sing for us, Divinity, sing for us.

674
00:50:28,688 --> 00:50:30,064
Sing for us, sing for us.

675
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:33,517
I had almost come to a tragic decision.

676
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:37,311
I had decided
not to sing for you tonight.

677
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:39,031
We beseech thee.

678
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:40,990
My throat hurts.

679
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:44,742
And when one has been given a divine
gift, one should not jeopardize it.

680
00:50:44,913 --> 00:50:47,997
But I am not the only one afflicted.

681
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,574
My empress has a headache.

682
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:53,041
And the only thing
which will bring her relief...

683
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:54,588
...is the sound of my voice.

684
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:59,003
You promised to sing,
or I would not be here.

685
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:01,011
I'm totally unprepared.

686
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,764
So I must compose as I sing.

687
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:11,744
Bravo.

688
00:52:15,795 --> 00:52:18,168
You must be content with that.

689
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:20,458
My throat.

690
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:38,104
Watch Croton.
He's killed over 300 opponents.

691
00:52:38,276 --> 00:52:41,562
He could twist the head off your Ursus
before he knew what touched him.

692
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:45,897
Orpheus at this moment must be as
yellow with envy as our poet Lucan.

693
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:49,077
I am as a candle next to the sun.

694
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:52,499
And you, Petronius, what do you say?

695
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:58,004
I say that your verses are common
and fit only for the fire they celebrate.

696
00:52:58,546 --> 00:53:00,290
Farewell, Petronius.

697
00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:02,508
What defect do you find in them?

698
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:06,175
Well, your verses would be worthy
of Ovid, of Virgil, even of Homer.

699
00:53:06,346 --> 00:53:07,840
But they are not worthy of you.

700
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:10,422
The conflagration you describe
does not blaze enough.

701
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,138
It is not all-consuming.

702
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:17,095
Had Lucan here written these verses,
I should acknowledge him a genius.

703
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:21,603
But you can create a work
such as the world has never known.

704
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:24,818
Therefore, I say this to your eyes.

705
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,113
Take greater pains.

706
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,984
The gods have given me a certain talent,
but they've given me something greater.

707
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,657
A true judge and friend.

708
00:53:32,831 --> 00:53:36,330
I thought it sufficient to equal Homer.
You have opened my eyes.

709
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:39,537
Then all men, born and unborn,
are my debtors.

710
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,792
You're right.

711
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:43,799
My conflagration does not burn enough.

712
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,317
And do you know why?

713
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:51,702
I've never seen a burning city.

714
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:57,243
You said one must suffer an experience
to re-create it.

715
00:53:57,417 --> 00:54:00,086
A sculptor has his model.
I had no model.

716
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:03,166
To burn a city in order to create an epic.

717
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:06,459
That's carrying the principle
of art for art's sake too far.

718
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,467
Soon the spring will be over.

719
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:13,129
The summer heat will begin.

720
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:17,099
What stenches will arise from Rome?

721
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:23,017
I shall move the court to Antium.

722
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:47,048
You did not observe
Croton's masterful stroke.

723
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,711
I was not the only one.

724
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,506
Vinicius has hardly taken his eyes
from her.

725
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:53,838
She must be truly exciting.

726
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:56,969
I must see this for myself.

727
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:05,141
But it was a fair match.
It could have been one or the other.

728
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,525
You seemed pleased with my gift,
commander.

729
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:11,448
Is it enough, in the light of your service?

730
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:14,068
Or isn't it?

731
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,202
Do you know, lovely one?

732
00:55:16,371 --> 00:55:17,413
Has he told you?

733
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,202
No, Caesar,
I thought it should come from you.

734
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,585
Know then, Lygia,
that I have given you to Marcus Vinicius...

735
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,703
...as a reward for his devotion to me
and his brilliant service on the battlefield.

736
00:55:28,216 --> 00:55:31,252
Henceforth, your guardian
is no longer General Plautius.

737
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,762
You belong to the household of Vinicius.

738
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:42,678
On closer inspection,
I find it a fair reward.

739
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:46,059
Perhaps excessive.

740
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:49,733
Except, of course,
as you so wisely observed, Divinity.

741
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:51,504
Oh, yes.

742
00:55:53,158 --> 00:55:56,112
Too narrow in the hips. Ha-ha.

743
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,029
Let us go and greet my guests.

744
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:04,127
Now you know, Lygia.

745
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:07,837
And there were moments
when I thought I could love you.

746
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:11,172
Make use of your beauty, live with me.
Love as you were made to love.

747
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:15,126
What difference does it make
whether I love, now that you own me?

748
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,593
You have but to give the word,
the command.

749
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:19,592
The small, empty command.

750
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:22,258
Yes, I own you.
You realize that, don't you?

751
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:25,473
You realize I can take you
and have you flogged until you love me?

752
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,937
Take me, then.
Take me to your house, anything.

753
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:30,896
Take me and you'll hear nothing from me
but a prayer for you.

754
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,481
- Lygia.
- Commander Vinicius.

755
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,155
The empress
requests your presence at once.

756
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:37,993
Very well.

757
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:43,659
Here. Take this girl
to the house of Gaius Petronius.

758
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,324
Put her in charge of Anaxander,
master of slaves there.

759
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,748
Yes, commander.

760
00:56:48,046 --> 00:56:50,204
Tears have but one use, Lygia.

761
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:52,588
As a prelude to joy.

762
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:55,166
Remember that while you wait for me.

763
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:13,188
You seem to have been having difficulty
in proving your ownership.

764
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,198
A young mare often enjoys
fighting the bit, empress.

765
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,567
I've always found conflict between
man and woman a waste of time.

766
00:57:20,745 --> 00:57:23,201
It consumes so much...

767
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,997
So much vitality.

768
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,448
Well said, empress.

769
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:29,704
I am not your empress.

770
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,750
I'm a priestess of Amon,
and you are the serpent.

771
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:34,798
Therefore, poison is in your mouth.

772
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:40,508
And I have a taste for poison, Marcus.

773
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:43,517
To change to a serpent,
that might take time.

774
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:48,809
I can bring that about.

775
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:52,686
Those are Commander Vinicius' orders.

776
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:11,162
Here. Oh, how clumsy of me.

777
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,667
You see, I know your symbol,
even though I'm not yet one of you.

778
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:17,834
Have courage, child.

779
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,513
Come along.

780
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,215
Bear in mind, your fate is determined
by the greatest power in this world.

781
00:58:24,392 --> 00:58:26,515
His will be done.

782
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,989
Aulus, my dear,
you must get some sleep.

783
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,372
I'll call you as soon as
Ursus sends word.

784
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:34,164
We should be hearing from Ursus soon
no matter what happened.

785
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:48,301
Good morning.

786
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:54,892
You're right, perhaps we'd better
ignore the formalities.

787
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:57,474
Will you tell Lygia I have come for her?

788
00:59:57,652 --> 01:00:00,190
We've not seen Lygia
since she was taken from us.

789
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:02,776
Bring Lygia here at once.

790
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:04,823
I tell you, we don't know where she is.

791
01:00:05,994 --> 01:00:09,445
- You're lying, general.
- I do not lie.

792
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:13,620
On my oath as a Roman officer,
so that you can understand, I do not lie.

793
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:15,702
You may search the house if you wish.

794
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,541
You refuse to say anything more?

795
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:22,586
Only this:
That you've violated our hospitality...

796
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,468
...in the cruelest way a man could.

797
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:26,215
Hospitality?

798
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,797
You're overlooking
our law of hostages, aren't you?

799
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:31,727
The emperor assigned Lygia to my care.
She's my property.

800
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,971
You're overlooking
what's happening to Rome.

801
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:35,475
To the world, Vinicius.

802
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:39,017
It's such laws as this
that will tumble its foundations.

803
01:00:39,194 --> 01:00:43,737
Your emperor, your god, Nero,
bathed in his own infamy.

804
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:47,739
- Aulus, my dear, please.
- I understand your concern.

805
01:00:47,994 --> 01:00:51,363
I hope I shall continue to forget
what I just heard, general.

806
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:52,939
Marcus.

807
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,542
My dear young Marcus.

808
01:00:56,711 --> 01:01:02,216
I want to call you that because
for all of your rank, you could be my son.

809
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:04,506
A woman of my years
is not unaware of things.

810
01:01:04,677 --> 01:01:08,093
Lygia's eyes were drawn to you.
I saw that.

811
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,265
And they would not have been
if deep down inside of you...

812
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,388
...you were this cold, this relentless.

813
01:01:14,562 --> 01:01:19,853
Look in your heart, Marcus, and
recognize the truth of you that should be.

814
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,959
Well, as long as you
return empty-handed...

815
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,416
...sit down
and fill your obviously empty stomach.

816
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:43,044
They claim to know nothing of her.
Plautius is lying.

817
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:46,801
Forget the whole undignified whim
and come with me to Antium.

818
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,303
There's something strange about Plautius
and that household.

819
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,964
By the gods,
they don't even talk like Romans.

820
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:56,476
And their friend,
a fellow from Tarsus named Paul.

821
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:59,398
Paul, you say? Of Tarsus?

822
01:01:59,566 --> 01:02:02,982
Yes, he's some fool philosopher
I met there.

823
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,275
Paul of Tarsus.

824
01:02:07,532 --> 01:02:09,940
My poor Marcus.

825
01:02:10,118 --> 01:02:12,609
This is drama for the ages.

826
01:02:12,787 --> 01:02:15,824
You picked the cherished egg
in a nest of Christians.

827
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:19,913
She's a Christian,
and Christians have spirited her away.

828
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:23,289
Christians. Are they the ones
who worship some dead carpenter?

829
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:24,507
Yes, that's right.

830
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,960
A rebel against the state,
a Jew called Christ.

831
01:02:28,136 --> 01:02:30,010
Crucified in Palestine, as I remember.

832
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,592
The sect is a secret one.

833
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:34,516
It consists of Jews, Greeks,
and many others...

834
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:38,100
...who meet in secret and spread
their superstitions among the Romans.

835
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:40,643
They are a constant worry
to Nero and the senate.

836
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:43,816
Tigellinus is always collecting
a group of them for questioning...

837
01:02:43,985 --> 01:02:47,899
This calls for a detachment of Praetorians.
I'll tell Tigellinus to start a search.

838
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:49,615
Well, now, wait.

839
01:02:49,782 --> 01:02:53,614
My dear boy,
that not only lacks dignity...

840
01:02:53,786 --> 01:02:56,194
...but these Christians
are known to be resourceful.

841
01:02:56,372 --> 01:03:00,370
An open display of force will only bury
your little hostage deeper in the nest.

842
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,785
What do you suggest?
That I join the scurvy group?

843
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:07,248
Listen, I know of a Greek,
a man called Chilo.

844
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:11,719
He's a self-styled soothsayer,
astrologer, and diviner of mysteries.

845
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:17,392
I've no doubt he'd show the way
to your escaped Lygia before nightfall.

846
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,221
- Anaxander?
- Yes, master?

847
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,519
You know the house of Chilo?

848
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:25,974
- Yes, master.
- My nephew has urgent business there.

849
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:27,481
- Escort him.
- Yes, master.

850
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:32,565
Well, your advice has certain merit.
I'll give your Greek a chance.

851
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,909
- If you find her, bring her to Antium.
- I'll send you word.

852
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:46,502
You have heard, Eunice?
Is not love a madness?

853
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,840
Do not ask me, lord.
I am among the mad.

854
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,763
You love someone?

855
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,434
It was once prophesied
by an old woman...

856
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:03,018
...that both pain and happiness
would visit me.

857
01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:05,597
That's a safe prophesy about any human.

858
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:10,603
She spoke a rhyme, in which she said
my true fate was hidden.

859
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,447
Well?

860
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:19,699
<i>Anon shall Venus rise</i>
<i>From out the violet Roman sea</i>

861
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:26,043
<i>And bear two lovers in her arms</i>
<i>Towards eternity</i>

862
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,417
Whom do you love? Anaxander?

863
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,845
Mirmillon?

864
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,799
Oh, your beloved is not of this house?

865
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,136
He is, my lord.

866
01:04:48,735 --> 01:04:54,156
What if I said that today you should go
with me to the violet Roman sea?

867
01:04:55,742 --> 01:05:01,116
I'd swoon with happiness.
Only you haven't said it, my lord.

868
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:03,282
Then go ready yourself for Antium.

869
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:12,759
- You haven't yet swooned.
- I have no time, my lord.

870
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:17,554
I have no time. I have no time.

871
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:23,012
Yes, yes.

872
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:27,184
Hearing all this, I vow you've come
to the right man, Marcus Vinicius.

873
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:28,767
Speak. Can you find this girl?

874
01:05:28,942 --> 01:05:32,524
Patience, lord. I must first verify
if she is truly of this Christian breed.

875
01:05:33,446 --> 01:05:36,281
- My lord, do you read Greek?
- Passably.

876
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:39,071
Look here, then. What does that say?

877
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:45,623
- "Jesus Christ, Son of God, savior."
- Exactly.

878
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:48,828
So it's the name of their dead God.
I've seen no such symbols.

879
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:51,541
Ah, but observe the first letters
of each word.

880
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,790
What do they spell?

881
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:58,549
<i>I-C-T-H-U-S, icthus.</i>

882
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,473
The Greek word for fish.

883
01:06:03,476 --> 01:06:07,688
Have you seen the symbol of a fish
in all this?

884
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,389
Fish, why should I have seen a...?

885
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,061
- She once drew one.
- Aha. Their sign of recognition.

886
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,909
Fish are caught with a bait
and Christians with a fish.

887
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,070
How do I find her?
Where are the gatherings?

888
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:25,404
They practice foul rites at night...

889
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,989
...in certain caves
and old ruins outside the city.

890
01:06:28,168 --> 01:06:31,003
- Is there a gathering tonight?
- Possibly, lord.

891
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:34,374
But it is most dangerous.
There are hundreds of them.

892
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:37,419
I'll hire Croton the gladiator
to protect you. Does that suit?

893
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:40,345
Croton? Why, yes, lord.

894
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:42,221
We'll meet you here at sundown.

895
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:46,470
But, my lord, I shall need other arms.

896
01:06:46,644 --> 01:06:50,013
A small weapon in advance, perhaps?

897
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:22,637
You see how they gather, lord?
In stealth, like thieves and murderers.

898
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:37,099
- That's the man I met at her house.
- Yes, she's here, without a doubt, lord.

899
01:07:38,738 --> 01:07:44,325
I baptize thee in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

900
01:07:45,245 --> 01:07:48,080
- What's he doing now?
- They call it baptism.

901
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:51,581
An evil bath of black water.

902
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:01,041
I know there are some here
who still hold back in doubt.

903
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:03,461
A few who have not accepted baptism.

904
01:08:04,597 --> 01:08:06,673
Our Lord Jesus understood that...

905
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:10,717
...and he welcomed questions,
as the right of free men.

906
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:15,981
But at last, there is one among us tonight
for whom we have long waited.

907
01:08:16,151 --> 01:08:19,769
Who was there when the people
gathered about Christ and questioned him.

908
01:08:19,946 --> 01:08:22,615
Who heard the answers
from his own lips.

909
01:08:22,782 --> 01:08:27,528
A man who saw the face of Jesus
and touched his hand.

910
01:08:28,246 --> 01:08:31,947
He comes from Jerusalem.
The fisherman, Simon, called Peter.

911
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,164
The first apostle of our Lord.

912
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,558
Unworthy though I am, Jesus said to me:

913
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:55,808
"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock
I will build my church."

914
01:08:55,982 --> 01:08:57,690
He has guided my feet to Rome...

915
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:02,022
...so that together
we can begin to build his church here.

916
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:05,612
I give thanks for the faith you have in him
whom you have never seen...

917
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:09,733
...but whose voice you have heard
and answered in your hearts.

918
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,949
I heard his voice by the Sea of Galilee.

919
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:14,916
My brothers and I were fishermen.

920
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:18,833
All the night through we had been fishing
and had caught nothing.

921
01:09:19,005 --> 01:09:21,710
We were cold and very tired.

922
01:09:21,883 --> 01:09:25,833
<i>As our boat was coming into the shore,</i>
<i>I heard someone call my name.</i>

923
01:09:26,012 --> 01:09:29,013
<i>I looked up and a man stood there.</i>

924
01:09:29,182 --> 01:09:34,010
<i>At the sight of him, the cold and</i>
<i>weariness left me, my heart grew light.</i>

925
01:09:34,187 --> 01:09:36,856
<i>I answered, "Yes, friend?"</i>

926
01:09:37,023 --> 01:09:39,561
<i>He called and asked</i>
<i>that he might come into our boat...</i>

927
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:44,610
<i>... so he could speak better to the people</i>
<i>who were pressing around him on shore.</i>

928
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,405
<i>We bade him enter.</i>

929
01:09:46,574 --> 01:09:51,283
He spoke to the people
about the kingdom of heaven at hand.

930
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:57,789
Suddenly, my heart leapt in my breast and
I knew that he was the Christ to come.

931
01:09:58,711 --> 01:10:00,669
When he had finished, he said to me:

932
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:03,793
"Go out into deep waters
and let down your nets."

933
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,883
In a moment,
the nets were full as if by a miracle.

934
01:10:08,054 --> 01:10:10,462
He looked at my wonderment and said:

935
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,394
"Do not be afraid. From henceforth,
you shall be a fisher of men."

936
01:10:16,563 --> 01:10:19,398
He told me to follow him, and I did.

937
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:22,483
I and my brothers, James and John.

938
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:26,022
Throughout the length and breadth
of the land, we followed him.

939
01:10:26,197 --> 01:10:30,575
Others joined us until
besides himself, we were 12.

940
01:10:30,743 --> 01:10:34,990
To the hungry and thirsty,
he gave food and drink.

941
01:10:35,165 --> 01:10:41,285
To those who were sick and worn
and weary, he gave hope and peace.

942
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:45,377
Who but the Son of God
could have brought such gifts to man?

943
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:49,049
Who but the Son of God could have
commanded the storm to be calm?

944
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,755
Who but he could have raised
Lazarus of Bethany from the dead...

945
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:55,850
...and given peace to the heart
of Mary Magdalene?

946
01:10:56,686 --> 01:11:01,846
And yet, I lived to deny this man.

947
01:11:02,942 --> 01:11:07,355
He himself foretold that I would
on the night of our last supper.

948
01:11:08,323 --> 01:11:13,448
<i>"Lord, " I had said, "I am willing to</i>
<i>follow you both to prison and to death."

949
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,865
<i>But he answered:</i>

950
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:18,952
<i>"Peter, this night,</i>
<i>before the cock crows...</i>

951
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:21,533
<i>... thou shalt deny me thrice."

952
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:24,415
<i>And I did.</i>

953
01:11:24,589 --> 01:11:27,709
Three times outside the house
of his judges.

954
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:30,553
When they accused me
of being with him, I said:

955
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,713
"I know not the man."

956
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,803
With a curse for the weakness of my body
in the face of death.

957
01:11:37,435 --> 01:11:43,022
Then they weighed him down with a cross
and scourged him.

958
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:45,480
And at a place called Calvary...

959
01:11:45,652 --> 01:11:50,195
...they crucified him,
with a crown of thorns upon his head.

960
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:54,152
But even in the midst
of his suffering, Jesus said:

961
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:58,455
"Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do."

962
01:11:58,623 --> 01:12:00,746
Only the Son of God
could have forgiven them...

963
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:04,084
...as he forgave me for my denial of him.

964
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:08,788
But he who raised the dead
could not be conquered by death.

965
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:12,834
The room in which we later sat,
in silence and in sorrow...

966
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:18,137
<i>... was filled suddenly with a great light</i>
<i>and the risen Lord stood before us.</i>

967
01:12:18,309 --> 01:12:21,643
<i>We saw his hands that the nails</i>
<i>had pierced and his wounded side...</i>

968
01:12:21,813 --> 01:12:24,933
<i>... and we knew indeed</i>
<i>that he was the Lord.</i>

969
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:29,271
<i>And we heard his voice say,</i>
<i>"Peace be unto you."</i>

970
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:34,321
<i>And he commanded us to preach</i>
<i>to all men his holy word.</i>

971
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:38,953
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

972
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:42,906
Blessed are they who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

973
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:45,753
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

974
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:50,625
Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness...

975
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,211
...for they shall be filled.

976
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:56,301
Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

977
01:12:56,472 --> 01:13:01,467
Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

978
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:07,730
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
shall be called the children of God.

979
01:13:08,276 --> 01:13:12,653
But beyond these things, Jesus asks us
to obey the commandments...

980
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:15,693
...which God gave to the prophet Moses.

981
01:13:15,867 --> 01:13:19,995
Obey those who govern you
and the laws by which they govern.

982
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:22,654
Even though, under them,
you suffer cruelties...

983
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:26,248
...and witness maliciousness
beyond your mind's dimensions...

984
01:13:26,419 --> 01:13:29,088
...make no threat of violence in return.

985
01:13:29,964 --> 01:13:33,499
And in the words of Jesus,
I further say to you...

986
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:38,338
...whosoever shall smite thee upon thy
right cheek, turn to him the other also.

987
01:13:39,349 --> 01:13:41,507
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

988
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:47,438
Whatsoever you would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them.

989
01:13:47,607 --> 01:13:50,857
Love your enemies.
Bless them that curse you.

990
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,687
Do good to them that hate you.

991
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:56,646
And pray for them that despitefully
use you and persecute you.

992
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:58,824
Oh, believe in him.

993
01:13:58,993 --> 01:14:03,988
Endure all things in his name,
so that you may dwell in blessedness.

994
01:14:04,165 --> 01:14:08,459
Even from everlasting to everlasting.

995
01:14:10,088 --> 01:14:11,088
Amen.

996
01:14:11,297 --> 01:14:12,297
Amen.

997
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:26,932
Endure all things in his name,
that you may dwell in blessedness.

998
01:14:31,526 --> 01:14:35,440
If I smite him on one cheek, the old rat
will have no chance to turn the other.

999
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:40,651
I don't know.
The old rat has courage of sorts.

1000
01:14:40,827 --> 01:14:43,781
Will you both come to our house
tomorrow to see Peter and Paul?

1001
01:14:43,955 --> 01:14:46,197
We must bide our time,
we may be watched.

1002
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:50,075
Good night, Father. Good night, Mother.

1003
01:14:56,426 --> 01:14:59,427
There. There she is.

1004
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:16,607
- Well, commander?
- Come along.

1005
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:41,714
That giant looks as though
he had the strength of a Cretan bull.

1006
01:15:41,888 --> 01:15:45,933
- Do you think you can down him?
- I'll squeeze the seeds out of him.

1007
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:51,226
Wait. We're being followed.

1008
01:15:51,898 --> 01:15:54,104
- I don't hear anyone.
- Three times I have heard.

1009
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:56,601
They stop when we do.
Go on to the house.

1010
01:15:56,778 --> 01:15:58,438
- But what will...?
- Go to the house.

1011
01:16:13,503 --> 01:16:15,745
Go no further, commander.

1012
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:19,922
- Step aside.
- My lord, you haven't paid me.

1013
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:41,836
It's only a small cut in the scalp,
but they always bleed the most.

1014
01:17:42,008 --> 01:17:43,751
Hot water.

1015
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:48,505
I'll get some ointment.

1016
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:52,173
Look. Did you do that too, Ursus?

1017
01:17:52,352 --> 01:17:54,261
No, dear. That's an old scar.

1018
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:55,931
A scar? What from?

1019
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:58,098
Probably some battle wound.

1020
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,896
That's right. He's one of Nero's
best generals, isn't he?

1021
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:03,476
Here. Come, Nazarius,
it's time you were asleep.

1022
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:06,525
- But, Mother, did you see the big sword...?
- Yes, dear.

1023
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:09,903
- Wash the wound thoroughly first, Lygia.
- Yes.

1024
01:19:22,734 --> 01:19:24,014
Come, Ursus.

1025
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:39,707
Ursus wishes to speak to you.

1026
01:19:42,045 --> 01:19:43,918
- Yes?
- I want to ask...

1027
01:19:44,088 --> 01:19:47,872
...the commander's forgiveness.
I killed his friend.

1028
01:19:49,093 --> 01:19:50,753
Ha-ha. You killed Croton?

1029
01:19:50,929 --> 01:19:53,965
Good man. I told you you'd be a
champion. Kill the old Greek too?

1030
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,469
The other man disappeared.

1031
01:19:55,642 --> 01:19:57,551
I'll wager he did, and fast.

1032
01:19:58,228 --> 01:19:59,722
Please say you'll forgive him.

1033
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:02,138
For what? Croton faced his chances.

1034
01:20:02,315 --> 01:20:04,557
Killing was his profession.

1035
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:06,608
Of all the gods, why didn't you kill me?

1036
01:20:06,778 --> 01:20:09,150
In our faith, it is a sin to kill.

1037
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,151
I seem to remember.

1038
01:20:19,374 --> 01:20:23,418
He should have killed me.
You should have had him kill me.

1039
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:26,920
But instead, you bring me in
and patch me up, all of you who hate me.

1040
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:32,586
You've defeated me, Lygia.

1041
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:34,341
Go on home. Stop hiding.

1042
01:20:34,722 --> 01:20:37,889
I won't come pursuing you
about the countryside any longer.

1043
01:20:38,059 --> 01:20:40,431
You're free and rid of me, Lygia.

1044
01:20:44,023 --> 01:20:46,265
You could look happier about it.

1045
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,235
Well, so be it.

1046
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:54,015
Marcus.

1047
01:20:54,993 --> 01:20:57,484
Oh, Marcus, you know I don't hate you.

1048
01:20:59,831 --> 01:21:01,031
Lygia.

1049
01:21:03,543 --> 01:21:05,868
- Oh, Marcus, Marcus.
- The sweetness of you.

1050
01:21:06,045 --> 01:21:07,872
Oh, this is the beauty, I knew it.

1051
01:21:08,047 --> 01:21:11,547
I should have known it had to happen
when I watched you leave the gathering.

1052
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,963
- You were there?
- Yes.

1053
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:20,635
I should have known what I really wished.
You with me always as my wife.

1054
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:22,352
Will you do that, Lygia?

1055
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,352
Will you give me the greatest triumph
a man ever had? Be my wife?

1056
01:21:27,275 --> 01:21:29,564
Oh, yes, Marcus.

1057
01:21:32,697 --> 01:21:35,153
Gather what you need
and let's be gone from this den.

1058
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:36,902
- Hurry.
- Yes, Marcus, I'll hurry.

1059
01:21:37,076 --> 01:21:39,781
We'll go to Antium.
Petronius will outdo himself.

1060
01:21:39,954 --> 01:21:43,370
A ceremony and wedding feast
such as never has been seen.

1061
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:46,376
And even that will be lost moments.

1062
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:47,669
Oh...

1063
01:21:52,258 --> 01:21:54,963
Marcus, Paul will be here soon.

1064
01:21:55,136 --> 01:21:59,513
I would like so much to ask his blessing.
Perhaps let him say the words over us.

1065
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:01,841
What words?
You've heard enough of his words.

1066
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:04,889
They've deafened your ears
to everything life has to tell you.

1067
01:22:05,063 --> 01:22:06,854
But you heard Peter and Paul speak.

1068
01:22:07,023 --> 01:22:09,181
Did you hear anything
that was ugly or wrong?

1069
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:11,980
I heard a childish old man
speak in riddles.

1070
01:22:12,153 --> 01:22:13,196
Believe as they do...

1071
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:17,360
...and you'll think a cow is a bull
and a bull is an ox and an ox is a goat.

1072
01:22:18,618 --> 01:22:20,611
Oh, Marcus, dear.

1073
01:22:20,787 --> 01:22:24,037
I thought, having heard,
you might begin to know...

1074
01:22:24,207 --> 01:22:25,701
...to understand why.

1075
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,583
Here, now.

1076
01:22:27,752 --> 01:22:31,038
Is this the symbol of your God,
your Christ?

1077
01:22:31,214 --> 01:22:33,503
The cross on which he was crucified.

1078
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:36,960
I'm willing to accept your God,
if it makes you happier.

1079
01:22:38,012 --> 01:22:39,175
I don't demand it.

1080
01:22:39,347 --> 01:22:42,882
In our gardens in Sicily, we'll put up
a big cross, higher than the roof.

1081
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:46,558
I'll put up a special pedestal and crown it
with a figure of your Christ...

1082
01:22:46,729 --> 01:22:48,473
...carved from the finest marble.

1083
01:22:48,648 --> 01:22:51,566
You'll have to have Peter
tell the sculptor what he looks like.

1084
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:54,049
- Marcus, listen to me...
- Why not? It's no trouble.

1085
01:22:54,154 --> 01:22:58,234
There's such an army of gods these days
we can always find room for another.

1086
01:23:01,452 --> 01:23:05,913
I'm not asking it as a condition
of our having one another.

1087
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:07,742
I just hope and pray that one day...

1088
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:11,002
...the image of Christ
will appear in your heart.

1089
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:12,997
My heart is only for you.

1090
01:23:13,173 --> 01:23:14,833
There won't be room for him there.

1091
01:23:15,008 --> 01:23:16,716
There will be.

1092
01:23:16,885 --> 01:23:20,752
I always carry him in mine with you.

1093
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:25,722
Well, take him out
if he means that much, Lygia.

1094
01:23:25,894 --> 01:23:28,432
- Do you hear me? Get rid of him.
- Well.

1095
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:31,098
I'm glad to see you on your feet again.

1096
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:34,690
Last night and this morning,
you had us quite concerned.

1097
01:23:34,861 --> 01:23:35,861
Paul.

1098
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:39,446
- Marcus has just asked me to be his wife.
- Oh?

1099
01:23:39,616 --> 01:23:42,819
I'm sure that this has
brought her great joy, Marcus.

1100
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:45,948
You could see, Paul, that I loved him.

1101
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:48,827
I was just trying to explain to him that...

1102
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,334
Well, that there are other things. I mean...

1103
01:23:52,504 --> 01:23:54,543
- I understand.
- I don't.

1104
01:23:54,714 --> 01:23:57,632
I offered to accept the symbols
of her God into my house.

1105
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,259
I don't ask her to accept mine.

1106
01:23:59,427 --> 01:24:02,262
What more can I do to prove
that I'm not an enemy of her God?

1107
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:03,830
Marcus.

1108
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:08,435
For some of us it takes months,
years of thought...

1109
01:24:08,603 --> 01:24:11,520
...of contemplation,
of looking back on our lives...

1110
01:24:11,731 --> 01:24:13,688
...on the course of mankind
and realizing...

1111
01:24:13,858 --> 01:24:15,898
Tell me what more I should do.

1112
01:24:16,069 --> 01:24:18,607
Well, you own slaves, do you not?

1113
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,488
Hundreds. Good ones too. Why?

1114
01:24:20,657 --> 01:24:22,863
Jesus wishes no man to be in bondage.

1115
01:24:23,493 --> 01:24:24,821
You should set them free.

1116
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:27,367
Set them free?
But they're mine, I own them.

1117
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:30,243
But you can't buy human beings,
Marcus.

1118
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,824
Faith in Christ is based on love.

1119
01:24:33,002 --> 01:24:35,291
He asks all people to love one another.

1120
01:24:35,463 --> 01:24:40,042
So I heard your old fisherman say. You
want me to love the whole human race?

1121
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,881
You want me to love Parthians,
Egyptians, Persians?

1122
01:24:43,054 --> 01:24:45,212
The rest who wanna put a blade
through my ribs?

1123
01:24:45,431 --> 01:24:47,638
Has it occurred to you
to put down your sword...

1124
01:24:47,809 --> 01:24:49,683
...and renounce war
against these people?

1125
01:24:49,853 --> 01:24:52,260
That you might conquer them with love?

1126
01:24:52,438 --> 01:24:56,187
Yes, yes,
you tame a pack of wolves with a feather.

1127
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,767
It's occurred to me
you've a whining beggar for God.

1128
01:24:58,945 --> 01:25:02,646
A cringing God for slaves, aliens,
and outcasts like yourself.

1129
01:25:02,866 --> 01:25:04,739
But that's not Lygia.

1130
01:25:05,702 --> 01:25:08,619
Let's be gone from this idiocy of words.
Get your cloak, Lygia.

1131
01:25:08,788 --> 01:25:11,789
- Marcus, dear, a moment more.
- We've lost too much time as it is.

1132
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,496
You're going to be wife of
Commander Marcus Vinicius...

1133
01:25:14,669 --> 01:25:17,207
...not the miserable slave
of some crucified carpenter.

1134
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:22,375
Oh, Marcus, try to understand my faith,
my beliefs, my very deep beliefs.

1135
01:25:22,552 --> 01:25:25,090
Don't force me to choose.

1136
01:25:25,263 --> 01:25:27,884
You mean, between me and your Christ?

1137
01:25:28,057 --> 01:25:29,765
Yes, choose.

1138
01:25:29,934 --> 01:25:33,054
I'd no more share you with your Christ
than I would with other men.

1139
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:35,138
But, Marcus, don't you see?

1140
01:25:35,315 --> 01:25:39,526
Unless you try to understand, what we
feel for each other will destroy itself.

1141
01:25:40,111 --> 01:25:41,938
Destroy us.

1142
01:25:42,447 --> 01:25:46,397
My son, your love for Lygia,
great and beautiful as you feel it...

1143
01:25:46,576 --> 01:25:48,984
...is small compared with your love
for all mankind.

1144
01:25:49,162 --> 01:25:52,745
What sort of love is it that acknowledges
a force greater than itself?

1145
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:55,833
What runs in your veins, philosopher,
blood or water?

1146
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:58,410
What sort of poison are you spreading?

1147
01:25:59,589 --> 01:26:01,546
Are you coming with me, Lygia?

1148
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:07,254
Lygia.

1149
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,223
No, my dear.

1150
01:26:14,979 --> 01:26:16,687
Twice today, I've been a fool.

1151
01:26:16,856 --> 01:26:18,600
But I'll not go back on my word.

1152
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:22,689
You can go your way.
I'll not disclose what I've seen or heard.

1153
01:26:22,862 --> 01:26:25,436
Something is hidden
behind your meek words, philosopher.

1154
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:29,198
Yours and your fanatical fisherman's.
They strike at Rome and Roman law.

1155
01:26:29,911 --> 01:26:34,240
I warn you, if ever Roman rule
is threatened, you'll feel my sword.

1156
01:26:47,762 --> 01:26:50,929
I almost...
I wanted to go with him, Paul.

1157
01:26:52,308 --> 01:26:53,471
Lygia.

1158
01:26:54,686 --> 01:26:56,892
Even our Lord knew temptation.

1159
01:26:57,063 --> 01:27:00,847
Your strength too will prevail
and be rewarded in this.

1160
01:27:01,025 --> 01:27:02,769
I know that.

1161
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:43,199
Yes, yes.

1162
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:47,351
These will be the imperial gardens,
where the cattle market now stands?

1163
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:48,859
Yes, Divinity.

1164
01:27:49,032 --> 01:27:51,487
Each palace rising out of its own lake...

1165
01:27:51,659 --> 01:27:54,696
...surfaced with water fowl
of the rarest plumage.

1166
01:27:54,871 --> 01:27:58,619
No longer will the stench of pig and oxen
rise up the slopes of the Palatine.

1167
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:02,077
No. It shall be landscaped
with Damascene roses.

1168
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:07,498
Oh, Phaon, you are an architect
who could have laid the plans of Olympus.

1169
01:28:09,385 --> 01:28:11,793
- My lord, I have brought food.
- Take it away.

1170
01:28:11,971 --> 01:28:14,842
- It comes to life...
- You've not eaten since morning, my lord.

1171
01:28:15,016 --> 01:28:17,388
Be gone with it, all of you!

1172
01:28:18,228 --> 01:28:20,220
You irritate me.

1173
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:23,974
Why do you stare at me, Acte?

1174
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,025
My lord...

1175
01:28:26,653 --> 01:28:28,776
I can only say...

1176
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:36,444
When all this sets with the final sun,
remember the look of Acte.

1177
01:28:36,663 --> 01:28:38,205
Why should I remember you?

1178
01:28:38,373 --> 01:28:40,200
No one loves you as I love you.

1179
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:41,869
I command you to stop loving me!

1180
01:28:42,043 --> 01:28:43,870
I cannot, lord.

1181
01:28:44,587 --> 01:28:46,379
Forgive me.

1182
01:28:48,633 --> 01:28:51,753
For years,
she has been a thorn in my flesh.

1183
01:28:51,928 --> 01:28:53,885
Now that thorn will be removed.

1184
01:28:55,348 --> 01:28:59,677
Henceforth, you are banished from Rome
and from my sight.

1185
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:02,687
One day, Nero, you will need me.

1186
01:29:04,983 --> 01:29:07,141
And I will come to you.

1187
01:29:10,613 --> 01:29:13,318
Is it not disgusting
when common bovine solicitude...

1188
01:29:13,491 --> 01:29:16,741
...replaces the fire in a woman's body?

1189
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:21,656
Ah, but what pulsating purity
there is in fire.

1190
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:25,249
My new Rome shall spring
from the loins of fire...

1191
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:29,168
...a twisting, writhing, breathing flame.

1192
01:29:32,385 --> 01:29:34,923
What do you think Petronius
will say to this?

1193
01:29:35,096 --> 01:29:36,970
You doubt his approval, my lord?

1194
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,924
I too remember his strange look at the
feast when the thought first came to you.

1195
01:29:41,102 --> 01:29:43,771
- I should be careful lest...
- No, no.

1196
01:29:43,938 --> 01:29:47,023
Petronius appreciates my genius
even more than you, dear Phaon.

1197
01:29:47,192 --> 01:29:51,059
It's just that he may not fully understand
the method, the means I must use...

1198
01:29:51,237 --> 01:29:54,322
...to bring this greatest
of my accomplishments into being.

1199
01:29:56,826 --> 01:30:00,160
He seems to be well-occupied
at the moment.

1200
01:30:00,705 --> 01:30:05,830
When I have news of Tigellinus coming,
I shall summon him with the others.

1201
01:30:06,002 --> 01:30:10,545
This must be disclosed to him
with intelligence...

1202
01:30:10,715 --> 01:30:14,298
...with, uh, sincerity.

1203
01:30:18,139 --> 01:30:19,139
Yes.

1204
01:30:20,225 --> 01:30:21,885
There you are.

1205
01:30:23,853 --> 01:30:26,427
- Marcus.
- Hmm?

1206
01:30:27,899 --> 01:30:29,642
Well, it's your game.

1207
01:30:29,818 --> 01:30:32,059
Only two games you've won
in three weeks, Marcus.

1208
01:30:32,237 --> 01:30:33,351
Does the play bore you?

1209
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:34,988
I fear I have met my superior.

1210
01:30:35,406 --> 01:30:37,732
I fear you might have met
something else.

1211
01:30:37,909 --> 01:30:39,403
Other than a glare of distaste...

1212
01:30:39,577 --> 01:30:42,744
...I've been given no details
concerning your sudden renunciation...

1213
01:30:42,914 --> 01:30:44,622
...of your little Christian hostage.

1214
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:47,460
Your well-bred curiosity
now breaks its bounds, eh?

1215
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:49,254
It shatters me.

1216
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:53,123
Well, uncle, it happened quite simply.

1217
01:30:53,299 --> 01:30:57,427
Your valiant Greek led me to Lygia
and a swarming hive of idiots.

1218
01:30:57,595 --> 01:31:01,344
Their black honey choked my mouth
and I said words I never thought I'd utter.

1219
01:31:01,516 --> 01:31:04,386
For their mammoth stupidity
I should've been broken in half...

1220
01:31:04,561 --> 01:31:06,933
...and dropped piecemeal
into the sewers.

1221
01:31:07,105 --> 01:31:09,560
- Fascinated?
- In a way.

1222
01:31:10,066 --> 01:31:11,066
Yes?

1223
01:31:11,276 --> 01:31:14,442
The empress requests your presence
in her pavilion, commander.

1224
01:31:14,612 --> 01:31:15,941
At once.

1225
01:31:19,367 --> 01:31:21,241
I leave you to your fascination.

1226
01:31:21,411 --> 01:31:23,700
I have been summoned to mine.

1227
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:30,128
None of this bodes well.

1228
01:31:30,378 --> 01:31:32,454
Wouldn't the emperor be angry
if he should...?

1229
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:36,082
Poppaea's indulgences
merely stimulate him to his own.

1230
01:31:36,259 --> 01:31:38,584
But I sense a fresh preoccupation
in Nero.

1231
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:41,169
For some time now, he has avoided me.

1232
01:31:41,347 --> 01:31:42,545
My lord is troubled?

1233
01:31:42,724 --> 01:31:44,515
A doubled guard and yesterday...

1234
01:31:44,684 --> 01:31:48,302
...Tigellinus and a squadron of his
butchers left for Rome.

1235
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,350
I feel a strange and heavy breeze.

1236
01:31:51,524 --> 01:31:53,647
Oh, my dear lord.

1237
01:31:54,652 --> 01:31:58,484
Even your little song is sad
with its note of death.

1238
01:31:58,656 --> 01:32:00,483
It is just words.

1239
01:32:00,658 --> 01:32:02,698
And I sing it joyfully.

1240
01:32:02,869 --> 01:32:08,658
Because love such as I feel
cannot ever die.

1241
01:32:14,426 --> 01:32:17,380
As always,
your entrance is proud and aloof.

1242
01:32:17,554 --> 01:32:21,219
I come proudly, as fast as my hands
and knees will carry me.

1243
01:32:21,391 --> 01:32:24,392
And as always,
sardonic and unassailable.

1244
01:32:24,561 --> 01:32:26,055
Unassailable?

1245
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:30,726
I've never been so readily, so happily,
so expertly vanquished in my life.

1246
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:34,685
I believe everything
except the word "vanquished."

1247
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:39,240
I should like to vanquish you, Marcus.

1248
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:42,826
Like the spider who eats her mate
when he is no longer a necessity?

1249
01:32:42,996 --> 01:32:46,081
Mm-hm. Something like that.

1250
01:32:47,251 --> 01:32:49,920
I heard today
you're planning to leave for Sicily.

1251
01:32:50,087 --> 01:32:52,245
Three years away,
there's much to look after.

1252
01:32:52,422 --> 01:32:55,258
Will you sail from here
or will you go via Rome?

1253
01:32:56,969 --> 01:32:59,923
Rome?
That's rather an indirect route, isn't it?

1254
01:33:00,097 --> 01:33:01,840
Then I shall be direct.

1255
01:33:02,015 --> 01:33:04,685
I know about your little
Christian hostage vanishing.

1256
01:33:05,102 --> 01:33:08,138
I've eyes and ears
in the Praetorian Guard.

1257
01:33:08,313 --> 01:33:10,685
And an arm or two
to fit your waist, no doubt?

1258
01:33:12,109 --> 01:33:13,603
Possibly.

1259
01:33:14,361 --> 01:33:15,939
Did you find her, Marcus?

1260
01:33:17,114 --> 01:33:18,228
Naturally.

1261
01:33:18,407 --> 01:33:21,610
Only to find myself a fool
and sever her chains, I might add.

1262
01:33:22,077 --> 01:33:24,235
You severed them thoroughly?

1263
01:33:25,914 --> 01:33:27,077
Thoroughly.

1264
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:29,341
I'm glad.

1265
01:33:31,044 --> 01:33:32,444
Marcus.

1266
01:33:36,216 --> 01:33:39,881
Because you know how I consoled myself
when you vanished from the feast.

1267
01:33:40,053 --> 01:33:41,512
Spare me names, dear empress.

1268
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,467
I consoled myself
with the thought of your death.

1269
01:33:44,641 --> 01:33:46,100
I fondled your bodiless head...

1270
01:33:46,268 --> 01:33:49,637
...running my fingers through your hair,
making you smile and frown.

1271
01:33:50,772 --> 01:33:52,101
May I ask what stopped you?

1272
01:33:52,482 --> 01:33:56,979
It is foolish to kill those you hate,
because once dead they are beyond pain.

1273
01:33:57,154 --> 01:33:59,230
And I hated you, Marcus.

1274
01:33:59,656 --> 01:34:01,732
I welcome your change of heart, at least.

1275
01:34:01,909 --> 01:34:06,155
But if ever she bewitches you again,
I shall know.

1276
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:12,368
And since I have no hatred for her,
I do not care whether she feels pain.

1277
01:34:16,673 --> 01:34:19,508
You'd never turn the other cheek to me,
would you?

1278
01:34:21,511 --> 01:34:23,718
I don't know what you mean.

1279
01:34:26,058 --> 01:34:28,809
But my mouth is here.

1280
01:34:33,273 --> 01:34:35,266
Where is Petronius?
Have you summoned him?

1281
01:34:35,442 --> 01:34:37,316
- Have you called Petronius?
- Yes, Caesar.

1282
01:34:37,486 --> 01:34:39,478
Well, summon him again. Tell him l...

1283
01:34:39,655 --> 01:34:41,861
As ever, I'm impatient for you.

1284
01:34:42,032 --> 01:34:43,360
I have missed you, Divinity.

1285
01:34:43,534 --> 01:34:46,534
Petronius, forgive me
if I seem to have slighted you of late.

1286
01:34:46,703 --> 01:34:50,487
I have been steeped in my genius
beyond all description.

1287
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:53,536
I sense a fresh inspiration.

1288
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:56,201
Your senses shall leap to it.

1289
01:35:04,429 --> 01:35:07,383
Attend me. Attend me, all.

1290
01:35:13,397 --> 01:35:16,931
My lack of consideration for you
during the past few days...

1291
01:35:17,109 --> 01:35:21,569
...in keeping you from my presence,
forces me to impress upon you again...

1292
01:35:21,738 --> 01:35:24,905
...the tribulations of the true artist.

1293
01:35:25,576 --> 01:35:29,656
When I play and sing, I have visions
of things I never dreamed existed.

1294
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:32,119
The world is mine.

1295
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:34,910
And mine to end.

1296
01:35:35,377 --> 01:35:37,535
Music opens up new worlds for me.

1297
01:35:37,713 --> 01:35:40,168
Draws back the veil from new delights.

1298
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,250
I can see Olympus...

1299
01:35:42,426 --> 01:35:46,091
...and a breeze blows on me
from beyond the Earth.

1300
01:35:47,014 --> 01:35:48,508
And in those moments...

1301
01:35:48,682 --> 01:35:54,767
...I, a god, feel as diminutive as dust.

1302
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:01,735
This is a day for sincerity.

1303
01:36:01,904 --> 01:36:04,395
Let me open my soul to you.

1304
01:36:05,616 --> 01:36:06,944
Do you think I do not know...

1305
01:36:07,117 --> 01:36:11,245
...that there are people in Rome
who call me a matricide, a wife killer?

1306
01:36:11,413 --> 01:36:13,571
Hold me a monster?

1307
01:36:13,749 --> 01:36:15,149
Tyrant?

1308
01:36:16,543 --> 01:36:19,213
But there is something
they do not realize.

1309
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:24,457
A man's acts may be cruel
while he himself is not cruel.

1310
01:36:25,802 --> 01:36:28,472
And there are moments,
my dear Petronius...

1311
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:33,384
...when music caresses my soul.

1312
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,475
I feel as gentle as a child in a cradle.

1313
01:36:40,275 --> 01:36:41,318
Believe me?

1314
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:43,940
All men should know you
as we do, Divinity.

1315
01:36:44,112 --> 01:36:47,398
Only then would they be able
to appreciate you.

1316
01:36:49,076 --> 01:36:50,985
Yet there are those
who say that I am mad.

1317
01:36:51,161 --> 01:36:52,953
I'm only seeking.

1318
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:56,740
The flatness and misery
of common life depress me.

1319
01:36:56,917 --> 01:37:01,378
I seek because I must exceed
the stature of man in both good and evil.

1320
01:37:01,547 --> 01:37:03,586
I seek because I must be greater
than man...

1321
01:37:03,757 --> 01:37:06,841
...for only then
will I be the supreme artist.

1322
01:37:13,141 --> 01:37:18,847
Do you know why I condemned
both my wife...

1323
01:37:19,022 --> 01:37:23,067
...and my mother to death?

1324
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:28,864
I did it in order to lay at the gates
of an unknown world...

1325
01:37:29,032 --> 01:37:32,864
...the greatest sacrifice
a man can put there.

1326
01:37:33,954 --> 01:37:37,370
Now, I thought, doors will open...

1327
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:41,124
...beyond which I shall catch
a glimpse of the unknown.

1328
01:37:42,546 --> 01:37:45,037
Let it be wonderful.

1329
01:37:48,302 --> 01:37:50,627
Or let it be awful.

1330
01:37:52,097 --> 01:37:55,466
So long as it is uncommon.

1331
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:00,921
So now.

1332
01:38:02,858 --> 01:38:05,265
Behold, dear Petronius.

1333
01:38:14,286 --> 01:38:15,661
My new Rome.

1334
01:38:16,914 --> 01:38:19,155
It shall rise in gleaming white beauty.

1335
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:22,749
Master gem of the world's crown.

1336
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,330
It shall have a new name.

1337
01:38:24,504 --> 01:38:27,078
Neropolis, city of Nero.

1338
01:38:27,257 --> 01:38:29,131
- Magnificent.
- You have outdone yourself.

1339
01:38:29,301 --> 01:38:31,092
Something the world has never seen.

1340
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:35,840
But what of the Rome
that has stood for a thousand years?

1341
01:38:36,016 --> 01:38:39,302
After all, Divinity,
the old Rome, our Rome...

1342
01:38:39,478 --> 01:38:43,392
...dirty and magnificent,
but still our beloved Rome...

1343
01:38:43,565 --> 01:38:45,688
...it still stands.

1344
01:38:48,153 --> 01:38:49,695
Does it?

1345
01:38:51,782 --> 01:38:53,940
It still stands.

1346
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:56,409
We never thought of that, did we?

1347
01:38:57,496 --> 01:38:58,694
Or does it, Tigellinus?

1348
01:38:58,872 --> 01:39:02,372
Rome is a sea of flames.
It burns from rim to rim.

1349
01:39:02,543 --> 01:39:05,164
You hear that? That is my epic.

1350
01:39:05,337 --> 01:39:09,916
To change the face of the world.
To demolish and create, and create anew.

1351
01:39:10,092 --> 01:39:11,752
Now, to your chariots, all of you.

1352
01:39:11,927 --> 01:39:13,884
You shall come with me
to the funeral pyre.

1353
01:39:14,054 --> 01:39:16,889
This very night you shall hear
my dirge over burning Rome.

1354
01:39:17,057 --> 01:39:20,556
Its flames shall carry me
higher than the gods.

1355
01:39:21,019 --> 01:39:23,806
- All of Rome is burning?
- All but the Palatine area.

1356
01:39:23,981 --> 01:39:26,388
- What of the section across the river?
- An inferno.

1357
01:39:26,567 --> 01:39:29,817
- Thousands of roofs going up like tinder.
- Marcus.

1358
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,655
Stop Vinicius. Hold him.

1359
01:39:51,383 --> 01:39:54,966
Now, indeed,
Nero has his place in history.

1360
01:42:54,316 --> 01:42:56,522
Look, there's one of Nero's soldiers.

1361
01:42:56,693 --> 01:42:58,982
He burned Rome.

1362
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:13,828
The people here, the girl with the giant,
have you seen them?

1363
01:43:14,002 --> 01:43:17,870
They left. Don't kill me, don't kill me.

1364
01:43:18,715 --> 01:43:20,915
Mama, Mama.

1365
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:22,969
Mama.

1366
01:43:23,845 --> 01:43:26,045
Mama, Mama.

1367
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:05,173
Here, go on. Take care of her.

1368
01:44:15,022 --> 01:44:17,310
The sewers. The sewers lead to the river.

1369
01:44:17,482 --> 01:44:19,440
Into the sewers.

1370
01:45:32,015 --> 01:45:33,215
Lygia.

1371
01:45:33,684 --> 01:45:35,084
Marcus.

1372
01:45:47,364 --> 01:45:48,407
Lygia.

1373
01:45:48,574 --> 01:45:51,195
Oh, Marcus, Marcus, I prayed to see you.

1374
01:45:52,286 --> 01:45:55,785
Marcus, Miriam is dead, in the fire.

1375
01:45:55,956 --> 01:45:57,699
- She...
- My mother.

1376
01:45:57,875 --> 01:45:59,997
A wall fell on her.

1377
01:46:00,168 --> 01:46:02,327
We'll get you out of this, son.

1378
01:46:03,213 --> 01:46:05,455
The Praetorians are holding the bridge.

1379
01:46:15,726 --> 01:46:17,326
Open up.

1380
01:46:18,228 --> 01:46:19,687
- Who's in command here?
- I am.

1381
01:46:19,855 --> 01:46:20,898
Open this barricade.

1382
01:46:21,064 --> 01:46:24,433
Imperial orders. We're to keep them
from entering the Palatine area.

1383
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:26,234
Break ranks. Let them through.

1384
01:46:26,403 --> 01:46:27,778
Hold your line there.

1385
01:46:27,946 --> 01:46:31,149
I'm in charge here,
commander, and by the...

1386
01:46:31,742 --> 01:46:34,067
Break ranks, I say.

1387
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:19,445
Petronius, look what I've created!

1388
01:47:21,291 --> 01:47:25,159
Tigellinus, my robe of grief.

1389
01:47:25,796 --> 01:47:28,547
Terpnos, lyre.

1390
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:34,169
History will judge my song, Petronius.

1391
01:47:34,346 --> 01:47:36,671
Will it be great enough
to match the occasion?

1392
01:47:36,848 --> 01:47:39,518
I'm seized with the fear
that it will not be great enough.

1393
01:47:39,685 --> 01:47:43,813
You will be worthy of the spectacle,
as the spectacle is worthy of you.

1394
01:47:44,147 --> 01:47:46,354
You encourage me, Petronius.

1395
01:47:46,525 --> 01:47:50,143
But I'm aware that I must compete with
those who sang of the burning of Troy.

1396
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,072
My song must be greater,
just as Rome is greater than Troy.

1397
01:47:53,407 --> 01:47:57,819
<i>Silence, ye spheres</i>
<i>Be still, ye hurtling stars</i>

1398
01:47:57,995 --> 01:48:01,660
<i>Open wide-vaulted skies above me</i>

1399
01:48:01,832 --> 01:48:04,833
<i>Now, at last, lo, I see Olympus</i>

1400
01:48:05,002 --> 01:48:08,121
<i>And a light from its summit</i>
<i>Doth illumine me</i>

1401
01:48:08,297 --> 01:48:11,500
<i>I am one with the gods, immortal</i>

1402
01:48:11,675 --> 01:48:15,886
<i>I am Nero</i>
<i>The artist who creates with fire</i>

1403
01:48:16,054 --> 01:48:19,838
<i>That the dreams of my life</i>
<i>May come true</i>

1404
01:48:20,017 --> 01:48:22,009
<i>To the flames now I give the past</i>

1405
01:48:22,185 --> 01:48:25,934
<i>To the flames and soil</i>

1406
01:48:27,357 --> 01:48:30,109
<i>Take thou this Rome</i>

1407
01:48:30,736 --> 01:48:35,896
<i>Oh, receive her now, ye flames</i>

1408
01:48:36,074 --> 01:48:39,906
<i>Consume her as would a furnace</i>

1409
01:48:40,078 --> 01:48:43,661
<i>Burn on, O ancient Rome</i>

1410
01:48:43,832 --> 01:48:48,432
<i>Burn on, burn on</i>

1411
01:49:02,935 --> 01:49:05,260
The mob from burned areas.

1412
01:49:06,396 --> 01:49:07,855
They want to survive.

1413
01:49:08,023 --> 01:49:09,517
Who asked them to survive?

1414
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:14,900
Tigellinus.

1415
01:49:15,072 --> 01:49:18,939
The palace is fully guarded, Majesty.
They will never pass my Praetorians.

1416
01:49:23,705 --> 01:49:26,078
The night is chilly.

1417
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,242
Let us withdraw.

1418
01:49:31,547 --> 01:49:35,710
Is it possible that human beings
can produce such a sound?

1419
01:49:35,884 --> 01:49:39,170
Yes, when they've been driven too far.

1420
01:49:48,438 --> 01:49:51,890
- Death to Nero.
- Death to the incendiary.

1421
01:49:52,067 --> 01:49:53,347
They'll break through.

1422
01:49:53,527 --> 01:49:55,769
Summon all the detachments
from the barracks.

1423
01:49:56,238 --> 01:49:58,811
Death to the incendiary.

1424
01:50:05,539 --> 01:50:07,994
They're shouting something.
What are they shouting?

1425
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:10,492
They have given you a new title, Divinity.

1426
01:50:10,669 --> 01:50:12,745
"Incendiary."

1427
01:50:13,964 --> 01:50:16,585
I've sent for reinforcements.
I hope they arrive in time.

1428
01:50:16,758 --> 01:50:18,632
I'd speak to the mob.
Make some promises.

1429
01:50:18,802 --> 01:50:20,427
I do not ask favors, I confer them.

1430
01:50:20,596 --> 01:50:22,304
You go. Speak to them in my name.

1431
01:50:22,472 --> 01:50:25,142
Not until detachments arrive,
then I'll speak with steel.

1432
01:50:25,309 --> 01:50:26,637
They'd stone me to death now.

1433
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:29,301
In what better cause could you die?

1434
01:50:30,063 --> 01:50:32,733
This was your architect's dream.
Go and tell them, Phaon.

1435
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:33,942
This is all for them.

1436
01:50:34,109 --> 01:50:35,900
How can we admit that, Divinity?

1437
01:50:36,069 --> 01:50:37,813
You're right, we must never admit it.

1438
01:50:37,988 --> 01:50:40,989
How can I expect that mob
to share my vision?

1439
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:42,658
Seneca, what do you advise?

1440
01:50:42,826 --> 01:50:46,610
The mob is a wild animal,
and with an animal you cannot reason.

1441
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,829
I'm surrounded by eunuchs.

1442
01:50:54,213 --> 01:50:56,205
Why do you stand aloof?
You're my counselor.

1443
01:50:56,381 --> 01:50:57,544
Why don't you counsel me?

1444
01:50:57,716 --> 01:51:00,634
Let them enter, we shall all die.

1445
01:51:00,802 --> 01:51:04,385
All except you.
You, of course, being a god, are immortal.

1446
01:51:04,556 --> 01:51:07,972
Your levity is ill-timed, Petronius.
They'll destroy you also.

1447
01:51:08,143 --> 01:51:11,061
I do not share your passion
for self-preservation.

1448
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:14,812
I love Rome,
and I am not eager to survive it.

1449
01:51:14,983 --> 01:51:16,643
You're not like these other people.

1450
01:51:16,818 --> 01:51:18,526
They think that you're their friend.

1451
01:51:18,695 --> 01:51:20,854
Speak to them, make promises.

1452
01:51:21,031 --> 01:51:23,948
Grain, oil, wine.

1453
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:29,444
They will take them, Nero,
without your permission.

1454
01:51:29,623 --> 01:51:31,532
Insatiable and thankless mob.

1455
01:51:31,708 --> 01:51:33,368
- What do they want?
- Justice.

1456
01:51:33,544 --> 01:51:36,995
No mob ever wants justice.
They want vengeance.

1457
01:51:40,551 --> 01:51:42,351
A victim.

1458
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,733
Tigellinus, it was you who burnt Rome.

1459
01:51:59,903 --> 01:52:01,563
At your command, Nero.

1460
01:52:01,738 --> 01:52:03,731
Tigellinus, do you love me?

1461
01:52:04,408 --> 01:52:06,566
- You know it, lord.
- Then prove it.

1462
01:52:06,743 --> 01:52:11,405
Go to the mob,
bare your breast to them and your guilt.

1463
01:52:11,748 --> 01:52:13,077
I would do so gladly, Nero...

1464
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:16,833
...but I am head of the Praetorian Guard
and the Praetorians love me.

1465
01:52:17,004 --> 01:52:19,329
If I die, they may turn against you.

1466
01:52:19,506 --> 01:52:21,713
I cannot subject you to that danger.

1467
01:52:21,884 --> 01:52:24,375
Are you threatening me, Tigellinus?

1468
01:52:24,553 --> 01:52:28,253
Do you hear him threaten me
with the Praetorian Guard?

1469
01:52:30,183 --> 01:52:33,137
You're all willing to desert me. I know it.

1470
01:52:33,937 --> 01:52:35,645
I feel it.

1471
01:52:35,814 --> 01:52:38,103
Nero, my beloved, you were right.

1472
01:52:38,275 --> 01:52:41,359
Give the people what they want.
Give them blood and vengeance.

1473
01:52:41,528 --> 01:52:44,102
Not one victim, but a hundred,
a thousand.

1474
01:52:44,281 --> 01:52:46,072
Victims? What victims?

1475
01:52:46,241 --> 01:52:49,159
A group who worship one
they say is higher than you.

1476
01:52:49,328 --> 01:52:51,700
They are the enemies
of the human race, and of you.

1477
01:52:52,372 --> 01:52:53,617
Who are these people?

1478
01:52:53,790 --> 01:52:56,079
They despise our temples
and our gods...

1479
01:52:56,251 --> 01:52:59,751
...and prophesy that the end of the world
shall be caused by fire.

1480
01:52:59,922 --> 01:53:02,709
Well, then,
make their prophesy come true.

1481
01:53:02,883 --> 01:53:04,258
Let it end for them.

1482
01:53:05,093 --> 01:53:06,136
Who are they?

1483
01:53:06,303 --> 01:53:08,046
They call themselves Christians.

1484
01:53:08,222 --> 01:53:09,764
Christians?

1485
01:53:09,932 --> 01:53:11,426
Yes, I've heard of them.

1486
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:14,803
The empress speaks rightly, Caesar.
The people hate these Christians.

1487
01:53:14,978 --> 01:53:17,054
They are the enemies of Rome
and of the state.

1488
01:53:17,231 --> 01:53:20,231
The people want vengeance, Nero.
Let them have it.

1489
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,978
The people suspect you.

1490
01:53:22,152 --> 01:53:25,236
Let their suspicion turn
in this more beneficial direction.

1491
01:53:25,405 --> 01:53:27,647
- Surely, my lord...
- They should pay, Caesar.

1492
01:53:27,824 --> 01:53:29,568
They must pay.

1493
01:53:29,743 --> 01:53:31,202
Do you hear?

1494
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,952
The Christians are plotting to destroy me.

1495
01:53:36,458 --> 01:53:39,993
You have often reminded us, Nero,
of the judgment of history.

1496
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:42,661
What will its verdict be
if you punish the innocent...

1497
01:53:42,839 --> 01:53:44,797
...and betray your own greatness?

1498
01:53:44,967 --> 01:53:47,090
Let future ages,
looking back at this time...

1499
01:53:47,261 --> 01:53:50,012
...regard Nero
with wonder and amazement.

1500
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,430
Let history say:
Nero, the ruler of the world.

1501
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:58,346
Nero, a god, burned Rome
because he was as powerful as Jupiter.

1502
01:53:59,022 --> 01:54:04,099
He loved poetry so much
that he sacrificed Rome for a song.

1503
01:54:04,945 --> 01:54:08,112
History need not say
that the burning of Rome was good...

1504
01:54:08,282 --> 01:54:10,855
...but it must say
that it was colossal, uncommon.

1505
01:54:11,034 --> 01:54:14,699
I cannot listen to any veiled suggestion
that my emperor is a coward.

1506
01:54:14,872 --> 01:54:16,366
That is amusing.

1507
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:19,410
You, who were too cowardly
to risk your life for him yourself.

1508
01:54:19,585 --> 01:54:22,669
Petronius is right.
You refused to die for me.

1509
01:54:22,838 --> 01:54:25,376
He wants to preserve your enemies.
I want to kill them.

1510
01:54:25,549 --> 01:54:28,336
- Why do you defend these people?
- I'll tell you why, my lord.

1511
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:31,760
Because his nephew, Vinicius,
loves a Christian girl, Lygia.

1512
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:34,468
And it may be Petronius
is himself a Christian.

1513
01:54:36,018 --> 01:54:38,722
Petronius, are you a Christian?

1514
01:54:39,146 --> 01:54:40,889
I am not.

1515
01:54:41,064 --> 01:54:44,896
I have heard that the Christians
teach you to love your neighbor.

1516
01:54:45,402 --> 01:54:48,438
And as I see what men are...

1517
01:54:48,947 --> 01:54:51,485
...I cannot, for the life of me,
love my fellow man.

1518
01:54:51,658 --> 01:54:52,658
Ha!

1519
01:54:53,619 --> 01:54:56,454
He does not love you, gentlemen.

1520
01:54:58,415 --> 01:55:00,621
A tablet, Phaon.

1521
01:55:00,792 --> 01:55:03,366
The people shall have their vengeance.

1522
01:55:04,588 --> 01:55:11,041
I hereby proclaim that the guilt
of the burning of our beloved city...

1523
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:16,012
...rests with the foul sect
which calls itself Christian.

1524
01:55:17,517 --> 01:55:22,429
They have spread the lie
that it was Nero who burnt Rome.

1525
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:27,352
I will exterminate these criminals...

1526
01:55:27,527 --> 01:55:32,236
...in a manner
matching the enormity of their crime.

1527
01:55:34,701 --> 01:55:37,738
Their punishment will be a warning.

1528
01:55:40,332 --> 01:55:43,748
A spectacle of terror...

1529
01:55:44,628 --> 01:55:47,380
...to all evil men...

1530
01:55:47,798 --> 01:55:52,294
...everywhere and forever...

1531
01:55:53,178 --> 01:55:58,054
...who would harm you or harm Rome...

1532
01:55:58,517 --> 01:56:03,717
...or harm your emperor...

1533
01:56:06,942 --> 01:56:08,816
...who loves you.

1534
01:56:15,993 --> 01:56:19,159
Pause, Nero, before you sign this decree.

1535
01:56:19,705 --> 01:56:23,204
Rome has given the world
justice and order.

1536
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:26,293
Sign that,
and Roman justice will receive a blow...

1537
01:56:26,461 --> 01:56:28,454
...from which it may never recover.

1538
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:31,252
Condemn these Christians
and you make martyrs of them...

1539
01:56:31,425 --> 01:56:33,085
...and insure their immortality.

1540
01:56:33,594 --> 01:56:38,421
Condemn them,
and in the eyes of history...

1541
01:56:38,765 --> 01:56:40,425
...you'll condemn yourself.

1542
01:56:43,186 --> 01:56:47,231
When I have finished
with these Christians, Petronius...

1543
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:53,852
...history will not be sure
that they ever existed.

1544
01:57:02,331 --> 01:57:04,074
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a sailor.

1545
01:57:04,249 --> 01:57:06,408
Nothing burns at sea.
There's too much water.

1546
01:57:06,585 --> 01:57:10,001
Nero can burn the whole ocean.

1547
01:57:12,132 --> 01:57:13,532
Marcus.

1548
01:57:18,222 --> 01:57:20,428
Did you rest well?

1549
01:57:20,599 --> 01:57:23,884
I was impatient to see the sunrise,
and here you are.

1550
01:57:26,188 --> 01:57:27,765
You should have slept longer.

1551
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:31,807
Your journey from Antium
and last night must have...

1552
01:57:31,985 --> 01:57:35,188
I've been asleep too long
in many ways, Lygia.

1553
01:57:35,364 --> 01:57:38,780
I must return to the city at once,
meet with Nerva and the others.

1554
01:57:40,577 --> 01:57:43,744
Yes, Rome and what it stands for.

1555
01:57:43,914 --> 01:57:45,871
Something must be done
about this maniac.

1556
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:48,959
There must be an answer to this,
quickly, decisive.

1557
01:57:50,295 --> 01:57:52,169
You do know the answer.

1558
01:57:52,339 --> 01:57:54,795
You do understand.

1559
01:57:56,134 --> 01:57:59,586
There can be no
turning the other cheek now, Lygia.

1560
01:58:00,347 --> 01:58:03,467
If I have not returned by nightfall,
I'll send word.

1561
01:58:11,441 --> 01:58:13,600
Marcus Vinicius?

1562
01:58:14,778 --> 01:58:17,269
We have not met,
but I have heard of you.

1563
01:58:17,447 --> 01:58:20,235
You must realize how grateful we are
for what you have done.

1564
01:58:20,409 --> 01:58:22,615
For your concern for Lygia.

1565
01:58:22,786 --> 01:58:25,455
My only concern is for Lygia.

1566
01:58:31,128 --> 01:58:32,752
Hold yourself straight, youngster.

1567
01:58:33,338 --> 01:58:35,414
A man must be a soldier.

1568
01:58:45,767 --> 01:58:47,262
I don't want to be a soldier.

1569
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:50,059
Let's talk about our journey.

1570
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:53,017
We'll be meeting Paul in Greece,
you know.

1571
01:58:53,191 --> 01:58:54,271
That's good.

1572
01:58:54,443 --> 01:58:57,812
You'll like Greece, Nazarius.
You'll help me to fish for men there.

1573
01:58:57,988 --> 01:59:01,736
And I think we'll have time
to fish for fish too.

1574
01:59:01,909 --> 01:59:03,319
Are we leaving soon?

1575
01:59:03,493 --> 01:59:07,112
As soon as we eat.
We shall be starting within the hour.

1576
01:59:08,332 --> 01:59:13,409
I'm glad,
because I don't like it here anymore.

1577
01:59:15,964 --> 01:59:18,253
Yes, indeed.

1578
01:59:18,425 --> 01:59:21,094
We shall be fishermen together.

1579
01:59:51,833 --> 01:59:55,416
Please, my lord,
do not trouble yourself so.

1580
01:59:55,587 --> 01:59:58,541
It is a moment for thought, Eunice.

1581
01:59:58,924 --> 02:00:03,004
Yesterday, I could have gone to the mob
and told them that Nero burned Rome.

1582
02:00:03,178 --> 02:00:05,800
I could've offered them a new emperor
in General Galba...

1583
02:00:06,098 --> 02:00:08,719
...and so set my seal upon the times.

1584
02:00:11,228 --> 02:00:13,137
But I did not.

1585
02:00:14,231 --> 02:00:15,891
Do you know why, Eunice?

1586
02:00:16,233 --> 02:00:18,558
I know nothing of these things, my lord.

1587
02:00:19,027 --> 02:00:21,779
Because I love Nero, perhaps?

1588
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:25,156
He fills me with loathing.

1589
02:00:25,784 --> 02:00:29,118
No, because out of force of long habit...

1590
02:00:29,288 --> 02:00:32,242
...I've become content
only to be an amused cynic...

1591
02:00:32,416 --> 02:00:36,959
...a selfish onlooker,
leaving others to shape the world.

1592
02:00:40,883 --> 02:00:42,211
Marcus.

1593
02:00:42,384 --> 02:00:44,424
The gods be praised.
I was worried about you.

1594
02:00:44,595 --> 02:00:47,430
You know Nerva, here.
My third in command, Justin Scipio.

1595
02:00:47,598 --> 02:00:50,349
We meet in a ghastly hour, gentlemen.

1596
02:00:50,517 --> 02:00:52,225
We've made our decision.

1597
02:00:52,394 --> 02:00:55,265
The time has come for Galba
to replace Nero.

1598
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:57,266
Justin is taking this message to him...

1599
02:00:57,441 --> 02:01:00,110
...asking him to come with his legions
in all haste.

1600
02:01:00,277 --> 02:01:04,855
Your signature added to these will make
Galba confident of his reception.

1601
02:01:05,032 --> 02:01:06,656
I know you will give it.

1602
02:01:13,526 --> 02:01:16,313
I sign it with humility.

1603
02:01:21,784 --> 02:01:23,444
On your way.

1604
02:01:25,538 --> 02:01:27,163
You took a risk in coming here.

1605
02:01:27,332 --> 02:01:29,704
You're a marked man.
You scorned Poppaea.

1606
02:01:29,876 --> 02:01:32,082
She has death in her eye for you
and your Lygia.

1607
02:01:32,253 --> 02:01:33,534
I'll chance that.

1608
02:01:33,713 --> 02:01:36,418
Take Lygia
and leave Rome as quickly as possible.

1609
02:01:36,591 --> 02:01:39,675
At least you'll be spared
Nero's final horror.

1610
02:01:39,844 --> 02:01:43,178
He is about to extinguish his conflagration
in a sea of blood.

1611
02:01:43,973 --> 02:01:45,171
Whose blood?

1612
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:47,757
Did you not hear his orators
at the street corners?

1613
02:01:47,936 --> 02:01:51,554
Already the people are being given
the story, along with grain and wine...

1614
02:01:51,731 --> 02:01:55,681
...that it was the Christians and not Nero
who set fire to Rome.

1615
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:58,565
- They won't believe such a lie.
- But they are believing it.

1616
02:01:58,738 --> 02:02:02,356
The people will believe any lie
if it is fantastic enough.

1617
02:02:03,827 --> 02:02:05,949
I'll meet you at your house by midday.

1618
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,197
We will keep you informed.

1619
02:02:15,463 --> 02:02:17,788
Farewell, Marcus.

1620
02:02:18,508 --> 02:02:20,002
Farewell.

1621
02:02:20,677 --> 02:02:22,420
Farewell?

1622
02:02:22,595 --> 02:02:24,220
What do you mean, my lord?

1623
02:02:24,389 --> 02:02:28,967
My dear, this morning
Nero sent to inquire after my health.

1624
02:02:29,144 --> 02:02:32,263
A Praetorian officer
brought his solicitude.

1625
02:02:32,438 --> 02:02:34,764
It is easy to see
that he means to amuse himself...

1626
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:37,064
...by making a sport of my extermination.

1627
02:02:37,235 --> 02:02:39,940
- But then you must...
- No, no, my dear.

1628
02:02:40,113 --> 02:02:42,782
I have the means to disappoint him.

1629
02:02:43,241 --> 02:02:45,613
Send Anaxander to me.

1630
02:02:47,412 --> 02:02:51,077
I will give him the names
of those few I love.

1631
02:02:52,292 --> 02:02:55,495
He will go and ask them
to dine with us tonight.

1632
02:02:59,382 --> 02:03:03,925
- Gen. Plautius, his family, where are they?
- You're late, they're already imprisoned.

1633
02:03:04,095 --> 02:03:06,633
The Praetorians came
and collected the whole scurvy lot.

1634
02:03:06,806 --> 02:03:10,471
Me, raising my children
right by the house of dirty Christians.

1635
02:03:10,643 --> 02:03:13,644
Burn the city, will they?

1636
02:03:16,274 --> 02:03:18,267
Put them in Number 4.

1637
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:25,450
Have you the family
of General Plautius here?

1638
02:03:26,493 --> 02:03:29,493
I do not know, commander.
See if we have them.

1639
02:03:29,662 --> 02:03:31,655
I have an order
for their immediate release.

1640
02:03:31,831 --> 02:03:33,491
A signed order? By whom?

1641
02:03:33,666 --> 02:03:37,616
I do not accept questions, Praetorian.
I transmit orders.

1642
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:44,801
A seasoned campaigner trapped by love.

1643
02:03:44,969 --> 02:03:47,128
We've been expecting you.

1644
02:03:47,305 --> 02:03:50,306
As soldiers, we've always hoped to die
a quick and noble death...

1645
02:03:50,475 --> 02:03:51,554
...haven't we, Vinicius?

1646
02:03:51,893 --> 02:03:54,810
But Nero has in mind for you
something more leisurely...

1647
02:03:54,979 --> 02:03:57,221
...and certainly ignoble.

1648
02:03:57,816 --> 02:03:59,725
Put him with his Christian friends.

1649
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:14,439
Marcus?

1650
02:04:18,378 --> 02:04:21,332
Oh, why did they take you?
This is none of your doing.

1651
02:04:21,506 --> 02:04:23,997
I carry my share of the blame.

1652
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:29,296
We knew they were looking for you,
but we had no way to send warning.

1653
02:04:29,472 --> 02:04:31,595
This is a sad reward for your friendship.

1654
02:04:31,766 --> 02:04:34,008
Marcus, I once accused you bitterly.

1655
02:04:34,185 --> 02:04:35,845
I'm proved wrong.

1656
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:38,594
It's no triumph for me to find you here.

1657
02:04:38,773 --> 02:04:40,018
General Plautius, l...

1658
02:04:49,909 --> 02:04:51,320
The lions!

1659
02:04:51,494 --> 02:04:53,368
It is the lions.

1660
02:04:53,538 --> 02:04:55,661
No, no, please, God!

1661
02:04:55,832 --> 02:04:57,492
No, I can't stand...

1662
02:04:57,667 --> 02:04:59,790
No, dear, no.

1663
02:04:59,961 --> 02:05:03,412
We must be strong in him, in each other.

1664
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:04,632
Where is he, then?

1665
02:05:04,799 --> 02:05:08,002
If he is so all-powerful as you say,
why do we find ourselves here?

1666
02:05:08,178 --> 02:05:09,885
My friend, stand firm.

1667
02:05:10,054 --> 02:05:13,637
My two babies and all of our children
to be sold into slavery.

1668
02:05:13,808 --> 02:05:16,216
Is that what the redeemer promised us?

1669
02:05:16,394 --> 02:05:21,554
Only by strength in faith
will we be able to endure the ordeal.

1670
02:05:22,025 --> 02:05:25,773
I thank God Peter and Paul were spared.

1671
02:05:25,945 --> 02:05:30,654
But I miss their spirit and their courage.

1672
02:05:57,435 --> 02:05:58,977
I think it's going to rain.

1673
02:05:59,145 --> 02:06:01,932
We'd better look for a place
to take shelter.

1674
02:06:02,315 --> 02:06:04,723
Peter, don't you think so?

1675
02:06:05,401 --> 02:06:08,272
What troubles you?
You've hardly said anything all morning.

1676
02:06:08,446 --> 02:06:10,605
Oh, I'm sorry, Nazarius.

1677
02:06:10,782 --> 02:06:11,825
Are you very tired?

1678
02:06:11,991 --> 02:06:13,984
Oh, my mind is as heavy as my body.

1679
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:17,245
There is something wrong,
with our people, perhaps.

1680
02:06:17,413 --> 02:06:18,456
I do not know.

1681
02:06:18,623 --> 02:06:21,790
It is at such times
I need our Lord's counsel.

1682
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:24,248
There is within me a decision
that I cannot find.

1683
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:27,338
If only he would speak to me, l...

1684
02:06:28,967 --> 02:06:33,379
Look, those treetops there,
they do not bend with the wind.

1685
02:06:33,555 --> 02:06:35,761
Yes, that is so.

1686
02:06:37,308 --> 02:06:41,436
And that sudden brightness coming,
do you see it, Nazarius?

1687
02:06:43,773 --> 02:06:46,229
It is the light of the Lord.

1688
02:06:46,401 --> 02:06:48,477
I have seen it.

1689
02:06:50,822 --> 02:06:53,491
Christ Jesus, you are here.

1690
02:06:53,908 --> 02:06:56,482
What is wrong, O Lord?

1691
02:06:56,911 --> 02:06:58,820
What should I do?

1692
02:06:58,997 --> 02:07:01,197
I am weary.

1693
02:07:01,416 --> 02:07:03,989
How should I follow thee now?

1694
02:07:08,673 --> 02:07:10,915
Whither goest thou, Lord?

1695
02:07:14,679 --> 02:07:20,266
My people in Rome have need of thee.

1696
02:07:23,897 --> 02:07:25,355
What did you say, Nazarius?

1697
02:07:27,984 --> 02:07:32,112
My people in Rome have need of thee.

1698
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,652
If thou desert my people...

1699
02:07:34,824 --> 02:07:39,320
...I shall go to Rome
to be crucified a second time.

1700
02:07:41,706 --> 02:07:44,114
Nazarius, blessed child, speak on.

1701
02:07:44,292 --> 02:07:45,492
Speak.

1702
02:07:45,793 --> 02:07:47,916
Oh, Peter, you've stumbled. Here.

1703
02:07:48,087 --> 02:07:50,757
The words you said, say them again.

1704
02:07:50,924 --> 02:07:52,418
I didn't say anything.

1705
02:07:52,592 --> 02:07:55,463
You said, " If thou desert my people...

1706
02:07:55,637 --> 02:07:58,638
...I shall go to Rome
to be crucified a second time."

1707
02:07:59,349 --> 02:08:01,057
But I said nothing.

1708
02:08:04,562 --> 02:08:05,562
Yes.

1709
02:08:07,565 --> 02:08:10,566
He has again spoken to me.

1710
02:08:11,778 --> 02:08:13,189
Come, Nazarius.

1711
02:08:13,363 --> 02:08:14,405
Where are you going?

1712
02:08:14,572 --> 02:08:16,172
To Rome.

1713
02:08:33,967 --> 02:08:37,549
I have invited you here tonight,
my friends...

1714
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:40,924
...you who have been steadfast
through the years.

1715
02:08:41,266 --> 02:08:45,215
That you have come
proves not only your recklessness...

1716
02:08:45,395 --> 02:08:46,437
...but your devotion.

1717
02:08:46,604 --> 02:08:48,513
You pay us too much respect.

1718
02:08:48,690 --> 02:08:52,059
We know you have the wit
to bring yourself into his favor again.

1719
02:08:53,153 --> 02:08:54,153
No.

1720
02:08:54,654 --> 02:08:56,896
Tigellinus has won.

1721
02:08:57,073 --> 02:08:59,066
Nero, our master...

1722
02:08:59,242 --> 02:09:02,077
...is at the moment
anticipating how he will make me suffer.

1723
02:09:02,245 --> 02:09:05,199
But I shall deprive him of that pleasure.

1724
02:09:05,915 --> 02:09:09,082
This is an evening of farewells.

1725
02:09:10,003 --> 02:09:11,627
Where will you go, my lord?

1726
02:09:11,796 --> 02:09:12,839
Your lord?

1727
02:09:13,006 --> 02:09:16,375
You've called me that for long enough.
My name is Gaius.

1728
02:09:17,218 --> 02:09:20,801
And you've worn this emblem of slavery
for far too long.

1729
02:09:22,682 --> 02:09:24,591
Henceforth, you are legally free.

1730
02:09:26,686 --> 02:09:31,313
And this villa, with its treasures,
its slaves, its gardens, will be yours.

1731
02:09:31,941 --> 02:09:33,483
Why do you say this?

1732
02:09:33,651 --> 02:09:38,812
Because this evening,
with its warmth and feeling...

1733
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:42,325
...this evening is my signature.

1734
02:09:42,494 --> 02:09:44,819
The last flourish.

1735
02:09:46,998 --> 02:09:49,489
Tell the physician to come in.

1736
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:55,161
It is not enough to live well.

1737
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:56,668
One must die well.

1738
02:10:04,307 --> 02:10:06,015
No, my lord.

1739
02:10:06,184 --> 02:10:08,342
No. Please don't let him.

1740
02:10:13,191 --> 02:10:19,360
I understand the Christians say that
death is but a transition to a better life.

1741
02:10:20,031 --> 02:10:21,858
It will be interesting to discover.

1742
02:10:22,033 --> 02:10:23,824
Oh, my lord.

1743
02:10:23,993 --> 02:10:26,698
My dear, no tears before our guests.

1744
02:10:27,038 --> 02:10:28,366
Petronius...

1745
02:10:29,082 --> 02:10:34,207
If the Christians are right,
this will be but a brief parting.

1746
02:10:34,379 --> 02:10:37,795
We can't... We can't part.

1747
02:10:37,966 --> 02:10:39,366
Eunice.

1748
02:10:40,552 --> 02:10:42,378
Did you think I could live without you?

1749
02:10:42,554 --> 02:10:44,593
No, no. Bind her wrist.

1750
02:10:45,056 --> 02:10:50,014
For the first time, Gaius, I disobey you.

1751
02:10:51,521 --> 02:10:57,559
What have I done that forever I should
hear the sweet thunder of your heart?

1752
02:10:58,778 --> 02:11:00,687
You have given me your love.

1753
02:11:17,213 --> 02:11:21,792
And now, my friends,
I wish to write a letter to our emperor.

1754
02:11:22,093 --> 02:11:23,493
Scribe?

1755
02:11:24,429 --> 02:11:26,552
Will you permit me?

1756
02:11:26,723 --> 02:11:29,428
Let us hear it, Petronius.

1757
02:11:30,977 --> 02:11:34,144
To Nero, emperor of Rome...

1758
02:11:34,314 --> 02:11:39,023
...master of the world, divine pontiff.

1759
02:11:40,403 --> 02:11:43,902
I know that my death
will be a disappointment to you...

1760
02:11:44,073 --> 02:11:49,150
...since you wished to render me
this service yourself.

1761
02:11:50,788 --> 02:11:56,127
To be born in your reign
is a miscalculation...

1762
02:11:56,294 --> 02:12:00,126
...but to die in it is a joy.

1763
02:12:00,298 --> 02:12:04,794
I can forgive you for murdering your wife
and your mother...

1764
02:12:04,969 --> 02:12:09,797
...for burning our beloved Rome,
for befouling our fair country...

1765
02:12:09,974 --> 02:12:15,099
...with the stench of your crimes.

1766
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:18,815
But one thing I cannot forgive...

1767
02:12:19,484 --> 02:12:23,316
...the boredom
of having to listen to your verses...

1768
02:12:23,822 --> 02:12:29,824
...your second-rate songs,
your mediocre performances.

1769
02:12:30,453 --> 02:12:33,988
Adhere to your special gifts, Nero.

1770
02:12:34,165 --> 02:12:38,542
Murder and arson, betrayal and terror.

1771
02:12:38,837 --> 02:12:41,791
Mutilate your subjects, if you must.

1772
02:12:41,965 --> 02:12:48,466
But with my last breath, I beg you,
do not mutilate the arts.

1773
02:12:49,347 --> 02:12:54,092
Farewell, but compose no more music.

1774
02:12:55,186 --> 02:12:57,808
Brutalize the people...

1775
02:12:58,523 --> 02:13:02,188
...but do not bore them...

1776
02:13:02,694 --> 02:13:08,447
...as you have bored to death
your friend...

1777
02:13:09,868 --> 02:13:12,441
...the late Gaius Petronius.

1778
02:13:20,211 --> 02:13:25,372
Seneca, I entrust to you
the delivery of this letter.

1779
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:27,174
I will deliver it.

1780
02:13:49,908 --> 02:13:52,612
Farewell, Petronius.

1781
02:13:52,785 --> 02:13:57,282
With you perishes the best
of our Roman world.

1782
02:14:00,043 --> 02:14:01,667
Petronius?

1783
02:14:01,836 --> 02:14:02,836
Dead?

1784
02:14:05,548 --> 02:14:07,707
By his own hand?

1785
02:14:09,010 --> 02:14:12,711
- I don't believe it.
- I witnessed it, Divinity.

1786
02:14:15,099 --> 02:14:18,551
I shall never forgive him for this.
Never!

1787
02:14:18,728 --> 02:14:21,349
Without my permission?

1788
02:14:21,523 --> 02:14:23,515
It's rebellion.

1789
02:14:24,108 --> 02:14:26,267
It's blasphemy.

1790
02:14:26,444 --> 02:14:28,733
He left you a message of farewell.

1791
02:14:31,282 --> 02:14:33,524
Then he did think of me.

1792
02:14:34,369 --> 02:14:37,286
His last thoughts were of me.

1793
02:14:38,915 --> 02:14:41,750
How I loved you, Petronius.

1794
02:14:42,085 --> 02:14:44,658
You were my one friend.

1795
02:14:44,838 --> 02:14:47,459
You alone understood my soul.

1796
02:14:48,675 --> 02:14:51,629
Tigellinus, the weeping vase.

1797
02:14:53,346 --> 02:14:56,762
Who will listen to my songs now?

1798
02:14:57,767 --> 02:15:03,556
Who will appreciate
the true value of my verses?

1799
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:08,317
I weep for you, Petronius.

1800
02:15:10,947 --> 02:15:13,272
One tear for you.

1801
02:15:16,161 --> 02:15:17,619
One for me.

1802
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:23,749
Seal up these fruits of my sorrow...

1803
02:15:23,918 --> 02:15:30,122
...so that posterity may know
how Nero grieved for his dearest friend...

1804
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:33,550
...and truest critic.

1805
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:41,050
And now for his tender words.

1806
02:16:03,666 --> 02:16:05,266
Destroy!

1807
02:16:06,002 --> 02:16:09,205
Destroy his house, every stone to dust.

1808
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:10,875
Burn his books.

1809
02:16:11,049 --> 02:16:12,922
Slaughter his animals.

1810
02:16:13,092 --> 02:16:16,508
Kill his servants.
Male, female, eunuch, every one of them.

1811
02:16:16,679 --> 02:16:18,719
Beat his memory into the ground!

1812
02:16:48,503 --> 02:16:49,618
Where is the emperor?

1813
02:16:49,796 --> 02:16:51,753
Let Nero start the game.

1814
02:16:51,923 --> 02:16:53,666
The lions are getting hungry.

1815
02:16:55,051 --> 02:16:57,257
Bring on those house burners.

1816
02:16:57,428 --> 02:16:59,088
They're crying for blood.

1817
02:16:59,264 --> 02:17:01,303
I doubt if we can chance anything today.

1818
02:17:01,474 --> 02:17:03,597
Nothing will change
the temper of this mob.

1819
02:17:03,768 --> 02:17:05,642
Have you heard any news
of the commander?

1820
02:17:05,812 --> 02:17:07,603
Only that he's been taken, that's all.

1821
02:17:42,348 --> 02:17:45,764
O holy gods of Rome...

1822
02:17:45,935 --> 02:17:52,223
...in the name of Nero,
emperor and supreme pontiff...

1823
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:55,686
...we beseech you
to receive in sacrifice...

1824
02:17:55,862 --> 02:17:59,313
...the lives
of those who sought to destroy...

1825
02:17:59,491 --> 02:18:03,488
...this sacred and eternal city.

1826
02:19:42,844 --> 02:19:44,504
Have strength as he did.

1827
02:19:44,679 --> 02:19:46,339
It will not be long.

1828
02:19:46,514 --> 02:19:49,930
Oh, dear Lord Jesus, help them.

1829
02:19:50,101 --> 02:19:51,264
Help them.

1830
02:19:59,903 --> 02:20:00,945
Don't.

1831
02:20:01,112 --> 02:20:03,354
Don't torture yourself.

1832
02:20:04,616 --> 02:20:07,652
I'll be as close to her as I can.

1833
02:20:19,214 --> 02:20:21,835
You may give the signal, Divinity.

1834
02:20:24,177 --> 02:20:26,964
Peace to the martyrs!

1835
02:20:27,388 --> 02:20:28,431
Peter.

1836
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,427
Peace, peace to them.

1837
02:20:31,601 --> 02:20:33,594
Take thy children, Lord.

1838
02:20:33,978 --> 02:20:36,849
Numb their wounds, soften their pains.

1839
02:20:37,023 --> 02:20:39,229
Give them strength, O savior.

1840
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:40,645
Seize that man.

1841
02:20:40,819 --> 02:20:45,979
Blessed are you, my children,
who die in the name of Jesus.

1842
02:20:46,157 --> 02:20:48,482
I say to you that this day...

1843
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:51,530
...you shall be with him in paradise.

1844
02:20:51,704 --> 02:20:57,410
Here, where Nero rules today,
Christ shall rule forever.

1845
02:21:00,171 --> 02:21:01,500
Who is that man?

1846
02:21:01,673 --> 02:21:04,377
I think he is their leader,
a man called Peter.

1847
02:21:04,551 --> 02:21:06,923
He escaped us before.

1848
02:21:07,095 --> 02:21:10,630
But he said Christ would replace me.
What sort of...?

1849
02:21:15,186 --> 02:21:16,301
They're singing.

1850
02:21:50,555 --> 02:21:52,880
These dogs have effrontery even in death.

1851
02:21:53,057 --> 02:21:55,015
The lions will sing louder, I think.

1852
02:23:26,693 --> 02:23:29,896
Oh, Peter, could our Lord
at least not have saved you?

1853
02:23:30,071 --> 02:23:34,151
Oh, Peter, why did you come back?

1854
02:23:34,993 --> 02:23:37,484
It was the Lord's will.

1855
02:23:37,954 --> 02:23:39,152
Nazarius is safe.

1856
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:41,786
Some good people sheltered him
outside the city.

1857
02:24:00,268 --> 02:24:05,345
Yes, sing to him
as he now opens his arms to you.

1858
02:24:05,523 --> 02:24:09,853
Sing to the welcome of Christ, our Lord.

1859
02:24:15,658 --> 02:24:18,695
More singing. Why aren't they afraid?

1860
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:20,364
They irritate me.

1861
02:24:20,538 --> 02:24:24,239
They should have been tortured first,
their insolence destroyed.

1862
02:24:24,626 --> 02:24:26,998
What of Marcus Vinicius
and the girl Lygia?

1863
02:24:27,170 --> 02:24:29,957
- Shall we bring them after these?
- Yes.

1864
02:24:30,131 --> 02:24:32,207
Alone, with one lion.

1865
02:24:32,383 --> 02:24:34,542
- The hungriest.
- Not yet, my lord.

1866
02:24:34,719 --> 02:24:38,717
I should like Vinicius and his little flower
held in reserve.

1867
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:41,262
I am planning something most unusual.

1868
02:24:41,434 --> 02:24:42,809
A surprise for you.

1869
02:24:42,977 --> 02:24:45,136
What is it, Poppaea? Tell me.

1870
02:24:45,313 --> 02:24:47,602
It will not be a surprise, then.

1871
02:24:47,774 --> 02:24:49,565
Please, Poppaea.

1872
02:24:49,734 --> 02:24:54,230
My lord, have I ever disappointed you
in conceiving new delights?

1873
02:24:54,948 --> 02:24:57,106
New thrills?

1874
02:24:58,451 --> 02:24:59,451
True.

1875
02:25:00,286 --> 02:25:01,864
You haven't.

1876
02:25:16,928 --> 02:25:18,339
Singing.

1877
02:25:18,513 --> 02:25:20,422
How can they?

1878
02:25:20,807 --> 02:25:23,049
It's beyond understanding.

1879
02:25:23,935 --> 02:25:27,138
Don't have the arena cleared
at the end of the day.

1880
02:25:27,313 --> 02:25:29,769
I'm most curious.

1881
02:25:44,289 --> 02:25:46,780
No face on this one at all.

1882
02:25:48,251 --> 02:25:51,418
Oh, look, there's another one smiling.

1883
02:25:52,172 --> 02:25:53,963
It's monstrous of them to die smiling.

1884
02:25:54,132 --> 02:25:55,792
It's inhuman.

1885
02:25:56,301 --> 02:25:58,377
Yet they look no different
from other people.

1886
02:25:58,553 --> 02:26:01,126
The man, Peter,
he put an evil spell on them.

1887
02:26:01,306 --> 02:26:02,306
Yes.

1888
02:26:02,932 --> 02:26:04,474
The man, Peter.

1889
02:26:04,642 --> 02:26:07,560
Something singular
must be done with him.

1890
02:26:25,163 --> 02:26:26,563
Marcus.

1891
02:26:27,832 --> 02:26:28,832
Yes?

1892
02:26:30,335 --> 02:26:34,249
Nothing do I see that is not perfection.

1893
02:26:36,674 --> 02:26:42,428
That night you said it, even though
you were most predatory about it...

1894
02:26:43,014 --> 02:26:46,513
...even then,
my heart must have told me:

1895
02:26:47,227 --> 02:26:50,393
"That is the man you will love."

1896
02:26:51,689 --> 02:26:56,186
Only, then, you wouldn't let me hear
my heart talking, Marcus.

1897
02:26:57,445 --> 02:27:00,232
I said a great deal, I remember.

1898
02:27:01,324 --> 02:27:04,195
All of it loud and empty.

1899
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:10,780
I would so love to have given you a son.

1900
02:27:12,961 --> 02:27:14,161
Lygia.

1901
02:27:15,296 --> 02:27:17,206
Oh, Marcus.

1902
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:21,760
No matter what,
I want to be your wife now.

1903
02:27:21,928 --> 02:27:25,095
- Peter will say the words over us.
- Lygia, you know l...

1904
02:27:25,265 --> 02:27:28,716
I want it to be that way
before they take us...

1905
02:27:28,893 --> 02:27:33,721
...so that it will be that way
when we are together again.

1906
02:27:37,986 --> 02:27:41,770
You would never wish me to pretend,
would you?

1907
02:27:41,948 --> 02:27:43,548
Pretend?

1908
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:46,867
That I feel myself Christian.

1909
02:27:47,745 --> 02:27:51,197
It's still strange, new.

1910
02:27:51,374 --> 02:27:53,497
There's something I can't quite...

1911
02:27:54,043 --> 02:27:55,668
I mean...

1912
02:27:59,132 --> 02:28:02,335
Yes, it's proven good...

1913
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:04,966
...full of courage, right here.

1914
02:28:05,930 --> 02:28:10,723
But there are many things
I cannot believe, understand.

1915
02:28:11,311 --> 02:28:14,228
Christ is within you, Marcus.

1916
02:28:14,731 --> 02:28:18,396
You feel him more strongly
than you know.

1917
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:21,820
Come.

1918
02:28:30,955 --> 02:28:32,155
Peter.

1919
02:28:37,128 --> 02:28:41,790
Before I die, I want to marry Marcus.

1920
02:28:44,844 --> 02:28:47,514
This is a holy thing, my son.

1921
02:28:49,474 --> 02:28:51,632
It concerns Lygia.

1922
02:28:51,976 --> 02:28:54,099
I look upon it as holy.

1923
02:28:57,774 --> 02:28:59,174
Marcus.

1924
02:29:00,401 --> 02:29:01,601
Lygia.

1925
02:29:02,862 --> 02:29:07,939
May he who blessed
the marriage at Cana bless you also.

1926
02:29:08,326 --> 02:29:11,327
Love one another
from this moment forward...

1927
02:29:11,496 --> 02:29:15,196
...as man and wife in his holy name.

1928
02:29:15,708 --> 02:29:20,916
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

1929
02:29:21,256 --> 02:29:23,663
In this life and the next...

1930
02:29:23,842 --> 02:29:26,379
...now and forevermore.

1931
02:29:32,225 --> 02:29:33,625
Marcus.

1932
02:29:34,727 --> 02:29:36,637
My husband.

1933
02:29:54,038 --> 02:29:55,581
Here he is, Your Majesty.

1934
02:29:55,748 --> 02:29:57,077
He meets with your approval?

1935
02:29:57,250 --> 02:29:58,293
Very much so.

1936
02:29:59,878 --> 02:30:01,751
It will be like a fresco from Crete.

1937
02:30:01,921 --> 02:30:04,626
The maiden sacrificed to the Minotaur.

1938
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:07,468
It will be a spectacle
worthy of the eyes of the emperor.

1939
02:30:07,635 --> 02:30:09,177
Superb conception.

1940
02:30:12,140 --> 02:30:15,094
You seem sad and restless,
my little black friend.

1941
02:30:15,268 --> 02:30:16,596
But do not grieve.

1942
02:30:16,769 --> 02:30:19,889
I promise you a rare playmate
for your lonely horns...

1943
02:30:20,064 --> 02:30:22,104
...to fondle and caress.

1944
02:30:26,738 --> 02:30:28,695
You are the man Peter?

1945
02:30:28,865 --> 02:30:31,652
I am Simon, called Peter.

1946
02:30:33,703 --> 02:30:37,072
"The man called Peter has been heard
to preach rebellion and blasphemy...

1947
02:30:37,248 --> 02:30:39,739
...against the rule
and the divinity of the emperor.

1948
02:30:39,918 --> 02:30:43,084
It is accordingly decreed
that he be taken to Vatican Hill...

1949
02:30:43,254 --> 02:30:46,125
...where it has been confessed
he made his first preachment...

1950
02:30:46,299 --> 02:30:49,549
...to be crucified and left there
as a warning to all and any...

1951
02:30:49,719 --> 02:30:53,302
...who henceforth
wish to call themselves Christians."

1952
02:30:55,809 --> 02:31:02,096
To die as our Lord died
is more than I deserve.

1953
02:31:03,399 --> 02:31:04,942
We can change that.

1954
02:31:33,638 --> 02:31:37,422
You'll notice, Divinity,
they've stopped singing.

1955
02:31:38,810 --> 02:31:40,269
They have, haven't they?

1956
02:31:52,323 --> 02:31:53,782
I seem to know that man.

1957
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:54,993
General Plautius.

1958
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:57,318
He conquered Parthia
and the north countries...

1959
02:31:57,495 --> 02:31:58,538
...when you were a boy.

1960
02:31:58,705 --> 02:32:02,240
Rome made him famous,
and he repaid her with treason.

1961
02:32:02,417 --> 02:32:03,792
What a dramatic reversal.

1962
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:06,332
Now he faces his first defeat.

1963
02:32:06,504 --> 02:32:08,413
I shall write a poem.

1964
02:32:11,384 --> 02:32:12,843
People of Rome.

1965
02:32:13,803 --> 02:32:16,923
I am Aulus Plautius...

1966
02:32:17,348 --> 02:32:19,922
...once general of your armies.

1967
02:32:20,643 --> 02:32:23,265
Rome is ruled by a monster...

1968
02:32:23,438 --> 02:32:27,767
...who tells you
the Christians burned Rome.

1969
02:32:27,942 --> 02:32:30,268
But he lies.

1970
02:32:30,945 --> 02:32:33,946
You lie, Nero.
You are the incendiary.

1971
02:32:35,116 --> 02:32:38,402
Nero kills Christians to deceive you.

1972
02:32:38,578 --> 02:32:40,654
He alone is guilty.

1973
02:32:40,830 --> 02:32:44,910
I swear it by my death and by my...

1974
02:32:51,382 --> 02:32:53,505
I begin to envy Petronius.

1975
02:32:53,676 --> 02:32:56,381
I have envied him long since.

1976
02:32:56,554 --> 02:32:59,555
I tell you,
this is a horrible blot on Roman justice.

1977
02:33:00,183 --> 02:33:02,555
The mob isn't as happy as it was.

1978
02:33:02,727 --> 02:33:04,387
Have you noticed?

1979
02:33:38,263 --> 02:33:41,263
<i>Save me.</i>

1980
02:33:54,779 --> 02:33:57,068
They are singing.

1981
02:34:22,891 --> 02:34:25,097
He said something to Nero.

1982
02:34:25,268 --> 02:34:27,640
I could not hear the words.

1983
02:34:29,939 --> 02:34:33,143
Nero's looking at a man
that knows how to die.

1984
02:35:05,225 --> 02:35:06,802
Take him.

1985
02:35:14,526 --> 02:35:16,269
Commander?

1986
02:35:18,029 --> 02:35:20,105
They're not parting us.

1987
02:35:25,328 --> 02:35:27,155
Prepare her.

1988
02:35:40,635 --> 02:35:43,387
Here, my lord, is our honored guest.

1989
02:35:43,555 --> 02:35:44,634
Vinicius?

1990
02:35:44,806 --> 02:35:48,222
- Why is he not in the arena?
- He will be, very much so.

1991
02:35:48,393 --> 02:35:49,721
In spirit.

1992
02:35:56,526 --> 02:35:58,400
It's a giant.

1993
02:36:01,072 --> 02:36:02,531
It's Hercules himself.

1994
02:36:02,699 --> 02:36:05,700
He has guarded the Lygian girl
from birth.

1995
02:36:05,869 --> 02:36:07,945
Now let us see him
guard her from death.

1996
02:36:08,121 --> 02:36:09,580
But what is the contest?

1997
02:36:31,269 --> 02:36:32,269
Look.

1998
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,601
They've brought Marcus here
to face this.

1999
02:36:34,772 --> 02:36:36,315
By the...

2000
02:36:56,294 --> 02:36:58,702
Do not fret, Vinicius.

2001
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:00,919
Remember, I said I did not hate her.

2002
02:37:01,424 --> 02:37:03,132
I wish her no pain.

2003
02:37:03,301 --> 02:37:05,673
Lasting pain, that is.

2004
02:37:06,221 --> 02:37:08,462
I am devastated dear Petronius
is not here...

2005
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:11,843
...to witness our pleasure, Vinicius.

2006
02:37:12,018 --> 02:37:15,054
"Sing no more," he said.

2007
02:37:15,814 --> 02:37:19,183
<i>Upon these lilies I heap now</i>

2008
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:24,299
<i>Red roses upon red</i>

2009
02:37:24,399 --> 02:37:26,571
<i>A blood-red tide shall surge</i>

2010
02:37:26,741 --> 02:37:33,141
<i>Upon her milk-white flesh</i>

2011
02:37:46,511 --> 02:37:49,132
Like your uncle,
you do have a certain amount of taste.

2012
02:37:49,305 --> 02:37:52,140
But I still think
that she's too narrow in the hips.

2013
02:37:52,308 --> 02:37:54,846
These people know how to die, Nero.

2014
02:37:55,019 --> 02:37:56,929
In death, you will squeal like a hog.

2015
02:37:57,522 --> 02:37:58,850
Give him the sword. Let him...

2016
02:37:59,023 --> 02:38:00,731
No, stay.

2017
02:38:01,025 --> 02:38:05,522
My lord, would you deprive him
of his final pleasure?

2018
02:38:22,672 --> 02:38:23,672
Ha!

2019
02:38:23,882 --> 02:38:26,040
Superb, Poppaea. Magnificent.

2020
02:39:35,703 --> 02:39:37,114
A fair contest.

2021
02:39:37,288 --> 02:39:39,744
Nero's justice is proverbial.

2022
02:39:56,349 --> 02:39:59,267
If the bull kills the giant,
so much for the girl.

2023
02:39:59,769 --> 02:40:03,767
But if our Hercules should be cruel enough
to destroy the poor animal...

2024
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:08,151
...I shall have to spare her life
for Vinicius.

2025
02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:10,478
To breed more Christians.

2026
02:41:08,630 --> 02:41:09,875
Christ.

2027
02:41:10,048 --> 02:41:12,373
Christ, give him strength.

2028
02:41:48,002 --> 02:41:49,497
Seize him.

2029
02:42:01,766 --> 02:42:04,340
- Burner of Rome!
- Thumbs up!

2030
02:42:04,519 --> 02:42:06,262
- Burner of Rome!
- Thumbs up!

2031
02:42:27,625 --> 02:42:30,911
Ready up there? First line, follow me.

2032
02:42:59,824 --> 02:43:01,983
Citizens of Rome.

2033
02:43:02,452 --> 02:43:04,326
I am Marcus Vinicius...

2034
02:43:04,496 --> 02:43:06,821
...commander of your 14th Legion.

2035
02:43:06,998 --> 02:43:08,955
This man who burned Rome...

2036
02:43:09,375 --> 02:43:11,664
...who killed innocents
for his own crime...

2037
02:43:12,128 --> 02:43:14,536
...the rule of this madman is ended.

2038
02:43:14,714 --> 02:43:17,170
Rome is yours again.

2039
02:43:17,383 --> 02:43:20,752
Tonight, General Galba
marches from the north.

2040
02:43:20,929 --> 02:43:23,170
Your army has risen.

2041
02:43:23,848 --> 02:43:25,342
Hail Galba.

2042
02:43:25,767 --> 02:43:28,602
Galba, new emperor of Rome.

2043
02:43:40,824 --> 02:43:42,297
- A sword from Plautius.
- Aah!

2044
02:44:57,484 --> 02:45:00,188
Where are the Praetorian Guard?

2045
02:45:00,737 --> 02:45:03,275
Dead or in revolt.

2046
02:45:03,448 --> 02:45:06,200
Dead, all dead.

2047
02:45:06,367 --> 02:45:11,113
My dear mother.
Octavia, the wife I loved.

2048
02:45:11,539 --> 02:45:15,288
My friend Petronius, all dead.

2049
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,460
Dead.

2050
02:45:26,387 --> 02:45:28,463
You alone are left.

2051
02:45:30,141 --> 02:45:32,715
Kill the Christians, you said.

2052
02:45:33,269 --> 02:45:34,894
It was you.

2053
02:45:35,063 --> 02:45:37,898
It was you who turned my people...

2054
02:45:39,192 --> 02:45:40,816
...my faithful subjects...

2055
02:45:42,362 --> 02:45:44,520
...against me.

2056
02:45:53,414 --> 02:45:58,014
You are my evil genius.

2057
02:46:37,709 --> 02:46:38,823
What are you doing here?

2058
02:46:39,002 --> 02:46:41,208
I banished you. I didn't recall you.

2059
02:46:42,505 --> 02:46:46,799
I told you that when you needed me,
I would come to you.

2060
02:46:46,968 --> 02:46:49,376
You defied me. Begone!

2061
02:46:59,189 --> 02:47:02,355
Acte, what will they do to me?

2062
02:47:02,525 --> 02:47:03,984
They will kill you.

2063
02:47:04,152 --> 02:47:06,061
But they won't get in.

2064
02:47:43,233 --> 02:47:45,806
You've lived like a monster.

2065
02:47:46,194 --> 02:47:51,319
Now die like an emperor,
by your own hand.

2066
02:47:51,533 --> 02:47:53,193
I didn't wish to be a monster.

2067
02:47:53,660 --> 02:47:55,035
The gods willed it.

2068
02:47:55,203 --> 02:47:57,575
Now, or they will find you here.

2069
02:48:01,376 --> 02:48:05,623
Is this, then, the end of Nero?

2070
02:48:05,797 --> 02:48:06,959
Yes, my lord.

2071
02:48:07,131 --> 02:48:11,212
To be lord of the earth
and my own executioner.

2072
02:48:11,386 --> 02:48:12,986
Quickly.

2073
02:48:13,471 --> 02:48:17,551
Oh, how dull, how tasteless life
will be for them without me.

2074
02:48:17,725 --> 02:48:19,469
How can they face such a world?

2075
02:48:19,644 --> 02:48:21,352
How can they endure it?

2076
02:48:21,521 --> 02:48:23,679
Now, my lord.

2077
02:48:31,406 --> 02:48:33,612
Help me, Acte.

2078
02:49:00,727 --> 02:49:02,470
Hail Galba. Hail.

2079
02:49:02,645 --> 02:49:04,603
Hail Galba.

2080
02:49:04,772 --> 02:49:06,812
Hail Galba.

2081
02:49:06,983 --> 02:49:09,183
Hail Galba.

2082
02:49:13,656 --> 02:49:15,199
Hail Galba.

2083
02:49:15,366 --> 02:49:16,366
Hail.

2084
02:49:18,828 --> 02:49:21,028
Hail Galba.

2085
02:49:25,668 --> 02:49:27,875
Galba has a task ahead of him.

2086
02:49:28,046 --> 02:49:31,047
To rebuild Rome
and bring back Roman justice.

2087
02:49:31,216 --> 02:49:35,379
I fear the glory that was Rome
will never fully be reached again, Marcus.

2088
02:49:36,429 --> 02:49:41,174
Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome.
What follows?

2089
02:49:41,768 --> 02:49:44,223
A more permanent world, I hope.

2090
02:49:44,604 --> 02:49:46,431
Or a more permanent faith.

2091
02:49:49,108 --> 02:49:51,231
One is not possible without the other.

2092
02:50:02,205 --> 02:50:04,079
What is it, commander?

2093
02:50:04,749 --> 02:50:07,999
It was right in this very spot
that Peter and I turned back to Rome.

2094
02:50:12,757 --> 02:50:15,426
It was here the Lord spoke to him.

2095
02:50:17,637 --> 02:50:20,093
It's a blessed spot.

2096
02:50:54,966 --> 02:51:01,467
<i>I am the way, the truth and the life.</i>

2097
02:54:19,838 --> 02:54:21,914
