1
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,547
Can I help you, ma'am?

2
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,843
Well, they told me to take
a streetcar named Desire...

3
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,513
...and then transfer
to one called Cemeteries...

4
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,725
...and ride six blocks
and get off at Elysian Fields.

5
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,060
There's your car now.

6
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,572
Thank you.

7
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,362
When he got home, she was waiting.

8
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,407
Boy, you never heard nothing like that.

9
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,081
What's the matter, honey?
You lost?

10
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,333
I'm looking for Elysian Fields.

11
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,128
This is Elysian Fields.
What number you looking for?

12
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,171
Six forty-two.

13
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,632
You don't need to look no further.

14
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,554
I'm looking for my sister, Stella DuBois.
I mean, Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.

15
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:46,058
Yeah, that's the party, all right.
You just did miss her, though.

16
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,977
This?

17
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,441
- Can this be her home?
- She got the downstairs. I got the up.

18
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,651
Oh, she's out?

19
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,154
You notice that bowling alley
up the street?

20
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,948
- I'm not sure I did.
- Well, that's where she's at, honey.

21
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,242
She's watching her husband bowl.

22
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,921
Blanche!

23
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,009
Blanche, honey!

24
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,763
- Stella. Oh, Stella for star!
- Blanche!

25
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,225
Oh, my darling. Now, let me look at you.
But don't you look at me, Stella. No, no!

26
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,562
- I won't be seen in this merciless glare.
- Did you find our place?

27
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,564
What are you doing in a place like that?

28
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,359
Never, never, never
in my worst dreams did I picture...

29
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,112
Only Poe. Only Mr. Edgar Allan Poe
could do justice to it.

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,239
What are you doing
in that horrible place?

31
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,575
Oh, what am I saying?
I didn't mean to say that.

32
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,995
I meant to be nice and say,
"What a convenient location," and such.

33
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,123
- You haven't said a word to me.
- You haven't given me a chance to.

34
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,835
- Open your pretty mouth and talk.
- Come say hello to Stanley first.

35
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,380
- No, not now. Not now.
- Just say hello.

36
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,716
Oh, which is he?
Which one is he?

37
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,892
- Is he the one that's...?
- The one that's making all the rhubarb.

38
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,311
Isn't he wonderful-looking?

39
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,153
Stella, I can't meet him now.
Not till I've bathed and rested.

40
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,907
- Would you like a cold drink?
- Oh, bless you for that lovely inspiration.

41
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,914
Oh, my baby, my baby.

42
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,750
Would you like some pop?

43
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,128
Honey. Pop?

44
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,630
Not with my nerves tonight.
Scotch for me, please.

45
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,424
Grape.

46
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,721
You haven't asked me how I got away
from school before the spring term ended.

47
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,474
I thought you'd volunteer that
information if you want to tell me.

48
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,934
You thought I'd been fired?

49
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,937
No. I thought you might have resigned.

50
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,483
Oh, I was so exhausted
by all I'd been through, my nerves broke.

51
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,738
I was on the verge of lunacy, almost.

52
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,156
So Mr. Graves...

53
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,324
Mr. Graves is the high school
superintendent.

54
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,118
Thank you. He suggested I...

55
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,121
I take a leave of absence.

56
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,373
I couldn't put all those
details into the wire.

57
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,625
This buzzes right through me
and feels so good.

58
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,754
- Would you like another?
- Uh-uh. One's my limit.

59
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,839
You haven't said a word
about my appearance.

60
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,884
- You look just fine.
- God love you for a liar.

61
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,636
Daylight never exposed so total a ruin.

62
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,056
But you...
You put on some weight. Yes.

63
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,684
You're just as plump as a little partridge.
It's so becoming to you too.

64
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,979
- Oh, Blanche.
- Yes, it is. Or I wouldn't say it. You...

65
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,982
...just have to
watch around the hips a little.

66
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,984
I want you to look at my
figure, you know?

67
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,236
I haven't put on one ounce
in 10 years, Stella.

68
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,531
I weigh now what I weighed
the summer you left Belle Reve.

69
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,658
The summer Dad died...

70
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,660
...and you left us.

71
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,377
It's just incredible, Blanche,
how well you look.

72
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,509
- Sure you wouldn't like another?
- Well...

73
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,261
Well, maybe I will just
take one tiny nip more.

74
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,348
Just to put the stopper on,
so to speak. Now, don't get worried.

75
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,726
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up...

76
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,355
...and hot and dirty and tired.

77
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,359
Waiter.

78
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,740
- You want it hot?
- Scalding.

79
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,621
- Stella.
- What is it, hon?

80
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,958
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.

81
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,876
We'll put you right here.

82
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,880
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?

83
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,341
- Feel all right?
- Wonderful, honey.

84
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,593
I don't like a bed that gives much.

85
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,180
Stella, there's no door between
the two rooms, and Stanley...

86
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,267
- Will it be decent?
- Oh, Stanley's Polish, you know.

87
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,602
Oh, yeah.
Something like Irish, isn't it?

88
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,229
Well...

89
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,858
I bought some nice clothes
to meet all your lovely friends in.

90
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,693
Well...

91
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,736
I'm afraid
you won't think they're lovely.

92
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,990
Well, anyway, I bought nice clothes
and I'll wear them.

93
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,577
I guess you're hoping I'll say
I'll put up at a hotel.

94
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,038
I'm not going to put up at a hotel.
I've got to be near you, Stella.

95
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,584
I've got to be with people.
I can't be alone because...

96
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,378
Because as you must have noticed, I...

97
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,380
I'm not very well.

98
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,300
You do seem a little...

99
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,677
Will Stanley like me...

100
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,097
...or will I just be a visiting in-law?
I couldn't stand that, Stella.

101
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,101
You'll get along fine together.
If you just try not to compare him...

102
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,520
- Oh, he was an officer?
- He was master sergeant...

103
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,523
...in the Engineers Corps,
decorated four times.

104
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,525
He had those on when you met him?

105
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,403
I assure you I wasn't just blinded
by all the brass.

106
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,655
- Oh, that's not what I...
- Of course, there...

107
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,575
There were things
to adjust myself to later on.

108
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,995
Such as his civilian background.

109
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,206
How did he take it
when you said I was coming?

110
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,292
- Oh, he's on the road a good deal.
- Oh, he travels?

111
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,003
- Mm-hm.
- Good. I mean, isn't it?

112
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,048
I can hardly stand it
when he's away for a night.

113
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,466
Oh, Stella.

114
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,968
When he's away for a week,
I nearly go wild.

115
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,387
- Gracious.
- When he comes back...

116
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,515
...I cry in his lap like a baby.

117
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,186
I guess that's what's meant
by being in love.

118
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,650
Stella.

119
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,530
I haven't asked you the things you
probably thought I was going to ask...

120
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,410
...so I'll expect you to be understanding
about what I have to tell you.

121
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,870
What, Blanche?

122
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:44,583
You'll reproach me. I know you're bound
to reproach me, but before you do...

123
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,003
...take into consideration you left.
I stayed and struggled.

124
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,547
You came to New Orleans
and looked out for yourself.

125
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,175
I stayed at Belle Reve
and tried to hold it together.

126
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,803
Oh, I'm not meaning this
in any reproachful way.

127
00:09:55,971 --> 00:10:00,099
- But the burden fell on my shoulders.
- Best I could do was make my own living.

128
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,685
But you were the one
that abandoned Belle Reve, not I.

129
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,020
I fought for it,
bled for it, almost died for it.

130
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,022
Stop this outburst.
Tell me what happened.

131
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,193
- I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
- About what? Please!

132
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:17,283
The loss.

133
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,703
Belle Reve? Lost, is it?

134
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes, Stella.

135
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,043
But how did it go? What happened?

136
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,463
- You're a fine one to ask me how it went.
- Blanche.

137
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,008
You're a fine one to stand there
accusing me of it.

138
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,760
- I won't stay in this house.
- Blanche!

139
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,935
- Blanche.
- I... I... I took the blows...

140
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,021
...on my face and my body.

141
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:51,442
All of those deaths,
the long parade to the graveyard.

142
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,696
Father, Mother,
Margaret, that dreadful way...

143
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,407
You just came home
in time for funerals, Stella.

144
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,243
And funerals are pretty
compared to deaths.

145
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,830
How do you think all that sickness
and dying was paid for?

146
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,166
Death is expensive, Miss Stella.

147
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,919
And I, with my pitiful salary
at the school...

148
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,838
Yes, accuse me.

149
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,050
Stand there and stare at me,
thinking I let the place go.

150
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,594
I let the place go? Where were you?

151
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,014
- In there with your Polack.
- Blanche, be still. That's enough.

152
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,851
- Stella. Stella, you're crying?
- Does that surprise you?

153
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,688
Mitch, we gonna play
at your house tomorrow?

154
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,899
No, not at my house.
My mother's still sick.

155
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,693
- All right, you bring the beer.
WOMAN: Break it up down there.

156
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,280
- I made that spaghetti and ate it myself.
- Now, honey, I told you...

157
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,949
...and told you
we were playing Jack's beer.

158
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,787
What's so funny?
You never phoned me once.

159
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,039
I told you at breakfast.
I phoned you at lunch.

160
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,832
Why don't you get yourself in here!

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,417
Do you want it in the newspapers?

162
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,461
I'm sick and tired of chasing you.

163
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,146
You must be Stanley.

164
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm Blanche.

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,192
Oh, you're Stella's sister.

166
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,944
Yes.

167
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,029
Oh, hiya.

168
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,948
Yeah, where's the little woman?

169
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,992
- In the bathroom.
- Oh.

170
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,832
- Well, where you from, Blanche?
- Why, I...

171
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,375
I live in Auriol.

172
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,044
In Auriol. Auriol, huh?

173
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,798
Oh, yeah, that's right. Auriol.
That's not my territory.

174
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,176
Man, liquor goes fast
in the hot weather.

175
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,721
- You want a shot?
- No, I rarely touch it.

176
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,892
Well, there's some people that rarely
touch it, but it touches them often.

177
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,942
Mind if I make myself
comfortable? My shirt is sticking...

178
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,819
Please. Please do.

179
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,363
"Be comfortable." That's my motto,
where I come from.

180
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,242
It's mine too. It's hard to stay
looking fresh in hot weather.

181
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,661
Why, I haven't washed
or even powdered...

182
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,705
...and here you are.

183
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,168
You gotta be careful. You sitting around
in a damp thing, you catch a cold.

184
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,546
Especially when you been
exercising hard, like bowling is.

185
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,217
- Well, you're the teacher, aren't you?
- Yes.

186
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,721
- What do you teach?
- English.

187
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,348
Well, I never was
a very good English student.

188
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,270
- How long you here for?
- Why, I don't know yet.

189
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,938
You gonna shack up here?

190
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,901
I thought I would,
if it's not inconvenient for you all.

191
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,153
Good.

192
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,283
Traveling wears me out.

193
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,118
Well, take it easy.

194
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,746
What was that?

195
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,166
Oh, those cats.

196
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:03,509
Hey, Stella.
What did you do, fall asleep in there?

197
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,594
Huh?

198
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,641
Well, I guess I'm gonna strike you
as being the unrefined type, huh?

199
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,271
You know,
Stella spoke a good deal about you.

200
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,566
She said you were married once,
weren't you?

201
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,281
Yes.

202
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,076
When I was quite young.

203
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,702
Yeah? What happened?

204
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,455
The boy...

205
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,083
The boy died.

206
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,142
I'm afraid I...

207
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,312
I'm going to be sick.

208
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,775
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

209
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,833
- Looks like she's staying a while.
- Yeah.

210
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,002
- Hey, Stan, are we playing tonight?
- Yeah.

211
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,336
Well, I figured maybe we...

212
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,672
- Forget about maybe. It's the same.
- Stanley!

213
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,257
- Oh, hi, Steve.
- Put it down.

214
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,509
- Now I'll go get the other one?
- Yes.

215
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,720
- Thanks, darling.
- Stella?

216
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,929
Yes?

217
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,347
Is that Stanley back with my trunk?

218
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,224
- Yes, Blanche.
- Honey...

219
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,020
...will you get my blue net out for me?
- All right, Blanche.

220
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,564
It was so good of Stanley to call for my trunk.

221
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,025
He was glad to do it.

222
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,694
- I'll see you later.
- All right. Listen, don't forget.

223
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,655
Honey, I'm taking Blanche
to Galatoire's for supper tonight...

224
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,241
...and then to a show
because it's your poker night.

225
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,202
How about my supper?
I'm not going to Galatoire's tonight.

226
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,371
I put you a cold plate on ice.

227
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,541
I'm gonna try to keep Blanche
out until the party breaks up.

228
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,753
- I don't know how she'll take it.
- Isn't that just dandy?

229
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,880
So you'd better give me some money.

230
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey, where is she now?

231
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,551
She's soaking in a hot tub
to quiet her nerves.

232
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,345
She's terribly upset.

233
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,888
Over what?

234
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,433
She's been through such an ordeal.
We lost Belle Reve.

235
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,394
- What, the place in the country?
- Uh-huh.

236
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,230
- Well, how?
- It had to be sacrificed or something.

237
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,151
Honey, look. When she comes in, say
something nice about her appearance.

238
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,029
And, oh, don't mention the baby.

239
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,949
I haven't said anything yet. I'm waiting
until she gets in a quieter condition.

240
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,578
- Try to understand her and be nice to her.
- All right.

241
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,872
She wasn't expecting
to find us in such a place.

242
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,375
- All right.
- I tried to gloss things over a little...

243
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,668
...in my letters.

244
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,962
Admire her dress.
Tell her she's looking wonderful.

245
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,882
It's important to Blanche.
Her little weakness.

246
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,635
Okay, honey, I get the idea, but...

247
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,347
Now, let's just skip back a little, the way
you said the place was disposed of.

248
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,765
Oh, yeah.

249
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,643
Well, how about
a few more details on that subject?

250
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,814
Honey, look, it's best not to talk much
about it until she's calmed down.

251
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,193
Is that gonna be the deal? Sister Blanche
can't be annoyed with details right now?

252
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,529
Well, you saw how she was last night.

253
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,074
I saw how she was. Now, let's
cop a gander at the bill of sale.

254
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,201
I haven't seen any.

255
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,871
What do you mean? She didn't show you
papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?

256
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,957
Seemed like it wasn't sold.

257
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,584
Well, now, what was it, then?
Giveaway to charity?

258
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,962
- Shh. She'll hear you.
- I don't care if she hears me.

259
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,006
- Now, let's see the papers.
- Honey, there weren't any papers.

260
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,427
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.

261
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,055
Wait. Now, listen, did you ever hear
of the Napoleonic Code, Stella?

262
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,517
- I haven't heard of the Napoleonic Code.
- All right. Okay, then.

263
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,562
- Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
- Yes?

264
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,482
We got here in the state of Louisiana
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

265
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,986
According to which, what belongs to
the wife belongs to the husband also...

266
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,571
...and vice versa.

267
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,322
Will you listen.

268
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,700
Take, for instance, I had
that piece of property...

269
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,327
My head is swimming.

270
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,914
Oh, well, all right, dear.

271
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,416
Okay.

272
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,419
We'll wait till she's through
soaking in the hot tub...

273
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,214
...then I'm gonna inquire if she's
acquainted with the Napoleonic Code.

274
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,425
Oh, Stanley, don't be so silly.

275
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,595
It looks to me like you been swindled.
And when you get swindled...

276
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,140
...under Napoleonic Code, I get swindled
too. I don't like to get swindled.

277
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,558
Oh, Stanley...

278
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,352
...you've no idea how ridiculous
you're being...

279
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,229
...when you suggest that my sister...

280
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,192
...or I or anyone else of our family could
have perpetrated a swindle on anyone.

281
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,612
Oh, come on, now. Where's the money
if the place was sold?

282
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,864
Not sold. Lost!

283
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,324
- Lost.
- Come here.

284
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:41,036
- Stanley. Ow!
- Will you open your eyes to this stuff?

285
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,039
- What, she got this out of teacher's pay?
- Oh, hush.

286
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:48,043
Look at these fine feathers and furs
that she comes to preen herself in here?

287
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,171
What is this article?
That's a solid-gold dress, I believe.

288
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,716
- Oh, honest.
- This one here. What is that, a fox piece?

289
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,469
- Stanley!
- A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.

290
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,846
Where are your fox pieces?

291
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,433
This is bushy snow-white ones, no less.
Where are your white fox furs?

292
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,395
Those are inexpensive summer furs
that Blanche has had a long time.

293
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,482
I have an acquaintance who deals
in this sort of merchandise.

294
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,069
- He's coming to make an appraisal.
- Don't be such an idiot, Stanley.

295
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:18,323
Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's
a thousand dollars invested in this stuff.

296
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,409
Well, now, what is that?
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?

297
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,830
- Oh, Stanley. Would you...?
- That's pearls, Stella. Ropes of them.

298
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,707
What is this sister of yours,
a deep-sea diver?

299
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,919
Bracelets, solid gold. Where are
your pearls and gold bracelets?

300
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,462
Be still, Stanley.

301
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,714
And here. Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.

302
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,468
A rhinestone tiara
she wore to a costume ball.

303
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,263
- What is rhinestone?
- Next door to glass.

304
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,722
Yeah.

305
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,976
I have an acquaintance who works in
a jewelry store and he's coming...

306
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,894
...to make an appraisal of that stuff.

307
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:53,233
- Here's your plantation fella, right here.
- You know I... Stupid and horrid.

308
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,570
You stay away from these things
before she comes out of the bathroom.

309
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,573
The Kowalskis and the DuBois
got a different notion on this.

310
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,451
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

311
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,871
Go ahead.

312
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,376
You come on out with me
while Blanche is getting dressed.

313
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,170
Now, since when
are you giving me orders?

314
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,465
Are you gonna stay here
and insult her?

315
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,968
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.

316
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,652
Hello, Stanley.

317
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,783
Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a brand-new human being.

318
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,368
Oh, that's good.

319
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:50,790
Will you excuse me
while I put on my pretty new dress?

320
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,626
Go ahead.

321
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,345
Oh.

322
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,772
Thank you.

323
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,664
I understand there's to be
a little card party here tonight...

324
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,084
...to which we ladies
are cordially not invited.

325
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,543
That's right.

326
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,421
Where...? Where is Stella?

327
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,716
She's out there on the porch.

328
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,892
I'm going to ask a favor of you
in a moment.

329
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,729
Well, now, what's that gonna be,
I wonder.

330
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,148
Some buttons in back.

331
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,901
You may enter.

332
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,906
How do I look?

333
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,658
You look okay.

334
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,160
Well, thanks. Now the button.

335
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,626
Well, I can't do no more with them.

336
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,795
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

337
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,965
- May I have a drag on your cig?
- Yeah, have one for yourself.

338
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,009
Why, thank you. It...

339
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,803
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

340
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,472
Me and Stella was helping you unpack.

341
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,809
You certainly did a fast
and thorough job of it.

342
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,354
Well, certainly looks like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris, Blanche.

343
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,273
Clothes are my passion.

344
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,775
How much does it cost
for a string of furs like that?

345
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,111
Why, these were a tribute
from an admirer of mine.

346
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,071
He must have had a lot of admiration.

347
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,074
In my youth I excited some admiration,
but look at me now.

348
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:52,120
Would you think it possible that I
was once considered to be attractive?

349
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,831
Your looks are okay.

350
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,001
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go for that stuff.

351
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,378
- What stuff?
- Compliments to women about looks.

352
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:04,424
I never met a dame didn't know she was
good-looking or not without being told.

353
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,719
And some of them give themselves
credit for more than they've got.

354
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,972
I once went out with a dame
who told me, "I'm the glamorous type."

355
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,309
She says, "I am the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

356
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,270
- And what did she say then?
- She didn't say nothing.

357
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,356
- That shut her up like a clam.
- Did it end the romance?

358
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,443
Well, it ended the conversation,
that was all.

359
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,654
There's some men that are took in
by this Hollywood glamour stuff...

360
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,325
...and there's some men that aren't.
- You belong in the second category.

361
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,994
- That's right.
- I can't imagine any witch of a woman...

362
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,163
...casting a spell over you.
- That's right.

363
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,665
You're simple,
straightforward and honest.

364
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,835
A little bit on the primitive side,
I should think.

365
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,339
- To interest you a woman would have to...
- To lay her cards on the table.

366
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,175
Well, I never did care
for wishy-washy people.

367
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,178
That was why when you walked
in last night, I said to myself:

368
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,555
"My sister has married a man."
Of course.

369
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,433
- That was all I could tell...
- How about cutting the rebop!

370
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,810
Stanley!

371
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,022
Come on outside with me
and let Blanche finish dressing.

372
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,108
- I'm finished dressing.
- Then come on out.

373
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,360
- Your sister and I are having a talk.
- Honey...

374
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,488
...run to the drugstore and get me
a lemon Coke with chipped ice.

375
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,449
Will you do that for me,
sweetie, please? Please.

376
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,702
All right.

377
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,793
Poor thing was out there listening to us.

378
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,547
And I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

379
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,677
All right now, Mr. Kowalski, let us
proceed without any more digression.

380
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,639
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.

381
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,391
What is it?

382
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,480
In the state of Louisiana we got here
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

383
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,860
Which says, what belongs to the wife
belongs to the husband and vice versa.

384
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,362
My, but you have
an impressive judicial air.

385
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,408
If I didn't know that you was my wife's
sister, I would get ideas about you.

386
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:59,414
- Such as what?
- Don't play so dumb. You know what.

387
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,418
All right. Cards on the table.

388
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:09,215
I know I fib a good deal. After all,
a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion.

389
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,969
But when a thing is important
I tell the truth.

390
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,637
And this is the truth:

391
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:20,101
I never cheated my sister, or you, or
anyone else on earth as long as I lived.

392
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,606
- Where are the papers, in your trunk?
- Everything I own is in that trunk.

393
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:31,237
What are you thinking of? What's in the
back of that little boy's mind of yours?

394
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,448
Let me do that.
It'll be faster and simple.

395
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:38,369
- I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
- What are those underneath?

396
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,415
Those are love letters...

397
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,834
...yellowing with antiquity...

398
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,213
...all from one boy. Give those back.
- I'm just gonna have a look.

399
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,466
- The touch of your hands insults them.
- Now, don't pull that stuff.

400
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:55,386
Now that you've touched them,
I'll burn them.

401
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,805
What are they?

402
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,227
Poems the dead boy wrote.

403
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,314
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me. But you can't.

404
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:11,569
I'm not young and vulnerable anymore,
but my young husband was, and I...

405
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,614
Never mind about that.

406
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,325
Just give them back to me.

407
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,497
Thank you.

408
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,000
What'd you mean by saying
you have to burn them up?

409
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,211
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,506
I must have lost my head for a moment.

411
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:35,927
Everyone has something they won't
let others touch because of their...

412
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,429
Their intimate nature.

413
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,021
Ambler and Ambler.

414
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,023
Crabtree.

415
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,360
- More Ambler and Ambler.
- What's Ambler and Ambler?

416
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,153
A firm that made loans on the place.

417
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,115
- It was lost on a mortgage.
- That must have been what happened.

418
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,034
I don't want if, ands or buts.
What's the rest of the papers?

419
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,705
There are thousands of papers
stretching back over hundreds of years...

420
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,164
...affecting Belle Reve...

421
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,126
...as piece by piece,
our improvident grandfathers...

422
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,712
...exchanged the land
for their epic debauches...

423
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,338
...to put it mildly.

424
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,550
Until finally, all that was left...
And Stella can verify that.

425
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,051
- Was the house itself.

426
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,805
And about 20 acres of ground,
including a graveyard...

427
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,934
...to which now all but Stella
and I have retreated.

428
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,438
Here they are, all of them.
All papers.

429
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,900
I endow you with them. Take them,
peruse them, commit them to memory.

430
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,403
I think it's wonderfully fitting
that Belle Reve...

431
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,407
...should finally be this bunch of old
papers in your big, capable hands.

432
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,538
I wonder if Stella's
come back with my lemon Coke.

433
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,584
I got a lawyer acquaintance,
we'll study this out.

434
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,629
Present them to him
with a box of aspirin tablets.

435
00:27:55,299 --> 00:28:00,762
Under the Napoleonic Code a man has got
to take an interest in his wife's affairs.

436
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,431
And I mean especially now
that she's gonna have a baby.

437
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,436
Stella?

438
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,856
Stella, going to have a baby?

439
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,405
I didn't know
she was going to have a baby.

440
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,329
Stella.

441
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:32,627
Oh, Stella for star,
how lovely to have a baby.

442
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,254
Honey, everything's all right.

443
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,881
We thrashed it out.

444
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,342
I feel a bit shaky,
but I think I handled it nicely.

445
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,552
I laughed and treated it all as a joke.

446
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,389
I laughed and called him a little boy
and flirted. Here.

447
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,808
I was flirting with your husband, Stella.

448
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,143
The guests are gathering
for the poker party.

449
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,149
- Hi, Stella.
- Hi, Steve.

450
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,153
I'm sorry he did that to you.

451
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:04,367
Why, I guess he's just not the type
that goes for jasmine perfume.

452
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:08,371
Maybe he's what we need to mix with
our blood now we've lost Belle Reve...

453
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,291
...and have to go on
without Belle Reve to protect us.

454
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,921
Oh, how pretty the sky is.

455
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,965
I ought to go there on a rocket...

456
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,800
...that never comes down.

457
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,094
Which way do we go now, Stella?

458
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,720
This way?

459
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,931
No, hon, this way.

460
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,184
The blind are leading the blind.

461
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,603
Red hots!

462
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,791
Are you going upstairs
and tell her to cut that out?

463
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,419
If I go up, I won't come down.
Let's just forget it.

464
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,174
Remember that night she poured boiling
water through them cracks in the floor?

465
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,562
I gotta go home pretty soon.

466
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,606
- Come on, what do you say?
- No, I'm out.

467
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,358
Every time you win a big pot,
you're out like stout.

468
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,652
I got a sick mother
and she don't go to sleep...

469
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,738
...until I get in.
- What do you say?

470
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,406
I'm gonna wash up.

471
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,703
- Stella?
- Yes, Eunice?

472
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,040
You tell them guys
the kettle's on the stove.

473
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,417
I'm gonna break up the game.

474
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:40,463
- What did she mean by that?
- She'll pour it straight through the cracks.

475
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,216
Stella, wait. Wait till I powder.

476
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,926
I feel so hot and frazzled.

477
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,595
- Do I look done in?
- You look as fresh as a daisy.

478
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,389
One that's been picked a few days.

479
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,936
Why don't someone go to the Chinaman's
and bring back a load of chop suey?

480
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,773
- I'm losing and you want to eat.
- Well, I see you boys are still at it.

481
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,025
- Where you been?
- Blanche and I took in a show.

482
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,819
Blanche, honey, this is Mr. Gonzalez
and Mr. Hubbell.

483
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,988
How do you do?
Please don't get up.

484
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,324
Nobody's getting up here,
so don't get worried.

485
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,953
- Poker is so fascinating. Could I kibitz?
- You could not.

486
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,288
Why don't you women
go on up to Eunice's?

487
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,374
How long's this game going to continue?

488
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,625
Till we get ready to quit.

489
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,794
You should call it quits
after one more hand.

490
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,797
- Go up to Eunice's.
- Hey, that's my coat.

491
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,009
That's not fun, Stanley.

492
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,931
It makes me so mad
when he does that in front of people.

493
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,308
- I think I'll go bathe.
- Again?

494
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,811
My nerves are in knots.
Is the bathroom occupied?

495
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,312
I don't know.

496
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,773
- Oh, good evening.
- Oh, hello.

497
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,901
Blanche, this is Harold Mitchell.

498
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,362
- This is my sister, Blanche DuBois.
- How do you do.

499
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,448
- How do you do, Miss DuBois.
- How's your mother now, Mitch?

500
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,158
Oh, she's about the same, thanks.

501
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,995
She appreciated your
sending over that custard.

502
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,872
Oh, excuse me, please.

503
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,417
Excuse me.

504
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:13,014
- That one seems superior to the others.
- Does he?

505
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,059
- I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
- His mother's sick.

506
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,770
- Is he married?
- No.

507
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,357
- Is he a wolf?
- Why, Blanche.

508
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,694
- Well, no, I don't think he would be.
- What does he do?

509
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,197
He's on the Precision Bench
in the Spare Parts Department.

510
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,408
The plant that Stanley travels for.

511
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,702
- Is that something much?
- No.

512
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,788
Stanley's the only one in his crowd
likely to get any work.

513
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,420
Hey, Blanche,
you're standing in the light.

514
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,381
Am I? Gracious.

515
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,635
You ought to see their wives.

516
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,387
Oh, I can imagine.
Big, beefy things, I suppose.

517
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,681
- Do you know that one upstairs?
- Oh, yes.

518
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,600
Well, one night...

519
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,895
And the plaster...!

520
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,480
Hey, you hens!

521
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,650
- Cut out that cackling in there.
- You can't hear us.

522
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,111
Well, you can hear me,
and I told you to hush up.

523
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,113
Stella.

524
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,909
Look, this is my house
and I'll talk as much as I want to.

525
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:19,121
- Stella, don't start a row.
- Oh, he's half-drunk.

526
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,332
I'll be out in a minute.

527
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,442
What do you say, Mitch?

528
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,279
- Come on, Mitch, are you in?
- Huh?

529
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,823
No, I'm out.

530
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,658
Who turned that on in there?

531
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,453
- I did. Do you mind?
- Well, turn it off!

532
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,623
Come on, will you?
Let the girls have their music?

533
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,500
Stanley!

534
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,009
There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!

535
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,053
- Didn't I name it?
- I wasn't listening.

536
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,221
What were you doing?

537
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,098
Looking through the drapes.

538
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,475
- I wasn't.
- We're gonna play.

539
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,978
We're gonna deal this hand again,
play cards or quit.

540
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,271
Deal me out.

541
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,315
All right, this game's gonna be
Spit in the Ocean.

542
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,659
Yes?

543
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,495
Oh, hello.

544
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,460
Excuse me.

545
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,963
The little boy's room
is occupied right now.

546
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,840
Oh, excuse me.

547
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,343
- Have you got any cigs?
- Oh, sure.

548
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,514
Oh, what a... What a pretty case.

549
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,475
- Silver?
- Yes.

550
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,226
Yes, read the inscription.

551
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,520
Oh, there is an inscription.

552
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,939
Why, I can't make it out.

553
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:16,113
"And if God choose...

554
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,367
...I shall but love thee better
after death."

555
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,370
Why, that's from my
favorite sonnet by Mrs. Browning.

556
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,539
- Why, you know it.
- Certainly, I do.

557
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,501
Well, there's a story connected
with this inscription.

558
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,127
It sounds like a romance.

559
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,547
No, no, it's a pretty sad one.
The girl's dead now.

560
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,177
She knew she was dying when she give
me this. A very strange girl, very sweet.

561
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,680
- Very...
- She must have been very fond of you.

562
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,725
Sick people have such
deep, sincere attachments.

563
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,270
- That's right. They certainly do.
- Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.

564
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,022
It sure brings it out in people.

565
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,234
The little there is belongs to people
who have known some sorrow.

566
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,237
- I believe you're right about that.
- Oh, I'm positive I am.

567
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,491
- Hey, Mitch!
- Deal me out. I'm talking to Miss...?

568
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,538
DuBois.

569
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,414
It's a French name.

570
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,708
It means "woods,"
and Blanche means "white"...

571
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,877
...so the two together mean
"white woods"...

572
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,671
...like an orchard in spring.

573
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,798
You can remember it by that...

574
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,383
...if you care to.

575
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,760
You are Stella's sister, are you not?

576
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,471
Yes. Stella is my precious little sister.

577
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,100
I call her little in spite of the fact
that she's somewhat older than I am.

578
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,685
Oh.

579
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,564
Oh, just slightly. Less than a year.
Will you do something for me?

580
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,940
Sure. Yes, what?

581
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:36,777
I bought this adorable little paper lantern
at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.

582
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,988
Put it over the light bulb.
Will you, please?

583
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,573
I'd be glad to.

584
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,785
I can't stand a naked light bulb
any more than I can a rude remark...

585
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,662
...or a vulgar action.

586
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,666
Well, I guess we strike you as being
a pretty rough bunch.

587
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,378
Oh, I'm very adaptable to circumstances.

588
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,630
Well, that's a good way to be.

589
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,634
- You're not...?
- Married?

590
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,971
Oh, no.
No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher.

591
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,683
You may be a schoolteacher,
but you're certainly not an old maid.

592
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,895
Why, thank you, sir.

593
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,647
I appreciate your gallantry.

594
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,985
So you're in the teaching profession.

595
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,778
Yes.

596
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,197
- Yes.
- Grade school or high school...?

597
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,742
- Hey, Mitch!
- Coming!

598
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,827
Gracious, what lung power.

599
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,662
I teach high school in Auriol.

600
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,457
Well, what do you teach?
What subject?

601
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:35,711
- You guess.
- Well, I bet you teach art or music.

602
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,839
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Well, of course, I could be wrong.

603
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,507
You might teach arithmetic.

604
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,135
Never arithmetic, sir.
Never arithmetic.

605
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,512
I don't know
my multiplication tables. Nope.

606
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,098
I have the misfortune
of being an English instructor.

607
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,684
I attempt to instill
a bunch of bobbysoxers...

608
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:54,063
...and drugstore Romeos
with a reverence for Hawthorne...

609
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,856
...and Whitman and Poe.

610
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,692
Well, I bet some of them
are more interested in other things.

611
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,736
How very right you are.

612
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,865
Their literary heritage is not
what they treasure above all else.

613
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,492
But they're sweet things...

614
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,956
...and in the spring it's touching to see
them making their first discovery of love...

615
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,377
...as if nobody had ever known it before.

616
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,587
Oh.

617
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:23,801
- Sorry. Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
- Have you finished?

618
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:28,430
- Oh, yes. Yes, I have.
- Wait, wait. I'll turn on the radio.

619
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,059
Turn on the light above now.

620
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,396
Oh, look.

621
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,232
We've made enchantment.

622
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,454
- Three bullets, mustache.
- Straight! I gotcha!

623
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:58,085
- Stanley! Stanley!
What are you doing with the radio?

624
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,588
Drunk! Drunk animal thing!

625
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,424
- Get out!
- Hey!

626
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,759
- Go on, get out!
- Hey!

627
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,303
Let go of her!

628
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,764
My sister is gonna have a baby!

629
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,813
You come on up to my place, honey.

630
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,441
Sister, did he hurt you, darling?

631
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,111
Poker should not be played
in a house with women.

632
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,239
- All right, take it easy, will you?
- Look out.

633
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,201
Get him in that shower.

634
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,455
- Look out.
- Get him in that shower, I said!

635
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,166
Come on, all right.
Get his feet, will you? Get his feet!

636
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,501
Grab his feet, come on, take it easy.

637
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,545
Come on, boy. Get under there.

638
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,297
Come on.

639
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,507
Get under there. There you go.

640
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,636
How do you feel, Stan?

641
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,806
Stanley, wake up!
Hey, Stanley!

642
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,933
We ought to get his clothes off and...

643
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,561
STANLEY:
Hey! What do you think...!

644
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,361
Poker should not be played
in a house with women!

645
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,322
Aw, come on!

646
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,992
Hey! Where's Steve? Come on.

647
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,078
Wait. Come here. Take it easy.

648
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:34,515
Stella.

649
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,186
Honey?

650
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,564
Hey, Stella?

651
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,319
Honey, where are you?

652
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,573
Stella?

653
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,709
Hey, baby...

654
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,557
Look, you can sleep over here, Stella.
Blanche can have Steve's place.

655
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,893
He ain't coming home tonight
if he knows what's good for him.

656
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,063
Is my baby up there? I want her...

657
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,316
Look, she ain't coming down
and she ain't gonna talk to you neither...

658
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,819
...so you might just as well
not call her!

659
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,121
Hey, Stella!

660
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,373
You quit that howling down there
and go to bed!

661
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,208
Eunice, I want my girl down here!

662
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,418
You shut up!

663
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,378
- You're gonna get the law on you.
- Stella!

664
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,964
You can't beat on a woman
and then call her back.

665
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,257
You're gonna have a baby.

666
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,510
I hope they haul you in, turn a fire hose
on you like the last time!

667
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,971
- I want my girl down here!
- You stinker!

668
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:09,193
Hey, Stella!

669
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,330
I wouldn't mix in this.

670
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,060
Don't ever leave me, baby.

671
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,328
Blanche, come back!

672
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,273
Miss DuBois?

673
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,567
Miss DuBois?

674
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,110
Oh.

675
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,406
All quiet along the Potomac now?

676
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,950
She ran down here
and went back in there with him.

677
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,660
- Sure she did.
- I'm terrified.

678
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,538
Nothing to be scared of.
They're crazy about each other.

679
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,915
It's a shame this had to happen
when you got here.

680
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,917
- Violence is so...
- Sit down on the steps...

681
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,253
...and have a cigarette with me.
- Why...

682
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,880
...I'm not properly dressed.

683
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,549
Well, that don't make no difference
in the Quarter.

684
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:41,762
Such a pretty silver case.

685
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,306
I showed you the inscription, didn't I?

686
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,766
Yes.

687
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,273
So much...

688
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,735
So much confusion in the world.

689
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,947
Thank you for being so kind.

690
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,950
I need kindness now.

691
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,252
Bananas!

692
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:18,632
Bananas!

693
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,599
Stella?

694
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,518
Hm?

695
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,482
Stella. Oh, my baby.
My baby sister.

696
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,734
Why, angel, what's the matter with you?

697
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,112
- He left?
- Stan? Mm-hm.

698
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,571
Will he be back?

699
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,990
- He's gone to get the car greased, why?
- Why?

700
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,744
I've been half-crazy, Stella. How could
you come back to this place last night?

701
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:51,581
Please, Blanche. He was as good
as a lamb when I came back.

702
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,210
- He's really very ashamed of himself.
- And that...

703
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,712
- That makes it all right?
- No.

704
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:01,133
Stanley's always smashed things.

705
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:05,095
On our wedding night,
as soon as we came in here...

706
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,055
...he snatched off one of my slippers...

707
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,100
...and rushed about the place smashing
the light bulbs with it.

708
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,144
He did what?

709
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,523
He smashed all the light bulbs
with the heel of my slipper.

710
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,067
And you let him?
Didn't run, didn't scream?

711
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,697
I was sort of thrilled by it.

712
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,700
Eunice and you had breakfast?

713
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,870
Oh, do you suppose
I wanted any breakfast?

714
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,789
You're so matter-of-fact
about it all, Stella.

715
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,542
What other can I be?

716
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,253
He's taken the radio to get it fixed.

717
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:42,090
It didn't land on the pavement,
so only one tube was smashed.

718
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,384
And you standing there smiling.

719
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,927
What do you want me to do?

720
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,971
Pull yourself together. Face the facts.

721
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,514
What are they in your opinion?

722
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,350
In my opinion,
you're married to a madman.

723
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,187
I've got a plan for us both,
to get us both out of here.

724
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,773
I wish you'd stop taking it for granted
I'm in something I wanna get out of.

725
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,277
I take it you have sufficient
memory of Belle Reve to find this place...

726
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,654
...and these poker players impossible
to live with.

727
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,657
- You take too much for granted.
- I can't believe you're in earnest.

728
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,993
- No?
- I understand what happened a little.

729
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,829
You saw him first in uniform,
an officer, not here.

730
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,540
I'm not sure it makes
any difference where I saw him.

731
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,252
What you're talking about is desire,
just brutal desire.

732
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,756
The name of that rattletrap streetcar
that bangs through the Quarter.

733
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,091
Up one old, narrow street
and down another.

734
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,178
Haven't you ever ridden
on that streetcar?

735
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,933
It brought me here.

736
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,352
Where I'm not wanted...

737
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,187
...and where I'm ashamed to be.

738
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,607
Don't you think your superior attitude's
a little out of place?

739
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,859
- A man like that...
- I told you I love him.

740
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,736
I tremble for you, I just tremble.

741
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,780
- Hi, Stanley.
- Hi.

742
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,794
May I speak plainly?

743
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:05,257
Yes, do. Go ahead, as plainly
as you want to.

744
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,176
Well, if you'll forgive me...

745
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,470
...he's common.

746
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,434
Yes, I suppose he is.

747
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,478
Suppose?

748
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,982
Surely you can't have forgotten
that much of our upbringing, Stella...

749
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,777
...that you just suppose there's
any part of a gentleman in his nature.

750
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,655
Oh, you're hating me saying this,
aren't you?

751
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:32,158
Go on and say it all, Blanche.

752
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,497
He's like an animal.

753
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,708
Has an animal's habits.

754
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,836
There's even something
subhuman about him.

755
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,506
Thousands of years have passed him
right by and there he is...

756
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,509
...Stanley Kowalski,
survivor of the Stone Age.

757
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,804
Bearing the raw meat home
from the kill in the jungle. And you...

758
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,347
...you here waiting for him.

759
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:57,183
Maybe he'll strike you
or maybe grunt and kiss you.

760
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,687
That's if kisses have been discovered
yet. His "poker night," you call it.

761
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,188
His party of apes?

762
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,568
Maybe we are a long way
from being made in God's image.

763
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,195
But, Stella, my sister...

764
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,865
...there's been some progress
since then.

765
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,035
Such things as art, as poetry,
as music.

766
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,287
In some kinds of people...

767
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,540
...some tenderer feelings have had
some little beginning...

768
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,460
...that we have got to make grow
and to cling to...

769
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:28,256
...as our flag in this dark march
toward whatever it is we're approaching.

770
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:32,218
Don't, don't hang back
with the brutes.

771
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,676
Hey, Stell?

772
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,184
Hey, Stell?

773
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,359
- Hiya.
- Hi.

774
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,782
Hey, is Blanche back yet?

775
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,829
Yeah, she's back.

776
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,540
Oh, hi there, Blanche.

777
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,584
You look like you got under the car.

778
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,298
That mechanic down at Fritz's doesn't
know his axle grease from third base.

779
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,188
Hey!

780
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,154
- Don't throw that thing at me! Eunice!

781
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,239
You brick redhead,
I'll play with you!

782
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,408
You wanna play with me,
I'll play games with you!

783
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,328
That's just what I gave your
brother, you big redhead!

784
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:26,332
He hit me!
And I'm gonna call the police!

785
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,545
Some of your sister's friends
have stayed in the city.

786
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,011
- Did Eunice get the police?
- No, she's getting a drink...

787
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,014
...at the Four Deuces.
- That's much more practical.

788
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,726
Blanche is making us
some new slipcovers, honey.

789
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,270
Hey, is she here?

790
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,439
She went to the Four Deuces.

791
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,275
That no-good, rotten...

792
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,531
Hey, Stella, I can't find
my other pair of shoes.

793
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,284
We cleaned in there.

794
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,744
I'll get them.

795
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,457
I can't find nothing
around this dump anymore.

796
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,337
Oh, Stanley.

797
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,589
What sign were you born under?

798
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,051
- What sign?
- Astrological sign.

799
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,886
I bet you were born under Aries.

800
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,097
Aries people are forceful, dynamic,
they dote on noise.

801
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,933
They love to bang things around.

802
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,894
Stanley was born just five minutes
after Christmas.

803
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,647
Capricorn, the goat!

804
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,410
Say...

805
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,163
...do you happen to know
somebody named Shaw?

806
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,585
Why... Why, everybody knows
someone by the name of Shaw.

807
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:57,590
This somebody named Shaw is under
the impression that he met you in Auriol.

808
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,844
I figure he must have got you
mixed up with some other party...

809
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,096
...because this other party
is somebody...

810
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,515
...that he met at a hotel
called the Flamingo.

811
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,602
Why, I guess he does have me
mixed up with this other party.

812
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,815
The Hotel Flamingo is not a place
that I would dare to be seen in.

813
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,234
Oh, you know it then?

814
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,696
I've seen it and smelled it.

815
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,156
You must've got pretty close
if you could smell it.

816
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,702
The odor of cheap perfume
is penetrating.

817
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,580
Is that stuff you use expensive?

818
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,207
Twelve dollars an ounce. I'm nearly out.

819
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,127
That's just a hint if you want to
remember my birthday.

820
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,508
I figure that he must have
got you mixed up...

821
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:44,012
...but he goes in and out
of Auriol all the time...

822
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,973
...so he can check and clear up
any mistake.

823
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,106
- I'll see you at the Four Deuces.
- Hey, don't I rate a kiss?

824
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,734
No, not in front of your sister.

825
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:11,497
Don't cry. I only do that with other girls
because I love you, baby.

826
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,124
Don't cry.

827
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,592
Stella.

828
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,886
You still scared of thunder?

829
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,430
What have you heard about me?

830
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,848
Huh?

831
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,727
What have people been
telling you about me?

832
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,899
- Telling?
- You haven't heard...

833
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:41,027
...any unkind gossip about me?

834
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,489
Why, no, Blanche. Of course not.

835
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:49,494
Honey, there was
quite a lot of talk in Auriol.

836
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,538
People talk, who cares?

837
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,708
I haven't been so awfully good
the last year or so, since...

838
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,628
Since Belle Reve started to slip
through my fingers.

839
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,171
Honey, all of us do things...

840
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,049
I never was hard
or self-sufficient enough.

841
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,467
Soft people...

842
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:08,096
Soft people have got to
court the favor of hard ones, Stella.

843
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,390
You've got to shimmer and glow.

844
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:13,309
I don't know how much longer
I can turn the trick.

845
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,561
It isn't enough to be soft.

846
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,190
You've got to be soft and attractive.

847
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,858
And I...

848
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,236
I'm fading now.

849
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,744
Have you been listening to me?

850
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,831
I never listen to you
when you're being morbid.

851
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,090
Oh.

852
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,259
Is that Coke for me?

853
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,346
- Not for anyone else.
- You precious lamb. Is it just a Coke?

854
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:54,434
- You mean you want a shot in it?
- A shot never did a Coke any harm.

855
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,852
Oh, let me.

856
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,478
You mustn't wait on me.

857
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:01,816
I like to wait on you, Blanche.
It makes it seem more like home.

858
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,570
I have to admit, I...

859
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,656
I love to be waited on.

860
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,576
Blanche.

861
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,871
Blanche, honey, what is it?

862
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,040
Oh, you're so good to me, and I...

863
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,792
- Now, Blanche.
- I know you hate me to talk sentimental...

864
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,295
...but believe me, honey,
I feel more than I tell you.

865
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,630
I won't stay long, I won't.
I promise.

866
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,341
- Now, Blanche.
- I'll go. I'll go soon.

867
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,678
I won't hang around
till he throws me out.

868
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,306
- Now, will you stop talking foolish?
- Yes.

869
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,557
Only watch how you pour it!

870
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,226
Heavens.

871
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,770
Right on my...

872
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,229
...pretty...

873
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,398
...pink skirt.
- Here. Use my hankie.

874
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,984
- Blot gently.
- I know.

875
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,486
Gently...

876
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,196
...gently...

877
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,655
...gently.

878
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,407
Did it stain?

879
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,077
No.

880
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,578
No, not a bit.

881
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,332
Isn't that lucky?

882
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,251
Why did you scream like that?

883
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,172
I don't know why I screamed.

884
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,634
Mitch...

885
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:11,511
Mitch is coming at 7.

886
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,013
I guess I'm a little nervous
about our relations.

887
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:17,767
He hasn't gotten anything more than a
good-night kiss. That's all I've given him.

888
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,062
I want his respect. And men don't want
anything they get too easy.

889
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,899
On the other hand, men lose interest
quickly, especially when a girl is over...

890
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,359
Over 30.

891
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:30,029
When I mentioned marriage
they even forgot where I lived, so...

892
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,699
So, you see, I haven't informed him
of my real age.

893
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,703
Honey, why are you so sensitive
about your age?

894
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,958
Because of hard knocks
my vanity has been given.

895
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,460
What I mean is, he thinks I'm sort of...

896
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,504
...prim and proper, you know.

897
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,381
I want to deceive him...

898
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:51,384
...just enough to make him want me.

899
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,803
Darling...

900
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,930
...do you want him?

901
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,103
I want to rest.

902
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,524
I want to breathe quietly again.

903
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,901
Yes, I want Mitch.

904
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,736
Very badly.

905
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,239
Just think, if it happens...

906
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:17,743
...I can go away from here
and not be anyone's problem.

907
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,581
Blanche, it will happen.

908
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,459
It will?

909
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,755
It will, honey, it will.

910
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,760
Only, don't take another drink.

911
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,516
Hey, Steve! Eunice!

912
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,268
Stell!

913
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,444
Oh, get away! Get away!

914
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,156
- Put me down!
- Oh, you...!

915
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,914
- Hiya, honey!
- Let go!

916
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:21,515
Oh, me.

917
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,023
Come in.

918
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,694
- Evening, ma'am.
- Oh.

919
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,822
Well, well.

920
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,370
- What can I do for you?
- Well, I'm collecting for the Evening Star.

921
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,582
I didn't know that stars
took up collections.

922
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,668
No, it's a paper, ma'am.

923
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,169
I know.

924
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,213
I was joking. Feebly.

925
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,840
Will you...? Will you have a drink?

926
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,009
No, ma'am.

927
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,388
No, thank you.
I can't drink on the job.

928
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,478
Oh.

929
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,033
Well, now, let me see.

930
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,457
No, no. I don't have a dime.

931
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,295
I'm not the lady of the house.
I'm her sister from Mississippi.

932
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,799
I'm one of those poor relations
you've heard tell about.

933
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,385
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
I'll come back later.

934
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,804
Hey.

935
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,723
Have you...?

936
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,934
- Have you got a light?
- Sure.

937
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,612
- This doesn't always work.
- It's temperamental.

938
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,288
Why, thanks.

939
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,707
Thank you.

940
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,710
Hey.

941
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,129
What?

942
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,590
What time is it?

943
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,801
Fifteen of 7.

944
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,428
So late?

945
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:26,515
Don't you love these long,
rainy afternoons in New Orleans...

946
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,684
...when an hour isn't just an hour...

947
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:32,521
...but a little piece of eternity
dropped in our hands...

948
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,359
...and who knows what to do with it?

949
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,861
You...

950
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,947
You didn't get caught in the rain?

951
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,326
No, ma'am. I stepped inside.

952
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,621
- In a drugstore and had a soda.
- Mm-hm.

953
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,539
- Chocolate?
- No, ma'am. Cherry.

954
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,625
- Cherry. Heh, heh.
- Cherry.

955
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,170
Mmm. You make my mouth water.

956
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,799
I guess I...

957
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,801
Young man.

958
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:03,803
Young...

959
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,638
...young...

960
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:07,681
...young man.

961
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:13,354
Did anyone ever tell you, you look like a
young prince out of the Arabian Nights?

962
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,358
You do, honey lamb.

963
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,736
Come here.

964
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:24,156
Come on over here, like I told you.

965
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,706
I want to kiss you just once...

966
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,500
...softly...

967
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,710
...and sweetly on your mouth.

968
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,349
Run away now, quickly.

969
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,227
It'd be nice to keep you,
but I've got to be good...

970
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,354
...and keep my hands off children.

971
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,193
Adios.

972
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,076
Why, look who's here.

973
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,537
My Rosenkavalier.

974
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,708
Oh, bow to me first.

975
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,796
Now, présentez. Ha, ha.

976
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,256
Merci.

977
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,320
Hiya, Mitch.

978
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:55,164
I'm afraid you haven't had much
fun out of this evening, Blanche.

979
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,375
- I spoiled it for you.
- No, you didn't.

980
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,879
I simply couldn't rise
to the occasion, that was all.

981
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:06,091
I don't think I've ever tried so hard to be
gay and made such a dismal mess of it.

982
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,887
I get ten points for trying.
I did try.

983
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,267
Hello, moon.

984
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,646
I'm looking for the Pleiades...

985
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,147
...the Seven Sisters...

986
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,316
...but these girls aren't out tonight.

987
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,943
Oh, yes, they are.

988
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,778
There they are, God bless them.

989
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,614
All in a bunch, going home
from their little bridge party.

990
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,533
May I kiss you?

991
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,743
Why do you always ask me if you may?

992
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:36,288
- I don't know if you want me to or not.
- Why should you be so doubtful?

993
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,290
We parked by the lake,
and I kissed you...

994
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,627
Honey, it wasn't the kiss I
objected to. I liked the kiss very much.

995
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,964
It was the other little familiarity
that I felt obliged to discourage.

996
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,216
Not that I resented it,
not a bit in the world.

997
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:50,844
In fact, I was somewhat flattered
that you desired me.

998
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,890
But you know as well as I do that
a single girl, a girl alone in the world...

999
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,268
...has got to keep a firm hold
on her emotions...

1000
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,396
...or she'll be lost.
- Lost?

1001
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:04,233
I guess you're used to
the type of girl that likes to be lost.

1002
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:08,362
I like you to be exactly
the way that you are...

1003
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:12,074
...because in all my experience,
I have never known anyone like you.

1004
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,999
Are you laughing at me?

1005
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,752
No.

1006
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,629
No, honey.

1007
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,132
I'm not laughing at you.

1008
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:33,095
Well, come on,
let's finish our nightcap.

1009
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,389
You've been so anxious and solemn
all evening.

1010
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,516
We've both been anxious and solemn.

1011
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,936
And now for these last few remaining
moments of our lives together...

1012
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,188
...I want to create joie de vivre.

1013
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,527
I'm lighting this candle.

1014
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,113
That's good.

1015
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,365
We're going to be very bohemian.

1016
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:58,370
We are gonna pretend we're sitting in an
artists' cafe on the Left Bank in Paris.

1017
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:05,544
- Understand French?
- No, no, I don't understand French.

1018
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:10,132
Oh. Well, why don't you sit down.
Take off your coat. Loosen your collar.

1019
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,552
- No, I better leave it on.
- No. I want you to be comfortable.

1020
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,014
No, I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.
My shirt is sticking to me.

1021
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:21,977
Perspiration is healthy. If people didn't
perspire, they would die in five minutes.

1022
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,563
Oh, this is a nice coat.
What...?

1023
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,775
- What material is it?
- They call this stuff alpaca.

1024
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,903
- Oh, alpaca.
- It's very lightweight alpaca.

1025
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,906
- Oh, lightweight alpaca.
- Yes.

1026
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:37,743
I don't like to wear a watch coat even in
the summer because I sweat through it.

1027
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,411
And it don't look neat on me.

1028
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:43,582
A man with a heavy build is careful of
what he wears so he don't look clumsy.

1029
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,835
- Why, you're not too heavy.
- You don't think I am?

1030
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,837
You're not the delicate type.

1031
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:53,425
You have a massive bone structure
and a very imposing physique.

1032
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,178
I thank you.

1033
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,224
At Christmas, I was given a membership
to the New Orleans Sports Club.

1034
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:03,644
- Oh, good.
- It's the finest present I was ever given.

1035
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:08,440
I work out there with the weights
and I swim. I keep myself fit.

1036
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:12,027
When I started there I was soft
in the belly, but now my belly is hard.

1037
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,906
It's so hard now a man can punch me
in the belly and it don't hurt me.

1038
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:20,119
Punch me.
Go ahead. Go on. Punch.

1039
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,662
Come on.

1040
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,457
- Gracious.
- Heh, heh. See?

1041
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,794
Blanche.

1042
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,587
Guess how much I weigh?

1043
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:36,552
- I'd say in the vicinity of 180 pounds.
- No, guess again.

1044
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,178
- Not so much?
- No, more.

1045
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:41,098
- Well?
- I weigh 207 pounds.

1046
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,600
I'm 6'1 " and one-half inches tall
in my bare feet...

1047
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,145
...without shoes on,
and that's what I weigh stripped.

1048
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,357
Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.

1049
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,319
Well, my weight's not a very
interesting subject to talk about.

1050
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,155
What's yours?

1051
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,323
- My weight?
- Yes.

1052
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,826
- You guess.
- Let me lift you.

1053
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,955
Samson. Go on, lift me.

1054
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,586
- Why, you're light as a feather.
- You may release me now.

1055
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,630
- Huh?
- I said unhand me, sir.

1056
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,551
Mitch, Mitch, we're in public.
You must behave like a gentleman.

1057
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,970
Just give me a slap
whenever I step out of bounds.

1058
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:24,933
It won't be necessary. You're a natural
gentleman. One of the few left.

1059
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,854
I don't want you to think that I'm
severe or old-maid schoolteacherish...

1060
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,939
...or anything. It's just, well, I...

1061
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,527
I guess I have old-fashioned ideals.

1062
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,585
Where's Stanley and Stella tonight?

1063
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,922
I think they were planning
to take in a midnight preview.

1064
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,508
We all ought to go out together
some night.

1065
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,178
That wouldn't be a good plan.

1066
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:02,763
Why not?

1067
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,557
You are an old friend of Stanley's?

1068
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,726
We was together in the 241 st.

1069
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,230
- I guess he talks to you pretty frankly.
- Sure.

1070
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,690
Has he talked to you about me?

1071
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,110
- No, not much.
- The way you say that...

1072
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,446
...I suspect that he has.
- He hasn't said much.

1073
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:23,534
Well, what he has said, what would
you say his attitude toward me was?

1074
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,410
- What makes you ask that?
- Well...

1075
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,621
Don't you get along with him?

1076
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,665
What do you think?

1077
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,875
I think he don't understand you.

1078
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:37,256
That's putting it mildly. Surely he must
have told you how much he hates me.

1079
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,470
I don't think he hates you.

1080
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,932
He hates me,
or why would he insult me?

1081
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,475
Of course...

1082
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:51,520
...there is such a thing as
the hostility of...

1083
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:56,441
Perhaps in some strange
kind of way, he...

1084
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,360
Oh, no.

1085
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,821
To think of it makes me...

1086
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,740
- Blanche.
- Yes, honey?

1087
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,870
- Blanche, can I ask you a question?
- Yes, what?

1088
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,997
How old are you?

1089
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,918
What do you want to know that for?

1090
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:19,381
I talked to my mother about you
and she said, "How old is Blanche?"

1091
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,886
- You talked to your mother about me?
- Yes.

1092
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,596
Why?

1093
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:29,308
Because I told her how nice
you were, and I liked you.

1094
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,353
Were you sincere about that?

1095
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,982
You know I was.

1096
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,194
Why did your mother
want to know my age?

1097
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:45,741
- My mother is sick, and...
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?

1098
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,993
She won't live long...

1099
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:51,747
...maybe just a few months,
and she worries because I'm not settled.

1100
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,833
She wants to see me
settled down before she...

1101
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,465
You love her very much, don't you?

1102
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:07,262
You'll be lonely when she passes on,
won't you?

1103
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,727
I know what that means.

1104
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,065
To be Ionely?

1105
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,526
I loved someone once.

1106
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,571
And the person I loved, I lost.

1107
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,199
Dead?

1108
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,913
He was a boy.

1109
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,959
Just a boy,
when I was a very young girl.

1110
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:40,545
When I was 16, I made the discovery:

1111
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,339
Love.

1112
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,716
All at once, and much...

1113
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,260
...much too completely.

1114
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:51,014
It was like you suddenly turned
a blinding light...

1115
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:54,977
...on something that had
always been half in shadow.

1116
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,438
That's how it struck the world for me.

1117
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,774
But I was unlucky.

1118
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,609
Deluded.

1119
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,238
There was something about the boy.

1120
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:09,074
A nervousness, a tenderness...

1121
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,993
...an uncertainty.

1122
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,328
And I didn't understand.

1123
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:17,958
I didn't understand why this boy,
who wrote poetry...

1124
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,627
...didn't seem able to do anything else.

1125
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,838
He lost every job.

1126
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,882
He came to me for help.

1127
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,801
I didn't know that.

1128
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,429
I didn't know anything...

1129
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,806
...except that I loved him...

1130
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,933
...unendurably.

1131
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,353
At night I pretended to sleep.

1132
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,605
I heard him crying.

1133
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,108
Crying.

1134
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,947
Crying the way a lost child cries.

1135
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,116
I don't understand.

1136
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,618
No.

1137
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:57,706
No, neither did I.

1138
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,792
And that's why I...

1139
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,296
I killed him.

1140
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,174
You...?

1141
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,602
One night...

1142
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,731
...we drove out to a place
called Moon Lake Casino.

1143
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:26,109
We danced the Varsouviana.

1144
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:30,489
Suddenly, in the middle of the dance,
the boy I married broke away from me...

1145
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,407
...and ran out of the casino.

1146
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,242
A few minutes later...

1147
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,452
...a shot.

1148
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,288
I ran.

1149
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,873
All did.

1150
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:43,835
All ran and gathered about
the terrible thing at the edge of the lake.

1151
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,471
He'd stuck a revolver into his mouth...

1152
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,181
...and fired.

1153
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,939
It was because...

1154
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,191
...on the dance floor...

1155
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,611
...unable to stop myself, I'd said:

1156
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,947
"You're weak.

1157
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,741
I've lost respect for you.

1158
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:18,036
I despise you."

1159
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,876
And then...

1160
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:29,923
...the searchlight
which had been turned on the world...

1161
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,300
...was turned off again.

1162
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,094
And never...

1163
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:38,974
...for one moment since,
has there been any light stronger than...

1164
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,393
Than this...

1165
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,937
...yellow lantern.

1166
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,080
You need somebody.

1167
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,167
And I need somebody too.

1168
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,301
Could it be you and me, Blanche?

1169
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,940
Oh.

1170
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,611
Sometimes...

1171
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,447
...there's God...

1172
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,867
...so quickly.

1173
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,540
- You wanna mess with me,
sonny boy, come on!

1174
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,417
All right, turn him loose!

1175
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:50,962
You're gonna kill who? You don't even
know when you're getting wised up.

1176
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,923
You don't have to wise me up!

1177
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:56,593
Come on, here. Come on,
get to work here. We gotta get going.

1178
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,470
We got some bucks
to make around here.

1179
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:00,597
Go ahead and marry her,
but hurry it up.

1180
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,475
She's been in my house
five months and her time is up.

1181
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,572
It's only a paper moon

1182
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:21,576
Sailing over a cardboard sea

1183
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:25,205
But it wouldn't be make-believe

1184
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,834
If you believed in me

1185
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,671
It's a Barnum and Bailey world

1186
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,923
Just as phony as it...

1187
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:38,093
Oh, hello, Stanley.

1188
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,845
But it wouldn't be make-believe

1189
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:44,516
If you believed in me

1190
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,311
Some canary bird.

1191
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,189
All right.

1192
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:55,568
Please tell me quietly just what you think
you found out about my sister.

1193
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,530
You know your sister Blanche
is no lily, don't you?

1194
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,865
What have you heard,
and who from?

1195
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,660
You should know the line
that she's been feeding to Mitch.

1196
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:06,871
Our supply man at the plant's
been going through Auriol for years.

1197
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,623
He knows all about her.

1198
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,502
And everybody else in the town
of Auriol knows all about her.

1199
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,381
She's as famous in Auriol as if she was
the president of the United States...

1200
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:19,551
...only she's not respected by any party.

1201
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,013
Without your love

1202
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,182
It's a honky-tonk parade

1203
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:31,062
So she moved to a hotel
called the Flamingo...

1204
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,565
...which is a second-class hotel...

1205
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,567
...and has the advantages...

1206
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:39,738
...of not interfering with the private
and social life of the personalities there.

1207
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,907
Now, the Flamingo is used to
all kinds of goings on.

1208
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:47,579
But the management of the Flamingo
was impressed by Dame Blanche.

1209
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:50,290
In fact, they were so impressed
that they requested her...

1210
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,667
...to turn in her room key
for permanently.

1211
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:56,671
And this happened a couple of weeks
before she showed here.

1212
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:06,890
Honey, I know how
this is gonna upset you.

1213
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:10,602
But listen, she pulled the wool
over your eyes just as much as Mitch's.

1214
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,771
Pure invention.
Not a word of truth in it.

1215
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,398
Baby, listen. I checked on every story.

1216
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,235
The trouble was she couldn't
put on her act anymore in Auriol...

1217
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,737
...because they wised up.

1218
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,907
And after two, three days they quit,
then she goes on to another one.

1219
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:26,701
The same old line, the same old act
and the same old hooey.

1220
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,287
And as time went by,
she became the town character...

1221
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:32,499
...regarded not just as different,
but downright loco and nuts...

1222
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,126
...which brings us to lie number two...

1223
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,588
Stella.

1224
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:41,049
Baby, now...

1225
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,844
She didn't resign temporarily because
of her nerves. She was kicked out...

1226
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,097
...before the spring term ended.

1227
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,853
And, now, I hate to tell you the reason
that step was taken.

1228
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:56,481
A 17-year-old kid
she got mixed up with.

1229
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,316
The boy's dad learned about it...

1230
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:01,111
...and he got in touch
with the high school superintendent.

1231
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,988
And it was practically a town ordinance
passed against her.

1232
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:06,866
BLANCHE: Stella.
- Yes, Blanche?

1233
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,120
Can I have another bath towel
to dry my hair with? I just washed it.

1234
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,830
Yes, honey.

1235
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,003
- What's the matter, honey?
- Matter, what?

1236
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,006
You have such a strange
expression on your face.

1237
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,884
- I guess I'm a little tired, is...
- Well...

1238
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,512
...why don't you take a hot bath
as soon as I get out?

1239
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,889
How soon is that gonna be, Blanche?

1240
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,934
Not so terribly long,
possess your soul in patience.

1241
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,228
It's not my soul I'm worried about.

1242
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:41,359
Well?

1243
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,033
How many candles
you sticking in the cake?

1244
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:52,328
I stopped at 25.

1245
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,081
You got company expected?

1246
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:57,208
We asked Mitch to come over.

1247
01:19:57,376 --> 01:20:00,044
Well, don't expect Mitch
over here tonight.

1248
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,046
Why?

1249
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:07,635
Mitch is a buddy of mine.
We was together in the 241 st Engineers.

1250
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,680
We work in the same plant,
we're on the same bowling team.

1251
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,183
Stanley Kowalski, did you repeat
what that...?

1252
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,977
You bet I told him.
I would have that on my conscience...

1253
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,605
...if I knew all that
and let my best friend get caught.

1254
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:20,940
- Is Mitch through with her?
- I don't know...

1255
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:23,651
...but he's wised up.
- Mitch was gonna marry her.

1256
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,653
He's not gonna marry her now.

1257
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,281
He's not gonna jump into a tank
with a school of sharks.

1258
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:33,119
- What'll she do? What will she do?
- Oh, her future is mapped out for her.

1259
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:35,747
What do you mean?

1260
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:40,710
Hey, toots! Canary bird,
will you get out of the bathroom!

1261
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,420
Oh.

1262
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:46,216
Oh, I feel so good
after a long, hot bath.

1263
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,468
I feel so good and cool and rested.

1264
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,097
- Do you, Blanche?
- Yes, I do. So refreshed.

1265
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,600
Why, a hot bath
and a long, cold drink...

1266
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:59,020
...always gives me
a brand-new outlook on life.

1267
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,273
What's the matter?

1268
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,442
What's happened.

1269
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:08,613
- What is it?
- Nothing's happened, Blanche.

1270
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,823
You're lying.

1271
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,326
Something has.

1272
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,211
Stanley?

1273
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,963
Stanley, tell us a joke.

1274
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,465
Tell us a funny little story
to make us all laugh.

1275
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,968
I don't know what's the matter,
we're all so solemn.

1276
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:32,136
Is it because I've been
stood up by my beau?

1277
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,974
First time in my experience with men...
And I've had a good deal of all sorts.

1278
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,892
- That I've been stood up by anyone.
Ha, ha.

1279
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,644
I don't know how to take it.

1280
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:43,273
Tell us a funny little story, Stanley.

1281
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,775
Something to help us out.

1282
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,236
I didn't think you liked
my stories, Blanche.

1283
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:51,239
I like them when they're amusing,
but not indecent.

1284
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,576
I don't know any refined enough
for your taste.

1285
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,996
Well, then. Let me tell one.

1286
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,040
Yes, tell one, Blanche.
You used to know a lot of good stories.

1287
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,335
Now, let me see. I have to run
through my repertoire.

1288
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,462
Oh, yes, I love parrot stories.

1289
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,841
You all like parrot stories? This is about
the old maid and the parrot.

1290
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:12,760
This old maid, she had a parrot
that cursed a blue streak...

1291
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,180
...and knew more vulgar expressions
than Mr. Kowalski.

1292
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,726
Well, the only way to hush the parrot up
was to put the cover...

1293
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,736
Must be upstairs.

1294
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,032
Well, the only way
to hush the parrot up was to put...

1295
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,034
Go on, Blanche.

1296
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,745
No.

1297
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:41,372
I don't think
Mr. Kowalski will be amused.

1298
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:48,212
Mr. Kowalski is too busy making
a pig of himself to think of anything else.

1299
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,257
Your face and your fingers
are disgustingly greasy.

1300
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:53,676
Go wash up
and then help me clear the table.

1301
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,731
Now, that's how
I'm gonna clear the table.

1302
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:11,069
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

1303
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:17,200
Pig, Polack, disgusting, vulgar, greasy.

1304
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,745
Those words have been on your tongue
and your sister's tongue...

1305
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,747
...just too much around here.

1306
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,876
Who do you think you are,
a pair of queens?

1307
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:31,130
Remember Huey Long said: Every man's
a king, and I'm the king around here.

1308
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,341
And don't you forget it.

1309
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:44,477
My place is all cleared up now.
You want me to clear yours?

1310
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,279
Stella...

1311
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,365
...what happened while I was bathing?

1312
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:01,869
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing. Nothing, nothing, Blanche.

1313
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,831
- I think he told you about Mitch and me.
- No.

1314
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:07,291
You know why Mitch didn't come,
but you won't tell.

1315
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,627
- No.
- I'm gonna call him.

1316
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:13,005
- Don't call him!
- Yes, I am. I'll call him on the phone.

1317
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,174
Blanche, I wouldn't call him.

1318
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,261
Got to be given some explanation
from someone.

1319
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,727
Well, I hope you're
pleased with your doings.

1320
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:30,314
I never had so much trouble
swallowing food in my life...

1321
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:33,693
...looking at that girl's face
and that empty chair.

1322
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:37,822
Hello? I want to talk
to Mr. Mitchell, please.

1323
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,160
I'd like to leave a number, if I may.

1324
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,163
- Honey.
- Tulane-4947.

1325
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,915
And say it's important to call, please.

1326
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:53,004
Honey, it's gonna be all right after
she goes and after you have the baby.

1327
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,549
It's gonna be all right again
between you and me, the way it was.

1328
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,718
Remember how it was?

1329
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:02,346
It's gonna be so sweet when we can
get them colored lights going...

1330
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:05,600
...with nobody's sister
behind the curtains to hear us.

1331
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,697
Steve and Eunice.

1332
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:24,702
Come on back in.

1333
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,539
Blanche?

1334
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,125
Blanche.

1335
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:35,046
- Yes?
- Oh, come on, hon.

1336
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:38,883
Oh, what pretty, pretty candles.
Don't burn them, Stella.

1337
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,594
- I certainly will.
- No.

1338
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,888
You ought to save them
for baby's birthdays.

1339
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:46,599
Oh, I hope candles are gonna
glow in his life.

1340
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:49,060
I hope his eyes are gonna be
like candles...

1341
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:52,146
...like two blue candles...

1342
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,190
Lining a white cake.

1343
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,608
What poetry.

1344
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,448
I shouldn't have called him.

1345
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:06,285
Blanche. You know, it's hot in there
with the steam from that bathroom!

1346
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:11,415
I said I was sorry three times!

1347
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,754
I take hot baths for my nerves.

1348
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,798
Hydrotherapy, they call it.

1349
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:21,342
You healthy Polack,
without a nerve in your body.

1350
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,387
How can you possibly know
what anxiety feels like?

1351
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:26,764
I am not a Polack!

1352
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:30,142
People from Poland are Poles,
they are not Polacks!

1353
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,770
But what I am
is 100 percent American!

1354
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,940
I'm born and raised in the greatest
country on earth and I'm proud of it!

1355
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,485
- And don't you ever call me a Polack!
- That's for me, I'm sure!

1356
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:42,113
Just keep your seat.
I'm not so sure.

1357
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,449
- Hello.
- Stanley?

1358
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:47,910
- Yeah, Mac.
- Listen, Stanley...

1359
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,581
Take your hands off me, Stella.
What's the matter with you?

1360
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:55,459
- Why do you give me that pitying look?
- Will you shut up!

1361
01:26:57,129 --> 01:27:00,298
No, we got a noisy woman in the place.

1362
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:05,845
I told you I don't want to bowl at Riley's.
I had a little trouble with Riley last week.

1363
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:10,224
I'm the team captain, ain't I? All right.
Then we're not gonna bowl at Riley's.

1364
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:13,352
We're gonna bowl at the West Side
or at the Gate, and I'll see you.

1365
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,062
Sister Blanche...

1366
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,357
...I got a little birthday
remembrance for you.

1367
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,446
I hope that you like it.

1368
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:35,541
- Why, it's a...
- That's a bus ticket back to Auriol.

1369
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:37,335
Tuesday.

1370
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:48,638
Blanche.

1371
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,855
You didn't need to do that.

1372
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,483
Don't forget all that I took off of her.

1373
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:03,402
You didn't need to be so cruel
to someone as alone as she is.

1374
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:06,322
- A delicate article, she is.
- She is. She was.

1375
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,032
You didn't know Blanche as a girl.

1376
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,118
Nobody, nobody was as tender
and as trusting as she was.

1377
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,705
But people like you abused her
and forced her to change.

1378
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:18,250
- Do you think you're going bowling now?
- That's right.

1379
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:21,253
You're not going bowling.
Why did you do this to her?

1380
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,463
Let go of me.

1381
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:23,756
I want to know why!

1382
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,049
Hey, cool it!

1383
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:29,178
Listen, baby, when we first met,
you and me, you thought I was common.

1384
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:32,056
Well, how right you was.
I was common as dirt.

1385
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,475
You showed me a snapshot
of a place with columns...

1386
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:37,436
...and I pulled you down off them
columns and you loved it.

1387
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,313
Having them colored lights going.

1388
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:42,733
And wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed here?

1389
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:48,114
Huh? Wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed here?

1390
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,492
Hoity-toity, describing me like a ape.

1391
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,833
Stella?

1392
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,631
What's the matter with you?

1393
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,930
Honey, what's the matter with you?

1394
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,440
Honey, did I hurt you?

1395
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,860
Baby, what is it?

1396
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,490
Take me to the hospital.

1397
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,772
Who is it, please?

1398
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,816
It's me. Me, Mitch.

1399
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,111
Mitch.

1400
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,790
Just a minute, please.

1401
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:31,300
Coming. Coming.

1402
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:40,935
Hello, Mitch.

1403
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:44,980
You know, I really shouldn't let you in
after the treatment I received from you.

1404
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,192
So utterly uncavalier.
But, hello, beautiful.

1405
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,654
Oh, my, my, what a cold shoulder.
And what uncouth apparel.

1406
01:30:51,822 --> 01:30:53,197
Why, you haven't even shaved.

1407
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,783
But I forgive you,
because it's a relief to see you.

1408
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,952
You stopped that polka tune
I had in my head.

1409
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,870
Ever get anything caught in your head?

1410
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:02,873
Of course not, you never get
anything awful caught in your head.

1411
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,708
- We have to have that fan on?
- No.

1412
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,545
- I don't like fans.
- Well, let's turn it off, honey.

1413
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,046
I'm not partial to them.

1414
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:11,924
I don't know what there is to drink,
I haven't investigated.

1415
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,593
- I don't want Stan's liquor.
- It isn't Stan's!

1416
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:17,847
Some things on the premises
are actually mine.

1417
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,390
How's your mother?

1418
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,434
- Is your mother well?
- Why?

1419
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,062
Something the matter with you.
But never mind.

1420
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:29,567
I won't cross-examine the witness, I'll just
pretend I didn't notice anything different.

1421
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,570
It's that music again.

1422
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,782
What music?

1423
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,828
The polka tune they were playing
when Allan...

1424
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:43,664
Wait.

1425
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,083
There...

1426
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:47,960
...the shot.

1427
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:53,632
It always stops after that.

1428
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,679
Yes.

1429
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,599
Now it's stopped.

1430
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,811
Are you boxed out of your mind?

1431
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,571
Oh, I'll go and see what I can
find in the way of...

1432
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:19,658
By the way, forgive me not being
dressed. I'd practically given you up.

1433
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:21,368
Had you forgotten your invitation?

1434
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,329
MITCH: I wasn't going
to see you anymore.

1435
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,372
BLANCHE:
Wait, I can't hear what you're saying.

1436
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,458
You talk so seldom,
when you do say anything...

1437
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:29,793
...I don't want to miss
a single syllable of it.

1438
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:32,838
What am I looking for around here?
Oh, yes. The liquor.

1439
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:36,133
We've had so much excitement,
I am boxed out of my mind.

1440
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:37,760
Here's something.

1441
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:40,137
"Southern Cheer."

1442
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,264
What can that be, I wonder?

1443
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:45,351
Take your foot off the bed.
It has a clean cover on it.

1444
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:47,478
You boys wouldn't notice
a thing like that.

1445
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:51,774
- I've done so much to this place since I...
- Aren't you leaving here pretty soon?

1446
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,735
I wonder if this ought to be
mixed with something.

1447
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:59,156
Mmm. It's sweet, terribly sweet.
Why, I believe it's a liqueur.

1448
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:02,952
Heh, heh, heh. Yes, that's what it is,
a liqueur. I don't think you'll like it, but try it.

1449
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,828
- Maybe you will.
- I told you before...

1450
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,122
...I don't want any of his liquor,
and I mean it.

1451
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,875
He says you been lapping it up
all summer like a wildcat.

1452
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:13,337
I won't descend to the level
of such a cheap accusation to answer...

1453
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,673
What's in your mind?

1454
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,592
- I see something in your eyes.
- It's dark in here.

1455
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,512
I like the dark.
The dark is comforting to me.

1456
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,515
I've never seen you in the light.
That's a fact.

1457
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,684
I've never seen you in the afternoon.

1458
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:29,228
I met you at the plant
in the afternoon.

1459
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,272
Not on Sunday afternoon!

1460
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:35,109
You never wanna go out till after 6, then
it's always someplace not lighted much.

1461
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:37,444
Some obscure meaning
in this I fail to catch.

1462
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,197
What it means is I've never had
a real good look at you.

1463
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,408
- Let's turn the light on.
- Light? What for?

1464
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:44,827
This one here with
this paper thing on it.

1465
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:49,748
- What did you want to do that for?
- So I can see you, good and plain.

1466
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:51,792
You don't really mean to be insulting.

1467
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,085
No, just realistic.

1468
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,713
- I don't want realism. I want magic.
- Magic.

1469
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,048
Yes, yes, magic.

1470
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,802
I try to give that to people. I do
misrepresent things, I don't tell truth.

1471
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:05,806
I tell what ought to be truth and if that
is sinful, then let me be punished for it.

1472
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,309
Don't turn the light on!

1473
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:20,279
Oh, I don't mind you
being older than what I thought...

1474
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,365
...but all the rest of it.

1475
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:30,247
Why, that pitch about
your ideals being so old-fashioned...

1476
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:33,250
...and all the malarkey that
you've been dishing out all summer.

1477
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:37,463
I knew you weren't 16, but I was
fool enough to believe you was straight!

1478
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:40,799
Who told you I wasn't straight?
My loving brother-in-law?

1479
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:42,426
- And you believed him?
- No!

1480
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:47,014
No, I called him a liar at first
and then I checked on the story.

1481
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,808
I talked over long distance
to this merchant in Auriol.

1482
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:52,019
- Who is this merchant?
- Kiefaber.

1483
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:55,272
The merchant Kiefaber of Auriol.
I know the man. He whistled at me.

1484
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,983
I put him in his place.
Now he makes up stories about me.

1485
01:34:58,151 --> 01:35:00,235
Didn't you stay at a hotel
called the Flamingo?

1486
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:03,280
Flamingo? No!

1487
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:05,657
Tarantula was the name of it.

1488
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:09,912
- I stayed at a hotel called Tarantula Arms.
- Tarantula Arms?

1489
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,791
Yes, a big spider. That's where
I brought my victims.

1490
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,209
Yes.

1491
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:19,713
I have had many meetings
with strangers.

1492
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:29,556
After the death of Allan...

1493
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:35,813
...meetings with strangers was all I
seemed able to fill my empty heart with.

1494
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:38,357
I think it was panic, just panic...

1495
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:41,735
...that drove me from one to another,
searching for some protection.

1496
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:47,658
Here, there, and then
in the most unlikely places.

1497
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:53,747
Even, at last, in a 17-year-old boy.
But somebody wrote the superintendent:

1498
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:57,084
"This woman is morally unfit
for her position."

1499
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:58,752
True?

1500
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,504
Yes.

1501
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,798
Unfit somehow, anyway.

1502
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:06,093
So I came here.
There was nowhere else I could go.

1503
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:08,971
I was played out.
You know what played out is?

1504
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:12,099
My youth was gone up the waterspout.

1505
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,851
Then I met you.

1506
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,019
You said you needed someone.

1507
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,522
Well, I needed someone too.

1508
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,607
I thanked God for you.

1509
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,860
You seemed gentle.

1510
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,278
A cleft...

1511
01:36:24,446 --> 01:36:28,198
...in the rock of the world
that I could hide in.

1512
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:32,494
But I suppose I was asking...

1513
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:35,622
...hoping too much.

1514
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,041
Kiefaber...

1515
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:43,130
...Harris and Shaw have tied an old tin
can to the tail of the kite.

1516
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,507
I thought you were straight.

1517
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:49,303
Straight?

1518
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,680
What's straight?

1519
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:55,350
A line can be straight, or a street...

1520
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:58,437
...but the heart of a human being?

1521
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,692
- You lied to me, Blanche.
- Don't say I lied to you.

1522
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:08,030
- Lies! Lies! Inside and out, all lies!
- Never inside.

1523
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:10,741
I never lied in my heart!

1524
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,539
What?

1525
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,294
From outside.

1526
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,596
Flowers.
Flowers for the dead.

1527
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:39,394
No.

1528
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:43,774
Not now.

1529
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:53,242
I lived in a house where dying
old women remembered their dead men.

1530
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,077
Crumble, then fade.

1531
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:57,454
Regrets, recriminations.

1532
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:00,749
"If you'd done this,
it wouldn't have cost me that."

1533
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:02,334
Legacies...

1534
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:03,752
...and other things...

1535
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,129
...such as bloodstained pillowslips.

1536
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:09,508
I used to sit here...

1537
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:10,968
...and she used to sit there.

1538
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:14,846
And death was as close as you are.

1539
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,057
Death.

1540
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:20,143
The opposite is desire.

1541
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,979
So how could you wonder?

1542
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,148
How could you possibly wonder?

1543
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:31,822
Not far from Belle Reve,
before we lost Belle Reve...

1544
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,576
...was a camp
where they trained young soldiers.

1545
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,996
On Saturday nights,
they would go in town to get drunk.

1546
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:43,458
And on the way back, they would
stagger onto my lawn and call:

1547
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:50,048
"Blanche."

1548
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,442
What do you want?

1549
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,368
Marry me, Mitch.

1550
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,872
No, I don't think
I want to marry you anymore.

1551
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,708
No?

1552
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:28,754
No. You're not clean enough
to bring in the house with my mom...

1553
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:31,465
Go, then!

1554
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:35,344
Get out of here.

1555
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:38,388
Quick, before I start screaming.

1556
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,225
Get out of here quick,
before I start screaming!

1557
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:45,062
Screaming! Screaming!

1558
01:39:57,617 --> 01:39:59,576
Are you all right, lady?

1559
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,705
What's the matter, lady?

1560
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,930
- She must be drunk.
- Somebody better get a policeman.

1561
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:21,890
There's a cop now.

1562
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:25,394
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1563
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:40,951
It's a police officer. Open up.

1564
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,247
Open up in there.

1565
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:48,375
It's a police officer, open up.

1566
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,294
What's the matter? Are you hurt, lady?

1567
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:53,714
Are you all right, lady?

1568
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,799
Yes. Go away.

1569
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:59,720
- Go on.
- Are you hurt?

1570
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:02,431
- Are you all right?
- I'll be good.

1571
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:05,100
It's all right. Let's break it up.

1572
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,107
I'll be good.

1573
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:17,946
I'll be good. I'll be good.

1574
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:26,455
Oh, no, my gracious. What a thing.

1575
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:31,084
How about taking a swim,
a moonlight swim at the old rock quarry?

1576
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:33,420
That's if anyone's sober enough
to drive a car.

1577
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:36,173
The best way in the world
to stop your head from buzzing.

1578
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,134
Only you have to be careful to dive
where the deep pool is.

1579
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:43,472
If you hit a rock, you won't come up
till tomorrow. Heh, heh.

1580
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:48,477
My goodness. They're playing
"Goodnight, Ladies."

1581
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:53,231
May I rest my weary head
on your shoulder?

1582
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:54,983
It's so...

1583
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:56,860
...comforting.

1584
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,623
Hi, Blanche.

1585
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:31,937
- How's my sister?
- She's doing okay.

1586
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:35,273
How's the baby?

1587
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:39,736
The baby won't come till tomorrow,
so they told me to get a little shuteye.

1588
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:44,199
Does that mean...

1589
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:46,785
...we are to be alone in here?

1590
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:49,746
Yeah, it's just you and me, Blanche.

1591
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:53,917
Hey, what do you got
them fine feathers on for?

1592
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:59,506
Oh. That's right.
You left before my wire came.

1593
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:01,967
What, you got a wire?

1594
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:05,762
I received a telegram
from an old admirer of mine.

1595
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:10,475
- Anything good?
- I think so. An invitation.

1596
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:12,769
What to?

1597
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:17,899
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.

1598
01:43:18,776 --> 01:43:20,652
Well, what do you know?

1599
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:24,823
I was never so surprised in my life.
It came like a bolt from the blue.

1600
01:43:25,575 --> 01:43:27,617
Who'd you say it was from?

1601
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:31,121
An old beau of mine.

1602
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:35,125
Oh, the one that give you
the white fox fur pieces.

1603
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,168
Shep Huntleigh.

1604
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:39,671
I wore his ATO pin
my last year in college.

1605
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:42,424
I hadn't seen him for a while,
then just now this wire...

1606
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,635
...inviting me on a cruise of the
Caribbean. The problem is clothes.

1607
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:49,097
I tore into my trunk to see what I had
that was suitable for the tropics.

1608
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,892
And you come up
with a gorgeous diamond tiara.

1609
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,311
This old relic? It's only rhinestones.

1610
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:57,314
Oh, I thought it was
Tiffany's diamonds.

1611
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,567
Well, anyhow,
I shall be entertained in style.

1612
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,945
Well, it just goes to show you,
Blanche, you never know what's coming.

1613
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,448
When I thought my luck
was beginning to fail me.

1614
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:09,534
Into the picture
pops this Miami millionaire.

1615
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,287
This man is not from Miami.
This man is from Dallas.

1616
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:15,040
Just so he's from somewhere.

1617
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:18,209
Close the curtains
before you undress any further.

1618
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:21,046
No, this is all
I'm gonna undress right now.

1619
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,050
Hey, Blanche,
you seen the bottle opener?

1620
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:30,764
I used to have a cousin who could open
a bottle of beer with his teeth.

1621
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:35,352
And that was all he could do.
He was just a human bottle-opener.

1622
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:40,649
Then one time at a wedding party,
he broke his front teeth right off.

1623
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,194
And then after that,
he was so ashamed of himself...

1624
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:47,781
...that he used to sneak out of the house
when company came.

1625
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,659
Rain from heaven.

1626
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:02,379
What do you say, Blanche? You want to
bury the hatchet and make a loving cup?

1627
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:04,547
No. No, thank you.

1628
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:08,343
- Why don't you get with it?
- What are you doing in here?

1629
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:11,262
Hey, wait a second.
I want to show you something.

1630
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:14,265
Here's something I always break out
on special occasions:

1631
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:16,267
Silk pajamas I wore
on my wedding night.

1632
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:18,895
When they call on that phone
and say, "You got a son"...

1633
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:21,982
...I'm gonna rip them off
and wave them like a flag!

1634
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,234
I guess we're both entitled
to put on a dog.

1635
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:27,696
You're having an oil millionaire
and I'm having the baby.

1636
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:32,742
When I think of how divine it'll be to
have such a thing as privacy once more...

1637
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,577
...I could weep with joy.

1638
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:37,789
This millionaire isn't gonna interfere
with your privacy none?

1639
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:40,709
It won't be the sort of thing
you have in mind.

1640
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,794
This man is a gentleman.
He respects me.

1641
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,587
What he wants is my companionship.

1642
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:47,173
Having great wealth
sometimes makes people lonely.

1643
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,926
A cultivated woman,
a woman of breeding and intelligence...

1644
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:53,513
...can enrich a man's life immeasurably.
I have those things to offer.

1645
01:45:53,681 --> 01:45:56,016
And time doesn't take them away.

1646
01:45:56,183 --> 01:46:01,062
Physical beauty is passing,
a transitory possession.

1647
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:06,192
But beauty of the mind, richness
of the spirit, tenderness of the heart...

1648
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:12,615
I have all those things... . Aren't taken
away, but grow, increase with the years.

1649
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:14,242
Oh.

1650
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:19,748
Strange that I should be called
a destitute woman...

1651
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:23,960
...when I have all these treasures
locked in my heart.

1652
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:28,631
I think of myself as a very,
very rich woman.

1653
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:32,677
But I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before...

1654
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:33,970
Swine, huh?

1655
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:37,140
Yes. Swine.

1656
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,810
And I'm thinking not only of you but
of Mr. Mitchell. He came here tonight.

1657
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:44,606
He dared to come in his work clothes to
repeat slander, vicious stories from you.

1658
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:46,608
I gave him his walking papers.

1659
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:52,113
But then he returned. He returned with
a box of roses to beg my forgiveness.

1660
01:46:52,281 --> 01:46:54,532
He implored my forgiveness.

1661
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,369
But some things are not forgivable.

1662
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:04,084
Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable!

1663
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:07,003
It is one unforgivable thing,
in my opinion...

1664
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:09,506
...and the one thing
of which I have never...

1665
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:11,257
...never been guilty.

1666
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:14,677
So I said to him, "Thank you.

1667
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:18,223
It was foolish of me to think that
we could adapt ourselves to each other.

1668
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:21,851
Our ways of life are too different,
our backgrounds are incompatible.

1669
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:27,899
So farewell, my friend,
and let there be no hard feelings."

1670
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:48,878
Was this before or after
you got the telegram?

1671
01:47:49,505 --> 01:47:52,590
Telegram? What telegram?

1672
01:47:53,384 --> 01:47:56,636
- Heh. As a matter of fact, my wire...
- As a matter of fact...

1673
01:47:56,804 --> 01:47:59,222
...there wasn't no wire at all.

1674
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,145
And there isn't no millionaire.

1675
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:10,900
And Mitch didn't come in here with
roses, because I know where he is.

1676
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:15,989
And there isn't a thing but imagination
and lies and deceit and tricks.

1677
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:17,866
And look at yourself.

1678
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:21,077
Take a look at yourself here,
in a worn-out Mardi Gras outfit.

1679
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:25,081
Rented for 50 cents from some
rag picker with a crazy crown on.

1680
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,417
What kind of a queen
do you think you are?

1681
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:30,170
You know that I've been on to you
from the start...

1682
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:33,256
...and not once did you pull the wool
over this boy's eyes.

1683
01:48:33,549 --> 01:48:37,135
You come here and sprinkle the place
with powder and you spray perfume...

1684
01:48:37,303 --> 01:48:39,470
...and stick a paper lantern
over the light bulb.

1685
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:41,764
And lo and behold,
place is turned into Egypt...

1686
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:44,726
...and you're the queen of the Nile,
sitting on your throne...

1687
01:48:44,894 --> 01:48:47,145
...swilling down my liquor.
You know what I say?

1688
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:48,980
Ha-ha!

1689
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:51,774
You hear me?

1690
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:53,651
Ha-ha-ha!

1691
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,399
Flowers.

1692
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:39,614
No.

1693
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,532
Not now.

1694
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:56,047
- Operator.
- What happened to long distance?

1695
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:58,800
Never mind long distance.
Get me Western Union.

1696
01:49:58,968 --> 01:50:02,762
Western Union? Hear me?
Take down this message:

1697
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:04,889
"Desperate, desperate circumstances.

1698
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:08,059
Caught in a trap. Help me.
Caught in a trap."

1699
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:14,816
Hello? Operator.
I can give you Western Union now.

1700
01:50:20,072 --> 01:50:21,864
Western Union.

1701
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:30,081
Hello? Western Union.

1702
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:33,918
This is Western Union.

1703
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:36,587
Hello.

1704
01:50:37,172 --> 01:50:39,090
You left the phone
off the hook, Blanche.

1705
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:41,551
This is Western Union.

1706
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:47,807
What?

1707
01:50:51,437 --> 01:50:52,895
Let me...

1708
01:50:53,355 --> 01:50:55,565
Let me get by you.

1709
01:50:56,317 --> 01:50:58,568
You wanna get by me? Go ahead.

1710
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:02,447
Stand over there.

1711
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:06,784
You got plenty of room
to get by me now.

1712
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:12,415
I've got to get out. Somehow.

1713
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:16,669
You think I'm gonna
interfere with you?

1714
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:33,227
You know, maybe you won't be bad
to interfere with.

1715
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:39,359
Stand back. Don't you come
toward me another step, or I'll...

1716
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:43,196
- You'll what?
- Some awful thing will happen. It will!

1717
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:47,033
What are you putting on now?

1718
01:51:55,959 --> 01:52:01,798
I warn you. Don't. I'm in danger!

1719
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:09,514
What did you do that for?

1720
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,976
So I could twist the broken end
in your face.

1721
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:19,148
- I bet you would do that.
- I would. I will, if you...

1722
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:21,234
Oh.

1723
01:52:24,863 --> 01:52:27,407
You wanna have
a little roughhouse, huh?

1724
01:52:29,827 --> 01:52:31,828
All right, let's have a little roughhouse.

1725
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:43,005
Tiger, tiger. Drop that bottle top.
Drop it!

1726
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:59,188
Oh, inside straight, man!

1727
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:02,692
Try it in English, mustache.

1728
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,695
- I'm cursing your rotten luck.
- You know what luck is?

1729
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:08,030
Luck is believing you're lucky,
that's all.

1730
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:11,534
Take at Salerno. I believed I was lucky.
I figured that four out of five...

1731
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,995
...wasn't gonna get through
but I would, and I did.

1732
01:53:14,163 --> 01:53:17,498
I stick that down as a rule: To hold
the front position in this rat race...

1733
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:19,208
...you gotta believe you're lucky.

1734
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:23,337
- You... You... You brag... Brag bull!
- What's the matter with you?

1735
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:27,300
I always said men was callous things
with no feeling, but this beats anything.

1736
01:53:27,468 --> 01:53:31,471
- Sitting there making pigs of yourselves.
- What's the matter with her?

1737
01:53:32,681 --> 01:53:34,223
Come on, deal.

1738
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,351
- Blanche?
- Bathing.

1739
01:53:37,603 --> 01:53:39,228
How's my baby?

1740
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:42,982
Sleeping like a little angel.
I brought you some grapes.

1741
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:46,611
- How is she?
- She wouldn't eat anything.

1742
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:50,156
I keep telling her we made arrangements
for her to rest in the country.

1743
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:53,534
She's got it all mixed-up in her mind
about a cruise to the islands...

1744
01:53:53,702 --> 01:53:55,912
...with Shep Huntleigh, an old beau...
BLANCHE: Stella?

1745
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:58,372
STELLA: Yes?
- If anyone calls while I'm bathing...

1746
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,833
...take the number,
tell them I'll call right back.

1747
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,627
- Yes, Blanche.
- Oh, and Stella.

1748
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:06,464
The... The cool yellow silk, the bouclÃ©,
see if it's crushed.

1749
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:10,384
If it's not too crushed, I'll wear it.
And on the lapel...

1750
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:14,180
...that silver and turquoise pin
in the shape of a seahorse.

1751
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:17,350
You'll find it in the heart-shaped box
I keep my accessories in.

1752
01:54:17,518 --> 01:54:21,729
Oh, and Stella, see if you can locate
a bunch of artificial...

1753
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:27,818
...violets in that box. I'll wear it with
the seahorse on the lapel of the jacket.

1754
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:43,000
I just don't know
if I've done the right thing.

1755
01:54:43,168 --> 01:54:44,669
What else could you do?

1756
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:47,630
I couldn't believe her story
and go on living with Stanley.

1757
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:51,759
Don't you never believe it.
You gotta keep on going, baby.

1758
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:54,845
No matter what happens,
we all gotta keep on going.

1759
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:56,806
- Stella?
- Yes, Blanche?

1760
01:54:57,057 --> 01:55:00,142
- Is the coast clear?
- Yes, honey.

1761
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,770
Close the curtains before I come out.

1762
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:05,398
Tell her how well she's looking.

1763
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:09,944
They're closed, honey.

1764
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:18,327
I just washed my hair.

1765
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:22,957
- Oh, did you?
- I'm not sure I got all the soap out.

1766
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:25,710
- Such fine hair.
- That's the problem.

1767
01:55:25,877 --> 01:55:28,504
- Did I get a call?
- Who from?

1768
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:32,508
- Shep Huntleigh.
- No, honey, not yet.

1769
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:35,219
- Strange.
- Come on, Mitch.

1770
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:44,562
Mitch?

1771
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:50,109
Oh.

1772
01:55:50,736 --> 01:55:52,695
What's happened here?

1773
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:55,156
I want an explanation
of what's happened here!

1774
01:55:55,324 --> 01:55:57,074
- Hush, please, Blanche.
- Honey...

1775
01:55:58,035 --> 01:56:00,536
What are you two
looking at me like that for?

1776
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:02,663
Is there something wrong with me?

1777
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:05,249
You look wonderful, Blanche.
Don't she look wonderful?

1778
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:08,836
- I understand you're going on a trip.
- Yes.

1779
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:11,464
Yes. Blanche is.
She's going on a vacation.

1780
01:56:11,632 --> 01:56:13,716
I'm green with envy.

1781
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:17,970
Help me, you two.
Help me get dressed.

1782
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:21,557
- Is this what you wanted?
- Yes, that'll do.

1783
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:24,435
I'm anxious to get out of this place.
This place is a trap.

1784
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:27,271
- Such a pretty lavender jacket.
- It's lilac-colored.

1785
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:30,483
You're, both of you, wrong.
It's Della Robbia blue.

1786
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:32,485
Are these grapes washed?

1787
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:35,529
- Washed, I said. Are they washed?
- From the French Market.

1788
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:38,240
That doesn't mean to say
they've been washed.

1789
01:56:42,204 --> 01:56:45,581
The cathedral chimes.
They're the only...

1790
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,959
...clean thing in the Quarter.

1791
01:56:50,379 --> 01:56:53,964
- I'm going now. I'm ready to go.
- She'll walk out before they get here.

1792
01:56:54,591 --> 01:56:56,467
Wait, Blanche!

1793
01:56:57,260 --> 01:56:59,970
Must we pass in front of those men?

1794
01:57:00,138 --> 01:57:02,473
Why don't you wait here
till that game breaks up.

1795
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,266
Yes, honey, sit down.

1796
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,483
Tell them to wait outside.

1797
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:17,738
Would you mind waiting outside just a
couple of seconds? They'll be right out.

1798
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:30,710
Someone is calling for Blanche.

1799
01:57:31,962 --> 01:57:34,088
It is for me, then.

1800
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:37,425
Is it the gentleman
I was expecting from Dallas?

1801
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:38,843
Yes.

1802
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:41,387
Yes, honey, I believe it is.

1803
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:44,348
Why...

1804
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:47,476
I'm not quite ready.

1805
01:57:49,146 --> 01:57:51,480
Ask them to wait outside.

1806
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,316
Everything packed?

1807
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:56,193
Stanley.

1808
01:57:56,528 --> 01:57:57,820
She'll be out in a minute.

1809
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,534
- They're waiting outside the house.
- "They"?

1810
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:05,995
Who's "they"?

1811
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:09,206
There's a lady with him.

1812
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:13,627
I can't imagine who this lady can be.

1813
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:15,504
How is she dressed?

1814
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:20,760
Just a plain tailored outfit.

1815
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:26,390
Possibly she?

1816
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:36,776
Shall we go now, Blanche?

1817
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:55,336
- Must we go through that room?
- I'll go with you.

1818
01:58:57,714 --> 01:59:00,841
- How do I look?
- Lovely.

1819
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:02,927
Lovely.

1820
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:16,899
Please don't get up.
I'm only passing through.

1821
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:27,243
You...

1822
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:29,578
...are not the gentleman...

1823
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:31,956
...I was expecting.

1824
01:59:33,792 --> 01:59:36,252
This man isn't Shep Huntleigh.

1825
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:46,512
You forget something, Blanche?

1826
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:53,310
Yes. Yes, I forgot something.

1827
01:59:54,771 --> 01:59:56,605
What are they gonna do to her?

1828
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:58,899
Don't let them hurt her.

1829
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:02,152
- What are they gonna do to her?
- Shh. Honey...

1830
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:06,657
Hello, Blanche.

1831
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,625
She says she forgot something.

1832
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:19,086
That's all right.

1833
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:23,799
Well, what did you forget, Blanche?

1834
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:29,179
- It don't matter. We can pick it up later.
- We'll send it along with your trunk.

1835
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:38,272
I don't know you.

1836
02:00:38,481 --> 02:00:41,734
- I want to be left alone, please!
- Now, Blanche...

1837
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:47,948
Blanche, you left nothing here
but spilt talcum and old perfume bottles.

1838
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:52,494
Unless it's the paper lantern you want to
take with you. You want the lantern?

1839
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:13,557
MITCH:
You done this to her.

1840
02:01:13,892 --> 02:01:17,353
- Come on, stop it.
- Stop it, will you!

1841
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,022
He did this to her, I know...

1842
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:22,066
He must be nuts.

1843
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,448
What are you looking at?

1844
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,700
I never once touched her.

1845
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:40,084
These fingernails have to be trimmed.
Jacket, doctor?

1846
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:43,045
Not unless necessary.

1847
02:01:44,089 --> 02:01:45,547
Miss DuBois.

1848
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:04,900
Please...

1849
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:07,569
It won't be necessary.

1850
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:10,864
Ask her...

1851
02:02:11,032 --> 02:02:13,492
...to let go of me.

1852
02:02:13,952 --> 02:02:16,912
Yes. Let go.

1853
02:02:51,906 --> 02:02:53,907
Whoever you are...

1854
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:57,453
...I have always depended
on the kindness...

1855
02:02:57,871 --> 02:02:59,788
...of strangers.

1856
02:03:27,567 --> 02:03:29,401
- Blanche.
- Come on, honey.

1857
02:03:29,569 --> 02:03:32,821
Don't you touch me.
Don't you ever touch me again.

1858
02:03:56,638 --> 02:03:58,472
Stella!

1859
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:03,477
Come on, Stella.

1860
02:04:03,728 --> 02:04:08,440
No, I'm not. I'm not going back
in there again. Not this time.

1861
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:10,818
Never going back. Never.

1862
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:13,112
Hey, Stella!

1863
02:04:14,572 --> 02:04:18,200
Hey, Stella!
