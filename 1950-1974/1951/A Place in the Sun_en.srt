1
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,672
You want a ride?

2
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,637
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,798
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Mr Charles Eastman.

4
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,117
So would l. I expect to
if I work another five years!

5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,279
- How do I get to his office?
- Go to the administration building.

6
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,273
Just a moment.

7
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,752
- Mr Eastman?
- Yes.

8
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,397
I'm sorry. our Mr Eastman is
at home today. He won't be in.

9
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,033
He won't?

10
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,993
- Are you a relative?
- He's my uncle.

11
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,352
I'm sure he'll want to see you.
Let me give him a ring.

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,956
Yes, one moment, please.

13
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,110
Paris can dictate to women what to
wear at a cocktail party or to bed.

14
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,279
Paris is not going to tell American
women what bathing suits to wear!

15
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,675
- Miss ottinger.
- Hello.

16
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,193
Who?

17
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,950
Yes, of course. All right, let me
have a word with the young man.

18
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,311
- Thank you.
- It's on number two.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,309
- Hello.
- Hello, my boy.

20
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,354
- I hope you remember, sir.
- of course. How are you?

21
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,630
You certainly got here fast.

22
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,435
I wanted to. But I didn't want
to bother you at home.

23
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,030
Drop by to the house
at about seven o'clock.

24
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,471
Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir.

25
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,077
My tie on crooked?

26
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,038
No, it's just that I was thinking...
George Eastman's dropping in tonight.

27
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,360
George Eastman...?
You mean Asa's son?

28
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,554
- Right. I ran into him in Chicago.
- Will he lead us in a prayer?

29
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,912
He's not at all like Asa or his wife.
He's very quiet and pleasant.

30
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,797
Not much education, but ambitious.
And he looks amazingly like Earl.

31
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,195
- What's he do?
- Hotel bellhop.

32
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,595
I always wanted
to look like a bellhop!

33
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,950
Why bring him on here?

34
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,355
There's always a place at the plant.

35
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,872
- What do we do about him socially?
- Easy. Leave town.

36
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,790
You don't have to take him up
socially. He just wants to work.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,632
- A man by the name of Eastman.
- Show him in, William.

38
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,595
Charles, sometimes I think
you're in your second childhood.

39
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,958
- Good evening, sir.
- Hi, George.

40
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,358
This is my wife.

41
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,109
My daughter, Marcia.
My son, Earl. George Eastman.

42
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,796
Sit down, George.

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,039
- Like a cocktail, a drink?
- No, thank you.

44
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,836
My husband says he met you
in Chicago at a hotel.

45
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,874
- That's right.
- You must have left very suddenly.

46
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,436
Well, you see, I quit my job.

47
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,429
Mr Eastman was good enough to say
that if I came through here,

48
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,518
he might find some place for me.

49
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,632
I think we can work something out.

50
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,628
- What do you think, Earl?
- Done any bookkeeping?

51
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,195
- Typewriting? Stenography?
- No.

52
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,834
You see Earl in the morning.

53
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,555
Thank you, sir.
That's very kind of you.

54
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,833
And your mother? I trust she's well.

55
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,952
We've never met,
but I've heard her mentioned.

56
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,233
She wrote Charles a moving letter
at the time of your father's death.

57
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,398
Is she still active
in her religious work?

58
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,558
- Yes, ma'am, she is.
- Church work?

59
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,630
Not exactly. It's more like
social work. It's a mission.

60
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,796
Like the Salvation Army?

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,959
No, it's not like the Salvation Army.

62
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,072
- It's more...
- More intimate, maybe?

63
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,794
Did I hear you say intimate, darling?

64
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,275
- You're late.
- I'm always late.

65
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,950
It's part of my charm. Good evening,
Mr Eastman, Mrs Eastman.

66
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,752
You know Tom Tipton.

67
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,235
Don't drink. We haven't got time.

68
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,115
- Thanks.
- Well, I'm ready.

69
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,356
Men are so disgustingly prompt!

70
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,711
They do it to put us women
in a bad light.

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,990
I hear your place is
coming along fine.

72
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,716
- It's a dream palace.
- Will it be ready for summer?

73
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,471
- Even if I have to whip everyone!
- All right, Simone Legree. Let's go.

74
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,956
- Goodnight, Eastman.
- Good night.

75
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,713
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

76
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,955
Have you anywhere to stay?

77
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,674
I can recommend a quiet
rooming house.

78
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,555
- My secretary used to stay there.
- Thanks. I found a place.

79
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,354
That was fortunate, wasn't it?

80
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,950
Sorry we're not home for dinner.
Another time perhaps.

81
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,470
Yes. You see Earl in the morning.
Good night.

82
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,468
- Good night, sir. Good night.
- Good night.

83
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,273
Charles Eastman!

84
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,836
Be aware every minute
that you're an Eastman.

85
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,716
- You must act accordingly.
- I understand that.

86
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,114
Another thing.

87
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,552
As you noticed, nine out of ten
Eastman employees are women.

88
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,753
There's a company rule against
mixing with the girls here.

89
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,796
My father asked me to call this
to your attention. That is a must.

90
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,673
This is George Eastman.
Take George to Mr Whiting, please.

91
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,398
Mrs Kovak, this is George Eastman.

92
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,795
- He's here for a while.
- oK.

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,274
This is it.

94
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,751
Now you're in business.

95
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,592
- Hello, Angela.
- Hi, Angela.

96
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,471
Look, this room could be your study.

97
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,116
There's even an old cupboard
for your books.

98
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,869
Whatever else is in it,
it isn't books!

99
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,356
- Who lived here?
- A pirate in search of his soul.

100
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,994
Think he found it?

101
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,792
- Vicky...
- What?

102
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,958
Could we be happy here,
never seeing anyone again?

103
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,358
- Small world.
- That's what you think.

104
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,518
Put your arms around me.
Imagine the sea at night.

105
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,678
Who's your friend?

106
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,758
Hold me, Ray.

107
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,274
When I feel you close,
all our lies come true.

108
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,870
Nothing can ever spoil them again.

109
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:51,114
If the girls saw me, they'd say
I was making up to the boss's nephew.

110
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,995
That's silly.
I'm in the same boat as you.

111
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,873
An Eastman isn't in the same boat
with anyone.

112
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,117
- I work along with you, don't l?
- Sure.

113
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,598
They'll move you to a better job,
and you'll be in the front office.

114
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,758
That's the last we'll see
of Mr George Eastman.

115
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,234
Who says that?

116
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,671
We know they put you
in with us to learn the business.

117
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,599
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

118
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,633
...Lord's divine command,

119
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,755
when you find a brother struggling,

120
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,717
Iend a willing, helping hand.

121
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,879
Bear ye one another's burdens...

122
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,788
- You lonely all the time?
- Not on week days.

123
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,276
How come?

124
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,274
Remember I put swimsuits
in boxes six days a week?

125
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,917
Yeah. What about Sundays? Maybe
then you put yourself in a swimsuit.

126
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,513
Not me.

127
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,708
Why? You don't look good
in a swimsuit?

128
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,438
- Sure I do. I can't swim.
- You're kidding!

129
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,476
I never learned.

130
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,469
I was even scared of the duck pond
when I was a kid.

131
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,594
We lived on a farm, a small one.

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,956
How come you came here?

133
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,478
We were poor. We needed the money.

134
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,318
I came down here and got a job.

135
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,832
- I'm glad.
- Me, too.

136
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,956
This is it, where I live.

137
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,318
- It's 4433½ Elm Avenue.
- I'll walk you to the door.

138
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,559
I can manage from here.
I have my own private entrance.

139
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,273
Good night.

140
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,956
My landlady is fierce.

141
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,640
I've wanted to do that for so long.

142
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,354
I did, too.

143
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,193
Will we see each other again
like this?

144
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,312
- If you want.
- When?

145
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,159
It's up to you. You gotta be careful.

146
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,229
We can meet like tonight.
Tonight has been wonderful!

147
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,036
I'd better go in now.

148
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,753
Don't go.

149
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,072
Please don't go.

150
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,953
Good night.

151
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,074
- I was looking over at you today.
- I was looking over at you.

152
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,555
Not as much as usual.

153
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,788
- I was thinking about my plan.
- Don't we work fast enough as it is?

154
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,275
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hello, Angela.

155
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,594
George, I'm glad you're still
in the packaging room.

156
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,519
Not just for my sake, honest.

157
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,032
It's better for you than running
around with those Eastmans

158
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,277
and all those rich girls
with nothing to do.

159
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,632
I've only been out to the house
once since I got here.

160
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,593
I used to think you went every night.

161
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,870
Don't be silly, honey.

162
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,468
George, remember when I said

163
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,629
if you're an Eastman, you're not
in the same boat with anybody?

164
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,273
Yeah.

165
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,352
I take it back.

166
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,196
Let's find a quieter place.

167
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,116
You don't know any other place
we can go, do you?

168
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,757
There's a soda fountain
where all the high school kids go.

169
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,632
They're noisy.

170
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,278
I don't care as long as I'm with you.

171
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,479
- What are you doing here?
- Talking.

172
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,479
They've invented the house.
It's a very good place to talk in.

173
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,070
You'd better get back to yours.
Come on.

174
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,714
Come on.

175
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,272
- Good night.
- Come on.

176
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,437
I wish I could ask you in,
but Mrs Roberts is so strict.

177
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,598
I don't want to make things
difficult for you.

178
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,154
I wish I could ask you in, but we'd
have to keep the music awful low.

179
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,797
This is nice.

180
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,753
Mrs Roberts is right next door.

181
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,433
This is the way it should have been.

182
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,957
This is the way...

183
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,192
oh, George.

184
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,879
George.

185
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,069
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

186
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,116
Who's that? Is that George?

187
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,390
- Yeah.
- What's he doing here?

188
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,637
It was the only place to put him
without firing somebody.

189
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,956
This is no place for him.

190
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,596
- How's he getting along?
- Fine.

191
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,115
It wouldn't hurt to give him
a position. Well, George.

192
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,073
You thought I'd forgotten
all about you.

193
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,716
- No, sir.
- I've been keeping an eye on you.

194
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,233
- That's very good of you, sir.
- Getting along all right?

195
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,115
- I know the work pretty well.
- I suppose you do.

196
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,756
Do you know it well enough
to take on responsibility?

197
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,589
- Yes, sir.
- Good. I'm going to move you up.

198
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,236
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You've earned it.

199
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,431
Sir, I was wondering...

200
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,548
Have you by any chance seen
the production report I submitted?

201
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,231
Mrs Eastman is having a party at
the house on the 1 5th of next month.

202
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,637
- We'd like to have you drop in.
- I'd love to come.

203
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,595
Good. Then you and I can have
a nice little talk.

204
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,514
Next month on the 1 5th?

205
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,633
That's your birthday.
I was planning on our little party.

206
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,796
Sure, honey.

207
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,276
I'll just be at the old man's
to pay my respects.

208
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,914
- Then I'll be over.
- You better be!

209
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,593
- Hello, darling!
- Nice to see you again.

210
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,074
Hello, there.

211
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,634
Later.

212
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,674
- Hello.
- Hello.

213
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,433
- I see you had a misspent youth.
- Yes, it was.

214
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,118
Why all alone? Being exclusive?

215
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,276
Being dramatic?

216
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,479
Being blue?

217
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,796
I'm just fooling around.
Maybe you'd like to play.

218
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,515
No, I'll just watch you. Go ahead.

219
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,034
Do I make you nervous?

220
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,194
Yes.

221
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,756
You look like an Eastman.
Are you one of them?

222
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,315
I'm a nephew. My name's George.

223
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,954
- I'm Angela.
- Vickers.

224
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,357
- I saw you here last spring.
- I don't remember seeing you.

225
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,317
No. You've been away, haven't you?
You took a trip with your parents.

226
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,149
- How did you know?
- I read about you in the papers.

227
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,473
- What else do you do?
- The usual things.

228
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,194
You look unusual.

229
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,272
That's the first time
anybody ever said that!

230
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,429
- You keep pretty much to yourself.
- Yes, sometimes.

231
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,069
Blue...or exclusive?

232
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,512
- Neither, right now.
- Here you are, George!

233
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,039
Well, Angela.

234
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,916
- I was thinking how's your mother?
- Fine, last time I heard.

235
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,638
Have you written to her about your
promotion? I kicked him up a notch.

236
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,910
I'll write in a day or two.

237
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,954
Never neglect your mother.
Telephone to her right away.

238
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,675
Tell her the good news.
You can use this phone.

239
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,668
Long distance? What's the number,
George? Just a minute.

240
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,272
I don't know.

241
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,114
Hello.

242
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,838
I want to place a call to the Bethel
lndependent Mission in Kansas City.

243
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,274
- The Bethel Mission.
- Hello, Mama.

244
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,996
George! God bless you, my son.
Are you sick?

245
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,156
No, I'm not sick.

246
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,635
Are you're coming home?

247
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,515
Listen, Mama. I got a promotion.

248
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,269
Yeah, I can send you money
every month now.

249
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,073
Happy birthday. Today's your
birthday and I've prayed for you.

250
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,308
I've been praying you'll come home
and carry on your father's work.

251
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,868
I'm keeping your room for you, just
as you left it, like I always do.

252
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,031
I'm getting on pretty well here.
I'm happy here, too.

253
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,113
- Who's there with you?
- It's me, Mama!

254
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,630
- Who was that?
- Just a girl, Mama.

255
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,594
No, Mama.

256
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,471
I don't... Mama, I just met her!

257
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,958
Yes, Mama. I will, Mama.

258
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,232
I know you'll be a good son.

259
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,912
I promise.

260
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,554
- Goodbye, my son.
- Goodbye, Mama.

261
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,789
Did you promise to be a good boy?
Not to waste your time on girls?

262
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,470
- I don't waste my time.
- Will she let you go out tonight?

263
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,831
Will she let you go dancing? Come on.

264
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,874
I'll take you dancing...
on your birthday, blue boy.

265
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,510
Gee, Al, isn't it the limit?

266
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,279
The party just broke up
a few minutes ago.

267
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,276
I'm sorry, honey.

268
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,073
I couldn't get away for three hours.

269
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,711
Four hours. You must have paid him
an awful lot of respects.

270
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,273
He's really gonna do things for me.

271
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,270
He said, "l got my eye on you."
I think he really means it, too.

272
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,199
That's fine.
But you could have phoned me.

273
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,195
- Yeah, I know, I could have phoned.
- Never mind.

274
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,953
Your present's waiting for you
on your plate.

275
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,435
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

276
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,117
Hey, that's wonderful! I can sure
use that on my new job, huh?

277
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,957
Were there many young people
there tonight?

278
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,118
- A few. Why?
- oh, it's melted.

279
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,758
Was your cousin Marcia there?

280
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,788
All those pretty girls in the papers?

281
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,073
Some of them were, yes.
They're not all pretty.

282
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,675
- Was Angela Vickers?
- What?

283
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,197
Pretty. Did you like her very much?

284
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,630
I liked her some.
Sure, she's a pretty girl.

285
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,960
- She wears nice clothes.
- Why shouldn't she, with that money?

286
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,754
Why do you keep needling me?

287
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,916
I can't help it.

288
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,435
Why couldn't you tell them
you had an appointment?

289
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,158
You know I can't tell them about you.
You understand the fix we're in.

290
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,513
Yeah, I know.

291
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,549
If my family ever found out about us,
we'd both be out of a job.

292
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,437
George, maybe you don't want to see
me so much any more. Is that it?

293
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,959
Maybe you don't want
to see me at all.

294
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,314
- Now you're head of the department.
- You know I didn't say that.

295
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,476
Honey, don't cry.

296
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,958
Look, you dance just as pretty
as anybody. You look just as pretty.

297
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,833
Stop crying, will you?

298
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,958
George, it's awful.

299
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,038
I can't tell you.

300
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,676
- What is it?
- I'm so afraid.

301
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,115
Honey, what's the matter?

302
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,229
George...we're in trouble.

303
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,989
Real trouble, I think.

304
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,875
How do you mean?

305
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,472
Remember the first night
you came here?

306
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,276
I'm so worried.

307
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,358
Hello, Al. It's me. How do you feel?

308
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,834
Just the same, huh?

309
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,199
No, I haven't found the name
of any doctor yet.

310
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,469
Yes, don't you worry. Everything's
gonna turn out all right.

311
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,274
Yeah.

312
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,676
Yeah, first thing.

313
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,794
Good night.

314
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,794
Hello?

315
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,673
Speaking.

316
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,954
Who?

317
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,192
oh, hello!

318
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,517
Yes, of course I remember you. I just
didn't recognise your voice at first.

319
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,391
Friday night? Yeah.

320
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,356
I think I can.

321
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,957
No, I'd like to. Yes.

322
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,954
Where?

323
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,193
All right. I'll meet you there.

324
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,516
Yeah. Goodbye, Miss Vickers.

325
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,874
Huh?

326
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,151
Goodbye, Angela.

327
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,560
- A penny.
- For what?

328
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,991
For your thoughts.
Highest prices paid.

329
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,876
I was wondering
why you invited me tonight.

330
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,958
Because of my reasons.

331
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,753
Good evening, Miss Vickers.
Good evening, Mr Eastman.

332
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,353
Good evening.

333
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,319
- Angela, darling, hello.
- Hello, Marcia.

334
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,671
- Hello, George. Having fun?
- I just got here.

335
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,871
Come on in and join the party.

336
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,311
It's going to be
such a wonderful summer.

337
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,876
- Do you ride?
- I'm just taking it up.

338
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,595
Hello, Mother, Dad.
We keep several horses.

339
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,873
There'll be lots of parties
and dances and things like that.

340
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,355
And who, may I ask, is he?

341
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,759
If she weren't my daughter,
I'd ask her the same question.

342
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,836
Aren't you happy with me?

343
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,476
Happy? The trouble is
I'm too happy tonight.

344
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,471
You seem so strange,
so deep and far away.

345
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,518
As though you were
holding something back.

346
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,870
- I am.
- Don't.

347
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,435
I'd better.

348
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,956
This is nice.
I don't want to spoil it.

349
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,435
You'd better tell me.

350
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,191
I love you. I've loved you
since the first moment I saw you.

351
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,359
I guess maybe I even loved you
before I saw you.

352
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,116
And you're the fellow that wondered
why I invited you here tonight.

353
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,633
I tell you why. I love...
Are they watching us?

354
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,149
I love you, too! It scares me.

355
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,555
- But it is a wonderful feeling.
- It's wonderful when you're here.

356
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,117
I can hold you, I can see you.
I can hold you next to me.

357
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,630
But what's it going to be like
next week?

358
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,435
I'll still be as much in love
with you. You'll be gone!

359
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,189
But I'll be at the lake!
You'll come and see me.

360
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,755
It's so beautiful. You must come.

361
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,076
I know my parents will be a problem.

362
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,875
But you can come the weekends
when the kids are there.

363
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,755
You don't have to work weekends.
That's the best time.

364
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,033
If you don't come,
I'll drive down here to see you.

365
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,754
I'll pick you up outside the factory.

366
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,392
You'll be my pick-up! We'll arrange
it somehow, whatever way we can.

367
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,310
We'll have such wonderful times
together, just the two of us.

368
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,956
- I'd be the happiest person alive.
- The second happiest.

369
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,119
Angela, if I could only tell you
how much I love you.

370
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,474
- If I could only tell you all.
- Tell Mama.

371
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,316
Tell Mama all.

372
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,438
- Your age, Mrs Hamilton?
- Twenty-two.

373
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,715
How long married?

374
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,557
Three months.

375
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,635
Well, now... Sit down.

376
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,869
What seems to be the trouble,
Mrs Hamilton?

377
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,356
You needn't be afraid to tell me.

378
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,519
That's my business,
listening to other people's troubles.

379
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,319
It's like this.

380
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,196
My husband hasn't much money.

381
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,188
I have to work
to help pay the expenses.

382
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,279
Yes?

383
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,268
When I found out I was going
to have a baby...

384
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,395
...we didn't see...

385
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,357
We didn't know any doctors.

386
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,199
What business is your husband in?

387
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,033
Electrician.

388
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,518
That's not such a bad business.
At least they charge enough!

389
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,598
- We can't afford to...
- There are free hospitals, you know?

390
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,272
I know.

391
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,152
Free hospitals
don't solve everything.

392
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,354
Tell me, how did you happen
to come to me, anyhow?

393
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,630
I heard people say
you were a good doctor.

394
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,398
I see.

395
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,117
Mrs Hamilton, when you went
to the altar three months ago,

396
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,952
you must have realised you might
have to face a situation like this.

397
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,709
once you make up your mind
to face this bravely,

398
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,313
you'll find all the problems
have a way of sorting themselves out.

399
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,878
Medical bills, clothes. I know.

400
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,069
I know my wife and l
worried at first.

401
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,154
- But now we can look back...
- It's not like that!

402
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,796
I'm not married.

403
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,833
I haven't got a husband.

404
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,675
All right, that won't do any good.

405
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,599
- Where's the young man?
- He deserted me. What'll I do?

406
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,594
Somebody's gotta help me.

407
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,750
Miss Hamilton, my advice is go home
and see your parents and tell them.

408
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,069
It'll be much better that way,
I assure you.

409
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,639
If you've come to place yourself
under my care during your pregnancy,

410
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,470
I'll do everything to ensure
your health and that of your child.

411
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,274
on the other hand,
if you've just come for free advice

412
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,359
on material and financial problems...

413
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,633
...with which I can't help you...

414
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,513
No, I cannot help you.

415
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,231
What did he say?

416
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,309
He said he thought I ought
to make a very healthy mother.

417
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,794
Gee, Al.

418
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,434
That's all you've said for weeks.

419
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,676
I'm trying to think.

420
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,276
You just gotta marry me.

421
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,916
Family or no family.
This future of yours or no future.

422
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,948
Just looking at it that way
settles everything.

423
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,597
But we haven't got any money.
This thing comes out, I'm through.

424
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,870
I won't even have the job I got now.

425
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,789
- You're just stalling.
- I'm not! I'm trying to think.

426
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,956
I want to figure out some way.

427
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,959
I was thinking maybe when I get
my vacation, first week of September.

428
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,435
All right, that's when we'll do it.

429
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,316
When you get your vacation,
we'll go out of town and get married.

430
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,911
- You understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

431
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,675
Now back again to the news.

432
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,715
It seems the fine weather has been
too fine in parts of the country.

433
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,435
In New York City, seven persons
are reported as having succumbed

434
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,676
from the high temperature.

435
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,509
Nearer home, fine weather
had its darker aspects, too.

436
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,838
The State Highway Patrol says that
fatalities from weekend accidents

437
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,999
exceeded by four the figure for the
corresponding weekend last summer.

438
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,320
Some 1 4 persons lost their lives.
At least five were drowned.

439
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,479
Several others received emergency
first aid at crowded lake resorts.

440
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,113
So be careful.

441
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,518
It may be your turn next or
the turn of those dearest to you.

442
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,477
Drive carefully, and don't swim
from unpatrolled beaches.

443
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,355
Make your holiday
death's holiday, too.

444
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,473
George!

445
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,993
Hello, you.

446
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:20,952
- I've missed you so!
- Me, too. I can't tell you how much.

447
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,352
I've wonderful news.

448
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,949
I had to drive down to tell you.

449
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,109
Mother and Dad want you to spend
your vacation with us up at the lake.

450
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,389
- You'll come, won't you?
- I don't think I can.

451
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:42,869
George, no! This is my one chance
to show you off to Mother and Dad.

452
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,469
Take my word for it, I've got to!

453
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,116
I promised my uncle
I'd spend some time with him.

454
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:55,634
That's perfect! Your aunt and uncle
are both coming up on 3rd September.

455
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,149
That's when you're coming.

456
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,469
Darling, I love you so much,
so very much.

457
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,036
Just think of it.

458
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,516
We'll go swimming together,
lie in the sun together,

459
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,717
go horseback riding
through the pine woods.

460
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,879
I'll make breakfast for you every
morning, and you can sleep late.

461
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,038
I'll bring it in to you in your room.

462
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,710
- And you love me.
- Yes.

463
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,199
- Hello?
- I've gotta ask you a favour.

464
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,315
Don't get angry at me.
I've gotta ask you for an extra week.

465
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,310
- I don't have to give you anything.
- You just got to!

466
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,310
I talked to my uncle and
he wants me to come up to the lake

467
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,308
and spend the first week
of my vacation with them.

468
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,795
- It's important to both of us.
- Why?

469
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,312
I figure from the way he's been
talking that if I go up there

470
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,636
he's gonna give me a bonus.

471
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,799
It might be a lot of money,
I don't know, $300.

472
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,956
We could sure use that.

473
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,551
All right, you go up there
for a week. I'll wait here.

474
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,753
I want to talk to you about that.

475
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,349
I'm not sure I approve
of young Mr Eastman.

476
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,554
- I don't know what he's doing here.
- He's here because I invited him.

477
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,115
Why do you encourage this?

478
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,788
You can be very unperceptive
at times.

479
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,356
opposition only makes a boy
of that type more attractive.

480
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,677
I invited him,
because I wanted to see him

481
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,838
among people Angela really knows.

482
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,358
She'll see whether he belongs or not.

483
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,632
Come on! It's freezing!
It's just like ice!

484
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,438
Hurry up!

485
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,512
I've never been so cold in my life!

486
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,188
- Aren't you going in?
- Sure.

487
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,988
George, put me down!

488
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,355
- It happens every single time!
- What does?

489
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,472
I freeze to death.
It's the coldest lake ever!

490
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,310
- What did you go in for, then?
- 'Cause it's my lake.

491
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,750
- Yours?
- Uh-huh.

492
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,190
I found this trail when I was 1 4.

493
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,949
Nobody lives here,
not on this part of it.

494
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,709
It's in two parts
with a little channel in between.

495
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:54,278
There's a crumbly old lodge down at
the end and some crumbly old boats.

496
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,513
Come closer.

497
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,312
- What do they call this lake?
- Loon Lake. It's nice now.

498
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,956
But sometimes it's weird,
especially at sundown.

499
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,356
I've never been able to feel
the same about it since the drowning.

500
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,792
- What drowning?
- A man and a girl last summer.

501
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,509
Nobody knows what happened. It was
five days before they found the girl.

502
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,918
- And the man?
- They never found him.

503
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,718
- What was that?
- A loon.

504
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,078
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

505
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,636
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,311
And I used to think
I was complicated!

507
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,798
- Are you worried about my family?
- I suppose I am.

508
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,949
Don't. I've known them intimately
for years, and they're quite nice.

509
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,189
Perhaps they are a little unused
to you, but that'll come in time.

510
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,356
Suppose it doesn't?

511
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:28,075
- I'd go anywhere with you.
- You mean that? You'd marry me?

512
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,875
Haven't I told you? I intend to.

513
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,956
...I've had a millstone named
Eastman round my neck.

514
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,799
I know just how you feel.

515
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,073
- What's golf got that a hike hasn't?
- A spirit of competition.

516
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,636
I've hardly exchanged five words
with your elusive nephew.

517
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,709
Pity, I'm told he's charming. I've
put him here so he won't run away.

518
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,356
I'm proud of the way
you've been getting on.

519
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,552
I've wanted to justify
your confidence in me.

520
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,197
A man who can meet people:
that's an asset we can use.

521
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,598
I've been thinking about a place
in administration perhaps,

522
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,439
where I can keep an eye on you.

523
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,598
We ought to take George
with us tomorrow.

524
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,360
- People at the club...
- No.

525
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,155
There's the Ski Race tomorrow
and George is my pilot.

526
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,794
- Which Mr Eastman?
- Mr George Eastman.

527
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,633
Call for you, George. You'd better
bend an ear, Angela, it's a woman.

528
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,114
Hello?

529
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,915
- Yes.
- I'm here at the bus station.

530
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,113
You lied to me for the last time.
Now I want you to come and get me.

531
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,596
- It's not too easy right now.
- Now!

532
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,631
- I'll do it tomorrow morning?
- I said now!

533
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,039
If you're not here in half an hour,
I'll come and tell them everything!

534
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,676
Yes, I'll leave right away.

535
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,909
Let's not go to Florida this winter.
Let's stay here.

536
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,472
It was a friend of my mother's.
She's not well.

537
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,593
- I hope it's not serious.
- I don't know.

538
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,118
I ought to get home.
I ought get a plane tonight.

539
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,598
- If it's not serious, do come back.
- I will, thank you.

540
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,839
- If you'll excuse me, I'll go pack.
- Certainly. Goodbye, George.

541
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,508
Goodbye, George.

542
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,716
George, how long will you be gone?

543
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,276
I don't know, darling.
I just don't know.

544
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,438
You will come back
as soon as you can?

545
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,315
- As soon as I can.
- You promise?

546
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,033
I promise.

547
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,320
Are you crazy, coming up here?

548
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,717
Phoning me like that
with my whole family listening in?

549
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,516
You weren't staying with your family.
You were staying with Angela Vickers.

550
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,718
I'm through waiting for you.

551
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,434
You're gonna marry me tomorrow,

552
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,760
or I'll tell the newspapers
everything, then I'll kill myself!

553
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,476
- Don't talk like that.
- You make me talk like that.

554
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,639
We'll go to Warsaw in the morning
and get married.

555
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,517
Let's get out of here.

556
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:38,555
I won't get out of here until
you say that you're gonna do it!

557
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,716
All right. Come on.

558
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,954
It's a holiday.

559
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,434
Look, Al.

560
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,555
Look, it's not my fault!

561
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,709
Besides, one day more is
not gonna make any difference.

562
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,630
There's a wonderful lake
near here, Loon Lake,

563
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,276
just the place you've always
wanted to go for a honeymoon.

564
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,836
We could go there.
There's a lodge on it, too.

565
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,998
If you like, we could spend
the day there,

566
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,636
and tomorrow
we can come back here.

567
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,799
- Al, are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

568
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:58,197
Tell you what, let's make a holiday
of it. Everybody else is.

569
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,190
Why don't we get some sandwiches
and have a picnic on the lake?

570
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,791
- How's that?
- That sounds pretty good.

571
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,348
Look, Al, let's not quarrel any more.
Let's try and make the best of it.

572
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,472
All right, let's make the best of it.

573
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,152
I should have stopped at that
last station. Yep, bone dry!

574
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,196
- Stupid!
- Is the lodge far from here?

575
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,358
No, it's only just around the bend.

576
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:07,279
Tell you what, why don't we take
our lunch and go down to the landing?

577
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,995
We can rent a boat
and have our picnic now.

578
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,716
I can pick up the gas later
and come back for the car.

579
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,232
- How does it sound?
- It sounds wonderful!

580
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,198
- It is beautiful!
- Yeah.

581
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,110
- How much to rent a boat?
- 25 cents an hour. $2 all day.

582
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,796
Are there many people
out on the lake today?

583
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,753
You've got it all to yourself.

584
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,879
- Are you people at the lodge?
- Yeah. That is, we will be tonight.

585
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,915
- Spend a couple of days there.
- You'll have to sign for it.

586
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,838
Sure.

587
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,636
Thanks a lot.

588
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,310
- That's funny.
- What?

589
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,640
I know another guy named Gilbert
Edwards. Lives over at Westbrook.

590
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,318
Pretty common name.

591
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,078
only two times I ever heard.

592
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,553
- It doesn't leak, does it?
- I don't rent leaky boats!

593
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,514
Don't worry, my husband's
a very good swimmer.

594
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,276
It's so lonely here.

595
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,037
It's like we were the only
two people left in the world.

596
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,753
Maybe we are.

597
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,748
Maybe when we get back to shore,
everybody will have disappeared.

598
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,555
I'd like that, wouldn't you?

599
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,031
Then we could go anywhere.

600
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,676
We could live
in the biggest house in the world.

601
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,874
I'd like to live in a little house,
just big enough for the two of us.

602
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,276
only there's gonna be
more than two of us.

603
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,555
What's the matter? You look sick.

604
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,355
Nothing! I'm out of breath.
I'm not used to rowing.

605
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,680
Rest for a while, dear.
We can just drift.

606
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,878
After all, we're not going anywhere.

607
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,159
Look behind you.

608
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,636
"Star light, star bright,"

609
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,391
"wish me luck, wish me light,
make my wish come true tonight."

610
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,069
Did you make a wish?

611
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,755
What did you wish?

612
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,791
Nothing.

613
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,709
Afraid it won't come true
if you tell?

614
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,631
I'm sorry that I've been
so nasty to you.

615
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,116
I didn't mean it.

616
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:28,272
It's just things happen,
and you just don't stay the same.

617
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,198
I will make it up to you.
I'll stick by you.

618
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,358
I do love you, George.

619
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:46,356
- We ought to get back. It's dark.
- That old man'll think we drowned!

620
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,112
Let's drift for a while. I'm not
afraid of the dark. It's so nice.

621
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,953
I'll tell you what I wished.

622
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,118
I wished that you loved me again.

623
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,629
You'll see, we'll make a go of it
if we give ourselves the chance.

624
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,153
We'll go where nobody knows us.
We'll get jobs, maybe together.

625
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,480
We'll do things together and go out
together, like any married couple.

626
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:35,511
After a while, you'll settle down
and be content with what you've got,

627
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,757
instead of working yourself up
over things.

628
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,396
It's the little things in life
that count.

629
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,673
We'll have to scrimp and save,
but we'll have each other.

630
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,634
- I'm not afraid of being poor.
- Stop it, Al!

631
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,032
- Why? What's the matter?
- Just stop it!

632
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,919
George?

633
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,279
What did you think of
when you saw the star?

634
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,399
You wished that you weren't here
with me, didn't you?

635
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,991
You wished I was where
you'd never have to see me again.

636
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,676
Maybe you wished that I was dead.
Do you wish that I was dead?

637
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,634
No, I didn't! Just leave me alone.

638
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:43,350
Poor George. I know it isn't easy
for you. I shouldn't have said that.

639
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,628
Stay where you are.

640
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,516
Who's there?

641
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,914
I'm trying to find the road.

642
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,512
I got lost.
You know where the road is?

643
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,190
It's down the trail
about a quarter of a mile.

644
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,110
Quiet, boy, quiet. Now stay there.

645
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,792
- Good morning, Mr Marlowe.
- Good morning, Mack.

646
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,116
It's for you. The coroner.

647
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,476
Yes, Doctor?

648
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,593
oh? Just wait a minute, will you?
Bob, get these facts.

649
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,592
All right now.

650
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,273
Yes. Young couple drowned.

651
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,956
Give me all the facts.

652
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,319
- Is Miss Vickers around?
- No, she's playing tennis.

653
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,114
Everybody's gone somewhere.

654
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,958
Thank you.

655
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,192
Mr Eastman?

656
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,153
- Do you feel well?
- Yeah, fine.

657
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,036
Hello, George. It's been centuries!

658
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,915
- She said you were playing tennis.
- I was watching them.

659
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:49,478
I haven't eaten anything since you've
been away. Well, hardly anything.

660
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,433
Don't go away again, George.

661
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,511
Here, come and sit with me.
How is your mother?

662
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,274
She's much better. It wasn't
as serious as they thought.

663
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,596
I'm glad of that.

664
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,875
You look very tired.

665
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:16,199
I didn't get much sleep. I was even
a little airsick on the plane.

666
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,512
Poor George.

667
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:26,597
Anyway, I've got good news.
Mother and Dad are beginning to melt.

668
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,792
You're winning them over
with your boyish charm.

669
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,152
They'll let us announce it when l
come home from school at Christmas.

670
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:39,514
- At Christmas? Let's run away.
- Run away?

671
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,837
- Right now.
- But we don't have to.

672
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,749
Not the way things are going.
Mother will want a big wedding.

673
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,910
I've always dreamed of having one as
long as I can remember. All girls do.

674
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,915
Now don't start getting moody again!

675
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:02,671
Come on, you change
and I'll meet you on the terrace.

676
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:13,550
- Any identification on the girl?
- Yeah, this employment card.

677
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,228
From the Eastman lndustries.

678
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,034
Alice Tripp or something.

679
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,273
The man gave his name
as Gilbert Edwards?

680
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,754
Yeah.

681
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,635
You can drag that lake,
you won't find him.

682
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,789
- How do you figure that, Bear Bait?
- I figure he left here in an auto.

683
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,276
When I went up to my cabin
around suppertime,

684
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,597
there was a Coupé
parked in the woods up there.

685
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,030
About nine o'clock,

686
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,755
somebody started up that auto
and drove off awfully fast.

687
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,076
- Hi.
- Hello.

688
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:04,389
George, where you been? Got another
woman stashed around someplace?

689
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,991
- You've been gone so long.
- Can't we be alone somewhere?

690
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,956
- We could take the speedboat.
- Yeah.

691
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:20,915
So they wanna be alone. We can't
have that. Come on, Lazy Bones!

692
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,954
Go!

693
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,594
How about some company?
Come on, everybody!

694
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,510
- There's no room for you!
- We'll fix that.

695
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,515
District Attorney Frank Marlowe's
officers investigate further.

696
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,678
An hour ago,
the coroner informed the press

697
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,838
that although the girl's death
was caused by drowning,

698
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,476
bruises would indicate
that a struggle took place.

699
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,035
The District Attorney has evidence

700
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,198
that the girl's male companion
may still be alive.

701
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,949
Three Boy Scouts have reported
that a young man, visibly upset...

702
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,476
You look tired, George.

703
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,354
- That's what I told him.
- Take a rest.

704
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,111
I think maybe that's a good idea.
Excuse me, won't you?

705
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:43,950
- Any news on the drowning?
- The papers see it as a murder.

706
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,676
- He's alive and he's drowned her.
- You read too many mysteries.

707
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,189
She was probably a chatterbox,

708
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,188
and he picked her up
and threw her overboard!

709
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,630
- I've been looking for you, sir.
- What is it?

710
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,595
Mr Vickers would like to see you
alone. He's in the living room, sir.

711
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,796
Sit down, will you?

712
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,118
I thought that you and I might
have a chat before dinner.

713
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,278
- Care for a drink?
- Please.

714
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:33,352
I'm gonna make it a double. I'm gonna
be a little bit personal, George.

715
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,518
It's about you and Angela and
this talk about your getting married.

716
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,278
I don't know whether
I'm for you or against you.

717
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:50,077
- I don't know you well enough.
- I know how you feel, Mr Vickers.

718
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,990
Who am I to think of marrying Angela?
Angela has everything.

719
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:00,149
Talk of marriage aside, we know
almost nothing about your background.

720
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:06,993
There's not much to know. What there
is, I've wanted to tell you myself.

721
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,436
My family is...
We were very poor people.

722
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,869
My family devoted their lives
to a kind of religious work.

723
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:26,757
Conducting sidewalk services,
street singing.

724
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,875
I was part of all that,

725
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,790
until the law came along and said
I ought to go to school.

726
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,315
I only went to school
till I was 1 3 years old.

727
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,877
We didn't ever have any money
for anything, so I left home.

728
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,278
I was gonna do something about it.
I took any job.

729
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,519
Busboy, elevator operator, caddie.

730
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,678
I had no training, no education.

731
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,279
Then I came here,
went to work for my uncle.

732
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,628
That's my background, Mr Vickers.

733
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:19,197
There's nothing very much
to recommend any approval.

734
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,037
But I love Angela more than
anything in the world.

735
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,198
I'd do anything to make her happy.

736
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:34,235
Even if it's right that
I shouldn't see her any more.

737
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,038
Easy, boy.

738
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:41,118
Forthrightness is a prime virtue.

739
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,958
I admire your frankness.

740
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:50,950
I should apologise for eavesdropping,
but I'm glad I listened.

741
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,552
Does that answer all your questions?

742
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,673
All I ask is that you two
don't do anything hasty.

743
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,673
- Let's get out.
- A drive.

744
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,192
- I just wanna be alone with you.
- Let's go.

745
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,993
I can't believe that this horrible
thing could happen to Alice.

746
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,638
- She was such a sweet, quiet girl.
- Ever meet any of her boyfriends?

747
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,516
There was a young man, but he hasn't
been around in a few weeks.

748
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,790
And who was he?

749
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:50,155
It's a small town. Any scandal would
hurt my business something awful.

750
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,478
There will be a scandal
if you don't cooperate.

751
01:23:54,680 --> 01:24:01,199
I never met him, mind you,
but the girls said he was an Eastman.

752
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,439
But it couldn't be...
Not one of the Eastmans!

753
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,638
Get me the District Attorney's office
in Warsaw.

754
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,278
Here we go!

755
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,040
Look, he's gaining.

756
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,554
Safe! Safe and sound!

757
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:07,676
Calling car 41.
Man believed in your vicinity...

758
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:12,237
- The third time this summer.
- I can't understand it!

759
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:17,230
Height 5'10", hair dark,
complexion fair, build light.

760
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,353
- What's your name?
- George Eastman.

761
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:39,270
I'd hate to some day be picking up
the pieces of a pretty girl like you.

762
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,234
- Take it easy, will you?
- Anything you say.

763
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,753
I just love that officer.
He's so bloodcurdling.

764
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,073
And he writes such a nice hand.

765
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,876
Darling, what is it?

766
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,630
I'm tired, very tired.

767
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,593
Yes, you must be.

768
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:26,589
Darling, let's never leave this
place. Let's just stay here alone.

769
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,755
Don't let father upset you.
I'm the one who counts.

770
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,434
You're the only one.

771
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,076
The only one.

772
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,278
People are gonna say things, I know.

773
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,871
Things about me. About me, I know.

774
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,518
- It's gonna make you stop loving me.
- Don't talk like that!

775
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,708
- I was asleep.
- You were dreaming.

776
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:29,994
You were talking.
You said, "Not my fault."

777
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,476
Then you said something
I couldn't make out.

778
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:39,276
Then you said,
"Angela, don't hate me."

779
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:47,349
That was a bad dream, a false dream,
because I'll always love you.

780
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,391
We'd better go now. Mother's liable
to send out a posse for us.

781
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,758
You go in. I'll be along in a minute.

782
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:47,518
Every time you leave me for a minute,
it's like goodbye.

783
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,755
I like to believe it means
you can't live without me.

784
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,313
Is your name George Eastman?

785
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,434
Yes.

786
01:30:55,160 --> 01:31:00,314
- You're under arrest.
- Why? What for?

787
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:07,312
Start walking back down the road and
you'll find out. Go on, get going.

788
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,592
And no monkey business, either.

789
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,556
That's him all right.

790
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,193
Mr Marlowe, here's your baby.

791
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:29,797
You're George Eastman? I suppose
you know what you're charged with?

792
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,672
No.

793
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,634
You don't know anything
about the murder of Alice Tripp?

794
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,559
- I'm not guilty.
- We've evidence.

795
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,276
- You're not going to deny it?
- Yes, I deny it.

796
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,915
Let's take you to the Vickers' and
see what your friends say about you.

797
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:55,193
Please don't take me back there!
I'll tell you all I can.

798
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,119
Don't take me back there.

799
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:05,437
I didn't intend to. I just wanted
to see what you'd have to say.

800
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,876
Take him to Warsaw, boys,
and lock him up.

801
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,308
We'll go to the Vickers' and
see what they have to say.

802
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:28,752
Say he's a relative,
came to the house once. Got that?

803
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,713
And have Hollister take his name off.

804
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,479
You had no inkling of his relations
with that girl?

805
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,794
No.

806
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,596
None of you knew
of this boy's double life?

807
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,074
No.

808
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:02,713
Mr Marlowe, if you've no further
questions for my daughter and me...

809
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:05,878
-...will you excuse us?
- of course.

810
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:13,470
Mr Vickers, I have no desire
to harass an innocent person.

811
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:18,117
I'd like to keep your daughter free
of scandal, but if the papers...

812
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:22,279
I'll keep her out of the papers.
You keep her out of the trial.

813
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,109
That may not be possible.
The defence would have to agree.

814
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,357
The defence will agree to it.
I'll see to that.

815
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,636
I'll engage the boy's lawyers.

816
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,992
If it appears he's innocent,
I'll spend $1 00,000 to defend him.

817
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,509
And if he's guilty?

818
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:44,669
I won't spend a cent to save him
from the electric chair.

819
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,358
Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Lulu.

820
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,956
The boy's tired.
I think that's enough for today.

821
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,116
I guess you're right.

822
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:22,077
Mr Bellows, has there been
any word from...?

823
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,912
From Miss Vickers?

824
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,553
No, George.

825
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,718
When Mr Eastman engaged us
to defend you,

826
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,199
we made an agreement not to drag
Miss Vickers into the case.

827
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,875
- of course.
- It's in your interest, too.

828
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:42,038
Her appearance on the stand
would be irrelevant.

829
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:46,677
I feel it might be damaging
for you, too. We'll be back.

830
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,069
"After I got her on the lake,
I couldn't go through with it."

831
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,714
"Then the boat turned over."

832
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,751
You know, Art, he sold me.
I believe his story.

833
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,959
No more newspapers, Lulu.
Remember, I told you.

834
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:15,474
The people of this state charge
that murder in the first degree

835
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:19,639
has been committed by the prisoner
at the bar, George Eastman.

836
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,673
They charge that George Eastman

837
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,954
wilfully, and with malice
and cruelty and deception,

838
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,798
murdered,

839
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,835
then sought to conceal from justice
the body of Alice Tripp.

840
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,230
It will be for you,
ladies and gentlemen,

841
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,878
to decide what shall be done
with this man,

842
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,675
who has flouted every moral law,
broken every commandment...

843
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:56,677
...who has crowned his infamy
with murder.

844
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,959
- What were Alice's feelings for him?
- Everybody knew she was in love.

845
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,720
What was this rule exactly?

846
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,516
It was to keep the foreman and staff
from fooling around with the girls.

847
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,395
one night last August,
I called Alice to the telephone.

848
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,390
It was him calling.

849
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,479
Doctor, you never saw
this young man?

850
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:28,797
No, but after she left my office,

851
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,878
she sat talking
with a man in a Coupé.

852
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,036
- objection!
- Sustained.

853
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,913
Along about nine o'clock,
he stumbled into my camp.

854
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,270
He was wet and looked scared.

855
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:47,793
This man was at the bus station
with this girl.

856
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,956
They were quarrelling.

857
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,391
She said she wouldn't leave
unless he promised.

858
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,594
Had violence been done to Miss
Tripp prior to her death by drowning?

859
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,476
She'd been struck by an instrument
with sufficient force to stun her.

860
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,389
I told him there wasn't
nobody else on the lake.

861
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,194
Then he signed Gilbert Edwards.

862
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,471
Having signed a false name,
he then proceeded to make sure

863
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,752
what took place would be
observed by no one?

864
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,997
No one except the person
who'd be unable to testify,

865
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,555
the girl he drowned?

866
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,594
- The prosecution must not...
- I withdraw the question.

867
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,950
The people rest.

868
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:38,037
This boy is on trial
for the act of murder,

869
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,549
not for the thought of murder.

870
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,832
Between the idea and deed
there's a difference.

871
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:49,876
If you find this boy guilty in desire
but not guilty in deed...

872
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:55,074
...then he must walk out of this
courtroom as free as you or l.

873
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:02,868
However, since the prosecutor lacked
evidence, he's given you prejudice.

874
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,390
Lacking facts,
he's given you fantasy.

875
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,795
of all the witnesses before you,

876
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,958
not one actually saw what happened.

877
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:19,796
I will now call to the stand
an eyewitness, the only eyewitness.

878
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,949
The only one who knows the truth,
the whole truth.

879
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,678
George Eastman,
please take the stand.

880
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,394
When we got to the lake, I suggested
we go rowing before it got dark.

881
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:44,196
Tell me, why did you give
a false name to the boat keeper?

882
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:48,632
We were going to stay at the lodge,
and we weren't married,

883
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,628
so I thought it better
not to give our real names.

884
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:58,517
Why did you engage the boat
to row the girl out onto the lake?

885
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,469
In the back of my mind
was the thought of drowning her.

886
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,436
But I didn't want to think
such things!

887
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,478
I couldn't help myself, I couldn't!

888
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,673
What happened after you rowed out?

889
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,634
I knew that I couldn't
go through with it.

890
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:37,834
- Then you had a change of heart.
- I object. He's leading the witness.

891
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,476
objection sustained. Counsel will
refrain from leading the witness.

892
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,636
Yes, your honour.

893
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,239
What happened then?

894
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:56,392
That was when we decided
we ought to get back to the lodge.

895
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:00,275
She started talking
about getting married

896
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,109
and what our life together
would be like.

897
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,312
What was your reaction
to her talking that way?

898
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,593
She just looked at me.
She knew it was hopeless.

899
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,949
She accused me of wishing her dead.

900
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,276
Did you wish she were dead?

901
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:23,109
No, I didn't!
I wasn't thinking of that any more!

902
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,278
What were you thinking of
at that moment?

903
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,878
I was thinking of somebody else.

904
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,512
Another girl.

905
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:41,639
You were thinking that this other
girl and her world were lost forever.

906
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,958
What did you say
to Alice's accusation?

907
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:55,709
I told her it wasn't true,
I didn't want her to die.

908
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,673
Wasn't she alarmed or frightened?

909
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:04,513
- She even said, "Poor George!"
- Go on.

910
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:09,791
Then she started toward me
from the back of the boat.

911
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,390
I told her to stay where she was,
but she didn't.

912
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,229
She kept coming toward me,
then she started to fall.

913
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,512
I started to get up.
Then everything turned over.

914
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,951
In a second, we were in the water.
I was stunned.

915
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,993
Something must have
hit me as I fell in.

916
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,670
It all happened so fast,
I didn't know what I was doing.

917
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,271
George, was Alice conscious
when she fell into the water?

918
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,916
Yes, I heard her scream
but couldn't see her,

919
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,190
'cause she was on the other side.

920
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,960
So I swam around to the other side.

921
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,269
She was... When I got there,
she'd gone down.

922
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,476
I never saw her again.

923
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:02,435
Do you solemnly swear
that you did not strike her?

924
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,073
I swear it!

925
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,874
- That you did not push her in?
- I did not!

926
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,390
That it was an accident
undesired by you?

927
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:15,230
I do. I do. I do.

928
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,636
That's all, your honour.

929
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:35,075
That night when you left the party
at the house at Bride's Lake

930
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,590
to meet Alice Tripp
in the bus station...

931
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,557
...do you remember leaving
anything behind you?

932
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:46,548
No, I don't. I don't remember
leaving anything.

933
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:51,788
I'm referring to your heart!
Did you leave that behind you?

934
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,313
Did you, Eastman? out there
on that terrace in the moonlight?

935
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,715
You left behind the girl you loved,

936
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,198
and with her your hopes,
your ambitions, your dreams.

937
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,470
Didn't you, Eastman?

938
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:10,639
You left behind everything you
wanted, including the girl you loved.

939
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,276
But you planned to return to it,
didn't you?

940
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,436
Answer me!

941
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,558
Yes.

942
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:27,469
When you told them all that night
you were going to visit your mother,

943
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,478
you were lying, weren't you?

944
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:35,151
When you gave the boat keeper
a false name, you were lying again?

945
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,634
Yes.

946
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,515
When you drove up to Loon Lake,
what reason did you give Alice Tripp

947
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:43,553
for parking so far away
from the lodge?

948
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,435
- We were out of gas.
- Weren't you lying again?

949
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:49,312
- Yes.
- Lies!

950
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,637
Every move you made
was built on lies.

951
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,914
Yet now you're facing death, you
can't tell anything but the truth!

952
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,475
All the same, it's true!

953
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,832
I didn't kill her.

954
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:10,478
So you persist in lying
about that, too. We'll see.

955
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,511
Step down into the boat

956
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:23,669
and show the jury what happened
when the boat overturned.

957
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,916
Take the same position you had
at the time of the drowning.

958
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:38,074
When the girl rose in the boat
to come towards you,

959
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,033
did she stumble about there?

960
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,956
- Speak up.
- Yes.

961
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,832
And then?

962
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,759
She fell sideways into the water.

963
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,635
- Then what?
- The boat turned over on top of us.

964
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,152
- What happened then?
- I couldn't see very clearly.

965
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:03,319
There was a thud,
as if the edge of the boat hit her.

966
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,794
Very likely!

967
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,438
After this accidental blow, how far
apart were you when you came up?

968
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,953
I don't know exactly.

969
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:17,630
You couldn't have been
more than a yard apart!

970
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,637
It was further.

971
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,469
From there to the jury box
or halfway or what?

972
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,796
From here to the jury box.

973
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,235
Not really. When you and she
came up, you're nearly 20 feet apart!

974
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:36,319
- Why couldn't you swim toward her?
- I don't know.

975
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,590
Step over here.

976
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:52,639
Was the boat as far as from here
to the bailiff?

977
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,114
I don't know.

978
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:58,154
You're telling me
you couldn't swim to this weak girl

979
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:01,432
and buoy her up
till you could reach this boat?

980
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,155
You're lying! She was drowning,
and you just let her drown!

981
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:11,390
She was defenceless, you picked up
this oar and crashed it on her head!

982
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:19,237
You pushed that poor girl into
the lake. You watched her drown.

983
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,073
- lsn't that the truth?
- No.

984
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,631
That's all, your honour.

985
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,834
By the premature adoption
of an extreme belief and creed,

986
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,113
it is well to understand this in
looking to the duties of adult life,

987
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,276
in particular, the married state,

988
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:56,555
when you will emerge into a world of
grown-up problems for the first time.

989
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:00,514
Then he or she will view
the enthusiasms of youth...

990
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:08,879
...problems which are the frequent
products of a sheltered immaturity.

991
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:15,030
It is when the hastily adopted
beliefs of youth are insufficient...

992
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:37,469
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, your honour.

993
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,876
The defendant will rise.

994
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,273
The clerk will read the verdict.

995
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,833
We find the defendant,
George Eastman,

996
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:15,191
guilty of murder in the first degree.

997
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,276
order in the court!

998
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,478
- Hello, Mrs Eastman.
- Mama.

999
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:01,436
- My boy.
- Did you see the governor?

1000
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:06,031
It's no use.
The governor couldn't be moved.

1001
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:14,350
Your mother's done everything
a mother could do. That I know.

1002
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:18,030
Death is a little thing.
You mustn't be afraid of it.

1003
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,471
You must fear now
only for your immortal soul.

1004
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:27,630
If that sin is on your soul, my son,
you must make your peace with God.

1005
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,389
I don't believe
I'm guilty of all this.

1006
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:36,389
They don't know. I wish I knew!

1007
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,593
If you are guilty, then I am guilty.
I must share your guilt.

1008
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,394
Mama, don't blame yourself.

1009
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:50,870
They say only God and ourselves
know what our sins and sorrows are.

1010
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:54,311
Perhaps in this case, only God knows.

1011
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:00,473
George, perhaps you've hidden
the full truth even from yourself.

1012
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:04,798
I don't wanna hide anything.
I wanna know.

1013
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,437
There's one thing you've never told
anyone, even yourself.

1014
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:15,838
There's one point in your story that
holds the answer you're looking for.

1015
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,678
Yes...

1016
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:24,479
When you were on the lake with that
poor girl, and the boat capsized...

1017
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,555
...and there was a moment
when you might have saved her.

1018
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,035
I wanted to save her.

1019
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,590
But I just couldn't.

1020
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:42,038
Whom were you thinking of?

1021
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:46,199
Whom were you thinking of
just at that moment?

1022
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:54,033
Were you thinking of Alice?
Were you thinking of the other girl?

1023
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:07,519
Then...in your heart was murder,
George.

1024
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,154
God bless you, my boy.
God forgive me if I've failed you.

1025
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,273
I came to see you.

1026
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:11,478
I've thought lots about you, George.

1027
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,956
All the time.

1028
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:26,273
I went away to school...to learn.

1029
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,673
I don't think I learned very much.

1030
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:46,832
I love you, George.
I wanted you to know that.

1031
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,478
I guess there's nothing more to say.

1032
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:21,719
I know something now
that I didn't know before.

1033
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,233
I am guilty of a lot of things,
most of what they say of me.

1034
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:35,074
All the same,
I'll go on loving you...

1035
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,031
...for as long as I live.

1036
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:45,031
Love me for the time I have left,
then forget me.

1037
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:08,918
Goodbye, George.

1038
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:28,999
It seems like we always spend the
best part of our time saying goodbye.

1039
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,673
"ln my Father's house
of many mansions,"

1040
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,838
"l go to prepare a place for you."

1041
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:59,319
"And I will receive you unto myself
that where I am ye may be also."

1042
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,238
You'll have to go now.

1043
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:07,629
"l am the resurrection and the life.
He who believeth in me..."

1044
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,434
Come on, son.

1045
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:16,878
"And whosoever liveth and
believeth in me...shall never die."

1046
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,911
So long, kid.

1047
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,478
You're going to a better world
than this.

1048
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,435
Goodbye, George. I'll be seein' you.
