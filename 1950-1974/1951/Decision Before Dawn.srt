1
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,591
<i> Of all the questions</i>
<i>left unanswered by the last war</i>-

2
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:14,861
<i>and probably any war</i>-
<i>one comes back constantly to my mind</i>-

3
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:19,030
<i>- Why does a spy risk his life</i>-
<i>for what possible reasons?</i>

4
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:23,439
<i>If the spy wins, he's ignored.</i>
<i>If he loses, he's shot.</i>

5
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:39,815
<i>But a man stays alive as long as</i>
<i>he's remembered and is killed</i>
<i>only by forgetfulness.</i>

6
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,885
<i>Let the names of men like this</i>
<i>remain unknown...</i>

7
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:47,126
<i>but let the memories of some of them</i>
<i>serve as keys to the meanings of treason.</i>

8
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:14,359
<i>On the 8th of December, 1944,</i>
<i>six months after a piece of enemy shrapnel...</i>

9
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:19,330
<i>cut short my career with the Second Assault</i>
<i>and Signal Company on Omaha Beach...</i>

10
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,425
<i>I was reassigned by headquarters,</i>
<i>Com. "Z", E. T. O...</i>

11
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:27,201
<i>and ordered to report to a new outfit</i>-
<i>G2, S.S.S., Seventh Army.</i>

12
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,367
<i>That's what it was called.</i>

13
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:34,174
<i>There'd been no snow</i>
<i>and a lot of Krauts when I left France.</i>

14
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:40,208
<i>And now the Krauts were backed up against</i>
<i>the Rhine, and the snow was everywhere.</i>

15
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:45,053
<i>Otherwise, the war hadn't changed much</i>-
<i>crowded in the rear areas...</i>

16
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,493
<i>and lonely as you got nearer</i>
<i>and nearer the front...</i>

17
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,328
<i>with nothing but a map to tell you</i>
<i>where the enemy was supposed to be.</i>

18
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,800
<i>But you soon discovered</i>
<i>if your map was accurate enough.</i>

19
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,674
- Hey, what's that?
- It's a German half-track. That's what it is.

20
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,404
I don't get it. That wasn't here
when I came by this morning.

21
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,879
- Well, let's turn around here
and find out where we are.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,552
- Stop right here.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,890
I'm sorry, sir.
I keep tellin' 'em back at headquarters...

24
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,589
I got no sense of direction,
but they just won't listen to me.

25
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,827
A soldier's not much good if he can't
find his way back to his own outfit.

26
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,860
- It's like not bein' able to find your way home.
- My home? My home's in Boise.

27
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,170
For cryin' out-
We've come 20 miles out of the way.

28
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,837
Now we'll probably have to fight
our way through a whole Kraut-

29
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,790
Come on. Get outta there!
Give it up, you rats.

30
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,191
Come on! Move it on!
Keep your hands up.

31
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,422
<i>- Over this way. Move!</i>
<i>- Come on. Get the lead out.</i>

32
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,931
<i>Move over there.</i>
<i>That's close enough. Right there.</i>

33
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,230
You frisk 'em.
I'll keep 'em covered.

34
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,670
Hey, you. I said, keep your hands up.
That's what I meant. Come on!

35
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,079
Stand still.

36
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,017
- Watch those hands, soldier.
- He was hit by shrapnel, sir.

37
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,055
- You're in the Luftwaffe.
What are you doin' around here?
- I'm with a flak group.

38
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,323
- We're attached to an infantry division.
<i>- Yeah? Which one?</i>

39
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,524
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't tell you anything
that isn't in my <i>Soldbuch.</i>

40
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,591
- Want me to refresh his memory, Lieutenant?
- Ah, leave him alone.

41
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,660
<i>Where's your C. P?</i>

42
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,605
- I don't know. We got lost.
- They're not the only ones.

43
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,235
"Richter, Paul. <i>Unteroffizier."</i>

44
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,505
He's weak, sir.
We haven't eaten for three days.

45
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,451
Not half as weak as he's gonna be
if you don't keep those hands up.

46
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,687
- Here. You look like you
could use a shot yourself.
- No, thank you.

47
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,891
All right. Climb aboard.

48
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,579
All right. Out, soldiers.

49
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,245
<i>- Where'd you pick 'em up, Lieutenant?</i>
- About five miles from here.

50
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,551
Over here, you two.

51
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,525
Hey, I'm supposed to report to a town
called Marmoutier. You know where that is?

52
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,062
Stay on this road till you get to
a town called Saverne.

53
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,658
- Before you get into town,
take the first fork left. You can't miss it.
- Okay. Thanks.

54
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,827
Hey, here's their <i>Soldbuchs.</i>

55
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,497
- Hey, you want the pistol, Lieutenant?
- Yeah. Gimme that.

56
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,836
- Pistol.
- In there, you two.

57
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,967
<i>Come on.</i>

58
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,207
I want to thank you, sir,
for treating us with kindness.

59
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,514
Come on, Kraut-heads. Get movin'.
You're holdin' up the war.

60
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,521
<i> Well, we finally</i>
<i>made it. Strange as it seemed to me then...</i>

61
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:16,899
<i>- this was the headquarters</i>
<i>to which I was assigned.</i>

62
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,461
Just a moment, sir.
Sister Teresa's coming.

63
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,771
<i>- Bonjour, Monsieur Jean.</i>
- How was the hunting this morning?

64
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,437
No good, Sister Beatrice.
There wasn't a chicken on the road.

65
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,819
- This is it, sir. Sorry about getting lost.
- Oh, forget it.

66
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,258
- I just hope this is the right place.
- Through here, sir.

67
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,230
The adjutant's office is right in the courtyard.
I'll get the bags to your room.

68
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,009
Hey, bud, how do I get
to the adjutant?

69
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:04,516
Around the corner to your left, sir.
Hey, Monique, will you show
the lieutenant the way?

70
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,678
- You wish to see <i>le capitaine?</i>
- Yeah, I guess so.

71
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,846
This way, please.

72
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,666
- The children are from the orphanage here.
- Oh. Of course.

73
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,976
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

74
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:37,846
- Monsieur Watkins, the officer
wants to see <i>Capitaine</i> Siebert.
- What can I do for you?

75
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,047
- This the headquarters of G2, S.S. S?
- That's right.

76
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,557
I've got orders
to report here.

77
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,650
Oh. You're the new
communications officer.

78
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,094
Colonel Devlin will sure be glad to see you.
If you'll follow me, please.

79
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,663
Mm! Could I see
your A.G.O. Card?

80
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,897
Sorry.
Security regulations.

81
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,030
Thanks.

82
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,244
- Morning, Sister Genevieve.
How are you today?

83
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,219
The sisters certainly take good care of us.
They've adopted us just like their orphans.

84
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,313
Yeah. It's quite a place.

85
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,723
We had a hard time finding one
until Captain Siebert located this.

86
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:25,321
We don't like to be too close to the army.
Sometimes they don't understand our procedure.

87
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,525
I can see their point.

88
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,833
After five years, they're fixing the place
up again. Our guys are tryin' to help.

89
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,964
- Up here?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,041
- Watkins, sir.
<i>- What is it, Watkins?</i>

91
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,048
- This is our new communications officer.
Here's his orders, sir.
- It. Rennick, reporting for duty.

92
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,711
Glad you finally got here. Sit down.
I'll be with you in a minute. Where was I?

93
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,846
- "That the intelligence penetration"-
- Oh, yes.

94
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,414
That the intelligence penetration
of Germany by French or Alsatian agents...

95
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:58,122
or by any non-German personnel is
practically an impossibility. Okay, Simonson?

96
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,859
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Now for the rough part.

97
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:06,132
I ask that you reconsider our request
with the use of German prisoners
of war in our work.

98
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,732
We've already located many promising
candidates in several P.W. Camps.

99
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,073
How about the men down
at the Sarrebourg cage?

100
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,113
- They said they'd hold 'em
another day or two, sir.
- All right.

101
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,811
These men, I believe, if properly trained
and used, can help save American lives.

102
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:24,345
We intend to take only
volunteers, and in that case-

103
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,157
Pinpoint Forward.
Captain Siebert speaking.

104
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,664
Yes, he's here. Just a minute.
G2 Seventh Army, sir.

105
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,260
Devlin speaking. Yes, sir.

106
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,464
Then we can go ahead
as discussed?

107
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,441
Well, I'm sure you won't regret it.
Thank you, sir. Bye.

108
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,445
Forget the memo. The old boy came through.
Army says, try it out.

109
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,005
- That's very gracious of them.
- This calls for a drink,
don't you think, Colonel?

110
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,143
- Right. Break out the Quetch, Harold.
- Aye, aye, sir.

111
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,347
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to introduce you.

112
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,118
- This is Gevers, Recruiting.
- Hi.

113
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,751
<i>- Major Richards, our exec.</i>
- Welcome to our club.

114
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,818
<i>- Vincent, Documents.</i>
- Hello, Lieutenant.

115
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:08,333
Siebert-Where is he?
Oh. Siebert, Security.

116
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,596
- Glad to meet you, Lieutenant.
- Sergeant Simonson...

117
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,639
<i>- best red tape specialist,</i>
<i>both sides of the Atlantic.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

118
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,437
- This is Lieutenant, uh-
What was your name again?
- Rennick.

119
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,809
That's right. Lieutenant Rennick.
Our new communications officer.

120
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,316
Richards, we'll want transportation
first thing in the morning for Sarrebourg.

121
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,318
Well, we're finally gonna pay a visit
to your German friends, Pete.

122
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,480
Pardon me, but if I may,
I'd like to talk with you about my duties.

123
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,649
Well, it can wait
till morning, can't it?

124
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,217
How about coming to Sarrebourg?
It'll give you an idea of what it's all about.

125
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:41,096
<i>- Votre santé, messieurs</i>-
or should I say, prost.
<i>- Prost!</i>

126
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:57,415
No, sir. Not me. When a man gets his life
handed back to him like I just did...

127
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,747
he'd be a fool
to put it up for sale again.

128
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,118
- I'll do any kind of work you want, but-
<i>- Next man.</i>

129
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,924
I have never been
interested in politics.

130
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:13,158
They forced me to join the party.
It was the only way I could get a promotion.

131
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,498
<i>- All right. Next man.</i>

132
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,334
Sergeant Rudolph Barth reporting, sir.

133
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,465
<i>At ease, Sergeant. Sit down.</i>

134
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,476
- You smoke?
- Yes, sir. I do.

135
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,774
Dick?

136
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,783
- Thank you.
- Uh, not now.

137
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,322
What unit were you with
when captured?

138
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,886
Twenty-fourth Infantry-
or what was left of it.

139
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:50,698
- Did you desert?
- No, sir. I was caught by one
of your patrols while, uh-

140
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,671
while visiting the wife
of an Alsatian farmer.

141
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,730
She was a very lonely woman, sir.

142
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,106
How long have you been
in the Wehrmacht, Barth?

143
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,079
- Since '41, unfortunately.
- And before that?

144
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,676
I worked in a Panzer factory in Hamburg,
and before that I was with the circus.

145
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:11,553
Yes, sir. I took care of two tigers
and a lion- a lioness to be exact.

146
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,890
- I lost my job when the old woman died.
- Have you ever been in jail?

147
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,864
- Yes sir, in '36 in Düsseldorf
and in '42 in Norway.
- And what were the charges?

148
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,528
In civilian life, theft,
and in the army-

149
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,697
how shall I say-
uh, insubordination.

150
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,798
I hope it won't
count against me.

151
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,969
<i>- And what are your political convictions?</i>
- My political convictions?

152
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,071
- Never been able to afford any.
- Then why do you want to work for us?

153
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,083
Because you are winning the war.
Isn't that a good enough reason?

154
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,312
Well, good or bad,
I suppose it's a valid one.

155
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,982
In other words, you don't mind the general
disaster, as long as you come out ahead.

156
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,150
If you want to put it that way.

157
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,957
I guess a few years ago, for the same reason,
you were shouting, <i>"Sieg heil."</i>

158
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,295
No. Not that.
That was one swindle I never fell for.

159
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,598
They were too much like my cats
to suit me- dangerous to turn your back on.

160
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,401
Would you work for us
even if it meant risking your life?

161
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,998
I didn't expect the job
to be safe or pleasant.

162
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,910
Why should you take Germans for safe work
when your own people are in danger?

163
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,813
- All right, Sergeant. We'll think about it.
<i>- Next.</i>

164
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,682
<i>This next guy's supposed to be</i>
<i>an experienced radioman.</i>

165
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:21,454
- Pardon me. May I ask <i>you</i>
a question now, sir?
- What is it?

166
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,325
How much do you pay?

167
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,462
Thanks a lot, Sergeant. Don't forget to keep
our guys separated from the others.

168
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,166
I know what you mean, sir.
I'll take care of it. This way, sir.

169
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,812
- Look.
- I wonder what he's doing here.

170
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,682
Don't you know? They look for
volunteers who will work for them.

171
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,849
- Have they found any?
- Yes. But there are men here
who will remember their names.

172
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,052
And someday, when we've won,
they'll be taken care of.

173
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:59,564
"When we've won"? You still believe in that?

174
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,895
Here they come-
the volunteers.

175
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,904
Look at them. They are ready to do
anything just to save their own hides.

176
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,538
- Like most of us.
- What did you say?

177
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,707
Yes, we are no different
from them.

178
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:22,083
We didn't care what happened to others
as long as they didn't bother any of us.

179
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:26,921
We just closed our eyes and went along
until we found ourselves
forced to fight the wrong enemy.

180
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,155
You sound as if you're all set
to join the Americans yourself.

181
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,823
I don't know.
That takes courage.

182
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:38,063
The trouble with me is I want to stay alive.
Like most of us, I talk but I do nothing.

183
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:58,184
Paul? Paul, are you asleep?

184
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,021
No. What is it?

185
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,119
Did you see their faces
this morning out in the yard?

186
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,633
Yes. For some of them,
nothing is changed- even now.

187
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,030
Richter, the Amis
want you for questioning.

188
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:13,360
Richter, the Amis
want you for questioning.

189
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:16,836
- The Americans want me now?
- Yes. Come with me.

190
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,219
<i>Sergeant Paul Richter...</i>

191
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:44,788
<i>you are facing a court-martial</i>
<i>of the Wehrmacht.</i>

192
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:48,302
You are accused of treason
against your führer and your fatherland.

193
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,531
Have you anything to say
in your defense?

194
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,972
<i>- What are you doing here?</i>
- Eavesdropping, eh?

195
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,101
Get it over with.
Quick!

196
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,196
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>- One of the P. W.'s</i>
<i>fell out of the window.</i>

197
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:19,597
Let's get him inside
before there's more trouble.

198
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:22,364
- Hey, you fellas,
come over with that light.
- All right.

199
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:24,530
- Break it up, guys.
- Come on. There's nothing to look at.

200
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,597
Break it up, I said.
Get back to your bunks.

201
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:29,200
- Which room did the guy fall from?
- Fall? Are you kidding?

202
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,268
He was pushed.

203
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,439
Better keep
your mouth shut, <i>Junge.</i>

204
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:38,613
<i>All right. Let's go.</i>

205
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,315
<i>Well, what about you?</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

206
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:48,958
- Monsieur Rennick. Monsieur Rennick.
- Yeah?

207
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:54,333
Sergeant Watkins asked me to tell you,
there is a German to see you
downstairs. A soldier.

208
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,128
- Morning, Griffin.
- Morning, sir.

209
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:59,605
You wanted to see me?
What's it all about?

210
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:03,906
I remembered you from
the morning I was captured, sir.
I thought maybe you can help me.

211
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:08,609
- The morning you were captured?
- Don't you remember those Krauts
we picked up in Hagenau woods?

212
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:11,811
Oh, yeah.
How's your friend doin'?

213
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:15,550
He was killed, sir, ten days ago.

214
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:19,560
He was killed? By whom?

215
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:23,291
- He was murdered
by some of the other prisoners.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

216
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,560
- He was pushed out of a window, wasn't he?
- Yes.

217
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,296
- Coffee, Dick?
- No, thanks.

218
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,931
- Is that why you came here?
- No, sir.

219
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,339
It is-Well...

220
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:38,971
I want to work for you, and I thought
you might be able to help me.

221
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,914
- You know what you're gettin' into?
- It doesn't matter.

222
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:45,111
Even if it means fighting
against your own people?

223
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:48,122
I believe fighting against them now
is fighting for them.

224
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,093
You sure it isn't the murder of your friend
that's prompting you to do this?

225
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:56,756
No, sir. That was only
the last thing that happened.

226
00:18:56,832 --> 00:18:59,824
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

227
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:03,530
Look, it's none of my business,
but the job you'll have to do here...

228
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:06,972
isn't as clean and simple
as you may think.

229
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,341
I don't feel there's any difference
between one way of fighting or another.

230
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,210
Isn't the important thing to believe in
what you're fighting for?

231
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,306
Well, what do you believe in?
Do you know?

232
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,783
Or does it change
when your crowd's taking a beating?

233
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:22,313
Pete, got a cigarette? Sit down, Corporal.
Don't let me interrupt.

234
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,123
- Thank you, sir.
- Go ahead. What do you believe in?

235
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:30,289
I don't quite know
how to say it...

236
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:33,459
but I believe in a life
in which one is not always afraid...

237
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:37,198
in a life in which people are free
and honest with each other.

238
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:43,211
And I know we won't have this
in Germany... until- until we have lost.

239
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:47,544
<i>That sounds great. What makes you so sure</i>
<i>you'll be able to stick to these convictions?</i>

240
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:52,053
Things will change.
You'll be facing your own people.

241
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,214
It may become hard for you
then to hold on to your beliefs.

242
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,315
No, not any harder
than it has been.

243
00:19:57,392 --> 00:20:00,225
Not any harder than fighting
for something I knew was wrong.

244
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:03,423
You were a medic.
You didn't really fight.

245
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,590
To be there is to fight.

246
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:12,833
There's something in what you say,
Corporal. Griffin. Griffin!

247
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:16,844
- Yes, sir?
- Tell Major Richards I want to
keep this man here a few days.

248
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:20,109
- Yes, sir.
- We'll let you know.

249
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:22,275
This way.

250
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,519
Seems like a decent kid.
What do you think, Pete?

251
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:34,585
Yeah, quite unusual
in this racket.

252
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:38,099
As a matter of fact, he looks like
one of the few Krauts we can trust.

253
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,897
How about you, Rennick?

254
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,304
I'm a signal officer, sir. I'm sorry, I...
really have no opinion about any of them.

255
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:49,036
That didn't seem to be
the case a moment ago.

256
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,807
The way you talked to this kid sounded as
if you had a pretty definite point of view.

257
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:57,477
- What is it?
- Well, if you want to know, sir, I-

258
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,747
I think they're all
a bunch of lice.

259
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:03,814
If I had to make a choice, I'd go along with
this guy from the circus. He's a crook...

260
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:07,293
but at least he doesn't kid himself
about why he's workin' for us.

261
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:09,387
I think you're wrong
about the boy, Rennick.

262
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:12,558
There are all kinds of traitors.
I have no more sympathy with 'em than you.

263
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:16,297
But our personal feelings are unimportant
as long as these men are serving our cause.

264
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:19,772
That's why from now on, when you're
on the job, you'll have only one opinion-

265
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:23,140
and that's the right one
for the job.

266
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:26,510
- Everything set for tonight?
- Yes. 0200 hours. Tiger and Freddy.

267
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:31,314
Be sure and check their briefing
before you take them through.
It's their first time.

268
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:36,790
Oh, and Pete, I want Lieutenant Rennick
to go along. It may do you some good.

269
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:39,326
That's all. See you later.

270
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:47,828
<i>0200 hours. Apiece of no-man's-land...</i>

271
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:53,204
<i>was indicated by Division G2 as a spot</i>
<i>where two of our agents,</i>
<i>known as Tiger and Freddy...</i>

272
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,835
<i>were to be smuggled</i>
<i>through enemy lines.</i>

273
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,778
<i>They were to secure information</i>
<i>on S.S. And elite troops in this sector.</i>

274
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:02,942
<i>It was... a so-called</i>
<i>"tourist mission.</i>

275
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:15,390
- Minefield. Wait here.
- Minefield. Wait.
- Mines.

276
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:18,864
Remember, the most important thing
is exact map coordinates for your report.

277
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:21,902
No report at all is better than one
in which you're not 100% sure.

278
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,905
- That's simple. What I want to know is-
- Just let me do the talkin'.

279
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:27,498
Tiger, what I was tryin'
to say is sometimes, out of ambition...

280
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:29,975
you're apt to exaggerate-
report things you haven't seen.

281
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,411
- Me? I never lie.
- That's exactly what I meant.

282
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,812
You may not lie,
but you certainly exaggerate.

283
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:38,751
- Okay. We can go now. Single file.
- Come on. Single file.

284
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,846
The captain said he'd give us
a short artillery barrage just for cover.

285
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:44,756
It should start
at any moment now.

286
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,496
That's it.
Better get them ready, Lieutenant.

287
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:54,700
- Okay?
- Freddy, you first.

288
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:58,762
Don't forget, your danger
signal's a group of five "D's."
Time of transmission- 2400.

289
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,865
- I want to ask a question.
- What is it?

290
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:03,206
- Who is the captain of the team?
Who is in command?
- Quiet!

291
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:06,839
- You are, Tiger. And you're
responsible for your teammate.
- All right. As long as I know.

292
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:10,373
- Okay. Good luck to both of you.
- Go ahead. I'll follow you.

293
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay. But remember, from now on
I'm giving orders. Let's go.

294
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:21,387
North. Just keep to your left.
We'll stop 'em in just a moment.

295
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:24,193
The German lines are
about 300 yards over there.

296
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:36,038
One, two, three, four.

297
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:41,549
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

298
00:23:41,616 --> 00:23:44,414
- Dede, take over.
- Hey, Lang, here's a new guest for your hotel.

299
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:47,319
Yeah.
I know all about him. Over here.

300
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:53,350
Ready? Exercise.
One, two, three, four. One, two-

301
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:58,999
Monique. Hey, Monique.

302
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:02,230
This is the man we got the file
on this morning. Code name's "Happy."

303
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:06,171
Yes, sir. I'll- I'll put him in
with Tiger and Fritz.

304
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:10,871
- Well, lotsa luck. You're in good hands now.
- Follow me, please.

305
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:26,122
The cot near the window.

306
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:28,594
You make your own bed here.

307
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:32,690
All personal belongings will be turned over
to me, and you will get a receipt for them.

308
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,167
And what about my wallet?
They took it away from me.

309
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:39,332
I had a couple of photographs
of my mother and father. I would
like to keep them if possible.

310
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:44,037
All your personal documents
will be kept in the headquarters' safe
until the war is over.

311
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:47,809
- You have been told
your code name is "Happy"?
- Yes.

312
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:51,340
As you will see by this list of regulations,
under no circumstances...

313
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,183
will you reveal your true name
or identity to anyone.

314
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,348
Remember that.

315
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,989
All right now, Happy.
Ho-o-old it.

316
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:05,225
Good.

317
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,895
<i>- Father's name?</i>
- Friedrich Maurer.

318
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,633
<i>- Profession?</i>
- A doctor. He's a surgeon.

319
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:17,337
- When did you last see him?
- Uh, about a year ago in Berlin.

320
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:20,575
He was in charge
of the hospital there.

321
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:24,550
I thought in America
only criminals were fingerprinted.

322
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:27,588
Come on, boys.
Come on. Come on.

323
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,714
Over here.
Over here.

324
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,885
Come on.
Let's go. Hurry up.

325
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,890
Here is an example
of the Wehrmacht blacklist.

326
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:41,231
It's the greatest single danger
that confronts an agent in the Reich.

327
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:45,568
It carries the names of all suspects.
It's brought up to date
by a weekly supplement...

328
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,132
which carries the number
of the week on its cover.

329
00:25:57,652 --> 00:25:59,916
- Hey, what's the matter, Happy?
- Move it out.

330
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:04,118
Come on. Stay on your feet.
Don't let that chute drag you.

331
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:06,217
<i>No. Pull hard</i>
<i>on the bottom line.</i>

332
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,759
- Rennick! Rennick-
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

333
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:09,224
- Rennick! Rennick-
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

334
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:13,529
- When was our last radio contact with Freddy?
- About four nights ago.

335
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,434
- Did he send his danger signal?
- No. He came in on schedule-

336
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:19,268
stayed on the air for about 20 minutes,
from midnight on.

337
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,434
According to your notes, wasn't that
the evening he said he last saw him?

338
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,809
Yes, sir-
at approximately 9:00.

339
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,976
What do you want me to assume-
Lieutenant Rennick is lying
and you're telling the truth?

340
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:33,817
- I don't know I... may have made
a mistake. I'm sorry.
- You may have made a mistake.

341
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:37,790
We warned you before you left
that you were responsible for
the safety of your teammate.

342
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,795
You show up with a story. He was
picked up by the Wehrmacht
and shipped to the eastern front.

343
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:45,492
I'm telling the truth. I warned him not
to go out at night, but he wouldn't listen.

344
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:49,264
- How do you know they shipped him
to the eastern front?
- I had friends in Mannheim.

345
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:51,931
- One of them checked on it.
<i>- Wait a minute. Didn't you say before...</i>

346
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:54,839
you couldn't get along with Freddy-
you had some kind of an argument?

347
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,503
- Were you lyin' then or now?
- I am not lying, sir.

348
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:01,640
Yes, we had an argument. I got mad and
hit him. And he- he ran out in the street.

349
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:04,082
<i>- Why didn't you tell us that before?</i>
- I did.

350
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:08,020
I just didn't say it was the same night.
I... was frightened, that's all.

351
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:12,992
<i>You know as well as I do,</i>
<i>before summer is over we'll be in</i>
<i>Germany, in every city and town.</i>

352
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:17,555
If you've betrayed us, double agent
or plain crook you'll wind
up in front of a firing squad.

353
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,329
I have nothing to worry about.
I haven't been disloyal, sir. I haven't-

354
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:23,632
- Get him out of here. Watkins.
<i>- Yes, sir. Come on!</i>

355
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:29,040
- Give me a chance to prove
what I've said is true.
- Get out!

356
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:33,510
Got a cigarette, Rennick?

357
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:37,483
- Not the best liar I've heard,
but certainly the biggest.
- Wonder how much Krauts paid him.

358
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:41,147
Pete, I want him sent back to the Joe house
and treated as if nothing had happened.

359
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:45,454
- Siebert, get C.I.C. On it right
away, and tell 'em it's urgent.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:48,461
<i> Hello. Get me Captain</i>
<i>Hendrickson, 708 Cadet Forward, please.</i>

361
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,657
I know it sounds crazy,
but he may be telling the truth.

362
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:54,668
He's too smart a liar
to lie that badly.

363
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:03,005
Well, what's new
in Company "D"?

364
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:05,272
Say, you know what
the "D" stands for?

365
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:09,806
"The damned."
That's what we are.

366
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:14,514
Here, <i>Moniquechen.</i> If anyone
deserves a second helping tonight, I do.

367
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:22,222
I don't have to tell you, the food on the
other side of our glorious Rhine stinks.

368
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,358
What's the matter
with all of you?

369
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:30,268
I go out and do a job while
the rest of you sit here by the fire...

370
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:32,670
and when I come back
you look at me as if-

371
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,675
- Well, for heaven's sake, say something.
- What happened to Freddy?

372
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:39,270
- He was your teammate, wasn't he?
- Sure he was, and he got caught.

373
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:42,214
So what?
That's a chance everyone of us takes.

374
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:46,583
<i>Anyway, I remember none of you</i>
<i>were this upset about Red when he got lost.</i>

375
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:49,145
- Red? That was different.
- How do you know it was?

376
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:52,886
- What do any of you know
about it, huh? Nothing.
<i>- Listen to him talk.</i>

377
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,293
Freddy got caught because he wasn't
smart enough. He was dumb, thick-headed-

378
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:58,832
like the rest of you!

379
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,427
Silence, Tiger!

380
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:04,562
And knock it off, all of ya's.

381
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:10,310
<i>All right. Forget it.</i>

382
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:14,815
<i>Here. You haven't forgotten the old song,</i>
<i>"Will This All Be Remembered"?</i>

383
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:17,544
Well, they are playing it
all over again.

384
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,148
- Um, may I have a cup of coffee, please?
- Sure.

385
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:31,290
- Who was Red?
- A boy who missed his pinpoint.

386
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:33,959
He didn't jump when
the green light went on.

387
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:37,300
He landed 20 miles
off his target outside an S.S. Barracks...

388
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:40,272
with his parachute
tangled in a tree.

389
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:46,506
It doesn't happen often.
You don't have to be afraid.

390
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:49,709
I'm not- not of the jump, anyway.

391
00:29:49,784 --> 00:29:52,116
Then what are you afraid of?

392
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:57,123
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be inquisitive.

393
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,489
Oh, that's all right.
I don't mind.

394
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,499
You know, once I was doing the same job,
and I, too, was afraid the first time I jumped.

395
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:11,027
Maybe in a different way,
but that's why I think
I know what's bothering you.

396
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:13,573
You do? What is it?

397
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:18,169
You are afraid of having to face
your own people, aren't you?

398
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:35,692
<i>Come in.</i>

399
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:38,425
- Officer messenger, sir, with a dispatch.
- Yes?

400
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:40,057
- Colonel Devlin?
- That's right.

401
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:43,695
This is from Colonel Williamson, sir.
Top secret.

402
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:51,372
Come on. Hurry it up. Bringin' you guys
together is getting tougher every day.

403
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:53,777
- What's it all about, anyway?
- Shh. Quiet.

404
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:06,851
All right, gentlemen,
here's the dope.

405
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:11,524
General Jaeger, commanding the Fourth Corps
here along the east bank of the Rhine...

406
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,036
sent emissaries to Switzerland informing us
he's willing to surrender his entire corps...

407
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,571
as soon as he can establish
contact with our troops.

408
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:21,870
He's also requested that we put in
a radio mission hidden here in Mannheim...

409
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:25,516
to act as a communications link between
his headquarters and us. Is that clear?

410
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,584
- Sure.
- Well, looks as if the Krauts
have finally wised up.

411
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:32,679
G2 has approved Jaeger's request and
asked that we put in a tourist mission...

412
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:36,692
about 250 miles behind this sector
here in the vicinity of Munich
to find out how much...

413
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,026
mobile strength the Germans
can bring up to close in the gap
in case the surrender comes off.

414
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:44,192
<i>G2 also suspects that elements</i>
<i>of the 11th Panzer Corps...</i>

415
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:48,329
are being held back here as a mobile reserve
to be thrown in wherever needed.

416
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,135
Now the Mannheim job will require
a team of one radio operator...

417
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,974
and a first-class agent who
really knows the town and has
contacts there he can depend on.

418
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,980
- Who've you got in mind, Colonel?
- Now don't all jump on me.

419
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:02,041
- The only man who can do it
is our friend Barth, the Tiger.

420
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:05,782
Here's the C.I.C. Report that came in
yesterday on the Tiger's first mission.

421
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:08,882
They checked his story, and it seems
that everything he said was true.

422
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,689
Furthermore G2 has given
his intelligence mission an "A" rating.

423
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:14,731
<i>- Besides that, he was</i>-
- Was born and raised in Mannheim.

424
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,791
<i>Right. That's why no matter how</i>
<i>we feel about him, at the moment</i>
<i>he's the logical choice.</i>

425
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,860
What about his teammate,
the radioman?

426
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:24,840
I'd like to talk about that later.
First let's take up the tourist mission.

427
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,207
I want to send Happy.
Any objections?

428
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,042
No, sir. But, so help me,
I don't get sending the Tiger.

429
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,514
- Richards, is Monique here?
- Yes, sir. She's waiting outside.

430
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,485
Ask her to come in. Hold your horses, Pete.
He's not on the plane yet.

431
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,553
- Okay, Bob?
- Yeah. Okay.

432
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,718
Come in,
honey.

433
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,188
Sit down, Monique. Would you care
for a cup of coffee or a cigarette?

434
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,895
Cigarette's okay, sir.

435
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,200
Tell us about the Tiger, Monique.

436
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,934
Have you noticed anything recently
that we should hear about?

437
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,203
No, sir. He hasn't changed.

438
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:04,941
As usual, he doesn't get along with the
others, and he's difficult, but that's all.

439
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:09,748
- How would you feel about
sending him out again?
- I would send him, sir.

440
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,723
- I'm all for that, if it's
just to get rid of him.
- Okay. How about Happy?

441
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,888
- I think that, in many ways,
he's the best of them all.
- Why?

442
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,625
Because-Well, because
he's the first German...

443
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,862
I've known who really believes
in what he's doing.

444
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:29,372
Do you think he's ready to go?

445
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,275
What's the matter, Monique?

446
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,576
There is only one thing that
might make it difficult for him...

447
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,912
maybe because
he's young and honest.

448
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,977
He may begin to doubt himself
once he's back in his own country.

449
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:47,512
<i>If this mission is difficult,</i>
<i>I think it would be better to wait.</i>

450
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,960
Come here a minute, Monique.

451
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:10,442
Their first service since the Germans left.

452
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:14,245
Look, we've known each other
for quite a while. The deal
I made with you in Algiers...

453
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,617
before you jumped into France was that
you'd always be on the level with me.

454
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,679
<i>- Right?</i>
- Yes.

455
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,193
<i>Then I wanna ask you something.</i>
<i>I know what you said about Happy is true...</i>

456
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,353
but I feel there's something
you didn't tell me.

457
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:30,089
- What?
- Are you in love with him?

458
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,804
He's a <i>Boche,</i> sir, like all the others.

459
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:39,434
We have too much to forget
before we can love any of them.

460
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,105
- May I go now?
- Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

461
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,239
Thank you, sir.

462
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,010
- Richards.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

463
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,852
I want Monique transferred.
Do we have another job for her?

464
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:59,055
- I'll see what I can do.
Would Station "K" be all right?
- Sure. Sure, that's fine.

465
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,859
Now about the radioman
for the Mannheim mission-

466
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:05,459
the Germans have requested that one member
of the mission be an American officer.

467
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:09,028
Army agrees. They feel it'll show
we mean business.

468
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:13,736
<i>Therefore, it's clear in this case that</i>
<i>the American will have to be the radioman.</i>

469
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:17,676
- Go ahead, Colonel.
<i>- You're with me, Rennick.</i>

470
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,740
I can't order you to do this,
and under the circumstances...

471
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,309
I'm sure none of us
would blame you if you said no.

472
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:27,517
Can't we get an officer from the
Army Communications Center?
We could train him in a few days.

473
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:31,584
You couldn't train him even in a few weeks.
If you're worried about Tiger, I can handle him.

474
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,687
He'd have a hard time
pushin' me around.

475
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,823
I don't get you.
A few weeks ago...

476
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:39,528
- you didn't seem
to like this job very much.
- Well, he changed his mind.

477
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:44,097
<i>No. I haven't. I still don't like it,</i>
<i>but we have no choice.</i>

478
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:48,110
Besides, you said it was important,
didn't you, Colonel?

479
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:51,170
- Anybody got a cigarette?
<i>- Yeah. Sure.</i>

480
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,411
You know I don't smoke.

481
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:26,476
Well, it fits you fine, sir.
Well, let's check your gear.

482
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,780
- Your shovel- that goes here.
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:34,222
Your landing gun, chute pack, helmet,
gloves- the rucksack's for your radio.

484
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,885
- You better put it in yourself
so you know it's all right.
- Good.

485
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,224
- Everything okay, Rennick?
- No complaints so far, sir.

486
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,459
- Did you pack the chute yourself, Willows?
- Yes. I packed them this morning.

487
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,559
I see you've got all your medals on, Barth-
maybe even a couple of extras.

488
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:50,232
No, sir. They are all my own. Iron Cross
in Norway, <i>Sturmabzeichen</i> in France...

489
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,298
and winter campaign, '41 in the east.

490
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,607
- I wonder how many of our guys
he knocked off to get them.
- None, sir.

491
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,740
I got them all in my own special way.
At your orders, <i>Herr Oberst.</i>

492
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:03,980
- Don't fall in love with that.
You have to bury your gear once you land.
- Yes, sir.

493
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:07,251
- You can go draw your
personal supplies now. Martin.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

494
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:10,987
- Take him over to the prop shop.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

495
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:14,155
- What's the takeoff time?
- 0100 hours, sir. That's if the weather holds.

496
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,496
- Good. When they're through here,
bring 'em to the briefing room.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:20,832
- Got your check-off list?
- Yes.

498
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,537
Here, honey.
Check this guy out.

499
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:38,086
One compass, German cigarettes-
three packages...

500
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:44,116
Wehrmacht ration stamps,
Benzedrines- five tablets.

501
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:49,029
They're stimulants.
Don't take more than one a day.

502
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:53,160
German razor blades- six-
and one razor...

503
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:57,173
German maps-
Sheet Y3, Y4, Y5.

504
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:02,868
Let's see. That's all.

505
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:06,712
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you, Monique.

506
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:11,220
<i>Okay, Happy. Here you are, Monique,</i>
<i>two more customers.</i>

507
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:14,655
If there's anything else
you can think of, sir, just let me know.

508
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:20,592
If you're all through, Happy,
the colonel wants you in the briefing room.

509
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,757
Yes, sir.

510
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,331
These are his papers, sir.

511
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:30,772
His <i>Soldbuch</i> with his health record
inside and his orders.

512
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,935
Money and his Wehrmacht
travel certificates are in this envelope.

513
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,913
All right, Happy. Let's go over it once more.
What name are you traveling under?

514
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:41,348
Steiner, Karl, a Luftwaffe medic-
number L43587.

515
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:44,216
<i>We took his age, place of birth,</i>
<i>etc., out of his own</i> Soldbuch.

516
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,382
Well, at least you didn't have to
memorize that. What's your cover?

517
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,620
I'm on sick leave, returning
from Base Hospital 12 at Bad Reichenhall.

518
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:54,289
- What was the doctor's name
who signed your orders?
- Foerster. I had pneumonia.

519
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:56,958
- We marked it on the health record
with Code number 7.
- Good.

520
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,127
Now show me your pinpoint.

521
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:02,296
It's here, east of München,
near Fridolfing.

522
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,637
After I bury my chute and my gear, I go to
München by way of Wasserburg Highway.

523
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:09,236
- I am to make my way back
to my outfit near Mannheim.
- And your route?

524
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,373
It's München, Augsburg,
Stuttgart, and then Mannheim.

525
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,917
- And what's your objective?
- To locate the 11th Panzer Corps.

526
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:18,614
Their headquarters are believed to be in
this area somewhere northwest of München.

527
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,625
- Suppose you change your route?
- For that I have an extra set of
travel orders and a date stamp.

528
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:28,461
Right. Here they are- extra set of orders,
date stamp, official Wehrmacht seal.

529
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,559
- Mark your map so that no one
except you can interpret it.
- I know, sir.

530
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:36,333
<i>Pardon me, sir. Rennick and the Tiger</i>
<i>are ready for you. We haven't got much time.</i>

531
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:39,603
Bring them in. Get back here, Happy.
Even if you haven't done it all...

532
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:42,406
- you've gotta be back here in five days.
- I will, sir.

533
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,538
<i>Okay, Happy.</i>

534
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:49,251
- Well, how does it feel
to be a civilian again?
- Fine.

535
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,685
Just tell the pilot
to drop me in Cleveland, Ohio.

536
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:55,452
If you want to get back to Cleveland,
better concentrate on this.
Where's your pinpoint?

537
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:59,757
It's a meadow about five kilometers
south of Beerfelden, sir.

538
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,527
- You know exactly where that is?
- I've only been starin' at it
on a map for three solid days.

539
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,161
In case you're separated on landing,
what's the address
of the safe house in Mannheim?

540
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:12,174
- Eighteen Neckarstrasse, second floor, rear.
- Eighteen? You're sure? Not 28?

541
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,938
- Eighteen.
- Knock off the kidding, Pete.
How about you, Barth?

542
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,980
Are you certain your people in Mannheim
will let the lieutenant in?

543
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,540
Yes. He must knock four times
with an interval after the first two.

544
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:25,884
- When they open, he has only to say,
"Greetings from the Tiger."
- Okay.

545
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,722
We told General Jaegers people
where they can contact you.
Now is there anything else?

546
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:33,320
<i>Yeah- one little thing.</i>

547
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:37,231
While we're all talking
here together as friends...

548
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,031
I'd just like to say that what happened
to Freddy is not gonna happen to me.

549
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:45,268
If I get caught, it won't be my fault.
Is that clear?

550
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,607
- What do you mean?
- He means just what he said.

551
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:52,705
Lieutenant Rennick is not likely
to want to take a walk around
Mannheim just for the fun of it.

552
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:57,516
Furthermore, in any disagreement
that might come, no matter what,
Rennick will always be right.

553
00:40:57,587 --> 00:41:02,524
Get that through your head, Barth.
Lieutenant Rennick will always be right.

554
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,434
- I don't know. Sometimes
I'd rather go than stay behind.
- Don't kid yourself, brother.

555
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:34,380
Get ready.
We're approaching the first target.

556
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,255
Action stations!

557
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,764
The address!
I forgot the address in Mannheim.

558
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,824
- What?
- I forgot the address!

559
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:48,393
- Eighteen Neckarstrasse. Eighteen!
- Target!

560
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:02,644
<i>Eighteen Neckarstrasse. Eighteen!</i>

561
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,914
Eighteen Neckarstrasse. Eighteen.

562
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:07,980
<i> Well, bud,</i>
<i>how does it feel to be going home?</i>

563
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,959
Home?
Fine, I hope.

564
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:14,292
- Well, if you're hungry, Amigo
here'll give you a sandwich.
- No, thank you.

565
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:18,562
Well, <i>hasta luego, muchachos.</i> I'll let you
know a few minutes before we approach.

566
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,638
- Are you an American?
- Why? Don't I look like one?

567
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,702
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.
- You didn't, huh?

568
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:34,944
I just hope that before this is over,
I can get a crack at a couple
of squareheads like you.

569
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:39,182
- You hate us, don't you?
- Call it anything you like.
I haven't yet felt sorry...

570
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,952
when I've seen a string of 100-pounders
leave that bomb rack.

571
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:45,392
- Here's some coffee.
- Thank you.

572
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:04,473
The pilot wants you to know you may
be a mile or two off the pinpoint. Come on.

573
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:11,152
<i>Stand by!</i>

574
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,382
Target!

575
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,995
<i> Next stop,</i>
<i>München, center of town.</i>

576
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:08,859
<i>All men proceeding further</i>
<i>than München will stamp their orders...</i>

577
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,092
<i>at the</i> Frontleitstelle
<i>in the main station.</i>

578
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,032
Extra! Extra!
<i>Münchener Post.</i>

579
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:32,053
Say, have you got 10 pfennigs?
Too bad, but I have no change. Just a-

580
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:34,248
- Here. Here's a mark.
- Thank you.

581
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:37,759
Here, <i>Mutter.</i>
Keep the change.

582
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:12,326
- What are you looking for?
- Uh, the <i>Frontleitstelle,</i> please.

583
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:15,387
- Right over there.
- Thank you.

584
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:35,243
I'm returning to my unit
from the hospital in Bad Reichenhall.

585
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,510
Who took this week's security list?

586
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:43,287
- Number nine hasn't come in yet.
Here's last week's list.
- Thank you.

587
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,729
Steiner, Steiner, Steiner-
Steiner. All right.

588
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:53,167
To Mannheim by the way
of Augsburg, Ulm, Stuttgart.

589
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:57,400
You get your train information
from the Wehrmacht <i>Kontroller</i>
outside on the platform. Next.

590
00:47:57,473 --> 00:48:00,237
Uh, please, I have a friend
in the 11th Panzer Corps.

591
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,176
- Do you know where their headquarters are?
- Eleventh Panzer Corps?

592
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:06,409
- I heard they were around here somewhere.
- Weren't they in Fürth?

593
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:08,575
<i>- Yes, it's just outside of Nuremberg.</i>
- Thanks.

594
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:12,883
<i>- To Freiburg.</i>
<i>- Please don't crowd.</i>
<i>One at a time.</i>

595
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:15,321
<i>- Anything wrong with my ticket?</i>
<i>- Wait a moment.</i>

596
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:17,484
<i>I'll just check with the</i> Unteroffizier.

597
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,654
- Uh, when is the next train
to Nuremberg, Fräulein?
- Your orders?

598
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,563
I don't know if the track to Nuremberg
is repaired. Wait a minute.

599
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:27,592
- Sure it is. There's a train at 9:30.
- Trudy, Nuremberg all right?

600
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,833
- Yes. They just finished
working on the track.
- Guess you were right.

601
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:33,773
I usually am, Fräulein.
Come on. Track seven.

602
00:48:33,843 --> 00:48:36,744
The night is shorter
when you have someone to talk to.

603
00:48:56,866 --> 00:49:01,360
Say, I hope you don't mind, but,
uh, I've been meaning to ask you.

604
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:04,270
Where did you get all your money?

605
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,141
- What money?
- That fat roll you
carry in your pocket.

606
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:12,544
I just got back pay for three months.
Besides, it isn't very much.

607
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:18,554
Well, I really don't care how much it is,
as long as you'll kindly agree to...

608
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,089
loan me-
let's say- half of it?

609
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:24,422
Now let me explain it to you.
I'm simply in need of cash...

610
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:27,121
<i>and I'm perfectly willing</i>
<i>to let you profit by it.</i>

611
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:33,157
Here. Take your choice. Where else in our
country could you get a better deal?

612
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:36,102
Paper for gold.

613
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:41,109
<i>The fat stomach this used to go around,</i>
<i>I assure you, is much thinner now.</i>

614
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:45,773
But maybe this. This is a better
investment for a young man like you.

615
00:49:45,848 --> 00:49:48,009
It comes from a good marriage.

616
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:53,750
I think they had been together-
yeah- 25 years. How about it?

617
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:57,816
No thanks.
I don't plan to get married.

618
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:59,918
Well, that's up to you.

619
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:03,226
But if you change your mind,
remember, you'll be helping a friend.

620
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,893
Who knows?
Maybe someday you'll need one.

621
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,630
I think we better get some sleep now.

622
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:12,003
You know, sometimes I envy
you fellows at the front.

623
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:16,408
At least you can save your money.
Me, I spend all mine here-

624
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:19,573
on trains or busses
or, at best, on my motorcycle.

625
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:24,915
<i>I'm Scholtz, special courier</i>
<i>of the Waffen S.S. Some title, eh?</i>

626
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:29,083
But money? No.

627
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:33,094
Well-
Happy dreams, Corporal.

628
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:47,509
<i> Your main objective</i>
<i>is to locate the 11th Panzer Corps.</i>

629
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:49,669
<i>Weren't they in Fürth?</i>

630
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:52,543
<i> Are you sure</i>
<i>you'll stick to your convictions?</i>

631
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:54,606
<i>You'll be facing your own people.</i>

632
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:59,619
<i> The fat stomach</i>
<i>this used to go around, I assure you...</i>

633
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:03,715
<i>is much thinner now.</i>

634
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:07,695
<i> It may become hard</i>
<i>for you then to hold on to your beliefs.</i>

635
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:24,681
<i>- Halt! Hey! Halt!</i>

636
00:51:24,757 --> 00:51:26,782
<i>Everybody out! Halt!</i>

637
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:30,192
Halt! Halt!

638
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:36,027
Come on. Keep moving.

639
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:39,036
<i> We have to clear the track.</i>
<i>Other trains are coming.</i>

640
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:41,095
<i>Come on.</i>

641
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:50,844
Hey! What's going on?
Is this Nuremberg?

642
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:54,784
That's right. They hit us
for three hours this morning.

643
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,451
Keep in line.

644
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:04,847
<i>- Keep in line.</i>
<i>- You'll all be</i>
<i>rerouted at the</i> Frontleitstelle.

645
00:52:04,923 --> 00:52:10,623
<i>Attention. Left face. March. Hut. Hut.</i>

646
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,444
Would you know if the 11th Panzer Corps
is still in Fürth?

647
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,639
Eleventh Panzer Corps?
No, I don't.

648
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,077
How do I get to Fürth, please?

649
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,019
Can't you read? Over there.

650
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:42,986
<i>Don't crowd, please. Don't crowd.</i>

651
00:52:49,668 --> 00:52:51,659
<i>Keep moving, please.</i>

652
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:53,830
- My sister was bombed out last night-
- Oh, excuse me.

653
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:56,237
- For the third time.
- How long can it go on?

654
00:52:56,308 --> 00:53:00,074
- How long can they expect us
to live like this?
- Shh! Don't talk like that.

655
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:02,409
Yes. And then he kept
complaining about the food.

656
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:04,642
"You get it all at the front,"
I told him.

657
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:07,844
He laughed like he was crazy.
Fritz, my own son.

658
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:10,479
<i>Karl! Karl!</i>

659
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:14,821
Herr Maurer. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

660
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:17,487
You're Karl Maurer, aren't you?
Don't you remember me?

661
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:20,258
I'm Paula Schneider.
I worked for your father in Berlin.

662
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:23,301
Sure, I remember.
You were the head nurse at his clinic.

663
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,132
I suppose it's the uniform.
It does make us all look different.

664
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:29,696
- How long have you been
in the Luftwaffe?
- I was called in '43.

665
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:33,142
Look at you. I remember
when you first started school.

666
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,338
You were still living
across from the clinic.

667
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:37,439
That was a long time ago, wasn't it?

668
00:53:37,516 --> 00:53:40,747
<i>Nuremburg west, control point.</i>
<i>All passengers out.</i>

669
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:57,190
I saw your father yesterday
at the base hospital in Würzburg.

670
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:59,737
- You saw my father?
- Yes. Did you know he was stationed there?

671
00:53:59,805 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh, yes. I heard he was
transferred from Berlin.

672
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,201
He's better off in Würzburg.
Safer, I hope. Are you going to see him?

673
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:07,643
I'm trying to get permission
to stop there.

674
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:11,546
Well, they'll give it to you. Just tell them
you haven't seen your father for a long time.

675
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:15,712
- Name and rank?
- Schneider, Paula. F.P.N. 347.

676
00:54:15,787 --> 00:54:18,483
All right, go ahead.
Name and rank?

677
00:54:18,557 --> 00:54:20,752
Uh, I'm afraid I didn't have
my orders stamped today.

678
00:54:20,826 --> 00:54:23,522
You'll have to see the <i>Feldwebel.</i>
He's at the main control point.

679
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:26,155
Excuse me. Maybe I can help.
I know the corporal very well.

680
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:29,667
His father is chief surgeon at the Würzburg
base hospital. If you want, I can vouch for-

681
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:32,100
Don't worry, Fräulein Schneider.
It's just a formality. Go ahead.

682
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,662
- Well, when you see your father,
please give him my best.
- I will. Thank you.

683
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,901
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen. Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

684
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:44,506
Hey, where you going? It's up there
on your left next to the monument.

685
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:47,552
<i>This is the control point,</i>
<i>not the</i> Kommandatur.

686
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:51,453
<i>I can't help you if your papers</i>
<i>aren't in order. Come on, get moving.</i>

687
00:54:54,993 --> 00:54:57,723
<i>I know. I know. Not you.</i>
<i>I can't let you through.</i>

688
00:54:57,796 --> 00:55:00,060
- Corporal Steiner reporting, sir.
- Yes?

689
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,998
I didn't have a chance to get
my orders stamped in Nuremburg.

690
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:06,236
I'm looking for H.Q., 11th Corps.

691
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:10,365
Eleventh Corps? They moved
a couple of days ago to Crailsheim.

692
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:12,433
I see you've been
in the army two years.

693
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:14,979
Don't you know you should
have your orders stamped?

694
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:17,139
Say, look who's coming.

695
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:20,983
<i>Hey, Heinz.</i>
<i>What happened to you?</i>

696
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:23,919
I haven't seen you
and your tin horse for quite a while.

697
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,583
Just back from a trip east.
But as you see...

698
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,092
it didn't take long for them
to get me on the road again.

699
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,321
<i>I'm on my way to Würzburg now.</i>

700
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:34,092
Well, if it isn't the corporal.

701
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:37,828
<i>- Do you know him?</i>
- Know him? Why, he's a good friend of mine.

702
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:41,999
- Anything wrong?
<i>- No, nothing serious.</i>
<i>I'll let you through this time.</i>

703
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:44,473
- This man with Corporal Scholtz can pass.
<i>- Okay.</i>

704
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:47,068
Thanks. I'll be back tomorrow.

705
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:51,138
See, sometimes it's good to have a friend.
Where are you going?

706
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:53,946
I'm trying to get to
Crailsheim by tonight.

707
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:58,752
Well, if you don't mind a little
detour, I'll give you a ride. Come on.

708
00:56:36,928 --> 00:56:41,297
I'll be right back. Just have to make
a pickup at the <i>Kommandatur.</i>

709
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:45,029
Frau Karen? Frau Karen,
can I have 10 liters?

710
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:47,765
Certainly, sir.
There's always some for you.

711
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:52,634
- Good day, sir.
- Badly hit here in Würzburg, weren't you?

712
00:56:52,711 --> 00:56:56,340
Yes. Last fall.
But it's coming back to life again.

713
00:56:56,414 --> 00:57:00,680
They moved a big chemical plant
into town last month from East Prussia.

714
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:03,050
Uh, there is a base hospital
here, isn't there?

715
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:05,885
Yes, up there on the <i>Berg.</i>

716
00:57:05,957 --> 00:57:08,755
<i>Most of the casualties from</i>
<i>the west come through here.</i>

717
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:12,092
<i>- It's next to the factory.</i>
- Uh, do you have a phone?

718
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:14,393
Inside. It's an army line.

719
00:57:18,003 --> 00:57:20,267
<i>It's to your right.</i>

720
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,113
- Yes?
- The base hospital, please.

721
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,617
- Hello.
- Uh, base hospital?

722
00:57:36,688 --> 00:57:40,954
- Yes.
- Can I talk to Dr. Maurer?
Dr. Friedrich Maurer?

723
00:57:41,026 --> 00:57:44,553
Hold the line, please.
I'll connect you with him.

724
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,927
Hello?

725
00:57:46,998 --> 00:57:49,796
Hello. This is Dr. Maurer.

726
00:57:49,868 --> 00:57:54,567
- Operator, did you ring me?
- Yes, sir. The party's still on the line.

727
00:57:54,639 --> 00:58:00,305
I can't hear them. Hello. Hello!
Are you calling Dr. Maurer? Hello.

728
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:02,846
Operator, this must be a mistake.

729
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:11,481
Got some friends here?

730
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:13,649
I thought I had.

731
00:58:13,725 --> 00:58:18,253
Well, I know a good place where we can
spend the night, right near Crailsheim.

732
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,627
It's a little out of the way,
but it's worth it.

733
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:23,293
<i>- Heil Hitler, Frau Karen.</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

734
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,900
There's no more room tonight.
Everything's taken.

735
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:36,913
I know. I know.

736
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:38,972
I tell you there's no more room.

737
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,644
- Is Frau Kollwitz across the alley?
- There's nothing she can do-

738
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,813
Come on.

739
00:58:47,826 --> 00:58:49,953
One of the few places
left in Germany...

740
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:52,826
where a soldier can get a clean bed
and a bottle of wine.

741
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:56,924
- That is, if he has money.
- Or if he has a friend who will pay for him.

742
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:59,196
That's right.

743
00:59:07,746 --> 00:59:11,842
- Hey, is Fritzi around?
- Fritzi? Yeah, I just saw her.

744
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:18,215
- Say, don't I know you?
- You? I can't quite remember.

745
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:23,022
- Liar. Is Fritzi in the office?
- Uh, yeah, there.

746
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:25,790
Take care of my friend here.
I'll be right back.

747
00:59:25,864 --> 00:59:31,393
There's still some wine left
for special guests. Want it?

748
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:35,963
- Is this place legal?
- It's as much a part of
the Wehrmacht as your Luftwaffe.

749
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:41,808
Only the dancing is illegal. But then again,
it all depends on how you look at it.

750
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,314
- Want the change?
- No, never mind.

751
00:59:44,382 --> 00:59:48,580
Oh, thanks. I would never have asked
before, but now I would starve if I didn't.

752
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:51,144
We're only open two days a week.

753
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:54,214
- Isn't the 11th Panzer Corps
stationed somewhere around here?
- Two beer.

754
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:58,422
They were in Crailsheim, right
near here, but they've gone.

755
00:59:58,496 --> 01:00:00,657
A few clerks are all that's left.

756
01:00:00,732 --> 01:00:03,860
And once in a while
we get some transients, like you.

757
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,218
<i>- Want to dance?</i>
<i>- No, thank you.</i>

758
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:31,785
I thought you weren't
supposed to nowadays.

759
01:00:31,863 --> 01:00:37,597
We're not supposed to have wine either,
but that doesn't seem to bother you.

760
01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:41,298
You must know your way around here.
How about getting me a glass?

761
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:43,670
Well, go ahead. I'm not thirsty.

762
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:47,106
Well, thank you, sir.

763
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,272
<i> We interrupt this</i>
<i>broadcast to bring you the latest news.</i>

764
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,410
On the western front, in the vicinity
of Mannheim-

765
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,545
Hey! Turn it off.

766
01:00:57,622 --> 01:00:59,749
- Come on Kurt.
- Come on Kurt. We want music.

767
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,884
- Yeah, let's have some music.
- How about waltz?

768
01:01:10,702 --> 01:01:14,263
...heavy enemy pressure near Koblenz.
- Still interested in that?

769
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:17,274
- Does it bother you?
- No. Just bores me.

770
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:19,640
Who wants to
know nowadays?

771
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:23,169
Our grenadiers are heroically
holding their positions.

772
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:25,944
Holding their positions.
It never changes.

773
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:29,248
Until one morning, you'll open the window
and they'll be there, the Amis.

774
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,754
- Hilde, will you please tell him to stop it.
- What's the matter?

775
01:01:31,823 --> 01:01:34,018
I can't help it.
But he makes me cry.

776
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:36,959
This is an official
announcement of the München <i>Kommandatur.</i>

777
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:40,828
The enemy parachutist reported
yesterday near Altenmarkt is still at large.

778
01:01:40,899 --> 01:01:43,094
He's believed to be
wearing Luftwaffe boots...

779
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,863
<i>as his footprints near the buried</i>
<i>parachute have disclosed.</i>

780
01:01:45,937 --> 01:01:48,531
- Anything important?
<i>- Uh, no, nothing important.</i>

781
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:51,097
Well, Hilde,
I haven't seen you since Leipzig.

782
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,268
They certainly move
you people around.

783
01:01:53,344 --> 01:01:57,974
Fritzi, this is Corporal-
Say, what is your name?

784
01:01:58,049 --> 01:02:00,984
- Steiner. Karl Steiner.
<i>- My name is Scholtz.</i>

785
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,111
And this is Fritzi Kollwitz.

786
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,348
Everything's fine.
We have a room across the street...

787
01:02:05,423 --> 01:02:07,482
and thanks to Fritzi,
plenty of food.

788
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:10,527
And now, what's most important.
How about something decent to drink?

789
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:14,395
It's not that easy anymore, Heinz, huh?
But I'll see what I can do.

790
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,899
We were lucky to run into
each other, weren't we, Karl?

791
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:20,734
You've got money,
and I know how to spend it.

792
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:22,966
Pardon me,
but if you still like to dance?

793
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,168
Oh. You're not as slow
as I thought.

794
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,575
I hope you don't think
you are doing me a favor.

795
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:30,409
<i>I only changed my mind.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>

796
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:33,814
But you better hurry up
or there won't be much left.

797
01:02:36,955 --> 01:02:41,756
- Where'd you learn to dance?
- In a school, in Potsdam.

798
01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:46,820
Haven't you danced since?
Come on, Corporal, I won't break.

799
01:02:50,735 --> 01:02:55,069
- Is that better?
- Well, isn't it?

800
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:06,744
- Coming, Hilde?
- I'll be right there.

801
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:10,754
Pretty, huh? Lost her leg
a year ago in Breslau.

802
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:16,290
- Are you with a show?
- Yes. <i>Soldaten Variete.</i>

803
01:03:16,361 --> 01:03:20,320
Well, it's still better
than the labor front, not much better.

804
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,934
Maybe I'm not what
you're looking for?

805
01:03:26,004 --> 01:03:29,565
Maybe a sweet young man like you
would rather have someone your own age?

806
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,633
- Aren't you?
- Now don't be generous.

807
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:35,975
If you'd seen me
a couple of years ago-

808
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:40,984
Why in '42 in the summer, there
was an Italian major in Milano.
He wanted to marry me.

809
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:50,284
<i>Here. Fritzi has found something special,</i>
<i>a real Steinhager. Eighty percent.</i>

810
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:52,625
Just try it, Hilde.

811
01:03:52,697 --> 01:03:57,293
Don't let anybody touch that.

812
01:03:57,368 --> 01:03:59,632
- How about you?
- No, thank you.

813
01:03:59,704 --> 01:04:02,901
What? Enjoy yourself
while you can, soldier.

814
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:07,001
It may not happen to us again.
We may all go, all at once, fast.

815
01:04:07,078 --> 01:04:09,103
May I have one
of your cigarettes?

816
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,580
<i>Well, even if we do,</i>
<i>we've had a good time, haven't we?</i>

817
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:13,981
We've given the world 12 years
it will never forget.

818
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:17,021
And no matter what they do,
they'll never get us out of their system.

819
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:19,818
<i> And now there'll be a little song</i>
<i>which was composed by our soldiers...</i>

820
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:22,257
<i>when they were</i>
<i>stationed in Paris.</i>

821
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:35,762
We're the <i>Boche</i> again now.

822
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,540
But I remember Paris in '41,
that first summer. Do you know Paris, Karl?

823
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:45,946
- No. The only part of France
I've seen was Alsace.
- Alsace?

824
01:04:47,585 --> 01:04:50,145
Yes. I was there with
my outfit a few months ago.

825
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:53,520
No true German
thinks of Alsace as a part of France.

826
01:04:53,591 --> 01:04:55,821
It's as German as the Rhineland
or the Saar.

827
01:04:55,893 --> 01:05:01,456
I only thought of it as France because I
remember we took it from the French.

828
01:05:01,532 --> 01:05:06,492
We didn't take it. We took it back.
We took what belonged to us and maybe more.

829
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:09,563
- Well, we did it, and we'll do it again!
- Heinz. Heinz, please.

830
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,904
You're right, Fritzi.
You're right.

831
01:05:11,976 --> 01:05:14,381
You see what a good influence
women are on men?

832
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:18,212
<i> Hmm, sometimes, not always.</i>

833
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:21,311
I think I'd better get some sleep.
I have to get up very early.

834
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:25,085
Sure, go ahead, Corporal. The woman
at the desk will show you to your room.

835
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,672
Not only did you forget
to say good-bye to me, Corporal...

836
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,685
but you also forgot
these things downstairs.

837
01:06:28,756 --> 01:06:34,353
And, uh, and you left these
on the table.

838
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:37,056
Thank you.

839
01:06:38,732 --> 01:06:41,530
You know, we haven't seen
this kind for quite a while.

840
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:44,901
A doctor gave them to me...

841
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:49,409
<i>- in a hospital.</i>
- Want one?

842
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:52,809
No. I'd like to get some sleep.

843
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:59,844
You want me to get out, is that it?

844
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,979
Yes, I do.

845
01:07:02,056 --> 01:07:05,514
You don't like me.
Why don't you say so?

846
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:08,221
That has nothing
to do with it.

847
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:11,696
It's just that
I feel sorry for you.

848
01:07:11,765 --> 01:07:15,257
Sorry for me?
Who do you think you are?

849
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:18,669
I've known better men than you
and they didn't turn their noses up at me.

850
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:21,503
But then I suppose they
weren't brought up like you.

851
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:25,443
Oh, I know your type. The little German
<i>Bürger,</i> pure and honest.

852
01:07:25,512 --> 01:07:28,413
You've been taught to keep your distance,
to keep your hands clean.

853
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:31,940
Well, you are as dirty
as the rest of us now.

854
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:34,749
Come on.
Get out of here.

855
01:07:34,822 --> 01:07:36,881
And let me
tell you something.

856
01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:40,358
I was in love once with a man who to me
was as decent as you think you are.

857
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:45,524
And what's more, he was in love with me.
But he was killed in Norway.

858
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,536
And when I bore his child,
his family turned away from me
as- as is if I were a stranger.

859
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:57,299
I got a job. Nothing to be proud of,
but it kept us alive.

860
01:07:57,378 --> 01:08:00,905
And then one day
my child was killed.

861
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:05,714
There was a raid. And when I came home
after work that night...

862
01:08:05,786 --> 01:08:09,222
there was nothing left
of the street where I lived.

863
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:12,691
I couldn't find her.
I never did.

864
01:08:14,628 --> 01:08:17,825
From then on,
I didn't care what happened.

865
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:21,129
I just hated-
hated everybody.

866
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:25,399
But probably myself most of all.

867
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:28,066
Why? You want to know why?

868
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:33,808
Because I was hungry. Hungry for
a little kindness and- and love and-

869
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,711
<i>I don't know.</i>

870
01:08:40,721 --> 01:08:43,189
Maybe it was all my fault.

871
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:48,127
Anyway here I am-

872
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:52,962
dirty, miserable and alone.

873
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:56,594
There are thousands
and thousands like me.

874
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:02,267
Well, now you know me.
Are you satisfied?

875
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:14,348
Here. Drink this. Go ahead.

876
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:19,181
I'm sorry. I-
I just couldn't help it.

877
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:27,761
What's the matter, dear?
Anything wrong?

878
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,563
Get out.

879
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,470
Get out, I said.

880
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:06,269
I thought you said you were tired.

881
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:33,925
<i> There are thousands</i>
<i>and thousand like me.</i>

882
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:37,266
<i> We've given</i>
<i>the world 12 years it will never forget.</i>

883
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:39,897
<i>Do you know what you're getting into?</i>

884
01:10:39,973 --> 01:10:44,273
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>Are you calling Dr. Maurer? Hello?</i>

885
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:47,939
<i> Your father</i>
<i>is at the base hospital in Würzburg now.</i>

886
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:51,610
<i> Up on the</i> Berg.
<i>The hospital is next to the factory.</i>

887
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:55,143
<i> Your main objective</i>
<i>is to locate the 11th Panzer Corps.</i>

888
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:10,961
<i>Say, Corporal Steiner.</i>

889
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:14,667
<i>Here is a message about your transportation.</i>
<i>You've got to report to the</i> Marktplatz.

890
01:11:14,741 --> 01:11:16,800
Thank you.

891
01:11:16,877 --> 01:11:19,505
Could you help me, Corporal?

892
01:11:22,182 --> 01:11:25,276
I have to talk to you.
It's shorter this way.

893
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:27,479
Will you follow me?

894
01:11:43,504 --> 01:11:47,634
Look, it isn't any of my business
who you are or- or what you've done, but-

895
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,972
What are you talking about?

896
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:53,012
I know its hard to make you believe
I'm telling the truth.

897
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,378
But you must trust me. You must.

898
01:11:55,449 --> 01:12:00,512
- What is it?
- Last night, you know
who sent me to your room?

899
01:12:00,587 --> 01:12:02,714
It was Scholtz.
He ordered me to watch you.

900
01:12:02,789 --> 01:12:05,314
Look out.

901
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:08,156
Thank you, Corporal, for helping me.
I can carry it myself.

902
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:11,493
Hey, Steiner, I'm afraid
I have to get back to Nuremburg.

903
01:12:11,565 --> 01:12:13,658
But the truck over there
is going your way.

904
01:12:13,734 --> 01:12:16,294
It's all fixed.
The driver knows all about you.

905
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:20,602
Sorry about last night. I had a couple
too many. Have a good trip.

906
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,390
All right.

907
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:25,965
Here, pass it around.

908
01:13:42,623 --> 01:13:47,617
- Didn't you say it was Scholtz
who ordered you to watch me?
- Yes, it was.

909
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:51,130
Well, if he did,
why did you tell me about it?

910
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:53,393
I'm not quite sure why.

911
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:57,836
But last night, for the first time,
you made me realize what was happening to me.

912
01:13:57,904 --> 01:14:02,341
- That I can't go on like this.
That there is some reason-
- All right.

913
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:06,743
Let's suppose you are telling the truth,
that Scholtz is suspicious of me.

914
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:08,804
That still doesn't prove he's right.

915
01:14:08,882 --> 01:14:11,817
I don't care if he is right or not.
All I know is they're after you.

916
01:14:11,885 --> 01:14:14,615
Look, Karl, I know these people.
I know them too well.

917
01:14:14,688 --> 01:14:20,456
If you need money, here,
I have this ring. You can sell it.

918
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:23,519
<i>Hilde, the Corporal here</i>
<i>said this may help keep you warm.</i>

919
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:27,192
<i>No, thank you.</i>

920
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:30,862
Do you know that man over there?

921
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:35,169
- Which one?
- In the corner with the glasses on.

922
01:14:35,242 --> 01:14:37,335
- Halt!
- No, I don't.

923
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:39,971
<i>- Halt!</i>
- What's the matter, sir?

924
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:44,040
Everybody off.
Oh, I mean except the ladies.

925
01:14:46,086 --> 01:14:49,214
Karl, be careful.
I didn't lie to you.

926
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:02,662
You think you can still see
what you're shooting at?

927
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:04,727
Yes, at your orders,
<i>Herr Oberleutnant.</i>

928
01:15:04,805 --> 01:15:09,469
- All right, Sergeant, take them away.
- Left face. Forward, march.

929
01:15:09,543 --> 01:15:12,910
Take the women to the village and have
the truck inspected by our ordinance.

930
01:15:12,979 --> 01:15:15,379
Yes, sir.

931
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:17,974
All right, let's go.

932
01:15:42,809 --> 01:15:45,869
Detail, <i>halt!</i>

933
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:48,847
Left face!

934
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:53,079
- Eighteen more.
- Get all your papers out and stand by.

935
01:15:53,153 --> 01:15:55,451
Twenty-seven all together,
<i>Herr Oberleutnant.</i>

936
01:15:55,522 --> 01:15:57,717
All right, men.

937
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:01,352
You are about to be processed to see
which one of you will fulfill our needs here.

938
01:16:01,428 --> 01:16:05,421
This is an emergency measure
taken by order of the commanding
general, 11th Panzer Corps.

939
01:16:05,499 --> 01:16:09,560
Those of you who will not be selected will
be allowed to proceed to your regular units.

940
01:16:09,636 --> 01:16:12,469
At ease. Carry on, Klinger.

941
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:18,976
Say, isn't that a medic back there?
I'm talking to you, lancer.

942
01:16:19,045 --> 01:16:22,310
Come on. You heard
the lieutenant. Move out.

943
01:16:22,382 --> 01:16:25,010
<i>Soldbuch.</i>
Come on.

944
01:16:27,454 --> 01:16:31,948
- What unit are you going to?
- The 20th Flak, sir. Attached
to the 16th Infantry Division.

945
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:35,756
- All right. Get him to the
colonel's quarters right away.
- Yes, sir.

946
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:38,764
- What about my unit, sir?
- They'll have to get along
without you, I guess.

947
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:41,027
Come on. Follow me.

948
01:16:50,477 --> 01:16:53,412
<i>Leutnant</i> Bulow said this man
is to report to <i>Oberst</i> Von Ecker.

949
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,471
- Oh, yes. Gutterman.
- Yes, sir.

950
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:58,313
Take this man upstairs to Major Hartmann.
He knows all about it.

951
01:16:58,385 --> 01:17:00,546
Yes, sir.

952
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:12,430
<i>- Hartmann, give me his file.</i>
<i>- Here it is, sir.</i>

953
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:15,024
<i> The court-martial convened</i>
<i>upon my orders yesterday...</i>

954
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:17,296
<i>has found you guilty</i>
<i>of willful desertion...</i>

955
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:20,430
<i>and has therefore recommended</i>
<i>that the extreme penalty be imposed...</i>

956
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:23,135
<i>that you be hanged</i>
<i>by the neck until dead.</i>

957
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:26,441
<i>I can't see any reason why their</i>
<i>sentence shouldn't be carried out.</i>

958
01:17:26,513 --> 01:17:29,107
I beg you, sir. My wife and children
were bombed out.

959
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:31,707
I had to find a place for them
to keep them alive.

960
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:34,948
So you took it upon yourself
to stay with them and neglect your duty.

961
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:37,990
But that was my only mistake,
sir, after 20 years service.

962
01:17:38,058 --> 01:17:41,289
Today, it's more than a mistake.
It's a crime.

963
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:43,829
You, Leerback, should know that better
than any of the others.

964
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:46,297
Yes, sir. But you can't let them
kill me for that.

965
01:17:46,366 --> 01:17:50,302
I beg you, sir. Not just for myself,
but for my family, my children.

966
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,895
I'm sorry. In these times,
the discipline of our troops...

967
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:55,203
is more important than
our personal destinies.

968
01:17:55,275 --> 01:17:58,802
- That's all, Leerback.
- Sir, I beg you to reconsider.

969
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:01,905
- I'll do anything. Anything you ask.
- Stop it.

970
01:18:01,982 --> 01:18:05,918
You're supposed to be a soldier.
Act like one. Take him away.

971
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:14,420
Come with me.

972
01:18:22,002 --> 01:18:24,266
Take your coat off.

973
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:30,408
- The medic is here, sir.
- All right.

974
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:33,913
The Luftwaffe is about the only uniform
we haven't collected here as yet.

975
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,744
At ease. Your name and unit?

976
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:39,341
Corporal Steiner, sir, 20th Flak.

977
01:18:39,419 --> 01:18:41,887
I was on my way to Mannheim
to rejoin my unit.

978
01:18:41,955 --> 01:18:44,856
There's a tray on the table
next to my bed. Bring it here, please.

979
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:47,120
Yes, sir.

980
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:53,633
- Will you read the labels aloud?
- Yes, sir.

981
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:59,138
"Five ampules of digifolin,
one c.c. In case of emergency.

982
01:19:00,974 --> 01:19:05,070
"Nitroglycerin tablets,
1/10 of a gram.

983
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:07,773
Alcohol." That's all, sir.

984
01:19:09,683 --> 01:19:12,652
- You are a medic. Do you
know what this is for?
- Yes, sir.

985
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,416
It's used in case of a severe attack
of angina pectoris. A heart disease, sir.

986
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:20,721
Pretty good. Well, then you know
what's wrong with me.

987
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:24,127
Unfortunately, I had to send my orderly
to Darmstadt to get more of this stuff.

988
01:19:24,197 --> 01:19:28,793
<i>As you see by the prescription,</i>
<i>it's important that in case of an attack...</i>

989
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:31,928
the dose be exactly one c.c.
And be given immediately.

990
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:35,998
<i>- An overdose or a delay can be fatal.</i>
- Yes, sir. I can see that.

991
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:39,568
Well, that will be all
for the moment.

992
01:19:42,315 --> 01:19:44,579
You better make yourself comfortable.

993
01:19:44,651 --> 01:19:47,745
You will be here for a while.

994
01:20:00,266 --> 01:20:03,531
Would <i>Herr Oberst</i> like me
to serve his dinner now?

995
01:20:03,603 --> 01:20:06,970
I had hoped you wouldn't
remind me of it.

996
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,272
But I suppose a man has to eat,
even when he has no appetite.

997
01:20:11,344 --> 01:20:14,177
- Put some blankets on the windows.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

998
01:20:16,349 --> 01:20:19,155
<i>Hartmann.</i>

999
01:20:21,124 --> 01:20:23,820
<i>And there's a candle on my desk.</i>
<i>Bring it here, please.</i>

1000
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:30,933
- At your orders, <i>Herr Oberst.</i>
- About our forward echelon, have they left?

1001
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,561
Two battalions of the 21st
started for Mannheim an hour ago, sir.

1002
01:20:34,637 --> 01:20:37,197
- The Fifth will be starting in the morning.
- Fine.

1003
01:20:37,273 --> 01:20:39,764
Will you be sure to remind
the commanding officers...

1004
01:20:39,842 --> 01:20:42,072
that despite their being
in General Jaegers area...

1005
01:20:42,145 --> 01:20:44,636
- they are still under my direct command.
- Yes, sir.

1006
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,114
And that they will not take orders
from anyone but me.

1007
01:20:47,183 --> 01:20:52,246
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to bother you, sir,
but about the deserter.

1008
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:54,653
<i>Have you signed the order</i>
<i>for his execution?</i>

1009
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:57,488
<i>No, I have not.</i>
<i>Thank you, Hartmann.</i>

1010
01:20:59,295 --> 01:21:03,288
- There's a bottle of
Niersteiner in the locker.
- Yes, sir.

1011
01:21:03,366 --> 01:21:08,201
And there must be another glass
around here. There by the window.

1012
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:19,641
I don't enjoy
drinking wine by myself.

1013
01:21:19,715 --> 01:21:22,343
I don't care for any,
unless <i>Herr Oberst</i> insists.

1014
01:21:22,418 --> 01:21:24,511
I do insist.

1015
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,490
Furthermore, you needn't stand
at attention all the time.

1016
01:21:33,563 --> 01:21:36,157
And for heaven's sake,
stop addressing me in the third person.

1017
01:21:36,232 --> 01:21:38,291
Yes, sir.

1018
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:41,928
Go ahead. Don't make me
repeat things.

1019
01:21:43,506 --> 01:21:45,940
Not bad.

1020
01:21:46,008 --> 01:21:48,704
Does <i>Herr Oberst</i>- Uh, do you
wish anything else, sir?

1021
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,939
Nothing.

1022
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:53,174
There's an extra blanket
on my bed.

1023
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:55,979
You can go to sleep as soon
as you have cleared the table.

1024
01:21:56,052 --> 01:21:58,384
Yes, sir.

1025
01:22:12,635 --> 01:22:15,001
<i>Corporal?</i>

1026
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:17,904
- Yes, sir?
<i>- I want to be awakened at 6:00.</i>

1027
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:20,875
Yes, sir.

1028
01:22:20,943 --> 01:22:24,208
Shall I clean your pistol before
I put it back into your holster, sir?

1029
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,612
<i>No, you put it next to my bed.</i>

1030
01:22:30,453 --> 01:22:33,320
- I want it here.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:22:39,262 --> 01:22:41,856
And, uh, by the way...

1032
01:22:41,931 --> 01:22:46,561
don't forget to remind me in the morning
to sign the order of the execution.

1033
01:22:48,237 --> 01:22:53,869
- Yes, sir.
- Here. I said you can take these blankets.

1034
01:22:53,943 --> 01:22:56,104
Thank you, sir.

1035
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,777
- Shall I turn the lamp off?
<i>- Just turn it down a little.</i>

1036
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:28,704
<i>Are you there, Corporal?</i>

1037
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:30,939
Yes, sir. I'm here.

1038
01:23:31,013 --> 01:23:34,210
Good night.

1039
01:23:34,283 --> 01:23:36,843
Good night, sir.

1040
01:23:51,634 --> 01:23:54,626
<i>Two battalions of the 21st to Mannheim.</i>

1041
01:23:54,704 --> 01:23:57,434
<i>The Fifth starts in the morning.</i>

1042
01:23:57,506 --> 01:24:00,236
<i>You will be here for a while.</i>

1043
01:24:00,309 --> 01:24:04,336
<i> Get back here, Happy.</i>
<i>Get back here in five days.</i>

1044
01:24:04,413 --> 01:24:06,506
<i>In case of an attack...</i>

1045
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:09,073
<i>an overdose or a delay can be fatal.</i>

1046
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:47,146
<i>Please.</i>

1047
01:24:47,223 --> 01:24:50,215
I beg you. I-

1048
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:54,195
<i>Please. Please.</i>

1049
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:25,652
- Is <i>Herr Oberst</i> awake?
- No, sir. I don't think so.

1050
01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:35,829
- Shh.
- Is he up?

1051
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:37,998
No, sir.
He had a very bad night.

1052
01:25:38,074 --> 01:25:41,168
<i>- What is it?</i>
- It's me, sir. Hartmann.

1053
01:25:41,243 --> 01:25:44,838
<i>- I have the morning report for you, sir.</i>
- Give it to the corporal.

1054
01:25:44,914 --> 01:25:48,748
- I'll be ready for you in half an hour.
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:25:52,288 --> 01:25:54,415
What time is it?

1056
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:57,823
- A few minutes past 6:00, sir.
- Help me.

1057
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:04,596
Hm. You know,
I had a dream.

1058
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:10,003
I dreamt you were the deserter I sentenced
and that you wanted to shoot me.

1059
01:26:11,974 --> 01:26:15,410
I had forgotten that people
like that are too weak.

1060
01:26:15,478 --> 01:26:18,311
They would never have
the courage to kill...

1061
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:20,611
even if it is
to save themselves.

1062
01:26:20,683 --> 01:26:24,244
Sometimes it takes
more courage not to kill.

1063
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,756
I would have preferred you
I had not answered me in that way.

1064
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:30,758
But you just saved my life,
whatever that's worth.

1065
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:33,727
And so, instead of punishing you,
I would like to do something for you.

1066
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:36,924
I would suggest that <i>Herr Oberst</i>
remain quiet and not exert himself, sir.

1067
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:39,763
- The third person again, Corporal.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1068
01:26:39,835 --> 01:26:44,067
How about a week's leave at home, hmm?
Would that suit you?

1069
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:48,440
Thank you, sir.
I have my duty at the front.

1070
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:52,277
- There's only one thing, however.
- Yes. What is it?

1071
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:54,646
Maybe it's foolish of me...

1072
01:26:54,717 --> 01:26:59,017
but if you would have mercy on the deserter
and put him in prison instead.

1073
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:04,151
Corporal, your profession
is to save lives, even the unworthy.

1074
01:27:04,226 --> 01:27:07,252
Well, mine is to take it,
even the worthy.

1075
01:27:07,329 --> 01:27:12,028
I know that it is insane to claim that we
can throw back the enemy that surround us.

1076
01:27:12,101 --> 01:27:16,003
But in one hour, in front of the officers
of my division, I will claim just that.

1077
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:18,801
<i>I'll do so because it is my belief...</i>

1078
01:27:18,874 --> 01:27:21,001
that at all costs
we must fight to the bitter end.

1079
01:27:21,076 --> 01:27:23,510
That is the reason why,
now more than ever...

1080
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:26,104
<i>I must maintain the discipline</i>
<i>of my division.</i>

1081
01:27:26,182 --> 01:27:28,742
And that is the reason
why this man must die.

1082
01:27:31,253 --> 01:27:33,346
Adjutant.

1083
01:27:33,422 --> 01:27:37,620
Give me some wine. Those pills,
they always make me thirsty.

1084
01:27:37,693 --> 01:27:41,129
- Shall I bring you a glass of water, sir?
- I hate water.

1085
01:27:41,197 --> 01:27:43,461
This is Von Ecker.

1086
01:27:43,532 --> 01:27:46,968
The medic you sent me yesterday, Corporal-
Uh, what's your name again?

1087
01:27:47,036 --> 01:27:49,834
<i>- Corporal Steiner, sir.</i>
- Steiner. Corporal Steiner.

1088
01:27:49,905 --> 01:27:54,865
I want him forwarded on to his unit
by the first available transportation.

1089
01:27:54,944 --> 01:27:59,176
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

1090
01:27:59,248 --> 01:28:02,046
- Yes. Thank you, sir.
- All right.

1091
01:28:05,554 --> 01:28:07,852
To our country.

1092
01:28:07,923 --> 01:28:10,118
To our country.

1093
01:28:59,341 --> 01:29:02,435
<i>- Bridge is out.</i>
<i>- Get the men off the trucks, quick!</i>

1094
01:29:02,511 --> 01:29:05,605
Yes, sir.
Everybody off the trucks!

1095
01:29:05,681 --> 01:29:07,945
The bridge is out!
You'll have to cross on foot!

1096
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:10,417
Come on! Everybody out!
Line up in column of threes!

1097
01:29:10,486 --> 01:29:13,216
<i>- Hurry up!</i>
<i>- Everybody out! We'll cross on foot!</i>

1098
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:15,655
Everybody off the trucks!
The bridge is out!

1099
01:29:15,724 --> 01:29:18,249
- We'll have to cross on foot!
- Come on! Everybody out!

1100
01:29:18,327 --> 01:29:20,488
Line up in column of threes!
Hurry up!

1101
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:23,054
<i>Everybody out!</i>
<i>We cross on foot!</i>

1102
01:29:23,132 --> 01:29:26,590
<i>Everybody out of the trucks!</i>
<i>Drivers start as soon as you've unloaded!</i>

1103
01:29:26,669 --> 01:29:30,332
My glasses. I've lost my glasses.
I- I can't see without them.

1104
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:33,341
<i>- Get over there.</i>
- Here they are.

1105
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:35,741
Ah.

1106
01:29:35,811 --> 01:29:38,905
It was very kind of you
to help me.

1107
01:29:38,981 --> 01:29:42,849
Huh. My name is Brandenbacher.
Ernst Brandenbacher.

1108
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:46,183
Most people call me Ernst.
It's easier.

1109
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:48,815
- We'd better get going.
<i>- We'll reload on the other side.</i>

1110
01:29:48,891 --> 01:29:52,190
<i>- Come on! Hurry up!</i>
<i>- Everybody remember</i>
<i>the number of the truck!</i>

1111
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:54,354
<i>- Reload on the other side!</i>
<i>- Enemy planes!</i>

1112
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,524
<i>The Amis are coming!</i>
<i>Take cover! Quickly! Cover!</i>

1113
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:21,082
Help me, please!
Somebody! Help!

1114
01:30:46,615 --> 01:30:50,176
Ah. They got me!
But you won't get away, Steiner.

1115
01:30:50,252 --> 01:30:52,584
<i>By now they know</i>
<i>all about you everywhere.</i>

1116
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:56,182
We could have taken you a long
time ago, but I hoped that you
would lead me to the others.

1117
01:30:56,258 --> 01:30:58,249
I hoped to get all of you.

1118
01:32:22,478 --> 01:32:24,844
The rest of the bridges,
were blown up this morning.

1119
01:32:24,913 --> 01:32:26,972
This seems to be
the last one in Mannheim.

1120
01:32:27,049 --> 01:32:29,279
I'll bet it won't be long
before this one goes too.

1121
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:31,979
- I heard the Americans are in Landau.
- So what? Are you afraid?

1122
01:32:32,054 --> 01:32:34,522
Better get your papers out.
Here comes another spot check.

1123
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:37,457
<i>Spot check.</i>
<i>They better call it "grave registration."</i>

1124
01:32:37,526 --> 01:32:40,427
<i>Today they take your name.</i>
<i>Tomorrow they notify your mother.</i>

1125
01:32:40,496 --> 01:32:42,862
- Oh, keep quiet.
<i>- Gunther, Alois</i>- Gefreiter.

1126
01:32:42,931 --> 01:32:46,594
<i>- All right.</i>
- Schaus, Herbert<i>- Obergefreiter.</i>

1127
01:32:46,668 --> 01:32:48,966
- Go ahead.
- Bachschmidt, Hans<i>- Kanonier.</i>

1128
01:32:49,037 --> 01:32:51,267
- Mm-hmm.
- Schmidt, Albert<i>- Unteroffizier.</i>

1129
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:55,208
- All right.
<i>- Rothmann, Klaus- Obergefreiter.</i>

1130
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:59,611
<i>- Go on.</i>
<i>- Lachner, Gert-Schütze.</i>

1131
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:03,310
<i>Myer, Billie</i>-
Sturmführer.

1132
01:33:03,385 --> 01:33:05,819
<i>Schindler, Johannes</i>-
Pionier.

1133
01:33:05,888 --> 01:33:09,688
- All right.
<i>- Soldbuch</i> and travel orders.

1134
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:13,489
I lost them in an air attack this morning.
I'm on my way to my unit in Neustadt.

1135
01:33:13,562 --> 01:33:17,965
You lost them and not a scratch on you,
huh? Take him back to the checkpoint.

1136
01:33:18,033 --> 01:33:22,470
- They'll find out
what happened to his papers.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

1137
01:33:22,538 --> 01:33:26,338
Call the Mannheim side. Ask them
if we should stop the traffic. Next.

1138
01:33:29,745 --> 01:33:32,407
Come on. Keep going.

1139
01:33:36,118 --> 01:33:38,211
Wait here.

1140
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:40,414
You said they found
an American leaflet on you?

1141
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:42,582
Yes. You'd think I committed
a crime, that I was-

1142
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:44,888
- No talking!
<i>- Here's the man.</i>

1143
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,021
- What's your name?
- Maurer, Karl.

1144
01:33:49,097 --> 01:33:52,225
- I was told you lost your papers, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:00,767
- You said your name is Karl Maurer?
- Yes, but that's just-

1146
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:03,607
I know. I know. Get over there.
Keep an eye on him.

1147
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,840
Come on. Get back.

1148
01:34:19,027 --> 01:34:21,359
<i>Stop!</i>

1149
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:24,024
<i>Cut him off from the other side</i>
<i>of the railroad bridge.</i>

1150
01:34:57,866 --> 01:35:01,233
The Mannheim
Central <i>Kommandatur</i> has just
received information...

1151
01:35:01,303 --> 01:35:04,067
that a man suspected of being
a dangerous enemy saboteur...

1152
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:08,701
<i>escaped a few hours ago from the Wehrmacht</i>
<i>control point at the main Rhine bridge.</i>

1153
01:35:08,777 --> 01:35:11,871
<i>He is wearing the uniform</i>
<i>of a corporal in the Luftwaffe.</i>

1154
01:35:11,947 --> 01:35:14,142
<i>He is about 20 years of age.</i>

1155
01:35:14,216 --> 01:35:19,153
<i>His appearance is slender,</i>
<i>average height, blonde, fair complexion.</i>

1156
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:25,182
<i>As last seen, he wore a Red Cross arm band</i>
<i>on his left arm, a pistol belt and boots.</i>

1157
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:29,526
<i>- He identifies himself as</i>-
<i>- Hey, soldier!</i>
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

1158
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:31,828
Hey, we are talking to you.

1159
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:37,202
<i>- What's the matter,</i>
<i>are you deaf or something?</i>
- Come on, let's see your papers.

1160
01:35:37,272 --> 01:35:39,570
- Halt!
- Halt!

1161
01:35:52,687 --> 01:35:55,155
Come on. Over here.

1162
01:36:15,277 --> 01:36:18,405
<i>This way.</i>

1163
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,471
<i>Where are the others?</i>

1164
01:36:20,549 --> 01:36:23,143
<i> They went around</i>
<i>the front of the building.</i>

1165
01:36:23,218 --> 01:36:25,618
- Anyone there?
- He must be here somewhere.

1166
01:36:25,687 --> 01:36:27,882
Yes, I'm sure I saw him
running this way.

1167
01:36:27,956 --> 01:36:30,424
Lucky they didn't hit
this place during a show.

1168
01:36:30,492 --> 01:36:33,052
<i>How about it?</i>
<i>He's not here.</i>

1169
01:36:33,128 --> 01:36:38,930
- Go on! Keep looking!
<i>- Hey, we better get out before</i>
<i>the whole place collapses.</i>

1170
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,629
<i>Watch it. The floor's full of holes.</i>

1171
01:36:42,704 --> 01:36:45,229
- Hey, look what I found.
<i>- Where?</i>

1172
01:36:45,307 --> 01:36:47,935
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- What happened?</i>

1173
01:36:48,009 --> 01:36:51,809
- What are you doing there?
- Fritz found a string of pearls.
Looks like real stuff.

1174
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,110
Remember, this used
to be a theater.

1175
01:36:54,182 --> 01:36:56,776
He's probably found Aida's
necklace or something.

1176
01:37:00,388 --> 01:37:03,357
- Here they come again.
- Let's get out of here, quick!

1177
01:37:03,425 --> 01:37:06,087
Well, go on. It's starting again.

1178
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:47,699
Neckarstrasse.
Neckarstrasse.

1179
01:37:59,547 --> 01:38:01,811
<i>Fraulein.</i>

1180
01:38:01,883 --> 01:38:05,751
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be out,
but my child got hurt by flying glass.

1181
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:10,223
I have to get some iodine. Don't turn
me in, please. Here, I have money.

1182
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:14,319
Here, some iodine and bandages.
You better get off the street now.

1183
01:38:14,396 --> 01:38:18,594
Believe me, it's only because of my child.
You're not going to turn me in, please.
You promise?

1184
01:38:18,667 --> 01:38:21,067
I promise. Don't be afraid.
Go ahead now.

1185
01:38:21,136 --> 01:38:23,229
God bless you.

1186
01:38:23,305 --> 01:38:28,072
Uh, just a moment.
I'm looking for Neckarstrasse 18.

1187
01:38:28,143 --> 01:38:31,442
- It's the second street to the right.
- Thank you.

1188
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:58,430
- Tiger.
- What are you doing here?

1189
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,798
I had to come.
They're after me.

1190
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,201
They're after you?
And you lead them here, you idiot?

1191
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:05,330
Nobody followed me,
I promise you.

1192
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:07,875
- There is a message that
we must send right away.
- What is it?

1193
01:40:07,942 --> 01:40:12,276
- I found the location of the
11th Panzer Corps. They are-
- Where are they?

1194
01:40:12,347 --> 01:40:14,338
I want to see Lieutenant Rennick.

1195
01:40:14,416 --> 01:40:17,010
I'm not important enough
for you, huh?

1196
01:40:17,085 --> 01:40:20,384
Come on, let's hear it, <i>Junge.</i>
I said talk.

1197
01:40:20,455 --> 01:40:24,357
- Who is it, Tiger?
- We have a guest, Lieutenant.

1198
01:40:24,426 --> 01:40:27,190
Go ahead.

1199
01:40:27,262 --> 01:40:31,289
- I know I'm not supposed to come here,
but I spent last night-
- Get inside.

1200
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:42,798
- Where did you get this address?
- I heard Tiger give it to you on the plane.

1201
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:45,668
I was trying to get across the Rhine
when they nearly caught me.

1202
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:48,903
- My name is on the blacklist.
- That helps a lot.

1203
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:52,309
- Now why'd you come here?
- I have some very important
information to send.

1204
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:55,349
- I knew you had the radio. That's why I came.
- I'm afraid you're too late.

1205
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,816
We had a near miss.
The concussion damaged the transmitter.

1206
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:02,151
- I haven't been able to make contact since.
- We will have to do something.

1207
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:07,525
You know what will happen
if he falls into their hands.

1208
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:23,967
He's all right.

1209
01:41:24,045 --> 01:41:26,172
What's the word
from General Jaeger?

1210
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:30,013
General Jaeger and two members of his staff
were gravely wounded this morning...

1211
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,985
<i>while on a routine inspection tour</i>
<i>of the front.</i>

1212
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:36,080
Here. You can read it yourself.

1213
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:39,388
We tried to contact the general
at the hospital in Heidelberg where he is...

1214
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,485
or is supposed to be.

1215
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:43,996
- It was impossible.
- Impossible? Why?

1216
01:41:44,065 --> 01:41:46,056
The hospital is under heavy S.S. Guards.

1217
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:48,533
No one is allowed to enter
without special permission.

1218
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:51,231
You mean to imply
the whole story may be a fake?

1219
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:55,742
We have often encountered
worse fakes than this.

1220
01:41:57,912 --> 01:42:00,608
Well, what do you propose to do?

1221
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:05,015
What about yourself and all the other officers?
You plan to carry out the agreement?

1222
01:42:05,086 --> 01:42:09,455
I am afraid without the general
we have no power over the troops.
It's too much of a risk.

1223
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:13,687
A great many lives are at stake,
Germans as well as Americans.
Isn't it worth taking the risk?

1224
01:42:16,097 --> 01:42:20,693
I'm sorry, but I can't.
And I'm sure the others feel as I do.

1225
01:42:20,768 --> 01:42:24,534
The lives of our families and our friends
are involved. Besides, now it's all too late.

1226
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:27,768
- We should have acted a long time ago.
- Yeah, but then it was too early.

1227
01:42:27,842 --> 01:42:32,108
You always wanted to get rid of them,
but were never willing to
take a chance or responsibility.

1228
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:37,276
Why? Because you wanted to hang on
to your ranks, your titles, your jobs.

1229
01:42:37,351 --> 01:42:41,253
And today, when you could still save
the most important thing of all-your souls-

1230
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:43,313
you haven't got the guts to do it.

1231
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:47,225
They're right to call you traitors,
because you've betrayed yourselves.

1232
01:42:51,699 --> 01:42:54,395
There is only one way
I can answer you, Lieutenant.

1233
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:57,960
It's all very easy for you to say,
but you were never in our shoes.

1234
01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:01,907
That's true.
And I hope we never will be.

1235
01:43:01,976 --> 01:43:04,035
Okay.

1236
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:15,818
What are you going to do, Lieutenant?

1237
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:19,519
Get out of here fast,
before one of the gentlemen starts to talk.

1238
01:43:22,096 --> 01:43:26,089
I guess it's all right.
Nobody followed him.

1239
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:29,603
Was the surrender planned
for this sector, Lieutenant?

1240
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:31,661
Yeah. Why?

1241
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:34,469
I spent last night at the headquarters
of the 11th Panzer Corps.

1242
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,534
Two of their regiments moved
into position this morning- here...

1243
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:40,273
on both flanks
of General Jaegers troops.

1244
01:43:40,348 --> 01:43:44,785
Looks like we're walkin' right into a trap.
We gotta get back, Tiger, as quick as we can.

1245
01:43:44,852 --> 01:43:48,344
But how can we make it, sir?
You heard him. He nearly got caught himself.

1246
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:54,527
It must be the Rhine bridge.

1247
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:58,292
- I saw them placing the charges.
<i>- There goes our last chance.</i>

1248
01:43:58,366 --> 01:44:02,860
- Is there any other way to get across?
- Sure, if you want to swim.

1249
01:44:02,937 --> 01:44:05,235
All right.
What's the best place to try it?

1250
01:44:05,306 --> 01:44:09,640
Swim? You're not serious.
Every inch of the shore is fortified.

1251
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:13,737
Even if you get past <i>Zement</i>-
past your own artillery fire-
we'd freeze in the icy water.

1252
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:16,715
Well, we can try.
One of us is sure to get through.

1253
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:20,845
Well, if you're so brave,
why didn't you do it before?

1254
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,856
Besides, how do we know
he didn't make the whole thing up?

1255
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:26,893
How do we know he's telling the truth?
Maybe he's just trying-

1256
01:44:26,961 --> 01:44:29,054
Shut up.

1257
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:35,498
Get the extra travel orders out
and the date stamp. Now go ahead, Happy.

1258
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:39,164
I want you to brief us on every place
you've been, everything you've seen.

1259
01:44:56,424 --> 01:44:59,018
I have a sister-in-law
who lives on the third floor.

1260
01:44:59,093 --> 01:45:03,029
- From there we can get
a good view of the river.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1261
01:45:18,946 --> 01:45:23,610
This is it.

1262
01:45:25,553 --> 01:45:27,578
- My mother isn't here.
- That's all right.

1263
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:29,714
We'll wait for her. Go ahead.

1264
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:35,158
- You're Uncle Rudolph, aren't you?
- That's right.

1265
01:45:35,229 --> 01:45:37,390
My mother said
she'd be back in an hour.

1266
01:45:37,465 --> 01:45:40,059
But if you can't wait,
it's all right to go to Gottfried's house.

1267
01:45:40,134 --> 01:45:42,227
Thanks, Kurt.

1268
01:45:44,138 --> 01:45:46,333
<i>If you are soldiers,</i>
<i>why aren't you at the front?</i>

1269
01:45:46,407 --> 01:45:48,841
We just came from there, <i>Junge.</i>
We're on leave.

1270
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:53,676
- Why doesn't my father get leave?
He hasn't been home for a year.
- We will talk about that later.

1271
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:57,308
Right now I want you to wait
in there until your mother comes back.

1272
01:45:57,384 --> 01:45:59,477
This way.

1273
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:02,946
What was that about Gottfried?

1274
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:06,254
He's a friend of mine.
Lives about a mile from here.

1275
01:46:06,327 --> 01:46:10,093
I made arrangements with him
in case we need a place to stay over.

1276
01:46:10,164 --> 01:46:14,362
I thought we came here to decide
on the best spot to cross the river.

1277
01:46:14,435 --> 01:46:17,836
- I have made up my mind. I am not going.
- What?

1278
01:46:17,905 --> 01:46:21,602
Sure. It's all right for you to take
that kind of a chance. But me and him?

1279
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:24,269
When it's all over,
our own people will spit in our faces.

1280
01:46:24,345 --> 01:46:26,836
And you?
You will say thank you and fly home.

1281
01:46:26,914 --> 01:46:30,543
Then why did you take this job?
Why did you join them in the first place?

1282
01:46:30,618 --> 01:46:33,143
Because I wanted to live a little better,
not to get killed.

1283
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:36,212
And if you will be honest with yourself,
you did it for the same reason.

1284
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:38,315
I did it because I wanted
to help my country.

1285
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,952
- Ah.
- And now, more than ever, I'm
sure that what I did was right.

1286
01:46:41,028 --> 01:46:45,397
<i>Well, isn't it noble of him?</i>
<i>Who are you fooling?</i>
<i>Do you think anybody will believe you?</i>

1287
01:46:45,466 --> 01:46:48,526
<i> It doesn't matter.</i>
<i>I don't expect them to.</i>
<i>Besides, it isn't important.</i>

1288
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:52,663
<i>- The important thing is what we believe in.</i>
- Knock it off, both of ya.

1289
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:56,039
I don't care why you did it.
You're in this now,
and neither of you is backing out.

1290
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:59,568
You better get that through your head,
Tiger. You know too much to be left behind.

1291
01:46:59,647 --> 01:47:02,115
I didn't mean it that way.

1292
01:47:06,287 --> 01:47:08,380
He must have heard everything,
the little brat.

1293
01:47:08,455 --> 01:47:11,322
You look downstairs.
I'll see if he's hiding here.

1294
01:47:18,799 --> 01:47:21,632
You watch for him below.
I'll look around on this floor.

1295
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:30,409
- You little swine!
- Ow! Let me- Ow! Let me-

1296
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:32,775
- Let me go!
<i>- Let him go!</i>
- Little swine!

1297
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:37,613
You'll kill him! Let him go. Stop it!
Don't you see he's only a kid?
Let him go, I said.

1298
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:41,678
Are you crazy? You'll-
Happy! Stop him, quick!

1299
01:47:47,828 --> 01:47:51,423
Too late! He's reporting us.

1300
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,933
Hey, come on.

1301
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:08,637
To the left. Didn't you see them?
They've gone in that direction.

1302
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:40,078
They're comin' around
on this side.

1303
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:42,206
Take cover over here!
Quick!

1304
01:48:53,327 --> 01:48:55,318
This way, sir.

1305
01:48:55,396 --> 01:48:58,297
<i> Hey, Berger, Fritz,</i>
<i>take two men-</i>

1306
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,459
<i>The rest come with me.</i>

1307
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:04,698
I saw them sir. I'm sure
they must be here. Three of them.

1308
01:49:04,772 --> 01:49:08,037
All right. All right, <i>Junge.</i> Hey, Berger,
take four men around the back.

1309
01:49:08,108 --> 01:49:10,269
We'll cover it from this side.

1310
01:49:10,344 --> 01:49:12,835
- And now you must stay here.
- But I want to go with you.

1311
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:15,006
Stay here, I said.

1312
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:25,788
<i>- You men, over here. Fritz, take</i>
<i>a look at that tunnel there.</i>
<i>- Right away, sir.</i>

1313
01:49:31,765 --> 01:49:37,601
<i> You can hardly see anything.</i>

1314
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:41,903
<i> Get all the ones on your left,</i>
<i>behind those bricks.</i>

1315
01:49:57,091 --> 01:49:59,582
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>in the courtyard, sir.</i>

1316
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:03,426
<i> There's a staircase going down</i>
<i>to the cellar. Over here, Fritz.</i>

1317
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,934
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1318
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:19,536
He probably made the whole thing up, Max,
right from the start.

1319
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,604
I suppose you're right.

1320
01:50:21,682 --> 01:50:24,173
- Call your men. We'd better get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

1321
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:28,347
<i>- All right, then. Everybody out this way.</i>
- Hey, Berger, let's get going!

1322
01:50:45,606 --> 01:50:50,441
<i>- Hey, Gerhardt,</i>
<i>get your men together.</i>
<i>- All men report to the vehicles.</i>

1323
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:54,038
<i> Come on, Fritz.</i>
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

1324
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:57,049
<i>Hey, Richter,</i>
<i>tell them we can go.</i>

1325
01:50:57,117 --> 01:50:59,176
<i>All right. All right.</i>

1326
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:25,906
Keep goin'! I said, keep goin'!

1327
01:51:34,755 --> 01:51:36,848
See if you can
get over the side here.

1328
01:51:54,575 --> 01:51:56,941
Tiger, you'll go first.
Happy, you follow.

1329
01:51:57,010 --> 01:52:00,878
If it's too tough to get all the way across,
we make for the island.

1330
01:52:00,948 --> 01:52:03,712
What's the matter with you, Tiger?
Get ready!

1331
01:52:13,527 --> 01:52:15,586
Let's get outta here, quick!

1332
01:52:17,264 --> 01:52:19,528
<i> Hey, what was that?</i>
<i>I saw something.</i>

1333
01:52:21,368 --> 01:52:23,563
Hey, there's a man lying down here.

1334
01:52:23,637 --> 01:52:26,037
Run!

1335
01:52:46,627 --> 01:52:51,064
<i>My legs- I can't move them. My le-</i>

1336
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:57,601
Hang on to me.
We'll try to make it to the island.

1337
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:15,012
Get down.

1338
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:32,636
- I had a cramp. I will be all right.
- Okay.

1339
01:53:40,347 --> 01:53:44,215
It looks like only couple
of hundred feet to the other shore.

1340
01:53:44,284 --> 01:53:48,084
- Think-Think you can make it?
- I will try. I'm sure I can-

1341
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:51,056
All right.
Just take it easy for a minute.

1342
01:53:51,124 --> 01:53:54,582
In case something happens to me,
have you got everything straight?

1343
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,754
I've got it all. Don't worry.

1344
01:53:56,830 --> 01:54:00,163
Do you remember
the Würzburg target, sir?

1345
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:03,134
- That... chemical plant
they moved in from East Prussia?

1346
01:54:03,203 --> 01:54:05,967
Is that very important?

1347
01:54:06,039 --> 01:54:08,837
- Do you think they will bomb it?
- Well, I hope so. Why?

1348
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:12,902
I found out that my father was transferred...

1349
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:17,417
- from the hospital in Berlin, and-just-
- And what?

1350
01:54:19,152 --> 01:54:22,280
He's stationed in Würzburg now.

1351
01:54:22,356 --> 01:54:25,382
The hospital is next to the factory.

1352
01:54:27,394 --> 01:54:30,124
- Think you can make it now?
- I think I can.

1353
01:54:30,197 --> 01:54:33,655
Ready? Come on!

1354
01:54:57,924 --> 01:55:00,017
<i>Hey, Krohner, take the second</i>
<i>and third platoon...</i>

1355
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:02,687
- and spread them out ten meters
apart along this side.
- Yes, sir.

1356
01:55:02,763 --> 01:55:05,027
- Victor, take over the first platoon.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1357
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:09,057
<i>You will remain over here. Everyone</i>
<i>watch out for any men or enemy crossing.</i>

1358
01:55:09,136 --> 01:55:12,003
<i>- As you ordered, sir.</i>
<i>- Hans, get the first platoon ready. Quick.</i>

1359
01:55:12,072 --> 01:55:15,974
<i>- Right away, sir.</i>
<i>- All men of second</i>
<i>and third platoon come with me.</i>

1360
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:23,543
We'll have to wait.
They'll put down one more strand.

1361
01:55:23,617 --> 01:55:27,075
If the cramp starts again,
hang on to my shirt.

1362
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:48,101
<i>- Halt! Halt! Who's there?</i>
<i>- Come on! Come on!</i>

1363
01:55:48,175 --> 01:55:53,511
- Who's there? Come out at once, or we'll fire.
<i>- Go ahead, Lieutenant.</i>

1364
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:55,571
I can't make it anyhow.

1365
01:55:59,486 --> 01:56:03,513
Stop firing!

1366
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,581
<i>- Stop firing!</i>
- Hold it! Hold it!

1367
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,626
- Get him! Get him, quick!
<i>- Hey, you, over there!</i>

1368
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:17,932
<i>Stop him. Don't let him get away!</i>

1369
01:56:25,779 --> 01:56:30,273
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Are you going to talk or not?

1370
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:34,616
Ten seconds
to make up your mind.

1371
01:56:57,377 --> 01:56:59,470
Hey, there's someone
moving out there.

1372
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:05,847
Knock it off, you jerks! Knock it off!

1373
01:57:05,919 --> 01:57:09,787
- Hold your fire. Sounds like one of our guys.
- What's he doin' out there?

1374
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,347
Beats me.
Just keep him covered.

1375
01:57:21,001 --> 01:57:24,459
<i>Twenty-first and Fifth Panzer. That's right.</i>
<i>They moved into Mannheim yesterday.</i>

1376
01:57:24,538 --> 01:57:26,870
<i>One regiment along the southern</i>
<i>boundary near Neckaran...</i>

1377
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:28,965
other about three kilometers
north of there.

1378
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:32,910
WM-1967 on
the Darmstadt-Mannheim sheet.

1379
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:38,815
<i>Okay? Yes, I'll send a detailed report</i>
<i>over within an hour. What?</i>

1380
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:43,822
Well, they must have been
asleep at the switch up there.
Well, anyway, it's good news.

1381
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:47,690
All right. Bye. First Army beat us to it again.
They found a bridge the Germans forgot...

1382
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:50,992
to blow at Remagen, and they're pouring
into Germany like an Army Day parade.

1383
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:53,726
I'd be happy to give Berlin to the First,
if it'd get me home sooner.

1384
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,394
- Good news, huh, Rennick?
- Hmm?

1385
01:57:56,469 --> 01:58:00,200
- Oh. Fine, sir.
- Got a cigarette, Pete?

1386
01:58:00,273 --> 01:58:04,209
Look, I know how you feel.
There isn't much you can do about it.

1387
01:58:04,277 --> 01:58:06,507
A kid like Happy,
even if he came through it alive...

1388
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:09,140
a traitor's always a traitor,
no matter what his reasons are.

1389
01:58:09,216 --> 01:58:11,207
We didn't hesitate
about using him.

1390
01:58:11,284 --> 01:58:14,344
In a war, to save lives,
you use whoever you can.

1391
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:18,585
Trouble is, you always lose the best ones,
'cause the best ones
are willing to take a chance.

1392
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:20,683
You better get some rest.
It'll do ya good.

1393
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,853
- Siebert, get me Cadet Forward.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1394
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:26,831
Come on, hero, straighten up.
You oughta be grateful you're alive.

1395
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:29,061
Don't worry. I am.

1396
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:33,333
<i>Cadet Forward?</i>
<i>Hold on just a minute, please.</i>

1397
01:58:33,406 --> 01:58:35,840
Griffin-

1398
01:58:35,909 --> 01:58:38,070
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>
- You're staying on with the old man.

1399
01:58:38,144 --> 01:58:41,910
Take It. Rennick to the convent. All
kidding aside, Dick, take it easy for a while.

1400
01:58:41,982 --> 01:58:44,007
- I will, Pete.
- I'll see you later.

1401
01:58:44,084 --> 01:58:46,382
- Sure glad to have you back, Lieutenant.
- Thanks.

1402
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:51,288
Hey, you better put this on. You're pretty
lucky, sir. Too bad about the kid.

1403
01:58:51,358 --> 01:58:54,452
- Huh?
- I mean Happy.

1404
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:57,690
- Yeah.
- Well, I guess it's no good thinkin' about it.

1405
01:58:57,764 --> 01:59:00,460
After all, he was
just another Kraut.

1406
01:59:07,274 --> 01:59:10,107
<i> A man stays alive</i>
<i>as long as he's remembered...</i>

1407
01:59:10,176 --> 01:59:13,043
<i>and is killed</i>
<i>only by forgetfulness.</i>

1408
01:59:13,113 --> 01:59:15,308
<i>So long, Happy.</i>

1409
01:59:15,382 --> 01:59:18,044
<i>Let your real name</i>
<i>remain unknown...</i>

1410
01:59:18,118 --> 01:59:23,317
<i>but let the memory of your sacrifice</i>
<i>serve as a key to the meanings of treason.</i>

1411
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:25,483
<i>It was to me.</i>
