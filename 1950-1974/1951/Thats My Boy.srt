1
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:02,735
<i>Stand up and cheer for Ridgeville</i>

2
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:06,214
<i>As we rout the foe</i>

3
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,907
<i>Strong and fearless</i>

4
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,817
Jack, you'd better hurry
if you want hot wheat cakes.

5
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:12,389
Coming, honey.

6
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:18,162
<i>Stand up and cheer for Ridgeville</i>

7
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:21,857
<i>As we rout the foe</i>

8
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,627
<i>Strong and fearless</i>

9
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:25,293
<i>Proud and peerless</i>

10
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:28,201
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

11
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:31,666
<i>Stand up and shout for Ridgeville</i>

12
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:34,472
<i>Hail the red and blue</i>

13
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:38,381
<i>We are here for</i>
<i>Here to cheer for</i>

14
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,077
<i>Ridgeville U

15
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:45,345
- One, two, up and do it.
- Jack, will you hurry, please?

16
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,390
Be right down in a minute, hon.
Keep those wheat cakes hot.

17
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:52,088
One, two, up and do it.

18
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,688
Jack.

19
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:56,130
One, two, up and do it.

20
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:57,701
Are you hurrying, dear?

21
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,771
Another 35 and I'll be right down, hon.

22
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,330
One, two...

23
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:07,042
Young Junior gonna have breakfast
with us, Miss Jackson?

24
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,407
I think so, May.

25
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:10,981
I hope he gets back
from the doctor's in time.

26
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,413
Not sick again?

27
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:15,418
Nothing serious.
Just his old trouble, his eyes.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,479
And what with this rainy weather,
his sinus has been none too good.

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,821
Oh, May,
we'll have to get rid of those flowers.

30
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:25,225
You know, Junior's hay fever.

31
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,126
Seems to me
like that boy's getting worse.

32
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,530
Not at all.
Junior's just had his share of bad luck.

33
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:33,800
After all, he's only a baby.
He'll outgrow it.

34
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,465
I don't know.
I've been in this house for 15 years.

35
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,098
He's sure taking his time.

36
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,303
We're not discussing
Junior's physical condition.

37
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,313
- Now let's check on those wheat cakes.
- Yes, ma'am.

38
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:49,346
Jack, will you please hurry?
Everything's getting cold.

39
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:50,921
Coming, honey!

40
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,051
Watch out below.

41
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,798
Jack!

42
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,131
Now, got a big kiss for your husband?

43
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:07,363
Just as soon as I catch my breath.

44
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,804
Breath? That's not the girl I married.

45
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:13,001
Since when does the former
Olympic women's swimming champ

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,839
- get out of breath?
- As of now.

47
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,004
You know, I'm ashamed of you, Ann.

48
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,274
I think you're getting old.
You're not the girl I married.

49
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:21,180
The girl you married wants you
to sit down and eat your breakfast.

50
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,344
The girl I married
was the greatest swimmer

51
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:27,481
to ever win in the Olympics,
and that was the day that I proposed.

52
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:31,486
Oh, you never change.
The perennial college boy.

53
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:33,928
Now sit down, and let's forget sports.

54
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,364
They belong in the scrapbooks,
and we sure have our share of them,

55
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,060
all neatly bound.

56
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,606
So, as we grow older,
we can sit before the fire and read them

57
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,971
and quietly disintegrate together.

58
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,010
I hate to grow old.

59
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,046
Well, I must say,
you're doing it rather gracefully.

60
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,172
I've never seen you
looking more attractive.

61
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,114
Pretty good shape for a man of 41.

62
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:56,846
Still could get out on that football field
at Ridgeville U,

63
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,649
and make those youngsters
watch their step.

64
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,156
Oh, no. Not Ridgeville U and football.

65
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,227
They just haven't had a team
up there in years, Ann.

66
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,818
The kids today just don't play
"guts" football.

67
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,558
Jack, Ridgeville is a small university.

68
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,796
You can't expect them to beat
a university like Southern California.

69
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,530
When you and I went to school
and I played quarterback,

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,005
we beat Southern California.

71
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,939
Oh, sit down, dear,
and eat your breakfast.

72
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,035
What a team we had that year. Oh, boy!

73
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:25,377
Bronco Clayton.
There was a fullback for you.

74
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,683
And Dusty Henrickson, an end.
Dynamite!

75
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,117
How do you want your eggs, dear?

76
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,883
Big Butch Gorky.
There never was a halfback like him.

77
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,617
How do you want your eggs,
Mr. Jackson?

78
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:37,592
And Pudgy Durkin, lightning fast.
We had a team that year, Ann.

79
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,959
I tell you, there'll never be football
like that again.

80
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,861
How do you want your eggs?

81
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:46,130
And in all due modesty, I must say
we'd have never beaten USC

82
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:48,535
without "Jarring" Jack Jackson.

83
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:52,237
You know, they don't make you
All-American on pull.

84
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:03,385
Didn't get that name
"Jarring" Jack for nothing.

85
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,354
None of this fancy-pantsy dodging
like the kids are doing today.

86
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,652
You hunched yourself,
and you hit the line hard,

87
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,750
and you didn't go down
because somebody grabbed you.

88
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,453
- You carried them with you, right?
- Right.

89
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,087
How do you want your eggs?

90
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:17,827
USC thought they had us.
You remember, hon?

91
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,800
The score was six to nothing,
one minute to go,

92
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,599
twenty yards,
and they thought we'd pass!

93
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,003
Jack, I asked you a question.

94
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:25,439
Let me explain it to you, hon,
so you'll see it for yourself.

95
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,477
Here was the play. Here.

96
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,437
You play Stubby Cochran's position,
center.

97
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:31,276
I don't want to play
Stubby Cochran's position!

98
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,646
He was a great center, Ann.
Almost made All-American.

99
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,844
- Now stay down there. May?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:37,011
You play end for USC.

101
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,749
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson.
I can't play end for USC.

102
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,154
The wheat cakes will get cold.

103
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,455
Well, maybe you're right. Play guard.
Play right off-center. That's it.

104
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,120
Stay down there, hon.

105
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,289
All right, now watch it, May.
I'm coming around your end.

106
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,731
But, Mr. Jackson,
what about the wheat cakes?

107
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:51,995
Jack, this is ridiculous.

108
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,627
Stay down, hon.
We only got a minute to go.

109
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:57,697
All right, 44, shift, 33, shift,
22, shift, 21, hike!

110
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,475
Hi, folks...

111
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,041
- Are you hurt, Son?
- No, sir.

112
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,414
Get up, boy.
Put your hands up over your head.

113
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,113
Take a few deep breaths.
Come on. That's it.

114
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:13,486
- You'll be all right. You'll be...
- Jack, stop that.

115
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:14,990
Here, dear. Let me help you.

116
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,617
- Where are your glasses?
- I don't know, Mother.

117
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,196
They must be around here someplace.

118
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,791
Well...

119
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,430
Oh, dear.

120
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:38,738
Are you all right, dear?
Here, let me help you.

121
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,209
There.

122
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,831
I'll be all right.
I'll just sit here at the piano for a while.

123
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,167
Thanks, Dad.

124
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,403
Dad, what were you doing?

125
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:12,775
- Oh, nothing. I was just...
- Your father was reliving his youth.

126
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:17,377
Well, dear, you'd better go upstairs
and freshen up for breakfast.

127
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,715
- All right, Mother. I'll be down in a jiffy.
- All right.

128
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:22,959
Oh, Mother, Dad,

129
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,487
do you notice anything different
about me?

130
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,928
- No. You look the same to me, Son.
- No. What is it?

131
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,298
Well, the lower half of the brace is off,

132
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,337
and the other half comes off next week.

133
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:37,236
- That's wonderful, Junior!
- I think so.

134
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,138
And I also have good news
from Dr. Hunter.

135
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,232
What?

136
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:43,006
He says that the liver shots
are working out better than he expected,

137
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,810
and it'll only be a question of time. Bye.

138
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:52,679
Ann,

139
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:58,354
you know that I love Junior
as well as any father ever loved a son.

140
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,560
In fact, I've named him Junior after me.

141
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,363
But how could this have happened
to the two of us?

142
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,528
How could what have happened?

143
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,469
Let's face facts, Ann.

144
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:13,803
Look at you, look at me
and then look at Junior.

145
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:17,241
Is there nothing to this
doggone heredity business?

146
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,545
- But, Jack, he's only a baby.
- A baby?

147
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:24,886
- He's graduating from high school.
- Yes, but he's just a child.

148
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:26,316
A child?

149
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:28,956
Is that any excuse
for him to have hay fever

150
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,720
in both winter and summer,

151
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:33,194
to wear glasses
since he was six years old,

152
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:36,164
to have sinus trouble whether
it's raining or whether it isn't raining?

153
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,758
For heaven's sakes, Ann, what's he
going to be when he grows up?

154
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,461
It's frightening.

155
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,768
Jack, there's nothing wrong with Junior,
physically.

156
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:46,172
Dr. Hunter says it's psychosomatic.

157
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:48,073
Psychosomatic? What's that?

158
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:52,839
Well, his ailments are brought on
by mental and emotional disturbances.

159
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,840
Well, who's disturbing him?

160
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,286
- You are.
- Me?

161
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:59,649
Don't be ridiculous.

162
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,248
You know there isn't a better father
than I am.

163
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,224
I've given that boy everything.

164
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:06,922
When he was six years old,
I built him a gym out in the garage.

165
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:08,055
When he was 10 years old,

166
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:10,292
I gave him the finest
professional football equipment.

167
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,268
Oh, no, don't put the blame on me.
He's half yours.

168
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,997
Please, Jack, he'll hear you.

169
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,300
Well, I don't care if he... If he does.

170
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,342
Let's eat our breakfast.

171
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,610
May. May!

172
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,030
Junior! Hurry, your father's waiting.

173
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:55,043
I'll be right down, Mother.
I just have one more nostril to go.

174
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:17,332
Come on, Junior. Everything's ready.

175
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:20,926
I'm sorry I'm late, Dad.
I used your razor. Do you mind?

176
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:23,035
Razor? What for?

177
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,971
Well, I'll be shaving soon.

178
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:28,636
In fact, it's starting to come in
on my upper lip now. See?

179
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,714
Well, that's encouraging.

180
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:33,009
Just be careful you don't
cut yourself with it, that's all.

181
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:34,744
Oh, I'll be careful,
but if anything did happen...

182
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:37,582
I always have my Boy Scout first-aid kit
with me at all times.

183
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,589
I'm not an Eagle Scout for nothing,
you know.

184
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,720
Have some strawberries, Son.
Help yourself.

185
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,994
- I'll have to pass it up, Dad.
- Why? Build you up.

186
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:52,591
Well, I...

187
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,933
Jack, you know Junior's allergic
to strawberries.

188
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,872
- He breaks out in a rash.
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

189
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:00,705
That's all right, Dad,
but I'm taking shots for it.

190
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:04,174
Great. Well, what's next?

191
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,841
May!

192
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,475
Jack, you don't have to bellow.

193
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,988
Boy, those look good.
Pass your plate, honey.

194
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:15,586
Thank you.

195
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:20,322
That's it, Son. Now I want you to eat
every one of those.

196
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,032
Put some syrup on there.

197
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:28,127
Now, dig in, boy. Make a man of you.

198
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:33,200
- Dad, I...
- Oh, you want butter. Sure.

199
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,570
That-a-boy.

200
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,984
- Dad, I can't eat these.
- Why not, boy?

201
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,748
Jack, you just go on and eat
and let Junior alone.

202
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:46,516
What's the matter?
Why can't you eat it, Son?

203
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,524
Well, Dad, I have too much
sugar content in my system now,

204
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,824
which Dr. Hunter says could ultimately
lead to diabetes when I get older,

205
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:55,762
and I'm taking shots for it.

206
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:56,992
Shots!

207
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,197
Good night!

208
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:08,744
Say, these wheat cakes are pretty good.

209
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,711
By the way, where are the eggs?

210
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:11,838
May!

211
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,983
You want them
with the ham and the bacon?

212
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,112
Leave off the bacon, May.
I wanna lose some weight.

213
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,589
- Just the ham and eggs.
- Yes, sir.

214
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,349
What's the matter with you, boy?

215
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,485
I'm waiting for my egg, sir.

216
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:26,756
An egg!

217
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,833
What kind of a breakfast
do you call that, anyway?

218
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,094
You're graduating from high school.

219
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,762
You have to go on to college
and play football like any other boy.

220
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:36,362
How do you expect to do that
on one egg?

221
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,872
That's my diet, sir.

222
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:41,536
Jack, leave the boy alone.
You're only making him nervous.

223
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,646
He's making me nervous!
I can't eat a thing!

224
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,224
Now what are you doing?

225
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:59,693
I'm preparing to take my pill, Dad,
which will allow me to eat the egg.

226
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,822
You want me to gain weight, don't you?

227
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:03,957
Why don't you just swallow it down
with water?

228
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:06,366
I can't take a pill that way, sir. I gag.

229
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,528
Gag?

230
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,296
Look,

231
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,802
you just take the pill,
you put it on the back of your tongue,

232
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,674
flush it down with water and it's all over.

233
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,077
I've tried that, sir, but I gag.

234
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:21,976
That's ridiculous. You're not going
to grow up to be a sissy!

235
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:23,280
Jack, please.

236
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,322
Will you stay out of this, Ann?
After all, I'm not a villain.

237
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:28,857
I have a perfect right
to show my own son how to take a pill.

238
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,328
Now, Son, just relax,
and leave everything to me.

239
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:35,162
Have you got another pill there?

240
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,134
Give it to me.

241
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:42,563
Now you take your glass of water
in your right hand.

242
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,233
Come on. Take your pill in your left.

243
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,171
Stick out your tongue.

244
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:48,536
Way out.

245
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,374
Now put the pill
on the back of your tongue.

246
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,915
Way back. That's it. Now,

247
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:54,548
flush it down with water.

248
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:56,619
Oh, for heaven's sake.

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,518
Here. I'll help you. Give me another pill.

250
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,425
All right, now open up.

251
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:07,029
Flush it down.

252
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,255
Now you got it?

253
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,335
Good. Now, you see, Son,

254
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:15,002
it just takes a little guts
and a little doing.

255
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,767
Simple case of mind over matter, right?

256
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,334
Now, Junior,
I'm going upstairs to dress,

257
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,436
but before I go to work,

258
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:26,641
I want to have a little talk with you.

259
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,513
See you in the den.

260
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,194
My favorite room.

261
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:23,835
Nothing like the old den
for a heart-to-heart talk.

262
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,409
I'm more proud of you
every time I come in here, Dad.

263
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,480
I wanna be proud of you, Son.
That's why I wanna have this little talk.

264
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,209
Now just sit down and relax. Have one?

265
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:36,643
- Oh, no, thank you, sir.
- Go ahead. You're old enough.

266
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,182
Yes, sir.

267
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,588
I guess you're not ready yet.

268
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,127
And don't call me "sir."

269
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:47,754
It sounds like I'm training you
to be an English butler.

270
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,992
This is just man talk, you and me.
So relax, Son.

271
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:52,793
Now,

272
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,702
what are your plans for college?

273
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,899
Oh, well, Dad, I thought that I'd...

274
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,238
You'd like to go to Ridgeville.
That's natural.

275
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,175
Your grandfather went there,
built the stadium.

276
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,247
Your mother went there,
and I went there.

277
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:08,182
I was a nine-letter man myself.
So, naturally, you'll be there.

278
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:12,813
Yes, the name Ridgeville and Jackson
are one and the same thing.

279
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:16,051
- I know, Dad, but I thought I'd like to...
- You'd like to try for the team?

280
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,218
You're a lucky boy, Junior.
I can help you there.

281
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,195
As it happens, Coach Wheeler
is a very dear friend of mine.

282
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:23,129
Matter of fact,
I gave him a new gym last year,

283
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,098
so I guess we won't
have any trouble there.

284
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,534
But, Dad, I thought,
well, I'd like to join...

285
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:32,132
Join a fraternity. Naturally, you'll be
an ALK man, just like your dad.

286
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:36,869
I guess we won't have any trouble there.
I gave the boys a new house last year.

287
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,380
- But, Dad...
- Yes, you'll have four grand years

288
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,472
at Ridgeville, Junior,

289
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,984
before you come out to the plant
and take over in my place.

290
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,747
You've got a good life, Junior.

291
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:47,153
Why, I wish I were your age,
just starting out,

292
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,781
everything to look forward to.

293
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,855
Oh, to be young again.

294
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:52,986
You're a lucky boy, Junior.

295
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,259
- Dad, could I say something?
- Certainly, Son.

296
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:59,460
Well, sir, I don't want you to think
that I'm disrespectful,

297
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:03,437
or that I don't appreciate everything
you're trying to do for me.

298
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,337
Well, I have an idea.

299
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,768
- You have an idea?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,709
I want to go to college,

301
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,174
but I don't want to go to Ridgeville.

302
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,712
Not go to Ridgeville?

303
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,655
Well, there's nothing wrong
with Ridgeville, sir. It's just that

304
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,919
I became interested
in animal husbandry,

305
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,086
and there's
a very wonderful school upstate.

306
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:30,895
Northern California Aggie. It's a farm
college, and they're very progressive.

307
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,460
Northern California Aggie?

308
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,696
A farm college?

309
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,103
Yes, sir. It's an experimental school,
and they're doing wonders with animals.

310
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,679
For instance, the Dean of Men
crossed a pig with a hybrid,

311
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,408
- and it's very interesting what came out.
- What?

312
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,108
A very short pig.

313
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,379
But the experiments
aren't finished yet, Dad.

314
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,389
And I thought I might even become a vet
and work with animals,

315
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,356
'cause they're very different
than human beings.

316
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,257
They can't tell you when they're in pain.

317
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,455
They have no way of communicating
with you.

318
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:02,589
Therefore, one has to have
more feelings for them

319
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,633
than the ordinary doctor.

320
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,067
Am I making you understand, Dad?

321
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,734
You're making me ill.

322
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,502
Are you standing there telling me
that a son of mine,

323
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:18,012
a Jackson, wants to go
to some jerk agricultural college

324
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:19,980
and study to be a horse doctor?

325
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,612
You two boys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves,

326
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,779
in here chatting
when there's so much to do.

327
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:29,586
Jack, the car is waiting,
and Junior, it's your graduation day.

328
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,524
Now, come along, Jack.

329
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:36,290
- Jack.
- Yeah, what is it?

330
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,095
Remember, be home early.

331
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,693
Junior's graduating tonight,
and the ceremonies start at 7:30.

332
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,569
Don't worry, I'll be there with bells on.

333
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,536
Cowbells.

334
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:49,905
"Jarring" Jack Jackson's son,

335
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,037
a horse doctor.

336
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:05,021
Mother, what's wrong with Dad and me?
We don't get along.

337
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,925
Oh, you're just imagining things.

338
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,966
Every boy has certain disagreements
with his father. That's natural.

339
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,591
All the time? Is that natural?

340
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:16,536
But, Junior, your father's heart is set
on your going to Ridgeville.

341
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,268
I know, Mother,
but I can't follow in Dad's footsteps.

342
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,402
His shoes are too big,
and I feel uncomfortable in them.

343
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,980
- You understand.
- Yes, I understand.

344
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,517
Sometimes I think your father is the boy
and you're the man.

345
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,176
Now come along.

346
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,751
Everybody look this way!

347
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,557
Smile!

348
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:39,625
Attention!

349
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,032
Now, that was very good.

350
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,028
Quiet, everybody.

351
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:51,835
I would now like to get a picture
of the most popular boy,

352
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,775
president of the student body,
Washington High School

353
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:58,541
and the greatest athlete
who ever graduated,

354
00:19:58,648 --> 00:19:59,979
Bill Baker.

355
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,412
All right, Bill. Steady.

356
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:08,980
Mr. Jackson, that's my son, Bill.

357
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,594
That strapping, good-looking,
healthy specimen belongs to you?

358
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,596
Wait a moment, sir.

359
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:24,140
I want you to have a picture taken
with Babs Hunter,

360
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:27,301
the most beautiful girl
in our graduating class.

361
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,705
Babs, will you come up?

362
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:36,950
Babs looks wonderful, Doc.
You must be very proud of her.

363
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,749
She's quite a girl. Quite a girl.

364
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,691
Junior Jackson,
will you come here a minute?

365
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:51,825
No, not in the picture.
I want you to hold the flashlight.

366
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:01,802
Now!

367
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,112
Thank you.

368
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:09,543
Hiya, Dad. How do you feel?

369
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,283
Fine, my boy. Fine.

370
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:15,119
Mr. Jackson,
I want you to meet my son, Bill.

371
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:18,217
- Glad to meet you, young man.
- Nice to know you, sir.

372
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:21,297
You've got quite a boy there, Henry.
He's got quite a handshake.

373
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:23,457
Quite a boy. Quite a boy.

374
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:27,634
Mr. Jackson,
I know this isn't the time or the place,

375
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:31,400
but I was wondering if you could see Bill
tomorrow, on a little personal matter.

376
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,497
Of course. I'd be glad to.

377
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,600
I'll see the two of you
at the plant tomorrow morning.

378
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,679
Good luck to you, my boy.

379
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,305
I wish you were.

380
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,846
That heredity business is all cockeyed.

381
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,586
Little Henry Baker.

382
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:48,351
Oh, come on, Jack.
Let's have some punch.

383
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:54,324
- Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Son.

384
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,524
- My, you look nice, Son.
- Thank you.

385
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,567
- Doesn't he, Jack?
- Sure does.

386
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:00,898
- Oh, take it easy, Dad.
- I forgot. I'm sorry.

387
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:02,198
Anyway, congratulations, Son.

388
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:04,273
Thank you, Dad.
And thank you for the watch.

389
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:05,739
See, Mother?

390
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:10,135
"To Junior. Love, Dad."
Oh, Jack, that's sweet.

391
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,247
- Congratulations, Junior.
- Oh, thank you, Dr. Hunter.

392
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:17,218
I say, sir, would it be all right with you
if I took Babs home tonight?

393
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,288
- Why, certainly, Junior, certainly.
- Thank you.

394
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:21,983
Dad, may I have the car?
You see, I'd like...

395
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,921
Of course, Son. You and Babs
have a good time. Here are the keys.

396
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,657
Don't stay out too late.
Cuts down on your wind.

397
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,925
I'll be home early, Dad.

398
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,501
- You sure you don't mind, sir?
- Why, not at all, Junior.

399
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,003
- Where is Babs?
- I don't know, sir, but I'll find her.

400
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,866
Little Henry Baker.

401
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:40,243
Take it easy, girls.
I'll get writer's cramp.

402
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,574
Take it easy, girls.
I'll get writer's cramp.

403
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:43,475
Well, Bill, you haven't signed mine yet.

404
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,275
And you promised to sign mine, too.

405
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:47,509
Don't forget I have the second dance
with you.

406
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,551
- And I have the third.
- And I have the fourth.

407
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,711
Bill.

408
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,180
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Bill.

409
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,380
You're welcome.

410
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,151
Could I have your autograph, too?

411
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:57,886
Babs, you can have anything you want.
You sure look pretty tonight.

412
00:22:57,994 --> 00:22:59,689
Thanks. You look pretty good yourself.

413
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,889
- Want to dance?
- I'd love to.

414
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:55,044
- May I have this dance, Mrs. Johnson?
- Why, I'd love to, Junior.

415
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:26,903
<i>Here's a new dance</i>
<i>we ought to show them how to do</i>

416
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:31,772
<i>Gives us a chance to really show them</i>

417
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,213
<i>Something new</i>

418
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:36,576
<i>Are you ready?</i>

419
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,652
<i>Ready and waiting, sir</i>

420
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,656
<i>Well, okay</i>

421
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:44,591
<i>First you put your two knees</i>
<i>Close up tight</i>

422
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:47,686
<i>Then you sway them to the left</i>
<i>And then you sway them to the right</i>

423
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,821
<i>Then?</i>

424
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:50,866
<i>Step around the floor</i>
<i>Kind of nice and light</i>

425
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:54,266
<i>Then you twist around and twist around</i>
<i>With all your might</i>

426
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,394
<i>Wow!</i>

427
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,735
<i>Stretch your loving arms</i>
<i>Straight out into space</i>

428
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:00,469
<i>Do the Eagle Rock with style and grace</i>

429
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:03,910
<i>Swing your foot way around</i>
<i>Then bring it back</i>

430
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:07,312
<i>Now that's what I call balling the jack</i>

431
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:13,320
<i>First you put your two knees</i>
<i>Close up tight</i>

432
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:16,551
<i>Then you sway them to the left</i>
<i>And then you sway them to the right</i>

433
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,717
<i>Then?</i>

434
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,727
<i>Step around the floor</i>
<i>Kind of nice and light</i>

435
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,992
<i>Then you twist around and twist around</i>
<i>With all your might</i>

436
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:24,123
<i>Wow!</i>

437
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,464

438
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:29,265

<i>Now that's what I call balling the jack</i>

441
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,714
- <i>First</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

442
00:26:40,817 --> 00:26:42,011
<i>Your knees up tight</i>

443
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:43,608
- <i>Then sway them</i>
- <i>Done</i>

444
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,278
<i>To the left, to the right</i>

445
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:48,414
<i>Step around the floor</i>
<i>Kind of nice and light</i>

446
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,821
<i>Then twist</i>

447
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:53,294
<i>With all your might, boy</i>

448
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,197
<i>Your arms in space</i>

449
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,062
<i>You do the Eagle Rock</i>
<i>With style and grace</i>

450
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,032
<i>Swing your foot way around</i>

451
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:01,626
<i>Then bring it back</i>

452
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:05,003
<i>Now that's what we call balling the jack</i>

453
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,176
- <i>Knees</i>
- <i>Cuddle your knees, close up tight</i>

454
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,805
- <i>Hep, hep</i>
- <i>To the left</i>

455
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,474
- <i>Reverse</i>
- <i>To the right</i>

456
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:17,644
<i>Then you step around the floor</i>
<i>Kind of nice and light</i>

457
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:20,951
<i>Then twist, boy, with all your might</i>

458
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,781
- <i>Stretch</i>
- <i>Stretch</i>

459
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,325
<i>Out in space</i>

460
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:27,487
<i>Do the Eagle Rock with form and grace</i>

461
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:29,155
<i>Your foot way round</i>

462
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:30,789
<i>Bring it back</i>

463
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,994
<i>That's what we call balling the jack</i>

464
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:38,801
<i>Stretch your loving arms</i>

465
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,968
<i>With style and grace</i>

<i>Swing your foot way around</i>

467
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:46,906
<i>Bring it back</i>

468
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:49,382
<i>Boy, boy, boy, move along</i>

469
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,646
<i>That's what we call</i>

470
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:56,555
<i>Balling the jack</i>

471
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:10,098
I can't understand it.
Henry Baker to have a son like that.

472
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,376
I hope Junior and Babs like each other.
She's such a sweet girl.

473
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,942
I think they'd be a nice couple.

474
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:21,278
Little man to have such a big son.
It just doesn't make sense.

475
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:23,818
Jack, what are you mumbling about?

476
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,285
Oh, nothing.

477
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:27,021
It's amazing.

478
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,555
Just doesn't seem fair.

479
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:42,765
I'm sorry we didn't get to dance
the last waltz together, Junior.

480
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:46,103
I guess we missed each other,
but I looked for you.

481
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,641
Well, anyways, you're taking me home,
and I'm with you.

482
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:52,180
You don't mind taking Bill home,
do you?

483
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,771
No, not at all.

484
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,951
Thanks, Junior.
This sure is a sweet car.

485
00:28:57,053 --> 00:29:00,284
You're a lucky guy.
Put the radio on, will you, Junior?

486
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,821
Yeah, sure.

487
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:16,667
Drive slowly through the park,
huh, Junior?

488
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:28,344
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

489
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:33,745
<i>Simply because you're near me</i>

490
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:39,525
<i>Funny, but when you're near me</i>

491
00:29:40,163 --> 00:29:44,065
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

492
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:49,331
<i>Why stop to think of whether</i>

493
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,408
<i>This little dream might fade</i>

494
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:59,412
<i>We've put our hearts together</i>

495
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:03,183
<i>Now we are one</i>

496
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,781
<i>I'm not afraid</i>

497
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:10,418
<i>If there's a cloud above</i>

498
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:15,227
<i>If it should rain, we'll let it</i>

499
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:20,502
<i>But for tonight forget it</i>

500
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:25,771
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

501
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:39,218
Boy, you sure are a lucky guy
to have a girlfriend like Babs.

502
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,023
Yep. Lucky guy.

503
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,195
- Yes?
- <i>Coach Wheeler is here to see you, sir.</i>

504
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:52,461
- Coach Wheeler! Yes, send him right in.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

505
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:58,702
"Jarring" Jack Jackson. Put it there!

506
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:01,402
Coach Wheeler, you old son of a gun.
Glad to see you.

507
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,241
- What's the beef?
- No beef. I've got good news.

508
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,747
Ridgeville's got a chance
for the Championship this year.

509
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,079
- On the level?
- Yep. Here's the layout.

510
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,449
There's a great athlete in this town,
Bill Baker.

511
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:13,954
Just graduated
from Washington High School.

512
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,990
His old man's a bookkeeper someplace.

513
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:19,858
Underpaid, hasn't got a cent,
works for some rich, miserable guy,

514
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,987
so this kid doesn't have the money
to go to college.

515
00:31:22,098 --> 00:31:24,066
It's the old story, Jack.

516
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:28,126
Coach, I know this kid, Baker.
His father works for me.

517
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,465
He's my bookkeeper.

518
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,798
- Well, Jack, I didn't mean to...
- That's all right, Coach. Forget about it.

519
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,172
What do you want me to do?

520
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:37,246
Finance this kid through school.

521
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,409
All right. I'll do it on one condition.

522
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,641
When my son comes to Ridgeville,

523
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:45,744
you've got to see that
he makes the team and gets his letter.

524
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:48,915
But, Jack, be reasonable.
Your kid's never played football.

525
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:51,425
- Besides, he's too light.
- So what?

526
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,761
He could be another Sammy Baugh,
a great passer,

527
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:55,330
or Albie Booth, a great kicker.

528
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,594
- Well, it's possible, but...
- There's no buts to it, Coach.

529
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:03,032
I want my kid to earn his letter
at Ridgeville more than anything in life.

530
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:04,834
It's a package deal, Coach.

531
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:09,708
If you want to take Bill Baker,
you'll have to take my son. Yes or no?

532
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:13,841
I need this Baker boy
like I need my right arm,

533
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,941
and I need your son, Junior,
like I need a...

534
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:19,948
Okay, it's a deal.

535
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:22,524
- So long.
- So long, Coach.

536
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,400
My son's here.

537
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:38,370
- Could you see him now, Mr. Jackson?
- Yes, send him right in.

538
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,307
- Mr. Jackson.
- Hi, Bill.

539
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:43,239
Sit down.

540
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,478
- What's on your mind?
- Well, I was talking with my dad,

541
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:49,608
and he suggested I come on over here
and ask you for a job in your plant.

542
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,017
Well, aren't you planning
to go to college?

543
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:55,682
Well, I always wanted to,
but frankly, we don't have the money.

544
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:00,023
What would you do if someone
offered you a chance to go to Ridgeville,

545
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,129
all expenses paid?

546
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,692
- I'd faint.
- Well, don't faint,

547
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,664
because I'm going to make you
that offer.

548
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:09,498
But why?

549
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,266
Well, Bill,

550
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:14,337
you know my son, Junior?

551
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:19,414
I spent a few hours with him
last night, but I don't know him too well.

552
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:20,777
That's the point.

553
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:25,081
Well, I want you to know him better, Bill.
You see, he's a great kid,

554
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,947
but he didn't turn out
the way I wanted him to.

555
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:32,289
I wanted him to be more like you.

556
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:34,761
Well, maybe he's just a different type.

557
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:36,556
You're so right.

558
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,365
That's why I thought

559
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:41,027
that maybe if the two of you
were roommates at Ridgeville,

560
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,798
that you could sort of look after him.

561
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:46,432
Maybe you could inspire him
to be an athlete like yourself.

562
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:49,739
You know,
the strong looking after the weak?

563
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,805
What does he say about all this?

564
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:55,145
He doesn't know anything about it.

565
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:57,116
And he must never know.

566
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,383
Well, what do you say?

567
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:02,223
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal, Mr. Jackson.

568
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,657
But, you know, with Junior,
it's not gonna be too easy.

569
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,093
I only hope I have enough time left
to play football.

570
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:18,702
You're getting closer to Ridgeville, Son.

571
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:24,172
Yes? Hello, dear.

572
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:27,079
Feeling fine, fine. Yes.

573
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,546
Delighted to have him
for dinner, certainly!

574
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:34,885
Good old Ben Green, my old classmate.
Phi Beta Kappa, smart as a whip.

575
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,559
Yes, I'll be home early for dinner.

576
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,292
All right, dear. Bye.

577
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,892
Let me get this straight, Ben.
Aren't you a doctor?

578
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:49,932
I'm a psychiatrist.

579
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:53,437
- You mean, dealing with crazy people?
- Oh, no, Dad.

580
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:56,739
A psychiatrist is a man who helps
people adjust to their environment

581
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,336
and overcome inhibitions.

582
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:02,008
Very good, son.
That, in essence, is what we do.

583
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:04,985
You'd be surprised how many people
need help and don't know it.

584
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:07,885
- Well, I think it's all the bunk.
- Jack, please.

585
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,981
Now, that's all right.
Jack hasn't offended me.

586
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:13,323
A lot of people share his viewpoint.
They don't know they need help.

587
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:17,229
I was on a very interesting case
in Chicago about a month ago.

588
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:21,659
Typical case of a dominating father
trying to run his son's life.

589
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,295
Result, typical son.

590
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:26,341
Shy, introverted, psychosomatic
symptoms,

591
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:28,467
clash of personalities, tragedy.

592
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:29,601
What happened?

593
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,907
Well, in this case,
the father committed suicide.

594
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:34,608
He jumped out
of a second-story window.

595
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:40,650
That's very interesting, Dr. Green.
Do you know of any similar cases?

596
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:44,220
Well, there was another case
of a father and son...

597
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:47,489
Yes, well, I don't approve of this kind
of conversation in front of children.

598
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,827
Junior, why don't you go upstairs now
and get a good night's rest?

599
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,594
- Kiss your mother good night.
- But, Dad...

600
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:53,895
You heard what I said, Son.

601
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:56,335
Kiss your mother good night.
Shake hands with Dr. Green here,

602
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,737
and upstairs you go, right, Son?

603
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:01,200
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Son.

604
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,870
- Good night, Dad. Good night, sir.
- Good night, good night.

605
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:06,709
Would you know where I could get
any books on this subject, Dr. Green?

606
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:09,512
- Son!
- Oh, good night.

607
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,090
An only child?

608
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:18,994
Yes, he's our only child.

609
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,622
Very interesting.

610
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:26,698
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some things to do.

611
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:35,801
Jack,

612
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:39,739
I don't want to get too personal,
but I think you have a problem

613
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,113
with your son. Let me help you.

614
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:46,176
You know, a lot of people pay me
fancy prices for this. You can get it free.

615
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,653
Thanks, Ben.

616
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,948
There is a problem,
and there shouldn't be.

617
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:53,085
Because no one could be a better father
than I am to that boy.

618
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:57,029
Ben, he's going to step right into
a big business. It's all set up for him.

619
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,464
I had it all planned for him
to go to Ridgeville.

620
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:02,799
I had it all arranged for him to have
the best room in the fraternity house.

621
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:05,772
I even had it fixed for him
to get his letter.

622
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,768
- What do I get for it?
- He resents it.

623
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,204
How did you know?

624
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,840
Say, Ben, what is happening
with this younger generation?

625
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,042
They're ungrateful.

626
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,314
Jack, you don't understand.
He's not the problem. You are.

627
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:20,479
Me?

628
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:23,353
Why, there isn't a better father
than I am, Ben.

629
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,189
- That boy's had the best.
- Well, let's not get into all that.

630
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:29,594
You've done nothing for that boy.
You've done it all for yourself.

631
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:32,098
- You're selfish, Jack.
- Selfish?

632
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:36,167
- I only want my son to be a leader.
- Maybe he's not a leader.

633
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:37,705
Well, he's got to be.

634
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:40,775
Jack, you're trying to run your son's life,
and it won't work.

635
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,468
He's not like you.

636
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:45,240
And if you keep it up, you're going
to run into a much worse problem

637
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,372
than whether or not
he wants to go to Ridgeville.

638
00:37:47,483 --> 00:37:49,451
It can become much worse.

639
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,553
Well, what'll I do, Ben?

640
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:57,650
Why don't you go up and visit with Ann,
let me talk to Junior a few minutes?

641
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,886
Maybe I can help.

642
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:06,792
Junior, will you come down here
a minute?

643
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:08,563
I'm getting ready for bed.

644
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:11,537
Well, forget about it,
and come on down here.

645
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:14,498
- Son.
- All right, Dad.

646
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:19,447
Now, remember,
I want that boy to go to Ridgeville.

647
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:31,150
Dr. Green here would like to have
a little talk with you.

648
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:35,254
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Junior.

649
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:38,197
- Just like to have a little chat with you.
- Well, is it all right with...

650
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,600
Oh, yes, yes. Let's go on in the den,
where we can be more comfortable.

651
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:46,041
If you don't mind, sir,
could we talk someplace else?

652
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:49,338
- You see...
- You don't have to explain. I understand.

653
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:50,935
Would the patio be better?

654
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,638
- I think so.
- Fine.

655
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:57,313
- You don't like the den, Junior. Why?
- Oh, it's a nice room.

656
00:38:57,886 --> 00:39:02,186
It's my father's favorite.
But it's his room. You understand.

657
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,252
Very interesting. Of course.

658
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,924
Anyway, it's a nice night,
so let's just make ourselves comfortable

659
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:10,999
and have a pleasant chat.

660
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:15,965
Junior, I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

661
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:19,336
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, sir. I like talking to you, Dr. Green.

662
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,533
Good.

663
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:22,873
Well, now that you've graduated
from high school,

664
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,605
what would you like to do?

665
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:27,580
Well, will it be confidential?
Just between the two of us?

666
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:29,082
Confidential.

667
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:31,675
Well, sir, I'd like to go to Ridgeville,

668
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:35,223
and I'd like to play football,
but I never will.

669
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:38,224
- Why not?
- Because of my dad.

670
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:42,452
Don't get me wrong, sir.
I love him, and I respect him,

671
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,725
and I'd like to do everything he did,

672
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,631
but I never will,
because I couldn't do it as good.

673
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:49,101
I'm scared.

674
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:51,331
Well, how do you know
you couldn't do it as good?

675
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,967
No one is as good as my dad, sir.
Just ask him.

676
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,170
He does everything the best.

677
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,012
That's why I do everything the worst.

678
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,106
I got what you call complexes,

679
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:06,085
and I don't mean to be disrespectful,
sir, but I'm frustrated.

680
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:09,156
Have you ever told your dad
what you would like to do?

681
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:12,659
Oh, no, sir. You can't tell him anything.
He tells you.

682
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,187
Well, why don't you try
to meet your dad halfway?

683
00:40:16,298 --> 00:40:17,663
Talk it out with him.

684
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:21,361
Try and show him your side of it.
You take the initiative.

685
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,598
You know, older people are more set
in their ways.

686
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,868
I think you owe it to your dad
and yourself

687
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:29,000
to try to become better acquainted
with him.

688
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:31,636
- I'll try, Dr. Green.
- Fine.

689
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:34,441
You can go to bed now, Junior,
if you like.

690
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,040
Thank you, sir.

691
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:38,446
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

692
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,497
Ben,

693
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:00,374
what's wrong with him?

694
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:03,206
Nothing, Jack. He's a fine boy.

695
00:41:03,312 --> 00:41:05,712
I think someday
you're going to be proud of him.

696
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:08,942
I would suggest, however,
that you try to see more of him alone,

697
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,951
get to know him better.

698
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,913
I'd like to, Ben, but it seems like
every time we're together, we fight.

699
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:17,082
I think the boy resents me.

700
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,716
It's unnatural.

701
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:23,192
On the contrary, Jack,
it's the most natural thing in the world

702
00:41:23,298 --> 00:41:25,766
for children to resent their parents.

703
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:28,462
It's based on the fact
that from the time they're born,

704
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,006
parents represent authority,
interfere with their will.

705
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:35,207
So the average normal child
often resents his parents.

706
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,005
Some children wish
they had different parents.

707
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:39,706
Some children even hate their parents.

708
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,975
What about Junior? Think he hates me?

709
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:46,551
Hates you?

710
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,722
The only advice I can give is

711
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,353
never take your boy hunting.

712
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,233
- Who is it?
- It's me.

713
00:42:08,544 --> 00:42:10,239
Just a minute, Dad.

714
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,889
Come in, Dad.

715
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:30,021
Son,

716
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:35,225
I think we ought to become
better acquainted, don't you?

717
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:37,836
I think so.

718
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,507
A father and a son ought to be,
well, close, more like buddies.

719
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:47,180
- Don't you think so?
- I think so.

720
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:52,083
Tomorrow's Sunday. Why don't we
spend the whole day together?

721
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:54,985
Just you and I, alone, you know, like...

722
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:56,854
Like pals.

723
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:59,784
- I'd like that, Dad.
- Good.

724
00:43:00,863 --> 00:43:03,127
What would you like to do, Son?

725
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:05,656
Anything you'd like to do, Dad.

726
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:09,464
Well, no, no, it's your day.
Now, what would you like to do?

727
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:14,698
- Anything you'd like to do, Dad.
- Now, I'm asking you...

728
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,970
What would you like to do, Son?

729
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,113
Well, I have a splendid idea, Dad,
something I think we'll both enjoy.

730
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:23,514
Well, what is it?

731
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,882
Would you take me hunting?

732
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,057
If that's what you really want to do, Son.

733
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:36,722
- Careful with that gun. It may be loaded.
- No, it isn't, Dad. See.

734
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,904
Oh, will you be careful with that thing?
You know it's loaded!

735
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:57,110
- I know it, Dad.
- You know, an accident can happen.

736
00:43:57,219 --> 00:43:59,983
Wouldn't it be a terrible thing
if you shot your own father?

737
00:44:00,088 --> 00:44:01,146
Yeah.

738
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:04,958
What are you grinning about?

739
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,291
I'm so happy.
I'm having such a good time, Dad.

740
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:16,699
I think we'll find some game over there.
Now, Son,

741
00:44:16,805 --> 00:44:20,468
why don't you go in front of me?
I want you to have the first shot.

742
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,100
No, Dad. You go in front of me.

743
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:26,942
No, Son. Now, you go in front of me.
I'll cover your rear.

744
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:30,018
No, Dad. I'll be in back of you. You first.

745
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:58,743
- It's a fine specimen, isn't it, Dad?
- Certainly is, Son.

746
00:44:59,548 --> 00:45:02,108
Let's have a little nip to celebrate.

747
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:06,921
- Join me, Son?
- Oh, I've never had a drink, Dad.

748
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:08,215
You're a man now.

749
00:45:08,323 --> 00:45:10,314
Anybody who can shoot like that,
can have a little nip.

750
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:14,020
I'd rather that you have it with me.
You've my permission.

751
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:21,429
Son, here's to you and Ridgeville.

752
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:39,116
<i>He's a jolly good fellow</i>

753
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:44,022
<i>He's a jolly good fellow</i>

754
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,460
<i>That nobody can deny</i>

755
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,734
- Well.
- Good evening, madam.

756
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,303
Good evening, Mother.

757
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,202
What is this all about?

758
00:45:58,306 --> 00:46:01,207
Just a little evening
between father and son.

759
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:04,276
- Perfectly normal.
- Perfectly normal!

760
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:07,815
- You've both been drinking!
- Drinking? That's ridiculous.

761
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,911
Just a little celebration

762
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,419
of Junior's deciding to go to Ridgeville.

763
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,819
Right, Son?

764
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:17,655
Right, Dad.

765
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:30,468
May! May!

766
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:13,803
Hi.

767
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,715
- This is Room 24, isn't it?
- Yeah.

768
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:21,384
What are you trying to do,
grow up to be a rabbit?

769
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:24,823
No, these are my Dr. Denton pajamas,
in case I get a chill.

770
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:27,190
Well, I guess you and I
are gonna be roommates.

771
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:29,421
Why?

772
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:32,700
I don't know why.
They just assigned me to Room 24.

773
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:37,763
What's the matter?
Did you expect to bunk alone?

774
00:47:37,873 --> 00:47:42,276
No, no. I was just wondering why
the two of us are roommates, that's all.

775
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:43,737
Just wondering.

776
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:46,814
I don't know why.
They just put us together, I guess.

777
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:47,973
Okay?

778
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:50,214
Yeah. Okay.

779
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,528
Mind if I have a drawer?

780
00:48:10,939 --> 00:48:13,601
Oh, no, no. I didn't know.

781
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:16,370
I'll get them out.

782
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,341
Would you like the top drawer
or the bottom drawer?

783
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,441
Makes no difference to me.

784
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,211
Makes no difference to me.

785
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:29,947
Makes no difference to me.

786
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:33,017
Makes no difference to me.

787
00:48:34,095 --> 00:48:36,893
- Will one drawer be enough?
- One is plenty.

788
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:49,374
- More shirts?
- Oh, no, these are my medications.

789
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:52,169
Oh, you're planning
to become a doctor?

790
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,511
Oh, no.
You see, I haven't been too well.

791
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,828
Do you want the upper shelf or
the lower shelf of the medicine chest?

792
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:10,090
Either one. I haven't got too much.

793
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:13,690
- The lower one is easier to get to.
- Makes no difference.

794
00:49:13,802 --> 00:49:15,793
Makes no difference to me.

795
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:22,168
If you ever have sinus,
this stuff'll clear it up in a minute.

796
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:25,804
Just two drops in each nostril,
and you'll breathe again.

797
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,153
Of course, a little will trickle
down your throat.

798
00:49:33,255 --> 00:49:35,382
But I have a pill for that
which clears it up.

799
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,482
I wouldn't have any use for that.
I'm pretty healthy.

800
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:39,685
Oh, that's nice.

801
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:41,557
Do you want to sleep
in the upper or the lower?

802
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:44,427
- Makes no difference.
- Makes no difference to me.

803
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:48,199
You gonna make up your mind,
or are you gonna drive me nuts?

804
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:50,396
You don't have to get huffy.
I'll take the lower.

805
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:51,563
Fine.

806
00:50:13,528 --> 00:50:15,928
I think I'd better take the upper.

807
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:18,323
Why?

808
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:22,728
It's drafty here in the lower.
My sinus, remember?

809
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:24,229
Okay.

810
00:50:39,988 --> 00:50:42,183
I better go back to the lower.

811
00:50:43,558 --> 00:50:44,582
Why?

812
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:47,524
I'm getting a nosebleed up here.
It's too high.

813
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,620
Okay. <i>Anyway</i> you want.

814
00:51:08,116 --> 00:51:10,710
- Good night, Bill.
- Good night, Junior.

815
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:15,014
Aren't you gonna open a window?

816
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:16,750
Why, are you warm?

817
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:19,793
You got to sleep with the window open.
You want to be healthy, don't you?

818
00:51:19,894 --> 00:51:21,919
I do? I mean, I do!

819
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:23,929
I'll get it.

820
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:36,333
I said open it.

821
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,288
Bill?

822
00:52:09,244 --> 00:52:11,439
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

823
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:15,378
- You closing the window?
- No. Don't you believe me?

824
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,809
I believe you, but open it.

825
00:52:30,098 --> 00:52:33,795
Gee, I hope we'll become friends
and like rooming together.

826
00:52:34,636 --> 00:52:36,797
You know, roommates and pals?

827
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:41,571
Bill, are you asleep?

828
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:23,114
Coach, that Baker kid's great.

829
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:26,381
Look at that punt, 70 yards.

830
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:30,580
Yeah, he's all right.
We've got a good chance, boys.

831
00:53:30,692 --> 00:53:33,752
I've never seen a better football player
since "Jarring" Jack Jackson played

832
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:35,386
for Ridgeville.

833
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:39,096
We got a break when they changed
the freshman ruling.

834
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:42,030
All right, you guys, over on the dummy.

835
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,297
Come on, move! On the double!

836
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,786
- Coach Wheeler?
- Yes?

837
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:01,617
I'm ready to report, sir.

838
00:54:01,723 --> 00:54:03,315
Who are you gonna report and for what?

839
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:06,951
- Me. I'm ready to play football.
- Look, I'll save you a broken neck.

840
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:09,029
The ping-pong team
needs an anchorman.

841
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,530
- But, sir...
- Look, you're too light for football.

842
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:13,464
- Sorry!
- Yeah, but you wrote me a letter,

843
00:54:13,568 --> 00:54:16,230
and it said, "Junior Jackson to report."

844
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,599
- What did you say your name was?
- Junior Jackson.

845
00:54:20,408 --> 00:54:24,037
Yes, Junior Jackson.
I didn't recognize you.

846
00:54:24,913 --> 00:54:28,508
- Must you wear glasses?
- No, sir. Only when I wanna see.

847
00:54:29,984 --> 00:54:32,043
Well, okay.
Get in with the rest of the boys.

848
00:54:32,153 --> 00:54:34,621
- We're hitting the dummy.
- Yes, sir!

849
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,018
Nice one.

850
00:54:44,165 --> 00:54:48,363
- Junior! You hurt?
- No, I'm all right. I must've stumbled.

851
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:52,428
- Here, let me help you up.
- I don't need any help. I'm all right!

852
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:01,040
Kid's like his old man. He's got guts.

853
00:55:01,749 --> 00:55:05,241
But as far as being a football player,
there the resemblance ends.

854
00:55:05,353 --> 00:55:09,050
Grass drill, running in place.
Ready? Begin!

855
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:14,091
Bring those knees up!
On your stomach! On your back!

856
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:17,024
On your stomach! On your feet!

857
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,062
On your right side, left side,
on your feet!

858
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:28,075
On your back, right side.

859
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:30,410
On your feet!

860
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,208
All right, bring those knees up! Move it!

861
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:37,943
All right,
all the backs on the chinning bar.

862
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:41,112
Linemen around the goalpost
and into the shower.

863
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:53,959
- You need any help?
- No, I can make it.

864
00:55:54,068 --> 00:55:56,730
When? The football season will be over.

865
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:02,574
- Bill?
- Yeah?

866
00:56:02,677 --> 00:56:05,009
- Is this good for me?
- Of course.

867
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:08,209
How come I'm getting nauseous?

868
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:12,314
Up on the table, son.

869
00:56:13,187 --> 00:56:15,951
- I'll take these.
- I can't see without them.

870
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:17,820
You'll be better off.

871
00:56:36,177 --> 00:56:39,044
It's all in the neck, son. All in the neck.

872
00:56:39,347 --> 00:56:41,611
Got to straighten out that spine.

873
00:56:41,716 --> 00:56:44,412
Now just relax, boy. Just relax.

874
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:48,782
Better?

875
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,582
Yeah, but what happened to the head?

876
00:56:53,461 --> 00:56:54,485
Junior?

877
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:58,222
- Junior?
- I'm in here.

878
00:57:02,904 --> 00:57:06,305
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. I'm just sitting here.

879
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:09,542
- Why?
- Why? Where can I go?

880
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:11,305
The whole body's broken.

881
00:57:11,412 --> 00:57:14,108
So I'm just sitting here,
but I ain't got nerve enough

882
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:15,739
to put my head under the water.

883
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,717
- Where does it hurt?
- Where does it hurt?

884
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,954
Where doesn't it hurt? It's easier.

885
00:57:21,055 --> 00:57:23,250
I know just the thing for you.
I'll go down to the drugstore,

886
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,154
get something
that'll fix you up in a minute.

887
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:27,193
- What is it?
- What you need is a good rubdown.

888
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,286
- I'll go get some alcohol.
- Oh, no.

889
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:32,192
Come in.

890
00:57:38,506 --> 00:57:40,269
You're Bill Baker, first year at school,

891
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,036
wear shirt size 15-and-a-half,
40-regular in jacket.

892
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:45,806
Hate ties, like soft white shirts
and haven't much money.

893
00:57:45,913 --> 00:57:48,279
What are you,
a walking department store?

894
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,976
No. Let me introduce myself. My card.

895
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:54,948
"Terry Howard, college representative
of nationally known brands.

896
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:58,389
"Buy at your convenience.
Don't come see me. I'll see you.

897
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:00,484
"Save half
by seeing Terry Howard first."

898
00:58:00,595 --> 00:58:01,687
What are you selling?

899
00:58:01,796 --> 00:58:04,230
I have here some of the finest cashmere
you've ever seen.

900
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:06,323
Just feel that material.
Crush it in your hands.

901
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:08,129
Once a girl gets a load of the cashmere

902
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:10,363
in a jacket like that,
she'll never let you alone.

903
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:12,200
Let me show you my whole line
of sports clothes.

904
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:13,295
Well, I have to go down...

905
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,272
You haven't seen the new argyles
that just came in.

906
00:58:15,376 --> 00:58:18,345
Socks to match your eyes.
Every color, every description.

907
00:58:18,446 --> 00:58:22,348
And the luscious maroon sweater I have
to go with those dark, wavy locks...

908
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,817
- A saleswoman with sex appeal, huh?
- Strictly business.

909
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:28,182
This is the way I work my way
through college.

910
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:29,688
Now what can I give you?

911
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:31,884
I don't think you have it
in that sample case.

912
00:58:31,993 --> 00:58:34,427
Just a minute.
Let's stick to business, huh?

913
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,622
I know when I'm outmatched.

914
00:58:37,698 --> 00:58:40,963
I can't afford any new clothes.
I'll see you around.

915
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:43,598
Bill? Bill?

916
00:58:45,873 --> 00:58:49,639
"Junior Jackson.
Size-nine shoe, 10-and-a-half sock

917
00:58:49,744 --> 00:58:51,609
"and 13-and-a-half shirt."

918
00:58:51,712 --> 00:58:54,237
I'm dying. I'm dying.

919
00:58:54,348 --> 00:58:56,578
- Are you Junior Jackson?
- Yeah.

920
00:58:56,684 --> 00:58:59,812
- Are you decent?
- I've always tried to live a clean life.

921
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:03,687
- No, I mean, are you in the bathtub?
- Yeah, I'm taking a bubble bath.

922
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,259
I'm Terry Howard,
college representative

923
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,624
of some of the finest manufacturers
in the country.

924
00:59:08,729 --> 00:59:11,061
For new customers,
we have an introductory offer.

925
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:14,362
These nylon swimming trunks,
absolutely no cost on your part.

926
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,992
Here, put them on.

927
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:17,263
Although I haven't seen you,

928
00:59:17,371 --> 00:59:19,839
I know you're the type
that would like a dark cashmere suit,

929
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:22,409
very suitable for eveningwear
in place of a tuxedo.

930
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,501
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

931
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:30,045
Gee, a girl saleslady.
What kind of college is this, Vassar?

932
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:31,175
A milk bath.

933
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:32,946
We have a much better product,
Pink Tonic.

934
00:59:33,054 --> 00:59:34,919
It's cheaper,
and it makes the bubbles last longer.

935
00:59:35,022 --> 00:59:36,114
Please, miss, if you don't mind...

936
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:38,624
Let me show you
these wonderful cashmere jackets.

937
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:40,626
As you can see,
this one has a belt in the back,

938
00:59:40,728 --> 00:59:42,491
and it's very sporty.

939
00:59:43,698 --> 00:59:46,132
And this dark blue
is very suitable for eveningwear

940
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,997
in place of a tuxedo.

941
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:52,365
Yes, of course,
this one is English-made.

942
00:59:52,473 --> 00:59:54,600
You have the shoulders for it, I notice.

943
00:59:54,709 --> 00:59:58,270
Please, lady, forget the clothes.
I just want to get my body back.

944
00:59:58,379 --> 01:00:01,007
There's no obligation on your part,
so let me finish.

945
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:02,912
Of course, it's hard to tell
what you would wear.

946
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:05,918
- I haven't much to go on, you know.
- Look, miss...

947
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,783
You can call me Terry.
You're Junior Jackson.

948
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:09,181
How do you know?

949
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:12,157
I have a line on every new student
who comes here to school.

950
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,694
- Do you do this for a gag?
- Not at all.

951
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:17,127
You see, it's the only way
I can get my education.

952
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:20,359
Some girls are waitresses.
I'm a salesgirl. I prefer it.

953
01:00:20,468 --> 01:00:22,629
Anyway, it helps me
in my psychology training.

954
01:00:22,737 --> 01:00:26,605
- You see, I'm a psychology major.
- Gee, I wish I had your spirit.

955
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:30,011
I'm glad to meet a girl like you. Oh.

956
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:32,341
Oh, just happen to have
the thing for you.

957
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:35,176
This striped robe,
marked down from $45 to $22.

958
01:00:35,316 --> 01:00:37,682
Well, it just so happens I need a robe,

959
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:40,453
but you'll have to leave the room.

960
01:00:49,697 --> 01:00:50,755
Bill.

961
01:00:51,098 --> 01:00:52,258
- See you at the house, Bill.
- Hi.

962
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:53,390
All right. Hi.

963
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:55,492
How come
I haven't seen you around lately?

964
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:56,763
Football season.

965
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:58,668
What's the matter?
Don't you ever relax?

966
01:00:58,773 --> 01:01:01,640
- Sometimes.
- Well, why don't you try it some night?

967
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:04,108
Say, tonight, for instance.
I'm not doing anything.

968
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:05,542
Now, look, Terry,

969
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:08,479
I know you're about as good-looking
as they come on this campus,

970
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:12,313
but I also know there are three things
that'd stop a guy from playing football.

971
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,220
That's being with a dame,
going with a dame and liking a dame.

972
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:18,556
So I'll see you around.

973
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,128
Nine tennis sneakers, size 10.
One dozen silk ties.

974
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:33,002
- Nine tennis sneakers...
- Three socks, size eight-and-a-half.

975
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,936
One dozen argyles,
size nine-and-a-half.

976
01:01:39,046 --> 01:01:43,415
One dozen V-neck sweaters,
formerly $8, on sale for $9.

977
01:01:44,018 --> 01:01:46,282
Formerly $8, on sale for $9?

978
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:49,149
The price of living's gone up all over.

979
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:53,717
Junior, you've been a great help to me.
I can't thank you enough.

980
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:56,887
- Terry, will you tell me something?
- What?

981
01:01:57,431 --> 01:02:02,027
- How does someone become like you?
- Don't try. I'd rather be rich like you.

982
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:06,131
No, I mean, you have
so much confidence in yourself.

983
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:10,268
It's all a matter of ego, Junior.
That's what psychology teaches you.

984
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:11,845
- Ego?
- Sure.

985
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:15,046
You see, Junior,
you've got to believe in yourself.

986
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,083
You've got to keep saying
over and over to yourself,

987
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:19,652
"I'm big! I'm big!" Now say it.

988
01:02:19,754 --> 01:02:20,778
I'm big.

989
01:02:20,888 --> 01:02:24,790
No, no, no, Junior. Believe it.
Out, out. Throw your chest out.

990
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,689
- It's difficult for me. I'm skinny.
- Well, spiritually, then.

991
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,625
Put your shoulders back.
Walk up and down. Be cocky.

992
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:34,701
Say, "I'm big! I'm big! You hear me?
I'm big."

993
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:36,997
I'm big. I'm big. You hear me?

994
01:02:38,773 --> 01:02:39,967
I'm big?

995
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:47,438
Well, it's a start in the right direction.
And that's what you've got to believe.

996
01:02:47,548 --> 01:02:48,981
And I'll help you.

997
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:52,849
You'll sort of be my guinea pig
in my psychology experiments.

998
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:54,385
Guinea pig?

999
01:03:00,294 --> 01:03:01,488
Come in.

1000
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,823
- Who is it?
- It's me, Junior.

1001
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:07,666
- Well, come on in!
- I can't. Help me!

1002
01:03:12,106 --> 01:03:13,334
Well, why can't...

1003
01:03:15,176 --> 01:03:16,643
What is this?

1004
01:03:16,811 --> 01:03:19,279
Christmas is months away.
What are you doing?

1005
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,816
- I just had a date with Terry.
- You'd better stop seeing that dame.

1006
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:24,544
We won't have any room to sleep here.

1007
01:03:24,652 --> 01:03:27,644
Oh, no, Bill. She's wonderful
and so good for my ego.

1008
01:03:27,755 --> 01:03:30,451
The least I could do
was buy some things.

1009
01:03:31,826 --> 01:03:35,193
Look at this dressing jacket I bought.
It can also be used for grouse hunting.

1010
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:37,321
You know, it's reversible.

1011
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:40,261
Of course,
you have to live in England for it.

1012
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:41,766
But it's practical.

1013
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:43,336
Of course. Where's the monocle?

1014
01:03:43,437 --> 01:03:46,838
Oh, she didn't have any in stock,
but she's ordering it. It's due next week.

1015
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:48,067
Grand.

1016
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,739
- Bill.
- What?

1017
01:03:56,817 --> 01:03:58,648
I'll tell you a secret.

1018
01:03:59,386 --> 01:04:01,877
- Go ahead.
- I think I'm stuck on Terry.

1019
01:04:01,989 --> 01:04:03,183
I'd have never guessed it.

1020
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,225
Yeah, she's the first girl I ever had
that took a personal interest in me.

1021
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:09,854
She certainly took a personal interest
in you, all right.

1022
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,227
- Would you do me a favor?
- Well, it all depends.

1023
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,860
Did you ever hear
of Cyrano de Bergerac?

1024
01:04:16,971 --> 01:04:20,065
Cyrano de Bergerac?
Didn't he play end for Cornell?

1025
01:04:20,174 --> 01:04:23,268
No. He was a character
in a very famous play,

1026
01:04:23,377 --> 01:04:25,277
and he had a big nose,
and he was very ugly,

1027
01:04:25,379 --> 01:04:28,280
and he sent his best friend
to talk for him to the girl he loved,

1028
01:04:28,382 --> 01:04:30,407
because he was very self-conscious
about his nose.

1029
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:33,043
- So?
- So I'm in worse shape than Cyrano.

1030
01:04:33,154 --> 01:04:35,179
I'm self-conscious about all of me.

1031
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:37,120
So I thought if you could go over
and see Terry

1032
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:39,158
and tell her how I feel about her...

1033
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:41,754
Why me?

1034
01:04:42,196 --> 01:04:44,528
Well, because you have an easy way
with the women,

1035
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:46,896
and you're a big football hero.

1036
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:49,899
Would you do that for me, Bill?
You just got to.

1037
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:51,403
Why must I just got to?

1038
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,933
Look at all this stuff.
I'm running out of money!

1039
01:05:01,348 --> 01:05:02,542
Come in.

1040
01:05:03,584 --> 01:05:05,051
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi.

1041
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:07,217
What can I do for you?
You need some shirts?

1042
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,915
- Always selling, aren't you?
- Well, a gal's got to live.

1043
01:05:10,024 --> 01:05:11,048
Oh, you sure are living.

1044
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,592
I just brought over a check
for the stuff you sold Junior.

1045
01:05:13,694 --> 01:05:15,855
When you gonna stop
selling him clothes?

1046
01:05:15,963 --> 01:05:17,954
Well, he needed clothes badly.

1047
01:05:18,065 --> 01:05:20,465
And I see you did all right
for yourself, too.

1048
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:22,832
I always say a man
can't have too many clothes.

1049
01:05:22,937 --> 01:05:23,904
What do you always say?

1050
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,063
I always say
I think the kid's stuck on you.

1051
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:28,334
- You're kidding.
- Well, who else but a guy in love

1052
01:05:28,442 --> 01:05:29,932
would buy 15 pairs of shoes
in one week

1053
01:05:30,044 --> 01:05:31,875
and all of them tennis sneakers?

1054
01:05:31,979 --> 01:05:35,506
I'm interested in Junior
as a psychological study.

1055
01:05:35,783 --> 01:05:38,479
- He's sort of snooky, you know.
- Yeah, but he's a great guy.

1056
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:40,417
You'd be lucky to get somebody
like him.

1057
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:41,510
What do you mean?

1058
01:05:41,622 --> 01:05:43,852
Trouble with you dames is,
you have no vision.

1059
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:46,256
Most of you go for a big, husky,
broad-shouldered,

1060
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,089
good-looking, football-hero type.

1061
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:49,184
So?

1062
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,388
Some day, Junior's gonna be like that.

1063
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:52,863
- Bill.
- Yes?

1064
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:56,294
How long do you think it'll take him?

1065
01:05:56,403 --> 01:05:59,099
- Take him quite a while.
- To be like you?

1066
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,774
- Yes.
- Well, why should I wait, then?

1067
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:11,115
"Dear folks, it seems hard to realize

1068
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,812
"that a month has gone by
since I left home.

1069
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:15,946
"I like Ridgeville pretty much.

1070
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,490
"I'm rooming with a swell fellow,
Bill Baker,

1071
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:20,492
"who was in our graduating class.

1072
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:23,427
- "He's been very nice to me. I..."
- He ought to be.

1073
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,226
- What did you say, dear?
- Nothing. Go on.

1074
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:29,131
"I also like a girl named Terry Howard.

1075
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:32,399
"She's very unusual
and has a forceful personality.

1076
01:06:32,506 --> 01:06:34,167
"I think Dad will like her."

1077
01:06:34,275 --> 01:06:36,607
I thought he liked Doc Hunter's girl,
Babs.

1078
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:37,938
Well, kids that age are fickle.

1079
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:40,605
Besides, she's here,
and he's at college.

1080
01:06:40,714 --> 01:06:43,774
Let's forget about his love life.
Go on with the more important things.

1081
01:06:43,884 --> 01:06:47,877
"Tell Dad that much to my surprise
I'm still on the football squad.

1082
01:06:47,988 --> 01:06:49,319
"I can't understand it,

1083
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:52,654
"because try as I might,
I'm not improving fast enough.

1084
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,456
"The coach doesn't like me
or dislike me.

1085
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:58,424
"He just seems nervous
when I'm around.

1086
01:06:58,532 --> 01:07:01,296
"But I hardly think
he'll let me in the first game,

1087
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:03,836
"so there's no reason
for you and Dad to come up.

1088
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:06,997
"I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can.

1089
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,597
"Love, Junior."

1090
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:11,333
I miss the boy.

1091
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,204
You'll get a chance
to see him this weekend

1092
01:07:13,314 --> 01:07:14,679
when we go up for the game.

1093
01:07:14,782 --> 01:07:17,307
Oh, but it says he doesn't think
he'll get in the game.

1094
01:07:17,418 --> 01:07:18,385
Yeah?

1095
01:07:18,485 --> 01:07:21,511
Well, "Jarring" Jack Jackson's son
will be in that first game,

1096
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,453
I can promise you that!

1097
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:26,082
May! Oh, May!

1098
01:07:39,373 --> 01:07:42,501
R-I, D-G,

1099
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,377
E-V,

1100
01:07:45,212 --> 01:07:46,440
l-L,

1101
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:48,241
L-E,

1102
01:07:49,283 --> 01:07:52,218
Ridgeville! Ridgeville!

1103
01:07:52,886 --> 01:07:57,448
Go, Ridgeville!

1104
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:05,622
All right, men. Attention!

1105
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:09,567
I want you to meet Ridgeville's
most distinguished alumnus.

1106
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,535
He's gonna say a few words to you.

1107
01:08:11,638 --> 01:08:14,402
This is the famous
"Jarring" Jack Jackson!

1108
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:20,445
Men, I'm going to be short
and to the point.

1109
01:08:20,914 --> 01:08:23,883
I just had three rules
when I played football.

1110
01:08:24,952 --> 01:08:27,682
You hit them fast, you hit them low,

1111
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:30,216
you hit them hard.

1112
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:33,353
And if they get up, you hit them again.

1113
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:36,157
So let's get out on that field

1114
01:08:36,597 --> 01:08:38,588
and play "guts" football.

1115
01:08:38,932 --> 01:08:42,368
Remember,
you're playing for Ridgeville.

1116
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:46,797
So, good luck to you all,
and let them have it!

1117
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:50,205
Come on, let's go!

1118
01:09:04,358 --> 01:09:05,985
Wait a minute, Junior.
I want to talk to you.

1119
01:09:06,093 --> 01:09:08,459
- But, Dad, I better get out there.
- This'll only take a minute.

1120
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:11,895
Junior, you can make this
the happiest day in my life

1121
01:09:11,999 --> 01:09:14,593
if you'll just get out there
and really play football.

1122
01:09:14,701 --> 01:09:16,396
I don't even know
if I'll get in the game, Dad.

1123
01:09:16,503 --> 01:09:18,471
Don't worry.
I have a feeling that you will.

1124
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:21,040
- Well, I hope so. I better get out there.
- Wait a minute, Junior.

1125
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:23,166
You know, you're not gonna
just run out on the field

1126
01:09:23,277 --> 01:09:24,539
like the rest of the players.

1127
01:09:24,645 --> 01:09:26,875
- You're gonna make an entrance.
- What do you mean, sir?

1128
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,380
Well, you see this old number 66?

1129
01:09:30,784 --> 01:09:32,649
That's your dad's old jersey.

1130
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:34,948
When I quit playing football
20 years ago,

1131
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:37,853
they retired that number,
and nobody has worn it until now.

1132
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:40,426
You're gonna put this on
and really make an entrance

1133
01:09:40,527 --> 01:09:42,256
in this jersey, Son.

1134
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,826
Those people out on the field are gonna
see another Jackson coming out,

1135
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:48,458
wearing old number 66
to play for good old Ridgeville.

1136
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:51,265
- How do you feel, Son?
- Isn't it a little large, Dad?

1137
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:52,998
Well, tuck it in.

1138
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,837
And remember,
live up to old number 66.

1139
01:09:57,478 --> 01:10:00,936
Old "Jarring" Jack Jackson's number.
Now, go to it, boy!

1140
01:10:08,322 --> 01:10:09,687
<i>Good afternoon, sports fans.</i>

1141
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,815
<i>This is Tom Harmon speaking to you</i>
<i>from the stadium</i>

1142
01:10:11,925 --> 01:10:13,483
<i>where today we'll bring you the game</i>

1143
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:16,062
<i>between Ridgeville</i>
<i>and Thornton University.</i>

1144
01:10:16,163 --> 01:10:18,688
<i>The ballgame today, of course,</i>
<i>is the opening of the season,</i>

1145
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:21,927
<i>and it promises to be</i>
<i>a whale of a football game.</i>

1146
01:10:22,503 --> 01:10:24,334
<i>The captains return to their teams.</i>

1147
01:10:24,438 --> 01:10:27,339
<i>And they're now getting</i>
<i>their final instructions from the coach.</i>

1148
01:10:27,441 --> 01:10:30,205
<i>There they go to line up for the kickoff.</i>

1149
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,540
<i>Jones will kick off for Thornton.</i>

1150
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:33,670
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

1151
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:37,113
<i>And back in the receiving position</i>
<i>for Ridgeville is Tom Edwards</i>

1152
01:10:37,217 --> 01:10:40,482
<i>and Bill Baker,</i>
<i>Ridgeville's All-American candidate.</i>

1153
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:43,054
<i>Jones signals. The ball clubs get ready.</i>

1154
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,250
<i>He approaches the ball,</i>
<i>it's a long end-over-end kick</i>

1155
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,658
<i>going way down field.</i>
<i>It's going to Baker.</i>

1156
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:51,731
<i>He takes it on the seven-yard line.</i>
<i>He's at the 10, the 20,</i>

1157
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:54,562
<i>picks up some nice blocks.</i>
<i>He's at the 35.</i>

1158
01:10:59,473 --> 01:11:01,065
<i>Straight arms two tacklers.</i>

1159
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,234
<i>He's going to go all the way!</i>
<i>He's on the two-yard line</i>

1160
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,177
<i>and rolls into the end zone</i>
<i>for a touchdown!</i>

1161
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:10,448
<i>It certainly seems apparent</i>
<i>that if this Baker boy</i>

1162
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:14,146
<i>continues to spark the Ridgeville team,</i>
<i>as he has done today, all season,</i>

1163
01:11:14,254 --> 01:11:16,722
<i>the playoff for the Rose Bowl</i>
<i>will be between Ridgeville</i>

1164
01:11:16,823 --> 01:11:18,848
<i>and that great</i>
<i>University of California team.</i>

1165
01:11:18,959 --> 01:11:21,223
Did you see that run, Jack?
You couldn't have done it better.

1166
01:11:21,328 --> 01:11:22,625
Very good. Very good.

1167
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:25,724
When you gonna send Junior in?

1168
01:11:28,435 --> 01:11:31,131
<i>The teams are lining up</i>
<i>for the extra point now.</i>

1169
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:33,798
<i>Smith will hold and Baker will kick.</i>

1170
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:36,905
Get set. One, two, three!

1171
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:40,673
<i>There's the pass from center,</i>
<i>and it's good!</i>

1172
01:11:40,781 --> 01:11:43,181
<i>Ridgeville leads seven to nothing.</i>

1173
01:11:43,483 --> 01:11:45,849
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I always like to be pretty conservative</i>

1174
01:11:45,953 --> 01:11:47,215
<i>when I talk about football,</i>

1175
01:11:47,321 --> 01:11:49,812
<i>but I certainly would like</i>
<i>to make a prediction here.</i>

1176
01:11:49,923 --> 01:11:52,357
<i>This Ridgeville club certainly looks</i>
<i>like the greatest team</i>

1177
01:11:52,459 --> 01:11:54,791
<i>that they've had in 20 years. And why?</i>

1178
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:57,455
<i>Simply because of one man, Bill Baker.</i>

1179
01:11:57,598 --> 01:12:00,260
<i>That boy's an All-American</i>
<i>if I've ever seen one.</i>

1180
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:03,669
All right, Coach, how about Junior?

1181
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:08,203
- Okay, Jackson, get in.
- Me?

1182
01:12:14,648 --> 01:12:16,878
<i>Wait a minute. There's a substitution.</i>

1183
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:18,679
<i>They're taking Baker</i>
<i>out of the ballgame,</i>

1184
01:12:18,785 --> 01:12:20,082
<i>and I certainly don't blame them.</i>

1185
01:12:20,187 --> 01:12:24,146
<i>There's no sense in risking an injury</i>
<i>with that boy at this time.</i>

1186
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:28,723
<i>The substitute for Bill Baker is number</i>

1187
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:30,858
<i>sixty-six.</i>

1188
01:12:31,465 --> 01:12:32,898
<i>Number 66?</i>

1189
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:35,701
Let's try K-97 on two.

1190
01:12:36,236 --> 01:12:37,328
That's a pleasant play.

1191
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:42,238
We might enjoy ourselves with that one,
unless you'd rather have K-97 on four.

1192
01:12:42,342 --> 01:12:46,301
That's a little more strenuous,
but we might get through with it.

1193
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,378
No, we'd better do K-97 on two.

1194
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,250
On two. Break!

1195
01:12:52,252 --> 01:12:54,447
<i>They're out of the huddle now.</i>

1196
01:12:55,155 --> 01:12:57,350
Fellas, I have a better idea.

1197
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,357
I'm sorry. Will you come back?

1198
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:05,594
<i>They're back in the huddle again.</i>

1199
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:09,899
Take it easy, Coach. Take it easy.
The boy will come through.

1200
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:17,276
You'll have to excuse us,
but this is private.

1201
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:23,275
<i>Jackson's apparently having</i>
<i>a little trouble with his signal.</i>

1202
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,812
My heavens, you're nosey.

1203
01:13:30,123 --> 01:13:31,317
Come on.

1204
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:34,486
Delaying the game!

1205
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:39,523
<i>Ridgeville penalized five yards</i>
<i>for delaying the game.</i>

1206
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,358
<i>It's now third down, 20 yards to go.</i>

1207
01:13:42,469 --> 01:13:45,495
<i>Ridgeville's ball</i>
<i>on Thornton's 47-yard line.</i>

1208
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,197
Take it easy, Coach.
Take it easy, Coach.

1209
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:49,298
The boy will come through.

1210
01:13:53,313 --> 01:13:56,476
Spread flanker left, spread flanker right.

1211
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:59,347
B.G. Opposite, two lead swing,

1212
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,654
thirty-six A.O. On four.

1213
01:14:01,755 --> 01:14:03,382
On four. Break!

1214
01:14:03,657 --> 01:14:05,852
<i>Ridgeville comes out of the huddle.</i>

1215
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:08,655
<i>They go into an unusual</i>
<i>spread formation.</i>

1216
01:14:09,162 --> 01:14:11,824
- <i>No blockers.</i>
- One, two, three, four, five.

1217
01:14:11,932 --> 01:14:14,162
<i>The ball is snapped. Jackson has it.</i>

1218
01:14:14,267 --> 01:14:17,100
<i>He's smothered back</i>
<i>on his own 45-yard line!</i>

1219
01:14:22,642 --> 01:14:25,907
<i>He fumbles.</i>
<i>There's a big pile-up down on the field.</i>

1220
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,038
<i>I believe, yes, they did,</i>
<i>Thornton recovered the fumble.</i>

1221
01:14:37,457 --> 01:14:39,584
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>so far in this ballgame,</i>

1222
01:14:39,693 --> 01:14:43,322
<i>young Jackson has not been</i>
<i>anything like his father, believe me.</i>

1223
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:45,193
<i>But then, too,</i>
<i>Thornton's had their troubles.</i>

1224
01:14:45,298 --> 01:14:47,994
<i>They're now going to have to go</i>
<i>into punt formation and kick.</i>

1225
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:51,935
<i>It's Phillips back in punt formation.</i>
<i>There's the snap from center.</i>

1226
01:14:52,038 --> 01:14:55,132
<i>Gets off a long spiral kick</i>
<i>that comes down the field.</i>

1227
01:14:55,242 --> 01:14:58,006
<i>Jackson waits for it on the 20-yard line.</i>

1228
01:14:58,478 --> 01:14:59,877
<i>And he's caught it.</i>

1229
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,577
<i>There he goes!</i>

1230
01:15:01,681 --> 01:15:05,014
<i>He's at the 25, the 30,</i>
<i>the 35. He's at midfield.</i>

1231
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,582
<i>A Thornton man has grabbed him</i>
<i>with a necktie tackle,</i>

1232
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,658
<i>but Jackson is still on his feet.</i>

1233
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:15,751
<i>Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>
<i>Jackson is running the wrong way!</i>

1234
01:15:15,862 --> 01:15:19,320
<i>He's at the Thornton 40, the 30,</i>
<i>the 10, the five.</i>

1235
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,900
<i>Hit by his own man</i>
<i>on the five-yard line and fumbles,</i>

1236
01:15:22,002 --> 01:15:23,731
<i>and Thornton recovers for a touchdown!</i>

1237
01:15:23,837 --> 01:15:25,634
<i>Listen to that crowd boo.</i>

1238
01:15:35,348 --> 01:15:38,374
Get in there and take that...
That kid's place!

1239
01:15:39,219 --> 01:15:41,915
<i>Well, folks, they're taking</i>
<i>Junior Jackson out of the ballgame</i>

1240
01:15:42,022 --> 01:15:44,183
<i>and putting Bill Baker back in.</i>

1241
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,883
<i>Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1242
01:15:45,992 --> 01:15:48,825
<i>Junior Jackson</i>
<i>is nothing like his father.</i>

1243
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:54,089
<i>He'll win ballgames, perhaps,</i>
<i>but I'm afraid for the other team.</i>

1244
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:06,973
This has been the worst day of my life.

1245
01:16:07,614 --> 01:16:11,641
- How could my own son do this to me?
- It's not all Junior's fault.

1246
01:16:11,785 --> 01:16:12,843
Ann,

1247
01:16:13,587 --> 01:16:16,385
you see before you
the mere shell of a man.

1248
01:16:17,691 --> 01:16:21,149
A man who's devoted his entire life
to his child,

1249
01:16:22,028 --> 01:16:23,859
and look what happens.

1250
01:16:24,397 --> 01:16:27,059
He makes a touchdown
for the other team.

1251
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:32,002
- Is there no justice?
- Oh, don't be so dramatic.

1252
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,630
It's only a football game.

1253
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:36,538
Only a football game?

1254
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:39,610
Out there
in front of all of my old classmates,

1255
01:16:39,713 --> 01:16:41,647
in front of 20,000 students,

1256
01:16:41,748 --> 01:16:45,616
the son of "Jarring" Jack Jackson
disgraces himself.

1257
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:50,450
- Is there anything worse?
- Yes, he could've been a criminal.

1258
01:16:51,124 --> 01:16:53,058
That wouldn't have been so bad.

1259
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:56,686
Then at least we could've
sent him away and no one would know.

1260
01:16:57,063 --> 01:17:00,829
Jack, I'm not going to stand here
and have you berate Junior.

1261
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:03,435
- He probably feels bad enough.
- Ann,

1262
01:17:04,771 --> 01:17:07,137
are you sure he's our son?

1263
01:17:07,307 --> 01:17:11,175
- Stop it, Jack. He was born at home.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

1264
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:14,680
I haven't even got the satisfaction
of thinking

1265
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:18,012
they might have switched him on us
in the hospital.

1266
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:30,321
Junior Jackson!

1267
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,364
What are you doing
in this empty stadium at night

1268
01:17:32,465 --> 01:17:35,366
without your coat on?
You'll catch your death of cold.

1269
01:17:35,468 --> 01:17:36,662
I'm sorry, Mother.

1270
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:41,568
Junior, I'm worried about you.
Do you still want to play football?

1271
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:45,278
I like it,
but I guess I'll never get a chance now.

1272
01:17:45,378 --> 01:17:49,610
The coach will drop me from the squad.
Gee, today, I disgraced everybody.

1273
01:17:50,517 --> 01:17:53,509
Son, listen to me.
You were at a disadvantage.

1274
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:57,021
It isn't the easiest thing in the world
to be the son of a great athlete.

1275
01:17:57,123 --> 01:18:00,388
A prominent father
is the biggest drawback a boy can have.

1276
01:18:00,493 --> 01:18:01,585
Don't I know!

1277
01:18:01,695 --> 01:18:04,562
So from now on,
your father will not dominate you.

1278
01:18:04,664 --> 01:18:06,598
You'll be left alone
to make your own decisions.

1279
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:07,724
I'll see to that.

1280
01:18:07,834 --> 01:18:11,235
You're going to stop playing football,
take up your regular studies,

1281
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:13,602
and you're going to shower
and have dinner immediately.

1282
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:14,696
But I don't want to...

1283
01:18:14,808 --> 01:18:16,639
From now on,
you have nothing to worry about.

1284
01:18:16,743 --> 01:18:18,938
You can make up your own mind.

1285
01:18:19,312 --> 01:18:20,745
You're a man.

1286
01:18:21,014 --> 01:18:22,572
Come along, Son.

1287
01:18:23,183 --> 01:18:24,514
Yes, ma'am.

1288
01:18:26,486 --> 01:18:29,148
Bill, Mr. Jackson wants to talk to you.

1289
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:32,755
Be seeing you, Jack, and thanks.

1290
01:18:33,693 --> 01:18:35,217
Sit down, Bill.

1291
01:18:36,029 --> 01:18:38,429
Played a great game
this afternoon, boy.

1292
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:41,398
- You reminded me a little of me.
- Thank you.

1293
01:18:41,501 --> 01:18:44,629
Of course you can't pass like me,
or run like me.

1294
01:18:45,038 --> 01:18:49,600
You don't hit the line like I used to,
but you reminded me a little of me.

1295
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:53,643
- Well, there'll never be another you, sir.
- Thank you, son.

1296
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,772
Bill, you remember the proposition
I made you?

1297
01:18:58,785 --> 01:19:01,811
Coach Wheeler is dropping Junior
from the squad,

1298
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:05,157
but our deal is still on.

1299
01:19:05,358 --> 01:19:08,418
But, Mr. Jackson, you don't understand.
I like living with Junior.

1300
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:11,053
- We're getting to be great friends.
- You don't have to pretend.

1301
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:13,564
- But I'm not pretending.
- I understand, Bill.

1302
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:17,158
You're loyal, and you're just trying
to make it easier for me.

1303
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:21,172
Your father should be a very happy man.
I know that I would be.

1304
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:25,038
And, Bill,
you'll still get my check every month.

1305
01:19:25,145 --> 01:19:28,012
You've lived up to your part
of the bargain.

1306
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:31,775
That's very generous of you, sir, but...
Well, thank you.

1307
01:19:36,222 --> 01:19:37,553
- Coach?
- Yes, Bill?

1308
01:19:37,657 --> 01:19:40,717
I was just talking to Mr. Jackson.
You can't drop Junior.

1309
01:19:40,827 --> 01:19:42,419
Why not? Didn't he say it was okay?

1310
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:45,054
Well, it might be okay with him,
but it's not okay with me.

1311
01:19:45,165 --> 01:19:47,633
You got to give him another chance.

1312
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:54,133
- Now wait a minute.
- Either Junior plays, or I don't play.

1313
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,798
- But you don't...
- That's the way I want it.

1314
01:19:55,909 --> 01:19:57,672
Now what do you say?

1315
01:19:58,912 --> 01:20:01,847
It's getting tougher to be a coach
every day.

1316
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:06,280
Okay, but you'd better be good
next Saturday.

1317
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,683
Because with your methods,
you got to have a lot of talent.

1318
01:20:08,788 --> 01:20:10,619
Don't worry, I got it.

1319
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:17,287
Terry, I tell you I'm through
double-crossing Junior.

1320
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:18,386
Now take it easy, Bill.

1321
01:20:18,498 --> 01:20:21,092
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You talked me out of it once before.

1322
01:20:21,201 --> 01:20:22,759
I'm through being a heel.
I'm gonna tell him.

1323
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:24,268
But it's so bad for his ego.

1324
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:27,032
Never mind his ego.
It's more honest this way.

1325
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,108
Okay, but I'll handle it.

1326
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:31,239
I want to break it to him gently.

1327
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:33,335
I don't want to shatter his confidence
in himself.

1328
01:20:33,446 --> 01:20:36,506
- When are you gonna tell him?
- The next time I see him.

1329
01:20:36,616 --> 01:20:39,176
Good. It's the only fair thing to do.

1330
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,945
Terry, can I come in a minute?

1331
01:20:43,056 --> 01:20:45,217
Where am I gonna hide?
I don't want him to find me here.

1332
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:47,190
- Quick. In the closet.
- You be sure you tell him.

1333
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:49,158
Leave everything to me.

1334
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:59,299
I just came over to say goodbye.
I'm leaving school.

1335
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:01,670
Leaving school? Why?

1336
01:21:02,242 --> 01:21:04,005
I ran out of reasons.

1337
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:08,046
Today on the football field,
I disgraced my father and the team.

1338
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:12,315
Now I'm being dominated by my mother
and she's almost as bad as my father.

1339
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:15,012
I shouldn't have come to Ridgeville
in the first place.

1340
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:17,180
Sit down, Junior. Let's talk this out.

1341
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,724
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm a failure.

1342
01:21:19,826 --> 01:21:21,589
Don't get excited, Junior.

1343
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:24,219
Something will turn up to give you
your confidence back.

1344
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,354
No, I'm a failure.

1345
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:28,127
The only reason Bill lived with me
is because he felt sorry for me,

1346
01:21:28,234 --> 01:21:30,634
and you tried to help
because you're a nice person.

1347
01:21:30,737 --> 01:21:34,264
Besides, I'm a good customer.
No, I'm leaving school.

1348
01:21:34,374 --> 01:21:37,639
But, Junior, if you leave school,
I'll feel very bad.

1349
01:21:38,344 --> 01:21:40,437
- You will?
- Yes.

1350
01:21:41,114 --> 01:21:43,048
I like you for yourself.

1351
01:21:44,017 --> 01:21:45,780
- You do?
- Well, sure.

1352
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,718
And I think if you stick it out,

1353
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:52,280
you'll be able to prove to your father
and to everybody that you're a man.

1354
01:21:53,226 --> 01:21:55,285
Well, I could do it, Terry, if...

1355
01:21:56,763 --> 01:21:58,355
- lf...
- Yes?

1356
01:21:59,299 --> 01:22:01,426
If I had a girl like you behind me.

1357
01:22:01,534 --> 01:22:04,867
I mean, if I thought that you thought
I was somebody.

1358
01:22:05,104 --> 01:22:06,969
Well, I do think you are.

1359
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,732
You know, Terry, I've been stuck on you

1360
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:12,572
since the first day you sold me the robe
when I was in the bubble-bath.

1361
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:16,809
Well, I liked you, too, Junior,
but I've got to tell you about Bill and me.

1362
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:19,043
Oh, no, we can talk about Bill
some other time.

1363
01:22:19,152 --> 01:22:21,677
If you wear my fraternity pin,
I won't leave school.

1364
01:22:21,788 --> 01:22:25,417
- Well, how will that help?
- Well, it'll give me a reason to stay.

1365
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:29,151
It'll be a little victory,
and it'll restore my confidence.

1366
01:22:29,262 --> 01:22:30,786
That's what you said I needed.

1367
01:22:30,897 --> 01:22:33,627
Just wear it a little while
and see if you like it.

1368
01:22:33,733 --> 01:22:37,430
Well, okay, but on one condition,
that you won't leave school.

1369
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:39,596
Oh, no, I won't. I'm a new man.

1370
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:43,642
I'm a tiger. I'm big.
You're wearing my fraternity pin. I'm big!

1371
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,578
Well, you certainly told him.

1372
01:22:52,685 --> 01:22:56,212
What did you expect me to do
with everybody browbeating him?

1373
01:22:56,322 --> 01:22:57,846
He needed someone to turn to,

1374
01:22:57,957 --> 01:22:59,720
and this was no time
to sell him more shirts.

1375
01:22:59,826 --> 01:23:02,386
- What about you and me?
- We'll have to wait.

1376
01:23:02,495 --> 01:23:03,689
I'll have to be Junior's girl,

1377
01:23:03,796 --> 01:23:05,821
until he builds up his confidence
in himself.

1378
01:23:05,932 --> 01:23:08,230
- But you love me.
- Of course.

1379
01:23:08,768 --> 01:23:12,397
- This is just for Junior.
- Okay. Just for Junior.

1380
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:27,248
- I can't go on with this.
- Sure you can, Junior. It's all for you.

1381
01:23:27,353 --> 01:23:30,186
Yeah, Junior, it's all for you.
Come on, once more.

1382
01:23:37,497 --> 01:23:38,896
I told you to crouch. Crouch.

1383
01:23:38,998 --> 01:23:41,364
I told you a million times,
use your body, your knees.

1384
01:23:41,467 --> 01:23:44,595
- I can't go on with this.
- Sure you can, Junior. It's all for you.

1385
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:48,333
Yeah, Junior, it's all for you.
Come on, we'll try it once more.

1386
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:03,480
Set! One, two, three, four, five!

1387
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:20,396
Now?

1388
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:23,335
Not now.

1389
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:28,277
Sit down! Sit down!

1390
01:24:35,555 --> 01:24:37,022
Kick the ball.

1391
01:24:51,871 --> 01:24:54,567
Set! One, two, three, four!

1392
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:10,954
Good kick, Junior.
You're developing into a great kicker.

1393
01:25:11,057 --> 01:25:12,786
Yeah, and I'm getting
more confidence, too.

1394
01:25:12,892 --> 01:25:14,257
Maybe I'll get in the homecoming game.

1395
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,918
Sure you will. Now don't you feel better?

1396
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:19,088
Oh, sure, and I owe it all to you two,
my best friends.

1397
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,030
- I'll always be grateful to you for this.
- That's okay.

1398
01:25:22,135 --> 01:25:24,103
It's all for you, Junior.

1399
01:25:36,582 --> 01:25:37,606
Now?

1400
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:39,845
Not now.

1401
01:25:41,154 --> 01:25:43,748
Sit down! Sit down!

1402
01:26:03,142 --> 01:26:06,134
<i>Stand up and cheer for Ridgeville</i>

1403
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:09,305

1404
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,349

Coach! Coach!

1433
01:27:19,051 --> 01:27:22,646
We want Coach Wheeler!
We want Coach Wheeler!

1434
01:27:27,927 --> 01:27:30,521
We've come a long way
since the beginning of the season.

1435
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:33,929
I want to thank the student body
for being with us all the way.

1436
01:27:34,033 --> 01:27:35,330
We've got to break up now,

1437
01:27:35,434 --> 01:27:37,732
because I want the boys
to get a good night's sleep.

1438
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:41,000
Yeah, team! Yeah, team! Yeah!

1439
01:27:47,413 --> 01:27:49,847
Hey, Bill, the coach told me
I might get in the game tomorrow

1440
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:50,916
for a few seconds.

1441
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:52,712
- That's great.
- And I owe it all to you.

1442
01:27:52,818 --> 01:27:54,683
I'll never be able to tell you
how grateful I am.

1443
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:55,879
Forget it. We're pals.

1444
01:27:55,988 --> 01:27:57,853
Well, that's why I want you to be
the first to know.

1445
01:27:57,957 --> 01:27:58,946
Know what?

1446
01:27:59,058 --> 01:28:01,049
After the game tomorrow,
I'm throwing a little party.

1447
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,993
I'm gonna introduce Terry to my folks,
and if they like one another,

1448
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,758
you never can tell, Bill,
you might be my best man.

1449
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:09,596
- You mean...
- Yeah, aren't you happy about the idea?

1450
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:11,192
Yeah, I think it's real great.

1451
01:28:11,304 --> 01:28:15,741
I'm only sorry I can't be with you,
but I have a party of my own to go to.

1452
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:17,001
Hey, Bill.

1453
01:28:28,788 --> 01:28:31,279
- Who is it?
- It's me. Your boyfriend.

1454
01:28:39,632 --> 01:28:41,657
Bill, what are you doing here?
It's after hours.

1455
01:28:41,767 --> 01:28:45,225
Just come up to congratulate the bride.
Hope you and Junior...

1456
01:28:45,338 --> 01:28:46,362
What are you talking about?

1457
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:48,736
You've been drinking,
and it's the night before the game!

1458
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:52,937
So what? Besides, drunk or sober,
I know when I'm being double-crossed.

1459
01:28:53,045 --> 01:28:54,137
What's come over you?

1460
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,373
You ought to know.
You planned it that way.

1461
01:28:56,482 --> 01:28:59,178
Me, Bill Baker, big All-American.

1462
01:28:59,652 --> 01:29:01,119
Big All-American sucker!

1463
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:03,916
- I don't understand.
- You wouldn't understand.

1464
01:29:04,123 --> 01:29:06,284
First I let his old man
buy me through college,

1465
01:29:06,392 --> 01:29:09,555
then I let my own girlfriend
talk me into playing second fiddle.

1466
01:29:09,662 --> 01:29:10,856
All for Junior.

1467
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:12,760
I thought we agreed it was for his ego.

1468
01:29:12,865 --> 01:29:16,164
And what about my ego?
Everything for Junior's ego.

1469
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:19,063
I'm getting tired of it,
and I've come up to tell you I'm tired.

1470
01:29:19,171 --> 01:29:21,002
- Someone will hear you.
- Don't shush me.

1471
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:23,041
I'm tired of playing games.

1472
01:29:23,709 --> 01:29:25,700
What's going on with you two?

1473
01:29:25,811 --> 01:29:28,006
I'm glad you asked
that question, madam.

1474
01:29:28,114 --> 01:29:30,344
It's what I come up to find out.

1475
01:29:39,191 --> 01:29:40,249
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1476
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:43,328
<i>this had been one of Ridgeville's</i>
<i>saddest homecoming games.</i>

1477
01:29:43,429 --> 01:29:45,693
<i>Without Bill Baker,</i>
<i>they've put up a good fight</i>

1478
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:47,925
<i>but Wilton is winning, seven to nothing.</i>

1479
01:29:48,034 --> 01:29:52,027
<i>With only five minutes left to play,</i>
<i>Ridgeville has called time out.</i>

1480
01:29:53,406 --> 01:29:56,466
Son, I never should have let you room
with a boy like that.

1481
01:29:56,575 --> 01:29:57,940
I'd rather not talk about him.

1482
01:29:58,044 --> 01:29:59,568
One chance in a million
for a championship,

1483
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,044
and that kid's got to get loaded.

1484
01:30:01,147 --> 01:30:03,945
Why did he do it?
Why did he pick last night?

1485
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,518
Coach, you gonna let Junior in?

1486
01:30:06,619 --> 01:30:08,109
- Please, Dad!
- Oh, yeah.

1487
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:11,986
Son, maybe some of living with Baker
rubbed off on you.

1488
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,823
Loosen up.

1489
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:23,695
Junior, I've got to talk to you about Bill.

1490
01:30:23,803 --> 01:30:25,828
Forget it, Terry.
I thought he was my friend.

1491
01:30:25,938 --> 01:30:28,133
He is your friend.
That's why he's in this trouble.

1492
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,299
He wanted to tell you long ago
about your father's money,

1493
01:30:30,409 --> 01:30:32,468
and that we loved each other,
but I wouldn't let him.

1494
01:30:32,578 --> 01:30:34,671
Because we were trying
to build up your ego.

1495
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:37,180
In building you up,
he thought I double-crossed him.

1496
01:30:37,283 --> 01:30:39,217
That's why he came to my room drunk
to tell me off

1497
01:30:39,318 --> 01:30:40,580
and got himself expelled.

1498
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:43,052
- And it's all your fault!
- Well, what can I do to make it up?

1499
01:30:43,155 --> 01:30:44,884
There's only one thing to do.

1500
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:47,584
Stop being self-centered
and dependent on other people.

1501
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:49,684
Get out there
and stand on your own two legs.

1502
01:30:49,795 --> 01:30:51,990
You have reason
to have confidence now.

1503
01:30:52,098 --> 01:30:55,261
Bill helped you.
Now get out there and help Bill.

1504
01:30:55,668 --> 01:30:57,499
Okay, Terry. I'll try.

1505
01:31:00,506 --> 01:31:02,064
All right, Jackson,
there's two minutes left.

1506
01:31:02,174 --> 01:31:05,302
- Get in there.
- Coach, I'd like to ask you something.

1507
01:31:05,411 --> 01:31:07,572
Did Bill keep me on the squad?

1508
01:31:08,447 --> 01:31:11,143
- I'd like to ask you a favor.
- What is it?

1509
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:13,309
Could I wear Bill's jersey?

1510
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:17,819
- Red, got 32's jersey?
- Yeah. Here it is.

1511
01:31:17,923 --> 01:31:19,390
Okay, hurry it up.

1512
01:31:20,626 --> 01:31:24,323
<i>Junior Jackson is wearing</i>
<i>Bill Baker's number 32.</i>

1513
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:27,888
<i>Junior Jackson is going</i>
<i>into the ballgame for Ridgeville.</i>

1514
01:31:34,373 --> 01:31:37,809
- K-24 on three.
- On three. Break.

1515
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,708
<i>Ridgeville's ball</i>
<i>on Wilton's 20-yard line.</i>

1516
01:31:41,113 --> 01:31:43,809
Set. One, two, three!

1517
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:46,407
<i>The ball is snapped.</i>
<i>He starts to circle his left end.</i>

1518
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:48,783
<i>No, wait a minute! He's running back</i>
<i>towards his own goal!</i>

1519
01:31:48,888 --> 01:31:51,015
<i>Junior is running the wrong way!</i>

1520
01:31:51,123 --> 01:31:54,115
<i>No, wait a minute!</i>
<i>He's reversing his field!</i>

1521
01:31:54,226 --> 01:31:57,525
<i>He picks up his blockers.</i>
<i>He's back to the 40, the 30,</i>

1522
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:01,291
<i>the 20, the 10, the five.</i>

1523
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,301
<i>Junior Jackson scores a touchdown</i>
<i>for Ridgeville!</i>

1524
01:32:04,403 --> 01:32:06,871
<i>What a beautiful tactical maneuver!</i>

1525
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:12,467
That's my boy! That's my Junior!

1526
01:32:13,712 --> 01:32:16,840
<i>The score is now seven to six,</i>
<i>with Wilton leading.</i>

1527
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:20,316
<i>Jackson covered almost 90 yards</i>
<i>on that touchdown run.</i>

1528
01:32:20,419 --> 01:32:24,788
<i>Now it'll be Ridgeville's turn</i>
<i>to try for this all-important extra point.</i>

1529
01:32:25,558 --> 01:32:28,959
<i>It'll be Ryan who will attempt</i>
<i>the extra point for Ridgeville.</i>

1530
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,487
But, Coach,
I could've made the extra point.

1531
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:34,395
Son, you've been seeing
too many college movies,

1532
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,968
where the hero goes in
at the last minute and wins the game.

1533
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:38,798
That touchdown you made
was a miracle.

1534
01:32:38,904 --> 01:32:40,531
Thanks. Sit down.

1535
01:32:42,842 --> 01:32:45,675
<i>There's a snap from center.</i>
<i>He puts the ball down. There's the kick!</i>

1536
01:32:45,778 --> 01:32:46,972
<i>It's no good. It's wide.</i>

1537
01:32:47,613 --> 01:32:50,673
<i>Wilton leads by a score of seven to six,</i>

1538
01:32:50,783 --> 01:32:52,910
<i>with but one minute left to play.</i>

1539
01:32:53,018 --> 01:32:55,680
<i>That missed kick</i>
<i>may have been the ballgame.</i>

1540
01:32:57,456 --> 01:32:59,583
<i>Ridgeville lining up for the kickoff now.</i>

1541
01:32:59,692 --> 01:33:01,819
<i>They'll kick off to Wilton.</i>
<i>There's the kick,</i>

1542
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:04,088
<i>a long end-over-end kick</i>
<i>coming down the field.</i>

1543
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:06,426
<i>Barton takes it in the end zone.</i>
<i>He's ready to run it out.</i>

1544
01:33:06,532 --> 01:33:09,399
<i>He's back to the five,</i>
<i>the 10, the 15, the 23.</i>

1545
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:12,231
<i>He's hit at the 23 and goes down,</i>
<i>and he fumbles!</i>

1546
01:33:12,705 --> 01:33:14,866
<i>And I believe Ridgeville recovers.</i>

1547
01:33:14,974 --> 01:33:18,705
<i>Yes, they did. It'll be first down</i>
<i>and 10 yards to go for Ridgeville.</i>

1548
01:33:18,811 --> 01:33:21,336
<i>Five seconds left to play</i>
<i>in the ballgame.</i>

1549
01:33:21,447 --> 01:33:25,645
<i>Now we'll see whether or not Ridgeville</i>
<i>can capitalize on this break.</i>

1550
01:33:27,953 --> 01:33:30,444
<i>Ridgeville has called for a time-out.</i>

1551
01:33:30,556 --> 01:33:33,753
Coach, I tell you, you gotta put Junior in.
He's a great kicker.

1552
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:35,793
I've been practicing with him
day after day.

1553
01:33:35,895 --> 01:33:38,693
He's a Jackson.
I tell you he'll come through.

1554
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:41,231
Junior, it's a tough spot.

1555
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:44,029
You'll be kicking from the 29-yard line.

1556
01:33:44,136 --> 01:33:48,698
- Stiff wind blowing. What do you say?
- I'll do the best I can, Coach.

1557
01:33:49,775 --> 01:33:53,643
Okay. It's crazy, but go in.
And good luck.

1558
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:56,078
<i>Coach Wheeler</i>
<i>is making a substitution.</i>

1559
01:33:56,181 --> 01:33:58,979
<i>He's taking Ryan out</i>
<i>and putting young Jackson in.</i>

1560
01:33:59,318 --> 01:34:03,687
<i>Ridgeville is going to try a field goal</i>
<i>from an almost impossible angle.</i>

1561
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,950
Break.

1562
01:34:14,633 --> 01:34:17,568
<i>I wonder what's going through</i>
<i>young Jackson's mind now.</i>

1563
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,637
<i>You can do it, Junior. You're big now.</i>
<i>Do it for Bill.</i>

1564
01:34:24,777 --> 01:34:28,873
<i>Remember all the hours we practiced?</i>
<i>Take your time. You can do it.</i>

1565
01:34:31,617 --> 01:34:36,179
<i>There's the kick. It's up, up, up,</i>
<i>and it's over for a field goal!</i>

1566
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,984
<i>The gun goes off, and Ridgeville wins</i>
<i>by a score of nine to seven!</i>

1567
01:34:39,091 --> 01:34:42,288
That's my boy! That's my Junior!

1568
01:34:42,394 --> 01:34:45,591
<i>What a hero Junior Jackson will be</i>
<i>in this town tonight.</i>

1569
01:34:45,698 --> 01:34:47,859
<i>Entire Ridgeville team</i>
<i>is swarming off the bench...</i>

1570
01:34:47,967 --> 01:34:49,127
Go, Junior!

1571
01:34:49,234 --> 01:34:52,601
<i>They've got Jackson on their shoulders</i>
<i>and are carrying him off the field.</i>

1572
01:34:52,705 --> 01:34:55,765
<i>Well, what a football game</i>
<i>that boy has played today.</i>

1573
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:15,621
Well, Terry,
all misunderstandings cleared away?

1574
01:35:15,728 --> 01:35:17,389
- You happy?
- Very happy.

1575
01:35:17,496 --> 01:35:20,056
- I am, too.
- Oh, there's Bill.

1576
01:35:20,165 --> 01:35:22,224
Let's go tell him the news.

1577
01:35:23,469 --> 01:35:26,267
Bill, we've got some news for you.

1578
01:35:26,372 --> 01:35:28,863
Congratulations,
but it's not news, anymore.

1579
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:31,374
Oh, you don't understand.
Will you dance with Terry?

1580
01:35:31,477 --> 01:35:32,637
She wants it that way.

1581
01:35:32,745 --> 01:35:34,804
- Right, Terry?
- Well, I don't...

1582
01:35:34,913 --> 01:35:37,245
- Please, Bill.
- And I want it that way.

1583
01:35:37,349 --> 01:35:39,749
She's for you. Okay, pal?

1584
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:41,783
Okay, pal.

1585
01:35:45,024 --> 01:35:47,151
- Junior.
- Hiya, Babs.

1586
01:35:47,259 --> 01:35:48,920
I've been looking all over for you.

1587
01:35:49,028 --> 01:35:52,054
You know, I can't tell you
how thrilled I was this afternoon.

1588
01:35:52,164 --> 01:35:56,123
Why, you're just the best football player
there ever was in the whole wide world.

1589
01:35:56,235 --> 01:36:00,228
- No, I guess I was just lucky.
- Lucky? Why, you just thrilled me.

1590
01:36:00,506 --> 01:36:04,237
You know, I've always liked you
ever since high school.

1591
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:07,642
- Yeah? You did?
- Of course. Couldn't you tell?

1592
01:36:07,746 --> 01:36:09,008
Well, I...

1593
01:36:09,114 --> 01:36:11,844
Well, you'll be able to tell
from now on, sugar.

1594
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:14,612
What have you got for your little Babs?

1595
01:36:15,454 --> 01:36:16,716
Close your eyes.

1596
01:36:17,356 --> 01:36:18,687
Pucker up your lips.

1597
01:36:19,391 --> 01:36:20,653
Bye.

1598
01:36:33,472 --> 01:36:35,099
Dad. See? I won my letter.

1599
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:37,141
That's nice, Son,
but where are your glasses?

1600
01:36:37,242 --> 01:36:39,710
Oh, my glasses, well,
since I won the game this afternoon,

1601
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:41,871
and I'm a hero,
I don't need them anymore.

1602
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:44,710
Doc Hunter was right.
It was psychosomatic.

1603
01:36:44,817 --> 01:36:47,285
But, Dad,
aren't you pleased about the letter?

1604
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:48,546
Son, you've taught me

1605
01:36:48,654 --> 01:36:52,090
there are more important things in life
than football.

1606
01:36:52,558 --> 01:36:54,355
Will you please autograph my program?

1607
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:56,758
- Mine, too!
- Certainly, youngsters. Happy to do it.

1608
01:36:56,862 --> 01:36:58,830
Who's talking to you? We mean him.

1609
01:36:58,931 --> 01:37:00,796
Yeah, who does that old geezer
think he is?

1610
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:04,391
That old geezer is my dad,
"Jarring" Jack Jackson,

1611
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:07,103
the greatest football player
ever turned out at Ridgeville.

1612
01:37:07,206 --> 01:37:10,698
So what? We saw you this afternoon,
and for our money, you're the greatest.

1613
01:37:10,809 --> 01:37:12,640
I'm going out for football
next season, Junior.

1614
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,939
Could you give me some advice?

1615
01:37:15,647 --> 01:37:18,673
Well, there were three things
when I played football.

1616
01:37:18,951 --> 01:37:23,320
You hit them low, you hit them fast,
you hit them hard.

1617
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:26,118
And if they get up, you hit them again.

1618
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:29,256
Yes, sir, you got to play "guts" football.

1619
01:37:29,461 --> 01:37:32,294
- Thanks, Junior.
- Yeah, thanks a lot, Junior.

1620
01:37:32,397 --> 01:37:33,455
Okay.

1621
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:40,197
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- That's all right, Son.

1622
01:37:40,305 --> 01:37:41,772
That's my boy.
