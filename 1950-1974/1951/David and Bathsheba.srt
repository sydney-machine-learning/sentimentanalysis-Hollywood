1
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,826
Wait here.

2
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,296
Lord Commander.

3
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,622
- Well?
- The king is not in his tent.

4
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:13,415
- Not in his tent?
- No, sir.

5
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:16,506
Well, he must be somewhere.
Have you searched the camp?

6
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:19,259
Yes, sir. I have brought the aide
you assigned to him.

7
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,721
I think the man knows something.

8
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,348
That is the man, sir.

9
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,068
You were assigned to attend the king?

10
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:34,479
- Yes, sir.
- Where did he go?

11
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,821
Sir, I...
I cannot tell you.

12
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,441
As your commander
I order you to tell me.

13
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:41,784
The king pledged me to silence.

14
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:43,455
Where is he?

15
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,954
He went with the scouting party.

16
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:48,326
Scouting party?

17
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,120
What scouting party?

18
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,998
Every night, sir, we send out small
patrols to test the walls of the city.

19
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,250
And tonight?

20
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,462
Tonight, the waterway
under the north wall.

21
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,723
A patrol of 20 men
under Captain Uriah.

22
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,722
- You let him go?
- I could not stop him, sir.

23
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,812
We had finished the dispatches.

24
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:12,143
The king stood in the mouth
of the tent as the patrol went by.

25
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:13,605
He looked after them...

26
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:16,572
...and suddenly he took up
a sword and followed them.

27
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,858
Take 100 of your best men
and go after them.

28
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,362
Sir.

29
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:22,995
- To arms, men.
- King.

30
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,822
Ira's hundred. To arms.

31
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,204
King of all Israel out there
in the darkness...

32
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:29,783
...exposing himself to the enemy...

33
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,834
...crawling on his belly
like a common soldier.

34
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,968
Attack.

35
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,918
Sire, I am the commander of the army.

36
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,956
- My orders...
- Yes, I know.

37
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,085
We'll speak of it later.
Come in, Uriah.

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,426
I apologize for delaying your supper.

39
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:12,265
Sit down, Uriah.

40
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,645
Pour us some wine.

41
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,351
Sit down.

42
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,647
Sire.

43
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,489
- Hmm?
- You are wounded.

44
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,736
- Let me call the physician.
- No, no, let it alone.

45
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,029
It's a long time
since I've shed any blood.

46
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,998
It's good to have proof
that it still runs in my veins.

47
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,410
Sit down, Joab.

48
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,753
We must decide on our strategy,
for Rabbah is well defended.

49
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,258
Unfortunately, there are no Joshuas
among usâ€¦

50
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,100
...to command the walls to fall down.

51
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,437
What would you do, Uriah?

52
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,933
I can speak for them, sire.

53
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,312
Every man in the army
would be glad to die for David.

54
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,891
A thousand dead, perhaps two.

55
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,566
A thousand vineyards
and flocks left untended.

56
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,195
A thousand women
wailing on my doorstep.

57
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,529
You have a wife, Uriah?

58
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,449
- Yes, sire.
- She will come to my door in tears.

59
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,785
If I am unlucky.

60
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,285
No, it is a certainty.

61
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,874
In wartime, the best are always
the first to die.

62
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,244
Then her tears will be tears of pride.

63
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,166
You are young to know much of women
and too brave, whereas I'm a coward.

64
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,417
A coward, sire?

65
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,474
My men go into battle
singing an old song.

66
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,134
"Saul has slain his thousands
and David his ten thousands."

67
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,930
That was years ago.

68
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,602
When I was captain of a hundred,
like yourself.

69
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,855
I was not the king.

70
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,069
You will serve me better
if you live, Uriah.

71
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,151
Come, Joab.

72
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,284
Remain seated.
Continue with your meal.

73
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,579
I will return to Jerusalem in the morning.

74
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:15,927
Oh, King of Judah and Israel, live forever.

75
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:21,846
The pharaoh of Egypt sends greetings
to his beloved cousin.

76
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,643
The pharaoh bids me...

77
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,525
...prostrate myself
before the great king...

78
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,486
...and to present this humble token
of Egypt's regard.

79
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,575
The king of Israel warms himself
in the sun of the pharaoh's regard.

80
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,593
My beloved cousin,
the pharaoh probably hopes...

81
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,556
...that I'll cut my throat with this.

82
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,854
Nathan, the prophet of God.

83
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,692
May God walk with David.

84
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,064
It is his custom to walk with Nathan.

85
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:17,447
God looks with favor on you to bring
the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem.

86
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:18,652
Excellent.

87
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,867
But as to your intention of building
a temple to receive the Ark...

88
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,749
...he has commanded me
to say this to you.

89
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,254
Thus speaks the Lord:

90
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,625
"Should my servant David
build me a house to dwell in.

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,299
For I have not dwelt in a house since
the day I brought the Israelites...

92
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,052
...up out of Egypt, even to this day,
but I have lived in a tent.

93
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,342
Have I ever, in all these years...

94
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,388
...demanded that a temple
be built for me?

95
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:44,762
Now therefore I say to

96
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,350
'I took you from the pasture
from guarding your sheep...

97
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,688
...to make you shepherd over my people,
even over all Israel.'"

98
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:52,984
Yes, yes. I understand.

99
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,192
God sees no need of a temple,
is that it?

100
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,489
That is his word.

101
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,194
Very well.
I leave such decisions to you.

102
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,240
To God, sire.

103
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:05,126
Whatever you like.
You may take full charge...

104
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:09,166
...of the arrangements to bring
the Ark here from Baal, Judah.

105
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,503
My father...

106
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,502
...will you hear my petition?

107
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:17,585
Amnon, my son,
you need not beg for an audience.

108
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,928
You promised me, as the heir to Israel...

109
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,228
...all the vineyards north of the Mount of
Olives as far as the borders of Ephraim...

110
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,847
...yet you have given the large vineyard
on the Gibeon road to Absalom.

111
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,055
Did I?

112
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,437
Only last month you said it was mine,
yet Amnon claims it.

113
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:35,185
I demand only justice.

114
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,192
And what does Absalom demand?

115
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,654
Justice too.

116
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:43,991
Then, no matter how I decide,
I am unjust.

117
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,540
The vineyard belongs to Amnon.

118
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,076
Thank you, my father.

119
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,585
Come with me.

120
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,676
You must try to understand my problem.
Amnon is the heir. He's been anointed.

121
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,930
If it became known
that I favored you...

122
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:11,432
...it would weaken him
in the eyes of the people.

123
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,230
We both know he needs all
the strength we can give him.

124
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,443
We both know he is not fit to be heir.

125
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,238
That I cannot help.

126
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,899
You could anoint me in his place.

127
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:24,077
Even if I wanted to,
I am bound by the law.

128
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:28,244
With our people, the law is everything.
It is in their bones.

129
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,585
It's only one vineyard, Absalom.

130
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,918
I'll give you your choice
of my own holdings.

131
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,627
I want only what is mine.

132
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,588
Here. Take this.

133
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:46,553
It is worth 20 vineyards.

134
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:03,694
Michal.

135
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:07,283
I did not expect to see you here.

136
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,989
Does my presence displease the king?

137
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,744
Of course not.

138
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,329
You are always welcome.

139
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,211
If the sight of me is so welcome...

140
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,050
...why haven't you come
to my chamber since your return?

141
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,296
I have much on my mind.

142
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:21,959
Yet you found time
to greet your other wives.

143
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:26,466
I was the first and now I am the last.

144
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:29,559
If you had been with the others
I would have greeted you too.

145
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,850
You remain aloof by your own choice.

146
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:35,188
There was a time when you
thought well of my aloofness.

147
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:40,023
I make no objection to it now.

148
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,940
Do as you please.

149
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:45,364
How graciously...

150
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,444
...you give your royal approval.

151
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:52,287
And your sarcasm is wasted.
We both know that royalty is a fraud.

152
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,659
It was no fraud
when my father was king.

153
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:58,293
I have never denied that
Saul was every inch a king.

154
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:01,875
And his successor every inch a fraud.

155
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:06,633
I will not argue with that either.

156
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:14,771
Do you think that hanging his spear
on your wall...

157
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:19,225
...will make you royal?
- Michal, please.

158
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,769
I have messages to read.

159
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:24,483
Oh.

160
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:26,566
I understand.

161
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,695
I am dismissed.

162
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:33,661
The shepherd's son is dismissing
the daughter of Saul.

163
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:37,586
I am to go
and sit with the concubines.

164
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,458
They are my wives...

165
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,708
...and you are my wife.

166
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,216
Is that not enough?

167
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:53,556
Why did you marry me, David?

168
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,020
Why?

169
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,105
Because I loved you.

170
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,734
You lie.

171
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:07,030
You have never loved anyone
but yourself.

172
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:10,740
"David," meaning "beloved."

173
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:13,278
- David, the beloved-of-David.
- Whatever you say...

174
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:16,741
My love was wasted.
You had no need of it.

175
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,416
Is your memory so short?

176
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:26,045
I had great need of it once.

177
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,174
I begged you on my knees,
but you deserted me.

178
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,093
You refused to follow me into exile.

179
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,891
You even dishonored your vows
and let your father marry you to another.

180
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,055
- Against my will.
- You can say so.

181
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:45,526
But I cannot help thinking that real
love would have fathered a stronger will.

182
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:47,814
Then why did you take me back?

183
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,195
You might have guessed.

184
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,664
Without Saul's daughter at my side...

185
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:03,085
...the northern tribes would not have
acknowledged me as king.

186
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,298
By taking you back...

187
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:08,080
...I made Israel one.

188
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,847
Michal...

189
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,514
...we're past the days of our passion...

190
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,142
...Iove or hatred or anguish,
even cruelty.

191
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:24,060
Why should we torture ourselves?

192
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:29,774
We have to go on living, Michal.

193
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,315
Abishai.

194
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:41,367
There is a house over there...

195
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:44,069
...under that big terebinth tree.

196
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,996
- You know it?
- Yes, sire.

197
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,125
- The house of Uriah the Hittite.
- Uriah the Hittite.

198
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:52,253
- He's a captain with the army.
- Yes, I know him.

199
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:54,914
Does he, by any chance,
have a sister?

200
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,340
No, sire. He has a wife.

201
00:16:57,553 --> 00:17:01,171
A Hebrew woman of Benjamin
called Bathsheba.

202
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,389
Bathsheba.

203
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,054
During my visit to the army...

204
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:10,728
...this Uriah's gallantry was called
to my attention.

205
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:14,274
It's been in my mind to reward him.

206
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:19,942
Perhaps, in his absence,
his wife could accept the reward.

207
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:23,776
- I'll send for the woman in the morning.
- No. Send for her now.

208
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,527
She shall dine with me tonight.

209
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,538
Yes, sire.

210
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,877
You're not eating.

211
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:37,707
I dined earlier, sire.

212
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:40,256
It is my custom when I am alone.

213
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:45,760
As a soldier's wife,
you have good reason...

214
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:49,137
...to hate the king who keeps
your husband from your side.

215
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:50,936
The king does what he must.

216
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,513
His needs are the kingdom's.

217
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,601
Not all of them.

218
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,732
This wine is Phoenician.

219
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,446
I find it mellower than ours.
It has the blandness of the sea air.

220
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,412
Have you ever visited the coast?

221
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,656
No, sire.

222
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,164
I lived for several years
among the Philistines.

223
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,952
A cold people like their sea.

224
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,132
We Hebrews are of the desert.

225
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,135
We breathe its wind
and our blood runs hot with it.

226
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:24,461
Our emotions are fierce,
like the desert wind.

227
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,097
We worship our God fiercely...

228
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:28,672
...we love fiercely,
we feel sorrow fiercely...

229
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:32,845
...even the lesser sorrows,
like the absence of a loved one.

230
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,147
Has Uriah been away for long?

231
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:39,183
We have been married seven months.

232
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:42,024
Of this time,
we have been together six days.

233
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,862
A poor return on the hopes
your betrothal.

234
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:48,284
You are generous indeed not to hate me.

235
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,702
I had no hopes, sire.

236
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,872
I first saw Uriah on our wedding day...

237
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,912
...when my father brought me
to his house.

238
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:59,379
Then six days is the sum
total of your love?

239
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:03,755
Of our marriage, yes, sire.

240
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,235
One of the vanities of kings
is that they think virtue...

241
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,401
...can be rewarded with a bauble.

242
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,202
How God must laugh
at the spectacle of unvirtuous kings...

243
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:37,667
...hanging bits of rock
and metal on virtuous men.

244
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,012
That is for virtue.

245
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:18,457
Now you understand
why I sent for you.

246
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:24,500
My understanding is not necessary,
sire.

247
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,712
Why not?

248
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,842
You are the king.

249
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,135
Is that all?

250
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,596
Well, leave the king out of it.

251
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,304
Think if any man would be content
with such an answer.

252
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,636
What other answer can I give, sire?

253
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:42,804
You have sent for me
and made known to me your will.

254
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:45,563
What else is there for me to say?

255
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:51,029
In Egypt that would be enough.

256
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:59,034
There, the pharaoh has certain rights
he can command but I...

257
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:04,166
Even if I had the right I've never used
my power to take anything by force.

258
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:09,088
All that I have ever had
has been given to me.

259
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:13,049
Freely, without restraint.

260
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:17,053
Even Israel. I refused the throne
until every elder of every tribe...

261
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:20,262
...would come to me
and beg me to take it.

262
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:24,186
It's been a kind of pride.

263
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,646
My pride.

264
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,819
Never to force myself on anyone.

265
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,859
So I said nothing to you.

266
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:37,653
Until you told me
that there is no love in your marriage.

267
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,449
Yes, you told me that.

268
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:44,285
And so did Uriah.

269
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:49,043
His dream of glory is his wife in tears.

270
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:53,378
You better go.

271
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,141
Oh, no, keep that.

272
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,429
It's only a stone
but you lend it beauty.

273
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,348
Uriah's a fool.

274
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,985
When I looked on you
from my terrace tonight...

275
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,906
...I knew that every future moment
spent away from you...

276
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:16,315
...would be a moment lost.

277
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:21,071
Yet he's found only six days for you
in seven months.

278
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:24,165
The perfume of his beloved
is the stink of war.

279
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:27,085
Does he think a man was made
only for the agony of battle?

280
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:30,872
Does he call that manhood?
Has he no blood, no heart?

281
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,922
Now go.

282
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,680
And be thankful
that I am not the pharaoh.

283
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:50,352
At least I can console myself
with the thought that your modesty...

284
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:52,186
...matches your beauty.

285
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,531
Perhaps you would prefer
truth to modesty, sire.

286
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:01,989
Before you went away,
I used to watch you every evening...

287
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:04,203
...as you walked on your terrace...

288
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:08,323
...always at the same hour,
always alone.

289
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:11,207
- Today, I heard you had returned.
- Then you knew that I...

290
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:14,168
That you would be on your terrace tonight.

291
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:15,884
Yes.

292
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:21,843
I had heard that never had the king
found a woman to please him.

293
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:25,014
I dared to hope
that I might be that woman.

294
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,221
Why are you telling me this now?
Why not before?

295
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,308
Because first...

296
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:33,975
...I had to know
what was in your heart.

297
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,645
If the law of Moses is to be broken,
David...

298
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:41,152
...let us break it in full understanding
of what we want from each other.

299
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:49,413
No, please. I'm not finished.

300
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:54,920
There are women you could send for
and send away again.

301
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,339
I am not one of them.

302
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,587
What do you want?

303
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:02,969
To please you.

304
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:07,221
Have I not made it plain enough
that you please me?

305
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:10,729
I'll never send you away,
if that is what you want.

306
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:12,356
Never as long as I live.

307
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,691
No, David.
That is not all I want.

308
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:19,693
Think not of this one night...

309
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:23,110
...but of all the days
and all the nights to come.

310
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:25,822
Think if I can give you
what you need...

311
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,369
...for as long as you live...

312
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,783
...as your wife.

313
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,082
But you're not free.

314
00:24:42,388 --> 00:24:44,012
If I were free?

315
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:48,466
A king is not supposed
to need anything.

316
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:51,054
Only a fool would suppose that.

317
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:53,264
Well, then...

318
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,191
...friendship.

319
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,357
I had a friend once,
but I destroyed him.

320
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:04,065
The others,
who call themselves friends, I...

321
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:05,987
I never see their eyes...

322
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:09,612
...only the tops of their heads
as they bow to me.

323
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,115
Their hands are extended to me...

324
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:16,289
...but palms upwards, for favors.

325
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:19,292
Even my own sons.

326
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:23,423
Will I see your eyes, Bathsheba?

327
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:27,757
You will see them.

328
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:32,351
And my hand will be in yours.

329
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:35,886
That much is easy, David.

330
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:39,562
I am only a man, Bathsheba.

331
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:42,143
I need someone to understand that.

332
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:44,819
I need the kind of understanding...

333
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,406
...that only one human being
can give to another.

334
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:52,995
I need someone to share my heart.

335
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:58,333
The man I watched from my window
is not the king...

336
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:03,961
...but a man whose heart
is well worth the sharing.

337
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:44,589
Oh, David.

338
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,434
No, David. The boy, he'll see us.

339
00:26:59,273 --> 00:27:00,553
No matter.

340
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,899
Shepherd boys learn early about life.

341
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,454
Did you, David?

342
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:25,464
Did I what?

343
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:28,206
Learn about life early.

344
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:31,627
Before I was 12...

345
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:34,971
...I knew almost everything
there was to know about life...

346
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,094
...and death.

347
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,391
At 12, I had killed wolves.

348
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:41,306
At 13, a man.

349
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:45,230
Tell me. Not about the killing.

350
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:48,153
Tell me about the boy you were.

351
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:57,366
It couldn't be of any interest to you.

352
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,950
A woman is interested in everything
about her man.

353
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:07,665
Particularly in what he was
before she knew him.

354
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:10,248
Well, there's not much to tell.

355
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:14,929
I was a shepherd like thousands
of others in Judah.

356
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:23,771
You slept out under the stars.

357
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:25,476
Mmm.

358
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,685
Did you dream, David?

359
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,770
What did you dream about?

360
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:38,155
Surely a man is entitled to the privacy
of his dreams.

361
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,330
- Then they were of women.
- Naturally.

362
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:44,072
A whole procession of them.

363
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:47,455
And every one of them
ravishingly beautiful.

364
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,584
I'm jealous of every one of them.

365
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:05,844
Ah...

366
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,561
Uh, it's been a dry year.

367
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:17,782
The shepherds are driven early
to the wells.

368
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:23,330
Once, when I was a boy, we had a year
when even the wells went dry.

369
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:28,120
By midsummer we were slaughtering
sheep, saving only the ewe lambs.

370
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:30,787
That was the year
that I fought the wolves.

371
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,044
Tell me.

372
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:34,623
Well, they'd been made
desperate by hunger.

373
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:37,921
I fought them for eight hours
with my slingshot.

374
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:40,469
In the morning, six of them lay dead.

375
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:42,467
And you were only a boy.

376
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:45,430
Well, I was quite a hand
with the sling.

377
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,816
Here I'll show you.

378
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:54,269
May I try your sling?

379
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:04,034
That tree. Watch.

380
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:23,137
Very well, if you think you can do better.

381
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,572
Yes.

382
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,038
Well, I, uh... I lack practice.

383
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:07,467
David, did you really kill Goliath?

384
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:12,059
After seeing me with that sling,
how could you doubt me?

385
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,563
Was he truly as big as they say?

386
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:22,071
Well, I will admit that he grows
a little bit bigger every year.

387
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:40,838
A new life.

388
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:47,008
Oh, that's his mother.

389
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:49,508
She's caught in the brambles.

390
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,856
- I'll give you some help.
- Thank you, sir.

391
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,945
Let's clear those hind feet.

392
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,616
No, use both hands.

393
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:15,286
Oh.

394
00:32:43,406 --> 00:32:46,075
I'm an old soldier, sir.

395
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:50,695
Fought for the king.

396
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:54,121
- David?
- Not him.

397
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,950
But the king.

398
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:57,501
King Saul.

399
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:00,455
It was in his last battle.

400
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,002
There.

401
00:33:03,175 --> 00:33:04,717
At the Mount of Gilboa.

402
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:06,842
It's peaceful now.

403
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:11,009
Good grazing for the flocks,
though we lack rain this year.

404
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:14,470
But that day it rained blood.

405
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:17,135
- Yes.
- I saw the king die.

406
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:21,726
Saw him fall on his sword
when he knew the battle was lost.

407
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,270
Tell me, did you...

408
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,937
...also see the king's son die?

409
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:30,483
- Jonathan.
- Yes, sir. I did.

410
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:35,070
You see that rock that juts out
from the face of the mountain?

411
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,621
The big one, with the sun on it.

412
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,200
Prince Jonathan stood there...

413
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:43,629
...with a loyal friend
on each side of him.

414
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,957
He fought there the livelong day.

415
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:51,210
His friends went down
but still he fought against tens...

416
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:55,635
...then against hundreds
until they overwhelmed him.

417
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:57,933
Those Philistines...

418
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:01,354
...and their brass
and heathenish helmets.

419
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:04,852
Ah, it was a black day for Israel.

420
00:34:05,028 --> 00:34:07,863
The king gone, Jonathan gone...

421
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:11,115
...none worthy to take their place.

422
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:14,783
Yet Israel found a king in David.

423
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:16,911
Saul was king.

424
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:19,288
Jonathan should be king today.

425
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:27,424
Here.

426
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:36,849
Thank you, sir.

427
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:40,306
Thank you kindly.

428
00:34:56,913 --> 00:34:58,490
David.

429
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,281
Come.

430
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:05,120
It's getting late.

431
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,032
Jonathan.

432
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:10,193
Jonathan!

433
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:55,785
Oh, how the mighty have fallen...

434
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:01,086
...in the midst of the battle.

435
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:14,593
Oh, Jonathan.

436
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:19,012
Thou was slain...

437
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:21,853
...in thine high places.

438
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:30,240
I am distressed for thee,
my brother Jonathan.

439
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:37,741
Very pleasant has thou been unto me.

440
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:41,663
Thy love to me was wonderful.

441
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:46,668
Passing the love of women.

442
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,258
How have the mighty fallen.

443
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:57,179
And the weapons of war...

444
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,803
...perished.

445
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,526
Hyah!

446
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:55,910
Hyah.

447
00:41:58,413 --> 00:41:59,955
Slow it up.

448
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:06,118
Greetings, Abishai.

449
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:11,090
I received your message.
Am I in time?

450
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:15,208
Yes, sire. Even now
the caravan approaches Jerusalem.

451
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:24,436
Look, Bathsheba.

452
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:26,557
The Ark of the Covenant.

453
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:31,026
A shrine that has traveled with our
people through all their wanderings.

454
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:34,280
I am bringing it here
to its proper home.

455
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,655
Get in, Abishai.
I'll go down to meet Nathan.

456
00:42:36,826 --> 00:42:38,485
You'll take Bathsheba to her house.

457
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:40,442
I beg you.

458
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:43,490
No.

459
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,075
No.

460
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:52,174
Mercy. I beg you. Mercy.

461
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:02,634
Mercy, I beg you.

462
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,265
It's for you to cast the first stone.

463
00:43:05,438 --> 00:43:07,975
Mercy!

464
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,689
Mercy.

465
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:22,409
An adulteress, sire. She betrayed
her husband in the arms of another.

466
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,071
Judged and condemned under the law.

467
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:29,587
Go. Take her home.

468
00:44:05,664 --> 00:44:07,989
- Sire.
- Nathan.

469
00:44:19,636 --> 00:44:23,135
God's design is a strange one, Nathan.

470
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:29,510
Consider how this box of wood
has outlived the flesh that made it...

471
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:32,225
...and preserved it and venerated it.

472
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:40,151
A pity that it is mute and blind
and cannot tell us of our ancient dead.

473
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:45,451
Of Moses on the mountain top.
Of Miriam and Aaron.

474
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:48,070
Of Joshua at the walls of Jericho.

475
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:50,121
No, sire!

476
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:54,491
Do not tempt the thunderbolts
of the Lord.

477
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:58,538
His dwelling is not to be profaned
by unconsecrated hands.

478
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:01,208
To touch it is to die.

479
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,591
As you say, Nathan.

480
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:27,577
The Ark!
The Ark of the Covenant has fallen!

481
00:45:57,567 --> 00:45:59,524
He is dead.

482
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:07,941
Let all take heed and bear witness
to what they have seen...

483
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,155
...that the people may know
the will of God.

484
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,117
The time is not right
for the entrance into the city.

485
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,083
Unhitch the oxen.

486
00:46:16,252 --> 00:46:18,956
Let a tabernacle be erected on this spot.

487
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:22,292
Let the Ark remain here
outside the walls...

488
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:25,751
...until God has signified
the appeasement of his wrath.

489
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:06,006
David.

490
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:09,969
Bathsheba.

491
00:47:11,848 --> 00:47:13,591
You shouldn't have come here.

492
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:15,309
I had no choice.

493
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:17,303
My news would not wait.

494
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:19,138
David...

495
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:21,482
...I bring you trouble.

496
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:25,188
Our secret is no longer a secret.

497
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:27,687
- Who has learned it?
- No one yet.

498
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:31,149
But soon all will know
who have eyes to see.

499
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:35,866
I'm sure now of what I have feared
this past week.

500
00:47:36,456 --> 00:47:38,781
I am with child.

501
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:41,452
Beloved.

502
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:49,672
No need for tears.

503
00:47:49,844 --> 00:47:52,216
You bring me only joy.

504
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:54,880
What man would not be happy
to learn that his wife...

505
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:56,931
...will give him a child?

506
00:47:58,478 --> 00:48:02,427
- I am not your wife.
- You are my only wife.

507
00:48:02,607 --> 00:48:07,268
Please, beloved, do not be afraid.

508
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:09,521
I am not afraid.

509
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,656
Soon enough we must all go down
to Sheol.

510
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:16,495
My tears are for our child
who will never see the light.

511
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:18,370
Bathsheba, listen to me.

512
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:20,033
You will not die.

513
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:23,790
- The law says that I must.
- They would not dare. I am the king.

514
00:48:23,962 --> 00:48:28,042
The Israelites have had kings
for less than 50 years.

515
00:48:29,217 --> 00:48:31,790
They have had the law of Moses for hundreds.

516
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:35,005
I will give them their kingdom.
You and I will flee into Egypt.

517
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:36,972
No, David.

518
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:42,100
Your life is marked out
on a certain course.

519
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:46,138
Even you cannot change it
if it's God's design.

520
00:48:58,245 --> 00:49:00,486
There is another answer.

521
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,825
Uriah.

522
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:06,826
Uriah is a soldier.

523
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:11,048
Soldiers die every day in battle
and not always by enemy hands.

524
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:13,008
No, David.

525
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:16,552
Even our love could not bear
the burden of such a crime.

526
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:21,178
The crime lies in the chance
that I was born a Hebrew.

527
00:49:21,352 --> 00:49:24,222
In any other nation on earth,
Uriah's life would be forfeit.

528
00:49:24,438 --> 00:49:26,395
It would be no less a crime.

529
00:49:31,779 --> 00:49:34,530
If I sent for him,
told him everything...

530
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:38,903
We both know what he would say.

531
00:49:40,496 --> 00:49:43,829
Yes. Honor is everything, charity nothing.

532
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,659
For the sake of honor,
blood must flow...

533
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:50,120
...lives must be ruined,
humanity denied.

534
00:49:50,672 --> 00:49:54,586
I can see Uriah now,
hurrying to the gate...

535
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,669
...eager to be
the first to cast a stone.

536
00:49:58,722 --> 00:50:00,132
Sire.

537
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,429
What is it, Abishai?

538
00:50:02,643 --> 00:50:04,968
The orders for Joab, sire.

539
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,356
Yes.

540
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:27,739
Do not send it now.

541
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:30,124
I may want to add to the message.

542
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:32,038
Yes, sire.

543
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:43,973
There is another way.

544
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:50,135
Perhaps it will solve nothing...

545
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:53,895
...but at least it will gain us time.

546
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:02,154
If Uriah can be made to believe
that the child is his.

547
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:05,078
But he has been away almost a year.

548
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:07,322
I will send for him...

549
00:51:07,874 --> 00:51:10,661
...to report on the campaign.

550
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:14,544
He will be here in Jerusalem
one night...

551
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:16,832
...perhaps two.

552
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:21,207
- You called me your wife.
- The law calls you his.

553
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:24,304
That is not worthy of you, David.

554
00:51:25,224 --> 00:51:28,474
It tears my heart
to suggest such a thing.

555
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:34,149
But it is your life, beloved.

556
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,933
Your life.

557
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,483
It is shameful what you ask.

558
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:43,443
There is no shame too great...

559
00:51:43,784 --> 00:51:47,651
...no act so vile
that I would not commit it...

560
00:51:48,456 --> 00:51:51,029
...if it would save my love.

561
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:21,520
It is late and our guest must be weary
from the road.

562
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:24,524
Come, Uriah.

563
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:28,194
Absalom, it is many days
since we have seen you at the palace.

564
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:31,815
I have been in Judah, sire,
tending to my vines.

565
00:54:32,034 --> 00:54:34,406
And do you expect a good yield
from your vines?

566
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,193
I have no reason
to be dissatisfied, sire.

567
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:39,740
In such a bad year.

568
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:42,117
You're to be congratulated.

569
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:49,801
- I should like a word with you in private.
- I am at my king's service.

570
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,753
I will not keep you long.

571
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:56,472
You must be eager to go home
to your wife.

572
00:54:57,935 --> 00:55:00,639
- You said the attack is planned.
- Yes, sire.

573
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:02,805
Joab's confident
it'll meet with success.

574
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:05,518
He promises you Rabbah
within a week, sire.

575
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:09,062
With your permission, I plan
to return to camp early tomorrow...

576
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:11,563
...so that I may lead
my hundred into the battle.

577
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,868
As you wish. Abishai will have
dispatches for you to carry.

578
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:18,996
But if you desire
to remain in Jerusalem longer...

579
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:22,117
My only desire is to serve my king.

580
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:26,587
Well, I might believe that,
but you have a wife.

581
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:29,881
My wife is nothing, sire,
beside my duty.

582
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,085
Sit down, Uriah.

583
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:37,923
They say she is very beautiful.

584
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,176
As women go.

585
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:55,781
A woman does not always share
her husband's devotion to duty.

586
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,485
Have you ever tried to think of things
from her point of view?

587
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:01,038
No, sire.

588
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:04,206
But supposing her wishes and yours
come into conflict?

589
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:07,127
A woman's wishes cannot conflict
with her husband's, sire.

590
00:56:07,295 --> 00:56:09,583
- That is the law.
- The law.

591
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:12,673
The law can only control
what we do...

592
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,294
...not what we think.

593
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,046
What does your wife think, Uriah?

594
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,173
I do not know, sire.

595
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:23,298
Is it possible that you believe
that she does not think or feel?

596
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:29,310
A woman is flesh and blood,
Uriah, like us.

597
00:56:29,692 --> 00:56:33,938
Perhaps more so because we give her so
little to think of but matters of the flesh.

598
00:56:34,113 --> 00:56:36,568
In all our history,
only a handful of women...

599
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:39,777
...have been permitted
to write their names beside the men.

600
00:56:39,994 --> 00:56:43,528
Miriam, Deborah, Jael,
perhaps one or two more.

601
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:47,622
A woman's occupation
is her husband...

602
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:50,789
...and her life is her love.

603
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,591
But if her husband rejects her love,
if he puts another love before it...

604
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,971
...if he denies her the only meaning
that her life can have...

605
00:57:00,973 --> 00:57:04,840
...is it not understandable
if she seeks a meaning for it elsewhere?

606
00:57:05,937 --> 00:57:07,016
With another man?

607
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:12,399
- Yes.
- Lf she does, she breaks the law.

608
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:16,773
But if her husband feels pity for her...

609
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:20,239
...under the law, he is the one
who must condemn her.

610
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:23,985
Then it is doubly his duty to be sure
that the law is obeyed.

611
00:57:36,342 --> 00:57:38,583
Would you condemn your own wife, Uriah?

612
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:40,082
Bathsheba?

613
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,299
That is not possible.

614
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:45,766
But if it were possible?

615
00:57:49,855 --> 00:57:52,061
I would not hesitate to do my duty,
sire.

616
00:57:54,443 --> 00:57:58,440
You would force her
to suffer the most horrible of deaths?

617
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:00,820
Let the mob drive her like a dog...

618
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:03,991
...through the streets
to the city gates?

619
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:08,491
Watch the cruel stones
strike her flesh, let...?

620
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:12,412
Yes, sire...

621
00:58:13,003 --> 00:58:14,710
...if she had broken the law.

622
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:23,378
I've kept you too long from your bed.
You may go.

623
00:58:26,308 --> 00:58:27,967
Sire...

624
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,224
...will you grant me a boon?

625
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:32,643
What is your wish?

626
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:41,570
When Abishai prepares
the dispatches...

627
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,361
...let him say this to Joab in your name:

628
00:58:44,576 --> 00:58:47,363
"Set Uriah in the forefront
of the hottest battle...

629
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:51,036
...that he may serve his king
to the utmost of his ability."

630
00:58:53,835 --> 00:58:56,752
I will consider it, Uriah.

631
00:58:56,963 --> 00:58:59,002
My thanks, sire.

632
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:45,940
You are up late, David.

633
01:00:47,865 --> 01:00:48,979
So are you.

634
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:51,992
I thought I might be of comfort
to my husband.

635
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:57,911
It's a terrible thing
to know that your beloved...

636
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,408
...is in the arms of another.

637
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:02,458
Do not trouble to lie.

638
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:04,835
You see, I know your secret.

639
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:07,711
Yours and the lady Bathsheba's.

640
01:01:07,884 --> 01:01:10,920
- You know nothing.
- The lady has servants.

641
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:15,639
Servants tell things to other servants
and they tell them to their mistresses.

642
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,474
So the daughter of Saul concocts
a fantasy from servants' gossip.

643
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:23,647
Bathsheba's condition is no fantasy.

644
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:26,652
And the child she carries is yours.

645
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:31,197
Oh, my husband, I guessed at once
why you had sent for Uriah.

646
01:01:31,366 --> 01:01:34,865
Only David would have thought of it.
A clever trick.

647
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:38,451
- Worthy of the son of goatherds.
- Get out.

648
01:01:41,334 --> 01:01:44,251
You cannot save Bathsheba now.

649
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:46,793
Your scheme has failed.

650
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,874
Uriah has not been to his house
all night.

651
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:58,762
Even now, he sleeps here in the palace
with the officers of your guard.

652
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:57,031
Sire, forgive me.

653
01:02:57,618 --> 01:03:01,366
- I have slept late.
- I told you to go home.

654
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:04,076
I ask your pardon, sire.

655
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,744
I could not go to my wife.

656
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:07,577
Why not?

657
01:03:07,753 --> 01:03:10,540
It's a matter of my own worthiness.

658
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,624
Perhaps you will
consider this foolish...

659
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:18,301
...but when Joab told me
I was to come to Jerusalem...

660
01:03:18,472 --> 01:03:21,307
...I swore an oath on my sword.

661
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:24,470
I swore that while the army still slept in tents...

662
01:03:24,645 --> 01:03:27,681
...while Rabbah still stood in defiance
of God's will...

663
01:03:28,315 --> 01:03:32,644
...I would deny myself the comforts
and the pleasures of my own house.

664
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:35,104
I would keep myself clean for battle...

665
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,402
...as if for entering the tabernacle
of the Ark.

666
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:44,446
I am sorry if I have offended my king.

667
01:03:49,002 --> 01:03:51,753
If the dispatches are ready, I will go.

668
01:03:53,006 --> 01:03:54,832
You fool.

669
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:58,917
You stupid, blind fool.

670
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:10,053
Sire.

671
01:04:12,692 --> 01:04:14,269
Dispatches for Joab, sire.

672
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:18,732
Dispatches.
Shall I give them to Uriah?

673
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:22,659
No.

674
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:26,328
No.

675
01:04:35,715 --> 01:04:38,206
There is an additional order.

676
01:04:39,385 --> 01:04:43,678
Set Uriah in the forefront
of the hottest battle.

677
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,764
It is his own wish, Abishai.

678
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:52,476
Even his own words.

679
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:00,897
Is that all?

680
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,864
No.

681
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:07,366
I will not add hypocrisy
to my other sins.

682
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:09,744
Even if Joab should understand
what I intend...

683
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:13,367
...I cannot ask him to share
the burden of my guilt.

684
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:17,038
Here is the order:

685
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:20,419
Set Uriah in the forefront
of the hottest battle...

686
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:23,677
...and retire from him
that he may be smitten and die.

687
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:25,470
- Yes.
- When it is finished...

688
01:05:25,681 --> 01:05:28,350
...seal it and give it to Uriah.

689
01:05:31,187 --> 01:05:32,894
Yes, sire.

690
01:06:43,341 --> 01:06:46,258
Sire, we bring great news.

691
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:48,753
The walls of Rabbah
have been breached.

692
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:51,847
When we left, there was fighting
in the streets of the city.

693
01:06:52,017 --> 01:06:54,721
Joab bids me urge you
to come to Rabbah with all speed...

694
01:06:54,895 --> 01:06:57,516
...to receive the surrender
of your enemies.

695
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,230
And our dead?

696
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:08,156
Our losses have been heavy, sire.

697
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,115
Of the captains of a thousand:

698
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:14,614
Abimelech the son of Jurabiel,
and Heled the son of lkkesh.

699
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:18,407
Of the captains of a hundred:
Hezro the Carmelite...

700
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:20,992
...Igal the son of Zelek...

701
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:23,459
...Ittai the son of Ribai...

702
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:25,588
...Abiel the Arbathite...

703
01:07:25,758 --> 01:07:27,750
...Eliam the son of Reuben...

704
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:29,966
...Shammah the Harodite...

705
01:07:30,138 --> 01:07:32,047
...Uriah the Hittite...

706
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,014
...Bani the Gadite...

707
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,471
...Azmaveth the son of Eli...

708
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:39,395
...and many more are wounded.

709
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:46,187
How did Uriah the Hittite die?

710
01:07:46,404 --> 01:07:48,526
There was a mistake in the orders, sire.

711
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:53,531
Uriah advanced too far into the breach
and was cut off from his command.

712
01:07:56,497 --> 01:08:00,245
When you've eaten and rested, prepare
to return to Rabbah, I'll ride with you.

713
01:08:00,418 --> 01:08:01,828
Sire.

714
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:16,799
Sire, the lady Bathsheba's servant
is waiting for your answer.

715
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,553
Go to Bathsheba.

716
01:08:21,939 --> 01:08:24,690
Tell her that Uriah is dead.

717
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,817
Tell her to prepare for our marriage...

718
01:08:28,028 --> 01:08:30,067
...at the end of her month
of mourning.

719
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:32,569
Will you not go to her yourself?

720
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,486
No.

721
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:29,290
The hand of God
is heavy on his people.

722
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:31,207
Thus speaks the Lord:

723
01:09:31,424 --> 01:09:33,001
"I will withhold the rains...

724
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:36,260
...and cause the fields
and vineyards to dry up...

725
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:38,255
...the flocks to grow thin.

726
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,927
I will waste the land with drought,
the people with famine.

727
01:09:43,103 --> 01:09:46,685
Yea, I will smite Israel
for its sin against me.

728
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:51,482
Woe unto Israel.
Woe unto my people who have sinned."

729
01:09:53,696 --> 01:09:55,071
What sin, Nathan?

730
01:09:56,116 --> 01:10:00,030
The Lord has not vouchsafed to me
its nature...

731
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,658
...but evidently the sin is great...

732
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:06,289
...thus to incur his wrath.

733
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:09,456
Does it take so much
to make him angry?

734
01:10:09,629 --> 01:10:13,543
That soldier who laid hands on the Ark,
he was only trying to be helpful.

735
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:16,088
It is not for us to question
the ways of the Lord.

736
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,299
I question nothing.

737
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:22,338
Yet the sun was hot that day.
The man had been drinking wine.

738
01:10:22,517 --> 01:10:25,850
All were excited
when the Ark began to fall.

739
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,313
Is it not possible that the man might
have died naturally from other causes?

740
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:33,353
All causes are of God.

741
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:36,110
We've had droughts before, Nathan.

742
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,853
I am buying grain
in Egypt and Philistia.

743
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:42,698
There will be enough until the rains
come, if I have to empty my treasuries.

744
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,280
Now, what more can I do?

745
01:10:45,998 --> 01:10:48,749
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, sire.

746
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,210
I have sat in the gate and listened
to the people talk of the king.

747
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,542
What do they say?

748
01:10:53,756 --> 01:10:55,997
They say that David
is no longer David.

749
01:10:56,175 --> 01:10:59,958
They say that he neglects his duty,
that he is often away from the city.

750
01:11:00,137 --> 01:11:03,552
When he is here,
he has turned his face from his people.

751
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:07,673
Petitioners are sent away
from his door without a hearing.

752
01:11:07,853 --> 01:11:10,770
In hard times,
it's natural that some will complain.

753
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,691
Complain, yes, sire.

754
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,025
But not talk openly
of overthrowing the king.

755
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:22,150
Explain yourself.

756
01:11:22,326 --> 01:11:26,786
The hearts of the Israelites
are turning after your son.

757
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:30,993
Well, it's difficult to imagine
poor Amnon winning anyone's heart.

758
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:34,252
Not Amnon.
Your second son, Absalom.

759
01:11:34,421 --> 01:11:36,876
- The boy?
- Every day, he is at the gate...

760
01:11:37,049 --> 01:11:38,922
...seeking those you have turned away.

761
01:11:39,092 --> 01:11:41,001
To these he says:

762
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,627
"Oh, that I were made
a judge in the land...

763
01:11:43,805 --> 01:11:47,754
...that all may come to me
and receive justice."

764
01:11:48,727 --> 01:11:51,218
Confine yourself to the affairs of God.

765
01:11:51,396 --> 01:11:54,681
- Leave the affairs of the kingdom to me.
- Sire.

766
01:11:54,858 --> 01:11:57,942
Oh, Abishai. I have orders for Joab.

767
01:12:00,322 --> 01:12:04,366
The king forgets that he, too,
is a servant of the Lord.

768
01:13:08,473 --> 01:13:10,430
The priests are waiting.

769
01:13:12,185 --> 01:13:16,562
I have been waiting
these days and weeks.

770
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:20,431
Waiting for a word from the one
who called himself my lover.

771
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,982
For a sign that all of his promises
were not lies.

772
01:13:23,154 --> 01:13:26,487
- Beloved, I...
- Do not call me that, the word is a lie.

773
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:30,656
If you still loved me,
you would not have avoided me.

774
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:35,157
You would not have left me in darkness,
alone with my fears.

775
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:39,626
- You know that I was called to Rabbah...
- It is a week since your return.

776
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,416
They are waiting.

777
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:46,793
Let them wait.

778
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:49,336
There will be no wedding.

779
01:13:51,015 --> 01:13:54,181
I will not try to justify my behavior.

780
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:57,104
But even if I have earned
your hatred...

781
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:01,563
...you know why
the wedding must take place.

782
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:08,107
I could more easily find courage
to face the stones of the mob.

783
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:13,075
If our marriage is no more than an act
of charity on your part, then say so.

784
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:18,405
If I have lost your love, tell me,
and I will trouble you no longer.

785
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:21,205
I am not a beggar, David.

786
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:23,287
Beloved...

787
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:26,793
...it is I who am the beggar.

788
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:29,756
I beg your patience.

789
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:33,294
If you love me, say no more.

790
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:36,215
Take my love on faith.

791
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:42,102
It is yours and will always be yours.

792
01:14:58,206 --> 01:15:00,282
Come, my wife.

793
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:51,990
My lady.

794
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:55,752
The king should be called
if he would again see his son alive.

795
01:17:58,927 --> 01:18:00,551
Call him.

796
01:18:24,244 --> 01:18:25,903
Sire.

797
01:18:34,212 --> 01:18:37,047
The lady Bathsheba asks your presence.

798
01:18:39,175 --> 01:18:41,463
The child is better?

799
01:18:41,636 --> 01:18:43,545
No, sire.

800
01:19:15,586 --> 01:19:18,159
The physicians can do no more.

801
01:19:18,756 --> 01:19:20,878
They say he will die.

802
01:19:21,091 --> 01:19:22,917
I know.

803
01:19:23,636 --> 01:19:26,506
I have known it these seven days.

804
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:30,389
I have lain in sackcloth on the earth.

805
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:34,350
I have fasted. I have tried to pray.

806
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:38,399
My prayers were only words...

807
01:19:38,734 --> 01:19:41,355
...going out into emptiness.

808
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:45,821
They fell on no ears but my own.

809
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:17,020
Sire.

810
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:22,517
You told me to inform you,
the ambassador from Egypt has arrived.

811
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:24,770
Shall I send him away?

812
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:31,776
No, I will go down.

813
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:40,626
The time for grieving has past.

814
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,414
Will it bring my son back
if I mourn for him?

815
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,502
No, I shall go to him.

816
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:54,931
But he will not return to me.

817
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:30,002
The heart of the pharaoh bleeds for
his cousin and for the people of Israel.

818
01:21:30,178 --> 01:21:34,923
But alas, the pharaoh's
storehouses are empty.

819
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,175
There is barely enough grain
to feed Egypt.

820
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,643
The heart of a pharaoh cannot bleed
for it is bloodless.

821
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:44,020
The storehouses of Egypt are full.

822
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,394
By sacred Osiris, I swear to you,
I speak truth.

823
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:54,564
Dog of Egypt, you lie,
and your master lies.

824
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,613
It is only what I expected.

825
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:59,994
Charity is not to be found
among those...

826
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:03,250
...who make gods of vultures
and hyenas.

827
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:08,706
- Now go.
- Nathan, the prophet of God.

828
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,397
I come on a matter of justice, sire.

829
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:36,900
Hear and render judgment.

830
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,870
You may speak.

831
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,966
There were two men,
one rich and one poor.

832
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:57,551
The rich man owned
great flocks and herds.

833
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:00,807
But the poor man had naught
but one ewe lamb.

834
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,513
He reared it and it grew up with him
and his children.

835
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:08,479
It ate of his food and drank of his cup.
It was like a daughter to him.

836
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:12,101
Now there came a wayfarer
to the rich man asking meat.

837
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:15,944
But the rich man did not take
of his own flocks to feed his guest.

838
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:19,983
Instead, he took the poor man's
one ewe lamb and slew it...

839
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,283
...and prepared it for the wayfarer.

840
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,280
What is your verdict upon this man?

841
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,332
He shall restore the lamb seven-fold.

842
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,579
The lamb is dead, it cannot be restored.

843
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:33,542
Then the man deserves to die
because he had no pity.

844
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:36,384
You are the man.

845
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:54,064
You have made me pronounce
sentence upon myself.

846
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,153
Very well.

847
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,622
It is done.

848
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:10,408
Then there is no appeal.

849
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:14,166
It is the will of God,
and I accept it. Gladly.

850
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,831
It is not his will
that you should die, David.

851
01:24:17,009 --> 01:24:19,297
Worthy or unworthy,
you are his anointed.

852
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:22,091
Through Samuel,
he chose you to lead his people.

853
01:24:22,306 --> 01:24:25,509
Your labors in his behalf
are still unfinished.

854
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:28,354
But you cannot escape
the punishment of the Lord.

855
01:24:30,856 --> 01:24:33,311
I have not escaped it.

856
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:35,479
My son is dead.

857
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:38,190
His justice is still unsatisfied.

858
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:41,075
You've paid for your adultery,
but you have also killed.

859
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,741
You've taken up the sword and slain
your fellow creature for your desire.

860
01:24:45,287 --> 01:24:48,905
Now, therefore the sword shall
never depart from your house.

861
01:24:49,124 --> 01:24:52,290
You shall know the hatred
and ingratitude of your own flesh.

862
01:24:52,503 --> 01:24:56,500
Brother shall turn against brother
and son against father.

863
01:24:56,715 --> 01:25:00,926
The history of David's house
shall be a history written in blood.

864
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:03,217
You tell me nothing new.

865
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:07,596
- I am content.
- Even so the tally of the Lord is not paid.

866
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:11,635
The woman is being denounced.
She also must expiate her sin.

867
01:25:12,189 --> 01:25:13,980
She has lost her child.

868
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:17,102
- Is that not enough?
- Bathsheba has sinned...

869
01:25:17,277 --> 01:25:19,814
...and she must render payment
according to the law of Moses.

870
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:26,072
Uriah's death was my act and mine alone.

871
01:25:26,245 --> 01:25:28,486
She was a faithless wife.

872
01:25:28,664 --> 01:25:31,119
Faithless only because I made her so.

873
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:32,868
Could she deny the king?

874
01:25:33,043 --> 01:25:35,996
When I called her, could she refuse
to obey my commands?

875
01:25:43,929 --> 01:25:46,965
No. She would never lie for herself...

876
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,633
...and I will not lie for her.

877
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:54,886
But even if she sinned...

878
01:25:55,524 --> 01:25:57,931
...she has done no evil.

879
01:25:58,568 --> 01:26:01,734
She came to me
with love and tenderness.

880
01:26:01,947 --> 01:26:04,188
She lifted up my heart.

881
01:26:05,242 --> 01:26:07,151
She has brought no evil with her.

882
01:26:07,327 --> 01:26:09,948
She has brought adultery and murder.

883
01:26:10,163 --> 01:26:13,329
She has brought
the drought and the famine.

884
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,073
She has brought the wrath
of God upon Israel.

885
01:26:27,138 --> 01:26:29,379
They know the law and so does David.

886
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:31,798
Yes, I know the law.

887
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,931
Where are the accusers?

888
01:26:35,146 --> 01:26:38,728
Under the law,
they must cast the first stone.

889
01:26:40,443 --> 01:26:44,986
Where are those who will say that
I knew Bathsheba before our marriage?

890
01:26:49,243 --> 01:26:52,327
Who will dare to say it to my face?

891
01:26:57,001 --> 01:27:00,915
So there are no accusers.
You have none.

892
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,404
Michal.

893
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:35,363
I cannot find it in my heart
to blame you for what you do.

894
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:40,158
But you, Absalom...

895
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:42,787
â€¦my son.

896
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,795
Have I given you cause to hate me so?

897
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:50,133
Go, David, and bring Bathsheba here
to face her judges.

898
01:27:50,304 --> 01:27:51,798
You have made her a queen.

899
01:27:51,972 --> 01:27:55,637
It is not fitting that she should be
dragged to judgment by the people.

900
01:28:25,255 --> 01:28:26,914
My lady.

901
01:28:34,806 --> 01:28:37,343
Abishai, go to the stable
and get horses.

902
01:28:37,517 --> 01:28:39,593
Bring them to the gate
in the garden wall.

903
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:40,931
- Yes, sire.
- Not that way.

904
01:28:41,104 --> 01:28:44,021
They'll be watching.
Go by way of the terrace.

905
01:28:44,608 --> 01:28:46,730
We'll be out
before they know we've gone.

906
01:28:46,902 --> 01:28:48,360
Sire.

907
01:28:50,322 --> 01:28:52,361
The palace is surrounded.

908
01:28:54,492 --> 01:28:57,243
Call the guards. Surely my own
bodyguard can be trusted.

909
01:28:57,454 --> 01:28:59,493
Go. Go.

910
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:10,132
No, David.

911
01:29:12,385 --> 01:29:14,958
We cannot fight
against the will of God.

912
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:17,635
A God who punishes the guiltless?

913
01:29:19,976 --> 01:29:22,431
I am not without guilt, David.

914
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:30,892
Now I know how Uriah died.

915
01:29:38,327 --> 01:29:41,197
I think I really knew
before our marriage.

916
01:29:41,372 --> 01:29:46,366
Knew and put it from my mind,
I lacked the courage to face the truth.

917
01:29:46,544 --> 01:29:49,747
My guilt is as great as yours.

918
01:29:50,423 --> 01:29:51,833
Greater.

919
01:29:52,008 --> 01:29:54,333
Because I let you bear
the burden of it alone.

920
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:58,210
- I killed him.
- I wished him dead.

921
01:29:59,432 --> 01:30:02,349
God sees into our hearts, David.

922
01:30:11,193 --> 01:30:13,066
I am ready.

923
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,649
But I cannot let them take you.

924
01:30:18,868 --> 01:30:21,240
I cannot let you die.

925
01:30:28,752 --> 01:30:30,411
David.

926
01:30:32,381 --> 01:30:34,172
Yes, love.

927
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,604
In all our time together,
you have never played for me.

928
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:52,818
Something from your boyhood...

929
01:30:53,652 --> 01:30:56,059
...when you were a shepherd.

930
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:52,288
The Lord is my shepherd.

931
01:31:53,753 --> 01:31:55,875
I shall not want.

932
01:31:56,631 --> 01:32:00,580
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

933
01:32:01,135 --> 01:32:04,669
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

934
01:32:05,974 --> 01:32:08,429
He restoreth my soul.

935
01:32:08,643 --> 01:32:13,803
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

936
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:16,983
Yea.

937
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:22,483
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

938
01:32:22,782 --> 01:32:27,360
...I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.

939
01:32:27,954 --> 01:32:30,824
Thy rod and thy staff...

940
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:34,538
...they comfort me.

941
01:32:43,678 --> 01:32:46,714
Thou preparest a table before me...

942
01:32:46,889 --> 01:32:49,842
...in the presence of mine enemies.

943
01:32:50,893 --> 01:32:53,728
Thou anointest my head with oil...

944
01:32:54,522 --> 01:32:57,095
...my cup runneth over.

945
01:32:58,317 --> 01:33:02,017
Surely goodness and mercy...

946
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,737
...shall follow me
all the days of my life.

947
01:33:08,619 --> 01:33:11,703
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord...

948
01:33:14,124 --> 01:33:15,950
...forever.

949
01:33:41,235 --> 01:33:43,108
Goodness...

950
01:33:43,612 --> 01:33:45,604
...and mercy.

951
01:33:48,492 --> 01:33:50,864
When I wrote those words...

952
01:33:51,536 --> 01:33:54,287
...I believed in such a God.

953
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:59,411
I was only an ignorant shepherd boy.

954
01:34:01,004 --> 01:34:04,170
There was no one to teach me
about God.

955
01:34:05,258 --> 01:34:07,630
So I taught myself.

956
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,596
I saw him...

957
01:34:13,099 --> 01:34:15,091
...in the hills...

958
01:34:15,602 --> 01:34:17,890
...in the trees...

959
01:34:19,147 --> 01:34:22,480
...in the miracle of the birth of lambs.

960
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:28,400
I felt his mercy when the wolves
had fled and my flock was safe.

961
01:34:28,782 --> 01:34:32,649
When spring broke the grip
of snow and ice.

962
01:34:33,495 --> 01:34:39,497
When the cool wind blew
after the heat of the day...

963
01:34:41,336 --> 01:34:43,873
...I saw his splendor...

964
01:34:44,297 --> 01:34:47,796
...in the flowers blazing
on the hillsides...

965
01:34:49,177 --> 01:34:52,296
...and the stars burning in the sky.

966
01:34:53,931 --> 01:34:56,718
And knew his hand...

967
01:34:58,853 --> 01:35:00,810
...in everything.

968
01:35:07,904 --> 01:35:10,311
Then I wandered from him.

969
01:35:11,824 --> 01:35:14,741
And when I tried to find him again...

970
01:35:17,538 --> 01:35:18,818
...I had lost him.

971
01:35:22,376 --> 01:35:25,211
Somewhere in Saul's court...

972
01:35:26,547 --> 01:35:29,464
...or when I roamed the desert
in exile...

973
01:35:30,009 --> 01:35:32,844
...or in the camp of the Philistines.

974
01:35:35,514 --> 01:35:39,013
His image paled
in the lights of the cities...

975
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,806
...and his voice was drowned
in the quarreling and scheming...

976
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,098
...of the ambitious...

977
01:35:47,318 --> 01:35:49,606
...and the mighty.

978
01:35:51,572 --> 01:35:55,106
And now Nathan
has found him for me.

979
01:35:55,326 --> 01:35:58,659
Not the God of my boyhood days...

980
01:35:58,912 --> 01:36:01,663
...but a God without mercy.

981
01:36:01,874 --> 01:36:05,373
A God who thinks only of his justice.

982
01:36:09,715 --> 01:36:11,624
So you must die.

983
01:36:13,135 --> 01:36:17,547
As the soldier died when he tried
to save the Ark from falling.

984
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:21,844
He put his hands on the Ark like this:

985
01:36:35,866 --> 01:36:38,819
You shall not die.

986
01:36:49,337 --> 01:36:52,254
You shall not die.

987
01:36:59,097 --> 01:37:00,923
These are all who are willing, sire.

988
01:37:01,141 --> 01:37:03,976
They will be enough.
Take your stand at this door.

989
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:07,435
If anyone tries to enter, cut him down.

990
01:37:12,902 --> 01:37:14,811
You two at the right of the door.

991
01:37:14,988 --> 01:37:16,446
Two at the left.

992
01:37:16,781 --> 01:37:18,820
Two at the wall.

993
01:37:19,117 --> 01:37:22,735
You two at the stairs.
And you two at the gate here.

994
01:37:30,128 --> 01:37:32,998
- Where is the woman?
- She is not coming.

995
01:37:36,259 --> 01:37:38,335
Silence!

996
01:37:40,305 --> 01:37:42,381
He is the king.

997
01:37:51,649 --> 01:37:55,895
- You have heard the word of God.
- I have heard the word of Nathan.

998
01:37:56,112 --> 01:37:58,270
You have told me
that God demands justice.

999
01:37:58,447 --> 01:38:00,273
That I will believe.

1000
01:38:00,449 --> 01:38:03,948
I will not believe he would condemn
a helpless woman for another's crime.

1001
01:38:04,161 --> 01:38:06,118
- Where are you going?
- To the tabernacle.

1002
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:10,493
If God is what you say he is,
if this is truly his justice...

1003
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:12,369
...then let him speak for himself.

1004
01:38:12,545 --> 01:38:14,584
Will you go to him in anger?

1005
01:38:14,797 --> 01:38:17,038
He has shown me nothing but anger.

1006
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:18,835
He has turned his face from me.

1007
01:38:19,009 --> 01:38:22,045
It was David
who first turned his face from God.

1008
01:38:22,263 --> 01:38:24,504
Once there was a David
who knew how to pray...

1009
01:38:24,682 --> 01:38:27,351
...who sought nothing for himself
at the hands of God...

1010
01:38:27,518 --> 01:38:30,222
...who found his strength
in faith alone.

1011
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:35,264
If that David still lives,
his God will not deny him mercy.

1012
01:41:10,513 --> 01:41:12,055
O God.

1013
01:41:15,726 --> 01:41:18,643
Thou God of my early youth...

1014
01:41:20,022 --> 01:41:22,310
...hear my prayer.

1015
01:41:23,567 --> 01:41:25,892
Let thine eyes...

1016
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:30,029
...which alone see clearly...

1017
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,568
...fall upon thy worthless servant.

1018
01:41:36,663 --> 01:41:39,332
In all things...

1019
01:41:41,251 --> 01:41:43,706
...have I failed thee.

1020
01:41:44,338 --> 01:41:46,829
My life is a waste.

1021
01:41:47,257 --> 01:41:50,423
My crimes are many...

1022
01:41:51,345 --> 01:41:53,467
...and terrible.

1023
01:41:55,140 --> 01:42:00,382
To my sons, I have bequeathed
the evil that is in my blood.

1024
01:42:01,563 --> 01:42:07,767
I have led my people
into misery and want.

1025
01:42:08,236 --> 01:42:11,023
I have used thee...

1026
01:42:11,573 --> 01:42:14,064
...with ingratitude...

1027
01:42:15,202 --> 01:42:18,368
...and betrayed thy trust.

1028
01:42:20,749 --> 01:42:23,702
I have been a faithless...

1029
01:42:24,377 --> 01:42:26,416
...shepherd.

1030
01:42:29,215 --> 01:42:32,797
I am dust in the sight of thine eyes.

1031
01:42:33,762 --> 01:42:36,798
I am less than the meanest creature...

1032
01:42:37,015 --> 01:42:39,256
...crawling on the earth.

1033
01:42:40,685 --> 01:42:42,843
And, yet, O God...

1034
01:42:43,146 --> 01:42:46,431
...I am also thy creation.

1035
01:42:49,736 --> 01:42:51,609
Take not...

1036
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:57,783
...thy Holy Spirit from me.

1037
01:42:59,329 --> 01:43:01,368
Thy spirit...

1038
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:04,618
...which abode with me...

1039
01:43:04,834 --> 01:43:07,206
...in the wilderness.

1040
01:43:09,547 --> 01:43:12,915
I ask nothing for myself, O God.

1041
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,633
By my sins...

1042
01:43:15,803 --> 01:43:20,511
...I have put myself beyond the compass
of thy forgiveness.

1043
01:43:23,478 --> 01:43:27,096
But lift thine hand from thy people...

1044
01:43:27,315 --> 01:43:30,315
...who suffer for my crimes.

1045
01:43:30,902 --> 01:43:34,401
Forgive them the sin
that is not theirs...

1046
01:43:35,031 --> 01:43:36,940
...but mine.

1047
01:43:37,908 --> 01:43:41,442
Let the land thou gavest their fathers...

1048
01:43:41,871 --> 01:43:44,540
...flow once more...

1049
01:43:44,915 --> 01:43:47,666
...with thine abundance.

1050
01:43:58,637 --> 01:44:01,756
And let Bathsheba live...

1051
01:44:03,517 --> 01:44:06,090
...to praise thy name...

1052
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:09,557
...and testify to thy mercy.

1053
01:44:11,567 --> 01:44:15,101
Show her the loving kindness
of thy heart.

1054
01:44:16,822 --> 01:44:19,229
Cleanse her from sin...

1055
01:44:25,247 --> 01:44:27,820
...and let thy punishment...

1056
01:44:28,167 --> 01:44:31,370
...fall on thy servant
who has earned it.

1057
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:36,712
Look not on the sinner...

1058
01:44:36,925 --> 01:44:39,297
...who comes before thee...

1059
01:44:41,263 --> 01:44:44,133
...but on the boy he was...

1060
01:44:44,349 --> 01:44:46,471
...who loved thee...

1061
01:44:46,685 --> 01:44:49,935
...and who would have died for thee.

1062
01:44:51,023 --> 01:44:53,810
Make my heart as his.

1063
01:44:55,652 --> 01:44:58,321
Let the boy live again...

1064
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:01,402
...in his innocence.

1065
01:45:03,702 --> 01:45:06,537
Grant him thy mercy...

1066
01:45:07,622 --> 01:45:10,658
...and take this David's life.

1067
01:45:32,397 --> 01:45:34,306
David?

1068
01:45:34,566 --> 01:45:36,724
David?

1069
01:45:39,571 --> 01:45:41,148
David?

1070
01:45:42,073 --> 01:45:43,615
David?

1071
01:45:45,159 --> 01:45:48,278
Your father bids you
come to his house.

1072
01:45:48,496 --> 01:45:50,322
I am to stay with the sheep.

1073
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:53,908
The prophet is there,
the prophet Samuel himself.

1074
01:45:54,127 --> 01:45:58,171
It is said that he comes
to choose a king over Israel.

1075
01:46:04,804 --> 01:46:06,547
Eliab.

1076
01:46:07,974 --> 01:46:09,717
Abinadab.

1077
01:46:11,602 --> 01:46:13,428
Shammah.

1078
01:46:18,109 --> 01:46:20,397
The Lord has not chosen one of these.

1079
01:46:20,611 --> 01:46:22,899
Any father would be proud
of such sons.

1080
01:46:23,114 --> 01:46:25,984
You do well to feel pride, Jesse.

1081
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,070
But the Lord does not see
as man sees

1082
01:46:29,286 --> 01:46:31,823
...for man looks on the
outward appearance...

1083
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:34,530
...but the Lord looks on the heart.

1084
01:46:35,543 --> 01:46:36,741
Who is this?

1085
01:46:36,961 --> 01:46:39,748
My youngest son, David,
who tends the sheep.

1086
01:46:39,964 --> 01:46:44,875
But he's only a boy, a dreamer,
a singer of songs.

1087
01:46:45,094 --> 01:46:47,382
Come hither, David.

1088
01:47:04,947 --> 01:47:07,568
The Lord has chosen.

1089
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:17,663
Honor him, David.

1090
01:47:17,876 --> 01:47:19,998
Walk in his light...

1091
01:47:20,212 --> 01:47:22,749
...and you shall serve him...

1092
01:47:22,965 --> 01:47:26,298
...as few are permitted to serve.

1093
01:47:35,018 --> 01:47:39,763
Where is your champion, Hebrews?

1094
01:47:39,981 --> 01:47:45,188
Who will stand forth and face me?

1095
01:47:45,403 --> 01:47:47,561
It is the giant of Gath, sire...

1096
01:47:47,781 --> 01:47:51,861
...challenging us to send a champion
against him and so decide the battle.

1097
01:47:52,077 --> 01:47:54,698
Sire, the men have heard his challenge
these 40 dawns.

1098
01:47:54,913 --> 01:47:57,285
They cower like whipped dogs at his voice.

1099
01:47:57,499 --> 01:48:00,250
Unless, he is met,
and soon, our cause is lost.

1100
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:05,335
And is there no one in the ranks of Israel
who dares to meet this man?

1101
01:48:05,507 --> 01:48:08,543
Sire, if Goliath were only a man,
any one of us would go.

1102
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,586
But he's like no man born of woman.

1103
01:48:10,804 --> 01:48:15,679
His height is six cubits and a span,
and his spear is like a weaver's beam.

1104
01:48:15,892 --> 01:48:20,055
They are dogs, indeed,
to run before one Philistine.

1105
01:48:20,271 --> 01:48:21,895
Is there no courage in Israel?

1106
01:48:22,065 --> 01:48:24,816
Sire, courage alone is not enough.

1107
01:48:25,026 --> 01:48:27,481
No arrow can pierce the giant's armor.

1108
01:48:27,695 --> 01:48:31,146
No spear can thrust
beneath the reach of his arms.

1109
01:48:31,366 --> 01:48:34,984
He casts his spear
a hundred long paces.

1110
01:48:35,203 --> 01:48:39,034
We call ourselves
"the chosen of the Lord."

1111
01:48:39,248 --> 01:48:44,242
Are we to let the enemies of God
take Israel because we lack a champion?

1112
01:48:44,462 --> 01:48:47,581
Sire, I will meet Goliath.

1113
01:48:47,799 --> 01:48:50,835
Who is it that speaks? Come forward.

1114
01:48:57,308 --> 01:49:00,593
- David, my armor bearer.
- I will meet him, sire.

1115
01:49:00,811 --> 01:49:02,269
Sire.

1116
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,397
Samuel calls this boy
the Lord's anointed.

1117
01:49:05,566 --> 01:49:07,225
If you let him to face the giant...

1118
01:49:07,401 --> 01:49:09,108
...Samuel's prophecy can be proved...

1119
01:49:09,278 --> 01:49:11,270
...or disproved.

1120
01:49:12,823 --> 01:49:15,574
David, you may meet Goliath.

1121
01:49:15,785 --> 01:49:17,742
No, David. Father, he is my friend.

1122
01:49:17,912 --> 01:49:20,034
Silence, Jonathan.

1123
01:49:20,247 --> 01:49:23,450
- Go, David.
- With God, David.

1124
01:49:24,126 --> 01:49:26,248
Is Goliath a dog...

1125
01:49:26,462 --> 01:49:30,293
...that you send a boy to meet him?

1126
01:49:31,675 --> 01:49:37,594
Come closer, little one. Come closer.

1127
01:49:38,599 --> 01:49:41,552
Come closer, little one.

1128
01:49:45,064 --> 01:49:47,471
My father, let me go down
in David's place.

1129
01:49:47,691 --> 01:49:49,315
No, Jonathan.

1130
01:49:49,526 --> 01:49:54,816
Let the Philistine prove the folly
of Samuel's prophecy.

1131
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,196
David, David, get up.

1132
01:53:31,454 --> 01:53:34,787
No man can ever hope to know
the real nature of God.

1133
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,285
But he has given us
a glimpse of his face.
