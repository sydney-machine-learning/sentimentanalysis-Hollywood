00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:12,561
<i>This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.</i>

2
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,571
<i>We're bringing in a wounded cop.</i>

3
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,497
<i>All right, 10-4.</i>

4
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,677
8th Precinct.

5
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,320
Jesus Christ.

6
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:46,061
Guess who got shot.

7
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,831
Serpico.

8
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,573
You think a cop did it?

9
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,773
I know six cops
said they'd like to.

10
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:14,792
Hello.

11
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,728
<i>New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.</i>

12
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:21,629
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,799
<i>- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.</i>

14
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,720
<i>To be a police officer
means to believe in the law...</i>

15
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,267
<i>and to enforce it impartially...</i>

16
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:59,428
respecting the equality
of all men...

17
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,598
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

18
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:07,435
Every day, your life
will be on the line...

19
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,844
and also your character.

20
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:13,509
You'll need integrity,
courage, honesty...

21
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:16,645
compassion, courtesy...

22
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,484
and perseverance...

23
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:20,683
and patience.

24
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:25,286
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

25
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:29,163
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

26
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,703
Same time, same place...
both reports.

27
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,645
I already made out a 424.

28
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46,240
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

29
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,342
Who was with Serpico?

30
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,786
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

31
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:54,586
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

32
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,991
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.

33
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,137
Another thing...
I want a 24-hour guard on Serpico.

34
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,473
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.

35
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,604
<i>Anthony Sardo.</i>

36
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,143
<i>Ralph Seidler.</i>

37
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:26,748
Frank Serpico.

38
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,397
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.

39
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,034
Get closer!

40
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,433
Patrolman Serpico.

41
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,162
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.

42
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:38,487
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

43
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:40,956
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.

44
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:44,153
Any questions, older guys will
fill you in. Good luck.

45
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:09,150
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!

46
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,745
Gather around. Let's go.

47
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,813
All right. Settle down.

48
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:20,457
All right. Just a few announcements
today and two new men.

49
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:24,228
On the board on my left,
you see squad one, blue sector...

50
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,496
squad two, red sector...

51
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,504
squad three, green sector.

52
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:32,872
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

53
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,706
I'll help the boys, Florence.

54
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,042
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

55
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:39,309
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?

56
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:42,250
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...

57
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:45,186
How about a roast beef on roll?

58
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,356
Yeah, okay. You go through
the line. I'll bring it over.

59
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:58,401
Peluce, it's all fat here.

60
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,663
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.

61
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:07,176
Sit down, sit down.

62
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:10,805
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

63
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:13,748
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.

64
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:17,309
Charlie's okay. We give him a break
on double parking on deliveries.

65
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:26,558
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

66
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,326
Frank, generally, you just sort of
take what Charlie gives you.

67
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:41,475
<i>Sector D-David, 1034,
possible rape in progress...</i>

68
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:45,948
<i>vicinity of PS 218,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.</i>

69
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,686
Becker, aren't
we gonna take that?

70
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,348
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.

71
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,618
It's on the borderline.

72
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,395
I'm gonna take it.

73
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:03,126
D sector, 1547, 10-4.

74
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:36,363
Oh, my God!

75
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:43,534
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!

76
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,041
Oh, shit!

77
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,340
- Come on. Give us...
- Don't shoot now.

78
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,902
Be cool.

79
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,505
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.

80
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,915
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!

81
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:57,749
I said put them
motherfucking guns away!

82
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,914
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

83
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:05,220
Turn the motherfucking
light out, man.

84
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,820
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.

85
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:11,066
Now, you just be cool,
goddamn it.

86
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,228
Just be cool. All right.

87
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:16,067
All right. All right.
That's it.

88
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:43,400
The other one took his thing out.

89
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:48,730
He put it up to my mouth.

90
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,934
He... He held me down.

91
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:57,741
They said if I didn't do it...

92
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,750
they'd kill me.

93
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,716
She's gonna make
a hell of a witness.

94
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,885
Would you like a stretcher?

95
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,808
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

96
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,852
Okay, hard-on.

97
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,127
Who were your playmates?

98
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,995
Hey, Frank,
you want a piece of this?

99
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,663
No. I'm gonna fill out
the arrest card.

100
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,888
Hey, Charlie, let me have
five minutes with him.

101
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:55,898
- Sure.
- Thanks.

102
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,772
Thank you, Charlie.

103
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:14,182
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

104
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,879
How come you didn't
stay for the fun?

105
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:19,047
That's not my kind of fun.

106
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,391
Shit.

107
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,056
I want to talk to you.

108
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,657
I want to take you across the
street, get you a cup of coffee...

109
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,361
without cuffs.

110
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:38,568
Now, look. I didn't touch you
upstairs, right?

111
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:41,702
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

112
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,211
Understand?

113
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:46,915
Come on.

114
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:54,415
<i>It's a goddamn shame you gotta take
this whole rap yourself.</i>

115
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:59,754
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

116
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:04,261
Maybe you just
went along for the ride.

117
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,598
I got a feeling
you just went along.

118
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,137
But you're the one
who got caught.

119
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,540
You never even
got your cock out.

120
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,443
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

121
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:25,085
Look at you.

122
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,851
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

123
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,561
I don't understand you,
you know that?

124
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,723
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

125
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,768
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.

126
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,929
You don't owe them nothin'.

127
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,435
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

128
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,444
What can I get?

129
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,315
Oh, let's see...
kidnapping...

130
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:55,510
sodomy, rape...

131
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,879
Are you kidding me?

132
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:08,230
You talk to me.
Save yourself.

133
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,067
Let it go, Harv!

134
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,682
Take the shot.

135
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,945
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.

136
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,317
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

137
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:35,552
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.

138
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,527
<i>- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!</i>

139
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:40,529
<i>- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!</i>

140
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:10,082
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!

141
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,526
Turn around. Turn around.

142
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,698
- Ow!
- Spread!

143
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:21,727
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

144
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,739
Turn around slow.

145
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:40,289
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

146
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:46,221
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

147
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:50,156
We take the collar.

148
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,533
A collar like this, don't look good,
a patrolman takes it.

149
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:55,936
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.

150
00:17:56,006 --> 00:18:00,067
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass
on this. It's my collar.

151
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:03,476
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.

152
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:08,246
Left your post, the street, entered
the school yard without permission...

153
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:11,310
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?

154
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:16,189
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

155
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,854
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

156
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,836
Come on, Frankie!

157
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:30,362
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?

158
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,973
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

159
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:55,355
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?

160
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:03,495
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?

161
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:05,700
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?

162
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:08,745
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?

163
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,007
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.

164
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:13,413
Rev it up. Rev it up!

165
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,379
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?

166
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:20,389
Okay. Good job.

167
00:19:20,457 --> 00:19:22,391
You people do good work here.

168
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,754
So, how you doing, Frankie?

169
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,095
You keep asking me that. What's
the matter with you? I'm doing okay!

170
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:34,126
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

171
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,297
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.

172
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:40,036
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

173
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,012
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.

174
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:47,778
Don't invite people over
if you're not sure I'm gonna come.

175
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,615
I mean it, now. If I want to
see Marianne, I'll call her.

176
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,918
What's going on
with you two anyway?

177
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:57,324
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

178
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:01,893
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?

179
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,525
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne...

180
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:08,697
her father's a cop, her brother's
a cop, her uncle's a cop.

181
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,798
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!

182
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:17,274
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.

183
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:20,714
Mama tells me that you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

184
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,082
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

185
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,754
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

186
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,757
NYU? Greenwich Village?

187
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,986
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?

188
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,256
The old neighborhood's
not good enough for ya?

189
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,127
Tell Pop I was here.

190
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:37,063
Frankie, Sunday?

191
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:39,659
Sunday what?

192
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,863
Dinner? Huh?

193
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,173
- Do me one favor... no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.

194
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,336
All right.
A couple of announcements.

195
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,676
"Announcing a course in
fingerprint identification...

196
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,840
to be given at John Jay College.

197
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,009
This course will be available
to those patrolmen...

198
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:57,178
who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

199
00:20:57,254 --> 00:21:00,451
to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI...

200
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:03,925
which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

201
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:06,827
Signed, Captain McGuire."

202
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:09,092
On the board on my left,
you see squad one...

203
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:14,236
Hot enough for ya?

204
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:17,034
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

205
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:19,371
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

206
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:42,393
You know how long
you're taking on that one?

207
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,832
Check one print category, two...
That's plenty.

208
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:51,537
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.

209
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:55,676
How long you been
with the BCI now, Serpico?

210
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:58,306
All my life.

211
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:01,613
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

212
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:05,121
Barto, it's not just that.

213
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,953
You don't like me.

214
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,585
BCI never had
a weirdo cop before.

215
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:14,028
Barto, stop buggin' me.

216
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:25,868
Mama?

217
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,710
Wanna buy a puppy?

218
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:18,921
Look at that, huh?

219
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,483
Where'd you get these dogs?

220
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,661
Oh, they're mine.

221
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,861
Want one for free?

222
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:34,426
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.

223
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:38,107
You got it.

224
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:46,749
Okay, now which one
of you guys wanna come with me?

225
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,250
What?

226
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,554
Come on.

227
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,454
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

228
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:57,551
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.

229
00:24:57,628 --> 00:24:59,562
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

230
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:32,086
Don Quixote.

231
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:51,380
Señorita Land?

232
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,587
Mr. Serpico.

233
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:01,522
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.

234
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:04,254
Well, I'm going to work
at the Café Reggio.

235
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:06,262
Café Reggio.

236
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:13,033
- That's 4th Street and...
- MacDougal and 3rd.

237
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:15,298
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.

238
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,265
Jesus, what's that?

239
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,742
You got your hands on
my money belt. Don't do that.

240
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,211
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

241
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,511
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!

242
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:30,883
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

243
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:32,888
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

244
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:34,856
- Come on.
- That's the truth.

245
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:37,416
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

246
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,928
- What do you do?
- Me?

247
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:44,263
I'm an actress, a singer,
a dancer and a Buddhist.

248
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,201
In that order?

249
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:51,640
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

250
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:16,833
Those leaps that guy made,
what do you call 'em again?

251
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,492
Jetés.

252
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:25,808
You try it.

253
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:28,936
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

254
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:37,177
Next life. Come on.

255
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,717
What are you reading now,
Serpico?

256
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:48,395
<i>My Life by Isadora Duncan.</i>

257
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,897
She was a ballet dancer.

258
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,266
A belly dancer?

259
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:58,843
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.

260
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,070
- You know ballet?
- A little.

261
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:06,878
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.

262
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,818
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.

263
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,447
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?

264
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,457
That's where I go
after I leave here.

265
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:17,551
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.

266
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,062
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

267
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,256
I noticed.

268
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,924
There's five positions.

269
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,161
Five pos...
You're being shortchanged.

270
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,034
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?

271
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:30,665
Watch. See?

272
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,333
This is the first position.

273
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:34,673
From this position,
I can do anything.

274
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,576
- You want to see?
- Sure.

275
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,581
Here we go.

276
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,519
Bye, Barto!

277
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,149
- Lieutenant Steiger...
- No, no. Later.

278
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:57,725
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.

279
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:00,870
Positions, positions!

280
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,997
Positions like that you don't see
in a pretzel factory.

281
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:07,134
Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

282
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:10,339
She's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

283
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:13,406
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

284
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,475
Barto wants a specimen.

285
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,850
I'm gonna look into this matter.

286
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:25,252
- What do you got there?
- Here.

287
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,921
Straight ahead.

288
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,701
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

289
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:36,270
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

290
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,708
She just pulled down the shade.

291
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,839
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

292
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:50,018
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

293
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,919
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!

294
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,255
Were you goin' down on him?

295
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,966
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?

296
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,968
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

297
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,470
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!

298
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,168
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on 'em!

299
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,943
There!

300
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:19,909
You actually accusing me of this?

301
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,252
Good morning, Captain McClain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

302
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:28,484
I was told I could
talk to you, sir.

303
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:34,096
Certainly, son.
Come in.

304
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:40,328
Lieutenant Steiger
won't make a report.

305
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:43,999
He's too concerned with
the image of his department.

306
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:47,373
But it... it could affect
your future in the BCI.

307
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,347
Sir, I tell you...

308
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,681
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.

309
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:59,951
It was bullshit about it being
a path toward being detective...

310
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,185
because I've been there
two years now...

311
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,193
And you want a transfer.

312
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:07,954
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

313
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,732
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

314
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:16,539
Francis, do you know about my
weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

315
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,737
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

316
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:25,441
You are Catholic?

317
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,044
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.

318
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,248
Alfie, come on.

319
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,494
I missed you, baby.

320
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:43,160
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.

321
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,928
Why Paco?

322
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:48,028
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?

323
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:51,438
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.

324
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,374
Well, what'll I call you...

325
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,471
Frank or Paco?

326
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:16,422
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.

327
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,025
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.

328
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,367
But he works for
an advertising agency.

329
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:23,998
Sally's an actress,
but works for a photographer.

330
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,371
Paco's a policeman.

331
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,501
That's terrific.

332
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,136
I work for the police department.

333
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,340
- That's really nice.
- Wow.

334
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:33,607
See ya.

335
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,579
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.

336
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,918
But you're working for an insurance
company now, aren't you?

337
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,550
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

338
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,685
Really? How exciting!

339
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:48,197
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

340
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,893
Listen,
I file insurance policies.

341
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,002
We should get together then,
file or something.

342
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:57,063
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

343
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:01,578
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

344
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,944
Think about that. I wanna
ask you something else too.

345
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,074
Will you do me a big favor?

346
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,176
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

347
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,188
You know, let me just sort of
do it myself.

348
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,190
Okay.

349
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,467
Hey, man,
are you really a cop?

350
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,268
- Right. I am.
- Wow.

351
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:31,432
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.

352
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,773
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.

353
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,642
What's a mind fucker?

354
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:38,772
Well, that's a chick...

355
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,182
who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

356
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:44,345
Oh, yeah?

357
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,685
Well, she's very perceptive.

358
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:55,993
You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

359
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:58,034
it's too rigidly stylized.

360
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:01,628
Well, yeah, you know...
Yeah, but...

361
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,167
I think after a while,
when you get through that...

362
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:11,078
you start to appreciate the
clarity... you know, the authority.

363
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,776
I got a sheep dog.

364
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,910
There have been
sheep dogs in my family...

365
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,319
dating back...

366
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,118
for 16 generations...

367
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:25,126
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!

368
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,892
The family crest...

369
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:32,299
is a sheep dog
pissing into a gondola.

370
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:33,802
Oh, shit!

371
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,779
Paco, everybody loves you!

372
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:46,179
I love you!

373
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,514
Hey, Lieutenant,
my wife call for me?

374
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,892
Give her this, will ya?

375
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:01,420
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

376
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:04,797
That fucking thing on your lip,
it goes. And get a haircut.

377
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,768
- Sir...
- That's an order.

378
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:08,771
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

379
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:15,535
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.

380
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:18,206
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.

381
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,546
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?

382
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,844
Thank you, sir.

383
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,756
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

384
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:33,356
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

385
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:36,158
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.

386
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,256
I thought so.

387
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:43,899
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

388
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:46,770
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

389
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:49,901
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

390
00:35:49,978 --> 00:35:52,469
An undercover cop walks around
in disguise...

391
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,481
wearing black shoes
and white socks.

392
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:57,509
Everybody knows who he is.

393
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,815
You made your point.

394
00:35:59,888 --> 00:36:02,220
I want you to keep your mustache.

395
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:05,825
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

396
00:36:05,894 --> 00:36:08,863
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

397
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,727
I'd like that, sir.

398
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,863
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

399
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,368
No shit.

400
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:09,556
Hold it!

401
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:14,056
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,155
Oh, Christ!

403
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,498
Quick. Get against there.

404
00:37:22,537 --> 00:37:23,970
Hey!

405
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:26,006
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!

406
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:28,599
Hey! It's me, Serpico!

407
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:34,309
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!

408
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:36,782
Poli... I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!

409
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:39,877
Jesus, Frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

410
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:44,413
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

411
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:48,451
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

412
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:51,896
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

413
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,801
Oh, shit.

414
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:59,502
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

415
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,614
Holy shit.

416
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,810
Look at that mess.

417
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,183
Filling out forms till next month.

418
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:19,021
Good.

419
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:21,220
Hey, Jesus, Frank...

420
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:23,560
I know it's a hell
of a time to ask you...

421
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:26,122
but I'm gonna have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit...

422
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,462
Good. You should.

423
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:31,266
It's gonna look like hell if I
don't have anything to show for it.

424
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:34,672
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.

425
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:41,310
You motherfucker.

426
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:48,748
You want the collar, huh? You
don't wanna fill out forms, right?

427
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,094
Here.

428
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,502
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.

429
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:12,541
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.

430
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:16,743
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

431
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:19,685
so that when you become
plainclothesmen...

432
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:23,622
you'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

433
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:27,218
and recognize the disorienting effect
of the drug...

434
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:32,062
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

435
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,397
Among users of the drug...

436
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:36,869
a marijuana cigarette...

437
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:40,101
is referred to as reefer...

438
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:44,577
stick, roach, joint.

439
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:48,547
The drug itself
is referred to as pot...

440
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:50,550
tea, boo...

441
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:53,711
stuff, grass.

442
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:57,820
Hey, this is real good shit.

443
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:01,360
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

444
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:05,160
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.

445
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:08,396
And I have to have some,
and I love you... I love it.

446
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:12,633
Have some of that. We have
nothing to... I have to have a dime?

447
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:15,608
The dime goes
in the little slot there.

448
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:18,736
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.

449
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:21,646
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...

450
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:24,014
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!

451
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:27,418
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!

452
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:32,192
You're pretty fuckin' weird
for a cop.

453
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,626
Me? You!

454
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:36,993
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?

455
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:39,465
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

456
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,024
The two of us.

457
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:45,030
Give me.

458
00:40:46,974 --> 00:40:49,067
Where you supposed
to go from here?

459
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:53,739
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.

460
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:57,677
You?

461
00:40:57,752 --> 00:41:00,812
I am scheduled to go
on special assignment...

462
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:04,380
with the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

463
00:41:06,794 --> 00:41:09,558
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

464
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,962
No four years in plainclothes?

465
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:15,731
Who do you know?

466
00:41:15,803 --> 00:41:19,637
I make it my business to know
people... people who can help.

467
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,140
Unfair.

468
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,474
Unfair.

469
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,843
Life is unfair, pal.

470
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:30,372
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I...

471
00:41:30,451 --> 00:41:32,976
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?

472
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:36,922
You and me in a Batmobile, we could
clean up the whole city in no time.

473
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:39,585
I wonder if we can get candy
out of this machine though.

474
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,559
No, thanks.

475
00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:54,805
Well, this is a good place
to tell you, Paco.

476
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:00,608
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

477
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:07,714
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months...

478
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:09,847
unless you marry me.

479
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,763
What about the theater
and your dancing?

480
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:25,897
A girl has to get
married sometime.

481
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:30,043
Well, you're a long way
from sometime, Leslie.

482
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,205
I thought you were committed.

483
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:36,549
I am, but...

484
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:40,553
You are, but?

485
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:45,749
I can go on working,
studying there.

486
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,457
Where? Fort Worth?

487
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:51,155
Amarillo.

488
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:02,872
Well, am I invited
to the wedding?

489
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:07,075
I'll ask Roy.

490
00:43:12,686 --> 00:43:15,120
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

491
00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:17,123
Here you go.

492
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:21,093
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the
best time for policy and bookmaking.

493
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:25,556
If you have to work nights, like
a liquor violation, just call in.

494
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,999
Don't worry about
quotas right now.

495
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:31,197
Couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

496
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,409
Been holding this for you.

497
00:43:44,485 --> 00:43:46,953
It's from Jewish Max.

498
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,401
First day on the precinct,
I get that.

499
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:50,116
This is great, Frank.

500
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,013
I can open up a whole can
of peas with this.

501
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:56,681
It's scary.

502
00:44:57,892 --> 00:45:00,588
I wanna protect myself.

503
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,856
- You know what we do with this?
- What?

504
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,524
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.

505
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:14,239
Kellogg... Didn't he used
to be in plainclothes?

506
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:17,869
He's the second-highest ranking cop
in the department of investigations.

507
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,243
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"

508
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:22,578
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

509
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,743
He owes me.
You understand?

510
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:28,250
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.

511
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:32,888
Frank, trust me.

512
00:45:44,705 --> 00:45:49,404
Things like this were common
practice in the bad old days.

513
00:45:49,476 --> 00:45:51,740
Hard to believe
it's still going on.

514
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:58,111
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

515
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:01,018
taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

516
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:09,289
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

517
00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:12,526
How would I know what was in it
unless I took it?

518
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,125
You have two alternatives.

519
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:18,569
You can force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

520
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,903
He'll drag you in front
of a grand jury.

521
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:24,433
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.

522
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,445
Word will get out.

523
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:30,449
Before it's all over, they'll find
you face-down in the East River.

524
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,491
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

525
00:46:41,562 --> 00:46:43,826
Well, what do I do with this?

526
00:47:06,086 --> 00:47:08,213
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?

527
00:47:11,725 --> 00:47:14,694
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.

528
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,834
Well, I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

529
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:37,550
Alfie, come on.

530
00:47:59,273 --> 00:48:01,207
Is that Bjoerling?

531
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:09,582
No. It's DiStefano.

532
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:14,379
I was sure it was Bjoerling.

533
00:48:21,495 --> 00:48:24,157
You could hear it
better over here.

534
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:27,226
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

535
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:29,836
For coffee.

536
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:34,601
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

537
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:37,803
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

538
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:40,807
Not me.

539
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:43,145
What are you,
dedicated or somethin'?

540
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:47,916
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

541
00:48:47,988 --> 00:48:51,287
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.

542
00:48:57,398 --> 00:48:58,831
Love my garden.

543
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:02,863
Okay. I love your garden.

544
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:06,272
You know what they say,
don't you?

545
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:09,166
No. What do they say?

546
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:13,337
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

547
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:21,721
You like her, Alfie?

548
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:25,919
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

549
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:28,393
I gotta get out of the 93.

550
00:49:28,462 --> 00:49:31,795
Well, what happened on
your narcotics application?

551
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:35,825
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.

552
00:49:35,903 --> 00:49:37,700
It was like
the kiss of death.

553
00:49:37,772 --> 00:49:41,037
They think everybody in clothes
is on the take.

554
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:43,770
Sir, do you know anything about
the Bronx 7th Division?

555
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:47,803
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

556
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:51,374
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

557
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:53,044
Come on, Alfie.

558
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:57,747
Frank, did anyone
ever tell you...

559
00:49:57,825 --> 00:50:00,419
that you have a tendency
toward self-pity?

560
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:04,528
No, you're the first.

561
00:50:04,598 --> 00:50:08,125
All right. Frank, I have
a friend up there, Roy Palmer.

562
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:12,332
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.

563
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:14,704
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.

564
00:50:14,775 --> 00:50:16,936
- God bless you.
- Right.

565
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:28,581
<i>Frank, Captain McClain here.</i>

566
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:30,749
Captain McClain. Could you
hold on a minute please, sir?

567
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:32,258
<i>Sure.</i>

568
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:41,233
Yeah. Sorry.

569
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:43,236
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight...

570
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:46,831
and he assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

571
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:49,307
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."

572
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:53,113
<i>I told him he was getting
a hardworking officer...</i>

573
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,116
wears a beard, speaks Spanish and
would make a superb undercover man.

574
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,446
He was delighted.

575
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:02,512
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

576
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,615
<i>Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.</i>

577
00:51:07,228 --> 00:51:09,822
When did you start doing that?

578
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:13,930
McClain says that Palmer says...

579
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,401
that the 7th is as clean
as a hound's tooth.

580
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:20,630
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

581
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:27,780
Plainclothes division.

582
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:31,050
Upstairs.

583
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:44,657
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.

584
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:46,791
We heard you were
coming up here. Listen.

585
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:49,995
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

586
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:52,904
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?

587
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:56,340
Hey, babe, you're gonna
love it up here. It's beautiful.

588
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,469
Listen, take...
I'll see youse later, all right?

589
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,912
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.

590
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:03,006
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.

591
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:08,251
<i>Deck the halls
with boughs of holly</i>

592
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,523
Ten grand, Dallas...
if Minnesota. Right.

593
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:18,292
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...

594
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:22,298
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

595
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:24,394
We told you to stay the fuck
out of here.

596
00:52:24,472 --> 00:52:27,236
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.

597
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:29,367
Bullshit.

598
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:31,206
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

599
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,542
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.

600
00:52:33,614 --> 00:52:37,675
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.

601
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:39,946
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.

602
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,853
Hey, what, are you getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

603
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:45,551
- Three.
- Three?

604
00:52:45,626 --> 00:52:47,287
You heard me.

605
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:51,559
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.

606
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:58,498
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

607
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:00,506
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.

608
00:53:00,574 --> 00:53:02,007
I better check in.

609
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:07,276
We're gonna have
a little talk later, right?

610
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:13,845
That dumb schmuck only came up with
two bills because I booked him?

611
00:53:16,724 --> 00:53:18,214
Here you go, Frank.

612
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:20,886
It was your collar.
Keep it.

613
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:24,854
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

614
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:29,400
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

615
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,097
Now, I ain't sayin' who.

616
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:33,834
They just said you couldn't
be trusted, you know?

617
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:37,707
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.

618
00:53:37,778 --> 00:53:40,269
Let's face it. Who can trust
a cop who don't take money?

619
00:53:41,248 --> 00:53:43,842
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid?

620
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:46,682
And with that call, the guys
were gettin' a little worried.

621
00:53:46,754 --> 00:53:49,552
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.

622
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:52,956
You'd never hurt
another cop, right?

623
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:56,954
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, Frank?

624
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:59,829
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

625
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:07,402
We're not doing
anything bad here.

626
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:10,136
We're skimming
a little gambling money.

627
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:13,237
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.

628
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:15,248
Come on, Frank.

629
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:18,615
Gamblers are gentlemen, and
they're gonna operate anyhow, right?

630
00:54:18,686 --> 00:54:21,211
Look, Keough, you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

631
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:24,416
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?

632
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:27,460
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?

633
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:30,156
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?

634
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:33,564
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.

635
00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:35,625
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.

636
00:54:35,703 --> 00:54:39,002
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy...

637
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:41,166
they get your ass
in hot water every time.

638
00:54:41,242 --> 00:54:43,767
But the Italians, now,
that's a different story.

639
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:47,075
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

640
00:54:47,147 --> 00:54:50,446
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.

641
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:52,212
It's worth it.

642
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:55,778
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

643
00:54:57,891 --> 00:55:01,918
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

644
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:06,399
That's 800 clams every time your
girlfriend gets the curse tax free.

645
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:10,260
Here's the beauty. You don't
get it for the first eight weeks...

646
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:13,067
till the guys get to
know you and you're okay.

647
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,768
But you don't lose, either, 'cause
you get it on the other end...

648
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:18,573
when you leave the division.

649
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:21,672
Frankie, it's like...
it's like severance pay.

650
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:26,412
Think it over, all right?
In or out.

651
00:55:29,223 --> 00:55:31,783
Look at me. I'm shaking.

652
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:38,229
All my life I wanted
to be a cop, you know?

653
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:40,665
It's like I can remember
nothing else.

654
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:46,330
I remember this one time...

655
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:49,675
there was...

656
00:55:49,743 --> 00:55:52,268
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.

657
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:54,280
Somebody stabbed somebody.

658
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:57,716
And...

659
00:55:57,785 --> 00:56:00,345
there was this crowd
around this tenement.

660
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:04,789
I must have been nine,
ten years old. I was this big.

661
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:06,792
I went over to see
what was going on.

662
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,057
I noticed the red light
goin' around and around...

663
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,564
all these people,
and I couldn't see.

664
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:17,126
I kept saying, "Do you know
what's goin' on? Do you know?"

665
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:19,365
Nobody knew.

666
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,637
It was like a big mystery
behind that...

667
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,337
that crowd there.

668
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:27,846
All of a sudden...

669
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:29,974
the crowd just parted...

670
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,416
like the Red Sea, you see?

671
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:36,047
And there were these guys
in blue, and I said...

672
00:56:36,123 --> 00:56:37,954
"They know."

673
00:56:39,026 --> 00:56:41,996
What do they know?
What do they know?

674
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,462
It's amazing.

675
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,504
It's incredible...

676
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:55,542
but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.

677
00:56:59,613 --> 00:57:02,138
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

678
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:03,649
I wonder why.

679
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:05,309
Come here.

680
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,355
- Right there.
- Here?

681
00:57:13,093 --> 00:57:16,426
I'm gonna ask you
a question, okay?

682
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:18,795
Do you like cops?

683
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:20,800
You're my first.

684
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:25,870
No, I mean all this shit I've been
telling you. Do you believe it?

685
00:57:25,939 --> 00:57:27,531
Why not?

686
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:31,502
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

687
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,207
What's the matter with me?

688
00:57:35,282 --> 00:57:37,375
Everybody knows about cops.

689
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:41,080
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

690
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:44,318
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

691
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:49,829
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

692
00:57:49,897 --> 00:57:53,298
Right in the middle of the kingdom
there was a well.

693
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,358
That's where everybody drank.

694
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:59,065
One night,
this witch came along...

695
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:01,073
and she poisoned the well.

696
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:05,304
And the next day, everybody drank
from it except the king...

697
00:58:05,379 --> 00:58:07,438
and they all went crazy.

698
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:09,812
They got together
in the street and they said...

699
00:58:09,883 --> 00:58:12,852
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."

700
00:58:15,189 --> 00:58:18,420
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well.

701
00:58:18,492 --> 00:58:21,290
And the next day
all the people rejoiced...

702
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:25,457
because their king
had regained his reason.

703
00:58:29,203 --> 00:58:31,137
I think you're trying
to tell me somethin'.

704
00:58:31,205 --> 00:58:33,036
- Me?
- Yeah.

705
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:37,543
Hey, Frank, I want you
to say hello to somebody.

706
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:41,547
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?

707
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,014
Frank Serpico,
say hello to Don Rubello.

708
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:48,179
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?

709
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:53,658
If you don't want to work with this
fucking nut for some reason, man...

710
00:58:53,727 --> 00:58:56,696
I'll buddy up with him,
all right?

711
00:58:56,763 --> 00:58:59,061
And go through all that crap
changing assignments?

712
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:01,226
No. We'll be okay.

713
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:03,132
<i>We're paisans, huh?</i>

714
00:59:06,073 --> 00:59:08,200
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.

715
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:11,039
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?

716
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:14,239
He goes to track down heroin.

717
00:59:14,314 --> 00:59:17,010
Let him loose, goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back...

718
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:19,518
sniffs it out,
brings it to you.

719
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:23,985
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?

720
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:30,989
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...

721
00:59:31,064 --> 00:59:34,124
He's a numbers collector who ain't
been meeting his obligations.

722
00:59:35,602 --> 00:59:39,129
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

723
00:59:42,676 --> 00:59:46,373
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

724
00:59:46,446 --> 00:59:50,507
Straight off.
I collect for the division...

725
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,677
me and two other bagmen.

726
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:55,187
That's what Keough
was sort of hinting at.

727
00:59:57,424 --> 01:00:00,154
Three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

728
01:00:01,828 --> 01:00:03,455
Hey!
Look, there he is.

729
01:00:16,043 --> 01:00:18,409
Son of a bitch!

730
01:00:22,883 --> 01:00:25,716
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

731
01:01:39,793 --> 01:01:41,226
Where's the money?

732
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:51,729
You been jerking me around,
you fuck! Huh?

733
01:01:51,805 --> 01:01:54,069
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!

734
01:01:58,345 --> 01:02:00,176
Three times you never show,
right?

735
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:04,479
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.

736
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:06,485
Don't bust me!

737
01:02:08,355 --> 01:02:11,017
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.

738
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:15,255
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear? Huh?

739
01:02:16,697 --> 01:02:18,756
See you at the Domino,
midnight.

740
01:02:18,832 --> 01:02:22,893
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?

741
01:02:25,939 --> 01:02:27,873
All right, Frank.

742
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:36,514
I keep this place
for socializing.

743
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:40,019
Someday we'll get a couple of
broads, huh? Have a little party.

744
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:44,523
Hey!

745
01:02:46,093 --> 01:02:48,357
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

746
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:55,563
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

747
01:02:56,403 --> 01:02:58,564
Look, Don...

748
01:02:58,638 --> 01:03:03,041
if I was broke, if I had a family...
I don't know.

749
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,044
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

750
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:07,444
So why the fuck stick my neck out?
You know what I mean?

751
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:10,574
It's already out, Frank...
not taking the money.

752
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,811
It's better the other guys
don't know that.

753
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:14,820
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.

754
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,051
I'll hold your share
for you, huh?

755
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:21,060
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

756
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:23,528
Right in here,
right down to the penny, huh?

757
01:03:23,597 --> 01:03:25,656
Hey. Look at that.

758
01:03:25,732 --> 01:03:29,133
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

759
01:03:32,506 --> 01:03:35,441
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna
get a color TV for the games.

760
01:03:35,509 --> 01:03:38,910
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?

761
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:57,922
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.

762
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:08,707
Hello, Frank.
Get in.

763
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:17,250
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

764
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,376
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

765
01:04:20,453 --> 01:04:22,717
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

766
01:04:22,788 --> 01:04:24,813
No, absolutely not.

767
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,824
All right, all right.

768
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:33,323
I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

769
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:37,426
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

770
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:40,233
Then you'll be
his eyes and his ears.

771
01:04:40,306 --> 01:04:42,638
He said he was delighted
that, quote...

772
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:46,075
"A man of integrity
had surfaced," unquote.

773
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:49,814
When do I hear from him?

774
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:53,045
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

775
01:04:55,488 --> 01:04:56,921
Reach out?

776
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:01,720
See, you know, my situation's
pretty fuckin' sticky up there.

777
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:04,024
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...

778
01:05:04,096 --> 01:05:06,724
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.

779
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,357
Patience and faith.

780
01:05:08,434 --> 01:05:11,767
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

781
01:05:11,837 --> 01:05:13,771
he'll get in touch with you.

782
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,202
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.

783
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,852
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.

784
01:05:34,927 --> 01:05:37,521
We got to lay off him
for a couple of months.

785
01:05:37,596 --> 01:05:40,190
And listen, Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

786
01:05:40,266 --> 01:05:43,201
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

787
01:05:43,269 --> 01:05:46,295
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred...

788
01:05:46,372 --> 01:05:48,237
so you're gonna have to work
with a new bagman.

789
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:51,868
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.

790
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:53,536
- How are you?
- Fine.

791
01:05:53,612 --> 01:05:56,638
Listen, you know that operation
down by Hunt's Point, the new one?

792
01:05:56,716 --> 01:05:58,809
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?

793
01:05:58,884 --> 01:06:01,444
You the new bagman,
you prick?

794
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,889
What happened to Rubello, you son
of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!

795
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,892
Wait a minute.

796
01:06:19,505 --> 01:06:22,565
You know, Frank,
sometimes I ask myself...

797
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:24,836
what the fuck am I doing?

798
01:06:26,846 --> 01:06:29,508
You know,
if this ever came out...

799
01:06:29,582 --> 01:06:31,516
Christ, my family.

800
01:06:33,252 --> 01:06:34,514
My daughter.

801
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:38,285
She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

802
01:06:38,357 --> 01:06:39,722
Chorus.

803
01:06:40,793 --> 01:06:42,852
Took a lot of money.

804
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,898
I once tried to pull out.

805
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:49,127
Christ, they were all over me.

806
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:51,260
So you...

807
01:06:51,337 --> 01:06:53,271
just go along.

808
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:59,634
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

809
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:19,893
Shit.
How the money rolls in.

810
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:24,691
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.

811
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:28,003
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.

812
01:07:28,073 --> 01:07:30,667
I'm not on.
I don't take money.

813
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:33,234
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

814
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,840
I don't take money,
and that's the truth.

815
01:07:38,918 --> 01:07:41,887
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.

816
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:48,082
Your nut...
where's it been going?

817
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,684
Ask Rubello.

818
01:07:52,298 --> 01:07:54,425
<i>All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myself then.</i>

819
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,095
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.

820
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:01,833
<i>- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.</i>

821
01:08:01,907 --> 01:08:04,398
No, but, Captain,
now they know I'm not on.

822
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:06,741
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.

823
01:08:12,184 --> 01:08:15,312
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.

824
01:08:16,856 --> 01:08:19,552
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

825
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,957
The top guys have been
cops too long.

826
01:08:23,996 --> 01:08:25,930
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

827
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:27,659
No, not a fucking word.

828
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,471
Would you be willing to go
outside the department?

829
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:39,273
Where could we go?

830
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:42,776
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

831
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:53,452
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man...

832
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:56,256
guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

833
01:08:56,328 --> 01:08:59,024
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

834
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:01,123
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.

835
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,868
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.

836
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,807
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.

837
01:09:14,847 --> 01:09:16,041
<i>Dynamite.</i>

838
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:19,243
Every plainclothesman
in the division...

839
01:09:19,318 --> 01:09:21,650
and one,
maybe two lieutenants?

840
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,747
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.

841
01:09:25,824 --> 01:09:29,021
That is 150...

842
01:09:29,094 --> 01:09:32,154
That is $250,000 a year...

843
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:35,257
but that is just one precinct.

844
01:09:35,334 --> 01:09:37,996
Oh, that is amazing!

845
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:42,633
See, what I feel is needed here
is, like, a real investigation.

846
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:45,836
And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

847
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:48,773
McClain and Delaney...

848
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:51,281
they have done nothing?

849
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,113
Oh, man.
That is amazing.

850
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:59,520
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days...

851
01:09:59,592 --> 01:10:01,184
they're gonna have
a meeting of the pad.

852
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,522
Oh, right.

853
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:05,462
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

854
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:09,797
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors,
but never touching it directly.

855
01:10:09,868 --> 01:10:15,329
And for an on-the-line cop to come
forward like this is beautiful.

856
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:17,637
Really, Frank, I mean...

857
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,577
you have my respect
and my sympathy...

858
01:10:20,646 --> 01:10:22,580
for what you've been
going through, man.

859
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:24,411
Wow.

860
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,520
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.

861
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,320
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.

862
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:52,810
Well?

863
01:10:54,513 --> 01:10:56,606
Tell me what happened,
Paco.

864
01:10:56,682 --> 01:10:58,616
I'd like a drink.

865
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:06,353
That guy is gonna
go to the mayor.

866
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,497
To the mayor!

867
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:18,401
Come here, Alfie. We're all
gonna go to the mayor together.

868
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,404
You know that?

869
01:11:23,976 --> 01:11:26,308
I couldn't be
any more embarrassed.

870
01:11:28,014 --> 01:11:30,073
It's like a personal defeat.

871
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:33,752
However...

872
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,753
there are priorities.

873
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:38,255
What are the priorities,
Jerry?

874
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:40,417
The priorities are...

875
01:11:40,493 --> 01:11:42,927
a long, hot summer ahead...

876
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:45,725
and riots are expected...

877
01:11:46,966 --> 01:11:50,993
and the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

878
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,868
Now, in the fall...

879
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,807
Now, in the fall,
it may be possible...

880
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:58,810
to take another look
at the situation.

881
01:11:58,878 --> 01:12:00,675
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.

882
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:16,495
They're all rotten.

883
01:12:16,562 --> 01:12:18,655
Chickenshit.

884
01:12:18,731 --> 01:12:20,790
The whole fucking
system's corrupt.

885
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:27,864
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.

886
01:12:31,177 --> 01:12:35,443
You know, Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

887
01:12:35,514 --> 01:12:37,448
Let him in.

888
01:12:39,185 --> 01:12:41,119
You let him in.

889
01:12:59,372 --> 01:13:02,535
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

890
01:13:02,608 --> 01:13:05,702
Bullshit! I got me
into this whole thing.

891
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,411
"Wow. Amazing!

892
01:13:09,482 --> 01:13:13,350
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!

893
01:13:13,419 --> 01:13:15,353
Priorities. Priorities."

894
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:18,356
You and your big-deal friends,
your contacts...

895
01:13:18,424 --> 01:13:20,722
your big bullshit names.

896
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:23,557
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton.

897
01:13:23,629 --> 01:13:26,598
The mystery man with the connections,
the hot line to the mayor.

898
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,827
Who the fuck do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

899
01:13:28,901 --> 01:13:31,665
You come looking for help,
whining, mealy-mouthed...

900
01:13:31,737 --> 01:13:33,898
with your humble-pie act...
the saint, the injured innocent.

901
01:13:33,973 --> 01:13:35,907
Who told you the department
or the whole world...

902
01:13:35,975 --> 01:13:38,535
was some kind
of a fucking boy scout camp?

903
01:13:40,313 --> 01:13:44,909
What do you expect, for Christ's
sake, a magician? A big daddy?

904
01:13:44,984 --> 01:13:48,420
White knight snaps his fingers,
the dirty world turns white...

905
01:13:48,487 --> 01:13:50,421
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do.

906
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:52,957
while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?

907
01:13:53,025 --> 01:13:56,188
You gonna blame me 'cause those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

908
01:13:57,263 --> 01:13:59,060
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.

909
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:01,861
Where's your head? It's on
your shoulders. That's what I see.

910
01:14:01,934 --> 01:14:05,199
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

911
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:07,466
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.

912
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,134
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

913
01:14:10,209 --> 01:14:12,700
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

914
01:14:12,778 --> 01:14:14,439
We can talk to Foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

915
01:14:14,513 --> 01:14:17,141
Another guy!
We got another guy here.

916
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:19,650
<i>We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.</i>

917
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:24,549
<i>Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.</i>

918
01:14:24,623 --> 01:14:27,854
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

919
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:29,360
This is safe, Frank.

920
01:14:29,428 --> 01:14:31,259
It's safe? With my ass on the line,
it's safe, right?

921
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:34,959
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!

922
01:14:35,034 --> 01:14:37,093
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!

923
01:14:37,169 --> 01:14:38,727
- Go fuck yourself!
- Fuck you!

924
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:45,510
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

925
01:14:45,578 --> 01:14:49,105
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!

926
01:15:30,022 --> 01:15:32,013
Honey...

927
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:34,184
come to bed.

928
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:45,121
All right. Look, we all know
what this is about, right?

929
01:16:45,197 --> 01:16:49,099
Frank, what the hell was happening
between you and Don Rubello?

930
01:16:52,104 --> 01:16:55,972
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

931
01:16:56,041 --> 01:17:00,842
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share...

932
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:03,473
he'd give it back to me.

933
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:06,109
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.

934
01:17:06,185 --> 01:17:09,916
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.

935
01:17:09,988 --> 01:17:13,719
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

936
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:17,523
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one of you...

937
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:22,329
makes his own collections...
no stops, no bread, okay?

938
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:24,335
- Right.
- You got it.

939
01:17:24,403 --> 01:17:28,533
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

940
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:33,237
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.

941
01:17:33,312 --> 01:17:35,007
You can always give it
to charity.

942
01:17:36,648 --> 01:17:39,617
Look, Frankie, what do you say,
a hundred a month just for expenses?

943
01:17:40,652 --> 01:17:44,247
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

944
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:52,288
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.

945
01:17:52,364 --> 01:17:54,332
You're a schmuck, Frank.

946
01:18:02,341 --> 01:18:04,809
If they would take
all that energy, see...

947
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:06,970
put it into
straight police work...

948
01:18:07,045 --> 01:18:08,444
we'd have the city
cleaned up in a week.

949
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:10,948
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.

950
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:20,623
If I could work alone...
That's the thing, see?

951
01:18:20,692 --> 01:18:23,354
If I could just get... Work alone.
But they don't like that.

952
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:25,522
They don't want that.
They want to suck you in.

953
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:28,395
You go over
the same thing, Paco.

954
01:18:28,467 --> 01:18:32,665
So fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit!

955
01:18:32,738 --> 01:18:35,901
There's gotta be a way
to wipe it out, goddamn it.

956
01:18:35,974 --> 01:18:38,636
Let's get out of here for a while,
huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.

957
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:42,168
Quit handling me! What are you
doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?

958
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:45,739
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?

959
01:18:45,818 --> 01:18:49,652
Either you're exploding, or you're
lying around like a catatonic!

960
01:18:49,721 --> 01:18:53,179
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

961
01:18:53,258 --> 01:18:56,557
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.

962
01:18:56,628 --> 01:19:00,223
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...

963
01:19:00,299 --> 01:19:03,700
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

964
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:05,703
It's tearing me apart!

965
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:09,332
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

966
01:19:09,408 --> 01:19:13,242
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

967
01:19:13,312 --> 01:19:18,716
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!

968
01:19:18,784 --> 01:19:22,618
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?

969
01:19:22,688 --> 01:19:26,681
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

970
01:19:26,758 --> 01:19:29,420
Well, do it.

971
01:19:42,674 --> 01:19:46,201
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?

972
01:19:46,278 --> 01:19:48,212
Try me. Try me.

973
01:19:49,214 --> 01:19:52,240
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.

974
01:19:52,317 --> 01:19:56,014
Mobbed up.
Still interested?

975
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,921
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

976
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:03,553
He's a loan shark,
runs a big numbers operation.

977
01:20:03,629 --> 01:20:06,154
This mother's so cocksure...

978
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:09,496
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

979
01:20:09,568 --> 01:20:11,001
Where's the drop?

980
01:20:58,417 --> 01:20:59,679
Hold it!

981
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:02,413
I'm a police officer.

982
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:03,852
And...

983
01:21:06,224 --> 01:21:09,022
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.

984
01:21:10,462 --> 01:21:13,397
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.

985
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:17,364
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.

986
01:21:17,436 --> 01:21:19,666
What are you doin'?
What's that?

987
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:24,131
Put that away, or you're in more
trouble. Give me your car keys.

988
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:32,109
Where they been
hiding you, kid?

989
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,277
Wouldn't you like to know?

990
01:21:36,555 --> 01:21:39,149
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

991
01:21:39,224 --> 01:21:41,158
I'm gonna search his car.

992
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,041
Where's Corsaro?

993
01:22:06,118 --> 01:22:08,052
Smith took him upstairs.

994
01:22:17,963 --> 01:22:20,454
I swear to God, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

995
01:22:22,968 --> 01:22:25,232
Listen, Rudy, you should
see some of the...

996
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,517
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

997
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:42,716
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

998
01:22:42,787 --> 01:22:46,052
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.

999
01:22:46,124 --> 01:22:48,592
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

1000
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,424
You're fucking right!

1001
01:22:51,496 --> 01:22:54,192
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?

1002
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,894
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!

1003
01:22:56,968 --> 01:22:59,300
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.

1004
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:01,931
Stay the fuck outta this!

1005
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:04,975
You fuck!

1006
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:08,405
What's this?
What's this?

1007
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,414
Get in! Get in!

1008
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:03,261
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

1009
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:20,176
You want to read something?

1010
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:24,519
It's about your pal Corsaro.

1011
01:24:24,589 --> 01:24:27,387
Here, read it.
Read it!

1012
01:24:30,462 --> 01:24:32,987
He did 15 years.
You know what for?

1013
01:24:33,064 --> 01:24:36,192
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.

1014
01:24:47,846 --> 01:24:50,007
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.

1015
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:52,709
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.

1016
01:24:52,784 --> 01:24:55,309
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.

1017
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:58,982
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.

1018
01:24:59,057 --> 01:25:01,992
The commissioner didn't
get in touch with you?

1019
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,995
Not a word. No investigation,
no undercover work, nothing!

1020
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:09,261
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.

1021
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:11,802
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.

1022
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:14,065
What outside agencies?

1023
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:18,371
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here!

1024
01:25:18,443 --> 01:25:23,142
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!

1025
01:25:23,214 --> 01:25:24,647
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!

1026
01:25:24,716 --> 01:25:27,844
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.

1027
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:31,650
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- Stay away from outside agencies!

1028
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:33,691
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?

1029
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:35,988
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

1030
01:25:36,061 --> 01:25:37,961
- I've been waiting for 11/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.

1031
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:41,294
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?

1032
01:25:43,935 --> 01:25:46,403
It's my life, you fuck!

1033
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:51,272
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

1034
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,184
For this precinct,
cases reported...

1035
01:26:01,252 --> 01:26:06,849
Murder... 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...

1036
01:26:09,761 --> 01:26:11,194
Inspector Palmer?

1037
01:26:13,932 --> 01:26:16,901
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1038
01:26:16,968 --> 01:26:19,061
are waiting to see you.

1039
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:24,738
You want to come
to my office?

1040
01:26:30,882 --> 01:26:33,282
Captain McClain called me.

1041
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:35,444
I briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1042
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,988
on your allegations.

1043
01:26:38,056 --> 01:26:42,618
The question is, in all these
months, why didn't you come to us?

1044
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:46,596
Well...

1045
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,699
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

1046
01:26:52,771 --> 01:26:55,205
you told...

1047
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:57,867
I mean,
you told Captain McClain...

1048
01:26:57,942 --> 01:27:00,376
that the division was as clean
as a hound's tooth.

1049
01:27:00,445 --> 01:27:04,176
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico?

1050
01:27:04,249 --> 01:27:06,342
My record's clear.

1051
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:08,544
Inspector Gilbert's just
come from the commissioner's...

1052
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,554
confidential
investigation unit.

1053
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:14,486
Then you must have
heard something. I mean...

1054
01:27:16,861 --> 01:27:18,294
I don't understand.

1055
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:20,991
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

1056
01:27:23,434 --> 01:27:25,868
No, I didn't hear a thing.

1057
01:27:25,937 --> 01:27:29,134
But I understand
your frustration, Frank...

1058
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:31,300
believe me.

1059
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:34,504
I mean, it's sort of like
trying to punch your way...

1060
01:27:34,579 --> 01:27:36,672
out of a paper bag,
right?

1061
01:27:40,018 --> 01:27:42,418
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

1062
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,863
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

1063
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:57,730
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's gonna cooperate or not.

1064
01:27:57,802 --> 01:27:59,736
- Come on.
- We've gotta know...

1065
01:27:59,804 --> 01:28:02,295
if there's any real basis
for an investigation.

1066
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:07,144
Well, I...

1067
01:28:07,212 --> 01:28:09,305
I'll have to think that...

1068
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,871
I'm gonna have to think
about that.

1069
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:15,113
What is there
to think about?

1070
01:28:15,186 --> 01:28:17,882
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself, sir.

1071
01:28:20,024 --> 01:28:22,925
You've got a point there.

1072
01:28:22,994 --> 01:28:26,828
But you would cooperate with
an impartial investigation, right?

1073
01:28:29,701 --> 01:28:34,468
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.

1074
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:39,637
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

1075
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:42,271
That's fair enough.

1076
01:28:42,347 --> 01:28:44,281
We'll be in touch.

1077
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:50,387
Inspector Palmer?

1078
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:52,548
May I see you a minute?

1079
01:28:57,929 --> 01:29:00,022
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house...

1080
01:29:00,098 --> 01:29:02,862
know I was comin' in here
to see these guys?

1081
01:29:02,934 --> 01:29:05,266
You believe from what you now know
that a full-scale investigation...

1082
01:29:05,336 --> 01:29:06,735
is warranted?

1083
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:10,467
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

1084
01:29:14,779 --> 01:29:16,940
But, sir...

1085
01:29:17,015 --> 01:29:19,540
shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

1086
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:24,387
No.
You're all experienced men.

1087
01:29:26,457 --> 01:29:28,857
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

1088
01:29:34,866 --> 01:29:36,299
Commissioner...

1089
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:42,701
Serpico claims that...

1090
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:46,039
McClain talked to you about
this whole thing some time ago.

1091
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,815
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

1092
01:29:54,486 --> 01:29:59,116
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."

1093
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:01,182
We need a location!

1094
01:30:01,259 --> 01:30:04,126
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

1095
01:30:04,196 --> 01:30:07,859
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1096
01:30:07,933 --> 01:30:10,766
You're conducting this
investigation, not me.

1097
01:30:10,836 --> 01:30:12,895
Lieutenant Smith...
Let's get back to him.

1098
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:17,340
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me...

1099
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:21,209
if I didn't want the money that
he would stash it in his attic.

1100
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,379
I'll have him transferred
in the morning.

1101
01:30:23,448 --> 01:30:26,246
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?

1102
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:40,821
I hear you been
vouchering pad money...

1103
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:44,699
over to a confidential
investigation squad.

1104
01:30:44,769 --> 01:30:49,263
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1105
01:30:49,341 --> 01:30:51,275
You won't find anything
on Serpico.

1106
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:56,340
He's clean.

1107
01:30:56,414 --> 01:30:57,847
Right?

1108
01:31:01,052 --> 01:31:02,917
You practicing your frisk?

1109
01:31:06,391 --> 01:31:08,985
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

1110
01:31:12,197 --> 01:31:15,860
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?

1111
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:17,367
Come on, Frank.

1112
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:22,463
Wearing a wire means testifying to
corroborate the tape, right? Right.

1113
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:25,532
I'm not testifying.

1114
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:27,771
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

1115
01:31:27,846 --> 01:31:31,338
Ragland, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

1116
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:41,258
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?

1117
01:31:41,326 --> 01:31:42,759
Yeah, I watch television.

1118
01:31:42,827 --> 01:31:47,230
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1119
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:49,233
It's unique.

1120
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:53,328
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.

1121
01:31:53,405 --> 01:31:56,431
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shitheels...

1122
01:31:56,508 --> 01:31:59,739
with Frank Serpico
as my star witness.

1123
01:31:59,811 --> 01:32:03,372
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

1124
01:32:03,448 --> 01:32:04,881
'cause I'm not testifying.

1125
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:08,044
- Listen...
- Wait just a second, Frank.

1126
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:10,451
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

1127
01:32:10,522 --> 01:32:12,888
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1128
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,721
- Wait a minute...
- if it meant something...

1129
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:17,159
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?

1130
01:32:17,228 --> 01:32:19,958
Bullshit. You're not going after
corruption in the department...

1131
01:32:20,031 --> 01:32:21,760
the division, the Bronx.

1132
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,767
A few flunky cops
thrown to the wolves...

1133
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:26,895
to protect Delaney and those guys
who've known about this for years...

1134
01:32:26,972 --> 01:32:29,839
and won't do a fuckin' thing about
it, that's why I won't testify.

1135
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:08,475
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.

1136
01:33:08,546 --> 01:33:10,138
I'm splitting.

1137
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:12,308
"Splitting." I never read
anything so stupid in my life.

1138
01:33:12,384 --> 01:33:15,717
"I'm leaving. If you want to
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

1139
01:33:15,787 --> 01:33:17,982
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

1140
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:20,024
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout in here.

1141
01:33:20,091 --> 01:33:22,150
I can shout anywhere!

1142
01:33:27,298 --> 01:33:29,232
I won't shout.

1143
01:33:30,869 --> 01:33:32,427
Sit down, sit down.

1144
01:33:45,717 --> 01:33:47,810
It's just gonna go on
and on, Paco.

1145
01:33:47,886 --> 01:33:49,979
It isn't gonna
get any better.

1146
01:33:51,623 --> 01:33:54,387
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

1147
01:34:03,568 --> 01:34:05,695
How could you leave
the man you love...

1148
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:08,864
future father of your kids?

1149
01:34:11,709 --> 01:34:14,337
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1150
01:34:16,014 --> 01:34:19,745
And if I come back,
you won't say it again.

1151
01:34:22,053 --> 01:34:25,545
You want to be free
and unattached...

1152
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:29,081
to go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1153
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,593
My cause.

1154
01:34:35,733 --> 01:34:37,325
I felt so safe with you...

1155
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:40,694
so loving.

1156
01:34:50,381 --> 01:34:51,814
Stay with me, Laurie.

1157
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,054
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.

1158
01:35:08,867 --> 01:35:12,325
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.

1159
01:35:12,403 --> 01:35:14,337
Here.

1160
01:35:14,405 --> 01:35:15,838
Here's $2.00.

1161
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:35,225
What are you doing?

1162
01:35:39,797 --> 01:35:41,264
Do you want to walk away,
or should I?

1163
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:44,534
I'm not gonna walk away.

1164
01:35:46,738 --> 01:35:48,000
It's finished!

1165
01:35:56,014 --> 01:35:59,415
Who do you think you are, trying to
pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

1166
01:35:59,484 --> 01:36:03,250
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.

1167
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:07,621
Look, maybe if you were borough
commander when this thing started...

1168
01:36:07,692 --> 01:36:11,093
run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1169
01:36:11,162 --> 01:36:13,494
But the truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

1170
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:17,899
You're like a quiff who says
she won't, then maybe she will.

1171
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:20,563
I'm like a quiff
who's been fucked over...

1172
01:36:20,638 --> 01:36:24,597
for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McClain, Delaney...

1173
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:27,577
I'm not Kellogg,
McClain or Delaney!

1174
01:36:27,645 --> 01:36:30,478
Frank, it won't be
just flunky cops.

1175
01:36:30,548 --> 01:36:33,244
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...

1176
01:36:33,318 --> 01:36:36,481
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?

1177
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:39,045
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1178
01:36:39,123 --> 01:36:41,887
I'm totally isolated in the
department. I don't have a friend.

1179
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,452
Don't give me that bullshit. I've
been puttin' cops away for 30 years!

1180
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:48,988
My name's an obscenity on every
precinct shithouse wall in the city.

1181
01:36:49,067 --> 01:36:52,901
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up...

1182
01:36:52,971 --> 01:36:54,666
as a Jew in the department in the
days you were supposed to have...

1183
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:57,435
an uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

1184
01:36:57,508 --> 01:36:59,373
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue...

1185
01:36:59,444 --> 01:37:02,004
watching the St. Patrick's Day
parade and I have a coronary...

1186
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,208
and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1187
01:37:05,283 --> 01:37:08,218
Friends. I haven't got a friend
on the force, either, Serpico.

1188
01:37:08,286 --> 01:37:10,652
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.

1189
01:37:10,722 --> 01:37:13,557
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.

1190
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:16,784
<i>Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shticklech.</i>

1191
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,987
I don't understand.

1192
01:37:19,062 --> 01:37:21,030
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

1193
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,197
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

1194
01:37:35,278 --> 01:37:39,146
<i>Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.</i>

1195
01:37:39,215 --> 01:37:42,048
<i>Ready on the firing line.</i>

1196
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,635
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1197
01:38:35,872 --> 01:38:37,965
Depends on
what they ask me.

1198
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:40,532
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money?

1199
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,874
What I don't know,
I don't know.

1200
01:38:42,946 --> 01:38:45,676
But you do know, Frank.

1201
01:38:45,749 --> 01:38:49,742
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
want to see anything happen to you.

1202
01:38:49,819 --> 01:38:54,153
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

1203
01:38:54,224 --> 01:38:57,785
I'm not saying anything's going to
happen. I'm saying it could happen.

1204
01:38:57,861 --> 01:39:00,659
I mean, there's lots of ways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1205
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:02,891
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1206
01:39:02,966 --> 01:39:06,197
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1207
01:39:06,269 --> 01:39:08,362
Or they can send you
in first enough times...

1208
01:39:08,438 --> 01:39:10,633
until finally one day you're gonna
walk in the wrong door.

1209
01:39:14,778 --> 01:39:17,144
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!

1210
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:23,044
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

1211
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,384
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.

1212
01:39:26,456 --> 01:39:29,118
Officer Serpico came
to the 7th Division...

1213
01:39:29,192 --> 01:39:31,126
more than a year
and a half ago.

1214
01:39:31,194 --> 01:39:34,561
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place.

1215
01:39:34,631 --> 01:39:37,293
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico...

1216
01:39:37,367 --> 01:39:41,428
report these criminal activities
when he first encountered them?

1217
01:39:41,504 --> 01:39:44,667
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...

1218
01:39:44,741 --> 01:39:49,474
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

1219
01:39:49,546 --> 01:39:51,776
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.

1220
01:39:51,848 --> 01:39:55,443
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

1221
01:39:55,518 --> 01:39:57,816
or guilty of
any infraction of the law.

1222
01:39:57,887 --> 01:39:59,821
Quite the contrary.

1223
01:39:59,889 --> 01:40:03,416
The District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1224
01:40:03,493 --> 01:40:06,929
Very well. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1225
01:40:06,996 --> 01:40:09,988
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1226
01:40:11,568 --> 01:40:14,560
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1227
01:40:14,637 --> 01:40:17,435
Frank, this was a grand jury
about police officers...

1228
01:40:17,507 --> 01:40:20,169
actively engaged in corruption.

1229
01:40:20,243 --> 01:40:22,905
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1230
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:26,915
That's crap and you know it, because
even a dumb cop like me knows...

1231
01:40:26,983 --> 01:40:30,578
a prosecutor can take a grand jury
anywhere it wants to take it.

1232
01:40:30,653 --> 01:40:33,349
Now, you never led me anywhere
near the real problems...

1233
01:40:33,423 --> 01:40:36,688
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass...

1234
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,627
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1235
01:40:39,696 --> 01:40:42,290
Now, a few flunky cops
in the Bronx. That's it.

1236
01:40:42,365 --> 01:40:45,061
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?

1237
01:40:45,135 --> 01:40:47,035
While you're at it,
why don't you mention Kansas City?

1238
01:40:47,103 --> 01:40:49,503
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.

1239
01:40:49,572 --> 01:40:52,006
All right! Look, Frank.

1240
01:40:52,876 --> 01:40:55,845
You got guts, integrity.

1241
01:40:55,912 --> 01:40:58,904
There's going to be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

1242
01:41:01,584 --> 01:41:05,076
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.

1243
01:41:05,155 --> 01:41:06,747
Maybe this is
what it's all about.

1244
01:41:06,823 --> 01:41:08,688
Maybe I should take my
gold shield and forget it.

1245
01:41:08,758 --> 01:41:11,056
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

1246
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:17,322
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?

1247
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:20,733
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?

1248
01:41:32,682 --> 01:41:35,446
That takes a 14-shot clip.

1249
01:41:35,518 --> 01:41:37,543
You expecting an army?

1250
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,554
No, just a division.

1251
01:41:41,491 --> 01:41:46,019
Tauber, did you know I've had
reports about Serpico being a fag?

1252
01:41:46,095 --> 01:41:48,791
He used to hang out
in the BCI washroom.

1253
01:41:48,865 --> 01:41:52,062
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

1254
01:41:52,135 --> 01:41:56,231
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield
for Serpico at this time...

1255
01:41:56,306 --> 01:41:57,933
would convince
a lot of people...

1256
01:41:58,007 --> 01:41:59,531
Not while I'm commissioner.

1257
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:20,194
Commander's office?

1258
01:42:22,665 --> 01:42:24,599
It's down that corridor.

1259
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:30,334
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

1260
01:42:30,406 --> 01:42:33,273
That you spilled your
guts to the grand jury.

1261
01:42:34,277 --> 01:42:36,245
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1262
01:42:38,414 --> 01:42:40,109
It isn't so.

1263
01:42:41,184 --> 01:42:43,277
We know how to handle
guys like you.

1264
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,488
I ought to cut
your tongue out.

1265
01:42:52,328 --> 01:42:54,023
Don't move.

1266
01:43:16,119 --> 01:43:18,383
Officer Serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

1267
01:43:26,663 --> 01:43:29,632
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1268
01:43:31,434 --> 01:43:33,664
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1269
01:43:35,405 --> 01:43:36,838
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1270
01:43:40,443 --> 01:43:44,174
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1271
01:43:47,016 --> 01:43:50,577
All right. You can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank...

1272
01:43:50,653 --> 01:43:52,883
I'll work with you.

1273
01:43:52,956 --> 01:43:54,890
Is that all right?

1274
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:07,592
How do we get past
the lookouts?

1275
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,399
How many you got?
One.

1276
01:44:11,941 --> 01:44:13,143
There's two.

1277
01:44:13,143 --> 01:44:14,508
There's two.

1278
01:44:14,577 --> 01:44:17,375
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.

1279
01:44:17,447 --> 01:44:19,642
It's four buildings away. We could
try to get down the fire escape.

1280
01:44:19,716 --> 01:44:21,809
Get in behind him.
What do you think?

1281
01:44:23,419 --> 01:44:25,751
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1282
01:45:08,798 --> 01:45:10,891
What do you think?
Want to try it?

1283
01:45:29,385 --> 01:45:31,615
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?

1284
01:45:31,688 --> 01:45:33,622
Yeah. I feel just
like a cop again.

1285
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:35,954
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1286
01:46:04,387 --> 01:46:05,945
Close up!

1287
01:46:08,791 --> 01:46:10,816
Wait, Frank!

1288
01:46:10,893 --> 01:46:12,326
Come on!

1289
01:46:21,771 --> 01:46:23,204
I ain't got nothing!

1290
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,342
Beat it, fuck face!

1291
01:46:28,544 --> 01:46:31,980
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.

1292
01:46:35,885 --> 01:46:38,149
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?

1293
01:46:38,221 --> 01:46:40,052
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?

1294
01:46:40,123 --> 01:46:42,751
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!

1295
01:46:42,825 --> 01:46:46,488
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.

1296
01:46:46,562 --> 01:46:49,224
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.

1297
01:46:49,299 --> 01:46:52,427
No, goddamn it! I just paid
the borough this morning!

1298
01:46:55,004 --> 01:46:56,699
What the hell kind of
shakedown is this?

1299
01:46:56,773 --> 01:46:58,866
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1300
01:47:00,543 --> 01:47:03,011
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...

1301
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:05,172
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1302
01:47:05,248 --> 01:47:08,411
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

1303
01:47:09,452 --> 01:47:14,048
We followed up,
and there's no doubt about it.

1304
01:47:14,123 --> 01:47:17,524
The pad here in Manhattan
is bigger...

1305
01:47:17,593 --> 01:47:22,326
and it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1306
01:47:22,398 --> 01:47:25,424
The pickups here are made...
You want to get this...

1307
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:28,732
The pickups are made by...

1308
01:47:28,805 --> 01:47:31,672
retired policemen.

1309
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:35,233
That way, no plainclothesmen
are directly involved.

1310
01:47:35,311 --> 01:47:39,543
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1311
01:47:41,384 --> 01:47:45,787
If you need investigative help
and you don't trust your own men...

1312
01:47:45,855 --> 01:47:48,881
why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

1313
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:58,758
With all due respect,
sir...

1314
01:48:00,803 --> 01:48:03,704
backing us up is the only hope
the police department has got.

1315
01:48:03,773 --> 01:48:07,436
Good cops would come forward if they
thought there was encouragement...

1316
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:09,842
in the department to do so, and if
they thought it would do any good.

1317
01:48:09,912 --> 01:48:11,846
If there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

1318
01:48:11,914 --> 01:48:15,475
I've done a lot more than most
people to defend and preserve...

1319
01:48:15,551 --> 01:48:18,987
the image of this department
and protect Commissioner Delaney...

1320
01:48:19,055 --> 01:48:22,957
against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

1321
01:48:24,861 --> 01:48:26,795
That's it, huh?

1322
01:48:26,863 --> 01:48:30,526
I mean, that's what's
really important, isn't it?

1323
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,693
That's what
you want to know...

1324
01:48:32,769 --> 01:48:36,034
what outside agencies
I've been to, right?

1325
01:48:37,573 --> 01:48:39,336
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, prick.</i>

1326
01:48:39,409 --> 01:48:41,536
- Who is this?
- Frank.

1327
01:48:42,412 --> 01:48:45,381
<i>- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.</i>

1328
01:48:46,349 --> 01:48:50,445
It's a goddamn
serious step, Frank.

1329
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,114
I don't know if
the timing is right.

1330
01:48:55,825 --> 01:48:58,623
Look, I want it to get on
the record, that's all...

1331
01:48:58,694 --> 01:49:01,128
in case something
should happen to me.

1332
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:06,760
I want it on the record.

1333
01:49:09,772 --> 01:49:11,205
I don't know if we
carry enough weight.

1334
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:14,968
<i>I don't know if the New York Times
will go that far out on a limb...</i>

1335
01:49:15,044 --> 01:49:17,308
on the say-so
of two flunky cops.

1336
01:49:21,617 --> 01:49:24,347
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us?

1337
01:49:25,988 --> 01:49:29,389
You know, I got 20 years
on the force.

1338
01:49:29,459 --> 01:49:33,793
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.

1339
01:49:33,863 --> 01:49:37,094
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.

1340
01:49:37,166 --> 01:49:39,191
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!

1341
01:49:39,268 --> 01:49:41,202
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.

1342
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:43,329
You said we could go
to bed late!

1343
01:49:45,007 --> 01:49:47,908
This is against department
regulations, you both know that.

1344
01:49:47,977 --> 01:49:52,277
If they want to throw the book
at me, they can do it.

1345
01:49:52,348 --> 01:49:54,441
If I left the force...

1346
01:49:55,818 --> 01:49:57,911
I don't know
what I could do.

1347
01:50:03,726 --> 01:50:07,662
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.

1348
01:50:11,634 --> 01:50:14,865
<i>Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.</i>

1349
01:50:14,937 --> 01:50:16,871
Here you go, here you go,
here you go.

1350
01:50:16,939 --> 01:50:18,372
<i>Newsweek, please.</i>

1351
01:50:20,776 --> 01:50:22,710
Holy sh... Jeez!

1352
01:50:25,047 --> 01:50:26,674
Aw, Christ!

1353
01:50:26,749 --> 01:50:29,616
You could almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

1354
01:50:29,685 --> 01:50:31,949
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

1355
01:50:32,021 --> 01:50:34,990
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

1356
01:50:35,057 --> 01:50:39,687
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,
the mayor will appoint a commission.

1357
01:50:39,762 --> 01:50:42,959
"Mayor Lindsay announced the
formation of a five-man committee...

1358
01:50:43,032 --> 01:50:45,865
to review the city procedures for
investigating police corruption."

1359
01:50:45,935 --> 01:50:48,995
How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

1360
01:50:49,071 --> 01:50:50,504
Unbelievable!

1361
01:50:54,777 --> 01:50:59,180
<i>The Times' report smells
of the familiar smear tactics...</i>

1362
01:50:59,248 --> 01:51:01,273
of McCarthyism.

1363
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:05,810
<i>- I have issued a statement...
- We here at city hall...</i>

1364
01:51:05,888 --> 01:51:08,584
The mayor appointed a special
investigation commission...

1365
01:51:08,658 --> 01:51:10,592
<i>to be headed
by Whitman Knapp.</i>

1366
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,093
Yeah, come.

1367
01:51:17,166 --> 01:51:22,604
It's your reward. It's a transfer
to narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1368
01:51:22,672 --> 01:51:25,835
You're still in clothes. You get
a tin shield, not a gold one.

1369
01:51:30,613 --> 01:51:32,547
I miss you already, Frank.

1370
01:51:37,587 --> 01:51:40,784
Look, Frank...

1371
01:51:43,526 --> 01:51:46,188
it's narcotics.

1372
01:51:46,262 --> 01:51:48,787
You be careful.

1373
01:51:48,864 --> 01:51:52,268
It's very easy to get hurt...

1374
01:51:53,802 --> 01:51:55,235
and to...

1375
01:51:56,839 --> 01:51:58,534
to be set up.

1376
01:52:40,582 --> 01:52:42,607
Get in.

1377
01:52:59,568 --> 01:53:01,661
You're not wired,
are you?

1378
01:53:02,771 --> 01:53:04,636
Okay, you cocksucker.

1379
01:53:06,141 --> 01:53:09,167
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit...

1380
01:53:09,244 --> 01:53:12,645
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

1381
01:53:14,283 --> 01:53:17,047
Last week,
one dope dealer...

1382
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:20,179
sent out these guys
making pickups.

1383
01:53:20,255 --> 01:53:22,746
40,000 each.

1384
01:53:22,825 --> 01:53:26,124
We let 'em collect it all,
and then hit 'em.

1385
01:53:26,195 --> 01:53:29,790
120,000 split four ways.

1386
01:53:30,866 --> 01:53:33,266
That's serious money.

1387
01:53:33,335 --> 01:53:36,896
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

1388
01:53:38,674 --> 01:53:41,074
- I got the message.
- Good.

1389
01:53:41,877 --> 01:53:43,310
Now get the fuck out.

1390
01:53:49,985 --> 01:53:51,418
The guy's name is Limbo.

1391
01:53:51,487 --> 01:53:53,819
He just uses this place,
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1392
01:53:53,889 --> 01:53:56,449
He's a pusher... heroin.

1393
01:53:56,525 --> 01:53:58,789
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.

1394
01:53:58,861 --> 01:54:02,524
You keep in sight out front. When
you spot somebody who's dirty...

1395
01:54:02,598 --> 01:54:04,691
take off your glasses
and wipe 'em.

1396
01:54:04,767 --> 01:54:07,292
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.

1397
01:55:15,604 --> 01:55:18,072
We stay around here very long,
we're gonna get spotted.

1398
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:21,735
Well, Frank, why don't you
go up there and check it out?

1399
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:25,109
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1400
01:55:25,181 --> 01:55:27,911
I'll take you shopping.

1401
01:57:12,588 --> 01:57:14,021
Limbo.

1402
01:57:47,056 --> 01:57:48,785
Police. Freeze!

1403
01:57:48,858 --> 01:57:50,883
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.

1404
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,192
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.

1405
01:57:55,264 --> 01:57:58,165
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!

1406
01:57:58,234 --> 01:58:00,293
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.

1407
01:58:01,337 --> 01:58:03,362
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo. Julio!

1408
01:58:03,439 --> 01:58:05,703
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.

1409
01:59:09,772 --> 01:59:11,637
Police officer!

1410
01:59:21,784 --> 01:59:23,752
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

1411
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,881
Go down the fire escape!

1412
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:46,702
Police! Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1413
02:00:20,976 --> 02:00:24,139
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.

1414
02:00:24,213 --> 02:00:26,147
Okay. Go ahead.

1415
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:34,412
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.

1416
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:36,924
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.

1417
02:01:05,054 --> 02:01:06,988
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...

1418
02:01:07,056 --> 02:01:11,152
the news is better
than we expected.

1419
02:01:11,227 --> 02:01:15,527
Thank God the bullet
was a small caliber.

1420
02:01:15,598 --> 02:01:17,133
It didn't enter the brain...

1421
02:01:18,801 --> 02:01:20,894
or strike the spinal cord.

1422
02:01:22,371 --> 02:01:24,896
He's on the critical list...

1423
02:01:24,974 --> 02:01:28,171
but his condition
seems to be stable.

1424
02:01:29,512 --> 02:01:31,343
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

1425
02:02:05,314 --> 02:02:08,477
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

1426
02:02:08,551 --> 02:02:10,018
What?

1427
02:02:10,085 --> 02:02:13,452
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.

1428
02:02:23,332 --> 02:02:25,926
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1429
02:02:32,675 --> 02:02:34,609
How are you?

1430
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:40,214
You wanna read my fan mail?

1431
02:02:40,282 --> 02:02:42,216
Sure.

1432
02:02:42,284 --> 02:02:44,377
You're a big shot now, huh?

1433
02:03:12,615 --> 02:03:16,210
I want you to get those
fucking cops away from my door.

1434
02:03:27,029 --> 02:03:30,590
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1435
02:03:30,666 --> 02:03:32,190
Naturally.

1436
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:38,472
Heinemann and Julio
are cleared.

1437
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,100
The three of you are up for
exceptional merit awards.

1438
02:03:42,645 --> 02:03:44,579
That's very funny.

1439
02:03:49,885 --> 02:03:52,353
That's very funny.

1440
02:03:53,589 --> 02:03:55,022
Francesco, you love me?

1441
02:03:57,326 --> 02:03:59,760
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.

1442
02:04:04,233 --> 02:04:06,326
Your gold shield's
come through.

1443
02:04:35,064 --> 02:04:36,998
What's this for?

1444
02:04:40,602 --> 02:04:43,298
For being an honest cop?

1445
02:04:45,708 --> 02:04:48,871
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1446
02:04:53,282 --> 02:04:56,251
You tell them
they can shove it.

1447
02:05:01,790 --> 02:05:03,655
I don't want it.

1448
02:05:42,598 --> 02:05:44,031
Oh, well.

1449
02:05:49,238 --> 02:05:51,798
Well, Frank,
the facts are these.

1450
02:05:51,874 --> 02:05:55,503
You'll have to stay on leave
of absence for a few months.

1451
02:05:55,577 --> 02:05:59,445
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1452
02:05:59,515 --> 02:06:02,143
Two bullet fragments are still
lodged there in the bony portion.

1453
02:06:02,217 --> 02:06:03,844
One is very close to
the carotid artery...

1454
02:06:03,919 --> 02:06:06,683
<i>and you'll have to be checked
from time to time.</i>

1455
02:06:06,755 --> 02:06:09,155
<i>Your left side will
feel stiff occasionally.</i>

1456
02:06:10,325 --> 02:06:13,488
<i>Once in a great while you may
experience some dizziness.</i>

1457
02:06:13,562 --> 02:06:15,689
<i>But in general,
you'll be okay.</i>

1458
02:06:34,149 --> 02:06:36,447
Through my appearance
here today...

1459
02:06:36,518 --> 02:06:39,544
I hope that police officers in
the future will not experience...

1460
02:06:39,621 --> 02:06:43,216
the same frustration and anxiety
that I was subjected to...

1461
02:06:43,292 --> 02:06:46,591
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors...

1462
02:06:46,662 --> 02:06:49,597
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1463
02:06:49,665 --> 02:06:54,432
I was made to feel that I had
burdened them with an unwanted task.

1464
02:06:54,503 --> 02:06:58,064
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

1465
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:00,074
in which an honest police officer
can act...

1466
02:07:00,142 --> 02:07:04,806
without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

1467
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:08,475
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated...

1468
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:10,677
at higher levels
in the department.

1469
02:07:10,752 --> 02:07:14,085
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

1470
02:07:14,156 --> 02:07:18,286
is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

1471
02:07:19,094 --> 02:07:20,527
In order to ensure this...

1472
02:07:20,596 --> 02:07:23,588
an independent,
permanent investigative body...

1473
02:07:23,665 --> 02:07:27,465
dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
