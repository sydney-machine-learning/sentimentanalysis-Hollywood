1
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:37,453
Let's see what you got.

2
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:40,533
I need more runners. I can't
write the business fast enough.

3
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,953
You gotta see Granger.

4
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:53,258
8720. Yeah. Yeah.
Hold it a minute.

5
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:57,303
Beat it, Mottola! Mr. Granger?
Chicago's on the line.

6
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,013
Yeah.

7
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:04,183
This is Combs. Why haven't we
heard from you? Everybody else is in.

8
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,853
We had problems
with the law this morning.

9
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,443
The mayor promised
to get tough on the rackets...

10
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,233
so he shut everybody down for a
couple of hours to make it look good.

11
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:14,153
Nothing serious. It just
put us a little behind.

12
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:16,788
- Been making your payoffs?
- Hell, yes!

13
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,783
He does this every year. There's
nothing to worry about.

14
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:23,203
Finish your count and get it up here.
I don't want to be here all night.

15
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:25,373
The man's going to be real happy.

16
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,993
We cleared over ten grand this week.

17
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,543
We cleared 22 here.

18
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,753
What the hell! You got the
whole Chicago South Side.

19
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:35,153
How do you expect my eight
lousy spots to compete with that?

20
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:38,513
They did 14 grand in Evanston,
16.5 in Gary, and 20 in Cicero.

21
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:41,148
Looks like you're bringing
up the rear.

22
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:44,143
I just got the count. I'll
put the take on the 4:15.

23
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,313
We'll be waiting.

24
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,683
Mottola!

25
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,193
Take this up to Chicago on the 4:15.

26
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:59,533
They'll be waiting for
it at the clearinghouse.

27
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,373
And don't stop for any
entertainment. Get a cab over on 7th.

28
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,993
Cut it out!

29
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,993
8720.

30
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:25,093
Hey, you there! Stop! Hey,
you! Stop that man!

31
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:29,103
Stop him! He's got my
wallet! Stop him! Stop that man!

32
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,433
He's got all of my money!

33
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,563
Stop him! Stop him!

34
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,443
Goddamn nigger-lover!

35
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,823
I'm gonna get you someday
for this! Sucker egg!

36
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:47,033
Don't let him get away! He's got
my wallet! He's got all my money!

37
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:50,043
- My wallet! He's got my wallet!
- We got it!

38
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,213
What happened? Did he
get you with the knife?

39
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,213
- You need a doctor. I'll call a cop.
- No, no! No cops!

40
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,963
You wanted by the law or something?

41
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:04,183
No, it's okay.

42
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:07,603
Are you nuts, carrying a wad like
that in a neighborhood like this?

43
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:11,813
Thanks. I'm obliged to
you. I gotta get going.

44
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,313
You ain't going nowhere on this leg.

45
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:18,313
I gotta. Gotta run some
slots in West Bend for a mob here.

46
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:20,448
I got a little
behind in the payoffs.

47
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,533
They think I've been
holding out on 'em.

48
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,653
They gave me 'til 4:00 to
come up with the cash.

49
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:27,573
If they don't get it, I'm dead.

50
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,743
It don't look good,
Gramps. It's almost 4:00 now.

51
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:33,663
I'll give you and your friend a
hundred bucks to deliver it for me.

52
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:38,923
I don't know. That mug that hit
you is mad enough at me already.

53
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,633
What if he's around the
corner, waiting with some friends?

54
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:44,735
He won't know you're carrying
it. You've gotta help me.

55
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,803
I'm sorry, pal. I'm gonna maybe
help you get to a doctor...

56
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:50,053
but I ain't about to
walk into no knife for you.

57
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:52,603
How about you? All you gotta
do is put it in the door slot.

58
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,603
I'll give you the whole 100.

59
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:56,943
What makes you think you can
trust him? He didn't do shit.

60
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,353
Butt out!

61
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,863
I gave him back the
wallet. How far is this place?

62
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:05,323
1811 Mason. Put it in box
3- C. You won't have no trouble.

63
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:09,128
There's $5,000 there...

64
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,628
and here's a hundred bucks for you.

65
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:16,713
Okay, I'll make your drop for you.
And don't worry, you can trust me.

66
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,638
Hey. Hey!

67
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,423
If those goons search you, you ain't
gonna get far carrying it there.

68
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,423
- What'll we do?
- You got a bag or something?

69
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,433
- How about a handkerchief?
- Here's a handkerchief!

70
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,103
Give it to me. Give me the money.

71
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:34,433
Just hurry, will you?

72
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:38,103
You got any more? Better give it
all to me if you want to keep it.

73
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:39,988
They think I've been holding out.

74
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,113
My wife got sick, and
I had to pay the bill.

75
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,243
Stuff it down your pants
here, like that. Got it?

76
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,073
Hurry, will ya?

77
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:50,453
Ain't a tough guy in the
world that's gonna frisk you there.

78
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,873
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

79
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,633
Where to?

80
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:10,223
- Which way is Mason?
- Twenty blocks south.

81
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,263
- Go north, Joliet Station, fast!
- Right.

82
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,483
What's so funny?

83
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,103
I just made the
world's easiest five grand!

84
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:36,493
- Come on, Luther! Come on!
- Hold on, man! Okay!

85
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:39,503
Hustle!

86
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:44,093
In here!

87
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:48,888
Man, was that beautiful!

88
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,763
I thought for sure he was on to us.

89
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,763
No, you had him all
the way. All the way!

90
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:02,568
Wai...
Luther.

91
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,908
Good God! We're millionaires.

92
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,443
- Did you know he was that loaded?
- Hell, no!

93
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:08,498
I just cut into him.

94
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,453
I would've settled for
pawning one of them shoes.

95
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:14,073
Oh, God!

96
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,373
Do
you...

97
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:20,963
Come on. Let's get out of
here. We'll split it up tonight.

98
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,373
Heya, Marge!

99
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,883
- Hi, kid.
- Hi, Hooker. She's on stage.

100
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,103
Hi, Hooker. Gettin'
married or something?

101
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,773
Get used to it, Leonard. I'm going
to look this good from now on.

102
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,233
- Whaddaya say, Ed?
- Hi, Hooker.

103
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,213
I wanna
talk...

104
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:54,673
Hey, Hooker, you
gettin' married or somethin'?

105
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,933
For Christ's sake,
Ed, did you hear that?

106
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,523
Harry drops four beats in the
middle of my goddamn routine!

107
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,443
- How long do I gotta
put up with that?

108
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,868
Crystal! Leonard, you're on.

109
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:11,903
You wanna get outta here
tonight? I come into some dough.

110
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:15,443
I can't. I got a
10:00. I need the five bucks.

111
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:17,913
I'll spend 50 on you.

112
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:20,703
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:22,953
Okay.

114
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:25,253
.. opens up his pants, the
duck sticks his head out.

115
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:28,258
One lady says to the
other, "See what I see?"

116
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,293
She says, "So what? You've
seen one, you've seen 'em all."

117
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,513
She says, "Yes, but this
one's eating my popcorn."

118
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:41,353
You see that guy
Harry, he can't keep time.

119
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:44,523
Supposing there's some
Hollywood movie agent out there.

120
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:47,183
All those years of
training right down the drain.

121
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,563
Ain't seen you in
months. Thought you took a fall.

122
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,863
Just a little hard
times. Everything's jake now.

123
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,903
How about a ten spot on the line?

124
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:56,943
There's a lot of action
there on 28th Street. Pay you 35...

125
00:10:57,953 --> 00:10:59,823
Three grand on the red.

126
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:02,073
- $3,000?
- Are you nuts?

127
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,248
No, I feel lucky.

128
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:06,293
Hooker, I can't accept
that. It's too big a bet.

129
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,913
- There's a house limit.
- Take it.

130
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,043
- But Hooker
here... - Take it!

131
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,933
Twenty-two, black.

132
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:25,683
Tough luck, kid.

133
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,683
Lucky for me it came up black.

134
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,443
A fella could get in trouble
here, losin' a bet like that.

135
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,773
Listen, Jimmy, can't
we do it again, huh?

136
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:41,743
Seven!

137
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:46,583
Don't worry about it. There's
always more where that came from.

138
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,293
Oh, don't worry about it, he
says. Three thousand dollars!

139
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,968
Thanks, Hooker.

140
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,173
Comes in here with $50 he's
going to spend on me!

141
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,633
- Thanks for the evening, Hooker.
- It's not over yet.

142
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:02,223
Next time you wanna spend
$50 on me, mail it.

143
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,813
Listen,
will ya...

144
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:03,073
They found Mottola, drunk in a dive
in Joliet. He never got on the train.

145
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:06,203
I don't wanna hear about his day,
Greer. What happened to the money?

146
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,913
He lost it to a couple of con
artists on his way out of the spot.

147
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:12,913
- How much?
- Eleven thousand.

148
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,068
Okay, I better get on
the phone to New York...

149
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:22,633
see what the big
mick wants to do about it.

150
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,133
I have a pretty good idea, though.

151
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:13,103
- Doyle, can I talk to you?
- I'm busy, Floyd.

152
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,693
It's important. We had a
little trouble in Chicago today.

153
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:20,278
One of our runners got
hit for 11 grand.

154
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:23,483
What makes you think he
just didn't pocket it?

155
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:27,953
We checked his story with a tipster.
He was cleaned by two grifters.

156
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,823
They working for anybody?

157
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:33,913
I don't know. Could be. We're
running that down now.

158
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,673
Have some local people take
care of them. Nothing fancy.

159
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:40,673
We've got to
discourage this kind of thing.

160
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,843
You follow?

161
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:04,903
Johnny Hooker!

162
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,573
- If you ain't a
sharper in them linens!

163
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:08,493
Evenin', Louise.

164
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,913
Hey, Ma!

165
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,873
If I didn't know you better,
I'd swear you had some class.

166
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,913
Johnny, Luther said you
was something to see today!

167
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,003
I don't know, Alva.

168
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,918
I gotta get faster
tyin' that bundle.

169
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,793
I still give 'em too
much time to think.

170
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:27,303
Bushwah! I used to make that switch
with slower hands than you got.

171
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,223
'Course, the Up and Down
Broadway was my best game.

172
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,358
Me and Luther didn't make much
on it, but it wasn't so touchy.

173
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:38,353
Them marks can beat you up bad when
they catch you makin' that switch.

174
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,393
Come on, Leroy. We'll
be late for church.

175
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,193
Ma, they were closin'
in on Machine Gun Kelly!

176
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,023
Who you rootin' for anyhow?

177
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:46,903
- Hey, Hooker!
- Can't help you, Leroy.

178
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,823
- You can't beat the house.
- Nuts!

179
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,953
Since when do you
go to church at night?

180
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,123
Since they started late bingo.

181
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:54,458
I'm gonna ask the Lord for some of

182
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,123
that cash while He's
still payin' off.

183
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,043
Luther, look in on the baby
from time to time, will you?

184
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,923
- You too, Louise? - Child, yeah,
got to go pray. See ya.

185
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,218
Hey, Erie.

186
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:07,673
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme!
- There's your cut.

187
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:10,973
Guy turned out to be an oil well.

188
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:11,938
Which way'd he go?

189
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,898
- Due north. He was
gonna take it all.

190
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:17,603
Ah, the bastard. He can
blow his nose all the way.

191
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,063
There you go, Luther. Six G's.

192
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:30,153
- You're late. Where you been?
- I had a couple of appointments.

193
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:34,703
How much did you lose?

194
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:40,753
All of it.

195
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,423
In one goddamn night?

196
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:45,713
What are you spraying
money around like that for?

197
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:47,098
You could've been nailed!

198
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,263
- I checked. There
were no dicks there.

199
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,618
But you're a con man, and
you blew it like a pimp!

200
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,933
- Didn't teach you to be no pimp.
- What's eatin' you?

201
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:58,223
- I've blown money before.
- No class grifter would've done it.

202
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:03,063
- You think my play is bad?
- I think you're the best.

203
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,233
I wouldn't be getting
out, otherwise.

204
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:12,613
What the hell are you talkin' about?

205
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:14,953
I'm getting too old for this racket.

206
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,203
You hang on too long and you
start embarrassing yourself.

207
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,793
We just took off on the
biggest score we've ever had.

208
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,623
It's nothing compared to what
you could be making on the big con.

209
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,873
But you played the big con.

210
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:28,963
You told me yourself it was some dumb
game for mama's boys and flakes.

211
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:34,053
Hell, I never played no big con.

212
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:37,143
I hung around and
picked up a few things.

213
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:41,563
Ain't no rich boys gonna trust a
hungry nigger enough to be conned.

214
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,893
But I'll tell you...

215
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:47,233
I've been looking for this
one all my life, Johnny.

216
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:50,863
Now I have a chance to
step out when I'm ahead.

217
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,783
Come on! What would
you do with yourself?

218
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,203
I have a brother in
K. C., runs a freight outlet.

219
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:59,998
I can go halfsies with him.

220
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:03,703
It ain't too
exciting, but it's mostly legal.

221
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,963
I got an old friend in
Chicago named Henry Gondorff.

222
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:14,303
I want you to look him up. There
ain't a better inside man alive.

223
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,183
- He'll teach you all you gotta know.
- To hell with that.

224
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,683
I want to work with you, Luther.

225
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:23,603
I'm out, Johnny.

226
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:32,783
Yeah, sure. If that's
the way you want it.

227
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,613
That's the way I want it.

228
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:42,583
How do you like that
Coleman? After five years.

229
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:47,088
- He knew he was holding you back.
- Yeah, but we were partners.

230
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:50,133
If it weren't for Luther, I'd still
be hustling pinball at Gianelli's.

231
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:52,598
I don't need more than what I got.

232
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,093
You ain't gonna have anything if you
don't lay off the games of chance.

233
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,268
There's a depression on.

234
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,098
- Yeah, there's
always a depression on.

235
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,683
If you saved a little, you
wouldn't have to grift so much.

236
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,223
- I like griftin'.
- You could buy yourself some things.

237
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,183
- What?
- New clothes, a car.

238
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:07,103
I got clothes, and I
don't know how to drive.

239
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,193
What else do you got to sell?

240
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:14,443
Hey, Hooker! Come
on, you son of a...

241
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,163
Hi there, Snyder.

242
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:22,993
What's the matter? Things a little
slow down at the bunco department?

243
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,583
Somebody lose the dominoes?

244
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,663
You scored blood money
today, and you need a friend.

245
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,213
Go find yourself a
shoplifter to roll.

246
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:38,093
You got the wrong guy, pal. I've
been home with the flu all day.

247
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,973
- Stake out my toilet if you want.
- Keep talkin'!

248
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:57,958
I'll tell you what
you did, smart boy.

249
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:01,993
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

250
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:04,490
You and Coleman
played the switch for

251
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:06,953
him and blew him
off to a cab on 49th.

252
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:09,503
If he hadn't been a
numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan...

253
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,873
it would've been perfect.

254
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:14,383
You're crazy.

255
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:18,763
I ain't stupid enough to
play for no racket's money.

256
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:23,183
Not intentionally, maybe. That
don't cut no ice with Lonnegan.

257
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,933
- He'll swat you like
a fly. - Yeah, well...

258
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,698
I'll square it with the fixer.

259
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:33,818
Nobody can buy you a
prayer if I put the finger on you.

260
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:37,903
Now, I figure your end of the
score was at least three G's.

261
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:41,403
- I want two, no matter what it was.
- My take was only one.

262
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:45,743
Then you're gonna have to come
up with another grand somewhere.

263
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:58,093
All right.

264
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,853
You're a smart egg, Hooker.

265
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:15,863
No sense getting
dead over two grand.

266
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:27,073
Relax, Erie. I'll bill ya.

267
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,503
- I thought you blew all your money.
- I did.

268
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:42,053
The stuff I gave him is counterfeit.

269
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,053
They'll spot it the first
place he tries to spend it.

270
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,683
Are you crazy, giving
him counterfeit money?

271
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:53,313
Hey! Wait up! Where you goin'?

272
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:15,623
What the hell are you gonna do if
Snyder puts the finger on you?

273
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:18,758
- You're committin' suicide, kid.
- What difference does it make?

274
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:23,133
If Snyder knows, so does everybody
else. He never gets anything first.

275
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:26,473
Hey, listen to me. Don't go
back to your place tonight.

276
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:30,053
Don't go anyplace you
usually go. You hear me?

277
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:32,778
Damn! There's no answer at Luther's.

278
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:36,353
Look, you better get
out of town or something.

279
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:40,023
Hey, lady, lady, let go!

280
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:41,613
Ma'am! Ma'am! Hey!

281
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,823
I want my nickel
back for that telephone!

282
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:53,453
No, sir. Nobody here did.

283
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:55,503
1521 North Bryant.

284
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:16,143
- Is he dead? - I don't know.
There was a big fight.

285
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:19,273
I don't know. Somebody
must've pushed him.

286
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,323
- Jesus!
- Luther!

287
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,653
- Luther!
- Jesus!

288
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:31,623
God! No! No! No!

289
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:34,543
Luther! Luther!

290
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:38,663
What happened? God, who would
do such a thing to you, Luther?

291
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:45,053
Come on. Come on! Let's
get out of here.

292
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:50,843
Come on! If Snyder catches
you here, you're dead!

293
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,223
- Get outta here!
- Outta the way.

294
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:58,393
Help me, help me, help me!

295
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:47,613
Excuse me.

296
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,073
I'm looking for a guy named
Henry Gondorff. You know him?

297
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:52,283
No.

298
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,453
You sure?

299
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:02,423
- Beat it.
- Luther Coleman sent me.

300
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,753
- Are you Hooker?
- Yeah.

301
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,843
Why didn't you say so?

302
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:17,643
We heard about Luther
last night. Come on.

303
00:25:25,153 --> 00:25:27,653
I thought maybe you
were a cop or something.

304
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,483
It's the room in the back.

305
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:34,163
He wasn't expecting
you so soon, though.

306
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,703
Thanks.

307
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:45,023
The great Henry Gondorff.

308
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:49,273
Turn it off!

309
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,698
You sober?

310
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:56,403
Turn it off, will ya?

311
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:15,343
Glad to meet you, kid. You're
a real horse's ass.

312
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,763
Luther said I could
learn something from you.

313
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:23,763
I already know how to drink.

314
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:26,143
Sorry about Luther.

315
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:29,813
He was the best street
worker I ever saw.

316
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:35,653
He had you down as a
big-timer. What happened?

317
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:42,583
I conned a senator from
Florida on a stock deal.

318
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:46,253
A real lop-ear; thought he was
gonna take over General Electric.

319
00:27:46,293 --> 00:27:49,463
Some chanteusie woke him,
though, and he put the feds on me.

320
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,543
You mean you blew it.

321
00:27:52,593 --> 00:27:55,633
Luther didn't tell
me you had a big mouth.

322
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:59,183
He didn't tell me you
was a screw up either.

323
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,393
You played any big cons since then?

324
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:15,483
I lammed around a bunch of bohunk
towns, one kick ahead of the G-men.

325
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:19,203
Would be still, if Billie
hadn't set me up here.

326
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:25,533
Don't kid yourself,
friend. I still know how.

327
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:35,043
You gonna stay for breakfast, or
do you already know how to eat?

328
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,883
I picked something up along the way.

329
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:46,103
Is Lonnegan after you too?

330
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,683
I don't know. I ain't seen anybody.

331
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:51,693
You never do, kid.

332
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:07,243
Doyle?

333
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:09,373
Yeah.

334
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,463
We just talked to Chicago.

335
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,793
They got one of the
grifters last night... a nigger.

336
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:22,093
- How about the other one?
- They're still looking for him.

337
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:25,973
- Who did Combs put on it?
- He gave it to Riley and Cole.

338
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:29,183
They staked out the other guy's place
last night, but he never showed.

339
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:31,773
They figure maybe he skipped town.

340
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,403
You wanna keep after him?

341
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:37,403
You see that fella
in the red sweater?

342
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,573
His name's Danny McCoy.

343
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,403
Works a few of the
protection rackets...

344
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:43,453
when he's waiting for
something better.

345
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:47,453
Danny and I have known each
other since we were six.

346
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:53,043
Take a good look at
that face, Floyd.

347
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:57,173
Because if he ever finds out I
can be beat by one lousy grifter...

348
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,173
I'll have to kill
him and every other hood...

349
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:04,303
who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation.

350
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:06,973
- You follow?
- Yes, sir.

351
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:10,773
Good lad.

352
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:16,353
You feeling all
right this morning, Henry?

353
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,113
Yeah, fine.

354
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,613
You mind opening up the
round a little early today?

355
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,993
We got some business coming
in before hours.

356
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:26,453
- Sure.
- Check the main gearing, will ya?

357
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:30,203
Man O' War started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head.

358
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,623
Great little countess, that Billie.
She runs a spiffy house up there too.

359
00:30:36,673 --> 00:30:38,923
You plan to spend the
rest of your life here?

360
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:41,463
I could do a lot worse.

361
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:49,303
Listen, am I gonna learn to
play the big con or not?

362
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:50,893
What's your hurry?

363
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,523
- I wanna play for Lonnegan.
- You know anything about the guy?

364
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,523
Yeah, he croaked Luther. Anything
else I gotta know?

365
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:09,453
All right. He runs a numbers
racket on the South Side.

366
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,333
He owns a packing
house, a few banks...

367
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:15,253
Yeah, and half the
politicians in New York and Chicago.

368
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:18,253
Not a fix in this world is gonna
cool him out if he blows on you.

369
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,753
- I'll get him anyway.
- Why?

370
00:31:20,793 --> 00:31:25,263
'Cause I don't know
enough about killing to kill him.

371
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,823
You can't do it alone, you know.

372
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:46,493
It takes a mob of guys and
money to make 'em look good.

373
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,993
- I know plenty of guys.
- It's not like playing winos.

374
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,873
- You can't outrun Lonnegan.
- I never played for no winos.

375
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:52,663
You gotta keep his con even
after you take his money.

376
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,793
- He can't know you took him.
- You're scared of him.

377
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:58,253
Right down to my socks, buster.

378
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,253
You're talking about a
guy who'd kill a grifter...

379
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:04,713
over a chunk of money wouldn't
support him for two days.

380
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:08,513
You're gonna go for him.

381
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,763
Just don't want a hothead
looking to get even,

382
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,103
coming back halfway through...

383
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:17,983
saying, "It ain't enough," 'cause
it's all we're gonna get.

384
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:24,198
Can you get a mob together?

385
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,653
After what happened to Luther,
I can't get more than 300 guys.

386
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,333
Luther said you learn
fast. I hope he's right.

387
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:10,403
Lonnegan gets most of his
income from the numbers...

388
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,113
even though he's been
putting more money

389
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,573
into his savings and loan business.

390
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,783
- Think he's moving out
of the racket? - No.

391
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,413
He owns most of the
stock, and it's traded.

392
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:21,083
My guess is he's just trying to
build himself a respectable image.

393
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:23,163
He came out of Five Points...

394
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,373
but he's been telling everybody
he was born in Forest Hills.

395
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:26,678
He knows the market, though.

396
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,173
I don't think we can
take him on a stocks deal.

397
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,173
Twist, what about the numbers?

398
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:35,553
It's run out of a packing
house on 14th by a guy named Combs.

399
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,883
Lonnegan comes out every three
weeks or so to check on it, but...

400
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:42,183
he stays away from the day-to-day
stuff in case it's raided.

401
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,223
These are two of Combs's favorite
torpedoes: Riley and Cole.

402
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:48,273
You ever seen 'em?

403
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,273
No.

404
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:52,983
They're the ones who hit Luther.

405
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:56,493
They also got the numbers runner
you conned: a guy named Mottola.

406
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:59,913
Found him in a quarry with
a knife in his eye.

407
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:03,163
Lonnegan's had seven or eight
people rubbed on his way up.

408
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,163
His pattern has been to get
close to a racket boss...

409
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:08,833
Learn the
operation, then move in on it.

410
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:10,923
He's done it to
Gorman, O'Donnell, Buchalman.

411
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,843
He took the numbers from Sharkey.

412
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:17,263
All four of these guys are
dead. He's vindictive as hell, Henry.

413
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:21,593
Kills for pride. Doesn't add up he'd
let Hooker get away from him.

414
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:25,103
You see anything,
kid, you let us know.

415
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:28,773
If they put you on the spot, we
gotta fold the con. You got that?

416
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:32,523
Yeah. You sure it's
gotta be one of these two guys?

417
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:35,943
Nope. They're just the
only ones we know of.

418
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,663
Time.

419
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:02,893
Set me up five more
beers, will you, Danny?

420
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:14,403
- You the owner here?
- That's right.

421
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:17,153
Lt. Snyder, Bunco.

422
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:21,363
That's a Joliet badge,
Snyder. Don't cut much up here.

423
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:23,283
Looking for a guy on the
lam from a counterfeiting rap.

424
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,323
- Thought he might've come here.
- Don't think so.

425
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,083
I know everyone in the place, and
I always bounce the lamsters.

426
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:30,583
All right if I look around in here?

427
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,423
No, but you're welcome to
a free beer before you go.

428
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:44,183
I don't really need your permission.

429
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,353
I don't know what
to do with this guy.

430
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,998
He's an Irishman who doesn't drink,

431
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,603
doesn't smoke and
doesn't chase dames.

432
00:37:53,643 --> 00:37:56,113
He's a grand knight in
the Knights of Columbus...

433
00:37:56,153 --> 00:37:58,113
and he only goes out to play faro.

434
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:01,033
Sometimes plays 15, 20 hours at a
time; just him against the house.

435
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,283
- Roulette, craps?
- He won't touch 'em.

436
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,623
The croupier at Gilman's says he
never plays anything he can't win.

437
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:07,873
Sports?

438
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,163
He likes to be seen with
fighters sometimes...

439
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:12,413
but he doesn't go to
the fights or bet on 'em.

440
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:15,753
Jesus. Does he do
anything where he's not alone?

441
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:18,253
Just poker.

442
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:21,633
And he cheats.

443
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:24,133
Pretty good at it too.

444
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,223
Where does he play?

445
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:34,233
The porters say he runs a braced
game on the Century Limited...

446
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,563
when he comes out
here from New York.

447
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:38,698
$100 minimum, straight poker.

448
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,783
A lot of high rollers ride
that train just to play him.

449
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:44,703
That sounds good, J. J.

450
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:52,543
Which way are the rooms?

451
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,463
- Who told you this guy was in here?
- Nobody.

452
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:57,928
I just know what kind
of woman he likes.

453
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,423
I'm gonna check all the
joy houses till I find him.

454
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,883
Maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

455
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,183
I doubt it. Which way are the rooms?

456
00:39:06,223 --> 00:39:09,893
Right through there. But I wouldn't
go in there if I were you.

457
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:14,103
- What are you gonna do, call the
cops? - I don't have to.

458
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:18,153
You'd be busting in on the
chief of police just up the hall.

459
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,748
We'll play it out here. A
huge duke is too simple.

460
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,793
With no fix, we're gonna need
a con with a surefire blow-off.

461
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:36,293
I think we ought to play
this guy on the payoff.

462
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,133
It's the tightest game we got, and
it's not all over the papers yet.

463
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:40,258
Lonnegan is a fast egg.

464
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,923
He's not going to sit
still for a standard play.

465
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,343
What does that leave us? We
can't con the payoff to a banker.

466
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:47,883
We'll use the wire.

467
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:50,763
Haven't known a poker player
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

468
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:52,813
The wire's been out
of date for ten years.

469
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:54,813
That's why he won't know it.

470
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:56,893
I'm not sure I know it.

471
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,483
It'll take two of
us working the inside.

472
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:02,523
Any objections to
Hooker as second man?

473
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,073
All right.

474
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:09,863
We'll give Lonnegan the hook
on the train and play him here.

475
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:11,953
J. J., you think I can
get in that poker game?

476
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,663
Just show up with a lot of
money and look like a sucker.

477
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,798
I also gotta win.

478
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:21,543
By the way, any of you guys been
passing bad money lately?

479
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:27,763
If he comes in again, stall
him so I can get a look at him.

480
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:44,653
Fella by the name of Stenner had this
place 'til about six months ago...

481
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,153
but he had to give it up.

482
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:50,993
It doesn't look so good, but maybe
you can fix it up a little bit.

483
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,993
Watch your step when you come
in. There's a dip down to the left.

484
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:12,473
- How does it look, Eddie?
- It looks all right, Kid.

485
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:15,303
It's big enough, and
it's off the street.

486
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:19,313
It's kind of short notice. I'm not
sure we can get it done by Saturday.

487
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:23,903
Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark
down from New York on the Century.

488
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:26,693
We'll take it. That building at the
end of the alley, do you manage that?

489
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,233
For 15 years.

490
00:41:28,283 --> 00:41:30,248
I'll need a corner
room facing this way.

491
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:32,928
- How much a week?
- Only rents by the month.

492
00:41:32,963 --> 00:41:35,573
Two hundred and
fifty for the two of them.

493
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,743
Last time I expect to
see you down here.

494
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,663
Never heard of the place.

495
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:42,253
It's been a while since
I stocked the wire store.

496
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:44,583
Not many mobs playing that anymore.

497
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:47,058
All we'll need is the
bookie setup for now.

498
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:50,463
I'll rent you everything I got
in the warehouse for two grand.

499
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:54,803
That'll give you phones,
cages, blackboards and ticker gear.

500
00:41:54,843 --> 00:41:57,973
If you want a counter and
bar, that's another grand.

501
00:41:58,013 --> 00:42:01,813
- That's pretty steep, Benny.
- Gondorff's still a hot item.

502
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,853
- Where would I be if he gets hit?
- Just give us what you can.

503
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:07,483
We'll send a truck.
How do you want to work this?

504
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:08,788
Flat rate or percentage?

505
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:11,323
- Who's the mark?
- Doyle Lonnegan.

506
00:42:14,953 --> 00:42:17,163
Flat rate.

507
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,553
The guy in the black
hat with the gimp.

508
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:46,693
He's not as tough as he thinks.

509
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,693
Neither are we.

510
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,653
- Mr. Shaw?
- Right.

511
00:42:54,703 --> 00:42:56,668
You wanted to see me?

512
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,493
I hear there's a friendly
poker game on this train.

513
00:42:58,528 --> 00:42:59,493
You know anything about it?

514
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,493
- Oh, a little.
- Thank you, sir.

515
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:04,163
- Can you get me in that game?
- Oh, I don't know.

516
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:06,503
There's usually a waiting list.

517
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:12,173
That'll get you first
alternate, sir.

518
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,723
I'll see what I can do.

519
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,933
Twist!

520
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:28,103
- Patty, me boy! How are you?
- How are you, Twist?

521
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:30,443
Champ, you're
lookin' like a million!

522
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,443
Good to see you!

523
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:35,113
Goldie, you old son of a gun.

524
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:38,203
I saw the Kid in Denver. He
says to say hello to you.

525
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,283
Joiner, are you still
workin' those shapes?

526
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:42,543
Any number you want, Twist!

527
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,478
- Good to see you again.
- Okay, Lacey. Good to see you.

528
00:43:45,513 --> 00:43:48,373
- It's good to see you. Come on in!
- Dukey, how are you?

529
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:51,463
- When did you get back in town?
- A couple of days ago.

530
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,848
You heard about Luther
Coleman, didn't you?

531
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:57,343
Yeah. Some of the boys were passin'
the hat for Alva and the kids.

532
00:43:57,378 --> 00:44:00,803
- I never seen the guys so worked up.
- Don't worry about it, Dukey.

533
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:03,563
We're gonna send a
little calling card of our own.

534
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:05,853
Gondorff is setting up a wire store.

535
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,853
I'm gonna need a
20-man boost right away.

536
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:11,193
I got plenty of talent out
there tonight. Take your pick. Lace!

537
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:14,983
This is a tough one. These
boys have got to be the quill.

538
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:18,743
Get me the sheet. Let's
see who's in town.

539
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:21,163
Patty, give me the sheet.

540
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:22,913
Sure.

541
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:41,053
Gondorff's
already on...

542
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:52,063
Twist, you know this guy?

543
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:59,783
No, I never saw him
before. He's a dick, though.

544
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:12,213
Hello, Snyder.

545
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:15,293
- What are you doin' up here?
- I'm on vacation.

546
00:45:15,343 --> 00:45:17,963
You seen that
friend of yours lately?

547
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:19,978
No, no. He packed it in.

548
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:24,013
Enrolled in detective school.

549
00:45:30,143 --> 00:45:32,103
If you see him...

550
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:35,943
you tell him he better
pay up before I get to him.

551
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,583
That son of a bitch.

552
00:45:50,253 --> 00:45:52,213
Thanks, Lace.

553
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:54,213
Let's see what we got here.

554
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,793
Horse Face Lee, Slim Miller...

555
00:45:56,843 --> 00:46:01,053
Suitcase Murphy and the Big
Alabama are in from New Orleans.

556
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:04,425
Cryin' Jonesy and the
Boone Kid from Denver.

557
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,763
Dippy Burke and Limehouse
Chappie from New York.

558
00:46:07,813 --> 00:46:11,813
These and the guys outside should
give you 30 or more to choose from.

559
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,813
Good, Dukey.

560
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,363
Have them down at
Stenner's old pool hall before 6:00.

561
00:46:16,403 --> 00:46:18,443
We're gonna run the route tonight.

562
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:20,823
Okay, Twist, but...

563
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:23,993
if this thing blows up, remember,
I can't do you no good downtown.

564
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,993
Gondorff is federal.

565
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,708
Dukey, if this thing blows up...

566
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:31,413
the feds will be the
least of our problems.

567
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,683
Yeah?

568
00:46:52,063 --> 00:46:54,528
- You in?
- Yeah, I think so.

569
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:57,273
I gave the kayducer a
C- note. Did you find out the deck?

570
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:00,113
He usually plays with a
Tallyho Fan or a Tallyho Circle.

571
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:02,193
I got you one of each.

572
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:05,613
He likes to cold-deck
low, eights or nines.

573
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:08,373
That's nice work, J. J. Here.

574
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:34,233
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.

575
00:48:00,713 --> 00:48:04,803
- He'd like to join us.
- Yes, Clyde is a member of our firm.

576
00:48:27,453 --> 00:48:30,073
She picked him
clean. He never missed it.

577
00:48:31,623 --> 00:48:34,623
My God, it looks like he's
expecting a big night.

578
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:37,083
Must be 15, 20 grand here.

579
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:40,123
He's waiting for
you in the card room.

580
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:42,673
Let him wait.

581
00:49:26,843 --> 00:49:30,383
Just worry about your end, kid.

582
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:33,223
If we ever get to it.

583
00:49:35,053 --> 00:49:37,188
Excuse me.

584
00:49:37,223 --> 00:49:39,393
You sure you checked this guy out?

585
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:41,908
He seemed like a pleasant
man; a lot of cash on him.

586
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:44,943
Two-hundred-dollar suit, expensive
luggage. I'll vouch for him.

587
00:49:44,978 --> 00:49:46,960
Why isn't he here then?

588
00:49:46,995 --> 00:49:48,943
Don't worry. He'll be here.

589
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:50,443
All right.

590
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,833
What're you doin'?

591
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:10,553
Always drink gin with a mark,
kid. He can't tell if you cut it.

592
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:12,473
Two thousand for you, Mr. Clayton?

593
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:13,553
Thank you.

594
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,263
All right, gentlemen. Should
we not wait for him?

595
00:50:16,298 --> 00:50:17,108
Let's go.

596
00:50:17,143 --> 00:50:18,873
I think that's a good idea.

597
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:20,603
Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

598
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,743
Sorry I'm late,
guys. I was takin' a crap.

599
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:34,573
The name's Shaw.

600
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:38,243
Mr. Shaw, meet Mr.
Jameson from Chicago.

601
00:50:38,283 --> 00:50:41,003
Mr. Lombard from Philadelphia.

602
00:50:41,043 --> 00:50:43,753
- And Mr. Lonnegan from New York.
- Pleased to meet you.

603
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:45,928
Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh.

604
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:50,343
Any of you guys want to make a little
book in Chicago, I'm the guy to see.

605
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,343
Game is straight poker...

606
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,763
$100 minimum, table stakes.

607
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,013
Mr. Shaw, this is
a gentleman's game.

608
00:50:59,063 --> 00:51:02,488
We assume you're all
good for your debts.

609
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:05,983
- How much would you like, Mr. Shaw?
- I'll start with 5,000.

610
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:13,783
Mr. Shaw, we usually
require a tie at this table.

611
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:16,368
If you don't have
one, we can get you one.

612
00:51:16,403 --> 00:51:18,913
Hey, that'd be real nice
of you, Mr. Lonneman.

613
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:20,743
Lonnegan.

614
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,553
Name's Curly Jackson. Worked
for Gad Bryan outta Baldwin.

615
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:42,063
Jackson?

616
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:44,733
Jackson, Jackson. Oh, yeah.

617
00:51:44,773 --> 00:51:46,983
Ever play the wire, Curly?

618
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:51,023
Roped for it long ago. I can
shill, mark board, anything you want.

619
00:51:51,058 --> 00:51:53,693
I don't run with riffraff, and
I only drink on weekends.

620
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:57,363
Me specialty's an Englishman.

621
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,703
We got a rack of suits over there.
Pick yourself a nice tweed one.

622
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:05,833
That's all right. I've
got all my own stuff.

623
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:13,653
Doyle?

624
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:15,350
One.

625
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:17,013
Bill?

626
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:20,013
I'll take one.

627
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:23,143
- Shaw?
- Three.

628
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:28,443
And the dealer will take one.

629
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:35,783
Bet 500.

630
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,993
I'll call.

631
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:44,378
Call and raise.

632
00:52:44,413 --> 00:52:46,413
- Three hundred.
- I'm out.

633
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:48,413
Fold.

634
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,253
Your three...

635
00:52:55,253 --> 00:52:58,303
and raise... 500.

636
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,473
That's eight to me.

637
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,893
Call.

638
00:53:11,853 --> 00:53:14,523
Jacks on top.

639
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:16,533
Beats me.

640
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,703
Three tens.

641
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,588
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

642
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:31,463
But that's what you get for
playing with your head up your ass.

643
00:53:31,498 --> 00:53:34,753
Couple more like that, we
can all go to bed early.

644
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:39,473
The name's Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan.

645
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,938
You're gonna remember that...

646
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:43,763
or you're gonna get
yourself another game.

647
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,763
You follow?

648
00:53:51,483 --> 00:53:53,653
Bring it right up here!

649
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:58,863
Eddie, we brought you a
tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.

650
00:53:58,898 --> 00:54:01,453
You'll get race
results, odds, scratches,

651
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,128
pole positions, everything.

652
00:54:03,163 --> 00:54:05,663
And just as fast as
Western Union gets 'em.

653
00:54:05,698 --> 00:54:08,163
- Does J. J. know how
to use that thing?

654
00:54:08,198 --> 00:54:09,913
All he's gotta do is read.

655
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,883
The name is Joe Erie.

656
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,883
Joe Erie.

657
00:54:19,763 --> 00:54:22,683
You played for any particular mobs?

658
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,518
No.

659
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,053
- You ever play the wire before,
Erie? - No.

660
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:32,273
I never played no
big con before, but...

661
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:35,813
Luther Coleman was a friend
of mine, and I thought maybe...

662
00:54:35,863 --> 00:54:37,823
there'd be somethin' I could do.

663
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:41,903
You get that nose in
Duke Boudreau's tonight?

664
00:54:45,663 --> 00:54:47,623
Yeah.

665
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:53,043
You got moxie,
Erie. Get yourself a suit.

666
00:54:54,213 --> 00:54:56,583
Thanks.

667
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,263
I'll bet three.

668
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:08,933
Call and raise 200.

669
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:13,313
Call.

670
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:17,813
- No.
- I'm out.

671
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:20,198
Call.

672
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,823
Aces over.

673
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:24,953
Three cowboys.

674
00:55:24,993 --> 00:55:27,993
All red, queen high.

675
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,583
- Well, that finishes me.
- Don't worry about it, pal.

676
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,543
They wouldn't have let you in
here if you weren't a chump!

677
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,258
Lombard'll be joining
you in a couple of minutes.

678
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,923
- Now, look here, Shaw... -
I've had enough of this game...

679
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,213
and quite enough of this company.

680
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:45,763
Check me out, Clemens.

681
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:48,433
I guess that just
leaves the three of us.

682
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:52,353
Yes, Mr. Shaw. That
just leaves us three.

683
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:55,183
Mr. Clayton, I think we
should take a break for five minutes.

684
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:58,023
Tempers seem to be
running a little high.

685
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,693
Ah, come on, Linneman, I
was just startin' to do good.

686
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,873
Stack me a cooler.

687
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,753
We'll be in the
station in another hour.

688
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:18,138
The other guys are the big
losers. You're still okay.

689
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:21,503
Fix me a deck... threes and nines.
I'll cut it in on Clayton's deal.

690
00:56:21,538 --> 00:56:23,503
- What do you want Clayton to get?
- Nothin'.

691
00:56:23,538 --> 00:56:24,978
I want him outta there early.

692
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:27,723
I'm gonna bust that
bastard bookie in one play.

693
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:34,563
Four hundred to you,
Mr. Jameson. You're even.

694
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:36,563
Well, it just wasn't my night.

695
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,793
Oh, I need it.

696
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,913
- You know what time we get in?
- No, I don't.

697
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,543
Hey, where's your ante?

698
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:11,593
Every time I had
anything, he stayed in front of me.

699
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:36,413
Five hundred.

700
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,623
Your five. One thousand.

701
00:57:43,383 --> 00:57:45,383
I'll fold.

702
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:48,843
I'll play.

703
00:57:50,473 --> 00:57:52,433
Cards?

704
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:54,393
Two.

705
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,273
Three.

706
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:30,213
Five hundred.

707
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:36,263
Your five hundred, and one thousand.

708
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:47,573
Your one thousand. I'll
raise you two thousand.

709
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:55,823
Your two thousand.

710
00:58:58,283 --> 00:59:00,543
Mr. Clemens...

711
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,623
give me $10,000 more.

712
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:50,803
I'll call.

713
00:59:50,843 --> 00:59:53,633
Four nines.

714
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:05,483
Four Jacks.

715
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:17,743
You owe me 15 grand, pal.

716
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:33,843
Must've left my wallet in my room.

717
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,883
Don't hand me any of that crap!

718
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,223
When you come to a game like
this, you bring your money!

719
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,973
How do I know you
won't take a powder?

720
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:42,813
I'll tell you what I'll do.

721
01:00:42,853 --> 01:00:45,273
I'll send a boy around to
your room in five minutes.

722
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,318
You better have the money,

723
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:48,813
or it's gonna be all around
Chicago that you welched.

724
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,568
You won't be able to
get a game of jacks!

725
01:00:51,603 --> 01:00:54,283
Cash me in for the
rest of these bums.

726
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,928
You're on, kid.

727
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,593
But I gotta tell you, it's
a hard act to follow.

728
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:17,593
- How'd it go?
- We got working money.

729
01:01:17,628 --> 01:01:19,558
- Hey?
- Yeah?

730
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,683
- He's steamin'.
- Yeah.

731
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:23,683
Watch yourself.

732
01:01:30,483 --> 01:01:33,693
Doyle, I know I
gave him four threes!

733
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:35,693
He had to make a switch!

734
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,693
We can't let him get away with that.

735
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:41,033
What was I supposed to do? Call
him for cheating better than me?

736
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:02,433
Name's Kelly. Shaw sent me.

737
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:12,603
Your boss is quite a
card player, Mr. Kelly.

738
01:02:12,653 --> 01:02:15,823
- How does he do it?
- He cheats.

739
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:21,033
In that case, I'll keep my
money, and we'll have another game.

740
01:02:21,073 --> 01:02:23,533
You don't have any to keep.

741
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:29,873
Here's your wallet. He hired
a dame to take it from you.

742
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,583
Shaw's been plannin' to
beat your game for months.

743
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:36,133
He's been waiting for you to
cheat him so he could clip you.

744
01:02:38,173 --> 01:02:41,473
Who do you think you're talking
to, errand boy? Nobody sets me up!

745
01:02:41,513 --> 01:02:43,633
Take him back to the baggage
room! Put one in his ear!

746
01:02:43,683 --> 01:02:45,473
There were four
witnesses at that table!

747
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:49,563
Then get that other son of a bitch
and dump 'em in the first tunnel.

748
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:51,858
We're gonna be in the
station in a couple of minutes!

749
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,943
It ain't gonna look too good killing
a guy you owe money to.

750
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:59,073
There's better
ways of takin' him down.

751
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:05,873
What do you think Shaw would do if
he knew I was tellin' you this?

752
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,623
Okay.

753
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,623
Why the rat?

754
01:03:20,383 --> 01:03:23,303
I wanna take over his operation, and
I need you to help me break him.

755
01:03:31,973 --> 01:03:34,693
- Where's my money?
- Shaw's got it.

756
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:37,613
How the hell could I
ask him for it back?

757
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:40,693
We're pullin' in.

758
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:48,743
I'm givin' you a lift home.

759
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:53,293
- I was supposed to go with Shaw.
- Explain it to him somehow.

760
01:03:53,328 --> 01:03:56,673
- But he's expecting me.
- I'm givin' you a lift home.

761
01:03:56,713 --> 01:03:58,673
You follow?

762
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:05,303
Yeah, sure. Sure thing.

763
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:30,953
What makes you
think you can beat him?

764
01:04:30,988 --> 01:04:32,918
I've been planning
this for two years.

765
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:35,258
I know his organization
backwards and forwards...

766
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:38,173
and I need somebody who's
respectable but not completely legit.

767
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,213
I'm a banker, Kelly. That's
legit in this state.

768
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:43,138
All you gotta do is put down
a bet for me at Shaw's place.

769
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:47,133
I'll do the rest. I'll supply the
money. I'll supply the information.

770
01:04:47,168 --> 01:04:49,263
What about the
money you come to collect?

771
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:52,183
I'll tell him you paid it. I
keep his books. He trusts me.

772
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,143
If you help me, I'll pay back the
money he stole out of my own pocket.

773
01:04:55,178 --> 01:04:58,205
- It's worth that much to you?
- Yeah.

774
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,233
Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million.

775
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:10,958
Where do you come from, Kelly?

776
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:14,913
From the east side of New
York. A place called Five Points.

777
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,503
- But I got out of there.
- Out and up, huh?

778
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:23,463
Hey, Floyd? I'm gonna have to
keep you away from this guy.

779
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:25,503
You're liable to get ideas.

780
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:45,828
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store...

781
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:49,613
660 South Marshall at
1:30, if you're interested.

782
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:53,373
If I'm not there by quarter
to 2:00, I'm not comin'.

783
01:07:06,363 --> 01:07:08,483
Hey, Hooker, how'd it go?

784
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,483
Jake.

785
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,283
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.

786
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:27,673
- No sign of trouble, huh?
- No.

787
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:30,423
- What about Lonnegan? - I gave him
the breakdown like you said.

788
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,973
- And? - He's good.
He threatened to kill me.

789
01:07:33,013 --> 01:07:37,433
Hell, kid, if they don't do that,
you know you're not gettin' to 'em.

790
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:57,168
Hello, Doyle.

791
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:59,533
All right, Riley, what
the hell happened?

792
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:01,793
We missed him.

793
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,333
Whoever he is, he
made a fool out of you.

794
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:06,963
There was no way he
could've known we was in that room.

795
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:09,293
Somebody must've wised him up.

796
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,593
What does Cole say about that?

797
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,593
I don't know. He took it hard.

798
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:15,723
Get out of here, Riley.

799
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:18,843
Put Salino onto it.

800
01:08:18,893 --> 01:08:22,723
Salino? Why waste our best
people on a small-time job?

801
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:25,338
This is a nickel-and-dime
grifter we're after, Doyle.

802
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:27,903
- They'll get him next time.
- They had their chance.

803
01:08:27,943 --> 01:08:30,733
All they did was shoot up a
neighborhood, wake up a few cops.

804
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,903
I told you to put Salino onto it.

805
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,033
It may take a little more
time, but there won't be any holes.

806
01:08:37,068 --> 01:08:39,743
Tell Cole I wanna see
him when he comes in.

807
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:43,413
He won't be comin' in; not to
get bounced off a job anyway.

808
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:46,083
This is Salino's job, Vince.

809
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:48,753
Cole wants to muscle
in, that's his business.

810
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:51,173
But he's breakin' the
rules and Salino won't like it.

811
01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:53,213
Now, get me the books.

812
01:09:32,423 --> 01:09:35,923
Those odds on the
third race are wrong.

813
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,133
Just a minute. I'll get 'em.

814
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:41,468
Don't worry so much. You're
gonna be all right.

815
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,763
Just stay to the back
the first time around.

816
01:09:47,273 --> 01:09:50,273
Put a little of this on your nose.

817
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:35,363
Kelly?

818
01:10:39,743 --> 01:10:42,628
You should always
look to the back, kid.

819
01:10:42,663 --> 01:10:45,323
I was afraid you wasn't gonna
show. We haven't got much time.

820
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:48,203
Get on with it, then.

821
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:50,203
Sometime after 2:00...

822
01:10:50,253 --> 01:10:54,833
a guy's gonna call on that phone
and give you the name of a horse.

823
01:10:54,868 --> 01:10:57,923
All you gotta do is take
this two grand across the street...

824
01:10:57,963 --> 01:11:01,473
to Shaw's place, and
bet it on that pony.

825
01:11:01,513 --> 01:11:02,728
Don't take too much time.

826
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:05,593
We've only got four minutes
after you get the call.

827
01:11:05,643 --> 01:11:08,358
You'll not break
him with a $2,000 bet.

828
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:10,933
This is just a test. The
big one comes later.

829
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:13,443
Be careful with
that. That's all I got.

830
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:15,903
You were gonna pay me
back out of your own pocket?

831
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,903
I am. After the race.

832
01:11:18,943 --> 01:11:22,453
I gotta get back before
Shaw misses me. Good luck.

833
01:12:18,673 --> 01:12:21,218
Yeah? Go ahead.

834
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:23,673
The horse is Blue Note to win.

835
01:12:23,713 --> 01:12:26,263
- Fourth race at Narragansett.
- Got it.

836
01:12:47,953 --> 01:12:49,913
Yeah?

837
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:53,453
Blue Note to win in the
fourth race at Narragansett.

838
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:32,493
Turning for home, it's
Lady Scout by a length.

839
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,373
Speed Queen a half, Lady
Trust and Miss Petrina.

840
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:39,463
Into the stretch, it's Lady
Scout ahead, Speed Queen a half.

841
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:42,568
And at the wire, it's
Speed Queen the winner!

842
01:13:42,603 --> 01:13:45,633
Lady Scout placed and
Miss Petrina showed.

843
01:13:45,673 --> 01:13:48,303
Post numbers two, five and one.

844
01:13:48,343 --> 01:13:50,303
Taking off at 23.

845
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,303
Look at that.

846
01:13:53,393 --> 01:13:55,393
He's got his apes with him.

847
01:13:57,023 --> 01:14:00,603
Yeah, we're gonna have
to do something about that.

848
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:04,648
Bubblesome is 10, Beefsteak, 7...

849
01:14:04,683 --> 01:14:08,653
Vote Boy, 6, Kerry Patch, 12.

850
01:14:08,693 --> 01:14:12,038
Blue Note is 7 to 1.

851
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:14,873
This is your last call for the
third race at Lincoln Fields.

852
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,008
They're going to the post.

853
01:14:17,043 --> 01:14:20,713
- You may still wager if you hurry.
- There he goes.

854
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:26,923
At Detroit, the winner,
Speed Queen, paid $7.20...

855
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:29,018
4.60 and 3.40.

856
01:14:29,053 --> 01:14:31,473
Lady Scout, $7 and 4.20.

857
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:33,933
Miss Petrina paid four dollars.

858
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:38,933
Last flash at
Narragansett. Lady Higloss, 6 to 5.

859
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,563
I'd think you'd get
tired of losing, Harrigan.

860
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:46,823
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

861
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:49,363
Blue Note, $2,000 to win.

862
01:14:49,403 --> 01:14:51,363
Fourth race, Narragansett.

863
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,363
Make sure you see the cash, Eddie.

864
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:56,493
He's got a name for bettin'
money he doesn't have.

865
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,743
We'll give you the
results on that one in a minute.

866
01:14:58,778 --> 01:15:00,793
Ladies and
gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe...

867
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,463
your caller for the fourth race.

868
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:06,793
The mile and one-sixteenth handicap
at Narragansett Park, Rhode Island.

869
01:15:06,843 --> 01:15:10,133
Thirteen thousand dollars added
for three-year-olds and up.

870
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:14,263
The flag is up, and
they're off and running.

871
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,603
It's Bubblesome going to the
front, followed by Lady Higloss...

872
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,933
Vote Boy, Chancing, Beefsteak,
Kerry Patch...

873
01:15:19,968 --> 01:15:21,948
and Blue Note trails the field.

874
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,563
Around the clubhouse
turn, it's Bubblesome ahead...

875
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,813
Chancing a half, Lady
Higloss by one...

876
01:15:26,863 --> 01:15:29,823
followed by Vote Boy,
Beefsteak, Kerry Patch and Blue Note.

877
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:31,943
Into the second turn, it's
Chancing by a length.

878
01:15:31,993 --> 01:15:34,663
Lady Higloss driving on
the rail and Vote Boy...

879
01:15:34,703 --> 01:15:37,163
followed by Bubblesome,
Beefsteak, Kerry Patch and Blue Note.

880
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:39,373
Come on, Chancing!

881
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:42,298
Lady Higloss a
half, Vote Boy by one.

882
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:45,883
Lady Higloss is a hell of a finisher.
Chancing's gonna have to open up.

883
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,713
Know anything about a
horse named Blue Note?

884
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:54,723
He never done much. Probably in
there just to round out the field.

885
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:57,853
Chancing's where you want
to have your money.

886
01:15:59,933 --> 01:16:02,948
Great tip you handed me, kid.

887
01:16:02,983 --> 01:16:05,608
- Just give him time.
- Chancing by one.

888
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:08,148
And here comes Blue
Note driving on the outside!

889
01:16:08,183 --> 01:16:10,618
- Nice work, Erie. He loves ya.
- He's third!

890
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:14,243
Chancing is shortening stride, and
now it's Lady Higloss and Blue Note.

891
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:16,823
They're head to head.
They're neck and neck.

892
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:19,993
It's Lady Higloss, Blue
Note; Lady Higloss, Blue Note.

893
01:16:20,028 --> 01:16:23,298
And Blue Note wins it by a nose!

894
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,503
Lady Higloss is second by
three, and Chancing is third by one.

895
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:31,503
Who in the blazes is Blue Note?

896
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:35,553
The winner, Blue
Note, paid $16, 9.40 and $6.

897
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:39,683
So you want to have your
money on Chancing, huh?

898
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:42,028
Chancing paid 3.80.

899
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:46,273
Time for the mile and
1/16th: 1:44 and 1.

900
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:56,743
They're going to
the gate at Belmont.

901
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,708
And here are the late odds.

902
01:16:58,743 --> 01:17:01,123
Those garbage men belong to you?

903
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:04,583
Get 'em out of here and don't bring
'em back. This is a class joint.

904
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:08,503
- Hey, you, Kelly!
- Yes, sir?

905
01:17:08,543 --> 01:17:11,508
Run those bums out of here.

906
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:15,053
- Mr. Shaw, could l... - Don't
give me any of your lip, kid.

907
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:18,343
Now, run 'em out of here.

908
01:17:24,643 --> 01:17:28,143
Time for the three-quarter
mile: 1:11 and 4.

909
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:33,653
The winner, Panic
Relief, paid 12.40, 8.20 and $5.

910
01:17:33,693 --> 01:17:37,193
Barbara A., 6.20 and 4.

911
01:17:37,243 --> 01:17:40,533
Wilder paid four dollars.

912
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,533
They're at the
post at Belmont at 38.

913
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:46,663
We're waiting on one.
I'll call Belmont next.

914
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:50,713
That's it, fellas!

915
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,923
- I wanna repeat
that... - All right, J. J.

916
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,643
What do you say, pal?

917
01:18:13,403 --> 01:18:15,233
Yeah?

918
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:22,163
He's on his way.

919
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:37,173
Hi, Mutt.

920
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,093
Say, Jeff.

921
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:41,938
What'd I tell you?

922
01:18:41,973 --> 01:18:43,763
- You got lucky once.
That's not enough.

923
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:46,263
Ah, lucky, hell. I
can do it every time.

924
01:18:46,313 --> 01:18:50,943
- Why don't you then?
- It's better to do it all at once.

925
01:18:50,983 --> 01:18:53,443
We're gonna put
down 400 grand next week.

926
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:55,943
At five-to-one
odds, that's two million.

927
01:18:55,983 --> 01:18:58,733
- Twenty percent is yours.
- Got a system, Kelly?

928
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:02,703
No. You can still
lose with a system.

929
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,283
You're past-posting, aren't you?

930
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,338
Could be.

931
01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:14,583
- How?
- You're gonna stay in?

932
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:16,843
Not 'til I get some answers.

933
01:19:21,513 --> 01:19:24,053
I got a partner downtown.

934
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,553
He runs the central
office of the Western Union.

935
01:19:26,603 --> 01:19:28,603
Race results from all
over the country...

936
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:31,233
come in and go across
his desk to the bookies.

937
01:19:31,273 --> 01:19:34,103
All he does is hold 'em
up 'til he can call us,

938
01:19:34,138 --> 01:19:35,903
get a bet down on the winner.

939
01:19:35,943 --> 01:19:38,073
Then he releases the
results to the bookies.

940
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:41,113
We clean up on a race that's already
been run. You can't miss.

941
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,113
Unless the Western Union
dicks get a hold of it.

942
01:19:52,253 --> 01:19:54,583
You got the 400 grand yet?

943
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,173
No, not
yet, but...

944
01:19:57,213 --> 01:20:01,053
- There's only a grand here.
- Make another bet tomorrow.

945
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,018
Where's my money?

946
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:05,343
- I got 16 grand coming.
- You owe me 15 grand already.

947
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:08,053
If your setup's as good as you say
it is, there's plenty more to come.

948
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,688
I decide when to place the bets!

949
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,773
Not if you want me
to keep making 'em.

950
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:14,853
I gotta talk to my partner. We
can't afford to expose too much.

951
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,853
- I'll talk to him myself.
- No!

952
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:20,613
You've been waiting a long time for
this. Don't ruin it for yourself.

953
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:24,743
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 3:00. You follow?

954
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,693
Twist, I told him the
tale, but he didn't go for it.

955
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:02,693
He wants to see my
partner tomorrow at 3:00.

956
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,693
- 3:00?
- Yeah.

957
01:21:04,743 --> 01:21:06,223
We can't get a
telegraph store set up.

958
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:07,703
Any chance of talking him out of it?

959
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:10,283
None. I would've stalled him, but I
didn't have many friends in the room.

960
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:13,453
Yeah. All right, we'll
have to play him on the fly.

961
01:21:13,488 --> 01:21:15,418
I'll get Eddie looking for a place.

962
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:18,503
- Let me know when you got something.
- Sure thing, tootsie.

963
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:21,343
All right, Hooker!

964
01:21:29,143 --> 01:21:31,143
Stop him!

965
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:44,348
Hooker! Hooker!

966
01:22:44,383 --> 01:22:47,303
I'll get you, you rat!

967
01:22:54,513 --> 01:22:56,973
Why didn't you tell
me about Snyder before?

968
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,143
- I thought I'd lost him.
- You found him again.

969
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:01,853
We're gonna have to do
something about it.

970
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:04,903
- What else haven't you been
telling me? - Nothin'. That's all.

971
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:06,983
Hold still.

972
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,783
Why'd you move out of your room?

973
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:11,783
It was too noisy.

974
01:23:11,823 --> 01:23:15,493
You can't play your
friends like marks, Hooker.

975
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:18,333
You know how easy it would be
for Lonnegan's guys to get you?

976
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:20,333
All we need is a couple of days...

977
01:23:20,373 --> 01:23:23,503
and we can get the son
of a bitch and nail him.

978
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:26,093
You just won't learn, will ya?

979
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:29,463
I come in here, teach you stuff that
maybe five guys in the world know.

980
01:23:29,498 --> 01:23:31,973
Stuff most grifters couldn't
do even if they knew it.

981
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:33,883
- All you wanna do
is run down a bullet.

982
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:35,780
I'm askin' a couple of days.

983
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:37,643
I can stay clear that long!

984
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:42,603
Christ, they'll
probably miss you and hit me.

985
01:24:18,683 --> 01:24:20,893
- Hey.
- Hi.

986
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:24,353
What'll you have?

987
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,853
Give me the blue plate special.

988
01:24:26,888 --> 01:24:29,613
One blue plate special.

989
01:24:59,353 --> 01:25:01,313
- You're done?
- Yeah.

990
01:25:01,353 --> 01:25:04,183
- Guess I should've
had the meat loaf.

991
01:25:04,218 --> 01:25:05,813
It isn't any better.

992
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,983
- Hey, where's June?
- She quit.

993
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,323
I'm fillin' in for
her a couple of days...

994
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:15,323
until I can get a train out of here.

995
01:25:15,363 --> 01:25:17,323
Yeah? Where are you going?

996
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:20,623
I don't know. Depends
on what train I get on.

997
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:29,253
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

998
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:47,563
Let's go.

999
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:12,633
Excuse me, ma'am, but
we're looking for Mr...

1000
01:26:12,673 --> 01:26:14,633
- Harmon.
- Mr. Harmon's office.

1001
01:26:14,673 --> 01:26:16,558
- Mr. Harmon?
- Yeah.

1002
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:18,728
Got a work order for a painting job.

1003
01:26:18,763 --> 01:26:20,933
- For Mr. Harmon's office?
- That's right, ma'am.

1004
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:23,433
Well, hold on. Just a second.

1005
01:26:38,113 --> 01:26:40,243
Hiya.

1006
01:26:40,283 --> 01:26:43,413
- Where to?
- 110 South Wabash.

1007
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,543
110 South Wabash. Get going.

1008
01:26:48,413 --> 01:26:50,373
What happened to your face?

1009
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:53,173
Ah, got into a fight with
a raggle down on 13th.

1010
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:55,098
Cut me with her ring.

1011
01:26:55,133 --> 01:26:57,598
You oughta lay off the skirts.

1012
01:26:57,633 --> 01:27:01,723
You don't find any of my boys messin'
around with that kind of trash.

1013
01:27:09,773 --> 01:27:13,853
Brigham signed it, all right. I can't
understand why he didn't tell me.

1014
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:16,073
Ah, he's like all them supervisors.

1015
01:27:16,113 --> 01:27:18,233
They think they're too
good for regular people.

1016
01:27:18,283 --> 01:27:21,073
He says he was in here a while
ago and the place was a mess.

1017
01:27:21,113 --> 01:27:23,453
We'll hurry so we don't
keep you out too long.

1018
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,453
Why can't I work with you in here?

1019
01:27:25,493 --> 01:27:27,038
We gotta cover the
floor, the furniture,

1020
01:27:27,073 --> 01:27:28,583
everything so we
don't spill on nothin'.

1021
01:27:28,623 --> 01:27:30,833
If you want to sit in here
with a tarp over your head,

1022
01:27:30,868 --> 01:27:31,753
you're welcome to it.

1023
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,583
- How long will you be?
- An hour or two at the most.

1024
01:27:34,633 --> 01:27:36,593
It's a small job.

1025
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:24,973
We'll go in the side door here.

1026
01:28:36,063 --> 01:28:38,193
Hiya, Les.

1027
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:39,903
Les, this is Doyle Lonnegan.

1028
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:42,323
- Mr. Lonnegan, this is Les Harmon.
- How do you do?

1029
01:28:42,363 --> 01:28:44,283
What did you bring him here for?

1030
01:28:44,323 --> 01:28:46,573
I thought it would be a good
idea for him to see the operation.

1031
01:28:46,608 --> 01:28:49,703
I'm having the place
painted. We can't talk in here now.

1032
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:54,753
We'll have to find someplace
else. Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan.

1033
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:02,303
Miss Barnes, I'm going
home a little early.

1034
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:04,053
If there are any calls...

1035
01:29:04,093 --> 01:29:07,473
tell them they can reach
me here tomorrow morning.

1036
01:29:07,513 --> 01:29:09,683
Mr. Lonnegan?

1037
01:29:41,593 --> 01:29:43,553
I wanna see it one more time.

1038
01:29:43,593 --> 01:29:47,013
I can't do it. We got telegraph
inspectors all over the place.

1039
01:29:47,053 --> 01:29:49,013
One more time isn't
gonna make much difference.

1040
01:29:49,053 --> 01:29:51,893
We got 400 grand coming in
from the coast next week.

1041
01:29:51,933 --> 01:29:54,353
You gonna risk
that on a lousy 15 G's?

1042
01:29:54,393 --> 01:29:57,603
If it works again tomorrow,
I'll finance the whole thing.

1043
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:00,943
Half a million
dollars. Sixty-forty, we split.

1044
01:30:00,983 --> 01:30:04,483
What are you talking... We've already
got a guy. He's gonna give us half.

1045
01:30:04,533 --> 01:30:08,033
- What am I supposed to say to him?
- Say to him what you want.

1046
01:30:08,073 --> 01:30:10,533
What I know about your
operation, if I were you...

1047
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,743
I'd be worried about
making me happy.

1048
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:15,543
Your guy says a week. How do
we know it won't be a month?

1049
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:16,628
Lonnegan here's a banker.

1050
01:30:16,663 --> 01:30:18,968
He can get the money
without any questions asked.

1051
01:30:19,003 --> 01:30:22,003
We can't keep goin' into Shaw's
place and cleanin' up on long shots.

1052
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:25,463
- He's bound to get wise.
- All right. We'll go for short odds.

1053
01:30:25,763 --> 01:30:27,803
You follow?

1054
01:30:48,363 --> 01:30:50,363
Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

1055
01:30:52,203 --> 01:30:54,493
I don't know. What's up?

1056
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:56,793
F. B. I.

1057
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,793
Special Agent Polk would
like a few words with you.

1058
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:01,793
You got a couple of minutes?

1059
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:03,793
Yeah, sure.

1060
01:31:30,493 --> 01:31:33,418
No, no, no. It's got to
be south of the river.

1061
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:38,413
Probably this section in here.
31st, 39th, Morgan and Halstead.

1062
01:31:38,448 --> 01:31:41,378
Now, that's this section here.

1063
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:46,003
Now, let's break it into
two sections along 35th.

1064
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:49,423
What the hell is
this? I got work to do.

1065
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:51,843
Sit down and shut up, will ya?

1066
01:31:51,883 --> 01:31:55,933
Try not to live up to
all my expectations.

1067
01:31:55,968 --> 01:31:57,728
Take two men with you.

1068
01:31:57,763 --> 01:32:00,643
Work your way south from
31st to 35th, Morgan and Halstead.

1069
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:04,153
Go into every place and
let me know what you find.

1070
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:14,363
We've been told you know a
hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.

1071
01:32:14,413 --> 01:32:17,123
- You know him, or don't you?
- Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

1072
01:32:17,163 --> 01:32:21,663
Well, we do. He's chumming around
with a big C named Henry Gondorff.

1073
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:23,663
Ring any bells?

1074
01:32:23,713 --> 01:32:26,173
Every bunco man in the
country knows Gondorff.

1075
01:32:26,213 --> 01:32:30,383
Well, there's word he's gonna
run a con on the South Side here.

1076
01:32:30,423 --> 01:32:33,633
We've got a year-old Florida
warrant on him, but it's a thin beef.

1077
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,553
He can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold.

1078
01:32:37,603 --> 01:32:40,393
All we want you to do is
pick up Hooker for us.

1079
01:32:40,433 --> 01:32:43,063
Why don't you pick him up yourself?

1080
01:32:43,103 --> 01:32:44,938
If word gets out the
feds are in on it,

1081
01:32:44,973 --> 01:32:46,773
Gondorff will fold
up the whole thing.

1082
01:32:46,813 --> 01:32:49,323
Wouldn't that be too bad?

1083
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:53,783
Then you'd have to move out of
this nice office you've got here.

1084
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,788
Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot.

1085
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:01,243
I spent too much time in dumps
like this eating Gondorff's dust...

1086
01:33:01,293 --> 01:33:04,913
while you guys in the bunco
squads get rich tipping him off!

1087
01:33:04,963 --> 01:33:07,638
That's not gonna happen this time.

1088
01:33:07,673 --> 01:33:10,713
We're not gonna tell
the police we're here.

1089
01:33:10,748 --> 01:33:12,670
You keep your mouth
shut and do a job,

1090
01:33:12,705 --> 01:33:14,593
there'll be reward
bucks in it for you.

1091
01:33:14,633 --> 01:33:19,053
And you better take it, 'cause I can
make you work for us without it.

1092
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:21,813
What the hell good is Hooker to you?

1093
01:33:21,853 --> 01:33:24,603
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

1094
01:33:26,353 --> 01:33:28,983
- He'll never do it.
- I think he will.

1095
01:33:52,173 --> 01:33:54,633
He's there. Let's get on it.

1096
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:58,133
What's the line on Exponent?

1097
01:33:59,223 --> 01:34:00,893
Five to one.

1098
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:04,183
- How's it going?
- Nothing yet.

1099
01:34:04,223 --> 01:34:07,353
I had a good one on the lead at
Lincoln Fields, but he faded.

1100
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:10,403
Best we had the last hour was
Love Potion at Rockingham...

1101
01:34:10,443 --> 01:34:12,523
and she was 5 to 1.

1102
01:34:12,573 --> 01:34:15,863
All the long shots coming in today.

1103
01:34:15,903 --> 01:34:17,903
Take 4 to 1 if you have to.

1104
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:19,918
Okay.

1105
01:34:19,953 --> 01:34:22,783
You can forget the boodle, Eddie.

1106
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:26,663
He could hit us for 15 grand
at 4 to 1. We can't handle that.

1107
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,663
- Give him the shutout.
- Okay.

1108
01:34:28,713 --> 01:34:32,213
Okay, Billie, here we go.

1109
01:34:32,253 --> 01:34:35,423
At the wire, it's Wrecking
Crew, the winner by five.

1110
01:34:35,463 --> 01:34:39,053
Black Mischief,
second; Whichaway, third.

1111
01:34:39,093 --> 01:34:43,143
Wrecking Crew was...
3 to 1. That's our boy.

1112
01:34:46,723 --> 01:34:48,683
Henry?

1113
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:55,113
Here we go, Henry. We got a 3
to 1 at Belmont... Wrecking Crew.

1114
01:34:58,613 --> 01:35:00,613
Yeah?

1115
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:07,163
All right. Okay.

1116
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:23,683
- Yeah?
- In the sixth race at Belmont.

1117
01:35:23,723 --> 01:35:26,513
Wrecking Crew to win; Black
Mischief to place;

1118
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:28,523
Whichaway to show.

1119
01:35:38,943 --> 01:35:40,903
Wait here.

1120
01:35:45,033 --> 01:35:47,543
The winner, Time To Go,
paid seven dollars...

1121
01:35:47,578 --> 01:35:50,083
5.40 and 3.80.

1122
01:35:50,123 --> 01:35:53,623
Joy Flag, $6 and 4.20.

1123
01:35:53,673 --> 01:35:56,633
Readily paid 3.80 to show.

1124
01:35:56,673 --> 01:35:57,848
The weather's threatening,

1125
01:35:57,883 --> 01:36:00,513
but the track is fast there
in Salem, New Hampshire.

1126
01:36:03,433 --> 01:36:06,513
Here's a late jockey change there
in the fifth at Rockingham.

1127
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:09,433
R. C. Stark will ride Itsie-Bitsie.

1128
01:36:09,473 --> 01:36:11,433
- Thank you, sir.
- That's R. C. Stark.

1129
01:36:11,483 --> 01:36:13,943
Five thousand on Black
Mischief, across the board.

1130
01:36:13,983 --> 01:36:15,943
Sixth at Belmont.

1131
01:36:17,363 --> 01:36:20,533
Would you hurry up there, please?

1132
01:36:20,573 --> 01:36:24,363
Wrecking Crew is 3 to
1; Vale Of Tears, four;

1133
01:36:24,398 --> 01:36:27,163
Black Mischief,
five; Whichaway, six;

1134
01:36:27,203 --> 01:36:31,083
Chief Yeoman, 12;
Peerless Pal is 20;

1135
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,873
and Mariato is, uh, 40.

1136
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:36,293
And here we go for
the sixth at Belmont.

1137
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,633
It's five and a half
furlongs. They're at the post.

1138
01:36:38,673 --> 01:36:40,633
- Now.
- The flag is up.

1139
01:36:40,673 --> 01:36:42,633
- And they're off!
- Sixth race, Belmont, 15,000.

1140
01:36:42,673 --> 01:36:45,133
Excuse me, sir. We can't take any
bets once the race is started.

1141
01:36:45,183 --> 01:36:48,358
You can bet on another
race if you care to.

1142
01:36:48,393 --> 01:36:50,813
Going into the backstretch,
it's Wrecking Crew by two.

1143
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:55,063
Whichaway a half, Black Mischief and
Vale Of Tears driving on the outside.

1144
01:36:55,103 --> 01:36:57,863
- Nothin', thank you.
- What happened?

1145
01:36:57,903 --> 01:37:00,273
I didn't get the bet down in time.

1146
01:37:00,308 --> 01:37:02,283
Jesus!

1147
01:37:04,493 --> 01:37:07,913
Heading for home, it's Wrecking
Crew all alone by six lengths...

1148
01:37:07,948 --> 01:37:10,048
Whichaway a
length, and Vale of Tears.

1149
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:12,418
It's Wrecking Crew, Whichaway
and Black Mischief.

1150
01:37:12,453 --> 01:37:16,293
And at the wire, Wrecking
Crew wins it by six lengths.

1151
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:18,083
Black Mischief is
second by a head...

1152
01:37:18,133 --> 01:37:20,423
Whichaway is third, followed
by Vale Of Tears.

1153
01:37:22,383 --> 01:37:25,473
You should've had your
money on Wrecking Crew.

1154
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:27,973
It's raining and the track
is sloppy at Riverside Park.

1155
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,013
There's a late scratch there.

1156
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:33,563
Transmutate is scratched
in the fifth at Riverside.

1157
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:36,103
At Belmont, the
winner, Wrecking Crew...

1158
01:37:36,138 --> 01:37:39,483
paid $6, 4.20 and 2.80.

1159
01:37:39,523 --> 01:37:42,483
Black Mischief, 4.60 and 3.20.

1160
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:49,873
I'll have half a million here
by post time tomorrow.

1161
01:37:49,913 --> 01:37:52,543
Lay it on the first race where
the odds are 4 to 1 or better.

1162
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,453
- Make sure I get to
the window on time.

1163
01:37:54,488 --> 01:37:55,623
How am I gonna do that?

1164
01:37:55,663 --> 01:37:58,213
I don't know. Figure it
out for yourself, Kelly.

1165
01:38:25,993 --> 01:38:27,783
Finished?

1166
01:38:27,823 --> 01:38:29,243
Yeah.

1167
01:38:29,283 --> 01:38:31,573
Meat loaf, apple
pie and a cup of coffee.

1168
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:41,503
- Say, what time you get off work
here? - 2:00 a. m.

1169
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:45,173
- Yeah? Doing anything tonight?
- Yeah. Sleepin'.

1170
01:38:45,213 --> 01:38:47,213
Eighty-five.

1171
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:08,783
- You got a back door to this place?
- What's wrong with the front?

1172
01:39:08,823 --> 01:39:11,613
There's a guy out there I don't
need to see. Don't look around.

1173
01:39:11,663 --> 01:39:14,703
- What does he want?
- He'd like to kill me.

1174
01:39:14,743 --> 01:39:18,623
Do me a favor. Go into the bathroom,
open the window and wait there.

1175
01:39:18,663 --> 01:39:21,503
Do what I tell you, and
everything will be jake.

1176
01:39:21,543 --> 01:39:23,503
Please.

1177
01:39:30,093 --> 01:39:32,093
Thanks. Good night.

1178
01:40:05,503 --> 01:40:07,463
It's taken.

1179
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,943
Thanks. See ya.

1180
01:40:31,783 --> 01:40:33,243
Shit.

1181
01:41:16,323 --> 01:41:19,333
Salino. Hey,
I wasn't...

1182
01:41:43,183 --> 01:41:46,318
Hey! Gotcha, Hooker!

1183
01:41:46,353 --> 01:41:48,853
Hey there, Snyder. Long time no see.

1184
01:41:48,888 --> 01:41:50,863
Get goin'!

1185
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:19,473
Chuck...

1186
01:42:19,513 --> 01:42:22,563
get this off to the
department right away.

1187
01:42:22,598 --> 01:42:24,563
Yes, sir.

1188
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:44,123
Hello, Hooker. Take them off.

1189
01:42:44,163 --> 01:42:46,543
Special Agent Polk, F. B. I.

1190
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,543
Have a chair.

1191
01:42:51,753 --> 01:42:54,133
- You want a drink or something?
- No.

1192
01:42:55,633 --> 01:42:59,303
We want to talk to
you about Henry Gondorff.

1193
01:42:59,343 --> 01:43:01,683
Yeah? I don't think I know him.

1194
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:05,163
Give yourself a couple of seconds.
You wouldn't want to lie to me.

1195
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:08,603
Lt. Snyder here says you've done a
lot of confidence work in his town.

1196
01:43:08,638 --> 01:43:10,643
Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder
doesn't know shit.

1197
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:15,443
- You ain't got nothin' on me.
- Yeah?

1198
01:43:15,483 --> 01:43:17,493
How about counterfeiting?

1199
01:43:21,453 --> 01:43:23,823
We've got a tip that
Gondorff is gonna

1200
01:43:23,858 --> 01:43:25,873
run a con on the South Side here.

1201
01:43:25,913 --> 01:43:29,213
All you've gotta do is tell us
when he's gonna play his chump.

1202
01:43:29,253 --> 01:43:32,173
We come in at the
sting, make the pinch, and...

1203
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:35,383
you walk out free as a bird.

1204
01:43:35,423 --> 01:43:37,883
No.

1205
01:43:37,923 --> 01:43:41,553
You wanna spend the next 20
years in a federal penitentiary...

1206
01:43:41,593 --> 01:43:43,053
starting tonight?

1207
01:43:43,093 --> 01:43:44,553
I'll make parole.

1208
01:43:45,683 --> 01:43:48,473
Like hell. You won't
even get a review.

1209
01:43:48,523 --> 01:43:50,523
I'll chance it.

1210
01:43:53,313 --> 01:43:57,273
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

1211
01:43:57,323 --> 01:43:58,748
We might even provide you with a

1212
01:43:58,783 --> 01:44:00,743
little company on
your way up the river.

1213
01:44:00,783 --> 01:44:03,283
That wife of Luther
Coleman's... what was her name?

1214
01:44:03,323 --> 01:44:05,958
- Alva.
- Alva.

1215
01:44:05,993 --> 01:44:08,833
That's it. Alva Coleman.

1216
01:44:08,873 --> 01:44:11,468
Pretty fair grifter in her time.

1217
01:44:11,503 --> 01:44:14,133
Snyder's given us quite
a folder on her.

1218
01:44:14,173 --> 01:44:17,808
Nothing major by itself, but...

1219
01:44:17,843 --> 01:44:21,223
put 'em all together, it
could add up to a lot of years.

1220
01:44:22,633 --> 01:44:26,763
- You stink, mister.
- Don't be a sap.

1221
01:44:26,803 --> 01:44:28,933
It's not her I want.

1222
01:44:28,973 --> 01:44:31,773
If you're too
dumb to save yourself...

1223
01:44:31,813 --> 01:44:34,273
there's no sense dragging
her down with ya.

1224
01:44:56,383 --> 01:44:58,383
It's over, Hooker.

1225
01:45:00,053 --> 01:45:03,013
You can save me a lot of trouble.

1226
01:45:03,053 --> 01:45:07,513
But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff
whether you help me out or not.

1227
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:25,033
- You'll wait till the chump
is played? - Hell, yes.

1228
01:45:25,073 --> 01:45:27,533
We don't care about the
mark. He deserves what he gets.

1229
01:45:27,573 --> 01:45:28,788
I mean completely played.

1230
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,543
You come in before we beat
him, and I'll kill him.

1231
01:45:32,623 --> 01:45:34,753
All right, Hooker.

1232
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:38,503
But you try to take it on the lam,
and we'll shoot you down on sight.

1233
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:49,263
As long as I get to finish the play.

1234
01:45:59,273 --> 01:46:01,943
What is it, kid? You're
not saying much.

1235
01:46:01,983 --> 01:46:05,243
- Just got the jumps.
- Come in.

1236
01:46:05,283 --> 01:46:09,073
Things are a little slow. I wanna
open the round for the girls.

1237
01:46:09,123 --> 01:46:11,083
Sure.

1238
01:46:14,793 --> 01:46:17,083
Take it easy, kid. We're
not gonna lose him now.

1239
01:46:17,123 --> 01:46:20,423
We had him ten years ago when
he decided to be somebody.

1240
01:46:20,463 --> 01:46:23,673
Believe me, I've
seen enough to know. Ten.

1241
01:46:23,713 --> 01:46:25,673
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

1242
01:46:25,723 --> 01:46:28,183
- Go. -
Thirty-one.

1243
01:46:34,473 --> 01:46:37,563
How many guys you
conned in your life, Henry?

1244
01:46:37,603 --> 01:46:40,443
I don't know. Two, three hundred.

1245
01:46:40,483 --> 01:46:44,903
Sometimes we played two a
day when I was with O'Shea's mob.

1246
01:46:44,943 --> 01:46:47,703
Of course, Chicago
was a rigged town.

1247
01:46:47,743 --> 01:46:52,323
The fix was in. The dicks took
their end without a beef.

1248
01:46:52,373 --> 01:46:55,623
We had it down to a business.

1249
01:46:55,658 --> 01:46:58,873
And it really stunk, kid.

1250
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:03,293
No sense in bein' a grifter if it's
the same thing as bein' a citizen.

1251
01:47:03,343 --> 01:47:07,303
I got packin' to do. I'm gonna be
a hot number again after tomorrow.

1252
01:47:18,523 --> 01:47:22,523
I wouldn't ask you to do this,
you know, if it weren't for Luther.

1253
01:47:22,563 --> 01:47:26,693
Nothin's gonna make up for
Luther. Revenge is for suckers.

1254
01:47:26,728 --> 01:47:29,403
I've been griftin' 30
years. I never got any.

1255
01:47:31,863 --> 01:47:33,823
Then why're you doin' it?

1256
01:47:35,243 --> 01:47:38,163
It seems worthwhile, doesn't it?

1257
01:47:43,713 --> 01:47:45,713
See ya.

1258
01:50:06,193 --> 01:50:08,103
Looks like he missed you.

1259
01:50:08,153 --> 01:50:12,073
Yeah, yeah. This time, anyway.

1260
01:50:12,108 --> 01:50:14,193
Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

1261
01:50:21,243 --> 01:50:24,793
I was wonderin' if you might
want to come out for a while...

1262
01:50:24,833 --> 01:50:26,793
maybe have a drink or something.

1263
01:50:26,833 --> 01:50:30,383
You move right along, don't you?

1264
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:33,003
Hey, I don't mean nothin' by it.

1265
01:50:33,053 --> 01:50:36,053
I just don't know
many regular girls, is all.

1266
01:50:36,093 --> 01:50:38,513
And you expect me to
come out just like that?

1267
01:50:38,553 --> 01:50:42,143
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't
still be standin' here in the hall.

1268
01:50:42,183 --> 01:50:45,068
I don't even know you.

1269
01:50:45,103 --> 01:50:49,523
You know me. I'm just like you.

1270
01:50:49,563 --> 01:50:52,983
It's 2:00 in the
morning, and I don't know nobody.

1271
01:51:18,883 --> 01:51:22,223
Come on, Henry. Knock off.

1272
01:51:22,263 --> 01:51:24,473
You've done everything you can.

1273
01:55:55,873 --> 01:55:59,003
- Yeah? Polk.
- Polk, this is Hooker.

1274
01:55:59,043 --> 01:56:01,673
- Ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1275
01:56:01,713 --> 01:56:03,883
Everything's all set. There'll
be a guy or two at the door.

1276
01:56:03,923 --> 01:56:06,173
Nobody's carrying any heaters, so
you shouldn't have any trouble.

1277
01:56:06,213 --> 01:56:08,173
Okay. See you there.

1278
01:57:10,943 --> 01:57:14,913
She was gonna kill you,
kid. Her name's Loretta Salino.

1279
01:57:14,953 --> 01:57:18,583
Lonnegan's people set her
up in the diner. Come on.

1280
01:57:18,623 --> 01:57:21,123
Let's get out of here.

1281
01:57:21,163 --> 01:57:23,163
Come on!

1282
01:57:27,793 --> 01:57:29,803
Come on!

1283
01:57:35,013 --> 01:57:37,763
She could have killed me last night.

1284
01:57:37,803 --> 01:57:40,433
Too many people could
have seen you go in her room.

1285
01:57:40,473 --> 01:57:45,193
She was a real professional. Used
to work in the Dutch Schultz mob.

1286
01:57:45,233 --> 01:57:47,863
Who are you?

1287
01:57:47,903 --> 01:57:50,363
Gondorff asked me to look after you.

1288
01:58:00,413 --> 01:58:03,873
Snyder, we just got a
tip that Gondorff's mark...

1289
01:58:03,913 --> 01:58:06,043
is some big New York wheel.

1290
01:58:06,083 --> 01:58:08,753
As soon as we're inside, you
get him out of there fast...

1291
01:58:08,793 --> 01:58:10,753
before the reporters show up.

1292
01:58:10,803 --> 01:58:13,593
I don't want any big shots
around to mess this up for me.

1293
01:58:13,633 --> 01:58:15,593
All right, let's go!

1294
01:59:16,403 --> 01:59:19,208
Let's go, guys!

1295
01:59:19,243 --> 01:59:21,243
The flag is up, kid.

1296
01:59:27,713 --> 01:59:30,583
- Anytime, J. J.
- I'm workin' on it.

1297
01:59:41,593 --> 01:59:43,973
We got one, Billie. Here we go.

1298
01:59:58,073 --> 02:00:00,863
- Yeah?
- Place it on Lucky Dan...

1299
02:00:00,913 --> 02:00:03,373
third race at Riverside Park.

1300
02:00:23,093 --> 02:00:25,723
1:11 and 3/5ths seconds.

1301
02:00:25,763 --> 02:00:28,813
They were off at 21.

1302
02:00:28,853 --> 02:00:33,103
Last call on the
third at Riverside Park.

1303
02:00:33,153 --> 02:00:35,113
They're at the post.

1304
02:00:35,153 --> 02:00:37,903
At Havre De Grace, the
winner, Light Chatter...

1305
02:00:37,943 --> 02:00:41,153
paid 5.40, 3.80...

1306
02:00:41,203 --> 02:00:43,493
and 2.40.

1307
02:00:43,533 --> 02:00:47,743
- Blacksod... -
$500,000 to win.

1308
02:00:47,793 --> 02:00:50,333
Lucky Dan, third race at Riverside.

1309
02:00:52,373 --> 02:00:54,673
- Post time for the third race...
- You heard me.

1310
02:00:54,713 --> 02:00:57,843
- is 2:27.
- Hold on, sir.

1311
02:00:57,883 --> 02:00:59,883
- There's a jockey change...
- I'll get the manager.

1312
02:00:59,918 --> 02:01:01,848
in the fourth at Belmont.

1313
02:01:01,883 --> 02:01:06,183
Jay Stout will ride Flying Cross.

1314
02:01:06,223 --> 02:01:11,273
See that guy over there? He just bet
a half million dollars on Lucky Dan.

1315
02:01:11,313 --> 02:01:14,023
The winner at Rockingham Park...

1316
02:01:14,063 --> 02:01:17,063
Enfin, paid 6.10...

1317
02:01:17,098 --> 02:01:19,863
4.30 and 2.50.

1318
02:01:23,953 --> 02:01:25,913
What's your problem?

1319
02:01:25,953 --> 02:01:28,533
I'm putting half a million
dollars on Lucky Dan to win...

1320
02:01:28,583 --> 02:01:30,333
third race at Riverside.

1321
02:01:30,373 --> 02:01:34,293
Can't lay that off in time. A
bet like that could break us.

1322
02:01:36,293 --> 02:01:39,383
Not only are you a cheat...

1323
02:01:39,423 --> 02:01:41,513
you're a gutless cheat as well.

1324
02:01:46,223 --> 02:01:49,353
- What are the odds?
- Four to one.

1325
02:01:52,433 --> 02:01:54,443
Take all of it.

1326
02:02:05,323 --> 02:02:07,363
Ladies and
gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe...

1327
02:02:07,413 --> 02:02:09,783
calling the third race at Riverside.

1328
02:02:09,833 --> 02:02:13,253
This is a claiming race for
$1,500 for three-year-olds and up.

1329
02:02:13,288 --> 02:02:16,395
It's been raining, and
the track is muddy.

1330
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:19,503
The flag is up, and
they're off and running.

1331
02:02:19,543 --> 02:02:21,753
Dr. Twink is going to the front...

1332
02:02:21,803 --> 02:02:24,883
followed by Lucky
Dan, Ima Dreamer, Orkin...

1333
02:02:24,923 --> 02:02:28,143
Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star.

1334
02:02:28,183 --> 02:02:31,143
Around the clubhouse
turn, it's Lucky Dan ahead...

1335
02:02:31,183 --> 02:02:33,563
Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half...

1336
02:02:33,603 --> 02:02:37,943
followed by Ima Dreamer, Josie
G., Chi Chi and Little Star.

1337
02:02:37,983 --> 02:02:39,948
Into the backstretch...

1338
02:02:39,983 --> 02:02:42,613
it's Lucky Dan a
length, Dr. Twink a half...

1339
02:02:42,653 --> 02:02:45,248
Orkin a head, Ima Dreamer by one.

1340
02:02:45,283 --> 02:02:47,953
Sorry, I couldn't wait. Everything
going all right?

1341
02:02:47,993 --> 02:02:50,993
You got nothing to worry about.

1342
02:02:51,033 --> 02:02:55,123
- Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half.
- I put it all on Lucky Dan.

1343
02:02:55,158 --> 02:02:57,758
Half a million dollars to win.

1344
02:02:57,793 --> 02:03:00,843
- Into the turn Lucky Dan still a
length. - To win?

1345
02:03:00,878 --> 02:03:04,673
I said place! Place
it on Lucky...

1346
02:03:04,713 --> 02:03:07,138
That horse is gonna run second!

1347
02:03:07,173 --> 02:03:10,263
Ima Dreamer a half, Dr.
Twink a half and Orkin by two,

1348
02:03:10,298 --> 02:03:11,990
followed by Little Star.

1349
02:03:12,025 --> 02:03:13,683
It's a driving finish!

1350
02:03:13,723 --> 02:03:16,393
There's been a
mistake. Give me my money back!

1351
02:03:16,433 --> 02:03:19,193
I tell you there's been a mistake!
Give me my goddamn money back!

1352
02:03:20,653 --> 02:03:23,193
All right, everybody.
F. B. I.! Don't anybody try to leave.

1353
02:03:23,233 --> 02:03:24,198
Stand on your feet,

1354
02:03:24,233 --> 02:03:27,243
put your hands over your
head and move nice and slow.

1355
02:03:27,283 --> 02:03:30,458
Snyder!

1356
02:03:30,493 --> 02:03:34,583
Get 'em up against the wall. Make
sure they're not carrying anything.

1357
02:03:37,333 --> 02:03:40,253
Hello, Henry. It's been a long time.

1358
02:03:40,293 --> 02:03:42,713
But it's over.

1359
02:03:42,753 --> 02:03:45,003
Okay, kid, you can go.

1360
02:03:47,173 --> 02:03:50,223
All right, I said
hands up. Keep 'em up!

1361
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:53,853
Come on. Move 'em back! Put 'em up!

1362
02:04:13,203 --> 02:04:16,123
Get him out. Get him out!

1363
02:04:17,163 --> 02:04:20,123
Come on! Gotta get you out of here!

1364
02:04:30,053 --> 02:04:32,518
- Come on!
- But my money's in there!

1365
02:04:32,553 --> 02:04:35,433
There's a couple of dead guys
too. You can't get mixed up in that.

1366
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:38,313
You don't understand. There's a
half a million dollars in there!

1367
02:04:48,193 --> 02:04:50,153
He's gone.

1368
02:04:56,913 --> 02:04:58,993
Okay, Henry, all clear.

1369
02:05:17,893 --> 02:05:20,603
Can you believe
it? We pulled it off.

1370
02:05:20,643 --> 02:05:21,818
It's a nice con, Hickey.

1371
02:05:21,853 --> 02:05:24,653
I thought you were the feds
myself when you came in.

1372
02:05:24,693 --> 02:05:28,023
No trouble, Henry. Snyder
went for it all the way.

1373
02:05:28,073 --> 02:05:31,823
You should've seen the
rag he lit under Lonnegan!

1374
02:05:36,743 --> 02:05:39,203
Well, kid, you beat him.

1375
02:05:40,453 --> 02:05:43,293
You're right,
Henry. It's not enough.

1376
02:05:45,923 --> 02:05:47,883
But it's close.

1377
02:05:51,133 --> 02:05:54,223
Okay, guys, let's take
this place apart fast.

1378
02:05:54,263 --> 02:05:57,603
You can pick up your splits
from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight.

1379
02:06:02,273 --> 02:06:04,233
Nice goin', J. J.

1380
02:06:25,623 --> 02:06:28,083
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

1381
02:06:29,133 --> 02:06:31,593
Nah. I'd only blow it.

1382
02:07:14,263 --> 02:07:16,883
One, two.
One, two, three.
