1
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,279
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2017

2
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:58,890
CRIES AND WHISPERS

3
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,820
<i>It is early Monday morning...</i>

4
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,542
<i>and I am in pain.</i>

5
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,848
<i>My sisters...</i>

6
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,352
<i>and Anna...</i>

7
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:51,195
<i>are taking turns staying up.</i>

8
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,774
Good morning.
Did anything happen?

9
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,652
No, she was quiet... I think.

10
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,575
I fell asleep.

11
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,939
Anna, see to the fire.

12
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,910
I thank thee, dear Lord,
for allowing me

13
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,079
to awaken well and cheerful
this morning

14
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,828
after a good sleep
under thy protection,

15
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,832
and for the enjoyment
of a restful night.

16
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,256
I beseech thee again today
and every day

17
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,264
to let thine angels watch over
and protect my little girl

18
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,016
whom thou
in thy unfathomable wisdom

19
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,350
tookest unto thyself in heaven.

20
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,754
<i>Mother is in my thoughts
nearly every day,</i>

21
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,459
<i>though she's been dead
for over 20 years.</i>

22
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,128
<i>I remember she would often seek</i>

23
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,381
<i>the peace and solitude
of the grounds.</i>

24
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,514
<i>I remember too
how I'd follow her at a distance</i>

25
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,938
<i>and spy on her unnoticed,</i>

26
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,393
<i>because I loved her
to such a jealous extreme.</i>

27
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,357
<i>I loved her because she was
so gentle and beautiful and alive</i>

28
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,817
<i>and so very, very present.</i>

29
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,072
<i>But she could also be
coolly dismissive</i>

30
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,620
<i>or playfully cruel.</i>

31
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,919
<i>Yet I couldn't help
feeling sorry for her,</i>

32
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,628
<i>and now that I'm older,
I understand her much better.</i>

33
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,258
<i>I wish I could see her again
and tell her</i>

34
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,349
<i>that I understand
her boredom, her impatience,</i>

35
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,513
<i>her longing,</i>

36
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,762
<i>and her loneliness.</i>

37
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,571
And when the wicked witch
at last realized

38
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,409
that little Gretel had tricked her,

39
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,497
her nose began to grow and grow...

40
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,917
<i>For Twelfth Night
Mother always gave a party,</i>

41
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,001
<i>and Aunt Olga would come</i>

42
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,747
<i>with her magic lantern
and her fairy tales.</i>

43
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,545
<i>I always felt frightened and left out.</i>

44
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,590
<i>When Mother spoke to me
in her excitable way,</i>

45
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,130
<i>I could hardly understand
what she wanted of me.</i>

46
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,226
<i>Maria and Mother always had
so much to whisper about,</i>

47
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,728
<i>but then they were so alike.</i>

48
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,440
<i>I used to wonderjealously
what they had to laugh at.</i>

49
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,105
<i>Everyone was in high spirits.</i>

50
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,571
<i>I alone could notjoin in the merriment.</i>

51
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,070
<i>I remember another time one autumn...</i>

52
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,493
<i>when I hid behind the curtains</i>

53
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,954
<i>and watched her in secret.</i>

54
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,451
<i>She sat in her white dress
in the red drawing room.</i>

55
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,292
<i>She sat quite still,
her head bent over,</i>

56
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,631
<i>her hands resting on the table.</i>

57
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,000
<i>Suddenly she noticed me</i>

58
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,549
<i>and softly called to me.</i>

59
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,049
<i>I approached hesitantly,</i>

60
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,394
<i>thinking she was going
to criticize me, as usual.</i>

61
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,946
<i>But instead she gave me
a look so full of sorrow</i>

62
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,907
<i>that I nearly burst into tears.</i>

63
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,323
<i>I placed my hand on her cheek...</i>

64
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,667
<i>and for that moment
we were very close.</i>

65
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,699
There's someone out there.

66
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,696
Anna.

67
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,451
There's someone out there.

68
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,551
Good morning, Agnes.

69
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,382
Good morning, Doctor.

70
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,618
She's very tired.
I don't think it will be long now.

71
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,950
I'll find my way out, thank you.

72
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,492
David.

73
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,232
It's been so long.

74
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,573
When can we meet again?

75
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,294
No.

76
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,001
<i>Maria and her husband, Joakim,</i>

77
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,925
<i>had stayed at the manor
some years earlier,</i>

78
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,549
<i>when Agnes had gone to Italy
for her health.</i>

79
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,019
<i>One evening, Anna's little daughter
was taken quite ill,</i>

80
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,024
<i>and Maria sent for the family doctor
from a nearby town.</i>

81
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,067
Say "ah."

82
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,520
Once more.

83
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,817
That hurt a bit, I know.

84
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,493
Good girl.
That wasn't too bad, eh?

85
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,487
Into bed with you now.

86
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,915
Get a little sleep.

87
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,876
- Thank you.
- You must be hungry, Doctor.

88
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,054
There's supper
in the other room, if you'd like.

89
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,260
That would be very nice.

90
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,717
Thank you.

91
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,292
Agnes and Karin are still in Italy.

92
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,915
I got a letter last week.

93
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,376
Agnes is much better.

94
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,586
Her cough is gone.

95
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,468
She's taken up painting again.

96
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,181
Karin's husband joined them at Easter.

97
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,890
The weather's been good,
almost like summer...

98
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,353
though the nights are chilly.

99
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,439
And how's your husband?

100
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,976
Joakim had some business in town.

101
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,353
He'll be back tomorrow.

102
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:13,071
I mentioned you'd be coming
to look in on Anna's little girl.

103
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,620
He sends his best.
- Thank you.

104
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,210
I made up the guest room for you.

105
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,420
The weather's so awful.

106
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,632
You shouldn't be going home
in this weather.

107
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,718
You've changed.
- Really?

108
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,974
Is there someone else?

109
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,594
There's always someone else...

110
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,481
though I never thought
the matter would interest you.

111
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,650
It doesn't.

112
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,544
You wear spectacles now?

113
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,477
Am I bothering you?
- Not at all.

114
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,076
Why are you so reserved?

115
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,707
Couldn't we forget about the past?

116
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,547
Come here, Marie.

117
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,259
Come.

118
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,896
Look in the mirror.

119
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,392
You're beautiful.

120
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,937
Perhaps even more
than when we were together.

121
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,732
But you've changed,

122
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,572
and I want you to see how.

123
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,247
Now your eyes cast
quick, calculating side glances.

124
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,035
You used to look ahead
straightforwardly, openly...

125
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,627
without disguise.

126
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,965
Your mouth has a slightly hungry,
dissatisfied expression.

127
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,711
It used to be so soft.

128
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,265
Your complexion is pale now.

129
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,722
You wear makeup.

130
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,763
Your fine, wide brow

131
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,649
has four lines above each eye now.

132
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,357
You can't see them in this light,

133
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,356
but you can in the bright light of day.

134
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,528
You know what caused those lines?

135
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,026
No.

136
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,198
Indifference.

137
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,407
And this fine contour

138
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,084
from your ear to your chin

139
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,913
is no longer so finely drawn...

140
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,591
the result of too much comfort
and laziness.

141
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,804
And there, by the bridge of your nose.

142
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,638
Why do you sneer so often?

143
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,893
You see that?

144
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,978
You sneer too often.

145
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,061
You see it?

146
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,483
And look under your eyes.

147
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,775
The sharp, scarcely noticeable wrinkles

148
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,149
from your boredom and impatience.

149
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,824
Can you really see all that there?

150
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,447
No, but I feel it when you kiss me.

151
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,495
I think you're joking with me.

152
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,702
I know where you see it.

153
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,499
Where?

154
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,334
In yourself.

155
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,675
Because you and I are so alike.

156
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,798
You mean...

157
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,175
in our selfishness...

158
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,014
coldness...

159
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,050
and indifference?

160
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,273
Your arguments
have always bored me.

161
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,733
Are there no extenuating circumstances
for such as you and I?

162
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,120
I have no need of pardon.

163
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,866
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

164
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,536
Good morning.

165
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,051
Thank you.

166
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,647
<i>Good morning, Joakim.
Welcome home.</i>

167
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,403
Good morning, Maria.

168
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,899
Anna's little girl is quite ill.

169
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,159
The doctor was here last night.

170
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,027
He sends his regards

171
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,827
and hopes you can get together
again for chess soon.

172
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,035
I asked him to stay overnight

173
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,207
because the weather was so bad.

174
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,878
He left early this morning
before anyone was up.

175
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,096
Did you enjoy yourself in town,
or were you terribly busy?

176
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,261
We received an invitation
from the Egermans.

177
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,272
They'd like us to stay
with them at Easter.

178
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,733
I think it would be very nice.

179
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,563
For a change of pace.
What do you think?

180
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,909
We'll see.

181
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,723
Run along and play.

182
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,809
Joakim.

183
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,417
Help me.

184
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,550
Please help me.

185
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,702
No.

186
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,176
Anna.

187
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,523
You hear that?

188
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,485
I hear only the wind

189
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,817
and the ticking of the clocks.

190
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,829
No... it's something else.

191
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,327
I don't hear anything else.

192
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,333
I'm freezing.

193
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,420
Good night.

194
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,024
<i>Come here.</i>

195
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,865
<i>Come to me.</i>

196
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,590
You're so far away.

197
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,507
Come here.

198
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,851
Here by my side.

199
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,992
Do I smell very bad?

200
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,053
It hurts so much.
- I know, Agnes.

201
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,263
I'll stay with you.

202
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,393
It will be all right.
- It hurts so bad.

203
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,736
You needn't be afraid when I'm here.

204
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,487
You know that.

205
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,875
The pillow's so warm.

206
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,416
We can get the other one.

207
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,294
Come.

208
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,880
Can you sit up a bit?

209
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,097
Now lie back.

210
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,478
Is that better?

211
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,402
Is that good?

212
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,989
You're so good to me.

213
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,087
Yes?

214
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,048
What is it?

215
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,344
<i>Agnes is worse.</i>

216
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,112
I think she's unconscious.

217
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,236
Her breathing's very strange.

218
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,613
I'll get my shawl.

219
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,924
Karin.

220
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,929
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Agnes is worse.

221
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,726
<i>I'm coming.</i>

222
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,937
- I'll go for the doctor.
- I'll go with you.

223
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,237
- When's the doctor coming?
- He wasn't home.

224
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,165
You'd better get dressed.
I'll stay with her.

225
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,999
I'm much better now.

226
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,089
Just a bit warm.

227
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,260
How about a little bath
and a clean gown?

228
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,970
Yes, thank you.

229
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,649
I'm a bit thirsty.

230
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,456
Shall I read a bit?

231
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,834
That would be wonderful.

232
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,433
"Chapter 34,

233
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,529
in which Mr. Pickwick thinks
he had better go to Bath,

234
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,363
and goes accordingly.

235
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,697
'But surely, my dear sir, '
said little Perker

236
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,538
as he stood in Mr. Pickwick's apartment
on the morning after the trial,

237
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,657
'surely you don't really mean...

238
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,500
really and seriously now,
and irritation apart...

239
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,041
that you won't pay
these costs and damages?'

240
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,706
'Not one halfpenny, '
said Mr. Pickwick firmly.

241
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,716
'Not one halfpenny.'

242
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,046
'Hoorah for the principle,
as the moneylender said

243
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,173
when he wouldn't renew the bill, '

244
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:44,348
observed Mr. Weller,
who was clearing away breakfast.

245
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,722
'Sam, ' said Mr. Pickwick,
'have the goodness to step downstairs.'

246
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,482
'Certainly, sir, ' replied Mr. Weller,

247
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,729
and acting on Mr. Pickwick's
gentle hint, Sam retired."

248
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,828
Anna!

249
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,850
I can't take it!

250
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,315
Can't anyone help me?

251
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,813
I can't take it!

252
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,982
Help me!

253
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,765
I can't...

254
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,164
God our Father...

255
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,091
in his infinite wisdom,

256
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,596
has called you home to him
still in the bloom of your youth.

257
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,758
In your life he found you worthy

258
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,721
of bearing a long and torturous agony.

259
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,441
You submitted patiently
and without complaint

260
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,149
in the certain knowledge
that your sins would be forgiven

261
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,649
through the death
of your Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.

262
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,242
May your Father in Heaven

263
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,037
have mercy on your soul

264
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,498
when you come before him.

265
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,957
May he let his angels remove from you

266
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,372
the memory of your earthly pain.

267
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,656
Should it be

268
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,869
that you gathered up our suffering
into your poor body...

269
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,828
and should it be that you bore it
with you through death...

270
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,334
and should you meet God

271
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,163
in that other land...

272
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,083
and should he turn
his countenance toward you...

273
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,880
and should you know
the language to speak

274
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,428
so that this God
may hear and understand you...

275
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,519
and should you be allowed
to speak with him...

276
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,351
should all of this be so...

277
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,229
then pray for us.

278
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,103
Agnes, my dear child...

279
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,481
listen to what I tell you now.

280
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,858
Pray for those of us left behind

281
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,535
on this dark and miserable earth

282
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:43,497
beneath a cruel and empty sky.

283
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,622
Lay your suffering at God's feet

284
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,038
and plead with him to pardon us.

285
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,711
Plead with him to free us

286
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,631
of our anxiety...

287
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,883
our weariness...

288
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,381
and our deepest doubts.

289
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,143
Plead with him
to give meaning to our lives.

290
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:11,142
Agnes, you who have long borne
this inscrutable suffering,

291
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,231
you are most surely worthy

292
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,988
of pleading our cause.

293
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,995
She was my confirmation child.

294
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,583
We had many long
and intimate discussions.

295
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,708
Her faith was stronger than mine.

296
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,014
Stop by the parish office tomorrow

297
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,609
and we can discuss
the formalities of the funeral.

298
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,953
<i>Karin and her husband, Fredrik,</i>

299
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:55,412
<i>were pursuing a diplomatic career
some years earlier.</i>

300
00:52:56,006 --> 00:53:00,125
<i>During a visit home, they stayed
for some months at the manor.</i>

301
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,509
Anna, may I have a little more fish?

302
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,190
Will you join me?
- No, thank you.

303
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,218
What are you smiling about?

304
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,716
I'm not smiling.

305
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,728
Would you like coffee,
or will we be retiring?

306
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,267
No coffee, thank you.

307
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,194
It's late.

308
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,651
I suggest we retire now.

309
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:10,361
It's a web of lies, all of it.

310
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,760
Don't look at me.

311
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,478
Don't look at me like that, you hear?

312
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,864
I'm sorry.

313
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,366
Forgive me.

314
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,249
Help me undress.

315
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,174
You may go.

316
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,029
Nothing but a web of lies.

317
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,246
Every bit of it.

318
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,205
A web of lies...

319
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,249
What are you doing?

320
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:43,424
Going through some old letters
and documents about the estate.

321
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,585
Karin...

322
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,463
I want us to be friends.

323
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,804
I want us to talk to each other.

324
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,260
After all, we're sisters.

325
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,020
We share so many memories.

326
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,901
It's so strange how we never touch,

327
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,487
how we only make small talk.

328
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:12,365
Why won't you be my friend?

329
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,827
We've both been happy and unhappy.

330
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:19,711
We could laugh and cry together.

331
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,206
We could talk together
for days and nights on end.

332
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,592
We could hold each other tight.

333
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,847
I sometimes wander
through this childhood home of ours,

334
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,096
where everything
is both strange and familiar...

335
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,474
and I feel like I'm in a dream...

336
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:47,400
and like some event
of great importance lies in store for us.

337
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,574
Yes, I'm shallow and childish.

338
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,909
You've read
and thought and experienced

339
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,332
much more than I have.

340
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,177
Couldn't we use these days

341
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,509
to get to know each other

342
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,719
and really get closer?

343
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,013
I can't bear this distance

344
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,764
and silence.

345
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,522
Did I say something to hurt you?

346
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,440
It's easy to do,

347
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,531
but I swear I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

348
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,019
What are you reading?

349
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:04,061
- Agnes's diary.
- What does it say?

350
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,772
"Thursday, September 30."

351
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,069
It says...

352
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,733
"I've received the most wonderful gift
anyone can receive in this life.

353
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:15,909
It's called many things:

354
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,195
togetherness,

355
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,866
companionship,

356
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,741
affection, tenderness.

357
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,003
I think this is what's called 'grace.'"

358
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,172
No, don't touch me!
Don't come near me!

359
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,754
I can't stand to be touched.

360
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,754
I don't want you to do that.

361
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,548
I don't want you to.

362
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,133
I don't want you to be kind to me.

363
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,685
No!

364
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:18,112
I can't stand it!

365
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,863
It's constant anguish.

366
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,324
It's like being in hell.

367
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,415
I can't breathe.

368
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,617
All the guilt!

369
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,509
No!

370
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,514
Leave me alone.

371
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,059
Don't touch me.

372
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,432
Don't touch me.

373
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,735
<i>I'm sorry I lost control
of myself this morning.</i>

374
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,279
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

375
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,409
<i>I suppose it's all the emotion
around Agnes's death.</i>

376
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:13,379
<i>We were so fond of her.
Now that the funeral is over,</i>

377
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,374
<i>I'll have our lawyer
look after the legal formalities.</i>

378
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,250
<i>The fruit please, Anna.</i>

379
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:21,504
It's best we sell
the house and grounds.

380
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,552
You and I can divide up
all the rest...

381
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,051
furniture, china,

382
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,599
pictures, silverware, and books.

383
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,519
Would you step outside
a moment, Anna?

384
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:43,943
What shall we do about Anna?

385
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:48,781
I suggest we give her
a little extra something and let her go.

386
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,327
We'll give her
some little article of Agnes's too.

387
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,294
She was very devoted.

388
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:57,794
I understand they were quite close.

389
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,798
Now she trails after us
in much too familiar a manner.

390
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,803
I think...

391
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,014
It's true.

392
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,976
I've...

393
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,025
often thought...

394
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,158
of taking my own life.

395
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,032
It's...

396
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,827
It's disgusting.

397
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,497
It's degrading...

398
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,792
and it never ever changes.

399
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:02,029
Henrik's an excellent lawyer,
I assure you.

400
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,700
My husband says I'm clumsy.

401
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,123
He's right.

402
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,417
I'm a fumbler.

403
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:22,708
My hands are too big, you see.

404
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,381
They just won't obey!

405
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,154
You sit there
with that embarrassed smile.

406
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:52,405
This isn't the sort of conversation
you'd imagined having.

407
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,249
Do you realize I hate you?

408
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:02,756
Do you realize how stupid
I find your flirtatiousness

409
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,796
and your insipid smiles?

410
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,975
How have I put up with you
for so long without a word?

411
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,350
I see right through you,

412
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,644
you and your caresses

413
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,984
and your false promises.

414
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,948
Can you conceive how anyone can live

415
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,610
with all the hate I've had to bear?

416
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,204
With no mercy or relief

417
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,782
or help of any kind.

418
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,746
I see it all.

419
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,091
Nothing escapes me, you hear?

420
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,562
Now you hear how it sounds
when the real Karin speaks.

421
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,953
You sit there grinning
your cold little grin.

422
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,746
What are you thinking?

423
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,994
Would you care to tell me?

424
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,085
May I hear madame's opinion?

425
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,882
No! Just as I thought.

426
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,676
You'd rather remain silent.

427
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,467
And you're right!

428
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,091
Forgive me.

429
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,888
Perhaps you mean well.

430
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,605
Perhaps you just want
to know me better.

431
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,232
My dear Maria...

432
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,398
forgive me.

433
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,987
I'm just blabbering.

434
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,699
No, that's not true either.

435
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,954
Maria, look at me.

436
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,497
Maria, look at me.

437
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,058
Can't you hear that?

438
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,686
Someone's crying.

439
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,685
Can't you hear it?

440
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,058
Someone's crying and crying.

441
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:02,292
<i>Are you afraid of me now?</i>

442
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,385
No, I'm not afraid.

443
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,506
<i>I'm dead, you see.</i>

444
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:13,261
<i>The trouble is I can't get to sleep.</i>

445
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,973
<i>I can't leave all of you.</i>

446
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,317
<i>I'm so tired.</i>

447
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,189
<i>Can't anyone help me?</i>

448
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,525
It's just a dream, Agnes.

449
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,323
<i>No, it's not a dream.</i>

450
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,243
<i>Perhaps it's a dream for you,</i>

451
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,367
<i>but not for me.</i>

452
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,921
<i>I want Karin to come here.</i>

453
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,588
Agnes wants Karin

454
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,465
to come in.

455
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,573
Won't you hold my hands
and warm me?

456
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,619
Stay with me until the horror is over.

457
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:16,116
It's so empty all around me.

458
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:32,091
No one would do what you ask.

459
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,684
I'm still alive.

460
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:37,646
I want nothing to do with your death.

461
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,233
Perhaps if I loved you...

462
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,407
but I don't.

463
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,332
What you ask is repulsive.
I'm leaving you now.

464
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,667
In a few hours I'll be gone.

465
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,505
Anna.

466
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,382
Yes.

467
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,855
I want Maria to come.

468
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,117
Agnes wants Maria

469
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,165
to come in.

470
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,506
Don't be afraid.

471
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,878
Please touch me.

472
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:36,388
Come talk to me.

473
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,559
Hold my hands and warm me.

474
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:44,226
You're my sister.
I won't leave you alone.

475
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,731
I feel so incredibly sorry for you.

476
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,401
Remember when we were little

477
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,445
and dusk would fall as we played?

478
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,198
We'd suddenly get scared,

479
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,617
and we'd huddle together

480
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,789
and hold each other tight.

481
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,131
It's just like that now, isn't it?

482
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,592
I can't hear what you're saying.

483
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,595
You have to come closer.

484
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,512
Closer.

485
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,105
Hold my hands.

486
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,172
I'll stay with you.

487
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,428
I'll be here.

488
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,351
Don't cry.

489
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,806
I'm here.

490
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,036
You needn't be afraid any longer.
I'll take care of her.

491
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,830
I have my daughter to think about.

492
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:13,330
She must realize that.
My husband needs me.

493
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,208
It's repulsive, disgusting, senseless!

494
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,342
She's already begun to rot.

495
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,837
She has great foul spots on her hands.

496
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,839
I'll stay with her.

497
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,476
The funeral was tolerable.
No one wept or grew hysterical.

498
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,819
Thank you.
Have you finished packing?

499
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,983
There's one last trunk
to bring down, ma'am.

500
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,777
Hurry. We have little time.

501
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:24,116
The music was nice.

502
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,699
The bishop kept it brief,
thank God.

503
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,119
We're lucky he had a cold
so we could cancel the dinner.

504
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,834
- Shouldn't we do something for Anna?
- Do something?

505
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,919
I don't get your meaning.

506
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,461
She's looked after Agnes
for the last 12 years.

507
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:42,131
Shouldn't we offer her a small sum
or help her find a new place?

508
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:44,512
Out of the question.
She's young and strong.

509
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,632
She's had it very easy.

510
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,929
Her future is not our responsibility.

511
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,348
I did promise
she could take a memento.

512
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,063
- Of her own choosing?
- I think she has that right.

513
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:58,318
I detest that sort of spontaneity,
but a promise is a promise.

514
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,903
We should speak to her right away.

515
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:14,288
Anna, you may stay on here
for a time if need be.

516
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,127
And you were promised

517
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,042
a memento of Agnes's.

518
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:28,180
Thank you. I want nothing at all.

519
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,679
She's trying to act noble,
but she'll get nothing for it.

520
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:38,020
- Stay through the end of the month.
- Yes.

521
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,979
Well, if there's nothing left
to attend to.

522
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:46,199
Let's leave before the roads
to the station are snowed under.

523
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,245
Good-bye, Anna. Thank you.

524
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,203
Thank you.

525
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,172
Thank you for your time here.

526
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,196
Hurry now.

527
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,173
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Of course.

528
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,837
That evening we got closer...

529
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:51,138
have you thought
about what we discussed?

530
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,427
Of course.

531
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:56,185
Could we hold to all our resolutions?

532
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,270
Dearest Karin, why shouldn't we?

533
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,352
I don't know.

534
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,276
It's all so different from that evening.

535
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:07,147
I think we've gotten much closer.

536
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,116
What are you thinking about?

537
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,240
Our conversation.

538
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,162
No, you're not.

539
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,958
I'm thinking how Joakim hates it
if I keep him waiting.

540
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,589
I don't understand
why you suddenly demand

541
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,925
that I account for all my thoughts.

542
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,137
What is it you want?

543
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:37,478
Nothing.

544
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:42,895
In that case, don't be hurt
if I must say good-bye now.

545
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:55,491
You touched me.
Don't you remember that?

546
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,535
I don't recall
every stupid thing I've done,

547
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:02,001
and I won't be made to account for them!

548
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:10,385
Dearest Karin, give the children
my love and keep well.

549
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:13,505
We'll see each other
for Twelfth Night, as usual.

550
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,513
How sad.

551
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:14,858
"Wednesday, the third of September.

552
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:19,787
A chill in the air
tells of autumn's approach,

553
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,911
but the days are still lovely and mild..."

554
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:27,586
<i>My sisters, Karin and Maria,
have come to see me.</i>

555
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,173
<i>It's wonderful to be together again</i>

556
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,384
<i>like in the old days.</i>

557
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:36,216
<i>I'm feeling much better.</i>

558
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,924
<i>We were even able
to take a stroll together.</i>

559
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,927
<i>It was a wonderful experience,</i>

560
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:47,348
<i>especially for me, since I haven't
been outdoors for so long.</i>

561
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:53,108
<i>We suddenly began to laugh
and run toward the old swing</i>

562
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:56,152
<i>that we hadn't used
since we were children.</i>

563
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:59,952
<i>We sat in it
like three good little sisters,</i>

564
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:04,123
<i>and Anna pushed us,
slowly and gently.</i>

565
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,786
<i>All my aches and pains were gone.</i>

566
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:13,629
<i>The people I'm most fond of
in all the world were with me.</i>

567
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,965
<i>I could hear them chatting around me.</i>

568
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:19,840
<i>I could feel the presence of their bodies,</i>

569
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,637
<i>the warmth of their hands.</i>

570
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:26,096
<i>I wanted to cling to that moment,
and I thought...</i>

571
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,648
<i>"Come what may, this is happiness.</i>

572
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,978
<i>I can't wish for anything better.</i>

573
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:38,066
<i>Now, for a few minutes,</i>

574
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,693
<i>I can experience perfection,</i>

575
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:44,076
<i>and I feel profoundly grateful to my life,</i>

576
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,665
<i>which gives me so much."</i>

577
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:51,920
THUS THE CRIES AND WHISPERS
FALL SILENT
