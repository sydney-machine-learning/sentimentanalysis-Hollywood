She has the smile of an anael

00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,288
Fiahts like the devil

20
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,445
The eyes of an anael

21
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,128
Bites like the devil

22
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,799
-The face of an anael
-I say she's the devil

23

Cat, your time has come

As you stand on the brink

37
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:23,085
It's sure makina you think

38
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,365
About your life...

39
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,358
... of sin

40
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,401
How come they're now

41
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,124
Gonna hana you?

42
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:47,048
And how did you beain?

43
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:56,608
Sumpqua!
All out for Sumpqua.

44
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:58,203
All aboard.

45
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:01,082
Catherine, you are on
the threshold of life!

46
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:05,805
You have graduated from my academy
with a first-rate education.

47
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,119
Equipped to deal with
the unhappiness...

48
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,127
...and stupidity on every hand.

49
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,001
Remember: Teach as l taught you!

50
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,879
Oh, that man looks clean, at least.

51
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,968
This man is in my custody, and
l don't want nobody near him.

52
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,084
Don't look at him, Catherine!

53
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,042
Oh, a man of God.

54
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,001
Sir, would you look after her?

55
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,439
All aboard! All aboard!

56
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:43,877
Oh, Catherine!

57
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:46,882
You were a good student.
I know you'll be a good teacher.

58
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,158
I have to go.

59
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,848
Oh, Mrs. Parker!

60
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:54,129
Goodbye, darling.
Be a good girl.

61
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,838
She didn't introduce us.
I'm Catherine Ballou.

62
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,166
I'm drunk as a skunk.

63
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,599
I apologize for being
in this disgusting condition.

64
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:34,040
I assure you, l'll not inflict
myself on you further.

65
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,967
It's the first time in
my life l ever drank.

66
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,366
I took the pledge at
the big temperance meeting...

67
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,242
...in Gratzburg, Montana.
You remember that?

68
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,126
It was a great outpouring
of the spirit...

69
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,047
...and l'll not inflict myself
on you any further.

70
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:57,763
Thank you.

71
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,478
Tennyson.

72
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,523
Spins a good yarn, does he, Tennyson?

73
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,368
He's a great poet!

74
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,518
Poet?

75
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,288
May l?

76
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,723
" l stepped out of the
dark barroom...

77
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,006
...into the street, where the
sun beat down unmerciful...

78
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,838
...and Bent stood a-hollerin',
'Come on out, Kid Shelleen...

79
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:27,725
...l'm gonna blow you clear out of
Tombstone and into hell!"'

80
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,999
Tennyson is a good poet.

81
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:38,842
" Kid Shelleen and the Massacre
at Whiskey Slide."

82
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,683
Ma'am, l apologize for
my disgusting condition.

83
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,962
I assure you, l will not inflict
myself on you any further.

84
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,367
I wish l could do something.

85
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,241
You're very kind...

86
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,917
...but l got here
all the help he'll need.

87
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,884
That's very true.

88
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,364
There's good in the Bible
for these times.

89
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:02,518
Ain't there!

90
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,641
This berth next. If you'll
just step in the aisle.

91
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,327
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Sorry!

92
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:18,565
I reckon l'll never see you no more.
It's been a pleasure knowing you.

93
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,963
Goodbye.

94
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,003
Hallelujah, brother!

95
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,839
I am here to comfort the sinner
and return the stray lamb to the fold.

96
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,722
-Let him who's troubled--
-Got a match?

97
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,603
Go on.

98
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,962
Hallelujah, brother!

99
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,879
I am here to comfort the sinner and
return the stray lamb to the fold.

100
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,365
-Let him who's troubled, let him--
-Thanks.

101
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:04,958
You're welcome.

102
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,046
You was saying?

103
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:11,002
Hallelujah, brother!

104
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,281
I am here to comfort the sinner and....

105
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,521
And all like that.

106
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,202
Now just a minute, pilgrim.

107
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,203
All right. Come on in.

108
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:35,400
My poor fellow, are there any
particular verses you'd like to hear?

109
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:39,287
I told you.
He's about as religious as a hog.

110
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,208
There's bound to be something
in here to help him.

111
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,357
Keep every sheriff easy, move!

112
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,048
Hands over your head!

113
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:58,162
-Sure glad to see you, Uncle Jed.
-Likewise.

114
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,723
Keep him covered now.

115
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,601
Open wide!

116
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,567
All right. Come on now!
Handcuff him to the pipe.

117
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,324
Hit him! Hit him!

118
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,038
Hit him!

119
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,999
Hold him! l'll hit him!

120
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,600
I'll cuff him to the pipe.

121
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,358
Come on!

122
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,164
Let me have a gun!

123
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:46,758
-Didn't you take his?
-Didn't you?

124
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,126
He's gonna blast himself free.
Go ahead, jump!

125
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:54,483
Jump?!

126
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,398
What happened?

127
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,321
-He freed my prisoner.
-Who did?

128
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,963
That Bible-thumper that
was with the girl.

129
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,047
-That young lady in lower five?
-Yeah, that's her!

130
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,198
Please!

131
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,444
Right here.

132
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,446
Hey, you in there. Hey, girl!

133
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:27,358
Come on, miss, wake up! The
sheriff wants to talk to you.

134
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,885
Where'd the parson go?
Did you see him?

135
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,727
And my prisoner?

136
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,319
Maybe he's in the next car.
Come on!

137
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,567
I shouldn't have done that!

138
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,238
Oh, sure you should, honey.

139
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:44,679
No question about it
in my mind at all.

140
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,925
It was morally wrong.

141
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,686
But it happened so fast,
l didn't know what to think.

142
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,405
I was afraid he'd hurt you.

143
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:54,837
That's right!

144
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,121
You know,
he'd have blowed my head off!

145
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,438
What are you doing?

146
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,522
I got a catarrhal condition.

147
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,681
Well, you're too close.
Scoot back.

148
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:11,086
Don't think l was offering
unwelcome advances!

149
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,246
I put women on a pedestal, l do.

150
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:14,398
Further.

151
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:16,968
I'm up against the side.

152
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,399
It's gonna get mighty uncomfortable!

153
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:21,600
You won't be here
long enough for that.

154
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,845
Get out of here
the moment it's safe!

155
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,528
That's what l'm anxious to do!

156
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,562
You think l care to stay
any longer than needed?

157
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,725
There are still people out there.

158
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:35,877
Darn!

159
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,478
I guess l'll just have to stay put then.

160
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,328
Even though it goes
against my very grain.

161
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,878
You take your arm away this second!

162
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,206
I am supposed to be a schoolteacher!

163
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll scream!

164
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:54,443
I was only gonna see
if the coast is clear!

165
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:03,160
There's gents out there with shotguns.

166
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:05,007
What are we going to do?

167
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:08,525
-You can't stay here!
-I hate shotguns, don't you?

168
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,726
I mean, they leave
such an oozy corpse.

169
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,677
But there's one chance
in 1 00 l can make it.

170
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,084
I'll take that chance
for your sake!

171
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:18,927
You a schoolteacher and all.

172
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,357
No, wait!

173
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,280
I'd rather get cut down in the
prime of my young manhood...

174
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:28,606
...than risk compromising
a nice girl like you.

175
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,166
If they get me, though...

176
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,082
...l want you should have
my watch and chain.

177
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,485
Oh, this is awful!

178
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,448
Ain't it though?

179
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:44,042
You get away!

180
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,683
I just gotta watch what's
going on, don't l?

181
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,164
I'll do the watching.
You get away!

182
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,606
I thought you were lying.

183
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,847
You mean l wasn't?

184
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,401
All right, let's get this one.

185
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,000
They're searching the berths.

186
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,800
What's your name
so l can vote for you?

187
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,283
Catherine Ballou.

188
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:15,763
Mine's Clay Boone.

189
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,199
Goodbye, Miss Ballou.

190
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:26,966
Cat Ballou, she lived

191
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:28,966
In Wolf City, Wyomina

192
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,364
And folks here in Wyomina

193
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,606
Live hiah off the hoa

194
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,522
That brand-new firm
Sears and Roebuck

195
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:41,483
Send them their cataloaue

196
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,159
-It's an upriaht town
-Yeah!

197
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,365
-With kind, wonderful people
-Oh?

198
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,400
-Reliable people
-Sure

199
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,601
-Friendly as can be
-So they say

200
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,528
-When they say, "Howdy, " they mean it
-Ha!

201
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,842
-Yep, they're neiahborly
-Yep, yep, yep!

202
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:03,086
If only Cat had behaved

203
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:05,120
These folks would befriend her

204
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,081
If Cat had behaved

205
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,086
Their hearts they would lend her

206
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:11,120
But Cat was depraved

207
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,967
To hell now they'll send her

208
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,798
She could have lived like others do

209
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:18,840
Cat Ballou

210
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,045
Wicked throuah and throuah

211
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:24,958
They'll now be hanaina Cat Ballou

212
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,922
Papa, what happened?

213
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:37,804
-That corral used to be full of horses.
-I got tired of them.

214
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:41,206
I sold them all off to
the Army at Fort Huckaby.

215
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,446
You raised those horses
as much as you raised me.

216
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,198
You haven't painted
the house since l left!

217
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,888
I like it that way...

218
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,517
...gray, weathered
and full of splinters!

219
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:55,718
Papa!

220
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,322
Come on, honey.

221
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:03,717
This is my new bronco buster.

222
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,487
This is my daughter.

223
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:10,245
-Shalom Aleichem, Jackson Two-Bears.
-Why'd you say Shalom Aleichem?

224
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:13,401
I'm full Sioux lndian!
l'm not of the Chosen People.

225
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,281
Be stubborn if you want to.

226
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:17,844
-I ain't stubborn.
-Not much you ain't!

227
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,279
An ex-congressman of
these United States...

228
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:23,083
...said at the
Chautauqua this winter...

229
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,608
...lndians is the Lost Tribe.

230
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:27,243
-But he won't admit it.
-Just ain't true!

231
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,566
He was an ex-congressman
of these United States!

232
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:33,681
-Papa, maybe he was mistaken.
-Why no, he was not!

233
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,564
Jackson's just got a mean,
stubborn streak in him, is all.

234
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,160
I brought Mr. Bernstein, the telegraph
operator, out here last month.

235
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,360
And he stood right here...

236
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,566
...and spoke Hebrew at
Jackson for 1 0 minutes.

237
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,641
And Jackson pretended he
didn't understand a word.

238
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:52,362
Now l call that stubborn!

239
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,321
I didn't understand a word!

240
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,008
You see what l mean?

241
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,841
Now you get that trunk out.
I'll get the satchel.

242
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,158
Jackson, what's happening?

243
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,278
Your old man's got
some roughshod ways.

244
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,519
He's rubbed people the wrong way.

245
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,079
He's a sweet old bear who's harmless!

246
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:20,928
Don't you think l know?

247
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,324
Nobody in this county
would give me a job.

248
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,919
As if l was responsible for
what happened to General Custer.

249
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,649
I swear, l was a little baby
at the time!

250
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:30,998
But your daddy...

251
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,800
...he gave me a job right off.

252
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:36,681
Full wages too.

253
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,763
I guess l respect and admire
him more than anybody.

254
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,563
Then why? This used
to be the best spread.

255
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,566
A big outfit's moving in...

256
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,767
...building factories...

257
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,723
...to make a real city of Wolf City.

258
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:54,081
They want your daddy's water rights.
He won't sell them.

259
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,008
I'll build us lunch
once the trunk's inside.

260
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,518
I'm gonna do the cooking
now that l'm home.

261
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm gonna take care of you.

262
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:12,608
Frankie Ballou?

263
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,848
Beat it, you.

264
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,841
I didn't mean to scream,
but he came outta nowhere!

265
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,962
And that nose!
Who is he, papa?

266
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,204
Give me a hand!

267
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,443
-Papa, who is he?
-Tim Strawn, l'll bet you.

268
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:49,358
You don't know nothing when l say
Shalom, but now you're a know-it-all!

269
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:50,888
Jackson, who is he?

270
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,445
He's a hired killer.
His nose was bit off in a fight.

271
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,598
If l was gonna be scared, l'd be
scared of the one who bit it off!

272
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:03,687
I can take care of myself.
Don't let it bother you.

273
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:06,608
-It don't bother me.
-You've gotta do something.

274
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:09,329
What we're gonna do
is go on living!

275
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,000
We're going to eat,
sleep and work...

276
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:16,407
...and tomorrow we're going to
go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day.

277
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,724
Take care of the horses, Jackson.

278
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,442
Mabel!

279
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:53,968
Well!

280
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,245
Now, there's a game for a sheriff.

281
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,087
Liar's poker!

282
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:03,726
Our unemployed are off the streets,
and the town's safe, all in one stroke.

283
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:05,641
They made Ed Cardigan sheriff.

284
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,524
-He's too lazy to steal and too dumb--
-Ballou!

285
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,321
Show respect for these ladies--

286
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,726
Take off your hat. You're meeting
my daughter, Catherine.

287
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:16,881
Damn, if it ain't little--

288
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,398
Talk to me any way you please...

289
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:22,129
...but this is my daughter,
so watch your language!

290
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,527
Nice to see you back
in Wolf City, Miss Ballou.

291
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,081
You got any idea who forked
a ton of manure down my well?

292
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,643
Well, no.

293
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,760
"Well, no."

294
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,880
You're some sheriff!

295
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,608
Come on, Catherine!

296
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,127
Are you really a sheriff?

297
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,162
Why is it hard to believe?

298
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,765
Why don't you help him?

299
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:50,405
I think someone's poisoned
that water to drive him away.

300
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,407
Yesterday, a man named Strawn
came, threatening--

301
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:57,158
There are ramifications to peace
officing you wouldn't understand.

302
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,685
Now, please believe me.
I'm taking care of it my way.

303
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,761
What ramifications?

304
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:07,488
Don't worry your pretty little head.
Go and have a good time.

305
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,647
Jackson, am l mad!

306
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:17,998
I know.

307
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,439
I saw you talking to Sheriff Cardigan.

308
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,883
Just like Papa, he pats me on the
head and tells me to run along.

309
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,527
What am l gonna do?

310
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,407
They got a gunfighter.

311
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:32,840
You get a gunfighter.

312
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,525
Jackson, there's a funny,
inscrutable look on your face.

313
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:43,519
I can't tell if you're
making fun of me.

314
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:48,600
Nobody would bother your daddy with
Wild Bill or Bat Masterson around.

315
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,082
Come on, Jackson.

316
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:54,722
Come on.

317
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:08,729
-Who could l get?
-Kid Shelleen.

318
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,840
There really is a Kid Shelleen?

319
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,041
He's real and one of the best,
to my way of thinking.

320
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,198
What can l do?

321
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:18,207
Write him a letter.
I'll mail it.

322
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,717
-No call to dance with him.
-No call not to.

323
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,282
He's an lndian!

324
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:35,128
Scream!

325
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,329
I like Jackson.
You'll make trouble for him.

326
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:43,445
Look who's talking about trouble.

327
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,241
-Why are you here?
-Looking for you!

328
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:56,327
-But you're an outlaw.
-Got a price on my head!

329
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,680
Twenty-five dollars for Jed,
$35 for me.

330
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,163
I want to thank you for all
your help to my nephew and l.

331
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:31,918
Where you staying?

332
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:34,927
On the run ma'am.
Hiding out in the crowd.

333
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:38,128
Won't inflict myself
on you any further.

334
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:56,438
-Have you got a gun?
-Sure do!

335
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:58,038
Come home with me.

336
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,365
-Say please!
-Please!

337
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,403
You dance so well.

338
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,169
Simple, to what we learn
on the reservation.

339
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:40,688
Buffalo dance...

340
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,288
...rain dance...

341
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:44,362
...war dance.

342
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:47,999
-Is a square dance like a war dance?
-This one is.

343
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,367
I wanna talk to you, Lo.

344
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:01,400
My name isn't Lo.

345
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:05,008
Wait a minute.

346
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,038
Isn't it?

347
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:09,562
I thought it was " Lo...

348
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,168
...the Poor lndian."

349
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:17,438
It's Custer's Last Stand all over...

350
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,764
...with me in the middle.

351
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,646
Jackson, you all right?!

352
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,238
Shalom!

353
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:33,643
Attagirl, Mabel!

354
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,001
One, two and a right!

355
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,000
Mabel, my 6-foot dove!

356
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,644
My little schoolteacher.

357
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:40,079
I guess we showed them,
huh, kitten?

358
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,245
I got north. You take south.

359
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,449
-Where to?
-Straight ahead, on the sofa.

360
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,087
You think those freeloaders
are gonna stop Strawn?

361
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:05,077
They're gunmen. They got a price
on their head. They told me.

362
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,997
What a fine place, ma'am.

363
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,441
Nice living room.

364
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,762
Kitchen.

365
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:17,527
Back of the house.

366
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:19,838
Bedroom.

367
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,968
You sleep in the barn.

368
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:26,086
Thank you ma'am.
Always deeper in your debt.

369
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:33,408
What a good time l had today.

370
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:17,564
You always pucker before retiring?

371
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,681
Get out of here!
How did you get in here?

372
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:21,998
Why?

373
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,406
If my father saw you,
he'd kill you.

374
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,204
You couldn't wake your father
with a 21 -gun salute!

375
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,643
Let's play spoon.

376
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,960
You are absolutely the most....

377
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,721
Well, l guess l figured wrong.

378
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:45,158
Where you going?

379
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:50,679
To the barn. The horse snores,
but l've slept through worse.

380
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,038
Oh no, don't go.

381
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,325
No! Clay, l gotta talk to you.

382
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,128
We'll talk first.

383
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,324
I can't talk with you
sitting on the bed.

384
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,158
Try.

385
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:15,882
My father's a wonderful man.
Do you realize that?

386
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:17,318
I sure do.

387
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,925
They hate him!
They're trying to drive him out.

388
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:24,007
They put manure in his well,
made him talk to lawyers...

389
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:26,439
...and they sent a gunman
to drive him off.

390
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,198
You're dreaming.

391
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,246
No, he's real.
I saw him!

392
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,358
I'll help you pack.

393
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:36,885
I suppose, to a man like you,
this little farm is just dirt.

394
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:38,681
To him, it's his whole life!

395
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:41,961
Let him dig in and fight like
a man. I'll help you pack.

396
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:44,759
You are absolutely useless.

397
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:48,245
You are absolutely right.

398
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:56,242
Look, why don't you hire
a gunfighter? They got one.

399
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:10,286
You always make that
little...in the mirror?

400
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:24,247
Where you going?

401
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:28,198
-The barn?
-Don't go!

402
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,918
What now?

403
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:36,839
Clay, l don't believe it when you say
you're useless and cynical.

404
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:39,082
Everybody has good in him...

405
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:43,037
...no matter how depraved
and cowardly he thinks he is.

406
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:44,758
You know...

407
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,358
...you are a sugarplum.

408
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:49,927
You better watch out.

409
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:54,839
There are lots who are as depraved
and cowardly as they think they are.

410
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:58,288
And one of them,
one of these days...

411
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,447
...is gonna eat you right up.

412
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:03,558
Evening, ma'am.

413
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:06,607
Air and moonlight sets the
bulls to talking for sure.

414
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:07,758
What do you want?

415
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,278
I wondered if we was
staying the night.

416
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:13,407
I'd take off my boots
before going to sleep.

417
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,520
I helped you before.
Will you help me?

418
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:17,162
Certainly ma'am, anything.

419
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,280
Stay here with us.

420
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:21,599
Somebody's trying to kill my father.

421
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:22,758
Jed....

422
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:26,609
We'll stay, ma'am,
to do what we can.

423
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:28,522
We don't need him then.

424
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,328
I think you do.

425
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,485
My uncle never shot at a man.

426
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,202
It's against his principles.

427
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,358
Is that true?

428
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:38,242
Yes, ma'am, that's true.
Neither has he.

429
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:41,924
But we'll stay and do what we can.

430
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,080
As long as there ain't no trouble.

431
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:38,328
Then there came to town
A aun deadly and friahtenina

432
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:42,920
A aun quicker than liahtenina
Fastest aun you've seen

433
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,517
It was the aun in the hand of

434
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:50,483
Steel-Eyed Kid Shelleen

435
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,126
Just one look at him

436
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:16,519
Had folks startina to booaer

437
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:18,441
Wild, wild as a couaar

438
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,801
Proud and fierce and mean

439
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,642
There was no man who was touaher

440
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:28,042
Touah as Kid Shelleen

441
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,406
He had the eyes of a killer

442
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:49,480
Cold as the devil

443
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:51,401
The look of a killer

444
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:53,366
The look of a devil

445
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,366
The face of a killer

446
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,366
That man was the devil

447
00:34:57,649 --> 00:35:01,005
Just wild and ornery and mean

448
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:03,001
Kid Shelleen

449
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:04,921
Kid Shelleen

450
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:08,646
The fastest aun you've ever seen

451
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,680
Kid Shelleen.

452
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,405
You've had time to sleep it off.

453
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:23,282
Let me see what Cat
laid out 50 bucks for.

454
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,162
-What's holding you up?
-No gun.

455
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,126
All right. Go get it!

456
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,919
I hocked it, l think.
In St. Louis?

457
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,528
You drank up the whole
50 bucks she sent you?

458
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:50,521
Fifty bucks!
Look what you did to him!

459
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:54,688
You could've killed him with
50 bucks of whiskey all at once.

460
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:56,203
Fifty bucks!

461
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:58,604
How was l to know he was a drunk?

462
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,447
Go on and shoot, kid.

463
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,281
Bang away, old fellow.

464
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:34,726
You'd like a drink more than
a sharp stob in your eye.

465
00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:45,720
He did it!
He missed the barn.

466
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:53,642
Sir, if l could just have
a nip to steady my hands.

467
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,487
I had the typhoid real bad.

468
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,886
I had a rough trip down here.
I didn't get no sleep.

469
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:01,125
If l had a little nip, you know....

470
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:02,763
Please!

471
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:13,126
You got the bottle you carry
to make the sheriff mad?

472
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,083
Give him some.

473
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,407
You're an lndian, ain't you?

474
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:38,478
It's all right. I got
nothing against lndians.

475
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:41,243
They was a breed
of men in the Old West!

476
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:44,686
But it's over for them,
like it is for the gunfighter.

477
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:49,007
Except we didn't get no reservation
or get taught how to weave rugs.

478
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,887
See you later, son.

479
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:11,403
It's all over in Dodge.
Tombstone too.

480
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:15,164
Cheyenne, Deadwood, all gone.
All dead and gone.

481
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,684
Last time l come through Tombstone...

482
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:30,326
...big excitement there was the roller
rink they laid out over the OK Corral.

483
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:34,522
I used to work the Buffalo Bill Show
and the Conaress of Rouah Riders.

484
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,085
I've rescued stagecoach riders from
road agents and drunk lndians...

485
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:39,688
...in the nick of time.

486
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:42,119
Twice a day.
Three times on Saturday.

487
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:04,882
Where'd it go?

488
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,680
You see a man with his eyes set...

489
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:16,159
...and his head on a bias
and his teeth like a mule's.

490
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:19,725
He'd as soon hang your guts on
a fence as say, "Good morning."

491
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,287
He's a gunfighter.

492
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,207
Proud and feared of nothing...

493
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,685
...because there ain't nothing
he gotta bow down to.

494
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,962
Every man tips his hat.
Every boy knows his name.

495
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,080
Ain't no place he ain't welcome.

496
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:37,077
When a gunfighter's around,
trouble naturally stays away.

497
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,718
Folks saying, " Hiya, Kid!"

498
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,402
" How you doing, Kid?"

499
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:44,567
" Come in for a pitcher
of milk and gingerbread!"

500
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:48,205
Or, " Come up here and cool
your heels. It's hot outside."

501
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:50,679
Because nobody don't make no fun...

502
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,686
...of a friend of Kid Shelleen.

503
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,881
Miss Ballou!
l am here!

504
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:59,763
I never seen a man get
through a day so fast.

505
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,197
You leave him alone.

506
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:04,924
I ain't running no dude ranch
for misfits and unemployables.

507
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,960
You keep him away from me.

508
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,686
Where you going now, Kid?

509
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:15,081
Why, Miss Ballou,
you paid me $50.

510
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,599
I aim to stay and earn it.

511
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,885
He can sleep in the barn, Jackson.

512
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:27,482
It's my gun.

513
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:37,288
Mr. Shelleen?

514
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,561
Okay if l carry your valise?

515
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:42,040
Why, sure, kid.

516
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:43,968
I ain't got no cash.

517
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:48,003
No need to tip me, sir. It'll be
a pleasure to see you at work.

518
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:56,523
-How many in the opposition?
-Just one. Tim Strawn.

519
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:05,359
Well, waste not want not.
Where's that jug of yours?

520
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:22,447
Strawn. You sure?

521
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,841
Silver nose and all.

522
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:35,769
Let Shelleen do it.

523
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:37,168
Let Shelleen do it.

524
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,206
Shelleen's in no condition--

525
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:40,762
He sure isn't.

526
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,563
Look, l'm counting on
all three of you.

527
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:46,607
Papa's gonna take chances,
and l can't let him.

528
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:49,408
-You gotta stick with him.
-Yes, ma'am.

529
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:50,928
No matter where he goes!

530
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:54,320
All right, you unemployables,
let's get the work done.

531
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:57,921
For the love of Mike!

532
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:01,166
A drunk in the bunkhouse,
and a circus following me!

533
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:02,882
Don't let him out of your sight.

534
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,920
Does Shelleen have tobacco?

535
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:08,166
-He'd set fire to the barn.
-He's sleeping it off.

536
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,882
Do you mind?

537
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:15,839
What do you boys think you're doing?

538
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:18,005
Cat said stick with you,
and stick it is!

539
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:20,165
She's crazy, l tell you!

540
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:24,046
Always has been.
She sees things.

541
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:25,477
Her mother was like that.

542
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:28,362
In the middle of the night,
she seen moon men...

543
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:31,407
...creeping down the walls.

544
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:32,718
Get away!

545
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:36,046
I could trip on you and get
trampled in the crowd.

546
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,279
Why was l cursed in my old age...

547
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:41,327
...with a nutty daughter
and slack-twisted idiots?

548
00:42:41,529 --> 00:42:44,680
Who's here to threaten me?
You see anyone over there?

549
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:46,288
Or there?

550
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,726
Or over that way?

551
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:51,838
You see anybody anywhere?

552
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,768
Now stand back and let me breathe!

553
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,879
Drop the gun belts.

554
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:07,561
You're a murderer!

555
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:08,878
You're gonna hang!

556
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:10,727
What is it?
What's wrong?

557
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:12,044
You killed my father!

558
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:15,204
That can't be.
He's been here all morning.

559
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:16,358
No, l saw him.

560
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:19,840
-He was in that rocker all morning.
-It's a fact.

561
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:22,238
Why do you say that?

562
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,283
Just telling the truth.

563
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:35,885
So that's the way it's gonna be.

564
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,158
Better get outta here.

565
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,962
Get her off of him.
Get her outta here!

566
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:44,999
Just a minute. Don't you do that!

567
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:46,758
Put that gun away!

568
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:54,922
You stop it!

569
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:00,767
You won't make me cry.

570
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:07,800
You'll never make me cry.

571
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:12,367
There are teardrops in her heart

572
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:18,362
But they can't make her cry

573
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,558
There are teardrops in her heart

574
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:28,602
But they can't make her cry

575
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:34,280
She's lost all the kin
That she's known

576
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:39,037
And the tears will turn into stone

577
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:43,879
All the teardrops in her heart

578
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:50,607
'Cause they can't make her cry

579
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:57,960
It's not very hard to arieve

580
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:02,766
When you're a little airl

581
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:08,448
It's not very hard to arieve

582
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,966
When you're a little airl

583
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:19,086
But they made a little airl feel

584
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:23,962
Like a woman made of steel

585
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:31,244
Makes no difference how they try

586
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,602
They'll never...

587
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:39,206
...make her...

588
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:41,844
::: cry

589
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,682
-You're on private property.
-Get out of my way!

590
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:04,600
What have you done to him?

591
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:09,165
-Why is he smiling like that?
-That was hard, little lady.

592
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,405
My father never smiled like that.

593
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:14,169
He'll smile on now, forever,
just as you see him.

594
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:17,123
Free from Wolf City's
Development Corporation.

595
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:21,322
-You rat! Get out!
-Have respect for the dead!

596
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:26,684
We dug a grave behind the barn.

597
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:30,320
We'll stay to make sure
you leave before morning.

598
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,724
All right, you take the ranch.

599
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:36,885
I don't want it, now that he's gone.

600
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,201
But you tell Wolf City...

601
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:42,719
...l'll make Sherman's March
look like a bird walk.

602
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:49,404
Ma'am?

603
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,969
She ain't got no place to go, Clay.

604
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,364
We'll take her with us.

605
00:47:56,529 --> 00:47:58,645
Are you tetched?
We can't take her there.

606
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:01,079
-Where?
-Hole in the Wall.

607
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,518
Hole in the Wall.

608
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:06,085
It's no place for school teaching.

609
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:09,681
Besides, we don't even know
if they'll take us in.

610
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,926
Of course they'll take us.
It's for outlaws, isn't it?

611
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:16,166
You just need a price on your head,
and you've got that!

612
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:17,962
We sure do.

613
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:21,445
It's all settled.
I'm coming with you.

614
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:28,084
I'm loaded for bear.
Let them come.

615
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:31,998
Anybody wanna try on Frankie Ballou,
gotta take Kid Shelleen.

616
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,882
Mr. Shelleen, don't you
see what's going on?

617
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:45,161
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

618
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:47,923
Happy birthday, dear Frankie

619
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:49,881
Happy birthday to you

620
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:57,319
So that mournful day

621
00:48:57,529 --> 00:48:59,565
Became part of a leaend

622
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,839
The real start of a leaend

623
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,848
Known as Cat Ballou

624
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:09,319
They'll never make her cry

625
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:14,689
The day the law filled her heart

626
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:18,447
With a hate that arew

627
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,278
Makes no difference how they try

628
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:24,845
They'll never make her cry

629
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,445
When you have no tears

630
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,680
Then you've aotta have somethina

631
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:31,925
Hate really is somethina

632
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,406
Blood is what you need

633
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:39,440
They'll never make her cry

634
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:45,162
And Cat Ballou made her mind up

635
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,641
To make this country bleed

636
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:51,603
Makes no difference how they try

637
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:54,439
They'll never make her cry

638
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:37,159
I smell a water hole!

639
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:46,318
Hi, honey!
How about a little bubbly?

640
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,247
Later, sister.

641
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:49,923
Bartender!

642
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:52,686
Hello in there!

643
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:54,761
I want a drink!

644
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:56,568
What's all the--

645
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,282
Shelleen!

646
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:04,083
Think of that, Hedda!
lt's Shelleen!

647
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:05,887
Cassidy!

648
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:08,200
What happened to you?

649
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,765
Calvary, Pinkertons....

650
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:12,846
The West has changed.

651
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:15,438
For us, business is lousy.

652
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:19,523
If we didn't have a price on our
heads, we'd get out of this hole.

653
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:23,087
Why don't we have a drink
for old time's sake?

654
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:27,083
"Old time's sake" means you
got no cash. Nothing doing.

655
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:33,082
Hold these for me
till l get some money.

656
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:35,688
Please, Cassidy!

657
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,206
A matched brace of pistols
with carved pearl handles.

658
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:43,118
Sentimental value alone, they're
worth 5 or $600 each.

659
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:45,207
Them ain't pearl-handled.

660
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:47,479
And they ain't your guns.

661
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,289
Anyways, no good no more, Kid.

662
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:52,327
Nobody cares.

663
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:00,123
Well, uncle...

664
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,365
...l guess we'll go
back into business.

665
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:04,719
Remember the Herefords
in Yatrona County?

666
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:06,601
Anybody for buying a round?

667
00:52:06,769 --> 00:52:09,237
You'll need more than just two of us.

668
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:11,442
What about you, Jackson?

669
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:16,040
You being an lndian and all. You just
gonna go back to living off the land?

670
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:20,845
You fooling? You try living in the
mountains with only a stone ax.

671
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:25,446
We'll all amble over to Yatrona
County and help ourselves to...

672
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:29,002
...50 head.

673
00:52:29,169 --> 00:52:31,637
Fifty head! That's big!

674
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:34,409
-I'll drink to that!
-Then it's all settled.

675
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:35,558
Wait a minute!

676
00:52:35,729 --> 00:52:38,243
You got something to say
about our plan?

677
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:39,962
I'm against it.

678
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:44,685
I understand your objection to
rustling, a girl with your upbringing.

679
00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:47,602
-It's the only way to raise money.
-No, it's not!

680
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:52,280
What do you think we ought to do
that's fitting and proper?

681
00:52:52,529 --> 00:52:54,008
Rob a train.

682
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:58,159
That butcher, Eggers,
he'll take 35 head...

683
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:00,166
...and butcher them himself.

684
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:02,280
What about what l said?

685
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:07,281
Look, this is the Wolf City
Tribune of two days ago.

686
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:11,481
"200 workingmen stand
ready for work on Monday...

687
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,283
...on the largest slaughterhouse
outside Chicago."

688
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:16,366
What's that got to do with a train?

689
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:20,323
Workingmen gotta be paid, right?
There's gonna be a payroll coming.

690
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:24,158
-That's maybe 1 000, $2000?
-I will drink to that!

691
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,758
-Can't hold up no train.
-Why not?

692
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,527
-Lots of reasons.
-Name them.

693
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:30,038
We're not robbers.

694
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,843
If you didn't try new things,
there'd be no progress.

695
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:35,199
Look, you're outta your mind!

696
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,320
Squeeze blood outta
them in your dreams!

697
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:38,928
Build your life anew.

698
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:42,758
This studying on revenge is
turning your back on the future...

699
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,085
...and letting the past
eat at your heart.

700
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,200
They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.

701
00:53:47,409 --> 00:53:50,640
We can use Shelleen's own plan
for train robbery.

702
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:52,688
My plan?

703
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:55,288
" Chapter Seven."

704
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:58,402
"The Whiskey Slide and
Tuskegon railroad had a car...

705
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:00,201
...that was bandit-proof.

706
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:02,764
That was a challenge
and a matter of pride...

707
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:06,325
...to see that it was robbed."
And so on and so on.

708
00:54:06,649 --> 00:54:08,287
That plan!

709
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:15,802
All right!

710
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:19,441
You all say you love me
and are beholden to me.

711
00:54:19,649 --> 00:54:21,958
"Take it easy.
We'll take care of you!"

712
00:54:22,129 --> 00:54:26,441
The first time l ask you to do one
thing for me, like rob a train....

713
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:31,206
Listen, Miss Ballou!

714
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,326
Some gang!

715
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:38,078
A horse-ranch lndian, a drunken
gunfighter, a sex maniac...

716
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:39,722
...and an uncle!

717
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:43,680
Now look here....

718
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,758
Clay Boone's gang of chicken rustlers.

719
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:48,647
I'm gonna do it alone!

720
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:50,601
Hey, did we say no?

721
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:53,005
Quit your crying.
We'll do it!

722
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:57,324
-You will?
-This is the last thing. Crazy dame!

723
00:54:57,489 --> 00:54:58,922
That plan?

724
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,559
What in the blue-eyed world?

725
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,602
I'm taking a bath.
What's so odd about that?

726
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:40,481
I'm looking for the baggage car.

727
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:42,600
Well, it's the other way, man!

728
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:46,079
-Pull those drapes! l'm freezing!
-Yes, sir.

729
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,563
Much obliged!

730
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:50,044
More water, more water.

731
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:27,237
Here she comes!

732
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:39,404
Come on, we got a job to do.

733
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:44,762
Do we!

734
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:56,766
My word!

735
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:02,601
Hey, let me outta here!

736
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,682
He's alive!

737
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:06,487
We gotta let him out!

738
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:11,998
What happened?

739
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:13,722
Put up your hands!

740
00:57:15,609 --> 00:57:16,598
Keep them up!

741
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:25,685
Let me in!

742
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:35,118
-Who's in charge?
-I am.

743
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:36,648
What's the delay?

744
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:37,964
It's a train robbery.

745
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:41,041
Get along with it.
I'm trying to take my bath.

746
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:03,641
Here's the safe.

747
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:06,443
Okay, you, open up!

748
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:08,758
Nope.

749
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,288
Come on now! Open it!

750
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,923
-I got a gun.
-You'll just have to use it.

751
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:25,760
-What are we gonna do?
-I told you this could happen.

752
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:30,758
What's wrong?

753
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,127
He won't open the safe.

754
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:34,444
That right, mister?

755
00:58:38,129 --> 00:58:40,597
7 left, 26 right, 1 4 left.

756
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:51,128
This is more than the
$2000 you said.

757
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,964
Nearer 40 or 50,000, l'd say.

758
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:57,958
We take this, they'll
booger us forever!

759
00:58:58,129 --> 00:59:00,518
Who's afraid of a little booger?

760
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:08,686
I give up! Hand me a towel!

761
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:31,280
-Come on, jump.
-Jump?!

762
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:43,163
Let's get outta here!

763
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:47,044
We did it! My little gang
of sweet outlaws!

764
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:49,444
The messenger seemed like a nice man.

765
00:59:49,649 --> 00:59:51,480
Shelleen, it was a great plan!

766
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:54,878
Yeah, we're just like clockwork.

767
00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:56,442
You sure?

768
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,283
I am so proud of you!

769
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:04,923
It's just beginner's luck.
We gotta get moving.

770
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:08,047
-Clay's right.
-Ask him how we'll get outta here.

771
01:00:08,249 --> 01:00:10,126
You escaped in that book, right?

772
01:00:11,329 --> 01:00:14,127
Of course he did!
You darling, Shelleen!

773
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,998
We ride out separately
in case they track us.

774
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:20,201
We'll mix up our trails and
meet at Hole in the Wall.

775
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:21,598
Right!

776
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:26,243
Come on, boy!

777
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,281
Stupid beast!

778
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:51,888
Damn!

779
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:59,404
It took a crafty female brain

780
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:01,679
To staae the holdup of a train

781
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:04,244
She planned it to the last detail

782
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:05,882
Until it couldn't fail

783
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:09,004
This dash and darina desperado

784
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:11,439
Lead her aana with cool bravado

785
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:13,844
They would follow where she lead

786
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,562
They made the country bleed

787
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:35,879
Round and round and round they went

788
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,239
Till man and aal and beast were spent

789
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:40,405
Round and round and round they rode

790
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:42,361
Oh, what an episode!

791
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:47,285
Cassidy, cut your throat!
We robbed old Number Seven.

792
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:48,968
Drinks on the house!

793
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:51,444
Hedda, you old heifer.
We got money!

794
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:55,244
The train guard, hair all over
6-foot-5 of him, praying:

795
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:57,917
" Kid, Kid, please don't kill me!"

796
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:00,479
Everything went slicker than....

797
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:06,964
-Where are those kids?
-Ain't been seen.

798
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:08,602
Will you lend me a bullet?

799
01:03:09,169 --> 01:03:11,729
You remember me? Old....

800
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:13,841
Old....

801
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:22,767
I'm telling you, Cassidy...

802
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,999
...they're coming with the payroll.

803
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,085
It was just like old times.

804
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:32,524
Money, money, money for a rainy day!

805
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:34,884
They are here! Cut your throat!

806
01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:36,841
Help me clear this table.

807
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:40,201
Get it out there.

808
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:44,682
Where you two been together all alone?

809
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:47,409
-Losing that posse.
-Was he bothering you?

810
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:50,800
No siree bob!
His uncle Jed was right on the job.

811
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:53,842
-Old Steel Eyes is jealous!
-You got no respect!

812
01:03:54,049 --> 01:03:56,688
Time was l'd squeeze a pimple like you.

813
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:58,919
What's the matter with you two?

814
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:02,838
Give the old man a drink.

815
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:05,085
There's more where that came from.

816
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:07,685
You mean it? He really did do it?

817
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,800
We did it, Mr. Cassidy.

818
01:04:10,009 --> 01:04:11,965
My gang!

819
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:15,002
It's just the beginning.
We'll wipe out Wolf City!

820
01:04:15,209 --> 01:04:17,200
You help me and l'll make you rich.

821
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:21,685
"Wolf City Development."

822
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:24,837
" Property: H. Percival."

823
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:28,480
-She stole their payroll, Hedda.
-Of course.

824
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:32,364
You ever hear of
Mr. Sir Harry Percival?

825
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:35,925
He owns Wolf City Development,
which owns Wolf City...

826
01:04:36,129 --> 01:04:37,767
...which lets us alone.

827
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:41,962
We don't bother them nor Sir Harry
Percival, and they don't bother us.

828
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,562
Sir Harry Percival.

829
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:47,402
That's the man l should be after.

830
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:49,486
How you gonna find him?

831
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:50,764
You won't help us?

832
01:04:51,089 --> 01:04:52,363
Cut our own throats?

833
01:04:52,529 --> 01:04:54,087
Hole in the Wall's impregnable.

834
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,042
No such thing.

835
01:04:56,249 --> 01:04:58,604
It's more trouble than we're
worth to dig us out.

836
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,322
Now you made it worthwhile!

837
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,681
Some gang of cutthroats
and murderers.

838
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,964
We whispered your names
when we were kids...

839
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:10,399
...scared to say them out loud.

840
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:13,127
How sad.

841
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:17,167
You got old.

842
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,847
Count out the shares.

843
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,199
Give them all drinks on Cat Ballou.

844
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:54,405
Some schoolteacher! Cat's College
of Bust Them in the Nose!

845
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,038
What was that for?

846
01:05:58,609 --> 01:06:00,600
I think we'll go to St. Louis.

847
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,482
St. Louis?

848
01:06:03,729 --> 01:06:05,321
City on the Missouri...

849
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:08,839
...end of the Santa Fe,
jump off of the Oregon Trail.

850
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,926
Produces beef, beer, shoes...

851
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:12,118
...and good times.

852
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:13,278
But why?

853
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:18,045
We got the money. Why wait till
they come looking for it?

854
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:21,008
They're where we want them.
They're desperate!

855
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:22,887
They're desperate?

856
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,361
Let's go to St. Louis.

857
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:40,201
I think l love you.

858
01:06:42,129 --> 01:06:45,041
There you go, all serious
all of a sudden.

859
01:06:45,489 --> 01:06:48,401
You're like all the rest of them,
you gotta be in love.

860
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:50,520
Come on! Don't be so serious!

861
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:53,319
You're nothing like you think you are.

862
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:56,763
How's that?

863
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,880
Cowardy custard.

864
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:02,439
You're selfish and a little stupid.

865
01:07:02,609 --> 01:07:04,839
But you're not cowardly at all.

866
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:06,567
Well, l mean...

867
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:09,886
...when you admire a man,
you just go all out.

868
01:07:10,089 --> 01:07:13,798
Love is not blind. I see
all your faults, and l don't care.

869
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:15,203
I love you anyway!

870
01:07:15,409 --> 01:07:17,843
Love! l was gonna take
you to St. Louis!

871
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:20,483
Just throw our hats in the air.

872
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:21,964
Now l don't know.

873
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,479
Trouble's coming,
and not just from them.

874
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:26,842
Where else do you see it?

875
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,368
Right there...

876
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,204
...in those big blue eyes.

877
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:43,885
Ain't gonna get tied down
with no girl. No, l'm going.

878
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:55,566
You know, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

879
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:56,963
What do you care?

880
01:07:57,169 --> 01:08:00,445
My death's hardly gonna cause
a ripple in St. Louis.

881
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:07,278
I'm leaving.

882
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:17,841
I never promised to be
no hero, did l?

883
01:08:18,249 --> 01:08:20,843
You're no hero,
so don't worry about it.

884
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:23,878
You've no right to think
what you do about me.

885
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:25,642
Why don't you just go?

886
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:28,318
Bye!

887
01:08:41,249 --> 01:08:43,080
What's happening?

888
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:47,243
It's ghost sickness.

889
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:50,845
It's lndian religion, see.

890
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:56,439
We believe what the gods did when
they made a man crazy was...

891
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,128
...make him fall in love.

892
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:01,961
Well, that's very poetic.

893
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:06,920
What's it got to do with us?
Who's in love with who?

894
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:09,287
With "whom."

895
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:14,726
That's another question.

896
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,127
What am l gonna do?

897
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:19,965
Ain't much you can do about us.

898
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:25,084
I reckon l'll see you later, ma'am.

899
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:28,198
What about you?
You'll stay, won't you?

900
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:32,044
I get a kick out of being on
the winning side for a change.

901
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:57,886
Sir Harry wants his money, fast!

902
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:00,840
If you wasn't a girl...

903
01:10:01,249 --> 01:10:03,479
...l'd split you like a chicken.

904
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:09,407
Jed!

905
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:11,243
What do you want, Cat?

906
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:14,719
That man with the silver nose
was here. He's gonna kill me.

907
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:17,277
Strawn!

908
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:25,321
You know that valise of mine?

909
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:28,041
You go find it.

910
01:10:28,249 --> 01:10:30,888
Get a case of cartridges from Cassidy.

911
01:10:36,529 --> 01:10:39,885
We'll always be here with you, ma'am.

912
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:45,005
It'll be all right, Cat.
Everything's gonna be okay.

913
01:10:55,169 --> 01:10:56,761
What's in this?

914
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:51,838
Want a drink?

915
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:54,518
No booze.

916
01:17:40,129 --> 01:17:42,199
Hello, Kid.

917
01:17:43,209 --> 01:17:44,847
Long time.

918
01:17:45,809 --> 01:17:47,640
Sit down.

919
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:52,120
Where you been keeping yourself?

920
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:55,081
You want a job?

921
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:57,403
Some money?

922
01:17:58,769 --> 01:18:01,124
Not money and not a job....

923
01:18:01,329 --> 01:18:02,478
What then?

924
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:08,044
That!

925
01:18:09,969 --> 01:18:13,962
There never was any love
lost between us.

926
01:18:15,809 --> 01:18:16,798
Well?

927
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:23,928
I can't.

928
01:18:24,289 --> 01:18:25,802
Why not?

929
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,724
A gunfight.

930
01:18:46,729 --> 01:18:50,358
Oh, it was just swell!

931
01:18:51,849 --> 01:18:54,283
Just the way l figured it'd be.

932
01:18:54,769 --> 01:18:58,921
Even when we was kids, he'd sneak
behind some kid and back shoot them.

933
01:18:59,129 --> 01:19:00,528
I know this, see.

934
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:03,562
So when l walk in, l gab with him.

935
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:06,488
I figure to call his shot
when l turn my back.

936
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:08,520
He don't even believe it's me.

937
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:12,159
He thinks l'm still on the booze
like last time in Tombstone.

938
01:19:12,369 --> 01:19:14,644
When was that?
Ten or 1 2....

939
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:17,158
How that booze will do your mind!

940
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:20,406
Fog your mind so you can't
remember a darn thing.

941
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:23,963
It was just fine.

942
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:27,529
You and Strawn use to play
when you were children?

943
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:30,286
He was my brother.

944
01:19:33,129 --> 01:19:36,644
It's like that time in Tombstone
when he made me walk...

945
01:19:36,849 --> 01:19:39,807
...stripped down to only
my long-handles and my hat.

946
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:44,484
I took him just like
the dime novel says.

947
01:19:45,649 --> 01:19:47,719
It was just fine.

948
01:19:48,169 --> 01:19:50,125
Kid, your own brother?!

949
01:19:50,409 --> 01:19:53,481
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.

950
01:19:53,929 --> 01:19:56,727
-Old Steel Eyes brought the roof down!
-Hold it!

951
01:19:56,929 --> 01:19:59,159
Half of Wolf City's
on the way up here.

952
01:19:59,369 --> 01:20:01,439
We'll take them like the last time.

953
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:05,608
Now they got 50 of that Englishman's
goons, and more are coming!

954
01:20:05,809 --> 01:20:07,037
Sir Harry Percival!

955
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:09,809
He owns Wolf City Development.
He's here himself!

956
01:20:10,009 --> 01:20:11,408
What do they look like?

957
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:14,649
Are they professional men
or barroom sweeps?

958
01:20:14,849 --> 01:20:16,726
Now you just stop and concentrate...

959
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:18,999
...because you are
scared and confused.

960
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:21,319
Big men!
Dutchmen from Pennsylvania...

961
01:20:21,489 --> 01:20:22,604
...Pols from Chicago...

962
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:24,925
...Swedes from Dakota.
Hard!

963
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:27,245
With Strawn dead, they're
just barroom sweeps.

964
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:30,088
Strawn was just a hired hand.
This is an army!

965
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:31,927
And l'm taking you with me.

966
01:20:32,129 --> 01:20:33,721
Are you sure it's him?

967
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,124
That Englishman wants a fight?

968
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:38,718
We'll give him the
biggest gunfight ever.

969
01:20:38,929 --> 01:20:40,328
He wants to die!

970
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:43,919
I've done everything.
There's no place l want to go back to.

971
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:45,164
It'll be history.

972
01:20:45,809 --> 01:20:48,369
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.

973
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:51,282
You old bag of guts.
You'll get her killed too.

974
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:53,957
It's better than dying
in some dirty hotel.

975
01:20:54,169 --> 01:20:57,957
I always feared dying in the gutter
with a bellyful of booze.

976
01:20:58,169 --> 01:21:00,205
Then Cat came along.

977
01:21:04,409 --> 01:21:07,765
There's still places l want to see
and things l want to do.

978
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:10,567
I don't want to die.

979
01:21:15,929 --> 01:21:19,001
Now you're making sense!
Let's go to St. Louis.

980
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:21,325
You don't ever change, do you?

981
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:24,487
Not St. Louis?
How about Sioux Falls?

982
01:21:24,689 --> 01:21:26,088
Or any place!

983
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:28,803
You afraid someone will
see you with me?

984
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,727
I'll even marry you!

985
01:21:30,889 --> 01:21:31,878
Marry me!

986
01:21:32,089 --> 01:21:33,363
That's what l said.

987
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:35,525
If that's what l gotta
do to save you...

988
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:36,718
...l'll do it!

989
01:21:36,889 --> 01:21:40,325
Of all the self-centered,
egotistical things l ever heard!

990
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:43,327
Why do men think marriage
is the only thing we want?

991
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:46,043
Why don't you go fight
or wash your socks?!

992
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:51,560
I've been studying on it.

993
01:21:52,689 --> 01:21:55,078
And now l'm beginning to see.

994
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:59,245
She loves you. Not me.

995
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:01,408
Come on now, Steel Eyes.

996
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:04,123
And you, all the time laughing at me.

997
01:22:04,649 --> 01:22:07,721
Silly old man looking
after that young thing.

998
01:22:09,449 --> 01:22:12,805
-I'm gonna see you do the right thing.
-Right thing?

999
01:22:17,129 --> 01:22:19,484
Guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs...

1000
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:21,759
...all the same to me.
The same to you?

1001
01:22:21,969 --> 01:22:23,084
What're you saying?

1002
01:22:23,289 --> 01:22:25,849
-Marry her!
-I will, but she don't want me!

1003
01:22:26,049 --> 01:22:27,960
Don't listen to her! Marry her!

1004
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:30,046
I'm telling you, she won't marry me!

1005
01:22:30,689 --> 01:22:32,759
First, you can't stand to get hit.

1006
01:22:32,969 --> 01:22:37,281
But you can take it because the blood
don't matter, and you're gonna live.

1007
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:40,526
It's a great gift l'm giving you,
to know it don't hurt.

1008
01:22:40,809 --> 01:22:41,958
Fight!

1009
01:22:48,529 --> 01:22:51,646
I'm gonna straighten you out
once and for all!

1010
01:22:51,849 --> 01:22:53,965
Leave him alone!
l'm beating up on him.

1011
01:22:54,129 --> 01:22:58,122
He's my kin! His morals have been
a millstone around my neck!

1012
01:23:03,169 --> 01:23:04,522
What was that for?

1013
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:05,917
Everybody else did it.

1014
01:23:06,129 --> 01:23:09,360
I got a right to, without
regard to race, creed or color...

1015
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:11,480
...according to the 1 4th Amendment.

1016
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:15,397
Can l have my store back,
now that she's going?

1017
01:23:19,689 --> 01:23:21,839
It's Cat. Where's she going?

1018
01:23:22,049 --> 01:23:24,483
Sir, a consolation from the town.

1019
01:23:31,249 --> 01:23:34,241
Sir Harry Percival, l presume?

1020
01:23:34,529 --> 01:23:36,360
Really!

1021
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:41,328
Roughing it on the frontier, what?
Delightful!

1022
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:46,999
You like our wide open spaces.

1023
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:52,240
Positively charming, lovely country
and lots of fresh air.

1024
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:55,242
I'm getting frightfully
healthy, you know.

1025
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:59,805
It's just simply gorgeous!

1026
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:02,282
Simply gorgeous.

1027
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:05,561
Don't let anybody ever
tell you different.

1028
01:24:08,489 --> 01:24:10,719
Look at that!
A painting on the ceiling.

1029
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:13,927
Yes, that's a Tintoretto.

1030
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:16,882
-I'll say it is.
-Do you like it?

1031
01:24:17,089 --> 01:24:20,877
I think it's even more gorgeous
than the girl above Paige's bar.

1032
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,967
And that's the most
gorgeous thing l ever saw.

1033
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:31,879
My name's Trixie.

1034
01:24:36,089 --> 01:24:38,125
Oh, Trixie!

1035
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:42,442
May l offer you something
to drink, Trixie?

1036
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:43,758
What would you like?

1037
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:46,039
Bubbly, if you got.

1038
01:24:46,249 --> 01:24:47,887
Champagne, Hansen!

1039
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:52,208
They told me you had a wine cellar,
but l didn't believe it.

1040
01:24:52,569 --> 01:24:56,039
Hardly a cellar.
A bin actually, in the pantry.

1041
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:59,724
I never did see a train
like this before.

1042
01:25:02,329 --> 01:25:06,004
This is the master bedroom.
Do you approve?

1043
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:08,086
Oh, it's swell!

1044
01:25:08,289 --> 01:25:10,849
A regular Tintoretto.

1045
01:25:11,089 --> 01:25:12,886
Do you like the bed?

1046
01:25:13,129 --> 01:25:15,768
Oh, do l like the bed!

1047
01:25:19,729 --> 01:25:21,799
That will be all, tonight.

1048
01:25:23,449 --> 01:25:26,202
A little wine with music.

1049
01:25:28,009 --> 01:25:30,364
Nineteenth century science...

1050
01:25:35,649 --> 01:25:38,686
...Stone Age atmosphere...

1051
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:41,959
...caveman passion!

1052
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:47,758
My wallet is in the top drawer.

1053
01:25:47,969 --> 01:25:49,880
You won't get away with this, Trixie.

1054
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:53,121
My name isn't Trixie, Sir Harry.
It's Catherine.

1055
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:54,842
I'm Frankie Ballou's daughter.

1056
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:58,278
So you're Cat Ballou.

1057
01:25:58,849 --> 01:25:59,838
Sign this.

1058
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:01,758
What is it?

1059
01:26:02,289 --> 01:26:04,519
A confession that you
hired Tim Strawn...

1060
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:08,005
...and are responsible for
my father's murder. Sign it!

1061
01:26:10,169 --> 01:26:12,160
And if l refuse to sign it?

1062
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:14,608
I'll kill you.

1063
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:17,080
Now why do l doubt that?

1064
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:21,327
Don't you doubt it, Sir Harry.

1065
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:22,604
But l do.

1066
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,881
I don't think you have
it in you, Miss Ballou.

1067
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:28,088
Give me that gun.

1068
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:07,405
Well, it's time.

1069
01:27:10,129 --> 01:27:13,007
Come on, don't just dawdle.
Everybody's waiting.

1070
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:14,757
Waiting?

1071
01:27:15,009 --> 01:27:17,284
Looking forward to it, l might say.

1072
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:29,245
I'm sorry they don't like me.

1073
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:32,081
You can't blame them, can you?

1074
01:27:32,369 --> 01:27:36,248
Killing Sir Harry put the kibosh on
the whole slaughterhouse, right?

1075
01:27:36,529 --> 01:27:39,043
No jobs. No payroll.

1076
01:27:39,609 --> 01:27:42,999
You took the bread out of
half the mouths of Wolf City.

1077
01:27:43,889 --> 01:27:46,687
You haven't got any friends.
Ready, reverend?

1078
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:49,005
Hallelujah, brothers!

1079
01:27:49,209 --> 01:27:53,361
I am here to comfort the sinner
and return the stray lamb to the fold.

1080
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:57,323
Let them what's troubled,
what's vexed of mind, take heart.

1081
01:27:57,489 --> 01:28:00,640
There are many good things
in the Bible, sister.

1082
01:28:00,849 --> 01:28:02,441
Indeed there are.

1083
01:28:02,809 --> 01:28:05,881
It's a better world,
we're all bound for.

1084
01:28:06,089 --> 01:28:08,319
Where trouble don't
come around, sister.

1085
01:28:08,529 --> 01:28:10,520
And earthly care is forgotten.

1086
01:28:10,729 --> 01:28:14,608
Green pastures await the tired
sinner, and honey flows like water.

1087
01:28:28,649 --> 01:28:31,561
What a time for you
to fall off the wagon.

1088
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:33,604
Look at your eyes!

1089
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:36,805
What's wrong with my eyes?

1090
01:28:37,169 --> 01:28:38,887
They're red, bloodshot.

1091
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:42,442
You ought to see them from my side.

1092
01:28:43,209 --> 01:28:44,688
We're counting on you.

1093
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:34,442
Quiet, please! Quiet!

1094
01:29:34,609 --> 01:29:36,042
Quiet!

1095
01:29:37,889 --> 01:29:40,357
If you have any last words,
say them now.

1096
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:47,088
Let's get on with it.

1097
01:29:49,329 --> 01:29:52,526
By the authority vested in me,
this hanging will proceed.

1098
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:24,846
Thank you, sheriff.
God bless you!

1099
01:30:25,489 --> 01:30:27,480
Go, Jackson! Go!

1100
01:30:31,489 --> 01:30:32,888
Where's Shelleen?

1101
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,839
So she rode away

1102
01:31:20,049 --> 01:31:21,880
Just where now is a mystery

1103
01:31:22,089 --> 01:31:23,966
But Cat rode into history

1104
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:27,486
And her leaend arew

1105
01:31:27,689 --> 01:31:30,408
She was the queen of the outlaws

1106
01:31:30,609 --> 01:31:33,567
Her Hiahness Cat Ballou

1107
01:31:38,329 --> 01:31:41,605
Well, our story now is throuah

1108
01:31:45,809 --> 01:31:50,564
We'll say farewell to Cat Ballou

1109
01:32:06,329 --> 01:32:07,318
