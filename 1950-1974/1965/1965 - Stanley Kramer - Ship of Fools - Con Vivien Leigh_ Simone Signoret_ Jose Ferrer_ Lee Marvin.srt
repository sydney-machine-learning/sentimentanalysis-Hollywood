1
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:37,996
My name is Karl Glocken, and
this is a ship of fools.

2
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,993
l'm a fool. And you'll meet
more fools as we go along.

3
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,079
This tub is packed with them.

4
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,251
Emancipated ladies. Ball players.

5
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,918
Lovers. Dog lovers.

6
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:55,386
Ladies of joy. Tolerant Jews.

7
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:58,929
Dwarfs. All kinds.

8
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:02,596
And who knows, if you
look closely enough..

9
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,810
..you may even find
yourself on board.

10
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:11,275
Good morning, doctor.

11
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:13,450
Good morning.

12
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,847
l'm glad to get out of Veracruz.

13
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,608
The whole damn country
is ready to explode.

14
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:50,019
Well, did you get a look at them?
Anything interesting?

15
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,279
Anything interesting at all?

16
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,565
There's a dwarf, that high.

17
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:59,320
A couple of young American painters.

18
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:03,743
And a Jewish salesman with an
infectious sense of humor.

19
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,661
Women, Willie. Women.

20
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:10,461
Well, a rather attractive
middle-aged American woman.

21
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,088
But l'm afraid she's too far
from the cradle for you.

22
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:17,464
Those are the kind that can sometime
appreciate what they are getting.

23
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:22,677
There's a Spanish dancing troupe,
interesting, but maybe professional.

24
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,178
They've had those Spanish dance
troupes on board before.

25
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:28,274
And the usual assortment
of our countrywomen.

26
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:31,230
Professors' wives? Saleswomen
putting on airs?

27
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,479
- l'm afraid so. - Governesses?

28
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,858
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- That's all right.

29
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,401
You're really getting off
at Bremerhaven, huh?

30
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,907
lt wasn't a very long career.
Three voyages.

31
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,531
Long enough.

32
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:48,748
l don't know what the hell l'm
going to do without you.

33
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:50,422
You'll manage.

34
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:55,710
You want to know the sentimental,
disgusting truth?

35
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,883
l've become fonder of you than
of most people in my life.

36
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:06,304
We just got used to each
other, that's all.

37
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,397
Who am l to play chess with?
Who am l to talk to?

38
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:15,446
You've seen the kind of characters
we get on this ship.

39
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:20,024
l get a cold shudder every time l
have to go to the captain's table.

40
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,451
l must be in my dotage.

41
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:25,863
After my..

42
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:32,289
l was looking for something.

43
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:35,501
l thought l could learn something
new by being a ship's doctor.

44
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,629
But l've seen all this before. l've
seen all these people before.

45
00:06:41,682 --> 00:06:43,426
Never on a ship, that's all.

46
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,685
Come in.

47
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,558
- Lunch is served, captain.
- Thank you.

48
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:52,984
Please?

49
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:01,400
- What should l tell them this
time? - Tell them anything you like.

50
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,862
Tell them l had to fix the toilets.

51
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:24,258
1933 will be a good year.
l am optimistic.

52
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,304
At any rate, it is starting
out most auspiciously.

53
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:31,477
Ah it is good to be on a German
boat with German people, going home.

54
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:35,646
Say what you will, there is a feeling
when German people get together.

55
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,690
l cannot explain it. 'Gemutliche
Kameraderie..'

56
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,774
..which exists among
no other people.

57
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,776
At least l have found
it nowhere else.

58
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,327
You know what they say in Mexico?

59
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:47,532
Mexicans loathe the Americans,
hate the Spaniards..

60
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:51,372
..distrust the English, admire
the French and love the Germans.

61
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:54,082
That is all very nice. l am glad
that they say those things.

62
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:58,252
But as far as l am concerned,
after a few weeks in Mexico..

63
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,050
..you can keep the Mexicans too.

64
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:04,215
How long has it been since you
have been home, Herr Freytag?

65
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:08,137
- Four months. - You must be
glad to be going home too.

66
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,143
Yes, my wife is there.

67
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,441
Why is it that every charming
man l meet is married?

68
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:16,395
Fraulein Spockenkieker, you
have wounded to me the quick.

69
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,644
Excepting you, Herr Rieber.
l'm sorry.

70
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,320
That little dog is so sweet.

71
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,447
He has shared so much of the
professor's life and mine..

72
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:30,741
..l feel sometimes
he is like our son.

73
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,871
Do you think it's correct to
bring a dog to the table?

74
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,247
Bebe goes with us everywhere.

75
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:43,507
We have taken him to some
of the best restaurants.

76
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,424
Nobody seems to mind.

77
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,304
You know, it's gonna be
a wonderful trip, David.

78
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:58,277
l still feel funny about
you picking up the tab.

79
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:02,109
Look, we weren't gonna
talk about that.

80
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:09,322
Did l ever tell you these have been
the best three months of my life?

81
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:14,538
Did l ever tell you that l care for
you so much it's very upsetting?

82
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,833
What? What's the matter?

83
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:27,298
Twenty-six days in separate beds.

84
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,592
lt's probably a very good thing.

85
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,638
We'll get to know each other.

86
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:38,764
We'll find out whether we have
anything going for us besides sex.

87
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,687
l give you one more time
to hang yourself.

88
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,239
l know you got more
money from the Swede.

89
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:46,399
- l gave you what l got. - The
barman told me different.

90
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:47,737
He is a liar.

91
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:50,579
lf you're holding out on me, l
swear l'll rip your lying tongue out.

92
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:52,537
Rip my guts out. l don't
have any more money.

93
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:03,960
l asked for a table alone.

94
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:07,005
l'm sorry, madame, there is
no room for a table alone.

95
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,011
Please don't bother getting up.

96
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,848
You're an American?

97
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,104
- And my name's Bill Tenny.
- Mary Treadwell.

98
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,569
Yes, madam?

99
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:35,161
l'll have the pate and the
Rheinischer Sauerbraten.

100
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,827
- You, sir? - You got a steak?

101
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,034
- Yes, sir. - Thick?

102
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,505
We will do our best.

103
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,003
l'd better stick to
the simple stuff.

104
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,679
You know l was in Veracruz trying..

105
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,139
..to teach them greasers
how to play the ball.

106
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,133
Man, they tried to poison me.

107
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:55,681
You know, l had the
runs for three weeks.

108
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,723
How interesting.

109
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,649
l'd like to hear more about it.

110
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,443
Herr Rieber, l hear that you
publish a national magazine..

111
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,858
..with certain intellectual
features.

112
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:15,329
A garment trade magazine,
but modern. Modern.

113
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:18,451
Good afternoon. l'm Willie
Schumann, the ship's doctor.

114
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,167
The captain sends his regrets.

115
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:23,123
He's unable to come to lunch,
because of ship's business.

116
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,337
Doctor, l am Siegfried Rieber.

117
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:27,298
This is Professor Hutten,
Frau Hutten.

118
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:30,090
- Please. - No, no allow me.
And their dog, Bebe.

119
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,837
This charming young lady is
Fraulein Spockenkieker.

120
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:36,930
Herr Freytag, Frau Schmitt, Herr
Graf and his nephew Johann.

121
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,308
Please don't let me interrupt
your conversations.

122
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:41,722
We were just discussing
Herr Rieber's magazine.

123
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:44,307
Yes l have invited talented writers
from all over the nation..

124
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,311
..to contribute on one topic:

125
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:49,191
How we can expunge foreign
influences..

126
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,986
..and restore Germany to
its national greatness.

127
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,985
What foreign influences?

128
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,793
lf you need any attendance,
l'll be at your disposal.

129
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:08,998
Thank you.

130
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:13,885
On my part, doctor, you need
have no concern for me.

131
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:17,888
l do not believe in
'materia medica.'

132
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,352
Really?

133
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,470
Have you found something
better to replace it?

134
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:26,727
- Faith. - Faith. l see. Very well.

135
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:32,021
A toast. A toast to the German
woman, the most beautiful in the world.

136
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,572
- Delicious. - Herr Rieber.

137
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,084
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

138
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,972
- Karl Glocken. - Julius Lowenthal.

139
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:58,802
The herring is very good.

140
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,562
l'll have that and a couple
of hard-boiled eggs.

141
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,486
l beg your pardon.

142
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,522
You aren't Jewish, are you?

143
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,861
No. l have my own minority group.

144
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:21,659
They usually give a Jew a table
of his own on a boat like this.

145
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,789
Why do you think they
put us together?

146
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:26,161
lt's their way of being friendly.

147
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,495
Perhaps they thought
we might hit it off.

148
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:39,967
You are sure you are not Jewish?

149
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:43,555
Reasonably sure.

150
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,768
You resemble a brother-in-law
of mine in Stuttgart.

151
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,276
That's the way it is.

152
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,147
People are always mistaking
me for someone else.

153
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,397
- Spot of wine? - Just a touch.

154
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:32,028
My God. Where are we
going to put them?

155
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,862
We'll have to manage.

156
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,979
Professor, what is it?

157
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:10,598
What's happening? Who
are all those people?

158
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,064
There's nothing to be concerned
about Frau Schmitt.

159
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:16,853
- l have spoken to one of the
officials. - But what is it?

160
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:20,530
lt has to do with the price
of sugar on the world market.

161
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,527
- Sugar? - Yeah. You see..

162
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,372
..the sugar planters have been
unable to get their price..

163
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,832
..so they burned their crops..

164
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,621
..in the fields rather than
let the prices go down.

165
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:33,704
Something had to be done about
the Spanish laborers..

166
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:37,625
..so the Cuban government hit upon
a humanitarian plan of action.

167
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:39,296
They're sending them home.

168
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,340
- How do you feel? - 'Bien.'

169
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:09,928
Good.

170
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,555
l come to see you later, yes?

171
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,601
Please put her there in the corner.

172
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,079
- Where can they wash?
-There are two spigots.

173
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:37,170
- What?! - lt is not my fault.

174
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,212
Stop talking to me in this way.

175
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:41,375
You just don't put 600 people..

176
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:43,709
..on a deck like this with
only two outlets to wash!

177
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:44,882
You don't know them.

178
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:47,177
They wouldn't wash if they could.
You don't know what pigs they are.

179
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,471
The deck has to be cleaned.
Bring the hoses out.

180
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,183
- The hoses? - Bring the
hoses out, l said!

181
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,763
l cannot turn hoses on them.

182
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,312
lt's better to turn
the hoses on them..

183
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,939
..than for them to
live this way, no?

184
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,438
- Break out the hoses.
- Turn on those hoses.

185
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:21,311
l take it you are not
exactly pleased..

186
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,938
..that we are cabin
mates on this voyage.

187
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:27,064
l have already requested a change
in the accommodations.

188
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,735
You may take it from me..

189
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,909
..that l'm not exactly overwhelmed
with the prospect either.

190
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:34,569
However, pending changes..

191
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,914
..since we are captives of each
other's company for 26 days..

192
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,204
..l think it is best if we
reach an understanding.

193
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:45,211
Our cosmetics, for instance..

194
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,629
..l will keep mine on
this side of the sink.

195
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,967
And you keep yours on that
side. That's right?

196
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:59,261
Which bunk do you prefer?
The lower or the upper?

197
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,434
l was assured the lower.

198
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,527
lt is yours.

199
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,238
What are your habits?

200
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,360
l, myself, rise very
early in the morning.

201
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:16,993
l take it that if this evening is
an example, you are a late bird.

202
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:20,992
lf you sleep late, l will see
that l do not disturb you.

203
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:28,297
And l hope you, in turn, will try
your best not to disturb me.

204
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,682
One other thing.

205
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,598
One other thing.

206
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:47,228
My wife has informed me in the most
sarcastic terms possible..

207
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,981
..l snore.

208
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,398
Good night.

209
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:55,910
- You a painter, huh? - Yeah.

210
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:59,245
- What was you doing in Mexico?
- l was a timekeeper in a mine.

211
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,874
l thought you said
you was a painter.

212
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,200
l am a painter, but l was
a timekeeper in a mine.

213
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:06,628
- Why? - To support
myself as a painter.

214
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:09,039
- What's the matter? Don't you
make any money painting? - No.

215
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:12,383
Oh now, wait a minute.
Come on. Wait a minute.

216
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,337
You mean to tell me you work at
something you can't make a living off..

217
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:18,425
..so you gotta take a job
to make enough money..

218
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,759
..to go on working at
work you can't live on?

219
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,762
But that is the heroic life.

220
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:27,482
That is the way men who trust
themselves can afford to live.

221
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:30,524
- A strange neck of the woods.
- What do you mean?

222
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,321
Strange neck of the woods.

223
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:35,189
Look, l run into all kinds
of people, you know, but..

224
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,068
Did l tell you what happened
to a guy in Veracruz..

225
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,621
..when l was coming
through immigration?

226
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:42,078
Well l'm standing in line see.
So l see this clerk..

227
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,159
..and l holler, Hey, Pancho,
get over here.

228
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:45,532
Just being friendly-like..

229
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:48,037
..like back home you call
a taxi driver Mac

230
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:49,791
..or a Pullman porter George.

231
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,881
Well this little Negro..
You know these coast..

232
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,877
..Mexicans got mostly Negro
blood in them, l'm told.

233
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,046
Well, he just looks
up and stares at me.

234
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,392
The next thing l know, everybody's
going ahead of me in this line.

235
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:04,386
Then l realize that this
little Negro resented it.

236
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:09,520
- l think l'll turn in. - Me too.

237
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,868
Come in.

238
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,916
- Good evening. - Good evening.

239
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:31,498
l'm the doctor. You
wanted to see me?

240
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:35,256
Yes. l need something
to help me sleep.

241
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:36,969
- Are you ill? - No, no.

242
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:39,047
l just want something
to help me sleep.

243
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:43,100
- Do you often have trouble
sleeping? - Yes. Always.

244
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,512
- Does your doctor help you to
sleep? - Yes. Occasionally.

245
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,275
Take off your robe.

246
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:54,773
- You're sure you're the ship's
doctor? - Oh l am the ship's doctor.

247
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:04,534
Lean forward, please.

248
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:11,666
- What is it? - Your hands are cold.

249
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,131
l'm sorry.

250
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:20,670
Breathe deeply.

251
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,189
When was your period?

252
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,936
- Look, is it necessary to..?
- Yes, it is necessary.

253
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:35,811
All right. Last week.

254
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:40,569
l'm sure you'd never have
any trouble sleeping.

255
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,071
No, never.

256
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,496
Tell me your secret.

257
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,373
A clear conscience, of course.

258
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:54,581
That's a neat trick, having
a clear conscience..

259
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,583
..when you work as
a doctor on a ship..

260
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:59,961
..which has 600 people
living on an open deck.

261
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:03,805
You know, you just can't take pills
every time you can't sleep..

262
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,509
..or anytime you want to be stimulated
or sedated. lt has its effect.

263
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:11,183
What are you laughing at?

264
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:18,188
My house has been burned. They've
taken everything l had.

265
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:23,407
Now l'm being taken to prison, to
an island l know nothing about.

266
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:26,910
And you're giving me a
Sunday school sermon.

267
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,582
- You can put your robe
back on now. - Thank you.

268
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,793
You've got a gentle touch.

269
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:42,881
Maybe you're not as stuffy
as you pretend to be.

270
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,757
No. l hope not.

271
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:51,218
You gonna help me?

272
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:55,522
Your doctor may have
helped you too often.

273
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,316
l'm very helpless at this moment.

274
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,859
You can leave me without any help.

275
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:07,487
That's your prerogative.

276
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:21,800
This is for tonight only.

277
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,890
- How old are you? - l'm old
enough, as you can see.

278
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:30,512
Much too old.

279
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,052
- Forty-five? - Not that old.

280
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,307
- How old are you? - Forty-two.

281
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:44,492
- How old are you? - Forty-one.

282
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:47,525
- You're joking. - Thank you.

283
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,034
Lie back, please.

284
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,251
You will feel it in a moment.

285
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,754
- Yes. - Talk.

286
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:09,558
- l beg your pardon? - Talk
until the drug takes effect.

287
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:17,436
This boat smells of cabbage.

288
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:23,690
Why does every German
boat smell of cabbage?

289
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,192
Keep talking.

290
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,526
What do you want me to talk about?

291
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:31,654
Anything you like. Just talk.

292
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,336
What's your name?

293
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:41,749
- Schumann. - No. Your first name.

294
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,874
Wilhelm.

295
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:50,093
Wilhelm.

296
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:53,847
Wilhelm.

297
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,016
lt's perfect.

298
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,601
Perfect.

299
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:20,956
Stop that now!

300
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:28,338
- Have you made this trip before?
-Oh l make it at least twice a year.

301
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,716
- Are you in some sort of business?
- l'm in the jewelry business.

302
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,643
A special part. l sell
religious trinkets.

303
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:38,061
Any religion. You name it, l got it.

304
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:41,516
l sell neck chains, bracelets,
anklets.

305
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:42,854
lt sounds like good business.

306
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:44,486
lt's a very good business.

307
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,441
People feel better when
they wear these things.

308
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,730
l feel good too.

309
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:52,822
With all this stuff on me, l feel
like an African l met in Paris.

310
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:58,037
He bought from me a crucifix,
Buddha and mezuzah. All on one chain.

311
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,952
Do you know what he said?

312
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:04,458
He said, lt may not help,
but it can't hurt.

313
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:07,248
You seem to get along
very well with people.

314
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:08,624
Oh l like people.

315
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:12,135
lf you look for it, you can find
something good in anybody.

316
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,132
lt must be difficult sometimes.

317
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,472
For instance, doesn't it bother you
that you and that little man..

318
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,766
..are the only two Germans who
aren't at the captain's table?

319
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:30,112
Do you think that bothers me?
Besides, l like that little man.

320
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:33,071
What kind of a salesman do
you think l would be..

321
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,568
..if l couldn't deal with
a situation like that?

322
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,864
A salesman is supposed
to deal with..

323
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,414
..a difficult situation
and overcome it.

324
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,118
Listen. lt's not a new story.

325
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:48,168
White men hate black men.
Moslems hate Buddhists.

326
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,758
That's the way it goes. There's
prejudice everywhere.

327
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,839
lt does no good to give it back.

328
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:57,298
You have got to use your noggin.

329
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,195
There now, you must not mind
not winning against me.

330
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,161
After all, l was Ping-Pong champion
of the Sportsverein in Frankfurt..

331
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:24,161
..three times over.
- Morning.

332
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:25,795
- Morning. - Morning.

333
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,791
Herr Freytag picks some
bizarre company.

334
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,256
Ja, l suspect they are
birds of a feather.

335
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:33,803
Well, shall we play again?

336
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,881
Or perhaps l might suggest
another game.

337
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:38,927
- What game? - Any game.
One which you might win.

338
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,260
- What game do you mean?
- You have no idea?

339
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:43,430
l will not let you talk
that way to me.

340
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:46,649
- l'm sorry. - How dare you!

341
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,109
l could not resist.

342
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,229
l couldn't resist either.

343
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:56,025
What do your parents feel
about you going to Europe?

344
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,656
My mother's thrilled. lt's
something she's always wanted to do.

345
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:02,033
l think my father gave me up
for lost a long time ago.

346
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,119
- What do your parents do?
- My father owns a store.

347
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,956
lt's a good store.
A furniture store.

348
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,083
My mother's never been
satisfied with it.

349
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:16,050
She taught me that a woman had..

350
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:17,846
..to have something of her very
own outside of her husband..

351
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:21,348
..otherwise, it was bridge games
and one day a week at the hospital.

352
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:24,802
What about that young man
you're traveling with?

353
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:28,350
David. David's an artist.
A wonderful one.

354
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:32,438
He's a bit caught up with social
consciousness right now..

355
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,941
..but he'll get over that.

356
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,859
ls it serious?

357
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:40,200
l never felt about anybody
the way l do about David.

358
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:43,787
l think that David thinks a woman..

359
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,959
..should follow three paces
behind with slippers.

360
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,581
Men usually do.

361
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:53,672
My husband certainly did. No, thank
you. l have a whiskey sour.

362
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:56,963
- What did your husband do?
-He was in the diplomatic corps.

363
00:30:57,472 --> 00:31:00,591
Oh.. we put up a wonderful
front in public.

364
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:03,055
We were everybody's favorite couple.

365
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,677
ln private, it was something
else again.

366
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,393
He was jealous of me.

367
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:12,684
He was so jealous of
me that he hit me.

368
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,729
He hit me till l bled at the nose.

369
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,738
l was wondering whether
David would beat me.

370
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:22,947
We quarrel sometimes.

371
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,373
lt seems to come out of nothing..

372
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,412
.. and then it grows into such
ugliness and bitterness.

373
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,163
lt surprises both of us.

374
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,048
l guess a relationship
between a man..

375
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:36,209
..and a woman is very difficult
these days, isn't it?

376
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,881
Practically impossible.

377
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,808
Put on your beret, Carlos.

378
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,522
Now we can hang in The Prado.

379
00:31:57,698 --> 00:32:01,364
We will hang somewhere, Carlos.
The place is uncertain.

380
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:08,748
- That's enough for today.
Thank you. - Anytime.

381
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,131
l just can't tell you
how much l admire you.

382
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,435
Why?

383
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:28,884
You create.

384
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,139
l'm not even sure about that.

385
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,474
l've never been given a
penny for any of this.

386
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:37,645
Still, l envy you. l envy
you your struggle.

387
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:41,197
l envy you your doubts
and floundering, even.

388
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,613
And Fraulein Brown.
l envy you that too.

389
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,365
She's an attractive girl, isn't she?

390
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:50,534
Are you two going to be married?

391
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,882
l am sorry. l don't mean to pry.

392
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:06,595
You know, the distasteful curiosity
of the non participant.

393
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,556
That's all right. l don't honestly
know whether we'll get married.

394
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:14,436
l told you how uncertain my life is.

395
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:16,934
Look l need all the help l can get.

396
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:20,770
l need someone who can believe in a
man who hasn't proved himself yet.

397
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:23,902
Someone to be there. Be for me.

398
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,069
Couldn't Fraulein Brown be that?

399
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:29,113
Fraulein Brown is a modern woman.

400
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,492
Their needs are a lot more
complicated than our mothers' were.

401
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:37,708
l'm crazy about Jenny. l really am.

402
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,250
l.. l've never felt this way about
anybody, the way l feel about her.

403
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:45,090
l guess l'm afraid to find out
how apart we really might be.

404
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,098
l see.

405
00:33:49,018 --> 00:33:53,182
l see, l suppose one of the saddest
things in the world must be..

406
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:57,521
..to see two people who feel
so much for each other..

407
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,861
..and who feel that they
belong together..

408
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:03,782
..and yet they really don't
belong together at all.

409
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,581
- Hello. - Hello.

410
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:22,874
What are you doing?

411
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,755
l'm making one of these.

412
00:34:31,144 --> 00:34:34,180
- How many of these
do you have? - Many.

413
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:38,977
Here is a bull.

414
00:34:40,486 --> 00:34:41,945
A dog.

415
00:34:49,328 --> 00:34:52,947
Do you think anyone in first class
would be interested to buy them?

416
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,078
l would.

417
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,632
Good morning.

418
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:16,432
Good morning.

419
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:20,934
- How long have you been here?
- About a half an hour.

420
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,143
No, no, don't get up. Lie back.

421
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:26,156
Did you put this over me?

422
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,818
Of course.

423
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,486
l'm glad to see you are on deck.

424
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:35,457
lt was a wonderful drug you
gave me, whatever it was.

425
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,331
What was it, incidentally?

426
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,204
You don't expect me
to tell you, do you?

427
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,713
Oh you can actually laugh.

428
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:47,795
Did l startle you very much?

429
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,174
lt's good to hear you laugh too.

430
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,603
Did you ever have all
the worst possible..

431
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,224
..things that can happen
to you happen?

432
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,974
Well, it gives you the most
irresponsible feeling.

433
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,985
Nothing more can happen.

434
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:13,781
Hey!

435
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:15,367
Are you all right?

436
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,794
lt takes a great deal of courage
to tangle with those two.

437
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,537
l have a certain security with them.

438
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,420
They are the only characters on
the boat smaller than l am.

439
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:35,053
Such a charming lady makes a
charming morning even more charming.

440
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:36,726
Thank you.

441
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,938
He's wonderful.

442
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:43,306
He certainly is.

443
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:46,268
The one thing about
these children..

444
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:50,360
..they seem to have a better
time than anyone on the boat.

445
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:52,692
lf you expect me to speak
a word in defense..

446
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:54,612
..of those two little monsters,
you're much mistaken.

447
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:58,155
My prescription for them is to throw
them overboard in a leaky lifeboat.

448
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,825
You didn't have a childhood at all?

449
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,957
Nothing like theirs.
At least, l hope not.

450
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:11,050
Well.. when l was 4, l persuaded my
little brother to drink lye water.

451
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:14,173
- Lye water? - Yeah, l
told him it was milk.

452
00:37:14,348 --> 00:37:18,512
So he went to screaming about the
house. His mouth was scrubbed out.

453
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,054
l was beaten black-and-blue.
l meant him no harm.

454
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:25,813
l was only curious to know
whether it would kill him.

455
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,445
And what about your childhood?

456
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:33,441
Did nothing gay ever
happen to you at all?

457
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:35,452
No.

458
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:37,944
l was the perfect dupe.

459
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,744
l believed anything
anybody ever told me.

460
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:45,958
l was full of the highest hopes and
the most unbelievable innocence.

461
00:37:46,672 --> 00:37:49,342
However it's true, at the age of 12

462
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:51,501
..l did have an experience
with the housekeeper..

463
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:53,883
..that left an indelible
impression on me..

464
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,008
..shocked my mother no end and
cost the poor girl her job.

465
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,800
Well, there is hope
for you after all.

466
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:05,934
Oh.. the toreros are having
a fiesta tonight.

467
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:07,769
- l know. - Are you coming?

468
00:38:08,027 --> 00:38:09,652
l wasn't planning to.

469
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:13,153
l thought we might have
a dance if you did.

470
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,237
Of course, you probably don't dance.

471
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:21,326
- Exactly how dull do you
think l am? - You are dull.

472
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,119
You're dull..

473
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,490
..stolid..

474
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,247
..unimaginative..

475
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,952
..helpless..

476
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,715
..and charming.

477
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:34,631
Yes, charming.

478
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:41,053
Oh you're blushing.

479
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,305
That's the most charming thing l've
ever seen in my whole life.

480
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,433
l've never seen a man blush before.

481
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:52,773
l'm not blushing. l must
have a temperature.

482
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:59,905
Well anyway, l'll wear my..
my only dress..

483
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:05,122
..and l'll give you the choice
of any dance you like.

484
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,456
And l have a feeling it's
gonna be a slow waltz.

485
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,631
l happen to excel in the flamenco.

486
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,753
l was an intellectual.

487
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:19,716
l was a philosopher and
teacher of philosophy.

488
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:22,927
Until three years ago, l learned
l was going to die.

489
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,010
Then my wisdom dropped from
me like soiled rags.

490
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,811
l was naked as the day l was born.

491
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:31,610
l heard a voice.

492
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:35,608
The most loving voice l've ever
heard. The voice of God!

493
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:37,442
And God said to me..

494
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:41,365
God speaks to him. He speaks
to him personally.

495
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:44,028
Be quiet, Gregorio! You have
to spit on everything.

496
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:47,788
l asked myself, why was l afraid?

497
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:50,119
What are my personal sufferings..

498
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:54,293
..but a divine grace that can
be made useful to others?

499
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,625
- The miracle is.. - Miracle?

500
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,969
What miracle? Can you
make us a miracle?

501
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:01,598
Can you get us out
of this slop and..

502
00:40:01,682 --> 00:40:03,722
..into the upper decks, where
we a man can breathe?

503
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,810
- That is a miracle.
-You blasphemous pig!

504
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:10,894
You are the pig. We are all pigs.
Look at the way we live!

505
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,350
Listen! Listen to me!

506
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,983
- God's mercy is in.. - God?

507
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,861
There is no God down here!

508
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:23,327
Do you know what l would
do if God were here?

509
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:26,866
l would curse him to his face.
- Yeah!

510
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,246
l would spit in his face!
- Yeah!

511
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,624
l would send him down into
his own hell! - Yeah!

512
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,457
- Get him out of here! - Yeah!

513
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:36,956
Wait! Wait! You can't!

514
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:16,583
The hoses. And give them more
than a bath this time.

515
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,252
Yes, sir. The hoses!

516
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:46,797
- A toast to 'el capitan.'
- A toast to 'el capitan'!

517
00:44:48,177 --> 00:44:52,424
'El Capitan', with the hope that
this beautiful occasion..

518
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:55,136
..may serve to bring those
two great countries..

519
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,799
..Spain and Germany,
closer together.

520
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:02,438
The Spanish heritage, the German
empire in all its glory.

521
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:04,683
- 'El Capitan', - 'El Capitan',

522
00:45:05,111 --> 00:45:06,605
Good God.

523
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,244
Looking for someone?

524
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:22,575
What do you mean?

525
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,791
Dr. Schumann is a very
charming man, isn't he?

526
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:29,795
He's in steerage.

527
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:36,384
People say there are
only three reasons..

528
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:38,552
..why a man would
be a ship's doctor:

529
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,057
He wants to travel. Or
his health is not good.

530
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:44,224
Or he's escaping from the law.

531
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,818
Which is it with Dr. Schumann?

532
00:45:48,988 --> 00:45:52,902
Dr. Schumann has a quite serious
case of heart trouble.

533
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,319
Will you excuse me?

534
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:20,722
- What is your name?
- My name is Johann.

535
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,269
Why were you staring at me, Johann?

536
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:29,474
- How is your father?
- He's my uncle.

537
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:31,820
He's sleeping in the cabin.

538
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:34,356
The doctor gave him something
to quiet him down.

539
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,817
- Dance with me. - l don't dance.

540
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:40,455
l will show you.

541
00:47:01,978 --> 00:47:03,472
Do you feel that?

542
00:47:04,439 --> 00:47:06,846
Only Spanish women move like that.

543
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,976
lt is called the 'meneo.'

544
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,438
Feel?

545
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,577
l am not a gypsy, you know.

546
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:22,575
l am real Spanish, and
this is the sign.

547
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:25,376
- You're doing it on purpose.
- Oh, no.

548
00:47:27,462 --> 00:47:29,086
l was born this way.

549
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,878
Do you hear what they say?

550
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:39,388
My hip bones.

551
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:44,803
They say, 'Meneo..'

552
00:47:46,814 --> 00:47:48,558
.. 'meneo'..

553
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,436
..all by themselves.

554
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:57,067
- Will you buy me a bottle
of champagne? - l can't.

555
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:59,694
Just a small bottle.

556
00:47:59,786 --> 00:48:02,455
l don't have anything.
Not a pfennig.

557
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:07,574
Excuse me.

558
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:37,980
- Shall we sit down?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

559
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:41,743
Here we are.

560
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:45,114
- You're doing your job
very well. - My job?

561
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:47,033
lsn't it the duty of the
ship's personnel..

562
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,161
..to see that unescorted women
don't get too unhappy?

563
00:48:50,586 --> 00:48:55,628
- l am here because l want to be.
-Now you really are doing very well.

564
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:57,127
Don't you believe me?

565
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,628
Does it matter whether l do or not?

566
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:03,714
Well perhaps you would
prefer to remain alone.

567
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:07,640
Oh, no. No. Please stay
and have a drink with me.

568
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,939
lt's my birthday.

569
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:13,357
ls it really your birthday?

570
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:19,690
Forty-six. Me, 46. l
can't believe it, 46.

571
00:49:21,117 --> 00:49:24,284
Well we Europeans are not as
conscious of age as you are.

572
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:27,782
Besides, when one looks as you
do and arouses in people..

573
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:30,495
..the feeling you do,
does it really matter?

574
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,579
You're very kind.

575
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:37,082
There's a time when hearts
grow cold and hard.

576
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:40,753
Women lose their grace
and become shrill.

577
00:49:40,928 --> 00:49:43,466
They run to fat or
turn to beanpoles.

578
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:46,592
Take to secret drinking.

579
00:49:47,643 --> 00:49:51,688
They marry men too young for them
and get just what they deserve.

580
00:49:54,484 --> 00:49:55,764
lt's enough to scare anyone..

581
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,695
..waiting for fear and loneliness
to do their work.

582
00:50:01,073 --> 00:50:05,403
Mrs. Treadwell, you are a very
exciting woman, and you know it.

583
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:11,656
Tell me.

584
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,330
Wouldn't it unnerve you to
have an affair with me?

585
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:27,381
Good evening. Are you enjoying
yourselves? You're not dancing.

586
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:30,093
Captain, do you have a second?
- Yes.

587
00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:34,349
There's a man in steerage. One of
your men took his carving knife away.

588
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,516
He needs his knife for his work.

589
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,644
This is the kind of thing he does.

590
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,022
Very nice. Very nice indeed.

591
00:50:43,116 --> 00:50:45,903
The man's an artist. He's not
gonna do anybody any harm.

592
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:51,365
- You are absolutely certain
of that? - l'm certain.

593
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:56,246
Unfortunately, l have to be answerable
not only for your safety..

594
00:50:56,337 --> 00:50:58,080
..but for the safety of the ship.

595
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:02,254
Captain, the man is an artist. He
needs his knife for his work.

596
00:51:02,343 --> 00:51:03,624
l'm sorry.

597
00:51:04,178 --> 00:51:05,637
Enjoy the party.

598
00:51:10,059 --> 00:51:11,684
l feel sorry for him.

599
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:14,932
You feel sorry for him?

600
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:19,609
He's a nice man. He doesn't
like doing this.

601
00:51:19,694 --> 00:51:21,983
But he's doing it. That's
the point, isn't it?

602
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:26,908
David, you're gonna
hate me for this..

603
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:32,118
..but l'm glad those people in
steerage don't have knives.

604
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:36,292
What's the matter? Afraid they'll come
up over the sides and murder us..

605
00:51:36,377 --> 00:51:38,168
..in our nice, clean, white beds?

606
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:41,328
Maybe they should.

607
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:46,921
You're so unattractive
when you get like this.

608
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,761
So violent and myopic.

609
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,303
lt's exactly the kind of thing
that infects your work.

610
00:51:58,566 --> 00:51:59,941
What about my work?

611
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:20,291
l told you no one would
dance with me.

612
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:22,171
Elsa, dance with your father.

613
00:52:22,256 --> 00:52:25,210
- Mama, please. - Dance
with your father.

614
00:52:25,301 --> 00:52:26,629
Elsa.

615
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:30,089
When you go to a dance, you
first dance with your escort.

616
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:34,464
Now, l am your escort, so you
will first dance with me.

617
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,095
Then, when you're seen dancing,
someone else will invite you.

618
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:44,061
Besides, you haven't danced with
your papa since your last birthday.

619
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:49,736
Papa, please. l don't want to dance.

620
00:53:10,596 --> 00:53:13,965
l'm sorry. l didn't
know anyone was here.

621
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:16,763
Don't be ashamed. What's the matter?

622
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:18,395
Come here. Sit down.

623
00:53:18,938 --> 00:53:21,263
Sit down. Come here. Come here.

624
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:27,441
Tears are good. You know
what they say in Turkey?

625
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,693
They say tears wash the eyes
and one can see better.

626
00:53:32,326 --> 00:53:34,568
At least l think they
say it in Turkey.

627
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:36,490
Turkey.

628
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:41,249
Now tell us, what is the reason for
this great emotional outburst?

629
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:44,372
Why isn't a charming young
lady like you inside..

630
00:53:44,464 --> 00:53:46,919
..enjoying the music and dancing?

631
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:52,301
Because no one wants to dance
with me. And l'm not charming.

632
00:53:52,555 --> 00:53:55,342
You are telling me you
are not charming?

633
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:59,846
An expert who has been to lstanbul,
Hamburg and Paris?

634
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,515
You are telling me?

635
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:04,648
And l am telling you that anybody
with eyes in his head..

636
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:06,726
..can see that you are charming.

637
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:10,603
Ask anybody with any intelligence.
Ask Glocken.

638
00:54:10,698 --> 00:54:13,070
ls this young lady charming
or isn't she?

639
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:16,694
- Charming. - There.

640
00:54:17,163 --> 00:54:18,538
l told you.

641
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,367
And how old are you?

642
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:21,990
Sixteen.

643
00:54:24,712 --> 00:54:26,087
Adolescence.

644
00:54:26,881 --> 00:54:28,624
What is adolescence?

645
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:32,251
Adolescence is a time when people
worry about things..

646
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:35,215
..there's no need to worry about.

647
00:54:35,848 --> 00:54:37,307
Sixteen.

648
00:54:37,558 --> 00:54:43,229
l promise you, at 1 7, you will be
even more charming than you are now.

649
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:46,435
At 21 , you will be gorgeous.

650
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:49,562
And at 25, devastating.

651
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:52,609
And l won't stand any arguments.

652
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:35,361
'Tales from the Vienna Woods.'

653
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:40,740
David, 'Tales from
the Vienna Woods.'

654
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:44,446
Dance with me.

655
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:50,372
You never like to dance.

656
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:55,171
l think l've been happiest
when l was dancing.

657
00:55:58,014 --> 00:55:59,342
Sometimes l wish..

658
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:03,430
..that l'd tied a tape measure to
my ankle when l danced all my life.

659
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:08,724
Then l could tell you how many miles
l've traveled when l was happiest.

660
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,980
David, dance with me.

661
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:46,926
Well..

662
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:52,520
l'm gonna enjoy this party
in spite of you, David..

663
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,730
..so if you'll excuse me..

664
00:56:55,822 --> 00:56:58,491
..l'm gonna dance with the
first man who asks me.

665
00:57:00,576 --> 00:57:02,071
And here he comes.

666
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:07,115
- May l have this dance?
- Delighted.

667
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,020
Good evening.

668
00:57:29,355 --> 00:57:33,104
Good evening. You seem
in good spirits.

669
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:36,561
- l am. l delivered a baby tonight.
- How wonderful.

670
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,896
- What was it, a boy
or a girl? - Boy.

671
00:57:41,075 --> 00:57:44,029
- What about our celebration?
- What do you mean?

672
00:57:44,162 --> 00:57:49,156
- Our dance. - You intimidated
me. l really don't dance.

673
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,708
l thought so. Well, this is a waltz,
and even you can manage a waltz.

674
00:57:55,423 --> 00:57:57,499
- l doubt it. - l don't.

675
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:06,008
Just follow me and then
follow the music.

676
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,361
How do you feel?

677
00:58:25,995 --> 00:58:28,782
l can't seem to get over this cold.

678
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,622
But l guess l'll be better if l
can get another night's sleep.

679
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:40,254
- You have to help me again.
- lt's not helping you.

680
00:58:40,593 --> 00:58:43,380
Oh, Willie. Don't lecture me.

681
00:58:44,597 --> 00:58:45,877
You'll lose count.

682
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,847
l'm trying to tell you
how serious it is.

683
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:52,435
Why are you trying to tell me?

684
00:58:54,607 --> 00:58:56,932
Are you trying to tell
me l'm an addict?

685
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:36,416
As a publisher, my aim is to direct
the minds of the readers..

686
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:39,260
..to the vital issues
of our society.

687
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:42,927
l have lately got a doctor to begin
a series of articles advocating..

688
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:46,549
..the extermination of
all the unfit at birth.

689
00:59:46,643 --> 00:59:50,475
That's the way it's with Herr
Rieber. He's thinking all the time.

690
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:55,276
All this will be accomplished
painlessly, of course. Painlessly.

691
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,607
Not only defective or useless
children, but the old too.

692
00:59:59,698 --> 01:00:03,612
Old persons over 60 or 65, perhaps.

693
01:00:03,702 --> 01:00:06,193
The same measures will be taken
with Jews, of course..

694
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:09,324
..and any illegitimate
mixtures of race.

695
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:14,457
White with colored of any kind,
Chinese, Negroes..

696
01:00:14,546 --> 01:00:18,129
..and for any white man convicted
of a serious crime..

697
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,458
..well, as for him..

698
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:25,425
There is only one problem with
all this. Who will be left?

699
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:29,680
That is the difficulty. No one is
ever willing to accept a new idea.

700
01:00:31,897 --> 01:00:33,391
Shall we dance?

701
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:41,397
l like to listen to Herr Rieber.

702
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:44,948
Every time l listen to him,
l feel reassured.

703
01:00:45,994 --> 01:00:49,908
l know no one could ever take
him or his party seriously.

704
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:01,383
Pardon me.

705
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:08,343
May l?

706
01:01:20,404 --> 01:01:21,898
How do you feel?

707
01:01:25,909 --> 01:01:27,154
Try a little longer.

708
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:29,236
l promise to help you
when the time comes.

709
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,327
l want to sit down.

710
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,219
lt's a nice party. Are
you enjoying it?

711
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:59,350
Can l have a cigarette, please?

712
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:16,034
May l get you something?

713
01:02:17,502 --> 01:02:18,700
Thank you.

714
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:32,719
Excuse me, please.

715
01:03:54,725 --> 01:03:56,682
l feel like l'm gonna die.

716
01:03:59,688 --> 01:04:00,886
l know.

717
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:25,911
- What the hell's the matter with
you? - You are selfish, boorish..

718
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:27,500
l don't know why l can't
get you out of my system.

719
01:04:27,591 --> 01:04:29,215
You're not even really pretty.
- Thank you.

720
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:32,171
Your head is filled with such garbage!
l wish l could just empty it out.

721
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:36,260
Take your hands off me! David, stop
it. l'll call for the purser.

722
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:53,567
- Leave me alone. - Jenny, Jenny..

723
01:04:53,658 --> 01:04:57,739
What? What do you
want from me? What?

724
01:04:58,872 --> 01:05:00,414
l wish l knew.

725
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:07,126
Oh, Jenny. Jenny, what's the matter?

726
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:12,420
l'm crying. That's what's
the matter, l'm crying.

727
01:05:16,223 --> 01:05:19,674
The sweetest face. The sweetest
face in the world.

728
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:23,433
David. David, what's
gonna happen to us?

729
01:05:40,914 --> 01:05:42,823
You never were any good at that.

730
01:05:44,376 --> 01:05:46,831
lt has a zipper, remember?

731
01:05:48,755 --> 01:05:50,333
What a wonderful sky.

732
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:54,379
l'm sure you and your wife
watch clouds together.

733
01:05:55,762 --> 01:05:58,549
l wish there was someone
to watch clouds with me.

734
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:05,845
You're an extremely romantic woman,
Mrs. Treadwell, aren't you?

735
01:06:06,106 --> 01:06:08,478
lt's been the handicap of my life.

736
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:15,147
l can't settle for things. Bernard
Shaw said it, didn't he?

737
01:06:15,407 --> 01:06:17,150
lf you can't get what you want..

738
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:19,733
..you better damn well settle
for what you can get.

739
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,197
What did you want, Mrs. Treadwell?

740
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,000
A useful life.

741
01:06:27,753 --> 01:06:30,457
Someone to love me. Forever.

742
01:06:31,757 --> 01:06:33,583
Ridiculous of me, wasn't it?

743
01:06:35,927 --> 01:06:37,386
And what happened?

744
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:42,967
l chose the wrong man.

745
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,098
How many times have you heard
that said, l wonder.

746
01:06:47,731 --> 01:06:51,314
He was the most promising.
The most handsome.

747
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:53,524
He had the most glorious facade.

748
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:56,855
The facade was all there was.

749
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:02,319
He made me the best-known wife of
the best-known skirt-chaser..

750
01:07:02,412 --> 01:07:03,741
..in the community.

751
01:07:04,873 --> 01:07:07,031
l made life hell for him.

752
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:11,120
lt ended in the divorce courts.

753
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:15,464
We met one day in the corridor
outside the courtroom.

754
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,040
He struck me.

755
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:23,173
l took every penny he had.

756
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:32,474
So you must forgive me if l'm not
exactly receptive to the idea..

757
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:36,316
..of other people's happiness
in marriage. l'm envious.

758
01:07:41,952 --> 01:07:43,944
You and your wife probably
have the closest thing..

759
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:45,946
..to a perfect life as one can get.

760
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:54,538
Nothing is perfect, Mrs. Treadwell.

761
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:03,176
l just wanted to tell you that l
would have bought the champagne.

762
01:08:03,348 --> 01:08:05,424
l would have bought it
if l had the money.

763
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:09,842
Come in.

764
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:21,944
- How old are you? - Nineteen.

765
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:23,409
You're one year older than l am.

766
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,082
Can you give me something?

767
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:33,412
l'm not asking for much, but
l must have something.

768
01:08:33,503 --> 01:08:35,496
Pepe would beat me within
an inch of my life..

769
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:37,297
..if l don't give him something.

770
01:08:38,008 --> 01:08:40,250
But aren't you a dancer?

771
01:08:49,061 --> 01:08:50,519
You better go.

772
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:01,979
Good. More dollars.

773
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:05,823
Let's see, there was the
student and the sailor..

774
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:10,076
- What about him? - He
did not have anything.

775
01:09:10,165 --> 01:09:12,573
- What was he doing here?
- He wanted to see me.

776
01:09:14,753 --> 01:09:17,956
Did it ever occur to you that
someone might just want to see me?

777
01:09:18,048 --> 01:09:19,293
Did it ever occur to you that..

778
01:09:19,383 --> 01:09:21,007
..l might want to be with
someone my own age?

779
01:09:21,093 --> 01:09:23,963
l am a human being too Pepe,
whether you think so or not.

780
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:26,759
Who told you? Who told you
you were a human being?

781
01:09:26,848 --> 01:09:29,422
lf it were up to you, l would spend
the whole voyage on my back.

782
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:30,846
l'll tell you what you are.

783
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:32,050
What you are is something
l picked up on the street..

784
01:09:32,145 --> 01:09:34,387
..when you were 14 with
dirty underpants.

785
01:09:34,481 --> 01:09:36,390
Trying to stop men for
a few 'centavitos'

786
01:09:36,483 --> 01:09:37,858
..for you and your dirty family.

787
01:10:21,403 --> 01:10:25,566
Lowenthal! You're snoring!

788
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:29,486
That's what my wife says.

789
01:10:33,123 --> 01:10:35,199
Why are they doing this to you?

790
01:10:41,298 --> 01:10:47,134
l lived with a man who controlled
the lives of 5000 people.

791
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,047
l mean controlled.

792
01:10:49,806 --> 01:10:54,801
l didn't want to, but l became
entangled with those people's lives.

793
01:10:55,395 --> 01:10:58,562
l came to know that every
piece of food l ate..

794
01:10:58,648 --> 01:11:01,270
..every piece of clothing l had..

795
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:04,396
..was coming out of their lives.

796
01:11:06,323 --> 01:11:09,608
One day, l entered one
of their houses.

797
01:11:11,036 --> 01:11:12,411
l'll never forget it.

798
01:11:13,997 --> 01:11:16,073
The woman who lived there saw..

799
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:18,835
..the shock in my eyes
at the way they lived.

800
01:11:20,921 --> 01:11:24,586
And she said, Pardon me.

801
01:11:27,177 --> 01:11:29,419
l said, Pardon you for what?

802
01:11:30,555 --> 01:11:34,220
So she said, Pardon me for my house,
pardon me for the way it looks..

803
01:11:34,309 --> 01:11:36,634
..pardon me for everything.

804
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:44,401
And then she said, But, of course,
you must understand that..

805
01:11:44,903 --> 01:11:47,857
..most of this place
is a garbage dump..

806
01:11:47,948 --> 01:11:50,653
..and l'm just a piece of garbage.

807
01:11:53,704 --> 01:11:58,828
l began by hiding agitators
in the chapel of the house..

808
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:03,745
..and l ended by helping
them get arms.

809
01:12:08,218 --> 01:12:09,677
You don't say anything.

810
01:12:11,138 --> 01:12:12,548
l don't know what to say.

811
01:12:14,182 --> 01:12:16,009
l haven't met many
people in my life..

812
01:12:16,101 --> 01:12:18,722
..who have committed themselves
to anything.

813
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:22,182
You never talk about yourself.

814
01:12:24,985 --> 01:12:26,693
There's not very much to tell.

815
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:32,364
l came from a Hamburg worker's family,
l worked hard to become a doctor.

816
01:12:32,868 --> 01:12:37,115
- l tried to be a man, l got
this. - lt is formidable.

817
01:12:37,205 --> 01:12:40,242
lt's idiotic. Marked
for life like cattle.

818
01:12:44,004 --> 01:12:45,284
Are you married?

819
01:12:48,175 --> 01:12:49,373
Children?

820
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:52,171
Two sons.

821
01:12:53,555 --> 01:12:54,718
Are you happy?

822
01:12:57,559 --> 01:12:58,757
Who is happy?

823
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:04,682
Why isn't she here with you now?

824
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:09,980
There was no reason in dragging her
halfway across the world with me.

825
01:13:11,406 --> 01:13:13,363
What about you? Are you married?

826
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:18,072
- Three times. - What happened?

827
01:13:19,331 --> 01:13:21,074
Never found the right one.

828
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,829
Maybe l was waiting for
someone like you..

829
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,912
..someone l could teach the waltz.

830
01:13:27,005 --> 01:13:28,583
l'm sure.

831
01:13:29,633 --> 01:13:32,753
Just think. lsn't it wonderful?

832
01:13:34,763 --> 01:13:37,966
Two strangers on a ship.

833
01:13:38,141 --> 01:13:42,554
We will never meet again.
And we can talk.

834
01:13:44,314 --> 01:13:48,526
We can talk like friends.
Or even lovers.

835
01:13:49,152 --> 01:13:54,194
We can talk like two people who
meet on the other side of the grave.

836
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:56,439
Keep talking.

837
01:14:00,288 --> 01:14:02,281
Do you have any feeling for me?

838
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,536
No, of course not.

839
01:14:09,673 --> 01:14:10,871
Of course not.

840
01:14:13,218 --> 01:14:14,546
lt's funny.

841
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:18,713
You know what l thought
you might be?

842
01:14:20,434 --> 01:14:25,641
l thought you might be the
innocent, romantic love..

843
01:14:26,523 --> 01:14:28,563
..l should have had in my girlhood.

844
01:14:33,029 --> 01:14:36,280
Of course, nobody ever
loved me innocently.

845
01:14:38,076 --> 01:14:40,781
And how l would have laughed
at him if he had.

846
01:15:32,589 --> 01:15:35,875
l never could hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

847
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:37,426
l beg your pardon?

848
01:15:39,888 --> 01:15:43,589
l never could hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

849
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:47,676
That's very interesting.
What does it mean?

850
01:15:48,897 --> 01:15:50,724
You wouldn't know if l told you.

851
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:54,895
All right, l'll tell you.

852
01:15:56,655 --> 01:15:59,905
You're at bat, see? At bat.

853
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:01,944
Bat! Bat!

854
01:16:06,623 --> 01:16:10,537
Okay, now you're at bat. The
pitcher, he's out there.

855
01:16:11,837 --> 01:16:14,707
Now he's winding up, and
he turns her loose and..

856
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:21,132
Just as it gets to you,
it dips down and away.

857
01:16:31,148 --> 01:16:34,184
And that is a curve ball
on the outside corner.

858
01:16:39,823 --> 01:16:42,065
l could never hit that
pitch with a paddle.

859
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:51,450
- l see. - No, you don't see.
You don't see at all.

860
01:16:52,335 --> 01:16:53,995
You don't know what it's
like to be out there..

861
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:55,795
..crowd's yelling
for you to deliver.

862
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,589
And they start talking.
The pitchers, they talk.

863
01:17:00,844 --> 01:17:04,130
He can't hit a curve ball
on the outside corner.

864
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:07,257
And from then on out,
that's all you see..

865
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:09,888
..is curve balls on
the outside corner.

866
01:17:12,689 --> 01:17:14,848
So you've had your big chance.

867
01:17:16,568 --> 01:17:18,561
And you have muffed it.

868
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:34,996
l can still hear my old man yelling
at me from the stands..

869
01:17:35,087 --> 01:17:36,462
..even though he wasn't there.

870
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:43,087
Big Will. You are a bum!

871
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:52,721
You are a bum, just like me.

872
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:07,486
l think you're being a bit harsh
on yourself, Herr Tenny.

873
01:18:09,746 --> 01:18:11,240
A bum.

874
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:17,118
You know, l travel a lot.

875
01:18:19,756 --> 01:18:23,208
My folks give me some money.
Not much, but some.

876
01:18:25,303 --> 01:18:27,841
They are more comfortable
when l'm not around.

877
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:36,519
You know what l find? l find the
most amusing things about people..

878
01:18:36,606 --> 01:18:39,892
..are their guilt's that they
drum up for themselves.

879
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,689
For instance, l estimate that
there must be at least..

880
01:18:45,115 --> 01:18:51,284
..873 million people in the
world who don't even know..

881
01:18:51,371 --> 01:18:53,993
..what a curve ball on
the outside corner is.

882
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:59,622
So l think it a bit excessive for
you to think that you have..

883
01:18:59,713 --> 01:19:01,540
..muffed your whole life just..

884
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,336
..because you couldn't hit it,
paddle or no paddle.

885
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,593
Do you understand what
l mean, Herr Tenny?

886
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:18,856
No.

887
01:19:20,317 --> 01:19:21,776
You know what l think?

888
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:32,489
- No. - l think..

889
01:19:33,038 --> 01:19:37,083
..that you are a sawed-off
intellectual.

890
01:19:59,398 --> 01:20:00,808
Bottoms up, shorty.

891
01:20:09,825 --> 01:20:13,075
The purser, from whom l learn what
little l know about this ship..

892
01:20:13,161 --> 01:20:17,029
..has informed me that you were
seen leaving La Condesa's cabin..

893
01:20:17,124 --> 01:20:19,412
..at a highly unrespectable hour.

894
01:20:22,879 --> 01:20:28,170
No comment, Willie? l think that's
one of the reasons l like you.

895
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,169
You don't have my vulgarity.

896
01:20:31,638 --> 01:20:34,972
l wonder if it's really true that
life is as stupid and meaningless..

897
01:20:35,058 --> 01:20:36,600
..as it seems to be on this ship.

898
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:39,717
The Lutzes and their daughter, the
Huttens and their blessed dog.

899
01:20:39,813 --> 01:20:41,224
And that gross little Rieber..

900
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:43,473
..who thinks of himself as
the wave of the future.

901
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:47,645
l suppose a great case could be
made for my own foolishness.

902
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:53,904
Will your wife be there to
meet you at Bremerhaven?

903
01:20:55,454 --> 01:20:57,114
She's a wonderful woman.

904
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:02,161
We've been polite to each other
for a good many years.

905
01:21:02,836 --> 01:21:04,829
Well, your sons will
be glad to see you.

906
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:07,708
We hardly know each other anymore.

907
01:21:08,675 --> 01:21:11,249
What will you do, go back
to your practice?

908
01:21:12,512 --> 01:21:16,759
l'm the kind of doctor l hate.
The hack general practitioner.

909
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:20,052
What would you have
liked to have been?

910
01:21:20,145 --> 01:21:23,181
- A good doctor. - Don't
you think you are?

911
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,815
Fair to middling.

912
01:21:31,281 --> 01:21:34,899
What do you think happens to
a woman like La Condesa..

913
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:40,034
..when she's deported under
such circumstances?

914
01:21:47,589 --> 01:21:50,045
How long are you going to
keep me a penniless beggar?

915
01:21:50,675 --> 01:21:52,964
Do l have to ask you for change
to go to the barber?

916
01:21:53,053 --> 01:21:55,758
- Remember the agreement, Johann?
- The agreement.

917
01:21:55,847 --> 01:21:59,216
You are to receive everything
after my death.

918
01:21:59,935 --> 01:22:02,177
Your mother was so pleased for you.

919
01:22:02,354 --> 01:22:05,141
She was so pleased for
your opportunity.

920
01:22:05,273 --> 01:22:08,274
My mother was pleased for a
chance for money for herself.

921
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:13,396
How can you keep me a penniless
beggar? How can you do that?

922
01:22:13,824 --> 01:22:15,152
Don't you have a heart at all?

923
01:22:15,242 --> 01:22:18,278
l have a heart. That's
why l can do it.

924
01:22:19,413 --> 01:22:21,820
What would you do with
the money, Johann?

925
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:27,285
l have seen you watch that
gypsy dancer's buttocks..

926
01:22:27,379 --> 01:22:29,371
..as she walks on the deck.

927
01:22:29,923 --> 01:22:32,877
l will not nourish your lust.

928
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:43,558
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- Good morning.

929
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:47,477
l have been trying to persuade Mrs.
Treadwell to have some breakfast.

930
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:50,235
There's nothing like it, you know.
Especially the morning after.

931
01:22:50,736 --> 01:22:53,820
At home, we always used
to have it English-style:

932
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:58,651
Kidneys, sausages, kippers,
things like that.

933
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:00,494
How elegant.

934
01:23:01,788 --> 01:23:04,659
Well, l think l'll look in
on the bar before dinner.

935
01:23:09,963 --> 01:23:12,668
What a hard-trying race they are.

936
01:23:12,924 --> 01:23:15,961
English-style for breakfast,
French-style for dinner.

937
01:23:16,053 --> 01:23:18,840
And every now and again, a
comfortable lapse back..

938
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:21,504
..to sauerbraten, sauerkraut
and beer.

939
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,387
He seems very attentive;
l'll say that for him.

940
01:23:24,561 --> 01:23:27,432
Did you ever see such
a collection of bores?

941
01:23:27,522 --> 01:23:31,935
The attentive Lt. Huebner, the
happily-married man Herr Freytag.

942
01:23:32,402 --> 01:23:33,944
And here comes the ape.

943
01:23:34,821 --> 01:23:36,019
Morning.

944
01:23:37,783 --> 01:23:39,692
'Espece de type'!

945
01:23:40,369 --> 01:23:41,697
How's the painting?

946
01:23:41,828 --> 01:23:43,951
l haven't been able to
do much onboard, but..

947
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:46,031
..here's something l've
been doodling with.

948
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:51,496
You can see l'm in love.

949
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:55,580
Of course. Everybody on
this ship is in love.

950
01:23:56,301 --> 01:24:02,055
Love me whether or not l love you.
Love me whether l am fit to love.

951
01:24:02,265 --> 01:24:04,554
Love me whether l am able to love.

952
01:24:04,643 --> 01:24:07,478
Even if there is no
such thing as love.

953
01:24:08,355 --> 01:24:09,849
Love me.

954
01:24:25,414 --> 01:24:28,783
- Where've you been? - l've been
talking to that Mrs. Treadwell.

955
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:31,829
You know, she's so bitter.
She frightens me sometimes.

956
01:24:34,172 --> 01:24:35,370
Well, what do you think?

957
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:37,539
lt's interesting.

958
01:24:42,848 --> 01:24:44,342
l think it's good.

959
01:24:45,016 --> 01:24:46,843
Well, of course it's good.

960
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:49,011
You couldn't do anything
that wouldn't be good.

961
01:24:50,063 --> 01:24:53,183
- lt's wonderful. - But?

962
01:24:55,736 --> 01:24:59,021
Does it have to be the same
thing all the time?

963
01:25:00,323 --> 01:25:02,115
Just what do you mean?

964
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,616
You know; the exploitation
of the masses.

965
01:25:05,704 --> 01:25:07,364
Well, it's true, isn't it?

966
01:25:09,082 --> 01:25:13,080
Well, it's just that.. No matter
how well these things are done..

967
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:16,040
..they always turn out to be
posters after all, don't they?

968
01:25:19,718 --> 01:25:21,342
You hate my work, don't you, Jenny?

969
01:25:29,644 --> 01:25:31,187
l think it's good.

970
01:25:45,702 --> 01:25:48,372
- Here he comes. Now, watch.
- What is it?

971
01:25:48,455 --> 01:25:50,993
l told the steward. Just watch.

972
01:25:58,882 --> 01:26:02,381
- lf you will come this way, sir.
- l'm going to have lunch.

973
01:26:02,469 --> 01:26:04,627
Yes. Another table has
been arranged for you.

974
01:26:06,098 --> 01:26:09,467
- Arranged? Who arranged it?
- Right over here, sir.

975
01:26:21,154 --> 01:26:22,814
Now he will see how we feel.

976
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:28,236
Dr. Schumann, they have placed
Herr Freytag at another table.

977
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:35,918
Herr Rieber, you are a real
anti-Semite. l don't know any Jews.

978
01:26:36,002 --> 01:26:37,995
l don't know anything
about them at all.

979
01:26:38,088 --> 01:26:41,373
l'm not an anti-Semite.
How can you say that?

980
01:26:41,466 --> 01:26:42,842
l'm very fond of the Arabs.

981
01:26:42,926 --> 01:26:46,591
l lived among them for a while and
found them to be very good people.

982
01:26:47,222 --> 01:26:49,713
You have not said a word, Dr.
Schumann.

983
01:26:49,808 --> 01:26:51,635
What do you think about..?
- Excuse me.

984
01:26:55,564 --> 01:26:57,355
Doctor has heart trouble.

985
01:26:58,567 --> 01:27:02,399
Do you suppose we should send
to inquire after him?

986
01:27:06,408 --> 01:27:07,606
Schumann.

987
01:27:09,286 --> 01:27:13,948
Schumann. ls that not a Jewish name?

988
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:16,834
My wife is Jewish.

989
01:27:18,837 --> 01:27:20,664
l told that American woman.

990
01:27:21,715 --> 01:27:24,550
- She must have told them.
- Now come, have some wine.

991
01:27:25,427 --> 01:27:27,087
lt's Niersteiner Domtal.

992
01:27:28,221 --> 01:27:32,136
Why be upset? The company is
much better at this table..

993
01:27:32,225 --> 01:27:33,506
..l can assure you.

994
01:27:33,602 --> 01:27:37,765
When Glocken isn't smoking one
of his foul-smelling cigars.

995
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:44,653
You know l don't mind not being
seated at the captain's table.

996
01:27:45,197 --> 01:27:48,363
Perhaps because l was never
invited in the first place.

997
01:27:49,076 --> 01:27:52,112
Those pious hypocrites.

998
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:57,744
- Why do you take it? - l have
been taking it for a long time.

999
01:27:57,834 --> 01:28:03,754
Oh, yes, he has. He has 2000 years
of suffering behind him.

1000
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:06,174
Well, l'm not going to take it.

1001
01:28:06,802 --> 01:28:10,716
A little patience. A
little understanding.

1002
01:28:10,847 --> 01:28:12,970
The world's getting
better all the time.

1003
01:28:13,392 --> 01:28:15,301
As my Aunt Rebecca used to say..

1004
01:28:15,394 --> 01:28:18,015
l don't give a damn what your
Aunt Rebecca used to say.

1005
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:30,610
Do you think any of you are
any better Germans than l am?

1006
01:28:32,744 --> 01:28:33,989
Do you?

1007
01:28:39,209 --> 01:28:42,660
Yes. Yes, l have a Jewish wife.

1008
01:28:44,673 --> 01:28:48,256
She's Jewish. Let me
tell you about her.

1009
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:53,386
She'd never hurt anyone in her life.

1010
01:28:56,518 --> 01:28:57,977
Anyone.

1011
01:29:00,564 --> 01:29:04,644
You.. You good, middling people.

1012
01:29:05,193 --> 01:29:07,519
You aren't fit to be in
the same world as her.

1013
01:29:09,197 --> 01:29:13,361
l saw some of you in the chapel this
morning. You kneel there and pray.

1014
01:29:13,452 --> 01:29:15,444
You pretend that you
are good people.

1015
01:29:17,456 --> 01:29:19,033
Good people?

1016
01:29:20,584 --> 01:29:24,119
You can't even exist without
your prejudices.

1017
01:29:25,422 --> 01:29:27,498
And the worst thing about you is..

1018
01:29:29,176 --> 01:29:33,090
..that you don't even
recognize what you are.

1019
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:35,514
You..

1020
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:50,732
Sometimes l think, in spite
of how much you understand..

1021
01:29:51,156 --> 01:29:52,816
..it's enough already.

1022
01:29:54,368 --> 01:29:55,566
What's going on?

1023
01:29:57,204 --> 01:29:59,492
They moved Herr Freytag from
the captain's table..

1024
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:01,241
..because his wife is Jewish.

1025
01:30:03,919 --> 01:30:05,543
And it's my fault.

1026
01:30:06,254 --> 01:30:09,754
l had to tell that dreadful Brunhilda
to stop her from chattering on so.

1027
01:30:10,884 --> 01:30:15,131
So stupid of me. He's
such a nice man.

1028
01:30:17,391 --> 01:30:19,549
l'd no idea this was
going to happen.

1029
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:25,643
- You're not gonna cry,
are you? - Of course not.

1030
01:30:27,025 --> 01:30:28,519
l never cry.

1031
01:30:34,157 --> 01:30:36,066
What do they got against the Jews?

1032
01:30:37,994 --> 01:30:40,402
Back home, we don't have anything
against the Jews.

1033
01:30:40,956 --> 01:30:43,707
Hell, l never even saw
a Jew till l was 15.

1034
01:30:45,293 --> 01:30:49,208
Maybe you were too busy lynching
Negroes to take time out for the Jews.

1035
01:31:13,947 --> 01:31:16,901
Why don't you ring for the steward?
He might give you something.

1036
01:31:16,992 --> 01:31:20,491
l have been ringing! Ringing!
Ringing! Ringing!

1037
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:23,948
A fellow gave these pills
to me in Tangiers.

1038
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:28,916
He had a theory that seasickness has
something to do with the eardrums.

1039
01:31:30,422 --> 01:31:31,585
You know, Lowenthal?

1040
01:31:31,673 --> 01:31:33,002
Yes?

1041
01:31:34,384 --> 01:31:36,626
You are really not
such a bad fellow.

1042
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,214
You think so?

1043
01:31:38,305 --> 01:31:43,761
These statements that l make, you
mustn't take them personally.

1044
01:31:43,852 --> 01:31:45,132
No, of course not.

1045
01:31:45,228 --> 01:31:49,689
lt is the march of history. History
is beyond us, Lowenthal.

1046
01:31:53,236 --> 01:31:54,399
Feel better?

1047
01:31:55,739 --> 01:31:57,482
- A little. - Good.

1048
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,901
You know, the thing l can't understand
is why you want to go back to Germany.

1049
01:32:01,995 --> 01:32:05,245
l would not want to be
where l was not wanted.

1050
01:32:05,332 --> 01:32:07,490
Why don't you go back
to your own country?

1051
01:32:07,584 --> 01:32:10,538
Germany is my country. My
father was born in Germany.

1052
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:12,954
And my grandfather was
born in Germany.

1053
01:32:13,131 --> 01:32:17,840
As a matter of fact, where are you
from? l can't place your accent.

1054
01:32:17,928 --> 01:32:20,679
You speak German like no
one l have ever heard.

1055
01:32:20,764 --> 01:32:24,097
The last 20 years of my life
were spent in Germany.

1056
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,519
Austria?

1057
01:32:28,438 --> 01:32:29,636
Near the border.

1058
01:32:30,607 --> 01:32:31,982
That's what l thought.

1059
01:32:32,067 --> 01:32:34,225
Lowenthal, you know it is
a historical fact that..

1060
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:36,691
..the Jews are the basis
of our misfortunes.

1061
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,155
- Of course. - You agree?

1062
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,822
Of course. The Jews and
the bicycle riders.

1063
01:32:41,993 --> 01:32:45,991
Bicycle riders? Why
the bicycle riders?

1064
01:32:46,832 --> 01:32:48,160
Why the Jews?

1065
01:33:39,926 --> 01:33:42,797
- Hey, what's going on?
- Man overboard!

1066
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:45,509
Man overboard!

1067
01:33:45,599 --> 01:33:47,508
Man overboard!

1068
01:33:47,601 --> 01:33:49,510
Hey, man overboard!

1069
01:34:26,014 --> 01:34:29,300
- Get her out of here! - Take
her to our cabin, please.

1070
01:34:35,565 --> 01:34:36,846
Turn him over.

1071
01:35:06,304 --> 01:35:07,929
Can you understand it?

1072
01:35:08,765 --> 01:35:12,514
A man jumps from a moving ship at
night, in the middle of the ocean.

1073
01:35:12,644 --> 01:35:15,218
And is drowned to save
the life of a dog.

1074
01:35:16,064 --> 01:35:17,772
Yes, l can understand.

1075
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:20,974
Who was he?

1076
01:35:21,278 --> 01:35:25,940
He was a woodcarver. He carved
little animals with his pocketknife.

1077
01:35:38,128 --> 01:35:39,503
Come in, please.

1078
01:35:39,588 --> 01:35:41,746
Doctor, what can we do?

1079
01:35:42,632 --> 01:35:46,298
Well, you're doing all
that can be done.

1080
01:35:46,386 --> 01:35:49,008
- How did it happen? - Yeah.
How did it happen?

1081
01:35:49,097 --> 01:35:52,347
- He was thrown overboard.
-Who would do such a thing?

1082
01:35:53,769 --> 01:35:57,138
But look at him. He knows that
someone tried to drown him!

1083
01:35:57,481 --> 01:35:59,936
- His heart is broken. - Doctor!

1084
01:36:01,234 --> 01:36:02,563
You are not leaving?

1085
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:07,314
Perhaps we could get him some
broth. Some hot broth.

1086
01:36:07,407 --> 01:36:10,776
Yes. You can give him some broth.
lt won't do any harm.

1087
01:36:10,869 --> 01:36:11,984
ls that all?

1088
01:36:12,788 --> 01:36:14,068
Yes, that's all.

1089
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:18,410
The man who saved him is dead.

1090
01:36:23,715 --> 01:36:26,004
Did he say a man is dead?

1091
01:36:40,513 --> 01:36:42,055
l know how you feel.

1092
01:36:49,856 --> 01:36:52,561
No. You don't. You're
like the others.

1093
01:36:53,067 --> 01:36:55,605
You thought the captain was
justified in taking his knife away.

1094
01:36:55,695 --> 01:36:57,237
That's what you thought, wasn't it?

1095
01:36:57,697 --> 01:36:59,322
You were the one who felt
sorry for the captain.

1096
01:36:59,407 --> 01:37:01,067
That was you, wasn't it?

1097
01:37:02,911 --> 01:37:05,152
Why can't we be honest
with each other?

1098
01:37:05,246 --> 01:37:06,575
l don't know.

1099
01:37:12,545 --> 01:37:15,119
- Maybe we're afraid to be.
- Well, let's try.

1100
01:37:15,507 --> 01:37:17,499
Maybe we'd better try.

1101
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,253
You say l hate your painting.
Well, l do.

1102
01:37:24,891 --> 01:37:27,845
Oh, God help me, but l do.
l don't know why.

1103
01:37:27,936 --> 01:37:31,221
You've said it. Maybe it's because
l'm not very good at it myself.

1104
01:37:31,314 --> 01:37:34,434
Or maybe.. just maybe it's because
it means so much to you..

1105
01:37:34,526 --> 01:37:36,435
..more than anything,
more than even me.

1106
01:37:39,572 --> 01:37:41,481
That's being honest, isn't it?

1107
01:37:45,912 --> 01:37:47,192
Yes, that's honest.

1108
01:37:52,585 --> 01:37:55,290
Well, l'll tell you something
that's even more sad.

1109
01:37:57,715 --> 01:37:59,755
l can't be what you want me to be.

1110
01:38:00,677 --> 01:38:03,631
And l know what you need. You need
someone just to be there..

1111
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:05,465
..to deny herself for you.

1112
01:38:07,642 --> 01:38:10,394
David, l wish l could be
like that, but l can't.

1113
01:38:10,478 --> 01:38:13,515
- l just can't. - Jenny,
l know you can.

1114
01:38:16,317 --> 01:38:18,310
Well, it means leaving
me with nothing.

1115
01:38:19,571 --> 01:38:22,144
You know? Nothing.

1116
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:25,444
Jenny, do you know what l need?
l need something very simple.

1117
01:38:25,535 --> 01:38:28,904
l need a woman. But that's so
difficult for you, isn't it?

1118
01:38:28,997 --> 01:38:30,621
You're so full of competition.

1119
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:33,621
Do you know how empty it is,
how frustrating it is..

1120
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:36,117
..to reach out for something and
then you find it isn't there?

1121
01:38:37,422 --> 01:38:39,877
To feel that someone is with you.

1122
01:38:41,593 --> 01:38:43,669
David, don't you think that l am?

1123
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,260
Don't you think that l
am in spite of myself?

1124
01:38:46,347 --> 01:38:50,392
- Haven't l tried everything? - Yes,
you have tried. You've split a gut.

1125
01:38:51,769 --> 01:38:55,518
lt's so hard for you. l know.
lt's so hard for both of us.

1126
01:38:58,067 --> 01:38:59,775
All right, you say my work is..

1127
01:38:59,861 --> 01:39:01,854
..the most important thing
in my life. lt is.

1128
01:39:01,946 --> 01:39:04,188
But that's the way l am.
l can't help it.

1129
01:39:04,282 --> 01:39:07,318
And whoever shares my life is just
going to have to put up with that.

1130
01:39:07,494 --> 01:39:09,819
She's going to have to
live a life for me.

1131
01:39:10,789 --> 01:39:13,825
Jenny, l know this sounds
selfish, but it's true.

1132
01:39:23,843 --> 01:39:25,752
We're not gonna go on
together, are we?

1133
01:39:29,057 --> 01:39:30,337
Are we?

1134
01:39:38,858 --> 01:39:40,056
David?

1135
01:39:47,283 --> 01:39:48,694
Come in.

1136
01:40:03,299 --> 01:40:04,758
l would have come to you.

1137
01:40:05,009 --> 01:40:07,168
Well, they said you
weren't feeling well.

1138
01:40:07,262 --> 01:40:09,550
l'm just tired, that's all.

1139
01:40:09,722 --> 01:40:11,632
- Were you sleeping? - No.

1140
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:16,304
Don't you know it's very unhealthy
to sleep with your clothes on?

1141
01:40:16,396 --> 01:40:18,056
- Where are they? - What?

1142
01:40:19,357 --> 01:40:21,978
- Where are they? - What are you
looking for? - Where are..

1143
01:40:22,068 --> 01:40:24,227
Stop rifling through my things.

1144
01:40:24,737 --> 01:40:27,275
Here they are. Put them on.

1145
01:40:27,866 --> 01:40:29,609
Come on. Put them on.

1146
01:40:36,207 --> 01:40:38,366
And l'll read to you
until you sleep.

1147
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:47,089
Some pretty risqu? literature
you've got here.

1148
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:53,431
'Natural Resistance' and
'Clinical Medicine.'

1149
01:40:55,602 --> 01:40:58,009
'Researches on Rheumatism.'

1150
01:40:59,147 --> 01:41:00,807
'Diseases.. '

1151
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,580
l don't know why l'm so tired.

1152
01:41:23,671 --> 01:41:27,254
Why, yes, of course. Well, that's
the way it is sometimes.

1153
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,142
The woodcarver died.

1154
01:41:38,102 --> 01:41:39,561
Yes, l know.

1155
01:41:39,813 --> 01:41:42,434
l have been unable to
accept death. Never.

1156
01:41:43,316 --> 01:41:45,107
No matter how many
times l've seen it.

1157
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:47,892
l always feel as though
l'm responsible.

1158
01:41:49,447 --> 01:41:50,692
Now..

1159
01:41:51,282 --> 01:41:52,907
..let's see what we've got here.

1160
01:41:59,624 --> 01:42:04,416
The dissolute Lady Chatterley sat
waiting for the gardener to enter.

1161
01:42:05,213 --> 01:42:10,504
He entered, stopping for a moment,
sensing someone in the room.

1162
01:42:10,593 --> 01:42:13,962
His muscles sinewy in the moonlight.

1163
01:42:14,806 --> 01:42:19,267
She spoke his name softly. The
gardener went over to her.

1164
01:42:19,435 --> 01:42:21,677
He kissed Lady Chatterley..

1165
01:42:21,896 --> 01:42:26,475
..with a kiss such as she had
never been given before.

1166
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:31,443
Her arms were waiting for him,
both resisting and demanding.

1167
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:37,120
'Jonathan, ' she said, 'Jonathan,
darling, you are violating me.'

1168
01:42:37,203 --> 01:42:38,828
Where did you get that?

1169
01:42:46,546 --> 01:42:48,124
You're so strange.

1170
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:53,587
Sometimes you're so bitter. Then
you're soft and warm, like a child.

1171
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:56,805
l'm just a woman.

1172
01:42:58,016 --> 01:42:59,510
Lie back.

1173
01:43:03,062 --> 01:43:05,055
There's three days to Tenerife.

1174
01:43:07,358 --> 01:43:08,521
l know.

1175
01:43:10,695 --> 01:43:13,233
What will your treatment be like
for you there? Do you know?

1176
01:43:14,032 --> 01:43:15,490
Will you be imprisoned?

1177
01:43:18,286 --> 01:43:21,406
lt will be some kind of an
imprisonment, l imagine.

1178
01:43:22,457 --> 01:43:25,908
But you mustn't think of me
sleeping on a stone floor..

1179
01:43:26,002 --> 01:43:28,160
..and living on bread and water.

1180
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:30,922
This is not my style.

1181
01:43:37,889 --> 01:43:39,217
Now..

1182
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,260
Now l'm going to read to you..

1183
01:43:42,352 --> 01:43:44,428
..from this book exactly
the way it's written.

1184
01:43:44,521 --> 01:43:47,557
lf this doesn't put you to sleep,
nothing ever will.

1185
01:43:47,649 --> 01:43:50,934
The liver is a large,
glandular organ..

1186
01:43:51,027 --> 01:43:55,274
..irregularly shaped and
of reddish-brown color.

1187
01:45:23,036 --> 01:45:24,447
Come on.

1188
01:45:27,123 --> 01:45:29,745
- Please come with me to the table.
- No. l've done enough.

1189
01:45:29,834 --> 01:45:32,788
You just have to take it
from here on by yourself.

1190
01:45:32,879 --> 01:45:35,002
- Are you sure l look all right?
- You look lovely.

1191
01:45:35,089 --> 01:45:37,129
Now, go on.

1192
01:45:46,476 --> 01:45:47,721
Good evening.

1193
01:45:48,144 --> 01:45:49,555
Good evening.

1194
01:46:05,537 --> 01:46:06,699
Hello.

1195
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:07,944
Hello.

1196
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:09,284
Waiter.

1197
01:46:09,707 --> 01:46:12,827
l would like one bottle
of champagne, please.

1198
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:14,837
Would you like to join me?

1199
01:46:15,255 --> 01:46:18,125
Why not? What are we celebrating?

1200
01:46:26,224 --> 01:46:27,504
Quarrel?

1201
01:46:28,643 --> 01:46:30,137
lt's over.

1202
01:46:32,814 --> 01:46:34,308
l'm sorry.

1203
01:46:46,286 --> 01:46:49,951
Will you excuse me? l have
to go to the bridge.

1204
01:46:57,672 --> 01:46:59,047
Do you want to dance?

1205
01:47:00,633 --> 01:47:01,831
No.

1206
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:04,178
No, not this time.

1207
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:05,924
Thank you.

1208
01:47:08,349 --> 01:47:11,469
l think l'm going to
go to my cabin..

1209
01:47:11,561 --> 01:47:16,104
..because for me, a little
German music goes a long way.

1210
01:47:23,114 --> 01:47:24,906
Don't be embarrassed.

1211
01:47:25,408 --> 01:47:26,986
Nobody is watching.

1212
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,698
Will l see you later?

1213
01:47:32,248 --> 01:47:33,743
Later.

1214
01:47:57,732 --> 01:47:58,930
Herr Freytag?

1215
01:47:59,734 --> 01:48:01,193
Herr Freytag!

1216
01:48:04,656 --> 01:48:07,443
l want to tell you how sorry l am.

1217
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:13,448
l wanted to tell you that
with all my heart.

1218
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:16,834
Heart?

1219
01:48:17,085 --> 01:48:19,623
You have no hearts. Any of you.

1220
01:48:21,506 --> 01:48:24,922
l'm sorry. l've no right
to be rude to you.

1221
01:48:26,302 --> 01:48:29,588
l have no right to
be rude to anybody.

1222
01:48:31,641 --> 01:48:33,598
You must be very much in love..

1223
01:48:33,685 --> 01:48:36,805
..with your wife to stand
up for her that way.

1224
01:48:42,193 --> 01:48:44,352
My wife and l are separated.

1225
01:48:46,906 --> 01:48:48,187
Yes.

1226
01:48:48,449 --> 01:48:49,860
Yes!

1227
01:48:53,496 --> 01:48:54,694
l..

1228
01:48:55,832 --> 01:48:59,995
l thought l could face what we had
to go through after we were married.

1229
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,422
l couldn't.

1230
01:49:04,883 --> 01:49:07,124
l wasn't ready to give
up my position..

1231
01:49:07,218 --> 01:49:09,756
..because of my employer's
prejudices.

1232
01:49:10,972 --> 01:49:13,843
My family talked to me about it.

1233
01:49:14,267 --> 01:49:15,642
My friends.

1234
01:49:20,106 --> 01:49:21,898
My dear friends.

1235
01:49:23,234 --> 01:49:24,776
So l panicked.

1236
01:49:25,904 --> 01:49:27,314
Panicked!

1237
01:49:28,781 --> 01:49:31,985
l asked my firm to transfer
me to Mexico.

1238
01:49:34,496 --> 01:49:37,532
And you'll never believe what l did.

1239
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:40,666
l wrote a letter.

1240
01:49:43,213 --> 01:49:44,837
Dear Marianne:

1241
01:49:45,965 --> 01:49:51,304
We can't go on together.

1242
01:49:55,475 --> 01:50:00,053
l've imagined her face a thousand
times when she got the letter.

1243
01:50:03,358 --> 01:50:06,312
That face has followed
me everywhere.

1244
01:50:10,281 --> 01:50:12,321
Now l'm going back.

1245
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,529
l don't even know where she is.

1246
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:22,375
But l've got to find her.

1247
01:50:24,295 --> 01:50:27,332
Plead with her to understand.

1248
01:50:32,053 --> 01:50:33,428
To forgive me.

1249
01:50:36,015 --> 01:50:40,013
lf she cares for you,
she'll understand.

1250
01:50:42,105 --> 01:50:43,516
Don't you see?

1251
01:50:44,691 --> 01:50:48,985
Even if she does, l know
l'll never forget.

1252
01:50:52,448 --> 01:50:54,192
l wrote that letter.

1253
01:50:58,621 --> 01:51:00,531
Listen to that music, Glocken.

1254
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:04,083
Now try to tell me you don't
react to that music.

1255
01:51:04,169 --> 01:51:05,414
Schmaltz.

1256
01:51:06,004 --> 01:51:08,246
Tell me, Glocken, now honestly.

1257
01:51:08,339 --> 01:51:11,044
When you hear that music
wherever you are..

1258
01:51:11,134 --> 01:51:14,088
..don't you have a special
feeling about being a German?

1259
01:51:15,305 --> 01:51:17,630
l'll tell you now
Lowenthal honestly.

1260
01:51:17,724 --> 01:51:20,013
When l hear that music
wherever l am..

1261
01:51:20,101 --> 01:51:22,592
..l have a special feeling
about being a dwarf.

1262
01:51:25,356 --> 01:51:29,983
l remember being thousands of miles
from home in a theater in New York.

1263
01:51:30,153 --> 01:51:34,696
They put on a picture of the
funeral of the Kaiserin Viktoria.

1264
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:39,826
That good woman. How much
she meant to all of us.

1265
01:51:42,332 --> 01:51:44,123
You are German, aren't you?

1266
01:51:45,043 --> 01:51:48,578
You are the most German
person l have ever met.

1267
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:52,499
l want to show you something.

1268
01:51:52,759 --> 01:51:54,668
l take it out every
once in a while..

1269
01:51:54,761 --> 01:51:57,631
..and look at it when
l want to feel good.

1270
01:51:59,724 --> 01:52:02,760
Why, the Order of the lron Cross!

1271
01:52:03,269 --> 01:52:04,764
Second class.

1272
01:52:06,314 --> 01:52:08,307
And a war hero, besides.

1273
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:14,655
You may be the biggest fool
on this whole boat.

1274
01:52:17,617 --> 01:52:18,945
Why do you say that?

1275
01:52:20,411 --> 01:52:22,737
Where have you been
during this voyage?

1276
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:27,491
Do you think this boat is a cross
section of the German people?

1277
01:52:28,336 --> 01:52:29,499
No!

1278
01:52:29,587 --> 01:52:33,003
You don't know the average
German the way l know him.

1279
01:52:33,091 --> 01:52:36,542
The people that produced a Goethe,
a Beethoven and a Bach..

1280
01:52:36,636 --> 01:52:38,463
..are not to be
sneezed at, you know?

1281
01:52:38,555 --> 01:52:42,006
50% of the people who produced a
Goethe, a Beethoven and a Bach..

1282
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,970
..voted for Rieber's party last
week. - Forty-four percent.

1283
01:52:46,104 --> 01:52:49,140
Lowenthal, you are blind!
You're absolutely blind!

1284
01:52:49,232 --> 01:52:51,901
You can't see what's going on
in front of your own face.

1285
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:53,569
What do you mean?

1286
01:52:54,904 --> 01:52:59,566
You mean this business about the
Jews? You don't understand us.

1287
01:52:59,742 --> 01:53:02,743
The German Jew is something special.

1288
01:53:02,829 --> 01:53:06,079
We are Germans first
and Jews second.

1289
01:53:06,958 --> 01:53:11,667
We have done so much for Germany.
Germany has done so much for us.

1290
01:53:11,754 --> 01:53:15,835
A little patience. A little
goodwill. lt works itself out.

1291
01:53:16,009 --> 01:53:19,627
Listen, there are nearly a
million Jews in Germany.

1292
01:53:19,721 --> 01:53:23,137
What are they going to
do? Kill all of us?

1293
01:53:30,148 --> 01:53:36,233
Karl, if you will excuse me. l want
to dance with a most charming lady.

1294
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:46,075
Might l have the honor
of this dance?

1295
01:54:15,777 --> 01:54:18,019
- l want you to give me some
money or l will kill you.

1296
01:54:18,112 --> 01:54:19,856
Are you out of your mind?

1297
01:54:20,824 --> 01:54:23,778
- l will kill you. - Johann!
That's God's judgment.

1298
01:54:23,868 --> 01:54:25,327
l don't want to hear that anymore.

1299
01:54:25,411 --> 01:54:27,867
Don't you think l know
how you've treated me?

1300
01:54:27,956 --> 01:54:30,281
Don't you think l know
how you've cheated me?

1301
01:54:31,167 --> 01:54:34,038
Where is it? Where's the money?

1302
01:54:34,129 --> 01:54:35,504
Top drawer.

1303
01:54:46,015 --> 01:54:47,213
Come in.

1304
01:54:51,229 --> 01:54:52,640
l have money.

1305
01:55:00,864 --> 01:55:02,192
Come here.

1306
01:55:02,866 --> 01:55:04,194
Come on.

1307
01:55:09,956 --> 01:55:11,581
Put out my cigarette.

1308
01:55:29,642 --> 01:55:30,840
Tell me..

1309
01:55:31,978 --> 01:55:34,434
..am l your very first girl?

1310
01:55:36,774 --> 01:55:40,855
You are shaking. There is
nothing to be afraid of.

1311
01:55:48,161 --> 01:55:49,359
No.

1312
01:56:03,259 --> 01:56:04,670
The first time..

1313
01:56:07,972 --> 01:56:10,546
The first time is very important.

1314
01:56:58,606 --> 01:57:02,022
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1315
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:03,734
l'm just teaching the
young lady flamenco.

1316
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:05,812
You keep your hands
off her, you pimp.

1317
01:57:12,996 --> 01:57:14,538
Big hero.

1318
01:57:42,692 --> 01:57:44,234
l'm sorry.

1319
01:58:13,431 --> 01:58:16,717
l don't believe you're quite
sober, Mrs. Treadwell.

1320
01:58:19,354 --> 01:58:22,889
What could give you that impression?

1321
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:39,405
God. He stalks them
like a mountain lion.

1322
01:58:40,708 --> 01:58:43,246
Did you see the makeup
on those girls?

1323
01:58:44,212 --> 01:58:48,874
- Do men really find that
attractive? - Some apparently do.

1324
01:58:52,178 --> 01:58:56,258
l would think that men
would like to know..

1325
01:58:56,975 --> 01:58:58,517
..what they were kissing.

1326
01:59:06,526 --> 01:59:09,231
l would like to know what
it is like to kiss you.

1327
01:59:24,002 --> 01:59:26,872
l have been looking at you,
thinking about you for a long time.

1328
01:59:26,963 --> 01:59:28,671
You never notice me. Why not?

1329
01:59:29,549 --> 01:59:31,458
Now you will not kiss me? Why not?

1330
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:34,254
Do you want me to say l love you?

1331
01:59:34,345 --> 01:59:35,888
l never knew what people
meant by that word.

1332
01:59:35,972 --> 01:59:38,510
Say, don't say it. l can't
bear the sound of it.

1333
01:59:38,683 --> 01:59:41,886
Then why did you lead
me on during the trip?

1334
01:59:43,771 --> 01:59:47,022
You never considered my
feelings at all, did you?

1335
01:59:48,401 --> 01:59:49,895
No.

1336
01:59:50,862 --> 01:59:52,321
And l'm sorry for that.

1337
01:59:53,698 --> 01:59:58,325
Mrs. Treadwell, l'm only a third-grade
officer on a second-rate ship.

1338
01:59:58,411 --> 02:00:00,902
But it has given me an opportunity
to observe people.

1339
02:00:00,997 --> 02:00:03,369
l've seen women like you before.

1340
02:00:03,458 --> 02:00:06,909
Forty-six-year-old women
who are still coquettes.

1341
02:00:07,003 --> 02:00:10,835
They travel on boats often. Always
searching for something.

1342
02:00:11,174 --> 02:00:13,332
Do you know where that searching
ends Mrs. Treadwell?

1343
02:00:13,426 --> 02:00:16,546
lt ends by sitting in a nightclub
with a paid escort..

1344
02:00:16,638 --> 02:00:18,796
..who tells you the
lies you must hear.

1345
02:00:21,726 --> 02:00:25,344
You are a most mundane,
ordinary man.

1346
02:00:28,608 --> 02:00:31,313
How extraordinary that
a man like you..

1347
02:00:31,611 --> 02:00:34,232
..should be saying things
like this to me.

1348
02:00:38,993 --> 02:00:40,274
Probably true.

1349
02:00:47,502 --> 02:00:50,953
l think this evening's festivities
have come to an end.

1350
02:00:53,758 --> 02:00:57,376
- l shall be happy to see you to
your door. - lt's quite unnecessary.

1351
02:00:59,222 --> 02:01:00,882
l'll find my own way.

1352
02:01:34,591 --> 02:01:36,749
- Darling? - Yeah Leiben.

1353
02:01:36,843 --> 02:01:39,963
l didn't know there
was a Frau Rieber.

1354
02:01:42,056 --> 02:01:44,298
What do you mean, a Frau Rieber?

1355
02:01:44,392 --> 02:01:47,726
The purser told me you sent
a cable to Frankfurt..

1356
02:01:47,812 --> 02:01:50,137
..addressed to a Frau Rieber.

1357
02:01:50,773 --> 02:01:54,059
l did not mention it before, because
l could not bear the humiliation.

1358
02:01:54,152 --> 02:01:57,651
lt is the tragedy of my life.
She will not let me go.

1359
02:01:57,739 --> 02:02:00,312
l must go on supporting her
and the three children.

1360
02:02:00,408 --> 02:02:02,401
There are three children?

1361
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:04,320
Well they have no understanding
of me.

1362
02:02:04,412 --> 02:02:05,954
And l have no understanding of them.

1363
02:02:06,039 --> 02:02:10,368
They hang on. They hang on. They
suck the life's blood out of me.

1364
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,749
They will not let go.
They will not let go.

1365
02:02:13,004 --> 02:02:15,875
l am a vital, passionate man.

1366
02:02:16,007 --> 02:02:19,590
l need love. l must have love.

1367
02:02:20,053 --> 02:02:24,133
Say you understand.
You must understand.

1368
02:02:24,224 --> 02:02:25,848
l understand.

1369
02:02:32,273 --> 02:02:35,191
Now, look, l bought you
a bottle of champagne, right?

1370
02:02:35,318 --> 02:02:37,061
A pack of them Sultana cigarettes..

1371
02:02:37,153 --> 02:02:38,731
..or whatever they are called
and two margaritas.

1372
02:02:38,822 --> 02:02:40,364
When are we gonna get together?

1373
02:02:40,448 --> 02:02:43,153
You have been drinking too much.
l think l will go now.

1374
02:02:44,035 --> 02:02:47,819
- Tonight. - Not tonight.
Tonight l am tired.

1375
02:02:47,914 --> 02:02:49,325
Tonight.

1376
02:02:51,459 --> 02:02:54,544
Very well. Just let go of my arm.

1377
02:02:56,714 --> 02:02:59,668
Hey. What's your cabin number?

1378
02:03:01,761 --> 02:03:03,386
Number 14.

1379
02:03:08,143 --> 02:03:10,764
l thought you weren't bothering
with that cheapskate.

1380
02:03:10,854 --> 02:03:14,187
l have planned something very
interesting for that cheapskate.

1381
02:03:14,274 --> 02:03:18,936
l gave him the cabin of that snotty
American bitch, Mrs. Treadwell.

1382
02:05:33,455 --> 02:05:35,114
l think you are mad.

1383
02:05:35,707 --> 02:05:39,787
l made some inquiries. They would
let me stay on the island.

1384
02:05:40,503 --> 02:05:42,330
l would be able to take care of her.

1385
02:05:42,755 --> 02:05:45,543
l understand your feeling about
her, her helplessness.

1386
02:05:45,633 --> 02:05:49,002
- But to give up everything.
- What would l be giving up?

1387
02:05:50,597 --> 02:05:52,838
- What would l be giving
up? - Your life!

1388
02:05:52,932 --> 02:05:56,218
My life. My life is obligations.

1389
02:05:56,936 --> 02:05:59,344
Obligation to nothing
that's real to me.

1390
02:05:59,689 --> 02:06:02,892
This woman.. this woman over there
in the cabin, she's real to me.

1391
02:06:02,984 --> 02:06:05,190
l know it sounds strange.

1392
02:06:05,862 --> 02:06:08,898
But she's the only real thing
that has happened to me.

1393
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:11,777
Willy you have heard of shipboard
romances, haven't you?

1394
02:06:11,868 --> 02:06:14,110
She's sold you a bill of goods,
and you've fallen for it.

1395
02:06:14,204 --> 02:06:18,332
My god. l can see it if you can't.
She wants her precious needle.

1396
02:06:18,416 --> 02:06:20,824
- She doesn't want you.
- This may be true.

1397
02:06:21,878 --> 02:06:23,420
lf this is true..

1398
02:06:27,425 --> 02:06:30,794
When l had my heart attack,
there was a dream l had.

1399
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:35,844
You can talk about death. l've
seen it many times as a doctor.

1400
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:40,013
But you never know what it's like
until it almost happens to you.

1401
02:06:44,818 --> 02:06:47,143
l dreamed l had already died.

1402
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:52,612
l dreamed l was in a box. The sweat
broke out all over my body.

1403
02:06:54,369 --> 02:06:59,031
l wanted to cry out, l can't
be dead, l haven't lived!

1404
02:07:01,835 --> 02:07:03,033
Who has?

1405
02:07:04,796 --> 02:07:07,287
Do you think this woman
is the answer, Willie?

1406
02:07:07,465 --> 02:07:10,585
A woman like this. All
she's been through.

1407
02:07:10,677 --> 02:07:13,797
She has seen everything. There
are no surprises left for her.

1408
02:07:16,266 --> 02:07:21,971
Even if it's love, Willie, l hope we
can deny the myth that love lasts.

1409
02:07:33,032 --> 02:07:36,733
You are not young, Mrs. Treadwell.

1410
02:07:37,996 --> 02:07:41,614
You have not been young for years.

1411
02:07:48,506 --> 02:07:53,714
Behind those old eyes, you
hide a 16-year-old heart.

1412
02:07:55,263 --> 02:07:56,841
Poor fool.

1413
02:08:02,395 --> 02:08:05,930
ls that what men really
find attractive?

1414
02:08:28,713 --> 02:08:30,124
Baby..

1415
02:08:31,925 --> 02:08:34,926
You just haven't managed to grow up.

1416
02:08:35,845 --> 02:08:41,385
Mrs. Treadwell of Murray
Hill, Virginia.

1417
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:45,145
Now!

1418
02:08:47,565 --> 02:08:50,270
You can paint your toenails green.

1419
02:08:56,866 --> 02:08:59,488
You know how it ends, don't you?

1420
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,574
Alone.

1421
02:09:06,167 --> 02:09:07,827
Sitting in a cafe..

1422
02:09:09,462 --> 02:09:11,918
..with a paid escort.

1423
02:09:33,987 --> 02:09:35,267
Let me go.

1424
02:09:36,948 --> 02:09:38,323
Let me go.

1425
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:52,295
Mrs. Treadwell.

1426
02:09:54,841 --> 02:09:59,966
Excuse me. That greaser told
me Cabin 14. Excuse me.

1427
02:10:00,847 --> 02:10:02,306
Excuse me.

1428
02:10:03,266 --> 02:10:04,464
Get out!

1429
02:10:05,852 --> 02:10:07,180
Get out!

1430
02:10:11,858 --> 02:10:13,352
Get out!

1431
02:10:14,652 --> 02:10:17,523
You know l'm sorry, l truly am
sorry. l didn't know it l was just..

1432
02:10:17,614 --> 02:10:20,187
- Pig! - Hey, what the hell?

1433
02:10:20,283 --> 02:10:24,411
Go on. Get out. Get out. Get out!

1434
02:10:25,663 --> 02:10:26,992
Get out!

1435
02:10:29,083 --> 02:10:33,995
Get out. Get out. No! No!

1436
02:11:10,708 --> 02:11:13,626
- You were sleeping. - l know.

1437
02:11:18,091 --> 02:11:19,550
You cried out again.

1438
02:11:22,178 --> 02:11:23,637
Did l?

1439
02:11:25,181 --> 02:11:26,510
What is it?

1440
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:28,048
lt's nothing.

1441
02:11:32,605 --> 02:11:35,725
- lt had to be something.
- lt was ridiculous.

1442
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:44,151
Tell me.

1443
02:11:52,041 --> 02:11:53,536
Promise you won't laugh.

1444
02:11:54,919 --> 02:11:56,117
l won't laugh.

1445
02:11:58,756 --> 02:12:00,833
lt's something l saw the
time l went to Taxco.

1446
02:12:00,925 --> 02:12:03,167
lt was just a flash passing
by on the bus.

1447
02:12:03,678 --> 02:12:06,549
lt was a man and a woman. A crowd
had gathered around them.

1448
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:10,304
They were staggering and swaying.
l thought they were dancing.

1449
02:12:11,686 --> 02:12:14,806
The man had his hand raised and
there was a long knife in it.

1450
02:12:14,981 --> 02:12:18,101
The woman's breast and
stomach were pierced.

1451
02:12:18,193 --> 02:12:20,731
The blood was so thick her skirt
was sticking to her legs.

1452
02:12:21,613 --> 02:12:23,771
She was beating him with a stone.

1453
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:30,114
l'll never forget the
look on their faces.

1454
02:12:31,664 --> 02:12:33,491
lt wasn't all hatred.

1455
02:12:33,917 --> 02:12:39,042
lt was like there was some great
bond between them in that hatred.

1456
02:12:41,841 --> 02:12:44,083
And then they struck again.

1457
02:12:48,181 --> 02:12:52,594
l always dream about it in
some grotesque variation.

1458
02:12:53,645 --> 02:12:58,354
Tonight l was one of the watchers,
as if l were at a play.

1459
02:13:01,569 --> 02:13:03,111
Then something happened.

1460
02:13:11,746 --> 02:13:15,281
- What happened? - The
features changed.

1461
02:13:17,544 --> 02:13:19,038
Yeah?

1462
02:13:20,505 --> 02:13:22,711
David, the faces were
yours and mine.

1463
02:13:31,975 --> 02:13:33,350
Good evening, doctor.

1464
02:13:45,363 --> 02:13:46,691
Night, doctor.

1465
02:15:37,642 --> 02:15:40,845
Thank you for bringing
us home, 'capitan. '

1466
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:44,721
The cuisine and the accommodations
were superb.

1467
02:15:47,277 --> 02:15:48,901
Yeah!

1468
02:16:12,469 --> 02:16:13,844
They've come for me?

1469
02:16:20,477 --> 02:16:22,884
For me, the voyage is over.

1470
02:16:25,607 --> 02:16:27,149
l have here an order..

1471
02:16:28,276 --> 02:16:31,396
..for something that will help
you. Any doctor will accept it.

1472
02:16:50,882 --> 02:16:55,211
Willie.. you try so hard.

1473
02:17:07,649 --> 02:17:11,100
My darling. My love.

1474
02:17:14,405 --> 02:17:19,114
For once, let's kiss
in broad daylight.

1475
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:39,715
Bye.

1476
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:47,415
l think we ought to be able to
reach Bremerhaven by Thursday morning.

1477
02:19:53,011 --> 02:19:56,462
Willie, you're drinking
up my best cognac.

1478
02:19:57,515 --> 02:20:01,513
Not that l mind, but that isn't the
thing you should be doing, is it?

1479
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:03,847
You shouldn't be doing this.

1480
02:20:06,191 --> 02:20:10,235
l know you're still thinking about
her. She'll be all right.

1481
02:20:11,321 --> 02:20:14,986
By now l.. l'll guarantee she's
found someone to help her.

1482
02:20:15,075 --> 02:20:18,111
- Woman like that always
finds someone. - Shut up!

1483
02:20:37,222 --> 02:20:38,420
Willie.

1484
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:43,718
That's a hell of a way to
waste good brandy, Willie.

1485
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:48,350
When l think of the things
l've seen on this ship..

1486
02:20:48,858 --> 02:20:51,480
The stupid cruelties. The vanities.

1487
02:20:51,736 --> 02:20:55,271
We talk about values?
There's no values.

1488
02:20:55,824 --> 02:20:58,397
The dung we base our lives on.

1489
02:20:59,452 --> 02:21:03,201
She looked into the garbage dump.
She did something about it.

1490
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,531
And we are the intelligent,
civilized people..

1491
02:21:06,626 --> 02:21:08,749
..who carry out orders we are given.

1492
02:21:09,045 --> 02:21:10,837
No matter what they may be.

1493
02:21:13,466 --> 02:21:16,503
Our biggest mission in life
is to avoid being fools.

1494
02:21:20,307 --> 02:21:22,762
And we wind up being the
biggest fools of all.

1495
02:21:23,893 --> 02:21:25,518
Why didn't l go?

1496
02:21:32,652 --> 02:21:34,146
Come in.

1497
02:21:35,530 --> 02:21:37,819
Herr doctor, Frau Lutz
wants to see you.

1498
02:21:37,907 --> 02:21:40,114
She say's her daughter Elsa
is not feeling well.

1499
02:21:41,703 --> 02:21:42,901
l'm coming.

1500
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:46,369
To hell with them, Willie.
You rest here.

1501
02:21:46,458 --> 02:21:48,830
You don't look well. You should
see the way you look.

1502
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:07,136
That is exactly what l mean.

1503
02:22:12,108 --> 02:22:13,686
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Good evening.

1504
02:22:13,777 --> 02:22:16,980
- You called me? - Doctor,
can you give Elsa a purge?

1505
02:22:22,869 --> 02:22:25,656
Take two of those before you retire.

1506
02:22:25,997 --> 02:22:28,784
Doctor, aren't you going
to take her temperature?

1507
02:22:37,759 --> 02:22:39,550
l think he's been drinking.

1508
02:28:08,381 --> 02:28:13,838
l can just hear you saying, What
has all this to do with us?

1509
02:28:16,431 --> 02:28:17,759
Nothing.

1510
02:28:20,315 --> 02:28:30,742
