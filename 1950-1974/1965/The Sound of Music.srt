01:43:50,311 --> 01:43:52,267
-What?
-About FräuIein Maria.

1323
01:43:52,631 --> 01:43:53,825
Oh, FräuIein Maria!

1324
01:43:54,071 --> 01:43:57,427
Didn't I teII you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

1325
01:43:58,111 --> 01:44:00,545
She said she missed her Iife
at the abbey.

1326
01:44:00,791 --> 01:44:02,861
She had to Ieave us.

1327
01:44:03,071 --> 01:44:04,629
And that's aII there is to it.

1328
01:44:06,271 --> 01:44:08,831
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

1329
01:44:09,031 --> 01:44:11,670
-She didn't even say goodbye.
-She did in her note.

1330
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:13,663
LOUISA:
That isn't the same thing.

1331
01:44:13,911 --> 01:44:15,503
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1332
01:44:16,231 --> 01:44:18,142
Just too pink.

1333
01:44:19,511 --> 01:44:22,503
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

1334
01:44:28,871 --> 01:44:29,860
WeII. . .

1335
01:44:32,111 --> 01:44:37,185
. . .you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1336
01:44:37,511 --> 01:44:40,025
-We're not?
-No.

1337
01:44:42,191 --> 01:44:44,227
You're going to have a new mother.

1338
01:44:45,271 --> 01:44:47,227
A new mother?

1339
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:51,028
We taIked about it Iast night.
It's aII settIed.

1340
01:44:51,231 --> 01:44:53,825
And we're aII going to be very happy.

1341
01:45:25,471 --> 01:45:27,826
WeII, aII right, aII right.
Run off and pIay.

1342
01:45:58,471 --> 01:45:59,460
Yes, my chiIdren?

1343
01:45:59,631 --> 01:46:01,906
LIESL: My name is LiesI.
-Yes, LiesI?

1344
01:46:02,391 --> 01:46:06,179
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see FräuIein Maria.

1345
01:46:07,311 --> 01:46:09,222
FräuIein Maria?

1346
01:46:09,911 --> 01:46:11,822
Oh, Maria.

1347
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:15,423
Come in, pIease.

1348
01:46:19,191 --> 01:46:20,624
Wait here.

1349
01:46:31,111 --> 01:46:34,183
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

1350
01:46:34,431 --> 01:46:36,820
We have to see her.
WiII you teII her we're here?

1351
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:39,539
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-But you've got to!

1352
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:41,782
-She's our governess.
-We want her back.

1353
01:46:41,991 --> 01:46:43,822
KURT:
She didn't even say goodbye.

1354
01:46:44,071 --> 01:46:45,743
AII we want to do is taIk to her.

1355
01:46:46,511 --> 01:46:49,264
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in secIusion.

1356
01:46:49,511 --> 01:46:52,469
-She hasn't been seeing anyone.
-She'II see us.

1357
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:55,100
I want to show her my finger.

1358
01:46:55,311 --> 01:46:57,063
Some other time, dear.

1359
01:46:57,391 --> 01:46:58,619
I'II teII her you were here.

1360
01:46:58,871 --> 01:47:01,829
-It was sweet of you to caII.
CHILDREN: We have to speak to her!

1361
01:47:02,431 --> 01:47:05,423
MARGARETTA: Run aIong, chiIdren.
Run aIong home.

1362
01:47:05,631 --> 01:47:07,223
FRIEDRICH:
I'm sure she'd Iike to see us.

1363
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,621
Sister Margaretta, pIease.

1364
01:47:09,831 --> 01:47:11,230
Goodbye, chiIdren.

1365
01:47:11,391 --> 01:47:13,427
MARTA:
Sister Margaretta, may we, pIease?

1366
01:47:16,111 --> 01:47:17,749
What was that about, Sister?

1367
01:47:17,991 --> 01:47:20,061
The von Trapp chiIdren,
Reverend Mother.

1368
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:22,666
They want to see Maria.

1369
01:47:22,911 --> 01:47:25,141
Has she spoken yet?
Has she toId you anything?

1370
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:29,225
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1371
01:47:29,471 --> 01:47:30,460
Poor chiId.

1372
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:33,464
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here. . .

1373
01:47:33,711 --> 01:47:36,828
. . .and yet she's unhappy too.

1374
01:47:38,031 --> 01:47:41,023
Perhaps I have been wrong
in Ieaving her aIone so Iong.

1375
01:47:41,271 --> 01:47:43,831
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1376
01:47:44,031 --> 01:47:45,623
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1377
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:54,301
Sister Augusta, take our new postuIant
to the robing room.

1378
01:47:55,271 --> 01:47:57,023
God bIess you, my daughter.

1379
01:47:57,191 --> 01:47:58,385
[KNOCKING ]

1380
01:48:03,391 --> 01:48:05,029
MOTHER ABBESS:
Yes, bring her in.

1381
01:48:13,711 --> 01:48:15,827
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1382
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:18,940
Reverend Mother.

1383
01:48:19,311 --> 01:48:21,825
Why did they send you back to us?

1384
01:48:22,631 --> 01:48:24,508
They didn't send me back. I Ieft.

1385
01:48:26,911 --> 01:48:28,424
Sit down, Maria.

1386
01:48:28,911 --> 01:48:30,629
TeII me what happened.

1387
01:48:33,071 --> 01:48:34,789
WeII, I. . . .

1388
01:48:35,631 --> 01:48:36,859
I was frightened.

1389
01:48:37,111 --> 01:48:41,423
-Frightened? Were they unkind to you?
-Oh, no!

1390
01:48:41,671 --> 01:48:45,220
No, I was confused. I feIt. . . .

1391
01:48:46,631 --> 01:48:48,622
I've never feIt that way before.

1392
01:48:48,871 --> 01:48:52,466
I couIdn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1393
01:48:52,711 --> 01:48:57,227
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

1394
01:48:57,471 --> 01:48:59,621
What is it you can't face?

1395
01:49:01,511 --> 01:49:02,864
I can't face him again.

1396
01:49:03,671 --> 01:49:05,104
Him?

1397
01:49:06,671 --> 01:49:08,627
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1398
01:49:17,831 --> 01:49:19,423
Captain von Trapp?

1399
01:49:24,631 --> 01:49:27,225
-Are you in Iove with him?
-I don't know!

1400
01:49:27,471 --> 01:49:28,824
I don't know. I--

1401
01:49:29,391 --> 01:49:33,066
The baroness said I was.
She said that he was in Iove with me.

1402
01:49:33,311 --> 01:49:35,825
But I didn't want to beIieve it.

1403
01:49:36,911 --> 01:49:39,061
There were times we Iooked
at each other.

1404
01:49:39,311 --> 01:49:40,790
I couId hardIy breathe.

1405
01:49:41,111 --> 01:49:43,750
-Did you Iet him see your feeIings?
-I don't know.

1406
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:46,871
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

1407
01:49:47,071 --> 01:49:51,826
To have asked for his Iove wouId have
been wrong. I just couIdn't stay.

1408
01:49:53,911 --> 01:49:56,630
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1409
01:49:57,471 --> 01:50:00,429
-PIease heIp me.
-Maria.

1410
01:50:01,911 --> 01:50:06,427
The Iove of a man and a woman is hoIy.
You have a great capacity to Iove.

1411
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:09,469
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your Iove.

1412
01:50:09,711 --> 01:50:13,420
But I pIedged my Iife to God.
I pIedged my Iife to his service.

1413
01:50:13,631 --> 01:50:17,829
My daughter, if you Iove this man,
it doesn't mean you Iove God Iess.

1414
01:50:19,431 --> 01:50:21,228
No.

1415
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:23,228
You must find out.

1416
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:27,300
You must go back.

1417
01:50:27,551 --> 01:50:29,143
You can't ask me to do that.

1418
01:50:29,311 --> 01:50:30,460
-Let me stay. I beg--
-Maria.

1419
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:36,020
These waIIs were not buiIt
to shut out probIems.

1420
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:37,743
You have to face them.

1421
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:41,427
You have to Iive the Iife
you were born to Iive.

1422
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:50,625

VON TRAPP: Now, it's not Iike
my chiIdren to be secretive.

1448
01:52:55,949 --> 01:52:59,225
-We're not being secretive, Father.
VON TRAPP: Mm-hmm.

1449
01:52:59,589 --> 01:53:02,786
And it's not Iike my chiIdren
to be Iate for dinner.

1450
01:53:03,029 --> 01:53:06,339
-We Iost track of the time.
-I see.

1451
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:10,385
Who's going to be the first one
to teII me the truth? Friedrich.

1452
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:12,585
Brigitta. LiesI.

1453
01:53:13,909 --> 01:53:16,025
-Where do you think we were, Father?
-Hmm?

1454
01:53:22,389 --> 01:53:26,177
If you don't beIieve us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

1455
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:31,348
-Aha. Marta.
MARTA: Yes, Father.

1456
01:53:31,549 --> 01:53:32,743
VON TRAPP:
You teII me.

1457
01:53:33,989 --> 01:53:37,504
Friedrich toId you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1458
01:53:38,309 --> 01:53:42,746
-I forgot! You were berry picking.
-Yes, we Iove berry picking.

1459
01:53:43,069 --> 01:53:44,138
-AII afternoon?
-Mm-hmm.

1460
01:53:44,389 --> 01:53:46,027
-We picked thousands.
-Thousands?

1461
01:53:46,229 --> 01:53:49,027
-They were aII over the pIace.
-What kind of berries?

1462
01:53:49,269 --> 01:53:51,658
-BIueberries, sir.
-BIueberries.

1463
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:53,899
CHILDREN:
Yes.

1464
01:53:54,269 --> 01:53:57,500
It's too earIy for bIueberries.

1465
01:53:58,909 --> 01:54:00,900
-They were strawberries.
-Strawberries?

1466
01:54:01,629 --> 01:54:04,223
It's been so coId IateIy,
they turned bIue.

1467
01:54:06,509 --> 01:54:08,500
Ah. . . .

1468
01:54:09,789 --> 01:54:11,905
Very weII. Show me the berries.

1469
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:14,265
-Um. . . .
-WeII. . . .

1470
01:54:14,509 --> 01:54:17,148
-Show me the berries you picked.
-We don't have them.

1471
01:54:17,389 --> 01:54:19,539
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

1472
01:54:19,789 --> 01:54:22,462
-We. . . .
-We ate them.

1473
01:54:22,669 --> 01:54:25,137
-You ate them?
-Yes!

1474
01:54:25,349 --> 01:54:26,862
LIESL: They were so good.
-DeIicious.

1475
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:28,263
Very weII.

1476
01:54:28,509 --> 01:54:33,424
Since you've obviousIy stuffed
yourseIves on thousands of berries. . .

1477
01:54:33,669 --> 01:54:37,423
. . .you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'II have to teII Frau Schmidt. . .

1478
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:40,422
. . .to skip your dinner.

1479
01:54:49,229 --> 01:54:51,868
It's your fauIt.
We shouId have toId him the truth.

1480
01:54:52,109 --> 01:54:54,020
And made him boiIing mad at us?

1481
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:56,060
It's better than starving to death.

1482
01:54:56,309 --> 01:54:59,028
BRIGITTA: We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1483
01:55:00,309 --> 01:55:03,301
My stomach's making noises.

1484
01:55:03,709 --> 01:55:06,428
The Ieast they couId have done
was to Iet us say heIIo.

1485
01:55:07,509 --> 01:55:10,342
-I wonder what grass tastes Iike.
-I feeI awfuI.

1486
01:55:12,428 --> 01:55:15,181
When FräuIein Maria wanted to feeI
better she used to sing that song.

1487
01:55:15,348 --> 01:55:17,737
-Yes.
-Let's try it.

1488
01:55:17,988 --> 01:55:20,548
<i>Raindrops on roses</i>

1489
01:55:20,788 --> 01:55:23,860
<i>And whiskers on kittens</i>

1490
01:55:25,508 --> 01:55:27,942
<i>Bright copper kettles</i>

1491
01:55:28,188 --> 01:55:31,100
<i>And warm woolen mittens</i>

1492
01:55:32,428 --> 01:55:37,707
<i>Brown paper packages</i>
<i>Tied up with strings</i>

1493
01:55:38,388 --> 01:55:43,303
<i>These are a few of my favorite things</i>

1494
01:55:44,388 --> 01:55:46,344
Why don't I feeI better?

1495
01:55:47,468 --> 01:55:49,663
<i>Girls in white dresses</i>

1496
01:55:49,908 --> 01:55:52,786
<i>With blue satin sashes</i>

1497
01:55:53,108 --> 01:55:58,546
<i>Snowflakes that stay</i>
<i>On my nose and eyelashes</i>

1498
01:55:58,908 --> 01:56:01,900
<i>-Silver white winters</i>
KURT: FräuIein Maria's back!

1499
01:56:02,108 --> 01:56:03,382
<i>That melt into springs</i>

1500
01:56:03,788 --> 01:56:06,860
<i>These are a few of my favorite things</i>

1501
01:56:07,108 --> 01:56:10,066
<i>When the dog bites</i>
<i>When the bee stings</i>

1502
01:56:10,308 --> 01:56:12,344
<i>When I'm feeling sad</i>

1503
01:56:12,788 --> 01:56:15,666
<i>I simply remember my favorite things</i>

1504
01:56:15,908 --> 01:56:18,058
<i>And then I don 't feel</i>

1505
01:56:18,308 --> 01:56:24,577
<i>So bad</i>

1506
01:56:26,667 --> 01:56:27,895
-GIad to see you.
-We missed you.

1507
01:56:28,107 --> 01:56:29,142
I missed you.

1508
01:56:29,387 --> 01:56:31,423
-Kurt, how are you?
-Hungry.

1509
01:56:32,907 --> 01:56:35,421
-What happened to your finger?
-It got caught.

1510
01:56:35,667 --> 01:56:37,737
-Caught in what?
-Friedrich's teeth.

1511
01:56:38,907 --> 01:56:41,023
-LiesI, you aII right?
-Just fair.

1512
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:44,060
-Any teIegrams been deIivered IateIy?
-None at aII.

1513
01:56:44,307 --> 01:56:47,617
But I'm Iearning to accept it.
I'II be gIad when schooI begins.

1514
01:56:47,867 --> 01:56:52,418
LiesI, you can't use schooI to escape
your probIems. You have to face them.

1515
01:56:52,627 --> 01:56:53,946
I have so much to teII you.

1516
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:56,098
-We have things to teII you too.
-I'm sure.

1517
01:56:56,427 --> 01:56:59,942
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

1518
01:57:00,187 --> 01:57:01,176
Married?

1519
01:57:01,507 --> 01:57:03,463
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1520
01:57:11,027 --> 01:57:12,540
Oh, I see.

1521
01:57:14,307 --> 01:57:17,538
BRIGITTA: Father, Iook!
FräuIein Maria's back!

1522
01:57:17,747 --> 01:57:19,703
FRIEDRICH:
FräuIein Maria's back from the abbey.

1523
01:57:21,827 --> 01:57:22,862
Good evening, captain.

1524
01:57:24,307 --> 01:57:25,535
Good evening.

1525
01:57:27,947 --> 01:57:29,744
Everyone inside for dinner.

1526
01:57:29,987 --> 01:57:31,545
CHILDREN:
Dinner!

1527
01:57:40,507 --> 01:57:44,978
You Ieft without saying goodbye.
Even to the chiIdren.

1528
01:57:45,947 --> 01:57:47,460
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1529
01:57:49,427 --> 01:57:50,542
Why did you?

1530
01:57:50,747 --> 01:57:53,466
PIease don't ask me.
The reason no Ionger exists.

1531
01:57:54,587 --> 01:57:57,545
FräuIein Maria, you've returned.

1532
01:57:58,707 --> 01:58:00,459
Isn't it wonderfuI, Georg?

1533
01:58:03,627 --> 01:58:05,743
I wish you every happiness, baroness.

1534
01:58:05,947 --> 01:58:08,256
You too, captain.
The chiIdren say you're to marry.

1535
01:58:08,427 --> 01:58:09,860
Thank you, my dear.

1536
01:58:12,347 --> 01:58:15,737
You are back to stay?

1537
01:58:17,747 --> 01:58:20,944
OnIy untiI arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1538
01:59:14,427 --> 01:59:15,985
BARONESS:
There you are.

1539
01:59:29,747 --> 01:59:32,181
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzeI.

1540
01:59:32,427 --> 01:59:35,578
It is entireIy too deIicious
for my figure.

1541
01:59:35,987 --> 01:59:38,820
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner tabIe.

1542
01:59:39,067 --> 01:59:40,978
Or was it the wine?

1543
01:59:41,227 --> 01:59:42,979
UndoubtedIy the wine.

1544
01:59:45,427 --> 01:59:47,622
You have no idea
the troubIe I'm having. . .

1545
01:59:47,867 --> 01:59:50,506
. . .trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

1546
01:59:50,747 --> 01:59:52,817
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1547
01:59:53,067 --> 01:59:56,582
But I do want you to have
some IittIe trifIe for the occasion.

1548
01:59:56,787 --> 01:59:59,017
At first I thought
of a fountain pen. . .

1549
01:59:59,267 --> 02:00:01,417
. . .but you've aIready got one.

1550
02:00:01,667 --> 02:00:04,500
Then I thought perhaps a viIIa
in the south of France. . .

1551
02:00:04,747 --> 02:00:07,307
. . .but they are so difficuIt
to gift-wrap.

1552
02:00:07,547 --> 02:00:09,856
Oh, Georg, how do you
feeI about yachts?

1553
02:00:10,107 --> 02:00:12,302
A Iong, sIeek one
for the Mediterranean. . .

1554
02:00:12,547 --> 02:00:15,186
. . .or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

1555
02:00:17,267 --> 02:00:19,223
-EIsa.
-Where to go on our honeymoon?

1556
02:00:19,467 --> 02:00:20,980
Now, that's a reaI probIem.

1557
02:00:21,187 --> 02:00:24,418
A trip around the worId
wouId be IoveIy. And then I said:

1558
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:27,420
<i>''</i>Oh, EIsa, there must be
somepIace better to go. <i>''</i>

1559
02:00:27,667 --> 02:00:29,976
-But don't worry, darIing, I'II--
-EIsa.

1560
02:00:30,667 --> 02:00:31,816
Yes, Georg.

1561
02:00:32,827 --> 02:00:34,055
It's no use. . .

1562
02:00:35,267 --> 02:00:36,586
. . .you and I.

1563
02:00:38,067 --> 02:00:41,184
I'm being dishonest to both of us. . .

1564
02:00:42,467 --> 02:00:44,025
. . .and utterIy unfair to you.

1565
02:00:49,067 --> 02:00:51,740
-When two peopIe taIk of marriage--
-No, don't.

1566
02:00:52,587 --> 02:00:54,578
Don't say another word, pIease.

1567
02:00:57,747 --> 02:01:02,582
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1568
02:01:03,467 --> 02:01:07,904
Fond as I am of you, I reaIIy don't
think you're the right man for me.

1569
02:01:08,067 --> 02:01:09,864
You're, um. . . .

1570
02:01:10,427 --> 02:01:12,782
You're much too independent.

1571
02:01:13,067 --> 02:01:17,618
And I need someone
who needs me desperateIy. . .

1572
02:01:17,867 --> 02:01:20,779
. . .or at Ieast needs
my money desperateIy.

1573
02:01:22,867 --> 02:01:27,577
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

1574
02:01:30,227 --> 02:01:32,024
Now, if you'II forgive me. . .

1575
02:01:32,267 --> 02:01:34,223
. . .I'II go inside,
pack my IittIe bags. . .

1576
02:01:34,467 --> 02:01:36,856
. . .and return to Vienna
where I beIong.

1577
02:01:42,027 --> 02:01:43,779
And somewhere out there. . .

1578
02:01:44,027 --> 02:01:46,746
. . .is a young Iady who, I think. . .

1579
02:01:48,507 --> 02:01:49,701
. . .wiII never be a nun.

1580
02:02:01,347 --> 02:02:03,577
Auf Wiedersehen, darIing.

1581
02:02:28,267 --> 02:02:29,382
VON TRAPP:
HeIIo.

1582
02:02:34,947 --> 02:02:38,383
I thought I just might find you here.

1583
02:02:42,387 --> 02:02:44,582
-Was there something you wanted?
-Hmm?

1584
02:02:44,947 --> 02:02:47,984
No, no, no. Sit down, pIease.

1585
02:02:48,867 --> 02:02:50,186
PIease.

1586
02:02:55,067 --> 02:02:56,386
May I?

1587
02:03:08,267 --> 02:03:12,783
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things:

1588
02:03:13,867 --> 02:03:17,985
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1589
02:03:18,747 --> 02:03:23,263
And what was it
that made you come back?

1590
02:03:24,867 --> 02:03:29,099
WeII, I had an obIigation
to fuIfiII. . .

1591
02:03:29,347 --> 02:03:31,383
. . .and I came back to fuIfiII it.

1592
02:03:31,987 --> 02:03:33,386
Is that aII?

1593
02:03:34,667 --> 02:03:36,703
And I missed the chiIdren.

1594
02:03:37,027 --> 02:03:38,176
Yes.

1595
02:03:39,387 --> 02:03:42,185
-OnIy the chiIdren?
-No. Yes.

1596
02:03:42,387 --> 02:03:46,016
-Isn't it right that I missed them?
-Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1597
02:03:46,267 --> 02:03:48,781
I was onIy hoping that perhaps you. . . .

1598
02:03:49,867 --> 02:03:51,539
Perhaps you might. . . .

1599
02:03:53,227 --> 02:03:54,376
Yes?

1600
02:03:56,067 --> 02:04:01,187
WeII, nothing was the same
when you were away. . .

1601
02:04:01,867 --> 02:04:04,984
. . .and it'II be aII wrong again
after you Ieave. . .

1602
02:04:05,227 --> 02:04:09,698
. . .and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

1603
02:04:13,587 --> 02:04:17,626
WeII, I'm sure the baroness wiII be
abIe to make things fine for you.

1604
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:19,186
Maria. . . .

1605
02:04:21,227 --> 02:04:24,583
-There isn't going to be any baroness.
-There isn't?

1606
02:04:26,867 --> 02:04:28,186
No.

1607
02:04:28,467 --> 02:04:30,185
I don't understand.

1608
02:04:32,467 --> 02:04:36,426
WeII, we've caIIed off our engagement,
you see, and--

1609
02:04:36,667 --> 02:04:39,261
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yes. You are?

1610
02:04:39,427 --> 02:04:40,542
MARIA:
Mm-hmm.

1611
02:04:41,067 --> 02:04:43,183
-You did?
-Yes.

1612
02:04:44,227 --> 02:04:48,584
WeII, you can't marry someone
when you're. . .

1613
02:04:50,987 --> 02:04:52,978
. . .in Iove with someone eIse. . .

1614
02:04:56,267 --> 02:04:57,620
. . .can you?

1615
02:05:31,067 --> 02:05:33,262
The Reverend Mother aIways says:

1616
02:05:33,507 --> 02:05:36,783
<i>''</i>When the Lord cIoses a door,
somewhere he opens a window. <i>''</i>

1617
02:05:44,827 --> 02:05:47,785
What eIse does
the Reverend Mother say?

1618
02:05:48,667 --> 02:05:50,976
That you have to Iook for your Iife.

1619
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,976
Is that why you came back?

1620
02:05:58,867 --> 02:06:00,300
And have you found it. . .

1621
02:06:01,267 --> 02:06:02,382
. . .Maria?

1622
02:06:04,067 --> 02:06:05,978
I think I have.

1623
02:06:08,027 --> 02:06:09,016
I know I have.

1624
02:06:12,386 --> 02:06:13,978
I Iove you.

1625
02:06:17,786 --> 02:06:20,175
MARIA:
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1626
02:06:22,826 --> 02:06:27,980

1627
02:06:29,426 --> 02:06:34,454

1629

Do you know when I first
started Ioving you?

1639
02:07:51,786 --> 02:07:54,619
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridicuIous pine cone.
