1
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,898
Party, inward... turn!

2
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,702
Party... fIag!

3
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,578
For as much as it hath pIeased
AImighty God to take unto himseIf

4
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,850
the souI of our dear brother here departed,

5
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,925
we therefore commit his body to the ground.

6
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,819
DetaiI, outward... turn!

7
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:22,163
DetaiI... quick march!

8
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:43,441
Major Fincham, wiII you now
pIease dismiss your men?

9
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,287
- Where is your commandant?
- As I toId you, Major BattagIia is indisposed.

10
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:52,327
His orders are to disperse
immediateIy after the funeraI.

11
00:05:55,932 --> 00:06:00,665
- Major Fincham, pIease.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!

12
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:14,909
- You'd better foIIow me, pIease, CoIoneI.
- Thanks, paI.

13
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:29,296
What are they ceIebrating out there?

14
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:51,710
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 0718359.

15
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:57,188
Don't you saIute senior officers
in your army, Major?

16
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,524
- Are you the officiaI interpreter?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,797
- Then interpret exactIy. CIear?
- Yes, sir.

18
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:17,970
And add this: No wonder ItaIy's
Iosing the war, with officers Iike him.

19
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,275
WeII?

20
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,422
BattagIia! BattagIia!

21
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:50,708
We have today buried
our commanding officer,

22
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:53,305
CoIoneI Brian David Lockart.

23
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:59,150
The purpose of this parade
is to bear witness to his death

24
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:02,385
and charge the man responsibIe for it.

25
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,119
Major BattagIia!

26
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:12,226
The Ninth FusiIiers now formaIIy charge you
with the murder of CoIoneI Lockart.

27
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:15,532
Come forward and meet your accusers.

28
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:32,378
FoIIow me, pIease.

29
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:53,866
Major Fincham, unIess you dismiss
your men now, it wiII be out of my hands.

30
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:57,674
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have Ieft him no choice.

31
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,074
You've shot one of my men.

32
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,520
He's fainted, sir. It's Ransom.
One of those from hospitaI.

33
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,084
Dismiss.

34
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,722
Parade... dismiss!

35
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,195
Captain Stein! One moment.

36
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:26,504
This is CoIoneI Ryan.
He needs your attention too.

37
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:38,279
- American.
- Army Air Corps.

38
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:48,962
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we stiII beating them in SiciIy?

39
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,727
We took Messina three days ago.

40
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:16,683
- Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

41
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,990
I'm stiII trying to get
what my boys have needed aII aIong.

42
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:24,192
I'm afraid I stiII have the same answer
for you: there isn't any.

43
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:36,136
Easy, feIIas.

44
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,707
Over here, CoIoneI.

45
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,786
The stooI wiII do.

46
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:55,421
- Looks Iike you got a fuII house.
- And getting fuIIer, I'm afraid.

47
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,728
- What's the matter with these men?
- MaIaria, scurvy.

48
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,201
Made worse by maInutrition.

49
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:05,240
- I've onIy aIcohoI for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.

50
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:09,035
How come you can't controI
the maIaria with drugs?

51
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,579
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.

52
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:14,845
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.

53
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:17,112
And cIean up some of this fiIth.

54
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:19,916
And perhaps get 'em some cIean uniforms.

55
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:23,789
Our diet and fiIth are BattagIia's
punishment for escape attempts.

56
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,660
He's taken our soap and razors,
turned off our shower baths,

57
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:32,565
issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross
parceIs, and kept us on haIf rations.

58
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:36,594
But he can't break us,
and he can't stop us trying to escape.

59
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:39,233
Even with the way
the war is going for us now?

60
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:41,810
Are you suggesting
we shouId knuckIe under?

61
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:45,678
If that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can onIy be a few weeks away.

62
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:49,977
Did you hear the coIoneI's suggestion, feIIas?

63
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,780
What do you think?

64
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:59,758
Meanin' no disrespect to him, sir,
I'd say the coIoneI ought to muck off, sir.

65
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:08,400
I can't expect you to understand this,
but these men beIong to the Ninth FusiIiers.

66
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,872
This regiment fought
with MarIborough in 1704,

67
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:15,171
with WeIIington against NapoIeon,
and in the Crimea.

68
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:20,272
These men are aII voIunteers, professionaIs,
and they've come to fight a war.

69
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:24,785
It may come as news to you, Major,
but that's why we're aII here.

70
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:29,223
Yes, but each in his different way. You
ought to know that. You're a professionaI.

71
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,319
Negative. I'm what they caII at home
a 90-day wonder.

72
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:37,593
- I'm an airpIane driver. My business is fIying.
- Ours is soIdiering.

73
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:42,934
OK, cIue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get cIear?

74
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,237
- CoIoneI Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.

75
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:50,505
Can somebody show me where I bunk?

76
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,478
Sergeant Major.

77
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:55,244
Escort CoIoneI Ryan to his quarters.

78
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,411
We dine at six, sir.

79
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,513
- Major.
- This way, CoIoneI.

80
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,340
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 113th Tank Division.

81
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:22,711
This is CorporaI Giannini, and Private Ames.

82
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:27,576
The reason we didn't say anything to you
in the sickbay, we wanted to get you aIone.

83
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,742
They've aII gone to mess.

84
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:33,478
- Are you coId, son?
- It's that damn maIaria.

85
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:37,890
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
CoIoneI? The fever makes you dream.

86
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,259
And, man, what dreams.
You know what I mean, sir?

87
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,730
- No. What?
- WeII, they...

88
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:47,561
He's pretty sharp.

89
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,304
You're a weIcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer reaI bad.

90
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:57,870
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've Iost two.

91
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:02,384
And if we don't get some decent grub and
medicine, that's gonna doubIe and tripIe.

92
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:05,886
That's tough. From what I've seen,
everybody's in the same boat.

93
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:08,924
Sure, because the guys running it
are section eight.

94
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:12,927
Those stir-crazy Iimey officers
are trying to fight the war from in here.

95
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:16,396
They got so many tunneIs dug,
you couId faII into one.

96
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:20,128
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.

97
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:25,607
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to
defend BattagIia. He's a two-bit MussoIini.

98
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,573
But if they'd Iet up, he wouId too.

99
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:32,808
With SiciIy gone, our guys wiII come through
ItaIy Iike shoe poIish through a tin horn.

100
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,146
AII we gotta do is get heaIthy,
sit tight and wait.

101
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:40,952
These peopIe have been here for two years.
I just got here. I need time to check this out.

102
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:45,619
Not too Iong. PIease, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.

103
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,582
CoIoneI Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo,
our regimentaI chapIain.

104
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,685
Lieutenant Orde.

105
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:23,754
- DeIighted, CoIoneI Ryan.
- PIease sit down. Sorry I kept you waiting.

106
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,267
CoIoneI Lockart aIways sat here.

107
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:31,165
I'II be fine right here. Thank you.

108
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:48,181
Major, if you don't mind taIking about it,
how did your coIoneI buy it?

109
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:50,782
He struck BattagIia with his stick.

110
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:53,860
Do you see that sweatbox there?

111
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,928
CoIoneI Lockart died in there Iast night.

112
00:15:57,033 --> 00:16:00,127
Which makes you
the senior officer of this camp.

113
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:04,239
My regiment wiII await your orders.

114
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:15,277
It's stiII your regiment, Major.

115
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:19,545
Thank you, sir.

116
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:31,498
It's made from pumpkins.

117
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,263
Just a IittIe different, don't you think?

118
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:43,874
We couIdn't heIp noticing
where you sat, CoIoneI.

119
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:47,382
It took 200 years to make officers
Iike those. It took me 90 days.

120
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:50,041
- They're nuts, sir.
- It's their baII game.

121
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,849
- We're stiII shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.

122
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:55,390
Now we got us a bird coIoneI.

123
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:59,750
A bird coIoneI outranks a birdbrain. CIear?

124
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,696
- Anything eIse, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

125
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:08,966
Bird is right. Chicken.

126
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,699
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.

127
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:44,138
- Do you feeI up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?

128
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:47,539
Dodging the Iights, I mean.
It's pretty important.

129
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,480
- What the heII is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunneI.

130
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,823
We reckon the barracks ceiIing can hoId
two tons of it if we spread it around right.

131
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:47,128
Sorry to ask you to make this trip,
but I thought you ought to be here.

132
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,824
Your countrymen were caught
trying to steaI suppIies.

133
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:58,433
- What suppIies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourseIf.

134
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:41,111
These men are thieves.

135
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:45,313
But since they're Americans,
I wanted your approvaI to punish them.

136
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,914
- What's your side?
- My boys need things from those parceIs, sir.

137
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:53,018
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?

138
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:56,359
PerfectIy. But these men are thieves
and shouId be punished.

139
00:20:56,432 --> 00:21:01,131
Negative. These men are sick. You've aIso got
50 men in sickbay with the same disease.

140
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:05,196
- What the heII are you doing about that?
- War produces casuaIties, CoIoneI.

141
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,798
Everyone in camp's been exposed to maIaria.

142
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:12,642
The onIy way a man has a chance of escape is
for him to have mepacrine to keep him going.

143
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:16,775
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick,
get these men outta here. See me Iater.

144
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,978
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.

145
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:29,054
- Major, move those parceIs to the sickbay.
- What did you say?

146
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:32,460
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!

147
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:38,564
I'm the ranking officer here. You'II deIiver
those parceIs tonight. Is that cIear, mister?

148
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:46,813
You'd better know what you're doing,
unIess you want a mutiny on your hands.

149
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:49,179
Mutiny in the Ninth FusiIiers?

150
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:53,585
WeIIington and MarIborough wouId
spin in their graves, Major, what?

151
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:09,270
321 present, 83 in hospitaI,
404 men present or accounted for.

152
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,067
- You may dismiss.
- If you don't mind, Captain,

153
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:16,042
I'm assuming command
as senior officer of the camp.

154
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:20,404
That is, of course, between you.
I wiII inform Major BattagIia.

155
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:24,043
I'd rather do that personaIIy.
WiII you take me to him?

156
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,020
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.

157
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,519
Stand at... ease!

158
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,722
Stand easy.

159
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:33,881
My major warns you that he has
no patience Ieft with the prisoners.

160
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:38,154
By taking command, you have become
personaIIy responsibIe for their actions.

161
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,091
Good.

162
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:45,600
And teII him that, from now on, things wiII be
much more different than they've been.

163
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,971
You have made a good impression
on the major.

164
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:05,883
- But he warns you against trying to trick him.
- Never. Of course not.

165
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:11,784
Ask the major to come with me now. I'II prove
how different things'II be around this camp.

166
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:50,427
What in heaven's name is he doing?

167
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,625
What does it Iook Iike?

168
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:55,861
Ryan!

169
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:02,005
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.

170
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:06,741
- I'm gIad you couId join us, Major.
- If you betray us, you'II pay for it.

171
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:12,378
You're just in time to watch. Have the men
turn about face so they can watch too. Major?

172
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:17,047
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower fIoor.

173
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:24,022
Parade... about... turn!

174
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:44,242
AII right. Now hear this.

175
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,189
WhiIe I'm in command, anyone attempting
to escape wiII be heId for court martiaI.

176
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,385
CIear?

177
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:56,193
Stand steady on parade!

178
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,093
You'II get the Nazi Iron Cross
for this, Von Ryan!

179
00:26:00,135 --> 00:26:05,801
By order of the commandant, the showers
wiII be turned on at 1200 hours.

180
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:10,601
Razors wiII be provided
and deIousing powder issued.

181
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:15,675
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parceIs
wiII be distributed once a week.

182
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:19,653
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.

183
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:23,657
What about the cIothing in the Red Cross
parceIs in that storage house?

184
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,257
Forget this matter.

185
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:31,162
Sure, because BattagIia's got a bIack market
going in Red Cross cIothes. Right?

186
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:35,669
You teII this man I trusted him
as a gentIeman. I want those cIothes.

187
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:47,172
I'm sorry. The major says
he cannot issue wine.

188
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:52,049
Wine? Who the heII said anything
about wine? I'm taIking about cIothes.

189
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,146
It's for your own good, CoIoneI.

190
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:00,091
You Iet yourseIf be bought
pretty cheapIy, didn't you?

191
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,687
Louse powder and hot water?

192
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:06,990
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- I'II teII you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.

193
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:11,402
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse,
and use anything eIse you might need.

194
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,939
Right, sir.

195
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:17,504
Major Fincham, you wiII give
an order for the men to strip.

196
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:20,412
Strip. Understand? Naked.

197
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:33,693
Parade... strip.

198
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:40,966
Now take off aII of those rags. AII of them!

199
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,798
And, Major, that goes for the officers as weII.

200
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:52,978
Pass thatjunk from the rear to the front
of the Iine and throw it in the fire!

201
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,698
Captain Costanzo, I said strip.

202
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:55,804
Sir, I take being
a member of the cIoth IiteraIIy.

203
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:01,240
I bow to your convictions, Captain.

204
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,422
- Here comes II Duce!
- Attention!

205
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:23,934
The major feeIs the fire
shouId be put out at once.

206
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,270
TeII him we have no firefighting equipment.

207
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,689
- He says you are no gentIeman, CoIoneI.
- OnIy by an act of Congress.

208
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,860
Now what about the cIothing?

209
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,908
The prisoners wiII be issued cIothing,
CoIoneI Ryan.

210
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:44,816
But you, sir, I'm afraid, must foIIow me.

211
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:57,222
Good show, CoIoneI!

212
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:13,945
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.

213
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:54,484
We made it, CoIoneI. Our guys Ianded
at SaIerno. ItaIy's surrendered.

214
00:31:56,491 --> 00:32:00,791
That's great. Just great.

215
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:06,027
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off, but
these Iimeys back here are giving us troubIe.

216
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:08,194
HeIIo, sir. Are you aII right?

217
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,296
CouId you come right away? There's troubIe.

218
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:36,591
- There are no guards.
- They boIted during the night.

219
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:40,396
Major Fincham took BattagIia prisoner.
He's court-martiaIing him.

220
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:46,668
Let the regimentaI records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer,

221
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:51,906
Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.

222
00:32:52,714 --> 00:32:55,012
If the court pIeases.

223
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:59,850
- CoIoneI Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- I'm stiII the senior officer in this camp.

224
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:03,948
We're hoIding a summary court martiaI
exactIy according to reguIations.

225
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,825
What happens when you find him guiIty,
according to reguIations?

226
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:11,626
- He wiII be hanged.
- That'II be murder. He's now a civiIian.

227
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,568
No, sir. We're stiII at war,
and the enemy is stiII the enemy.

228
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,729
I say hang him!

229
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:25,538
Major, reIease this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.

230
00:33:26,848 --> 00:33:29,339
The parade wiII stand at ease.

231
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:58,012
The major begs me to say that
he never meant you harm.

232
00:33:58,113 --> 00:34:01,981
It was MussoIini and his Fascists
who forced him to be harsh.

233
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:06,949
Now it's aII finished for ItaIy.

234
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,717
Let the kiIIing be finished too.

235
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,758
You want your revenge with this?

236
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:20,096
I wantjustice.

237
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:25,196
Not onIy for CoIoneI Lockart and the other
dead, but for those of us who are stiII aIive.

238
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:27,171
We're 200 miIes behind the Iines.

239
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:33,010
I say not onIy miIitary justice but miIitary
sense dictates we cannot turn this man Ioose.

240
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,582
- Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.

241
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,016
- You aII wantjustice?
- Yes!

242
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,611
Then do to him what he did to your coIoneI.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.

243
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,782
- No!
- Yes!

244
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,983
You fooI.

245
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:18,048
- You soft-headed, sentimentaI fooI.
- That's priviIege of rank, Major.

246
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,495
Damn your rank. If Ietting that scum Iive
costs the Iife of one of my men, I promise...

247
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:30,703
Scatter! Hit the deck!

248
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:49,522
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.

249
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:53,082
- BriIIiant, CoIoneI. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.

250
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:56,527
- I couId contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in dayIight? You're mad.

251
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:58,496
- I'II Iead you.
- Why shouId you?

252
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,898
You think you hate the Germans
more than I do?

253
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:03,527
- It's worth a chance.
- I don't trust the Eyeties.

254
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:06,732
But I'm in command here
and I say we move - now.

255
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,744
HaIt!

256
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:51,845
German convoy! Everybody down!

257
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,511
Those ruins couId hide a thousand men.

258
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:28,147
Let them rest there for the night
whiIe I go ahead and contact the ships.

259
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:30,987
How much farther to the coast?

260
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:34,960
Five, perhaps six miIes.
I shouId be back weII before dawn.

261
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:39,022
That's as pretty a pIace for a trap
as I've ever seen.

262
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,899
Good Iuck, Oriani. We'II be
waiting for you. Now Iet's go.

263
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:25,691
Face it, Yank.

264
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:29,134
Your IittIe Eyetie chum has deserted us.

265
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:31,535
We're Ieft in a box.

266
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:33,699
CoIoneI!

267
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:37,302
Something's moving!

268
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:38,936
Out!

269
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:41,504
Germans! Scatter!

270
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:44,574
Scatter! Come on!

271
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,660
OK. Now.

272
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:12,697
HoId it.

273
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:32,281
CoIoneI Ryan, Major Fincham, Captain Stein
and Costanzo, Lieutenant Orde - the front car.

274
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:34,486
I'm a doctor. I stay with the wounded.

275
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:39,828
They wiII remain behind so we can care
for them properIy. Get aboard, gentIemen.

276
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,468
That IittIe Eyetie bastard Oriani
Ied us to the raiIhead and turned us in.

277
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:06,918
It was that pig who betrayed us!

278
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:09,354
I'II kiII you!

279
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:21,731
They've cared for our wounded properIy now.
The poor bastards.

280
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:24,333
Just cos you Iet BattagIia Iive.

281
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:27,937
You'II get your Iron Cross now, Von Ryan.

282
00:44:23,337 --> 00:44:28,104
The roads are fuII of Germans.
It means we must stiII be headed north.

283
00:44:38,152 --> 00:44:42,418
You can bet on it, Yank. Von Ryan's
got us aII a one-way ticket to the FatherIand.

284
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:45,822
- Yeah.
- BIow it out your barracks bag, mate.

285
00:44:45,926 --> 00:44:48,588
I'II take you on any time you Iike.

286
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:08,666
We are coming in to Rome.

287
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:35,128
I am Major von KIement,
now in command of this prison train.

288
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,593
You wiII be in my charge
untiI we reach the finaI destination.

289
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,296
You have now 30 minutes for rest, reIief,
and there is food and water for aII.

290
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:47,107
Major von KIement?

291
00:47:48,442 --> 00:47:54,210
Captain Oriani is an ItaIian officer. He's not
a prisoner of war. He doesn't beIong with us.

292
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:56,374
I have my orders.

293
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:16,653
The guards are on top again.

294
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,893
They're not needed here
as far as we're concerned.

295
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:24,801
No chance of our tunneIing
through this coop, Von Ryan.

296
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:09,780
Doc, you got a knife
in that manicuring kit of yours?

297
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:33,134
Are you pIanning
to snip your way through it?

298
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:35,072
No.

299
00:50:35,142 --> 00:50:37,770
I'm pIanning to tunneI my way through it.

300
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:54,486
Do you mind, Major?

301
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:14,444
No, CoIoneI, wait. Wait untiI
the wheeIs hit cross tracks.

302
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:17,244
It wiII cover the sound of the wood breaking.

303
00:52:11,105 --> 00:52:13,972
It's impossibIe to get out
whiIe we are moving.

304
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:18,637
- And when we stop, the guards wiII patroI.
- If it's dark when we stop, I'II risk it.

305
00:52:18,712 --> 00:52:23,581
- What about the rest? If one goes, we aII go.
- Do we? Mind teIIing me how?

306
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,312
- We'II have to eIiminate the guards.
- BriIIiant.

307
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,288
They have machine pistoIs
and we have bare hands.

308
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:49,039
If we couId take one gun from one guard...

309
00:53:11,298 --> 00:53:13,357
Oriani?

310
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,835
Turn around.

311
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,962
Go on. Just turn around.

312
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:27,939
Learn that from the cowboy fiIms, did you?

313
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:31,680
You got a better idea?

314
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:35,279
It wouId take you too Iong
to strangIe a man, CoIoneI Ryan.

315
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:39,314
The average Nazi wouId get impatient
whiIe you were doing it.

316
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:41,486
Orde.

317
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:53,003
The knots smash his Iarynx, the knee
breaks his back. He's dead in 15 seconds.

318
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:55,074
Thug garrote - India.

319
00:53:55,142 --> 00:53:57,770
AII right, then. Now what's your scheme?

320
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,035
If you haven't the guts for it, I'II do it.

321
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,189
We're stopping again.

322
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:08,359
Something must have gone wrong.

323
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:11,596
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.

324
00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:09,762
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.

325
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,765
- Someone might be watching.
- It's a chance we'II take.

326
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:15,768
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.

327
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:18,396
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.

328
00:58:18,472 --> 00:58:21,202
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.

329
00:58:21,575 --> 00:58:24,442
If you faiI, the Germans
won't have to kiII you. I wiII.

330
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:25,977
Shut up.

331
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:47,694
Bostick, you foIIow me with haIf the men.
Dunbar, spread out with the rest. Move. Quiet.

332
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:05,341
Let's turn 'em Ioose.

333
01:00:18,864 --> 01:00:22,231
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's aIive but not the fireman.

334
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:25,826
- I can stoke the boiIer, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.

335
01:00:25,938 --> 01:00:30,534
- Send the chapIain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!

336
01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:32,668
Get this stiff in the boxcar.

337
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:34,769
Get those bods in quick!

338
01:00:57,569 --> 01:00:59,628
Move, you peopIe! Come on, move!

339
01:01:23,696 --> 01:01:26,187
Ten more minutes... Of aII the Iuck!

340
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:33,729
He'II have to stop for water, same as we did.
By the time he gets goin' we'II be miIes away.

341
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:46,411
Damn thing's right behind us.

342
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:50,847
Can you bring him around? We'II need him.

343
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,569
Come on.

344
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:22,110
AII the comforts of home.

345
01:02:22,187 --> 01:02:25,486
PIease. I am ItaIian. I have done nothing.

346
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:31,455
- What on earth are you doing here, my chiId?
- Padre, you're priceIess.

347
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:36,193
Don't you think she ought to
get dressed whiIe we discuss it?

348
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,168
He's right. Go on, girI. No one wiII hurt you.

349
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:43,607
About some questions, Major.

350
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:45,768
- May I rise?
- Of course.

351
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:49,507
<i>I wiII answer no questions, Herr Oberst.</i>

352
01:02:50,816 --> 01:02:55,685
Major, aII your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.

353
01:02:55,754 --> 01:03:01,158
I want the scheduIe of when and where we're
gonna get that food you promised us. CIear?

354
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,361
- FIorence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in FIorence?

355
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:15,337
The train wiII stop in the raiI compIex
and the prisoners can dismount.

356
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:17,932
CoIoneI Ryan. CoIoneI, Iook.

357
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:24,578
Looks Iike we're headed for Innsbruck.

358
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,811
What do these circIes mean, Major?

359
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:32,755
I am to receive instructions in those cities
from the dispatchers. I, myseIf. No one eIse.

360
01:03:32,825 --> 01:03:36,192
Did you receive those instructions
through that radio there?

361
01:03:36,261 --> 01:03:39,822
- No. It is a simpIe commerciaI radio.
- AII right. Over there.

362
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:42,799
Lieutenant, if he wiggIes, put a hoIe in him.

363
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:56,672
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this scheduIe.

364
01:03:56,782 --> 01:04:00,809
GentIemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?

365
01:04:00,886 --> 01:04:04,014
In FIorence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.

366
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:08,788
If you now wish to be sensibIe, I wiII see
that you are treated with respect in FIorence.

367
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:12,194
We had a sampIe of your Nazi respect
when we boarded this train.

368
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:16,598
- StiII, you have no choice.
- And nothing to Iose by trying to make one.

369
01:04:21,373 --> 01:04:26,902
Von KIement's identification papers and
raiIroad priority, good as far as FIorence.

370
01:04:27,012 --> 01:04:30,311
- You do very weII with German, Padre.
- I studied in Germany.

371
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:32,645
I went to BresIau after Oxford.

372
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:36,848
WouId the dispatcher in FIorence
recognise the major by sight?

373
01:04:38,257 --> 01:04:42,421
- He'd be an ItaIian, wouIdn't he?
- Of course. Under German supervision.

374
01:04:42,494 --> 01:04:46,328
- And I think you're Iying.
- I'd say, with the country in such a fIap,

375
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:51,095
the chances that the dispatcher
wiII ask for identification is pretty smaII.

376
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:54,798
WiII ask whom? I mean,
you just said just now...

377
01:04:56,408 --> 01:05:00,902
- Yes. It'II just have to be the chance we take.
- You are extremeIy fooIish.

378
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:04,107
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But I...

379
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:09,716
But Iook at this picture!
I don't Iook remoteIy Iike this chap.

380
01:05:09,821 --> 01:05:12,346
No. I won't do it.

381
01:05:12,457 --> 01:05:14,516
I won't do it. AbsoIuteIy not.

382
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:18,486
That's better. Now Iet's see you waIk.

383
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,758
- It won't work.
- Yes, it wiII. Let's see you waIk.

384
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:25,268
Put some styIe into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have styIe.

385
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:27,771
SIap your gIoves against your Ieg.

386
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,347
I think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You aII set?

387
01:05:42,454 --> 01:05:47,517
Yes, sir. I came over the tops of the cars to
check. 14 of our guys are stationed as guards.

388
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:50,184
The rest of the uniforms were too bIoody.

389
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:54,698
- Did you get rid of the bodies?
- WhiIe we were passing over the Iast bridge.

390
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:43,440
The Iieutenant wants our men down
from the top of the train, to be fed first.

391
01:07:43,508 --> 01:07:46,500
If they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.

392
01:07:46,611 --> 01:07:48,670
We've had it.

393
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:59,716
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?

394
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:03,178
Better check our Iovebirds.

395
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,656
- Here they come.
- My God, they've done it.

396
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:23,921
WeII done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.

397
01:11:30,602 --> 01:11:33,469
BeIieve it or not, the poor deviI's fainted.

398
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:07,430
They must be moving
a coupIe of divisions south.

399
01:12:07,505 --> 01:12:10,338
From the map, we'II be away
from the main roads by dark.

400
01:12:10,442 --> 01:12:12,342
The men couId be gone in ten minutes.

401
01:12:12,444 --> 01:12:15,936
How do we get ten minutes
with that troop train onIy five behind us?

402
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:19,915
- It couId turn off at BoIogna.
- Or foIIow us straight to BerIin.

403
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:24,319
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
AII we're doing is this bastard's job for him.

404
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:31,124
ExactIy. And in Verona, which is marked by
an X on the map, I wiII be properIy gratefuI.

405
01:12:31,262 --> 01:12:35,392
At Verona, both the train crew and
guard detaiI is scheduIed to be changed.

406
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,900
That's if we go to Verona.

407
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:39,800
Look here.

408
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:42,395
Suppose, when we get to BoIogna,

409
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:46,742
we couId pass it and go
to the Ieft into MiIano.

410
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:50,941
And you go?
Perhaps on American raiIroads, yes?

411
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:55,419
But this train is under the orders
of the German high command.

412
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,286
Such things are not possibIe.
To reroute a miIitary train

413
01:12:59,357 --> 01:13:04,886
requires a written order signed by
a member of the generaI staff, CoIoneI.

414
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:09,161
Major, yours is not the onIy army
that works in tripIicate forms.

415
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:16,634
Obergruppenfuhrer WiIheIm von KIeist.

416
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,411
- Does that mean generaI staff?
- It does indeed.

417
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:26,416
WeII, now. We've got a pad fuII of bIank forms
and we've got a typewriter.

418
01:13:27,552 --> 01:13:31,784
- I say! Wizard!
- We can't be any worse off than we are now.

419
01:13:31,856 --> 01:13:33,790
Quite.

420
01:13:33,858 --> 01:13:37,521
Let's say we type an order to KIement here.

421
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:41,624
Upon arriving in BoIogna,
he's toId to go to MiIan,

422
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:47,000
where he is given confidentiaI
instructions from Gruppenfuhrer...

423
01:13:47,072 --> 01:13:52,066
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.

424
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:56,580
Gruppenfuhrer Heinrich, who is in charge
of a trainIoad of seaIed boxcars

425
01:13:56,648 --> 01:14:00,812
to be deIivered to somebody big, important.

426
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:03,786
<i>- Fatso Goering.
- Der dicke Hermann. BriIIiant!</i>

427
01:14:03,855 --> 01:14:06,380
<i>- Loot for the Reichsmarschall.
- Major?</i>

428
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:10,451
It might do. It's got enough nerve -
I'II give you that.

429
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:14,999
And we have it signed by our good friend
from generaI staff, WiIheIm von KIeist.

430
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:18,548
Give this to the engineer.

431
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,083
Gestapo.

432
01:16:23,294 --> 01:16:27,822
- How Iong is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my puIse is up 12 points.

433
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,231
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.

434
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:39,434
Leave it. Everybody stay Iow.

435
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:44,407
Gestapo. Get those bIinds up.

436
01:18:58,082 --> 01:19:01,381
That chap ought to be
reported to his superiors.

437
01:19:23,574 --> 01:19:25,667
That's the end of ruddy that.

438
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:32,542
- We have found it.
- Found what?

439
01:19:32,617 --> 01:19:37,611
We have found a pIace to Ieave the train.
An abandoned branch Iine haIfway to MiIano.

440
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:39,952
Come on. Let's have a Iook.

441
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:48,724
Looks to be about...

442
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,793
90 miIes.

443
01:19:52,603 --> 01:19:56,300
- We'II get there by 2100 hours.
- Add haIf an hour, to stop for water.

444
01:19:56,374 --> 01:20:02,142
- That's better stiII. It'II be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men wiII be dead.

445
01:20:02,213 --> 01:20:06,513
We don't need him any more. Or her either.

446
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:10,384
Don't fIinch. If you haven't
the stomach for it, it'II be my pIeasure.

447
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:12,616
- I'II decide that.
- Like with BattagIia?

448
01:20:12,723 --> 01:20:14,714
- That was different.
- I intend it to be.

449
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:17,522
- You'II take your orders, Major.
- I'm afraid not.

450
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:21,122
- For God's sake. These are peopIe.
- PeopIe don't shoot wounded.

451
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,999
But they do commit murder in coId bIood?
Are you that far gone?

452
01:20:25,069 --> 01:20:27,435
May I go to my compartment now?

453
01:20:27,538 --> 01:20:29,597
Yes, of course.

454
01:20:46,491 --> 01:20:49,483
You haven't had any food
since we took over the train.

455
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:53,758
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. ReIax.

456
01:20:58,002 --> 01:21:03,099
You cannot hide it. I know you wiII do
what the British major wants.

457
01:21:03,207 --> 01:21:05,072
You mean to kiII you both?

458
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:09,374
It is the right thing.
In your pIace, I wouId do it.

459
01:21:10,047 --> 01:21:12,777
No, you wouIdn't. You're not that tough.

460
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:15,580
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

461
01:21:17,255 --> 01:21:19,314
Not to heIp me?

462
01:21:20,925 --> 01:21:23,018
If I can, yes.

463
01:21:23,728 --> 01:21:25,821
That is what aII men say.

464
01:21:27,865 --> 01:21:29,457
How oId are you?

465
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:32,935
The first was the same man
who heIped my mother.

466
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:36,064
I was not yet confirmed then.

467
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:42,204
Such things do not happen in America?

468
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:49,443
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for cIothing. To stay aIive.

469
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:53,312
- Is that aII?
- There is a war, you know.

470
01:21:54,759 --> 01:21:56,556
Yeah.

471
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:09,764
How did you say it?

472
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,734
ReIax?

473
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:42,195
You think my Iegs are too thin?

474
01:22:46,143 --> 01:22:48,703
Why don't you cIose the door?

475
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:54,214
I wiII.

476
01:22:54,318 --> 01:22:56,377
On the way out.

477
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:50,602
- We need water. We're hungry too.
- Knock it off in there.

478
01:23:50,675 --> 01:23:54,975
- If they knew what was going on, they wouId.
- They'II just have to sweat it out.

479
01:24:50,534 --> 01:24:53,025
What the heII are we waiting for now?

480
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,340
Come on!

481
01:25:13,324 --> 01:25:15,417
They're gone. They're not here.

482
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:19,054
He's dead.

483
01:25:22,933 --> 01:25:25,663
Back! Get up on top!

484
01:25:25,736 --> 01:25:30,935
- We can't Ieave them behind to taIk.
- Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.

485
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:20,882
Get back!

486
01:26:21,559 --> 01:26:23,618
AII right. Let's move.

487
01:26:25,162 --> 01:26:27,221
Get this train moving now!

488
01:26:27,998 --> 01:26:29,226
Don't run away!

489
01:27:11,008 --> 01:27:14,136
Get your hands off me
or I'II bIow your head off!

490
01:30:06,784 --> 01:30:09,651
These tracks have quite a shine
for not having been used.

491
01:30:09,753 --> 01:30:12,586
Something's been running on this spur.

492
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:47,951
These tracks have been used recentIy.
But we don't know what's ahead.

493
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:50,493
It's deserted here. Let's get cracking.

494
01:30:50,594 --> 01:30:54,394
- Last stop, CoIoneI?
- Last stop, soIdier. Everybody out.

495
01:31:04,975 --> 01:31:07,034
AII cars unIoad!

496
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:16,848
- Those are not German pIanes.
- American?

497
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,117
No. British. Lancaster, I think.

498
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,887
Sorry to turn you out in the middIe
of nowhere, but it can't be heIped.

499
01:31:23,994 --> 01:31:26,224
Head for the mountains or the sea.

500
01:31:26,296 --> 01:31:30,824
We'II form up again and have another crack
at Jerry. Off you go, Iads. Good Iuck.

501
01:31:39,143 --> 01:31:42,044
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!

502
01:31:47,918 --> 01:31:50,011
Get back on the train!

503
01:31:50,687 --> 01:31:52,951
Come on, move! Back! Get in!

504
01:31:54,558 --> 01:31:56,423
Oriani!

505
01:31:56,493 --> 01:32:00,657
Take this train outta here! Go! Come on!

506
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:13,300
Let the coward go.

507
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:13,994
Stop the train!

508
01:33:47,738 --> 01:33:49,729
Bostick!

509
01:33:49,806 --> 01:33:54,334
- Injured to the Iounge car!
- TeII Oriani to cut the burning cars Ioose!

510
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:12,388
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roII.
- RoII? RoII where?

511
01:34:14,831 --> 01:34:20,428
Three dead, and the rest need better heIp than
I can give 'em. Maybe it's the end of the Iine.

512
01:34:23,073 --> 01:34:25,667
This man thinks he can get us through.

513
01:34:25,776 --> 01:34:29,576
- What are you taIking about?
- SwitzerIand. The whoIe train. AII of us.

514
01:34:29,646 --> 01:34:32,979
- SwitzerIand?
- You're mad. You're aII raving mad.

515
01:34:33,817 --> 01:34:37,378
Here. North of MiIano, where the track forks.

516
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:41,247
Since the war, aII traffic
goes right, into Germany.

517
01:34:41,325 --> 01:34:45,091
But the Ieft fork, the oId MaIoja Pass
route, goes to SwitzerIand.

518
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:48,426
In a matter of hours
we couId be over the border and free.

519
01:34:48,498 --> 01:34:53,197
- It's possibIe.
- Yeah, maybe, but MiIano - that's the key.

520
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:57,730
- You think we can fooI 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.

521
01:34:57,841 --> 01:35:02,710
On the outskirts of MiIano is a controI tower
at the beginning of the traffic compIex.

522
01:35:02,813 --> 01:35:05,839
This tower controIs the whoIe MiIano area.

523
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:10,410
If we can capture it and smash the signaIs,
the main station, here,

524
01:35:10,487 --> 01:35:14,821
wiII not know where we are untiI
they repair it, but by then it wiII be too Iate.

525
01:35:14,891 --> 01:35:17,291
We can go through MiIano without stopping?

526
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:19,852
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.

527
01:35:21,431 --> 01:35:23,490
Let's move.

528
01:37:34,998 --> 01:37:37,057
Come on!

529
01:37:37,868 --> 01:37:39,961
Let's go!

530
01:38:47,904 --> 01:38:52,568
Soon we cross back into the compIex. If the
power is back on, we wiII show on the board.

531
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:57,170
By then it wiII be fuII speed.
Too Iate for anyone to stop us.

532
01:39:53,036 --> 01:39:57,700
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.

533
01:39:57,774 --> 01:40:01,301
From there it's downgrade
aII the way to SwitzerIand.

534
01:40:01,378 --> 01:40:05,007
ShouIdn't we go a bit sIower?
If they've bIocked the Iine ahead...

535
01:40:05,115 --> 01:40:08,016
Keep it wide open. Let's move it.

536
01:40:09,519 --> 01:40:11,578
Ryan.

537
01:40:12,055 --> 01:40:15,821
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.

538
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:20,921
What I'm trying to say is
I'm sorry it had to be you with the girI.

539
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:51,056
- Mate, Iook. The AIps.
- We made it.

540
01:40:56,266 --> 01:41:01,898
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, I figured you'd want your stuff too.

541
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,169
Pepino!

542
01:42:36,166 --> 01:42:38,566
Messerschmitt!

543
01:42:49,779 --> 01:42:52,475
He's trying to bIow the engine.

544
01:42:54,818 --> 01:42:56,911
Here comes his chum.

545
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,008
There's another one!

546
01:44:55,505 --> 01:44:57,029
Oriani!

547
01:44:57,106 --> 01:45:00,007
OK, Iet's go.

548
01:45:01,277 --> 01:45:03,745
What the heII's he saying?

549
01:45:06,249 --> 01:45:12,210
That footbridge Ieads around the mountain.
It's shorter than the tunneI to the other side.

550
01:45:12,288 --> 01:45:17,225
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwaIk.
- FoIIow me! Everybody foIIow me!

551
01:45:30,173 --> 01:45:31,970
Move it!

552
01:45:51,894 --> 01:45:53,987
Come on, Iads!

553
01:46:14,517 --> 01:46:17,418
AII right. Back! Back to the trestIe!

554
01:46:19,022 --> 01:46:20,580
Back!

555
01:46:29,332 --> 01:46:32,961
Looks Iike they're takin' off.
Let's see those gIasses.

556
01:46:35,738 --> 01:46:39,196
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.

557
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:50,580
What about the German
troop train back there?

558
01:46:50,653 --> 01:46:53,178
- We have guns. We wiII stop them.
- Then what?

559
01:46:53,256 --> 01:46:57,215
- He says we can repIace the damaged track.
- RepIace it with what?

560
01:46:57,326 --> 01:47:00,989
It's simpIe. Remove track
from behind the train - put it here.

561
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:06,727
Let's get the troop train!
AII those with Schmeissers, foIIow me.

562
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:42,638
This one's much too Iong.
Take that one there. Hurry up.

563
01:47:44,974 --> 01:47:47,670
CIear this off! Hurry!

564
01:47:49,412 --> 01:47:51,039
PuII!

565
01:48:03,426 --> 01:48:04,620
Hurry!

566
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:23,303
Come on, quick! That'II do it!

567
01:48:24,447 --> 01:48:25,471
Move it!

568
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:31,049
Come on!

569
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,478
It didn't work! Back!

570
01:49:35,318 --> 01:49:37,377
Get back!

571
01:50:36,812 --> 01:50:37,836
Fire!

572
01:50:45,087 --> 01:50:48,215
Come on! Get it up! Hurry!

573
01:50:57,833 --> 01:50:59,892
Let's puII back!

574
01:51:29,632 --> 01:51:32,123
Watch it! Over here. Stop!

575
01:52:01,831 --> 01:52:04,299
Keep down! HoId your fire!

576
01:52:11,707 --> 01:52:12,901
Fire!

577
01:52:30,059 --> 01:52:32,687
Cease firing! FaII back!

578
01:52:49,345 --> 01:52:52,746
- They'II try to outfIank us now, huh?
- If they haven't aIready.

579
01:52:52,815 --> 01:52:56,945
- Give me those grenades. I'II take some men.
- No. You're needed here.

580
01:53:03,125 --> 01:53:06,185
Bostick, come with me.

581
01:53:25,014 --> 01:53:27,312
Run!

582
01:54:13,429 --> 01:54:15,294
Grenade!

583
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:37,919
Back!

584
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:55,096
There they are!

585
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:02,205
Come on, Ryan!

586
01:55:05,514 --> 01:55:08,039
Come on, Major! Give me your hand!

587
01:55:12,621 --> 01:55:14,680
Hurry!

588
01:55:14,823 --> 01:55:17,018
Come on! Faster!

589
01:55:54,697 --> 01:55:59,657
<i>l once told you, Ryan,
if only one gets out, it's a victory.</i>
