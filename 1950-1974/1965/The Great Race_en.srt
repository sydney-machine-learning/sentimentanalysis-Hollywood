1
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,411
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,552
...you are about to witness
the most spectacular feat...

3
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:06,417
...ever attempted by the greatest daredevil
in the world.

4
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,790
The Great Leslie.

5
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:24,869
He will be strapped in a straitjacket
before your very eyes...

6
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,339
...and lifted up into the clouds...

7
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,749
...where eagles soar and
no sparrow dares to venture.

8
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,546
Hey, bull's-eye.

9
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:16,480
There's a hole in the balloon.

10
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:41,179
- He'll never make it.
- He'll never make it.

11
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,603
- A parachute.
- A parachute.

12
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,482
A parachute!

13
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:19,711
A parachute!

14
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:20,952
What?

15
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:36,035
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to witness a feat...

16
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:40,401
...so dangerous that only one man
would dare attempt it.

17
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:44,638
The Magnificent Professor Fate.

18
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,055
Attach the hooks.

19
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,060
The professor will defy death
as his assistant...

20
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,995
...swoops down from the sky,
snares the professor...

21
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:08,263
...on the ground and lifts him into the air.

22
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,137
Contact.

23
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,836
Switch on.

24
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,210
Up, Max! Bring it up!

25
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:31,978
Coming up.

26
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:38,189
Max, up, you idiot! Up!

27
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,592
She's up!

28
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,326
Up, you idiot, up!

29
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:49,002
Too much weight.

30
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,762
I'd like to see The Great Leslie try that one.

31
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,351
After today you will have broken
every existing speed record.

32
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,149
What are your future plans?

33
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:45,556
That depends on my success today.
Gentlemen, will you excuse me please?

34
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,204
Be careful, you idiot,
you'll blow us both to kingdom come.

35
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,720
He's getting in the boat.

36
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,146
- You sure you tested the mechanism?
- It can't miss.

37
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,680
All you have to do is throw this switch,
it homes in on the loudest engine noise.

38
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,554
You see, it's picked up Leslie's boat!

39
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:58,657
Farewell, Leslie.

40
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:00,858
Away.

41
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:11,371
Golly!

42
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,268
Look at the pretty face on that...

43
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,002
Get away from there.

44
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,224
I intend to cover the measured mile
in approximately twelve seconds.

45
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,809
Activate the rockets.

46
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,662
One hundred and fifty!

47
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,866
Two hundred and fifty!

48
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:24,376
- I'll go down in history!
- Three hundred.

49
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:26,842
They'll erect a monument to me!

50
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,016
I've done it!

51
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,648
- Professor? Professor?
- What?

52
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:33,903
Well, there's another one Leslie
can try on for size.

53
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,148
Gentlemen.

54
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:42,845
I've requested this meeting in order
to make you a proposition.

55
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,492
In my opinion your company manufactures
the finest automobile in the world.

56
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:54,767
The automobile represents progress,
in the most profound sense of the word.

57
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:58,862
The ultimate example
of American ingenuity and enterprise.

58
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,942
This great nation cannot take a back seat
to competitors like Daimler...

59
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:09,310
...Mercedes, Napier, Rolls-Royce,
Dietrich or Panhard.

60
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:15,150
Gentlemen, I propose to prove
that the American automobile...

61
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:19,458
...your automobile, is without peers.

62
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:24,626
And just how do you propose
to prove that, sir?

63
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,664
A race.

64
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,063
Really, sir, you surprise me.

65
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:34,135
Automobile races
are becoming most commonplace.

66
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:38,169
I mean, a long race. A very long race.

67
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,978
Buffalo to Albany? It's been done.

68
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,647
Chicago to Cleveland? That's been done.

69
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:47,513
New York...

70
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:55,421
...to Paris?

71
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:02,201
You must build an automobile
to the most precise specifications.

72
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,068
Absolutely no!

73
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:12,105
For a company of this repute,
a great company the likes of this one...

74
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,177
...entrusting its entire automobile future
to a man like Leslie, it's disreputable.

75
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:22,052
A cheap carnival performer,
a fraud, a trickster.

76
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,925
Help! Don't! A madman!

77
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,225
I apologize.
I thought you were someone else.

78
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:32,424
Pulling it out by the roots. I warned you.

79
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,596
The madman. Did you see him trying
to pull my beard out by the roots?

80
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,538
Leslie will lose!
Your automobile will lose! I will win!

81
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:51,615
He jumped!

82
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,384
I shall build the greatest automobile
in the world and I shall win!

83
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:01,090
Okay, Professor.

84
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:05,728
This time it will not be Leslie.
It will be I, Professor Fate!

85
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,465
Fate the Magnificent!

86
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:25,406
And it is with no little pride
that the Webber Motor Car Company...

87
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,476
...unveils its latest
and greatest achievement.

88
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,545
Gentlemen, behold the motor car
of the future!

89
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:38,850
Holy cow!

90
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,500
Holy Toledo, look at that car!

91
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,162
Yes, it's quite a car.

92
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,887
- I never saw a car like that in my life.
- You never will again either.

93
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,891
Give me the bomb.

94
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:18,030
Professor, be careful.

95
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:21,192
After you activate the mechanism,
you only got ten seconds.

96
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:24,066
I know that. Give me the cord.

97
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:41,448
We have taken the liberty of naming it
after the man who inspired its creation.

98
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:44,914
- The Leslie Special.
- I'm deeply honored.

99
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,441
What took you so long?

100
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:48,852
I had to go to the Rolls-Royce agency.
I had to steal a spare magneto.

101
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,187
It's ready.

102
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,951
Yes, it's ready.

103
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,267
There has never been anything like this.

104
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,461
- Professor, your greatest creation.
- The work of genius.

105
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,633
The finest parts from the greatest
automobiles in the world.

106
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,404
The Hannibal Twin 8.

107
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:15,243
When the blizzards and snow storms come,
we will continue on just as planned.

108
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,340
Push the button, Max.

109
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,024
When the rains come,
and when the snow melts...

110
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,358
...we shall continue to rise above it.

111
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,364
Push the button, Max!

112
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:44,374
Nature will chase us, we will beat her.

113
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,446
And brigands, thieves, cutthroats
of all nations may hound us.

114
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:52,349
But we are ready for them.
We will blast them to kingdom come!

115
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,584
We can melt, we can blast.
We can rise above! We are invincible!

116
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,416
Take us down.

117
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,822
Push the button, Max.

118
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,064
Yes.

119
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,876
- Mr. Goodbody.
- What is it, Frisbee?

120
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,249
- You have to come.
- What's the matter?

121
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,220
Well, it's a young lady, sir.

122
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,687
- What about the young lady?
- She's handcuffed herself to the door.

123
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:35,921
- Handcuffed herself to the door?
- Of the men's room.

124
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:37,557
What?

125
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:48,500
Gentleman!

126
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,908
Return to your assignments.
This is a newspaper office.

127
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:54,607
There will be no lollygagging
in this hallway.

128
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:57,476
There will be no lollygagging
in this hallway.

129
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,416
Now, young lady, who are you?

130
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:02,455
I am a female past the age of consent.

131
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:05,287
I'm the first woman to edit
the newspaper at my college.

132
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,592
I'll remain handcuffed until I'm the first
female reporter of The New York Sentinel.

133
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:13,690
Over my dead body.
Unlock those handcuffs and get out.

134
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,429
I will unlock the handcuffs
when you give me the job.

135
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:17,231
Never!

136
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:18,696
- Never?
- Never.

137
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:24,103
But, sir, if she remains here,
handcuffed to the men's room.

138
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,142
You men may use the washroom
on the next floor.

139
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,716
- They can't keep running upstairs forever.
- They can until you get hungry.

140
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,586
That would make a story
for your competition.

141
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:40,252
Woman starves to death in the men's room
of The New York Sentinel.

142
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:44,091
- You wouldn't dare.
- I would dare anything for women's rights.

143
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,937
- Give me an assignment. If I fail, fire me.
- You're fired.

144
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,939
Frisbee, post a bulletin.
Suffragettes are not permitted.

145
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:01,739
- Let me cover the great race.
- It's covered by experienced reporters.

146
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,080
No, I mean really cover it.
From start to finish, mile by mile.

147
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,418
Reporters are not permitted on the trip,
only contestants. Those are the rules.

148
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,356
We run a newspaper,
not a school for revolutionaries!

149
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:14,519
Enter the race. Enter your own car.

150
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:18,490
We are running a newspaper, a newspaper,
not an automotive agency!

151
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,035
Are you afraid of losing?
Give me the money and I'll enter the race.

152
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:24,366
I despise suffragettes.

153
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,606
I am not just trying to get
the vote for women.

154
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:32,008
I'll emancipate them from
the drudgery of being servants or saints.

155
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:36,739
Out of the laundry rooms
and off the pedestals!

156
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,509
You're mad, young woman, you're mad!

157
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:43,249
And you, sir, are a slave
to your puritanism.

158
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,684
Does your wife wear silk stockings?

159
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,787
- I won't discuss such an intimate subject.
- She does, and they're very expensive.

160
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,731
But has she raised her skirts
for you and shown her calf?

161
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,133
A woman's leg in a silk stocking
can be quite alluring.

162
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,402
Maggie Dubois.

163
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:02,306
You've never seen
a woman's leg in a silk stocking.

164
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,537
Never, never in your whole life.

165
00:25:06,446 --> 00:25:08,607
Frisbee, leave the room!

166
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,811
What are you thinking?

167
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:19,926
There isn't anything men and women
can't discuss when civilized and mature.

168
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:21,358
And emancipated.

169
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:25,561
- Anything.
- You can't discuss it. That's the problem.

170
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:28,760
Women have to emancipate themselves
in order to emancipate men.

171
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:31,736
So they can emancipate each other
where it counts the most.

172
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:34,569
Fifty dollars for every exclusive story
I send back...

173
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,269
...and a hundred dollars
for every photograph.

174
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,174
You're a fine man.
A timid man, but a worthwhile one.

175
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:46,516
Have a cigar.

176
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:49,554
Don't smoke?

177
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,239
The Sentinel will scoop the world!

178
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,542
Man the helm!

179
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:51,648
Aye, aye, sir.

180
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,647
- Up periscope!
- Up periscope!

181
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,726
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

182
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,964
I don't know what she's doing here, boss.
She says she's a woman with a mission.

183
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,370
But I think she's a spy for Professor Fate.

184
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:52,605
You're not suggesting I'm the first woman
to ever seek an audience with Great Leslie.

185
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,013
I'm simply Leslie and I'm at your service.

186
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,683
I'm rather thirsty.
Do you have something cold?

187
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:04,317
I have champagne.

188
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,761
- Down periscope.
- Aye, aye, sir.

189
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,065
Up, idiot! Up, up!

190
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,110
I got you.

191
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:38,619
There's something wrong
with the mechanism.

192
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:42,058
Down, you idiot!

193
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:45,121
Release your feet. Release your feet!

194
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:49,763
- You have to be careful...
- You've got a brain the size of a carbuncle.

195
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,461
Get out of here before Leslie spots us!

196
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,467
Dive, crash dive!

197
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:58,739
Help!

198
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:04,348
Wait. Professor!

199
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:42,046
I'm a reporter.

200
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:45,750
A reporter?

201
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:48,685
You disapprove?

202
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:53,448
No. Let's say I'm a bit surprised.

203
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:55,954
Let's be honest and say you disapprove.

204
00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:00,022
A woman doing a man's job is competitive,
both sexually and economically.

205
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:05,765
You want to know why I'm here.
I want to report the race and be in it.

206
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,767
It's as simple as that.

207
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,202
Well, it's hardly that simple. But...

208
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:18,180
...let's discuss it, shall we?

209
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:22,644
Let's discuss the whole thing completely.
Right from the beginning.

210
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:27,386
Do you want a wife, a companion?
Or just a woman?

211
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,189
There are certain things
we shouldn't discuss.

212
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:35,064
Why? Men discuss their relationships
with women.

213
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:37,233
Gentlemen don't.

214
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,372
But I'm not a gentleman. I'm a woman.

215
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,109
Indeed you are.

216
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:48,981
Then say it. What's expected of me?

217
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:52,376
I'm an emancipated woman
and you're an emancipated man.

218
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,983
There are things that should remain
implicit between men and women.

219
00:31:58,525 --> 00:31:59,685
Why?

220
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,255
It's been this way for years
and I see no reason to change.

221
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,129
- I am a creature of habit.
- All the more reason.

222
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,135
Now you're using
your female attractiveness as a weapon.

223
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:17,737
Equality, real equality
of the sexes bothers you, doesn't it.

224
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,710
I can speak, read and write Russian,
French and Arabic.

225
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:25,876
Yes, so can I. Plus five other languages.

226
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:28,887
- I can drive any car there is.
- So can Hezekiah.

227
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,822
I won the
Woman's International Competition.

228
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,827
En garde.

229
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,656
Very well.

230
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:15,567
Now if you'd won the
Men's International Fencing Competition...

231
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:23,665
Now, we'll talk this out.

232
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,685
Now if you'll excuse me.

233
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:47,659
Hezekiah, see Miss Dubois
to her horse please.

234
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,396
You're afraid!
You're afraid of a real woman!

235
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:55,831
I'll show you! I'll enter the race myself.
I'll enter my own car and I'll beat you!

236
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,870
And another thing...

237
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:46,019
Professor, dinner is served.

238
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,480
Who is it?

239
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:23,322
I wish to see Professor Fate.
I'm a reporter. For The Sentinel.

240
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,463
Beat it, little girl,
or I'll sic the dogs on you.

241
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:39,741
Who was that?

242
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:43,507
- Kids, just kids, more kids.
- Stupid kids.

243
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,078
You want me to feed you?

244
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:36,858
Listen to that!

245
00:36:42,642 --> 00:36:45,634
Out back by the garage.
The car! Hurry up!

246
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:02,889
Help!

247
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,223
Help!

248
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:12,600
- You sure you locked the door?
- I'm positive. Professor, be careful.

249
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:16,039
If you open the door one inch,
it sets off the alarm.

250
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:17,973
Help!

251
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:46,162
Get away! Get away!

252
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,537
Help! Get me down!

253
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:54,435
Go away.

254
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:57,213
You idiot.

255
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:01,644
Get me down! Help!

256
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,951
Get me down! Please!

257
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,861
Out! And stay out!

258
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:18,863
You can't treat me that way!
I'll expose you!

259
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:24,775
Out! And stay out! A pox on you!

260
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,607
I don't care. You beast of a turncoat!

261
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,046
What are you kicking the professor for?

262
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:34,943
Put up your dukes! Come on!

263
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:37,415
You're a lunatic! A lunatic!

264
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,687
You can't talk to me that way!
I'm a member of the press.

265
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,600
Get off the car, please.
Will you just get off the car?

266
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:05,674
Hands off the car. Get away from there.

267
00:39:07,353 --> 00:39:11,551
Keep your hands away from there.
Get off of the car! Get away from the car.

268
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,690
- Get away from there!
- Hold it.

269
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:17,959
That's it.

270
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:35,140
Away from the car!

271
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,330
Hold it.

272
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,697
That's it.

273
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:11,641
- Everything is ready?
- Everything is ready.

274
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,154
Hold it.

275
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,663
Just stay away from the automobile.
I'll sign it for you.

276
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,562
I checked everything over twice.
We're ready to go.

277
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:34,072
Look, buddy, will you please step
to one side like a good boy?

278
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:59,256
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm an official entry.

279
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,392
- Representing The Sentinel.
- What?

280
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:07,469
Since it is my job as a reporter to be there
when the first car crosses the finish line...

281
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:10,269
...it will be necessary for me to win.

282
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,681
Imagine that crazy female!

283
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:21,886
She won't even get as far as Albany
in that Steamer.

284
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:26,149
Don't bet on it.
That's a very determined young lady.

285
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,190
Good morning, Hester.

286
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:29,626
Have a cigar?

287
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:34,030
I want to thank you again
for this opportunity, Mr. Goodbody.

288
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,035
I had little choice
after your conversation with my wife.

289
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:39,731
Henry, if you can't be more gracious,
shut up!

290
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:43,499
- It's a great day for the cause, Maggie.
- It is indeed, Hester.

291
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:50,839
Drivers, to your cars!

292
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,491
- Hezekiah.
- Boss.

293
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,524
All right, Max.

294
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:07,758
- Good luck, Maggie.
- Thank you.

295
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:13,670
Max!

296
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:23,377
- Come on, Max!
- All checked.

297
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:57,301
Are you sure you took care of everything?

298
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,944
Just keep your eye on car number 2.

299
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:28,066
Now, at approximately the 50 mile mark,
car number 3, it loses its transmission.

300
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:43,583
And in about five seconds,
car number 4 bites the dust.

301
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:56,664
Genius, Max, positive genius.
What's next?

302
00:44:57,036 --> 00:45:01,132
- Car number 5, the engine falls out.
- Car number five?

303
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:05,505
Max! We're number 5.

304
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:31,861
That shouldn't happen to number 6.
I fixed it so the wheels would come off.

305
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,571
Smoke! Get the fire extinguisher!

306
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:44,642
- I got the extinguisher!
- Get the extinguisher!

307
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:47,185
Coming through. I got it.

308
00:45:50,656 --> 00:45:53,921
I think we got it in time. I think we got it!

309
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:58,419
I think we got it now, Professor.

310
00:45:58,597 --> 00:46:00,588
Okay, she's out.

311
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:04,834
Where are you?

312
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:09,269
- Where are you?
- To your right.

313
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:33,723
Hold it.

314
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:07,998
That was a pigeon.

315
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,100
- Get the bird.
- Yes, sir.

316
00:47:47,206 --> 00:47:51,199
- Come here, bird, just come here.
- All right. Hurry up, will you, Frisbee?

317
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:54,341
Frisbee, just get the bird.

318
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,109
Don't lollygag out there, just get the bird.

319
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,317
I got him. I got him, sir.

320
00:48:06,525 --> 00:48:08,652
- Frisbee.
- Yes, I got the bird.

321
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:11,955
Just hold it. Frisbee. Just be quiet.

322
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:16,861
Yes, sir. Oh, help me, sir.
Oh, please try to save me, sir.

323
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:21,104
Just be steady, Frisbee.
Just be steady. Be quiet now.

324
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:25,907
And it's organizations like The Sentinel
that we must deal with first.

325
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:29,311
Why, at this very moment
the editor sits behind his desk...

326
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:38,850
Frisbee, next time be more careful.
If you're falling, let go of the bird.

327
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:58,103
"Sentinel car takes lead approximately
600 miles west of Chicago."

328
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,633
Frisbee!

329
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:11,149
Well, that should put us about here.

330
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,310
Farewell.

331
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:06,373
Hezekiah, see what's wrong with her car.

332
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:22,784
- I must have fainted.
- Perfectly natural in this heat.

333
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,859
- Thank you for stopping.
- My pleasure.

334
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:27,889
May I offer you some water?

335
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:30,560
No, I'm much better now. Thank you.

336
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,001
- Hezekiah, can she be fixed?
- Not a chance, boss.

337
00:50:35,874 --> 00:50:38,707
Well, I guess that's the end of that.

338
00:50:40,112 --> 00:50:42,478
I know how disappointed you must be.

339
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:46,172
But it's amazing that you were able
to accomplish what you did.

340
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:48,549
You mean amazing because I'm a woman.

341
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:51,687
The Steamer is a fast, sporty,
attractive automobile...

342
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,225
...designed for city driving
and country picnics.

343
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:56,284
You're lucky it didn't blow up on you.

344
00:50:56,361 --> 00:51:01,025
You know, it's really amazing that anyone
was able to go this far. I congratulate you.

345
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,733
Not as a woman, but an intrepid autoist.

346
00:51:04,636 --> 00:51:07,127
You mean an intrepid woman autoist.

347
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:11,504
A rather dubious honor when you consider
that the accomplishment is predicated...

348
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:14,444
...on the fact that you chose
the wrong automobile.

349
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,516
But the choice was not mine.
My editor, a man, made the arrangements.

350
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:22,611
Your editor is something less
than an authority on automobiles.

351
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:27,352
But you, on the other hand, claim full
knowledge of the auto and its workings.

352
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:33,925
So, being a woman, you chose to ignore
the practical evidence, acted emotionally...

353
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:37,860
...entered the race knowing full well
that you couldn't possibly finish.

354
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:39,267
Oh, I'll finish.

355
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,803
May I ask how?

356
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:46,376
No, you may not ask how, but I'll finish.
I may not still be an official entry...

357
00:51:46,545 --> 00:51:48,945
...but I will report every foot of this race.

358
00:51:49,014 --> 00:51:51,141
- I'll get another car.
- From where?

359
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:56,549
If I don't, I'll get something else.
I'll find a way, even if I have to walk.

360
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,623
What are you waiting for?

361
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:02,751
Every minute wasted
is another mile for Professor Fate.

362
00:52:06,298 --> 00:52:09,665
We'll take you as far as Boracho,
where I pick up some gasoline.

363
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:12,499
- Perfect.
- From there, you're on your own!

364
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,939
Thank you. My luggage, please.

365
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:17,698
Hezekiah, the young lady's luggage please.

366
00:53:08,193 --> 00:53:10,218
Indian attack! We're being attacked!

367
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:13,162
Smoke screen, Max!
Give them the smoke screen!

368
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:21,566
No, you idiot! The smoke screen!
Push the button, Max!

369
00:53:21,773 --> 00:53:23,104
Smoke screen!

370
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:03,403
Get it down! Get it down!

371
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,413
Take cover, you fools, take cover!

372
00:54:08,487 --> 00:54:10,478
Indians! Savages!

373
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,256
Indian attack!
Get a posse! Savages behind us!

374
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:18,922
- Help!
- Savages attacking us! Indians!

375
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:22,023
Take cover!

376
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,499
Welcome to Boracho.

377
00:54:23,568 --> 00:54:26,332
Yes, thank you.
Indians, savages attacking us!

378
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,903
- Right behind us. An attack!
- What's funny?

379
00:54:30,742 --> 00:54:34,678
That was just the sheriff and some
of the men dressed up like Indians.

380
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:39,080
- Why, they rode out to welcome you.
- That's very reassuring, Mr. Mayor.

381
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,917
Now if you will just show us where
the gasoline is, we'll be on our way.

382
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,819
You understand every second counts.

383
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,587
- You can't go now.
- What do you mean we can't go now?

384
00:54:49,461 --> 00:54:50,928
You're the guest of honor.

385
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,464
Well, I don't want to be a guest of honor.

386
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:56,057
I got to present you
with this here key to the city!

387
00:54:56,134 --> 00:54:57,931
He doesn't want a key, he wants gas!

388
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,700
- As Mayor of Boracho, l...
- I want gas and I want it now!

389
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:04,936
- You ain't gonna get no gas till tomorrow!
- Tomorrow.

390
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,371
You're gonna accept this here key.

391
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,174
You're gonna attend that meeting tonight...

392
00:55:10,248 --> 00:55:15,117
...or, by jumped-up Harry, you're gonna be
guest of honor at a necktie party!

393
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,950
Necktie?
Well, what kind of cheap present is that?

394
00:55:19,057 --> 00:55:21,992
Listen to me, you cheap,
mealy-mouthed, third-rate war healer!

395
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,119
- Somebody get me a rope.
- You want a rope?

396
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,891
I got a rope in the car.

397
00:55:26,231 --> 00:55:29,291
Somebody get me a rope!
Hurry up, they're leaving.

398
00:55:30,902 --> 00:55:34,201
Oh! Get me a rope, somebody!
Get me a rope!

399
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,982
- You gonna give us any trouble?
- I beg your pardon.

400
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,887
We been planning this here shindig
for over a week.

401
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:55,893
Now do we string up the bunch of you or
cooperate and be the guest of honor.

402
00:55:55,961 --> 00:56:01,365
I greet you with cordiality and good cheer.
It's a pleasure to be the great honor.

403
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:05,466
It's a big celebration tonight.
You ain't gonna get no gas till tomorrow.

404
00:56:05,537 --> 00:56:11,032
We look forward to celebrating
and the hospitality of your community.

405
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:16,334
Quiet! Citizens of Boracho! Quiet!

406
00:57:16,508 --> 00:57:18,874
Citizens of Boracho. Thank you.

407
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:22,710
As Mayor of Boracho, I offer a toast...

408
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:26,444
...to our guest of honor, The Great Leslie!

409
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,521
To the fair city of Boracho.

410
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:44,424
Now here she is...

411
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:49,297
...the Queen of the West,
Boracho's own Lily Olay!

412
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:40,909
- I spotted the gas!
- Shut up.

413
01:01:47,612 --> 01:01:50,945
Howdy, Mayor. Howdy, Sheriff.
Hello, there, Curly.

414
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,610
Hello, there.

415
01:01:53,685 --> 01:01:56,711
Lily, this here's our guest of honor,
The Great Leslie.

416
01:01:56,788 --> 01:01:58,278
It's a pleasure to meet you.

417
01:01:58,356 --> 01:02:00,620
Welcome to Boracho, honey.

418
01:02:04,629 --> 01:02:05,994
Won't you join us?

419
01:02:06,064 --> 01:02:09,465
Just for a minute. Scoot over.
How long are y'all going to be here?

420
01:02:09,534 --> 01:02:13,026
Unfortunately, just for the night.
We have to leave in the morning.

421
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,093
That's a pity.

422
01:02:14,372 --> 01:02:17,034
I would like to propose a toast
to Miss Olay.

423
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:26,043
It's lucky Texas Jack ain't around.
He'd gun that dude for sure.

424
01:02:32,524 --> 01:02:37,188
Pardon me, Mr. Partner.
Who is this Texas Jack?

425
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:39,690
Who's Texas Jack?

426
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:44,495
The roughest, toughest gunslinger
in these parts.

427
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,069
Lily is his girl.

428
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:51,770
- Lily's his girl.
- Terrific!

429
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:05,253
Honey, your smile is downright painful!

430
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:07,916
Thank you. Are you a native of Boracho?

431
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:10,725
I ain't no native, I was born here!

432
01:03:12,397 --> 01:03:14,297
- Mr. Partner.
- Yes.

433
01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:16,799
Where would I find this Texas Jack?

434
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:19,833
He's got a ranch
about eight miles south of town.

435
01:03:24,943 --> 01:03:28,902
I have to get on that moon again.
Don't go away, you hear?

436
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,416
- It's been a pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome to Boracho, honey.

437
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:47,086
Jack.

438
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:04,738
Now wait a minute, Jack.
This is a friendly celebration.

439
01:04:05,116 --> 01:04:09,177
Fiddle-de-dee! I don't much like
the way you're celebrating.

440
01:04:09,454 --> 01:04:12,787
So you just step back, Sheriff,
unless you want to fall back.

441
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:15,819
Howdy, Jack, honey.

442
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:30,163
Jack, honey, don't get rough.
He's the guest of honor.

443
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,180
Now just a moment.

444
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:48,452
I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
As you can see, I am unarmed.

445
01:04:49,193 --> 01:04:50,524
He's unarmed.

446
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,365
- Let's get the gas.
- Not yet.

447
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:05,102
All right now, everybody stand back
and give a man some fighting room.

448
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:16,385
Now will you give me some fighting room?

449
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:24,558
My camera!

450
01:05:44,615 --> 01:05:47,846
Citizens of Boracho, stop!

451
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,882
Music, somebody! Start the music!

452
01:06:14,545 --> 01:06:16,513
Citizens of Boracho!

453
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,795
Now will you give me some fighting room?

454
01:06:36,968 --> 01:06:38,595
Jack, honey!

455
01:06:48,246 --> 01:06:50,146
Excuse me, please.

456
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:13,635
- Now look what you've done.
- Me?

457
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:45,699
There's the gas.

458
01:07:45,803 --> 01:07:49,170
There's a fight! Fight in the saloon! Fight!

459
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,038
Fight in the saloon! Big fight! Fight!

460
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,907
Fight! There's a big fight
in the saloon. Texas Jack! He's drunk!

461
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,956
Max! Max, you idiot, the gas.

462
01:08:15,233 --> 01:08:16,564
Where's the car?

463
01:08:18,035 --> 01:08:19,366
Get the car!

464
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,495
Hey, boss!

465
01:09:51,862 --> 01:09:55,423
Now can I have me some fighting room?

466
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:06,006
The back is full. I'll put the rest
of the gas in the seat.

467
01:10:06,143 --> 01:10:08,338
Leave it? Can't leave it for Leslie.

468
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,745
Leave Leslie to me. Start the car. The car.

469
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,381
Switch on!

470
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,453
My apologies.

471
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:30,397
The gasoline!

472
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,769
We shall win!

473
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:56,749
Well, that finishes Leslie.

474
01:10:56,827 --> 01:10:59,318
Oh, no, not Leslie. Never Leslie.

475
01:10:59,563 --> 01:11:04,296
The Great Leslie. He'll think of something,
but we'll be in Alaska by the time he does.

476
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:43,200
I'm offering you a lift.

477
01:11:49,714 --> 01:11:52,239
Or would you prefer
an engraved invitation?

478
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:58,979
- I might consider an apology.
- An apology?

479
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,155
For what?
It's twenty miles back to Boracho.

480
01:12:02,226 --> 01:12:04,922
- You'd never make it.
- Well, that's your fault.

481
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:06,251
My fault.

482
01:12:06,464 --> 01:12:09,365
I warned you.
I would not be left behind in Boracho.

483
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:12,334
You left me no choice
so I had to stow away in Fate's car.

484
01:12:12,403 --> 01:12:14,132
And he cast you adrift.

485
01:12:14,638 --> 01:12:17,471
If you had provided me
with transportation to Grommett...

486
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,772
...where I could have caught a train,
it never would have happened.

487
01:12:20,845 --> 01:12:23,575
Grommett was 100 miles out of our way.

488
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,542
And where are you going now?

489
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:31,915
Professor Fate destroyed all the gasoline,
Grommett is a matter of necessity.

490
01:12:32,757 --> 01:12:35,624
And when you reach Grommett
you'll send for gasoline?

491
01:12:35,693 --> 01:12:40,062
But if you were to send for gasoline now
it would be in Grommett when you arrived.

492
01:12:40,197 --> 01:12:43,496
If I were to send for gasoline now
I would need a telegraph.

493
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,392
Not necessarily.

494
01:12:56,714 --> 01:12:59,182
I will take you no further than Grommett.

495
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:25,732
Hey, Professor, where we going?

496
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:29,903
We save 15 miles by following
the tracks, Max.

497
01:13:30,981 --> 01:13:32,209
Oh, terrific!

498
01:14:13,591 --> 01:14:15,582
- Is that gasoline?
- Sure is.

499
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:18,357
Let me give you a hand with it.

500
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:20,124
Wait a minute.

501
01:14:20,431 --> 01:14:23,696
- Nobody gets nothing till it's signed for.
- Of course.

502
01:14:23,934 --> 01:14:26,664
- You M. Dubois?
- I beg your pardon.

503
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,106
- Gasoline consigned to M. Dubois.
- What?

504
01:14:30,307 --> 01:14:32,366
- Oh, I'm M. Dubois.
- I knew it.

505
01:14:32,443 --> 01:14:33,933
You got some identification?

506
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,707
What did I tell you?
I told you not to trust her.

507
01:14:37,248 --> 01:14:38,579
My press card.

508
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,041
Okay, just sign on the line.

509
01:14:43,587 --> 01:14:45,714
- What if I don't sign?
- You see.

510
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,023
Look, ma'am, you don't sign,
you don't get no gas.

511
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:53,123
Well, Mr. Leslie?
You wish to continue the race, so do I.

512
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,259
As far as the West Coast?

513
01:14:55,499 --> 01:14:57,990
If she goes, I stay!

514
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:00,163
Hezekiah.

515
01:15:00,237 --> 01:15:02,797
You going to sign or do I send
the gas back to New York?

516
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,340
Miss Dubois, this is very...

517
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:06,899
The gas is yours if you take me
to the West Coast.

518
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:09,537
Under the circumstances,
it's a fair exchange.

519
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:11,740
Load the gas back on the train.

520
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:14,784
She's not signing and
the train's leaving in five minutes.

521
01:15:14,852 --> 01:15:18,913
Just one moment, please, sir.
I will not leave without Hezekiah.

522
01:15:19,156 --> 01:15:20,885
If I can change his mind?

523
01:15:28,098 --> 01:15:30,589
Suppose you don't change his mind?

524
01:15:31,135 --> 01:15:34,070
Then I shall take this train back
to New York.

525
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,570
Sir, let me give you a hand
with the gasoline.

526
01:15:39,643 --> 01:15:41,770
Boys, would you care to join me?

527
01:15:45,282 --> 01:15:49,946
Hezekiah, I understand how you feel,
but I beg you to reconsider.

528
01:15:52,323 --> 01:15:53,654
A deal is a deal.

529
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,258
Then I guess I'll have to hurry
or I'll miss my train. Goodbye, Hezekiah.

530
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,928
You mean...

531
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,669
Well, a deal is a deal.
It's been wonderful knowing you.

532
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,770
What about the gas?

533
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,266
I signed for it.

534
01:16:13,644 --> 01:16:17,580
I'm sorry. You see,
this race ain't the right place for a woman.

535
01:16:18,849 --> 01:16:19,873
I understand.

536
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,244
Board!

537
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:22,841
Well.

538
01:16:24,655 --> 01:16:27,647
- Would you take me to the train?
- Well, yes, ma'am.

539
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,455
Boys and girls,
this is a six-cylinder automobile...

540
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:38,899
...with an overhead cam that can...

541
01:16:39,103 --> 01:16:42,470
It was built by a company
especially for me, for this race.

542
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:04,757
He just wouldn't listen.

543
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:08,392
I told him, and he said that...

544
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:13,930
...he's had enough and he didn't think
you could win anyway.

545
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:15,127
And...

546
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:19,336
...he said he was going to go back
to New York.

547
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:22,738
Double-crossing females!

548
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:26,249
Hey, boss! Look.

549
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:29,515
Hey, conductor!

550
01:17:30,454 --> 01:17:33,184
You are trying my patience, madam.

551
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:34,955
We know our rights.

552
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,086
You're obstructing traffic
and disturbing the peace!

553
01:17:38,262 --> 01:17:42,255
- And you are exceeding your authority.
- I ain't exceeding nothing, lady!

554
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:44,196
- Then, arrest us.
- What?

555
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:46,901
Arrest us. I dare you.

556
01:17:55,245 --> 01:17:56,177
Sorry, sir.

557
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,213
I want you to run to City Hall
and bail out Mrs. Goodbody.

558
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:00,181
Yes, sir.

559
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,816
In about two hours.

560
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,049
Yes, sir.

561
01:18:30,848 --> 01:18:33,408
I once went
on an anthropological expedition...

562
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,882
...to study the Kwakiutl Indians.

563
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:40,211
In winter, one Kwakiutl in a blanket froze.

564
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:44,325
But two Kwakiutls in the same blanket...

565
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:47,762
Yes?

566
01:18:48,232 --> 01:18:49,164
Were warmer.

567
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,498
Would you hold this, please?

568
01:18:58,775 --> 01:18:59,764
Champagne?

569
01:19:00,844 --> 01:19:03,335
You put alcohol in the radiator
of the automobile...

570
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:05,608
...to keep it from freezing, don't you?

571
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:20,720
I can't see a thing.

572
01:19:21,932 --> 01:19:23,331
Neither can I.

573
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:27,101
Maybe we better stop.

574
01:19:35,245 --> 01:19:37,577
I can't stand it, I'm freezing to death.

575
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:38,970
Shut up!

576
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:42,313
Even the thermometer is frozen.

577
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:45,179
Everything's frozen.

578
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:52,054
Look at that!

579
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:11,308
It won't take long to grow back.
It's only a half of a mustache.

580
01:20:31,635 --> 01:20:32,761
What was that?

581
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:34,559
I don't know.

582
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:36,538
Well, I'll go see.

583
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,979
Miss Dubois, please. Thank you.

584
01:21:31,194 --> 01:21:35,290
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were Maximillian.

585
01:21:36,233 --> 01:21:40,260
Nothing to worry about. We have
a lot more champagne in the car.

586
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:03,698
Professor!

587
01:22:04,608 --> 01:22:05,939
Yes!

588
01:22:06,877 --> 01:22:08,936
Where are you?

589
01:22:10,081 --> 01:22:11,810
Behind the rock!

590
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:14,242
Behind which rock?

591
01:22:18,489 --> 01:22:21,481
This rock, you idiot. Come on.

592
01:22:30,935 --> 01:22:34,098
Close the door and hurry it. Bring it up!

593
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:43,077
We're safe up here.

594
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:45,042
Yeah, safe here.

595
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:53,179
Help!

596
01:22:57,595 --> 01:23:00,860
My apologies.
There's a polar bear in our car.

597
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:05,798
If you don't leave this car immediately,
I shall personally feed you to the bear.

598
01:23:06,036 --> 01:23:09,335
If the bears don't get us,
we'll certainly freeze to death out there!

599
01:23:10,274 --> 01:23:13,710
As far as freezing is concerned,
you have the same chance that we have.

600
01:23:13,944 --> 01:23:16,970
- Not if you put us out in the blizzard.
- Snowing very bad.

601
01:23:17,114 --> 01:23:20,777
May I point out
that you've completely demolished my top.

602
01:23:21,118 --> 01:23:24,918
And there's very little difference between
the blizzard out there and in here.

603
01:23:25,089 --> 01:23:27,353
Except that you have blankets
and stimulants.

604
01:23:27,558 --> 01:23:28,456
Stimulants.

605
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:29,987
He's right.

606
01:23:30,261 --> 01:23:32,161
Miss Dubois, you're not suggesting...

607
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:34,959
If two in a blanket stand
a better chance than one...

608
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:36,861
Then four in a blanket...

609
01:23:37,034 --> 01:23:38,592
He's a cheat and a liar.

610
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:40,566
That's beside the point.

611
01:23:40,905 --> 01:23:42,702
The point is that we're freezing.

612
01:23:42,873 --> 01:23:46,502
Yes, and the time has come
to cast aside our personal differences.

613
01:23:46,744 --> 01:23:48,041
Bury the hatchet.

614
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:50,409
And you know who has the hatchet.

615
01:23:50,581 --> 01:23:53,277
He doesn't even have a whole moustache...

616
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:56,615
...so why can't we settle this whole thing
underneath the blanket?

617
01:23:56,854 --> 01:23:59,823
We must get underneath
the blankets together. Close together.

618
01:24:00,324 --> 01:24:04,021
Therefore, it will be necessary
to lower the seat.

619
01:24:04,762 --> 01:24:06,593
Lower the seat!

620
01:24:07,264 --> 01:24:09,425
Max, the back!

621
01:24:09,767 --> 01:24:12,258
The foot. Watch that foot!

622
01:24:13,838 --> 01:24:15,396
I beg your pardon.

623
01:24:15,573 --> 01:24:17,006
Champagne, Professor?

624
01:24:17,174 --> 01:24:18,163
Thank you.

625
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:21,468
Hey, this is terrific.

626
01:24:21,846 --> 01:24:23,837
May I propose a toast?

627
01:24:25,783 --> 01:24:27,808
What's so funny? Something wrong?

628
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:30,215
What happened to your mustache?

629
01:24:30,387 --> 01:24:32,548
- I broke it off.
- You what?

630
01:24:32,723 --> 01:24:35,624
I broke it off. It was frozen. Look.

631
01:24:54,578 --> 01:24:55,909
What time is it?

632
01:24:56,881 --> 01:24:58,212
Just a moment.

633
01:25:11,662 --> 01:25:13,095
7:30.

634
01:25:16,934 --> 01:25:18,697
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

635
01:25:18,903 --> 01:25:22,100
Very big. The head very big.

636
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:23,866
Time to get up.

637
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,876
Professor, time to get up.

638
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:31,615
Come on, Professor, rise and shine.

639
01:25:32,783 --> 01:25:34,808
Rise and shine?

640
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:38,086
- 7:30.
- Then you rise, you shine.

641
01:25:39,123 --> 01:25:42,388
- He's always like this in the morning.
- I'm not always like this!

642
01:25:42,526 --> 01:25:44,926
This particular morning
I happen to be seasick.

643
01:25:45,796 --> 01:25:46,990
Too much champagne.

644
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:49,931
I'm not sick from champagne,
I'm sick from the sea!

645
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:54,036
- It's not necessary to yell at her.
- I'll yell at whoever I want to yell at!

646
01:25:54,204 --> 01:25:57,401
- He always yells like this.
- Let me out of here!

647
01:26:00,544 --> 01:26:04,810
7:30 in the morning,
you idiots, I'm seasick!

648
01:26:08,185 --> 01:26:10,176
Rise and shine.

649
01:26:15,192 --> 01:26:17,752
Help! Max!

650
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:23,323
I'm coming, Professor.

651
01:26:24,702 --> 01:26:26,294
I got you!

652
01:26:52,331 --> 01:26:54,322
You're wasting your time.

653
01:26:55,234 --> 01:26:57,225
- Perhaps.
- We're melting.

654
01:26:58,237 --> 01:27:00,671
- Slowly.
- We're going to sink.

655
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:04,503
- Eventually.
- Then you're wasting your time!

656
01:27:05,611 --> 01:27:07,806
I shall place this log...

657
01:27:09,148 --> 01:27:12,117
...in a water-tight container, if found...

658
01:27:12,785 --> 01:27:16,846
...it shall provide valuable information
for those who may follow.

659
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:19,847
Valuable information for those
who may follow.

660
01:27:20,793 --> 01:27:23,193
Professor, I got an idea.

661
01:27:23,862 --> 01:27:27,059
Instead of the book, why don't you and me
get into the container?

662
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:28,463
Shut up!

663
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:31,268
- We got to do something.
- Don't worry.

664
01:27:31,637 --> 01:27:35,505
Before this iceberg melts and we drown
like rats, we're going to do plenty.

665
01:27:36,675 --> 01:27:38,370
We're going to starve!

666
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,815
Miss Dubois, I recommend
we have cold meals from now on...

667
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:46,942
...we're melting fast enough as it is.

668
01:27:47,653 --> 01:27:51,111
What difference does it make?
A few hours one way or another.

669
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:54,450
Minutes have made the difference
in survival, Miss Dubois.

670
01:27:55,994 --> 01:28:00,658
Mr. Leslie, I suspect you are being
unrealistically optimistic for my benefit.

671
01:28:01,266 --> 01:28:02,893
And it isn't at all necessary.

672
01:28:03,101 --> 01:28:07,765
We're lost on an iceberg,
and doomed to drift with the tide and melt.

673
01:28:11,076 --> 01:28:13,067
You're a brave woman, Miss Dubois.

674
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:15,405
Red sky.

675
01:28:17,783 --> 01:28:19,011
So what?

676
01:28:19,485 --> 01:28:21,214
There's going to be a storm.

677
01:28:21,954 --> 01:28:23,615
What are you talking about?

678
01:28:24,189 --> 01:28:26,521
"Red sky in the morning,
sailor, take warning."

679
01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:30,522
You thimble-headed gherkin,
do you realize the odds against a storm...

680
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:33,997
...in this part of the ocean
at this time of year? 100-to-1.

681
01:28:48,146 --> 01:28:50,114
Throw me a rope!

682
01:28:59,658 --> 01:29:02,126
"Red sky in the morning,
sailor, take warning."

683
01:29:02,861 --> 01:29:05,352
Why you, nincompoop!

684
01:29:09,801 --> 01:29:11,200
Max!

685
01:29:28,887 --> 01:29:30,013
Another foot.

686
01:29:30,289 --> 01:29:31,449
Another foot.

687
01:29:32,858 --> 01:29:34,519
Thirty-seven inches to go.

688
01:29:34,893 --> 01:29:37,054
Thirty-seven inches to go.

689
01:29:37,429 --> 01:29:41,092
At the rate we've been melting
that's good for about one more week.

690
01:29:41,433 --> 01:29:43,162
You better keep it to yourself.

691
01:29:43,702 --> 01:29:46,102
Of course I'll keep it to myself.

692
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:51,473
Until the water reaches my lower lip,
then I'll mention it to somebody.

693
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,811
What was the professor
complaining about?

694
01:30:01,386 --> 01:30:03,411
You know the professor.

695
01:30:03,822 --> 01:30:07,451
He thinks we're melting too fast,
and he was venting his wrath on the gods.

696
01:30:08,961 --> 01:30:10,622
Are we melting too fast?

697
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:14,257
I don't think so.
According to my calculations...

698
01:30:14,633 --> 01:30:17,898
...we'll reach land just about the time
that our feet get wet.

699
01:30:26,378 --> 01:30:28,141
- I'm hungry.
- She's getting it.

700
01:30:28,313 --> 01:30:30,508
How long does it take
to open a can of beans?

701
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:32,776
The eternal struggle takes time, Max.

702
01:30:32,951 --> 01:30:35,078
What struggle? She's got a can opener.

703
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:39,714
You cork-brain, I'm talking about man,
woman, sex, conquest.

704
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,285
What was that?

705
01:30:41,593 --> 01:30:45,154
He's making his move.
And I'm sure she's interested.

706
01:30:45,297 --> 01:30:47,765
But unless I miss my guess
she will never submit.

707
01:30:47,933 --> 01:30:49,798
If she does, we won't get any beans.

708
01:30:49,868 --> 01:30:53,395
It's a contest, and he's using weapons
that have toppled everything...

709
01:30:53,538 --> 01:30:55,972
...from a Kansas farm girl
to a European duchess.

710
01:30:56,141 --> 01:30:58,371
But she will counter with women's rights.

711
01:30:59,344 --> 01:31:00,675
That's terrible.

712
01:31:01,446 --> 01:31:05,906
For a man like Leslie, that's terrible.
Like me, he must win on his own terms.

713
01:31:06,818 --> 01:31:09,480
She recognizes no terms except her own.

714
01:31:09,688 --> 01:31:11,178
Come and get it.

715
01:31:11,657 --> 01:31:12,646
You see?

716
01:31:14,693 --> 01:31:16,627
Maybe she doesn't mean us.

717
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:38,682
Hey, Professor.

718
01:31:40,185 --> 01:31:42,483
Hey, Professor, up and at 'em.

719
01:31:43,989 --> 01:31:45,354
Up and at 'em?

720
01:31:46,058 --> 01:31:48,925
- It's 7:30. Up and at 'em.
- "Up and at 'em!"

721
01:31:49,061 --> 01:31:50,119
Don't yell!

722
01:31:50,429 --> 01:31:52,397
Always yells like that in the morning.

723
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:56,089
You idiot!
"Hey, Professor, up and at 'em."

724
01:31:57,769 --> 01:32:00,761
"Hey, Professor, up and at 'em, it's 7:30."

725
01:32:02,174 --> 01:32:04,267
We're underwater!

726
01:32:04,509 --> 01:32:07,945
We're underwater! We're doomed!

727
01:32:08,346 --> 01:32:10,814
- We'll make it.
- We'll make what?

728
01:32:11,149 --> 01:32:12,673
- Land.
- Land!

729
01:32:13,852 --> 01:32:14,841
Land!

730
01:32:16,588 --> 01:32:19,113
It's probably East Cape.
I see a ship in the harbor.

731
01:32:19,491 --> 01:32:22,187
We're saved. We're saved!

732
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:25,425
Max, we're saved! We're saved!

733
01:32:27,065 --> 01:32:29,659
- I am Professor Fate!
- We're saved!

734
01:32:30,736 --> 01:32:32,670
Max, my trusty trout, the cannon.

735
01:32:33,472 --> 01:32:35,770
Fire the cannon, let them know we're here!

736
01:32:40,512 --> 01:32:42,639
Push the button, Max!

737
01:32:47,486 --> 01:32:49,454
Max!

738
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:53,681
Ahoy!

739
01:32:56,428 --> 01:32:58,293
Ahoy!

740
01:32:58,497 --> 01:33:02,024
Isn't it wonderful to see an American ship
in this godforsaken outpost?

741
01:33:02,267 --> 01:33:05,327
It is indeed. It's probably
from San Francisco or Seattle.

742
01:33:05,737 --> 01:33:08,035
Ahoy, iceberg.

743
01:33:09,808 --> 01:33:11,207
It's me!

744
01:33:12,144 --> 01:33:13,771
It's me!

745
01:33:14,513 --> 01:33:17,846
If I didn't know better I would say that's...

746
01:33:20,085 --> 01:33:21,245
It's me!

747
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:24,217
- Hezekiah.
- What?

748
01:33:30,362 --> 01:33:32,489
You gave me your word and I trusted you.

749
01:33:32,731 --> 01:33:36,292
Then you handcuffed Hezekiah
to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe.

750
01:33:36,401 --> 01:33:37,732
It was the Southern Pacific.

751
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:40,531
What has that got to do with it?
You gave me your word.

752
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,800
- You gave me no choice!
- You lie!

753
01:33:42,974 --> 01:33:44,908
I told you I would finish the race.

754
01:33:50,115 --> 01:33:53,084
- Push the button, Max.
- Are you sure this is such a good idea?

755
01:33:53,251 --> 01:33:55,811
She is his Achilles' heel,
she is our ace in the hole.

756
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:58,389
- She must not be left behind now, Max!
- I know!

757
01:33:58,723 --> 01:34:00,122
Push the button.

758
01:34:09,267 --> 01:34:10,791
But you can't leave me here.

759
01:34:10,969 --> 01:34:12,300
Boss!

760
01:34:24,216 --> 01:34:27,481
We want jobs. We want jobs.

761
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:31,383
Frisbee?

762
01:34:33,024 --> 01:34:34,252
Frisbee!

763
01:34:38,096 --> 01:34:38,926
Frisbee?

764
01:34:39,197 --> 01:34:40,926
I'm sorry, dear.

765
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,765
- Capitulate, Henry.
- Never.

766
01:34:44,035 --> 01:34:48,233
Well, remember we're having the Simpsons
to dinner. Now try not to be late.

767
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:50,532
Excuse me.

768
01:34:53,678 --> 01:34:55,145
I'm sorry, dear.

769
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,280
I could hardly get across the hall.

770
01:34:57,382 --> 01:35:00,249
Why are you complaining?
I have to sleep with their leader.

771
01:35:00,318 --> 01:35:01,683
This is from Reuters.

772
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,583
"Last report dated March 10.

773
01:35:03,722 --> 01:35:06,816
"Fate's car still in lead
and nearing Srednek Kolimsk."

774
01:35:08,493 --> 01:35:11,189
They could have reached
the Lena River by now.

775
01:35:29,314 --> 01:35:31,509
- Hey, Professor, what is this?
- Shut up.

776
01:36:04,049 --> 01:36:06,415
You give them beads, makes them friendly.

777
01:36:07,953 --> 01:36:10,080
Obviously, they don't know who I am.

778
01:36:16,528 --> 01:36:19,361
I am professor Fate!

779
01:36:33,812 --> 01:36:35,370
You want to try the beads?

780
01:36:37,082 --> 01:36:38,811
What is the word for "friends"?

781
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:40,144
- Professor...
- Shut up!

782
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:42,811
- I don't know this language.
- Get the dictionary.

783
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:47,257
- I've got it.
- What is it?

784
01:36:48,393 --> 01:36:49,917
I can't pronounce it.

785
01:36:54,966 --> 01:36:55,990
Very simple.

786
01:36:57,202 --> 01:37:00,365
- "Drozia."
- Drozia.

787
01:37:03,942 --> 01:37:07,503
I speak, read and write French,
Russian and Arabic.

788
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:40,737
Max, stick with the car!

789
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:54,658
She don't act like she's being kidnapped.

790
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:00,922
Max!

791
01:38:07,205 --> 01:38:11,164
Boss, this dispatch just came in
from Maggie Dubois.

792
01:38:11,976 --> 01:38:14,069
"Have crossed Carpanian border.

793
01:38:14,245 --> 01:38:17,078
"No contact with Leslie's car
in nearly three weeks.

794
01:38:17,282 --> 01:38:19,876
"So there's no way of telling
who's in the lead."

795
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:24,951
The Webber Motor Car Company built
the Leslie Special.

796
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:26,987
- Have they integrated yet?
- No.

797
01:38:27,492 --> 01:38:29,585
They still refuse to hire any women.

798
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:32,962
Until Webber changes its policy,
there will be no mention...

799
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:35,226
...of the Leslie Special in this newspaper.

800
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:37,961
But you can't do that.
We'll lose their advertising.

801
01:38:39,304 --> 01:38:42,000
Mr. Frisbee, until my husband is released...

802
01:38:42,107 --> 01:38:44,701
...from Happy Acres, I am in charge here.

803
01:38:44,909 --> 01:38:46,103
Yes, sir... Ma'am.

804
01:38:46,377 --> 01:38:47,469
Now, let's see.

805
01:38:48,113 --> 01:38:52,049
They should be approaching
the next gasoline stop...

806
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:54,412
...which is Potzdorf.

807
01:39:44,002 --> 01:39:45,629
I am General Kuhster.

808
01:39:45,837 --> 01:39:48,931
I will escort you to the palace
where you will be the guests...

809
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,338
...of His Royal Highness, Prince Hapnick.

810
01:39:52,143 --> 01:39:53,576
We are deeply honored.

811
01:39:57,749 --> 01:39:59,080
Who's Prince Hapnick?

812
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:01,616
He's the royal heir to the throne.

813
01:41:31,276 --> 01:41:33,676
I say we should've dumped her
a long time ago!

814
01:41:33,811 --> 01:41:36,780
I say we shall dump her
when I say we'll dump her!

815
01:41:36,948 --> 01:41:38,848
She's playing you for a sucker!

816
01:41:42,587 --> 01:41:44,054
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

817
01:41:52,997 --> 01:41:54,225
What do you want?

818
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:56,822
Who are you?

819
01:41:57,669 --> 01:41:59,660
Professor Fate. And who might you be?

820
01:42:00,004 --> 01:42:02,234
- Incredible.
- Amazing.

821
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:06,802
Unhand me.

822
01:42:06,944 --> 01:42:09,242
I found this wildcat swimming in the lake.

823
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,641
I demand to know what this is all about?

824
01:42:12,617 --> 01:42:13,948
It's very simple:

825
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:16,583
You and your friends are under arrest.

826
01:42:35,373 --> 01:42:38,308
- Will you be in Potzdorf long, Mr. Leslie?
- I'm afraid not.

827
01:42:38,576 --> 01:42:40,407
We leave tomorrow morning. Early.

828
01:42:40,645 --> 01:42:43,478
Where is your competitor,
this Professor Fate?

829
01:42:43,848 --> 01:42:47,511
- I suspect not far behind.
- Lf he ain't ahead of us already.

830
01:42:47,652 --> 01:42:49,984
Have you met the Crown Prince yet,
Mr. Leslie?

831
01:42:50,121 --> 01:42:51,713
No, I haven't had the honor.

832
01:42:58,863 --> 01:43:02,390
His Royal Highness,
Crown Prince Frederick Hapnick!

833
01:43:26,424 --> 01:43:27,550
Hey, boss...

834
01:43:27,925 --> 01:43:30,393
- Yeah, but that's...
- No, it isn't.

835
01:43:36,467 --> 01:43:38,059
That was exhausting.

836
01:43:51,849 --> 01:43:53,146
Your Highness!

837
01:44:01,325 --> 01:44:05,193
Your highness,
may I present the Great Leslie.

838
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:08,457
- Your Highness.
- And this is Mr. Hezekiah.

839
01:44:09,033 --> 01:44:11,524
Welcome to Potzdorf.

840
01:44:12,003 --> 01:44:15,700
Excuse me, Your Highness, but do you
have any relatives in the United States?

841
01:44:15,807 --> 01:44:17,968
Me? Relatives in the States?

842
01:44:19,477 --> 01:44:22,207
It's of no consequence, Sire.
It's just that you bear...

843
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:24,805
...an uncanny resemblance
to someone we both know.

844
01:44:24,982 --> 01:44:26,973
- Someone who looks like me?
- Yes, sir.

845
01:44:32,824 --> 01:44:33,756
Poor fellow.

846
01:45:23,107 --> 01:45:25,041
May I have the honor of this dance?

847
01:46:35,313 --> 01:46:37,838
In the Kingdom of Carpania
if one doesn't waltz...

848
01:46:37,949 --> 01:46:40,349
...one doesn't dance. And I love to dance.

849
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:42,842
Only problem is, I hate the waltz.

850
01:46:43,921 --> 01:46:46,549
I waltz just enough to comply
with tradition...

851
01:46:46,691 --> 01:46:49,216
...then I sneak off
to more rewarding activities.

852
01:46:49,327 --> 01:46:50,453
Brandy!

853
01:46:50,828 --> 01:46:53,388
I should have scheduled
divine entertainment for you:

854
01:46:53,497 --> 01:46:56,432
Carpania's full of forests.
The forests are full of gypsies...

855
01:46:56,601 --> 01:47:00,037
...and the gypsies are full of shenanigans
such as swallowing swords...

856
01:47:00,204 --> 01:47:02,229
...and chewing broken glass, eating fire.

857
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,399
It's wonderful!
I don't know how they do it.

858
01:47:04,508 --> 01:47:06,908
Your Highness should visit India one day.

859
01:47:08,112 --> 01:47:11,775
India, isn't that where they have
those Hindu persons walking on hot coals?

860
01:47:11,882 --> 01:47:13,144
And lie on nails!

861
01:47:13,918 --> 01:47:16,079
They train those hideous snakes!

862
01:47:17,989 --> 01:47:21,356
I think I'm supposed to go to India,
after I assume the throne...

863
01:47:21,559 --> 01:47:23,527
- Do we go to India, General?
- Yes.

864
01:47:23,694 --> 01:47:28,063
Good, I can hardly wait.
Sit. Here, have a cigar.

865
01:47:28,532 --> 01:47:31,933
The coronation is tomorrow.
I hope you'll stay, you Great Leslie, you.

866
01:47:32,036 --> 01:47:33,731
I'd be most honored, Your Highness.

867
01:47:33,804 --> 01:47:38,264
But if you attend the coronation,
won't you lose time in your race to Paris?

868
01:47:38,376 --> 01:47:41,868
Since there hasn't been report
Professor Fate has crossed your border...

869
01:47:41,979 --> 01:47:43,776
...I assume that I'm in the lead.

870
01:47:43,848 --> 01:47:45,839
But he might cross at any moment.

871
01:47:47,051 --> 01:47:49,019
It's been my experience, General...

872
01:47:50,154 --> 01:47:53,453
...that there is little advantage
to winning if one wins too easily.

873
01:47:57,695 --> 01:47:59,720
What do you say to that, General?

874
01:48:00,231 --> 01:48:02,961
An admirable point of view.
For anyone, but a soldier.

875
01:48:03,467 --> 01:48:08,131
In my profession, to win is imperative.
To win easily is a blessing.

876
01:48:10,307 --> 01:48:14,073
Yes, blessing. He has terrible mottos
written all over his walls like:

877
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:18,240
"If a good soldier dies with his boots on,
rest assured they're polished."

878
01:48:21,419 --> 01:48:25,116
- Good evening, Your Highness.
- Rolfe, you rogue, where have you been?

879
01:48:25,256 --> 01:48:28,714
My apologies for being late,
Your Highness, but I was delayed by...

880
01:48:28,859 --> 01:48:30,087
...some last minute business.

881
01:48:30,161 --> 01:48:32,789
You haven't been dueling again,
you naughty boy.

882
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:34,527
No, Your Highness.

883
01:48:37,068 --> 01:48:40,196
Mr. Leslie, this is Baron Rolfe Von Stuppe.

884
01:48:40,671 --> 01:48:43,606
Baron Von Stuppe,
is Carpania's greatest swordsman.

885
01:48:43,774 --> 01:48:45,969
Matter of fact,
his prowess with the blade...

886
01:48:46,077 --> 01:48:48,841
...is surpassed only by his reputation
with the ladies.

887
01:48:48,946 --> 01:48:50,345
- Baron.
- I'm honored.

888
01:48:50,514 --> 01:48:54,473
Sit and drink up. The evening's young,
we're all going to have such a gay...

889
01:48:54,652 --> 01:48:56,483
Brandy! What kept you?

890
01:48:58,823 --> 01:49:00,814
What makes you so great, Mr. Leslie?

891
01:49:02,059 --> 01:49:06,393
Greatness is a light-hearted title
for theatrical amusements.

892
01:49:07,131 --> 01:49:09,656
Or a definition endowed on men...

893
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,166
...too long dead
to know that its been awarded.

894
01:49:14,105 --> 01:49:15,470
I'm simply Leslie.

895
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,467
And I'm at your service, Your Highness.

896
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:35,852
Goodness gracious.

897
01:49:36,127 --> 01:49:38,891
You know there's one thing wrong
with living in a palace:

898
01:49:38,996 --> 01:49:41,624
It takes so long to get from one place
to another.

899
01:49:41,766 --> 01:49:44,735
I live in a constant state of exhaustion.
Poor Prince!

900
01:49:45,102 --> 01:49:48,538
One good thing, when one was young,
you could play along the corridors.

901
01:49:48,706 --> 01:49:52,403
I used to ride my pony up and down
this corridor when I was young.

902
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,740
Then I grew up and got drunk, and fell off.

903
01:50:00,017 --> 01:50:01,541
I'm going to bed, now.

904
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,187
Good night, Your Highness.

905
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:06,813
- Who is going to tuck me in?
- I can manage that.

906
01:50:06,957 --> 01:50:09,949
No. You're the sloppiest tucker-inner
in all Potzdorf.

907
01:50:10,094 --> 01:50:13,552
If there's anything I abhor,
it's a sloppy tucker-inner.

908
01:50:16,433 --> 01:50:20,199
Good night, you good Leslie, you.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

909
01:50:28,212 --> 01:50:29,770
There, kids.

910
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:34,413
They've been waiting for me.

911
01:50:40,224 --> 01:50:41,919
Mumsey...

912
01:50:42,326 --> 01:50:46,262
...l'm afraid I had
a teeny-weeny bit too much to drink.

913
01:50:47,097 --> 01:50:50,931
But then again, I always have
a teeny-weeny bit too much to drink.

914
01:50:53,537 --> 01:50:56,097
Because Mumsey isn't here to scold me.

915
01:50:56,507 --> 01:50:58,270
I wish Mumsey were here.

916
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,130
Hello.

917
01:51:35,779 --> 01:51:37,542
Good night, Mumsey.

918
01:52:01,672 --> 01:52:03,003
Running like a top.

919
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:08,544
Good mechanics always
got to keep checking. Every little thing.

920
01:52:08,946 --> 01:52:10,277
A beautiful machine.

921
01:52:10,581 --> 01:52:11,741
Indeed it is.

922
01:52:12,082 --> 01:52:15,609
And you make sure nobody gets nearer
than 50 feet to it, you understand?

923
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:18,752
Unless of course, it's me or...

924
01:52:19,056 --> 01:52:20,751
...Mr. Leslie.
- Don't worry.

925
01:52:21,592 --> 01:52:23,423
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

926
01:52:23,928 --> 01:52:25,657
Looks like a beautiful night.

927
01:52:28,966 --> 01:52:31,730
I think I'll just take
a little stroll around the palace.

928
01:52:48,986 --> 01:52:50,476
Don't make too much noise.

929
01:52:51,121 --> 01:52:52,349
It's a secret.

930
01:52:52,823 --> 01:52:54,814
A secret? I love secrets.

931
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:59,390
- What's the secret?
- What we're doing, your Highness.

932
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:02,425
We're going to take you for a little ride.

933
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,991
Good. Where are we going?

934
01:53:05,169 --> 01:53:07,160
For a little ride, your Highness.

935
01:53:09,907 --> 01:53:11,204
In you go.

936
01:53:17,114 --> 01:53:18,445
Speed on.

937
01:53:32,629 --> 01:53:35,462
King, I'm going to be king.

938
01:54:12,636 --> 01:54:15,196
It'll do no good
to get the bars out off the windows.

939
01:54:15,339 --> 01:54:16,772
You and your stupid ideas.

940
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:19,272
Max can't accomplish anything
with a pen knife.

941
01:54:19,476 --> 01:54:21,876
And if he could,
it's at least a 100-foot drop.

942
01:54:32,222 --> 01:54:37,285
Unhand me! You blackguards, scoundrels!
Unhand me!

943
01:54:37,561 --> 01:54:39,620
I demand to see the American Consul.

944
01:54:41,065 --> 01:54:42,999
You blundering idiots!

945
01:54:43,233 --> 01:54:46,828
You'll answer to my government
for this outrage! Outrage!

946
01:54:47,204 --> 01:54:50,731
You have kidnapped me.
Fate the Magnificent!

947
01:54:50,908 --> 01:54:53,877
Let's get practical.
I don't care what you do to the others...

948
01:54:53,977 --> 01:54:56,605
...as long as you let me go.
What do you say to $500?

949
01:55:11,395 --> 01:55:12,726
Professor...

950
01:55:13,897 --> 01:55:17,060
...allow me to present
His Royal Highness, Prince Hapnick.

951
01:55:17,401 --> 01:55:19,232
Heir to the throne of Carpania.

952
01:55:29,346 --> 01:55:30,813
Hi, there.

953
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:47,690
It's out!

954
01:56:22,299 --> 01:56:23,061
No!

955
01:56:23,367 --> 01:56:24,994
I suggest you reconsider.

956
01:56:25,536 --> 01:56:26,867
I won't do it!

957
01:56:27,905 --> 01:56:29,896
Then you leave us no alternative.

958
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:31,129
I'll do it.

959
01:56:33,143 --> 01:56:35,202
Don't just stand there, do something.

960
01:56:35,913 --> 01:56:37,972
Hezekiah, please wake up.

961
01:56:38,982 --> 01:56:40,074
Hezekiah?

962
01:56:42,152 --> 01:56:43,551
Please, Hezekiah.

963
01:56:44,655 --> 01:56:45,644
Max!

964
01:56:48,592 --> 01:56:49,957
Open this door!

965
01:56:50,394 --> 01:56:52,885
Max, you little rat! I'll get you for this.

966
01:57:07,744 --> 01:57:09,678
By tomorrow, you'll be king.

967
01:57:09,947 --> 01:57:13,542
After that you declare General Kuhster
chancellor and quietly abdicate.

968
01:57:14,518 --> 01:57:18,352
Your Highness,
remember one slip and you're dead.

969
01:57:19,456 --> 01:57:20,889
Aren't we all?

970
01:57:48,752 --> 01:57:49,810
Good evening.

971
01:57:52,122 --> 01:57:55,285
When we get back to the palace,
you must trim your mustache.

972
01:57:55,492 --> 01:57:57,585
You must look exactly like the prince.

973
01:57:58,662 --> 01:57:59,890
Can you laugh?

974
01:58:00,297 --> 01:58:01,924
What do you mean can I laugh?

975
01:58:02,032 --> 01:58:04,796
- The prince has a very individual laugh.
- Like what?

976
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:17,176
No, that's much too bass.
The prince is more of a soprano. Try it.

977
01:58:18,582 --> 01:58:19,981
Try it once more.

978
01:59:03,293 --> 01:59:05,420
I demand to know what this is all about.

979
01:59:05,529 --> 01:59:07,656
You've been told. You're under arrest.

980
01:59:07,964 --> 01:59:09,397
I know, but for what?

981
01:59:09,499 --> 01:59:11,490
- Spying.
- Spying?

982
01:59:18,842 --> 01:59:22,972
At last, the Great Leslie is finished.
I've won!

983
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:26,149
They said I never could. Get off of the bed!

984
01:59:26,483 --> 01:59:30,317
Don't you try any double-crosses,
my friend, keep our deal.

985
01:59:30,554 --> 01:59:33,489
He stays in the pokey
until I'm safely in Paris.

986
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:36,718
When it comes to double-crossers,
you are looking at the king!

987
01:59:37,794 --> 01:59:41,025
Not until you've trimmed your mustache,
Your Majesty.

988
01:59:45,102 --> 01:59:46,467
I hate you.

989
02:00:22,372 --> 02:00:24,135
I've come to see the Great Leslie.

990
02:00:24,241 --> 02:00:26,835
I'm sorry, Padre,
I can't let anyone see the prisoner...

991
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:28,537
...without the proper authority.

992
02:00:28,645 --> 02:00:30,704
I understand. Bless you, my son.

993
02:01:02,279 --> 02:01:03,303
Leslie!

994
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:05,243
I'm here. In here.

995
02:01:11,988 --> 02:01:14,183
- Max!
- We've got to save the professor.

996
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:17,093
What about Miss Dubois and Hezekiah?

997
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:19,091
- They're with the baron.
- The baron?

998
02:01:19,463 --> 02:01:22,023
He's got everybody.
We've got to go save the professor.

999
02:01:50,093 --> 02:01:51,958
Stop! Stop!

1000
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:54,892
Escaped?

1001
02:01:55,198 --> 02:01:56,825
With a small friar.

1002
02:01:57,234 --> 02:01:59,225
Leslie escaped with a chicken?

1003
02:01:59,402 --> 02:02:02,803
No, you idiot, with a friar.
A monk. A priest.

1004
02:02:03,106 --> 02:02:04,232
What should we do?

1005
02:02:04,307 --> 02:02:06,502
The coronation must take place
without delay.

1006
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:09,443
With Leslie free, every minute counts.

1007
02:02:15,585 --> 02:02:18,577
You're right. With Leslie on the loose,
every second counts.

1008
02:02:22,526 --> 02:02:25,086
Are you sure that the baron's castle
is on a lake?

1009
02:02:25,295 --> 02:02:27,058
I'm positive. Great big lake.

1010
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:29,858
And the only lake on this map
is straight ahead.

1011
02:02:34,271 --> 02:02:35,761
You're not serious?

1012
02:02:36,606 --> 02:02:38,005
Deadly serious.

1013
02:02:39,276 --> 02:02:40,903
You're a sadistic fiend.

1014
02:02:41,411 --> 02:02:44,574
He has only to answer
a few simple questions.

1015
02:02:44,848 --> 02:02:46,839
Not the mustache.

1016
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:50,980
Why did you come here?

1017
02:02:52,722 --> 02:02:53,984
Who sent you?

1018
02:02:56,226 --> 02:02:57,818
- Proceed.
- No!

1019
02:02:58,895 --> 02:03:01,329
Touch one hair on his head
and you'll answer to...

1020
02:03:01,398 --> 02:03:04,458
...Teddy Roosevelt
and the United States government!

1021
02:03:04,534 --> 02:03:06,729
"My country 'tis of thee

1022
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:11,339
"Sweet land of liberty of thee I sing"

1023
02:03:19,583 --> 02:03:23,110
That's it. On the lake.
Come on, we'll save the professor.

1024
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:28,216
Maximillian, if Miss Dubois and Hezekiah
are not in that castle...

1025
02:03:28,358 --> 02:03:31,521
They're there, I swear it.
Come on, save the professor.

1026
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:36,555
They're there. Cross my heart.

1027
02:03:42,038 --> 02:03:43,869
Terrific.

1028
02:03:45,375 --> 02:03:49,175
What's more, do as I tell you.
Stay down. Down.

1029
02:03:54,584 --> 02:03:57,485
"Land where our fathers died

1030
02:03:57,854 --> 02:04:03,190
"Land of thy pilgrim's pride
from every mountainside

1031
02:04:03,393 --> 02:04:06,021
"Let freedom ring"

1032
02:04:06,997 --> 02:04:08,487
Shut up, Professor.

1033
02:04:23,079 --> 02:04:24,205
They're there.

1034
02:06:37,847 --> 02:06:40,008
Here comes the Marines!

1035
02:07:56,192 --> 02:07:57,625
Good evening, Baron.

1036
02:07:58,161 --> 02:08:00,595
Well, Mr. Leslie.

1037
02:08:01,598 --> 02:08:03,259
What a pleasant surprise.

1038
02:08:03,933 --> 02:08:06,424
I half expected to see you again, but...

1039
02:08:07,871 --> 02:08:09,668
...not with a sword in your hand.

1040
02:08:09,973 --> 02:08:11,440
Do you prefer the foil?

1041
02:08:11,574 --> 02:08:14,008
Not particularly.
It happened to be convenient.

1042
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:16,044
I presume you know how to use one.

1043
02:08:17,447 --> 02:08:19,438
I hope that won't be necessary.

1044
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:21,547
I'm sure you do.

1045
02:08:25,221 --> 02:08:27,849
Will you release Miss Dubois
and the others?

1046
02:08:28,791 --> 02:08:31,021
- No.
- I'm afraid this will be necessary.

1047
02:08:31,327 --> 02:08:33,056
You're being very foolish.

1048
02:08:33,363 --> 02:08:37,129
That's an assumption, Baron. You make
me the victim even before we start.

1049
02:08:38,201 --> 02:08:39,259
It's your life.

1050
02:08:39,769 --> 02:08:43,068
You're assuming again. En garde.

1051
02:09:05,828 --> 02:09:08,991
Very adroit, Mr. Leslie. Very skilled.

1052
02:09:35,191 --> 02:09:39,059
My compliments, Mr. Leslie.
You handle the foil very well.

1053
02:09:39,429 --> 02:09:41,090
Thank you, Baron. So do you.

1054
02:09:41,331 --> 02:09:44,892
Personally, I prefer a man's weapon.
How are you with a saber?

1055
02:09:45,234 --> 02:09:47,031
There's only one way to find out.

1056
02:10:06,255 --> 02:10:07,882
Surround him!

1057
02:10:09,692 --> 02:10:11,626
Look out! Look out!

1058
02:10:14,397 --> 02:10:15,989
Oh, the smoke!

1059
02:11:56,199 --> 02:11:57,427
Running away, Baron?

1060
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,798
As a very wise English gentleman
once said:

1061
02:11:59,869 --> 02:12:03,066
"He who fights and runs away,
may live to fight another day."

1062
02:12:03,272 --> 02:12:05,934
So until another day, Mr. Leslie.

1063
02:12:08,911 --> 02:12:12,278
Please excuse me. I have a boat waiting.

1064
02:13:36,098 --> 02:13:37,429
Faster!

1065
02:15:13,129 --> 02:15:15,689
Professor, the jig is up.

1066
02:15:38,554 --> 02:15:40,181
Your Highness.

1067
02:15:41,090 --> 02:15:44,423
Your Royal Highness.
Your Royal Highness!

1068
02:16:06,382 --> 02:16:10,375
Wait, Your Royal Highness! My prince!

1069
02:16:19,295 --> 02:16:20,922
Out of the way!

1070
02:16:23,399 --> 02:16:25,196
Your Highness.

1071
02:16:49,492 --> 02:16:52,859
Your Highness,
we've got to get out of here!

1072
02:17:04,473 --> 02:17:07,670
You wouldn't dare!

1073
02:17:23,292 --> 02:17:24,281
Please!

1074
02:17:40,042 --> 02:17:42,374
Wait for me. Wait for me.

1075
02:18:01,397 --> 02:18:02,955
- Your Majesty.
- Hi, there.

1076
02:18:11,373 --> 02:18:12,635
Brandy!

1077
02:18:13,042 --> 02:18:14,339
Throw more brandy.

1078
02:18:15,978 --> 02:18:17,502
More brandy.

1079
02:18:18,113 --> 02:18:20,445
Brandy. Throw more brandy.

1080
02:18:24,053 --> 02:18:28,422
Rum. I never mix my pies.
I want to play, too.

1081
02:18:39,835 --> 02:18:41,393
Miss Dubois!

1082
02:18:46,175 --> 02:18:47,540
Hey, Professor!

1083
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:52,908
Hey, Professor.

1084
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:09,891
Hey, Professor!

1085
02:19:15,838 --> 02:19:18,932
You. You're the cause of it all.
It was your idea.

1086
02:19:19,141 --> 02:19:21,473
No, Your Highness.
It was Baron Von Stuppe.

1087
02:19:21,577 --> 02:19:24,546
I don't care. You're banished!

1088
02:19:24,647 --> 02:19:29,084
I'm getting a new tucker-inner.
Banished, banished!

1089
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,152
Miss Dubois!

1090
02:19:47,603 --> 02:19:48,968
Hey, Professor!

1091
02:19:51,674 --> 02:19:55,701
- Hey, Professor, where are you?
- Right here, you idiot.

1092
02:19:56,111 --> 02:19:59,308
Terrific. Let's go. I got the car.

1093
02:19:59,848 --> 02:20:02,476
More pies! More pies!

1094
02:20:07,656 --> 02:20:09,920
Oh, Leslie! Leslie!

1095
02:20:26,809 --> 02:20:30,040
Goodbye. Farewell, you good Leslie, you.

1096
02:20:30,279 --> 02:20:33,112
I hope you win. I hope you win!

1097
02:20:34,216 --> 02:20:36,309
I'll miss him. Oh, there it is!

1098
02:20:38,387 --> 02:20:39,786
General?

1099
02:21:21,597 --> 02:21:23,258
E Flat.

1100
02:21:29,304 --> 02:21:31,272
I think I better go and fix the car.

1101
02:23:05,834 --> 02:23:08,029
- Miss Dubois.
- Yes?

1102
02:23:10,038 --> 02:23:13,530
I believe the time has come for us
to resolve our differences.

1103
02:23:15,077 --> 02:23:16,237
Good.

1104
02:23:18,313 --> 02:23:22,272
As you know, I've steadfastly maintained...

1105
02:23:22,551 --> 02:23:27,045
...an uncompromising position about
women's rights and the equality of sexes.

1106
02:23:27,856 --> 02:23:29,187
As have I.

1107
02:23:30,292 --> 02:23:34,353
Therefore, it is safe to assume that
has been the principal area of our conflict.

1108
02:23:35,564 --> 02:23:37,054
No doubt about it.

1109
02:23:38,767 --> 02:23:41,702
Therefore,
in the interest of progress and harmony...

1110
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:44,566
...I am willing to concede
to your point of view.

1111
02:23:48,243 --> 02:23:49,574
Concede?

1112
02:23:54,082 --> 02:23:56,949
You are an emancipated woman,
Miss Dubois.

1113
02:23:57,486 --> 02:24:00,353
And I am an emancipated man.

1114
02:24:47,469 --> 02:24:49,164
Come back here.

1115
02:24:52,841 --> 02:24:56,106
You are the most unreasonable,
inconsistent female...

1116
02:24:56,245 --> 02:24:58,475
- I'm unreasonable? I'm inconsistent?
- Yes.

1117
02:24:58,714 --> 02:25:00,739
What about you? Talk about inconsistent.

1118
02:25:00,816 --> 02:25:03,114
- Inconsistent!
- And unreasonable.

1119
02:25:03,218 --> 02:25:05,015
- Unreasonable!
- And arrogant.

1120
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:07,088
- Arrogant!
- Yes, arrogant!

1121
02:25:07,155 --> 02:25:10,352
All right, Miss Dubois,
let's discuss arrogance for a moment.

1122
02:25:10,425 --> 02:25:12,552
All right, Mr. Leslie. Let's.

1123
02:25:16,398 --> 02:25:20,994
Any woman who has the unmitigated
arrogance to consider herself man's equal.

1124
02:25:21,069 --> 02:25:24,835
Any man who has the arrogance
to consider himself better than a woman.

1125
02:25:24,907 --> 02:25:28,035
- Any fool knows that a woman cannot...
- That's right! Any fool!

1126
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:31,941
- You know what's the matter with you?
- I know what's the matter with you.

1127
02:25:33,282 --> 02:25:34,544
What did I tell you?

1128
02:25:34,616 --> 02:25:37,608
She's going to win the race for us.
The buffalo-headed vixen!

1129
02:25:38,987 --> 02:25:41,285
- I tried to kiss you.
- I know what you tried.

1130
02:25:41,356 --> 02:25:43,824
You're the one
that's been preaching emancipation.

1131
02:25:57,906 --> 02:26:02,002
We're going to win, Max.
We're going to win!

1132
02:26:02,611 --> 02:26:05,205
I think you turn right at the next corner.

1133
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:21,396
- You're not talking about equal rights.
- I know what I'm talking about.

1134
02:26:21,463 --> 02:26:24,591
You're talking about
some convenient feminine utopia...

1135
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,833
...that has all of the advantages
and no responsibilities.

1136
02:26:27,936 --> 02:26:29,301
- Responsibilities?
- Yes!

1137
02:26:29,371 --> 02:26:32,101
Look who's talking about responsibilities.
Turn right.

1138
02:26:35,377 --> 02:26:38,505
- Go back and turn right.
- We do not turn right.

1139
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:40,514
- I know Paris.
- So do I.

1140
02:26:40,582 --> 02:26:43,608
You have to turn right
in order to get to the Eiffel Tower.

1141
02:26:43,685 --> 02:26:47,177
If we turn right back there,
we'd end up on the Montmartre Steps.

1142
02:27:10,779 --> 02:27:13,612
You talk a good fight,
but when it comes down to it...

1143
02:27:13,682 --> 02:27:17,413
...you're as emancipated
as a confirmed spinster in a knitting bee.

1144
02:27:17,486 --> 02:27:18,953
How would you know?

1145
02:27:19,021 --> 02:27:22,821
You're a suffragette. You're the one
who wanted to bring sex out in the open.

1146
02:27:23,158 --> 02:27:27,151
So I brought it out into the open and
I got slapped in the face for my trouble.

1147
02:27:27,596 --> 02:27:32,260
Your interpretation of bringing sex out into
the open and mine are two different things.

1148
02:27:32,334 --> 02:27:35,360
Well, will you please tell me
what your concept of sex is?

1149
02:27:35,437 --> 02:27:36,563
Gladly!

1150
02:27:51,253 --> 02:27:53,244
You and your stupid map!

1151
02:27:53,388 --> 02:27:56,687
She's still with him. You said
if she was with him, we couldn't lose.

1152
02:27:56,825 --> 02:27:57,382
Shut up!

1153
02:28:18,547 --> 02:28:22,108
And because I consider myself sexually free
and morally emancipated...

1154
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:26,812
...l'm a responsible, discriminating woman
who doesn't intend to jump into bed...

1155
02:28:26,955 --> 02:28:30,618
...with the first muscular egocentric male
who thinks he can seduce me...

1156
02:28:30,725 --> 02:28:33,888
...by agreeing with some of the things
I believe in.

1157
02:28:33,962 --> 02:28:36,692
- I only wanted to kiss you.
- Why?

1158
02:28:36,932 --> 02:28:38,763
Because I love you, that's why.

1159
02:28:39,768 --> 02:28:42,236
- You don't believe me?
- I do not.

1160
02:28:46,374 --> 02:28:48,604
- What are you doing?
- Proving that I love you.

1161
02:28:48,677 --> 02:28:50,201
You'll lose the race.

1162
02:28:50,378 --> 02:28:52,573
Can you think of a better way to prove it?

1163
02:29:05,827 --> 02:29:07,658
Max, I won!

1164
02:29:09,097 --> 02:29:11,998
- I won!
- We won!

1165
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:13,497
- I won!
- We won!

1166
02:29:15,737 --> 02:29:18,171
- I am invincible!
- We won!

1167
02:29:18,306 --> 02:29:20,171
I have beaten Leslie at last.

1168
02:29:22,677 --> 02:29:24,668
The world is mine!

1169
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:33,910
You lost.

1170
02:29:34,556 --> 02:29:36,046
Only the race.

1171
02:29:39,561 --> 02:29:41,552
I am king!

1172
02:29:41,863 --> 02:29:44,024
I am the king.

1173
02:29:44,266 --> 02:29:49,397
No, I'm not! I didn't beat him.
He let me win!

1174
02:29:49,804 --> 02:29:52,204
I can't win this way.
I can only win one way:

1175
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:54,570
My way! They let me win!

1176
02:29:54,709 --> 02:29:58,509
I can't win your way. You cheated.

1177
02:29:58,947 --> 02:30:00,278
You cheated.

1178
02:30:01,049 --> 02:30:04,280
You cheated! You cheated!

1179
02:30:04,753 --> 02:30:07,449
You cheated. I hate you.

1180
02:30:07,989 --> 02:30:09,980
I refuse to accept!

1181
02:30:10,192 --> 02:30:13,286
I won't win any way but my way.
You ruined my reputation!

1182
02:30:13,395 --> 02:30:16,057
Do you hear? You, I hate!

1183
02:30:16,298 --> 02:30:18,459
You with your hair
 that is always combed.

1184
02:30:18,533 --> 02:30:21,627
Your suit is always white.
Your car is always clean.

1185
02:30:21,770 --> 02:30:26,639
I refuse to accept.
I challenge you to another race.

1186
02:30:29,911 --> 02:30:31,879
- Get off my hood.
- Another race!

1187
02:31:21,229 --> 02:31:23,220
Come on, Professor, go!

1188
02:31:25,634 --> 02:31:27,101
Come on, go, go!

1189
02:31:27,168 --> 02:31:30,899
