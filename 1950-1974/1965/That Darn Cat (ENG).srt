1
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,872
While the city sleeps

2
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,075
Every night he creeps

3
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,483
Just surveyin' his domain

4
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,780
He roams around
like he owns the town

5
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:09,259
He's the king
He makes that plain

6
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:15,063
He knows every trick
Doesn't miss a lick

7
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,297
When it comes to keepin' fat

8
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,865
Some city slicker
No one is quicker

9
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,968
Than

10
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,808
That darn cat

11
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,018
Every nook and cranny

12
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,392
And garbage can he inspects

13
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,023
So thoroughly

14
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,693
When he's on his rounds

15
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,895
Nothin's out of bounds

16
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,406
To his curiosity

17
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,903
He can smile and purr

18
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,172
At a pretty her

19
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,976
Till she don't know
where she's at

20
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,049
Nose like a Geiger

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,556
Oh, what a tiger is

22
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,148
That darn cat

23
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,093
He's a sly old codger

24
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,255
An artful dodger

25
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,596
A scrounger unsurpassed

26
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,063
A ball of fire

27
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,231
A nine-live wire

28
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,141
Who just can't be outclassed

29
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,735
Yeah, this midnight rover

30
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,747
He lives in clover

31
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,410
It's an art he's got down pat

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,013
Never was a greater

33
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,252
Smooth operator than that

34
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,354
Darn

35
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,729
That darn cat

36
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:03,007
That darn cat

37
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,477
That darn cat

38
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,979
That darn cat

39
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,020
That darn cat

40
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,193
Hey, what do you say, fella?

41
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,888
Hey, you're taking my food, huh?

42
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,756
Iggy.

43
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,031
- What kept you?
- The lousy buses.

44
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,440
- Where'd you leave the car?
- Outside of Fresno, Route 99.

45
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,444
All right. Okay. They found it.

46
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,140
- The scan came in on the radio.
- What'd I tell you?

47
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,378
The fuzz'll fall for the whole deal,
hook, line and sinker.

48
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,114
Maybe. We've got
the federal fuzz on us this time.

49
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,554
So what? Who cares?

50
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,956
Wait till they pick up them hot 20s
I've been dropping off

51
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,121
all the way up the valley.
They're gonna lose their minds.

52
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,222
Look at us,
livin' in this solid pad,

53
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,427
a block and a half away
from where we pulled the job.

54
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,902
What about them headlines?
We're big news.

55
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,871
Front page,
every one of them...

56
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,534
- Shut up, will you?
- Shut up? Sure.

57
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,976
"Two bank robbers
stage daring, daylight holdup."

58
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,345
Hey, how about that, huh?
"Daring... daring."

59
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,680
"Two armed men
wearing Halloween masks

60
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,151
robbed the North Valley bank
early today...

61
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,348
- I gotta look.
...seizing a teller,

62
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,051
Miss Margaret Miller,
to shield their getaway."

63
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,393
Wow. Does this turn you on, huh?

64
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,693
Two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.

65
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,633
- Iggy.
- Wow.

66
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:50,233
Iggy, we don't get 250,000
like the papers say.

67
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,142
We get 160 grand.

68
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,575
A hundred and six...

69
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,248
- Are you tryin' to snow me?
- Get your hands off me, meatball.

70
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,685
Get 'em off.

71
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,484
Don't you do that again.

72
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,887
A hundred and sixty.

73
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,995
How come the papers
don't say that?

74
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,093
- Do you believe the papers or me?
- What do I know?

75
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,934
I've been out risking my neck,
laying phony leads.

76
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,771
You've been in here,
sitting on the glue.

77
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,243
Well, why don't you ask
Miss America there?

78
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,405
She's the money lady.

79
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,680
Hey, it was a quarter million,
wasn't it?

80
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:36,051
Two hundred grand?

81
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,557
One lousy hundred sixty...

82
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,418
Don't do it, Iggy.

83
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,794
What I want to know is,
how come it don't bother you, huh?

84
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,166
Two of you wouldn't
have cooked this up?

85
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,671
Oh, come on, Iggy.
You're more of a drag than she is.

86
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,104
All right,
what are we gonna do about her?

87
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:59,304
To tell you the truth,
she's been a pretty good girl.

88
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,280
No hysteriaville, no gas.
No struggling.

89
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,817
She's got consideration
for other people.

90
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,080
I say we ought to
turn her off right now.

91
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,349
Is that another one
of your big ideas?

92
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,217
You see this?

93
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,455
Everyone in town is gonna be lookin'
at our girl's picture.

94
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,192
They dig her now,
all those helpful little citizens.

95
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:24,703
And that one little old man,
Eyewitness Charlie, with 20l20 vision.

96
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,170
Who always happens
to be looking out a window

97
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,173
when you're dragging out a body.

98
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:33,575
- What's the action then?
- We cool it, cool it, all of us.

99
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,605
- Cool it.
- Mother, I'm gonna take this gag off.

100
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,276
You got any ideas about noise?

101
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,182
All right. That's good...

102
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,748
...because I've got sensitive ears,

103
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,489
and when someone yells,
I do things.

104
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,430
Things like make me hate myself
in the morning.

105
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,064
Now, Mother, here's the picture.

106
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,469
We hole up here a few days.
We're stuck with you.

107
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,031
Now, we don't want you getting sick
or scared or finking out.

108
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,546
That's no good.
Not for us. Not for you.

109
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,248
What are you
gonna do with me?

110
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,742
Well, first you've got
to believe one thing.

111
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,721
One killing, more or less,
won't make any difference.

112
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,189
We've got nothin' to lose.

113
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:24,321
Anybody we knock off from here on in,
is just a little more gravy, see?

114
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,730
- I understand.
- That's solid, Moms.

115
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,825
Come on.
Let's make with the cookin'.

116
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,029
Iggy brought groceries. Come on.

117
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,609
We got steaks, we got salmon.
What's it gonna be?

118
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,476
Steak. I'll have mine rare.

119
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,209
Make mine well.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

120
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,979
Some desperate character
I got for a partner, huh?

121
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,073
All right, fleabag,
get out of here.

122
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,042
- Let him stay a while, Dan.
- What for?

123
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,409
- I like cats.
- You like cats?

124
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,075
Yeah. I ever tell you about
Acey-Deucy, my old cat?

125
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,280
- No, and you ain't going to.
- As long as he was alive, I was lucky.

126
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:25,585
- He was a real friend.
- You're breaking my heart.

127
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,922
Come on, I want to talk to you.

128
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,953
Don't stand there flapping your ears.
Make with the cooking.

129
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,864
I like the cat.

130
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,696
Don't forget, I'm watching you.

131
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,330
I don't trust that dame.
I don't trust her.

132
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,939
I don't want you to trust her.

133
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,403
The thing is,
she might play along

134
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,417
if we con her into thinking
we might turn her loose.

135
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,318
- You wouldn't, would you?
- Are you out of your mind?

136
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,637
Nah, you're kidding.

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,785
What's holding you up?
Move it, will you?

138
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,291
I think my watch stopped.

139
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,487
What do I care?
What's with the watch?

140
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,963
- I wanted to time the steaks.
- That's a clock, ain't it?

141
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,932
Move it, will you?

142
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,744
What do you think you're doing?

143
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,290
Not that way, Dan,
somebody will hear.

144
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,383
He wanted to go out.

145
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,860
I... I didn't make a break.

146
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,024
I... I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't.

147
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,731
Okay.

148
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,839
Okay.

149
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,476
Because I got friends.

150
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,970
Ten little lead-nosed friends in here.

151
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,312
And they all run faster
than you do, Moms.

152
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,487
I know.

153
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,750
Now, let's get one thing straight.

154
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,755
Don't touch that door again.

155
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,523
Not that door,
or any window in there.

156
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,929
- You got that straight?
- Got it?

157
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,899
- Yes.
- You just used up all your luck, lady.

158
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,940
Now, don't try me again.

159
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,100
How about Thursday night
at the drive-in?

160
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:29,072
- What's playing?
- Night of the Surter.

161
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,905
- What was that we saw tonight?
- Surter Beach Party.

162
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,310
- And the night before last?
- Son of Surt and Sinbad the Surter.

163
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,872
- Double feature.
- Canoe...

164
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,043
Do you ever get a spooky feeling

165
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,020
that we keep seeing
the same movie over and over?

166
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,488
And all they do
is change the titles a little?

167
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,821
Yeah, it's terrific stuff, isn't it?

168
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,489
Couldn't we, just once,
see a nice quiet movie,

169
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,794
where boy meets girl,
they have problems

170
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,462
which aren't weird, they fall in love,
and live happily ever after?

171
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,472
Why would you want
to see unhealthy stuff like that?

172
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,304
Oh, I don't know. Maybe once
I'd like to go to a movie

173
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,003
where I don't get seasick.

174
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,013
I'll make you a deal.
You go with me Thursday night,

175
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:13,211
next time I'll take you to one of those
happily ever after clambakes. Deal?

176
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,152
- I guess.
- Where's the thing playing?

177
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,392
Oh, who knows? Maybe they don't
make movies like that anymore.

178
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,188
Well, sure.
You wanna know why?

179
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,424
Because people don't want to
be depressed by all that slop.

180
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,435
Ha! That Henderson boy went
right into the house with her.

181
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,571
Right into the house.

182
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,305
She and the Henderson boy,
the two of them.

183
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,108
Why shouldn't he go
in the house?

184
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,639
He's been hanging around
since he was old enough to wave bye-bye.

185
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,118
Nevertheless,
they happen to represent

186
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,554
two separate and distinct
members of the opposite sex.

187
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:54,786
- Alone, in that house.
- You tell them, kid.

188
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,828
With their parents all over Europe,

189
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,363
someone's got to keep an eye
on those girls.

190
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,762
Meantime,

191
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,735
by authority of
the Federal Communications Commission,

192
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,033
and the grace of
a kindly Providence,

193
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,405
which gave me the power of
not having to listen to people,

194
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,740
I am now going off the air.

195
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,212
Don't you dare take that thing off!
I haven't finished talking.

196
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,273
Good night, old woman.
I can't hear what you're sayin',

197
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:24,050
but whatever it is,
I disagree with you 100 percent.

198
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,560
You're out of peanut butter.
How come there aren't any olives?

199
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,501
- Put them on the shopping list.
- Okay.

200
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,401
Hi, DC.

201
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,103
You know, Patti,
sometimes you worry me.

202
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,475
You don't eat enough
to keep a bird alive.

203
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,845
Canoe. This is just a wild idea,
but has it ever occurred to you

204
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,384
there's more to life
than surfing and eating?

205
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,716
- Like what?
- Forget it.

206
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,249
I just realized
I was talking to myself.

207
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:02,225
- Hey, your folks are in Venice.
- I know.

208
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,253
Your father got indigestion
from a clam sauce, but feels better now.

209
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,889
Huh.

210
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,962
Bills, bills, bills.
Look at this, nothing but bills.

211
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,640
Surf news should be
comin' up about now.

212
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,678
You listen. I'm gonna straighten up
and go off to bed.

213
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,543
- Okay.
- Hi, DC.

214
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,846
Watch the crumbs, will you, fellas?

215
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,857
Pass the word. Watch the crumbs.

216
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,325
According to authorities,

217
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,420
the desperados and their victim
may have traveled north

218
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,863
in an effort to escape this area.

219
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,096
- Their car was discovered on...
- That's Miss Miller.

220
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,796
...outside of Fresno.
- Who?

221
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:50,069
Miss Miller, the Christmas Club window
at the bank.

222
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,976
- I've known her for years.
- Oh, yeah, so have I.

223
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,071
She goes to our Laundromat.

224
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,548
Kind of creepy, isn't it?

225
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,553
All this happening in your
own neighborhood, to people you know.

226
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,522
Want me to stick around
until your sister comes home?

227
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,116
- You know, the protecting bit.
- No, thanks.

228
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,557
All right.

229
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,598
And now, surters,
here's the word for tomorrow.

230
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,193
This is your Weather Gremmie with
the beach news for the a.m.

231
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,206
Goleta to Zuma,
sea conditions light to moderate.

232
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:26,734
Malibu, moderate in the early morning,
with some real heavies expected.

233
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,781
Hey, Pat, surf's up tomorrow at Malibu.
You want to go?

234
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,645
Yeah, sure.
Good night.

235
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,514
Good night.

236
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,816
That's all for tonight, surters.
The word is "go."

237
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,289
See you at the beach.

238
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,589
Mmm. Come on, here. Come on.

239
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,962
That's a good boy.
Good one.

240
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:53,636
Wow. 11:15?
Man, I gotta get some sleep.

241
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,403
- I thought we'd almost had it there.
- Sorry, one of Patti's friends.

242
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,344
Is it a date, then?

243
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,819
You won't regret it, I'm sure.
Mother is an extremely fine cook.

244
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,982
- I'm sure she is, Gregory.
- Mother cooks the best duck.

245
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,459
And as for the duck,
did I tell you it was a Gadwall?

246
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,058
No, I don't believe you did.

247
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,827
I, uh, stood all day
in a duck blind to get it.

248
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,699
In the pouring rain.
I almost got pneumonia.

249
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,070
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No. It's all right. It was worth it.

250
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,803
Well worth it.
It's a beautiful creature.

251
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,937
Perfectly beautiful. Superb eating.

252
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,712
Mother... Mother prepares duck

253
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,276
in the classic, old-fashioned way.

254
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,789
She hangs it out
on the screen porch

255
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,724
for 48 hours before cooking.

256
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,988
It makes all the difference
in the world.

257
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,293
- All the difference in the world.
- I, um...

258
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,766
I'm looking forward
to meeting your mother.

259
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,359
I've heard so much about her.

260
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,928
I know you two are gonna be
the very best of friends.

261
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,609
And now...

262
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,668
- Good night.
- Good night.

263
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,315
I'll see you in the morning.

264
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,079
Same time as usual?

265
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,129
Quiet, Blitzy.

266
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:44,766
Good night,
my little beauties.

267
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,730
Oh!

268
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,920
Okay, where's the duck?

269
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,893
- I beg your pardon.
- I want my duck!

270
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,130
Your duck?

271
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,172
If you please.

272
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,174
I'm sorry,
I really don't know...

273
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,405
Where is that sneaky,
miserable guttersnipe?

274
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,410
- He's got my duck.
- What duck?

275
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,075
Don't you dare pretend with me.

276
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,949
- I saw him come in here with it.
- You saw who come in?

277
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,454
Patricia Randall,
I have had all I can take.

278
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,118
That rotten cat of yours,
he molests my prize albino fantails,

279
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,492
crawls all over my car every time
I wash it with his muddy paws.

280
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,053
He digs up Mother's bulbs.

281
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,895
He's driven my dog to the brink
of a nervous breakdown.

282
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,491
You mean DC?

283
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,561
Well, I'm sorry,
but actually, he isn't my cat.

284
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,231
He isn't anybody's cat.

285
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,606
What are you talking about?
He lives here, doesn't he?

286
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,078
Of course, but don't you see?
You don't own someone like DC.

287
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,047
He's family.

288
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,847
Oh,
but what am I gonna do?

289
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,250
Shoot. I spent all day
in a duck blind.

290
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,086
Humph! Pouring rain.

291
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,217
And I get one duck.

292
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,286
One single Gadwall.

293
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:49,322
And that flea-raddled fiend
had to go and steal it.

294
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,167
I know you're upset,
but be honest. It was dark, wasn't it?

295
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,264
It could have been that nasty cat
from across the street.

296
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,105
The one who does everything
that DC gets blamed for.

297
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,509
Now, do you think...

298
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,708
Oh, DC, how could you?

299
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,408
Hold this.

300
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,251
DC, give that to me this instant.

301
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,791
I want you to know
I'm very, very disappointed in you.

302
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,210
Oh, Gregory, I am sorry.

303
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,678
I can't think what
could have come over him.

304
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,444
Bad, bad cat. Ah!

305
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,850
"Bad, bad cat"?

306
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,953
You're a menace
to the whole neighborhood.

307
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,184
Mark you, if I had my way,

308
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,557
the authorities would
do away with you.

309
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,425
Now, wait a minute, Gregory.

310
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,862
DC's a cat.
He can't help his instincts.

311
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,957
He's a hunter, just like you are,

312
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,492
only he's not stupid enough
to sit out in the pouring rain all day.

313
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,868
Well!

314
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,932
Just let me make myself quite clear.
You better keep him locked up at night.

315
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,640
The next time I find him at our place,
I'll give him a pantsful of buckshot.

316
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,046
Nine times, if necessary.

317
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,421
I know.
I don't care for him much, either.

318
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,993
But he does have a point,
don't you think?

319
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,897
Was that Gregory
I heard down there?

320
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,331
- Correct.
- He sounded angry.

321
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,699
Yeah, I believe he was.

322
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,206
- What goes on around here, anyway?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

323
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,572
DC just happened to take a duck
off Gregory's back porch.

324
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,839
- "Happened" to take a duck?
- Yes.

325
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,179
Gregory came stamping and banging
over here to find it.

326
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,415
Furious. Made a perfect fool of himself.
I don't think he's a stable person.

327
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,184
- There goes my duck dinner.
- Your what?

328
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:57,194
He invited me to his house for dinner.
His mother was gonna fix the duck.

329
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,690
Fix the...

330
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,700
Ingrid, don't you see?
You're walking into a trap.

331
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,727
For goodness sakes, Gregory drives me
to work in the morning.

332
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,274
At night he picks me up
and he takes me home.

333
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,276
If he wants to go
to all that trouble,

334
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,313
the least I can do
is be courteous if he asks me to dinner.

335
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,610
How can you be so blind?

336
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,276
It began with
the old car pool routine, right?

337
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,288
Why shouldn't it? His law office
happens to be next door to where I work.

338
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,519
But the point is, there used to be
five people in that car,

339
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:31,153
then Gregory traded in his sedan
for a two-seater sports car.

340
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,596
And Mr. Burke,
Miss Patters and Miss Mosely

341
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:39,330
were ruthlessly squeezed out
to find other transportation, correct?

342
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,532
- Now, listen...
- Creeping matrimony, that's what it is.

343
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,808
The car pool, the duck dinner,
a movie here and there.

344
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,678
Inky, you're taking the gas
and you don't even know it.

345
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,944
Thank you, dear,
I'm sure you mean well,

346
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,486
but I think I can handle
the Gregory situation

347
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,851
in my own bumbling way.

348
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,151
I'm sorry, but I suppose at your age,

349
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,355
when that important person
hasn't come into your life,

350
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,194
- well...
- Well, what?

351
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,264
Well, I suppose a tinge,

352
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:16,137
just the faintest tinge, of desperation,
begins to blow your judgment.

353
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,803
Good night.

354
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:23,109
I can assure you, there is no tinge
of desperation in my outlook.

355
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,014
- And my vision is exceptionally clear.
- Good.

356
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,746
Which, I might add,
brings us to your friends.

357
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,310
- My friends?
- Yes, dear.

358
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,050
The one we've been tripping over
all these years.

359
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,752
Canoe? That's very unfair.

360
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,786
Canoe is...
well, he's just defenseless.

361
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,025
He's very sweet and young, and...

362
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,297
...needs help.
- I certainly agree he needs something.

363
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,964
Doesn't he do anything
but mope around in shorts

364
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,702
- and eat us out of house and home?
- Just shows how little you know him.

365
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,438
- Canoe has plenty of ambition.
- What?

366
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,572
To be the first 50-year-old surfer
at Santa Monica?

367
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,675
If you ask me, he's...
What's the matter?

368
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,152
DC's wearing a wristwatch.

369
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,952
Well, what will that dear, sweet,
innocent cat be bringing home next?

370
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,085
The Hope Diamond, I imagine.

371
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,629
- Where do you suppose he got it?
- I don't know.

372
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,565
Probably some child slipped it on,
or some teenager put it on for a joke.

373
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,331
Good night. Check with lost and found
in the morning.

374
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:31,845
Ingrid?

375
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,920
Look. Someone started to scratch
something on the casing.

376
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,924
See? "H-E,"
and that looks like part of an L.

377
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,155
H- E-L...

378
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:48,165
I'll bet somebody was trying to write
"help" and they were interrupted.

379
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,030
Somebody's in trouble.

380
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,695
What cooks in that wild
little head of yours now?

381
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,331
Somebody's in trouble.
I feel it in my bones.

382
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:58,967
You bet. Now get out and let me
go to sleep. I'm a working girl.

383
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,110
Don't you think
we ought to do something?

384
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,273
Good night.

385
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,596
Come on, DC, give.

386
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,722
Someone does need help, don't they?

387
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,360
I know you could find a way to tell me
if you really wanted to.

388
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,002
A smart cat like you.

389
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,246
You can be such a rat sometimes.

390
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,028
Don't say anything,
just point me towards the coffee.

391
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:52,995
What's wrong with you?

392
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,464
I didn't close my eyes once last night.

393
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,833
Oh, I've got huge dark circles
under my eyes.

394
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,873
- And me so young.
- What's bothering you?

395
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,075
I just couldn't stop thinking
about this watch.

396
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,273
Especially that pitiful
cry for help on the back.

397
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,976
Oh, you're not going to start that,
so help me...

398
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,145
You know, I thought
and thought and thought,

399
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,655
and I think I finally know the answer.

400
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,214
The watch belongs to her.

401
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,089
- The kidnapped woman?
- Yeah.

402
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,062
Come off it. How far out can you get?
Does it have a name?

403
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,826
No, but it's exactly the sort of watch

404
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,868
a woman like that would wear:

405
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,962
Feminine, yet...
bank tellerish, if you see what I mean.

406
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,304
Patti, you are absolutely impossible.

407
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,310
Have a nice day at the office, Inky.

408
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,781
You've got that terrible

409
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,579
butter-won't-melt-in-your-mouth
expression.

410
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,916
I know what's going on
in your little mind,

411
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,183
- and I forbid it.
- What do you mean?

412
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:56,057
You're not going to overdramatize this,
like you do everything else.

413
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,925
I absolutely forbid you to get
the police stirred up

414
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,455
with another of your hallucinations
about people in trouble.

415
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:05,093
You're not to go near
the police with that watch.

416
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,830
- Certainly.
- Bye.

417
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,897
- Good morning, Ingrid.
- Good morning.

418
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,875
Naturally, I wouldn't go to the police.

419
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,811
This is a job for the FBI.

420
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,866
May I help you?

421
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,839
- Yes, I'd like to see a, uh...
- We call them agents here.

422
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,671
- Yes, I'd like to see an agent.
- May I ask what about?

423
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,143
I have information
about one of your crimes.

424
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:51,648
- Thank you. Would you wait over there?
- Yes.

425
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,385
- These are for you, Mr. Hart.
- Thank you.

426
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,357
- I'm back at 11:00.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,020
- Morning, Hart.
- Good morning, Mr. Kelso.

428
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,393
- Hi, Vicky, anything for me?
- No, sir.

429
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,991
If Mr. Paul calls about
the bank records, put him through.

430
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,558
See you around.

431
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,567
- Is he an agent?
- Yes, he is.

432
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,110
- Nice face, hasn't he?
- Why, yes.

433
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,278
Yes, Mr. Ellender?
The messenger hasn't arrived yet.

434
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:32,188
I can put a tracer on it.

435
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,356
We haven't heard
from Denver all morning.

436
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,227
I'll connect you with Agent Morrow.
He's got the reports on that case.

437
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,336
Well, we've got 22 Howards
in Los Ángeles County.

438
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,065
Better start right at the top.

439
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,507
Mr. Kelso, I have something to report
on one of your cases.

440
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,978
It's a family cat.
He's called DC.

441
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,175
That means "Darn Cat."
Daddy named him,

442
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,481
he called him something worse,
Mother won't let us use that.

443
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,647
Excuse me.
First, what is your name?

444
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,123
Patricia Randall,
808 Pendelton Avenue.

445
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:47,160
Uh-huh, and what is
this information you have, Miss Randall?

446
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,858
It's DC, our cat.

447
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,699
He likes to prowl around at night,
as cats do. Nothing wrong with that.

448
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,706
And he likes people, as a general rule,
if they're nice and give him food.

449
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,173
He goes back.

450
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,710
I think he has a regular route
to pick out food,

451
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,678
sort of like a milkman in reverse.

452
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,410
- And this relates to one of our cases?
- Yes. Yes, it does.

453
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,282
Last night
DC was out roaming around,

454
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:11,913
and stole a duck from Mr. Benson
down the street.

455
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,685
Ah, Miss, um, Randall...

456
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,023
I'm afraid that
that's a police matter.

457
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:21,088
You see, our jurisdiction is limited
to certain fields of investigation.

458
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,998
At the present time,
duck stealing is not one of them.

459
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,798
How about bank robbery
and kidnapping?

460
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,309
Maybe I'd better hear
the rest of your story.

461
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,238
Thank you.

462
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:41,945
Well, last night DC came home
wearing a wristwatch.

463
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,914
- Wearing a wristwatch?
- Yes.

464
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,823
Instead of his collar.

465
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:53,887
And I couldn't help thinking what
I would do if I were poor Miss Miller,

466
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,798
held prisoner by two hoodlums,

467
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,598
and a stray cat came wandering in.

468
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,934
Don't you see? I'd try to put
something of mine on the cat as a clue.

469
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,308
Like a wristwatch, maybe even
try to scratch something on it.

470
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,040
Do you have this wristwatch?

471
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:14,107
Mr. Kelso, I knew you'd understand.
That's why I selected you personally.

472
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,719
Here.

473
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,182
You see, of course, on the back,

474
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,750
where she started to scratch
the word "help,"

475
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,591
- and was interrupted.
- Uh-huh.

476
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,463
"H-E..."
And that squiggle could be an "L."

477
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,095
Well, that doesn't quite
spell "help," does it?

478
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,265
She was wearing a wristwatch
at the time of her abduction.

479
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,740
We have only a superficial description.

480
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:43,075
- This may or may not be the watch.
- But wouldn't it be enough to start on?

481
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,316
I wonder if you could wait here
for just a few moments?

482
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,320
Of course. My entire day
is at your disposal.

483
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,087
Thank you, Miss Randall.

484
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,495
- It's a goofy idea.
- That's what I thought too, sir.

485
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,430
- The only thing is, I like it.
- You do, sir?

486
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,400
I don't like this paper chase
someone's leading us on.

487
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:07,494
Those 20-dollar bills from the bank
we've been picking up

488
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,668
- at convenient towns up the valley.
- They went in another direction?

489
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,234
Or stayed here in the city.
This watch lead ties in with that.

490
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,278
- How's your workload, Kelso?
- Me, sir?

491
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,716
Uh, well, I'm going over
old bank records on Johnny the Cooch.

492
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,584
- We're ready to trip him up.
- The Cooch can wait.

493
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,418
Kidnapping takes priority.

494
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,323
I want you to set up surveillance
and tail this cat.

495
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,918
- Tail the cat?
- He may take us to the criminals.

496
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,129
That's all.

497
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,167
Actually, I don't have
any experience in tailing cats.

498
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,396
For that matter, who does?

499
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,507
Sorry, sir. You wish me to set up
a surveillance on this informant,

500
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,135
exactly as if we thought of him
as a person?

501
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,978
Unless, of course, it works out better
to think of him as a cat.

502
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,948
Sir, I think it's only fair to tell you,
I don't get on well with cats.

503
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,423
There's a kind of an antagonism
between us.

504
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,960
- Is that so?
- Yes, and I have a slight allergy.

505
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:08,192
Allergy? I know the medical records
of every man in this office.

506
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,461
Have you been keeping
something from me?

507
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,695
It's a very small allergy, sir.

508
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,795
- Hardly worth mentioning.
- Don't.

509
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,932
Stay in touch. I'm available
on this case 24 hours a day.

510
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,900
Yes, sir.

511
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,182
Sir, it's just that every time
I'm around c...

512
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,241
C...

513
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,583
Gesundheit, and good luck.

514
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,551
Thank you, sir.

515
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:43,991
Yes, a lot of people
are gonna be sorry

516
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,434
for the things they said about DC.

517
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:50,440
Wait till they find out
he's working with the FBI.

518
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,499
I don't think we should expose

519
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:55,306
your cat's relationship with us
at this time.

520
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,007
I'd like to remain
as inconspicuous as possible.

521
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,518
You don't want everyone in the
neighborhood to know who you are?

522
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:04,179
Exactly. People tend
to become overstimulated

523
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,951
when they discover an FBI man
in the neighborhood.

524
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,551
It interferes with the quiet,
orderly process of investigation.

525
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,528
- Hmm.
- Especially kidnap cases.

526
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:15,087
See, this places the life
of the kidnap victim

527
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,134
into additional jeopardy.

528
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,328
We've gotta not
generate too much heat?

529
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,099
The kidnappers'll chicken out,
kill Miss Miller,

530
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,198
dispose of the remains
and take off?

531
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,176
Uh, that's one way to put it, yes.

532
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,183
You go first.

533
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:39,484
Remember, everything
quiet, calm, inconspicuous.

534
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,083
Quiet, calm, inconspicuous.

535
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,894
That brazen creature.
Right in broad daylight!

536
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,058
What are you cackling about now?

537
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,097
A strange man just went
into the house with Patti.

538
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,663
- So what?
- He was carrying a bag.

539
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,232
Don't get yourself up
in a sweat, old woman.

540
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,711
- It's probably the plumber.
- It was not the plumber!

541
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:40,717
- This man was nicely dressed.
- That's the way plumbers dress now.

542
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,650
The prices they charge these days,

543
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,382
I'm surprised he wasn't
wearing a tuxedo.

544
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:53,057
Do you have any friends?
People who are in and out all the time?

545
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,325
I'm afraid so.
Father always complained

546
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:59,165
we were running a rehabilitation center
for punch-drunk juveniles.

547
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:03,297
Uh-huh. I'd prefer a room
on the second floor, actually.

548
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,901
To reduce the chance of somebody
coming in and finding me at work.

549
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,411
- This your room?
- Ingrid's. My sister.

550
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,744
- Oh. Would she mind?
- No, not at all.

551
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,250
- She'd be only too happy to help.
- Good.

552
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,513
That's the side door
from the kitchen?

553
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:20,717
Yes, that's the exit DC uses when
he goes out for an evening on the town.

554
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,227
Uh-huh. Tonight, we'll set up
our communications unit in here.

555
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,853
Whatever you like.

556
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,991
All right. And now, I suppose
I'd better meet the c... c...

557
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:34,704
Bless you. What did you say?

558
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,667
I said I...

559
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,836
...suppose I...

560
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,075
...better meet the...

561
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,517
Ah, DC. He's probably goofing around
under the bed or something.

562
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,521
That's his favorite spot.

563
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,319
Ah, your sins have caught up with you.

564
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,492
This is your FBI.

565
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,997
Well. This is the...

566
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,964
...informant, as we say
down at the office.

567
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,060
Hear that, DC?
You're the informant now.

568
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,172
Nice little kitty cat.
Good, good kitty cat.

569
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,235
Is he friendly?

570
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,076
He almost got me that time.

571
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:20,639
He's all right.
Don't make any sudden moves

572
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,619
because it tends
to set off his reflexes or something.

573
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:27,248
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
Doesn't seem to like me, does he?

574
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,656
I guess that's a bad sign,
the kind of people

575
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,628
- that animals don't like?
- It doesn't mean a thing.

576
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,028
DC and Daddy loathe one another,

577
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,067
and Daddy's
the Lamb of the Year.

578
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,535
Say, I wonder if you would excuse me

579
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,971
for just one minute. I think we better
get this show on the road.

580
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,033
- What are you going to do?
- I have some work to do with DC

581
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,909
before we start our surveillance.
Photos and so on.

582
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,916
- Oh, for the papers, you mean?
- No, for our own people to study.

583
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,613
See, there's finger... pawprints,
plaster impressions...

584
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:01,124
...samples of his fur...

585
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,059
Bless you.
You're catching a terrible cold.

586
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,461
DC, pull yourself together.
You want me to get you something?

587
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,399
No, no. I'm fine. It's just
a slight allergy I have around c... c...

588
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,493
Around...

589
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,904
Wonder if you'd put him on the bed
and let me get a picture of him?

590
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,243
- There you go.
- Could you get him to stand up?

591
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,111
- I'll get a full-figure shot.
- Oh, yes.

592
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,081
Uh...

593
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:31,943
There we go.
Come on, DC, cooperate.

594
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,295
Come on, DC, you're working
for the FBI now. There.

595
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,695
There.

596
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,234
Uh, that's not any good.
We can't see him properly.

597
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,772
Wait a minute.
Here's what he likes.

598
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,330
Here.

599
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,976
Where'd he go?

600
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,249
Back under the bed.

601
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,882
I should've taken the pawprints first.

602
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,356
You're right.
He's not about to come out.

603
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,394
Can't we just get ahold of him there
and drag him out?

604
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,454
Sure, if you want to lose a hand.

605
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,598
The Bureau has spent $19,800
of the taxpayers' money

606
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,333
training me for emergencies.
They expect something for their cash.

607
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,501
I have no intention of being
intimidated by this c... c...

608
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:29,469
...animal.

609
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:32,606
- Well, you are a very brave man.
- Thank you.

610
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:36,449
All right, when I count three,
we'll both grab him at the same time.

611
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,987
- But move fast.
- Let's go.

612
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,613
- You ready?
- Let's go. Yeah.

613
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,254
One, two, three.

614
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,493
Oh, DC. You're bleeding.

615
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,971
No, it's nothing.
Probably just an artery.

616
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,509
Say, would you get him
down for me, please?

617
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,373
You're not going ahead with this?

618
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,640
I'm afraid you underestimate me.

619
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,978
We shall proceed
with the pawprinting.

620
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,151
All right.

621
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,589
Come on now, DC,
don't be difficult.

622
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,121
- What's that?
- It's ink.

623
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,026
Ink? Can't we do that
in the bathroom?

624
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,656
Ingrid will murder me
if we get ink on the rug.

625
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,324
Oh, sure. Let's go.

626
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,867
Don't make such a fuss, DC.

627
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,236
You should be ashamed of yourself.

628
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,742
Sorry about the washing.
Girl's bathroom, you know.

629
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,246
- It's okay.
- DC!

630
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,112
- Come on.
- Good old kitty cat.

631
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,119
Nice, nice kitty cat.

632
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,456
Spread this out over there.

633
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:55,188
Let's see. I guess I'll put the pawprint
in the space for the thumb.

634
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,200
Oh, hurry.
I can't hold him any longer.

635
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,429
Oh, all right.

636
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,871
Here we go, now.
Just relax there.

637
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,637
Take it easy, there, now.
It won't hurt a bit.

638
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,705
Oh, Canoe.

639
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,375
- Can I what?
- No, he's a friend of mine.

640
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,146
- I promised to go to the beach.
- That's not so good.

641
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,279
Is he one of the kids
that hangs around?

642
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,984
Yes, and he has kitchen privileges,
and he's as easy to get rid of...

643
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,050
Try to get rid of him.
It's important.

644
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,029
- What do I say?
- Anything. Just keep him away.

645
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,826
All right.

646
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,226
Hurry back,
for the love of heaven.

647
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,870
Okay, tiger,
it's either you or me.

648
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,622
- Patti?
- Yes?

649
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,090
What kind of a get-up is that
to go surfing in?

650
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,560
Want the crowd
to think you're an eccentric?

651
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:02,861
Please go on without me.
I don't think I can make it today.

652
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:07,230
Well, Patti, are you all right?
I've never seen you like this before.

653
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,137
- Can I help?
- It's all right.

654
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,904
I just feel terribly, terribly weak.

655
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,708
If you're so weak,
how come I can't get through the door?

656
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,681
Please go, Canoe.

657
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,082
I can't bear you
to see me looking like this.

658
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,256
What was that?

659
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,986
- What was what?
- That bloodcurdling scream.

660
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,585
Canoe, will you please go?

661
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,632
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was butting in on a murder.

662
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,226
Oh, don't be silly.

663
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,795
You know how DC hates water.
He's having a bath.

664
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,966
By himself?

665
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,376
All right. If you won't go to the beach,
I'll make myself a sandwich.

666
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,745
Kitchen privileges
are temporarily withdrawn.

667
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,860
He's gone.

668
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,491
Pawprints everywhere!

669
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,831
Yeah, except on the card.

670
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,894
Oh, I'm sorry.

671
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,373
Aha. The best pawprint I ever made.

672
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,981
The first point I wish to make
is that time is not on our side.

673
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,954
The word is move,
and move swiftly.

674
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:37,221
We're gonna follow an informant whose
information may or may not be reliable.

675
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,161
However, he could lead us
to the Miller kidnappers.

676
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,631
Okay, here's the physical.
Name of the informant: DC Randall.

677
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,964
Nationality: Siamese.
Sex: Male.

678
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,527
Eyes: Blue.
Weight: 17 pounds.

679
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,633
- Seventeen pounds?
- Exactly.

680
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,046
Hair, or in this case, fur:
Black streaked with tan and white.

681
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,310
- You did say "fur"?
- Correct.

682
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,479
- You want us to follow a cat?
- That's the assignment.

683
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,990
How do you follow a cat?

684
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,859
They go through fences and culverts.
They climb trees and phone poles.

685
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,763
Wither he goest, you will go.

686
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,903
- You have a question, Graham?
- I've got an old dog

687
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,568
who's a lot better
at tracking cats than I am.

688
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,440
We don't have time for comments.

689
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,141
I'd like to remind you,
a woman's life is involved here.

690
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,376
- Sorry.
- Okay.

691
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:37,482
Now, tonight you'll take up
your initial positions

692
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,990
in the area surrounding
the Randall house, here.

693
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,892
When the informant leaves,
it'll be our job to contain him loosely,

694
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,556
within a moving, fluid perimeter.

695
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,099
It's important he doesn't
become aware of us

696
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,330
as this might alter
his regular nocturnal behavior.

697
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,248
Hold it.
Who do you think you're kidding?

698
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,784
- What do you mean?
- You think I don't know

699
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,116
- what's going on upstairs?
- You do?

700
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:14,282
I didn't come in from Stupidsville
on last night's bus.

701
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,089
- You've got a woman in that apartment.
- Hold it. What does that mean?

702
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,130
Don't double-talk me.
I've got ears, haven't I?

703
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,189
Uh, it's Dan's mother.

704
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:26,793
She come in unexpected, sudden-like.
We didn't know. That's all.

705
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,100
I don't care if it's Pocahontas.

706
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:34,109
You got three people living there,
and that'll cost you another 20 dollars.

707
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,441
- I'll bring it right down.
- Don't bother.

708
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,073
I'll come up and get it.
I like to know my tenants.

709
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,549
- Can't. She's sick.
- What's wrong with her?

710
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,451
- Nothing catching, is it?
- It's her nervous system.

711
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,979
It's all fouled up.
She can't stand visitors.

712
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,557
Iggy.

713
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,062
- We gotta leave, gotta get out of here.
- What for?

714
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,537
The old battle-ax knows
we got a dame up here.

715
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,507
She heard her talking.
I told her it was your mother.

716
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,509
Why didn't you tell her
it was the TV?

717
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,411
I told you a million times, the TV.

718
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,450
- I gotta talk to you. Private.
- Why private?

719
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:18,420
- We got no secrets from Moms.
- Come on, will you? Please.

720
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,854
All right, all right.

721
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,119
Go in the kitchen
and get a glass of water.

722
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,354
And stand by the sink,
where I can see you.

723
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,829
Okay, fill me in.

724
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,162
Well, I found a place.

725
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,757
Where?

726
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:35,464
I got a big bin I spotted
in an alley two blocks away.

727
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,598
Back of a store,
where they dump trash.

728
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,904
Not so good. It's too close.

729
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,745
Anyway, I don't like bodies.
They always turn up at the wrong times.

730
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,774
We gotta unload her. The lady downstairs
is gonna start nosing around.

731
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,787
I say we got it made,
just as long as we sit tight.

732
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,313
- I say we make a move.
- We sweat it out right here.

733
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,519
Listen, Dan...

734
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,495
...anything else I play it your way,
right?

735
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,431
- Just one condition.
- Who says you make conditions?

736
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,333
- Just one.
- Such as?

737
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,064
She goes.

738
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:13,006
All right. But not until later.

739
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,408
And not in the trash bin.

740
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,937
See if you can't lose the car somewhere,
get her out of the city.

741
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,944
You sure your sister
won't mind us using her room?

742
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,510
No, not a bit. I told you,
she'd be happy to help.

743
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,022
Good.

744
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:37,559
Spires, this is Control.
Do you read me?

745
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,829
Sweet and clear. You reading me?

746
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:42,770
Affirmative. Excuse me.
What's your exact position?

747
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,775
In the alley, about 30 feet
from the Randall back gate.

748
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,438
You're the only one who can see
the informant when he hits the alley.

749
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:54,507
Let me know which way he turns.
Cahill, what's your field of vision?

750
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,849
West of Whittier,
east of the bend in Wetherby Drive.

751
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:02,119
- Stand by. About three minutes to go.
- You're young to be doing this work.

752
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,491
- I mean, it's terribly responsible.
- I'm really not that...

753
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,030
...not that young.
Kelly, are you settled in?

754
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:12,467
Affirmative. South side of Maple,
50 feet from the junction with Wetherby.

755
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,798
Got it.

756
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,340
You're very athletic looking.
Do you surf?

757
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,673
Uh, no, not anymore.

758
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,646
My legs always looked ridiculous
in those shorts.

759
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,114
Besides, I was scared to death
half the time.

760
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,378
I don't believe that.

761
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:32,251
Look at the brave, wonderful things
you FBI people do in your job.

762
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,517
Maybe we could
chat some other time, huh?

763
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:38,755
As you very properly pointed out today,
a woman's life may depend on what we do.

764
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:41,490
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to leave?

765
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,931
Maybe that would be best, yes.

766
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,934
Oh, all right.

767
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,604
I only thought if DC happened to wake up
and find a strange man in the bedroom...

768
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,509
I just don't know
how he's gonna take it.

769
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,207
Uh, you've got a point there.

770
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,875
- Graham, are you settled in?
- Opposite the west end of the alley.

771
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,422
If the informant goes west,
you've got him.

772
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:09,925
If he goes the other way, stand by.
I'll give you a new position.

773
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,326
- Who's the square red one?
- The informant.

774
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,387
- The informant?
- Yeah.

775
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,865
Oh, DC.

776
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,767
Say, are you sure he
always goes out at 9:00?

777
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,498
Oh, yes.

778
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,564
Unless, of course,
it's one of his contrary nights.

779
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,843
All agents now stand by.

780
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,978
- For goodness sake, act casual.
- What?

781
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:11,509
Don't let him suspect
anything's going on.

782
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,146
Oh, oh.

783
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,091
Nice kitty cat.

784
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,595
Good old kitty cat.

785
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,929
You can save the hypocrisy.

786
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,436
He knows you don't like him.

787
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,406
You're all tensed up.
He's getting the idea something's wrong.

788
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,947
Can't you act casual?

789
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,419
Well, certainly nice weather
we're having, isn't it?

790
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,115
And there's a bit of a wind
coming up from the east.

791
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,216
That's terrible.
Can't you do any better?

792
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,592
- Well...
- And be careful what you say.

793
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:34,064
He can't understand
what I'm saying, can he?

794
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,368
Not everything, of course.
He's just a cat.

795
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,704
But mostly everything.

796
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,280
I told you before,
let my stuff alone.

797
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,044
And come on
in the house, snoopy.

798
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,919
- I thought he's supposed to go out.
- Shh.

799
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,385
Spires, he's on his way.

800
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:34,754
I have the informant in sight.

801
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,734
He's turning west on the alley,
toward Whittier Drive.

802
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,431
Graham, he's coming your way.
Can you pick him up?

803
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,802
I've got him.

804
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,440
He's in the backyard of the
next-to-last house on Maple.

805
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,949
I'm going to investigate.

806
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,017
Spires and Cahill,
the informant is moving north.

807
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,819
Stand by for new positions.

808
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,963
He's looking up
at the side windows of the house.

809
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,898
- Who lives here?
- The Hendersons.

810
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:15,460
- They moved in last winter.
- Forget it. He's moving to the street.

811
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,837
Kelly, next-to-last house on Maple,
informant coming through.

812
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,604
I make him, Control.
He's on Maple Street,

813
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,839
bearing toward the business area.

814
00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:27,910
All right, Kelly,
leave the car and follow on foot.

815
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:31,283
Spires, move to the junction
of Whittier and College.

816
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:35,347
The informant is approaching
the junction of Whittier and State.

817
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:40,925
Okay, Graham,
move to Seventh and State.

818
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,760
Junction Seventh and State.

819
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,733
The informant has now
turned west onto State Street.

820
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,666
Cahill, move to Eighth Street,
about a half block south of Main.

821
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,767
The informant is moving down the alley
leading from State Street to Main.

822
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,693
The informant is stopped on Main Street
in front of a delicatessen.

823
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,702
That's Mr. Bartel's delicatessen.

824
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,262
DC always hangs around there and
it drives Mr. Bartel out of his mind.

825
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,777
Get out of here.

826
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,919
Informant's moving, crossing
to the south side of the street.

827
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:40,422
Stay put for a minute, Kelly.
Graham, move to Seventh and Main.

828
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,754
Cahill, had a visual
on the informant yet?

829
00:57:42,825 --> 00:57:46,124
Have him, Control.
He's approaching my position.

830
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:07,443
Informant passed my position, proceeding
toward the middle of the block.

831
00:58:14,857 --> 00:58:18,759
Informant has gone into the side yard
of an apartment building.

832
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,227
Stick with him.

833
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,126
- Does DC know anybody on Eighth?
- Who knows?

834
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:42,408
He's still in the yard. He's interested
in something on the second floor.

835
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,215
Let's start
pulling in our perimeter.

836
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:49,418
Kelly, move down Eighth to the building.
Cahill, stay with the informant.

837
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:53,019
Graham, cut through the backyards
and come behind the apartment.

838
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,587
- DC won't be hurt?
- I have to ask you to be quiet.

839
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,931
Spires, start your car and move towards
the location with your lights off.

840
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:11,137
Back away from that window.

841
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:15,378
Why don't you let her stick her head out
the window and yell for help, meathead!

842
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,440
What'd I do?

843
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:25,254
Hold everything.
Informant's on the move again.

844
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,786
He's proceeding north on Eighth Street
the way he came in.

845
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,924
Oh, no.

846
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,492
Cahill, stay with the informant.
Others return to positions.

847
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,629
I thought we had something there.

848
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,506
I love DC, but he can
drive you up the wall sometimes.

849
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:43,875
We didn't expect to find
what we were after on the first pop.

850
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:46,278
Good, DC makes a scene
all over town.

851
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,613
- He must have dozens of stops.
- Dozens?

852
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:51,654
- Informant's crossing Main.
- Stay with him.

853
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:55,851
Maybe I shouldn't have said that,
but I don't want to see you tense.

854
00:59:55,925 --> 01:00:00,259
- It can't be good for you.
- Excuse me, but I do not get tense.

855
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,890
We are trying not to be emotional.
Alert, yes. Tense, no.

856
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,560
Oh, I am relieved.

857
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,075
Ingrid, when you come
to dinner at the house,

858
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:18,636
would you mind wearing
something in yellow?

859
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,878
Gregory, I look yuck in yellow.

860
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,011
Do make an effort, dear.
It's Mother's favorite color.

861
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,449
Control, I'm getting hot.

862
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:59,310
- The informant is suspicious.
- Try and stay with him to the alley.

863
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:02,414
- Graham's coming in down there.
- Okay.

864
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,062
Control, the informant
has broken off contact.

865
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,491
I've lost him.

866
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,864
All agents,
abandon present positions.

867
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,961
Converge on the alley running
from Wetherby to Maple...

868
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,403
- Say!
- Hi.

869
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,373
- Shh!
- What do you mean, "shh"?

870
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,568
- What's going on here?
- Quiet, please.

871
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,909
- Report to me when you reach it.
- How dare you tell me to be quiet?

872
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:01,006
- What's this man doing here?
- I want you to meet Mr. Kelso,

873
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,483
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigations.

874
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,953
Please stop chattering,
or leave the room.

875
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:10,584
Listen, mister, where do you get off
telling me to leave my room?

876
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,686
I really have to ask you to be quiet,
and that goes for...

877
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,391
Hi, there.
Cahill, what happened to you?

878
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:18,933
- What's going on here?
- Ingrid, be still.

879
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:22,300
It's a matter of life and death.
I'll explain it to you later.

880
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,670
You'll get Tom Swift
and his electric scoreboard out of here,

881
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:29,142
- or I'll call the police.
- Don't call the police about the FBI.

882
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,147
- They won't come.
- Approach the alley from the east.

883
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:35,082
- Rendezvous with Cahill.
- I don't know about that.

884
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,278
That makes everything official.

885
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,186
Control, we've reached the rendezvous.
All negative.

886
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,420
Okay.

887
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,854
There he is.

888
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,025
- I've got him.
- Graham, Kelly, stay behind.

889
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,070
Cahill, Spires, circle ahead.
We can't lose him again.

890
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,735
There he goes.

891
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,475
I'm not going to have hysterics.

892
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:08,210
I am going to ask everyone nicely
to please leave my room.

893
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,981
- If you'll come out to the hallway...
- I'm not going in the hall.

894
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,114
- Graham, where are you?
- Not sure. I doubled back so much.

895
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,318
Never mind.
Keep the informant in sight.

896
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:18,758
Bingo.

897
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:22,389
There he is, moving along a tree branch
toward a light frame house.

898
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,262
Control, I see him too.

899
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,530
There's a door on the balcony.
He's trying to work it open.

900
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,833
- There are people in the room.
- How many?

901
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,067
It's hard to tell,
I just see shadows.

902
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,269
They're probably armed.
Wait for Graham and the others.

903
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,880
I'm moving around to the front,
Kelly's behind me.

904
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:42,575
- They're closing in.
- Closing in what?

905
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,677
Spires and I can go in
by the balcony.

906
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:48,417
There won't be any shooting?
DC's in the middle of everything.

907
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,550
I hope not.
We'll try to surprise them.

908
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:51,752
Oh, man.

909
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,759
- Front door is unlocked.
- Good, use the stairs.

910
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,631
Cahill, Spires,
are you in position?

911
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,696
Ready.

912
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,105
Go on in.

913
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,244
- What's the idea?
- The cat came in here.

914
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,148
Are you guys out of your mind?
There's no...

915
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,250
What's the matt... Oh!

916
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:26,085
Oh, you poor darling.
Frightened to death.

917
01:04:27,229 --> 01:04:29,754
That... cat!

918
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:40,064
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Benson.
- Good morning, Mrs. MacDougall.

919
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,339
I hope Ingrid
is feeling better this morning.

920
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:48,179
- Better? Is something wrong?
- Well, I figured she was sick.

921
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,878
She had the doctor over last night.

922
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:55,253
Or leastwise,
I assume he was the doctor.

923
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:59,920
Who else would be up there,
in her room?

924
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:03,927
Exactly.

925
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,027
Mrs. MacDougall,
exactly what time was this?

926
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,699
Look at the old buzzard.
I can imagine what she's telling him.

927
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:15,710
"Of course it's none of my business,
but there were men in Ingrid's room."

928
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,747
You won't tell him they're FBI people?
No one must know.

929
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,511
What am I supposed to say? The Kiwanis
Club is having fall maneuvers here?

930
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,554
You're a love. I know you won't
give everything away.

931
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,590
Remember, Miss Miller's life
hangs in the balance.

932
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,716
So does my car pool.

933
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:34,285
My reputation won't be worth
a plug nickel unless you get them out.

934
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,854
We've got to think
of Miss Miller and cooperate.

935
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:40,197
Of course, but the FBI has
gotten along all these years

936
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,703
without using my room
as a base of operation.

937
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,299
I want Mr. Whoever-He-ls,
and his ham radio or whatever-that-is,

938
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,902
out of my room by the time I get home,
or I'll become very difficult.

939
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,947
- Is that clear?
- Yes, quite.

940
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,111
- Have a nice day.
- Good morning, Ingrid.

941
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:00,045
- How do you feel this morning?
- Be careful, Gregory.

942
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,056
Be extremely careful what you say.

943
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,456
I haven't had my coffee,
and I'm in no mood

944
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,654
for stupid, irresponsible remarks.

945
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,304
Come in.

946
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,632
- Kelso.
- Yes, sir.

947
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,939
I was just looking at your report.

948
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:26,209
It probably sounds peculiar on paper.
If I might amplify...

949
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:30,241
Only thing missing is Chester Conklin
and the Max Sennett Bathing Girls.

950
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,617
That's very good.

951
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,815
- However, we did learn something.
- Oh?

952
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,824
There are too many men on the detail.

953
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:39,725
The informant, that is,
the cat, became suspicious.

954
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,423
I felt that we were crowding him
a little too much.

955
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,989
That's about
the same conclusion I reached.

956
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,161
- I've assigned the men to other work.
- I won't need them.

957
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,695
As a matter of fact, I'm about to
forget this whole cat angle.

958
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:54,106
You can go back to work
on Johnny the Cooch.

959
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:58,408
As you know, I never wanted to
be involved in this cat thing.

960
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,348
However, I would like to try
one more time by myself.

961
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:06,480
How, single-handed and at night,
are you gonna follow this animal?

962
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,490
- I'll use a small transmitter.
- A trans...

963
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,753
- You wanna bug the cat?
- That's right.

964
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,564
Okay, one more night.
One. No more.

965
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,260
- Thank you, sir.
- And don't try to be a hero.

966
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,361
- If you turn up anything, bring us in.
- Absolutely, sir.

967
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,868
- I sure appreciate your help.
- It's all right.

968
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,343
Our parents are away,
so I can use their room.

969
01:07:30,412 --> 01:07:33,939
Don't worry about your reputation.
When it's over, we can explain

970
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,678
- what the men were doing in your room.
- Thanks.

971
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:40,779
Then we'll restore your image
as a nice, quiet, respectful girl,

972
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,292
- who wouldn't get involved with men.
- Oh, please, dear.

973
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,091
I don't mind being respectable,
but I don't want to be a cold potato.

974
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,156
I don't think there's danger of that,
do you, Mr. Kelso?

975
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,428
- No, I hardly think so.
- Thanks.

976
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,439
The collar's ready.

977
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,999
- Shall I slip it on the informant?
- Oh, yes, please.

978
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:04,545
You'd never guess, would you?
That's the bug.

979
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,672
- Bug?
- Microphone.

980
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,980
And look, here's
a miniature transmitting set.

981
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,043
Sweet, isn't it?

982
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:17,020
Wherever DC goes, Mr. Kelso can hear
everything around him.

983
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:20,357
Conversation, music,
footsteps, anything.

984
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,421
But suppose DC simply
shakes him off his trail?

985
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,831
He did last night, didn't he?

986
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:29,132
Lmpossible. That's where
the direction finder goes to work.

987
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:32,333
- Hey, be careful with that thing.
- Absolutely.

988
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:36,970
DC has a built-in beeper in his collar,
which sends out signals.

989
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,674
And the signals are picked up on this.

990
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:44,310
Just by turning it, Mr. Kelso can tell
by that needle exactly where DC is.

991
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,184
- Oh, come on, Patti.
- I'll prove it to you.

992
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:52,426
Look, I'll borrow the spare collar
and hide you somewhere in the house,

993
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:58,158
- and we'll get Mr. Kelso to find you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

994
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,361
I've got things to do,
and I'm sure...

995
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,132
Don't you want to see
how they spend your tax money?

996
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,696
You don't want him
to think you're stuffy.

997
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,800
I couldn't care less
whether he thinks I'm stuffy or not.

998
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:11,402
Go in there, it'll be fun.
Here's the collar.

999
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,938
- Hey, this lock sticks.
- No, it works like a charm.

1000
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,507
See?

1001
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:23,920
- Okay, Ingrid's all ready.
- Good.

1002
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,661
Ready for what?

1003
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,526
Oh, Canoe.

1004
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:32,533
- I promised I'd go to the drive-in.
- It's almost 9:00.

1005
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,764
- Can you get rid of him?
- Yes, I'll do the Camille bit again.

1006
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:39,197
- Is he liable to keep hanging around?
- Possible.

1007
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:42,642
- He's sweet, but flypaper.
- Hey, keep your date with him.

1008
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,440
Get him out of the neighborhood.

1009
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,778
This is my last chance.
I can't risk gumming it up.

1010
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,340
I wanted to help.

1011
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,255
This will help me.
Now, please...

1012
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,051
And, uh, hurry.

1013
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,355
All right.

1014
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,098
- I'm ready. Let's go.
- What's your hurry?

1015
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,071
- I was gonna make a sandwich.
- Are you out of your mind?

1016
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,608
Do you want to miss
Night of the Surter,

1017
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:16,668
starring Git Gladsby,
"King of the Roaring Surf"?

1018
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:19,612
- I thought they made you seasick.
- Of course.

1019
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,377
Don't they everybody?

1020
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,652
Mr. Kelso,
if you don't mind...

1021
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:30,522
...let's get going.
- It's not 9:00 yet.

1022
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,597
Say that again.

1023
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,032
Let's get going.

1024
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,264
Now, wait a minute.

1025
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:49,141
Let's just try and pull ourselves
together here a minute.

1026
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,271
Patti, you little wretch.
Let me out of here.

1027
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:58,377
Hey.

1028
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,252
- Patti! Let me out of here!
- I'll get you out.

1029
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:10,230
- Patti's gone to the movies.
- Gone to the movies!

1030
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,164
Something seems to be stuck here.

1031
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,464
Well, open it.
There's no air.

1032
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:19,235
- I'm suffocating!
- I'll go get a screwdriver.

1033
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,570
I'm suffocating!
Let me out of here!

1034
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:27,874
I'm sorry, but the cat's going out.
I've got to follow it.

1035
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,113
Don't you dare follow that cat!
Get me out of here.

1036
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,622
There's no air!

1037
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,457
I'll be back just as soon as I can.
Probably just an hour or two.

1038
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,063
Lie down on the floor.
There's usually more air there.

1039
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,860
I'm gonna scream.

1040
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,560
Worst thing you can do.
Uses up all the air.

1041
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:51,068
I distinctly heard a woman scream.

1042
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,940
Right, and if you don't keep away
from that door, you'll hear another.

1043
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:10,657
Okay, push.

1044
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:18,259
I'd have that latch fixed,
especially if you go in there a lot.

1045
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:21,564
Excuse me, I've gotta run.
I just hope I haven't lost the cat.

1046
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:25,096
Go ahead and follow that cat.

1047
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,166
When you find him, do me a favor.

1048
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,643
The both of you,
just please stay there.

1049
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,295
What?

1050
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,675
Thank you, sir.
Turn off your lights, please.

1051
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,711
Good evening, sir.
Enjoy the show.

1052
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:40,838
Hey! You can't drive in
without a car.

1053
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,543
Come on.

1054
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:59,059
Lost something, mister?
Your car, perhaps?

1055
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,830
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a litter meter.

1056
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,838
Measures litter
in public places.

1057
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,602
- What business is it of yours?
- Health inspector.

1058
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:10,577
Boy, this place is a mess. Look at that.
Pushes the needle off the scale.

1059
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,273
I'll bet you got a lot of mice.

1060
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,646
Sir, a mouse is no more permitted here
than a man without a car.

1061
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,117
Then how do you account
for all these cats?

1062
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,878
There goes another one.

1063
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,652
Inspector, where's your badge?

1064
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,424
All I can say is,
there's something weird going on.

1065
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,523
What do you mean, "weird"?

1066
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,435
Well, like whose car is parked
outside your house all the time?

1067
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,906
Will you please stop grilling me
and watch the screen?

1068
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,375
Look at that one.
Isn't he something?

1069
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:46,471
That's another thing. How come
you're interested in surfing pictures?

1070
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,413
I thought they made you seasick.

1071
01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:51,111
If you ask me,
you're the one who's weird lately.

1072
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,051
You always used to be so sweet.

1073
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:57,990
I don't know what's happening.
I'm all churned up inside.

1074
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:01,187
Tell you what.
Why don't you go to the snack stand

1075
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,027
and get yourself a pizza
to settle your stomach.

1076
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,067
I don't feel like a pizza.

1077
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:09,069
For Pete's sake,
stop grumbling and watch the movie!

1078
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,334
Oh, all these
surfing pictures look alike.

1079
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,368
- DC!
- Hmm?

1080
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,334
Oh, DC, what are you doing here?

1081
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:53,142
- You should be out prowling.
- What are you getting hysterical about?

1082
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,683
- If he wants to stay, let him stay.
- I will not.

1083
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,618
You know what you're supposed to do.
Now get with it.

1084
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,247
Make the scene.

1085
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,813
Take off.

1086
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,488
Does my smoking bother you?

1087
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:14,830
I love the smell of tobacco,
it's the fumes from the matches.

1088
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:18,999
- Can't you keep it lit?
- All right, forget it.

1089
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:26,610
I'm sorry. I guess neither of us
are in a very good mood tonight.

1090
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,441
You can say that again.

1091
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:36,189
Why don't we just settle down
and watch this fascinating movie?

1092
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,060
It's DC.
What on earth's he doing there?

1093
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,362
What are you... Don't do that.
You'll disturb him.

1094
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,733
- What do you think he's doing?
- I'm sorry.

1095
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,796
- You're not gonna upset that cat.
- Get that cat down.

1096
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,705
Burton, you stay right here.

1097
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,540
Burton, keep your paws off of that cat.

1098
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,783
Excuse me.

1099
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,134
Well, that was a fun picture.

1100
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,865
- Take me home now, Canoe.
- Home?

1101
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,998
Haven't you seen
enough of this thing?

1102
01:18:33,074 --> 01:18:35,702
I thought you liked it.
It isn't halfway through.

1103
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,870
Oh, please, Canoe.

1104
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:41,712
You know, sometimes you're not
the easiest person to get along with.

1105
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,351
That, uh, car's still here, I see.

1106
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:21,048
Don't start that again.
Good night, and thank you for the movie.

1107
01:19:21,122 --> 01:19:25,058
- I suppose I'm not coming in, huh?
- Correct, and good night.

1108
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:28,357
I warn you,
sometime you're gonna push me too far.

1109
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,557
I demand to know
what's going on here.

1110
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,328
Oh, don't be such a drag.
Go home.

1111
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,596
Well, you don't have to go away mad.

1112
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,799
All right, let's go back
to beddy-by.

1113
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:15,741
Who, may I ask,
put that table there?

1114
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:18,040
I haven't the faintest idea.

1115
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,122
Which way did he go?

1116
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,793
Don't answer the door.
Someone's shooting someone outside.

1117
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:40,358
I know it's DC. They've shot him
and are bringing back his lifeless body.

1118
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:43,063
DC's all right. They missed him.

1119
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:46,164
- You're lying. He's hurt.
- Hold it down. I gotta call in.

1120
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,368
I had a feeling
he'd blow this case open.

1121
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:52,573
- The robbers are in this neighborhood?
- I don't want to jump to conclusions,

1122
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:57,243
but we stirred up a hornet's nest.
Kelso requesting Control. Emergency.

1123
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:06,318
Oh, DC, there you are.
Did they hurt you?

1124
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:09,124
However did you find them?

1125
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,098
I was trailing DC through a yard
down the street,

1126
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,931
and he roused up some pigeons,
and person unknown

1127
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,732
ripped off a shotgun blast at us.

1128
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:19,433
- Main Control, go ahead.
- Agent Kelso here, sir.

1129
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:22,806
- I have something worth looking into.
- That wasn't robbers.

1130
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:25,573
That was your nasty Gregory.

1131
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:28,013
Shooting at DC.

1132
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,645
- Who's Gregory?
- He lives down the street.

1133
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,814
- He keeps pigeons.
- Go ahead, Kelso.

1134
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:39,525
- Oh, boy.
- Kelso!

1135
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:45,697
The situation I was just talking about,
it just checked out.

1136
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:47,934
Negative.

1137
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,999
Step aside, please.
Where is he?

1138
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,472
Where do you think you're going?
To shoot DC?

1139
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,738
I didn't shoot your rotten little beast,
but I should have.

1140
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:59,473
- Is anything wrong?
- There most certainly is.

1141
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,380
You're not going upstairs
to murder DC in cold blood.

1142
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,315
I am not after your moronic cat.

1143
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,581
I'm after the man
that was following him.

1144
01:22:06,654 --> 01:22:09,384
Yes, a prowler behaving
in a very peculiar manner.

1145
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,891
- Why don't we all go talk about it?
- Ingrid!

1146
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:15,287
I am going to go through
every inch of this house

1147
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:19,561
- and make sure he didn't sneak in here.
- I've got to break communications.

1148
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,200
- I hardly think that's necessary.
- Nevertheless,

1149
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,331
I am going up.

1150
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:30,310
After all, there's just
you two girls here,

1151
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:33,006
and I would never forgive myself
if I woke up

1152
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,743
and found one of you had been murdered.

1153
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,546
You've got nerve,
bursting into my room.

1154
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,986
Now, Ingrid,
I want you to believe

1155
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,752
that my paramount thought
is for your safety.

1156
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:47,420
We're perfectly safe.
There's no prowler here.

1157
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,793
I am not a man
for half-measures.

1158
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:53,527
I shall not be content until I have
searched every inch of this house.

1159
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:57,298
Gregory Benson, I will not have you
tramping around my room this way.

1160
01:22:57,372 --> 01:23:00,933
And put down that ridiculous thing
before you shoot somebody.

1161
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:05,036
Let me assure you, I am familiar
with the handling of this firearm.

1162
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:06,603
I'm warning you,

1163
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:10,777
if you don't get out this instant,
this very instant...

1164
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,286
I have no intention
of leaving...

1165
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,652
Excuse me. The wiring
seems okay, Miss Randall.

1166
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:22,059
- Wiring?
- Yes, but don't hesitate to call.

1167
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,792
- No, thank you.
- Just a minute. Now you just wait!

1168
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:32,763
I hope you don't think I am goof enough
to believe that ridiculous story

1169
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,401
about you being in that closet
to fix that wiring.

1170
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,001
- If I may...
- Because...

1171
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:42,114
...if you think I think that,
you have another think coming.

1172
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:46,552
Miss Randall, I'm afraid we'll have to
take him into our confidence.

1173
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,953
You will take me into nothing.

1174
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:52,390
- I want nothing to do with you.
- I'm certain when you hear...

1175
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:57,693
I have borne witness to all the
circumstances I care for one evening.

1176
01:23:57,765 --> 01:24:00,791
How come he knows your name?

1177
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,770
Is he one of the men
Mrs. MacDougall was talking about?

1178
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:06,466
I couldn't say.
Who do you think he is?

1179
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,566
I shudder to think.

1180
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:11,669
I really do.

1181
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:16,115
I can say, it does open up
a fascinating area for conjecture.

1182
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:19,176
Oh, don't be such
a complete floop, Gregory.

1183
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,449
This is all perfectly easy to explain.

1184
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:24,014
Don't say another word,
or I'll slap your face.

1185
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:27,186
- We're explaining nothing to him.
- Well.

1186
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:31,358
I hope you realize that Mother is
going to take this all very badly.

1187
01:24:31,432 --> 01:24:34,697
- Doesn't she usually?
- Ingrid.

1188
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:37,795
There's no reason for you
to cast a slur upon my mother.

1189
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,171
At least she, after all,
is an innocent party.

1190
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,509
Yeah. Good night.

1191
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,139
Oh, and just one more thing.

1192
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,877
I suggest you find yourself
another car pool.

1193
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,906
Well, goodbye, Gregory.

1194
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:18,239
Oh, Inky, I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

1195
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:20,577
It's all for the best, I suppose.

1196
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:26,376
Um, well, goodbye and thanks very much
for your cooperation.

1197
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:29,719
- Goodbye?
- I've been assigned to a new lead.

1198
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,259
I've got orders
to wrap up the operation here.

1199
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:33,954
Why?

1200
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:38,328
Well, my boss thinks we're not getting
anywhere with our cat surveillance.

1201
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,867
I haven't come up
with a shred of evidence

1202
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,028
to connect the cat with the criminals.

1203
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:45,538
But what about Miss Miller's watch?

1204
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,701
The office just completed their report
on all the jewelers

1205
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,767
and watch repair people in this area.

1206
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,939
Nothing turned up to indicate
it belonged to Miller.

1207
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,176
But it does.
You know it does.

1208
01:25:56,251 --> 01:26:00,449
I don't know. It's a theory and
without evidence, we can't waste time.

1209
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:04,582
Oh, I think that's horrible.
What about Miss Miller? Hmm?

1210
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:07,753
You're gonna abandon her
to the mercy of those criminals?

1211
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:12,323
That's enough. Patti tends
to overdramatize things.

1212
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,360
What's worse, she has this diabolical
knack of getting everybody involved.

1213
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:20,999
No, it was a good idea, in a way.

1214
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:23,873
We had to be sure.
So long, Patti.

1215
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:26,839
Goodbye.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1216
01:26:26,914 --> 01:26:28,939
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. Goodbye, now.

1217
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:34,214
I don't know what you must think of me.
Every time we met, I lost my temper.

1218
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,723
That's all right.
We meet all kinds.

1219
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:39,787
That wasn't what I meant to say.

1220
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,796
- I, um...
- It's okay.

1221
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,259
- So long, now.
- Bye.

1222
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:59,612
That fellow has a most attractive way
of putting his foot in his mouth.

1223
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,616
- What'd you say his name was?
- Zeke Kelso.

1224
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:05,778
Hmm. Well, no matter.
Let's go to bed.

1225
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:09,814
Tomorrow, if you don't mind,
let's get the house back to normal.

1226
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:12,452
Whatever you say.

1227
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,960
More evidence.

1228
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,999
That's what they want, is it?

1229
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,497
Hey! Get out of it.

1230
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,225
- No! No, no, no, no!
- Why?

1231
01:28:21,295 --> 01:28:23,525
I wouldn't hear of it,
absolutely not.

1232
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,657
And besides,
it's none of my business.

1233
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:28,133
- That's all.
- Of course it's your business.

1234
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,136
That's ridiculous.

1235
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:33,196
We can and we must save Miss Miller.

1236
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,333
No, I'm no hero.

1237
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,640
Look at me.
Do I look like Elliot Ness?

1238
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,873
- No.
- That's the thing. I'm not a hero.

1239
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:43,246
I wanna tell you, not only will I not
get mixed up in this thing,

1240
01:28:43,317 --> 01:28:46,445
I'm extremely disinterested
in the whole thing.

1241
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:49,649
Don't get excited.
Just do me a favor. Leave...

1242
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,351
Please leave me alone.

1243
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:55,385
- I'm very busy.
- Just listen to me for a moment.

1244
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:58,489
I know you very well,
and I know you're a sweet man,

1245
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:02,366
and you would never forgive yourself
if something terrible happened,

1246
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:05,270
and it could.
I can just see the headlines.

1247
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:08,968
"Mr. Hofstedder.
He Could Have Saved Her."

1248
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:12,808
Would it say that?

1249
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,404
Of course, it would.

1250
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,279
Wait a minute, don't get excited.

1251
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:19,979
You don't have to do a thing,
just back me up if I get in trouble.

1252
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:22,852
- Who are you calling?
- It's all right, just the FBI.

1253
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:25,017
Oh, the FB... The FBI?

1254
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:31,760
Well, sir, I just hated
to give up on this cat angle.

1255
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,996
Zeke, you know as well as I do,
we haven't an iota of evidence

1256
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,663
to connect Miller with that watch.

1257
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:40,832
- Yes?
- Emergency call for Agent Kelso.

1258
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,273
Put it through.

1259
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:44,943
Agent Kelso speaking.

1260
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:47,776
This is Daphne Hofstedder speaking

1261
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:52,718
of Hofstedder's Jewelry Store,
1833 West Mapleton Avenue.

1262
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:54,945
Yes, may I help you?

1263
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:58,924
I heard you were
looking for information

1264
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:01,826
concerning a certain watch.

1265
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:05,525
- Yes, we are.
- Well, a couple of weeks ago,

1266
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,037
a woman came into the shop
to buy a band for her watch.

1267
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:15,036
Uh, what was the name?

1268
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:18,374
- A Miss Margaret Miller.
- Margaret Miller?

1269
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:21,540
Would you describe this band
that you sold to Miss Miller?

1270
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:24,449
Uh... expandable.

1271
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:28,216
Uh... it was gold-plated.

1272
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:30,655
Rather inferior, not expensive.

1273
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:34,626
- And the watch?
- Seventeen jewels,

1274
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:37,255
rather rectangular-shaped,

1275
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:42,667
with raised filigree...
things on the face.

1276
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:45,262
Rectangular with raised filigree.

1277
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:48,365
May I ask why you haven't
come forward earlier with this?

1278
01:30:48,442 --> 01:30:53,470
Well, I was away...
on my holiday...

1279
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,880
...to Mexico, on a bus.

1280
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:58,349
Will you be in town?

1281
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:03,584
Yes, I will be here anytime you want
to talk to me... on the phone.

1282
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:06,058
Thank you very much
for your cooperation.

1283
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:09,260
Goodbye.
That's it, the tie-up.

1284
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,025
- Can I move?
- Just a moment.

1285
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:13,323
- Miss Hargrave?
- Yes, sir?

1286
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:17,565
Would you get me Mr. Hofstedder
at 1833 West Mapleton, please?

1287
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,573
- He's a jeweler.
- Yes, sir.

1288
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:23,007
- I don't buy that just yet.
- Yes, sir.

1289
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,773
I want to cross-check.
Let me see that watch again.

1290
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,248
- Yes?
- Mr. Hofstedder on the line, sir.

1291
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,878
Thank you.

1292
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:37,322
How do you do?

1293
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:42,124
I'm speaking for Mr. Kelso
at 626-0025.

1294
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:44,721
Did you place a call
to this number moments ago?

1295
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,795
It's the FBI.

1296
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,832
Mr. Hofstedder?

1297
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,676
Yes?

1298
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,806
Yes. That was us.

1299
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:07,712
My niece,
from Mexico, you know.

1300
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:13,152
Oh, the wristband. She...

1301
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:17,622
She sold it.
She's from Mexico.

1302
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:20,525
No, I'm Mr. Hofstedder.

1303
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:22,896
My niece sold it.

1304
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:26,133
Thank you very much.
I appreciate the cooperation.

1305
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,198
We won't forget you. Goodbye.

1306
01:32:30,077 --> 01:32:31,977
Okay, that's it. Let's go.

1307
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:36,176
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You are a darling. Thank you.

1308
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:42,889
I wonder what they meant when
they said they wouldn't forget me.

1309
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:47,854
It's me, Iggy.

1310
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,093
- Found a spot. Found a spot.
- Cool it.

1311
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,762
Go into the kitchen.
We got business.

1312
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:00,966
Don't kill me.
I won't give you away.

1313
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:03,670
Now, take it easy.
This has nothin' to do with you.

1314
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:06,042
Now, into the kitchen, okay?

1315
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:07,944
Don't let him do it, Dan.

1316
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,415
You're not a murderer.
You're not like he is.

1317
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:13,851
Hey, wow.
Listen to the con woman.

1318
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:17,953
I... I don't want to die.

1319
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:19,890
Who said anything about killing?

1320
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,020
Come on, into the kitchen.
Come on.

1321
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:47,145
How do I know
you won't botch it?

1322
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:50,554
This ain't amateur night.
You happen to be talking to a pro.

1323
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:14,745
Nice try. Another minute,
you'd have had the fire department.

1324
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,340
What did I tell you?
You can't trust anybody.

1325
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:19,545
Sorry, Moms,
you can see how it is.

1326
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,248
We can't afford
to have you around no longer.

1327
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:23,551
Come on.

1328
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,888
Wait.

1329
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,946
What goes on
in that pea brain of yours?

1330
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:51,684
I forgot about the loot. Forgot, forgot.

1331
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:00,625
- Who is it?
- It's the landlady, Mrs. Tabin.

1332
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,218
Go away, we're busy.

1333
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:06,393
Is that smoke smell
coming out of there?

1334
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:08,196
No, it ain't, now beat it.

1335
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:12,137
You open that door!
I've got my pass key.

1336
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,071
I'm coming in.

1337
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:18,301
What's the idea?

1338
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:22,315
You can't keep me out of here.
City ordinance four, section 16.

1339
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:25,750
We weren't trying to keep you out,
just straightening up a bit.

1340
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:29,916
- Don't like you to see it crumbed up.
- That smoke smell is coming from here.

1341
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:33,892
Those rotten cigars Iggy smokes.
Kinda turn your stomach, don't they?

1342
01:35:33,961 --> 01:35:35,895
- Okay, where's the woman?
- Who?

1343
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:39,421
Your old lady. She's sick, ain't she?
I brought her soup.

1344
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,559
Now, that's very kind of you.

1345
01:35:42,469 --> 01:35:44,937
- Mmm. Smells good.
- Vegetable.

1346
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:48,207
She's in the bedroom.
Too sick to see anyone.

1347
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:51,506
- She's in rough shape, really bad.
- Shut up.

1348
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,275
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you coming.

1349
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:58,808
Never mind the snow job. There are
three people living in this apartment,

1350
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:01,218
and that'll cost you...

1351
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:03,222
Twenty bucks!

1352
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:06,091
That makes us even.

1353
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,994
Goodbye, and don't worry about Mother.
She ain't gonna be with us long.

1354
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:13,295
- You can say that again.
- That don't mean you get the 20 back.

1355
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:16,666
Of course not, Mrs. Tabin.
Good night and sleep well.

1356
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:19,799
You're going to bed as usual
right after the news?

1357
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:21,671
Just hold the noise down up here.

1358
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:24,438
My sister come for a visit
and she don't sleep good.

1359
01:36:24,511 --> 01:36:27,275
- Your sister is staying here?
- Right, from Corona.

1360
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:29,646
She's the prison matron out there.

1361
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,513
Lucky I got that 20 back, right?

1362
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:39,389
What if that hot serial number
turned up in a drug or grocery store?

1363
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,623
Forty thousand pads in this city.

1364
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:47,100
And you gotta pick one
on top of a human radar station!

1365
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,967
She's got a sister
that can't sleep nights,

1366
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:53,438
because she's a head roach
at the state birdhouse. Nice?

1367
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:55,941
Now we got two of them
flapping their ears,

1368
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,274
waiting for us
to do something stupid.

1369
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:12,117
Control, Agent Graham in.
Our unit in position.

1370
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:15,423
Graham, you will monitor
Agent Kelso's movements.

1371
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:18,727
But initiate no action until
you get the word from me. Clear?

1372
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:20,528
Affirmative.

1373
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:24,230
Be prepared for the possibility
of strong armed resistance.

1374
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:25,772
All units, now stand by.

1375
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,609
I've got a funny feeling
about DC going out tonight.

1376
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:33,136
Poor thing. Alone and helpless
in the middle of all this.

1377
01:37:33,213 --> 01:37:37,309
Pull yourself together. That cat's
as helpless as the U.S. Marine Corps.

1378
01:37:44,558 --> 01:37:46,753
- Hello?
- Hi, Patti.

1379
01:37:46,827 --> 01:37:50,593
- Hi, Canoe.
- You feel all right?

1380
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:53,758
- Fine.
- Whatcha been doing today?

1381
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:56,530
Oh, uh, nothing much.

1382
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:03,136
Funny thing, I happened to be driving
by the house a little while ago,

1383
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:07,476
and you know, that same blue car
is still parked out in front.

1384
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:09,306
Really?

1385
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:14,920
Well, um, is it
all right if I come over for a while?

1386
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:17,583
No, not tonight. I, uh...

1387
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:20,954
Oh, I've got this ghastly headache.

1388
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:24,759
You just said you felt fine
a minute ago.

1389
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:27,630
Well, I meant fine,

1390
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:30,761
Considering the condition I'm in.

1391
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:32,999
Can't you ever understand?

1392
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,832
Would you mind cutting that short?

1393
01:38:35,909 --> 01:38:39,367
Who was...
Who was that talking?

1394
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:43,543
Ingrid. Yes, it was Ingrid.

1395
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:48,281
She always has this real deep voice when
she first comes out of the shower.

1396
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:50,220
Thanks a lot, dear.

1397
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:53,885
Okay. You just get yourself
a good night's sleep,

1398
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:56,293
and I'll see you tomorrow.

1399
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:58,297
Good night, Canoe.

1400
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:04,963
Okay, dream girl,
if that's the way you want to play it.

1401
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:14,646
How about a push
to get him started?

1402
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:16,706
I'm afraid not, Mr. Newton.

1403
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:20,242
See, that's the trouble.
None of you really understand cats.

1404
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,084
Now, if someone was to go along tonight,

1405
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:25,125
someone whom he trusts...

1406
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:27,217
No, Miss Randall.

1407
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:29,762
But supposing DC loses you again?

1408
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:32,499
He's really diabolically clever.

1409
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:34,193
Look.

1410
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:49,376
- Don't you think I...
- No!

1411
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:08,632
He's on the back porch
listening to a bird.

1412
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:15,108
How I let myself
be talked into this...

1413
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:18,576
I thought Mr. Kelso said you were
going to give up the cat theory.

1414
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:22,137
We were, but a new lead
came up today to support it.

1415
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:25,208
Mr. Hofstedder rang Mr. Kelso
about the watch,

1416
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:27,583
or rather, his niece did. She...

1417
01:40:29,756 --> 01:40:31,849
How did you know about Hofstedder?

1418
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:36,891
Well, um, his store is only
a few blocks away from here,

1419
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:38,522
and we're very good friends.

1420
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:40,863
I mean, his niece and I
are good friends.

1421
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:43,027
Did Agent Kelso mention it to you?

1422
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:49,103
- He's starting to move.
- Easy, Zeke. Easy does it.

1423
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:52,509
Well, as long
as you won't be needing me...

1424
01:41:44,097 --> 01:41:46,565
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

1425
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:48,828
I'm happy to get you
out of the house,

1426
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:52,929
- but what do you think you're doing?
- There's something fishy next door,

1427
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:55,600
and I won't close my eyes to it
like you do.

1428
01:41:55,676 --> 01:41:58,736
I won't be an ostrich
and bury my head in the sand.

1429
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:01,781
Why don't you try it?
It might improve your appearance.

1430
01:42:01,848 --> 01:42:04,009
I know my duty.

1431
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:06,075
Good luck, old woman.

1432
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:09,714
I always say, if you got a duty,

1433
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,350
you ought to do it.

1434
01:42:15,162 --> 01:42:16,823
Get me the police.

1435
01:42:17,931 --> 01:42:20,695
Police?
I want to report a prowler.

1436
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:23,497
Yeah, he's dressed
like an old woman.

1437
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,903
Running around looking in windows.
No telling what he's up to.

1438
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:30,976
Yeah, and tell your men
to be careful.

1439
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:33,569
He's dangerous.

1440
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,002
That's the 402, all right.

1441
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:13,717
All right, relax, buddy.

1442
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:16,017
Just take it nice and easy.

1443
01:43:16,089 --> 01:43:18,649
Never mind the hokey scream.
We know who you are.

1444
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:21,250
- Careful, this guy might be dangerous.
- Guy?

1445
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:24,491
I don't know what you're talking about.

1446
01:43:24,564 --> 01:43:27,362
I don't want to tell you
how to run your business,

1447
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:30,267
but if I was on a job,
I wouldn't wear women's clothes.

1448
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,737
You don't have the face for it.
Now, come on.

1449
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:12,799
Control, I've lost visual contact
with the informant.

1450
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,630
- You make him on the scope?
- I have a faint signal.

1451
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:17,329
He's headed towards the pike.

1452
01:46:17,404 --> 01:46:20,202
On a line 100 feet north
of this position.

1453
01:46:20,273 --> 01:46:22,798
Okay. Report as soon
as you pick up your visual.

1454
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,036
Yes, sir.

1455
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:35,883
Oh, it's unloading time
It's unloading time

1456
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:39,392
It's unloading time
Oh, it's unloading time

1457
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:41,825
Unloading time
Unloading time

1458
01:46:44,664 --> 01:46:46,427
Iggy.

1459
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:51,097
Hey. Know what I got?
You ready for this?

1460
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:54,299
I got a laundry truck,
filled with old bags of laundry.

1461
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:57,309
- She's in the bedroom. Make it quick.
- Will I. Will I!

1462
01:46:57,377 --> 01:47:00,210
What'd you bring that thing in for?

1463
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,646
Hey, fella,
where did you come from, huh?

1464
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,148
You just wait here one minute.

1465
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:08,051
I got a little business to do,
then I'll give you milk.

1466
01:47:08,355 --> 01:47:10,880
Get rid of that cat,

1467
01:47:10,957 --> 01:47:12,424
and go in and finish her off.

1468
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:15,461
Think it's best to do
the job here or in the truck?

1469
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:18,498
Here, we don't have
to fight her down the stairs.

1470
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:27,232
This is it, Control.
132 Eighth Street.

1471
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:29,434
Okay, we got it.
All units, move in.

1472
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:31,306
Kelso, hold off till we get there.

1473
01:47:31,378 --> 01:47:34,211
I can't wait, sir.

1474
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:37,148
I've got a situation here
that's breaking wide open.

1475
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:52,193
Iggy, get this thing
off of me, will you?

1476
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:54,290
- Get it off!
- It's just my old buddy.

1477
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:56,232
Your old buddy.
Get him out of here.

1478
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:00,096
What's the matter?

1479
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:03,601
- Hey, look.
- Shh.

1480
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:11,646
You stupe, the cat's bugged.

1481
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:23,527
Hello, there. I thought you could help.
I seem to have lost a cat.

1482
01:48:23,597 --> 01:48:27,761
Oh, yes, I was wondering
who that cat belonged to.

1483
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,734
- Come right in.
- Thank you.

1484
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:33,830
You know, till you have
a pet of your own, you really...

1485
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:36,171
Ah, there it is.

1486
01:48:36,242 --> 01:48:38,802
- I hope he hasn't bothered you.
- No, not at all.

1487
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:43,144
I guess you've been
missing your old daddy, hmm?

1488
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:48,484
- He likes to play games.
- Doesn't seem to like you very much.

1489
01:48:48,555 --> 01:48:50,887
Actually, it's my wife's cat.

1490
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:54,950
Yes, to be very honest with you,
we barely tolerate each other.

1491
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:58,293
- You live in this building?
- Near the front.

1492
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:00,492
- Funny, I haven't seen you.
- Funny.

1493
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:03,127
I work nights.
Engineer at the aircraft plant.

1494
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:05,797
Interesting thing about that cat,

1495
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:07,430
had a thing on its collar.

1496
01:49:07,507 --> 01:49:12,240
I could be wrong, but it looked
like a miniature radio transmitter.

1497
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:15,076
I tell you, he is a character.

1498
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:18,311
Always saying to my wife,
"What's he gonna drag home next?"

1499
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,912
You know something, mister?
I don't think that's your cat.

1500
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:25,424
And I don't think you're an engineer
at the aircraft plant.

1501
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:30,429
And I don't think you have a little wife
who lives upstairs near the front.

1502
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:35,090
Iggy.

1503
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:41,271
Oh, there you are, lambie pie.

1504
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:45,437
And you found him!
Oh, my sweet darling.

1505
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:48,572
We've been so worried about you,
haven't we, dearest?

1506
01:49:48,648 --> 01:49:50,582
Yes, we certainly have.

1507
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:53,585
I'd rather handle it now, dear.
You run back upstairs.

1508
01:49:53,653 --> 01:49:57,248
- Not at all. I want to help.
- Aren't you young to be married?

1509
01:49:57,323 --> 01:50:00,986
Why not? We were in love.
L'amour toujours, you understand.

1510
01:50:02,896 --> 01:50:05,364
Too bad lambie pie
didn't buy you a wedding ring.

1511
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:08,094
She's always losing things.

1512
01:50:08,168 --> 01:50:11,103
- I found your cat. You run along.
- Why don't we all go?

1513
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:14,106
No need to impose
on these nice gentlemen anymore.

1514
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:16,472
- Come on.
- One minute.

1515
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:19,273
Now who's kidding who, huh?

1516
01:50:19,345 --> 01:50:22,576
Dear, would you let go
of my arm, please?

1517
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:26,745
Iggy, get the money together.
We're cutting out.

1518
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:30,256
- What about the old broad?
- Change of plans. Forget her.

1519
01:50:30,323 --> 01:50:32,257
We'll take Miss Nosy here instead.

1520
01:50:32,992 --> 01:50:36,758
- And I'll take care of you, copper.
- You'd be advised to leave her out.

1521
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:39,298
- You're telling me what to do?
- That's right.

1522
01:50:39,365 --> 01:50:43,096
- Please be careful.
- Now, sweetness, I wouldn't hurt you.

1523
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:46,570
I don't care about you,
but DC's getting frightened,

1524
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,972
and he always behaves
so badly when... Get him, DC!

1525
01:50:54,547 --> 01:50:56,242
Hold it.

1526
01:51:13,767 --> 01:51:14,927
Hey!

1527
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:19,569
What are you doing?
No, no, that's my money.

1528
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:26,010
Go away.

1529
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:33,076
Let me go. Ow!

1530
01:51:50,103 --> 01:51:52,196
My money, my money.

1531
01:51:53,506 --> 01:51:55,201
Oh, no.

1532
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:00,170
That darn cat.

1533
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:05,011
Is that too much?

1534
01:52:05,084 --> 01:52:08,679
If DC wasn't bad enough before,
there'll be no living with him now.

1535
01:52:08,755 --> 01:52:11,246
Look at this one.
He's not a bit afraid.

1536
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:15,190
He has a nice jawline,
and this picture makes it look as though

1537
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:16,888
- he had a double chin.
- Who?

1538
01:52:16,963 --> 01:52:19,625
Zeke. Can you imagine
the girl that marries him?

1539
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:21,428
Mrs. Zeke Kelso.

1540
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:24,868
It sounds like something that got caught
in a clothes dryer.

1541
01:52:25,438 --> 01:52:29,568
Wow. Would you like to see how
your gentleman friend spends his nights?

1542
01:52:30,777 --> 01:52:33,473
Canoe!

1543
01:52:33,546 --> 01:52:36,106
The poor darling.
How do you suppose he did that?

1544
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:38,241
I don't know. I'll get it.

1545
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:42,852
What in the world was he doing
caught in a garage door?

1546
01:52:42,922 --> 01:52:44,787
I haven't the faintest idea.

1547
01:52:44,858 --> 01:52:48,885
- Good morning.
- Gregory, I'm surprised to see you.

1548
01:52:49,662 --> 01:52:51,857
Good morning, Patricia.

1549
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:54,991
Ah, how is our little celebrity
this morning?

1550
01:52:55,068 --> 01:52:56,899
Ow!

1551
01:52:56,970 --> 01:53:00,371
- Bad cat.
- Quick little rascal, isn't he?

1552
01:53:02,575 --> 01:53:05,339
I may not be home for dinner.
I'll phone you later.

1553
01:53:05,411 --> 01:53:08,847
- Fine, have a nice time.
- I knew all the time, of course,

1554
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:12,373
that nothing was wrong. I felt happy
to see in the morning papers

1555
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:14,352
that my faith in you was justified.

1556
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:18,083
Mother said I should hurry over here
as though nothing had happened.

1557
01:53:18,157 --> 01:53:21,684
She forgives you
for all the anxiety you've caused her.

1558
01:53:21,761 --> 01:53:23,558
Thank you, Gregory.

1559
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:27,191
- Thanks, old man.
- I believe you two have met.

1560
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:30,998
Mr. Kelso, Mr. Benson.
Mr. Kelso is in law enforcement.

1561
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:33,664
- Mr. Benson is a duck hunter.
- Really?

1562
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,368
I hope you have a license for it.
So long, now.

1563
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,774
Goodbye, Gregory.
Regards to your mother.

1564
01:53:42,215 --> 01:53:43,739
Well!

1565
01:53:53,626 --> 01:53:56,595
- Sorry, Mr. Benson.
- Hi, Canoe.

1566
01:53:57,163 --> 01:54:00,098
I, uh, wondered
who that car belonged to.

1567
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:02,464
Ingrid's new car pool.

1568
01:54:02,535 --> 01:54:04,662
- Great, isn't he?
- Yeah.

1569
01:54:04,737 --> 01:54:08,798
Uh, Patti, I don't know
how to say this.

1570
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,969
- I'm kind of ashamed.
- Canoe.

1571
01:54:12,045 --> 01:54:15,503
Whatever happens, you must never
be afraid to look me in the eye.

1572
01:54:15,581 --> 01:54:19,813
Oh, that's not it.
I got a stiff neck last night.

1573
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:23,083
How did you
get stuck in that door?

1574
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:24,851
Well, that's just it.

1575
01:54:24,924 --> 01:54:28,087
It happened when...
Well, that guy there...

1576
01:54:29,495 --> 01:54:32,191
- Well, I was following you.
- Following me?

1577
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,429
- Why?
- Well...

1578
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:38,993
...you and that guy,
and you wouldn't let me in the house.

1579
01:54:39,072 --> 01:54:41,302
Well, what was I
supposed to think?

1580
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:43,638
Canoe, don't tell me
you were jealous.

1581
01:54:44,777 --> 01:54:47,473
And you didn't think
of your stomach, not once?

1582
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:52,577
- How do you feel now?
- Like, miserable.

1583
01:54:52,652 --> 01:54:54,950
You do?
Why, that's marvelous.

1584
01:54:56,322 --> 01:54:58,620
You're really beginning to mature.

1585
01:54:58,691 --> 01:55:00,886
Tell you what,
let's go into the kitchen,

1586
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,726
and you can make a big weird sandwich,
and you can tell me all about it.

1587
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:09,635
- Okay.
- Okay.

1588
01:55:19,379 --> 01:55:23,338
You might as well wait for me.
It'll save time.

1589
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:27,546
I'm going into the house
to murder someone.

1590
01:55:30,523 --> 01:55:34,323
Oh, Wilmer, don't try to hide.

1591
01:55:35,128 --> 01:55:39,428
Come out and take your medicine
like a man.

1592
01:55:39,499 --> 01:55:41,160
Wilmer!

1593
01:55:42,702 --> 01:55:46,433
Now, our cat's been paid
every accolade

1594
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:49,737
And he's earned all his acclaim

1595
01:55:50,576 --> 01:55:54,672
In a blaze of glory
He ends our story

1596
01:55:54,747 --> 01:55:58,342
In the feline Hall of Fame

1597
01:55:58,418 --> 01:56:00,784
But the way life goes

1598
01:56:00,853 --> 01:56:02,718
In a year, who knows

1599
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:05,417
From the family he begat

1600
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:11,058
You may wind up with one of
May be the son of

1601
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,564
That darn cat
