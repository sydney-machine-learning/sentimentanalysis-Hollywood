1
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,031
<i>Our hero grew apace.</i>

2
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,278
<i>A country lad, far happier
in the woods than in the study.</i>

3
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,597
<i>A bad hero, it may be,
with many a weakness.</i>

4
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,871
<i>But then, if Adam hadn't had
such a weakness for apples,</i>

5
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,231
<i>there would be nobody
to tell Tom's story at all.</i>

6
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,150
<i>And a part of that story tells
of the sport Tom found in the woods.</i>

7
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,790
Ah, Tom.

8
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,996
You wicked dog.

9
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,475
Molly. What are you doing here?

10
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,751
I 'eard Father tell Mother
you was coming.

11
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,995
It's a good night to be abroad
and looking for game.

12
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,076
Ah, Tom...

13
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,676
Oh, Tom...

14
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,874
<i>It shall be our custom
to leave such scenes</i>

15
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,436
<i>where taste, decorum
and the censor dictate.</i>

16
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,753
<i>In this way, we shall try to make up
for our incorrigible hero.</i>

17
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,278
<i>As soon as he had left
the disreputable Molly,</i>

18
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,077
<i>what did he do but join her equally
disreputable father, Black George,</i>

19
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,078
<i>gamekeeper to Squire Allworthy.</i>

20
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,030
- Come on!
- I hear 'em. Psst.

21
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,957
Come on, lads. We'll smoke 'em out.

22
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,958
Fetch it. Fetch it, boy. Come on.

23
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,231
Wait. That's fallen
on Squire Western's ground.

24
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,713
Well, let's after it.

25
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,308
No - I've been warned for trespassing.

26
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,556
It's our bird. Don't worry, Blackie.

27
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,434
- Come back! Come...
- Here, boy. Here, boy. Here, boy.

28
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,399
All right, you devils, I'll get you!

29
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,391
- I'll have your blood! I'll...
- Run, Blackie!

30
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,673
Let's give the old man
a run for his money.

31
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,070
Home, lads. I'll get 'em another night.

32
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,599
- I thought I'd lost you in the woods.
- Short cut.

33
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,188
- We'll be caught one of these days.
- Don't worry.

34
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,551
It's all right for you -
you haven't got a family to keep.

35
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,194
<i>I'll look after you.</i>

36
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,278
Here... Take this guinea.

37
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,156
Good night, Blackie.

38
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
<i>Our hero, alas, was always being
exploited by villains like Black George.</i>

39
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,313
<i>For a generous man is merely
a fool in the eyes of a thief.</i>

40
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,233
<i>- A sheep?
- Aye, sir, an entire sheep.</i>

41
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,750
A fat animal. Enough
to feed a village for a week.

42
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,156
Hanging up in his cottage
as proud as a battle trophy.

43
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
- This is a grave matter.
- A hanging matter.

44
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,078
- Sir, if I may speak on his behalf, I'd...
- Be silent.

45
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,912
Are you guilty?

46
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,951
I am... guilty...

47
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,755
- Sir, forgive him.
- Be quiet, sir. I have to do justice here.

48
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,515
You have committed a capital crime.

49
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,270
The laws have provided the most terrible
To hang by your neck.

50
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,837
But you have children.

51
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,873
For their sake, I shall only
dismiss you from my service.

52
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,754
And may God have mercy on you.

53
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,952
You're too lenient, Mr Allworthy.

54
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,709
Compassion is one thing, sir,
but justice is another.

55
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,555
<i>Mr Thwackum and Mr Square
were Tom's tutors.</i>

56
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,593
<i>Over the years, they tried -
with little success -</i>

57
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,917
<i>to thrash into Tom
a sense of virtue and religion.</i>

58
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,873
<i>They had, however, a more apt pupil.</i>

59
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,432
<i>Soon after Tom had been found,</i>

60
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,792
<i>the squire's sister Bridget married
a Captain Blifil, and they had a son.</i>

61
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,150
<i>This young man was
quite different from Tom.</i>

62
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,477
<i>He was sober, discreet
and pious beyond his age,</i>

63
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,115
<i>and the whole neighbourhood
resounded in his praise.</i>

64
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,992
You have only taught Tom to laugh at
whatever is decent and virtuous and right.

65
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,033
- I've taught him religion.
- Mr Thwackum, the word "religion"

66
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,232
is as vague and uncertain
as any in the English language.

67
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,399
By "religion" I mean the Christian religion.
Not only that, but the Protestant religion.

68
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,750
And not only that,
but the Church of England.

69
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,758
I fear that Tom is the embodiment
of the old truth

70
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,599
that foundlings
should be left to the parish.

71
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,474
My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you
can touch his bastard's heart.

72
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,718
<i>Neither indeed.
But there was another who could.</i>

73
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,988
<i>Tom...</i>

74
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,554
- I want you to help me.
- How?

75
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,720
I want you to get me a post, Tom.

76
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,116
Mm-hm...

77
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,756
Miss Western's come back from France
and'll be wantin' a maid.

78
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,348
I'll speak to her.

79
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,635
Tom, you are kind to me.

80
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,116
Miss Western's maid!

81
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,957
Sophie Western! Miss Western!

82
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,959
Why, Tom Jones!

83
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,355
I've brought you a thrush.

84
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,112
He's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.

85
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,032
Two years is a long time. Did they teach
you London ways, make a lady of you?

86
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,720
Most of the time I was in France.
My aunt took me there.

87
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,276
<i>- Did you like France, Meez Western?
- Mais oui. Je me suis très bien amusée.</i>

88
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,868
<i>- Ah, bon.
- You haven't changed, Tom.</i>

89
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,390
You've grown, Sophie.
Grown more beautiful than ever.

90
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,512
Doesn't he sing beautifully?
I shall teach him some new songs.

91
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,359
I doubt if an English bird
can learn French songs.

92
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,674
You'll see.

93
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,472
<i>Avignon</i>

94
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,990
<i>Sur le pont d'Avignon...</i>

95
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,079
We're asked to supper. I came early to ask
if you'd help Black George's daughter.

96
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,555
Oh, yes. He stole a sheep, didn't he?

97
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,511
Black George is a poor man.

98
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,519
With big, hungry daughters to feed.
Most hungry - I can vouch for it.

99
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,108
I have a maid already.
But I'll see what I can do.

100
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,150
Good, good.

101
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,476
Ah! Welcome, neighbours! Welcome!

102
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,878
- How nice to see you.
- Welcome, madam. Welcome, Squire.

103
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,036
Good day, Western, good day.

104
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,993
- Look! Tom brought me a thrush!
- What a sweet little bird!

105
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,395
His song is sweeter
than any tune of Mr Handel's.

106
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,590
Ugh, Handel!

107
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,476
Tom, thank you.

108
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,670
Welcome home, Sophie.
How lovely you're looking, child.

109
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,873
Aye, it's good to have her home.
Let's all go in to dinner.

110
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,792
- Oh dear.
- Oh, my little bird!

111
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,469
Don't worry, Sophie,
I'll get it back for you.

112
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,194
- Tom...
- Good lad, Tom.

113
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,989
Be careful, Tom! Tom, take care!

114
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,076
- I'll wager he gets it.
- Take care.

115
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,158
I am sorry to cause you this distress,
Miss Western.

116
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,555
I did not think the bird would fly away.

117
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,877
But I cannot help observing
that the idea of caged birds

118
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,151
is against the laws of nature.
Don't you agree, Mr Square?

119
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,477
He's got him!

120
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,314
Argh!

121
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,676
He'll drown! Quick, pick him up!
Help him, someone!

122
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,598
- Oh, Tom, you're soaked!
- Come on, lad, give me your hand.

123
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,190
Damn me if I won't love the boy for this
as long as I have to live!

124
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,958
Serves him right.

125
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,036
And you, sir.

126
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,428
<i>The weeks passed...
and Molly grew apace too.</i>

127
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,231
Ah, you lazy slut, you!
Look at her, with that great belly on her!

128
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,594
That I should have lived to see this day!

129
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,838
You'd better have minded what the parson
said and not harkened after menfolks.

130
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,155
She's the first of this family to be a whore!

131
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,239
Mother, you yourself was brought to bed
with sister there a week after you married.

132
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,954
Ah, but I were made an honest woman of.

133
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,949
But you, you have to be doing with
gentlemen, don't you, you nasty slut, you!

134
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,755
You will have a bastard!
And I defy anybody to say that of me.

135
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,159
- My gentlemen'll look after me.
- Your gentlemen! Far from gentlemen!

136
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,999
You lay off me, or I'll tell my gentlemen...

137
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>...if these be constantly applied,</i>

138
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,551
And then, though we cannot
absolutely promise success,

139
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,468
yet we may properly say with the apostle

140
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,118
"What knowest thou, O wife,
whether thou shalt save thy husband?"

141
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,390
And now, my dear brethren,
let us sing together the hymn

142
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,512
"O God, Our Help in Ages Past. "

143
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,917
O God, our help in ages past

144
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,514
Our hope for years to come...

145
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,675
<i>"Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For God hath made them so. "</i>

146
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,509
<i>"Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too. "</i>

147
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,394
<i>"But, ladies, you should never let
Such angry passions rise. "</i>

148
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,638
<i>"Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes. "</i>

149
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,551
There she is! Let's get at her!

150
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,232
Let's thrash her!

151
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,150
Don't want the likes of her in this village!
Won't have her mixing with us good folk!

152
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,350
Take that, you hussy!

153
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,958
I'll get you, Goody Brown,
you dirty old harridan!

154
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
Oh, Tom... Please, Tom...

155
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,989
Don't... Don't leave me, Tom.

156
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,594
Slowly. Slowly.

157
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,756
That filthy slut.

158
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,515
Ah, good boy, good boy!

159
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,509
He's a game lad, your Tom.

160
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,794
So, the wench is having a bastard?

161
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,677
Yes. It seems the girl has refused
to name the father to Mr Allworthy.

162
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,599
He may have to send her to Bridewell.

163
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,118
- Father, I have a headache.
- I smoke it.

164
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,269
I smoke it!
Tom is the father of that bastard!

165
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,234
Aye! As sure as tuppence,
Tom is the bastard's father!

166
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,110
Father...

167
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,279
Odds zodikins!
What a little whoremaster that boy is!

168
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,595
The girl is ruined, surely.

169
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,396
Aye! Ruined. Ruined for sure!
Once broken, never mended, eh?

170
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,110
Lt'll do no harm. Ask Sophie.
She knows about Tom.

171
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,517
You have no worse opinion of a young
fellow for getting a bastard, have you?

172
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,393
Will you stop bobbing up and down, girl!

173
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,231
No, no. The women will like him
the better for it, won't they?

174
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,236
- Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs.
- Not tonight, Father. I have a headache.

175
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,273
Let's have "St George, He Was
for England" or "Bobbing Joan".

176
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,630
That's a good song for tonight, eh?

177
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,038
None of your old Handel now,
my little darling.

178
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,276
Ah, you play like an angel.

179
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,473
<i>Molly's reputation was destroyed,
and Tom's heart was heavy with remorse.</i>

180
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,670
<i>Perhaps Mr Square had been right,</i>

181
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>that the wicked are snared
in the work of their own hands.</i>

182
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,070
Oh. Mr Jones.

183
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,272
- Where's Molly?
- Oh, she... she ain't home.

184
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,753
She's upstairs. In bed.

185
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,113
- Who is it?
- It's me. Tom.

186
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,669
Why haven't you been
to see me before this, Tom?

187
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,995
- Molly, I...
- Agh!

188
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,669
- You said you'd be my gentleman!
- I hope to explain why...

189
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,712
You'll not admit you've had
your wicked will of me?!

190
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,068
- Molly...
- No.

191
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,033
I shall never love
another man but you, Tom.

192
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,353
Not if the greatest squire in the country
came a-courtin',

193
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,391
I couldn't give myself to him!

194
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,629
No, Tom, not for all the riches in the
world, now that you've gained my heart.

195
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,312
You are a lecherous rascal after all, Tom!

196
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,116
I shall always hate and despise
the whole sex on account of you, Tom!

197
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,196
<i>Mr Square.</i>

198
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,196
<i>Molly's favours, after all,
had not been bestowed on Tom alone.</i>

199
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,519
<i>Our hero, unlike many other men,</i>

200
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,758
<i>was fortunate enough to discover
the father of his child in time.</i>

201
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,914
And after everyone's kindness, too.

202
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,918
She has laid the child
at young Mr Jones's door.

203
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,352
All the parish say Mr Allworthy is so angry
with Mr Jones that he won't see him.

204
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,313
To be sure, one can't help
pitying the poor young man.

205
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,399
He's so pretty a gentleman. I should
be sorry to see him turned out-of-doors.

206
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,115
Why do you tell me all this? What concern
have I in what Mr Jones does?

207
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,392
Why, ma'am, I never thought it was any
harm to say a young man was handsome.

208
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,638
But I shall never think of him any more
now. For handsome is as handsome does.

209
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,957
Tittle-tattle, tittle-tattle.
I shall be late for the hunt.

210
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,275
Sorry, I'm sure, madam.

211
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,431
Everyone in my household!
Where's the cider?

212
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,316
Greetings! Greetings!

213
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,393
- Greetings, Thwackum.
- Morning, Squire. Morning, Miss Western.

214
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,676
Welcome, everyone.

215
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,756
Morning, Western.

216
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,236
Oh, you brute!

217
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,111
- Morning.
- And you, sir.

218
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,549
Ah, you're getting no younger.
I mean the horse, madam.

219
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,511
A stirrup cup, everyone!

220
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,879
Come, help yourselves, everyone!
Plenty to eat and drink!

221
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,276
Here. The Church is always first
with the bread and wine.

222
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,356
Health to everyone!

223
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,074
French miss isn't speaking today?

224
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,156
Drink up, everyone.

225
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,276
- Huntsmen, loose the hounds.
- Another tankard, please.

226
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,835
Come on, boys and girls!
Come on, come on!

227
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,752
Have a drop of cider inside you, boy.
Then you'll be ready for the kill.

228
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,553
Come on, drink up. Drink up, everyone.

229
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,912
Come on, drink up!
Some Western brew for you, my girl!

230
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,152
Squire, it's too early! You'll tire yourself!

231
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,389
Quiet, everyone.
Good health and good hunting!

232
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,193
Come on, Sophie! Hurry, hurry!

233
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,638
<i>Come on, sweetheart! After him!</i>

234
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,673
Tally-ho!

235
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,754
Ahhh! Here he is!

236
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,872
- I trust you're not harmed.
- No, no. How can I ever thank you?

237
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,390
If I have preserved you, madam,
I am sufficiently repaid. Agh...

238
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,351
I hope you're not hurt.

239
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,758
If I have broken my arm, it is a trifle
compared to my fears on your account.

240
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,871
Broken your arm?!

241
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,039
I'm afraid I have, madam.
Yet I have another to lead you home.

242
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,829
Look at him, ma'am. He's the most
handsome man I ever saw in my life.

243
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,428
Why, Honor, I do believe
you're in love with him.

244
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,118
I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.

245
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,596
If you were, I see no reason
that you should be ashamed of it.

246
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,597
For he is certainly a handsome fellow.

247
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,917
That he is - the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.

248
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,669
And, as you say, ma'am, I don't know why
I should be ashamed of looking at him,

249
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,358
even though he is my better.

250
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,597
For gentlefolk are but flesh and blood,
like us servants.

251
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,474
I am an honest person's child,
and my mother and father were married -

252
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,875
<i>which is more than some people can say.</i>

253
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,876
Honor!

254
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,912
My grandfather was a clergyman,
and he'd have been very angry

255
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,318
to have thought any of his family had
taken up with Molly Seagrim's leavings.

256
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,673
Why, ma'am,
the young gentleman is awake.

257
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,159
Yes. You've awakened him
with your foolish chatter.

258
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,238
I feel awake for the first time, madam.

259
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,073
"... after narrow scru...
narrow scrutiny,

260
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,876
found some magical books... " Ha-haar!

261
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,557
"... several vials of strange liquors,
pots of ointment... "

262
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,872
Remember that picnic, Sister, last year,
when Western sat on a wasps' nest?

263
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,956
I shall never forget it!

264
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,794
Oh, it's so beautiful this summer.

265
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,038
Brother... Brother...

266
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,469
- Brother!
- Whoa! Whoa!

267
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,559
- I can't...
- It's all right. It's all right.

268
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,991
Why the long face, Blif?

269
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,475
- Such a terrible thing.
- What's happened?

270
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,592
There's been an accident.
My mother is dead.

271
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,032
Blif...

272
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,036
And Squire Allworthy?

273
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,070
He's not expected to live.

274
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,710
Shh.

275
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,753
Fever has developed and there
is little hope. We can only pray.

276
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,755
Something for which
you have scant relish!

277
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,792
"Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

278
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,152
to take unto himself the soul
of our dear sister here departed,

279
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,794
we therefore commit
her body to the ground,

280
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,478
earth to earth,

281
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,272
ashes to ashes,

282
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,516
dust to dust,

283
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,952
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

284
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,119
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. "

285
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,870
Well, there's another one gone.

286
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,916
So sorry.

287
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,516
Cheer up, lad.

288
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,551
She will be with the angels, my boy.

289
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,036
Our mortal forms are but shadows
of a purer reality.

290
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,278
- Thank you for your comforting words.
- She was a great lady.

291
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,708
Sir, some time before your mother died
she gave me a letter.

292
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,992
Her instructions were to hand it
to Mr Allworthy as she was buried.

293
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,712
I will give it to my uncle.

294
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,991
She expressly said
into no hands but Mr Allworthy's.

295
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,352
Lawyer Dowling, if my uncle lives
he will need a new steward.

296
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,675
I intend to recommend you.

297
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,109
You are most kind, sir.

298
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,995
Do not grieve, my dear nephew.
Do not grieve.

299
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,556
Sir, you cannot die.

300
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,079
Death comes to us all, Tom.

301
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,554
I have asked you here
to tell you of my will.

302
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,118
Nephew Blifil, I leave you heir to my
whole estate, with these exceptions.

303
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:29,271
<i>To you, my dear Tom,
I have given an estate of Pounds. 800 a year,</i>

304
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,517
<i>together with Pounds. 1,000 in ready money.</i>

305
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,152
I am convinced, my boy,

306
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,197
that you have much goodness,
generosity and honour in your nature.

307
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,589
If you will add prudence and religion
to these, you must be happy.

308
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,075
<i>Pounds. 1,000 I leave to you, Mr Thwackum,
and a like sum to you, Mr Square -</i>

309
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,399
which I am convinced exceeds
your desires as well as your wants.

310
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,438
<i>As for my servants,
for Marjorie and Jane, Pounds. 100 each.</i>

311
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,552
"... my soul shall praise the Lord
even to death,

312
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,148
and my life was drawing
near to hell beneath... "

313
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,912
Mr Allworthy's recovered!

314
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,190
It's over! The fever's gone!

315
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,233
He's sitting up! He's well again!
The squire's recovered!

316
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,396
It's over!

317
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,795
<i>It is not true that drink
changes a man's character.</i>

318
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,069
<i>It can reveal it more clearly.</i>

319
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,430
<i>The Squire's recovery brought joy to Tom,
to his tutors sheer disappointment.</i>

320
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,554
Sing, thick Thwackum,
your bounty's flown...

321
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,355
You have good reason for your
drunkenness, you beggarly bastard!

322
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,395
- He's provided well enough for you!
- Do you think that could weigh with me?

323
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,318
- Damn you, Thwackum!
- How dare you, sir?!

324
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,557
And damn me
if I don't open another bottle.

325
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,315
I shall sing you a ballad, entitled "Sing,
thick Thwackum, thy bounty has flown".

326
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,671
Sing, thick Thwackum,
thy bounty's flown

327
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,190
You've lost all the money
you thought that you'd own...

328
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,276
Mr Jones!

329
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,318
This house is in mourning on account
of the death of my dear mother.

330
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,072
Oh, sir, forgive me.
The joy of Mr Allworthy's recovery...

331
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,749
I had the misfortune
to know who my parents were.

332
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,440
Consequently, I'm grieved by their loss.

333
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,274
You rascal. Do you dare to insult me?

334
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,475
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
This behaviour is most unseemly.

335
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,118
<i>Oh, Master Blifil!</i>

336
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,755
Oh, that vulgar animal! Out with him!

337
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,989
All right, we'll go outside!
Let's have some wine!

338
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,350
Get him out! Get him out!

339
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,630
How dare you throw me out?

340
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,876
Shall we take the evening air?

341
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,318
<i>It is widely held that too much wine
will dull a man's desire.</i>

342
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,674
<i>Indeed it will - in a dull man.</i>

343
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,515
Sophia...

344
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,876
Sophie...

345
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,799
I'll carve her name on this tree!

346
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,674
Tree, do you mind
if I carve the name of my Sophia?

347
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,590
Big S for Sophia... Sophie...

348
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,350
Sophie, Sophia...

349
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,716
So... Molly...

350
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,234
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly...
M for Molly...

351
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,039
Are you aimin' to slit my throat, Squire?

352
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,509
Would you like... a sip of my wine?

353
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,789
Mm.

354
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,390
I never had a sip
of a gentleman's wine before.

355
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,190
Oh, it's very potent!

356
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,709
What are you laughin' at, Tom?

357
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,714
I'm thinking of Square in your bedroom!

358
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,399
<i>To those who find our hero's behaviour
startling, the answer is simple.:</i>

359
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,751
<i>Tom had always thought
that any woman was better than none,</i>

360
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,668
<i>while Molly never felt that one man
was quite as good as two.</i>

361
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,599
- He has a wench!
- A wench?

362
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,359
- Let's go and find the wicked girl.
- Yes!

363
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,191
Who's that?

364
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,592
- How dare you?!
- Thwacky! Ha-ha!

365
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,676
Mr Jones, control yourself!

366
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,956
How disgraceful!

367
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,757
Go away, sir! Go away, sir!

368
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,151
Take that, you wicked fool!

369
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,355
You there! Damnation to you!

370
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,040
Stop it! Stop! What's the matter with you?

371
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,075
Damnation to you! Get over there!

372
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,919
Whoa, there! Three falling onto one?

373
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,996
Whoa! The whip!

374
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,593
Come, lass, see to Tom.
He's in a devilish pickle, I promise you.

375
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,239
Tom... Shh. Poor Tom. Shh.

376
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,230
- Sophie, dear...
- Shh. I'll fetch some water.

377
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,194
- What are you brawling about, Tom?
- If you search the bushes you'll find out.

378
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,636
You lickerish dog, you!

379
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,873
Where is she? Where's Tom's pussy?
Puss, puss, puss, puss...

380
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,150
Where's Tom's pussy? Puss, puss, puss...

381
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,236
Sophie, I...

382
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,831
Come. After him.

383
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,509
- Sophie!
- Tom. Tom! Come and sup with me.

384
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,518
Gentlemen, let us make our peace
over a bottle.

385
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,997
Sir, it is no slight matter for a man
of my character to be buffeted by a boy

386
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,554
just for trying to bring
a wanton harlot to justice!

387
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,194
The fault lies with Mr Allworthy
and yourself, sir.

388
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,629
If you would put
the right laws into execution,

389
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,354
you would soon rid the country
of these... vermin.

390
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,119
Ha! I'd sooner rid the country of foxes!

391
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,389
Come, you sup with me. Damn me
if there's nothing I wouldn't give you -

392
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,637
except my hounds
and my favourite mare, Miss Slouch.

393
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,473
Up...

394
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,556
Away, Miss Slouch!

395
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,548
Let us tell Mr Allworthy
how the monster has behaved!

396
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,433
No, sirs, I beg of you, let us wait.

397
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,710
A better time will come.

398
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,715
Odds zodikins, it's me sister's coach.
What brings her from London?

399
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,354
I hope the old bitch has gone to bed.

400
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,437
Come, Sophie, sing us
one of your jolly songs, my girl.

401
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,074
Father, I do not feel well.
I think I shall go to bed.

402
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,557
Not before you attend to your guest.
Tom here has a great thirst, I warrant you.

403
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,070
Western? What are these nocturnal riots?

404
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,029
- Now lookie here, Sister...
- Sophie?

405
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,513
- Yes, Aunt?
- To bed.

406
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,358
- Bed?
- Bed!

407
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,436
I'd be glad to, madam.

408
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,553
Now lookie here, Sister!

409
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,437
Brother, as I am here to stay a while,
I shall sign a peace treaty with you.

410
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,119
Sister, I've often warned you
not to talk that court gibberish to me.

411
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,915
I pity your country ignorance
from my heart.

412
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,032
And I despise your citified claptrap!

413
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,755
<i>I'd rather be anything than a courtier,
or a... or a Presbyterian,</i>

414
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,270
or a crawler around
one of those damned German kings,

415
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,436
as I believe some people are.

416
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,676
If you mean me, I'm a woman of...

417
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,836
Yes, and a good thing for you that you are.

418
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,077
If you were a man, I'd have
lent you a flick long ago!

419
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,718
Brother, I think you are a perfect goat.
Good night, sir.

420
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,436
Good night, Sister.

421
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,798
Brother!

422
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,232
Brother!

423
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,914
Brother!

424
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,837
Oh, stop!

425
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,957
Brother!

426
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,832
Brother, have you not noticed something
very extraordinary about Sophie lately?

427
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,475
Tell me, then. You know I love that girl
more than my own soul.

428
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,469
Well, unless I am deceived,
my niece is desperately in love.

429
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,111
In love?

430
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,708
In love?! Without my consent?!

431
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,956
I'll disinherit her!

432
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,030
I'll cast her out-of-doors
stark naked without a farthing!

433
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,309
Where is she?

434
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,592
Supposing she should have fixed on
the very person you would have wished?

435
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,838
No. No! She can love whom she pleases,
but she'll marry the man I choose!

436
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,270
<i>But she has fixed on the very person
you would have wished!</i>

437
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,110
- What?
- What think you of Mr Blifil?

438
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,837
- Young Blifil?
- Well, who else could there be?

439
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,397
In this rude country and society.
Who else is of her class?

440
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,555
'Fore George...

441
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,390
Nothing could lie handier together
than Allworthy's estates and mine.

442
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,198
Come, Sister.
What do you advise me to do?

443
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:54,111
I think you should propose the match
to Mr Allworthy... immediately.

444
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,476
I will propose it.

445
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,191
Saddle my horse!

446
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,230
Well, Nephew, how do you feel about this
marriage between you and Miss Western?

447
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,989
- I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.
- Oh, come, sir.

448
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,353
That is a cold answer when confronted by
the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.

449
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,391
My dear Uncle,

450
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,071
I am well aware of the many pleasures
of that noble institution, marriage,

451
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,239
and I will gladly call upon the young lady
at any time she will receive me.

452
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,432
Good. You shall call upon her
this very afternoon.

453
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,517
Sophie, dear,
what book is that you're reading?

454
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,914
A sad one.

455
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,430
- You blush, my dear Sophie.
- I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.

456
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,317
Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.
You know the easiness of my nature.

457
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,317
I have not always been like this.

458
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,352
I used to be thought cruel -
by the men, I mean.

459
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,710
I was called "the cruel Parthenissa".

460
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,274
Now come.
I have news that will delight you.

461
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,833
What news, Aunt?

462
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,795
This very afternoon your father has
arranged for you to receive your lover.

463
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,596
My lover?

464
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,188
He's coming?! This afternoon?!

465
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,676
Yes. And you're to put on
all your best airs.

466
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,116
Why, Aunt!

467
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,110
You almost frighten me out of my senses!

468
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,835
You will come to yourself again.
He's a charming young fellow.

469
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,033
Dear, dear Aunt... I know
none of such perfections.

470
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,596
So brave, and yet so gentle.
So handsome.

471
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,029
What matters his being baseborn?

472
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,879
Baseborn? What do you mean?

473
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,037
- Mr Blifil, baseborn?
- Mr Blifil?

474
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,152
Mr Blifil. Of whom else
have we been talking?

475
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,953
- Why, Mr Jones!
- Mr Jones?!

476
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,392
Mr Blifil?! You can't be in earnest!

477
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,556
Oh, then I am
the most unhappy woman alive.

478
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,756
How can you think of disgracing your
family by allying yourself to a... bastard?

479
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,395
Madam, you have extorted this from me.

480
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,478
Whatever were my thoughts
of that poor, unhappy Mr Jones,

481
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,194
I had intended to carry them to the grave.

482
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,916
I would rather follow you to that grave

483
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,793
than see you disgrace us
by such a match!

484
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,590
Yes! Yes!

485
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,517
No, no, no, no, no!

486
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,394
I will not marry that idiot!
To force me to do so would be to kill me!

487
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,909
Then die and be damned!

488
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,639
Damn me! What a misery it is
to have daughters,

489
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,990
when a man has a good mare and dogs.

490
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,874
Tom, that pig-headed hussy
dares to refuse to marry Mr Blifil.

491
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,639
I'll turn her penniless out-of-doors
if she doesn't!

492
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,320
Go to her, lad, and see what you can do.

493
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,676
Sophie! Sophie!

494
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,036
<i>- Sophie!
- Sophie!</i>

495
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,875
No! No! No, no! No!

496
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,152
- Sophie!
- Brother! Brother!

497
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,757
Sophie!

498
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,632
Sophie... Sophie...

499
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,230
Sophie, Sophie... Shh.

500
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,874
My dearest, promise
you won't give yourself to Blifil.

501
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,117
- Don't say that name to me!
- Tell me, tell me I may hope!

502
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,468
Tom, you must go.

503
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,750
- Sophie, please...
- Or you'll be destroyed.

504
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,715
The only destruction I fear is the loss
of my Sophie. I cannot part with you.

505
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,072
Can't I make you understand,
you country clot?

506
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,916
Tom Jones?

507
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,956
Damnation!

508
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,071
Where is he? That parasite!
That home-wrecker! Where is he?

509
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,351
<i>There they are!</i>

510
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,518
Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick.

511
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,236
Run, Tom, run!

512
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,316
Come back here!

513
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,232
- I'll get thee if I hang for it!
- Tom, run!

514
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,510
<i>- Sophie, please!
- Run, Tom!</i>

515
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,390
You there! Allworthy!

516
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,436
- A fine piece of work you've done!
- What can be the matter, Mr Western?

517
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,120
My daughter has fallen in love
with your bastard!

518
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,118
That's what comes of trying
to raise a bastard as a gentleman,

519
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,800
and letting him go visiting
to nice folks' houses.

520
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,879
- I'm sorry to hear you say this.
- A pox on your sorrow!

521
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,511
I've lost my only daughter.
My poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.

522
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,995
Little did I think,
when I loved him as a sportsman,

523
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,429
that he was all the while
a- poaching my daughter!

524
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,791
I wish you had not given him
so many opportunities with her.

525
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,434
What the devil did she
have to do with him?

526
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,438
<i>He came a-huntin' with me,
not a-courtin' to her!</i>

527
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,391
What are we to do, Mr Western?

528
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,115
Keep the rascal away from my house
until I lock the wench up.

529
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,148
I'll make her marry Mr Blifil here
if it's the last thing I do.

530
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,360
I'll have no other son-in-law but you.

531
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,438
So go to her, you jolly dog, you.

532
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,955
I tell you, you shall have her.

533
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,518
And as for that son-of-a-whore Jones,
if I catch him anywhere near my gal,

534
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,076
I'll qualify him to run
for the Gelding's Plate!

535
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,788
Come on, Miss Slouch, come on.

536
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,878
<i>Even the best of horsemen
should avoid the bottle.</i>

537
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,949
<i>However, the forces of sobriety
were gathering in all their strength</i>

538
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,638
<i>against our hero.</i>

539
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,355
We draw your attention
to the abominable behaviour of Mr Jones.

540
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,838
He is a monster of depravity and should
be expelled from your house this instant.

541
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,399
You let her out of her room
after I locked her in?

542
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,559
Women are convinced
by reason, not by force.

543
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,960
I am in the wrong!

544
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,799
As soon as she came back
to live with you, Brother,

545
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,593
she imbibed these romantic notions.

546
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,038
<i>You don't imagine, do you,
that I taught her such things?</i>

547
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,918
Your ignorance, Brother, as the great
Milton says, almost subdues my patience.

548
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,872
Damn Milton!

549
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,118
If he had the impudence to be here
and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.

550
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,878
Come on, my girl.

551
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,234
He was, according to the vulgar phrase,
whistle drunk.

552
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:57,753
On the very day of your utmost danger, he
filled the house with riot and debauchery.

553
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,559
And he even struck Master Blifil.

554
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,195
How?! Did he dare strike you?

555
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,153
Oh, Uncle, I'm sure
I've forgiven him for that long ago.

556
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,434
But the same evening
we unluckily saw him... with a girl...

557
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,114
in a manner not fit to be mentioned.

558
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,358
Mr Thwackum advanced to rebuke him
when, I am sorry to say,

559
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,473
he fell upon the worthy man
and beat him outrageously.

560
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,597
Tell me, child, what objection
can you have to the young gentleman?

561
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,439
A very solid objection, in my opinion -
I hate him.

562
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,712
Well, I have known many couples
who have entirely disliked each other

563
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,479
lead very comfortable, genteel lives.

564
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,478
Madam, I assure you,
I shall never marry a man I detest.

565
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,511
I still believe the young man
to have a few redeeming graces.

566
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,596
Some of the crimes you accuse him of

567
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,315
sprang from his mistaken compassion
for the gamekeeper and his family.

568
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,874
Compassion, sir? Lust!

569
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,598
All his gifts, his so-called generosity,

570
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,678
were merely bribes
to debauch another innocent.

571
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,916
As you know, the unfortunate Molly...

572
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,474
Miss Sophie Western
will be the next to be undone.

573
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,511
All this I would have revealed long ago,

574
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,918
had not Master Blifil begged me
to give him another chance.

575
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,356
Send him to me.

576
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,916
Tom, I have forgiven you
too often in the past

577
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,160
out of compassion for your youth
and in hope of your improvement.

578
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,188
You must leave my house for ever.

579
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,118
However, I have educated you
like my own child

580
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,152
and would not turn you naked
into this world.

581
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:53,234
Here is something which will enable you,
with industry, to get a good employment.

582
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,590
Goodbye, Tom.

583
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,996
Goodbye, sir.

584
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,556
Goodbye, sir.

585
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,356
Stay, boy. Stay.

586
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,876
Mr Allworthy is very sensible
of the many advantages

587
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,560
of binding our two estates together.

588
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,635
Indeed?

589
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,309
I had not realised Mr Allworthy was
so interested in questions of property.

590
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,032
Oh, he is.

591
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,673
And you?

592
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,555
I? Well, naturally my attentions
are set constantly

593
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,310
on those most blissful and sanctified
pleasures of holy matrimony.

594
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,998
Clandestine amours so soon, Mr Blifil?

595
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,837
I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.
I feel a little... faint.

596
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,233
The fox, Mr Blifil, the fox.

597
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,996
Tally-ho!

598
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,871
It is you who have taught her
disobedience, Brother.

599
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,831
You are such a boor!

600
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,714
Boar? I am no boar! No! Nor ass!

601
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,513
Ah, more-than-gothic ignorance!

602
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,033
As for your manners, they deserve a cane!

603
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,077
And yours I despise
as much as I do a fart!

604
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,472
And as for your niece, I'm going
to lock her up in my tower this time!

605
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,113
You'll do nothing of the sort!

606
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,279
- Honor, promise to keep your word.
- I can't, madam. I'm frightened. I can't.

607
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,234
- I'm frightened, madam.
- Aaargh! Aaargh!

608
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,954
Got you, my girl! Come on!

609
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,236
Come on. You won't get out this time,
I warrant you!

610
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,471
<i>Our hero was now on the road to London.</i>

611
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,912
<i>His first adventure was with a party
of those men whose profligate ways</i>

612
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,830
<i>could be conducted with safety
only under the protection of red coats.</i>

613
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,794
Good day, gentlemen.
Which way are you heading?

614
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,629
- North, to fight for the Protestant cause.
- Against Prince Charles?

615
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,513
Those damned Scots
are already on their way to England.

616
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,996
I've been walking all day and I'm hungry.
May I buy some food and drink?

617
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,918
- Right, give him some.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

618
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,437
- Good day, Captain.
- Good day.

619
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,516
I perceive you are a gentleman.

620
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,200
We should be glad to
welcome you into our company.

621
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:53,030
- I'd be glad to march with you.
- Good. We shall be on the march shortly.

622
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,753
<i>There comes a time when men
in a constant state of readiness for war</i>

623
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,032
<i>will slip their leash and fight like dogs.</i>

624
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,717
I believe... that a man can fight for
no nobler cause than that of his religion.

625
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,398
Hear, hear.

626
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,876
I'd like to propose a toast
to the Protestant cause.

627
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,629
Smoke the prig out, Northerton.
Smoke him.

628
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,911
Sir, were you ever at university?

629
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,715
Sir, so far from having been at university,
I was never at school.

630
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,114
Me neither!

631
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,313
I only presumed, sir, from the information
of your great learning.

632
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,989
<i>Sir, it is as easy for a man not to have
been at school and know something</i>

633
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,873
as it is for a man to have been at school
and know nothing.

634
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,638
Well said, young volunteer.

635
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,595
Upon my word, Northerton, you'd best let
him alone or he'll prove too hard for you.

636
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,678
Give us a toast, young fellow.
Fill up his cup.

637
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,759
I would like to propose a toast...

638
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,950
to the health, and bless the name...
of Miss Sophie Western.

639
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,195
Sophie Western.

640
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,151
Sophie Western?

641
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,796
I knew one Sophie Western - was lain with
by half the young fellows at Bath.

642
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,558
Perhaps this is the same woman.

643
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,069
Miss Western is a lady
of fashion and fortune.

644
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,115
Oh aye, so she is, so she is!
Aye, it is the same young lady.

645
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,918
I'll lay half a dozen of Burgundy
Tom French of our regiment

646
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,600
had her in the tavern at Bridge Street!

647
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,756
Sophie Western!

648
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,317
Sir! I can bear no jesting
with this lady's character.

649
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,830
Jesting? Damn me if I was
ever more in earnest in my life.

650
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,750
<i>Tom French of our regiment
had her and her aunt together at Bath.</i>

651
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,189
You are the most impudent
rascal on earth!

652
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,388
You've killed him, you swine!

653
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,549
Zounds, I was but in jest with the fellow.
I never heard of Miss Western in my life.

654
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,834
Then you deserve to be hanged. You are
under arrest. Sergeant, take him away.

655
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,916
Arrest him.

656
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,789
<i>But a hero cannot be lost
until his tale is told.</i>

657
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,229
<i>For, heaven be thanked,
we live in such an age</i>

658
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,148
<i>where no man dies for love
except upon the stage.</i>

659
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,070
I'll kill you, Northerton...

660
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,668
I'm going to kill you, Northerton!

661
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,832
Northerton... Northerton...

662
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,631
Must find Northerton.

663
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,230
Must find Northerton...

664
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,196
Northerton!

665
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,236
Northerton!

666
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,556
Northerton!

667
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,799
Northerton!

668
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,510
Help! Help!

669
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,074
The ghost walks!

670
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,077
<i>Shh! Shh!</i>

671
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,076
Shh-shh-shh!

672
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,032
Come on, you, get up.

673
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,993
I can't afford for you
to lie here idle any longer.

674
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,634
Get out and follow
them rascally friends of yours!

675
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,910
You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen,

676
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,919
but it's we who have to pay for you -
and keep you too, for that matter!

677
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,828
- What are you talking about?
- That Lt Northerton escaped last night.

678
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,394
The rest of the company
went in pursuit after him -

679
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,829
and conveniently left
without paying the bill.

680
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,511
- How could he have escaped?
- His doxy, a trollop called Mrs Waters.

681
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,710
The sentry disappeared
and she let him out.

682
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,990
She'll soon learn what kind of a man he is.

683
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,079
Nothing's good enough for sparks like
him, but paying the bill is another matter!

684
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,875
Don't worry, madam.
I will repay you handsomely.

685
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,798
Ah, sir... A nice young
gentleman like yourself

686
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,390
shouldn't want to get mixed up
with them rough soldiers.

687
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,029
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

688
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,516
<i>I had a Pounds. 500 note in my breeches pocket
and it's gone!</i>

689
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,788
<i>- That's a likely story.
- I had Pounds. 500...</i>

690
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,879
<i>- You never had Pounds. 500 in your life!
- One single note of Pounds. 500, and it's gone!</i>

691
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,389
- I should've known your kind...
- Who took it?!

692
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,308
<i>Somebody's been in this room during the
night and taken Pounds. 500 out of my pocket!</i>

693
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,399
<i>Was it you? Did you see her take it?
Somebody took the Pounds. 500 out of...</i>

694
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,310
You lying rascal! Nor them cheating
redcoat friends of yours, neither!

695
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,749
Go on, take your things
and get out of here quick!

696
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,031
Go on! I'll set the dogs on you
if you don't hurry up!

697
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,038
<i>You blackguard! Robber!
The whole lot of you! You and your Pounds. 500!</i>

698
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,909
Wake up, you country stewpot!

699
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,031
Your daughter, sir!

700
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,358
While you've been lying a-bubbling here,
your daughter is gone!

701
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,430
Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.

702
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,835
Your daughter is gone!

703
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,188
What?!

704
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,917
Come on, you lazy lot, and take the
London road! Come on, Miss Slouch!

705
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,754
<i>- Are you wanting anything, madam?
- We're tired and in need of refreshment.</i>

706
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,189
It'd be an honour to serve such a lady.

707
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,915
Has by any chance a young gentleman,
a Mr Jones, passed this way?

708
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,874
Indeed he has. I'm surprised at a lady
like you inquiring of the likes of him -

709
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,310
brawling, thieving, bragging about
his mistress - one Sophie Western.

710
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,750
- Sophie Western?
- I'm not surprised, after Molly Seagrim.

711
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,192
- But I am the same Sophie Western.
- Well, you can get out of here quick!

712
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,393
Go on! Follow your fine friend. Take
your fine airs and graces with you!

713
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,990
This is a respectable house!
We don't want the likes of you here!

714
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,315
<i>Our hero's next adventure
concerns a lady in circumstances</i>

715
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,989
<i>from which any gentleman
would instinctively wish to free her -</i>

716
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,270
<i>but of which any man
who was not a gentleman</i>

717
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,278
<i>might instantly want to take advantage.</i>

718
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,789
Let her go, villain!

719
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,396
You savage!

720
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,316
<i>Aaargh!</i>

721
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:43,639
Sure, I've only myself to blame for trusting
in a man so unworthy of my favours.

722
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,911
No, sir - you've had trouble enough.

723
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:52,160
My nakedness may well shame me. I'd go
alone, but for the need of your protection.

724
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,352
Well then, in case
any prying eyes should offend you,

725
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,870
I will walk ahead
and escort you as far as Up... Upton.

726
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,997
<i>So Tom and Mrs Waters - for so the lady
was called - set out on the road to Upton,</i>

727
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,271
<i>Tom, like Orpheus leading
Eurydice out of Hell,</i>

728
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,030
<i>hardly daring to look back
in case the fires consumed him.</i>

729
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,078
Sophie! Sophie Western!

730
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,155
Sophie!

731
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,272
- Cousin Sophie!
- Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs Fitzpatrick!

732
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,231
- My cousin Harriet?
- The same.

733
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,952
Why, so it is.

734
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,518
- Cousin!
- Harriet!

735
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,993
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to London.

736
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,999
<i>That is my destination. But why
are you both on one horse, indeed?</i>

737
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,680
Oh, Harriet,
I am running away from home.

738
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:30,228
And I too - running away
from my husband, Mr Fitzpatrick,

739
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,635
who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.

740
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,719
Oh, never marry an Irishman -
particularly if he is eaten up with jealousy,

741
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,991
possessed of a quick temper,
and a mighty fool into the bargain.

742
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,270
But what will you do alone in London?

743
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,712
I have a friend. He has taken lodgings
for me in Curzon Street.

744
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,477
Cousin.

745
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,149
He's a dear, kind man,
and a peer of the realm.

746
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,077
You can stay with me.

747
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,838
- May I?
- Come on.

748
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,155
- But your friend.
- He is away for a few days.

749
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,589
When he returns
we will make other arrangements.

750
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,553
Now get in, Cousin,
and tell me about yourself.

751
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,831
Landlady, two rooms, please.
And perhaps you'd find this lady a gown.

752
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,111
She's been involved in an accident
and deprived of her clothes.

753
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,470
Take us to our rooms at once.

754
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:04,076
<i>Heroes - whatever high ideals we may
have of them - are mortal, not divine.</i>

755
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,875
<i>We are all as God made us,
and many of us much worse.</i>

756
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,559
<i>All right, all right, I'm coming.</i>

757
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,830
I'm coming, I said!

758
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,028
- Where's me wife?
- Who?

759
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,311
Me wife! Mrs Fitzpatrick.
I have come a distance to fetch her.

760
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,399
- There's no Mrs Fitzpatrick here.
- I know she's here! I know it.

761
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,080
Where is that serpent-toothed siren?!

762
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,478
Who's here, girl? Tell me, and I'll make
you the richest poor woman in the nation.

763
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,591
There's only a gentleman - Mr Jones.

764
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,836
- No lady?
- He has a Mrs Waters with him.

765
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,713
Waters! I'll bet she's usin' a false name!

766
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,716
That cunning wench! By the waters
of the Babylon I shall lay me down...

767
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,513
I'll bet she's lying down beside Mr Jones!

768
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,596
Show me her room!

769
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,036
Now where is she?
Where is that painted Delilah?!

770
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,829
- Down the end there.
- Mrs Fitzpatrick!

771
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,155
- Come on, Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- My husband!

772
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,999
- Your husband?!
- Do you think I don't know his voice?

773
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,711
Discovered, you whore!

774
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,991
Aaargh! Rape! Murder! Rape!

775
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,400
- What is it, lassie?
- A rape's going on down there!

776
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,475
Rape?!

777
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,239
Rape! Murder! Murder!

778
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,791
What is all this?!

779
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,390
Mr MacLachlan, dear friend!
I rejoice to see you here.

780
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,990
- This villain has debauched my wife!
- Your wife? What wife?

781
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,236
Do I not know Mrs Fitzpatrick very well?

782
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,319
And can I not see that the lady in bed with
this gentleman is not your wife at all?!

783
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,194
Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!

784
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,117
Girl, what's this hullabaloo?

785
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,629
'Tis Tom Jones, madam,
in bed with Mrs Waters

786
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,797
and discovered by her husband -
an Irish gentleman, madam.

787
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,956
Forgive me - did you say Tom Jones?

788
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,230
Yes, madam - in bed
with that trull Mrs Waters.

789
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,316
Betrayed!

790
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,914
Ma'am, pray forgive
my dastardly intrusion. I...

791
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,110
What the devil is this disturbance?

792
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,550
I thought myself in a respectable inn,
but I see now it's a bawdyhouse!

793
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,069
I have made a mistake.
I was looking for me wife.

794
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,077
These villains burst into me room!

795
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,715
I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.
I thought you was me wife.

796
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,549
Though I see no reason for a gentleman
to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.

797
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,638
I heard her screams
and ran in from the adjoining chamber.

798
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,035
Adjoining chamber!

799
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,515
It seems I have prevented
the lady being robbed.

800
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,313
- Robbed!
- Robbed? I'll have your blood for that!

801
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,271
- You wild Irishman!
- Rape!

802
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:56,718
Come on, Sophie, dear. We must fly
before Fitzpatrick discovers me.

803
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:01,960
Oh, come, pull yourself together, Coz.
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

804
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,918
Help!

805
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,273
Sophie...

806
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,711
Ah, got you, you fox!

807
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,876
Well, the vixen can't be far away!

808
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,553
Goodbye, madam.
I regret I must take my leave of you.

809
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,751
Odds bodikins! After him!

810
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,233
After him! Damnation! After him!

811
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,350
- Oh! There he is!
- Miss Western!

812
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,596
Brother!

813
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,516
Don't be dismayed, sir. She will soon
be tired and will stop in some inn.

814
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,110
<i>- She's bound for London, I'm sure.
- Ah, damn the girl.</i>

815
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,869
I'm lamenting the loss
of such a fine morning for huntin'.

816
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,596
It's confounded hard to lose one
of the finest scentin' days of the season.

817
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:04,995
Whoa!

818
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,955
Ha!

819
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,799
- Come on, Miss Slouch!
- What are you doing?

820
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,559
Oh!

821
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,318
Dobson, drive on.

822
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,158
Get up, there! Get up!

823
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,230
Stand... and deliver!

824
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,873
Whoa!

825
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,833
- What did you say, sir?
- Stand and deliver!

826
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,591
Deliver? I am no travelling midwife, sir.
Deliver what?

827
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,755
Stand...

828
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,839
I will not stand for you, sir -
no, nor for any man!

829
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,793
- Madam...
- Don't you point that firearm at me, sir!

830
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,797
- Dobson, drive on.
- Get up there!

831
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,516
<i>It is hard when a woman leaves a man
nothing but memories - and a muff.</i>

832
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,556
Your money or your life!

833
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,998
- I only have one guinea, sir.
- Give it here.

834
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,560
As a gentleman of the road
you cut a poor figure.

835
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,672
Be merciful, sir.
I didn't mean any harm. Truly I didn't.

836
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,109
- No harm?
- It isn't loaded.

837
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,393
- Nor it is.
- I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.

838
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,795
Just a poor man down on his luck.

839
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,354
Mine, sir, is a sad story.

840
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,591
The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.

841
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:01,316
- It was all over one Tom Jones.
- What do you mean?

842
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,791
At that time I was employed
as a barber by a Mr Allworthy.

843
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,273
One day he found a baby
abandoned in his bed.

844
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,470
I was accused of being the father.

845
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,556
- Then your name is...
- Partridge.

846
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,076
Father!

847
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,195
But I do assure you, sir,
there was no truth in the accusation.

848
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,437
- Then who was my father?
- None of us ever discovered.

849
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,915
That was the whole beginning
of my downfall.

850
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,669
Mr Partridge, how can I make up for
the suffering you've had on my account?

851
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,075
Would you take me on
as your servant, sir?

852
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,237
- My companion in misfortune!
- Oh, sir!

853
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,920
Are lodgings cheap in London?
I have no money.

854
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,793
I know an old lady who runs
a lodging house in London.

855
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,071
She was Mr Allworthy's cook
when I was his barber.

856
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,430
No friend of Mr Allworthy's
will speak to me.

857
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,028
Mrs Miller is one
of the kindest ladies I know.

858
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,720
Who knows? She may
get you back in his favour.

859
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,078
Here, you're a lovely boy.
Are you going to stay?

860
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,317
Good day.

861
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,556
No. No, thank you.

862
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,078
<i>Desperate to find his Sophie,
Tom called on Mrs Fitzpatrick,</i>

863
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:03,991
<i>who was entertaining a certain Lady
Bellaston - the notorious Lady Bellaston.</i>

864
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:09,036
It's the handsome young gentleman again,
madam, inquiring for Miss Western.

865
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,037
You see, Bella, how persistent he is.

866
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,994
His servant discovered this address,
and ever since he persecutes us.

867
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,033
Send him away, Abigail.
Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.

868
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,592
Bella, you must let Sophie
come and stay with you.

869
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:28,998
My protector is coming back, and I fear he
may take too much interest in my cousin.

870
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,192
Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.

871
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,000
Your little maid is obviously in the right.

872
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:41,114
<i>He's a very pretty fellow. No wonder
so many women are fond of him.</i>

873
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,152
Harriet, we must do
what we can for Sophie.

874
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:53,751
The girl is obviously intoxicated, and
nothing less than ruin will content her.

875
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,832
I'm absolutely certain Sophie
was at Mrs Fitzpatrick's when I called.

876
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,712
Dear Mrs Miller, what am I to do?

877
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,798
No friends, no money,
I know nothing of London...

878
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,118
You're not to worry about the money.
You can stay here for the moment.

879
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,151
You're very kind, Mrs Miller.

880
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,475
For you, Tom. It's just arrived.

881
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,676
I wonder, what can it be?

882
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,156
What is it?

883
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,634
It's an invitation to a masked ball.

884
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,312
"The Queen of the Fairies sends you this.
Treat her favours not amiss. "

885
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,159
It's Mrs Fitzpatrick, perhaps,
with news of my Sophie.

886
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,430
Or Miss Sophie herself.

887
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:45,153
<i>Vauxhall Gardens,
where people come to see and to be seen.</i>

888
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,149
<i>In heaps they run, some to undo
and some to be undone.</i>

889
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,475
<i>It's no fun for a man like me
to be dolled up in this damned fruppery!</i>

890
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,354
All folks of fashion are here.
Sophie will be no exception.

891
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,550
Show her to me
and I'll have her arrested!

892
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,956
Arrested! Do you imagine
a woman of stature

893
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,356
can be arrested in a civilised nation?

894
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,312
A pretty civilised nation indeed,
where women are above the law!

895
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,159
Civilisation, my trunk!

896
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,794
<i>Je vous méprise de tout mon coeur.</i>

897
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,791
Now, where can my niece be?

898
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,391
If you engage any longer with that trollop
I shall tell Miss Western.

899
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,278
- Is Sophie here, then, madam?
- Upon my honour, she is not here.

900
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,557
Mrs Fitzpatrick - if you are she - it's a little
cruel to divert yourself at my expense.

901
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,998
And do you imagine, good sir,
I have no better regard for my cousin

902
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,669
than to assist her in carrying on
an affair between you two...

903
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,710
which must end in her ruin?

904
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,434
Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.

905
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:49,190
If the Queen of the Fairies
had so little regard for you and Sophie,

906
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:52,630
she would not have appointed
to meet you here.

907
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,598
Confess honestly:

908
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:05,793
Are you used, Mr Jones,
to make these sudden conquests?

909
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,672
I am used, madam, to submit.

910
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,315
If you take my heart by surprise,
the rest of my body has the right to follow.

911
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,829
I hope you won't follow me.

912
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:19,316
I protest I shall not know
what to say if you do.

913
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,429
Free chair, sir. Free chair.

914
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,473
You must be a pauper if you can't
go in a chair. Or a miser!

915
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,630
I thought you were Mrs Fitzpatrick.

916
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,354
<i>Fitzpatrick...</i>

917
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,914
Sir, I am unfamiliar
with customs in the country,

918
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,158
but in town it is considered impolite
to keep a lady waiting.

919
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:17,756
<i>With our usual good breeding, we will not
follow this particular conversation further,</i>

920
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,519
<i>but attend results on the following day.</i>

921
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:25,030
<i>Our hero released from Lady Bellaston
a torrent of affection -</i>

922
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,798
<i>as well as a flood of gifts,</i>

923
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:30,913
<i>which he found suitably embarrassing
and quite irresistible.</i>

924
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,918
- We must have you looking your best.
- Lady Bellaston...

925
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,600
Isn't that what Miss Western would want?

926
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,315
Come back precisely at four.
I shall have news for you then.

927
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,110
- Send the bill to me, sir.
- Yes, milady. Very good, milady.

928
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,878
Good day, milady.

929
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,559
<i>How could Tom know that Sophie was
now staying here with Lady Bellaston?</i>

930
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,672
<i>And being besieged
by a certain Lord Fellamar,</i>

931
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,749
<i>a gentleman with an eye for any beauty -
especially when a fortune was attached.</i>

932
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,194
I do beg you to excuse the play.
But when may I see you again?

933
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,958
Forgive me, my lord.

934
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:51,471
I'm afraid my plans for remaining
in London are still a little uncertain.

935
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,158
Good day, my lord.

936
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,271
Aaah... Aaah...

937
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,790
Oh, my la... Sophie!

938
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,557
Tom!

939
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,035
<i>I see, Sophie,
you're somewhat surprised.</i>

940
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,512
- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for you.

941
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,996
I found your pocket book at Upton
and came to ask if I might return it.

942
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:53,398
- How dare you mention that place to me?!
- Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.

943
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,954
My pardon?! After what I heard at the inn?

944
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,514
You cannot despise me
more than I do myself.

945
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,118
I thought, Miss Western,
you were at the play.

946
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:10,950
The play caused so violent an uproar,
I got frightened and came home.

947
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,196
Where I found this gentleman.

948
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:17,632
He has apparently found the pocket book
I told your ladyship I had lost

949
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,955
and wishes to return it.

950
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,993
And when I do so, all I ask is that I might
have the honour of presenting it in person.

951
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,152
I presume, sir, you are a gentleman,

952
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,999
and my doors are never shut
to people of fashion.

953
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,589
Thank you, madam. Ladies.

954
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,036
Your cane, sir.

955
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,193
Oh.

956
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,232
A handsome fellow. I don't remember
ever to have seen his face before.

957
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,149
Nor I neither, madam.

958
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,238
I suspected it was Mr Jones himself.

959
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,191
- Did your ladyship indeed?
- Yes.

960
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,073
I can't imagine
what put the idea into my head,

961
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:12,591
for, to give this fellow his due,
he was very well dressed.

962
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:17,119
I think, dear Sophie, that is
not often the case with your friend.

963
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,232
I thought your ladyship
had said he was handsome.

964
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,796
- Whom, pray?
- Mr Jones.

965
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:28,313
I meant, of course,
the gentleman who was with us just now.

966
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:31,000
Oh, Sophie, Sophie...

967
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,438
This Mr Jones, I fear,
still runs in your head.

968
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,517
I assure you, madam,

969
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:41,076
Mr Jones means no more to me
than the gentleman who has just left us.

970
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,270
Forgive me teasing you.

971
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,356
I promise...

972
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,388
I'll never mention his name again.

973
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:03,994
Take this to Lord Fellamar
and beg him to attend me tomorrow.

974
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:07,317
She is the only daughter
of a country booby squire.

975
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,874
At the playhouse she blazed like a star.

976
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,357
The first moment I saw her,
I loved her to distraction.

977
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,836
<i>Her father's estate
is a good Pounds. 3,000 a year.</i>

978
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,474
Then, madam, I think it
the best match in all England.

979
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,194
Then, if you like her, my lord,

980
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,276
you shall have her.

981
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,950
Honor!

982
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,548
<i>A letter from my mistress.</i>

983
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,716
<i>- Upstairs?
- Honor!</i>

984
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,949
- In here.
- I told my mistress she should...

985
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,197
Get behind that curtain
and don't speak! Shh!

986
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:47,519
- My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.
- Dear? Charming?

987
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,712
You've been avoiding me.
I should scold you.

988
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,676
But I don't think I intend to.

989
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,315
- Shh! There is a lady...
- A lady? One of your ladies, I suppose.

990
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,795
- Where is she?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh...

991
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,671
There is a lady in the next room...
a- dying, madam.

992
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:08,749
What scheme have you and Sophie
been plotting behind my back?

993
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,519
- Madam, I don't understand.
- Answer me one question:

994
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,359
Have you not betrayed my honour to her?

995
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,519
Am I neglected,
slighted for a country girl,

996
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,798
for an idiot?

997
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,876
Neglected, madam?

998
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:07,277
<i>"I charge you not to think of visiting
again", Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.</i>

999
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,198
<i>"The truth will certainly be discovered. "</i>

1000
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,837
<i>"Something favourable
perhaps may happen. "</i>

1001
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,959
<i>"Until then, we must be patient. "</i>

1002
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,150
<i>Courage, mon vieux.</i>

1003
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:32,035
Lord Fellamar is one of the most
gallant young fellows about town.

1004
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,712
Make love to you, indeed!
I only wish he would.

1005
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,669
You would be mad to refuse him.

1006
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,232
<i>Then I shall most certainly be mad.</i>

1007
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,112
<i>Entrez.</i>

1008
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:57,073
Madam. Miss Western
is hardly encouraging.

1009
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:01,999
My dear lord, you certainly need a cordial.

1010
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,839
Fie upon it. Have more resolution.
Are you frightened by the word "rape"?

1011
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,791
All women love a man of spirit.

1012
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,037
Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.

1013
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,039
I believe they made tolerably
good wives afterwards.

1014
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,118
Come this evening at nine.
I will see she is alone.

1015
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:31,913
Oh, I am so entangled with this woman
that I don't know how to extricate myself.

1016
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:40,232
- I know. Propose marriage to her.
- To Lady Bellaston?!

1017
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:43,352
Aye. Propose marriage to her
and she'll call it off in a moment.

1018
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,792
You've not a penny, and she'll think
you're marrying her for her wealth.

1019
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,595
It's very convincing for a man
in your desperate situation.

1020
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,872
But what if she took me at my word?
Then I'm caught in my own trap.

1021
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,470
I promise you she won't.
She'll be the one to break it off.

1022
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,113
- Lord Fellamar.
- Miss Western, it is I.

1023
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,437
- I fear I break in upon you abruptly.
- Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.

1024
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:19,030
Love... Love has deprived me
of all reason.

1025
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,957
My lord, I neither understand
your words nor your behaviour.

1026
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:26,550
You're the most adorable,
most divine creature.

1027
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,592
I do assure you, my lord,
I shall not wait to hear any more.

1028
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,792
If I were master of the world,
I would lay it at your feet!

1029
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,911
My lord, I beg you to stop.

1030
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,313
Let go my hand.
I will never see you again.

1031
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:42,399
Then, madam, we must make
the best use of this moment.

1032
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,558
What do you mean?

1033
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,393
I have no fear but of losing you, madam!

1034
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,877
Where is she?
Damn me if I won't unkennel her now!

1035
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,436
Aaagh!

1036
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,232
Oh, Father!

1037
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,796
- Your father?
- Yes. And who in hell are you?

1038
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,795
I, sir, am Lord Fellamar,

1039
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:20,071
the happy man whom I hope
you will accept as your son-in-law.

1040
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,351
You're a son of a whore,
for all your fancy falderals!

1041
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,869
- I resent your tone, sir.
- Resent, me arse!

1042
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,195
I'll teach you to father-in-law me!

1043
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,318
Ooh!

1044
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:33,000
Father, put me down!
Put me down, Father!

1045
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,713
<i>"Dearest madam,"
Tom had carefully written,</i>

1046
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,277
<i>"I am extremely concerned for fear
your reputation should be exposed. "</i>

1047
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,834
<i>"There is only one way to secure it -</i>

1048
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:51,832
<i>that you bestow on me the legal right
to call you mine for ever. Thomas Jones. "</i>

1049
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:58,673
I shall not receive
Mr Jones if he calls here again.

1050
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:04,236
<i>In London, love and scandal are
considered the best sweeteners of tea.</i>

1051
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:09,516
I do not doubt that my niece will welcome
the favours of a man like Lord Fellamar.

1052
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,517
This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.

1053
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,837
But, as you know, Bell,
all country gentlemen are.

1054
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:22,239
I don't then wonder at Sophie's
infatuation for this Jones creature.

1055
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,033
He's an agreeable fellow to look at.

1056
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:28,232
Miss Western, will you believe me
when I tell you

1057
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,477
<i>that he has the audacity
to make love to me?</i>

1058
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,717
Oh, these men!

1059
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:39,872
I would've torn the eyes out of a prince if
he had attempted such freedoms with me!

1060
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,074
Indeed, he's even gone so far
as to propose marriage to me.

1061
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:58,949
With your leave, Bell,
I will show this to my niece.

1062
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,671
Apply it to what purpose you may please.

1063
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,108
- It's from my Sophie.
- Good.

1064
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:15,194
<i>"Sir, " she wrote, "my aunt
has just now shown me a letter</i>

1065
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:19,871
<i>from you to Lady Bellaston which
contains a proposal of marriage. "</i>

1066
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,278
<i>"All I desire is that your name
may never more be mentioned</i>

1067
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,949
<i>to your obliged humble servant,
Sophie Western. "</i>

1068
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,878
You could try Mrs Fitzpatrick.
She might be able to help.

1069
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:50,834
<i>'Tis said that hope is a bad supper,
but makes a good breakfast,</i>

1070
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:55,431
<i>and in the morning Tom set off
for Mrs Fitzpatrick to seek help.</i>

1071
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,638
<i>Not a moment too soon,</i>

1072
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:03,072
<i>for who should arrive
but his old benefactor, Squire Allworthy.</i>

1073
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,794
Mr Allworthy!
What an unexpected pleasure.

1074
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,435
- Good morning, Mrs Miller.
- You are come to forgive him.

1075
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,711
- Forgive who, Mrs Miller?
- Dear Mr Jones.

1076
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,671
Mr Jones, here, madam?

1077
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,156
No, I've come to bring
my nephew Mr Blifil to London.

1078
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:45,628
She must be a most contemptible woman
who can overlook merits such as yours.

1079
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,911
<i>An old acquaintance arrives.</i>

1080
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:05,239
I swear that dirty whore's had it now!
You wait till I get me hands on her!

1081
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,993
<i>Let us meet tomorrow. We will find
a way of easing your predicament.</i>

1082
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,914
Oh...

1083
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,996
Yes, tomorrow.

1084
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:17,792
Thank you.

1085
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,799
Oh!

1086
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:21,672
I'm very sorry...

1087
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,033
My dear sir, I hope no ill blood
remains between us.

1088
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,151
Sir, I don't remember your name.

1089
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,033
Nor I yours, but I remember your face
from the inn at Upton.

1090
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:33,596
- Upton... Then your name is Tom Jones?
- Indeed it is, sir.

1091
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:37,474
<i>Then you have been with me wife after all!
Well, that's for you, you rascal!</i>

1092
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:42,196
And if you don't give me satisfaction
for that blow, I'll give you another!

1093
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,756
Fight, damn you!

1094
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,512
Aargh!

1095
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:28,358
- I'm sorry, but you drew this on yourself.
- Liar! You set on him to rob him!

1096
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:32,189
<i>I was coming out of the house...</i>

1097
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,517
Only to defend myself! He drew his sword!

1098
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:40,154
Step back there. What's this all about?

1099
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,556
Yes - for armed robbery.

1100
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:52,513
- You're certain the bastard will hang?
- No doubt of it.

1101
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:57,395
I hired these two to follow Master Jones -
which they did with rare zeal.

1102
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,638
Good. See that they're properly
taken care of, will you?

1103
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,228
I will break the news to my uncle.

1104
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,720
Mr Jones has one of
the kindest hearts I know.

1105
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,070
He never mentions your name
but to praise it.

1106
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,156
Uncle...

1107
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:22,071
I am afraid to tell you what has happened.
It may shock you too much.

1108
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,191
What's the matter, Nephew?

1109
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,709
Your adopted son, sir - Jones -

1110
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,592
has proved himself
one of the greatest villains on earth.

1111
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,917
If anyone else called him a villain
I'd throw this tea in his face.

1112
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,792
Mrs Miller.

1113
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,515
I know he's not without faults,

1114
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:42,838
but they're those of wildness and youth,
and I am sure many of us have worse.

1115
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,074
At least we're not footpads, Mrs Miller.

1116
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,838
What do you mean?

1117
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,951
Mr Jones has attacked a man.

1118
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,555
He has been sentenced
to be hanged at Tyburn.

1119
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,750
Nobody can save him now.

1120
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:04,591
<i>If he swing by the string
He will hear the bell ring</i>

1121
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,998
<i>And then there's an end to poor Tommy</i>

1122
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:15,831
<i>He must hang by the noose,
For no hand will cut loose</i>

1123
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:20,836
<i>The rope from the neck of poor Tommy</i>

1124
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,396
<i>If he swing...</i>

1125
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,355
<i>If he swing...</i>

1126
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:51,158
<i>And Tom was to swing -
his enemies had determined on that.</i>

1127
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,759
<i>So Lawyer Dowling decided
to pay a call on Mr Fitzpatrick,</i>

1128
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:58,792
<i>and who should receive him
but Mrs Waters.</i>

1129
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:01,395
Strictly confidential.

1130
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,029
I come from a most worthy gentleman,

1131
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:08,596
whose name at the moment
I am not at liberty to divulge.

1132
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:11,837
What does this mysterious gentleman
want of me?

1133
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:16,192
He wants you to help him
see that justice is done.

1134
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:19,876
To make sure that Jones
gets his just deserts.

1135
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,913
For any assistance you can give him
he is prepared to pay handsomely.

1136
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,600
He is? You interest me, sir.

1137
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,076
What is the proposition?

1138
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:48,752
<i>Meanwhile, faithful Partridge
searched for anyone</i>

1139
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,634
<i>who could prove Tom's innocence
of the charge against him.</i>

1140
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,792
Constable...

1141
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,469
Constable, have you seen
a man with a big scar on his cheek?

1142
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,272
No, can't say as I 'ave.

1143
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:04,154
But all the rogues in the district
haunt that tavern yonder.

1144
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,511
Will you accompany me?

1145
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:12,077
I don't go searching for trouble, friend.
It's easy enough to come by.

1146
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:32,995
Excuse me... Are you the two gentlemen
that saw the fight with Mr Jones?

1147
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,117
Tom cannot escape the gallows
unless you retract your evidence.

1148
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:43,995
I beg you to do so. And in the meantime,
I assure you, you will be rewarded.

1149
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,873
<i>Hark ye, sir, everything we said was true!</i>

1150
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,593
Now if I were you, I'd be off,
or you're gonna be the worse for it!

1151
01:54:56,440 --> 01:55:01,195
<i>Only one hope was left now,
poor Partridge thought - Fitzpatrick.</i>

1152
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,276
Now that's better.

1153
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,751
You'll be all right in a minute.

1154
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:13,356
Come in.

1155
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,399
Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs Fitzpatrick.

1156
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:20,193
Well, if it isn't Mr Partridge!

1157
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,596
Jenny Jones!

1158
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:27,279
- But I'm Mrs Waters now.
- Whatever are you doing here?

1159
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:30,312
I'm a close friend of Mr Fitzpatrick.
I'm looking after him.

1160
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:34,718
Well, indeed, I came to see Mr Fitzpatrick
to plead for your son.

1161
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,479
- My son?!
- Your son, Tom Jones.

1162
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,478
He never intended
to wound Mr Fitzpatrick.

1163
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:44,149
But I met the man who wounded
Mr Fitzpatrick, at Upton.

1164
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,636
Then that is the same man -
your son, Tom Jones.

1165
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,078
<i>With his own mother?!</i>

1166
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,677
- With Jenny Jones?!
- How could either have known, sir?

1167
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,234
Good heavens,
in what miserable distresses

1168
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,794
do vice and imprudence involve men!

1169
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:02,037
Ma'am, there's a Mrs Waters here
to see Mr Allworthy.

1170
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:05,516
- What is she doing here?!
- The very woman herself, sir.

1171
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:09,474
- You probably don't recognise me, sir.
- Indeed you are much changed.

1172
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,670
But what business
can you have with me now?

1173
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:14,837
Such business as I can impart
only to you, sir.

1174
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,676
Pray leave us.

1175
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,639
This, sir, is the very man
I was telling you about!

1176
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,957
- But he is my steward.
- Nevertheless, this is the man.

1177
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,275
- Do you know this lady?
- That lady, sir?

1178
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:54,029
Mr Dowling, if you value my favour,
you will not hesitate, but answer truly.

1179
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:57,436
- Do you know this lady?
- I have seen her, sir.

1180
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:01,712
Before my sister died,
did she give you a letter for me, sir?

1181
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,356
Come with me, sir.

1182
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:23,000
Partridge, have my coach
brought round at once!

1183
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,872
Yes, sir.

1184
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,597
- Uncle...
- Before I return, you'd best find the letter

1185
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:33,395
which your mother gave
to Dowling here before she died!

1186
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,359
Ah, good day, neighbour.
Are you going to see your bastard hang?

1187
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,268
On the contrary, Mr Western,
we're going to Newgate jail to save him.

1188
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,197
Save him? Save him for what?

1189
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:49,118
And this what Mr Allworthy
is saying to Mr Western:

1190
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,708
My friend Mr Fitzpatrick
has now recovered

1191
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:54,229
and is no longer
charging Tom with robbery.

1192
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:56,351
I'm as pleased as if
he were me own son -

1193
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:58,789
which, it may surprise you
to know, he's not.

1194
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,878
Mr Allworthy's own sister Bridget
was Tom's mother,

1195
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,309
and I the one who put the baby
in the squire's bed.

1196
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,556
And that is what it says in the letter.

1197
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:10,719
And so Tom is now my only heir!

1198
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:13,035
Your heir? Did you say your heir?

1199
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:17,756
Yes, neighbour. To Newgate, Goody,
and drive for dear life!

1200
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:22,635
But I always loved that boy best!
He shall have my Sophie by the hand!

1201
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,629
Tyburn, here I come!
Come on, Miss Slouch! Come on!

1202
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:36,359
<i>And another old acquaintance
has arrived,</i>

1203
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:41,156
<i>not only reinstated in the army,
but now in charge of the condemned.</i>

1204
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:56,237
On your life, Goody, faster!

1205
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,196
Turnkey!

1206
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,792
I have come to release a Mr Tom Jones.

1207
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:28,037
We sent him off hours ago.
He'll be strung up by now.

1208
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:31,277
- But they can't hang him!
- I have procured this pardon for him!

1209
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,915
- They can't hang an innocent man!
- They have done often enough before.

1210
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,874
They won't have reached Tyburn yet.
We must stop them. Come.

1211
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,600
<i>If he swing by the string</i>

1212
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:54,518
<i>He will hear the bell ring</i>

1213
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:59,191
<i>And then there's an end to poor Tommy</i>

1214
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,598
Faster, faster, Goody!

1215
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,674
Better luck in the next world, Mr Jones.

1216
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:41,557
<i>To die for a cause is a common evil.
To die for nonsense is the devil.</i>

1217
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:47,077
<i>And 'twould be the devil's own nonsense
to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.</i>

1218
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,112
Aargh!

1219
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,713
Oh, my dear boy! Forgive me!

1220
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:26,875
Forgive you?

1221
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,118
How can I ever make amends for those
unjust suspicions I've held of you?

1222
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:35,153
- You have always used me kindly.
- No, Nephew. I have used you cruelly.

1223
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,918
- Nephew?
- Yes.

1224
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,110
You are indeed illegitimate,

1225
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:43,870
but your mother was not this lady here,
but my sister Bridget.

1226
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:47,114
- Uncle!
- It is true, Tom.

1227
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,310
Ah, this is no time for explanations!

1228
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:53,353
Tom, thou art as hearty a cock
as any in the kingdom.

1229
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,436
Go on, after your mistress.

1230
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:59,708
Alas, I fear I've sinned against her
for all time. I doubt if she'll speak to me.

1231
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:04,755
No, Tom, don't say you've lost her yet.
Go to her now.

1232
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:08,553
<i>- Go on, Tom,
- Go to her.</i>

1233
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,432
<i>Go on, lad.</i>

1234
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:12,951
I will!

1235
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,639
Ah, go to her, lad! To her!

1236
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,310
Hark ye, Allworthy, I'll bet thee
a thousand pounds to a crown

1237
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:32,113
we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.

1238
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:38,278
<i>Happy the man and happy he alone,
he who can call today his own,</i>

1239
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:42,871
<i>he who, secure within,
can say "Tomorrow, do thy worst,</i>

1240
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,389
<i>for I have lived today. "</i>
