1
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,878
<i>It</i>'<i>s a mad, mad, mad--</i>

2
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,961
Did you see it,
the way he went sailing right out there?

3
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,067
-He just went sailing out there.
-It was just terrible.

4
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,864
He must have been doing over 80.

5
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,030
An ambulance....
We ought to call an ambulance.

6
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,574
Look at that car.

7
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,873
He must have gone by you
doing 90 miles an hour.

8
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,506
He was passing me!
I never saw such a crazy thing in my life!

9
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,709
-Let's get down there.
-Let's go.

10
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,777
We're going down there.

11
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,685
Russell, be careful.
Remember your condition.

12
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,490
Boy, the way he just sailed out there....

13
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,061
Look out.

14
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,630
There's nobody in the car.

15
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,370
-He's right.
-What do you mean, nobody?

16
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,632
There he is.

17
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,338
Holy smoke!

18
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,413
How about that? This guy's still alive.

19
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,014
He's still alive.

20
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,946
We ought to call an ambulance.

21
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,454
I don't know how he survived,
the way you went sailing right out there.

22
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,690
I'm not a doctor,
but I have some medical experience.

23
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,852
I'm a dentist.

24
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,494
Do you think you're hurt real bad?

25
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,298
Is he kidding?

26
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,832
Hold on, we're gonna get you to a hospital.

27
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,599
You move me, I'll break up in little pieces.

28
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,606
But what a deal.

29
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,807
Look, there's this dough, see?

30
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:56,245
There's all this dough: $350,000!

31
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,345
Do you hear what I'm saying?

32
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,618
$350,000!

33
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:06,649
In the park, in Rosita,
Rosita Beach State Park...

34
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,853
...just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.

35
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,059
It's in this box buried under this....

36
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,600
Buried under this big W.

37
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,130
You'll see it.

38
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,308
You'll see it under this big W.

39
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,344
You can't miss it, a big W.

40
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,878
And it's been laying there for 15 years.

41
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,482
He's very sick. He may die.

42
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,214
Listen. I tell you, I'm giving it to you.

43
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,423
And don't let them kid you.

44
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,261
Don't let them give you the business
because it was mine and I paid for it...

45
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,594
...paid for every lousy buck of it.

46
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,097
But watch out.

47
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,804
Watch out for the bulls.

48
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,671
Lousy, stinking bulls are everywhere.

49
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,007
Bulls all over the place.

50
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,505
You just drive down and dig it up.

51
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,573
Dig it all up.

52
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,315
And then you fix yourselves all up.

53
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,114
Fix yourselves all up.

54
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,662
Walk down the street like a king,
back to the old neighborhood.

55
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,061
See the fellas, the dames...

56
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,264
...the dames, all with a big hello...

57
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,866
...a big hello for old Smiler.

58
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,039
Good old Smiler...

59
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,511
...everybody's friend.

60
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,808
Everybody's....

61
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,190
-Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
-Holy mackerel! Take it easy.

62
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,418
Please, say it don't make
any difference, Aunt Belle!

63
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,691
Please, you got to say....

64
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,691
You got to tell me
it don't make any difference!

65
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,435
For heaven's sake, tell him.

66
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,530
It don't make any difference.

67
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,560
That guy's dead. You'd better believe it.

68
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,060
I believe it, all right.

69
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,160
But if he jumps up again,
I'm getting the hell out of here.

70
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,407
-What a routine he went through.
-Somebody ought to cover him up.

71
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,778
What are you looking at?
All I got is this sweater.

72
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,779
I got a blanket in the truck.

73
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,608
Do you think
there was anything in all that?

74
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,114
He was just raving. He flipped.

75
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,149
This must be the police.

76
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,314
Think we ought to tell them what he said?

77
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,394
Don't say anything or we'll be here all day.

78
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,225
We got to be in Vegas this afternoon.

79
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,390
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma.

80
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,230
My wife and I are on
our second honeymoon.

81
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:08,467
My wife's up there with her mother.
We're on our way to Lake Mead.

82
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,634
What's to argue about? Just clam up.
Don't say nothing.

83
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,609
This way, we get out of here.

84
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,877
Are you a police officer?

85
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,890
Yep!

86
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,229
-How long ago did this happen?
-A few minutes ago.

87
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,427
About five minutes ago.

88
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,167
Any of you actually see it happen?

89
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,270
-He passed me on the curve--
-Did anybody actually see it?

90
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,937
He was passing me
when he sailed right out there.

91
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,946
-Right over there, up there.
-Who was the first down here?

92
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,380
We all went down.

93
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,217
Was he dead?

94
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,381
Was he already dead?

95
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,519
I said, "Was he already dead
when you got down here?"

96
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,819
Practically.

97
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,424
He was still alive. Did he say anything?

98
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,200
-Did he say anything before he died?
-What about?

99
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,400
What do you mean, "what about?"

100
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,338
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

101
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,150
-He was raving, Officer.
-Raving? What about?

102
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,886
What he said was sort of....

103
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,387
Embarrassing.

104
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,457
What was? Come on.

105
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,954
He thought that this fellow was his aunt.

106
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,859
-His aunt?
-Yeah. His Aunt Belle.

107
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,966
Must have had an aunt named Aunt Belle.

108
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,526
All right!

109
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,802
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

110
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,739
He didn't make that clear at all.

111
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,402
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?

112
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,411
Just a minute.

113
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,947
I'll get your names
and where you can be reached.

114
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,609
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.

115
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,981
We can't stick around.

116
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,079
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.

117
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,591
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma
before I get back to--

118
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,662
We stopped to see if we could help.

119
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,823
We was too late. Let us go, okay?

120
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,798
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.

121
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,495
-We ain't had breakfast yet.
-All right.

122
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,302
I'll have to get your name, anyway.

123
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,633
Hold it.

124
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,767
Me?

125
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,205
-Why?
-In case the coroner wants a statement.

126
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,884
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

127
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,924
I won't be home for a few weeks
but you can get me through my office.

128
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,027
-What'd you say?
-Where is your office?

129
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,396
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company
and it's in Fresno.

130
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,127
-You can call my secretary.
-Ambulance is on its way.

131
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,235
Yeah.

132
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,893
-Is he dead?
-Yeah.

133
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,940
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.

134
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,009
That's all we can get from this group.

135
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,205
Thank you, gentlemen.

136
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,538
Thanks.

137
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,014
There's an unexpected twist for you.

138
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,017
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

139
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,090
-Culpeper's going to scream.
-Yeah.

140
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,563
-We better get our story straight if you--
-What story?

141
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,262
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

142
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,895
He stopped for breakfast.

143
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,668
He went to the gents' room,
climbed out the back window.

144
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,438
So what? Even Culpeper can't say
we should've been in there with him.

145
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,748
What got me is the way
he went sailing out there.

146
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,145
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.

147
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,617
Poor soul.

148
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,328
Melville, what happened?

149
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,227
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.

150
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,730
Well?

151
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,706
-It was a terrible thing.
-Russell, I feel sick.

152
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,335
Take it easy. These things happen.

153
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,176
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?

154
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,445
They only happen because this country
is full of people...

155
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,385
...who, when things happen,
just say, "These things happen."

156
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,855
-And that's why they happen!
-Let's try not to get upset.

157
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,326
Come on.

158
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,125
We got to have control
of what happens to us.

159
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,926
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it.

160
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,691
You're right.

161
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,774
Do you know what those half-wit morons
up in Sacramento do about it?

162
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,471
They just sit there
with their big feet up on their big desk...

163
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:47,017
-...milking 15 million people of as much--
-Listen, I want to say something.

164
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,054
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got to say something.

165
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,953
-What are you looking at?
-I'm watching something.

166
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,422
Benjy, turn around, sit still.

167
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,860
-Play it straight.
-They're not kiddin'. They went for it.

168
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,156
Yeah? What are you going to do now?

169
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,667
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word.

170
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,135
Don't leave out anything.

171
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,069
But do you think he really meant it?

172
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,210
Monica, I don't know about anybody else,
but some of them believed it.

173
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,214
Like those two back there.
Don't look over there!

174
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,084
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.

175
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,552
Like a windmill or a waterfall
or something.

176
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,521
I hope it's not under a waterfall.

177
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,925
Think of something that starts with a W.

178
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,719
Wealth. Which.

179
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,896
Let's see. Where.

180
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,633
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.

181
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,193
One thing Dr. Carroll said was
Russell was to have no undue excitement...

182
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,637
...for at least two weeks
because of his condition.

183
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,800
-But--
-That's why we came on this trip...

184
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,674
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.

185
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,442
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?

186
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,780
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.

187
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,878
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.

188
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,718
I'm only thinking of Russell's condition.

189
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,655
You mean his financial condition,
because that's the only condition he has.

190
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,090
Do you know why your husband
had a nervous breakdown?

191
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,896
It's because he has sunk $40,000,
including $15,000 of my money...

192
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,235
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat.

193
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,838
Not only does nobody like it,
it costs $4 a can.

194
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,912
-Yeah, but--
-"Yeah, but," what?

195
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,272
Most people like it and I like it.

196
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

197
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,877
You were working hard
to keep the costs down...

198
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,216
...the day you ran
into the street screaming.

199
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,450
-Mother!
-Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!

200
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,324
Maybe he was playing
a trick on everybody.

201
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,865
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.

202
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,395
Monica! Practical!

203
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,298
What kind of man is going to play
a practical joke on complete strangers...

204
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,703
...with every bone in his body broken?

205
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,766
-Watch! Watchtower!
-No.

206
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,571
-Wall...
-No.

207
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,341
-Walnut tree.
-No, no!

208
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,776
-Walnuts.
-No!

209
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,350
-In bags.
-No!

210
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,785
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.

211
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,948
-Mother!
-They'll see what we're doing.

212
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,059
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

213
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,457
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

214
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,874
Going to leave the big boy behind?

215
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,361
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

216
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,592
It's no use. We can't lose them this way.

217
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,732
The inside of my stomach....

218
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,512
What's that idiot in the truck doing?

219
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,655
What's he doin' back there?

220
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,892
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!

221
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,573
What happened to you?

222
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,839
-Having trouble with your engine?
-Run out of gas?

223
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,276
-What, you bend your tailpipe?
-No. It was just one of my tires.

224
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,983
I thought....

225
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,980
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to....

226
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,245
Rats.

227
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,881
This whole thing....
I think we're making a big mistake.

228
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,984
-I absolutely agree.
-So?

229
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,556
We're being silly running around like this.

230
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,098
-Sure. We're getting nowhere.
-By george, he's right.

231
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,396
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...

232
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,937
-...and reason something out.
-I'm with you.

233
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,075
And we can come to some conclusion
like intelligent people.

234
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,040
Let's do that: what he said.

235
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,341
That way nobody will have an advantage
on one another, right?

236
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,607
It's fair.

237
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,511
We'd better get the cars off that curve.

238
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,552
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.

239
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,212
Fine, see you over there.

240
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,415
Over there.

241
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,760
You're through to Homicide.

242
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,965
Santa Rosita Police Station...

243
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,865
...Detective Division.

244
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,199
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

245
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,166
Detective Division. Matthews.

246
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,106
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

247
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,944
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?

248
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,174
-Sheriff, Crockett County.
-Who?

249
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,314
-That's where the Smiler is.
-I wonder if anything happened.

250
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,785
Gertie, will you put that call through here?

251
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,146
How about some coffee, Schwartz?

252
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,195
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.

253
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,593
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

254
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,600
Afraid I got some bad news.

255
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,931
-Grogan's cashed in his chips.
-He what?

256
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,735
<i>He crashed his car about 20 minutes ago.</i>

257
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,404
<i>He was making a break, all right.</i>

258
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,146
How did it happen? Where did it happen?

259
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:58,587
On 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction.

260
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,649
<i>-Nine miles west of Valley Center.</i>
-Were there any witnesses?

261
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,520
<i>A few people went down</i>
<i>to see if they could help.</i>

262
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,860
-Was he killed outright?
-I don't know, but I can find out.

263
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,594
<i>Do that. See what they said.</i>

264
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,804
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

265
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,403
It's a great way to start the day.

266
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,477
You wait for 15 years
to solve a really important case...

267
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,279
...and just when you....

268
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,389
It's all right, Chief. I'll get it for you.

269
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,393
He did it again.

270
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,874
Get that fella's number! Get his number!

271
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,642
Get that fella's number! Get his number!

272
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,086
<i>Item: one large furniture van.</i>
<i>Item: one red Volkswagen.</i>

273
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,625
That's them. Call in.

274
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,264
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8.

275
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,095
We just made all four of them
parked alongside the road.

276
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,533
They're standing there talking. Over.

277
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:26,205
<i>Sammy, let that ambulance go.</i>
<i>And stay by the radio.</i>

278
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,547
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried in this park.

279
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,005
Under a big W.

280
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,775
What is a big W?

281
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,910
We find out, we'll send you a wire.

282
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,655
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

283
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:45,794
If it was the truth, then it is a fact
that this place is almost 200 miles away.

284
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,730
I suggest we quietly get into our cars...

285
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,864
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

286
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,539
...keeping in sight of each other.

287
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,275
When we get there, we dig up the money,
providing there is money...

288
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,843
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

289
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,609
He's got a point. He's got something.

290
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,776
-I think we should go straight to the police.
-The police? Why?

291
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,753
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?

292
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,820
We arrived in four vehicles. I think
we should split it up in four quarters.

293
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,687
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

294
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,324
You mean you three each get a quarter
and we have to split a quarter?

295
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,796
That's right. What are you trying to pull?

296
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,033
-Seems fair to me.
-Naturally, it's fair to you.

297
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:35,245
-It just cheats us, that's all.
-$350,000 divided by four is...

298
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,541
...let's say, $87,500.

299
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,275
That's what it is.

300
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,821
The three of you get $87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

301
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,289
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

302
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,654
He's right. We should.

303
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,354
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it
in a five-way manner.

304
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,225
We can discuss it in a five-way manner,
five shares...

305
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,596
...each share would be $70,000--

306
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,328
$70,000?

307
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,526
Holy mackerel!

308
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:03,631
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma--

309
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,232
You're overlooking one thing.

310
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,402
-We're overlooking--
-What little thing?

311
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,844
-What little thing?
-We can all count.

312
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,348
-There were eight of us.
-There were eight of us.

313
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,279
Speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy--

314
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,853
Happy with two-eighths instead
of a quarter? Awfully big of you.

315
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,891
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.

316
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:27,063
Either one quarter for each car,
including the van, or one fifth for each guy.

317
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,100
-Just because this old bag has to stick--
-How dare you!

318
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,937
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

319
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,101
-Look, Smiler Grogan...Remember him?
-Yes.

320
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,677
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

321
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,309
Made his break this morning.

322
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,683
He drove up this way, got to here,
crashed and killed himself.

323
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:53,118
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

324
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,427
They are now stopped here, talking.

325
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,160
I think they're arguing about something.

326
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:04,230
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under observation.

327
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,364
We give shares to everybody
and for everything.

328
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,663
Now, there are eight of us.

329
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,607
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.

330
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,542
If we give four shares for that,
that's 12 shares already.

331
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,345
There were five of us
who went down to the wreck.

332
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,974
We give five shares for that.

333
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,882
That makes it 17, right?

334
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,852
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

335
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,890
...the same number of shares
as people in each vehicle.

336
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,392
Three for your group, two for yours,
two for us, and one for you.

337
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,020
That adds up to 25 shares.

338
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:38,101
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.

339
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,267
Figured like that would mean...

340
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,739
...you'd get three shares for being
three people, one for the car...

341
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,470
...one share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

342
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,944
...and three for being
three more people in the car.

343
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,708
A total of eight shares,
giving you $112,000.

344
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,778
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

345
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,015
Let's see now.

346
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,116
I got one share for being one person...

347
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,786
...one share for going down the hill,
one share for the truck...

348
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,331
...one share for being a person in the truck.

349
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:13,670
But no matter how you figure it out,
I still don't get as much as anybody else.

350
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,169
Let me explain it once more.

351
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:21,237
Their group, they, those three of them,
they get $112,000, right?

352
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,940
Those over there, them, they get $97,000.

353
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,877
We, us, we get $84,000.

354
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:32,022
And you, by yourself, you get $56,000...

355
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,356
...alone.

356
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,450
-That's tax-free money.
-What do you mean, tax-free?

357
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,587
If we go down to this park
and we uncover the money....

358
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,495
I'm sure he's not going to declare anything.

359
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,195
I know he's not going to declare anything.

360
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:49,933
-I'm not going to declare--
-What are you talking about, declare it?

361
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,106
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.

362
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,869
It's like a gift.

363
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,713
If we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

364
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,183
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government.

365
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,181
You explain it to him, please.

366
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,186
Who me?

367
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:10,258
If we find the money,
there may not be taxes to pay on it...

368
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,920
...because we found it.

369
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:15,658
-What he was trying to say is--
-Everybody has to pay taxes.

370
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,331
Even businessmen that rob,
steal and cheat people every day...

371
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,165
...even they have to pay taxes.

372
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,101
I give up.
Anybody got a better, fairer plan, go ahead.

373
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,977
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

374
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,082
-Three for us, two for you--
-This is hopeless.

375
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,312
We'll get no place if we continue
listening to this old bag.

376
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,084
Lady, you trying to split us up
so every man's for himself?

377
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,692
And every woman for himself?

378
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,487
One more funny remark from you--

379
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,791
-Let's get out of here.
-Please, don't argue anymore.

380
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,065
We figured it 17 different ways.

381
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,566
Every time we figured it, it was no good.

382
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,163
No matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like it.

383
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,566
Now there's only one way to figure it.

384
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,440
And that is, every man...

385
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,280
...including the old bag, for himself!

386
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,246
-Good luck and may the best man win!
-Right!

387
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,455
Except you, lady. May you just drop dead!

388
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,657
All right. We all agree on that.

389
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:18,859
Look, let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.

390
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,358
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

391
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,762
...for me...

392
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,164
...and for you...

393
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,199
...and there's enough for--

394
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,471
Melville, my shoe!

395
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,605
Get in the car!

396
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:08,002
2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under observation
are passing this checkpoint.

397
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,942
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.

398
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,081
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

399
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,981
<i>...and the Chrysler Imperial convertible,</i>
<i>all doing about 50.</i>

400
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,020
Yep, they're on their way.

401
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,019
<i>-All traveling in the same direction?</i>
-Right. According to my boys...

402
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,717
...they're all
on reckless driving charges already.

403
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:28,159
None of those people must suspect
that anybody's interested in them.

404
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,428
<i>Now, Sheriff,</i>
<i>will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...</i>

405
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,970
<i>...and see how many helicopters</i>
<i>he can let us have?</i>

406
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,972
I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

407
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,608
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

408
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,441
-I know.
-Where?

409
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,714
-Right there.
-That's right, yeah.

410
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,387
If these merrymakers decide to go for it...

411
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,390
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

412
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,888
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

413
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,520
...if the money is down here somewhere?

414
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,497
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't--

415
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,000
5 will get you 10...

416
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,965
-...they turn south at the crossroads.
-You got yourself a bet.

417
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,955
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we near--

418
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,620
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.

419
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,296
-Are we near Oregon?
-That's 700 miles from here.

420
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,871
Don't pass it!

421
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,750
You'll lose your license.

422
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,689
We've got the lmperial
and we're running last?

423
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,994
I can't pass them on the curves.

424
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,696
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!

425
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,838
You waiting for an engraved invitation?

426
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,541
Get over!

427
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,711
Get over to the side where you belong!

428
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,699
I said it before and I'll say it again.

429
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,203
I didn't want to move to California.

430
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,584
-Did you find it yet?
-I can't find it anywhere.

431
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,278
Take the wheel. Give me the map.

432
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,480
Take the wheel! Give me the map.

433
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,751
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!

434
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,053
It's right here.

435
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,924
There's an airfield not far--

436
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,526
Get it off your face!

437
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,726
-Get it off me!
-Don't go in there!

438
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,100
Swing over! Watch out!

439
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,835
-Take it off.
-Get it off!

440
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,504
I've had enough.

441
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,261
-They're going to hire airplanes.
-Never mind. Go!

442
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,733
-But they'll be there hours before--
-I said never mind. Let's go!

443
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,168
Nobody's getting me up in the air.

444
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,480
I wanted to be reasonable,
give them reasonable shares.

445
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,022
No. They wanted every man for himself.

446
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,556
I'm going to show them
what kind of man they're dealing with.

447
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,598
It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor.

448
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,081
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think--

449
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,480
Never mind.

450
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,744
Here's the bike. Get to the nearest phone
and hire the best car you can find.

451
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,582
But this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.

452
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,594
I've got to get this stuff back
so I can lock up the van.

453
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,392
We'll put everything away.
Will you get going? Hurry.

454
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,594
Okay.

455
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,935
I got to admit...

456
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,134
...I feel kind of silly.

457
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,303
You know what I mean?

458
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,251
Will you take us or won't you?

459
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,383
For $250, I guess I will.

460
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,924
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.

461
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,221
-I'll give you a check.
-Check?

462
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,195
Traveler's check from the Bank of America.
Don't worry.

463
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,902
Are you a pilot? Is there a plane around?

464
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,128
Right both times.

465
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,365
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.

466
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,408
There's only one. We've chartered it.

467
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,273
-So you and your friend--
-Did you make a deal with them?

468
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,609
-Right.
-Where can we charter another plane?

469
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,309
-Nearest place is North Valley.
-Where's that?

470
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,214
Other side of Valley Center,
about 12 miles, 15 miles.

471
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,390
-Excuse us.
-Filibuster, filibuster.

472
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,718
You can stick around
and watch us take off.

473
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,295
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

474
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,389
I hate you so much, I'm not able to tell
you how much in front of your wife.

475
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,865
Vice versa.

476
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,472
Come on over here! Come on!

477
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,407
Good morning.

478
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,351
-Good morning.
-Had an accident?

479
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,486
-Anyone hurt?
-No, but we've got to get to a phone.

480
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,218
Can you give us a lift?

481
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,761
Of course, I should be absolutely delighted.

482
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,361
Upsy-daisy.
I'm afraid you caught me on the hub there.

483
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,837
Madam, do be careful.
I have some cactus specimens--

484
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,430
I'm most frightfully sorry.

485
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:20,640
I've been gathering some samples
of desert flora.

486
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,301
Where shall I put this?

487
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,875
Boy.

488
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,415
Good morning.

489
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,113
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.

490
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,316
Of course, with pleasure.

491
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,485
Jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

492
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,095
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

493
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,790
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

494
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,693
Sounds so foreign.

495
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,837
Really? I say,
we haven't introduced ourselves.

496
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,431
My name is Algernon Hawthorne--
Col. Hawthorne.

497
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,705
-You're a colonel?
-Lieutenant colonel, actually.

498
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,604
My name is Finch. This is my wife.

499
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,281
This is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus.

500
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,076
Do stuff those in the back.

501
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,917
Cactus. It's rather a hobby of mine.

502
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,116
Spent the last 10 days
gathering some for my collection.

503
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,285
Nothing spectacular, actually.

504
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,860
<i>Cereus echinocactus, opuntia</i>.
That sort of thing.

505
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,431
Been enjoying a spot of leave
from Vandenberg.

506
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,558
-From what?
-Vandenberg.

507
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,435
The missile place.

508
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,006
I've been attached there
for the last 10 months. Liaison work.

509
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,666
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.

510
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,246
That sort of thing, you know.

511
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,049
Please, will you look at the road?

512
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,087
Yes.

513
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,395
-Don't stop! Keep moving!
-Mother!

514
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,930
That big stupid lout! He ran into us.
Keep moving!

515
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,039
I won't fly in this old...Listen to it.

516
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,575
Look at how it's shuddering.

517
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,707
Can't we go on our second honeymoon
and forget all about this?

518
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,184
Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.

519
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,622
Do you think I'd take a chance with you
if there was any danger in flying this thing?

520
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,659
This plane is really built.

521
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,256
When was this plane built?

522
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,629
1916.

523
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,130
1916.

524
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,859
1916. These planes are tried and true.

525
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,733
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

526
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,832
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.

527
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,309
Get up there and have some fun.
Here we go.

528
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,816
-That scratched the paint.
-Help!

529
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,770
Haven't you got another car--

530
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,670
What? All right. Thanks.

531
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,214
Are you sure you can't rent us that truck?
I'll pay.

532
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,110
I told you, we can't.

533
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,411
This is our first week open.
How could we do without our truck?

534
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,147
We're in business.

535
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,925
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened--

536
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,618
How can you admit we're involved--

537
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,663
-He'll say he's entitled to a share.
-He would be if he drove us there.

538
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,767
If we don't tell him, he won't.

539
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,728
You're such a genius.

540
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,067
Listen! Only 10 percent!

541
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,403
There's no reason
he should expect any more!

542
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,219
Thanks for stopping.
Can you give me a lift?

543
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,491
What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

544
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,894
No. I had an accident.
I got to get to Santa Rosita fast.

545
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,433
Can't help you.
I'm turning off a little way up.

546
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,797
Wait, let me think.

547
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,271
I got to tell somebody.
Could you spare a couple of hours?

548
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,702
Couple of hours?

549
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,006
You've been out in the sun too long.
You're starting to crack up.

550
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,144
Wait a minute. Listen.

551
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,772
Just hear me out.

552
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,219
What I'm going to tell you, you just
ain't going to believe it could've happened.

553
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,846
There was an accident here
a little while back...

554
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,449
...about 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.

555
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,619
Now, like I say...

556
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:37,324
...when I tell you this, you just ain't going
to believe it could've happened.

557
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,727
Try me. I'm pretty gullible.

558
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,339
What bothers me is this big W.

559
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,948
You sure you told me all you know?
You don't know what that guy meant?

560
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,519
No, none of them know.
It's just who gets there first.

561
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,816
What do you say? Is it a deal?

562
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,721
Deal!

563
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,600
Kid, you better get that bike out of there.
Somebody could trip over it in the dark.

564
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,046
Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.

565
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,711
I had this blowout.
I think a spare's in the back.

566
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:15,155
It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?

567
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,251
If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.

568
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,590
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.

569
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,292
But don't look at me, move it.
You could be gassing up.

570
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,999
What is it, a staring contest?
Move, move, will you? Come on!

571
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,230
The pension in my grade...

572
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:35,005
...has not been upped
one red cent since 1934.

573
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,712
If the Mayor will get behind a resolution--

574
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,720
What can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!

575
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,551
You can, Al.

576
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,424
That's the whole point.

577
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,824
This case, I'll have finished by tonight.

578
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,125
It's one of the biggest cases
we've ever had across our books.

579
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,163
Tell the Mayor about it.

580
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,563
Tell him the money is right here,
where I always said it was...

581
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,605
...right in this neighborhood.

582
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,469
Tell him what credit will be reflected
upon the department.

583
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,637
Come on, Aloysius,
get in there and pitch for me.

584
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,748
I can try.

585
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,642
He'll listen to you.

586
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,649
If he gets behind this,
it'll pass unanimously.

587
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,091
Now, you know....

588
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,391
You know, Al, I got it coming.

589
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,889
I'll do everything I can.

590
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,590
-You know that, don't you?
-Yes.

591
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,531
There's just one other little thing....

592
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,037
No. Nothing.

593
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,399
Vacation.

594
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,409
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way,
my desk is clear.

595
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:45,413
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a real nice holiday.

596
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,846
-Is that all right with you?
-Of course it's all right.

597
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,716
Thanks. I can hardly wait to tell her.

598
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,222
-You won't forget about the Mayor?
-No.

599
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,725
I'll do my best. I promise you that.

600
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,928
Aloysius, I'll never forget you for this.

601
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:04,462
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...

602
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,296
...that everything's coming my way.

603
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,310
Sylvester!

604
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,518
-Why did you do that?
-Why are you shouting?

605
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,319
-Do you have to scare everybody?
-Are you crazy?

606
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,688
Why didn't I think?

607
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,819
We've been running around like lunatics.

608
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,764
Why didn't I think about Sylvester?
He's sitting there right now.

609
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,802
-He lives on Silver Strand Beach.
-I never thought of that.

610
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,735
-Who on earth is Sylvester?
-My son, Emmeline's brother.

611
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,330
He's a lifeguard there.

612
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,569
I'm not entirely certain
that you haven't damaged this machine.

613
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,274
Kid, don't mind polishing.
I got a lot of cars. Don't bother.

614
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,318
You did a good job.

615
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,219
Have a drink on me. Keep the change.

616
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,087
I took care of your buddy. Let me go now.

617
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,159
You!

618
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,626
No! It's that lunatic
who escaped from the asylum!

619
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,096
Watch him! He's a homicidal maniac!

620
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,326
Get on the phone, yell "Mayday."

621
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,266
Listen to me. I'm a psychiatrist.

622
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,930
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.

623
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,370
He has a hate complex.

624
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,499
Calm down!

625
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,841
Somebody will stumble
over the bicycle in the dark, huh?

626
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,643
When I finish with you,
they'll be stumbling over you in the dark!

627
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,645
Get on the phone!

628
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,653
Look out!

629
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,325
Look, I was clowning.

630
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,463
Get out of here! Sir, wait a minute.

631
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,792
You've got this all...Why don't you stop?

632
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,494
I tell you. I'll kill you!

633
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,266
You got this...Wait!

634
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,236
Don't take it so....

635
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,901
Will you stop staring and get out of....

636
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,145
He's out of his head.

637
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,647
-He's crazy!
-Want us to call...Ray!

638
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,311
It's a brand-new pump!

639
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,615
-Get out of here!
-Stop that!

640
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,519
Stop that! He's crazy!

641
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,355
Very good. Quick thinking.
I'm proud of you.

642
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,157
Very good. Tie him up.

643
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,299
I'll have some orderlies come by
with a straitjacket.

644
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,961
-Very good. I'm proud of you.
-I never saw anything....

645
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,738
-How many people has he killed?
-There'll be more.

646
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,899
Tie him up for the boys
in the white jackets.

647
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,909
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job.

648
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,444
Look me up. I'm in the book. Dr. Zillman.

649
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,582
-Sir, we've got to get to Santa Rosita.
-I tell you, this is a club.

650
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,154
We don't do charters.
Nobody here can take you.

651
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:42,214
-Whose plane is that?
-That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald.

652
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,987
He isn't going anywhere today.

653
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,494
-Is he here? Can we see him?
-Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

654
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:52,061
-He's asleep. Nobody can talk to him.
-Can we ask him a question?

655
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,534
No, you can't.

656
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,297
Hello? Wait a minute!

657
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,711
Come on, Benjy.
That must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!

658
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:07,511
-You can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
-We just want to talk to him.

659
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,642
-Let him rest, please.
-Hello.

660
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,615
Don't shush me!
We're trying to talk to him.

661
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,183
Wake up, won't you please?

662
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,061
I think he's got a cold.

663
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,230
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.

664
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:25,059
We hate to disturb your sleep,
but it's an emergency.

665
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,261
You've no right to crash in here.

666
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:30,970
That's a head cold.

667
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,634
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you know where Rosita Beach is?

668
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,441
-Only you can get us there.
-It's a matter of life and death.

669
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,377
Right, a matter of life and death.

670
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,382
-It's our grandmother. She's dying.
-Who's dying?

671
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,580
Our grandmother is dying
and she's sent for us.

672
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,748
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.

673
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,296
She'd like us with her when she goes.

674
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,394
Otherwise, she won't go.

675
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,999
-She'll go.
-Sir, they forced their way in here.

676
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,900
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.

677
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,939
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

678
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,771
-How do you do?
-Don't start with that!

679
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:10,210
Sir, we'd like you to help us out
by taking us down--

680
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,880
-What's the matter?
-Wait just a minute.

681
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,513
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.

682
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,181
I can't see!

683
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,918
You can't see? He can't see.

684
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,962
-Must be an eye cold.
-George, I can't see.

685
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:30,362
-One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
-I can't see! George!

686
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,760
George!

687
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,533
Mr. Fitzgerald!

688
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,041
We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

689
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,307
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...

690
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,546
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?

691
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,683
How come I'm tied up like this?

692
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,220
Just sit there. Everything will be all right.

693
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,882
Yeah. Friends are coming
to take care of you.

694
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:59,223
What friends? What are you talking about?
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.

695
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,224
Take it easy. You've been sick.

696
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,994
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?

697
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,570
Now just sit still,
because the doctor is going--

698
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,640
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

699
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,506
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?

700
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,672
-Get this stuff off me!
-Watch him, Ray, watch him!

701
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:22,548
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.

702
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,253
My arm! You broke my arm!

703
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,400
You keep this up and I'm going to get sore.

704
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:56,416
Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.

705
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,421
I'll kill you!

706
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,496
-Help! He's ruining our place!
-Come on, Ray!

707
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,579
-You better get out of here, mister!
-Leave us alone!

708
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,650
-There you are.
-What are we going to do?

709
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,093
Dr. Zillman!

710
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:54,509
Help! Put me down!
Put me down immediately!

711
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,739
-That's the way you want it?
-Help!

712
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,490
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

713
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:20,460
You're getting out of line.
I'm not kidding. I've had all I can take.

714
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,470
Irwin, we'll have to kill him.

715
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,639
-Ready?
-Ready.

716
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,003
-Set?
-Set.

717
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,201
Charge!

718
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,644
He's going nuts! He's really nuts!

719
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,688
-Go away!
-You'd better get out of here!

720
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,587
I mean it, I don't want to....

721
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,227
What'll we do?

722
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,627
Go away!

723
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,127
Go, baby, go!

724
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,594
He's got to be home.

725
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,933
He never gets up this early.
Why doesn't he answer?

726
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,674
I hope you won't mind my asking,
but what sort of chap...

727
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,508
...is this brother-in-law of yours?

728
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,172
He's a nut. Why?

729
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,543
I hope he's nothing like my brother-in-law.
Peculiar chap.

730
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,644
Secretary of a golf club
out near Pangbourne.

731
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,017
So what about him?

732
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,683
I was thinking that if Reggie,
my brother-in-law....

733
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,058
If Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

734
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,629
...it's likely that would be the last time...

735
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,963
...anyone would ever see or hear
of dear old Reggie.

736
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:11,371
I doubt very much whether old Reggie
will be waiting for us in Santa Rosita.

737
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,603
Cheers.

738
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,651
Tyler! Tyler's probably still in the shower.

739
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,880
Tyler! There he is! Tyler!

740
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,689
-Tyler!
-You promised!

741
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,784
I'll wake him up.

742
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,433
Wake up! Come on now!

743
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,194
-Get out of here!
-Wait!

744
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,139
Mr. Fitzgerald!

745
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,777
You think I'll sit still
while some un-American foreigner...

746
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,749
...makes accusations about
my own flesh and blood?

747
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,082
We'll see about that. Stop this car!

748
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,756
-Really, madam.
-Mother, this is awful!

749
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,325
-So we'll see!
-Mother, what are you doing?

750
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,362
You don't trust your brother-in-law?
Let me tell you something.

751
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,160
If my boy is out, then everybody is out.
So we'll see.

752
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,360
We don't even own the car
and you have no right to do what you do.

753
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:17,769
Rights? You talk to me about rights?

754
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,505
You address me on the subject of rights?

755
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,883
Trouble? Having any trouble?

756
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:31,412
Yes! And we don't need
any help from you.

757
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,585
Well!

758
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,562
Mother, please.
With all due respect, this is too much.

759
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,133
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys
or we'll never get there.

760
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:46,200
Too bad.

761
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:50,295
Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

762
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,204
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?

763
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,973
If we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

764
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,643
...you might be expected to hand me back
my keys so that I could press on.

765
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:06,813
You keep out of this!
Are we calling Sylvester or not?

766
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,159
No!

767
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,029
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...

768
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:18,362
...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum...

769
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,696
...who, if he isn't a crook,
it's only because...

770
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,830
...he hasn't got the brains or ambition
even to become a crook.

771
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,998
Good show!

772
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,703
If you want to come, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

773
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:32,680
But you've got to give us those keys
or you'll force us to take them from you!

774
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,079
Here, here.

775
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,952
Give us those keys.

776
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,560
I don't care where you have them.
I'll get them.

777
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,790
-How dare you.
-Give us those keys.

778
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,163
-You just take one more step towards me--
-I'll take another step.

779
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,533
I'm warning you. You're gonna be sorry!

780
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,640
-Give me the keys.
-You're gonna get it, but good!

781
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,712
-Emmeline!
-Emmeline, stay in the car!

782
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,248
Grab her!

783
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,612
Russell, don't! Mother!

784
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,917
-Put me down!
-Must be stuck.

785
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,256
Russell, you wouldn't.
You couldn't! You shouldn't!

786
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,059
Let me go! Let me get out of here!

787
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,757
I got 'em! Here they are.

788
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:29,027
We really didn't want to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.

789
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,830
Don't hurt him.

790
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,403
Madam, please! Please!

791
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,278
You forced us.

792
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:42,681
I'm willing to say I'm sorry,
but you forced us.

793
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:46,687
-Do us a favor and get back in the car.
-Get away from me! Don't you touch me!

794
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,724
-We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
-Russell, let me go.

795
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,420
Just wait.
You can't manhandle a decent woman.

796
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,020
You're going to jail!
You'll be arrested for assault.

797
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,998
I'm going to sue for everything you've got.
Take your hands off my daughter!

798
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,502
I say, if we are going,
we really must get cracking.

799
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:02,832
Russell, how could you?

800
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,702
-You know we had to--
-Mr. Finch!

801
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:08,937
Please don't go. We'll be right with you.
See, she made us do it.

802
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,206
Let's forget the whole thing
and be reasonable.

803
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,306
-Please get back in the car.
-Not me!

804
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,079
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

805
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:38,435
The cars are going faster than we are.
Can't you make this thing go a little faster?

806
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,568
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lot of gas.

807
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,441
Then open up wide. I'll pay for the gas.

808
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:49,211
-It'll cost you about $50.
-Okay, I'll pay when we land.

809
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:51,513
-Now!
-I got to pay now?

810
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:54,555
-Now!
-All right, I'll pay you now.

811
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,188
-Melville....
-What?

812
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,054
A bug! Get him off!

813
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:02,191
Get him off! There he is! Get him!

814
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,665
-You're breaking up the airplane!
-Is it down there?

815
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,797
Now you're breaking the floor!

816
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,967
Help!

817
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,433
None of these 10 people
have any record at all.

818
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:17,375
And we're ready to book 'em
for withholding information...

819
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,313
...causing accidents,
failing to report accidents...

820
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,250
...reckless driving, theft,
at least three cases of assault and battery--

821
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,288
-Capt. Culpeper?
-Yeah.

822
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,289
-That my home?
-Yes, sir.

823
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,460
Sheriff, excuse me. Another call.

824
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,928
Take the Sheriff. I'll take it in here.

825
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,532
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpeper
to Culpeper's office.

826
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,167
-Hello, Ginger?
<i>-Daddy, it</i>'<i>s Billie Sue.</i>

827
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,275
Let me speak with your mother,
sweetheart.

828
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,680
<i>Well?</i>

829
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:53,880
Dear.

830
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,845
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...

831
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:01,549
...to the most brilliant personality
in the law enforcement industry?

832
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,156
<i>Are you referring to yourself?</i>

833
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,490
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself
for a little shock.

834
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:13,836
-When I tell you what has happened--
<i>-So tell me. I</i>'<i>ve got this biscuit dough--</i>

835
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,996
The Smiler Grogan case is solved.

836
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,733
<i>The what?</i>

837
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:23,474
<i>What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?</i>

838
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,447
The tuna factory robbery.

839
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,246
The case I've been talking about
for the last 15 years.

840
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:36,817
All I want you to do
is make all the preparations...

841
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,995
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

842
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:43,130
<i>-So what</i>'<i>s the gag?</i>
-It is no gag.

843
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,301
Are you serious about flying to Hawaii?

844
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,799
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

845
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,465
<i>-Are we taking Billie Sue?</i>
-No!

846
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:59,007
Just the two of us for about three weeks.
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.

847
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,683
My feeling is that after 27 years...

848
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,680
...we've earned it.

849
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,396
What's the matter?

850
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,736
-I need help. Can you give me a lift?
-What?

851
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,777
My wife is sick.
The doc sent me out for some medicine.

852
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:29,867
All right. Come on.

853
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,913
-I just ran out of gas.
-Get in!

854
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,457
-You?
-You?

855
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,156
Wait a minute. We're in trouble.

856
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,733
Everybody's in trouble.
Get out of the way.

857
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,201
You think we wanted
to leave you back there?

858
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,263
-It was my son-in-law and that Englishman.
-What Englishman? Get out of the way.

859
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:03,037
You leave us here,
and you know what you're going to get?

860
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,273
Nothing! We'll get it all.

861
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:06,405
How will you do that?

862
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:09,451
I'll call my son. He lives about 10 miles
from Rosita Beach.

863
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:13,784
He'll drive there and get the money
and we're going to have it. That's how!

864
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:17,290
I was going to offer you a share
for taking us to a phone.

865
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:21,192
But because you're not interested,
we'll wait for another car.

866
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,820
We're making a terrible mistake.

867
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,899
We should go back
and get my mother-in-law.

868
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,366
-Go back?
-Yes.

869
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,697
You couldn't be serious.

870
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,706
All she has to do is get to a telephone,
my brother-in-law will get there first.

871
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:35,868
They'll get all and we won't get a dime.
You can believe that.

872
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,675
But look here.

873
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,216
Even if she does get all the money,
this won't make any difference...

874
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,289
...to our agreement.
She wouldn't break her word.

875
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:52,154
I mean to say, I'd still be entitled
to 10 percent as agreed. Surely.

876
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,896
Surely. Come on, let's go.

877
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,983
<i>-Operator.</i>
-Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.

878
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:26,394
...and then that dirty, rotten, slimy bum
that double-crossed me.

879
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,692
When I get a hold of that smart aleck,
what I'm going to do....

880
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,562
If you're there, I hope you turn away...

881
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:35,704
...that's all,
that you just look the other way.

882
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:39,966
Did you get him?

883
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,510
Maybe he went out
for the papers or something.

884
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,170
We can keep on trying.

885
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:49,208
Just supposing we never do get him?
We might be the last ones there.

886
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,959
Just a minute. Down there?

887
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,729
You're kidding. It's too steep.

888
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,567
I drive my jeep down here every day.
Let's go!

889
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:11,935
Yeah, let's go. Let's....

890
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:33,395
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks.

891
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,396
Yeah, swell, yeah.

892
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:40,465
Hi, Eddie.

893
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,391
I got to get out of here.

894
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,961
Will you ask your father to show me?
There must be some other way out!

895
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,921
Come on! Hurry up!

896
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:51,303
I could show you a way out.
There's another way to the road.

897
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,705
You know another way to the road?
Good. Come on in. Don't stand there.

898
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:58,871
If you show me the way out,
I'll give you $1.

899
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,276
-$3.
-$3? Why, you....

900
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,352
Yeah, all right. I'll give you $3.

901
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:08,014
But don't stand there, hop in the car.
Hurry kid, I got to get out of here!

902
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,863
-They're not here.
-Probably got a lift.

903
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,839
We only passed six or seven cars
and they weren't in them.

904
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,876
Somebody must have
taken them the other way.

905
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,538
I think we better go back
to that place we phoned from.

906
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,740
What? That's miles in the wrong direction.

907
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,908
Besides, we can't be certain
they'll be there.

908
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,181
I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.

909
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,755
Wherever they are...

910
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,223
...surely the most sensible thing
is for the two of us to press on.

911
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,523
For all we know, your brother-in-law
may be out or away somewhere.

912
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:51,530
Even if he were the first there,
he still has to find the money.

913
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,568
I earnestly recommend
we forget your good ladies...

914
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,604
...and press on with all possible dispatch.

915
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,401
All right.
We'll press on with all possible dispatch.

916
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:02,238
And I don't really think
that personal rancor...

917
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,745
...is going to help the situation,
if I may say so.

918
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:25,365
Okay, come on, honey.
Let's go. We're here.

919
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:30,062
We got here first. Let's go.
Come on. I got you.

920
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,366
Atta boy, baby.

921
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,407
We made it. We're here first.

922
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,973
Take care of my car
until we get back, right?

923
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:40,081
Come on, let's go. Will you go? Come on!

924
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:47,916
Over there?

925
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,883
There?

926
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:52,183
Down there?

927
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,586
That'll be $2.90.

928
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:30,754
$2.90? Here's $3.00.
Keep the change, but wait for us, okay?

929
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,162
Sure.

930
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,497
Wise guy. Come on, let's go.

931
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,939
-No, we're closed. It's 12:00.
-It's 12:00. They're closed.

932
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,977
Wait a minute!
All we want is a pick and a shovel!

933
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:44,974
Mr. Dinkler's inside.

934
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,981
Dinkler. That's it.
We'll get Dinkler. Come on.

935
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,778
Downstairs. Come on.

936
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,082
They must be here someplace.
Down here, yeah.

937
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,861
Look for a pick and a shovel, all right?

938
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,725
Pick and a shovel,
must be someplace around.

939
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,295
That's all I need.

940
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:08,396
That's all I need, boy.
That's all I need, a pick and a shovel.

941
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:09,436
I found it!

942
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,810
Got it!

943
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,144
-But there--
-I got it! I found it!

944
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:28,052
I've no wish to quarrel with you,
but speaking as a representative...

945
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:31,593
...of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,
I take the most particular exception--

946
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,527
You want me to tell you something?
As far as I'm concerned...

947
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,825
...the whole British race
is practically finished.

948
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,901
If we hadn't kept
your whole country afloat...

949
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,994
...by giving you billions
you never even said thank you for...

950
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:47,132
...the whole phony outfit would be
sunk under the Atlantic years ago.

951
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,712
-What are you stopping for?
-Get out of this machine.

952
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,441
Get out? You're crazy!

953
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,017
It's my machine.
I'll do as I bloody well please. Out!

954
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:59,315
I'm awfully sorry.
I've been very edgy today.

955
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,217
If I said anything about England,
I apologize.

956
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,859
I'm glad to hear you say so.

957
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,124
I must say, if I had the misfortune
to be a citizen of this benighted country...

958
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,292
...I should be most hesitant
in offering any criticism of any other.

959
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,403
Wait a minute.
Are you knocking this country?

960
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,597
Are you saying something
against America?

961
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,704
Against it?

962
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:22,038
I'd be astounded to hear
anything said for it.

963
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,178
The whole bloody place
is the most unspeakable matriarchy...

964
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,771
...in the history of civilization.

965
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:30,818
Look at yourself, the way your wife
and her strumpet of a mother...

966
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,386
...push you through the hoop.

967
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,480
As far as I can see, American men
have been totally emasculated.

968
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:36,717
They're like slaves.

969
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,089
They die like flies
from coronary thrombosis...

970
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:42,220
...while their women sit under hair dryers
eating chocolates...

971
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:46,630
...and arranging for every second Tuesday
to be some sort of Mother's Day.

972
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,466
And this positively infantile preoccupation
with bosoms....

973
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,798
In all my time in this wretched country...

974
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:57,345
...the one thing that has appalled me most
is this preoccupation with bosoms.

975
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,677
They've become the dominant theme
in American culture:

976
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,946
In literature, in advertising,
in entertainment, in everything.

977
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,883
I'll wager you anything you like...

978
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,479
...if American women
stopped wearing brassieres...

979
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:12,117
...your whole national economy
would collapse overnight.

980
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,563
<i>F-7 to Central. The Crumps are locked...</i>

981
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,599
<i>...in the hardware store basement.</i>
<i>Shall I let them out? Over.</i>

982
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:21,295
How could they get locked in a basement?

983
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,961
-We better let them out.
-That ain't fair.

984
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,337
-It ain't fair? What ain't fair?
-They got themselves in there.

985
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,106
They ought to be able
to get themselves out.

986
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:34,910
After all, if you help them,
you're not being fair to the others.

987
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,950
But the moment anybody
gets to where they're going...

988
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,111
...we'll pick them up.

989
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,485
What difference does it make
who gets there first?

990
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,921
It's a race, ain't it?

991
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,685
Why do you want to help that dentist?

992
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:49,059
Me? I've been pulling for that guy Pike
with the furniture van.

993
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,155
The rules should be the same
for everybody.

994
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,097
Otherwise, it just ain't fair.

995
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,106
Central to F-7.

996
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:07,448
No. We'll leave them where they are.
See what happens.

997
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:11,007
Watch all the exits,
but render no assistance. Over.

998
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,289
Are you happy?

999
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:40,877
I need a drink.

1000
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:44,384
There's some ice and stuff back there.
Make us all some Old Fashioneds.

1001
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:46,716
You think you ought to drink
while you're flying?

1002
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,881
Stop kidding and make us some drinks.

1003
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:52,051
Just press the button back there
marked "booze."

1004
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,219
It's the only way to fly.

1005
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:15,414
Estimated speed 175.
We'll never be able to keep up with him.

1006
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:19,046
Better have some of the other units
intercept. Over.

1007
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,188
Hello, Ginger? What's the matter now?

1008
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,294
<i>It</i>'<i>s Billie Sue. Her new boyfriend Oscar...</i>

1009
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,795
<i>...was supposed to come down</i>
<i>from Pomona just to meet us.</i>

1010
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:34,096
<i>-So now she told him we were going away.</i>
-What? What's the matter?

1011
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:37,999
<i>You keep forgetting.</i>
<i>If a girl is 6 feet 5 inches tall...</i>

1012
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,301
<i>...she</i>'<i>s bound to have special problems.</i>

1013
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,343
-But, Ginger--
<i>-They had some argument...</i>

1014
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:43,411
Get out!

1015
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:46,538
<i>...screaming at each other.</i>
<i>Now the whole engagement</i>'<i>s off...</i>

1016
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,309
<i>...and she says she</i>'<i>s leaving.</i>

1017
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,748
Leaving what? Leaving home?

1018
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,955
-Let me talk to her. Get her to the phone.
<i>-I</i>'<i>ll try. Just a minute.</i>

1019
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:58,720
<i>-Talk to your father.</i>
<i>-I won</i>'<i>t. I don</i>'<i>t want to talk to him ever.</i>

1020
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:02,662
<i>Don</i>'<i>t be ridiculous.</i>
<i>Whatever else he is, he is your father.</i>

1021
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,359
You hear bells, baby?

1022
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:14,969
Yes?

1023
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,005
<i>-Who is that?</i>
-Who's that?

1024
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:19,798
I want my son!

1025
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:25,973
Who is that?
I want to speak to Sylvester Marcus.

1026
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:29,145
-Sylvester?
-Yeah, baby?

1027
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:30,841
It's your mom.

1028
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,891
Good old Mom. Hello!

1029
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,619
-Sylvester?
<i>-Is that you, Mom?</i>

1030
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:42,288
Of course it's me.
I've been trying you all morning.

1031
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,499
I've been a little busy.

1032
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,996
I've been working
and I didn't hear the phone.

1033
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,070
Hold on a minute, will you, Mom?

1034
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,833
Baby, how about a beer or something?
Man, I feel like--

1035
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,172
Will you listen? Something's happened.

1036
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,275
<i>There was an accident this morning.</i>
<i>A man got killedl</i>

1037
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:00,974
Who got killed?

1038
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,812
<i>-Now, listenl</i>
-You all right?

1039
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,442
<i>-Pay attentionl</i>
-Sis all right?

1040
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,248
<i>-Will you listen?</i>
-What's wrong?

1041
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:07,754
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1042
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,751
There's a whole fortune in cash.

1043
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,122
You can get it before anybody else,
but you've got to hurry!

1044
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:16,455
What's the matter?
What's going on there? Are you all right?

1045
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,566
Of course I'm all right.

1046
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,763
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?

1047
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:24,838
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?

1048
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,337
What's going on? Where's Russell?

1049
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,237
Don't even mention Russell!

1050
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:32,745
-When I tell you what Russell did--
-Just tell him about the dough.

1051
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,509
Keep out of this! Shut up!

1052
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,282
<i>-Don</i>'<i>t talk. Just listen.</i>
-What did Russell do?

1053
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:41,219
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.

1054
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,551
He and this Englishman I don't even know!

1055
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,089
Who's with you and where are you?

1056
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:49,922
I'm with this truck driver
in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.

1057
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:52,863
Will you shut up a minute
so I can tell you what happened?

1058
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:57,462
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.

1059
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:58,740
Shut up and listen!

1060
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,073
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.

1061
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,906
Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.

1062
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,746
I'm coming.
Everything's going to be all right.

1063
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:12,911
Well?

1064
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,757
So he's coming here,
and I'm not to worry about a thing.

1065
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,891
Because everything is going to be all right.

1066
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:26,391
Exactly like your father:
a big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!

1067
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,160
The burglar alarm.

1068
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,868
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come, and we're out.

1069
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,738
Don't be frightened
if it makes a big bell noise.

1070
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:37,675
Okay? All right? Here we go.

1071
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:46,009
-I don't hear anything.
-Neither do I. There's no bell.

1072
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,024
Look at it. It just stands there.

1073
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,762
Wait a minute.

1074
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,894
Stand back.

1075
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:16,613
Burglar alarm!

1076
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:19,016
The stupidest burglar in the world
could come in...

1077
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:22,488
...and walk away with everything,
and we can't even get out.

1078
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,191
Come here!

1079
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,673
Even if you do get the bell to ring
and somebody comes...

1080
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,333
...what about the damage?

1081
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,140
They're the ones who locked us in!

1082
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,753
This thing has got to work.

1083
01:19:58,026 --> 01:19:59,015
No!

1084
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,663
Please, help me! I'm frying!
Please! Help me!

1085
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:19,576
Don't make them so sweet this time.

1086
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,809
You've had two already.
Can't you wait till we're on the ground?

1087
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,546
What are you talking about?
I'll make the next batch.

1088
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,121
You take the controls.

1089
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:30,851
-I don't know how to fly an airplane.
-There's really nothing to it.

1090
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:35,328
-But Benjy can't fly!
-That's nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.

1091
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:38,796
I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.

1092
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,698
That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.

1093
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,737
There you are, feet on the rudder.

1094
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:47,035
Who says this boy can't fly a plane?
There you go.

1095
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,766
I'm making an Old Fashioned
the old-fashioned way...

1096
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,937
...the way dear old Dad used to.

1097
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,705
What if something happens?

1098
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,841
What can happen
to an Old Fashioned, all right?

1099
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:02,320
I know you don't know what to do,
so don't do nothing.

1100
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:06,360
-I won't do nothing.
-That boy's a natural-born flyer.

1101
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,536
Wait a minute. Ease back on her!

1102
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,540
-I'm easing.
-Ease back a little!

1103
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:25,807
-I'm trying my best.
-All kidding aside--

1104
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,842
I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...

1105
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:32,678
...nervous!
We've got an accident back here!

1106
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,118
-What happened?
-I don't know!

1107
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:44,823
It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.

1108
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:47,025
In the name of reason,
pull yourself together.

1109
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,601
You were 10 feet over the line.

1110
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:31,979
So it's fisticuffs you want, is it?
Right. Stick them up!

1111
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,207
-No! No!
-Come here, you coward!

1112
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:35,815
No! Don't hit me!

1113
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:38,249
-Stop, you!
-Don't hit me!

1114
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:45,583
-Blood.
-It certainly is.

1115
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,826
Come back here, you blimey....

1116
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,567
You want to play it dirty? Okay!

1117
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:01,902
Foul!

1118
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,034
You're not much good...

1119
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,671
...without that horrible
mother-in-law of yours, are you?

1120
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,782
Come on. Fight!

1121
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:13,445
You thought you had me, didn't you?

1122
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,278
I'll kill you. I swear!

1123
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:19,421
No, stop, please! No, please.

1124
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,970
-Hello. Hello there.
-Don't shut the motor off!

1125
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:39,410
I'm not shutting anything off!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?

1126
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:43,142
-I can hear you!
-I don't care if you hear me!

1127
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,677
-I don't know whether we're on the air.
-Mayday. Call mayday!

1128
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,953
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help!

1129
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,085
-Benjy, say something.
-Help!

1130
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,863
Hello? Billie Sue?

1131
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,898
-Billie Sue, where are you?
<i>-I</i>'<i>m at the bus station.</i>

1132
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,335
<i>I only called because</i>
<i>Mommy said I absolutely--</i>

1133
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:08,505
Sweetie, what are you doing
in the bus station?

1134
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,578
<i>I</i>'<i>m waiting for the bus.</i>

1135
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,073
Your wife's on the other phone.

1136
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:17,645
Ginger?
I've got Billie Sue on the other line.

1137
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:20,243
Billie Sue, wait one minute, will you?

1138
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,516
-Ginger?
<i>-I</i>'<i>m here.</i>

1139
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:25,252
Can you hear Billie Sue? She's crying.

1140
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:30,254
She's in the bus station and she's crying,
but she's waiting for you to tell her.

1141
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,866
<i>-Billie Suel</i>
-Are you listening?

1142
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:37,493
-Are you listening to your mother?
<i>-Your mother is speaking.</i>

1143
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:40,506
-Listen to your mother, sweetie.
<i>-Billie Suel</i>

1144
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:43,235
Billie Sue! Listen to your mother!

1145
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:51,042
Everything that's happened
to my daughter and me today...

1146
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,178
...only happened for one reason:
because you were too stupid...

1147
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:57,156
...to look where you were going,
and wrecked our car!

1148
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:58,486
Yeah?

1149
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,062
You either get out of that truck
or I'm going to throw you out.

1150
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,799
Don't get upset.

1151
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:17,435
You're not going to do anything.
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.

1152
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:22,649
Mommy, don't worry.
Your baby's coming to save you!

1153
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,250
Mr. Pike, please!

1154
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:33,691
-Let me go! Get away from me!
-That isn't nice a bit!

1155
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,422
Mother!

1156
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:52,675
That's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, to save you.

1157
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:55,649
Help me!

1158
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,378
Emmeline!

1159
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,320
Yeah, yeah.

1160
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:05,915
It's practically burned through.

1161
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:08,996
Just a couple blows
with the sledgehammer and we're out.

1162
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:35,645
Wait a minute!

1163
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,183
I can't cross here!

1164
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:41,921
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

1165
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,798
All right, look. You're a little boy.

1166
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:48,196
If you want to be a big boy,
which way to the main road?

1167
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:56,844
Don't!

1168
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:58,579
Don't!

1169
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,144
It's no! The answer is no.

1170
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:05,147
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

1171
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,780
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?

1172
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,721
Because they got a solid majority...

1173
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:13,055
...of Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

1174
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:17,460
...that if anything is said about pensions,
they'll actually reduce your pension!

1175
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:20,329
Why? Because they know
that you personally...

1176
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:24,201
...were more responsible than anybody else
for closing down the houses.

1177
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:26,933
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?

1178
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,377
All right. So you're an honest cop...

1179
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:33,038
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop...

1180
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,843
...and you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

1181
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:38,244
It's no good saying I'm sorry.

1182
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,616
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach
to be sorry.

1183
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:46,023
<i>You</i>'<i>re not listening to what I</i>'<i>m saying.</i>
<i>That</i>'<i>s the trouble with this family.</i>

1184
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,296
Melville, I smell something burning.

1185
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,495
We're on fire! Come over here.

1186
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,798
Come on. This way. Go down. Now. Go.

1187
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:03,337
Hurry up!

1188
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:05,569
Put it out!

1189
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,148
I don't know how! Get something!

1190
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:10,342
-The extinguishers.
-Get one!

1191
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,716
-What'll I do?
-Use it!

1192
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,482
Not on me! On the fire!

1193
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:16,851
It's too deep!

1194
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:18,457
This is a car, not a canoe!

1195
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,658
Come on! It's easy!

1196
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,763
If I don't get out of here...Why? Why?

1197
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,960
All right! Here I come!

1198
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,303
It's too deep!

1199
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,874
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

1200
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:40,310
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I....

1201
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:43,145
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't....

1202
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,452
This is no place for a convertible!

1203
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:49,887
I'll get you.

1204
01:28:58,066 --> 01:29:00,432
I'm bleeding, Emmeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!

1205
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:03,536
Mama! What did they do to my Mama?

1206
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:22,448
Benjy!

1207
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:29,929
<i>It</i>'<i>s your father</i>'<i>s fault.</i>

1208
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,692
<i>-The whole thing is your father</i>'<i>s fault.</i>
<i>-Mommy.</i>

1209
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,699
<i>It</i>'<i>s your father</i>'<i>s fault.</i>

1210
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:37,737
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?

1211
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:40,899
<i>-You know as well as I do--</i>
<i>-Listen to me and stop yellingl</i>

1212
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,498
<i>Stop it, Billie.</i>

1213
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,407
<i>Billie, you</i>'<i>re not listening.</i>

1214
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,036
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1215
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:14,237
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.

1216
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,982
And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

1217
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:20,879
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1218
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,370
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

1219
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:45,707
-You know I hate explosions.
-It's perfectly all right.

1220
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:49,476
I just want to blow a small hole in the wall,
then we'll be out of here.

1221
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,320
Something's happened to the fuse.

1222
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:05,859
-What could possibly--
-Hold it.

1223
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,460
Listen.

1224
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:11,337
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

1225
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:15,602
-Stay down. Don't get up.
-I just want to take a look, okay?

1226
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:21,945
Now I see.

1227
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,577
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

1228
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:28,416
The fire extinguisher stuff got on the fuse
and put it out.

1229
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:30,820
Melville, don't go in there. You'll be killed.

1230
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:34,361
-You'll be blown to bits.
-Monica, for heaven's sake.

1231
01:35:34,462 --> 01:35:36,987
I just want to take a look!

1232
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:42,934
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

1233
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,197
Don't you think I got any sense at all?

1234
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,302
Why can't you have
a little confidence in me?

1235
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,612
-I'll never be bad again!
-Whoever said you could fly?

1236
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:31,844
What do ya want from me?
How long I been flying?

1237
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:34,318
-Keep it going!
-Can't you talk to that radio?

1238
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:37,015
Hello, anybody on the ground!
On the ground, anybody!

1239
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:38,352
Can you hear us?

1240
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:53,606
-Stand back!
-Everybody, stand back.

1241
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,501
Stand back, folks. Folks, stand back.

1242
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,749
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Do you hear me?

1243
01:37:05,853 --> 01:37:08,822
-We don't know who they are.
-This is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1244
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:12,950
<i>Aircraft calling Rancho Conejo Tower,</i>
<i>this is Rancho Conejo Tower.</i>

1245
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,958
I got 'em!

1246
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:17,690
I got 'em!
Hello, down there on the ground.

1247
01:37:17,798 --> 01:37:20,164
This is us in the air. We're in trouble!

1248
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:23,100
An awful jam. Listen. Hello?

1249
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:25,162
I think I lost them.

1250
01:37:25,272 --> 01:37:27,740
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>You</i>'<i>re not using the set the right way.</i>

1251
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:31,608
<i>You press your switch in to transmit.</i>
<i>When it</i>'<i>s released, you</i>'<i>re on receive.</i>

1252
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,644
<i>Can you understand me?</i>
<i>This is Rancho Conejo Tower.</i>

1253
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:38,876
<i>-Where are you and who are you? Over.</i>
-I know how to work it, Benjy!

1254
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:41,819
I know how to work it.
Hello, down on the ground.

1255
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:43,651
This is us in the air.

1256
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,588
We're in this fella's plane.

1257
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:47,621
He knocked himself out...

1258
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:51,391
...because he drank a whole case
of bourbon and hit his head.

1259
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:52,896
What do we do?

1260
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:55,498
The switch, let go of the switch!

1261
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:58,167
<i>If you can, give us your position.</i>

1262
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,137
<i>Who</i>'<i>s flying the plane? Over.</i>

1263
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,241
Whaddya mean, "Who's flying the plane?"

1264
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:05,811
Nobody's flying the plane!

1265
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,375
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.

1266
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,746
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1267
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:14,412
Full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1268
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:17,012
It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.

1269
01:38:17,124 --> 01:38:19,888
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.

1270
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:23,259
He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.

1271
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,059
Now listen. Don't talk, just listen.

1272
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,066
We're getting things under control,
so you can take it easy.

1273
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,864
We know what kind of a plane you're in.

1274
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,405
We're making necessary preparations
to talk you down.

1275
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:34,872
Rancho Conejo over.

1276
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:38,240
<i>Rancho Conejo tower, listen,</i>
<i>we can</i>'<i>t land this thingl</i>

1277
01:38:38,345 --> 01:38:40,176
<i>We</i>'<i>re in real trouble. Overl</i>

1278
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:43,845
You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1279
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:47,312
The man at the controls should
also be the man on the radio.

1280
01:38:48,822 --> 01:38:51,814
-Here. Put 'em on.
-No. I don't want to!

1281
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:53,323
Put 'em on!

1282
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,089
He said the fella flying
should be on this thing.

1283
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:59,324
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?

1284
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:01,457
What are you? The hostess?

1285
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:05,332
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?

1286
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,430
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

1287
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:11,010
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

1288
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:14,274
-He didn't want to be disturbed.
-He keeps looking at the wall.

1289
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:17,111
He'll have to be disturbed
if any of this develops further.

1290
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:21,449
I bet you any amount of money
that we could get on the ball and get....

1291
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:25,624
Everything's under control, Chief.

1292
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:29,662
-You okay, Chief?
-Yes. Why?

1293
01:39:30,397 --> 01:39:32,831
-How's it going?
-Something's bound to happen soon.

1294
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,264
Take a look at this.

1295
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:36,802
Those two in the basement started a fire...

1296
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:39,462
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

1297
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:42,374
<i>Those two guys in the airplane</i>
<i>had an accident...</i>

1298
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:43,999
<i>...knocked the pilot unconscious.</i>

1299
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:46,909
<i>The control tower</i>
<i>is trying to talk them down.</i>

1300
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,211
<i>The others....</i>

1301
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,112
<i>Aerial report that the man,</i>
<i>Otto Meyer, had an accident.</i>

1302
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,780
<i>He tried to cross a river and he lost his car.</i>

1303
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:58,585
<i>Now he</i>'<i>s on foot,</i>
<i>walking back to the main road.</i>

1304
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,193
<i>This fella Pike, he</i>'<i>s here...</i>

1305
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:05,662
<i>...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus</i>
<i>and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.</i>

1306
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:10,932
<i>Mr. Finch and this Algernon,</i>
<i>whatever his name is. The limey.</i>

1307
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:13,569
<i>They</i>'<i>re about five or six miles behind...</i>

1308
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:16,165
<i>...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented</i>
<i>in Canyon City.</i>

1309
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:19,105
<i>And this Sylvester Marcus,</i>
<i>the one the old lady called...</i>

1310
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:21,738
<i>...he</i>'<i>s about here going</i>
<i>in the other direction.</i>

1311
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:27,016
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five minutes.

1312
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:44,728
You know what I believe I'd like?

1313
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:51,676
A chocolate fudge sundae
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1314
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:11,257
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.

1315
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:13,993
<i>Men, this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.</i>

1316
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:17,865
<i>These gentlemen here have asked me</i>
<i>to take charge of this situation...</i>

1317
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:22,101
<i>...so I immediately said</i>
<i>that I</i>'<i>d be glad to take charge of it.</i>

1318
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:26,641
<i>-Before I say anything else....</i>
-I don't think he's going to help us, Dingy.

1319
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:28,806
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

1320
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:32,079
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

1321
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:34,083
Steady, men.

1322
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:37,419
I'm told that neither of you
has had flying experience.

1323
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:39,389
Before I say anything else...

1324
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:42,929
...I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

1325
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:44,790
...so far.

1326
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:49,128
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

1327
01:41:49,236 --> 01:41:52,865
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1328
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:58,034
And you can't make your approach
until you've made a long slow turnaround...

1329
01:41:58,145 --> 01:41:59,669
...down to the south.

1330
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,908
And we've got to be clear on a few things
before you can start that long slow turn.

1331
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:10,283
Now, the stick that you're holding,
that is, I assume that....

1332
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,389
Men, are you holding that stick?

1333
01:42:12,526 --> 01:42:14,460
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!

1334
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:17,689
<i>What stick? The wheel. I</i>'<i>m holding it.</i>

1335
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:20,192
<i>-We</i>'<i>re both holding it.</i>
-Good.

1336
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:23,667
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.

1337
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:27,171
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.

1338
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:30,072
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might....

1339
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:53,499
-You want a lift?
-Yes, thank you very much.

1340
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:55,727
It's nice of you to stop.

1341
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:58,828
-I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
-That's out of my way.

1342
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:00,372
-We're blocking traffic.
-We are?

1343
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,338
Let's move it. Move it.

1344
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,113
There we go. All right.

1345
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,494
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.

1346
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:25,894
Melville, will you just do one thing for me
before you use the dynamite?

1347
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:28,297
Try hitting the door just once more.

1348
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:32,896
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean....

1349
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:37,568
Okay.

1350
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,437
Where's the sledgehammer?

1351
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:51,723
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.

1352
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:53,185
Please?

1353
01:43:55,629 --> 01:43:56,926
All right.

1354
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:09,839
You're going to....

1355
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:20,876
Melville, for God....

1356
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:22,382
Melville!

1357
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:26,756
Monica...

1358
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:29,495
...now let's forget about the door.

1359
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:35,190
Look out!

1360
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:37,394
-What?
-They've spotted us.

1361
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:39,597
-Who have?
-Don't stop. Keep going.

1362
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:41,799
-What is this?
-Helicopter. They've seen us.

1363
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:43,239
What helicopter?

1364
01:44:45,545 --> 01:44:49,003
-That's a police helicopter.
-They always use them.

1365
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:50,947
-Who?
-Who do you think?

1366
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:54,850
I don't want to talk about this,
but they got me hemmed in.

1367
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:56,889
-Who?
-Will you shut up and listen?

1368
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:00,892
I'm going to break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

1369
01:45:00,994 --> 01:45:03,861
This is a matter of life or death,
a desperate situation.

1370
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,398
-What is?
-Will you shut up and listen?

1371
01:45:06,533 --> 01:45:09,434
Look, I haven't got much time,
so if you love your country...

1372
01:45:09,536 --> 01:45:12,164
...if you're a patriot, you'll listen,
and listen hard.

1373
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:14,172
You gotta get to a phone and make a call.

1374
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:16,299
-I don't got--
-You got to call Intelligence.

1375
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:18,401
Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington, D.C.

1376
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:20,377
-What on earth--
-Now, listen!

1377
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:24,046
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1378
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:27,678
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today.

1379
01:45:27,788 --> 01:45:29,517
They tried to drown me.

1380
01:45:29,623 --> 01:45:31,853
Can you handle a gun? Now, look....

1381
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:34,688
There's a cafe. Pull right in there.
You'll use that phone.

1382
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:37,092
-I don't think l--
-Shut up! You're in no danger.

1383
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:38,925
They've never seen ya. Now, pull in.

1384
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,173
All right, good. Get to a phone.

1385
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:51,711
Tell the operator "emergency priority,"
then ask for the CIA.

1386
01:45:51,812 --> 01:45:53,837
Jump out. Come on, come on.

1387
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:55,915
You're in no danger. They don't know you.

1388
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:58,814
You're all right.
I'll duck the car and come back.

1389
01:45:58,919 --> 01:46:00,887
For God's sake, don't stand in the street.

1390
01:46:00,987 --> 01:46:02,614
They'll see you. They'll spot you!

1391
01:46:02,723 --> 01:46:05,021
Move it. Go!

1392
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,102
Sylvester! It's Sylvester!

1393
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,505
Turn around, you idiot!

1394
01:46:22,609 --> 01:46:25,305
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.

1395
01:46:25,412 --> 01:46:28,006
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.

1396
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:45,720
They're nuts.

1397
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:49,165
Tell them the tow truck turned around
and is following the Dodge.

1398
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:51,998
<i>2-1-7-1, 2-1-5-9.</i>

1399
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:54,701
This is stupid.

1400
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:56,732
You call me a stupid idiot.

1401
01:46:56,843 --> 01:46:59,141
Let me tell you something.
You're a stupid idiot.

1402
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:03,239
-He'll go all the way to Plaster City.
-So he goes to Plaster City.

1403
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:06,046
I don't know about you,
but I'm turning this thing around.

1404
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:09,316
Now, you want to catch him,
you get out and run.

1405
01:47:29,342 --> 01:47:31,037
Let's stop arguing. Please.

1406
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:33,976
The reason we're together
is because they only had one car.

1407
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,571
Let's get there, even if we are last.

1408
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:41,419
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...

1409
01:47:41,521 --> 01:47:43,512
...when I wasn't even looking.

1410
01:47:43,824 --> 01:47:44,791
Yeah.

1411
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:55,091
Russell!

1412
01:48:08,415 --> 01:48:12,408
-How can you be so slow?
-I've had just about enough out of you.

1413
01:48:12,519 --> 01:48:14,350
If ya turned quicker we coulda caught him!

1414
01:48:14,454 --> 01:48:17,480
-Why don't you shut up?
-Russell! There!

1415
01:48:17,591 --> 01:48:19,582
It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!

1416
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:20,921
Stop them! Catch them!

1417
01:48:21,027 --> 01:48:22,460
We gonna start that again?

1418
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:25,122
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!

1419
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:26,960
What do you want them for anyway?

1420
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:29,159
Keep up with them. You're falling behind.

1421
01:48:29,269 --> 01:48:31,829
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvester!

1422
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:35,635
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

1423
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:42,573
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

1424
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,549
It's probably some road hog
who thinks he owns....

1425
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:47,084
-What?
-What?

1426
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:50,156
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!

1427
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,924
-It's my brother-in-law.
-What's he doing?

1428
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,751
Be careful of him. He's not normal.

1429
01:48:56,897 --> 01:48:59,457
You're getting me--
Boy, are you bugging me, man!

1430
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:03,558
I'm going to nail...l'm getting bugged now!

1431
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:04,670
Whoa, man.

1432
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:10,669
Russell, if you don't pull over, I'll kill you!
I'm warning you, pull over and stop.

1433
01:49:10,777 --> 01:49:12,176
I said stop!

1434
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:13,837
You asked for it.

1435
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:24,315
Russell, when I get my hands on you....

1436
01:49:24,524 --> 01:49:26,082
What are you doing?

1437
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,122
-I said stop!
-Are you crazy?

1438
01:49:28,228 --> 01:49:30,196
-We'll get killed!
-Pull over!

1439
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:44,041
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!

1440
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:52,747
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

1441
01:50:12,038 --> 01:50:13,505
Are you crazy?

1442
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:24,712
I've never seen anything like this bunch.

1443
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:27,579
He ran right into them,
ran them right off the road.

1444
01:50:28,822 --> 01:50:32,519
-You guys, come on out of there!
-Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

1445
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:35,127
-What are you trying to do?
-Let's go!

1446
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:37,695
-What did you do to my mother?
-We wouldn't do any--

1447
01:50:38,765 --> 01:50:39,925
Move! Move!

1448
01:50:40,033 --> 01:50:43,434
-What did you do to my mother?
-I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

1449
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:45,000
Look here.

1450
01:50:45,872 --> 01:50:47,430
She called me. She phoned me.

1451
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:50,270
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!

1452
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:52,504
-It was true, wasn't it?
-It's not true.

1453
01:50:52,612 --> 01:50:54,876
Whoever told you was a liar. It's not true.

1454
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:57,711
-It is true!
-Now, look here!

1455
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:01,380
Are you English? Just answer me!

1456
01:51:01,521 --> 01:51:05,116
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?

1457
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:09,626
There was an Englishman.

1458
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:12,721
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!

1459
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,964
What did you do to my Mama?

1460
01:51:17,137 --> 01:51:18,968
-Emmeline!
-Mama!

1461
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:22,007
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...

1462
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:24,235
...when I was trying to tell you to listen?

1463
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:26,707
That chap's run absolutely amok!

1464
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:29,939
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.

1465
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:32,883
In a couple of minutes,
we'll have you in position.

1466
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:35,420
-You're doing a great job, Colonel.
-Thank you.

1467
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:37,683
Why not just shoot 'em down?

1468
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:40,688
None of these people must suspect...

1469
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:44,125
...that they have ever been
under observation.

1470
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:47,627
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

1471
01:51:47,901 --> 01:51:49,368
None of them know me...

1472
01:51:49,602 --> 01:51:52,230
...so I'll be moving in alone.

1473
01:51:53,573 --> 01:51:56,542
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1474
01:51:56,643 --> 01:51:58,611
And when you pass the word...

1475
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:03,338
...I don't want to have another policeman
within miles of me.

1476
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,815
-Right?
-Right.

1477
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:12,381
I won't like it if I see another policeman.

1478
01:52:14,427 --> 01:52:15,519
I give you my word.

1479
01:52:15,628 --> 01:52:19,155
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.

1480
01:52:19,299 --> 01:52:21,665
Tell him how my mother-in-law
made us drive by him.

1481
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:24,134
Anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law...

1482
01:52:24,237 --> 01:52:25,704
...you don't have to explain to me.

1483
01:52:25,839 --> 01:52:26,965
You know what I mean?

1484
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:30,099
If she were a star
of a real crummy horror movie...

1485
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:31,575
...l'd believe it.

1486
01:52:33,613 --> 01:52:34,580
Yeah!

1487
01:52:34,681 --> 01:52:35,670
That's him!

1488
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:39,081
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

1489
01:52:39,185 --> 01:52:40,880
You dirty robber!

1490
01:52:41,488 --> 01:52:42,819
Someone you know?

1491
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:00,603
I'll drive. All set?

1492
01:53:00,707 --> 01:53:02,004
All set, Chief.

1493
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:04,032
Culpeper, all set?

1494
01:53:04,377 --> 01:53:08,177
<i>Yes, sir. Airport just reported</i>
<i>and they</i>'<i>re starting an approach now.</i>

1495
01:53:08,348 --> 01:53:09,406
Right.

1496
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:20,417
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?

1497
01:53:22,328 --> 01:53:24,592
No. I don't think I've forgotten a thing.

1498
01:53:36,509 --> 01:53:40,878
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.

1499
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:44,074
I'll tell you in just a minute.
Just hold it a second.

1500
01:53:45,285 --> 01:53:47,446
What the hell is with this wire?

1501
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:49,484
Just hold it a second.

1502
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:51,356
What was that?

1503
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:52,424
Men, look.

1504
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:57,090
<i>Be calm. This is it.</i>
<i>Just one minute more, it</i>'<i>ll be all over.</i>

1505
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:59,721
<i>I mean, it</i>'<i>ll all be over.</i>
<i>I mean, courage, men.</i>

1506
01:53:59,866 --> 01:54:02,960
<i>We</i>'<i>re all with you every second.</i>

1507
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:05,832
<i>We</i>'<i>re pulling for you as hard as we can.</i>

1508
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:10,706
<i>Now it</i>'<i>s just hold onto your nerves, men,</i>
<i>and not get excited or do anything foolish.</i>

1509
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:13,108
<i>But just keep calm. That</i>'<i>s all we</i>'<i>ll do.</i>

1510
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:15,476
<i>Keep calm. Calm, menl</i>

1511
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:21,150
Not that calm, you idiot!

1512
01:54:25,758 --> 01:54:27,589
Pull up!

1513
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,437
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

1514
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:46,378
What's this? What's this that's coming?

1515
01:54:46,679 --> 01:54:50,740
-That's good. That's cement.
-What? Wait a minute! Hold it!

1516
01:54:51,384 --> 01:54:53,375
What are you doing, Benjy?

1517
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:01,451
-What, are you trying to scare me?
-No!

1518
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:03,027
Well, you did.

1519
01:55:05,498 --> 01:55:08,661
It's just a couple of sticks of dynamite,
that's all.

1520
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:12,234
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

1521
01:55:12,605 --> 01:55:14,368
Get it over right! Get it over!

1522
01:55:14,574 --> 01:55:15,632
Left rudder!

1523
01:55:15,942 --> 01:55:17,739
Too low! Pull up.

1524
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:19,368
No! Left rudder!

1525
01:55:19,479 --> 01:55:22,607
No! Pull it up!

1526
01:55:22,815 --> 01:55:23,873
Help!

1527
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,551
Help! I'm the Colonel, you know!

1528
01:55:29,722 --> 01:55:30,780
Help!

1529
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:32,619
Help! Get me down!

1530
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:38,427
We're not going to land
and we'll never make it.

1531
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:42,092
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.

1532
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:44,133
Benjy, don't freeze.

1533
01:55:48,308 --> 01:55:49,798
This one's going to work.

1534
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:52,137
-Damn it, come to!
-You hit me.

1535
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:54,713
Listen, wait a minute.

1536
01:56:01,421 --> 01:56:02,752
We're down!

1537
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:04,953
-We're on the ground.
-Hooray!

1538
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:08,089
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

1539
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:13,990
Put on the brakes.

1540
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:15,464
Okay. Where are they?

1541
01:56:15,735 --> 01:56:17,669
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!

1542
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:26,876
We've landed! Come on.

1543
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:35,810
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up.

1544
01:56:36,089 --> 01:56:38,148
-Come on, let's go.
-What about him?

1545
01:56:38,257 --> 01:56:40,350
Never mind him. An ambulance will come.

1546
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:42,223
Let's get out of here.

1547
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:46,064
Cab!

1548
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:48,224
Cab!

1549
01:56:49,802 --> 01:56:52,737
We're in an awful hurry.
Do you know where the State Park is?

1550
01:56:52,872 --> 01:56:54,863
Sure. What happened?

1551
01:56:54,974 --> 01:56:56,737
Emergency landing. Come on, hurry.

1552
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:58,640
Quick, let's go. Come on.

1553
01:56:58,745 --> 01:57:00,178
Come on, Benjy.

1554
01:57:13,993 --> 01:57:15,290
Excuse me.

1555
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:22,131
Excuse us. Here's your bag.

1556
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:26,102
You see, the lock didn't work.

1557
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:27,628
Go.

1558
01:57:27,774 --> 01:57:30,971
That's all.
The owners will pay for everything.

1559
01:57:31,277 --> 01:57:33,575
Next door, he'll pay for everything.
It's okay.

1560
01:57:42,255 --> 01:57:43,779
You people. You!

1561
01:57:43,923 --> 01:57:45,948
Come back here. Come back!

1562
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:47,754
You vandals!

1563
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:51,255
The cops in this town
are morons, retarded.

1564
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:53,631
I'm dealing with moronic people.

1565
01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:56,133
'Cause he's in a bad humor, that fat Nazi.

1566
01:57:56,235 --> 01:57:57,896
What, I gotta suffer 'cause of him?

1567
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:00,598
Get away from me. What's the matter?

1568
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:05,200
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Gimme two minutes!

1569
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:06,903
Now, listen, Sy....

1570
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:09,946
Will you take us
to Santa Rosita State Park?

1571
01:58:10,183 --> 01:58:12,777
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?

1572
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:14,750
We had an accident. Hurry up!

1573
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:20,324
<i>Benjamin and Bell stopped at a gardener</i>
<i>supply place and bought picks and shovels.</i>

1574
01:58:20,426 --> 01:58:23,020
<i>Hold it, Chief.</i>
<i>Here</i>'<i>s a report on the Crumps.</i>

1575
01:58:23,162 --> 01:58:27,565
<i>Their cab turned onto 101 moving south</i>
<i>toward your present position.</i>

1576
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:31,830
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>The other taxi</i>'<i>s also turning onto 101...</i>

1577
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:35,032
<i>...and they</i>'<i>re moving north.</i>
<i>They</i>'<i>re both coming your way.</i>

1578
01:58:35,141 --> 01:58:36,073
Understood.

1579
01:58:36,375 --> 01:58:37,603
Stand by.

1580
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:40,107
They ought to be here any minute.

1581
01:59:04,637 --> 01:59:05,626
Look.

1582
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:09,469
It's the two idiots, the little one
and the one with the marbles in his mouth.

1583
01:59:09,642 --> 01:59:11,940
-It's that hokey dentist.
-Yeah.

1584
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:13,807
Pass that cab.

1585
01:59:13,913 --> 01:59:15,642
-What's the rush?
-Whaddaya mean "rush"?

1586
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:17,909
No rush. We're just in a hurry.

1587
01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:27,957
Culpeper.

1588
01:59:28,394 --> 01:59:29,383
Now.

1589
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,793
Give the order to pull away.

1590
01:59:38,237 --> 01:59:40,671
-Come on. Hurry up.
-Shouldn't I wait around?

1591
01:59:40,773 --> 01:59:41,762
No. Here's $5.

1592
01:59:41,908 --> 01:59:45,469
-What's with the pick and shovel?
-Mind your own business. Come on.

1593
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:53,619
-Think anybody is here?
-Didn't see any cars.

1594
01:59:53,719 --> 01:59:55,346
Wait a minute!

1595
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:58,413
-Let's talk this over.
-I got nothing to talk about.

1596
01:59:58,524 --> 02:00:00,185
Wait a minute.

1597
02:00:00,326 --> 02:00:01,759
Think anybody else has been here?

1598
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:04,056
-How should I know?
-Wait!

1599
02:00:04,297 --> 02:00:07,095
If you think we're the first ones here,
why not make a deal?

1600
02:00:07,233 --> 02:00:08,200
The four of us?

1601
02:00:08,334 --> 02:00:10,734
Nobody knows where to look,
so we'll look together.

1602
02:00:10,836 --> 02:00:15,170
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?

1603
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:18,772
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

1604
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,538
What happened to you?

1605
02:00:23,282 --> 02:00:25,910
They're up to something funny, you hear?

1606
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:29,986
Did you see the blonde I brought,
covered in paint with her dress ripped?

1607
02:00:30,122 --> 02:00:31,749
What's that all about?

1608
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:34,985
Yeah. And what about
the picks and shovels?

1609
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:47,796
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

1610
02:00:47,907 --> 02:00:51,809
-Let me come, Chief.
-I'd like to, but it might snarl things up.

1611
02:00:52,878 --> 02:00:54,641
Thanks for everything.

1612
02:00:54,947 --> 02:00:56,710
Lots of luck, Chief.

1613
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:34,476
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

1614
02:01:34,587 --> 02:01:37,522
No, but there must be
something somewhere.

1615
02:01:41,193 --> 02:01:42,888
-See anything?
-Not a thing.

1616
02:01:42,995 --> 02:01:46,226
Are you sure he didn't say
something you've forgotten?

1617
02:01:46,365 --> 02:01:50,028
He said it's buried under a big W
and that we'd see it.

1618
02:01:50,202 --> 02:01:52,500
-It's gotta be here.
-I tell you what we do.

1619
02:01:52,605 --> 02:01:54,903
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.

1620
02:01:55,007 --> 02:01:57,339
We might have missed something. Hold it.

1621
02:01:58,477 --> 02:02:00,274
You go the way we came....

1622
02:02:00,513 --> 02:02:02,413
That's right. Okay, let's go.

1623
02:02:10,089 --> 02:02:12,614
They're looking for something
buried under a big W.

1624
02:02:12,725 --> 02:02:15,523
I heard one of them, the stutterer, say it.

1625
02:02:15,628 --> 02:02:17,493
Yeah, I heard. But what?

1626
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:09,078
Did you see anything?

1627
02:03:09,181 --> 02:03:10,546
-No. Did you?
-Nothing.

1628
02:03:10,649 --> 02:03:13,277
That guy hid it so good,
he couldn't find it himself.

1629
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:14,353
I think--

1630
02:03:24,597 --> 02:03:25,791
Who's he?

1631
02:03:25,931 --> 02:03:28,627
-I don't know.
-But he had a shovel.

1632
02:03:28,801 --> 02:03:30,234
Maybe he's a prospector.

1633
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:32,564
-What are you talking--
-We're wasting time.

1634
02:03:32,671 --> 02:03:34,468
Harder. We gotta look harder!

1635
02:03:34,573 --> 02:03:36,837
Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.

1636
02:03:49,088 --> 02:03:52,387
-Who's he?
-I don't know, but he hasn't got a shovel.

1637
02:04:00,633 --> 02:04:03,033
-He's here, I tell ya.
-Yes, sir. That's his car.

1638
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:06,070
-I'll get that phony.
-Somebody must've come in those cabs.

1639
02:04:06,172 --> 02:04:09,699
-Come on, let's get moving!
-Come on, let's get moving!

1640
02:04:09,809 --> 02:04:12,744
-They must be here.
-They'd better be. Come on, Emmeline.

1641
02:04:12,878 --> 02:04:15,574
-Don't just sit there!
-Don't just sit there!

1642
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:16,875
Yes, I am.

1643
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:19,277
Then sit!

1644
02:04:19,919 --> 02:04:22,683
Mrs. Finch,
aren't you the teeniest bit curious?

1645
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:26,815
No. I'm not even curious, just disgusted.

1646
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:30,621
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

1647
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:42,839
You wouldn't know a big W if you saw one!

1648
02:04:42,975 --> 02:04:44,374
-I know a--
-Shut up!

1649
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:47,408
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.

1650
02:04:47,513 --> 02:04:50,141
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.

1651
02:04:50,249 --> 02:04:54,913
-That's all he said? "Under a big W"?
-Actually, I joined the party after that.

1652
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:57,454
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.

1653
02:04:57,556 --> 02:05:00,719
-Let's look--
-Will you shut up and follow me?

1654
02:05:55,314 --> 02:05:56,679
-Who's that?
-I don't know!

1655
02:05:56,782 --> 02:05:58,545
-From this morning?
-Yes.

1656
02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:03,313
-Who's he?
-I don't know.

1657
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:06,517
-Who's he?
-I don't know!

1658
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:09,560
Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this?

1659
02:06:10,763 --> 02:06:13,459
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?

1660
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,533
Mama, this thing's like a convention.

1661
02:06:52,671 --> 02:06:55,401
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.

1662
02:06:55,507 --> 02:06:59,273
Who are you? Are you with the others,
the ones that are looking?

1663
02:06:59,378 --> 02:07:01,778
-I am, in a way. Aren't you?
-No.

1664
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:05,008
I mean, I didn't want anything
to do with it right from the start.

1665
02:07:05,117 --> 02:07:06,584
And you know what?

1666
02:07:07,186 --> 02:07:11,714
I know where it is.
I'm the only one, and I wasn't even looking.

1667
02:07:11,824 --> 02:07:13,189
You know where it is?

1668
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:15,283
Yes! What should I do?

1669
02:07:19,264 --> 02:07:21,164
Come on out, everyone! This is ridiculous.

1670
02:07:21,266 --> 02:07:23,666
-I absolutely agree.
-Come on out.

1671
02:07:23,769 --> 02:07:26,260
We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.

1672
02:07:26,372 --> 02:07:27,964
So we all know. So what?

1673
02:07:28,073 --> 02:07:30,303
Don't talk to my mama
in that tone of voice!

1674
02:07:30,409 --> 02:07:31,774
-You hear?
-Shut up!

1675
02:07:31,877 --> 02:07:35,836
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.

1676
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:37,438
Those two cab drivers.

1677
02:07:37,549 --> 02:07:40,575
-They came with us and that dentist.
-You want to start?

1678
02:07:40,753 --> 02:07:43,984
-Yes, I want to--
-Why are we wasting time?

1679
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:45,522
We're all here.

1680
02:07:45,624 --> 02:07:49,185
Even if somebody finds the money,
nobody gets away with it...

1681
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:51,353
...unless everybody gets a share.

1682
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:54,465
Let's all get sensible
and get this organized.

1683
02:07:54,566 --> 02:07:56,796
Did you all hear what Mama said?

1684
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:59,994
-Come on, Mama.
-Now, wait a minute.

1685
02:08:00,105 --> 02:08:03,268
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...

1686
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:06,037
...with a sneery expression on his face?

1687
02:08:06,178 --> 02:08:09,306
This guy was ugly. I mean, like, real ugly.

1688
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:17,820
If you help dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

1689
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:20,683
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

1690
02:08:21,493 --> 02:08:23,484
If I have half of the money...

1691
02:08:23,996 --> 02:08:27,090
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

1692
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:32,364
Not Russell or my mother
or Sylvester, anybody.

1693
02:08:33,405 --> 02:08:35,600
You don't know what that'd mean.

1694
02:08:35,841 --> 02:08:37,206
If I had enough money...

1695
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:40,437
...I might be able to live
in a convent or something.

1696
02:08:40,846 --> 02:08:41,813
In a convent?

1697
02:08:43,515 --> 02:08:45,642
We all know we're all here.

1698
02:08:45,784 --> 02:08:48,776
It seems intelligent to me
that we should all share...

1699
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:51,082
...in one equal share apiece, right?

1700
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:52,282
Right. Mel was right.

1701
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:53,915
We all know that. Lookit--

1702
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:57,753
-No.
-Yeah.

1703
02:08:57,896 --> 02:09:00,057
It's him, all right. Yeah!

1704
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:04,228
You got this wrong. I came to apologize.

1705
02:09:04,369 --> 02:09:07,202
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.

1706
02:09:07,673 --> 02:09:11,302
-He's so neurotic. Can't you do something?
-I'll get you.

1707
02:09:11,777 --> 02:09:16,180
-He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
-When I get my hands on you....

1708
02:09:27,793 --> 02:09:29,124
Why, that's it.

1709
02:09:29,394 --> 02:09:31,385
Sure. Look!

1710
02:09:31,497 --> 02:09:33,465
It's the big W, I tell you!

1711
02:09:33,866 --> 02:09:35,458
It's the big W!

1712
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:39,070
Look at this.

1713
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:40,535
Look at it!

1714
02:09:46,478 --> 02:09:48,173
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

1715
02:09:49,648 --> 02:09:51,582
I'm afraid it's too late.

1716
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:53,918
I think they've found it.

1717
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:58,521
Right here all the time! He wasn't kidding!

1718
02:09:58,624 --> 02:10:02,617
-He was telling the truth!
-Folks, isn't this great?

1719
02:10:03,428 --> 02:10:06,226
Congratulations. Well done.

1720
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:09,992
Listen, I think the big boy
should get an extra share.

1721
02:10:10,135 --> 02:10:12,262
After all, it was he who found it.

1722
02:10:12,371 --> 02:10:15,670
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.

1723
02:10:15,774 --> 02:10:17,901
That's right. He deserves an extra share.

1724
02:10:19,211 --> 02:10:20,872
Let's start digging.

1725
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:23,209
Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

1726
02:10:23,315 --> 02:10:26,148
We're here with
an anthropological expedition.

1727
02:10:26,251 --> 02:10:28,014
-Nah.
-We don't tell them anything!

1728
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,520
We tell them to scram
or we beat their brains in.

1729
02:10:31,356 --> 02:10:33,221
It was a nice dream.

1730
02:10:34,493 --> 02:10:36,427
Lasted almost five minutes.

1731
02:10:46,471 --> 02:10:48,268
Now, don't bug me, I said.

1732
02:10:49,241 --> 02:10:50,401
Faster.

1733
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:52,267
Come on, dig, dig.

1734
02:10:52,778 --> 02:10:54,336
Faster, faster.

1735
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:57,471
Faster. Dig. That's it, dig.

1736
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:53,670
Faster.

1737
02:12:07,286 --> 02:12:10,449
There's not enough room. You two, out.

1738
02:12:10,555 --> 02:12:12,113
Let us do it.

1739
02:12:18,497 --> 02:12:21,898
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.

1740
02:12:22,167 --> 02:12:24,294
-"Bugging"?
-Cut out, cut out.

1741
02:12:24,436 --> 02:12:25,801
What's this "cut out" talk?

1742
02:12:25,904 --> 02:12:28,202
-Out, baby. Out!
-Don't call me baby.

1743
02:12:28,307 --> 02:12:31,333
-Quit arguing!
-Will ya come on?

1744
02:12:42,454 --> 02:12:45,082
-What's that?
-What was that?

1745
02:12:46,325 --> 02:12:48,259
-That's it.
-Sounded like a chest.

1746
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:50,021
I wonder what's in it.

1747
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:52,195
Bring it up here!

1748
02:12:59,404 --> 02:13:00,803
There it is!

1749
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:03,403
-It's a satchel.
-Hold it up!

1750
02:13:04,977 --> 02:13:08,140
-It's a satchel!
-I got it.

1751
02:13:09,214 --> 02:13:10,374
Open it up.

1752
02:13:10,615 --> 02:13:11,946
Come on!

1753
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:16,044
Bingo!

1754
02:13:16,888 --> 02:13:20,016
I say, chaps,
shouldn't we find a spot of cover?

1755
02:13:20,125 --> 02:13:21,353
There's nobody around.

1756
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,018
Come on. Count it out.

1757
02:13:23,128 --> 02:13:25,494
-What are we waiting for?
-Now wait a second!

1758
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:29,862
Everybody's going to get something,
so no arguments. We all get equal shares!

1759
02:13:30,235 --> 02:13:31,224
He's right.

1760
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:34,305
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.

1761
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:36,236
Now, how many are we?

1762
02:13:36,742 --> 02:13:38,471
One, two...

1763
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:42,937
...three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

1764
02:13:43,949 --> 02:13:48,682
...9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

1765
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,720
...14, 15.

1766
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:53,885
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.

1767
02:13:53,992 --> 02:13:57,553
You dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!

1768
02:13:57,763 --> 02:13:59,663
You can't get away with that!

1769
02:14:00,098 --> 02:14:01,065
Get him!

1770
02:14:01,366 --> 02:14:02,355
Grab him!

1771
02:14:02,801 --> 02:14:04,132
Get him!

1772
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:09,571
You only cheated yourself
because now you're out.

1773
02:14:09,775 --> 02:14:13,643
Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?

1774
02:14:13,745 --> 02:14:15,474
Not after what I've been through!

1775
02:14:16,448 --> 02:14:18,006
All right. Okay.

1776
02:14:18,116 --> 02:14:22,246
I'm warning you, if I don't get a share,
I'm going straight to the police.

1777
02:14:22,421 --> 02:14:25,652
-The police?
-What makes you think the police--

1778
02:14:26,391 --> 02:14:28,621
That money had to come from somewhere.

1779
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:33,187
We know where it's from,
that poor man that died on the mountain.

1780
02:14:33,331 --> 02:14:35,697
You wasn't even there, so shut up.

1781
02:14:35,934 --> 02:14:39,335
Okay, you asked for it.
I'm going straight to the police.

1782
02:14:39,471 --> 02:14:41,996
You think they'd be interested, Mr. Meyer?

1783
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:44,608
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?

1784
02:14:44,743 --> 02:14:46,301
How do you think money gets....

1785
02:14:49,681 --> 02:14:51,114
How did you know my name?

1786
02:14:51,316 --> 02:14:52,681
You know this crook?

1787
02:14:53,351 --> 02:14:57,788
I've never met him, Mr. Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

1788
02:14:58,757 --> 02:15:01,817
How did you know my name?
I've never met you.

1789
02:15:02,327 --> 02:15:04,352
Yeah, who are you?

1790
02:15:04,863 --> 02:15:06,455
Didn't he come with you?

1791
02:15:06,898 --> 02:15:09,662
He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.

1792
02:15:10,001 --> 02:15:10,933
No.

1793
02:15:11,103 --> 02:15:15,540
If he didn't come with us,
then who are you?

1794
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:17,835
I'm Capt. Culpeper...

1795
02:15:18,443 --> 02:15:20,536
...of the Santa Rosita Police Department.

1796
02:15:25,817 --> 02:15:28,581
<i>-Will you come to the point?</i>
-Yeah, I'm coming to it.

1797
02:15:28,753 --> 02:15:32,450
Point is, I have enough stuff
in my private files...

1798
02:15:32,657 --> 02:15:35,023
...stuff relating to civic building...

1799
02:15:35,127 --> 02:15:38,494
...road contracts,
harbor and cannery projects...

1800
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:41,394
...enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

1801
02:15:41,533 --> 02:15:45,697
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars
for the next 20 years.

1802
02:15:45,837 --> 02:15:49,796
And I give you my word,
that's exactly where everybody's going...

1803
02:15:49,975 --> 02:15:54,344
-...unless things start happening now.
<i>-Like what, for instance?</i>

1804
02:15:54,513 --> 02:15:57,482
I want the pension
for Culpeper's grade trebled.

1805
02:15:57,749 --> 02:16:01,981
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.

1806
02:16:02,154 --> 02:16:06,284
I want it on paper that
that's exactly what's going to happen.

1807
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:09,121
And I want it in my hands in 15 minutes...

1808
02:16:09,394 --> 02:16:12,329
...or I'll have all the reporters in town
in here in 20.

1809
02:16:13,098 --> 02:16:17,330
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.

1810
02:16:35,754 --> 02:16:39,417
Sir, could you possibly see your way clear
to give us a break?

1811
02:16:39,524 --> 02:16:41,754
You kidding? Him give you a break?

1812
02:16:42,427 --> 02:16:44,622
We had a pretty rough day already.

1813
02:16:44,729 --> 02:16:48,324
We was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane...

1814
02:16:48,466 --> 02:16:51,026
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

1815
02:16:51,636 --> 02:16:53,900
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain.

1816
02:16:54,005 --> 02:16:58,032
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...

1817
02:16:58,143 --> 02:16:59,610
...to live better lives.

1818
02:17:00,111 --> 02:17:02,011
There is one thing.

1819
02:17:03,014 --> 02:17:05,209
I don't know whether it would help or not.

1820
02:17:05,517 --> 02:17:09,044
But if, instead of my turning you in...

1821
02:17:10,021 --> 02:17:12,251
...you went and turned yourselves in...

1822
02:17:12,724 --> 02:17:16,455
...juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

1823
02:17:16,695 --> 02:17:18,959
You'd let us do that?

1824
02:17:19,197 --> 02:17:21,631
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

1825
02:17:21,933 --> 02:17:23,560
You must be a fine human being.

1826
02:17:23,702 --> 02:17:26,500
After all, why should you worry
whether we get a break?

1827
02:17:26,605 --> 02:17:29,733
Mr. Meyer,
no matter what you've all done today...

1828
02:17:29,841 --> 02:17:31,741
...you're not really criminals.

1829
02:17:33,278 --> 02:17:36,179
So if you like,
you can all hop into those two cabs...

1830
02:17:36,281 --> 02:17:39,079
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...

1831
02:17:39,484 --> 02:17:42,317
...and just walk in.

1832
02:17:42,821 --> 02:17:46,416
-Then let's do that.
-But, sir, we can't all fit.

1833
02:17:46,524 --> 02:17:50,893
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up later.

1834
02:17:51,029 --> 02:17:53,657
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go.

1835
02:17:55,767 --> 02:17:57,325
Back in the back.

1836
02:18:00,572 --> 02:18:01,630
Drive carefully.

1837
02:18:01,773 --> 02:18:04,367
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

1838
02:18:04,476 --> 02:18:06,034
Funny. That's funny.

1839
02:18:06,144 --> 02:18:07,406
Funny, right? Funny?

1840
02:18:07,512 --> 02:18:10,072
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

1841
02:18:10,548 --> 02:18:11,606
Yeah.

1842
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:41,408
-Culpeper.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

1843
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:44,072
Everything is under control here.

1844
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:47,712
It'll take a little longer
because there was a joker in the deck...

1845
02:18:47,819 --> 02:18:50,117
...that nobody knew about. All right?

1846
02:18:50,355 --> 02:18:51,583
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1847
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:55,082
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

1848
02:18:55,427 --> 02:18:56,416
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1849
02:19:03,702 --> 02:19:07,331
Listen, why does the man
want to give everybody a break?

1850
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:10,431
-What's his angle there?
-I was wondering about that, too.

1851
02:19:10,575 --> 02:19:14,204
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?

1852
02:19:14,346 --> 02:19:16,871
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.

1853
02:19:16,981 --> 02:19:19,347
I'm tellin' you,
the man has got some angle.

1854
02:19:19,517 --> 02:19:21,178
Wait, wait. Hold it!

1855
02:19:21,286 --> 02:19:22,378
Can you see him?

1856
02:19:32,664 --> 02:19:36,361
-Just what does he think he's doing?
-That certainly is strange.

1857
02:19:36,468 --> 02:19:38,459
-Sure is.
-What is he doing?

1858
02:19:38,737 --> 02:19:41,672
-He's going the other way.
-Why are we standing here?

1859
02:19:42,107 --> 02:19:43,131
That's it!

1860
02:19:45,176 --> 02:19:47,371
We're off the hook!

1861
02:19:48,012 --> 02:19:50,572
Get out of here! Come on, we're off!

1862
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:52,509
Come on, get going.

1863
02:20:05,997 --> 02:20:07,897
Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.

1864
02:20:23,348 --> 02:20:25,680
No other cops around. He planned it.

1865
02:20:25,784 --> 02:20:29,720
We found the money and he was waiting
to take it away from us.

1866
02:20:29,821 --> 02:20:33,814
But if we all find the money first
and turn it in, we're all in the clear.

1867
02:20:34,259 --> 02:20:37,387
Let's just get the dough
and worry about the rest later.

1868
02:20:37,595 --> 02:20:40,587
-Look. He's slowing down.
-No, he's turning to the left.

1869
02:21:33,685 --> 02:21:34,913
What's going on?

1870
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:36,853
Sorry, Jimmy.

1871
02:22:29,007 --> 02:22:30,702
He's heading for the border!

1872
02:22:30,808 --> 02:22:32,867
We should stop and call the police station!

1873
02:22:32,977 --> 02:22:34,035
You shut up!

1874
02:22:34,279 --> 02:22:36,804
We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!

1875
02:22:37,248 --> 02:22:39,273
That woman is something else.

1876
02:22:40,118 --> 02:22:41,642
Take your foot off the brake!

1877
02:22:41,753 --> 02:22:43,311
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.

1878
02:22:43,421 --> 02:22:46,720
-When you want a cab, you can't get one.
-Yeah, come on, let's go!

1879
02:22:56,167 --> 02:22:57,725
<i>F-14 to Central.</i>

1880
02:22:57,936 --> 02:22:59,301
Come in. What is it?

1881
02:22:59,437 --> 02:23:01,064
<i>There</i>'<i>s something phony here.</i>

1882
02:23:01,205 --> 02:23:04,140
<i>We</i>'<i>re on 101 by Cortez</i>
<i>checking a mad-dog report.</i>

1883
02:23:04,242 --> 02:23:05,971
Orders were to maintain silence.

1884
02:23:06,177 --> 02:23:08,543
Capt. Culpeper wants
this channel kept clear.

1885
02:23:08,646 --> 02:23:13,549
<i>We know it, but we saw Capt. Culpeper.</i>
<i>He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.</i>

1886
02:23:14,452 --> 02:23:16,716
I don't think I understand that.

1887
02:23:17,388 --> 02:23:19,288
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?

1888
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:21,415
<i>-Yep.</i>
-Was he chasing anybody?

1889
02:23:21,526 --> 02:23:23,687
<i>-Nope.</i>
-Could he have been chasing anybody?

1890
02:23:24,262 --> 02:23:27,322
<i>Not a chance.</i>
<i>That</i>'<i>s what struck us so funny.</i>

1891
02:23:27,498 --> 02:23:30,433
<i>There were about 15 people</i>
<i>in two cabs behind him.</i>

1892
02:23:30,702 --> 02:23:32,636
<i>It looked like they were chasing him.</i>

1893
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:35,898
They were chasing him?
What's going on here?

1894
02:23:36,007 --> 02:23:38,237
I brought it myself.
Everything you asked for.

1895
02:23:38,343 --> 02:23:39,605
-The pension?
-Yeah.

1896
02:23:39,744 --> 02:23:41,644
Call Capt. Culpeper.

1897
02:23:42,347 --> 02:23:45,373
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Central Division. Urgent.

1898
02:23:45,483 --> 02:23:48,281
Calling Capt. Culpeper.

1899
02:23:57,362 --> 02:24:00,593
-This can only happen in America.
-You going to start that again?

1900
02:24:32,196 --> 02:24:35,188
You've got to believe me.
I'm going to be sick.

1901
02:25:48,139 --> 02:25:50,607
What's the matter? You trying to kill us?

1902
02:25:51,175 --> 02:25:53,837
Just don't make me nervous!

1903
02:26:28,279 --> 02:26:31,043
-Don't let him get away!
-Cut him off!

1904
02:26:36,254 --> 02:26:40,350
<i>Calling Capt. Culpeper.</i>
<i>Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.</i>

1905
02:26:40,458 --> 02:26:43,985
<i>Now, listen to me, Culp.</i>
<i>Everything has been fixed.</i>

1906
02:26:44,128 --> 02:26:46,824
<i>There</i>'<i>s been negotiations</i>
<i>and everything is all right.</i>

1907
02:26:47,031 --> 02:26:49,522
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.

1908
02:26:49,667 --> 02:26:51,601
This is Aloysius speaking.

1909
02:27:02,013 --> 02:27:05,346
I still don't understand this.
What's it all about?

1910
02:27:07,185 --> 02:27:08,652
That's it.

1911
02:27:11,088 --> 02:27:12,385
All units...

1912
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:14,724
...arrest Capt. Culpeper.

1913
02:27:16,494 --> 02:27:18,621
There he is!

1914
02:27:23,901 --> 02:27:26,461
-Come back!
-Get me out of here!

1915
02:27:26,838 --> 02:27:28,999
Just don't sit there. Come on.

1916
02:27:31,576 --> 02:27:32,668
Come on!

1917
02:27:43,988 --> 02:27:45,751
Stop pushing, will ya?

1918
02:27:46,257 --> 02:27:49,624
Wait. We got him.
Now, you women stay here.

1919
02:27:49,727 --> 02:27:51,695
What do you mean,
"You women stay here"?

1920
02:27:51,796 --> 02:27:53,354
You heard him, mother. Stay here!

1921
02:27:53,497 --> 02:27:55,055
Come on! Let's go!

1922
02:28:11,249 --> 02:28:13,911
-Is he there?
-Where'd he go?

1923
02:28:14,352 --> 02:28:15,910
Halt! Halt!

1924
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:17,885
Now, wait a minute. Listen.

1925
02:28:27,198 --> 02:28:28,756
Yeah!

1926
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:37,632
Stop pushing! Get the suitcase.

1927
02:29:39,503 --> 02:29:41,232
Look! Look up there!

1928
02:29:41,472 --> 02:29:43,702
...in this regard, and there is no doubt....

1929
02:29:49,981 --> 02:29:51,676
Those ladders are not safe!

1930
02:29:52,516 --> 02:29:54,916
Ladders are not safe!

1931
02:30:00,992 --> 02:30:02,186
Get off!

1932
02:30:03,027 --> 02:30:04,756
-You got it?
-Get it away.

1933
02:30:13,137 --> 02:30:14,263
Get moving!

1934
02:30:14,472 --> 02:30:16,633
Don't push. You got it? That's it.

1935
02:30:22,813 --> 02:30:26,214
Sylvester, what are you doing up there?
You must be out of your mind!

1936
02:30:29,887 --> 02:30:32,378
-Wait a minute!
-Get the suitcase!

1937
02:30:37,395 --> 02:30:38,828
Get that money!

1938
02:30:59,917 --> 02:31:02,112
Don't you dare touch any of that money.

1939
02:31:14,899 --> 02:31:17,766
-You! Don't stand there!
-To your right!

1940
02:31:29,713 --> 02:31:31,044
Russell, hang on!

1941
02:31:35,419 --> 02:31:37,284
Dingy, I can't hold on!

1942
02:31:39,423 --> 02:31:40,617
Help us!

1943
02:31:44,462 --> 02:31:45,986
Get off my hand!

1944
02:32:06,717 --> 02:32:08,617
Move onto the ladder!

1945
02:32:10,488 --> 02:32:14,049
Hold on! Wait a minute!
One at a time! Did you hear me?

1946
02:32:14,258 --> 02:32:15,452
One at a time!

1947
02:32:18,729 --> 02:32:19,991
All right!

1948
02:32:20,831 --> 02:32:23,766
All right, you'll see. You'll see.

1949
02:32:25,369 --> 02:32:27,803
Get on alphabetical. I'm Benjy.

1950
02:32:28,405 --> 02:32:31,033
Quit stepping on my head!

1951
02:32:31,208 --> 02:32:32,266
Get on the ladder.

1952
02:32:32,510 --> 02:32:33,977
Get on the ladder.

1953
02:32:35,246 --> 02:32:37,476
Don't leave me! Come back here!

1954
02:32:37,781 --> 02:32:39,476
You can't leave me!

1955
02:32:45,456 --> 02:32:47,856
There's too many men on it to control it.

1956
02:33:17,821 --> 02:33:20,312
Hold it steady. Watch it.
She's whipping loose.

1957
02:33:59,396 --> 02:34:02,058
Wind us down!

1958
02:34:05,803 --> 02:34:08,169
I don't want the money!

1959
02:34:12,009 --> 02:34:13,271
Look out!

1960
02:34:21,352 --> 02:34:23,013
Get off!

1961
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:25,188
She's going! Get out of there!

1962
02:35:48,739 --> 02:35:50,468
It's all your fault.

1963
02:35:51,241 --> 02:35:53,709
It's your fault from beginning to end.

1964
02:35:54,211 --> 02:35:57,203
You know, even for a policeman...

1965
02:35:57,481 --> 02:36:00,348
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.

1966
02:36:00,684 --> 02:36:03,278
You could've taken a fair share
like the rest of us...

1967
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,513
...but no, you had to grab up
the whole scene, baby.

1968
02:36:07,725 --> 02:36:12,992
We had $350,000 right in our hands.

1969
02:36:13,597 --> 02:36:16,760
Fourteen into $350,000....

1970
02:36:17,768 --> 02:36:18,962
Shut up.

1971
02:36:21,672 --> 02:36:24,436
I wish I knew what
they were gonna do to us.

1972
02:36:24,675 --> 02:36:29,669
But no matter what happens to us,
I hope what happens to you will be worse.

1973
02:36:32,216 --> 02:36:34,946
I don't think you have to worry
too much about that.

1974
02:36:35,519 --> 02:36:37,453
My wife is divorcing me.

1975
02:36:38,555 --> 02:36:41,251
My mother-in-law is suing me for damages.

1976
02:36:42,626 --> 02:36:46,153
My daughter is applying to the courts
to have her name changed.

1977
02:36:47,331 --> 02:36:49,094
My pension has been revoked.

1978
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:53,092
And the only reason that you 10 idiots...

1979
02:36:53,971 --> 02:36:56,462
...will very likely get off lightly...

1980
02:36:57,508 --> 02:37:01,239
...is because the judge will have
me up there to throw the book at.

1981
02:37:02,346 --> 02:37:03,813
That's tough.

1982
02:37:08,118 --> 02:37:12,851
I'd like to think that sometime,
maybe 10 or 20 years from now...

1983
02:37:14,057 --> 02:37:17,220
...there'd be something
I could laugh at, anything.

1984
02:37:27,171 --> 02:37:30,572
Now, see here, you idiots,
it's all your fault because--

1985
02:37:44,555 --> 02:37:46,853
Get away from me!

1986
02:37:47,024 --> 02:37:48,116
Let me go!
