1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,880
<i>Previously on Revolution...</i>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,434
Why'd you do it?

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:05,819
'Cause we needed him and you asked me to.

4
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:07,153
You have to tell me where my son is.

5
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,739
One thing at a time.

6
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:11,441
You set off a bomb in my town.

7
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:14,811
Your job is to keep our
town healthy and compliant,

8
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,980
unless you're not a loyal American.

9
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:18,064
[Groaning]

10
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,315
You can't fix him.

11
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,750
It's the training.

12
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:22,419
You cut him loose, he will kill us both.

13
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,337
You were so worried about trusting my son,

14
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,172
when you should've been
worried about trusting me.

15
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:28,358
You said your husband
was Patriot high command?

16
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:29,759
What do you want?

17
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:31,478
Where is the old ball and chain?

18
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:33,430
I'd like to pick your
brain about the nanotech.

19
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:35,298
He's already onto the bodies.

20
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:37,601
Aaron, it's only a matter of
time before Horn is onto you.

21
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:38,835
So where are they?

22
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,604
I did not want to be right about this.

23
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:41,972
He's one of them.

24
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,506
We got to get Aaron out of here.

25
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:44,975
I'm Aaron Pittman! I'll come quietly!

26
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,528
Just leave her alone!

27
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,947
Aaron, you have got to
tell me how you do that.

28
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:52,449
You don't have to be afraid of him,

29
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,801
but it's not him you're afraid of, is it?

30
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,703
Why don't you tell me
what's going on, please?

31
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,074
[Crying]

32
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,135
[Coughing]

33
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,452
Where's Horn?

34
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,623
[Breathing heavily]

35
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:18,793
Where's Horn?

36
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:23,214
I haven't seen the son
of a bitch in a while,

37
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,483
but I'm pretty sure you
know where he's holed up.

38
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:28,721
He's working.

39
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,025
Always working.

40
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,610
Working where?

41
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,699
[Sighs] You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

42
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,084
Is that right?

43
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,319
Horn's looking for you.

44
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,739
He's got men everywhere looking for you...

45
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:48,625
and her...

46
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:52,745
and Pittman.

47
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:55,248
and once he finds you...

48
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,935
know what he's gonna do?

49
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,225
Of course I do.

50
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,944
That's why I'm gonna find him first.

51
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,097
So let's try this one more time.

52
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,318
Where is he?

53
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,774
I know, I know.

54
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,293
The bombing rocked all of us.

55
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:27,714
It was a tragedy and an act of cowardice,

56
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,133
plain and simple.

57
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,402
And, folks...

58
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,321
We now know who was behind the bombing...

59
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:40,226
the man who stood amongst us
and called himself Stu Redman.

60
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:44,530
But his real name is Miles Matheson.

61
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,050
You may have heard of him...

62
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,436
General Miles Matheson
of the Monroe Republic.

63
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,873
Now, we have reason to believe
he was acting in retaliation

64
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,676
for the execution of his former leader...

65
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,228
Sebastian Monroe,

66
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,547
and he didn't act alone.

67
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,716
He had an accomplice...

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,768
Aaron Pittman.

69
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:22,613
Uh, yeah.

70
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:27,235
Matheson and Pittman pulled
the wool over our eyes,

71
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,670
yours and mine.

72
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:34,041
My daughter also came to town with them.

73
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:37,979
She was troubled psychologically.

74
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:41,332
Some of you know that.

75
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,985
She had nothing to do with any of this.

76
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,654
She and my granddaughter are victims.

77
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:50,224
They were manipulated by these men.

78
00:03:50,242 --> 00:03:55,079
So, please, if you see them,
report it to a U.S. officer.

79
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,265
I'm begging you,

80
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,750
help me find them.

81
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:02,036
I just want my family safe.

82
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:13,681
They said they'd meet us
here, they'll meet us here.

83
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:16,434
Well, I got news for you, stay puft.

84
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:19,770
There might have been a change of plan.

85
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:24,859
What change of plan?

86
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,028
In that this plan has gone to hell.

87
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:29,780
Those Patriot sons of
bitches were waiting for you.

88
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,399
And we don't know what happened.

89
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,201
We don't know if Miles
can even get out of town

90
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,769
or if he's still alive.

91
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:39,607
We're gonna wait right
here like Miles told us to.

92
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,809
Whoa, okay, okay.

93
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:44,662
Just don't light me on fire or anything.

94
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:11,472
Who's that?

95
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,491
Nobody.

96
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:17,078
Just some intel.

97
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,413
What's it like out there?

98
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:21,566
It's not good.

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,734
Truman told everyone who Miles really is.

100
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,469
Said that Miles is the one
that blew up the building

101
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:26,854
and that he's the terrorist.

102
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:30,157
Did you see your grandfather?

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,729
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:41,686
Look, mom, we got to find
a way out of town now.

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,020
Not yet.

106
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:44,939
Why not? Aaron's waiting for us.

107
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:48,876
This is for Aaron, trust me.

108
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,145
They will never give up.

109
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:55,399
They will never stop looking for
him unless we kill Horn first.

110
00:05:57,152 --> 00:06:01,055
They're calling us terrorists.

111
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,541
Just you wait.

___

114
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,630
Hold it right there.

115
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:26,288
Tom Neville from the Savannah camp.

116
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,624
I'm here to see commander Roger Allenford.

117
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:30,109
State your business.

118
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,794
Just...

119
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,963
give him this.

120
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,816
Tell him...

121
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,603
I only speak to him.

122
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,811
Those real?

123
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:55,200
A little privacy, gentlemen.

124
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,158
Is she alive?

125
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,761
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:07,179
She is.

127
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,870
Where is she?

128
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,138
Tied up...

129
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:18,841
safe, hidden.

130
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,311
You've got a lot of balls
coming into my office

131
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:24,847
and telling me you've got my wife captive.

132
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:29,268
With all due respect, sir,

133
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:33,038
your wife is an enemy of
the United States of America.

134
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:37,292
I figured that you were a good Patriot.

135
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:38,877
Am I wrong?

136
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,635
She's guilty of sedition.

137
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,238
She should be punished.

138
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,142
So why not bring her in?

139
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:56,178
My guess is that you have

140
00:07:56,212 --> 00:08:00,883
a dark and stormy cloud over your head,

141
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:05,053
over an otherwise spotless career.

142
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:09,158
I mean, your wife is a traitor.

143
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,659
People have to be whispering

144
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:13,912
whether or not you were pillow-talking,

145
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:17,933
whether or not any of it rubbed off on you.

146
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,086
But if you brought your wife in

147
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,856
by yourself,

148
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,892
delivered her unto justice,

149
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:30,262
that would solve all of
your problems, wouldn't it?

150
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:33,699
Turn that rain into sunshine.

151
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:43,358
And why would you do this for me?

152
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,526
Honestly?

153
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,261
I'm ambitious.

154
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:49,348
And I think there's value

155
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:53,035
in being friends with a man like you.

156
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,587
So, Commander...

157
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:59,725
would you like to come and see the missus?

158
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:04,446
[Dogs barking]

159
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:24,433
I thought these people trusted you.

160
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:28,153
I thought you were
their beloved Dr. Porter.

161
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,989
Someone will know where
Pittman is... I'll find him.

162
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:33,242
Do you know what'll happen
to your daughter if you don't?

163
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,743
Or your granddaughter?

164
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,529
Threatening me won't find him any faster.

165
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,184
Someone knows something.

166
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:45,821
How about we get everyone Pittman knows,

167
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:48,023
march them into town square,
and start executing them?

168
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:51,460
I bet they'll talk then.

169
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:55,264
I have put a hell of a lot of
time into managing this town.

170
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:56,765
We have a plan.

171
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,968
Right, the plan...

172
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:02,471
taking town after town.

173
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:06,608
And how many years until
you take the whole continent?

174
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:09,511
If I get my hands on Pittman

175
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,697
and figure out what makes him tick,

176
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:14,716
we take everything in months.

177
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:22,040
That's all.

178
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:45,230
Here, I found this.

179
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,851
What is that?

180
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,719
What is this, food?

181
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:54,106
People used to think so, yeah.

182
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,667
I know you're angry,

183
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:08,570
and I'm not apologizing for him.

184
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:11,707
But you don't know why
grandpa did what he did.

185
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,209
He sold us out. He works for them.

186
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:16,745
Yeah, I get it. You hate him for it.

187
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:20,382
You don't?

188
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,601
No.

189
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:25,270
Well, you're a better person than me.

190
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:27,189
No, I'm not.

191
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:30,058
I hated you for a long time

192
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:33,278
for abandoning Danny and me...

193
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:35,113
for killing Nora.

194
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:37,098
That's not fair.

195
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,284
This is different.

196
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:42,187
All I'm saying is hating
you was the easy part.

197
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:45,707
But letting it go?

198
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,910
That's hard.

199
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,752
It's like EPCOT East Berlin out there.

200
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:58,921
They have dogs.

201
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:00,472
When the hell did they get dogs?

202
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:03,458
You find the place?

203
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,794
The guy's intel was legit.

206
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:10,983
Is there any way to get in there,

207

208
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,269
Not gonna be easy.

209
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:17,606
Place is sealed up tighter than a drum.

210
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,660
And, uh, Rachel, the...

211
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:22,945
there's something else.

212
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:25,914
I... I saw Truman walking in.

213
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,315
Good. Two birds, one stone.

214
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,117
Walking in with Gene.

215
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,507
You should try to sleep.

216
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:57,012
You haven't said a word all day.

217
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,180
Come on...

218
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,234
talk to me.

219
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:08,540
Did you kill Carl?

220
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,859
What?

221
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:12,878
Did you kill my husband?

222
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,364
The way he died,

223
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:20,285
the fire in the car,

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,554
it was always strange.

225
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,359
He hit me.

226
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:30,545
Oh, my...

227
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,147
oh, God.

228
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:34,216
Oh, God, Aaron.

229
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,735
I got angry, and I couldn't control it.

230
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,187
You know I can't control it.

231
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,524
You lied to me.

232
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:47,395
You murdered him, and
you slept in my bed...

233
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,282
and you lied about it.

234
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:54,736
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,742
I didn't know how to explain it.

236
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,762
I've had enough liars in my life.

237
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:06,098
Cynthia...

238
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:10,018
Just leave me alone.

239
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,970
I need to think.

240
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,650
What?

241
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:01,269
I always dreamed of
cooking with my daughter,

242
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,338
just not like this.

243
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,162
You sure this stuff is safe to carry?

244
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:13,148
Separately they're fine.

245
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,918
But drop this with this down an air shaft

246
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:19,938
into a locked up basement?

247
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:23,291
The gas will kill Horn
and everyone else inside.

248
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,328
So when the time comes to do this,

249
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:30,665
what if grandpa's there?

250
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,503
Let's just hope that he's not.

251
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:37,305
Okay, but if he is,

252
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,525
you're not gonna go through with it, right?

253
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,211

254
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:52,087
Hey.

Where the hell are you going?

256
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,118
You're just gonna leave us?

257
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,937
Look, if Miles was coming,
he would've been here by now.

258
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:01,957
I'm gonna go find him.
And what if they find us?

259
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,543
All right, just... just hold on, hold on.

260
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:07,245
We wouldn't last three days without you.

261
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,415
You think three?

262
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,951
Look, Miles has got some
information that I need,

263
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,086
someone I need to find.

264
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,804
I held up my end of the bargain.

265
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:18,123
Now it's his turn...

266
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,458

She will.

288

God won't take her from me.

more that we could do for her?

Maybe he could come and see her.

- He could what?

370
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:18,903
not all the way.

371
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:24,391
- How much further?
- Just up ahead.

372
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,564
[Gun cocks]

373
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:37,671
Do we have a problem?

374
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:39,106
Did you hurt her?

375
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:44,360
I wondered if something
like this might happen.

376
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:47,029
You're still sweet on the woman.

377
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:50,499
Well, first thing you need
to know, I have a man on her.

378
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:53,636
You try walking in there without
me, it'll be a short reunion.

379
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,504
So how about we put the gun down?

380
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:57,606
No, this is what's gonna happen.

381
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:00,509
You're gonna take me in there,
and you're gonna let my wife go.

382
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,028
And then? What?

383
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:04,847
You two run off together,

384
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:08,717
escape like two star-crossed teens?

385
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:11,036
Boy, she must be worth it.

386
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:14,373
She must give it to you good and sweet.

387
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:16,208
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

388
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:18,360
I thought I was talking to a man

389
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:21,630
with his head on straight.

390
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:25,784
If I bring her back...

391
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:27,136
they'll kill her.

392
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,670
You cut her loose and run off,

393
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,506
they'll hunt you down and kill you both.

394
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,609
How far do you think you're gonna make it

395
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:36,812
with your soft hands and your fine art?

396
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:39,498
Be realistic.

397
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:42,318
Your wife went rogue
without a single thought

398
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:45,204
of what it might do to you or your son.

399
00:29:45,238 --> 00:29:48,207
And if the boy has two traitor parents,

400
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:52,044
what do you think they're gonna do to him?

401
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:54,013
The only question is,

402
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:58,734
what side of this are you gonna land on?

403
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:14,641
Charlie?

404
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,812
What the hell are you still doing in town?

405
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:37,367
You should be miles from here.

406
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,049
We can't.

407
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,747
Aaron's our family.

408
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:46,452
How'd they find him, Gene?

409
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:50,791
I found him.

410
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:53,010
And what's Horn doing with him?

411
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:54,528
I don't know.

412
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,898
He's still alive... for now.

413
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:02,920
Grandpa, how could you?

414
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:06,723
They were gonna kill you if I didn't.

415
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:10,211
What else was I supposed to do?

416
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,663
How about the right thing?

417
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:15,933
How about everything that you taught me?

418
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,918
Okay.

419
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:20,755
We're gonna get Aaron out of there,

420
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:22,339
and you are gonna help.

421
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:23,924
There's nothing I can do.

422
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,410
You can't get in. It's too late.

423
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,213
- And whose fault is that?
- I was trying to keep you safe.

424
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:31,599
Really?

425
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,101
By lying to me?

426
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:38,773
By letting me think that I was crazy?

427
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:44,111
How was that supposed to help?

428
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:49,200
Your mother...

429
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,452
died of an awful disease.

430
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:54,705
There was nothing I could do

431
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:58,775
except watch her waste away.

432
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:02,913
And suddenly...

433
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:06,467
I had a chance to save everybody.

434
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,422
They gave me medicine.

435
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:15,125
No one else had to die like she did.

436
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:19,547
I didn't realize who they were

437
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:22,983
until it was too late.

438
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:26,403
But, Rachel...

439
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:28,522
it's too late.

440
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:34,161
You rolled over.

441
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:36,947
You helped them.

442
00:32:36,982 --> 00:32:39,816
You've never done a bad
thing for a good reason?

443
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:45,789
What about you, Miles?

444
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:50,678
Dad...

445
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:56,133
how am I ever supposed
to forgive you for this?

446
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,335
You're not.

447
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,271
I don't want it.

448
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:03,840
If keeping you alive...

449
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,660
means you hate me, then you just hate me.

450
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:10,581
But for God's sake, run.

451
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,884
Run.

452
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:18,739
I know you all are in there!

453
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:26,330
You got one minute to surrender
yourselves and come on out,

454
00:33:26,364 --> 00:33:28,198
or we're coming in.

455
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,535
Get them out, Gene, or
else this ends bloody.

456
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:32,869
You son of a bitch.

457
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,805
I didn't know, I swear.

458
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,307
Look...

459
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:39,843
I can...

460
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:43,080
let me stay behind.

461
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:47,401
Maybe I can buy you a couple of minutes.

462
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:51,888
Please.

463
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:53,324
No.

464
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:55,059
You have to come with us.

He's coming with us.

466
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:09,039
Prepare to fire.

What is this, Gene?

470
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,851
Where are they?

471
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:24,021
Horn said he was gonna
leave my daughter alone.

472
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:26,607
And he will.

473
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:30,277
But Miles Matheson
bombed the town, remember?

474
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,430
Now, you hand him over,

475
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,150
and your daughter walks free.

476
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,937
Ah...

477
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,374
I heard that one before, Ed.

478
00:34:43,408 --> 00:34:44,775
It's the truth.

479
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,966
Any one of you takes a step
forward toward that building,

480
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,717
this man dies.

481
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:55,452
Big mistake here, Gene.

482
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,287
I've made worse.

483
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,757
Go, damn it!

484
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,246
Unbelievable.

485
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:40,731
Why you, Aaron?

486
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,366
The nanites in your body

487
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,869
are behaving in a highly individual way,

488
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:47,071
repairing your cells,

490
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:53,044
But why?

491
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:55,613
Why only you?

492
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:03,221
I have no idea.

493
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:06,474
You think of me as your enemy.

494
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,445
But we're partners now.

495
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,836
You know, my father believed

496
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,540
there was a magic, invisible
power all around us,

497
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:25,376
and if he prayed hard enough,

498
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,763
it would grant him a miracle.

499
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:34,618
He was a horrible, stupid man

500
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:37,805
who based his whole life on a fairy tale.

501
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,226
But it's ironic.

502
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,029
Turns out he was right...

503
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:46,781
sort of.

504
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:49,934
There is an invisible
power that can save people.

505
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:53,437
It just doesn't come
from heaven, that's all.

506
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,757
But I have to admit,

507
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:59,410
it is, in its own way,

508
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:01,829
a miracle.

509
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:07,301
You're gonna teach me how to use it.

510
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:11,589
I can't.

511
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,924
I don't know how.

512
00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:24,652
Then we'll figure it out together.

[Sighs deeply]

514
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:30,608
It's important.

515
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,647
I have a tumor growing in my brain,

516
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:41,619
and the symptoms are getting worse.

517
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:43,504
And I'd lost all hope.

518
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:45,989
Then I heard about you.

519
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:48,676
Aaron...

520
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:54,465
I need you to deliver me that miracle.

521
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:00,638
And I believe that you can.

Easy, boy.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

529
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:38,872
Writing that letter...

530
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:42,309
was stupid.

531
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:44,945
You knew how they would react.

532
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:51,702
What they did to Max, to our baby boy...

533
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:54,788
I didn't want them to
do that to anyone else.

534
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,262
You know how much trouble you're in now...

535
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:05,382
how much trouble we're
both in because of you?

00:40:37,192 --> 00:40:39,860
So here's what we've learned.

555
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:43,530
Self-healing occurs as a direct
reaction to physical trauma,

556
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:47,151
like a lizard regrowing its tail...

557
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:49,703
but your defensive actions,

558
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:52,956
burning people alive and all that,

559
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:57,828
are a response to emotional stimuli.

560
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:01,165
That's what the next phase is all about.

561
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:07,204
Here you go.

562
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:11,592
This one should perk you right up.

563
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:20,150
[Whimpering]

564
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:23,887
Aaron!

565
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:27,040
[Breathing heavily]

566
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:28,859
What are you gonna do?

567
00:41:28,893 --> 00:41:30,694
Sorry.

568
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:35,732
I am, but we need to elevate
you to a proper emotional state.

569
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,502
Then maybe...

570
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:40,403
maybe you can heal someone else.

571
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:42,239
No. Please!

572
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:45,342
You said you weren't gonna hurt her.

573
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:48,045
I'll check in in a bit.

574
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:55,352
This room may not be the
safest place to be right now.

575
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:59,223
[Breathing heavily]

576
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:11,101
Stop!

577
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,452
[Groans] No!

578
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,217
There's gotta be 20 men
in that bunker. 20 outside.

579
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:21,285
Aaron and Cynthia are in there.

580
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:22,355
What choice do we have?

581
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,577
What the hell?

582
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,082
Are they dead?
