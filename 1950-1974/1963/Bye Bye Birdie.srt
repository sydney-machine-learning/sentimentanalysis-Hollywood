1
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,954
Bye, bye, Birdie

2
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:30,708
I'm gonna miss you so

3
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:35,213
Bye, bye, Birdie

4
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:38,174
Why'd ya have to go

5
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:41,050
Bye, bye

6
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:45,680
- No more sunshine
- Sunshine

7
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,434
- It's followed you away
- You away

8
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:53,772
I'll cry, Birdie

9
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:57,402
Till you're home to stay

10
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:01,574
I'll miss the way you smile
as though it's just for me

11
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:03,701
And each and every night

12
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:07,997
I'll write you faithfully

13
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:12,916
Bye, bye, Birdie

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,545
It's awful hard to bear

15
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:21,133
Bye, bye, Birdie

16
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:25,305
Guess I'll always care

17
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:29,476
Guess I'll always care

18
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:33,438
Guess I'll always care

19
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:48,766
Look! Look! Hey!

20
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:15,669
We love you, Conrad

21
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:18,464
Oh, yes, we do

22
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,216
We love you, Conrad

23
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,928
And we'll be true

24
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,970
When you're not near us

25
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,096
We're blue

26
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:29,723
We're blue

27
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:35,145
Oh, Conrad, we love you

28
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:40,525
This is John Daly reporting
with the CBS mobile unit...

29
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,071
in front of
the nation's capitol...

30
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:47,909
bringing you on-the-spot coverage
of our current teenage crisis...

31
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,495
over the drafting
of Conrad Birdie.

32
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:54,458
Sociologists agree
that Birdie is a phenomenon.

33
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:58,462
For those few music lovers who have
never attended one of his concerts...

34
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,547
here are some news photos
tracing his meteoric rise.

35
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:48,804
And that... that is
our army's newest weapon.

36
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:52,517
Private Birdie reports
for his induction in ten days.

37
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,728
His income drops
from $2 million a year...

38
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:59,066
to $78 a month.

39
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,694
It could only happen in America.

40
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,614
Why?

41
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,575
Why did they have to draft him?

42
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,328
Just when I finally write a song
he's gonna do.

43
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,705
The title song
of his next picture.

44
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,626
"Mumbo Jumbo Gooey Gumbo."

45
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,631
Now there's no picture.
There's nothing.

46
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,476
Albert, I have your financial statement,
it you really want to hear it.

47
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:36,230
"Total assets: $312.08.

48
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:39,814
Liabilities: $4,030."

49
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:41,316
You...

50
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,782
Contidentially,
you're a fiscal fiasco.

51
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:52,910
Good-bye, Albert. It's a sad ending
to a long association.

52
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,956
Yeah. Oh, don't you want
to say good-bye to Pidge?

53
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:06,967
Almaelou's busted, Pidge. You better
get yourself another meal ticket.

54
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:11,890
In six years
I never sold one lousy song.

55
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:14,433
Maybe they weren't lousy enough.

56
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:20,855
I don't care
so much about myself...

57
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,442
but I'm my mother's sole support.

58
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,611
I've wasted every cent
my father left Mama...

59
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:28,782
It's not your fault. Your mother
wants you to be a songwriter.

60
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,158
You can make a good living
as a biochemist.

61
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:36,791
That's a wonderful profession,
but Mama wants...

62
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,043
Just because she was
once in vaudeville...

63
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:42,172
doesn't mean you
belong in show business.

64
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:46,674
Confidentially, I respect my mother,
but I do what I want.

65
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:50,469
Well, Mama's sensitive.
When I upset her, she faints.

66
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,599
Why, with your ideas, you can
make a fortune in chemistry.

67
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,102
Chemistry.

68
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,980
Chemistry. Chemistry?
You sound like Rosie.

69
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:03,024
- Where is she? Where's Rosie?
- Oh, she phoned.

70
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:06,529
She heard about Birdie being drafted.
She's going to see Ed Sullivan.

71
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:11,283
Sure, to get another job.
Oh, a fine secretary!

72
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:15,747
Why, we have been practically engaged,
just waiting for an okay from Mama.

73
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,583
Now when I hit bottom,
Rosie deserts me.

74
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,585
Quits betore my body's even warm.

75
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,627
Ed Sullivan!

76
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,591
Would you send in
Rosie DeLeon, please?

77
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:34,681
Is it yes, Mr. Sullivan?
It's just got to be yes.

78
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:38,436
- Rosie, it is yes.
- Oh, hallelujah!

79
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,983
Oh, I love you. Oh, that's marvelous.
Oh, I love you too! I'm so glad!

80
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,820
Miss DeLeon, I'd like you
to meet our producer, Bob Precht.

81
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,531
- Oh, hi. How are you?
- Well, it's my pleasure.

82
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,825
If you can overcome
your shyness, tell me...

83
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:54,535
what's our using Birdie
on the show got to do with you?

84
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:56,620
Let's face it,
I'm a scheming woman.

85
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,872
I have a promotion idea
that'll knock you out.

86
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:01,417
It you buy it,
I want a little favor.

87
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,752
All right.
Let's try it on for size.

88
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:06,964
How'd you like a terrific buildup
betore the show...

89
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,342
that'll have every TV set
tuned into you next Sunday?

90
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:12,555
We will have. After all,
we've got the Moscow Ballet and Birdie.

91
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,097
- This is bigger.
- Bigger?

92
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,266
Betore Conrad Birdie
goes into the army...

93
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,061
he bestows a farewell kiss
on all the swooning girls...

94
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,897
who worship him on your TV show.

95
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,609
Atter all, it's only an hour show,
and Birdie only gets four minutes.

96
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,403
He kisses them all symbolically.

97
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:30,445
- What'd you say?
- Symbolically.

98
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,907
- Actually, he'll only kiss one girl.
- He kisses only one girl?

99
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,577
Can't you see it? Birdie,
their idol, their leader...

100
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:39,247
kissing one tabulously
lucky teenage Tessie?

101
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,666
- Yeah! Yeah!
- It'll melt every bobby pin in America.

102
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,171
It's gigantic. The newspapers will eat
it up. Think of the advance publicity.

103
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:47,339
Get the Birdie's
fan club file right away.

104
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,676
- Get us a girl from Ohio.
- Gotcha!

105
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,971
We'll do it from the outdoor theater,
Columbus, Ohio, right after the ballet.

106
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:57,268
- I'll get the girl.
- The network will handle the details.

107
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,435
And after the kiss,
Birdie sings a big song.

108
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:03,855
- That's where Rosie gets her payoff.
- I don't get it.

109
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,775
- The song is "One Last Kiss."
- Never heard of it.

110
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:09,780
- Hasn't been written yet.
- Who is going to write this classic?

111
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:14,283
Oh, who else, but my future husband,
Mr. Albert F. Peterson?

112
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:16,452
Birdie's been wanting
to give Albert a break for six years.

113
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:18,790
I know he'll use the song,
if you say so.

114
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:24,293
Any song will do even though it's
written by your ever-lovin' Albert.

115
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:25,629
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

116
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:28,924
With a plug like this, that song
will sell a million records.

117
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:32,469
- Man, what royalties!
- We can sure use the money.

118
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,305
Any day now Albert and I
will have another mouth to feed.

119
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,681
Rosie, you're not even married yet.

120
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,767
His mother! Bye.

121
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,978
Carmine, get me
the publicity department right away.

122
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,651
This batch will do. Get them
ready for mailing right away.

123
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:51,781
Oh, hi, Marge. I need
one of your fans trom Ohio.

124
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,116
You can have them all.
Try file number six.

125
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,870
Okay. Six, here we go.

126
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,623
I'm about to make
some gaga little goof a queen.

127
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,420
Hey, cute.

128
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:11,842
Long distance? I want Miss Kim McAfee,
Sweet Apple, 135, Sweet Apple, Ohio.

129
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:15,053
Marge, isn't it amazing what a woman
has to do to get a man to marry her?

130
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:17,056
You mean you doped
Albert's mother?

131
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,809
No, but if this doesn't work,
that's my next move.

132
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,771
What, Operator?
Oh, the line's busy.

133
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:26,859
Never mind. I'll try later.
Thank you.

134
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:31,196
Oh, Marge, right now there's a kid
named Kim McAfee in Sweet Apple, Ohio...

135
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:32,864
gabbing on the telephone.

136
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:36,076
Little does she realize
I'm about to make her immortal.

137
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:44,123
- Hello?
- Hello, Urse. This is Kim.

138
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,877
It I don't tell somebody,
I'm just gonna burst.

139
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,381
So, Ursula, you are
the very first to know.

140
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:54,428
I just got pinned
by Hugo Peabody.

141
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:59,057
Oh, no! Kim McAfee, you didn't!
You really got pinned?

142
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,105
You mean you and Hugo have
a permanent understanding?

143
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:06,858
Uh-huh. Oh,
it's Hugo and I forever.

144
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,695
Crazy! Crazy!

145
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,448
Tell me, Kim,
how do you absolutely feel...

146
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:17,450
in your deepest secret soul?

147
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:21,162
It's like...
It's like I've been reborn.

148
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:25,750
It's like all of my lite until
this very moment I was nothing.

149
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,586
Kim, I must use the phone.
I've got to call Grandma.

150
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,923
In a second, Mom.
Hey, listen, Ursula.

151
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,260
I'm gonna have to get off.
Where was I?

152
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,845
- You were nothing.
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,434
And now I'm alive, fulfilled.

154
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,311
Now I know what
it means to be a woman.

155
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:45,563
It should only happen to me.

156
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,440
Kim, where did he pin you?

157
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:52,402
On the backseat. Oh, bless
that lovely yellow school bus.

158
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:56,448
- Kim, hurry, please.
- Hang up, so I can spread the word.

159
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,408
Okay, bye, Urse.

160
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:16,096
- Hi, Nancy
- Hi, Ursula

161
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:19,807
What's the story, morning glory
What's the tale, nightingale

162
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,516
Did you hear about Hugo and Kim

163
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:25,186
- Hi, Margie
- Hi, Alice

164
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,023
- What's the story, morning glory
- What's the word, hummingbird

165
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,109
Have you heard about Hugo and Kim

166
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,821
Did they really get pinned
Did she kiss him and cry

167
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:38,576
Did he pin the pin on
or was he too shy

168
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,578
- Well, I heard they got pinned
- Yeah, yeah

169
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,580
- I was hopin' they would
- Uh-huh

170
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:45,041
- They're livin' at last, goin' steady
- He's gone

171
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:48,753
Hello, Mr. Henkel
This is Harvey Johnson

172
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,966
- Can I talk to Penelope Ann
- Is it true about Kim

173
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,966
- Penelope
- I just knew it somehow

174
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,717
- About the prom
- I must call her right up

175
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,719
- Saturday

176
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,100
- Goin' steady

177
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,850
- Goin' steady
- It's crazy, man

178
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,854
- Goin' steady
- You know it

179
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:10,234
- It won't last
- Not at all

180
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,277
- He's too thin
- She's too tall

181
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,990
Hello, Mrs. Miller
This is Harvey Johnson

182
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:21,203
Can I speak to Debra Sue

183
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:27,042
Hiya, Hugo
Hiya, stupid

184
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:30,544
- What ya wanna go get pinned for
- You don't know how to live

185
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,588
- Oh, you meathead
- You'd get pinned if you could

186
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,590
- Lost your marbles
- Kim and I are in love

187
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,092
- Are you nutty
- Goin' steady for

188
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:39,596
Hello, Mrs. Garfein
Is Charity home from school yet

00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,055
- Did they really get pinned
- Goin' steady

190
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:44,101
- I was hopin' they would
- He's gone

191
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:46,896
- Now they're livin' at last
- She nailed him

192
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,982
If ya gotta go
that's the way to go

193
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:53,528
When they got ya hooked
then you're really cooked

194
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,572
What ya gonna do
What ya gonna do

195
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:58,741
- Well, I heard they got pinned
- Oh, man

196
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,783
- I was thinkin' they would
- Oh, man

197
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,285
Now they're livin' at last
Goin' steady for good

198
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:06,914
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

199
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:10,335
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

200
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,547
He's in love with Kim
Kim's in love with him

201
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:18,009
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

202
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,723
That's the way it should be

203
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,725
- Oh, yeah
- They'll be happy, I know

204
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,728
- Oh, yeah
- Goin' steady for me

205
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,272
- Oh, yeah
- That's the way it should go

206
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,651
Goin' steady, goin' steady
Goin' steady, steady for good

207
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:56,383
Poor Pidge. He'll starve.

208
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:01,764
Here, Pidge. Here, Pidgie.
Here, boy.

209
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:12,481
Don't jump! Don't jump!
Albert, it's all right!

210
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:16,485
Everything's all right!
Come on back! Don't worry.

211
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:18,862
Honey, come on.

212
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:24,494
- Thank heavens I got here in time.
- You almost pushed me out.

213
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:26,830
It's all right.
I just came from Ed Sullivan's office.

214
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:28,040
- Sullivan?
- Yes, Ed Sullivan.

215
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:32,296
Go to work for Sullivan. Leap from the
sinking ship while the house is on fire.

216
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,174
But hear this, Miss DeLeon.
I was loyal.

217
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:38,219
All the years I employed you, I never
looked for a job behind your back.

218
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:41,052
- I went to Ed Sullivan's otfice...
- Don't explain.

219
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:44,848
You owe me nothing,
even though you were molded by me.

220
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:48,393
- Molded?
- Like Eliza Doolittle from Pygmalion.

221
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:51,521
- I was molded?
- What were you when I found you?

222
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:55,317
Hostess at La Casa Enchilada
Taco and Tamale Shop.

223
00:15:56,402 --> 00:16:01,075
Well, sorry I interrupted you.

224
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,993
A man of my ilk
does not commit suicide.

225
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:07,373
I've had just about enough
of your kind ot ilks too.

226
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:14,420
Suicide is for cowards.
I don't desert the woman I love.

227
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:22,052
Oh, Albert, I'm sorry.

228
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,476
- I should have known.
- Mama would never get over it.

229
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,146
Mama?

230
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:35,442
What's the matter?

231
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,821
I'm the prize dope ot all time...

232
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:41,241
thinking I could pry you away
from your mama's ever-lovin' tentacles.

233
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:44,036
I will thank you
to leave my mother out of this.

234
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,080
- Maybe she does influence me slightly.
- Slightly?

235
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,539
- She is old and frail.
- Which I will be, too, at this rate.

236
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:54,419
I don't blame you.
I was living in fantasy...

237
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,840
telling myself you were serious.

238
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:59,508
Oh, Rosie, I was.

239
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,552
I am. In here.

240
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,889
I've thought and thought
about marrying you...

241
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:08,768
every day, a lot of nights too.

242
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,938
I've spent six years
on Project Albert.

243
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:17,319
Well, now I haven't got the right.

244
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,948
I can't offer you security.

245
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,867
A wonderful girl like you...

246
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:32,624
you deserve more from a husband
than just personality and good looks.

247
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:42,303
But I'll always love you, Rosie.

248
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,981
You'd better always
love me, you nut...

249
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:54,772
because you're stuck with me.

250
00:17:57,023 --> 00:18:01,320
Now, you've always worried
about repaying your mother, right?

251
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,575
Well, from now on,
she'll be set for life.

252
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:08,870
She can sit around on her big fat trust
fund. We'll have our own little house...

253
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:12,250
I don't care what Sullivan pays you.
No woman is supporting Albert Peterson.

254
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,503
- You're not listening, darling.
- I am not a gigolo.

255
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:19,799
Will you get to that piano
and start composing?

256
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,553
- Mary, I want Kim McAfee, Ohio.
- I'm through composing.

257
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,639
I was always through,
but now I know it.

258
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,974
That's right. You're a biochemist,
but this is one song you can sell.

259
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,017
- Huh?
- Okay, call me back.

260
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,645
- As I was saying, huh?
- Gee, you're slow today.

261
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:36,272
Now, you are going to write
a song called "One Last Kiss."

262
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:40,027
Is this Albert's floor
or is it the one below?

263
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,283
"One Last Kiss." Now.

264
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:48,954
Oh, one last kiss
There never was such bliss

265
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,998
I love your dentifrice

266
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,918
- A little too clinical, I think.
- Yeah, you're right, honey. Let's see.

267
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:01,423
Mama? She's never been to the office
since she discovered canasta.

268
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,052
Well, now's the perfect time
to tell her about dissolving Almaelou.

269
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,221
Yeah.

270
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:09,557
- And about us.
- Yeah.

271
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,605
Sonny!

272
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,816
- Mama!
- Baby!

273
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,572
What a nice surprise, and you're
just in time for some wonderful news.

274
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:24,739
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, son.

275
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:27,118
I just fainted in the subway.
That's all.

276
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:29,161
But I didn't tall down.
It was too crowded.

277
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,582
- I keep tellin' ya, take a taxi.
- Taxis?

278
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:35,709
Taxis are for my successful son.

279
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,794
A dirty crowded subway
is good enough for a mother.

280
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,381
Mother's nothin' nowadays.

281
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:44,718
- Who's that?
- Mommy, you know Rose DeLeon.

282
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:50,225
- And guess what.
- This is that pretty Rose DeLeon?

283
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:53,477
Oh, I don't believe it.

284
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:56,607
Rose, what happened to ya?

285
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:59,402
You had a fatal sickness
or somethin'?

286
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:01,487
It's nice to see you again.

287
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:05,492
Always on the job.
She's a credit to the firm.

288
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,910
Look at her, son.

289
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:11,495
I wonder some older man
hasn't snatched her away.

290
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,956
Personable matron.

291
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,751
- Speaking ot marriage.
- A wonderful institution.

292
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,920
Your poor father and I...
That was a marriage.

293
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,256
May he rest in peace.

294
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,050
Don't worry, Lou.

295
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,887
- Our only child is taking care of me.
- Tell her.

296
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:30,641
He'd never do anything to break
my heart. What about marriage?

297
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:32,810
It it was good enough
for you and Papa, it's good enough...

298
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:36,522
In time. You're just a baby.

299
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:43,526
Hello. Yes, Operator.
I'll hold on.

300
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,824
And another thing, Mama,
I'm thinking of dissolving Almaelou.

301
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:50,619
Wait, Lou. I'm comin'.
I'll be right up there.

302
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,870
We can play canasta again.

303
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,333
Mama? Mama, forget it.
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:57,502
- You're sorry?
- Good-bye, sonny.

305
00:20:57,544 --> 00:21:00,130
Take care of yourself.
Think of me on Mother's Day.

306
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:02,131
- Good-bye, Rosie.
- Good-bye, Mae.

307
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:05,761
Call me Mrs. Peterson.
Wear your rubbers.

308
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:08,680
That's right, Operator.
Miss Kim McAfee.

309
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:18,271
I'll tell her, Rosie, tonight.

310
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:21,525
It's entirely up to you, Albert.
The line is still busy?

311
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:24,405
Yes, Hugo.

312
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:28,031
Well, of course
I'll always wear it on everything.

313
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:32,120
Oh, except my gym blouse.
Miss Turgnisht won't allow it.

314
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:35,082
Tonight?
Well, I have no plans.

315
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:37,917
I think I can get out
till about 10:00.

316
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:41,005
Oh, you have to be in by 9:00.

317
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,298
Well, c'est la vie.

318
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,885
Until tonight then, mon amour.

319
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:47,428
Bye.

320
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:59,688
When you're a skinny child of 15

321
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:03,193
Wired with braces from ear to ear

322
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:08,908
You doubt that
you will ever be appealing

323
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,414
Then, hallelujah, you are 16
and the braces disappear

324
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:18,085
And your skin is smooth and clear

325
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:22,295
And you have that happy grown-up

326
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:25,590
Female feeling

327
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:36,018
How lovely to be a woman

328
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,189
The wait was well worthwhile

329
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:42,442
How lovely to wear mascara

330
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:45,778
And smile a woman's smile

331
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,242
How lovely to have a figure

332
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,371
That's round instead of flat

333
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,704
Whenever you hear boys whistle

334
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:58,414
You're what they're whistling at

335
00:22:58,498 --> 00:23:01,585
It's wonderful to feel

336
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:04,713
The way a woman feels

337
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:08,802
It gives you such a glow
just to know

338
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,472
You're wearing
lipstick and heels

339
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:15,642
How lovely to be a woman

340
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:18,772
And have one job to do

341
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,065
To pick out a boy
and train him

342
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:25,321
And then when you are through

343
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,529
You've made him
the man you want him

344
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,699
To be

345
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:35,286
How lovely to be a woman

346
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,832
Like me

347
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,001
How wonderful to know

348
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,296
The things a woman knows

349
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,051
How marvelous to wait
for a date

350
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,387
In simply beautiful clothes

351
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,808
How lovely to be a woman

352
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:58,145
And change from boys to men

353
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,356
To go to a fancy nightclub

354
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,775
And stay out after 10:00

355
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:08,028
How lovely to be so grown up

356
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,281
And free

357
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:20,125
Life's lovely
when you're a woman

358
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:26,049
Like me

359
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,401
Hello? Oh? Well,
hold on, Operator.

360
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,653
Kim, it's for you.
She says it's long distance.

361
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,903
- Thank you, Doris.
- Who could be calling Kim...

362
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:52,700
- Did you say "Doris"?
- It's the modern way, dear.

363
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,703
Makes mother and daughter
more like friends.

364
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,540
Harry, I think you took the news
about Hugo and I awfully well. Hello?

365
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,585
- She called you "Harry."
- Yeah.

366
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:05,088
- Yes, this is Miss Kim McAfee.
- Yesterday I was a mother.

367
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,924
- Today I'm a friend.
- Yes, I'll hold on.

368
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,967
Well, maybe you could call me Mom.
That's modern.

369
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,557
Times are changing. You go along
or else you're out ot it.

370
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,892
Harry, do you have a cigarette?
I've run out.

371
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,772
Oh, so have I.
How about my pipe?

372
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,274
- Hello?
- Hello?

373
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,443
- Kim McAfee? I have a great prize.
- Harry? Kids.

374
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,865
You have been selected from all
the teenagers in the United States...

375
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:34,910
to be kissed by Conrad Birdie on
The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night.

376
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:37,121
We'll be in touch. Good-bye!

377
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,166
Conrad Birdie?

378
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:44,375
To kiss me?

379
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,094
Mother!

380
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,012
- Mommy!
- Baby! What happened?

381
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,055
Conrad Birdie's
coming here to kiss me!

382
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,312
- Isn't that nice?
- You don't understand!

383
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:03,814
Conrad Birdie's coming
to Sweet Apple to kiss me!

384
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:06,317
Oh, Mommy!

385
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,279
I never thought I'd say it,
but God bless Conrad Birdie!

386
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:18,660
Conrad Birdie's
coming here to kiss me!

387
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:32,050
Now, listen. Now,
the absolute instant he appears...

388
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,012
now I'll introduce Kim to him.

389
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:39,434
Then we'll all recite our pledge
of everlasting loyalty.

390
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,937
The plane!
The plane's almost landed!

391
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:50,444
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

392
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:54,198
We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

393
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,911
When you're not near us
we're blue

394
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:01,372
Oh, Conrad, we love you

395
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:05,251
We hate you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

396
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:09,131
We don't hate anyone
as much as you

397
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:12,884
Your singing makes us say, P.U.

398
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,389
Oh, Conrad, we hate you

399
00:27:16,431 --> 00:27:20,392
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

400
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:23,936
We don't hate anyone
as much as you

401
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,898
When you're not near us
we're blue

402
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,281
- We love you
- We hate you

403
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,578
Hugo wants to talk to Kim.

404
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,956
That's if it's okay with Kim.

405
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,585
- Certainly, Hugo.
- Well, Kim...

406
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,797
Yes?

407
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,893
Hugo, what do you want?

408
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:08,232
Gee, Kim, the fellows
are makin' me do this.

409
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,943
But just the same, they're right.

410
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:13,196
Kim, you can't
go through with this.

411
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,449
Hugo, please be mature.

412
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:18,493
Doesn't gettin' pinned
mean anything these days?

413
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:22,999
It means everything.
It's sacred.

414
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:27,795
Well, then how can you let
another man kiss you and in public?

415
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:31,128
- I assure you I won't even feel it.
- Huh?

416
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,299
- I'm just a symbol.
- A symbol?

417
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:39,471
Don't you see?
This is bigger than us.

418
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:43,102
Why, all this publicity
for Sweet Apple.

419
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:45,812
Thousands of people
will move here.

420
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:49,316
We'll have
a population explosion.

421
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:55,114
And just think what this will do
for your father's undertaking business.

422
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,829
- Hey, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

423
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:06,416
But you really don't go
tor that Birdie creep, do you?

424
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,003
What do my eyes tell you?

425
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:21,183
No, you don't.
I can see you're all mine.

426
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,852
Forever...

427
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:26,395
starting right atter
The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday night.

428
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:32,027
Right atter The Ed Sullivan Show
on Sunday night.

429
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:33,446
Hey, we'll be late!

430
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,071
One, two, three!

431
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:39,616
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

432
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:43,119
We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

433
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:47,082
When you're not near us
we're blue

434
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:56,093
Well, I told her off, guys.

435
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,763
- She knows where I stand.
- But she's leaving.

436
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:02,600
- That's to make the population explode.
- Anyone for the reception, kids?

437
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:06,355
Gee, Mr. Paisley, we think you're okay
even if you are the English teacher.

438
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,356
It should be
a fascinating experience.

439
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,148
- Yeah, but are you with them?
- "With them?"

440
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,985
Yeah, that Birdie creep...
He's poisoned our women.

441
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:16,947
It's bad enough the mayor's a fink,
but you, Mr. Paisley...

442
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,742
Well, you see, fellows, as a teacher
and a brand-new American citizen...

443
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,744
with an unquenchable thirst
for knowledge...

444
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:27,166
I feel I should witness this
unique sociological phenomenon, hmm?

445
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,629
Yeah, guys, suppose
I do let Kim kiss him?

446
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:38,261
I only want to see
a unique so... so...

447
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:40,306
phenomenon.

448
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,932
- Hugo, the fink!
- So long, fink!

449
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:48,688
- Fink!
- Oh, what a fink!

450
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:03,119
Here are the gentlemen from the press.
I'll handle them. You go find the mayor.

451
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:08,210
We want him! We want him!

452
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:10,754
Here's your speech.
Learn it and hurry!

453
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:14,048
We want him! We want him!

454
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:22,597
- Look this way, please.
- What's your name?

455
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,808
- Conrad Birdie.
- No, no, your name.

456
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,236
She doesn't even know her name.

457
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:44,579
"We want him!"

458
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:54,086
I beg your pardon.
May I add a welcome from Sweet Apple?

459
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,048
I'm Claude Paisley.
Kim McAfee's my student in English.

460
00:31:57,131 --> 00:32:00,468
- How do you do? I'm Rose DeLeon.
- Nice to know you.

461
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,473
- And you're?
- Hugo.

462
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,683
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.

463
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,438
- Hugo Fink.
- Hello, Mr. Fink. How are you?

464
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:13,150
Now, please
don't think me forward.

465
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:16,237
But it you do have any spare time
during your visit...

466
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,532
I'd appreciate discussing
Mr. Birdie with you.

467
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:24,494
Well, I'm afraid
I'll be very busy...

468
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,537
but thank you.

469
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:33,920
Watch it, Rube.
Don't bend the fur.

470
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:38,550
He's coming! Look, everybody!
He's coming! Here he comes!

471
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,484
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

472
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:57,444
We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

473
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:01,948
When you're not near us
we're blue

474
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:06,119
Oh, Conrad, we love you

475
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,164
Betore you hear
from the girl upon whom...

476
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:51,208
you have chosen to bestow
your final kiss upon...

477
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:56,172
we will now recite
the Conrad Birdie pledge.

478
00:33:57,297 --> 00:34:01,135
I, being of
sound mind and body...

479
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:03,219
do hereby promise...

480
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:07,973
to be loyal, courteous,
steadfast and true...

481
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:12,478
to Conrad Birdie
and the United States of America...

482
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,193
both indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

483
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,994
As the fortunate girl
whom you have selected...

484
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:30,541
to represent all my fellow girls,
I welcome you.

485
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,358
Now, Mayor, now.

486
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,652
Speech here.

487
00:34:57,734 --> 00:35:02,615
And now I present this key
to our city to our honored guest...

488
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:04,867
Conrad Birdie.

489
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,037
He said it!
He said the name!

490
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:16,835
What happened?
All I said was Conrad Birdie.

491
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:22,759
Girls, you're going to have to stop that
or I can't finish my speech.

492
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:25,596
Who cares about your speech?

493
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,640
We want to hear Conrad!

494
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,608
He's not so much.

495
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:44,907
You gotta be sincere

496
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,158
Edna, what's wrong?

497
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:50,370
You gotta be sincere

498
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:53,165
Birdie, what are you doin'?

499
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:55,543
You gotta feel it here

500
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:58,253
'Cause if you feel it here

501
00:35:58,295 --> 00:36:00,924
Well, then you're gonna be

502
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:06,220
Honestly sincere

503
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:13,480
If what you feel is true

504
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:17,773
You really feel it
You make them feel it too

505
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:22,612
Write this down now
You gotta be sincere

506
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:24,946
Honestly sincere

507
00:36:24,988 --> 00:36:27,824
Man, you've gotta be

508
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:33,330
Sincere

509
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:38,463
If you're really sincere
If you're really sincere

510
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:41,466
If you feel it in here
then it's gotta be right

511
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:43,384
Oh, baby

512
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,387
Oh, honey

513
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,431
Hug me

514
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:50,098
Ah, suffer

515
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:57,188
In everything I do

516
00:36:57,272 --> 00:37:00,734
Why, my sincerity shows through

517
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:05,823
Yeah, when I look you in the eye
I don't even have to try

518
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:09,995
It's automatic
I'm sincere

519
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:14,207
When I sing about a tree

520
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,669
Listen, why
I really feel that tree

521
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:21,423
Yeah, when I sing about a girl

522
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,423
I really feel that girl

523
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,008
I mean, I really feel

524
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:30,513
Sincere

525
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,225
Why, if you're really sincere

526
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,229
If you're really sincere

527
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:39,149
If you feel it in here
then it's gotta be right

528
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:41,150
Oh, baby

529
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:43,027
Oh, honey

530
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:45,073
Hug me

531
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:46,866
Ah, suffer

532
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:50,077
Yeah, here we go now

533
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:53,331
Why, you gotta be sincere

534
00:37:53,414 --> 00:37:57,208
Oh, you gotta feel it here

535
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,127
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby

536
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,005
Oh, yeah

537
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:05,634
Oh, my baby, oh, yeah

538
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,176
Go, girl, go

539
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,845
Ursula! What are you doing?

540
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:15,229
Are you gonna be sincere
Are you gonna be sincere

541
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,563
Yeah

542
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:18,982
Are you gonna be sincere
Are you gonna be sincere

543
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:20,356
Yeah

544
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:34,934
We love you, Conrad

545
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:38,893
Oh, yes, we do

546
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:43,066
We love you, Conrad

547
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:47,195
And we'll be true

548
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:51,658
When you're not near us

549
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:55,497
We're blue

550
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:01,044
Oh, Conrad, we love you

551
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,630
Randolph, your father's warned you.

552
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:06,175
It you make another bomb,
you'll get spanked.

553
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:12,054
- It was an accident, Mom.
- Now, get this stuff out ot here.

554
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,392
Doris! Doris!

555
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,024
Doris, what's going on here?

556
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:25,150
Harry, where have
you been since supper?

557
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:27,696
In plenty of trouble, that's where.
But I'm not now. No, sirree.

558
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:30,074
You kids go home before
I sick the constable on ya!

559
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:33,201
Go on! Get that carnival
off my front lawn!

560
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:34,953
I'll show them who's boss.

561
00:40:35,037 --> 00:40:38,499
Harry McAfee's not going to be
pushed around by any roll and rocker.

562
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:41,585
- Harry, they'll hear you.
- Let 'em hear me!

563
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:45,546
- Put those chemicals away and go to bed.
- Yes, Papa.

564
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,052
We're in trouble.
He can't stand Conrad living here.

565
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,393
Especially around
his pretty young daughter.

566
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,399
She's still under the magic spell.

567
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:11,158
Dear little Conrad certainly
has a devastating impact.

568
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,827
He might make a terrific soldier.

569
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,495
Turn him loose and the enemy
will twitch itselt to death.

570
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,913
I don't care.
I've changed my mind.

571
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:21,667
My daughter is not going to be
publicly kissed by that... that wiggler.

572
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,127
The deal is off.

573
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:26,131
But, dear, you know these adolescents.
Kim will lose face.

574
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:29,425
It I don't get rid of that Birdie,
that's not all she'll...

575
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:36,266
Hear this. I have decided that bunch
of grafters is getting out of here.

576
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:40,311
That is the unshakable decree that
I have made as head of this household.

577
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:42,606
- So you go upstairs and tell them.
- Me?

578
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,442
How can I tell Mr. Peterson
and that nice Miss DeLeon?

579
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:49,780
Nice? I know that show business crowd...
probably living in sin.

580
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:52,115
Harry Lionel McAfee!

581
00:41:52,197 --> 00:41:54,741
I never told you, but one summer
I worked tor the circus.

582
00:41:54,824 --> 00:41:57,328
- Oh, those midgets, wild.
- Not another word.

583
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:00,206
She's been engaged to Peterson
for six years. Don't tell me they...

584
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:04,336
- We were engaged for tive years.
- He's not as stupid as I was.

585
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:06,839
- Are you stupid, Pop?
- Find out for yourself!

586
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:08,883
That's the trouble
with kids today! Lazy!

587
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:12,387
Will you go up? Get up to bed!

588
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:16,308
Oh, Harry, they'll be gone
day atter tomorrow.

589
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:19,854
I'm a peace-loving man,
a good father and husband.

590
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:22,021
And the result?

591
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:27,025
The home I hewed out of this wilderness
with my bare hands is no longer mine.

592
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:30,320
Tonight I had to wait
until 6:00 for my supper.

593
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:34,075
And that Peterson grafter, running up
my phone bill with long-distance calls!

594
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:38,328
- He offered to reimburse you.
- I don't take Diners Club cards!

595
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:43,877
Then that snake in a gold suit insists
on parking in my beautiful living room.

596
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,339
- Do you know where I've just been?
- No, dear.

597
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:51,177
To a meeting with the big boys,
Kelsey, Judge Blanch, Joe Kipp.

598
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,430
My biggest customers. They don't approve
of this kind of notorious goings-on.

599
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:57,431
Darling, they put pressure on you?

600
00:42:57,514 --> 00:43:02,644
If I don't cancel this whole Birdie
deal, they'll starve me out of business.

601
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:06,231
- Oh, my heavens!
- It's them or us.

602
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:16,367
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

603
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:18,455
- What's wrong?
- It was just Randolph's chemicals.

604
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:23,001
No, a mixture ot iron sultide
plus two parts H2SO4.

605
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:25,587
Smart boy you have there. It isn't
every lad who can make a stench bomb.

606
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,465
- Which brings me to Mr. Birdie.
- Mr. Peterson is really a biochemist.

607
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:32,133
- I couldn't care less.
- I have one formula, a secret.

608
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:35,887
It's miraculous because it increases
the work output of domestic animals.

609
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:38,431
- Now about this Birdie.
- It speeds up the reflexes.

610
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,435
An ox, for instance,
could outrun a racehorse.

611
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:43,853
By adding in his tormula,
a hen will lay three eggs a day.

612
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:46,482
Three eggs a day? It that's so,
you could make a million times...

613
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:48,819
I've been nursing
this compound for years.

614
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:51,947
- Still needs more tests, but it works.
- Aren't you in farming?

615
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,239
- He's McAfee Fertilizer.
- Oh, yes.

616
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:56,242
- Been in it tor 20 years.
- Really?

617
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:57,827
But I may be out if...

618
00:43:57,911 --> 00:44:01,749
It you and Albert got together,
you could revolutionize farm production.

619
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,999
Would you like a demonstration?
Do you have a hen?

620
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,960
- How about trying it on that?
- A tortoise? I don't know.

621
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:10,881
Sure! It won't bite.
Here. Let me.

622
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:17,305
Ot course, there isn't
much demand for turtle eggs.

623
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,141
But if it really works
on farm animals...

624
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,269
maybe you and me
could do some business.

625
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:29,360
I'll sure need something it I let Kim
go through with this Birdie stuff.

626
00:44:29,444 --> 00:44:31,863
Some of Harry's customers
are against it.

627
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:34,616
Yeah, and so I've decided
it's absolutely out of the question.

628
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,909
Your neighbors are just
going to be thrilled...

629
00:44:36,993 --> 00:44:41,245
when they see the two of you
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

630
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,330
The Ed Sullivan Show.

631
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:47,586
- We were saving that as a surprise.
- Yes, a surprise.

632
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:49,671
Me on Ed Sullivan?

633
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:51,756
Oh, I'd die. What would I wear?

634
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,800
- We'll find something.
- Gee, Ed Sullivan.

635
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,469
He's my favorite human.

636
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:58,973
That's why I decided to let Kim go on
in the first place.

637
00:44:59,015 --> 00:45:01,349
Me on The Ed Sullivan Show?

638
00:45:02,435 --> 00:45:04,813
Ed Sullivan

639
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:09,150
Me, Harry McAfee appearing with

640
00:45:09,233 --> 00:45:12,027
Ed Sullivan

641
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:44,977
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan

642
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:51,275
How could any family be

643
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,530
Half as fortunate as we

644
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:59,325
We'll be coast to coast

645
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:02,831
With our favorite host

646
00:46:16,427 --> 00:46:21,346
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan

647
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,978
I've got a wonderful wife

648
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:32,401
Two swell kids
a good business and now this

649
00:46:33,653 --> 00:46:36,697
Someday we'll recall

650
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,869
The greatest day of all

651
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:42,872
Ed, I love you.

652
00:47:00,305 --> 00:47:02,056
Hello?

653
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:06,269
Oh, yes. Harry,
it's the mayor. He sounds mad.

654
00:47:07,312 --> 00:47:09,274
I'll handle this.

655
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:13,068
Yes? Yes, Mayor?

656
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:15,445
Yes, the boys talked to me.

657
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:19,825
Yep, I've decided.
Birdie stays right here...

658
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:21,995
and Kim's on TV.

659
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:23,621
And what's more...

660
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:27,872
I'm gonna be on the show, too,
with Eddy Sullivan.

661
00:47:27,956 --> 00:47:32,795
Now, listen, Harry. You saw what
that crazy galoot did at the reception.

662
00:47:34,338 --> 00:47:36,883
It was a disgrace.

663
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:41,346
Look, Mayor,
you're gonna be on TV too.

664
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:44,141
They want you to make a speech.

665
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:49,356
They want me on Ed Sullivan?

666
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,361
A short speech.
Why, sure!

667
00:47:56,195 --> 00:47:59,573
I could become
a statewide tace.

668
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:01,658
It's a deal, Mayor.

669
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:04,494
Sure I'll plug you up tor governor.

670
00:48:04,578 --> 00:48:06,915
Bye, Sam.

671
00:48:06,998 --> 00:48:08,415
What a hambo.

672
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,421
Well, it's been a long day,
so I think we'll...

673
00:48:23,098 --> 00:48:25,642
I'm thinking of calling them "Speed Up."
You like it, Mr. McAfee?

674
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:28,522
"Feed up with Speed Up."
I love it, partner.

675
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,607
- How will Randolph catch his tortoise?
- Just give him one of these.

676
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,525
Hi, Mr. McAfee.
Gee, I just wanted to thank you.

677
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:40,030
My dad said you're not letting Kim
go on TV and kiss that... that.

678
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:45,995
It can't be true. You wouldn't
destroy Kim, your own flesh and blood!

679
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,873
Sure he would.
A father has a right, right?

680
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:52,211
Hugo, my daughter's old enough
to make her own decisions...

681
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:54,798
so I've decided to let her do it.

682
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,928
Well, in that case, your daughter
is the former future Mrs. Hugo Peabody.

683
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:02,389
Oh, Hugo,
stop acting like a child.

684
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:05,056
Kim! Where is he?
Can I see him?

685
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:07,057
Conrad's asleep, poor dear.

686
00:49:07,098 --> 00:49:09,186
You may peek through
his keyhole while I...

687
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:13,065
while I discuss this tempest
in a tea bag with Hugo.

688
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,332
You're lucky people.

689
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,919
What'd we ever do
to deserve such a daughter?

690
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,923
We got married.

691
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:37,633
Marriage.

692
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:38,799
- But, Kim...
- Hugo...

693
00:49:38,882 --> 00:49:41,051
- Yeah, but, Kim...
- I don't have time for a debate.

694
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:43,678
Ursula's waiting. I've got to learn
my speech tor tomorrow's rehearsal.

695
00:49:43,762 --> 00:49:47,724
Wait a minute, Kim.
Don't go yet, please.

696
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:51,688
You don't know what I've been through
with all the guys buggin' me...

697
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:54,233
well, about you
and that Birdie creep.

698
00:49:54,316 --> 00:49:56,276
Oh, that.

699
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:57,861
Yeah, that!

700
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:02,074
Why, that's silly.
He means nothing to me.

701
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:08,374
One boy

702
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:13,584
One special boy

703
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:16,630
One boy to go with

704
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,969
To talk with and walk with

705
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,553
One boy

706
00:50:23,637 --> 00:50:28,476
That's the way it should be

707
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,271
Yeah, yeah,
that's the way it should be.

708
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:34,398
One boy

709
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,985
One certain boy

710
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,696
One boy to laugh with

711
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:43,450
To joke with, have Coke with

712
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:46,201
One boy

713
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:51,248
Not two or three

714
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:57,046
One day

715
00:50:57,129 --> 00:51:00,342
You'll find out

716
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:05,305
This is what life is all about

717
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:08,892
You need

718
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:12,104
Someone who

719
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:14,732
Is living

720
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:18,567
Just for you

721
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:22,029
One boy

722
00:51:22,071 --> 00:51:24,365
One steady boy

723
00:51:24,406 --> 00:51:27,035
One boy to be with

724
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:30,538
Forever and ever

725
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:33,541
One boy

726
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:38,881
That's the way it should be

727
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:41,924
That's the way

728
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:46,138
It should be

729
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:57,732
Now is that the kiss of a woman
interested in any other man?

730
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:03,864
I don't know.
How do I tell?

731
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:11,831
- Ah, but he made you faint.
- Oh, he did not!

732
00:52:11,914 --> 00:52:15,585
I was just exhausted,
cramming for my English exam.

733
00:52:19,465 --> 00:52:24,678
You've got to try
to understand me as a woman.

734
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:28,055
Now, I might like
Conrad as a friend...

735
00:52:28,138 --> 00:52:30,432
but when it comes
to the real thing...

736
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:35,105
the grand passion...

737
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:39,150
well, that's something
special, Hugo.

738
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:41,069
That's you.

739
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:47,034
One day you'll find out

740
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:50,579
This is what life is all about

741
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:55,294
You need someone who

742
00:52:55,377 --> 00:53:02,047
Is living just for you

743
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,802
One boy, one steady boy

744
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:09,221
One boy to be with

745
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:11,934
Forever and ever

746
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:14,813
One boy

747
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:19,902
That's the way it should be

748
00:53:21,403 --> 00:53:24,323
That's the way

749
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:30,245
It should be

750
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:37,126
Homework!
Hey, I got homework to do.

751
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:56,396
When will he find out

752
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,360
This is what life is all about

753
00:54:02,779 --> 00:54:07,655
Will he ever see

754
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,536
I need him

755
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,663
And he

756
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:19,378
Needs me

757
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:23,549
- One boy
- One special boy

758
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:27,304
- One special boy
- One boy to be with always

759
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:29,556
One boy to be with

760
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,478
- Forever and ever
- Forever

761
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:38,563
- I love him
- One boy

762
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:42,192
- Love him, I love
- That's the way

763
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:46,905
- Him so
- It should be

764
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:51,077
That's the way

765
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,540
It should be

766
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:03,757
That's the way

767
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:10,806
It should be

768
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:31,576
Hello, Sweet Apple Drive-in?

769
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,373
I'm looking for my mother,
Mrs. Peterson.

770
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,585
Are you sure there's no one left
in your drive-in? Okay, thank you.

771
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,380
Don't worry, partner.
Your mother will get along fine.

772
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,839
Sweet Apple's
full of friendly folk.

773
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,800
It anything happens to her,
I'll never forgive myself.

774
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:49,010
- What kind of a dump is this?
- "Dump"?

775
00:55:49,093 --> 00:55:51,471
Conrad. Let's humor him, partner.

776
00:55:51,554 --> 00:55:53,807
If he walks off
the Sullivan show, we're sunk.

777
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,309
Gotcha.

778
00:55:57,978 --> 00:56:00,522
I can't tind no church key
in my room.

779
00:56:00,606 --> 00:56:03,986
Church key? We've had
a church here, but it's open.

780
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:08,489
A can opener, man.
You're from nowherelike.

781
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,835
That's my favorite brand.

782
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:26,214
Well, it's bedtime, huh, Conrad?

783
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:32,722
Okay for tonight,
but tomorrow's Saturday...

784
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,225
and that's my real tense night.

785
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:47,489
Thanks, Mr. McAfee.

786
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:51,701
The next time I have a daughter,
I hope it's a boy.

787
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,785
I am a lucky man though, Albert.

788
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,287
Meeting up with
a biochemical wizard.

789
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,707
Peterson and McAfee
are going right to the moon.

790
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,837
I've got to, not just
for my mother, for Rosie.

791
00:57:10,763 --> 00:57:13,472
Well, I guess I'll get
a little air and turn in.

792
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,723
Take all the air you want, chum.

793
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,075
Hi, Rosie.

794
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:40,249
Rosie, you don't have
to worry about Mama. She'll show up.

795
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:43,168
- I'm certain she will.
- Then you ought to be happy.

796
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:45,922
Kim's on the show.
Conrad does my song...

797
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:48,759
and I promise
I'll tell Mama about us.

798
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:52,430
Come on.

799
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:07,443
Why look so awfully tragic

800
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,113
Put on a happy face

801
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,907
Smiling can work like magic

802
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:15,577
Put on a happy face

803
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:18,706
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy

804
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,042
It's not your style

805
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:26,465
You look so good that
you'll be glad ya decided to smile

806
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:29,218
Pick out a pleasant outlook

807
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:31,845
Stick out that noble chin

808
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:34,845
Wipe off the full of doubt look

809
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,849
Slap on a happy grin

810
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:42,145
And spread sunshine
all over the place

811
00:58:42,187 --> 00:58:46,651
Just put on a happy face

812
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:53,241
Flowers?

813
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:55,995
Put on a happy face

814
00:58:58,373 --> 00:59:01,000
Put on a happy face

815
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:03,835
Why do you mope around so sourly

816
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,086
It's such a strain

817
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,006
I always try to chuckle hourly

818
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:11,633
It clears the brain

819
00:59:14,053 --> 00:59:16,514
I knew a girl so gloomy

820
00:59:16,555 --> 00:59:18,682
She'd never laugh or sing

821
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:21,477
She wouldn't listen to me

822
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,772
Now she's a mean old thing

823
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:26,191
So spread sunshine

824
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:29,068
All over the place

825
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,156
Put on a happy

826
01:00:45,147 --> 01:00:48,231
So put on a happy

827
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:53,069
Face

828
01:01:09,673 --> 01:01:14,136
Well, like I said,
you're a genius, Dr. Peterson.

829
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:16,472
Oh, honey,
you sure have put up with a lot.

830
01:01:16,556 --> 01:01:18,473
But this time we're gonna make it!

831
01:01:18,556 --> 01:01:20,766
Let's live in a small town
like this.

832
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,393
- Anything you say, dear.
- Okay?

833
01:01:23,477 --> 01:01:26,229
Wow, the last time
we were alone together...

834
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:28,650
last summer at Palisades Park.

835
01:01:28,733 --> 01:01:31,902
- We went through the tunnel of love.
- Your mother sat between us.

836
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:34,947
Oh, honey, I told you. From now on,
things are gonna be different.

837
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:39,328
- Yoo-hoo! Albert!
- It's Mama.

838
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:41,329
Mama?

839
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,504
Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl...

840
01:01:48,545 --> 01:01:50,505
boy gets mother.

841
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:59,388
- Mama, where have ya been?
- Neglected! That's where I've been.

842
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:02,349
I tried to find ya.
Have you had any dinner?

843
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:06,855
A mother doesn't need tood. Besides,
I'd rather be with my famous son.

844
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:09,648
Albert, what is it?
Oh, it's your mother.

845
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:12,235
- Oh, good evening!
- How are ya, ma'am?

846
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:17,158
How can I be... ripped from
my native land, alone in this jungle?

847
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,827
Gosh, Albert, I wish we had room
to put up your mother.

848
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:24,123
Thanks. A motel mattress full of lumps
is good enough tor me.

849
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,624
Comtort is for my loving son.

850
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:34,883
I just came to tuck ya into bed.

851
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:37,885
See, Mama's got a condition.
She won't tell me what it is.

852
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:40,763
Why worry a growing boy?

853
01:02:40,846 --> 01:02:43,976
Okay. You insist?

854
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,730
I got, maybe,
one tenth a normal heart.

855
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:50,065
A mother doesn't need a heart.

856
01:02:50,107 --> 01:02:52,903
Well, soon as Albert and I get
our new deal a-rollin'...

857
01:02:52,945 --> 01:02:55,405
you'll have the finest doctors
in the country.

858
01:02:55,489 --> 01:02:59,159
Deal? What deal, Albert?

859
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:04,120
Well, Mama, I'm quitting the music
business and goin' back to chemistry.

860
01:03:04,203 --> 01:03:08,124
That Rosie!
She's finally turned you against me!

861
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:10,251
Oh, please, Mama. She didn't.

862
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,505
Albert, go... desert me.

863
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:15,342
But when I was expecting him
in the maternity ward...

864
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:17,510
three days I waited...
did I desert him?

865
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:22,391
No. I stayed right there so
he wouldn't be alone when he was born.

866
01:03:22,433 --> 01:03:25,644
Mama, please don't excite yourself.
Mama, you know I love ya.

867
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:28,482
- It's just Rosie and I have plans.
- Okay!

868
01:03:28,565 --> 01:03:32,983
Lou, I'll be right up.

869
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:34,985
Start dealing.

870
01:03:37,196 --> 01:03:41,953
Just bury me on your front lawn
so Rosie can walk all over me!

871
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:47,456
Mama! Mama, please!

872
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:49,752
It's not gas. It's electric.

873
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,255
Doris!

874
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:58,595
Doris, how do you like it?
Isn't it exciting?

875
01:03:58,636 --> 01:04:02,390
No! I told you
not to dye your hair!

876
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:05,101
Oh, but I wanted to!
Isn't it a gas?

877
01:04:05,977 --> 01:04:09,561
- You dare defy your mother?
- But it's my hair.

878
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,899
- Not till you're 21.
- What's the matter, Papa?

879
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:16,152
Young lady, you stay in your room
till it changes back! Do you hear?

880
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:19,156
- I won't!
- I demand respect around here.

881
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,994
- It's my hair!
- Respect. Do you hear? Respect.

882
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:25,997
- I respect you, Papa.
- I don't want your respect.

883
01:04:26,164 --> 01:04:29,668
Who wants respect
from a ten-year-old kid?

884
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:33,965
Kids, I don't know what's wrong
with these kids today

885
01:04:34,006 --> 01:04:38,427
Kids, who can understand
anything they say

886
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:42,512
Kids, they are disobedient
disrespectful oats

887
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:45,933
Noisy, crazy, sloppy, lazy loafers

888
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,935
And while we're on the sub ject, kids

889
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:51,189
You can talk and talk
till your face is blue

890
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:55,402
Kids, but they still do
just what they want to do

891
01:04:55,485 --> 01:04:57,696
Why can't they be like we were

892
01:04:57,781 --> 01:04:59,990
Perfect in every way

893
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:03,242
What's the matter with kids today

894
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:08,207
Kids, I've tried to raise you
the best I could

895
01:05:08,249 --> 01:05:12,960
Kids, all the things I've done
were for your own good

896
01:05:13,044 --> 01:05:17,381
Kids, can't you once appreciate
how I've sacrificed

897
01:05:17,423 --> 01:05:20,509
Working, slaving, scrimping
saving pennies

898
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:22,679
And livin' with your father, kids

899
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,100
No one knows the burdens I've had
to bear, and in my condition

900
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:29,229
Kids, I'm a poor, sick woman
and does he care

901
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:32,523
Ha!
Go on, go on and kill me

902
01:05:32,565 --> 01:05:34,652
That's what it's coming to

903
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:38,072
When a mother has kids like you

904
01:05:39,406 --> 01:05:42,327
- Kids
- All the chicken soup I made for you

905
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,412
- Mama, take it easy.
- Kids

906
01:05:44,494 --> 01:05:47,955
- Now you throw me out like a worn shoe
- Not in front of everybody.

907
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:52,083
Mom, after all, I haven't been
such an awful son

908
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:55,589
I never sass you back
or leave a ring around the bathtub

909
01:05:55,631 --> 01:05:57,673
- And don't I always phone you
- Kids

910
01:05:57,757 --> 01:06:00,967
You can give your life to 'em
night and day

911
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:03,513
- Kids, then they go get married
- Married?

912
01:06:03,597 --> 01:06:05,558
- And go away
- Who's gettin' married?

913
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:07,769
Why do we have these children

914
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:11,271
Better to have a pet
You know where you stand with a pet.

915
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:16,068
I never asked for nothin'

916
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,070
Nothin' is what you'll get

917
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:21,155
What's the matter with kids to...

918
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:23,198
I tried, Lou, but I failed.

919
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:25,159
Oh, ya didn't, Mama.
Ya didn't.

920
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:28,120
Don't try to pay me back, sonny.
I forgive you.

921
01:06:28,203 --> 01:06:31,039
So what if you're an ingrate?
So long as you're happy.

922
01:06:31,123 --> 01:06:33,043
- I don't want to be happy.
- Don't feel guilty.

923
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:36,963
Just make believe I'm an old used car.
Junk me. Leave me in the gutter.

924
01:06:37,046 --> 01:06:39,383
- I'll never leave ya. Never.
- You heard him.

925
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:41,303
- You're a witness.
- I promise, Mama.

926
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:44,139
- I never broke promise to my mama.
- Good boy.

927
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:46,266
Why can't they be like Albert

928
01:06:46,308 --> 01:06:48,269
Perfect in every way

929
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,730
What's the matter with kids

930
01:06:50,814 --> 01:06:52,773
Yeah, what's the matter with kids

931
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:56,817
Nothing's the matter with kids today

932
01:06:59,402 --> 01:07:02,282
Mr. Paisley, this is Rose DeLeon.

933
01:07:02,324 --> 01:07:04,825
You asked me to call
it I had any tree time.

934
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:07,244
Well, I'm free.

935
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,664
- Very tree.
- Rosie!

936
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:13,461
Ten minutes?
I'll be waiting tor you.

937
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,300
Don't worry, sonny.
You can always get another secretary.

938
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:28,848
Can you see him?

939
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:31,977
- No. Babette, can you see him?
- I can't see him.

940
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,773
All I can see is the basketball hoop.
Hey, Gretch, can you see him?

941
01:07:35,856 --> 01:07:38,651
Conrad Birdie in our gym!

942
01:07:38,693 --> 01:07:43,032
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss

943
01:07:43,116 --> 01:07:45,784
One last kiss

944
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:49,622
Oh, one more time
Mmm, baby, one more time

945
01:07:49,706 --> 01:07:53,877
It really is sublime
Ah, baby, so sublime

946
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:56,213
You know I need your love

947
01:07:56,255 --> 01:08:00,215
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss

948
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:03,593
One last kiss

949
01:08:03,676 --> 01:08:07,180
Baby

950
01:08:07,222 --> 01:08:11,393
Give me one last kiss

951
01:08:11,476 --> 01:08:16,232
Baby

952
01:08:16,315 --> 01:08:19,903
Give me one last kiss

953
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:25,408
Oh, one last kiss

954
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,578
Give me one last kiss

955
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:29,580
It never felt like this

956
01:08:29,663 --> 01:08:31,957
Nah, baby, not like this

957
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,083
You know I need your love

958
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:36,876
- Oh, oh, oh
- Okay. Cut.

959
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:39,588
We'll rehearse
the song later, Conrad.

960
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:44,592
- Al, what's the exact length?
- Oh, uh, 1:20.

961
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:48,181
Check. That gives us 2:40
for Sullivan's intro to Kim...

962
01:08:48,264 --> 01:08:50,182
Kim's good luck speech to Conrad.

963
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:52,602
Then Conrad socks over a plug
for army enlistments...

964
01:08:52,644 --> 01:08:56,024
bangs into the song, and we top it off
with the big kisseroo.

965
01:08:56,108 --> 01:08:58,735
- Kim?
- Yes, sir.

966
01:09:00,485 --> 01:09:03,240
Beg pardon,
but when do I make my speech?

967
01:09:03,282 --> 01:09:05,241
Speech? What speech?

968
01:09:05,282 --> 01:09:08,993
I promised Mr. McAfee he could say a few
words. After all, he's Kim's father.

969
01:09:09,075 --> 01:09:12,496
- Yes, he is.
- Kind of a hello from a proud parent.

970
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,499
All right,
but ya can't have much time.

971
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:17,252
In fact, all you can have is 20 seconds
on the nose.

972
01:09:17,293 --> 01:09:20,505
Gotcha. I'll just say a few words,
get some big laughs.

973
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:23,300
- And introduce the mayor.
- The mayor?

974
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:27,889
- Ah, come on, Al. What is this?
- I... We had a problem.

975
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:30,807
I had to give the mayor a spot
to humor McAfee.

976
01:09:30,849 --> 01:09:34,938
All right, but we'll have to take
ten seconds away from McAtee.

977
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,317
I imagine songwriting must be
quite a lucrative profession.

978
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,318
- Oh, yes it is.
- How many records will they sell?

979
01:09:41,402 --> 01:09:43,444
Oh, about one or two million.

980
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:46,573
You know, Claude, I had a pertectly
wonderful time last night.

981
01:09:46,656 --> 01:09:49,075
- You really are a wonderful dancer.
- Oh, I don't know.

982
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:51,661
When one's heart sings,
one's feet take wings.

983
01:09:51,744 --> 01:09:54,082
Oh, how lyrical.
Is that Shelley or Keats?

984
01:09:54,165 --> 01:09:56,502
- That, my dear, is Paisley.
- Really?

985
01:09:56,543 --> 01:09:58,587
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

986
01:09:59,671 --> 01:10:01,591
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

987
01:10:05,386 --> 01:10:07,597
Okay, everybody. Take your places.

988
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,017
Now come on, Kim.
Just move right over there.

989
01:10:10,058 --> 01:10:12,351
Just read it like
you normally would. Okay.

990
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:16,102
And we, your admirers, are proud that
our military leaders have called upon...

991
01:10:16,185 --> 01:10:18,106
- Conrad, honey!
- Please, Mrs. Peterson.

992
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:20,107
We're rehearsing.

993
01:10:20,191 --> 01:10:22,527
All right now, Kim.

994
01:10:22,612 --> 01:10:25,029
Could you move over one, please?

995
01:10:26,697 --> 01:10:30,035
Kim, you're talking too fast.
Now once more, dear, but slower.

996
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:34,415
- To express to you...
- Tell me, Mrs. Peterson.

997
01:10:34,498 --> 01:10:37,542
- What does your husband do?
- I don't know. He's dead.

998
01:10:38,628 --> 01:10:42,173
And, and, and I want to say...

999
01:10:42,256 --> 01:10:47,636
on behalf of all the girls
who are your devoted admirers...

1000
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:50,679
- Oh, I forgot what's next.
- Come on, man. Let's go.

1001
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:53,308
- Hi, Hugo.
- They don't want all this jazz.

1002
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:54,976
- Yeah.
- They want Conrad.

1003
01:10:55,059 --> 01:10:58,730
Look. There's the camera.
I bail in, I sing up a storm...

1004
01:10:58,771 --> 01:11:01,067
I give this chick the message...

1005
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:05,905
This is my best side.

1006
01:11:05,946 --> 01:11:07,365
- Applause.
- She's fainted.

1007
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:10,411
- I'll dig you later.
- Hey, enough! I'm puttin' my foot down!

1008
01:11:10,494 --> 01:11:12,747
My baby!

1009
01:11:12,789 --> 01:11:14,916
Now I'm puttin' my foot down.
She's not goin' on that show!

1010
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:17,961
Oh, yes, she is.
You're not wreckin' my career.

1011
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:20,335
- Oh, what happened?
- Tell him you're through...

1012
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:24,048
because you do not wish to humiliate
your steady in this sordid fashion.

1013
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:26,468
Hugo Peabody, you take that back!

1014
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,719
I will not,
but I will take my pin back.

1015
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:31,222
Oh, with pleasure.

1016
01:11:39,774 --> 01:11:42,818
Conrad, I know you're tense,
but we haven't finished.

1017
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:45,446
- The number's not ready.
- Conrad's a trooper, like I was.

1018
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:48,324
- Us troopers get tense.
- Yeah. Like she said, like.

1019
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:51,577
Conrad, why don't you and I
go for a nice ride in the country?

1020
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:55,413
Uh-uh. Man, I hope
I never get that tense.

1021
01:11:58,707 --> 01:12:01,085
I never should have said that
to Rosie.

1022
01:12:01,126 --> 01:12:04,672
- Who does he think he is anyway?
- AI, I got a wire here from Ed Sullivan.

1023
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:07,969
"Russian Ballet switching to different
dance requiring additional four minutes.

1024
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,513
Therefore, the entire Birdie spot
must be cut to less than 30 seconds."

1025
01:12:11,596 --> 01:12:13,516
- Cut?
- "Tell Peterson and Rosie...

1026
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:16,562
I'm sorry song is out,
but no choice."

1027
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:19,148
No. They can't do this.
They can't cut the song.

1028
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:23,152
They've already done it, kid. In 30
seconds all Birdie can do is take a bow.

1029
01:12:23,236 --> 01:12:25,154
I'm awfully sorry.

1030
01:12:26,488 --> 01:12:28,364
The Russians!

1031
01:12:28,447 --> 01:12:32,118
First they take Czechoslovakia,
and now they take my four minutes.

1032
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,495
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, baby!

1033
01:12:36,038 --> 01:12:39,333
Well, that's, that's show business.

1034
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:10,698
There are chicks just ripe
for some kissin'

1035
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,037
And I mean to kiss me a few

1036
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,541
Man, those chicks don't know
what they're missin'

1037
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:23,713
I got a lot of livin' to do

1038
01:13:23,797 --> 01:13:28,135
Sizzlin' steaks
all ready for tastin'

1039
01:13:28,218 --> 01:13:32,388
And there's Cadillacs
all shiny and new

1040
01:13:32,472 --> 01:13:37,225
Gotta move
'cause time is a-wastin'

1041
01:13:37,267 --> 01:13:41,188
I got a lot of livin' to do

1042
01:13:41,229 --> 01:13:44,067
There's music to play
places to go

1043
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:46,193
People to see

1044
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:50,156
Everything for you and me

1045
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,452
Life's a ball
if only you know it

1046
01:13:54,536 --> 01:13:58,874
And it's all
just waitin' for you

1047
01:13:58,915 --> 01:14:03,087
You're alive
so come on and show it

1048
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:07,133
Yeah, we got a lot of livin' to do

1049
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:10,216
There are men

1050
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:14,387
With childhood behind them

1051
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:17,475
Handsome men

1052
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:21,563
From Yale or Purdue

1053
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:24,774
Older men

1054
01:14:24,857 --> 01:14:28,445
And I'm gonna find 'em

1055
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:33,202
I got a lot of livin'

1056
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:36,121
To do

1057
01:14:36,163 --> 01:14:39,373
I'm a-gonna have fun

1058
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:41,374
Gonna be wild

1059
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:44,377
Have my own way

1060
01:14:44,461 --> 01:14:47,630
I may break

1061
01:14:47,672 --> 01:14:51,384
A heart a day

1062
01:14:51,468 --> 01:14:54,805
Drink champagne

1063
01:14:54,846 --> 01:14:57,934
As if it were water

1064
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:02,313
Pink champagne

1065
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:05,316
And after a few

1066
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:09,905
Daddy dear

1067
01:15:09,988 --> 01:15:13,116
You won't know your daughter

1068
01:15:14,658 --> 01:15:18,494
She's got a lot of livin'

1069
01:15:18,536 --> 01:15:20,123
To do

1070
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,130
Think I'll be

1071
01:15:27,172 --> 01:15:29,299
A ring-a-ding drummer

1072
01:15:29,383 --> 01:15:31,383
Make each week

1073
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:33,845
A thousand or two

1074
01:15:33,928 --> 01:15:35,849
Gorgeous girls

1075
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:37,976
Will beg for my number

1076
01:15:38,059 --> 01:15:42,480
Hey, I've got a lot of livin' to do

1077
01:15:42,522 --> 01:15:45,318
Yes, I'm gonna break out
Gonna take off

1078
01:15:45,358 --> 01:15:47,483
Gonna be free

1079
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:51,112
This town is awfully square
for a cat like me

1080
01:15:51,195 --> 01:15:53,447
Or I'll be

1081
01:15:53,532 --> 01:15:55,825
A super jet pilot

1082
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:57,828
Fly me high

1083
01:15:57,869 --> 01:15:59,997
Way out in the blue

1084
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,164
And then they'll see

1085
01:16:02,248 --> 01:16:04,710
I'm no shrinkin' violet

1086
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:08,047
Hey, I've got a lot of livin' to do

1087
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:44,080
I got a lot of livin'

1088
01:18:44,163 --> 01:18:46,081
To do

1089
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:09,773
- There's music to play
- Places to go

1090
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:11,775
People to see

1091
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:16,071
Ah, everything for you and me

1092
01:19:16,113 --> 01:19:18,116
Life's a ball

1093
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:20,451
If only you know it

1094
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:24,914
Yeah, and it's all
just waitin' for you

1095
01:19:24,956 --> 01:19:27,001
Oh, you're alive

1096
01:19:27,084 --> 01:19:29,294
So come on and show it

1097
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:32,381
Yeah, we got a lot of livin'

1098
01:19:32,422 --> 01:19:34,175
Such a lot of livin'

1099
01:19:34,258 --> 01:19:36,593
Tonight's the night
we're gonna fly

1100
01:19:36,635 --> 01:19:39,179
Let's kick this hick town
into high

1101
01:19:43,347 --> 01:19:45,600
I want a taste of everything

1102
01:19:45,684 --> 01:19:48,395
Let's live it up and really swing

1103
01:19:48,436 --> 01:19:52,441
Got a lot of livin', livin'

1104
01:19:52,524 --> 01:19:54,236
Livin', livin'

1105
01:19:54,278 --> 01:19:56,196
Livin' to do

1106
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:57,699
Live!

1107
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:50,166
But you needn't bite my head off.
I only ask a civil question.

1108
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:51,751
Ten times you've asked me.

1109
01:20:51,834 --> 01:20:54,546
I don't know why they've changed
to this slow dance for the TV.

1110
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,548
But if Albert can't get him
to cut it shorter...

1111
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:58,550
tomorrow night
I won't be on Ed Sullivan.

1112
01:20:58,633 --> 01:21:01,012
Neither will Kim.
You know how much it means to her.

1113
01:21:01,054 --> 01:21:02,680
- How about m...
- Well, anyway...

1114
01:21:02,764 --> 01:21:05,516
Albert's still in with the managers,
so that's a good sign.

1115
01:21:05,558 --> 01:21:08,937
If Eisenhower couldn't handle
the Russians, how is Albert?

1116
01:21:22,367 --> 01:21:24,284
Long live Joseph Stalin.

1117
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:26,705
I mean, Stalin lived too long.

1118
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:28,706
Long live Khrushchev.

1119
01:21:47,728 --> 01:21:49,646
Save your life? Me?

1120
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:52,359
My triend,
it you are sick, see a doctor.

1121
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:57,151
If you're sick, see a doctor.
You speak English?

1122
01:21:57,234 --> 01:21:59,946
It saves time.

1123
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:04,034
What can I do for you,
uh, Mr. Peterson?

1124
01:22:04,117 --> 01:22:07,580
Sir, I have come to appeal to you.

1125
01:22:07,664 --> 01:22:10,209
That ballet... the one
that you're doing on TV tomorrow night...

1126
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,501
Da, for Mr. Ed Sullivan.

1127
01:22:12,585 --> 01:22:16,925
Yeah. That's the one.
Could you just cut that four minutes?

1128
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:21,763
Well, it's beautiful. I love it,
but my life depends on it.

1129
01:22:21,846 --> 01:22:24,308
Desecrate this classic?

1130
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:27,226
I need the time
for Conrad Birdie to sing my song.

1131
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:31,938
Who sent you here?
Senator Goldwater?

1132
01:22:32,021 --> 01:22:35,066
Will you cut three minutes?

1133
01:22:35,107 --> 01:22:37,235
Two minutes?

1134
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,945
A minute and a halt.

1135
01:22:39,028 --> 01:22:43,115
To cut even ten seconds
would be artistic sabotage.

1136
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:45,953
This ballet
has historic significance.

1137
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:49,081
It was performed the same day
as the funeral of the czar.

1138
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:52,041
Lenin himself made the arrangement.

1139
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:55,338
- Lenin arranged music?
- No! Funerals!

1140
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:06,097
- Hello, Rose.
- Oh, hi, Kim. You still up?

1141
01:23:06,138 --> 01:23:09,141
Oh, I'm so miserable, Rose.

1142
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:12,770
I've lost Hugo, and now I'm not even
going to be on TV.

1143
01:23:13,814 --> 01:23:15,525
Why not?

1144
01:23:15,608 --> 01:23:20,072
The ballet's taking tour extra minutes,
so Birdie's song and the kiss are out.

1145
01:23:20,155 --> 01:23:23,326
Oh, serves Albert right.

1146
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:25,912
Oh, now come on. Relax.

1147
01:23:25,995 --> 01:23:27,871
Faithless men like Albert and Hugo...

1148
01:23:27,955 --> 01:23:30,583
they're all alike...
from puberty to stupidity...

1149
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:33,002
from Benedict Arnold to Mussolini.

1150
01:23:33,085 --> 01:23:36,462
Men. We laugh at them, right?

1151
01:23:37,503 --> 01:23:42,134
It's easy for you to pick up
the pieces of your shattered dream.

1152
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:45,138
You've tound a compensation.

1153
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:49,308
Ah, that Claude Paisley
is just too much.

1154
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:55,524
He's too much, all right.
But I won't mention of what.

1155
01:23:55,607 --> 01:23:58,442
All that charm... so genteel...

1156
01:23:58,526 --> 01:24:01,740
so educated, so underhanded!

1157
01:24:04,617 --> 01:24:07,579
You mean Mr. Paisley's like
all the rest?

1158
01:24:07,662 --> 01:24:09,663
I thought he was the marrying type.

1159
01:24:09,746 --> 01:24:11,705
Oh, he is.

1160
01:24:11,788 --> 01:24:13,833
He wanted to elope tonight.

1161
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:16,752
And you know what?
He'd like to live in New York.

1162
01:24:16,836 --> 01:24:19,213
Uh, not to teach...
to be a songwriter.

1163
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:20,716
A songwriter?

1164
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:24,721
He's all the things
I want to get away from.

1165
01:24:24,805 --> 01:24:26,723
Oh, I'm sorry.

1166
01:24:26,806 --> 01:24:30,353
I never dreamed that Mr. Paisley,
of all men...

1167
01:24:30,436 --> 01:24:34,940
Oh, well. Men.
They're only out to use us, Kim.

1168
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:37,902
I know. Hugo's used me
since we were freshman.

1169
01:24:37,944 --> 01:24:41,029
All those years I wasted
on Albert.

1170
01:24:41,071 --> 01:24:43,197
Rosie the dependable one,
Rosie the patient one...

1171
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:45,616
Rosie the good girl.

1172
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:49,578
I know it sounds old-tashioned,
but I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1173
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,831
- I'm still a good girl.
- Rose?

1174
01:24:51,915 --> 01:24:54,875
- Hmm?
- So am I.

1175
01:24:56,418 --> 01:24:58,380
No kidding?

1176
01:24:59,631 --> 01:25:02,593
Well, you won't be sorry.

1177
01:25:06,472 --> 01:25:08,932
- Are you going out so late?
- Mm-hmm.

1178
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:13,437
My farewell to Sweet Apple... a night
to remember. I'm going to Maude's Cate.

1179
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:17,647
Maude's? That's a wild place.

1180
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:20,234
You're not gonna do anything rash?

1181
01:25:20,317 --> 01:25:22,277
Whatever you hear about me, Kim...

1182
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:25,031
just tell them that
she loved not wisely, but too well.

1183
01:25:38,588 --> 01:25:41,092
This is the place, Albert...
hottest spot in the county.

1184
01:25:41,175 --> 01:25:43,844
- How do you know?
- Oh, I heard... only heard.

1185
01:25:44,929 --> 01:25:47,305
Albert, don't go in that place.

1186
01:25:47,389 --> 01:25:50,973
- I must. It's the only way.
- But drinking won't solve anything.

1187
01:25:51,056 --> 01:25:53,143
He's frustrated.

1188
01:25:53,227 --> 01:25:58,150
Good-bye. Thanks.

1189
01:25:58,192 --> 01:26:00,651
I'd go in there with ya
it I weren't a happy family man...

1190
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:02,695
and not allowed to enjoy myself.

1191
01:26:02,778 --> 01:26:05,365
Oh, please, Mister, I...
Oh, my arm!

1192
01:26:05,448 --> 01:26:07,618
- I just want to...
- I'm telling you for the last time!

1193
01:26:07,659 --> 01:26:11,163
- All I want is a drink.
- No drinks! Now get lost!

1194
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:15,209
Well, just a pint ot bourbon?
Gin? Scotch?

1195
01:26:15,293 --> 01:26:17,336
Well, how about a malted
with a little vodka?

1196
01:26:17,419 --> 01:26:19,838
Come back when you're 21.

1197
01:26:19,922 --> 01:26:24,173
Oh, well, I'm way over 21. I only
look young from too much drinkin'.

1198
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:33,559
Oh, look at me.
Look at the shell of a human being...

1199
01:26:33,642 --> 01:26:35,604
the monster you've created.

1200
01:26:35,687 --> 01:26:39,983
Oh, I'm sorry about... Uh, Hugo,
don't worry. You'll get Kim back.

1201
01:26:40,024 --> 01:26:42,903
No, thanks.
The bloom is off the rose.

1202
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:47,743
Rose. Little Rose...

1203
01:26:47,826 --> 01:26:50,287
a precious flower
that I trampled on.

1204
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:08,428
There you go.

1205
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:11,891
A toast to Mae. She's okay.

1206
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:14,020
I'm a songwriter too, huh?

1207
01:27:14,102 --> 01:27:17,898
Would you call the McAfee house again
and see if my Al... Sonny!

1208
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:19,983
Mama, what are you doin'
in a place like this?

1209
01:27:20,066 --> 01:27:21,986
We're playin' canasta.
I got lonesome.

1210
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:24,446
- Did you cut the Russians?
- And why are you consorting with him?

1211
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:26,781
- Glad to meet you.
- Now looks ain't everything.

1212
01:27:26,865 --> 01:27:30,284
Besides, Mr. Maude
is 100% gentlemen and a widower.

1213
01:27:30,368 --> 01:27:32,034
Three times. Sit down, Albert.

1214
01:27:32,118 --> 01:27:35,247
Any son ot Mae Peterson is a friend
of mine. Come. Sit down. Go on.

1215
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:38,250
Mama, get your things. We're taking
the bus to New York tonight.

1216
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,920
Your song! It's all off?

1217
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:43,966
- It's dead, like I am. Let's go.
- You ain't going, Mae. Say you ain't!

1218
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:47,802
- You unhand her. Come on, Mama.
- Okay, buster. Set 'em up!

1219
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:51,308
Double scotch and gin on the side
and, uh, a bourbon chaser.

1220
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:55,770
Make that a triple chaser,
and bring on the dancing boys!

1221
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,982
Well, come on. Make me the drinks,
Meyer. We gotta put out this fire.

1222
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:02,692
Everything is Rosie

1223
01:28:02,775 --> 01:28:04,318
Cha, cha, cha

1224
01:28:04,402 --> 01:28:06,738
- 'Cause my name is Rosie
- Oh, the poor thing.

1225
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,115
- Fifi, huh
- She can't get over me.

1226
01:28:09,157 --> 01:28:12,328
- She's singing the song I wrote for her.
- You wrote her a song?

1227
01:28:12,411 --> 01:28:15,914
Well, only eight bars, Mama.
Somehow I never could finish it.

1228
01:28:15,955 --> 01:28:19,126
Hey, what's with the red cap?
You got a train inside?

1229
01:28:26,216 --> 01:28:27,636
Where are you goin'?

1230
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,597
I'm gonna go down and see what
the boys in the back room will have.

1231
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,642
Albert, where are you going?

1232
01:28:32,726 --> 01:28:37,352
To save her from herself... to save her
for me. She might get in trouble.

1233
01:28:37,435 --> 01:28:41,940
Report on the charity bazaar we ran
for the benefit of the old folk home...

1234
01:28:41,982 --> 01:28:47,822
to wit net cash receipts, $840.06.

1235
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,910
Valuable goods contributed,
two milk cows, live...

1236
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:55,455
eighty lugs ot fresh fruit...

1237
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,459
forty-five young cumquat trees...

1238
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:01,171
one ton of fertilizer...

1239
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:17,477
And now,
betore the recording secretary...

1240
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:20,146
reads the minutes
from last week's meeting...

1241
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,148
I wish to bring up a subject...

1242
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,193
that I know is on everybody's mind...

1243
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,656
tonight.

1244
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,471
As I was saying, gentlemen...

1245
01:31:03,169 --> 01:31:04,629
Yeah!

1246
01:31:36,786 --> 01:31:38,204
Yeah!

1247
01:32:33,927 --> 01:32:36,012
No. Listen, fellas...
Watch out!

1248
01:33:35,617 --> 01:33:37,576
Rosie, baby.

1249
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:45,919
Good morning, darling.

1250
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:48,671
Way past noon. Sleep okay, honey?

1251
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:51,924
Mm-hmm. I tried not to.

1252
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:54,637
I wanted to keep reliving
that wonderful moment...

1253
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:59,098
when my shining knight...

1254
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,768
rushed into the sultan's cave...

1255
01:34:01,852 --> 01:34:03,813
and carried me oft.

1256
01:34:05,564 --> 01:34:07,816
Oh, that's just the beginning.

1257
01:34:07,858 --> 01:34:11,401
Pack. We're takin' the bus
to Niagara Falls.

1258
01:34:11,484 --> 01:34:13,403
Oh, yes, dear.

1259
01:34:20,618 --> 01:34:25,125
You never saw me
in pajamas betore.

1260
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:26,625
You disappointed?

1261
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,628
Mm-mm.

1262
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:34,010
Are you?

1263
01:34:44,018 --> 01:34:47,564
Let's take a plane to Niagara Falls...
a jet!

1264
01:34:52,278 --> 01:34:56,197
Albert, we came here
to get your mother set financially...

1265
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:58,992
and our marriage
wouldn't have a chance...

1266
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:01,580
if we started off feeling guilty
about deserting her.

1267
01:35:01,663 --> 01:35:05,500
That's right. It may be a long time
betore I make any money.

1268
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:07,669
Not if Birdie sang
your song tonight.

1269
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:10,046
No chance. I pleaded.

1270
01:35:10,087 --> 01:35:13,050
They won't shorten the ballet...
not even ten seconds.

1271
01:35:13,091 --> 01:35:16,178
It's the slowest dance I ever saw.
They move like turtles.

1272
01:35:20,805 --> 01:35:23,350
- What?
- Randolph!

1273
01:35:29,065 --> 01:35:31,066
Boys, those are really showstoppers.

1274
01:35:31,108 --> 01:35:34,153
Frank, Dean and Sammy,
come on out here and take a bow.

1275
01:35:36,907 --> 01:35:41,538
Frank, Dean and Sammy McWilliams.
Thank you, boys.

1276
01:35:41,621 --> 01:35:45,542
Right now, here on our stage,
the magnificent orchestra...

1277
01:35:45,584 --> 01:35:48,752
of American composer-conductor
Ray Block.

1278
01:35:48,836 --> 01:35:50,586
Now, really. Let's hear it.

1279
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:52,587
Well, that ought to do it.
Any questions?

1280
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:55,050
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Okay. I'm going backstage.

1281
01:35:55,091 --> 01:35:56,550
Right.

1282
01:36:00,889 --> 01:36:03,015
Don't know why I let that Albert
drag us here.

1283
01:36:03,099 --> 01:36:05,268
Rosie said she might have
a big surprise for us.

1284
01:36:05,352 --> 01:36:08,856
Maybe they'll show us sitting here
on TV. I bet that's it.

1285
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:13,484
- Where did you get all that money?
- I sold Mr. Peterson my chemical set.

1286
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:20,161
- Two minutes, maestro.
- Borov will be there.

1287
01:36:20,244 --> 01:36:23,787
Have never been late
for performance in whole career.

1288
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:28,917
- You say you from magazine?
- Uh, yes. American Ballet magazine.

1289
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,963
We want a picture of the world's
greatest conductor, Maestro Borov.

1290
01:36:33,046 --> 01:36:37,260
You flatter me.
So, shoot me quick.

1291
01:36:37,343 --> 01:36:40,137
Uh, drinking this milk.

1292
01:36:40,178 --> 01:36:42,390
- Milk?
- Yes.

1293
01:36:42,473 --> 01:36:45,186
We drink vodka, little tlower.

1294
01:36:45,269 --> 01:36:49,023
Oh, well, no, thank you.
Please, maestro. This milk.

1295
01:36:49,107 --> 01:36:52,152
You see, our president
has asked us to drink more milk...

1296
01:36:52,235 --> 01:36:54,154
and it would be
a goodwill gesture.

1297
01:36:54,196 --> 01:36:55,654
- President?
- Yes.

1298
01:36:55,696 --> 01:36:58,530
Oh, won't you, please, maestro...

1299
01:36:58,613 --> 01:37:00,533
to improve our relations?

1300
01:37:01,617 --> 01:37:04,120
You are pretty enough
to be un-American.

1301
01:37:06,414 --> 01:37:09,959
All right. Here we go.
Drink up. That's it.

1302
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:15,216
Now keep drinking until I frame you...
Uh, frame you pertectly. All right.

1303
01:37:15,299 --> 01:37:17,677
Bottoms up. That's it.

1304
01:37:22,598 --> 01:37:23,975
Very good.

1305
01:37:25,268 --> 01:37:28,187
You've got it. I mean, gotcha!

1306
01:37:30,605 --> 01:37:33,024
See you after, could be?

1307
01:37:33,066 --> 01:37:36,527
- I'll catch up with ya.
- And for you I do not go too fast.

1308
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:39,071
We shall see.

1309
01:37:40,156 --> 01:37:42,326
Good-bye. Thank you.

1310
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:55,883
Mission accomplished.

1311
01:37:55,925 --> 01:37:57,426
- He drank it?
- Yeah.

1312
01:37:57,509 --> 01:37:59,429
My formula works on chickens
and Randolph's turtle...

1313
01:37:59,512 --> 01:38:00,931
but I don't know about humans.

1314
01:38:01,014 --> 01:38:03,098
Well, it it doesn't,
we're no worse off...

1315
01:38:03,182 --> 01:38:05,432
but if it does, this will be
the shortest ballet in history.

1316
01:38:05,515 --> 01:38:07,851
And now, ready America and Canada?

1317
01:38:07,893 --> 01:38:10,896
Because here we go out
to Columbus, Ohio...

1318
01:38:10,938 --> 01:38:14,108
where the Moscow Ballet dances
"The Rose Adagio"...

1319
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:16,193
from Tchaikovsky's
Sleeping Beauty...

1320
01:38:16,234 --> 01:38:19,030
conducted by Maestro Borov.

1321
01:38:19,072 --> 01:38:22,368
Take it away, CBS Columbus, Ohio.

1322
01:38:22,409 --> 01:38:24,369
We're on. Up on one.

1323
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,546
Lights.

1324
01:39:41,573 --> 01:39:44,533
Camera two, can you move to your right
just a couple of feet?

1325
01:40:15,358 --> 01:40:17,525
Magniticent.

1326
01:40:39,508 --> 01:40:41,426
It's not gonna work.

1327
01:41:26,511 --> 01:41:29,223
This is crazy. That's not the way
it was rehearsed.

1328
01:41:31,226 --> 01:41:33,729
What is it, sabotage?

1329
01:42:32,205 --> 01:42:35,041
We'll have to fill some time.
Put the Birdie song back in.

1330
01:42:35,124 --> 01:42:36,543
Gotcha, Ed.

1331
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:38,628
Take over.
Be prepared tor the Birdie spot.

1332
01:42:46,303 --> 01:42:49,557
Albert, "One Last Kiss" is back in.
Find Conrad. Rosie, get Kim.

1333
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:52,560
- Right.
- Put the Birdie spot on stage. Let's go!

1334
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:06,488
McAfee, hurry up! Come on.
Let's go. The song is back in!

1335
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:09,701
- A miracle happened! Let's go!
- What? Come on!

1336
01:43:33,603 --> 01:43:35,896
Are you crazy, Borov?

1337
01:44:01,087 --> 01:44:04,175
I've never seen such speedin' dancers.
Thank you, Moscow Ballet...

1338
01:44:04,259 --> 01:44:06,761
for that brilliant
and unexpected bit of burlesque.

1339
01:44:06,844 --> 01:44:08,596
And now, another great treat...

1340
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:11,264
Conrad Birdie.

1341
01:44:41,089 --> 01:44:43,131
On behalf of all the members...

1342
01:44:43,215 --> 01:44:47,592
ot the Sweet Apple chapter
of the Conrad Birdie Fan Club...

1343
01:44:51,805 --> 01:44:53,767
We wish to express to you...

1344
01:44:53,809 --> 01:44:56,644
our great pride in your brave deed.

1345
01:44:56,686 --> 01:44:59,480
- Hiya, Ed.
- Oh, no.

1346
01:45:02,193 --> 01:45:04,153
Oh, hi. How are ya?

1347
01:45:11,244 --> 01:45:13,746
I wish to convey our deep pride...

1348
01:45:13,829 --> 01:45:15,789
in your brave deed, namely...

1349
01:45:15,831 --> 01:45:18,791
As a citizen,
I'm proud to have Conrad...

1350
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:22,711
defend my family
and the McAfee Fertilizer Company.

1351
01:45:24,255 --> 01:45:26,298
Conrad, sing!

1352
01:45:27,425 --> 01:45:31,263
Oh, one last kiss

1353
01:45:31,347 --> 01:45:33,474
Give me one last kiss

1354
01:45:33,516 --> 01:45:35,475
It never felt like this

1355
01:45:35,517 --> 01:45:38,020
Nah, baby, not like this

1356
01:45:38,062 --> 01:45:40,315
You know I need your love

1357
01:45:42,109 --> 01:45:44,736
Give me one last kiss

1358
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:47,281
One last kiss

1359
01:45:47,365 --> 01:45:49,157
Oh, one more time

1360
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:51,324
Mmm, baby, one more time

1361
01:45:51,408 --> 01:45:53,367
It really is sublime

1362
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,871
Ah, honey, so sublime

1363
01:45:55,954 --> 01:45:58,165
You know I need your love

1364
01:46:00,751 --> 01:46:02,503
Give me one last kiss

1365
01:46:02,544 --> 01:46:05,088
One last kiss

1366
01:46:06,173 --> 01:46:10,220
Baby

1367
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:14,015
Give me one last kiss

1368
01:46:15,016 --> 01:46:19,104
Baby

1369
01:46:19,187 --> 01:46:21,233
Give me one la...

1370
01:46:30,155 --> 01:46:33,368
Yoo-hoo! Albert!

1371
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:39,917
I saw it all on TV.
"One Last Kiss" was a disaster.

1372
01:46:40,001 --> 01:46:42,168
Who wants to buy a record
of a guy with a glass jaw?

1373
01:46:42,251 --> 01:46:44,963
Now will you take Mama's advice
and get out of show business?

1374
01:46:45,047 --> 01:46:49,052
I am! My song may be dead, but
my chemical formula works... on people.

1375
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:51,596
Shh. The Russians
may have this place bugged.

1376
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:55,725
It was Albert's formula that made
the orchestra leader go that fast.

1377
01:46:55,766 --> 01:46:57,558
My genius!

1378
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,728
You gotta work on my cleaning woman.
She gets a dollar an hour.

1379
01:47:00,812 --> 01:47:03,272
Yeah. Mama...

1380
01:47:06,235 --> 01:47:08,653
Rosie and I are going
to Niagara Falls.

1381
01:47:10,197 --> 01:47:11,948
Well...

1382
01:47:14,076 --> 01:47:16,621
it's about time.

1383
01:47:20,417 --> 01:47:23,795
Oh, Mae!
You have to come with us!

1384
01:47:23,837 --> 01:47:27,132
No. I'm one mother
doesn't mix in. Maude!

1385
01:47:27,216 --> 01:47:29,134
Don't fall in the pit, Maude.

1386
01:47:31,176 --> 01:47:32,428
- Albert?
- Yes.

1387
01:47:32,511 --> 01:47:34,762
I would like to do things proper.

1388
01:47:34,804 --> 01:47:37,766
So I would like the honor
of becoming your stepfather.

1389
01:47:39,225 --> 01:47:41,103
Is it all right, Albert?

1390
01:47:41,978 --> 01:47:44,023
Mama, with my blessing!

1391
01:47:44,107 --> 01:47:47,651
- I'm glad because we just got married.
- Yes.

1392
01:47:49,904 --> 01:47:54,243
- What a surprise!
- How exciting! It's beautitul!

1393
01:47:54,327 --> 01:47:56,329
- Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.

1394
01:47:56,413 --> 01:47:59,916
Let's go, Maudie!
We're leavin' for Akron.

1395
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,710
Hubby has to open a new bar and he wants
me to throw out the first beer can.

1396
01:48:02,793 --> 01:48:06,545
- Yeah! Good-bye, son!
- The falls are wet. Take your rubbers!

1397
01:48:06,629 --> 01:48:08,798
- Bye!
- Yes, Mrs. Maude.

1398
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,841
How about that?
Maude and Mrs. Peterson.

1399
01:48:10,925 --> 01:48:13,136
- Oh, ready here, Albert.
- Be right with you.

1400
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,513
No hurry, partner.

1401
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:17,515
I promise you one thing, snookums.

1402
01:48:17,557 --> 01:48:19,851
No matter how many millions I make
sellin' "Speed Up"...

1403
01:48:19,893 --> 01:48:23,189
I'll still be the same,
humble, lovable guy.

1404
01:48:23,231 --> 01:48:26,192
And it any of those hicks try
to push me around, I'll break 'em.

1405
01:48:30,405 --> 01:48:33,950
Everything is Rosie

1406
01:48:34,034 --> 01:48:36,870
Since I found my Rosie

1407
01:48:36,912 --> 01:48:38,370
Same old words.

1408
01:48:38,412 --> 01:48:42,039
With a girl like Rosie

1409
01:48:42,123 --> 01:48:44,334
How could I be blue

1410
01:48:44,376 --> 01:48:46,169
Same eight bars. Now what?

1411
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:49,924
Hand in hand, we'll mosey

1412
01:48:50,007 --> 01:48:53,554
Me and little Rosie

1413
01:48:53,637 --> 01:48:56,098
We will be so cozy

1414
01:48:56,181 --> 01:48:59,310
By a fire built for two

1415
01:48:59,394 --> 01:49:01,729
Oh, Albert, you're too much.

1416
01:49:01,811 --> 01:49:05,817
Oh, I once heard a poem that goes

1417
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:09,528
A rose is a rose is a rose

1418
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:11,529
But I don't agree

1419
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:13,529
Take it from me

1420
01:49:13,571 --> 01:49:17,202
There's one rose sweeter
than any that grows

1421
01:49:17,243 --> 01:49:20,080
And that's my Rosie

1422
01:49:20,163 --> 01:49:24,083
I'm so glad she chose me

1423
01:49:24,124 --> 01:49:26,920
Life is one sweet

1424
01:49:27,003 --> 01:49:29,882
Beautiful song to me

1425
01:49:29,924 --> 01:49:33,761
Everything is Hugo

1426
01:49:33,845 --> 01:49:37,557
I will go where you'll go

1427
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:41,604
With a boy like Hugo

1428
01:49:41,687 --> 01:49:44,896
How could I be blue

1429
01:49:44,938 --> 01:49:49,483
We will be so cozy

1430
01:49:49,567 --> 01:49:53,614
Just like Al and Rosie

1431
01:49:53,697 --> 01:49:56,199
But we're gonna mosey

1432
01:49:56,282 --> 01:49:59,536
In a hot rod built for two

1433
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:05,418
- And that's my Rosie
- Gee, how delighted we'll be

1434
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:09,590
- I'm so glad she chose me
- When you are cozy with me

1435
01:50:09,632 --> 01:50:13,803
Life is one sweet beautiful song

1436
01:50:13,887 --> 01:50:18,055
When love is right
then what could be wrong

1437
01:50:18,138 --> 01:50:20,473
Life is one sweet

1438
01:50:20,556 --> 01:50:24,978
Beautiful song to me

1439
01:50:28,983 --> 01:50:30,984
Bye, bye

1440
01:50:31,068 --> 01:50:33,529
Birdie

1441
01:50:33,613 --> 01:50:37,284
The army's got you now

1442
01:50:37,368 --> 01:50:39,411
I'll try

1443
01:50:39,495 --> 01:50:41,829
Birdie

1444
01:50:41,871 --> 01:50:45,460
To forget somehow

1445
01:50:47,169 --> 01:50:49,672
No more

1446
01:50:49,755 --> 01:50:52,131
Sighing

1447
01:50:52,173 --> 01:50:55,801
Each time you move those lips

1448
01:50:55,843 --> 01:50:57,970
No more

1449
01:50:58,012 --> 01:51:00,474
Dying

1450
01:51:00,515 --> 01:51:03,852
When you twitch those hips

1451
01:51:03,894 --> 01:51:06,146
Your swivel and your sway

1452
01:51:06,188 --> 01:51:08,147
Your super-duper class

1453
01:51:08,189 --> 01:51:10,275
There's nothing left to say

1454
01:51:10,359 --> 01:51:13,614
But, Conrad, you're a gas

1455
01:51:14,948 --> 01:51:16,867
Bye, bye

1456
01:51:16,909 --> 01:51:19,328
Birdie

1457
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:23,123
Ta, ta, ol' sweetie pie

1458
01:51:23,206 --> 01:51:25,207
Bye, bye

1459
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:27,541
Birdie

1460
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:30,212
Time for me to fly

1461
01:51:31,797 --> 01:51:36,135
Time for me to fly

1462
01:51:36,218 --> 01:51:41,266
Time to say good-bye

1463
01:51:41,349 --> 01:51:42,350
Bye, now
