1
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,111
<i>Aussteigen.</i>

2
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,039
<i>Tor aufmachen!</i>

3
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,545
Go inside.

4
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,716
Hurry up.

5
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,885
This way.

6
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,643
Hurry up.

7
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,616
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

8
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,910
- I...
- No, that's mine.

9
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,454
<i>Allez...</i> hup!

10
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,118
How far are the trees, Danny?

11
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,457
- Over 200 feet.
- Yeah, I'd say 300.

12
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,792
Long ways to dig.

13
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,963
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

14
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,883
Willie, you think X got away?

15
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,135
He'd have sent us word, somehow, if he had.

16
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,472
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

17
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,907
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

18
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:50,244
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

19
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,164
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

20
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,261
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

21
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,223
Good morning, Group Captain.

22
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:14,102
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.

23
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,104
Since you're senior British officer,

24
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,358
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

25
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,403
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

26
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,907
- The word is "policy"?
- Yes.

27
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:30,076
Thank you.

28
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,871
<i>Herein.</i>

29
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,716
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

30
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,595
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.

31
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,899
Group Captain Ramsey, in the past four years

32
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,153
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

33
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,238
energy, manpower and equipment

34
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,158
hunting down escaping prisoner-of-war officers.

35
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,703
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

36
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:19,500
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

37
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:23,838
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

38
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,257
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

39
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,260
to use an inordinate number of troops
to guard them,

40
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:33,347
and their sworn duty to harass the enemy
to the best of their ability.

41
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,433
Yes, I know.

42
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,437
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

43
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:42,440
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

44
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,611
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

45
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,323
Archibald "Archie" Ives, eleven escape attempts.

46
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,826
Even tried to jump out of the truck coming here.

47
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,037
Dickes, William.

48
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:59,290
Known to have participated in digging of
11 escape tunnels.

49
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,709
Flight Lieutenant Willinski, four escapes.

50
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,503
MacDonald, nine.
Hendley, the American, five.

51
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,716
Haynes, four. Sedgwick, seven.
The list is almost endless.

52
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,720
One man here has made 17 attempted escapes.

53
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,139
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

54
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,184
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

55
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,562
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

56
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,276
No.

57
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,739
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

58
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,159
This is a new camp.

59
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,913
It has been built to hold you and your men.

60
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,834
It is organized to incorporate
all we have learned of security measures.

61
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:48,089
And, in me, you will not be dealing
with a common jailer,

62
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:51,342
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

63
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,511
by the Luftwaffe high command.

64
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:59,600
We have, in effect,
put all our rotten eggs in one basket,

65
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,979
and we intend to watch this basket carefully.

66
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,189
Very wise.

67
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:12,280
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

68
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:16,867
Sports, a library, a recreation hall...

69
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,871
And, for gardening, we will give you tools.

70
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,791
We trust you to use them for gardening.

71
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,877
Devote your energies to these things.

72
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,588
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.

73
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:33,467
And, with intelligent cooperation,

74
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,387
we may all sit out the war...

75
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,558
as comfortably as possible.

76
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,078
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

77
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,457
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

78
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,917
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

79
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,795
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?

80
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:13,924
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

81
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,803
- In 1812 they burned your Capitol.
- That's propaganda.

82
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,848
It's in the history books. I read it.

83
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,268
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

84
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,479
Yeah. No tools.

85
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,444
Hey, Virgil.

86
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey, did you see the cooler?

87
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,199
Boy, is it ever a big one!

88
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,618
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

89
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,828
Those two guys who were with us
in the old camp,

90
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,289
in hut 14, I can't find them.

91
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:48,626
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.

92
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:52,380
What were their names?
It was Jackson and, uh...

93
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,632
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

94
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,385
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

95
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,787
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

96
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,790
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

97
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:31,001
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

98
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,506
Willie, cigarettes.

99
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,405
Danny and I have a blitz in mind.
Could you put on a brief show for the goons?

100
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,366
Sure, man. What'll it be?
An all-out go?

101
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,977
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles?

102
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:08,372
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

103
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,835
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

104
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:17,214
- Are you pushing me?
- That's mine, you son of a...

105
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,978
<i>Tovarich.</i>

106
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,277
<i>Spasibo.</i>

107
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,955
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

108
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,584
It's all right, mate.
We're just having a friendly little argument.

109
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,462
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

110
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,339
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,591
You, too!

112
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,094
Get away! Get back in your huts!

113
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,806
Go on!

114
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:43,634
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only one
other American in the whole camp.

115
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:46,387
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

116
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,256
Hey, you got something goin' already?

117
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,643
See the way the goons got those towers placed?

118
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,436
There's a blind spot through the middle.

119
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:55,813
A blind spot?

120
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,816
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

121
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:01,819
They'd never see me, especially at night.

122
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:02,945
You're crazy.

123
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,906
You think so?
Let's find out right now.

124
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,843
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

125
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,097
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

126
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,685
I think I'll take a little walk.

127
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,230
<i>Abteilung marsch!</i>

128
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,310
<i>Tovarich.</i>

129
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,396
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

130
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,441
- Let me have it, mate.
- <i>Ja vas lublu.</i>

131
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,318
- <i>Ja vas...</i>
- <i>Lublu.</i>

132
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,071
<i>Lublu? Ja vas lublu.</i>

133
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,781
<i>Ja vas lublu.</i>

134
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,242
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

135
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,745
I love you? What bloody good is that?

136
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,581
I don't know. I wasn't going to use it myself.

137
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,266
<i>Halt!</i>

138
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,440
Out.

139
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,151
- Out!
- <i>Nyet, nyet. Tovarich.</i>

140
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,962
Your friend, yes?

141
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,488
<i>Tovarich.</i>

142
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,950
And who vouches for you, Lieutenant Willinski?

143
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,160
Get out, Sedgwick.

144
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,212
<i>Spasibo.</i>

145
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,384
<i>Marsch!</i>

146
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,199
Hold it, hold it!

147
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,997
- Your name?
- Ives.

148
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:06,920
Ives. Ives.
Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

149
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,590
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

150
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:13,177
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

151
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,704
I will not take action against you now.

152
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:41,997
This is the first day here,

153
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,542
and there has been much
stupidity and carelessness...

154
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,961
on both sides.

155
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,766
Hey! Get out!

156
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,861
<i>Nicht schieben! Nicht schieben!</i>
Don't shoot!

157
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,575
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

158
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,453
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

159
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,332
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

160
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,002
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

161
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,172
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

162
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:34,800
Gettin' my baseball.

163
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,095
Stop this!
Get over the wire immediately!

164
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,596
- OK.
- You stay there!

165
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,599
Out of the way. Out.

166
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,106
What are you doing over here by the wire?

167
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,774
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

168
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,484
<i>Achtung!</i>

169
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,124
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

170
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,628
I was trying to cut my way through your wire,
because I wanna get out.

171
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,797
<i>Durchsuchen Sie ihn.</i>

172
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,221
- Do you speak German?
- <i>Jawohl, Herr Oberst.</i>

173
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,308
- Wire cutters.
- <i>Jawohl, Herr Oberst.</i>

174
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,269
I have had the pleasure of knowing

175
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,397
quite a number of British officers in this war.

176
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,399
And I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

177
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,993
You are the first American officer I have met.
Hilts, isn't it?

178
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,995
Captain Hilts, actually.

179
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,039
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

180
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,208
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

181
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,588
I suppose what's called in the American army
a "hotshot pilot."

182
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,090
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway.

183
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,010
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

184
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,846
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

185
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,395
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

186
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,564
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

187
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,235
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

188
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:21,323
- About 99 percent.
- Perhaps while you are with us,

189
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,119
you will have a chance to learn some.
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

190
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,039
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.

191
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,540
Right.

192
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,212
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

193
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,547
Cooler.

194
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,975
- Name?
- Ives.

195
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,145
- Flying Officer Ives.
- Cooler, 20 days.

196
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,901
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

197
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,710
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

198
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,214
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

199
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,382
No, I was in college.

200
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,344
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

201
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,556
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

202
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,020
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

203
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:03,026
- How tall are you, Ives?
- Five feet four. Why?

204
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,695
Oh, just wondering.

205
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,909
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

206
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,703
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

207
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,874
- Bicycles?
- Motorcycles.

208
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,753
Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

209
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,382
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.

210
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,050
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

211
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:31,054
No, horse racing. Jockey.

212
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,058
Jockey.

213
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,229
Jockey.

214
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,818
Hilts?

215
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,405
Are you there, Hilts?

216
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,658
Yeah, I'm here.

217
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,744
Don't you have them in the States? Jockeys?

218
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,290
- Sure.
- They were the days.

219
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:02,919
Saturday nights in towns
like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

220
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,089
You had to fight off the birds.

221
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,175
You know, birds.

222
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,260
Girls, man. Girls.

223
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,263
Do you not have them in the States?

224
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,811
Hilts? Are you there, Hilts?

225
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,230
Ives.

226
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,943
What?

227
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,781
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

228
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,701
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

229
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:39,539
I could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

230
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,376
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood,

231
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,713
and getting the dirt out,
that's what you've to worry about.

232
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,758
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

233
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,385
How are you going to get the dirt out?

234
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,514
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

235
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,601
Aye.

236
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,813
Well, what do you think?

237
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,525
I must say, it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

238
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,527
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

239
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:13,490
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

240
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,550
Eric.

241
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:36,763
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

242
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,641
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

243
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,187
He has arrived.

244
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:55,865
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

245
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,877
I suggest this prisoner be kept

246
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,548
under the strictest security confinement permanently.

247
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:15,218
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

248
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,721
We have reason to believe he is the leader

249
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,889
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

250
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:26,062
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

251
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,733
and the Gestapo has only "reason to believe"?

252
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,737
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

253
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:38,408
Air-force officer prisoners
are the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

254
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:43,913
not the SS... or the Gestapo.

255
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,916
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

256
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,628
That is why he is returned,
for the moment, to your care.

257
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,590
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

258
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,801
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

259
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,763
We regretfully are not so professionally understanding.

260
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,520
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

261
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:12,692
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

262
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,695
- <i>Heil Hitler.</i>
- <i>Heil Hitler.</i>

263
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,947
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

264
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,535
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

265
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,292
Herr Kuhn.

266
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:54,192
<i>Nehmen Sie dem Mann diese Dinger ab.</i>

267
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,169
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

268
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,839
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

269
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,007
Well, it's new.

270
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:22,512
- Here. Let's find you a bed.
- Thanks.

271
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,031
Come in.

272
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,577
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

273
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:50,373
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

274
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,293
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

275
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,880
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome committee,
but that's for later.

276
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:01,301
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

277
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,304
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

278
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,140
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

279
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,310
You met the commandant?

280
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,271
Yes, I did.

281
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,399
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

282
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,110
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

283
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:20,854
Who else is here? Cavendish?

284
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,115
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

285
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,326
- Blythe?
- Yes.

286
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,412
Almost the whole X organization.

287
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:34,584
Almost. They cleaned out all the other camps
and dumped us in this one.

288
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,338
As Von Luger put it,
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

289
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,591
There's madness in their method.

290
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:46,596
- What about Tommy Bristol?
- No, but there's an American, Hendley.

291
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,183
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

292
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,102
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

293
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,316
Last of the tea until the Red Cross
gets through again.

294
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,693
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

295
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,617
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

296
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,621
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

297
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:17,460
Roger, personal revenge must be kept out
of what we have to do here.

298
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,129
Too many lives are at stake.

299
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:26,344
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

300
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,473
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

301
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,184
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

302
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,479
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

303
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,151
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

304
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:46,364
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

305
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:47,782
How?

306
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,868
By putting more men out of this...

307
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,913
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

308
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,002
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

309
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,671
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

310
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:04,716
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

311
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,137
Have you thought of what it might cost?

312
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:15,852
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

313
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,396
knuckle under and crawl.

314
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,566
Surely you don't advocate that, do you, sir?

315
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,444
I have to point out one thing to you, Roger.

316
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,697
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

317
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:30,867
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

318
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,744
not the Gestapo and the SS.

319
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:38,750
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

320
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,543
then the SS and the Gestapo.

321
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,631
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

322
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,716
There's only one way to put it, sir.

323
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:50,345
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

324
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,473
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

325
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,642
I have no argument with you, Roger.

326
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,563
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.

327
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,277
When are you calling a meeting, X?

328
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,496
Tonight.

329
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,717
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard

330
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,930
the immortal words of our new commandant.

331
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,599
"Devote your energies to things other than escape,

332
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,935
and sit out the war as comfortably as possible."

333
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,357
Well, that's exactly what we're going to do.

334
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:47,652
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

335
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:50,655
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

336
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:53,866
In fact, we're going to put the goons to sleep.

337
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,620
Meanwhile... we dig.

338
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,999
Now, even a superficial look at the compound

339
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:05,294
shows us that huts 104 and five
are closest to the woods.

340
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,880
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

341
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,008
directly east under the cooler and the wire.

342
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,302
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

343
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,389
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

344
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,976
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

345
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:24,147
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down 30 feet
before we go horizontal.

346
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,650
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

347
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:31,070
All right, Roger, but...
did you say the first tunnel?

348
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:34,282
I did. There'll be three.

349
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:39,579
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

350
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,330
Dick goes north from the kitchen,

351
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:44,876
and Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

352
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,547
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

353
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,175
How many men do you plan to take out, Roger?

354
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:54,844
Two hundred and fifty.

355
00:34:56,512 --> 00:35:01,017
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.

356
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:04,353
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

357
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,856
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

358
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,941
Yes, but, uh...

359
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,153
OK, Roger.

360
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,074
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

361
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,410
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

362
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:28,419
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

363
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:32,882
- We're going to tunnel.
- Splendid.

364
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,847
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, in charge of traps.

365
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:43,100
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

366
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:48,147
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.
Mac, of course, will take care of intelligence.

367
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,566
Hendley. We haven't met.

368
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,735
- Scrounger?
- Right.

369
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,239
Dennis, maps and surveys.

370
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,407
Colin, you'll take your usual job.

371
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,785
Eric, how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

372
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:05,957
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated three tunnels,
but we'll manage.

373
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,335
Roger, who's going to handle security for all this?

374
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:13,589
You are. I want a system of stooges
covering this compound

375
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:17,635
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

376
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:21,931
I want a signal system so perfect that
if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

377
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,432
of any of the huts in which we're working,

378
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,685
we can shut down without a sign.

379
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:31,524
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

380
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:36,654
I'll meet each of you on the exercise circuit,
we'll pound out the details.

381
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:43,411
- Nothing else, is there, Mac?
- I shouldn't think so, Roger.

382
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:12,857
Oh, hello. My name's Blythe.

383
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:15,443
Hendley.

384
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,992
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

385
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,995
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

386
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,498
Oh, a... bird watcher?

387
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:33,377
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

388
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,716
I suppose you have bird watchers in the States?

389
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,968
Yes, we have some.

390
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,638
Tea?

391
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:47,308
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

392
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,729
- Where's your kit?
- This is it.

393
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,524
The rest was confiscated in the last shakedown.

394
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:00,780
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more... personal items.

395
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,534
Such as.

396
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:09,330
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

397
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,208
I'll need a camera.

398
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:15,753
- What kind?
- A good one.

399
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,217
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

400
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,054
All right.

401
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:27,556
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

402
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,979
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

403
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,481
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

404
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:42,446
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

405
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:46,575
I must have used these wretched leaves
about 20 times.

406
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,286
It's not that I mind so much.

407
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,081
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.

408
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,293
Yeah. I'll get our wood.

409
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,512
Close up! Close up!

410
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,605
Close up!

411
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,108
Close up!

412
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:20,943
Close up!

413
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,280
- No me <i>sprechen</i> the English.
- Close up!

414
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,040
Splendid.

415
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,189
Blythe, what are you doing here?

416
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:10,993
I'm in Photographic Aerial Reconnaissance Interpretation.

417
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,955
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

418
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:20,169
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

419
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:25,007
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

420
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,386
I'm the forger.

421
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,951
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

422
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,494
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 110.

423
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:57,164
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

424
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:00,960
- 109? Right.
- I'll work in 107.

425
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:04,130
For now, Danny, Willie and their trap team
will be in 104.

426
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:08,467
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

427
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,804
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

428
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,640
Hendley figures there are 36 empty bunks.

429
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:18,435
We can tear up 15 and move the men around
so the goons won't miss them.

430
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,688
The rest will come from strips off the wall.

431
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,565
Is Hendley taking care of this himself?

432
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:23,774
Not yet.

433
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,986
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

434
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,173
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

435
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,801
Turn the water off!
Get your hands away!

436
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:53,137
Get away!

437
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:57,224
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

438
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,935
Stop this nonsense!

439
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,941
Get away! Turn the water off!

440
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,109
Somewhere!

441
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,152
In the stove,
we keep fire burning, always.

442
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,321
The goons will not feel like moving it.

443
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:56,700
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

444
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:59,995
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 113's washroom.

445
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:01,997
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

446
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,884
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

447
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:17,179
Not when you're organized, Mac.

448
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,061
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

449
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:28,274
It's perfect. Right through the middle
of the foundation.

450
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:35,698
Good luck to us, Danny.

451
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:57,011
Why 17?

452
00:43:57,177 --> 00:44:00,222
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

453
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:33,881
All right?

454
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:50,898
It's good.

455
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,742
It's very good.

456
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,656
- <i>Raus!</i>
- Get out!

457
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,617
- Get out!
- <i>Raus hier!</i>

458
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:46,829
<i>Raus! Fertig machen da hinten.</i>

459
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:55,546
<i>Du da hinten. Raus hier!</i>

460
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:08,934
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

461
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:10,144
Mopping up.

462
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,484
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

463
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,366
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

464
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,577
<i>Raus!</i>

465
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:32,541
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

466
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:09,328
<i>Raus.</i>

467
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:25,093
No. I vote no. Look, we've put the goons to sleep
exactly like you said.

468
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,765
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

469
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:33,185
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

470
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:36,146
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

471
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:38,941
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

472
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:42,569
I understand you two are contemplating a blitz-out.

473
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,821
Where'd you hear that... sir?

474
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,741
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

475
00:47:48,951 --> 00:47:51,787
We thought, perhaps, we might talk it over.

476
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:54,248
Why? It's only a two-man job.

477
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:58,085
Everybody in the camp is supposed to clear
all escape attempts in advance

478
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,711
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

479
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:03,215
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

480
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:08,554
It's just that...
Well, what sort of blitz were you contemplating?

481
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:12,474
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.

482
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:16,019
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

483
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:17,896
and then straight out.

484
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:21,984
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs in front,
pushes the dirt behind him.

485
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,946
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

486
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:30,951
By dawn we're under the wire,
across the open space, into the woods and gone.

487
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,584
Well, uh...

488
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,339
When do you intend to try this?

489
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:46,550
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

490
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:52,139
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

491
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:55,517
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

492
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:57,894
bloody close to being wire-happy.

493
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,981
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

494
00:49:01,148 --> 00:49:04,151
It'll work. I know it will.

495
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,535
Good luck.

496
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,746
Thank you.

497
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:21,752
- Hilts... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

498
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:24,546
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

499
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:26,715
Good night, sir.

500
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,349
Now, why didn't anybody think of that before?

501
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:38,935
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

502
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:42,064
But it'll bring every goon in the camp
down on top of us.

503
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,524
I don't know. Perhaps we're being too clever.

504
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,652
If we stop all the breakouts,

505
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,405
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunneling.

506
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:53,116
I hope it works. If it doesn't,

507
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:56,078
they're going to be in the cooler
for an awful long time.

508
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,918
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

509
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:53,009
This is the dirt from the compound.

510
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:55,095
This is from the tunnel.

511
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,646
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

512
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:07,774
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

513
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:11,361
It's the first place the ferrets'd look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.

514
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,613
Maybe we could dry it to the same color.

515
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,076
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

516
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:21,496
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

517
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,624
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

518
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:29,504
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

519
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:32,799
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

520
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,469
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

521
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,264
Didn't they teach you promptness in the RN?

522
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:42,392
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

523
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,646
The problem is somehow to get rid
of this tunnel dirt over the compound.

524
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,815
Well, of course.

525
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,526
Would you mind?

526
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:03,288
Now...

527
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:08,460
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

528
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:14,299
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,
you wander out into the compound

529
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:18,637
where you pull these strings in your pockets.

530
00:52:19,513 --> 00:52:21,848
Out come the pins.

531
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:29,481
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

532
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:32,359
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

533
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,487
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

534
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:38,448
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. it works.

535
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:44,204
Mac, this is what we'll do.

536
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:02,264
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

537
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:12,858
Nice garden you've got, sir.

538
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:47,851
All right. Let's look sharp.

539
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,151
That looks sharp.

540
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,282
Sir.

541
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:09,831
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

542
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:27,682
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

543
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:31,895
I am sorry the soil here isn't better suited
to your men's purpose.

544
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:34,064
We'll manage, sir.

545
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:47,202
I must say I am surprised
with the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

546
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:51,039
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

547
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:57,462
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

548
00:54:57,629 --> 00:55:03,635
- The English are keen on gardening.
- Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

549
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:07,013
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

550
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:11,184
Good point.

551
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:31,121
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

552
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,457
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

553
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:37,252
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

554
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,849
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

555
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:54,269
Here we are. Now, let's see.

556
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:56,938
Biscuits, two packets.

557
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:59,315
Coffee, two tins.

558
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,651
Bovril, one jar.

559
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,612
Cigarettes, six packets.

560
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:08,825
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, Cavendish.

561
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:10,994
And marmalade, mine.

562
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:15,623
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

563
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:20,420
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

564
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,674
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organization.

565
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:28,136
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

566
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,972
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

567
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:32,515
I'll see what I can do.

568
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:36,186
And, of course, any other identity cards,
personal papers,

569
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:38,646
documents you can put your hands on.

570
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:40,857
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

571
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:43,109
Good luck.

572
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:54,996
<i>O come all ye faithful</i>

573
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:58,666
<i>Joyful and triumphant</i>

574
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,502
<i>O come ye</i>

575
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:06,216
<i>O come ye to Bethlehem</i>

576
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:09,844
<i>Come and behold Him</i>

577
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:13,056
<i>Born the King of Angels</i>

578
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:16,684
<i>O come let us adore Him</i>

579
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,647
<i>O come let us adore Him</i>

580
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:25,026
<i>O come let us adore Him</i>

581
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:27,821
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

582
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,823
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

583
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:33,701
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

584
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:36,371
and this is holding us up very badly.

585
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,333
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

586
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,503
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

587
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,714
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

588
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:49,300
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

589
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:53,721
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

590
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:55,765
Mac.

591
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:58,017
Excellent.

592
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,436
Have it in by tomorrow night.

593
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:05,733
<i>Christ the Lord</i>

594
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,367
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

595
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:19,080
Thanks.

596
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:21,583
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

597
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:32,427
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

598
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:37,849
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

599
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:41,102
You probably have a couple of roommates, huh?

600
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:46,941
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

601
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:51,821
No, no. Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

602
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,698
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

603
00:58:53,865 --> 00:58:56,117
It was a red sky last night.

604
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:57,994
I never heard that before.

605
00:58:58,161 --> 00:59:00,622
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

606
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,124
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.
- Really?

607
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:06,628
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

608
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:11,424
I was working on my 20th
when the government abolished scouting

609
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,802
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

610
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:21,935
Werner, you think you'll stay in the army
after the war?

611
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,854
No. I'm not a well man.

612
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:26,856
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

613
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:30,193
Yes. I could tell you stories about my teeth

614
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,111
that would make your hair stand on end.

615
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,656
Our dentist here is a butcher.

616
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:38,618
But don't tell anyone I said so.

617
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:44,499
- It's a soldier's right to complain.
- Maybe in your army, but here?

618
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:49,504
One little criticism, and...
to the Russian front.

619
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:53,132
Is that so? Terrible.

620
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,010
That's terrible.

621
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,351
Werner.

622
01:00:05,979 --> 01:00:08,231
Why don't we go into my room?

623
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:11,484
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

624
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:16,823
I was just gonna make some coffee.

625
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,244
Real coffee.

626
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:52,233
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

627
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,402
Where is it?

628
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:00,283
<i>Marmelade. Ist ja wunderbar.</i>

629
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:03,786
My grandmother keeps sending me this stuff.

630
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:11,586
- <i>Ach du lieber Gott, Schokolade.</i>
- Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

631
01:01:18,134 --> 01:01:21,804
- <i>Von Lugers Butter.</i>
- Yeah. Keep it.

632
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:24,057
<i>Nein.</i> I must go.

633
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:27,435
It's OK. You can keep it.
We're friends.

634
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:30,646
With you in the cooler, will we be friends?
I must report this.

635
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:32,940
I don't understand you. Report what?

636
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:36,110
That you and I were chatting in my room?

637
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:39,030
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

638
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:42,617
- I'll never be able to eat it all.
- <i>Nein, ich muss jetzt weg.</i>

639
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:46,120
I'm sorry. All right.
Forget it. Forget it.

640
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:22,615
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

641
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:25,993
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman,
the masked shrike.

642
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,413
<i>Lanius nubicus.</i> The butcherbird.

643
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:32,333
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

644
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,295
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the coloring.

645
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:39,799
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

646
01:02:39,966 --> 01:02:43,010
A black rump, a black crown
with a bold white flash,

647
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,179
and a white line over the eye.

648
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:48,182
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country...

649
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:52,478
Hendley. Sit down.
You'll find drawing materials on the table.

650
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:57,108
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country,
olive groves and gardens.

651
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:59,694
Well, Hendley, have you taken to birds, too, now?

652
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:02,530
Yeah. Stick around. You might learn something.

653
01:03:02,697 --> 01:03:05,199
I have better things to do than draw birds.

654
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:11,372
The voice is a monotonous succession of scratchy,
complaining notes.

655
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:15,209
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

656
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:39,442
An <i>Urlaubsschein.</i> Permission to cross a frontier.
Here's another one.

657
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:42,111
Which one's the forgery?

658
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:45,573
- That one.
- That's right.

659
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,658
They both are.

660
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:51,329
What's holding us up now
is the new form of this travel permit.

661
01:03:51,496 --> 01:03:54,457
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

662
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:58,294
And a military identity card.

663
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,671
And a...

664
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:02,590
- An <i>Ausweis.</i>
- Yeah.

665
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:06,385
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

666
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:10,640
What appears to be the ferret assignments
for the next week.

667
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:13,559
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.

668
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,645
Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.

669
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:20,775
- Where did you get this?
- It's on loan.

670
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,946
In order to get the
right amount of outfits, Roger,

671
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:28,449
I suggest that we work mainly
from service uniforms.

672
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:32,453
I can do double-breasteds, single-breasteds,

673
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,498
and rather nice lounge suits.

674
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:38,292
Lapels. I can do quite a lot of things with those.

675
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:43,047
I can have them deep like that,
or high ones like that.

676
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:47,260
Here's one that we're working on right now.

677
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:50,137
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

678
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:55,810
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

679
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:59,230
And, uh...

680
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,819
here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

681
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:08,990
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

682
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:12,159
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

683
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:16,497
That's Sorren's department.
Now, I've started working on the other materials.

684
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,791
This blanket.

685
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,003
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.

686
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,296
- Coats.
- Yes.

687
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:26,299
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

688
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:29,343
Those battle dresses,
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

689
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,181
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of working man's outfits.

690
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:36,684
Blanket ticking.

691
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:41,397
Now, I've made these
into rather nice little Waistcoats.

692
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:45,192
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

693
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,695
Just take a look at this, Roger.

694
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:52,992
Now, this blanket material,
we scrape this down until it's really smooth,

695
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:55,494
and then dye it with boot polish.

696
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:59,540
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

697
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:02,585
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

698
01:06:02,752 --> 01:06:04,962
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

699
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:07,757
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

700
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:10,885
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

701
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,317
Good morning, Hilts.

702
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:47,755
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

703
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,840
- When?
- Seventeen days, 7th of July.

704
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,884
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

705
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:56,430
- Is Ives going with you?
- Yeah, if he wants to.

706
01:06:57,431 --> 01:07:01,102
You, uh... You know that Ives
is close to cracking?

707
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:03,896
Yeah.

708
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,649
Better for him to go out in the tunnel, huh?

709
01:07:06,816 --> 01:07:08,651
Safer.

710
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:15,449
Right.

711
01:07:17,827 --> 01:07:21,330
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

712
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:27,128
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

713
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,839
in this camp who are trying to escape.

714
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:32,633
I appreciate that.

715
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:37,012
Something's coming, I can feel it,

716
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:40,224
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

717
01:07:40,975 --> 01:07:43,394
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

718
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:45,980
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

719
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:49,567
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

720
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:55,448
Yes, well... as I was saying, uh, Hilts,

721
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,909
we have maps of Germany,
general maps, that is.

722
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:03,205
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

723
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:05,791
But what we do not have...

724
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,170
is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

725
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:12,423
We've tried every goon in the camp. No go.

726
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:16,260
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

727
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:18,971
We want to know where we hit the main roads.

728
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:22,808
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

729
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:27,313
And, most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

730
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,939
to the railway station.

731
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,486
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

732
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:36,322
I'm not gonna be making maps for you guys.

733
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:38,491
I'm gonna be so far away,

734
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:42,036
you won't hear if they're shooting at me
with howitzers.

735
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:45,039
- Understandable.
- Completely.

736
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,877
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

737
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,841
Interesting idea.

738
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:59,220
- How many you taking out?
- Two hundred and fifty.

739
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,350
Two hundred and fifty?

740
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:05,935
Yeah.

741
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,562
You're crazy. You too.

742
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:12,066
Two hundred and fifty guys
just walking down the road, just like that.

743
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:16,111
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

744
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,739
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

745
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:20,741
maps, compasses, rations.

746
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,577
You're gonna alert every goon in the country.

747
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,956
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

748
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:31,377
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you up
so fast it'd make your head swim.

749
01:09:34,797 --> 01:09:36,715
Yes, well... thanks, anyway.

750
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,134
If I can help on the tunnel,
let me know.

751
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,263
- That's good of you.
- Any time.

752
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:45,766
Wait a minute.

753
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:48,936
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire

754
01:09:49,103 --> 01:09:52,106
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

755
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:54,859
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

756
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,486
so you can get the information you need?

757
01:09:57,653 --> 01:10:02,283
Yes. One has to ask some very strange things
in the job I have.

758
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:05,619
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

759
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,580
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

760
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:10,624
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

761
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:15,170
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

762
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:23,597
Check.

763
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:31,896
- Herr Hendley, I...
- Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

764
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:36,191
What's the matter, Werner?

765
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,527
My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

766
01:10:38,694 --> 01:10:41,947
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

767
01:10:42,823 --> 01:10:44,200
He lost his wallet.

768
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:48,370
Do you realize what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

769
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:50,664
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

770
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:56,462
I've looked every place, every place.

771
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:00,674
I must have lost them while I was in here.

772
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,260
- No.
- Yes.

773
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:07,181
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

774
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:09,767
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

775
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,770
Werner.

776
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:16,023
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

777
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,860
if you and I were seen probing around
at this time of night.

778
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:22,863
Look, I'll find them.

779
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,075
I promise you I'll find 'em
if I have to tear this room apart.

780
01:11:32,748 --> 01:11:35,292
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

781
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:36,877
- Werner.
- Yes?

782
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,546
There is one small favor.

783
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:41,006
A camera.

784
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:47,054
We want to take some snapshots.
You know... keepsakes.

785
01:11:48,389 --> 01:11:52,559
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

786
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:54,353
Focal-plane shutter.

787
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:59,858
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

788
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:02,903
Let me know when you got it.

789
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:12,246
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner,
but I like him.

790
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:14,456
Checkmate.

791
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,649
How soon's our air pump going to be ready?

792
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:44,278
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

793
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:46,655
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

794
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:49,491
- No good?
- Today, three times.

795
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:10,596
Willie, you all right? Pull!

796
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,835
You're gonna have to shore up
the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.

797
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:46,382
- All 335 feet of it.
- Four times today.

798
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:51,553
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

799
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:55,808
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?

800
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:02,231
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

801
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:06,527
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

802
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,695
OK, Willie.

803
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:12,533
<i>On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

804
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:15,285
<i>A partridge in a pear tree</i>

805
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:18,705
<i>On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

806
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:22,543
<i>Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree</i>

807
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:25,963
<i>On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

808
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,549
<i>Four calling birds, three French hens</i>

809
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:32,344
<i>Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree</i>

810
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:36,056
<i>On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

811
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:39,268
<i>Five gold rings</i>

812
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,104
How's it going with the rafters up there?

813
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:44,565
Taking out one in four.

814
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:51,196
Stay with it.

815
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:54,575
<i>Five gold rings</i>

816
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,618
<i>Four calling birds, three French hens</i>

817
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:00,289
<i>Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree</i>

818
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:04,001
<i>On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

819
01:15:04,168 --> 01:15:06,587
<i>Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying</i>

820
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:10,048
<i>Five gold rings</i>

821
01:15:10,215 --> 01:15:12,176
<i>Four calling birds, three French hens</i>

822
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:16,597
<i>Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree</i>

823
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:33,071
<i>Five gold rings, four calling birds...</i>

824
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,281
Bloody singing.

825
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:36,325
I've never worked so hard in all my life.
Hi, Hilts.

826
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:37,451
Say, Cavendish...

827
01:15:37,618 --> 01:15:39,620
<i>Three French hens, two turtle doves</i>

828
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,663
<i>And a partridge in a pear...</i>

829
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,832
<i>Allez...</i> hup!

830
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,341
Never mind.

831
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:04,978
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.

832
01:16:05,145 --> 01:16:08,982
Splendid. Simply splendid.

833
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:12,321
This should do very nicely.

834
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,491
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

835
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:21,828
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

836
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:34,234
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

837
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:36,820
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.

838
01:17:36,987 --> 01:17:40,741
- How much further to the trees?
- We make it 50 feet, sir.

839
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:44,244
- Dark of the moon is the seventh...
- Eight and ninth.

840
01:17:44,453 --> 01:17:46,288
A day earlier in August.

841
01:17:52,419 --> 01:17:54,421
Morning.

842
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:57,424
There he goes again.

843
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:00,177
Why is he buying up
all the potatoes in the camp?

844
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:03,180
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

845
01:18:03,347 --> 01:18:05,766
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves in
every night.

846
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:09,102
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

847
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:13,273
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

848
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,276
Put the entire effort into Tom,
and press on into the trees.

849
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:18,028
Right, Roger.

850
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:52,891
About face!

851
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,769
Forward march!

852
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:06,863
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

853
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:09,032
It's the Fourth of July.

854
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:20,627
What the devil's this?

855
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:28,468
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

856
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:32,264
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

857
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,975
- Quite right, too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

858
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:38,979
- And to getting home.
- Very well. We accept.

859
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:40,772
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

860
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,357
Gentlemen, follow us.

861
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:44,609
About face!

862
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:06,298
Company... <i>halt!</i>

863
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:12,679
All right, let's line up down here!

864
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,932
All right, grab a cup!

865
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,184
Line it up! Here we go.

866
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:27,861
That explains what happened to the potatoes.

867
01:22:28,069 --> 01:22:30,989
No harm in closing down Tom for one day, Roger.

868
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,867
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

869
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:35,660
There's only 14 feet to go, sir,

870
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:37,871
and you can feel it
throughout the whole camp.

871
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:41,207
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

872
01:22:41,374 --> 01:22:43,251
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

873
01:22:43,418 --> 01:22:47,005
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.

874
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:49,424
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

875
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:51,176
Keep it moving.

876
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:54,220
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

877
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,931
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

878
01:22:57,098 --> 01:23:00,185
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

879
01:23:00,894 --> 01:23:04,064
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

880
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:08,068
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

881
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:12,530
- Keep it moving.
- Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

882
01:23:12,697 --> 01:23:16,117
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

883
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:19,329
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

884
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:36,304
Get good and stoned, my friend.

885
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:40,892
Keep it going. Keep it...

886
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:45,188
No taxation without representation.

887
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:47,816
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

888
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:51,695
Keep it going, fellas.
Enjoy yourselves.

889
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:55,532
- Well, let's drink to Tom.
- To Tom.

890
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:07,293
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

891
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,463
that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.

892
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:14,426
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

893
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:20,306
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

894
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:23,810
Call on Ives.

895
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:35,321
Cheers, Hendley!

896
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:45,290
You know what that is?

897
01:24:45,457 --> 01:24:47,751
I'll tell you what it isn't.

898
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:50,211
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

899
01:24:52,005 --> 01:24:53,673
How do you like it, sir?

900
01:24:54,674 --> 01:24:58,636
- Well, it's, uh...
- To the colonies.

901
01:24:58,803 --> 01:25:00,847
Independence.

902
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:11,024
How are you managing over there without us?
Getting along all right, are you?

903
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:14,068
We seem to be getting along
all right, shir... sir.

904
01:25:22,327 --> 01:25:24,704
Yes, well, it's, uh...

905
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:27,540
It's good stuff, Hilts.

906
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:32,128
Thank you, sir.

907
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,567
Danny! Here's to...

908
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:05,119
Roger, goons in 105.

909
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:07,413
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

910
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,918
We have to ignore it.

911
01:26:12,085 --> 01:26:15,588
If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

912
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:18,591
Here's to going home.

913
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:36,609
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

914
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:38,820
Home!

915
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:55,178
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you in the tunnel
with us. To Tom.

916
01:26:58,164 --> 01:26:59,340
Never mind.

917
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:02,135
You'll be walking down Argyle Street
in a couple of weeks.

918
01:27:02,302 --> 01:27:06,806
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.

919
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,851
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

920
01:27:10,018 --> 01:27:11,778
We're nearly at the trees.

921
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,655
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

922
01:28:20,588 --> 01:28:22,715
<i>Das ist es also.</i>

923
01:28:29,389 --> 01:28:31,349
<i>Los, holen Sie die Wache!</i>

924
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,899
<i>Ich hab's doch geahnt.</i>

925
01:28:42,443 --> 01:28:44,779
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

926
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,753
It's the tunnel.

927
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:19,564
Success.

928
01:29:43,463 --> 01:29:47,133
- Ives!
- <i>Halt! Halt!</i>

929
01:29:47,675 --> 01:29:48,760
<i>Halt!</i>

930
01:30:55,827 --> 01:31:00,248
Sir, let me know the exact information you need.

931
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:03,626
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

932
01:31:05,878 --> 01:31:10,758
Open up, Harry. We dig.
Around the clock.

933
01:32:48,522 --> 01:32:50,816
- Cooler.
- Right.

934
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:57,573
Well, I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.

935
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:01,118
He wasn't caught.

936
01:33:14,674 --> 01:33:16,968
Hilts, welcome home.

937
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,063
Danny?

938
01:34:13,274 --> 01:34:15,359
Danny?

939
01:34:18,237 --> 01:34:20,239
Danny?

940
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:27,913
Are you all right, Danny?

941
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:34,462
Yes. All right.

942
01:34:36,589 --> 01:34:39,884
All right. Bring some shovels.
I'm all right.

943
01:34:42,303 --> 01:34:44,722
For God's sake, you've left out a whole eagle.

944
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:46,891
That's impossible.

945
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:49,977
Yes.

946
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,689
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

947
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:59,111
- I'm sorry, Colin.
- It's all right, Smithy.

948
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:03,991
It's getting late. You push off to bed.
I'll pack up here.

949
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:06,077
All right.

950
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:08,788
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

951
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,455
I can't see a bloody thing.

952
01:35:57,253 --> 01:35:58,254
<i>Hut ab.</i>

953
01:36:00,548 --> 01:36:02,800
<i>Sehr gut. In Ordnung. Danke schön.</i>

954
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:04,969
- <i>Bitte schön.</i>
- <i>Herein.</i>

955
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:10,307
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

956
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:15,020
- <i>Wie heiben Sie?</i>
- <i>Erich Stressel, aus München.</i>

957
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:16,188
<i>Warum sind Sie hier?</i>

958
01:36:16,355 --> 01:36:19,733
<i>Ich habe Urlaub bekommen.
Meine Mutter ist krank.</i>

959
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:23,737
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

960
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,032
Watch it. That's the easiest way
to trip up a suspect.

961
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,200
Don't fall for that old gag.

962
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:31,036
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

963
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:33,205
<i>Herein.</i>

964
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:48,721
One, two, three, four, five.

965
01:37:07,907 --> 01:37:08,949
Roger.

966
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:15,581
No, it's me.

967
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:20,044
How do you like the old escape suit?

968
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:22,213
Fine, fine.

969
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,550
Colin.

970
01:37:28,636 --> 01:37:31,055
How do you like mine?

971
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:33,599
It looks splendid.

972
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:02,002
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

973
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:06,006
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

974
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:11,512
Danny, we're getting out through the tunnel.
We're almost clear.

975
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,473
Please, Willie, let me alone.

976
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,268
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.

977
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:19,812
So I'm going out through the wire.

978
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:26,986
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

979
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:30,155
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

980
01:38:30,322 --> 01:38:32,825
- I go out now.
- No.

981
01:38:33,826 --> 01:38:37,162
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

982
01:38:44,378 --> 01:38:46,380
Don't do that.

983
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:50,551
Willie...

984
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:54,305
Since I was a boy,

985
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:58,892
I hate... and feared little rooms,

986
01:38:59,059 --> 01:39:01,186
closets, caves.

987
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:03,731
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

988
01:39:03,939 --> 01:39:06,191
Because I must get out.

989
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:09,528
I hide the fear, and I dig.

990
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:14,533
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

991
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:17,161
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head,

992
01:39:17,328 --> 01:39:20,205
and ruin the escape for everybody.

993
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:25,044
So I go now.

994
01:39:29,715 --> 01:39:32,718
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

995
01:39:34,219 --> 01:39:37,765
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

996
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:41,060
All right.

997
01:39:49,276 --> 01:39:51,278
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

998
01:39:52,196 --> 01:39:54,448
Well, how do you think we look?

999
01:39:54,615 --> 01:39:58,118
<i>Guten Abend, mein Herr.
Wie geht es Ihnen?</i>

1000
01:39:58,285 --> 01:39:59,953
It's as bad as all that?

1001
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:05,084
Colin, I want first of all to say that
without you,

1002
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,752
we would not have been ready.

1003
01:40:06,919 --> 01:40:10,464
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

1004
01:40:12,257 --> 01:40:14,259
What's the matter, Roger?

1005
01:40:15,386 --> 01:40:17,721
You can't go.

1006
01:40:18,305 --> 01:40:20,182
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

1007
01:40:20,349 --> 01:40:21,308
Why?

1008
01:40:21,475 --> 01:40:24,311
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

1009
01:40:24,478 --> 01:40:26,563
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

1010
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:29,108
That's ridiculous.

1011
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:33,612
That's ridiculous.
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.

1012
01:40:33,779 --> 01:40:37,116
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly!

1013
01:40:37,783 --> 01:40:41,245
I can see... that pin down there.

1014
01:40:41,412 --> 01:40:44,164
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

1015
01:40:55,843 --> 01:40:59,138
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

1016
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,640
Yes, of course.

1017
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:05,894
Put the pin down there, will you?

1018
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,480
All right.

1019
01:41:12,776 --> 01:41:17,114
All right. Come on. Come on. Sit down.

1020
01:41:18,741 --> 01:41:21,660
Sit down. It was a good try.

1021
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:26,665
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

1022
01:41:26,832 --> 01:41:28,500
It's too risky for you.

1023
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:30,502
Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

1024
01:41:30,669 --> 01:41:32,838
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

1025
01:41:33,005 --> 01:41:38,343
We all know the score here.
Well, at least... most of us do.

1026
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:41,638
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

1027
01:41:41,805 --> 01:41:46,018
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

1028
01:41:46,185 --> 01:41:50,689
But once we get past that wire
and have them looking all over Germany for us,

1029
01:41:50,856 --> 01:41:53,192
that mission is accomplished.

1030
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:56,945
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.

1031
01:41:57,696 --> 01:41:59,531
You mean getting home?

1032
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:02,409
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1033
01:42:02,576 --> 01:42:05,579
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that, too?

1034
01:42:05,746 --> 01:42:07,748
I'm sure you have.

1035
01:42:08,916 --> 01:42:10,918
I know Colin has.

1036
01:42:11,919 --> 01:42:14,046
And, Roger, I have, too.

1037
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:16,507
We think we can make it all the way.

1038
01:42:16,673 --> 01:42:21,261
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

1039
01:42:21,428 --> 01:42:25,516
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1040
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:29,686
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1041
01:42:31,188 --> 01:42:33,690
No one has said you can't go.

1042
01:42:35,067 --> 01:42:37,402
That's true.

1043
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:40,072
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1044
01:42:42,157 --> 01:42:46,161
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1045
01:42:46,328 --> 01:42:51,750
or dare go, or should be permitted to play God,

1046
01:42:53,043 --> 01:42:55,087
I can't answer you.

1047
01:42:56,296 --> 01:42:58,048
But I can tell you

1048
01:42:58,215 --> 01:43:02,219
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

1049
01:43:02,386 --> 01:43:05,430
and must therefore be eliminated from the operation.

1050
01:43:16,483 --> 01:43:21,655
Colin's not a blind man as long as he's with me,
and he's going with me.

1051
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:28,912
It's all right with you, Colin?

1052
01:43:31,874 --> 01:43:34,960
Oh, yes. Quite.

1053
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:48,056
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape numbers
to be altered accordingly.

1054
01:43:48,974 --> 01:43:50,976
Good night, gentlemen.

1055
01:43:57,691 --> 01:43:59,735
Actually...

1056
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:02,946
he's quite right.

1057
01:44:03,113 --> 01:44:05,157
He's completely right.

1058
01:44:05,574 --> 01:44:07,784
I really shouldn't go at all.

1059
01:44:07,951 --> 01:44:11,204
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1060
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:14,958
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1061
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:21,173
I can see things up here. Close to.
I can see to work, but, uh...

1062
01:44:23,884 --> 01:44:28,513
- you're just a blur.
- I know.

1063
01:44:29,139 --> 01:44:31,600
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1064
01:44:31,767 --> 01:44:33,602
Colin, do you have any tea?

1065
01:44:35,103 --> 01:44:37,856
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1066
01:44:39,316 --> 01:44:41,318
Splendid.

1067
01:45:00,212 --> 01:45:01,213
<i>Raus.</i>

1068
01:45:27,197 --> 01:45:31,034
- Hi, Hilts.
- Hey, Mac.

1069
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,163
When?

1070
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,791
Tonight. We thought they'd never let you out.

1071
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:40,502
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1072
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:43,547
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1073
01:46:54,576 --> 01:46:55,827
What time?

1074
01:46:57,996 --> 01:47:00,123
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1075
01:47:04,252 --> 01:47:05,337
You OK?

1076
01:47:16,431 --> 01:47:18,266
Cavendish.

1077
01:47:18,433 --> 01:47:19,768
Griff, down there.

1078
01:47:19,935 --> 01:47:21,937
Goff, there.

1079
01:47:41,832 --> 01:47:44,918
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1080
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:48,964
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1081
01:48:18,577 --> 01:48:20,203
There are the lights.

1082
01:48:21,955 --> 01:48:23,373
Right on the tick, Danny.

1083
01:48:33,717 --> 01:48:36,803
Look down the tunnel, Danny.
It's lovely.

1084
01:48:39,222 --> 01:48:42,809
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1085
01:48:44,561 --> 01:48:46,646
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1086
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:51,193
Yes. No.

1087
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:53,820
I don't know.

1088
01:48:57,199 --> 01:48:58,366
It's time, Roger.

1089
01:49:11,504 --> 01:49:15,175
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1090
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,347
It's all clear, sir.

1091
01:49:29,189 --> 01:49:31,107
All set, Roger.

1092
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,372
Roger.

1093
01:49:45,538 --> 01:49:47,582
Good luck.

1094
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:20,365
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.

1095
01:50:20,532 --> 01:50:23,576
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1096
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:35,922
Willie... I can't wait. I must get out.

1097
01:50:36,172 --> 01:50:39,926
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1098
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:11,291
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

1099
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,003
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1100
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:18,131
Danny, tell me what this is,
and tell me quickly!

1101
01:51:18,298 --> 01:51:22,302
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1102
01:51:22,469 --> 01:51:24,637
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.

1103
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:26,848
Let me out. Let me out.

1104
01:51:30,143 --> 01:51:32,437
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out.

1105
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:49,579
Danny? What is it?

1106
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:51,956
Danny, what's going on?

1107
01:51:52,123 --> 01:51:55,335
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.

1108
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:04,594
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

1109
01:52:04,761 --> 01:52:08,598
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1110
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:11,351
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1111
01:52:11,893 --> 01:52:16,648
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder
with your right foot. Got it?

1112
01:52:16,815 --> 01:52:18,817
Down you go.

1113
01:52:33,998 --> 01:52:35,959
Danny cut out, huh?

1114
01:52:36,126 --> 01:52:38,837
Willie took him up top.
Hilts, I, uh...

1115
01:52:52,016 --> 01:52:54,602
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1116
01:53:11,578 --> 01:53:13,621
Right.

1117
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:21,629
Bartlett.

1118
01:54:00,627 --> 01:54:02,879
All right?

1119
01:54:03,046 --> 01:54:04,672
Hold onto yourself.
You're 20 feet short.

1120
01:54:04,839 --> 01:54:06,633
What do you mean?

1121
01:54:06,799 --> 01:54:09,552
Twenty feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1122
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:12,222
The guard is between us and the lights.

1123
01:54:12,388 --> 01:54:14,015
How could that happen?

1124
01:54:14,182 --> 01:54:16,059
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1125
01:54:31,991 --> 01:54:34,911
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1126
01:54:35,787 --> 01:54:37,705
We could postpone it.

1127
01:54:37,872 --> 01:54:41,125
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1128
01:54:45,129 --> 01:54:48,591
One chance.
When the guard goes to the far end,

1129
01:54:48,758 --> 01:54:49,968
you might be able to move out.

1130
01:54:50,134 --> 01:54:54,138
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1131
01:54:54,305 --> 01:54:55,431
What about the towers?

1132
01:54:55,598 --> 01:54:58,977
They're gonna be watching the compound,
not the woods.

1133
01:55:03,314 --> 01:55:05,817
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1134
01:55:06,776 --> 01:55:08,361
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1135
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:12,699
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1136
01:55:14,492 --> 01:55:16,327
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1137
01:55:16,494 --> 01:55:18,204
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!

1138
01:55:18,371 --> 01:55:21,165
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1139
01:55:37,015 --> 01:55:41,352
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1140
01:55:41,519 --> 01:55:43,104
Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?

1141
01:55:43,271 --> 01:55:45,523
I don't think so, sir.

1142
01:56:07,879 --> 01:56:09,881
He's over there.

1143
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:17,972
Right. You go first, Eric.

1144
01:56:19,182 --> 01:56:21,559
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1145
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:35,114
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1146
01:56:35,406 --> 01:56:36,824
Right.

1147
01:56:49,629 --> 01:56:51,089
Thank you.

1148
01:56:51,255 --> 01:56:53,257
- Good luck.
- Right.

1149
01:57:18,116 --> 01:57:19,951
We're moving.

1150
01:57:26,624 --> 01:57:30,962
Danny, they're moving through the tunnel now.
They're getting out.

1151
01:57:33,339 --> 01:57:38,928
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and came to England
because you're a flier.

1152
01:57:39,095 --> 01:57:43,307
You came because you wanted to fly with us
and fight the Germans.

1153
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:46,477
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1154
01:57:48,312 --> 01:57:50,440
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1155
01:57:50,606 --> 01:57:54,736
everything you've done
will have been for nothing, nothing!

1156
01:58:23,097 --> 01:58:25,099
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1157
01:58:27,685 --> 01:58:29,687
- In here, Colin.
- Come on.

1158
01:58:30,188 --> 01:58:32,273
Sit down.

1159
01:58:36,903 --> 01:58:39,197
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.

1160
01:58:42,825 --> 01:58:46,037
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1161
01:58:46,204 --> 01:58:49,165
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1162
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:55,880
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1163
01:58:56,088 --> 01:58:58,049
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1164
01:59:05,014 --> 01:59:08,226
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1165
01:59:08,392 --> 01:59:10,895
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1166
01:59:11,062 --> 01:59:15,566
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1167
01:59:16,692 --> 01:59:18,569
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1168
01:59:28,621 --> 01:59:29,622
What's that?

1169
01:59:31,582 --> 01:59:34,168
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1170
01:59:34,335 --> 01:59:36,838
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1171
01:59:38,089 --> 01:59:41,300
Come on, Colin.
We can get out when the lights go down.

1172
01:59:53,938 --> 01:59:55,565
Willie.

1173
01:59:56,065 --> 01:59:57,066
Willie!

1174
01:59:59,193 --> 02:00:02,238
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1175
02:00:08,536 --> 02:00:10,580
Get 'em out.

1176
02:00:15,877 --> 02:00:17,753
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1177
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,507
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1178
02:00:23,301 --> 02:00:26,596
Light the lamps down there!

1179
02:00:27,138 --> 02:00:29,891
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.

1180
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:33,102
Danny, it's all right.
Listen to me!

1181
02:00:34,312 --> 02:00:36,314
Danny, look.

1182
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:44,155
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1183
02:00:51,037 --> 02:00:53,164
What the hell's going on?

1184
02:00:53,331 --> 02:00:56,167
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1185
02:00:58,127 --> 02:01:00,129
Go.

1186
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:09,513
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1187
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:11,766
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1188
02:01:11,933 --> 02:01:14,018
Get him out fast.

1189
02:01:17,003 --> 02:01:18,022
Come on.

1190
02:01:21,025 --> 02:01:22,818
Come on, Danny, move.

1191
02:01:39,043 --> 02:01:41,045
Up you go.

1192
02:01:47,051 --> 02:01:48,886
Give me your bag.

1193
02:01:55,726 --> 02:01:57,728
We're on the rope!

1194
02:02:42,815 --> 02:02:44,442
You and I had better get out,

1195
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:46,444
or we won't have a chance
of any of the trains.

1196
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:49,822
It's moving. We'll just have
to pass the instructions from man to man.

1197
02:02:51,782 --> 02:02:53,576
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1198
02:03:20,269 --> 02:03:22,146
<i>Ist da jemand?</i>

1199
02:03:28,486 --> 02:03:30,946
- <i>Hast du etwas gehört?</i>
- <i>Nein.</i>

1200
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:42,541
Come on, come on.

1201
02:04:01,519 --> 02:04:02,520
Come on.

1202
02:04:21,038 --> 02:04:22,706
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1203
02:04:23,582 --> 02:04:25,584
Don't shoot!

1204
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:28,045
Don't shoot!

1205
02:04:32,216 --> 02:04:34,385
Get off! We're coming back!

1206
02:04:57,575 --> 02:05:00,578
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot of shooting
going on up there.

1207
02:05:00,744 --> 02:05:03,539
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1208
02:05:03,706 --> 02:05:06,208
We would've heard the shots before.

1209
02:05:08,586 --> 02:05:10,921
- Pull!
- Wait for me.

1210
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:19,263
Out.

1211
02:05:40,117 --> 02:05:41,285
Out.

1212
02:05:57,801 --> 02:05:59,929
<i>Die Aufstellung, Herr Hauptmann.</i>

1213
02:06:10,356 --> 02:06:13,984
- <i>Sechsundsiebzig.</i>
- <i>Jawohl.</i>

1214
02:06:15,736 --> 02:06:17,696
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

1215
02:06:17,863 --> 02:06:19,323
Seventy-six.

1216
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:20,991
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

1217
02:06:35,422 --> 02:06:37,424
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1218
02:07:34,398 --> 02:07:37,568
Half the guys who missed their trains
are piled up here.

1219
02:07:37,735 --> 02:07:40,863
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1220
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:42,823
Makes quite a group.

1221
02:07:42,990 --> 02:07:46,577
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1222
02:09:34,643 --> 02:09:36,103
<i>Merci.</i>

1223
02:11:51,446 --> 02:11:53,156
<i>Können Sie mich mitnehmen?</i>

1224
02:11:53,323 --> 02:11:55,117
<i>Aber gerne. Steigen Sie ein.</i>

1225
02:11:55,284 --> 02:11:56,577
<i>Danke schön.</i>

1226
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:46,269
<i>Ihre Pässe, bitte.</i>

1227
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,402
Tallyho.

1228
02:14:16,925 --> 02:14:19,970
- <i>Vous êtes Français?</i>
- <i>Oui.</i>

1229
02:14:20,137 --> 02:14:22,139
<i>Moi, aussi.</i>

1230
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:29,980
- <i>Merci bien.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

1231
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:38,321
Tallyho.

1232
02:14:47,330 --> 02:14:50,667
- <i>Sie reisen für eine Firma?</i>
- <i>Ja.</i>

1233
02:14:50,834 --> 02:14:52,836
<i>Für mein...</i>

1234
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:55,672
<i>Fur mein Geschäft.</i>

1235
02:14:57,758 --> 02:14:59,801
- <i>Danke.</i>
- <i>Danke.</i>

1236
02:15:11,146 --> 02:15:15,066
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.

1237
02:15:15,233 --> 02:15:17,235
All right.

1238
02:15:21,698 --> 02:15:22,991
I'll tell you when.

1239
02:15:23,158 --> 02:15:26,036
I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1240
02:15:45,514 --> 02:15:48,475
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1241
02:15:48,642 --> 02:15:50,977
That's quite exciting.

1242
02:15:52,354 --> 02:15:55,357
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1243
02:16:51,371 --> 02:16:53,373
Switzerland.

1244
02:17:26,323 --> 02:17:27,490
Hey!

1245
02:17:27,657 --> 02:17:29,993
<i>Wo willst du hin? Komm mal her.</i>

1246
02:17:38,209 --> 02:17:41,296
<i>Wo willst du denn hin?
Zeig mal deinen Ausweis.</i>

1247
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:36,781
Bartlett.

1248
02:21:53,631 --> 02:21:55,383
<i>Alles auf den Boden.</i>

1249
02:22:36,299 --> 02:22:40,970
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I, uh... I hadn't quite decided.

1250
02:22:41,137 --> 02:22:43,765
What information were you to collect on the way?

1251
02:22:43,932 --> 02:22:44,891
None.

1252
02:22:45,058 --> 02:22:47,644
What sabotage directions did you receive?

1253
02:22:47,810 --> 02:22:50,146
What have you done with your papers?

1254
02:22:51,981 --> 02:22:55,318
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1255
02:22:55,485 --> 02:22:58,655
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1256
02:22:58,821 --> 02:23:00,823
All I did was escape from a prison camp.

1257
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:03,618
You'd do the same
if you'd been locked up for three years.

1258
02:23:05,078 --> 02:23:06,037
I wanted to get home.

1259
02:23:06,204 --> 02:23:08,581
I don't think you'll see your wife again.

1260
02:23:08,748 --> 02:23:11,626
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1261
02:23:11,793 --> 02:23:14,003
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1262
02:23:15,338 --> 02:23:18,841
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1263
02:23:19,008 --> 02:23:22,845
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1264
02:23:24,514 --> 02:23:27,183
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1265
02:23:27,350 --> 02:23:29,686
I picked up when I was shot down.

1266
02:23:40,321 --> 02:23:43,199
And you lost your insignia over the years?

1267
02:23:43,366 --> 02:23:45,201
That's right.

1268
02:23:45,368 --> 02:23:47,704
<i>Bringen Sie ihn zu den anderen.</i>

1269
02:23:50,456 --> 02:23:52,792
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1270
02:24:17,442 --> 02:24:19,444
Hello, boys.

1271
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:25,241
Hello.

1272
02:24:27,452 --> 02:24:29,912
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1273
02:24:31,372 --> 02:24:33,916
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1274
02:24:34,083 --> 02:24:36,711
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1275
02:24:54,562 --> 02:24:56,939
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1276
02:24:57,106 --> 02:24:59,734
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1277
02:26:07,677 --> 02:26:12,473
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1278
02:26:12,974 --> 02:26:14,642
When the engine catches, don't move,

1279
02:26:14,809 --> 02:26:17,854
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1280
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,201
Go!

1281
02:27:22,627 --> 02:27:24,712
Next stop, Switzerland!

1282
02:28:47,003 --> 02:28:50,506
- The Alps.
- Splendid.

1283
02:29:02,435 --> 02:29:06,814
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1284
02:29:33,674 --> 02:29:37,386
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.

1285
02:30:03,037 --> 02:30:05,623
Go that way! I'll follow.

1286
02:30:30,106 --> 02:30:31,232
Hendley?

1287
02:30:36,112 --> 02:30:38,114
Colin!

1288
02:30:41,909 --> 02:30:44,286
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1289
02:30:48,332 --> 02:30:52,628
Colin... I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1290
02:30:53,963 --> 02:30:55,965
That's all right.

1291
02:30:56,966 --> 02:30:58,968
Thank you for...

1292
02:30:59,802 --> 02:31:02,763
getting me... out.

1293
02:32:43,823 --> 02:32:44,865
<i>Los, aufstehen.</i>

1294
02:32:53,958 --> 02:32:54,959
<i>Hände hoch.</i>

1295
02:33:39,962 --> 02:33:42,464
<i>Bonjour, messieurs.
Comment ça va? Ça va bien?</i>

1296
02:33:42,631 --> 02:33:43,591
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1297
02:33:43,757 --> 02:33:46,802
<i>Comme d'habitude, trois Pernod,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

1298
02:33:48,262 --> 02:33:50,264
<i>Trois Pernod, Papa.</i>

1299
02:34:05,154 --> 02:34:07,114
<i>Café Suzette.</i>

1300
02:34:08,282 --> 02:34:10,326
<i>Oui.</i>

1301
02:34:13,829 --> 02:34:17,499
- <i>Et voilà, messieurs, les trois Pernod.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

1302
02:34:17,666 --> 02:34:19,001
<i>Deux...</i>

1303
02:34:19,168 --> 02:34:21,420
<i>Et trois. Et voilà de l'eau.</i>

1304
02:34:21,587 --> 02:34:24,006
- <i>Bon appétit, messieurs.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

1305
02:34:26,759 --> 02:34:30,054
<i>Monsieur. Téléphone pour vous.</i>

1306
02:34:31,138 --> 02:34:33,974
- <i>Téléphone pour moi?</i>
- <i>Oui, monsieur, téléphone.</i>

1307
02:34:34,141 --> 02:34:35,184
<i>Par ici.</i>

1308
02:34:35,351 --> 02:34:37,353
<i>Voilà, téléphone.</i>

1309
02:34:37,853 --> 02:34:39,939
<i>Merci.</i>

1310
02:34:40,522 --> 02:34:42,524
Hello?

1311
02:34:43,192 --> 02:34:45,194
Hello?

1312
02:35:22,231 --> 02:35:23,732
Resistance.

1313
02:35:23,899 --> 02:35:25,901
Resistance?

1314
02:35:26,318 --> 02:35:28,362
You are English?

1315
02:35:29,029 --> 02:35:30,698
I'm Australian.

1316
02:35:30,906 --> 02:35:33,575
- <i>Dites-moi...</i>
- You can speak English. I understand.

1317
02:35:33,742 --> 02:35:36,412
Bloody good. I'm a British officer.

1318
02:35:36,578 --> 02:35:39,873
I've just escaped from a
prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1319
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:43,585
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1320
02:35:43,752 --> 02:35:45,587
- <i>Oui.</i>
- Can you help me?

1321
02:35:49,758 --> 02:35:52,219
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1322
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:11,613
<i>Geheime Staatspolizei.
Ihren Ausweis, bitte.</i>

1323
02:36:15,317 --> 02:36:17,286
- <i>Français?</i>
- <i>Jawohl.</i>

1324
02:36:17,453 --> 02:36:20,622
- <i>Commerçant?</i>
- <i>Mais oui. Parlez-vous français?</i>

1325
02:36:20,789 --> 02:36:23,459
- <i>Un peu.</i>
- <i>Votre accent est très bon.</i>

1326
02:36:23,625 --> 02:36:27,129
<i>Je l'ai étudié dans l'école supérieure.</i>

1327
02:36:30,632 --> 02:36:32,801
<i>Très bien. Passez.</i>

1328
02:36:32,968 --> 02:36:35,387
<i>Au revoir, monsieur. Au revoir.</i>

1329
02:36:36,764 --> 02:36:38,974
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1330
02:36:43,395 --> 02:36:44,646
<i>Halt!</i>

1331
02:36:52,821 --> 02:36:56,158
<i>Zwei vom Lager sind getürmt. Engländer.</i>

1332
02:37:05,834 --> 02:37:07,127
<i>Los!</i>

1333
02:37:08,170 --> 02:37:09,630
<i>Alles einsteigen.</i>

1334
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:11,423
<i>Einsteigen.</i>

1335
02:37:44,873 --> 02:37:46,875
<i>Halt! Halt!</i>

1336
02:38:26,915 --> 02:38:29,293
<i>Stehen bleiben! Hände hoch!</i>

1337
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:34,381
- <i>Was soll das?</i>
- You are English.

1338
02:38:34,548 --> 02:38:35,716
<i>Engländer?</i>

1339
02:38:35,883 --> 02:38:37,843
<i>Sie drohen mir mit einer Pistole?</i>

1340
02:38:38,010 --> 02:38:40,971
- <i>Nehmen Sie die weg.</i>
- <i>Ach, Sie sind Deutscher?</i>

1341
02:38:41,138 --> 02:38:44,391
- <i>Selbstverständlich.</i>
- <i>Schon gut. Entschuldigung.</i>

1342
02:39:15,756 --> 02:39:17,758
Herr Bartlett?

1343
02:39:23,597 --> 02:39:27,226
- <i>Ich heibe Fröhlich.</i>
- Your German is good.

1344
02:39:27,809 --> 02:39:30,103
And I hear also your French.

1345
02:39:31,980 --> 02:39:34,942
Your arms... up!

1346
02:39:48,789 --> 02:39:50,791
<i>Ausgezeichnet!</i>

1347
02:40:11,186 --> 02:40:13,188
Herr Bartlett...

1348
02:40:13,814 --> 02:40:16,149
and Herr MacDonald.

1349
02:40:19,027 --> 02:40:21,071
We are together again.

1350
02:40:21,655 --> 02:40:25,701
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1351
02:40:41,717 --> 02:40:45,220
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1352
02:40:45,387 --> 02:40:48,890
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1353
02:40:49,057 --> 02:40:51,018
Yes.

1354
02:40:51,184 --> 02:40:53,520
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.

1355
02:40:53,687 --> 02:40:56,231
I hope to God I haven't blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1356
02:40:57,398 --> 02:40:58,567
No, no.

1357
02:40:58,734 --> 02:41:02,404
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

1358
02:41:02,571 --> 02:41:05,407
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1359
02:41:05,615 --> 02:41:09,411
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1360
02:41:09,578 --> 02:41:12,372
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1361
02:41:50,619 --> 02:41:51,912
<i>Was ist los? Wo sind wir?</i>

1362
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:55,791
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1363
02:41:55,957 --> 02:41:59,419
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1364
02:42:20,357 --> 02:42:24,653
You know, Mac, all this,
the organization, tunneling,

1365
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:28,990
Tom and Harry, kept me alive.

1366
02:42:29,157 --> 02:42:31,159
And even though we...

1367
02:42:32,494 --> 02:42:34,788
I've never been happier.

1368
02:42:35,664 --> 02:42:37,358
You know, Mac...

1369
02:43:18,039 --> 02:43:21,168
Eleven of your men are being returned today.

1370
02:43:21,334 --> 02:43:25,005
- Oh, who?
- I do not have that information.

1371
02:43:25,422 --> 02:43:27,549
I...

1372
02:43:28,008 --> 02:43:32,721
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1373
02:43:33,847 --> 02:43:37,225
50 of your officers were shot while escaping.

1374
02:43:38,727 --> 02:43:39,895
Shot?

1375
02:43:41,229 --> 02:43:44,900
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1376
02:43:48,069 --> 02:43:49,571
How many of them were wounded?

1377
02:43:51,740 --> 02:43:55,118
Here are the names... of the dead.

1378
02:43:58,747 --> 02:44:00,457
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1379
02:44:02,375 --> 02:44:07,339
None. They, the higher authority...

1380
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:10,884
only directs me to inform you that...

1381
02:44:13,803 --> 02:44:15,847
that 50 men were...

1382
02:44:21,853 --> 02:44:22,979
I see.

1383
02:44:25,106 --> 02:44:27,150
Addison, John.

1384
02:44:27,317 --> 02:44:29,152
Alladale, Peter.

1385
02:44:29,319 --> 02:44:31,321
Bancroft, Edward.

1386
02:44:31,488 --> 02:44:33,573
Bartlett, Roger.

1387
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:35,700
Cavendish, Dennis.

1388
02:44:35,909 --> 02:44:37,953
Eldridge, David.

1389
02:44:38,703 --> 02:44:40,705
Felton, William.

1390
02:44:41,665 --> 02:44:43,667
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1391
02:45:43,143 --> 02:45:45,478
- <i>Ici?</i>
- <i>Oui, monsieur. C'est ici.</i>

1392
02:45:45,645 --> 02:45:47,314
<i>Alors, au revoir.</i>

1393
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:50,483
- <i>Merci beaucoup, monsieur.</i>
- <i>Pas de quoi. Au revoir.</i>

1394
02:45:50,650 --> 02:45:53,403
- <i>Au revoir.</i>
- <i>Bonne chance.</i>

1395
02:46:07,709 --> 02:46:09,669
I am your guide, <i>señor.</i>

1396
02:46:09,836 --> 02:46:12,005
For Spain?

1397
02:46:12,172 --> 02:46:14,007
<i>España.</i>

1398
02:46:33,485 --> 02:46:36,071
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1399
02:46:36,237 --> 02:46:38,615
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1400
02:46:38,782 --> 02:46:40,617
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1401
02:46:42,077 --> 02:46:43,328
What happened to Blythe?

1402
02:46:44,913 --> 02:46:47,123
He didn't make it, sir.

1403
02:46:47,290 --> 02:46:49,584
Roger was right about that.

1404
02:46:50,377 --> 02:46:52,712
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1405
02:46:55,632 --> 02:46:59,678
I've just posted the list.
They shot... 50.

1406
02:47:00,303 --> 02:47:02,305
The Gestapo murdered them.

1407
02:47:03,556 --> 02:47:07,102
Fifty? MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1408
02:47:07,602 --> 02:47:10,146
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

1409
02:47:10,313 --> 02:47:12,148
No, they're not on the list.

1410
02:47:12,816 --> 02:47:18,113
- Haynes?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

1411
02:47:20,156 --> 02:47:23,493
Roger's idea was to get back at the enemy
the hardest way he could.

1412
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:26,079
Mess up the works.

1413
02:47:26,246 --> 02:47:29,374
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1414
02:47:29,833 --> 02:47:32,001
Do you think it was worth the price?

1415
02:47:33,086 --> 02:47:35,672
That depends on your point of view, Hendley.

1416
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:40,176
Yes, sir.

1417
02:47:53,648 --> 02:47:55,692
<i>Achtung!</i>

1418
02:48:28,516 --> 02:48:29,976
<i>Achtung!</i>

1419
02:48:30,143 --> 02:48:34,189
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1420
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:44,240
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1421
02:48:44,407 --> 02:48:47,869
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1422
02:48:50,163 --> 02:48:51,164
How many?

1423
02:48:51,873 --> 02:48:52,874
Fifty.

1424
02:48:55,210 --> 02:49:00,507
It looks, after all,
as if you will see Berlin before I do.

1425
02:49:52,934 --> 02:49:54,978
Sir.

1426
02:50:01,734 --> 02:50:03,111
Hey, Hilts!

1427
02:52:11,698 --> 02:52:12,532
English - US
