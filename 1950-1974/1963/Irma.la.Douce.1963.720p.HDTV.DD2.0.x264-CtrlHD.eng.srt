1
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,874
Tell me, how'd a nice girl like you
get into a racket like this?

2
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,630
I was studying at the Paris Conservatory.
I was going to be a concert pianist.

3
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,672
Chopin and Debussy, and like that.

4
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,191
And then the night of my first recital,
the piano cover fell on my hand.

5
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,517
Three broken fingers and a broken dream.

6
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,830
After that I didn't care what happened...

7
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,555
...as long as I could feed
myself and my little dog.

8
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,879
Thank you.

9
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,434
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

10
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,838
You mean, why does a girl like me
have to do this for a living?

11
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,034
Well, actually, I'm Belgian. My parents
were missionaries in the Congo.

12
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,830
I don't wanna talk about that.

13
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,192
- I understand.
- So now there's just me and my sister.

14
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,154
She's in the hospital.
Needs three transfusions a day.

15
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,829
D'you know how much
a pint of blood costs these days?

16
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,036
Thank you.

17
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,193
Sorry, pooch. What's his name?

18
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,311
Her name. Coquette.

19
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,797
- And what's yours?
- Irma. They call me Irma la Douce.

20
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,196
That means Irma the Sweet.
I don't know why.

21
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,753
I know why. How much is that, in dollars?

22
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,475
Five dollars. Actually,
I don't even know my real name.

23
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,513
I was brought up in an orphanage near
Cherbourg - it was destroyed on D-day.

24
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,589
I've been sending money to help rebuild
it. I've already paid for a whole wing.

25
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Uh...

26
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,674
That's all I have on me, ma'am.

27
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,078
Actually, it was bombed by the Eighth Air
Force. Not that I blame you Americans.

28
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,637
But if you could see those poor orphans,
sleeping on the floor, the rain coming in.

29
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,115
There are no beds yet and no roof.

30
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Uh...

31
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,113
Do y'all take traveller's cheques?

32
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,028
<i> This, then,</i>
<i>is the story of Irma la Douce.</i>

33
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,631
<i>A story of passion,</i>
<i>bloodshed, desire and death.</i>

34
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,469
<i>Everything, in fact,</i>
<i>that makes life worth living.</i>

35
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,433
<i>The place is Paris, the time</i>
<i>is five o'clock in the morning.</i>

36
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,239
<i>You may have read in travel folders</i>
<i>that Paris is a city that never sleeps.</i>

37
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,715
<i>Don't you believe it.</i>

38
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,873
<i>At this time of the day</i>
<i>there is nothing doing...</i>

39
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,959
<i>... unless you're working for</i>
<i>the department of sanitation.</i>

40
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,309
<i>If you want a nightcap</i>
<i>at Maxim's, it's too late.</i>

41
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,795
<i>It's been closed for hours.</i>

42
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,149
<i>If you want to jump off</i>
<i>the Eiffel Tower, it's too early.</i>

43
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,635
<i>It won't be open for hours.</i>

44
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,796
<i>So, if you're looking for a little action,</i>
<i>forget the high-rent district.</i>

45
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,151
<i>You'd better come to our neighborhood.</i>

46
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,314
<i>This is Les Halles,</i>
<i>the wholesale food market.</i>

47
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,273
<i>We call it the stomach of Paris.</i>

48
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,193
<i>Keep your Champs Élysées</i>
<i>and your palace in Versailles.</i>

49
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,395
<i>This is the place for me..</i>
<i>Brawling, vulgar, smelly, but alive.</i>

50
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,869
<i>Beef from Charollais,</i>
<i>pork from Périgord...</i>

51
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,037
<i>... lamb from Brittany, veal from Normandy.</i>

52
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,957
<i>Brains and kidneys and tripe.</i>

53
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,198
<i>Pigs' feet and calves' heads</i>
<i>waiting for sauce vinaigrette.</i>

54
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,159
<i>Salmon from the Loire,</i>
<i>sole from the Channel...</i>

55
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,350
<i>... lobsters from Corsica...</i>

56
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,109
<i>... oysters from Dieppe,</i>
<i>sardines from Lorient.</i>

57
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,196
<i>Asparagus from Argenteuil,</i>
<i>oranges from Valencia...</i>

58
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,108
<i>... melons from Cavaillon,</i>
<i>cabbage from Aubervilliers.</i>

59
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,237
<i>But man does not live by cabbage alone.</i>

60
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,835
<i>And if that's what you're in the market for,</i>
<i>just step into the Rue Casanova.</i>

61
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,873
<i>This is where the girls are,</i>
<i>or, as we say, the "poules".</i>

62
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,833
<i>You can have your choice of</i>
<i>Kiki the Cossack, Amazon Annie...</i>

63
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,316
<i>... Lolita, Suzette Wong,</i>
<i>Mimi the Maumau...</i>

64
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,000
<i>... and then, of course,</i>
<i>there's Irma la Douce.</i>

65
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,510
<i>She was born here, in Les Halles,</i>
<i>in a truck behind the fish market.</i>

66
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,236
<i>Like all the others, she takes her coffee</i>
<i>break in the bistro across the street.</i>

67
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,276
<i>This is the owner.</i>
<i>He is known as Moustache.</i>

68
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,437
<i>According to police records,</i>
<i>he is a Romanian chicken thief...</i>

69
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,757
<i>... named Constantinescu,</i>
<i>but when he bought this place...</i>

70
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,395
<i>... it was called "Chez Moustache" and</i>
<i>it was cheaper to grow a moustache...</i>

71
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,080
<i>... than to buy a new sign.</i>

72
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,478
<i>Sometimes, at dawn, rich slummers</i>
<i>drop in for a bowl of onion soup.</i>

73
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,390
<i>But mostly the clientele consists</i>
<i>of the "poules" and their "macs".</i>

74
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,028
<i>You know what a "mac" is?</i>
<i>How do you say it in English?</i>

75
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,755
<i>A protector, a consort,</i>
<i>a business manager?</i>

76
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,917
<i>Well, stick around, you'll get the idea.</i>

77
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,590
- How are we doin'?
- Not bad.

78
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,835
Mostly tips. I had
some real pigeons tonight.

79
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,758
- Sometimes I wish you were twins.
- Thanks.

80
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,398
- What's that?
- What's what? Oh, that.

81
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,592
The last one didn't have any more money,
so he gave me a cheque.

82
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,950
Now is that nice, Irma,
holding out on me?

83
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,277
- It's only ten dollars.
- And you weren't gonna tell me about it?

84
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,358
I was gonna put it down
as a deposit, on a hair dryer.

85
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,439
A hair dryer?! We're partners, Irma.
You wouldn't wanna cheat me?

86
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,757
- Let go, Hippolyte.
- There's such a thing as ethics.

87
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,552
You're hurting me, you big ox!

88
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,309
If you don't like the way I treat you,
why don't you get yourself another guy?

89
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,989
- I will one of these days.
- Why wait? Why not leave me now?

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,230
I'd take her any time.

91
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,999
Oh, you would?

92
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,351
- It was just a joke, Hippolyte.
- A joke?

93
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,835
So how come nobody's laughing?

94
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,916
Now go back to work.

95
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Ox.

96
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,952
<i>And so it was one big,</i>
<i>happy family around here..</i>

97
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,117
<i>The "macs", the "poules" and the "flics"...</i>

98
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,595
<i>... or as you would say, the cops.</i>

99
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,154
<i>Your statesmen and politicians keep</i>
<i>talking about peaceful coexistence...</i>

100
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,795
<i>... but here, in our milieu,</i>
<i>we really practise it.</i>

101
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,674
<i>The attitude of the police</i>
<i>is live and let live.</i>

102
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,076
<i>And some of them make</i>
<i>a pretty good living at it.</i>

103
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,869
<i>Every other Friday the "flics" would raid</i>
<i>Rue Casanova, just for the record.</i>

104
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,549
<i>A few "poules" would be hauled to</i>
<i>the station, they'd pay a small fine...</i>

105
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,389
<i>... and 24 hours later</i>
<i>they'd be back on the street.</i>

106
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,273
<i>It was a nice, friendly,</i>
<i>civilised arrangement.</i>

107
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,676
<i>Everybody looked the other way,</i>
<i>everybody kept his mouth shut...</i>

108
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,634
<i>... nobody got hurt,</i>
<i>except maybe an occasional fly.</i>

109
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,349
<i>And then, one day, disaster.</i>

110
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,438
<i>An honest policeman came on the beat.</i>

111
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,232
Coquette. Come here, Coquette.
You naughty girl.

112
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,396
Pardon me, do you have a licence?

113
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,308
- A licence? No.
- It's a violation of ordinance number 56.

114
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,635
Oh, usually they let us get away with it.

115
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,548
Not me. And according to the law,
you're supposed to keep it on a leash.

116
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,636
On a leash?

117
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,593
Oh! Oh, of course.

118
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,473
- I'll remember that.
- Now, just a moment.

119
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,233
What are all you girls doing around here
at this hour of the morning?

120
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,476
I don't know about them,
I'm walking my dog.

121
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,353
- Oh, I see.
- I have to take her out all the time.

122
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,233
- She has kidney stones.
- That's a shame.

123
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,676
Look, it... if you
don't mind my saying so...

124
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,396
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,879
I've never seen a girl
in green stockings before.

126
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,514
It matches the ribbon and my underwear.

127
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,995
Green underwear?

128
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,036
- You're new around here, aren't you?
- It's my first day.

129
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,799
- I thought so.
- I've been on the force for six months.

130
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,469
I was stationed at the Bois de Boulogne,
by the lake, where the children play?

131
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,672
- That's where I got this medal.
- For keeping kids off the grass?

132
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,712
I saved a boy from drowning,
mouth-to-mouth respiration.

133
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,310
So they thought I was ready for
bigger things and transferred me here.

134
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,069
- Well, you're going to like it here.
- I'm not so sure.

135
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,314
If I were you, I'd exercise
that dog somewhere else.

136
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,000
- Why?
- Those girls over there.

137
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,393
Something tells me they're streetwalkers.

138
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,752
- No?
- Yes. I can spot 'em six blocks away.

139
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,117
Say, Irma, I just got off work,
so if you're not busy...

140
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,028
- I beg your pardon?
- It's me, André, wholesale artichokes.

141
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,310
- I don't need any.
- What the matter with you?

142
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,476
You want me to take my business to Kiki?

143
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,559
- Is this man annoying you?
- It's all right. Not now. Come back later.

144
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,319
Later? I've only got a half-hour.

145
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,913
Look, Officer, there's
a truck double-parked there.

146
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,918
- Now, why don't you do your duty?
- Maybe I will.

147
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,838
- He takes his work very seriously.
- I try.

148
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,749
- See you again sometime.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

149
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,953
- What'll it be, Officer? Cognac?
- No, no. I never drink when I'm on duty.

150
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,473
In fact, I never drink when I'm off duty.
Maybe just a little glass of Vichy water.

151
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,197
Looking for something, Officer?

152
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,439
- What do you know about that hotel?
- Casanova slept there in 1763.

153
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,109
I'm not talking about 1763. Since
I've been here, four couples walked in.

154
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,629
Monday is always a slow night.

155
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,833
Just between us, would you have even
a vague idea what they're doing in there?

156
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,157
I have a very definite idea.
They're making love.

157
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,113
- That's illegal.
- Shows you the kind of world we live in.

158
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,470
Love is illegal, but not hate.

159
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,034
That you can do anywhere,
anytime, to anybody.

160
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,631
But if you want a little warmth, a shoulder
to cry on, a smile to cuddle up with...

161
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,991
...you have to hide in dark corners
like a criminal. Pfui!

162
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,592
- I wouldn't call that love.
- Spoken like a petit bourgeois.

163
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,474
It's flagrant vice
and must be stamped out.

164
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,798
My dear boy, your thinking is not
only fuzzy, it's economically unsound.

165
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,990
And I know what I'm talking about.

166
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,759
I used to be professor
of economics at the Sorbonne.

167
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,519
- A professor?
- For six years, but that's another story.

168
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,474
Then you should agree decent citizens
have a right to be protected from this.

169
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,991
Let's take one, married for 20 years,
works hard all day selling baby carriages.

170
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,680
In the evening he wants
a little fun, companionship.

171
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,032
So he comes to Rue Casanova. He meets
a girl, she gives him companionship...

172
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,958
...he gives her money.
She gives it to her boyfriend...

173
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,993
...the boyfriend spends it on drinks,
on cuff links, at the racetrack.

174
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,272
Sometimes he even pays
a little money to a policeman.

175
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,789
- Bribe a policeman?
- That's the beauty of it.

176
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,310
The policeman takes it and buys
a baby carriage from the decent citizen.

177
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,556
Thusly, money is kept in circulation.

178
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,035
Everybody's prosperous,
everybody's happy.

179
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,230
- I don't believe it.
- It's elementary.

180
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,079
I don't believe there are
policemen who take money.

181
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,316
Oh, not all policemen take money.

182
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,558
Some of the higher-ups have a more
intimate arrangement with the girls.

183
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,673
Well, there's one policeman
around here who isn't corrupt.

184
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,631
You wouldn't know the number
of the police station, would you?

185
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,117
Central 5288. But I wouldn't be
so impetuous if I were you.

186
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,196
Have your Vichy.

187
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,155
Desk sergeant? It's Officer Patou. I want
a police van sent to the Hotel Casanova.

188
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,352
Violation of section 34
of the criminal code.

189
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,519
Not littering the sidewalks, that's section
43. This is lewd and immoral conduct.

190
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,474
There goes another couple.
I'm gonna raid the place.

191
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,191
You're asking for trouble, my friend.

192
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,233
To be too honest in a dishonest world is
like plucking a chicken against the wind.

193
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,591
You'll only wind up
with a mouthful of feathers.

194
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,280
Don't worry, old man.
I know what I'm doing.

195
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,520
- Do you have a fire alarm here?
- Oh, a fire?

196
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,870
Oh, yes. It's right over there.

197
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,231
Yes, Officer.
Oh, it's in perfect working order.

198
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,835
Wh... wh... where is the fire?

199
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,036
Right here.

200
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,716
Oh, no, that's hot! It's hot!

201
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,754
Oh, no, you don't. You're under arrest.

202
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,912
All right! All right, everybody.
Everybody, the party's over!

203
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,112
- Girls on this side, men over here.
- Hey, what is this?

204
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,639
- A raid.
- On a Monday?

205
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,150
- It's supposed to be every other Friday.
- Can I go and get my stockings?

206
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,475
- No. Come on.
- You oughta pay me half.

207
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,433
- It wasn't <i>my</i> fault.
- I don't know what she's talkin' about.

208
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,916
- I was up there unpacking my samples.
- Come on.

209
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Over.

210
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,806
You oughta be ashamed of yourself,
scaring a poor dog like that.

211
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,401
They ought to take that dog away
from you - you're not a fit mother.

212
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,680
Quiet, quiet!

213
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,768
I'll let you men go. We'll need you
as witnesses. Your name?

214
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,245
Jacques Casanova.

215
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,409
- What's yours?
- André Casanova.

216
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,603
- I suppose you're Pierre Casanova?
- No, I am General Lafayette.

217
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,799
Retired.

218
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,967
- All right, let's start all over again.
- And what's your name?

219
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm Officer... Just a moment,
who's investigating, you or me?

220
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,680
It's an outrage. I'll see you lose your job.

221
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,244
- Shut up.
- Do you know who you're talking to?

222
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,760
Trying to bribe an officer, eh?

223
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,240
Back. Everybody, back. All right,
OK, ladies, let's go. Come on. Back.

224
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,364
- In we go.
- Not so rough.

225
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,446
- Up, up, up.
- Watch that baton.

226
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,084
- Don't handle the merchandise.
- In you get.

227
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,280
- Take it easy, you.
- Come on.

228
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,970
Let's go, let's go. Come on. Here we go.

229
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,684
Let's go now. Here we go. Just a minute.

230
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,325
- No smoking in a police van.
- Who do you think you are? De Gaulle?

231
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,522
- Inside. Come on, come on.
- What do they expect us to do now?

232
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,120
- Collect unemployment insurance?
- It's that new <i>flic.</i>

233
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,528
One of these days I'm gonna
catch him outta uniform, and then...

234
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,200
Up, up, up. Let's go.

235
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,685
Who does this belong to?

236
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,250
Officer, would you zip my dress up?

237
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,285
Will you hold this, please?

238
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,970
Hey!

239
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,921
Say, Officer, do you really
have to take us to the station?

240
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,042
The last time we were arrested,
we drove right on to Deauville.

241
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,604
What a weekend!
18 girls and three policemen.

242
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,642
And they weren't nearly
as cute as you are.

243
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,328
- Wouldn't ya like a harem?
- We'll make you feel like a king.

244
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,406
King Farouk.

245
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,684
Oh, look, he's blushing.

246
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,567
- I guess he's too young.
- Maybe if we put a moustache on him...

247
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,999
...he'd look older.

248
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,886
All right, all right!

249
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,049
One false move out of any one of ya,
and I'm gonna let you have it.

250
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,525
That's enough, girls! Leave him alone.

251
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,800
- He can take care of himself.
- No, he can't.

252
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,923
You know what he was doing before this?
Policing a children's playground.

253
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,610
Now, now, kids, stay out of the bushes.

254
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,689
- Don't take candy from strangers.
- And no playing doctor.

255
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,126
<i>~ Little birdie, pretty little birdie ~</i>

256
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,606
<i>~ Little birdie, fly away with me ~</i>

257
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,245
<i>~ We will build a little nest</i>
<i>We will build a little nest ~</i>

258
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,962
<i>~ Get the best</i>
<i>Get the best ~</i>

259
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,046
<i>~ In my nest</i>
<i>In my nest ~</i>

260
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,645
- Here, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

261
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,603
- You're the only nice one.
- They were just pulling your leg.

262
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,483
And it almost came off.
Sorry I have to put you in jail.

263
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,408
Oh, I don't mind. I can use a little rest.

264
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,409
Oh. Officer Nestor Patou checking in
16 females suspected of lewd vagrancy.

265
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,279
- And one poodle.
- How many? 16?

266
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,208
Yes, Monday is a slow night,
but I'll do better next time.

267
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,480
- You will, huh?
- Definitely.

268
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,130
Hello?

269
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,079
About the little one - don't worry,
we'll feed her around here.

270
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,008
Thank you, but none of that
horse meat you give police dogs.

271
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,884
- She's got kidney stones, remember?
- Hey, Patou!

272
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,480
- The inspector wants to see you.
- The inspector? Did you hear that?

273
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,761
- The inspector wants to see <i>me.</i>
- Maybe they've given you a medal.

274
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,120
Do you think so? No, not on my first day.

275
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,206
- In there.
- All right.

276
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,290
Come in!

277
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,089
Officer Patou reporting.
You sent for me... sir.

278
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,201
- So you're the new man?
- Yes, sir.

279
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,321
I've been wondering what you looked like.

280
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,645
- Well, you've seen me before.
- I have?

281
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,761
Remember? At the Hotel Casanova.

282
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,006
What was I doing at the Hotel Casanova?

283
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,089
- I don't know, but I was raiding the place.
- You were. Who authorised the raid?!

284
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,000
I was using my own judgement, sir. It
was an obvious violation of section 34.

285
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,644
We can get a conviction,
now we have you as a witness.

286
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,330
And look at your uniform! It's disgraceful!

287
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,886
There were 16 of them in the van,
and they were resisting arrest, sir.

288
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,046
And I was resisting, too.

289
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,843
I didn't lose my head,
just my gun, but I got it back.

290
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,928
- Take off your cap when talking to me!
- Yes, sir.

291
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,925
Hey, <i>chéri,</i> you oughta
get outta those wet clothes.

292
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,646
I'll help you.

293
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,121
Look who's here.

294
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,128
<i>~ Little birdie, pretty little birdie ~</i>

295
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,208
<i>~ Little birdie, fly away with me ~</i>

296
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,042
A glass of Vichy, right?

297
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,766
Cognac, please, to get the taste
of feathers out of my mouth.

298
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,405
<i>~ Little birdie, pretty little birdie ~</i>

299
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,079
<i>~ Little birdie, fly away with me ~</i>

300
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,043
- You off duty?
- Permanently.

301
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,485
- I've been bounced from the police force.
- You don't say?

302
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,081
Had the goods on me. Insubordination,
accepting bribes and a missing button.

303
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,486
So they took away my medal,
threw me out of the barracks.

304
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,283
Reminds me of when I was drummed out
of the army. Marrakech, you know.

305
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,049
I was a colonel in the foreign legion.

306
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,730
Before or after you were
a professor of economics?

307
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,365
No, in between I was a croupier
in Monte Carlo, but that's another story.

308
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,879
Oh. Well... one more.

309
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,920
So, what's your next move?

310
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,962
I've been lookin' for a job,
applied to all the bureaus -

311
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,402
customs inspection, sanitation - but once
you've been dishonourably discharged...

312
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,328
...they won't even let you
clean the sewers.

313
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,726
I hate to see a young man like you
take a defeatist attitude.

314
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,809
The world is full of opportunities.
Just look around.

315
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,843
There's one-armed Jojo,
used to be a safecracker...

316
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,201
...till he put a little too much
nitroglycerin in a vault.

317
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,450
And Casablanca Charlie. Five years ago
he walked in with holes in his shoes...

318
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,845
...and a pocketful of dirty postcards.

319
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,567
Or take Hippolyte the Ox, used to be
a purse-snatcher around the market.

320
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:40,164
They all started at the bottom, but they
had perseverance and drive and vision.

321
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,523
Now they've got it made. They're retired.
They let their girls work for them.

322
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,284
I'm afraid I wasn't
cut out for a life of crime.

323
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,970
There you go, selling yourself short.

324
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,969
Oh, maybe I could snatch a purse
or crack a small safe...

325
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,686
...but to sit around in a striped suit
while some girl out in the street... never.

326
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,040
You're being petit bourgeois again.

327
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,769
Life is total war, my friend. Nobody has
a right to be a conscientious objector.

328
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,005
- Cigarettes.
- A pack of Gitanes coming up.

329
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,724
- Hello.
- Hello.

330
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,410
- Nasty night, isn't it?
- It never fails.

331
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,522
Wouldn't you know, just
this afternoon I gave her a permanent.

332
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,606
- Put them on my bill.
- Uh...

333
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,118
Can I buy you a cheap drink?

334
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,038
Why not? Do you think
you can afford a peppermint tea?

335
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,401
- Certainly.
- One peppermint tea coming up.

336
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,289
- Here we are again.
- Again? Have we been together before?

337
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,321
I guess you don't
recognise me out of uniform.

338
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,763
Uniform? Oh, about a month ago.

339
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,200
You're that sailor with Brigitte Bardot
tattooed on your chest?

340
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,527
No, it was just this morning...
I arrested you.

341
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,166
Oh. Oh, of course.

342
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,565
I'm sorry, I never remember a face.

343
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,603
Oh... How long did they keep you
in the police station?

344
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,245
- About an hour.
- I was out much faster than that.

345
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,883
- Sugar?
- Thanks.

346
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,399
Say, that hotel, tell me,
what are the rates?

347
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,839
- Why?
- I'm lookin' for a room.

348
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,359
They charge by the hour.
Nobody can afford it.

349
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,243
Besides, they don't take
anybody with luggage.

350
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,730
Irma!

351
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,566
Let's have it.

352
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,848
- Is that all?
- It's the weather. Nothin's happening.

353
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,200
Well, get out and make it happen.

354
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,006
- Do you mind if I dry out first?
- On your way. I haven't won all evening.

355
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,360
When I walked the beat on a night
like this, I wore two pairs of socks.

356
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,446
- You oughta try it.
- And long underwear?

357
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,963
By all means. Also, I'd put a newspaper
inside my coat to keep my chest warm.

358
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,241
Look, mister, I'm in a very
competitive business.

359
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,727
Well, at least you get indoors
once in a while and off your feet.

360
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,239
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

361
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,128
You oughta cut down on it.
I mean, one after another.

362
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,402
- Mind your own business.
- If you wanna smoke yourself to death...

363
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,799
I met fellas that asked me to do a lot of
crazy things, but not give up smokin'.

364
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,127
Well, I don't mean to get personal,
it's just that I like you.

365
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,718
In Dijon there was this girl
I was in love with...

366
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,126
- And I remind you of her.
- You don't look anything like her at all.

367
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,563
But she was a heavy smoker, 60
cigarettes a day, coughin' all the time.

368
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,965
What are you hangin' around for?
I said out.

369
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,719
- Please, you're interrupting.
- All right, we were just talking.

370
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,887
- About smoking.
- Talk on your own time.

371
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,685
I would strongly advise you
to let go of the lady.

372
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,166
- Oh, it's you.
- I'll give you exactly five seconds. One...

373
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,920
...two, three, four... five!

374
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,446
Well, that's better.

375
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,930
Outside.

376
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,685
And don't come back with
any excuses. I need 100 francs.

377
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,763
Hey, watch it. This is a new hat.

378
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,846
Had enough?

379
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,166
Now I'm mad.

380
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,640
Now I am really mad.

381
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,045
And when I get mad, I'm like a tiger!

382
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,730
Do you hear that, boys? He's a tiger.

383
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,730
Hey, girls! A fight!

384
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,287
All right... who's next?

385
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,730
Cognac.

386
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,926
Would you care
for another peppermint tea?

387
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,006
No, thank you.

388
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,405
Put everything on my bill.

389
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,208
- Shall we go?
- Might as well.

390
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,965
I'm getting bored with this place.

391
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,723
- Where are we goin'?
- To my apartment.

392
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,241
- I thought you lived in the hotel.
- That's my business address.

393
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,205
Come on, you're getting wet.

394
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,200
Don't expect too much
when we get up there.

395
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,207
No, not at all.

396
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,208
- I have no rugs, no icebox.
- As long as you have an empty couch.

397
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,130
No couch.

398
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,240
I also have to get curtains.

399
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,602
They're working across the street,
repairing the roof, and I sleep in the nude.

400
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,246
Well, it's about time they started fixing
up... You mean you don't wear anything?

401
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,406
Nothing but a sleeping mask.

402
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,530
Oh.

403
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,686
That's all right, because the workmen
wouldn't recognise you anyway.

404
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,767
You know what I've got?
An electric blanket.

405
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,405
It was a present from somebody
with the American Embassy.

406
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,960
That must be nice,
an electric blanket on a night like this.

407
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:08,164
Only it doesn't work. They've got
a different kind of electricity. AC or DC.

408
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,839
- That's too bad.
- Don't worry, you won't be cold.

409
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,097
I'm not worried.

410
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,527
It's very attractive. It has atmosphere.

411
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,687
Used to be a studio.
A painter once lived here.

412
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,564
Poor guy, he was starving.
Tried everything, even cut his ear off.

413
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,966
- Van Gogh?
- No, I think his name was Schwartz.

414
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,404
Would you believe it, I'm an artist myself.

415
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,328
- I believe it.
- See this bed?

416
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,050
Yes?

417
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,561
I painted it.

418
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,090
Oh. Oh!

419
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,048
Very good job.

420
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,799
It looked just awful when
I found it at the flea market.

421
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,280
- Can I borrow a newspaper?
- You wanna read?

422
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,721
No, of course not.
Can I take your stockings off?

423
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,046
Sure, go ahead.

424
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,878
You really are shy, aren't you?

425
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,610
Me? Shy?

426
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,801
Not particularly. It's... it's just...
the kind of world we live in.

427
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,720
What I mean is, if you hate somebody,
you can do that any time, any place, but...

428
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,968
...if you like somebody,
you gotta hide in dark corners.

429
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,443
You know, I'm sort of glad about
that girl in Dijon, with the cough.

430
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,642
- You are?
- Because frankly, in the police van...

431
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,728
...I thought that you'd
never in your life, uh...

432
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,843
Oh, she wasn't the only girl.
I've had more than one girl.

433
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,929
- How many?
- Altogether?

434
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,081
- Oh, let me see.
- Three?

435
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,929
Not as many as that. That is...

436
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,326
What's your name?

437
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,319
Nes... Nestor. Nestor Patou.

438
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,124
Well, don't take all night, Nestor Patou.

439
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,650
I won't.

440
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,839
Didn't you say you had a sleeping mask?

441
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,525
You're really something.

442
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,280
What's going on? What are you doing?

443
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:58,970
Irma!

444
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,530
Irma!

445
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:08,650
Irma!

446
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,450
Irma!

447
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,250
Irma!

448
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,730
Irma...

449
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,446
Where are you, Irma?!

450
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,130
Where are you, Irma? Hm?

451
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:40,930
Hm?

452
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,084
What are you doing way over there?

453
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,398
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

454
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,885
- Come back.
- What's gotten into you?

455
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,683
I don't know, I guess
I've become an addict.

456
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,810
Irma!

457
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,083
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you!

458
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,686
You go to hell!

459
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,846
I'm coming up to get my clothes.

460
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,126
Just a minute.

461
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:28,689
- Who is it? That big ox again?
- Uh-huh.

462
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,280
If you have something
personal to discuss...

463
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,719
No, stay right where you are.

464
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,610
Catch.

465
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:57,488
But what about my suits
and my silk shirts and my jewellery?

466
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,881
This is what you came with
and this is what you're leaving with.

467
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,329
Why, you little...

468
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,089
You're lucky I don't
take back that gold tooth!

469
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,558
I'm gonna come up there
and break your arm!

470
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,406
Oh, you are

471
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,730
Tiger.

472
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,966
Come on out, Tiger.

473
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,442
You want my friend here
to beat you up again?

474
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,885
You'll be hearing from me.

475
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,325
And stay away!

476
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,167
- You could beat him up again, right?
- Naturally.

477
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,647
It's just that I don't like to
pick on anybody who isn't my size.

478
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,087
How did you get mixed up with
a character like that, anyway?

479
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,202
Should've seen the one I had before.
He was not only mean...

480
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,879
...he used to run around with
other women, and on my money.

481
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,689
Why do you have to have anybody at all?

482
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,766
Everybody needs somebody.

483
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,724
Like Coquette needs me.
Who wants to be a stray dog?

484
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:41,002
You've got to belong to someone,
even if he kicks you once in a while.

485
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,124
- Don't you have any family?
- No.

486
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,647
My mother was a very successful woman.

487
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,682
She used to have the same spot
outside the hotel that I do.

488
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,564
Then one day she met a guy,
fell in love with him and quit.

489
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,081
- That's very romantic.
- Romantic? It's stupid.

490
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,247
Gave up her career - for what?
Some slob from the market...

491
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,248
...dragged around heavy sides
of beef till he dropped dead.

492
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,600
It was too late for Momma
to make a comeback.

493
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,802
She wound up as a cashier
in the fish market.

494
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,326
Only smart thing she ever did
was not marry my father.

495
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,647
You mean you're not le... legitimate?

496
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,405
That's right.

497
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:24,081
You'd think with a background like that
I'd have turned out no good.

498
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:29,079
I know you're doing very well, but a girl
like you - there's other kinds of jobs.

499
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,724
This isn't just a job, it's a profession.

500
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,681
Of course.

501
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:38,326
Somebody has to do these things but,
in your case, now that I know you better...

502
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,169
I get that all the time.
The other night I met a man...

503
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,168
...who thought I was too good for this,
and you know what he does?

504
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,124
- He's a mortician. Now I ask you.
- Ask me what?

505
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,242
Why is it nine out of ten try to reform me?

506
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,645
You're not one of those, are you?

507
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,726
Who, me? Oh, no.

508
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,760
I used to be one of those.

509
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,929
Petit bourgeois, but that was yesterday.
I know better now.

510
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,805
I don't think she cares for me.

511
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,961
You two better make friends
if you're gonna live here.

512
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,923
- Live here?
- Why? Don't you like the idea?

513
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,050
Sure.

514
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,449
I like the idea, it's just that I had no idea.

515
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,722
- Is this all you've got?
- Just my old uniform and my toilet kit.

516
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,484
Try one of those suits in the closet.

517
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,410
Go ahead.

518
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,881
Let's see how you look in the brown one
with the pinstripes. He hardly ever wore it.

519
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,399
Said it was too conservative.

520
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,359
I'm afraid the sleeves may be a little...

521
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:07,449
Don't worry about that.
There's a brown derby that goes with it.

522
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,168
- What are the glasses for?
- The races.

523
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,330
Oh. Gee, they look very powerful.

524
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,482
- Oops.
- What's the matter?

525
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,610
Wrong end.

526
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,280
- You want me to turn around?
- No, I mean the glasses.

527
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,523
I'll bet nobody ever
saw you like this before.

528
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,483
- You'd lose.
- Through field glasses?

529
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,650
No bet.

530
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,879
When I first met you, I thought
you were pretty. I was totally wrong.

531
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,080
You're beautiful.

532
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:57,364
- You're outta your mind or out of focus.
- Without make-up, you look about 14.

533
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,687
I wore make-up when I was 14,
so I could pass for 17.

534
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,768
- Then, by the time I was 17...
- Never mind.

535
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,325
I don't wanna hear about it.

536
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,690
- This coat looks ridiculous.
- Well, have it fixed.

537
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,404
Just take it into Maurice the tailor.

538
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,320
All right, but I won't wear the hat.

539
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,884
But you have to. It all goes together.

540
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:26,559
The suit, the hat, the glasses.
For when you go to the racetrack.

541
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,968
The racetrack? Who's got time for
the racetrack? I gotta get myself a job.

542
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,878
- What do you mean, a job?
- I can find something around the market.

543
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,207
Unloadin' trucks, cleanin' the stalls or...

544
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,685
What's the matter?

545
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,725
Did I say somethin' wrong?

546
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:54,639
- You're trying to make me feel cheap.
- Cheap?

547
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,603
How would it look if I let you go to work?

548
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:01,518
D'you want the other girls to think
I can't support my man?

549
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,767
I want you to be better dressed
than anybody else.

550
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,678
I want you to have more money in
your pockets. I wanna be proud of you.

551
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,405
But, Irma, you don't understand.
I never felt like this about anybody...

552
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:17,524
That's why I'm gonna work twice as hard
for you as I ever did for any of the others.

553
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,256
Your turn.

554
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,056
Hey, Tiger.

555
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,492
I don't feel like playin' any more.
Get somebody else.

556
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,810
- Give me a drink.
- Cognac? Pernod? Calvados?

557
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,579
Yeah, and in that order.

558
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,009
Why don't you shut
that damn jukebox off?

559
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,973
What's the problem?
You've got a gold mine working for you.

560
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,058
- And shut yourself off, too.
- Say, I'm lookin' for Irma.

561
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,138
- The one with the bow-wow?
- She's not here. Go away.

562
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,376
I've been away: Tangiers, Naples, Cairo.

563
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,459
I met up with a lotta dames,
but there's nothing like that Irma.

564
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,014
- Get outta here.
- What is this?

565
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:29,134
I know about you. You're the one with
Brigitte Bardot tattooed on your chest.

566
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,016
Hey, you crazy?

567
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,053
- She must know two sailors.
- A hell of a way to treat a customer.

568
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,216
I'm so jealous I'm goin' outta my mind.

569
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,413
You must be. A <i>mac</i> falling in love
with his <i>poule.</i> You're like an impresario.

570
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,577
You're handling Pavlova and
you want her to dance just for you?

571
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,251
It's a God-given talent. It was
meant to be shared with the public.

572
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,340
Again.

573
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,732
- Hey! There's the bow-wow!
- Come on, sailor, keep rowing.

574
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,017
Whew! What a night! Everybody
seems to have the same idea.

575
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,291
Always happens when there's a full moon.
No time to catch my breath.

576
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,376
- How's my baby?
- I'm fine.

577
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,253
No, he isn't. As a matter of fact,
he's very grouchy.

578
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,417
We can fix that.
I have a little present for you.

579
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,974
- What is it?
- A stick pin. You put it in your tie.

580
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,738
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do.

581
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,772
Mimi got Casablanca Charlie one.
This one has real sapphires.

582
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,731
- Let's go.
- Go where?

583
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,816
- Home.
- It's only one o'clock.

584
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,500
Pack of Gitanes.
You know I never quit before five.

585
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,135
- Take the night off.
- Just walk off the job, just like that?

586
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,775
- Disappoint all my regulars?
- To hell with them!

587
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,175
Why don't we go away
somewhere for a week?

588
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,450
A week? What are we gonna live on?

589
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,048
If I stay away that long, I'll lose my spot.

590
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,536
- She's got the best location.
- We never have any time together.

591
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,493
You're out there all night,
you sleep all day.

592
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,215
If only Monsieur Camembert were
still around. You remember him?

593
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,855
- Do I? Big spender.
- Who is Monsieur Camembert?

594
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,809
That's what we called him. He was
a cheese wholesaler at the market.

595
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,216
He used to see me twice a week,
always gave me 500 francs...

596
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,538
...so I didn't <i>have</i> to see anybody else.
I had lots of time then.

597
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,050
I went to cooking school,
I knitted sweaters, played solitaire.

598
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,216
He was such a nice man.

599
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,456
What happened to him?

600
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,889
His wife died,
so he stopped coming around.

601
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,375
It was a great loss to all of us.

602
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,008
Hey, girls. Here comes
another busload of tourists.

603
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,412
Irma... stay here.

604
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,819
You're sweet. Kiss me.

605
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,895
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe you're right. I'm gonna give it up.

606
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,620
You are?

607
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,291
I promise you, this is absolutely
the last pack I'll ever smoke.

608
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,299
All right, we're going.

609
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,376
See you later.

610
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,658
Must be German tourists.
Short leather pants.

611
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,058
Shut up! Tourists, sailors, wholesalers!
I'd like to kill 'em all.

612
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,093
- Listen to him, Jack the Ripper.
- What am I gonna do?

613
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:31,975
Suppose there was just one man,
a rich customer who gave her 500 francs.

614
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,136
- Would that make you any happier?
- No.

615
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,615
Maybe it would make me
a little less miserable.

616
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,732
How about Monsieur Barnathan,
the goose-liver king?

617
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,613
That nasty old man with the gout?
She wouldn't like it.

618
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,733
Monsieur Leonelli, owns six restaurants,
comes every morning to do the market?

619
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,738
- I don't know him.
- A tall young man, very good-looking.

620
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,816
<i>I wouldn't like it.

621
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,413
What about one of those
Englishmen who drop in here?

622
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,973
You know, Rolls-Royce,
Oxford, Coldstream Guards.

623
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,773
- They're harmless enough.
- You don't understand.

624
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,051
I don't want anybody
to make love to her, except me.

625
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,330
Sentimental slob.

626
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,531
I say there, old chap, <i>I'addition.</i>

627
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,220
That's two onion soups,
a bottle of wine, 15 francs.

628
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,900
Capital onion soup, capital.

629
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:26,649
Pity we don't have rubber pockets,
we could smuggle some back to London.

630
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,336
An Englishman?

631
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,535
Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea.

632
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,890
- It's worth a try. I say, there!
- No, no, no.

633
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,020
No?

634
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,657
Listen, Moustache, would you lend me
500 francs? That's the perfect solution.

635
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,170
You give me the money, I give it to Irma,
Irma gives it back to me...

636
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,939
...and I give it back to you. It's very simple.

637
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,652
- What?
- Don't you see?

638
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,568
Irma's going to have a rich lover
and it's going to be me.

639
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,416
- You're mad.
- Yes, I'm mad!

640
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:06,012
I'm desperate. This is the only way out,
and you're gonna help me.

641
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,016
Let's hear it again.

642
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,530
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

643
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,538
- No, no, through the nose.
- The rain in Spain...

644
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,218
And show me some teeth.

645
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,696
The rain in Spain stays
mainly in the plain.

646
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,890
- By George, you haven't got it.
- I haven't?

647
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,773
Well, to a lord, you wouldn't be
a lord, but maybe to Irma.

648
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,619
Don't worry, I've seen
every English movie in town.

649
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,130
- Hold still, Your Lordship.
- Tell me once more, where is my castle?

650
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,014
- In... in... Worcestershire?
- No, that's the sauce. In Yorkshire.

651
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,574
- I thought that was a pudding.
- I've done all I can.

652
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,260
Well, let's see. Homburg, umbrella.

653
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,929
- Where's my 500 francs?
- You mean, <i>my</i> 500 francs.

654
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:53,053
- Thank you, old chip.
- Not old chip, old chap!

655
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,899
- And not that way. On the lift.
- On the what?

656
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,976
The elevator!

657
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,612
Now then, shall we have a go at it?

658
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,934
This may be the biggest setback
for the British since Dunkirk.

659
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,496
I know, I was there.
Last man to be evacuated.

660
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,975
But that's another story.

661
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,849
Hello, Uncle. Lookin' for a little fun?

662
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,574
- Quite.
- Am I your type?

663
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,533
Not quite. Cheerio, old chip.

664
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,938
- Got the time, mister?
- Indeed, but not the inclination.

665
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,017
- Good show.
- Anything I can do for you?

666
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,132
No, thank you. Just browsing.

667
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,735
I say, there, would you call
that a miniature or a toy?

668
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,613
That's not a toy. That's a real live dog.

669
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,095
- I have a dog myself.
- A poodle?

670
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:47,896
No. The hound of the Baskervilles.
Magnificent beast.

671
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,729
- But then again, so are you.
- You must be British.

672
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,092
Terribly so. Rolls-Royce, you know,
Oxford, Coldcream Guards.

673
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,018
Tell me, are you booked?

674
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:02,496
- No.
- In that case... I mean, would you?

675
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,056
- That is, could we?
- Why not?

676
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:33,419
- What did you say your name was?
- Irma. They call me Irma la Douce.

677
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,818
Well, if you don't mind, Miss la Douce,
I'd rather not introduce myself.

678
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,613
- I don't mind.
- In my situation a man must be discreet.

679
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,131
- You may call me... Lord X.
- Lord X. Sure.

680
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,491
No, no, no, no, no, my dear,
that shan't be necessary.

681
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,770
What's the matter?

682
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,415
All I really want is
a bit of companionship...

683
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,374
...a shoulder to cry on,
a smile to lean against.

684
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,131
Say, what does that
X stand for, eccentric?

685
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:12,053
Let me ask you something, my dear.
Do you find me repulsive?

686
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,855
No, not at all. You're rather nice-looking,
for a lord your age.

687
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,211
Thank you. You see,
my wife, Lady X, she does.

688
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,171
- Does what?
- Finds me repulsive.

689
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,815
Ignores me completely. Spends
all of her time cultivating the garden.

690
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:28,649
And what's worse...
cultivating the gardener.

691
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,537
- The gardener?
- The other day I was watching them...

692
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,616
...from the turret of the castle.

693
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,413
They were in the flower bed together...

694
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:42,455
...and he was pruning her begonias.
- They oughta be ashamed.

695
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,732
Yes, and it was such a jolly marriage,
those first few years.

696
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:53,049
We'd sit in front of the fire and play
double solitaire and Chinese chequers.

697
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,216
Solitaire? I play solitaire.

698
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,137
Capital! Could we?

699
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,616
That is, uh, would you? I mean, shall we?

700
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,129
I don't care, as long as
you're paying for my time.

701
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,730
Don't worry about the money.
You take the red, I'll take the blue, hm?

702
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,172
I once knew a gentleman and all he'd
do is scatter some marbles on the floor...

703
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,530
...and make me
pick them up with my toes.

704
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,260
How odd.

705
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:23,216
- I never played double solitaire before.
- We play off on each other's aces, hm?

706
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,099
The rain in Spain stays
mainly in the plain, you know.

707
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,939
- No, I didn't know.
- Hm, it's a fact.

708
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,532
That's where I met my wife,
in Spain, in the rain, in the plain.

709
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,333
I was stationed in Gibraltar.

710
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,728
- Your wife, Lady X, is she beautiful?
- Very, and very passionate.

711
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,090
So I can't really blame her.

712
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:54,498
You see, I came back
from the war a shattered man.

713
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,249
- I was wondering about your eye.
- Oh, bit of detached retina.

714
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,134
Happened at Navarone. Those beastly
guns popping off all the time.

715
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,935
I have a silver plate in this elbow.
Sink the Bismarck, that was.

716
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:10,975
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I have one eye, one elbow, it's not tragic.

717
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,172
What is tragic, however...

718
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,770
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Well, if you'd rather not.

719
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,256
I was in a Japanese prison camp
on the River Kwai.

720
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,335
There was a rather nasty explosion.

721
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,294
Whole ruddy bridge fell down on me.

722
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:39,049
When they dug me up, I was
only half a man, a hollow shell.

723
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,977
- You've been through a lot, haven't you?
- Well, mad dogs and Englishmen, eh?

724
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:51,538
With Lawrence in Arabia, with
Sherpa Tenzing up the Himalayas.

725
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:55,176
And then there was
the charge of the Light Brigade.

726
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,860
India, you know. Gunga Din, eh?

727
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,448
Bengal Lancers. Ta, ta!

728
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,048
Served under Commander Whitehead.

729
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,377
And then there was the RAF and the BBC.

730
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:10,175
Ah! Dunkirk! Ha-ha!
But that's another story.

731
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,815
- Say, have you seen Irma around?
- No.

732
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,408
She went up at midnight
and hasn't come down yet.

733
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,895
- That's six hours.
- You should have seen the guy.

734
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:40,298
He was an old goat with a beard. I didn't
even think he'd make it up the stairs.

735
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,816
- Ah, by George, I've done it again.
- One more.

736
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,896
Oh, I'm afraid not.

737
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,740
Oh.

738
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:58,013
I'd better dash to the airport
if I'm not to miss my plane.

739
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,769
- It was rather fun, for a change.
- Oh, thank you.

740
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,856
There you are, my dear.

741
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,420
Oh!

742
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:10,499
- You're very generous.
- Oh, not really. Just filthy rich.

743
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Um...

744
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,051
How often do you come to Paris?

745
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,774
Twice a week. Why?

746
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,970
Well, maybe we could do it again.

747
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,456
Smashing. I was about to suggest
we make some kind of arrangement.

748
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,571
I'd like that, and so would Nestor.

749
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,214
- Yeah... uh, who?
- The man I live with.

750
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,340
Oh.

751
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:35,695
He doesn't mind that you come up here
with strangers and pick up their marbles?

752
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,015
No. Why should he? Business is business.

753
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,815
- Sensible attitude.
- Only thing he objects to is my smoking.

754
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,693
I'm trying to quit, but it isn't easy.

755
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,295
Then you must really love him?

756
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,736
- Shall we go?
- Just a second. Where's my other shoe?

757
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,657
- Hm?
- My other shoe?

758
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,293
Oh, hm. Er...

759
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:02,696
I'm sorry, I really must catch my plane...

760
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,971
...or Lady X and that wretched
gardener will be running amok.

761
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,092
- See you Thursday, same place?
- I'll be waiting.

762
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,856
Cheeribye.

763
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:17,980
Whee!

764
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,016
This is our lucky night.
Wait till I tell Nestor.

765
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,490
All right, what did you do with my shoe?

766
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,179
Would you give this
to the young lady in room nine?

767
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,771
Somehow it wound up in my pocket.

768
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,458
Old goat.

769
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,698
- How did it go?
- You would have been proud of me.

770
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,936
What a performance!
Like Sir Laurence Oliver.

771
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,177
That's Laurence <i>Olivier.</i>
And watch your ascot.

772
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,900
My what?

773
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,260
Nestor!

774
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,216
Nestor! Nestor!

775
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,695
It happened! We hit the jackpot!

776
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,890
- Whee!
- What happened? What jackpot?

777
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,695
I found him, and he's got a castle
and he comes here twice a week.

778
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,573
- Who? Calm down.
- He's English and he's a lord.

779
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,373
I'm gonna see him again
on Thursday and he's filthy rich.

780
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,650
- Know how much he gave me?
- How would I know?

781
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,896
Come on, make a guess.

782
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,976
500 francs!

783
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,133
- Here.
- How about that?

784
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,211
500 francs? What'd ya have to do for it?

785
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,092
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on.

786
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,370
- He taught me a new game.
- What kind of game?

787
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,695
- He beat me nine times...
- That's more like it.

788
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:39,258
He used to play with his wife, but she's
got something goin' with the gardener.

789
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,336
It's 500 francs, all right.

790
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,660
Later.

791
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,329
Hey, Tiger, can we see ya for a minute?

792
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,735
Certainly. What's on your mind, boys?

793
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,896
Congratulations, you made it.

794
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,613
- I didn't do anything.
- Me and the boys have talked it over.

795
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,971
Since you're numero uno now,
we've elected you president.

796
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,456
- President? Of what?
- Local 27 of the MPPA.

797
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,573
- MPP?
<i>- Macs</i> of Paris Protective Association.

798
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,656
- Me?
- It was unanimous.

799
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:12,777
It's an honour. I'm sure you can
find somebody more deserving...

800
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,858
We accept! Oh, I'm so proud of you.

801
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,010
Champagne for everybody!

802
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,296
Hey! Free champagne!

803
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,612
<i>Vive</i> Nestor!

804
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:51,698
<i> Vive! Vive! Vive!</i>

805
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,659
Oh, I'm so happy. From now on
it's just going to be the three of us -

806
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,852
- you and me and the lord.
- Yeah.

807
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,978
Let's see. 500 francs each time, that's
1,000 francs a week, 52 weeks a year...

808
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,409
...so that would be...

809
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,499
- Darling, can I have 100 francs?
- Oh, sure.

810
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,613
- It's for a hair dryer.
- Here's another 100. Get curtains too.

811
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,891
- Why are you so good to me?
- I just believe in fair dealings...

812
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,409
...between labour and management.

813
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,135
Come on, Nestor. <i>Le twist.</i>

814
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,730
Hands off, Lolita. He doesn't
twist with anybody but me.

815
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,169
Get her. Mrs President.

816
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,976
Uh... let's dance.

817
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,578
- Want to pay for the champagne now?
- I didn't order it.

818
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,818
The president always pays when
he's inaugurated. 270 francs, please.

819
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:29,171
Nine bottles.
Eight for the gang, one for her.

820
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:33,179
- She had a whole bottle?
- How d'you think she got kidney stones?

821
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,853
Well, that went fast.

822
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,376
Now, what about <i>my</i> 500?

823
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,450
This isn't workin' out the way we figured.

824
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,890
The way you figured. I told you
it was economically unsound.

825
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,252
You'll just have to advance Lord X another
500, when he comes back on Thursday.

826
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:53,656
- Oh, no, not me.
- Well, how am I gonna pay Irma?

827
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:58,137
I guess you'll just have to mortgage your
castle, pick some pockets or rob a bank.

828
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,650
I knocked over a bank in Bordeaux -
my father's - but that's another...

829
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,380
Shut up.

830
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:08,215
Bit of a sticky wicket,
isn't it, Your Lordship?

831
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,740
<i>Dis donc!</i>

832
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,620
Irma?

833
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,300
Irma?

834
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,180
Come on.

835
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,256
Good morning, darling.

836
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,610
- Good morning.
- Did I wake you?

837
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,740
No.

838
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,580
Ooh.

839
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,575
Oh, it looks like a beautiful day.

840
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,894
I feel so spoiled and so lazy.

841
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:44,898
Do you realise I don't have
a thing to do until Thursday?

842
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,454
- What's Thursday?
- When Lord X comes again.

843
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,580
Oh. Oh!

844
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,659
You know what let's do? Let's rent
a tandem and ride out to the country.

845
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,817
- Trees and grass and fresh air.
- Not today.

846
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,408
Or we could go to the Bois
and row around the lake.

847
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,939
Maybe next week.

848
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,609
We don't have to do anything.
We could stay in bed all day.

849
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,696
I'd like that.

850
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,372
- Want your breakfast now or later?
- Much later.

851
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,656
I've got a surprise for you.

852
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,454
- Close your eyes.
- Thank you.

853
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,736
When I was at the department store,
buying the curtains, I saw this.

854
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,897
And you know how I feel
about green, so I tried it on.

855
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,853
There was a riot.
Three of the salesmen got trampled...

856
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,699
...so naturally I just had to have it.

857
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,972
Now, don't open your eyes yet.
I want you to see it against the light.

858
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,495
All right, you can look now.

859
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,140
Nestor?

860
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,260
Nestor.

861
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,649
- Nestor!
- Not today.

862
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,736
Maybe next week?

863
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,980
All right.

864
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:15,615
If that's the way you feel about it.

865
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:29,456
- My dear girl.
- I was afraid you wouldn't show up.

866
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:35,371
Almost didn't. Ran into dirty weather over
the Channel. Unusually foggy for July.

867
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,652
- What is it, my dear?
- You've changed somehow.

868
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,089
Have I? How?

869
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:51,130
That patch, shouldn't it be
on the other eye?

870
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,260
Oh.

871
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,692
Indeed. Well, no wonder it was so foggy.

872
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:05,133
- I've been practising. I'll be much better.
- Oh, let's get at it then, shall we?

873
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,060
Old goat.

874
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:26,457
How are things at home?
I mean, how's Lady X?

875
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:30,095
- Her usual self.
- How's the gardener?

876
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:34,096
Finally happened. Caught them
red-handed in the greenhouse.

877
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:38,099
I threw them out, pulled up the
drawbridge, started divorce proceedings.

878
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,654
- That's too bad.
- Catastrophe.

879
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,419
Best damn gardener I ever had.

880
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,496
Must be lonely for you at the castle.

881
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:50,056
Very. Especially at night,
just me and the family ghost...

882
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:53,456
...spooking around those 96 rooms.

883
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:56,777
- How many?
- Not to mention the 400 acres...

884
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,336
...and the croquet field,
and the trout hatchery.

885
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:05,454
And all the horses. I breed trotters
and pacers. Separate stables, you know.

886
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,297
I imagine there must be lots
of trees and grass and a brook.

887
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,538
And swans and peacocks and... unicorns.

888
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,334
It sounds like a wonderful place for
Coquette. I'd like to get her out of the city.

889
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,769
- She drinks, you know.
- Really?

890
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,899
I keep finding empty
bottles under the bed.

891
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:26,569
Well...

892
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,578
Love to invite you to the castle,
both of you...

893
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:34,330
...but I'm sure you wouldn't dream
of leaving your young man.

894
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,056
No, I guess not.

895
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:42,617
- Although sometimes I wonder.
- Is something troubling you?

896
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,176
Well, suddenly he seems so different.
I mean, so indifferent.

897
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,895
He's tired all the time,
not interested in me at all.

898
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,693
I'm sure there must be some explanation.

899
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:55,050
I'm beginning to think
he's got another girl.

900
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,855
That's ridiculous! Why would
anybody with a... girl like you...

901
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,778
Somebody ought to give
that young man a good talking to.

902
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,698
- Would you like to meet him?
- Meet him?

903
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:07,175
He's waiting for me across the street.

904
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,939
I really ought to be getting to the airport.

905
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:13,052
Oh, it'll only take a minute.
Come on. We'll buy you a drink.

906
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:17,458
Thank you, but no thank you.
I mean, while I'm getting my divorce...

907
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,969
...we really shouldn't be
seen with each other.

908
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,616
Yes. Yes, you must be careful. Maybe we
shouldn't even leave the hotel together.

909
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,655
Capital suggestion. Shall we
rendezvous again next Monday, hm?

910
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,736
Of course.

911
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,535
Oh, I don't feel right about this.

912
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:39,379
It's taking money under false pretences.

913
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,936
- After all, I don't do anything for you.
- Balderdash.

914
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:47,576
Why, if it weren't for this arrangement
of ours, I should go through the ceiling.

915
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,134
Of course, it must be very boring for you.

916
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,216
Not at all. I enjoy it.

917
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,340
Oh.

918
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,740
You've made me a very happy man.

919
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,849
Half-man, I should say.

920
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:03,376
Well, ta-ta...

921
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:08,770
...toodle-oo, and tally-ho.

922
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:19,054
Up. Get up, you lush.

923
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:23,015
Look at those circles under your eyes.

924
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:27,338
Carry on like this, and we'll
have to have your face lifted.

925
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,339
Say, you're the Englishman
that's seeing Irma.

926
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:42,975
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- I'm Hippolyte the Ox.

927
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,056
What is on your mind, Mr Ox?

928
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:49,651
I just thought if you were interested
in something new, more unusual...

929
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:53,773
- Twins, you know.
- What, and play three-handed solitaire?

930
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,856
No, thanks.

931
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:21,860
Order!

932
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,293
Come on, everybody! It's getting late!

933
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,809
- Let's take a vote.
- All right.

934
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:31,979
The motion on the floor is that every girl
contributes one day's earnings a week...

935
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,137
...toward our pension fund.
All those in favour?

936
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,216
- Aye!
- Aye!

937
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,016
Carried unanimously.

938
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,098
OK, girls, let's have it.

939
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,696
- I'm back, Nestor.
- Hi. Ooh, that was a rough meeting.

940
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:57,129
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

941
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,658
Thank you.

942
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,897
- What's that for?
- You just voted for it. The pension fund.

943
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,020
Huh?

944
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,776
Just part of my programme.

945
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:11,257
Now that I'm president, I'm gonna
get this organisation movin' ahead.

946
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:18,132
- How did it go with His Lordship?
- Fine. I'm beginning to like him a lot.

947
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:21,730
It's a good thing the bridge fell on him,
I might be jealous. Cognac.

948
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,930
Pernod for me. Nothing for her.

949
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:27,336
He's getting a divorce, so maybe now
he can see me more often.

950
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:30,532
More often? I doubt it.
Where would he get the money?

951
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,935
Well, he's got this big estate.

952
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,335
You know what the taxes are in England?

953
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:39,692
Why, some of those lords
have to scrounge around for a living.

954
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,613
If he saw me three times a week,
that's 1500 francs.

955
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:51,696
I could buy you a car.

956
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:58,530
A sports model. Kiki thinks she's such
a hotshot cos she got her guy a scooter.

957
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:02,573
Just wait till they see you drivin' up
and down the street with the top down.

958
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:06,534
- And I'll get you a little cap to go with it.
- What are you doing?

959
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:10,577
- He's trying to get the lipstick off.
- Lipstick?

960
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,895
- Where did that come from?
- Good question.

961
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,976
- It must have been you.
- That's it.

962
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:18,251
Me? I was in the hotel with His Lordship.

963
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,530
That's not it.

964
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:23,777
Oh, yes, I was at the board meeting,
we were takin' a vote...

965
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,289
...and one of the girls
was doin' a little lobbyin'.

966
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:31,289
- That must be it.
- Which girl was doing a little lobbying?

967
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,736
Come on, Tiger, how about it?

968
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,016
Hey, you dropped something.

969
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,540
Where?

970
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,660
There.

971
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,856
Oh, uh, now, please.
Look, girls, this is ridic...

972
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:09,135
Now, I'm the president here. Uh-oh.

973
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,690
Well, that's enough.
Let's shake hands and make up, hm?

974
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,460
Oh, why?

975
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,260
Girls!

976
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,576
Oh, no. You wouldn't...

977
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,380
Agh!

978
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:09,210
Good morning, Tiger. How about
some breakfast? Fresh croissants?

979
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:12,218
- I better get back before she wakes up.
- You look terrible.

980
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:15,969
- You must have lost 10 pounds.
- 15. I weighed myself on the meat scales.

981
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:20,173
What do you expect? Loading, unloading,
in the window, out the window...

982
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,610
...on with the beard, off with the beard.
You're going to fall apart.

983
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,095
I don't care, as long as
I keep her off the streets.

984
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:28,973
It's a hard way to earn an easy living.

985
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,740
Nestor?

986
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:52,017
You know, Irma, I'm a little bit
disappointed in you.

987
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:55,257
You promised me
you wouldn't smoke any more.

988
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:01,254
Aren't you gonna say anything?

989
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:07,209
I suppose you're wondering where I was?

990
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:10,252
- I know where you were.
- You do?

991
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:14,009
- You were out with the boys.
- Yeah, that's right.

992
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,700
- Don't lie to me!
- Well, where was I?

993
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:19,175
You were out with Lolita.

994
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:23,935
That's right.
Let me go to bed. I'm very tired.

995
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:27,609
- You've been with her every night.
- Oh, no, I haven't.

996
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,776
- No?
- No, not every night.

997
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:33,449
Sometimes I was with... Amazon Annie...

998
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:38,700
...and sometimes with Mimi the Maumau,
and sometimes with the twins...

999
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:41,618
...and... they all want me to handle 'em.

1000
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,415
So I've decided to branch out, you know.

1001
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:52,332
Business is business. And don't you
forget, around here, I'm numero uno.

1002
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,491
You make me sick!

1003
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,135
What are you gonna do about it?

1004
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,813
This is what you came with. Now get out!

1005
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:15,733
You're not throwin' me out,
cos you're crazy about me, aren't you?

1006
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:18,533
- Let go!
- Gonna buy me a new car, remember?

1007
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:20,378
- And a sports cap.
- Let go!

1008
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:25,620
And when you buy me the sports cap,
I want it with a little strap in the back.

1009
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:30,734
That's what you'll get from me. Let them
work for you and see how well you do!

1010
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,694
You think you're numero uno?
I'm numero uno!

1011
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,937
Go outside on the street
and ask the first man you see.

1012
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,210
Ask anybody!

1013
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,656
I'm sorry, it's...

1014
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:18,050
<i> Here we are in the 7 th inning,</i>
<i>two out, Maury Wills on first.</i>

1015
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:22,617
<i>The ball game coming to you direct from</i>
<i>LA, over the American Forces Network.</i>

1016
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:26,733
<i>Marichal on the rubber, into a stretch.</i>
<i>Here's the pitch and there he goes.</i>

1017
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:31,980
<i>The throw down to second base</i>
<i>is not in time. He's stolen another one.</i>

1018
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,175
Hello.

1019
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,894
Here you are. I was afraid
you mightn't show.

1020
01:38:57,020 --> 01:39:02,140
I didn't realise it was so late. I've been
walking the streets all day... thinking.

1021
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:05,411
- There's something I'd like to discuss.
- By all means.

1022
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,340
Not here.

1023
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,970
I don't want Nestor to know.

1024
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:14,173
Let's not take any chances, hm?
Shall we go up to your office?

1025
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:32,055
Now then, my dear, what is it
that's so important, hm?

1026
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:36,933
- Did you mean what you said?
- Indeed. What did I say?

1027
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,654
About taking me to England with you.

1028
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:43,096
Of course I meant it, if I said it.

1029
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:46,750
And if you say so,
I must've said it, so I meant it.

1030
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,850
I'm ready.

1031
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:50,858
But you can't go. What about Nestor,
or whatever his name is?

1032
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:55,929
Nestor, Hippolyte, it doesn't matter.
Sooner or later, they give you a bad time.

1033
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,858
- The brutes.
- So, if you want me to go with you...

1034
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,369
It's a bit of a sticky wicket.

1035
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:05,373
If it's in any way awkward,
I don't want to embarrass you.

1036
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,219
Not at all, my dear. I'd be delighted.

1037
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:14,609
It's just that... there's this
ghastly servant problem right now.

1038
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:18,574
The castle's overrun with plumbers,
the moat is leaking.

1039
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:23,012
Besides, I'm a shattered man.
I'd be of no use to you.

1040
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,296
Are you sure?

1041
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:30,253
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my way to Zurich now.

1042
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,371
I wasn't planning to go to England at all.

1043
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,890
Going to consult
a Swiss doctor, a specialist.

1044
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:39,891
But that's a waste of time.
They can't help you.

1045
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:42,978
I once knew a specialist,
used to send his patients to me.

1046
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,216
- To you?
- The tough cases.

1047
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:48,616
Poor guys. Thought they'd run out of gas,
but they were just stalled.

1048
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:51,413
- All they needed was a little push.
- A push.

1049
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:55,089
I mean, mentally.
To stimulate their imagination.

1050
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:58,339
- It's all up here, you know.
- I wish it were.

1051
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:00,530
I had one patient given up as hopeless...

1052
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:03,299
...until I started telling him
about the South Seas.

1053
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,412
The South Seas? What a curious gambit.

1054
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,496
It worked.

1055
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:13,416
- Lie down.
- I beg your pardon?

1056
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:15,496
Stretch out, relax.

1057
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:20,538
Close your eyes. I mean, your eye.

1058
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,529
- No tricks now.
- I promise.

1059
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:32,380
You're in Tahiti. All right?

1060
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:36,015
Tahiti? Yes, I've been there
with Captain Bligh.

1061
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,131
Mutiny on the Bounty! Ha-ha!

1062
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,216
Down, Lord.

1063
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,536
Now concentrate.

1064
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:54,658
Palm trees swaying in the breeze...

1065
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:58,009
...a smell of ripe papayas...

1066
01:41:58,140 --> 01:42:03,260
...a blue lagoon, white sand,
golden-skinned girls.

1067
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:06,096
Have you got that?

1068
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:10,691
Blue lagoon, white sand, golden skin.

1069
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,810
- They're beautiful, aren't they?
- Are they ever. Oh...

1070
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:16,896
How many do you see?

1071
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,973
14, to be exact. They're wearing
grass skirts and coconut shells.

1072
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,216
- No, they're not.
- They're not?

1073
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:29,413
They're wearing sarongs
and hibiscus blossoms in their hair.

1074
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,060
Oh?

1075
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:34,529
Yes, by George, you're right.

1076
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:39,736
Now they take off their sarongs, and they
start washing them in the blue lagoon.

1077
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:43,096
Indeed. They...

1078
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:49,018
Look, it's no use. I mean,
I really am out of gas, uh, petrol.

1079
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:51,210
The tank is completely dry.

1080
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:54,332
All right, let's forget Tahiti. Lie back.

1081
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,055
- You're in Baghdad.
- Baghdad! Now how did I get there?

1082
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,180
Shh.

1083
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,330
You're in a bazaar.

1084
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:19,852
You see an exotic woman,
with a veil across her face.

1085
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:23,290
Big, black, almond eyes.

1086
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:26,972
She winks at you. You follow her.

1087
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,895
She disappears into a palace.

1088
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:34,172
There are two Nubian slaves standing
guard, so you climb over the wall.

1089
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:37,250
- How high?
- Ten feet.

1090
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:40,099
- I'll never make it.
- Try, you must try.

1091
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:44,008
I'm trying. Ow! Broken glass on the top.

1092
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:46,779
- Are you over?
- Just barely.

1093
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:48,580
Good.

1094
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:52,452
Now you're inside the harem.

1095
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:56,215
You're lying on silk pillows.

1096
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:00,177
Odalisques are fanning you.

1097
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,894
They're feeding you grapes...

1098
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:05,895
...painting your toenails...

1099
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:10,534
...while she does
the dance of the seven veils.

1100
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:16,254
She takes off... the fourth veil...

1101
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,415
...the fifth...

1102
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:23,179
...the sixth...

1103
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:44,618
You will be gentle, won't you?

1104
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,376
Your Lordship!

1105
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:11,660
Are you all right, Your Lordship?

1106
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:18,729
I will be, as soon as I pull myself together.

1107
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:24,810
You know, I think Lady X
must have been out of her mind.

1108
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:28,535
With you in the house, why would
she go puttering around in the garden?

1109
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,696
How kind of you to say so.

1110
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:33,129
What time does our plane
leave for London?

1111
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,216
- Eight o'clock.
- Oh.

1112
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,695
I'd better go home and pack.

1113
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:42,534
Look, I'm afraid I can't take you
to my castle in Worcestershire.

1114
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,810
- Why not?
- Because...

1115
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:47,773
...I don't have a castle
in Worcestershire.

1116
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,778
Of course not, it's in Yorkshire.

1117
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,733
Quite, but... what I mean to say...

1118
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:58,049
...I haven't been entirely frank
with you, my dear Irma.

1119
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:02,219
- You haven't?
- For instance, what I told you about...

1120
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:06,290
...unicorns. There are no unicorns.

1121
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,020
So what?

1122
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,493
So she'll play with the peacocks. And
don't worry about the servant problem.

1123
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:17,489
I'll cook for you, I'll serve you tea
in the afternoon, I'll knit you sweaters.

1124
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,576
I can be ready in 20 minutes.

1125
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:25,820
I'll meet you at the bistro across
the street, Chez Moustache, all right?

1126
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:28,613
Hey, are you there?

1127
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:32,411
- Your Lordship?
- Yes, I'm there.

1128
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,496
I mean, I'm here.

1129
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:39,412
And I'll be there. The bistro.

1130
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:46,016
Oh, and one more thing.
Keep away from Nestor. He's vicious.

1131
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,813
They don't call him Tiger for nothing.

1132
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:30,330
I say there, this is a bit of a jolly surprise.

1133
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:33,372
- What'll it be, Your Lordship?
- Don't mention that swine.

1134
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,532
Do you know what they've been
doing in that hotel room?

1135
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,616
Shattered man, my eye!

1136
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:42,096
And now they're running off to England -
Irma and the lord.

1137
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,370
She's packing.
She's going to walk out on <i>me.</i>

1138
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,968
- Nestor.
- He's taking her to his bloody castle.

1139
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,375
She's gonna make tea for him,
knit him sweaters.

1140
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:52,253
- You're talking crazy.
- They won't get away with it.

1141
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,577
I'll tear him apart.
I'll... throw him in the Seine.

1142
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:57,100
Nestor.

1143
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,810
There is no lord.

1144
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:06,294
- There isn't?
- That's right.

1145
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,888
How do you like that phoney?
He's been lying to her.

1146
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:11,580
What do you mean "he"?
There is no "he" - it's you!

1147
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:15,329
Of course it's me, but she doesn't
know that. And she doesn't know I know.

1148
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:19,055
But I know that she likes him
better than she likes me.

1149
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:20,180
See?

1150
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:23,973
She wouldn't even
take any money from him.

1151
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:29,650
- I think you'd better have a drink.
- The world isn't big enough for two of us.

1152
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:33,170
Lord X is gonna walk down
the street and disappear for ever.

1153
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:37,657
- Nobody's ever gonna see him again.
- I didn't want to see him in the first place.

1154
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:41,455
- Get my other clothes from the cellar.
- Coming up.

1155
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:56,016
Somebody oughta warn him. He shouldn't
flash all that money around here.

1156
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,928
- He's liable to get hit over the head.
- Are you gonna warn him?

1157
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,813
Me? It's none of my business.

1158
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,575
In a way, I'm going to miss you,
Your Lordship.

1159
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:13,728
Pull yourself together, old chap, hm?
Stiff upper lip and all that. Cheerio.

1160
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:18,495
One more for the road.

1161
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:26,060
Jojo, have you got
your blackjack on you?

1162
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:29,058
Sorry. How about some brass knuckles?

1163
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,529
Goodbye, Your bloody Lordship!

1164
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:16,378
I hate to see you go,
but <i>c'est la vie,</i> old chap!

1165
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:23,776
I hope you float back to England...

1166
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:26,653
...and I hope the fish
eat your bloody liver!

1167
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:16,580
Hey, police! Police!

1168
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:41,735
What's the time, Moustache?

1169
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:45,139
- Five after eight.
- Sure your watch isn't fast?

1170
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:48,093
Maybe, or maybe whoever
you're waiting for is slow.

1171
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:55,173
Here you are. Tomorrow at this time you'll
be chasing peacocks across the lawn.

1172
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:58,258
- Where are you going, anyway?
- I'm going to visit my aunt.

1173
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,735
She lives in Brussels.
That's Belgium, you know.

1174
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:04,296
Used to be a concert pianist,
but runs an orphanage now.

1175
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:08,174
Oh, come on, Irma, you can do
better than that. Is that seat taken?

1176
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,814
- Yes.
- Café au lait and a croissant.

1177
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:19,129
That aunt, could it be she has a beard and
an eye patch and her name is Lord X?

1178
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,893
If that's who you're waiting for,
he's not gonna show up.

1179
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:26,454
Can't I sit here without
being annoyed by riffraff?

1180
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:31,256
We get all kinds. Just a while ago,
we had a real live English lord in here.

1181
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:33,655
- He was here?
- Left about an hour ago.

1182
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:38,058
- Did he say where he was going?
- No. No message, no nothing.

1183
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:40,569
I saw him walkin' down
the street toward the river.

1184
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:42,656
But we have a date here.

1185
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:46,455
Maybe he forgot.
Maybe he changed his mind.

1186
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,699
He'll come for me. <i>He's</i> a gentleman.

1187
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:53,051
Gentleman? Don't make me laugh.

1188
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:57,332
- You know nothing about men.
- I know nothing about men?

1189
01:53:57,460 --> 01:54:00,657
And you know why?
Because you've been with too many.

1190
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:03,613
- Thanks a lot.
- You think you're such an expert on love.

1191
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,890
You can't even tell
when somebody loves you!

1192
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:07,612
- Like who?
- Like me.

1193
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:12,177
Like hell. You only love
that 500 francs twice a week.

1194
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,894
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

1195
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:32,169
Nestor Patou, I arrest you
for the murder of Lord X.

1196
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:36,009
- What? The murder of who?
- You recognise these clothes?

1197
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:43,688
That's his umbrella and his eye patch
and his solitaire card.

1198
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:45,333
- Thank you.
- Where's the lord?

1199
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:47,576
- At the bottom of the Seine.
- Oh, no!

1200
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:50,009
That's a lot of nonsense.
There is no Lord X.

1201
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:52,654
Of course there isn't,
because you killed him.

1202
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:55,931
I saw the whole thing.
He beat him up, stole his wallet...

1203
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,972
...threw his body in the river.

1204
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,100
Oh!

1205
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:03,735
Irma, I... Wait a minute.
Moustache, tell 'em.

1206
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:06,454
Yes, that's the lord's!

1207
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:10,698
- Oh, he was such a sweet man!
- The old, familiar pattern.

1208
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:14,608
Policeman turns dishonest, becomes
a <i>mac</i> and finally winds up as a murderer.

1209
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:17,891
- It's an open and shut case.
- Well, you'll just have to reopen it.

1210
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:19,772
- Moustache can prove...
- Shh.

1211
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,936
My client has nothing more to say.

1212
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:25,257
- Your client?
- I have a law degree from Grenoble.

1213
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:28,935
Used to be one of the leading criminal
attorneys before I was disbarred.

1214
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:31,779
- But that's another story.
- Put the handcuffs on him.

1215
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:36,132
Just a moment. The accused has
a right to confer with his lawyer.

1216
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:41,699
What are you trying to do?
Why not just tell 'em the truth?

1217
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:44,459
- The truth? That's dynamite.
- But I'm innocent.

1218
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:47,970
The jails are full of innocent people
because they told the truth.

1219
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,137
You couldn't have killed Lord X
because <i>you</i> were Lord X...

1220
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:53,330
...only you weren't Lord X,
you were a <i>mac.</i>

1221
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:56,133
Only you weren't a <i>mac,</i>
you worked in the market...

1222
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,138
...to pay for making love
to your own girl...

1223
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:02,457
...whom you could have made love to
for free, except you were too tired...

1224
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:05,936
...from making the money to give to Lord X
to give to Irma to give to you.

1225
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:12,135
That's the truth. If you tell that mishmash
to a jury, you're a cinch to get 15 years.

1226
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:18,779
- Wha... what am I gonna do?
- Nothing. Just put yourself in my hands.

1227
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:23,339
Gentlemen, my client admits his crime.

1228
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:26,657
- He does?
- I do?

1229
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:28,816
But let us consider the motive.

1230
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,329
Why would a <i>mac</i> kill
his girl's best customer?

1231
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:34,691
For 500 francs, when he can get
that twice a week every week?

1232
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:37,857
It would be like killing the goose
that laid the golden egg.

1233
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:40,289
Or because they were
running away together?

1234
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:44,618
Because he was losing his meal ticket?
That's equally ridiculous.

1235
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:48,858
He's the king around here. He could
have had any girl working for him.

1236
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:51,580
That's right.

1237
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:56,336
So we are left with only one
possible motive - jealousy.

1238
01:56:56,460 --> 01:57:01,614
He was so in love with Irma, he couldn't
bear to have any other man touch her.

1239
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:07,736
Yes, Inspector, it's the old,
familiar pattern - crime of passion.

1240
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,293
Nestor, is that true?

1241
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:15,140
Yes.

1242
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,496
You did it because you loved me?

1243
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,576
Now you know.

1244
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,934
And I'd kill any other man
who came near you.

1245
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,770
Gets you right here, doesn't it?

1246
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:29,334
Take him away!

1247
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:34,580
Nestor, I love you, and I'll wait
for you, no matter how long it takes.

1248
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:50,577
You won't have to wait very long.
This is France, a civilised country.

1249
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:53,089
<i>L'amour, toujours l'amour.</i>

1250
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:55,415
When the jury hears my summation -

1251
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:58,338
two people in the gutter,
reaching for the stars -

1252
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,257
they'll cry, they'll cheer...

1253
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:04,009
...they'll carry him out of
the courtroom on their shoulders.

1254
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:20,816
Hey, Patou!

1255
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:25,820
Patou!

1256
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:34,095
There's a visitor here to see you.

1257
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:55,654
- Oh, it's you.
- Shh.

1258
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:00,256
You're lucky I can't get my hands on you.

1259
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:03,929
- That's no way to talk to your lawyer.
- You were gonna get me off scot-free.

1260
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:06,335
They were gonna carry me
out on their shoulders.

1261
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:11,056
- Well, you can't win 'em all.
- 15 years at hard labour, for what?

1262
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,339
It's too bad you didn't get sentenced to
death. I'd have had it commuted to life...

1263
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:18,293
...and I could have gotten you
paroled by Christmas.

1264
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:21,890
But a 15-year sentence,
that's neither here nor there.

1265
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:25,170
Never mind that,
tell me about Irma. How is she?

1266
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:29,691
She's fine. Here,
I brought you a little souvenir.

1267
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:33,176
Thanks. Why doesn't she
come to see me any more?

1268
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:37,339
- Why haven't I heard from her?
- Well, she doesn't want you to find out.

1269
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:39,815
Find out what? She's not
back on the street again?

1270
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:43,694
Oh, no. That's over with. She's still
working at the fish market as a cashier.

1271
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:46,095
Well, then, what is it? I wanna know.

1272
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:48,051
- She's expecting.
- Who?

1273
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:51,536
Who do you think? She's out to here.
She's going to have a baby.

1274
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:53,457
A baby? Are you sure?

1275
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:56,378
I'd be greatly disappointed
if it were anything else.

1276
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,014
- When?
- Any day now.

1277
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:03,133
Listen, Moustache, I gotta get outta here.
I wanna be with her. She needs me.

1278
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:06,570
- Here, I brought you another souvenir.
- More stockings?

1279
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,656
And another.

1280
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:12,612
- And another.
- Have you gone mad?

1281
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:17,018
- And one more.
- What am I gonna do with all of these?

1282
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:24,659
If you don't want them, throw them out
the window. But first... tie them together.

1283
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:25,780
What?

1284
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,731
You can't park here.

1285
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:03,658
There's something wrong with my motor.

1286
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:07,536
- Nestor!
- Shh.

1287
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,490
What are you doing here?
How did you get away?

1288
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:13,531
- Give me your hand.
- Did they let you out?

1289
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:15,730
- Try this on.
- You escaped, didn't you?

1290
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:18,499
- Hold still.
- Darling, why did you do that?

1291
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:22,659
- Now they'll give you another five years.
- I was afraid of that, it's too big.

1292
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:24,930
- What's this?
- We're gonna be married.

1293
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:29,053
- Married?
- You want our child to be legitimate?

1294
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:32,456
- Why, yes, of course.
- How is the baby?

1295
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:36,334
Full of mischief. Yesterday
it kicked Coquette right off my lap.

1296
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:40,817
Takes after me. When I was six months
old, I could change my own diapers.

1297
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:45,338
- Nestor...
- What is it?

1298
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:48,896
- I can't marry you.
- What do you mean, you can't marry me?

1299
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:53,377
- Because I love you.
- You love me, so you can't marry me?

1300
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:58,255
That's right. Because it isn't our baby.
You're not the father.

1301
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:00,900
I'm not?

1302
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:03,450
Who's the father? I'll kill him!

1303
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:06,697
You already did. It was Lord X.

1304
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:08,220
Lord X?

1305
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:15,492
- Well, what... what makes you think?
- A woman always knows these things.

1306
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:17,815
I don't care. I'll marry you anyway.

1307
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:21,489
And I'll raise it
just as if it were my own child.

1308
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,735
They've got the place surrounded.

1309
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:50,138
Maybe you could go through
the kitchen window and over the roof.

1310
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:52,615
No, I prefer the closet.

1311
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:56,896
The closet?
That's the first place they'll look.

1312
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,736
Open up! Police!

1313
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,695
Come on! We know he's in there.

1314
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:17,540
Yah!

1315
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:22,815
All right, where's Nestor?

1316
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:26,489
Don't you know? He's in jail. You can
visit him there every other Sunday.

1317
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:29,134
Cute, huh? Let's search the place.

1318
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:59,453
- He's not in there.
- Not in there.

1319
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:47,455
- Not under here.
- Not under here.

1320
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:54,653
Come here, everybody.
This is the man we're looking for.

1321
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:27,252
- No sign of him.
- No sign of him.

1322
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:34,249
Tell him he'd better give himself up, or
he'll spend the rest of his life behind bars!

1323
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:36,336
Let's go, men.

1324
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:42,336
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

1325
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:45,136
Let's go, men.

1326
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:57,891
Did you hear what he said?
What are you going to do?

1327
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:00,932
Well, the first thing I have
to do is exchange the ring.

1328
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:04,575
But we can't get married now.
You must run, you must hide.

1329
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:09,012
Nonsense. We'll have a church wedding
with ushers and bridesmaids and flowers.

1330
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:13,258
- Moustache is making the arrangements.
- But they'll catch you, lock you away.

1331
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:18,329
- I'm so afraid I'll never see you again.
- Don't be. Maybe a miracle will happen.

1332
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:21,179
- I don't believe in miracles.
- Don't you?

1333
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:26,651
When I met you, you were a streetwalker.
Now you're gonna be a wife and a mother.

1334
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:29,248
Isn't that a miracle?

1335
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:38,538
They're wasting their time
looking for him at Irma's.

1336
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:41,891
- Don't worry, they'll catch him.
- No, they won't. Too much brains.

1337
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:43,976
He's smarter than the whole police force?

1338
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:47,888
No, but I am. They're up
against the mastermind.

1339
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:51,729
Oh. I'll bet by now you have him
on a boat to South America.

1340
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:54,215
- Guess again.
- To Hong Kong?

1341
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,695
He's right here in town.

1342
02:08:57,820 --> 02:09:00,937
- You don't say?
- It's ordinary common sense.

1343
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:04,689
You've heard about a criminal always
returning to the scene of the crime?

1344
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:07,493
The police would never think
of looking there.

1345
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:11,818
- You mean he's under the same bridge?
- Yeah, the Pont Royal.

1346
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:16,333
Look, if you open up your mouth
about this to anyone...

1347
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:21,818
Me? Squeal on a colleague? There's such
a thing as the code of the underworld.

1348
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:44,615
Desk sergeant? Connect me
with Inspector Lefèvre.

1349
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:49,050
Just tell him I want to
squeal on a colleague.

1350
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,060
Hey.

1351
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:05,172
- You!
- I beg your pardon?

1352
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:08,337
- You're supposed to be dead, murdered.
- Are you quite sure?

1353
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:12,089
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- Sorry to disappoint you, old boy...

1354
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:16,179
...but other than a headache, I'm feeling
absolutely chapper, I mean, chipper.

1355
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:19,975
We've been dragging the river for the
last nine months. Where have you been?

1356
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:24,616
A fair question. Now, let me see.
I haven't the foggiest.

1357
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:30,417
All I can remember is that the climate was
rather wet, but the fishing was quite good.

1358
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:36,172
Now, I trust that that clears things up
satisfactorily, so cheerio and carry on.

1359
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:13,214
Are you all right?

1360
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:15,615
The pains are coming
every two minutes now.

1361
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:18,413
Just try to hold on a little longer.

1362
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:29,410
Where's the groom?

1363
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:41,532
Don't worry. If worst comes to worst,
I'll marry you myself.

1364
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:04,978
- You look lovely.
- Later, later.

1365
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:09,729
Nestor, wilt thou take Irma
here present for thy lawful wife...

1366
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:12,579
...according to the rite
of our holy mother, the Church?

1367
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:13,894
I will.

1368
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:17,535
Irma, wilt thou take Nestor
here present for thy lawful husband...

1369
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,730
...according to the rite of our holy mother?

1370
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:21,213
I will.

1371
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:27,415
<i>Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium, in</i>
<i>nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctis.</i>

1372
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:29,940
<i>Amen.</i>

1373
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:38,650
<i>Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini,</i>
<i>qui fecit coelum et terram.</i>

1374
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:41,215
<i>Domine, exaudi orationem meam...</i>

1375
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:43,450
<i>... et clamor meus ad te veniat.</i>

1376
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:47,368
<i>Dominus vobiscum</i>
<i>et cum spirito tuo. Oremus.</i>

1377
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:14,532
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

1378
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:18,494
- And I pledge thee my fidelity.
- And I pledge thee my fidelity.

1379
02:14:27,980 --> 02:14:29,936
Just a minute, Patou.

1380
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:33,450
I wanna congratulate you.
It was touching.

1381
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:36,890
- Awful nice of you to show up.
- We're planning a reception for you.

1382
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:39,853
- At the police station.
- My wife is about to have...

1383
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:42,699
A hoax has been perpetrated.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

1384
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:45,937
- You can't arrest me in a church.
- Arrest you?

1385
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:48,938
I want you to rejoin the force
and help us solve this case.

1386
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:51,255
Rejoin the force? Gee, I'd like that.

1387
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:54,053
Not unless I can have my old job back,
at the playground.

1388
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:56,774
Playground? Work for
peanuts and jellybeans?

1389
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:59,858
I'm crazy about children.
I'm about to have one myself.

1390
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:05,054
I just had it. Excuse me.

1391
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:19,216
It's a girl. Smoothest delivery I ever had.

1392
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:22,173
She's beautiful. <i>You</i> delivered the baby?

1393
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:27,249
Why not? I was chief obstetrician in
Equatorial Africa, under Dr Schweitzer.

1394
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:34,100
Nestor.

1395
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:41,814
- They're not taking you away?
- You can call me Officer Patou again.

1396
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,931
- What happened?
- Not now.

1397
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:47,814
Oh, let me hold her.

1398
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:53,329
Oh, it's gonna be such fun
bringing her up.

1399
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:57,490
I can put her in organdie
dresses and pinafores.

1400
02:15:57,620 --> 02:16:00,210
And I'm gonna get her some
green stockings and a puppy.

1401
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:01,310
Yeah.

1402
02:16:01,410 --> 02:16:05,168
Oh, no. No green stockings. No puppy.

1403
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:07,256
- No?
- No.

1404
02:16:35,313 --> 02:16:37,016
Cheeribye.

1405
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:49,324
But that's another story.

1406
02:17:03,336 --> 02:17:06,391
