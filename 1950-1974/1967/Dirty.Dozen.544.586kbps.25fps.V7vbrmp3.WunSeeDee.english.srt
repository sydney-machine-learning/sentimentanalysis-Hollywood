1
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:24,504
Come on! Knock it off.
Knock it off!

2
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:29,071
Gardner, keep telling them
you're innocent.

3
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,945
Don't let them see you're afraid, kid!

4
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,352
lt'll be all right, son.

5
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:50,150
I didn't wanna do it, sir.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry!

6
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,025
I didn't. . . . Sir? Sir?

7
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:58,143
It won't happen again, sir.
I didn't want. . . .

8
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:12,825
I didn't. . . .

9
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,392
Private Arthur James Gardner. . .

10
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:20,465
. . .you've been found guilty
as charged for the crime of murder.

11
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:23,062
Your case has been appealed
three times. . .

12
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,712
. . .and reviewed three times.

13
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:28,030
The verdict of each court-martial
has been the same:

14
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,512
Guilty as charged.

15
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:33,784
Do you have anything to say before
sentence is carried out?

16
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,504
I didn't mean it.

17
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,752
l-- I'm sorry.

18
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:45,944
I didn't mean to.

19
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,628
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,430
Open it up.

21
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,191
Enjoy the show, major?

22
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,466
I want to see Major Armbruster.

23
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,352
-Just down the corridor--
-Yeah, I know where it is. I know.

24
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,390
John. Good to see you.

25
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:47,670
Don't you give me that. We had
dinner last night together, remember?

26
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:53,303
Be nice. Take it easy.

27
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:59,872
This time it's serious, John.
You've gotta cooperate.

28
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,826
Let's go.

29
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:12,466
Colonel.
General is waiting, major.

30
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,545
Major Reisman, sir.

31
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,785
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

32
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,506
-Sit down, major.
-Thank you, sir.

33
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:42,352
Well, major, what did you think
of the hanging?

34
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:46,465
Looked very efficient.
Then again, I'm not an expert.

35
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:50,427
I meant, how did you
personally feel about it?

36
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,669
It wasn't the nicest way
to spend an evening.

37
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,792
Well, it wasn't staged
for your entertainment, you know.

38
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,784
I hope Private Gardner
was aware of that.

39
00:03:57,993 --> 00:03:59,506
-Private who?
-Private Gardner.

40
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,028
He was the object of the exercise.

41
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:06,186
There happens to have
been a reason, major.

42
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,102
I've got your service record here, major.

43
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:14,147
A lot of fireworks. A lot of transfers.

44
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:17,982
One tough scrape after another,
very short on discipline.

45
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,547
Very short on discipline.

46
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,908
I hear you did a pretty good job in Italy.

47
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:30,068
Then you loused it up by exceeding your
orders. And that's not the first time.

48
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:33,583
-I didn't write those reports, sir.
-What is that supposed to mean?

49
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,028
I don't necessarily agree
with what's in them.

50
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,543
-Maybe you'd like to write your own?
-No, thank you, sir.

51
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:44,188
I'm not very interested in embroidery,
only results.

52
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:49,432
Now, you hold it right there.

53
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,625
This war was not started
for your private gratification.

54
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,704
And you can be damn sure
that this Army. . .

55
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:57,467
. . .isn't being run for your
personal convenience, either.

56
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:04,066
You've been waiting for a transfer
for over two months now.

57
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:07,310
With a record like yours,
you could go on waiting forever.

58
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,386
However, I get orders too.
And right now I've got some. . .

59
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:14,665
. . .that sound as if they were made
for somebody just like you.

60
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,711
Personally, I don't go for this
behind-the-lines nonsense.

61
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:21,707
As far as I'm concerned, a soldier's job
is to wear his uniform and kill the enemy.

62
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:24,066
But that's another matter.

63
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,102
I'm gonna ask General Denton
to read these orders. . .

64
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,752
. . .just as they came down to us.

65
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,222
After, if you have any questions, ask.
Understand?

66
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,190
-Yes, sir.
-General.

67
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,026
"Project Amnesty:

68
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,588
You will select 12 prisoners
sentenced to death. . .

69
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:44,666
. . .or long-term imprisonment for murder,
rape, robbery or other violent crimes.

70
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,064
Train these prisoners in as much of the
behind-the-lines operations. . .

71
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,906
. . .as they can absorb in a brief
but unspecified time.

72
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:54,423
You'll then deliver them secretly
to Europe and prior to the invasion. . .

73
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:58,666
. . .attack and destroy the target
specified: Overleaf. "

74
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,625
-That's all?
-That's all.

75
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:05,473
What about the target specified,
Overleaf?

76
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,391
Doesn't concern you now.

77
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,465
Well, what do you say, major?

78
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:12,711
I'd say it confirms a suspicion
I've had for some time now, sir.

79
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,148
Do you think we might share
that suspicion, major?

80
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:16,388
I think you should.

81
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,312
Since I'll have to assume we're
over here to win the war. . .

82
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,065
. . .it wouldn't pay to advertise. . .

83
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,952
. . .that one man we're working for
is a raving lunatic.

84
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:27,623
Now, that's enough, major. You're here
to be briefed on an operation.

85
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,432
You have permission to ask questions
about that operation.

86
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:33,107
You do not have permission
to make personal comments. . .

87
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,952
. . .concerning the officers
responsible for its conception.

88
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,546
-Now, is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

89
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:39,510
Ask relevant questions or shut up.

90
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,352
Is it relevant to ask why I'm being
offered this mission?

91
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:46,108
It's not, as you say, being offered.

92
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:48,545
I'm volunteering.

93
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,066
Exactly, major.

94
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:52,707
I'm glad you look at these things
so realistically.

95
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:56,948
I don't mean to appear unduly cautious,
but if my personal survival. . .

96
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:59,428
. . .depends on the performance
of 12 deadheads. . .

97
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:02,630
. . .it might be helpful to know exactly
what I'm training them for.

98
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,472
Now, that's a very good question, major.

99
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:08,904
-Armbruster, let's have the basic outline.
-Yes, sir.

100
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:14,429
"The Germans are using a large chateau
near Rennes in Brittany. . .

101
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:18,308
. . .as a rest center and a conference
place for general staff officers. "

102
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,663
The target has no real
military value itself. . .

103
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:24,343
. . .but with these conferences, discussion
groups and the like going on. . .

104
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:27,630
. . .there's hardly a day when
there aren't a considerable number. . .

105
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:30,023
. . .of important general officers
in residence.

106
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:33,185
Usually with the benefit
of female companionship.

107
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,269
"Eliminating a number of senior
officers couldn't but have the effect. . .

108
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,264
. . .of disrupting
their chain of command. "

109
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:42,192
The idea is simply that our men
are dropped by parachute.

110
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:45,550
They enter the chateau and kill
as many senior officers as is possible. . .

111
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,465
. . .in the time available.

112
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:52,149
Naturally, the place is fortified
and heavily guarded.

113
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:54,867
Naturally.
What's the deal with the men?

114
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,985
None whatsoever. Let's have
no misunderstanding about that.

115
00:07:58,153 --> 00:07:59,950
It's exactly what it says, an amnesty.

116
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,264
A temporary postponement.
You take it or leave it on that basis.

117
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:06,624
Like you say, sir, let's not
have any misunderstandings.

118
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,585
I don't like it. I think it stinks.

119
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,345
I've had enough of your insolence.

120
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,902
It's not a question of insolence
but of practicality.

121
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,422
I'm the guy that's being asked
to sell this idea. . .

122
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,663
. . .to 12 happy, smiling faces, right?

123
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:21,704
They do have an alternative way to go,
you know.

124
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:25,983
-That's no way for anybody to go.
-Oh, the hell you say, major.

125
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,872
Why, I know a lot of people
who should go exactly that way.

126
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:34,226
But that's beside the point.

127
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:37,226
Now, come on, major,
what's your basic objection?

128
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,903
These men are, by definition,
incapable of any discipline or authority. . .

129
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:42,552
. . .much less intensive training.

130
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:45,705
If there isn't a possibility
for a remission of their sentence. . .

131
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:49,582
. . .they have nothing to look forward to
and no reason to cooperate, right?

132
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:54,827
Got a point.
You got a point, major.

133
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,869
However, as you know,
I don't have the power. . .

134
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,263
. . .to reverse the findings
of a court-martial.

135
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,306
You do have the power to commute
the sentence of such a court.

136
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,872
-Excuse me, general.
-Yes?

137
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:08,952
You do have authority under the Visiting
Forces Act to make such a ruling.

138
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,872
-Visiting Forces Act?
-Yes, sir.

139
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:16,751
All right, major, you got a deal.

140
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:20,386
Let's say that if any of these men
distinguish themselves. . .

141
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,381
. . .then we will give serious consideration
to commuting their sentences.

142
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:26,265
That's no deal.

143
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,905
Who's to say whether they really
distinguish themselves or not?

144
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,263
You can leave that decision to me.

145
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:36,108
But remember, the other alternative
will apply with equal force.

146
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:39,066
Any breach of security,
any failure of discipline. . .

147
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,667
. . .those prisoners go right back
where they came from.

148
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,386
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

149
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:45,231
Good. Anything more, gentlemen?

150
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,665
Well, yes, sir. I noticed
Colonel Breed in the waiting room.

151
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,467
I wondered whether he was
connected with this operation.

152
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:55,902
-What if he is?
-I'd be very unhappy, sir.

153
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:01,589
Major, Colonel Breed
is your superior officer.

154
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:04,261
And you will behave
accordingly, at all times.

155
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,828
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

156
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:12,587
Now, it so happens that Colonel Breed
is not concerned with this operation.

157
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:16,189
But he is running the parachute school
where part of your training will be.

158
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:19,942
I don't want to hear any complaints,
from either of you.

159
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:24,265
Now, you've got a job to do,
mister, so move it.

160
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:25,822
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,422
Thank you, gentlemen.

162
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,826
Major Reisman seems to be heading
to his own court-martial.

163
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:42,427
He's the most ill-mannered,
ill-disciplined officer. . .

164
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,504
. . .it's ever been my displeasure to meet.

165
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,305
You think so, Denton?

166
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:51,189
You may be right.
But he's sure right about one thing.

167
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:54,510
Somebody up there must be
a raving lunatic.

168
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,071
Let's get Colonel Breed in here.

169
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:10,622
Open.

170
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:14,183
All right, you men,
this is an exercise period.

171
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:15,906
So exercise!

172
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,862
Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.

173
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,145
-Have the prisoners fall in.
-Sir.

174
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:43,029
Prisoners, fall in.
All right, come on now. Get with it!

175
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,591
-Come on, come on.
-Move it!

176
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:52,029
Come on, move!
Hey, you, move, I said, move.

177
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,629
"Franko, V.R.

178
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:08,991
Death by hanging.

00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,384
Vladek, M.

180
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:23,626
Thirty years' hard labor.

181
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,662
Jefferson, R.T.

182
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,344
Death by hanging.

183
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:45,509
Pinkley, V.L.

184
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,746
Thirty years' imprisonment.

185
00:12:58,073 --> 00:12:59,791
Gilpin, S.

186
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,225
Thirty years' hard labor.

187
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,711
Posey, S.

188
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:13,027
Death by hanging.

189
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,469
Wladislaw, T.

190
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,591
Death by hanging.

191
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:27,309
Sawyer, S.K.

192
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,785
Twenty years' hard labor.

193
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,583
Lever, R.

194
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,064
Twenty years' imprisonment.

195
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,825
Bravos, T.R.

196
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,910
Twenty years' hard labor.

197
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,349
Jiminez, P.

198
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:00,264
Twenty years' hard labor.

199
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,583
Maggott, A.J.

200
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,825
Death by hanging. "

201
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:21,392
All right, sergeant. Have them fall in
according to height, right to left.

202
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:26,744
According to height, fall in!

203
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:30,628
Come on, you jokers, you heard him.
Get in there! Fall in line!

204
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:37,344
-Come on, move!
-Come on, come on. Turn around.

205
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,987
Come on, here! I said, get in line.

206
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:46,149
Straighten up your jacket there.

207
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:47,905
Get over there.

208
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:53,267
-All right, have them count off.
-Sir. Count off!

209
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,147
Let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

210
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:07,345
-Hut, right!
-Right.

211
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,987
Left, march!

212
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:18,227
Hut, hut, hut, hut.

213
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:23,507
Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three.

214
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:34,149
Squad, halt!

215
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,947
About face!

216
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,542
Left, march!

217
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:47,508
Squad, halt!

218
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:52,102
Right face! At ease.

219
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:55,510
Now, what did I say to you?
Or maybe you don't understand English!

220
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,905
-What's the matter, Number 11 ?
-I got a pain.

221
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,023
-Where does it hurt?
-Well, I'll tell you. It's. . . .

222
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,708
I wish you would.
And do it correctly, please.

223
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:14,229
Oh, I don't have to say, sir, I. . . .
To you or anyone else.

224
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:17,590
And I don't have to march, either.
And I know the rules.

225
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,506
Why don't you have to march?

226
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:23,143
Because condemned men
don't have to drill.

227
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,793
And there's nothing you can
do about it, mister.

228
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:30,622
What's your name, son?

229
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,661
Eleven.

230
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,587
His name is Franko, sir.

231
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:43,831
Franko, come over here a minute.
Come on.

232
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:02,225
Look, you little bastard, either you
march or I'll beat your brains out.

233
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:03,667
Understand?

234
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:19,787
What'd you see, sergeant?

235
00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:23,389
I saw the major attacked by the prisoner
and forced to defend himself, sir.

236
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,267
All right, have the prisoner
taken back to his cell.

237
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,986
Take his head, I'll get his feet.

238
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:30,792
Now let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

239
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:32,466
Yes, sir.

240
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:36,507
Squad, ten-hut!

241
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:39,986
Right face.

242
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,471
Forward, march! Hut.

243
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,389
Squad, halt!

244
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,542
About face!

245
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:53,582
Forward, march!

246
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,272
General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.

247
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:25,266
So how's the jaw?

248
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:29,869
If you're gonna act tough, you should
learn how to take care of yourself.

249
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:31,506
You really should.

250
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,743
You're worried about my jaw?

251
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,228
Franko's pain bothers the major?

252
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,666
You were a big man with
the syndicate back in Chicago?

253
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:44,902
You've seen my record.

254
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:47,985
Yeah, I've seen your record,
so let's knock it off, huh?

255
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,423
So, what happens first
when you hit London?

256
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:55,144
You get involved in a penny-ante stickup
and start blasting and kill some old guy.

257
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:58,225
And come away with what?

258
00:18:58,673 --> 00:19:02,586
-What did you have when they got you?
-What did I have? What do you mean?

259
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:05,062
Come on, big shot.
How much money did you have?

260
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,224
I had enough.

261
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:12,949
Two pounds and 10 shilling.
That's almost 10 dollars.

262
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,501
You're gonna get yourself hung
for a lousy 10 bucks.

263
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:19,342
-What's that to you?
-Nothing.

264
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:22,471
Then why don't you get off my back?
You didn't come to visit me.

265
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,622
What do you want?

266
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:26,512
I don't care if they hang you
for 10 dollars or 10 cents.

267
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:28,629
It makes no difference to me.

268
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:33,869
But it just so happens that temporarily
I got a little pull around here.

269
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,224
And I might be able to get you
off the hook, if I wanted to.

270
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,306
Are you a general?

271
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:49,062
You're not a general, and only
a general can grant my reprieve.

272
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,865
Look, stupid.

273
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:54,306
I'm making you a proposition.

274
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,668
All I want from you
is a straight yes or no.

275
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:01,671
-You talk, I'll listen.
-Okay.

276
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:06,102
You either can sweat out the two days
you have before the hanging. . .

277
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,582
. . .or you join an outfit
that I'm putting together.

278
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:12,149
If you do that, I'll have you
out of here in less than 24 hours.

279
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:15,623
But you'll be worked to death, and
there's not a beating you won't take.

280
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,666
And then
when I'm satisfied with you. . .

281
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,348
. . .you'll go where the Army tells you.
Chances are you'll get killed anyway.

282
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,946
You don't know Victor Franko.

283
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:29,711
-Guard.
-All right, what's the deal?

284
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,511
What's the deal if I do stay alive?

285
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,465
-Might get off the hook.
-Count me in.

286
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:37,268
But you foul up once,
anywhere along the line, just once. . .

287
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,828
. . .and you'll be back here
at the end of a rope.

288
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,423
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?

289
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,783
You think I want to die?

290
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,183
If you do, then you don't
know Victor Franko.

291
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,147
How come you speak German?

292
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,183
Because my old man was
a coal miner in Silesia.

293
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:02,590
If he didn't speak German,
he didn't dig coal and he didn't eat.

294
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:05,466
That was the language he spoke
when he came to the States?

295
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,385
Pretty tough job in those days.

296
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,345
Yeah, it still is.

297
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:13,626
I don't like officers,
not any of them, and I never have.

298
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:17,630
But you were one yourself,
weren't you?

299
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:20,909
Yeah, three lousy days.

300
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:24,233
Somebody must have thought
you'd make a good officer.

301
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,828
They made a big mistake, didn't they?

302
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:29,787
Well, I thought you claimed
he was going over the hill.

303
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:32,302
What the hell are you talking about,
"claimed"?

304
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:34,429
He was going over the hill.

305
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,951
My outfit was pinned down by
the worst crossfire you ever saw.

306
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:41,509
Half of them bleeding to death.
And this lover took off like a rabbit. . .

307
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:43,504
. . .with the medical supplies
on his back.

308
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,943
The only way to stop him
was to shoot him.

309
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,345
Anyhow, he had it coming.

310
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:53,622
Yeah. But you only made
one mistake, huh?

311
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,107
Guard.

312
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,828
You let somebody see you do it.

313
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:13,706
General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.

314
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:20,466
"Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging. "

315
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,622
Hey, midnight.

316
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,382
Be a real good boy, now, and maybe
I'll let you eat with the white folks.

317
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,026
Well, Maggott, I see you've got
a sense of humor.

318
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:45,824
The all-American hero,
laughing in the face of death.

319
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,147
They're not gonna hang me, major.

320
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:58,746
I never raped that evil slut. . .

321
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,705
. . .or any other creature.

322
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:05,433
The Lord gave me that woman
and told me to chastise her.

323
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:07,669
Then he told you to beat her
to death, huh?

324
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:10,182
I only do what I'm called on to do.

325
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:16,703
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman. . .

326
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,545
. . .she tried to soil my spirit.

327
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,630
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.

328
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,064
But it seems to me I remember
a quotation that goes like:

329
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:25,422
Vengeance is mine.

330
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:31,784
Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.

331
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,666
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.

332
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:37,862
Exactly. Now, isn't that
supposed to mean. . .

333
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:40,906
. . .that we leave punishment
of the transgressors to his hands?

334
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:45,072
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.

335
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:49,391
But it doesn't restrict him to the kind
of tools he would use, now does it?

336
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:53,472
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.

337
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:57,151
You know, Maggott, I don't think
you're going to hang after all.

338
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:04,070
I think a man like you is destined
for higher things. Guard.

339
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:13,467
Besides, us Southern boys have
to stick together now, don't we?

340
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,028
I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.

341
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:25,350
But you do like I say,
and maybe they won't hang you.

342
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:28,431
Fixing to kill me some other way?

343
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,112
It might not come to that.

344
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:34,668
I reckon the folks would be a sight
happier if I died like a soldier.

345
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,465
Can't say I would.

346
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,347
Who does this hotshot major
think he is?

347
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:44,583
Making us play wet nurses
to a bunch of scum.

348
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:46,345
Corporal Morgan.

349
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:50,432
If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.

350
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,511
Now, move it.

351
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:59,105
Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.

352
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:02,032
Or maybe you think I should've let
those cracker bastards. . .

353
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:03,785
. . .go right ahead and castrate me?

354
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:06,309
Seeing what those guys
tried to do to you. . .

355
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:10,625
. . .I'd say that you had
considerable justification.

356
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:16,508
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.

357
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:22,065
But the court didn't agree, right?
So where does that leave you?

358
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:25,390
I'm offering you an alternative,
which means you can keep fighting.

359
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:28,187
-Who for, major?
-For yourself, if you want.

360
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,385
But the Krauts,
they're the real master-race merchants.

361
00:25:31,593 --> 00:25:33,470
That's your war, man, not mine.

362
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,511
You don't like the Krauts,
major, you fight them.

363
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:39,703
Me, I'll pick my own enemies.

364
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,667
That's your privilege. But you won't
be able to exercise it much longer.

365
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,266
Guard.

366
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:49,585
Because on March 25th,
you have a date with the hangman.

367
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:55,462
That's just six days from now.

368
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,669
Buenos días, major.

369
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:10,190
You know, sergeant, going over
the transcript of that man's trial. . .

370
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,429
. . .there are a couple of things
I don't get.

371
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:16,031
Did he ever claim
that he didn't do it?

372
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:19,908
I beg your pardon, but you haven't been
around prisons very much, have you?

373
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:24,072
You see, the first thing one learns
in prison, everybody is innocent.

374
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:27,829
This one, he doesn't say too much
about that one way or another.

375
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:32,743
He's only disturbed because we don't
allow him to have strings for his guitar.

376
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:34,744
Sergeant, did you ever lose a man. . .

377
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:37,108
. . .because he hung himself
with a guitar string?

378
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:39,662
No, sir, I haven't,
and I'm not about to.

379
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:42,341
Well, if he makes the trip,
see he gets the strings.

380
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,787
Yes, sir.

381
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,986
Attention!

382
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:01,223
-Tell the men to be seated.
-Yes, sir. Take seats!

383
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,107
-Guards out.
-Sir, l--

384
00:27:04,313 --> 00:27:06,463
-Guards out.
-Yes, sir.

385
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:09,187
You heard him. Guards, out!

386
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:23,741
My name, for those of you
who may have forgotten, is Reisman.

387
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:28,552
You've all volunteered for a mission
which gives you just three ways to go:

388
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,626
You can foul up in training and be sent
back here for execution of sentence. . .

389
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:34,385
. . .or you can foul up in combat. . .

390
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:37,027
. . .in which case
I'll blow your brains out. . .

391
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:40,942
. . .or you can do as you're told,
in which case you might just get by.

392
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:42,950
You must not attempt to escape.

393
00:27:43,113 --> 00:27:45,388
There will be no excuses,
there will be no appeal.

394
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:48,711
Any breach of either of these conditions
by any one of you. . .

395
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:52,183
. . .means you'll all be shipped back
for immediate execution of sentence.

396
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,708
You are therefore dependent
upon each other.

397
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:58,473
Any one of you try anything smart. . .

398
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:01,392
. . .and the 12 of you get it
right in the head, all right?

399
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:06,464
So try to remember that.

400
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,786
Now, are there any questions?

401
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:14,747
Sir?

402
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:19,989
Do we have to eat with niggers?

403
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,143
It's all right.
The gentleman from the South. . .

404
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:31,390
. . .made some kind of inquiries
about the dining arrangements.

405
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:34,909
He and his colleagues are discussing
the place-card settings. All right?

406
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,707
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

407
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:44,271
Look, corporal, fellas,
let's get with it, right? Remember?

408
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,112
Baseball, pitching?
Chicago's always had the pitching.

409
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:49,343
But now, as far as--
As far as hitting goes. . .

410
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:52,750
. . .well, my sister, she can hit
better than half them fellas.

411
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,591
Let's move it out!

412
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:04,262
-Well, what do you think, sergeant?
-I think you'll do just fine, sir.

413
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:06,828
Don't give me that.
I said, what do you think?

414
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:12,632
I think the first chance
one of them lovers gets. . .

415
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:16,064
. . .he's gonna shoot the major
right in the head, sir.

416
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,664
-Thank you, sergeant.
-Sir.

417
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:23,543
Okay, Franko. Let's go.

418
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:28,465
All right, move it out.

419
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:04,708
Come on.

420
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,222
Over there.

421
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,545
Sergeant, have the men fall in,
facing me.

422
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:41,626
Sir. All right, on your feet. Fall in
over here, double-quick! Come on now!

423
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,149
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up!

424
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:51,062
Jiminez, get in there!

425
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:54,391
Ten-hut!

426
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:58,506
All right, Franko, get rid
of that cigarette.

427
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:01,542
Thank you.

428
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,542
This will be your new home
until further notice.

429
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,065
What there is of it will be built
by you, but the construction. . .

430
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,349
. . .will in no way interfere
with your training.

431
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:15,262
So the sooner you get it up, the sooner
you'll be sleeping in out of the rain.

432
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:17,945
-Sergeant.
-Sir?

433
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:22,585
You're in charge. I want this compound
up and completed within the month.

434
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,268
Thank you.

435
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:46,872
If this place was on fire,
it'd burn to the ground.

436
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:48,791
Come on, what are you doing?

437
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:52,110
All right, come on. Let's move.
Come on.

438
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:58,833
Hey, Maggott, what are you? German?

439
00:33:10,993 --> 00:33:13,302
Hey, what are you trying to do,
break the window?

440
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,504
All right, sergeant, fall them in.

441
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,788
Fall in, in front of the hut.
On the double!

442
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:20,352
Round it up!

443
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:25,907
At ease.

444
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:31,308
All right, that'll be all for today.

445
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:33,988
How come they got
all the comforts of home?

446
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:37,988
Why can't we put our floor in?
Why can't we put our windows in?

447
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:41,230
-Franko's right.
-I'd rather sleep in my cell.

448
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:44,910
Mr. Franko, with his keen eye
for detail. . .

449
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,190
. . .has noted that the prisoners'
quarters are not yet ready.

450
00:33:49,513 --> 00:33:51,629
The answer to that is simple:

451
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:54,472
You are not yet ready
to occupy that hut. . .

452
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:57,667
. . .with the degree of comfort
that you would like.

453
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:01,789
When I think that you've earned
that privilege, I'll let you know.

454
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:05,708
Reveille is at 0530.

455
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,232
That is all. Sergeant.

456
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,068
Sir. You heard the man, chow time!

457
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:11,706
Dismissed!

458
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:16,911
That's it, fellas. Speak up, boys.
Speak up.

459
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,861
Wind it up, strike one!

460
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:29,143
Hey, Joseph, is that the way
they did it in the Polish navy?

461
00:34:29,513 --> 00:34:31,310
You won't win any cigars that way.

462
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,830
Hey, Franko, number please.

463
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,790
Ask the operator for my nickel back.

464
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:43,951
Why don't you guys
just dry up and blow away?

465
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:55,946
Meanwhile, on the Atlantic wall...

466
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:58,986
... the German forces
have been preparing...

467
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:01,753
...a few nice surprises for you,
gentlemen...

468
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,671
...just in case Mr. Churchill...

469
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:07,872
...is really foolish enough
to attempt an invasion.

470
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:11,471
He may not be
unduly worried about this...

471
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:15,546
...but then, of course, he will not
be taking any active part...

472
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,982
...in such an--

473
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:19,184
Hey, what's this guy's name again?

474
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:21,583
You ought to know.
You listen to him every night.

475
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:26,026
-Dumbo, get me a cup of coffee.
-You crazy?

476
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,111
I say shut the guy up.

477
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,742
-Sleepy time.
-Hey, jump through this, will you?

478
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,710
Hey, you. Come here.

479
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:52,103
You look like an intelligent guy.

480
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:56,106
-You like it here?
-No.

481
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:57,706
You gonna stay here?

482
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:02,108
-Well, I ain't got nowhere else to go.
-Ah, you're an idiot.

483
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,783
Hey, Wladislaw.
You understand German.

484
00:36:09,953 --> 00:36:11,909
Who's that dame singing about?

485
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,988
Well, it's about a very lonely girl. . .

486
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:19,425
. . .who's sick and tired of war
and being left alone.

487
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:24,949
-Waiting for her man to come home.
-Keep that cheap, wailing slut quiet!

488
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:35,587
Let's cut out the community sing.

489
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:38,706
Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.

490
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,471
Up yours.

491
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:43,711
Creeps. They're all creeps.
That's what they are. Creeps.

492
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:00,268
-Hey, where you going?
-Going to the can.

493
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,264
-Want me to come with you?
-You kidding?

494
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,141
They're after Franko.

495
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:48,545
You trying to get us all hung?

496
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:52,103
We're all dead anyway. Don't tell me
you believe that creep Reisman.

497
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:55,982
Want that slick bum to make suckers
out of you? Whose side are you on?

498
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:03,701
What's with you?

499
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:07,428
What is this, anyway?
Uncle Tom week?

500
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,783
You come with me, we're home free.

501
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,186
He doesn't give a damn about you.

502
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,948
If we go on that mission, we all
get killed. That's what they want!

503
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:29,066
Those idiots in there are gonna get shot,
and they're not even due for hanging.

504
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:33,107
You, you slob, you slob.
What do you think you got coming?

505
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:05,351
-Slipped on a bar of soap, huh?
-Yeah.

506
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:10,152
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

507
00:39:10,673 --> 00:39:13,870
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

508
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:15,711
Come on, Jiminez. Move it.

509
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:16,902
When the time comes. . .

510
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:20,110
. . .you've got exactly 34 seconds
to clear that distance.

511
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,552
I really can't make it, major.

512
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:25,665
Oh, come on, Jiminez.
Move it. Don't stop now.

513
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,192
I can't! I can't!

514
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:30,067
-Come on, Jiminez. Move.
-I really can't.

515
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:33,187
I can't make it, major.
I can't make it! I can't make it!

516
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:37,830
Jiminez! You come back down that rope,
you're going straight back to prison.

517
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:41,389
I can't. I can't!
Really, I can't.

518
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,586
Sergeant, give me that weapon.
Take a spin on that rope.

519
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:49,906
I can't make it. I can't make it!
I can't!

520
00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:53,825
I really can't make it, major.
I can't!

521
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,588
Boy, look at him go now!

522
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:09,350
So you couldn't make it, huh?

523
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,553
Okay, Posey, let's see a little
of that Apache know-how.

524
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:15,705
Re-thread that pulley and get another
rope down here. Come on!

525
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:18,942
Give these other characters
a crack at immortality.

526
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:23,112
You said Mayonnaise was the only one
supposed to get on top of that chateau.

527
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:28,142
But suppose Jiminez gets killed before
he gets to the top of that chateau.

528
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,869
-Come on, Posey. Move it.
-Come on, get that thing up here.

529
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:34,268
We'll have it ready in a minute, major.

530
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:38,464
All right, Franko, you're next.

531
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,104
All right, so much for hygiene
on the field.

532
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,309
Now, which one of you guys would
like to stick this in the major?

533
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:59,264
Well, major, if it's gonna
help the war effort. . . .

534
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,264
Franko, sit down.
You'll get your chance.

535
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,386
Well, let's see. . . .

536
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:06,712
-Posey.
-Me?

537
00:41:06,913 --> 00:41:08,187
Yeah, step out here.

538
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:09,587
I'd rather not, sir.

539
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:12,705
Look, Posey, it's just an example.
Come on, now. Step out here.

540
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:14,626
Now, will you hold this knife?

541
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:18,553
Posey, it's got a scabbard on it.
It can't hurt anybody.

542
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:26,307
Tell me, Posey,
what did they lock you up for?

543
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:28,225
I mean, what did you do?

544
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:30,392
I already told you that, sir.

545
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:32,470
Well, tell me again.

546
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:35,352
I'm sure that your friends
over here would like to know too.

547
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:37,987
-What'd you do, Posey?
-Yeah, fill him in.

548
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:43,270
This fella kept pushing me.
I don't like to be pushed, so I hit him.

549
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:46,466
Killed a man with your bare hands
because he shoved you?

550
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:49,551
I only hit him once.

551
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:52,150
Only hit him once.

552
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:56,466
And drove his jawbone right through
his brain because he pushed him.

553
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:00,382
-I didn't mean to kill him.
-You didn't mean to kill him, but you did.

554
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:03,909
Now, what would you do if you meant
to kill somebody? Could you do it?

555
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:09,143
If you had to kill somebody with a knife,
do you think you could do it?

556
00:42:09,353 --> 00:42:11,105
-Come on. Tell me.
-I'd rather not.

557
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:13,184
I don't care what you'd rather do.

558
00:42:13,393 --> 00:42:16,226
Come on, stick that knife in me.
You can do that. Come on.

559
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:18,346
Major, I don't want to do this.

560
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:21,346
Come on, Posey. Just stick it
right here in me, it won't hurt.

561
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:22,548
Come on.

562
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:25,551
-I don't want to hurt you.
-You're not. I'm gonna hurt you.

563
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:27,709
-Posey, stick me.
-I don't want no trouble.

564
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:30,671
You got no trouble. I'll give you
all the trouble you'll get.

565
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,950
Come on, now, Posey. Just stick
that knife right there, right there.

566
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:35,347
You're a big boy.

567
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:37,822
You killed a man for shoving you?
I'm shoving you.

568
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,228
-Come on. Let me have it.
-Stick him!

569
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:44,068
I'm talking to you. Give it to me or I'm
gonna shove you right through the wall!

570
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:46,305
Come on, Posey. Give it to him!

571
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,549
-Stab him!
-Get him, Posey! Come on, Posey!

572
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:54,029
I want that knife.
Why won't you give it to me?

573
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:56,832
-I don't like to be shoved, major.
-You're being shoved!

574
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:01,663
-Stick him!
-Knock him down, Posey!

575
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,744
Posey. What a name for a guy like you.

576
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:05,392
-Stop!
-Don't tell me what to do.

577
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:07,464
-I'm giving orders.
-I don't like pushing.

578
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,589
Give it to him, Pose! Come on!

579
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,186
I don't like to be shoved.

580
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:15,509
Stop pushing!

581
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:25,669
Posey. Posey!

582
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:30,185
-Posey.
-Yes, sir?

583
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:32,066
Are you all right?

584
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:34,787
Yeah.

585
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:37,032
All right, now. Relax.

586
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:39,871
Come on, get up.

587
00:43:43,873 --> 00:43:46,831
You know, you learn how to take care
of that temper of yours. . .

588
00:43:46,993 --> 00:43:49,382
. . .ain't nobody gonna take
this knife away from you.

589
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,821
You're right. I'm sorry.

590
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:53,024
Okay, major. We're all set.

591
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:56,268
All right, you go in
and see Captain Kinder.

592
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:59,306
-What's he gonna do?
-He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.

593
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:02,906
-Brush yourself off and go on in.
-Yes, sir.

594
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:07,747
All right, which
of you gentlemen is next?

595
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:10,189
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.

596
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:14,222
All right, Maggott. You're next.

597
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,348
Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.

598
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,422
They're looking good.

599
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:27,869
Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget
what they're getting in shape for.

600
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:34,631
Captain Kinder figures
maybe he can teach me letters.

601
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:36,988
Folks back home would be proud
if I could write.

602
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:40,544
Well, that would put you way ahead
of most of the guys around here.

603
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,583
-Better fall in and join them.
-Yes, sir.

604
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:46,348
It's true that I've been blessed. . .

605
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:49,704
. . .with an insight into women
that others don't have.

606
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:53,986
And sometimes. . . .
Well, sometimes I'm called upon. . .

607
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:56,189
. . .to use it in our beloved master's will.

608
00:44:56,753 --> 00:45:00,223
If women are your special province, why
do you hate Major Reisman so much?

609
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:06,149
There are 11 evil men out there. . .

610
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:11,148
. . .and they must be punished
for their wickedness.

611
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:13,668
And this Major Reisman,
he just snatched them up. . .

612
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:17,428
. . .from the brink of the pit, and he
cheated the master of his vengeance.

613
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:20,391
And you think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?

614
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:25,225
Oh, he will, captain. He will.
And Major Reisman too.

615
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:28,391
-So, what does that give you?
-It doesn't give me anything.

616
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:31,107
But along with these other results,
it gives you. . .

617
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:35,147
. . .about the most twisted, anti-social
bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.

618
00:45:35,593 --> 00:45:38,949
And the worst, the most dangerous
of the bunch is Maggott.

619
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:43,585
You've got one religious maniac,
one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots. . . .

620
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:45,909
And the rest, I don't even want
to think about.

621
00:45:46,073 --> 00:45:48,382
Well, I can't think of a better way
to fight a war.

622
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:52,023
The results of these tests
point to the fact that each man. . .

623
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:56,863
. . .has a built-in resentment against
any kind of authority. Any kind.

624
00:45:57,513 --> 00:45:59,788
-Don't you?
-But this is different.

625
00:45:59,953 --> 00:46:02,831
These guys think the U.S. Army
is their enemy, not the Germans.

626
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,426
Well, they know the U.S. Army.

627
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:07,263
But the Krauts haven't done
anything to them yet.

628
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,872
Very sophisticated.

629
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,349
Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.

630
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:16,711
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is. . .

631
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:18,545
. . .you are their main enemy.

632
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:21,307
And when the time comes,
you'll be the number one target.

633
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,902
Well, at least it gives them
something in common.

634
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:25,102
What do you mean?

635
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:28,828
They've come a long way individually,
further than we have a right to expect.

636
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:30,949
But not as a unit. Not as a group.

637
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:33,991
They've gotta function as a team.
And that's what's lacking.

638
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:36,343
You think putting them
on guard duty will help?

639
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:38,788
Well, it might give them
a sense of participation.

640
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,790
Why don't you let me weed out
the real morons? Especially Maggott.

641
00:46:43,993 --> 00:46:47,906
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
And I didn't pick the assignment either.

642
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:51,423
This is one time the Army's going
with a starting lineup all the way.

643
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,544
-Including Maggott?
-Including Maggott.

644
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:56,068
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

645
00:46:58,033 --> 00:47:01,389
-We could get ourselves hurt, right?
-Why don't you shut up, huh?

646
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,942
What's the matter?
You planning to save your mother?

647
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:05,302
Why don't you lay off?

648
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:07,344
Want me to show you
how to do it, huh?

649
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:09,426
All right.

650
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:14,582
Take my arm, put it around your neck.
Very simple, right?

651
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:16,988
And then it's all in the leverage.

652
00:47:18,593 --> 00:47:21,153
Better learn how to fall.
You'll end up in a wheelchair.

653
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:22,792
That's what I tried to tell him.

654
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:25,513
Trouble is you just don't know
how to fall right. Here.

655
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,149
Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.

656
00:47:28,353 --> 00:47:31,902
Kind of rough on the little fella,
aren't you? Like to try that with me?

657
00:47:40,953 --> 00:47:42,511
Now, this is really quite simple.

658
00:47:42,713 --> 00:47:45,102
I'm going to say a word,
and you come back at me. . .

659
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:47,548
. . .as fast as you can
with whatever comes to mind.

660
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:51,542
For instance, if I were to say
"happiness," you might say "children. "

661
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:53,345
I wouldn't say that.

662
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:56,272
Well, that was just an example.

663
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:58,469
But if I said "ambition,"
what would you say?

664
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,471
I wouldn't say anything.

665
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,381
Well, let's give it a try, okay?

666
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:09,829
-Weapon.
-Baseball.

667
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:12,467
-Knife.
-Dodgers.

668
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:15,184
-Officer.
-Pitcher.

669
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,706
You seem to be thinking about
just one thing, aren't you?

670
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:23,387
Yeah. What are you thinking about?

671
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,151
Well, you see, I don't want you
to think of just one thing.

672
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:31,948
I'd like for you to concentrate
on each word I throw at you. Okay?

673
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:34,627
Okay.

674
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,187
Food.

675
00:48:37,593 --> 00:48:38,946
Cincinnati.

676
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:43,351
-Comfort.
-Chicago.

677
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:47,468
-Now, what made you say that?
-That's what I was thinking about.

678
00:48:58,513 --> 00:49:00,105
The hell with it!

679
00:49:00,393 --> 00:49:02,065
Franko, what is it this time?

680
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,343
How am I supposed to shave
in cold water?!

681
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:07,465
You're in the field now.
Where are you gonna get hot water?

682
00:49:07,673 --> 00:49:09,664
The guards got hot water!
You got hot water!

683
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,505
-You're in the field!
-That's tough.

684
00:49:11,713 --> 00:49:14,147
Right. How come you guys have
hot water and we don't?

685
00:49:14,313 --> 00:49:16,622
You keep quiet!
You keep your big mouth shut.

686
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,672
-We ain't shaving in cold water!
-Not if all you don't.

687
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,706
You want us to shave in cold water?
Why don't you?

688
00:49:22,913 --> 00:49:24,141
-That's right.
-Yeah!

689
00:49:24,353 --> 00:49:26,184
Franko means it.

690
00:49:26,393 --> 00:49:29,066
We ain't shaving. We ain't washing.
Not in cold water!

691
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,552
-Is that right?
-That's right!

692
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:32,544
The guards got hot, we won't use cold.

693
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:33,822
And you can't make us!

694
00:49:33,993 --> 00:49:36,712
You're gonna get yourself
into hot water, Franko.

695
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:38,984
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hang us?

696
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:41,463
What can they do?
They can't do nothing!

697
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:44,147
-Nothing.
-Now what are you gonna do?

698
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:50,070
You know, I think Franko
might be right this time.

699
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:53,066
Yeah, shaving in cold water
won't make us any better soldiers.

700
00:49:54,153 --> 00:49:56,428
Excuse me, sir.
We got some trouble outside.

701
00:49:56,873 --> 00:49:59,182
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.

702
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:08,342
-All right, sergeant. Fall them in.
-Yes, sir.

703
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:10,623
All right, fall in. On your feet!

704
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:13,065
Come on, right over here, Posey!

705
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,429
Come on! Dress it up there. Get in line!

706
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:20,465
What's this about refusing to shave?
Who is refusing to shave?

707
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:22,152
-We are!
-Who is we?

708
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:23,462
We!

709
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:27,510
All those refusing to shave,
take one step forward.

710
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:51,623
So you want to stink, huh?

711
00:50:52,513 --> 00:50:54,231
And maybe itch too?

712
00:50:54,473 --> 00:50:57,431
Well, that's okay with me
because I don't have to smell you.

713
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,745
Sergeant, there will be no further
issue of shaving equipment. . .

714
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:01,902
. . .or the use of soap.

715
00:51:02,113 --> 00:51:04,263
And there will be no more hot meals.

716
00:51:04,673 --> 00:51:05,662
Just K rations.

717
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:08,943
Courtesy of Mr. Franko.

718
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:16,982
At ease.

719
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:22,748
-Hey, I really think we got something.
-Yeah, it's what the Navy calls "mutiny. "

720
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,462
No, no. Remember what I was saying
last night about 12 rugged individualists?

721
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:27,622
So?

722
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:31,782
You heard them. It was "we ain't gonna
do this and we ain't gonna do that. "

723
00:51:31,953 --> 00:51:34,342
When I asked them to step forward,
even Posey joined.

724
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:37,551
I'll bet you he's been shaving
in cold water since he was a kid.

725
00:51:38,113 --> 00:51:39,751
Boy, do I love that Franko.

726
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:44,947
That means that we are going to have
that much more time for work.

727
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:46,782
Right?

728
00:51:47,753 --> 00:51:50,631
So now, if you. . . .

729
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:54,428
You "dirty dozen" have no objections. . .

730
00:51:55,953 --> 00:51:57,989
. . .we will get our equipment. . .

731
00:51:58,473 --> 00:52:02,148
. . .and we will start in right now.

732
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:06,265
Attention!

733
00:52:11,353 --> 00:52:13,548
Ready, hut!

734
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,944
That's very good.

735
00:52:17,273 --> 00:52:20,231
You look just like real soldiers.

736
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,067
Fall out!

737
00:52:23,513 --> 00:52:25,231
Now, move it!

738
00:52:26,553 --> 00:52:29,989
You're still the dirtiest soldiers
in this man's army. . .

739
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:32,703
. . .and you're getting
filthier every day.

740
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:35,463
But your training is almost over.

741
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,711
In two days, you'll be learning
how to jump with a parachute. . .

742
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:41,067
. . .and you'll learn quick.

743
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:44,632
This training will take place
at a regular Army base.

744
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:49,350
And I just want to remind you
that this operation is secret.

745
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:51,191
Top secret.

746
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:55,588
You will not be wearing dog tags.
You will not say anything to anyone.

747
00:52:55,793 --> 00:52:57,943
Do you understand? Nothing.
Nothing!

748
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:01,546
One word, one slip
from any one of you. . .

749
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,903
. . .and the deal is off!

750
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:06,190
And you all know what that means,
right?

751
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,466
All right, serve it up.

752
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,266
All right, serve it up!

753
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:18,025
Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy bit.
He'll want to know.

754
00:53:18,193 --> 00:53:21,310
-We're still top-priority, aren't we?
-You can't ignore his author--

755
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,583
-Do we have the juice?
-Yes, but Colonel Br--

756
00:53:23,753 --> 00:53:26,392
Then I don't care
what Colonel Breed likes.

757
00:53:26,793 --> 00:53:29,626
Look, you're supposed to be
the liaison officer.

758
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,108
I want you to get orders
to the highest echelon. . .

759
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:34,503
. . .stating to Colonel Everett
Dasher Breed. . .

760
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:38,461
. . .that a group, over which he will have
no authority, will be arriving Tuesday. . .

761
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:42,831
. . .and the identity of the men is secret.
Tell him we got a general with them. . .

762
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:47,584
. . .tell him anything you want, just get
that West Point bum off of my back.

763
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,832
A general, huh?

764
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:52,272
I'll see what I can do.

765
00:53:52,873 --> 00:53:55,307
-I know you will.
-Hey, Franko. What is it, man?

766
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:57,782
-What kind of food is that?
-Pig face, serve it up!

767
00:53:57,953 --> 00:53:59,386
What is it?

768
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,667
I don't know. I never ate
anything like this before.

769
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:05,512
I've stepped in it a couple of times,
but I never ate it.

770
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:06,662
What is it?

771
00:54:10,673 --> 00:54:12,231
Did you ask what general?

772
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:13,985
Yes, sir. Got the same thing again.

773
00:54:14,193 --> 00:54:16,707
No information beyond
what was in the order.

774
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:19,427
What about General Denton?

775
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:23,262
When we first called, his extension
was busy. Now he's not there.

776
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:38,352
Not now.

777
00:54:47,113 --> 00:54:49,388
-Well, what about you?
-Nothing, sir.

778
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,746
Not now, you. . . .

779
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:23,786
I think they're coming.

780
00:55:23,993 --> 00:55:25,028
Yeah, it's them.

781
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:31,070
Yes? Sir, they just passed
the checkpoint.

782
00:55:31,273 --> 00:55:32,592
Let's go.

783
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:37,947
Now. Now!

784
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:52,388
Sounds like we're running
into a party.

785
00:55:53,313 --> 00:55:55,668
Boy, you don't suppose
it's for us, do you?

786
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,263
Present arms!

787
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:29,025
Major Reisman reporting, sir.

788
00:56:31,713 --> 00:56:32,782
Where's the general?

789
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:40,989
He's in the truck. But you understand
that he's traveling incognito.

790
00:56:43,713 --> 00:56:46,466
We thought he might care to inspect
our number one platoon.

791
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:50,468
If you give me a moment,
I'll see if he's willing to do that.

792
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:53,742
Order, halt!

793
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,346
How come the band?

794
00:56:57,913 --> 00:57:00,711
-What are we waiting for?
-They're inspecting the guest list.

795
00:57:00,873 --> 00:57:03,182
-What guest list?
-What's the matter with you?

796
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:07,825
Which one of you wants
to be a general?

797
00:57:07,993 --> 00:57:09,551
Be a what?

798
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:10,907
Pinkley.

799
00:57:12,713 --> 00:57:14,669
What? What kind of a general, sir?

800
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:18,748
Just a plain ordinary, everyday,
home-loving American general.

801
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:20,591
I'd rather be a civilian, sir.

802
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:25,702
What do I have to do?

803
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:29,588
You've seen generals inspecting troops.
Just walk slow and act stupid.

804
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:32,705
Up one rank, down the other,
and straight back to the truck.

805
00:57:33,113 --> 00:57:36,389
They're expecting a general,
and that's exactly what they'll get.

806
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:37,906
So let's go.

807
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:43,426
-Move it. Come on, move it!
-Ten-hut!

808
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,629
Present arms!

809
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,027
Move it.
Let's go, move it.

810
00:57:54,793 --> 00:57:55,782
Fall in!

811
00:57:58,753 --> 00:58:00,345
-Pinkley's gonna be a general.
-Why?

812
00:58:00,513 --> 00:58:02,344
-Pinkley's gonna be a general.
-What for?

813
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:03,502
Shut up and watch.

814
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:18,713
First Platoon waiting for inspection, sir!

815
00:58:47,553 --> 00:58:51,182
They're very pretty, colonel.
Very pretty.

816
00:58:51,393 --> 00:58:53,429
-But can they fight?
-Yes, sir.

817
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,112
I hope you're right.

818
00:58:59,473 --> 00:59:03,148
-Where are you from, son?
-Madison City, Missouri, sir.

819
00:59:05,753 --> 00:59:06,822
Never heard of it.

820
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:14,144
All right, major, let's go. We got
work to do. Thank you, colonel.

821
00:59:26,393 --> 00:59:27,872
Hold it down. Hold it down.

822
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,392
You pull a stunt like that again,
I'll beat your brains out.

823
00:59:35,553 --> 00:59:36,952
Major, you d--

824
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:41,911
Sergeant, fall them into a column
of twos, then move out.

825
00:59:42,073 --> 00:59:46,464
Yes, sir. Fall out. Fall into column
of twos on me. Fall out!

826
01:00:06,513 --> 01:00:08,105
Reisman!

827
01:00:11,033 --> 01:00:14,309
Some people may consider you
a first-class officer.

828
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:19,304
But as far as I'm concerned, you're
a disorganized, undisciplined clown.

829
01:00:19,513 --> 01:00:22,346
I'm gonna make it my business
to run you out of this Army.

830
01:00:22,553 --> 01:00:24,544
I owe you an apology, colonel.

831
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:28,792
I always thought that you were a cold,
unimaginative, tight-lipped officer.

832
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:33,783
But you're really quite emotional,
aren't you?

833
01:00:39,713 --> 01:00:41,590
Clayton, Blake.

834
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:50,623
-Hey, watch it.
-Look out, will you?

835
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:52,625
-Hey, hold this.
-All right, let's go!

836
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:56,303
-Do you believe this guy?
-Okay, all right, we're coming!

837
01:00:58,073 --> 01:00:59,870
Come on, let's go!

838
01:01:11,393 --> 01:01:12,906
You're in the way.

839
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:16,670
What's the matter with you guys?

840
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,192
-Listen, buster.
-Hands off!

841
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:19,342
Now, take it easy.

842
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,471
-Just want to ask you a few questions.
-Questions, huh?

843
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:28,952
Hold him! Hold him!

844
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:33,785
You son of a. . . .

845
01:01:34,313 --> 01:01:35,905
In the gut, so it don't show.

846
01:01:37,873 --> 01:01:39,192
That's the way!

847
01:01:43,153 --> 01:01:45,109
Talk, you bastard.
Who the hell are you?

848
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:49,748
-Number Nine, you crumb.
-Number Nine?

849
01:01:49,913 --> 01:01:52,507
-You gonna tell us or not?
-Go to hell.

850
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:54,708
Hold him.

851
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,704
Where the hell are your dog tags?

852
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:02,873
-I ate them.
-You ate them?

853
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:06,346
-You gonna tell us now?
-Yeah.

854
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,312
Yeah.

855
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:12,711
-Number Nine!
-Wladislaw!

856
01:02:38,233 --> 01:02:39,461
What happened?

857
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:44,264
They tried to make me talk.

858
01:02:54,873 --> 01:02:56,431
Where the hell have you been?

859
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:59,592
-Wait. What happened to him?
-He slipped on a bar of soap.

860
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:01,431
Everybody's slipping on soap.

861
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:03,390
Of all the miserable. . . .

862
01:03:05,273 --> 01:03:06,752
-Who?
-Who? Reisman.

863
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:08,710
He had a couple
of those paras jump him.

864
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:11,143
-Major did this?
-Gave him a pretty hard time.

865
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:13,184
-Well?
-Well, what?

866
01:03:13,393 --> 01:03:14,872
Did he tell them anything?

867
01:03:15,513 --> 01:03:16,582
Are you crazy?

868
01:03:16,953 --> 01:03:18,705
Three wise men.

869
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:22,343
"Trust your major. "
I'd rather trust Hitler.

870
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:27,188
-All right, move it out.
-Come on, move it! Move it!

871
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,793
You'll find this easier
than our jump-tower training.

872
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:39,547
Action stations!

873
01:03:41,873 --> 01:03:42,862
Go!

874
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:23,622
Morgan.

875
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,063
-Yes, sir.
-They should be here any minute now.

876
01:04:26,273 --> 01:04:28,389
Get the men together.
I'll talk to them first.

877
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:30,663
-We'll use your hut tonight.
-Our hut?

878
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,822
Your hut.

879
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,388
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

880
01:04:34,553 --> 01:04:35,986
All right, lke and Mike.

881
01:04:36,153 --> 01:04:39,509
Come on, get on your feet.
Come on, let's go.

882
01:04:39,673 --> 01:04:40,662
Move it!

883
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:43,184
What are you, the Gold Dust Twins?

884
01:04:46,793 --> 01:04:48,590
What, you need a special invitation?

885
01:04:48,753 --> 01:04:49,742
-No, sir.
-No, sir?

886
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:51,790
-I mean, yes, sir.
-Then move it.

887
01:04:54,553 --> 01:04:57,909
That's TS, Greek.
Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?

888
01:04:59,393 --> 01:05:02,385
All right, you foul-ups, come on!
Get over to the MP hut.

889
01:05:02,593 --> 01:05:05,061
The man wants to talk to you.
Come on, move it!

890
01:05:05,273 --> 01:05:06,706
All right.

891
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:08,342
Stop pushing.

892
01:05:09,593 --> 01:05:12,153
Come on, off it now. Let's get going!

893
01:05:13,393 --> 01:05:15,588
So this is how the other half lives.

894
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,511
Get going!

895
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:20,063
Hey, we're not going
to the junior prom.

896
01:05:20,273 --> 01:05:23,106
-Pretty sweet, huh?
-No dancing. Come on, let's go!

897
01:05:25,793 --> 01:05:27,704
-They got electricity.
-Nice to be rich.

898
01:05:27,913 --> 01:05:30,143
-Hey, what does he want to see us for?
-A radio.

899
01:05:30,353 --> 01:05:32,150
-A radio?
-Hey, look at those pictures.

900
01:05:32,313 --> 01:05:33,746
Maybe the guards are lonesome.

901
01:05:33,953 --> 01:05:36,831
-Horny bunch of mothers.
-Wow!

902
01:05:39,553 --> 01:05:41,783
All right, give them
a little air, boys.

903
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:44,425
Move it, Jiminez.

904
01:05:55,513 --> 01:05:56,992
Okay, sarge.

905
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:26,909
Well, jump school didn't kill you.
Maybe that stuff will.

906
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,270
Your training's about over
and I figure that entitles you. . .

907
01:06:30,473 --> 01:06:34,671
. . .to a graduation ball or something.
You have cups and glasses.

908
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:38,832
All right, wheel them in.

909
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:55,069
Shall I say they're
with your compliments?

910
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:57,428
Hell, no.
Tell them it's part of their training.

911
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:58,582
Yes, sir.

912
01:06:58,793 --> 01:07:00,021
Where are we?

913
01:07:00,193 --> 01:07:02,946
Oh! Somebody in this truck
has a cold nose.

914
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,825
Get off me foot!

915
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:07,422
Watch yourself, baby.

916
01:07:08,113 --> 01:07:10,263
-Have you hurt yourself?
-It's a limey barrack!

917
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,583
I'm not one for orgies meself.

918
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:15,785
-Should've asked for more money.
-Bitch.

919
01:07:16,273 --> 01:07:18,787
You sadists!

920
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,668
-Good evening.
-I'm already too worn out to work.

921
01:07:23,313 --> 01:07:25,588
-Right this way, ladies.
-Move along. That's nice.

922
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:27,192
Good evening, major.

923
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:33,144
I could only get eight, sir. It's like cops.
If you want one, you can't find them.

924
01:07:33,313 --> 01:07:35,747
-Good evening, ladies.
-Good evening, admiral.

925
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:42,913
Blimey, they're filthy!

926
01:07:43,073 --> 01:07:45,906
They may be, lady,
but they sure do mean well.

927
01:07:46,113 --> 01:07:47,592
Hey!

928
01:07:47,953 --> 01:07:50,626
All present and accounted for, major.

929
01:07:54,073 --> 01:07:57,622
You gentlemen will be on duty again
at 0600 hours in the morning.

930
01:07:57,953 --> 01:08:00,148
That's, oddly enough, the same
amount of time. . .

931
01:08:00,313 --> 01:08:03,191
. . .that these young ladies have allotted
to be your guests.

932
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:08,070
In the meantime, I suggest that
you use that time to get acquainted.

933
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:11,347
I don't believe that Mr. Maggott
would care to indulge. . .

934
01:08:11,553 --> 01:08:14,943
. . .so I suggest you save some whiskey
for him when he gets off of duty.

935
01:08:15,313 --> 01:08:16,985
Good night, gentlemen. Ladies.

936
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,945
Good night, colonel.

937
01:08:21,553 --> 01:08:24,113
-Are you crazy?
-Let's go. We might inhibit them.

938
01:08:24,913 --> 01:08:27,381
-You want to bet?
-Major!

939
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:30,027
Yes, you, Major Reisman!

940
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:32,827
I saw those filthy strumpets!

941
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:36,503
You're turning this place
into a bottomless pit of vice!

942
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:39,267
Comes Judgment Day!

943
01:08:39,473 --> 01:08:42,112
And Judgment Day is coming!

944
01:08:43,073 --> 01:08:45,951
Those men, major, they'll suffer
eternal damnation. . .

945
01:08:46,113 --> 01:08:47,592
. . .because of you, major!

946
01:08:47,793 --> 01:08:50,910
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

947
01:08:51,113 --> 01:08:53,229
You're on guard duty, Maggott.

948
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:13,301
Want to dance?

949
01:10:13,513 --> 01:10:15,185
There's no music.

950
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:17,352
Try humming.

951
01:10:22,873 --> 01:10:25,341
All right, girls,
you want to lose those wraps?

952
01:10:26,593 --> 01:10:28,823
-Put on that radio.
-Make yourself at home.

953
01:10:29,953 --> 01:10:32,751
You think those guys realize
tomorrow's Mother's Day?

954
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:34,262
Is it?

955
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,599
Now they're doing it to music.

956
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,847
-This is a restricted area, sir.
-I know that.

957
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:05,482
Two groups, three ranks in.

958
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:06,724
Open the gate.

959
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,442
Come on, let's move it!

960
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:10,287
Open this gate.

961
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:11,804
Yes, sir.

962
01:11:16,129 --> 01:11:17,403
Hey, look at those guys.

963
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:20,120
You can't come in here, sir!

964
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:22,604
Sergeant, take his weapon.

965
01:11:23,289 --> 01:11:24,642
Take his weapon.

966
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:29,844
Corporal Morgan. Sergeant, get that
rabble in some kind of order.

967
01:11:30,049 --> 01:11:32,005
Yes, sir. Commander, man to man!

968
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:34,598
Sir, you are contravening
a direct order.

969
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:35,924
Contravening nothing!

970
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:39,042
Fall in with the rest and
speak when you're spoken to.

971
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:41,604
You heard what the colonel said.
Fall in!

972
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:43,528
Come on, move it!

973
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:47,325
All right, you heard what he said.
Fall in!

974
01:11:47,489 --> 01:11:50,287
Come on, come on!
Let's get the lead out.

975
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:52,122
What's he all upset about?

976
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:55,122
All right, you bunch of foul-ups.
Come on. Grab a formation.

977
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:58,207
Fall in there!
Come on, you yard birds!

978
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:00,599
You believe this Army?
We gotta be losing.

979
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:03,602
Move it! What's wrong with you?
You got lead in them?

980
01:12:04,129 --> 01:12:05,528
Come on, get going!

981
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:09,085
Hey, ain't those the jokers that
roughed you up in the latrine?

982
01:12:09,289 --> 01:12:10,688
Come on!

983
01:12:11,009 --> 01:12:12,203
Hey, come on, pick it up!

984
01:12:13,249 --> 01:12:15,888
Yeah, we had Reisman all wrong.

985
01:12:16,049 --> 01:12:18,882
-Come on, move it!
-Not now. Wait for it.

986
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:22,367
What's going on up there?

987
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:24,764
Hey, you!
What are you, something special?

988
01:12:24,969 --> 01:12:28,006
We gotta wait all day for you?
Come on!

989
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:32,685
Get in position there.
Let's try and make a straight line.

990
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,441
Let's look like soldiers, huh?

991
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:41,239
I told you nobody could pass.
Now, open the gate. Let's get going.

992
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:48,526
Those are the two guys
that got Wladislaw.

993
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:52,481
Those are the two guys that
gave Wladislaw his lumps.

994
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:55,797
Those are the two guys
that jumped Wladislaw.

995
01:12:56,529 --> 01:12:58,884
Those are the two guys
that banged Wladislaw.

996
01:12:59,089 --> 01:13:01,808
Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.

997
01:13:02,889 --> 01:13:04,527
Those are the two guys--

998
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:24,082
In my opinion. . .

999
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:28,284
. . .the officer in command
of this operation. . .

1000
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:33,005
. . .has either disregarded his orders
or is flagrantly disobeying them. . .

1001
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:35,002
. . .one way or the other.

1002
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:37,763
And that is what I am here to find out.

1003
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,602
All right. . .

1004
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:46,044
. . .gentlemen,
let's understand each other.

1005
01:13:47,329 --> 01:13:50,048
I'm here to find out exactly
what this is all about. . .

1006
01:13:50,209 --> 01:13:53,565
. . .and I intend to do it
if it takes all day.

1007
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:57,720
Now, you can make it easy or tough
on yourself. That's up to you.

1008
01:13:59,249 --> 01:14:03,640
Before I leave, we're going to find
out who's involved in this insanity. . .

1009
01:14:04,129 --> 01:14:06,848
. . .what you're doing here and why.

1010
01:14:07,969 --> 01:14:09,561
Is that understood?

1011
01:14:11,649 --> 01:14:13,241
All right, general.

1012
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:19,765
What's your name, rank
and serial number?

1013
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:21,442
You tell him, we've all had it!

1014
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:23,167
Quiet!

1015
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:27,685
What's your name, soldier?

1016
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:30,244
Number Two, sir.

1017
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:37,161
Morgan. Clayton.

1018
01:14:37,929 --> 01:14:39,157
Yes, sir?

1019
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,245
Give Clayton this man's name, rank
and serial number. For all of them.

1020
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:46,321
-I really don't know that, sir.
-Then tell him what you do know.

1021
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:48,042
You fink, you tell him nothing!

1022
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:51,161
-What was that talk down there?
-Nothing, sir.

1023
01:14:52,729 --> 01:14:54,321
Come here, soldier.

1024
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:11,448
When did you bathe last?

1025
01:15:13,169 --> 01:15:15,558
-I don't remember, sir.
-You're filthy.

1026
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,525
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

1027
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:20,840
Sergeant Fredericks,
get a razor and water.

1028
01:15:21,129 --> 01:15:25,008
He will demonstrate proper procedure
for shaving and bathing in the field.

1029
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:27,080
-Yes, sir.
-Right, soldier?

1030
01:15:27,249 --> 01:15:28,682
No, sir!

1031
01:15:29,249 --> 01:15:30,284
No, sir, what?

1032
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:33,566
No, sir, I am not going to shave, sir!

1033
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:38,047
Then we'll have to do it the hard way.
Clayton, Blake, dry-shave him.

1034
01:15:39,049 --> 01:15:40,038
Now!

1035
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,399
-Reisman!
-That's right!

1036
01:15:56,929 --> 01:15:59,727
You be good enough to have your
men dispose of their weapons!

1037
01:15:59,929 --> 01:16:02,523
-Sergeant Bowren!
-Sir!

1038
01:16:02,769 --> 01:16:05,920
Get some special help
and get those weapons!

1039
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,882
Yes, sir.
All right, you heard the man!

1040
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:10,317
Now, get moving!

1041
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,406
Hit them only where it hurts.

1042
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:16,085
-Turn it loose!
-That's great.

1043
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:18,484
Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.

1044
01:16:18,689 --> 01:16:20,202
You Nazi!

1045
01:16:39,049 --> 01:16:40,846
I'm with you, major, all the way.

1046
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,158
Don't call us, we'll call you.

1047
01:16:50,849 --> 01:16:52,760
You must be out of your mind.

1048
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:54,766
It might seem that way.

1049
01:16:59,329 --> 01:17:02,401
Take it all back, colonel.
They aren't pretty and they can't fight.

1050
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:03,724
They're all 4-Fs!

1051
01:17:03,889 --> 01:17:06,767
Hey, colonel, I hear they
don't even use parachutes!

1052
01:17:11,969 --> 01:17:13,880
Hey, colonel, you crybaby!

1053
01:17:15,569 --> 01:17:17,480
Don't just stand there, pick it up!

1054
01:17:17,649 --> 01:17:20,163
-Stick around for tea.
-Put some money in there.

1055
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,768
Come again, colonel!

1056
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:24,358
Stop by any time, bozo.

1057
01:17:26,289 --> 01:17:29,964
I'm sure you look upon your service
record as being highly colorful, major.

1058
01:17:30,129 --> 01:17:32,085
Well, that's not my view of it.

1059
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,886
I think you know I was never in favor
of you leading this operation.

1060
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:38,722
So I can't say that I'm disappointed
in your performance.

1061
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:42,638
Because the impression you made on
me was unfavorable in the first place.

1062
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:45,957
You behave as if this
were a personal matter.

1063
01:17:46,569 --> 01:17:48,287
Let me assure you, it isn't.

1064
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:51,561
What happens to you is something
to which I am indifferent.

1065
01:17:51,769 --> 01:17:54,442
But the nature of the operation
I am running is not.

1066
01:17:55,329 --> 01:17:58,127
Colonel Breed's report
on your unit's level of achievement. . .

1067
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:01,964
. . .and general behavior at the parachute
training school is entirely negative.

1068
01:18:02,129 --> 01:18:04,245
It would in itself justify
my recommendation. . .

1069
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:06,206
. . .that this operation be canceled.

1070
01:18:07,169 --> 01:18:09,478
Your men will be sent back
for execution of sentence.

1071
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:13,602
Whether disciplinary action
should be taken against you. . .

1072
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:15,606
. . .is a matter for General Worden here.

1073
01:18:16,289 --> 01:18:19,281
I take it you don't deny your
responsibility for the fact that. . .

1074
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:23,408
. . .on the night of April 14-15, a military
establishment of the U.S. Army. . .

1075
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:25,321
. . .was the scene of a drunken party. . .

1076
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:28,839
. . .at which no less than seven
female civilians took an active part.

1077
01:18:29,009 --> 01:18:31,728
Oh, yes, sir, they took
an active part all right.

1078
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:34,642
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1079
01:18:35,409 --> 01:18:38,799
Are you in a position to offer even
the remotest mitigating circumstances?

1080
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:41,358
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, sergeant, more ice.

1081
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:42,604
Yes, sir.

1082
01:18:43,209 --> 01:18:44,198
Well?

1083
01:18:44,849 --> 01:18:48,364
You offered those men a chance to get
off the hook, and they worked hard.

1084
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:52,323
Now that they're just shaping up, you're
gonna say, "Sorry, the deal's off"?

1085
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:56,199
You've only yourself to blame for that.
You brought those women to camp.

1086
01:18:56,409 --> 01:18:57,808
So I broke an Army regulation.

1087
01:18:57,969 --> 01:19:00,881
You're gonna kill five men
and send the rest to prison for life?

1088
01:19:01,049 --> 01:19:03,040
Because if you did that. . .

1089
01:19:03,249 --> 01:19:06,878
. . .you'd have to lock up half
the U.S. Army, officers included.

1090
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:09,119
Anyway, you said it yourself,
it was my fault.

1091
01:19:09,289 --> 01:19:11,564
It's not gonna affect their ability
as soldiers.

1092
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:15,199
Yes, well, we've heard about their
ability as soldiers from Colonel Breed.

1093
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:16,922
That's his opinion.

1094
01:19:17,129 --> 01:19:20,963
My men have crammed six months of
intensive training into as many weeks.

1095
01:19:21,169 --> 01:19:24,320
As of this moment, I'd stack them
up against any men in the Army.

1096
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,242
You can't be serious.

1097
01:19:26,449 --> 01:19:28,917
You're damn right I am!
They might not be pretty. . .

1098
01:19:29,129 --> 01:19:31,404
. . .but any one of mine
is worth 10 of yours.

1099
01:19:31,609 --> 01:19:34,681
-Those comparisons are hardly the point.
-It's precisely the point.

1100
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:38,404
My contention is that my men are more
than able to handle any job given them.

1101
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:42,120
Now, you gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.

1102
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:45,008
At least you can let them
show you what they're capable of.

1103
01:19:45,169 --> 01:19:47,399
I shudder to think
what they might be capable of.

1104
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:51,244
Give them a chance to prove it, then
if they fail, your conscience is clear.

1105
01:19:52,049 --> 01:19:53,607
Tell me, major. . .

1106
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:57,526
. . .just how would you
have your men prove it?

1107
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:01,368
It can't be done, can it?

1108
01:20:08,249 --> 01:20:10,365
Well, yes. I suppose it could.

1109
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:13,041
I mean, there might be a way.

1110
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:16,359
What I mean is,
general, if you recall. . .

1111
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:19,168
. . .next week we've got divisional
maneuvers in Devonshire.

1112
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:20,484
Yes, yes, yes.

1113
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:23,840
Colonel Breed's outfit will be
part of that exercise.

1114
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:27,002
As a matter of fact,
one of his companies. . .

1115
01:20:27,209 --> 01:20:31,088
. . .has been assigned the defense
of divisional headquarters.

1116
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:32,278
So?

1117
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,688
So. . . .

1118
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:40,599
So you let my 12 men act
as an independent unit. . .

1119
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:42,845
. . .attached to the opposing force.

1120
01:20:44,209 --> 01:20:47,679
And they'll knock out Breed's
headquarters and capture his entire staff.

1121
01:20:49,809 --> 01:20:51,083
That I'd like to see.

1122
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:53,246
So would I.

1123
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:19,241
Charlie and Fox Companies will support
the back of the woods.

1124
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:21,565
They'll need supplies
from the 2nd Battalion.

1125
01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:24,448
Rogers won't like that,
but I don't want to hear about it.

1126
01:21:24,609 --> 01:21:26,759
-Yes, sir.
-How's Johnson's armor?

1127
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:30,120
They just ran through two minutes ago,
sir. The armor's all set.

1128
01:21:38,169 --> 01:21:39,158
Hold it!

1129
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,723
Back!

1130
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:46,678
Change!

1131
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:07,360
You think we're gonna
get away with this?

1132
01:22:07,809 --> 01:22:12,041
Smile, you idiots! If those blue
slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.

1133
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:33,321
Can you believe it?
They shaved.

1134
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:35,286
How about that?

1135
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:38,482
Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.

1136
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:41,806
-The day go fast, major?
-You're beautiful, but you're late.

1137
01:22:42,009 --> 01:22:43,965
-Got everything you need?
-Absolutely.

1138
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:46,160
Think you can remember the plan?

1139
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:48,804
-So where'd you get the vehicle?
-We stole it.

1140
01:22:49,009 --> 01:22:51,318
Like we're gonna steal
everything else.

1141
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:54,049
We're playing war games, right?
Anything else, sir?

1142
01:22:54,209 --> 01:22:57,724
I guess not. All right, we'll be
with the generals at headquarters.

1143
01:22:57,929 --> 01:23:00,762
From now on, you're on your own.
So take off and good luck.

1144
01:23:01,169 --> 01:23:02,602
Let's move!

1145
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:06,520
All right, split up into three groups.

1146
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:21,960
These two belong to you?

1147
01:23:37,329 --> 01:23:38,648
Where's General Worden?

1148
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:41,124
Well, he's gone to check up
in the field, sir.

1149
01:23:42,369 --> 01:23:44,007
Oh, my God.

1150
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:54,402
-Well?
-Be with you in a minute, sir.

1151
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:02,763
-Well, how about this one?
-Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.

1152
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:07,804
Oh, that's excellent,
Haskell, excellent!

1153
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:09,923
Come on, let's go.

1154
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:29,080
-We made it.
-Where are the others?

1155
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:32,047
8:45. Four of them ought to be
coming over that ridge soon.

1156
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:34,843
0845? They'd better
be coming fast then.

1157
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:38,638
The enemy is gonna lay a live barrage on
that ridge at 0850. Did you know that?

1158
01:24:38,849 --> 01:24:40,202
Yes, sir, I knew that.

1159
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:43,640
But that's the one direction Colonel
Breed won't be looking for them.

1160
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:48,677
-Are they all set?
-All set, sir.

1161
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:52,245
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

1162
01:24:52,449 --> 01:24:56,124
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

1163
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:57,802
Batteries one, three and four--

1164
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:02,201
Ready!

1165
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:03,842
Aim!

1166
01:25:04,049 --> 01:25:05,084
Fire!

1167
01:25:11,809 --> 01:25:12,878
Come on!

1168
01:25:13,089 --> 01:25:15,398
Let's go! Come on!

1169
01:25:29,929 --> 01:25:31,487
Load!

1170
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:34,678
Now, come on!

1171
01:25:34,849 --> 01:25:37,568
-While they're reloading!
-Let's go!

1172
01:25:39,329 --> 01:25:42,002
-Down! Can't you hear it?!
-Hit it!

1173
01:25:59,329 --> 01:26:00,648
Secure guards!

1174
01:26:00,849 --> 01:26:02,805
All right, let's go!

1175
01:26:09,489 --> 01:26:10,524
Let's go.

1176
01:26:17,929 --> 01:26:20,045
Now, what the hell were you
guys waiting for?

1177
01:26:20,249 --> 01:26:23,639
What do you m--?
Mean, boy?

1178
01:26:25,209 --> 01:26:28,406
Those lovers were trying
to kill us back there.

1179
01:26:30,369 --> 01:26:31,802
Change.

1180
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,249
Change? What do you mean, "change"?

1181
01:26:35,969 --> 01:26:37,004
You can't do that!

1182
01:26:37,209 --> 01:26:40,201
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.

1183
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:42,606
They can't stop us now.

1184
01:26:43,089 --> 01:26:44,363
Let's go.

1185
01:26:44,889 --> 01:26:46,527
Come on.

1186
01:26:47,529 --> 01:26:48,518
We're on our way.

1187
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:01,038
We get across this road, take 10.

1188
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:11,161
What are we waiting here for?

1189
01:27:11,569 --> 01:27:14,083
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun
and four men.

1190
01:27:17,089 --> 01:27:18,204
Like this one?

1191
01:27:18,969 --> 01:27:19,958
Slow down.

1192
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:22,048
Ten-hut!

1193
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:30,888
Good afternoon, general.

1194
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:41,847
The Mafia has landed!

1195
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:44,085
-Whatever Franko says, Franko does!
-Machine gun.

1196
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:45,927
Let's get it out. Move it out.

1197
01:27:46,129 --> 01:27:47,960
-Come on, snap it up.
-Franko, out!

1198
01:27:48,489 --> 01:27:50,366
Out? What do you mean, "out"?

1199
01:27:50,529 --> 01:27:53,407
-Who do you think stole this thing?
-You did, my boy.

1200
01:27:53,889 --> 01:27:57,962
Look, you and Pinkley are the only guys
that Colonel Breed got a good look at.

1201
01:27:58,209 --> 01:28:01,087
This operation is a big enough risk
without you coming along.

1202
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:03,444
-Out.
-Come on, Franko.

1203
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:07,727
Jefferson, you have until 0930
to show up with the ambulance.

1204
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:10,045
You don't make it,
I'll figure you got nailed.

1205
01:28:10,209 --> 01:28:12,359
-Then we'll take a whack at plan B.
-Right.

1206
01:28:13,449 --> 01:28:15,121
So long, major.

1207
01:28:17,769 --> 01:28:19,964
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.

1208
01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:24,325
Attention!

1209
01:28:25,649 --> 01:28:27,128
Attention.

1210
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:29,998
Ten-hut!

1211
01:28:32,609 --> 01:28:34,839
-Morning, Breed.
-Morning. Quite a surprise.

1212
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:37,887
-Everything under control?
-I think you could say that, sir.

1213
01:28:38,049 --> 01:28:40,802
Good, good.
At ease, gentlemen, at ease.

1214
01:28:41,009 --> 01:28:44,160
Just thought I'd drop by to see
how things are shaping up.

1215
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,804
So this is what it looks like, huh?

1216
01:28:51,809 --> 01:28:53,686
Come on, push!

1217
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:59,643
-Posey, remember, you're hurt.
-Oh, I'm dying.

1218
01:28:59,849 --> 01:29:00,964
Come on, Maggott.

1219
01:29:03,329 --> 01:29:04,842
Stand back, now.

1220
01:29:14,609 --> 01:29:16,645
-What's that?
-Over there!

1221
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:21,880
-What was that?
-Down the road, sir. See that smoke?

1222
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:24,882
-Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
-Yes, sir.

1223
01:29:25,089 --> 01:29:28,240
-What are they doing around that ridge?
-I don't know, sir.

1224
01:29:28,449 --> 01:29:31,725
That should've been cleared
half an hour ago.

1225
01:29:31,929 --> 01:29:35,080
Now, colonel, it sure doesn't look like
it's been cleared, does it?

1226
01:29:35,249 --> 01:29:36,238
Let's go.

1227
01:29:40,929 --> 01:29:44,285
-Posey, remember, you're injured.
-Gilpin, you forgot the ketchup.

1228
01:29:44,449 --> 01:29:46,280
-Help!
-Come on.

1229
01:30:01,849 --> 01:30:03,441
Sir?

1230
01:30:06,049 --> 01:30:08,927
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like to call an ambulance.

1231
01:30:09,089 --> 01:30:10,966
Call an ambulance.
Go see what happened.

1232
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:13,848
-Yes, sir. Come on, you two.
-Private?

1233
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:16,165
-Come here.
-Yes, sir.

1234
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,961
What were you doing on that road?

1235
01:30:18,169 --> 01:30:20,285
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.

1236
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:25,083
I didn't ask you that. I asked you
what you were doing on that road.

1237
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:27,319
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.

1238
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,044
Let's see that map.

1239
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:34,688
Move Able, Charlie Company to. . .

1240
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:36,686
. . .the bridge under smoke screen.

1241
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,928
Baker Company bank towards
the ridge at 1420 hours.

1242
01:30:41,089 --> 01:30:44,286
-Private. Come here.
-Yes, sir.

1243
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:47,842
What's your name and outfit?

1244
01:30:48,049 --> 01:30:49,448
Private Matthew Donald, sir.

1245
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:54,439
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.

1246
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:57,527
-Where are your orders?
-Right here, sir.

1247
01:30:59,089 --> 01:31:01,239
From Captain Thornhill, sir.

1248
01:31:04,129 --> 01:31:06,848
I know most of the men
under my command.

1249
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,960
But I don't recall seeing you before.

1250
01:31:10,329 --> 01:31:13,127
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.

1251
01:31:17,169 --> 01:31:21,048
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.

1252
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:22,722
-Where's Peterson?
-Here it comes!

1253
01:31:27,169 --> 01:31:28,761
Clear the way!

1254
01:31:29,169 --> 01:31:30,522
Looks like somebody got hurt.

1255
01:31:33,569 --> 01:31:35,082
Watch it there!

1256
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:38,678
Okay, let's have some help
with this soldier.

1257
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:43,281
Count of three, lift. One, two, lift.

1258
01:31:44,609 --> 01:31:46,042
Take it easy now.

1259
01:31:48,409 --> 01:31:51,162
-Where do we put him, sir?
-Put him there.

1260
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:57,279
-You can stay, but keep out of the way.
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1261
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:27,877
Sorry, but this is the end
of the line for you.

1262
01:32:28,089 --> 01:32:30,159
But we got a bad accident
down here, sir.

1263
01:32:30,369 --> 01:32:34,123
That's too bad, because you just
became prisoners of war.

1264
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,163
It's the enemy, sir!

1265
01:32:39,449 --> 01:32:41,201
All right, come on, let's go.

1266
01:32:42,529 --> 01:32:44,201
Let's go, let's go.

1267
01:32:46,249 --> 01:32:47,841
They can't do that.

1268
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:52,041
You're wearing Red Force insignia.

1269
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:54,799
That's right. We're traitors.

1270
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,403
-Watch my finger.
-They use real bullets, you idiot!

1271
01:32:57,609 --> 01:32:59,361
Now, look here, I'm a doctor, major.

1272
01:32:59,569 --> 01:33:01,764
And I'm a major, captain.

1273
01:33:01,969 --> 01:33:05,405
Yes, sir, but we had a radio message.
There's a man badly hurt down there.

1274
01:33:05,569 --> 01:33:06,558
Hurry it up!

1275
01:33:06,769 --> 01:33:09,408
Here's our permission to cross
all lines and roadblocks.

1276
01:33:10,009 --> 01:33:13,319
Very cute idea, captain.
But it won't work. Get out.

1277
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:17,284
But it's not a gag, sir.
There's a real casualty there.

1278
01:33:17,489 --> 01:33:18,842
All set back here, Jefferson.

1279
01:33:19,049 --> 01:33:21,244
Sir, will you explain
the rules to him?

1280
01:33:21,449 --> 01:33:22,484
The man may be dying.

1281
01:33:22,689 --> 01:33:25,203
I'm just an observer, captain,
not an umpire.

1282
01:33:25,409 --> 01:33:27,877
I can't interfere
or make any rulings.

1283
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:30,758
Come on, doc,
I've got a sick tree back here.

1284
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:32,561
Come on, you too.

1285
01:33:32,769 --> 01:33:35,966
She's blond, she's engaged.
Come on, sugar!

1286
01:33:36,169 --> 01:33:39,161
-Got your bracelet right here.
-What's the matter?

1287
01:33:39,329 --> 01:33:41,763
Come on, Little Red Riding Hood.

1288
01:33:42,889 --> 01:33:44,527
You're really gonna enjoy this.

1289
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:48,921
How about this patient, huh, doc?

1290
01:33:49,849 --> 01:33:51,999
You're really gonna enjoy it here, doc.

1291
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:53,682
Come on, men. What about 0930?

1292
01:33:53,889 --> 01:33:56,608
All right, take out the blue bands.
Let's go!

1293
01:33:56,809 --> 01:33:58,208
Change to the blue armband!

1294
01:33:58,369 --> 01:33:59,484
What about the prisoners?

1295
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:03,159
Sorry, major. We can't spare any men
to look after prisoners.

1296
01:34:03,729 --> 01:34:04,957
You coming?

1297
01:34:23,289 --> 01:34:25,723
-Is he trying to kill us?
-We must be going 120.

1298
01:34:25,929 --> 01:34:27,760
He's gonna squash us
in this sardine can.

1299
01:34:27,969 --> 01:34:30,324
You want to be there by 0930,
don't you?

1300
01:34:30,489 --> 01:34:31,968
Yeah.

1301
01:34:32,329 --> 01:34:36,242
--pulling back the map reference,
397492.

1302
01:34:36,449 --> 01:34:37,723
That's Blue Force crew.

1303
01:34:38,649 --> 01:34:41,641
Call in company orders and hit them
when they reach crossroads.

1304
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:42,998
Hello, Able 3.

1305
01:34:43,209 --> 01:34:45,882
Don't worry, Bill. They called
for the ambulance.

1306
01:34:59,249 --> 01:35:02,047
-It's gonna be all right.
-Yes, it will.

1307
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:05,241
It's gonna be all right.

1308
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:09,203
I want a strike on Hill 80
between them at 1400 hours.

1309
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:12,406
Move them up to the base of the hill
and keep their heads down.

1310
01:35:12,609 --> 01:35:17,080
Well, thanks very much, colonel.
It's been very instructive.

1311
01:35:17,249 --> 01:35:20,321
I think I'll take a little ride now
and get the overall picture.

1312
01:35:20,529 --> 01:35:22,201
Yes, sir, thank you.

1313
01:35:32,249 --> 01:35:34,046
Move it over. Give them room.

1314
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:16,088
Forward observation report.
Blue Force tanks approaching. . .

1315
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:18,046
. . .airfield at map reference--

1316
01:36:19,209 --> 01:36:20,528
Out of the way!

1317
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:23,968
Out of the way!

1318
01:36:29,129 --> 01:36:30,767
Come on.
Watch out for the ambulance!

1319
01:36:39,649 --> 01:36:42,402
There he is. The old man.

1320
01:36:46,449 --> 01:36:47,962
Come on, observers!

1321
01:36:58,369 --> 01:37:00,200
Major Reisman's compliments, sir.

1322
01:37:08,529 --> 01:37:12,966
Hey, major. What do you think
about that one, major?

1323
01:37:13,129 --> 01:37:16,758
I didn't wanna tell you before because
I thought it might make you nervous.

1324
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:19,966
After our last little party,
the generals were all in favor. . .

1325
01:37:20,169 --> 01:37:22,364
. . .of sending you back to finish
your sentences.

1326
01:37:22,569 --> 01:37:24,446
-Or get hung.
-Or get hung.

1327
01:37:24,609 --> 01:37:25,598
Or get hung.

1328
01:37:26,089 --> 01:37:27,920
But I made a deal with them.

1329
01:37:28,289 --> 01:37:32,168
Knocking off Breed's headquarters
is what got you guys off the hook.

1330
01:37:36,129 --> 01:37:38,120
You weren't really worried,
were you, major?

1331
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:39,921
No, not much, he wasn't.

1332
01:37:40,129 --> 01:37:42,279
But we still have
one operation to go.

1333
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:46,846
If you guys foul up on this one, none
of us will ever play the violin again.

1334
01:37:47,049 --> 01:37:49,199
Because up until now,
it's all been a game.

1335
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:51,883
But as of tomorrow night,
it's gonna be the real thing.

1336
01:37:52,089 --> 01:37:54,080
If you want to know how real,
I'll tell you.

1337
01:37:54,289 --> 01:37:57,247
It's my guess the lot of you guys
won't be coming back.

1338
01:37:57,409 --> 01:37:59,445
But there's no sense in squawking
about that.

1339
01:37:59,609 --> 01:38:01,247
Because the Army never did love you.

1340
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:03,206
Besides, you all volunteered, right?

1341
01:38:03,409 --> 01:38:06,048
-Yeah.
-Well, that's more than I did.

1342
01:38:06,929 --> 01:38:08,442
Sergeant Bowren.

1343
01:38:09,249 --> 01:38:11,717
Look, I know we've been over this
a thousand times. . .

1344
01:38:11,889 --> 01:38:14,687
. . .but a lot can go wrong.
We gotta be prepared to improvise.

1345
01:38:14,849 --> 01:38:17,727
So let's see what happens
if everything goes right. Ready?

1346
01:38:17,929 --> 01:38:20,602
-One.
-At the roadblock, we've just begun.

1347
01:38:20,809 --> 01:38:24,165
-One.
-At the roadblock, we've just begun.

1348
01:38:24,369 --> 01:38:26,564
-Two.
-The guards are through.

1349
01:38:26,769 --> 01:38:29,761
-Three.
-The major's men are on a spree.

1350
01:38:29,969 --> 01:38:32,961
-Four.
-Major and Wladislaw through the door.

1351
01:38:33,169 --> 01:38:36,525
-Five.
-Pinkley stays out in the drive.

1352
01:38:36,729 --> 01:38:39,960
-Six.
-The major gives the rope a fix.

1353
01:38:40,169 --> 01:38:43,241
-Seven.
-Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.

1354
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:47,325
-Eight.
-Jiminez has got a date.

1355
01:38:47,809 --> 01:38:51,324
-Nine.
-The other guys go up the line.

1356
01:38:52,089 --> 01:38:55,525
-Ten.
-Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.

1357
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,880
-Eleven.
-Posey guards points five and seven.

1358
01:38:59,529 --> 01:39:03,317
-Twelve.
-Wladislaw and major go down to delve.

1359
01:39:03,849 --> 01:39:04,998
And where's Donald Duck?

1360
01:39:05,929 --> 01:39:08,489
Donald Duck's down at the crossroads
with a machine gun.

1361
01:39:08,889 --> 01:39:11,528
And he'd better not be asleep,
or we'll all be in trouble.

1362
01:39:13,409 --> 01:39:16,924
-Thirteen.
-Franko goes up without being seen.

1363
01:39:17,569 --> 01:39:19,525
-Fourteen.
-Zero hour.

1364
01:39:19,809 --> 01:39:22,448
-And?
-Mayonnaise cuts the cable. . .

1365
01:39:22,609 --> 01:39:24,327
. . .Franko cuts the phone.

1366
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:26,087
-Fifteen.
-Franko goes in. . .

1367
01:39:26,249 --> 01:39:27,648
. . .where the others have been.

1368
01:39:28,049 --> 01:39:32,201
-Sixteen.
-We all come out like it's Halloween.

1369
01:39:33,729 --> 01:39:35,481
And kill every officer in sight.

1370
01:39:35,649 --> 01:39:37,002
Ours or theirs?

1371
01:39:37,169 --> 01:39:38,966
Well, let's start off with theirs, huh?

1372
01:39:39,169 --> 01:39:41,603
Let's take it again from the top,
without the ad-libs.

1373
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:45,279
-All right, one.
-Down the roadblock, we've just begun.

1374
01:39:45,489 --> 01:39:48,287
-Two.
-The guards are through.

1375
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:51,600
-Three.
-The major's men are on a spree.

1376
01:39:51,969 --> 01:39:54,358
-Fourteen.
-Zero hour.

1377
01:39:54,569 --> 01:39:57,322
-And?
-Mayonnaise cuts the cable. . .

1378
01:39:57,529 --> 01:39:59,167
. . .Franko cuts the phone.

1379
01:39:59,329 --> 01:40:01,206
-Fifteen.
-Franko goes in. . .

1380
01:40:01,369 --> 01:40:02,882
. . .where the others have been.

1381
01:40:03,329 --> 01:40:07,368
-Sixteen.
-We all come out like it's Halloween.

1382
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:09,400
Seventeen?

1383
01:40:09,569 --> 01:40:12,288
Seventeen. D-day.

1384
01:40:12,809 --> 01:40:15,528
We get out as best we can
and make our way to the coast.

1385
01:40:16,249 --> 01:40:19,798
And hope that the entire invasion
hasn't been a total disaster.

1386
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:22,204
Otherwise, we got a long swim home.

1387
01:40:22,769 --> 01:40:24,441
How much longer, major?

1388
01:40:24,609 --> 01:40:25,962
I'll ask the driver.

1389
01:40:32,689 --> 01:40:35,249
You're not worried about jumping
at night, are you?

1390
01:40:37,849 --> 01:40:39,282
Getting back.

1391
01:40:46,569 --> 01:40:47,558
Ready.

1392
01:40:52,289 --> 01:40:53,563
Cargo.

1393
01:41:04,449 --> 01:41:05,438
Go.

1394
01:41:20,289 --> 01:41:23,406
-Where have you been? We're late.
-We've been looking for Jiminez.

1395
01:41:23,729 --> 01:41:26,641
-And?
-We found him hung up in an apple tree.

1396
01:41:26,849 --> 01:41:29,488
-His neck's broken.
-You mean he's dead?

1397
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:31,839
That's exactly what I mean.

1398
01:41:34,049 --> 01:41:35,243
-This far.
-Yeah.

1399
01:41:38,049 --> 01:41:41,439
All right, Franko, now you know why
we all checked out on that rope, huh?

1400
01:41:45,049 --> 01:41:46,528
Gilpin, number eight.

1401
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:48,765
Gilpin, did you hear me?

1402
01:41:48,929 --> 01:41:51,397
-Eight.
-Gilpin's got a date?

1403
01:41:54,449 --> 01:41:56,440
-Fourteen.
-Zero hour.

1404
01:41:56,649 --> 01:41:58,799
-And?
-Gilpin cuts the cables. . .

1405
01:41:59,009 --> 01:42:01,284
-. . .Franko cuts the phone.
-Let's go.

1406
01:42:09,769 --> 01:42:13,284
-What a great way to start out, huh?
-Yeah.

1407
01:43:18,769 --> 01:43:20,566
So far, so good, major.

1408
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:24,041
Where are those guys?

1409
01:44:26,449 --> 01:44:27,848
Here they come.

1410
01:44:30,289 --> 01:44:31,722
Let's go.

1411
01:44:47,889 --> 01:44:49,720
Come on, Pinkley, let's go.

1412
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:26,328
It's just like the major
said it would be.

1413
01:45:26,649 --> 01:45:30,005
Yeah, really some spread, ain't it?

1414
01:45:31,769 --> 01:45:33,168
There they go now.

1415
01:45:52,769 --> 01:45:55,602
-No blackout?
-Think they're expecting us?

1416
01:45:55,769 --> 01:45:57,361
Hey, the silencer!

1417
01:47:08,289 --> 01:47:09,642
Let's go.

1418
01:48:04,849 --> 01:48:06,521
"Radio room. "

1419
01:48:25,209 --> 01:48:27,769
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

1420
01:48:30,889 --> 01:48:32,800
I don't know how many
Germans we'll kill. . .

1421
01:48:33,009 --> 01:48:35,125
. . .but we're gonna make
an awful lot of noise.

1422
01:48:36,689 --> 01:48:38,964
Hey, do you believe
in stuff like that?

1423
01:48:40,209 --> 01:48:42,165
Oh, I don't know, can't hurt nothing.

1424
01:48:43,249 --> 01:48:45,444
I don't think I believe
in stuff like that.

1425
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:44,599
-So, how's your German holding up?
-Oh, man, I don't know.

1426
01:49:44,769 --> 01:49:46,964
You know those two guys
walking down the stairs?

1427
01:49:47,129 --> 01:49:48,881
I couldn't understand
a word they said.

1428
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:52,047
-Just act mean and grunt, huh?
-Yeah.

1429
01:49:53,649 --> 01:49:55,401
Okay, Room 11.

1430
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:23,998
So?

1431
01:50:24,969 --> 01:50:27,403
You go first, I'll carry the bags.

1432
01:50:54,249 --> 01:50:55,887
We'll set it up here.

1433
01:51:37,609 --> 01:51:41,488
-They should've been here by now.
-Yeah.

1434
01:52:21,729 --> 01:52:23,367
Guard!

1435
01:52:41,769 --> 01:52:43,760
I left the rope.

1436
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:44,401
Hold it.

1437
01:53:57,489 --> 01:53:59,127
Idiot.

1438
01:54:01,769 --> 01:54:04,522
-Do it, Polack!
-Shut up.

1439
01:54:08,409 --> 01:54:09,728
Hurry up.

1440
01:54:47,809 --> 01:54:49,288
Now.

1441
01:54:51,409 --> 01:54:52,967
Now.

1442
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,241
Ready for the turkey shoot?

1443
01:56:10,529 --> 01:56:12,963
I wish I could read this.
I think it's dirty.

1444
01:57:53,209 --> 01:57:54,927
Hey! What are you doing?

1445
01:57:55,129 --> 01:57:58,485
Franko and the others
are still down there. Come on!

1446
01:58:36,889 --> 01:58:37,958
Hey, Maggott.

1447
01:58:38,169 --> 01:58:40,478
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of sight.

1448
02:00:06,329 --> 02:00:07,603
Wolfgang?

1449
02:00:09,329 --> 02:00:10,318
Wolfgang?

1450
02:00:13,649 --> 02:00:14,638
Wolfgang?

1451
02:01:43,849 --> 02:01:44,998
Scream.

1452
02:01:49,049 --> 02:01:50,368
Scream.

1453
02:01:51,769 --> 02:01:54,329
Scream, you slut.

1454
02:01:54,569 --> 02:01:56,605
Sprechen, you harlot.

1455
02:01:56,889 --> 02:01:58,163
Scream.

1456
02:02:21,129 --> 02:02:22,357
Radio room.

1457
02:03:35,729 --> 02:03:38,448
Blow it! Blow it!

1458
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:25,883
-Hey, what's going on?
-Shut up.

1459
02:05:37,449 --> 02:05:39,917
It's Judgment Day, you sinners.

1460
02:05:40,489 --> 02:05:41,842
Come out.

1461
02:05:42,489 --> 02:05:44,366
Come out, wherever you are.

1462
02:05:49,169 --> 02:05:51,160
Come out.

1463
02:05:51,609 --> 02:05:52,883
Come out.

1464
02:07:30,849 --> 02:07:31,838
Now!

1465
02:07:48,929 --> 02:07:51,727
-You didn't think about that, did you?
-They gotta breathe.

1466
02:08:21,289 --> 02:08:22,768
You got the grenades?

1467
02:08:23,849 --> 02:08:24,964
Right. Right, sir.

1468
02:08:25,569 --> 02:08:27,605
We got enough here
to blow up the world.

1469
02:08:44,769 --> 02:08:46,885
What are we gonna do about them?

1470
02:08:48,209 --> 02:08:50,325
We'll feed the French
and kill the Germans.

1471
02:08:52,729 --> 02:08:55,368
-Franko, cover that corner.
-What happened?

1472
02:08:55,529 --> 02:08:59,204
They're locked in the bunker. There's
gotta be some air vents. Take a look.

1473
02:08:59,409 --> 02:09:01,479
All right, bring your grenades!
Over here!

1474
02:09:01,689 --> 02:09:03,168
I'll take them.

1475
02:09:13,489 --> 02:09:14,842
Here they are.

1476
02:09:20,809 --> 02:09:22,288
Take it down there.

1477
02:09:24,129 --> 02:09:25,642
Bowren, get Vladek out here.

1478
02:09:28,529 --> 02:09:30,201
Where's that coming from?

1479
02:09:37,169 --> 02:09:38,568
Come on, Vladek, we need you.

1480
02:09:39,849 --> 02:09:41,441
Come on, come on.

1481
02:09:45,129 --> 02:09:48,599
Franko! Get over here and see
if you can start one of those trucks!

1482
02:10:06,329 --> 02:10:10,038
Wladislaw, Jefferson. Get the lids
off those other ventilators.

1483
02:10:14,969 --> 02:10:17,085
You know what you gotta do, so do it.
Hurry up!

1484
02:10:29,249 --> 02:10:31,160
All right, you Frenchies, beat it.

1485
02:10:51,649 --> 02:10:53,640
No, it's all right. It's all right. Go on.

1486
02:11:00,209 --> 02:11:02,086
Get back up there
and cover that bridge!

1487
02:11:04,569 --> 02:11:05,797
Move it!

1488
02:11:13,409 --> 02:11:14,637
Help Bowren!

1489
02:11:38,369 --> 02:11:39,722
There they are!

1490
02:11:58,809 --> 02:12:00,686
Hurry it up. Posey's got trouble!

1491
02:12:06,289 --> 02:12:08,598
Get one of those trucks started!

1492
02:12:17,969 --> 02:12:21,279
No, no, no. Leave the pins in.
The pins in, huh?

1493
02:12:47,529 --> 02:12:49,679
Bowren, get some gasoline.

1494
02:12:50,529 --> 02:12:52,042
Some gasoline?

1495
02:12:52,489 --> 02:12:53,478
Are you sure?

1496
02:12:54,049 --> 02:12:56,517
You want to ask Pinkley and Vladek?
Now, get going!

1497
02:12:58,889 --> 02:12:59,958
Yes, sir.

1498
02:13:32,769 --> 02:13:34,885
Sawyer, Lever, cover that bridge!

1499
02:13:35,169 --> 02:13:37,763
Do you believe these guys?
They keep these things locked.

1500
02:13:37,969 --> 02:13:39,402
Keep looking!

1501
02:13:46,769 --> 02:13:48,282
The other road! The other road!

1502
02:14:38,169 --> 02:14:40,444
Come on, baby.
Where are you, baby?

1503
02:14:57,729 --> 02:14:59,048
Let's go!

1504
02:15:02,489 --> 02:15:03,604
Move over.

1505
02:15:03,809 --> 02:15:05,401
Move over!

1506
02:15:06,129 --> 02:15:07,528
Wladislaw. . .

1507
02:15:07,729 --> 02:15:09,765
. . .get Vladek out of there, huh?

1508
02:15:45,249 --> 02:15:46,568
Another flare! Another flare!

1509
02:15:57,089 --> 02:15:58,408
Come on, you. . . .

1510
02:15:59,649 --> 02:16:02,004
Jefferson! When I give you the signal. . .

1511
02:16:02,169 --> 02:16:05,605
. . .set them off one, two, three, four,
and get the hell out of there.

1512
02:16:05,809 --> 02:16:07,606
We'll wait for you at the bridge.

1513
02:16:07,809 --> 02:16:09,083
-Right?
-Right.

1514
02:16:13,089 --> 02:16:14,158
Let's go!

1515
02:16:23,409 --> 02:16:25,798
Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry up!

1516
02:16:48,849 --> 02:16:50,123
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1517
02:16:50,329 --> 02:16:52,445
Jefferson, set them off!

1518
02:16:52,769 --> 02:16:55,488
Get that thing out of here
or we'll all go up!

1519
02:17:20,129 --> 02:17:21,403
Let's go.

1520
02:17:26,369 --> 02:17:27,961
They're not gonna make it.

1521
02:17:29,049 --> 02:17:31,961
We'll get a boat and get out
the other side. Come on, let's go.

1522
02:18:08,129 --> 02:18:10,040
All right, blow it!

1523
02:18:12,409 --> 02:18:15,560
Remember, Jefferson, 20 seconds!

1524
02:18:21,449 --> 02:18:22,928
Run!

1525
02:18:23,129 --> 02:18:24,721
-Faster, faster.
-Come on! Come on!

1526
02:18:24,929 --> 02:18:26,362
Jefferson faster.

1527
02:18:26,529 --> 02:18:29,407
Come on, Jefferson. Run!

1528
02:18:29,609 --> 02:18:30,678
-Go!
-Hurry up!

1529
02:18:30,849 --> 02:18:33,568
-Come on, move!
-Come on, come on.

1530
02:18:34,969 --> 02:18:37,437
-It's gonna blow!
-Come on!

1531
02:18:37,649 --> 02:18:39,241
Come on, Jefferson!

1532
02:18:41,009 --> 02:18:42,283
Jefferson!

1533
02:19:32,569 --> 02:19:33,763
Come on, start.

1534
02:19:35,049 --> 02:19:38,041
It won't start! It won't start!
The bastard won't start!

1535
02:19:51,689 --> 02:19:52,917
All right, get in!

1536
02:20:40,529 --> 02:20:42,997
Shift! Shift it, shift it!

1537
02:21:25,489 --> 02:21:26,842
We made it!

1538
02:21:27,009 --> 02:21:30,081
We made it. Those stupid bastards,
we made it!

1539
02:21:30,289 --> 02:21:31,483
Come on! Keep shooting!

1540
02:21:41,729 --> 02:21:43,287
Major!

1541
02:21:48,089 --> 02:21:51,001
Among the many reports of the raid
on the chateau near Rennes...

1542
02:21:51,169 --> 02:21:53,967
...perhaps the most objective
is the one by General Worden...

1543
02:21:54,129 --> 02:21:55,608
...in which he states:

1544
02:21:55,769 --> 02:21:58,567
"We are recommending that those
members of the group known...

1545
02:21:58,729 --> 02:22:01,197
...as 'The Dirty Dozen ' who survived
this operation...

1546
02:22:01,369 --> 02:22:03,678
...should have their records
amended to indicate...

1547
02:22:03,849 --> 02:22:07,080
... that they are being returned
to active duty at their former ranks.

1548
02:22:07,449 --> 02:22:11,158
And that the next of kin of those
prisoners who were killed be advised...

1549
02:22:11,329 --> 02:22:14,685
... that they lost their lives
in the line of duty. "

1550
02:22:15,009 --> 02:22:16,442
You did a fine job, major.

1551
02:22:19,089 --> 02:22:20,283
I'll see you around.

1552
02:22:20,929 --> 02:22:22,965
You did a good job, soldier.

1553
02:22:23,129 --> 02:22:25,802
Hurry up and get well.
We need men like you out there.

1554
02:22:39,929 --> 02:22:41,567
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

1555
02:22:41,729 --> 02:22:44,368
Killing generals could get to be
a habit with me.

in the line of duty.
