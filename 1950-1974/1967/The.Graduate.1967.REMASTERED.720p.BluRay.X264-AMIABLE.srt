1
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,240
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
to begin our descent into Los Angeles.

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,030
The sound you just heard is
the landing gear locking into place.

3
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,000
Los Angeles weather is clear.
Temperature is 72.

4
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,630
We expect to make our 4-hour
and 18-minute flight on schedule.

5
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,600
We have enjoyed having you on board,

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,260
and look forward to seeing
you again in the near future.

7
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,890
<i>Hello, darkness, my old friend</i>

8
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,930
- <i>I've come to talk with you again</i>
- Please hold handrail and stand to the right.

9
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,660
- If you wish to pass, please do so on the left.
- <i>Because a vision softly creeping</i>

10
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,780
<i>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</i>

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,080
<i>And the vision</i>

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,460
<i>That was planted in my brain</i>

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,770
<i>Still remains</i>

14
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,460
<i>Within the sound</i>

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,300
<i>Of silence</i>

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,430
<i>In restless dreams I walked alone</i>

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,810
<i>Narrow streets of cobblestone</i>

18
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,190
<i>'Neath the halo of a street lamp</i>

19
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,980
<i>I turned my collar to the cold and damp</i>

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,570
<i>When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of a neon light</i>

21
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,920
<i>That split the night</i>

22
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,830
<i>And touched the sound</i>

23
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,830
<i>Of silence</i>

24
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>And in the naked light I saw</i>

25
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,280
<i>10,000 people, maybe more</i>

26
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,510
<i>People talking without speaking</i>

27
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,850
<i>People hearing without listening</i>

28
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,940
<i>People writing songs</i>

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,650
<i>That voices never shared</i>

30
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,880
<i>No one dared</i>

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,610
<i>Disturb the sound</i>

32
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,830
<i>Of silence</i>

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>"Fools," said I, "You do not know</i>

34
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,500
<i>Silence like a cancer grows</i>

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>Hear my words that I might teach you</i>

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,130
<i>Take my arms that I might reach you"</i>

37
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,550
<i>But my words</i>

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,480
<i>Like silent raindrops fell</i>

39
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,740
- Please do not leave your car unattended.
- <i>Whispered</i>

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,900
<i>In the sounds</i>

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,760
<i>Of silence</i>

42
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,010
Hey, what's the matter?

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,140
The guests are all downstairs, Ben,
waiting to see you.

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,980
Look, Dad, could you explain to them
that I have to be alone for a while?

45
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,510
These are all our good friends, Ben.

46
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,050
Most of them have known you since...

47
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,150
Well, practically since you were born.
What is it, Ben?

48
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm just...

49
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,330
Worried?

50
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,120
Well...

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,290
About what?

52
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,170
I guess about my future.

53
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,010
What about it?

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,090
I don't know.

55
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,930
I want it to be...

56
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,970
To be what?

57
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,020
Different.

58
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,800
Is anything wrong?

59
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,050
No, no. We're just on our way downstairs.

60
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,900
The Carlsons are here.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,390
They are? Well, come on.

62
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,700
They came all the way from Tarzana.

63
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,310
Come on, let's get cracking.

64
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,700
It's a wonderful thing
to have so many devoted friends.

65
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,230
Hey, there's the award-winning scholar.

66
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,900
- We're all very proud of you, Ben.
- Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,860
Is that the new car out there?
That little red wop job?

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,110
That's Ben's graduation present.

69
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,120
Well, you won't have much trouble
picking up in that, will you?

70
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,160
- Sir?
- The girls, the chicks, the teenyboppers.

71
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,120
Oh, I think Ben's gotten beyond
the teenybopper stage, haven't you, Ben?

72
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,180
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,880
Excuse me. I think I'd just like to check
something on the car for a minute.

74
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,770
His father bought him an Alfa Romeo.
You know what that is?

75
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,550
Hey, here's the track star.
How are you, track star?

76
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,800
Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

77
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,930
I wanna get a drink, then I wanna
hear all about that thing you won,

78
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,220
that Hopperman Award.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,060
- Halpingham.
- Halpingham. Right.

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,580
You wait right here.

81
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,370
Ben.

82
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,990
We're all so proud of you.

83
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,960
Oh, proud, proud, proud,
proud, proud, proud.

84
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,950
What are you going to do now?

85
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,080
I was going to go upstairs for a minute.

86
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,660
- I meant with your future.
- Your life.

87
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,370
Well, that's a little hard to say.

88
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,850
- Ben.
- Excuse me.

89
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,430
Mr. McGuire.

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,250
Ben.

91
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,690
Mr. McGuire.

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,430
Come with me for a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

93
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,010
- Excuse us, Joanne.
- Of course.

94
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,570
MR. McGUIRE: Thank you.

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,530
- He is such a lamb.
- Congratulations, Ben.

96
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,350
I look at him, and I can't believe it.

97
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,120
I simply can't believe it.

98
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,620
I just wanna say one word to you.

99
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,380
Just one word.

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,950
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,280
- Are you listening?
- Yes, I am.

102
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,720
Plastics.

103
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,660
Exactly how do you mean?

104
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,170
There's a great future in plastics.

105
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,580
Think about it.

106
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,040
- Will you think about it?
- Yes, I will.

107
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,600
Enough said. That's a deal.

108
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,690
Here he is now. Here's Ben.

109
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,980
Excuse me just a minute.

110
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,350
Listen, everybody.
I want you all to be quiet.

111
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,390
I've got Ben's college yearbook here,

112
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,060
and I just want to read you
some of the wonderful things about Ben.

113
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,540
Be quiet, please!

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,320
"Captain of the cross-country team,
head of the debating club,

115
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,910
"associate editor of the college newspaper
in his junior year,

116
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,090
"managing editor in his senior..."

117
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,590
Oh, I guess this isn't
the bathroom, is it?

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
It's down the hall.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,780
How are you, Benjamin?

120
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,490
Fine, thank you, Mrs. Robinson.

121
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,180
The bathroom's
down at the end of the hall.

122
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,390
Such a pleasant room.

123
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,670
Look. Mrs. Robinson,

124
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,300
I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm awfully...

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,110
Is there an ashtray in here?

126
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,260
No.

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,070
Oh, yes, I forgot...
The track star doesn't smoke.

128
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,960
Is it a girl?

129
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,580
Is what a girl?

130
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,860
Whatever it is that's upsetting you.

131
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,800
Oh, no, I'm just sort of disturbed
about things.

132
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,640
- In general?
- That's right.

133
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,980
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

134
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,650
Oh, Benjamin.

135
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,480
- I want to ask you something.
- What?

136
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,350
- Will you take me home?
- What?

137
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,820
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

138
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,950
Here, you take it.

139
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,540
Do you know how to work a foreign shift?

140
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,670
- You don't?
- No.

141
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,300
Let's go.

142
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,950
- Thank you.
- Right.

143
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,140
- Will you come in, please?
- What?

144
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,580
I'd like you to come in
till I get the lights on.

145
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,710
What for?

146
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,440
'Cause I don't feel safe
till I get the lights on.

147
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,900
Would you mind walking
ahead of me to the sun porch?

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,610
I feel funny
about coming into a dark house.

149
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,340
- But it's light in there.
- Please.

150
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,640
What do you drink? Bourbon?

151
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,810
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I drove you home.

152
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,980
I was glad to do it,
but I have some things on my mind.

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
Can you understand that?

154
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,410
- Yes.
- All right.

155
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,790
What do you drink?

156
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,780
Benjamin, I'm sorry to be this way,

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,030
but I don't want to be left alone
in this house.

158
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,240
Why not?

159
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,220
Please wait till my husband gets home.

160
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
- When is he coming back?
- I don't know.

161
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,680
- Drink?
- No.

162
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,710
Are you always
this much afraid of being alone?

163
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,310
Yes.

164
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,280
Well, why can't you just lock
the doors and go to bed?

165
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,490
I'm very neurotic.

166
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,540
May I ask you a question?

167
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,380
What do you think of me?

168
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,530
What do you mean?

169
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,870
You've known me nearly all your life.

170
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,640
You must have formed some opinion of me.

171
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,600
Well, I always thought
that you were a very nice person.

172
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

173
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,260
What?

174
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,980
Did you know that?

175
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,700
Look, I think I should be going.

176
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,390
Sit down, Benjamin.

177
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,520
Mrs. Robinson,
if you don't mind my saying so,

178
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,850
this conversation
is getting a little strange.

179
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,360
Now, I'm sure that Mr. Robinson
will be here any minute now...

180
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,520
- No.
- What?

181
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,860
My husband will be back quite late.

182
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
He should be gone for several hours.

183
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,070
- Oh, my God.
- Pardon?

184
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,090
Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson. Oh, no.

185
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,740
What's wrong?

186
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,750
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't...
I mean, you didn't expect...

187
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,330
What?

188
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,170
I mean, you didn't really think
I'd do something like that.

189
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,230
- Like what?
- What do you think?

190
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,480
- Well, I don't know.
- For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson.

191
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,680
Here we are, you got me into your house,

192
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,600
you give me a drink, you put on music.

193
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
Now you start opening up
your personal life to me

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,980
and tell me your husband
won't be home for hours.

195
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,100
So?

196
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.

197
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,080
Aren't you?

198
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,110
Well, no, I hadn't thought of it.

199
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,400
I feel very flattered.

200
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,050
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me
for what I just said?

201
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,620
- It's all right.
- It's not all right.

202
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,300
- It's the worst thing I ever said to anyone.
- Sit down.

203
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,890
Please forgive me because I like you.

204
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,040
I don't think of you that way,
but I'm mixed-up.

205
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,630
It's all right. Finish your drink.

206
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,550
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
that I said that to you.

207
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,460
Well, forget it right now.
Finish your drink.

208
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,300
What is wrong with me?

209
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,440
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

210
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,390
Her portrait?

211
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,140
- Yes.
- No.

212
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,150
We had it done last Christmas.
Would you like to see it?

213
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,500
Very much.

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,920
It's here in Elaine's room.

215
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,600
Elaine certainly is
an attractive girl, isn't she?

216
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,710
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

217
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,800
- Benjamin.
- Yes.

218
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,340
- Will you come over here a minute?
- Over there?

219
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,150
- Mmm-hmm.
- Sure.

220
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,310
Will you unzip my dress?
I think I'll go to bed.

221
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,690
Oh, well, good night.

222
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,850
- Won't you unzip my dress?
- I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

223
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,860
If you still think I'm
trying to seduce you...

224
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,690
No, I don't, but I just
feel a little funny.

225
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,360
- Benjamin, you've known me all your life.
- I know that, but I'm just...

226
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,380
Come on. It's hard for me to reach.

227
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,600
- Thank you.
- Right.

228
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,380
What are you so scared of?

229
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,040
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

230
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,840
Then why do you keep running away?

231
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,340
Because you're going to bed.
I don't think I should be up here.

232
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,720
Haven't you seen anybody in a slip before?

233
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,180
Yes, I have, but I just...

234
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,350
Look, what if Mr. Robinson
walked in right now?

235
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,520
What if he did?

236
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,520
Well, it would look pretty funny,
wouldn't it?

237
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,890
- Don't you think he trusts us together?
- Of course he does,

238
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,730
but he might get the wrong idea.
Anyone might.

239
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,070
I don't see why. I'm twice as old
as you are. How could anyone think...

240
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,900
But they would, don't you see?

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
Benjamin, I am not trying to seduce you.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,700
I know that, but please,
Mrs. Robinson, this is difficult...

243
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,830
- Would you like me to seduce you?
- What?

244
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,370
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

245
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,750
I'm going home now.
I apologize for what I said.

246
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,640
I hope you can forget it,
but I'm going home right now.

247
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,510
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

248
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,420
Will you bring up my purse before you go?

249
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,800
I have to go now. I'm sorry.

250
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,890
I really don't want to put this on again.
Won't you bring it up?

251
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,490
- Where is it?
- On the table in the hall.

252
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,860
- Mrs. Robinson?
- I'm in the bathroom.

253
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,120
- Well, here's the purse.
- Could you bring it up?

254
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,740
Well, I'll hand it to you.

255
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,570
Come to the railing, and I'll hand it up.

256
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,240
Benjamin, I'm getting
pretty tired of all the suspicion.

257
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,260
Now, if you won't do me a simple favor,
I don't know what.

258
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,910
I'm putting it on the top step.

259
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,330
For God's sake, Benjamin,

260
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,970
will you stop acting this way
and bring me the purse?

261
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,130
- I'm putting it here by the door.
- Will you bring it in to me?

262
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,760
I'd rather not.

263
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,140
All right. Put it in Elaine's room
where we were.

264
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,400
Right.

265
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,940
Oh, God.

266
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,150
Let me out.

267
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,320
- Don't be nervous.
- Get away from that door.

268
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,410
- I want to say something first.
- Jesus Christ.

269
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,490
Benjamin, I want you to know
that I'm available to you

270
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,700
and if you won't sleep
with me this time...

271
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,830
- Oh, my Christ.
- If you won't sleep with me this time,

272
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,080
I want you to know that
you can call me up any time you want,

273
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,790
and we'll make
some kind of an arrangement.

274
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,928
- Do you understand what I've said?
- Let me out.

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,500
- Benjamin, do you understand what...
- Yes, yes, let me out.

276
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,870
'Cause I find you very attractive.
And any time you want, you just...

277
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,230
Oh, Jesus, that's him.

278
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,150
- Is that Ben's car in front?
- Yes, sir.

279
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,400
I drove... I drove Mrs. Robinson home.

280
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,880
She wanted me to drive her home
so I drove her home.

281
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,970
Swell. I appreciate.

282
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,700
She's upstairs.

283
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,260
She wanted me to wait
down here till you got home.

284
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,290
Standing guard
over the old castle, are you?

285
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,640
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,230
Hey, congratulations.

287
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,690
Thank you.

288
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,610
- Hey, looks like you need a refill.
- Oh, no, I've got to go.

289
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,260
Hey, is anything wrong?
You look a little shaken up.

290
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,530
Oh, no, no. I'm just a little worried
about my future.

291
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,290
I'm a little upset about my future.

292
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,730
All right, come on,
let's have a nightcap together.

293
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,790
- Scotch?
- Bourbon.

294
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,500
Ben...

295
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,680
How old are you now?

296
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,970
Twenty. I'll be 21 next week.

297
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,860
- That's a hell of a good age to be.
- Thank you.

298
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,870
Thank you very much, sir.

299
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,460
I... I wish I was that age again.

300
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,460
- Because, Ben...
- Sir?

301
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,430
- You'll never be young again.
- I know.

302
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,260
Ben, can I say something to you?

303
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,480
What?

304
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,150
How long have we known each other now?

305
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,370
How long have you and I known each other?

306
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,980
How long
have your dad and I been partners?

307
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,580
Quite a while.

308
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,420
- I watched you grow up, Ben.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,120
In many ways,
I feel as though you were my own son.

310
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,560
Thank you.

311
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,010
So I hope you won't mind

312
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,446
my giving you a friendly piece of advice.

313
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,200
I'd like to hear it.

314
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,780
Ben,

315
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,950
I think...

316
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,940
I think you ought to be taking it

317
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,250
a little easier right now
than you seem to be.

318
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,760
Sow a few wild oats.
Take things as they come.

319
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,180
Have a good time
with the girls and so forth.

320
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,140
Don't get up.

321
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,020
I was just telling...

322
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,750
- Ben.
- ...Ben here

323
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,880
that he ought to sow a few wild oats,
have a good time while he can.

324
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,150
- You think that's sound advice?
- Yes, I do.

325
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,530
I've got to go.

326
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,990
You have yourself
a few flings this summer.

327
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,110
I bet you're quite a ladies' man, huh?

328
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,830
- Oh, no.
- What?

329
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,380
You look to me like the kind of guy
who has to fight 'em off.

330
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,410
Now, doesn't he look to you like the kind
of guy who has to fight them off?

331
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,910
Yes, he does.

332
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,540
Oh, say, Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday.

333
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,580
Oh, yes.

334
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,180
- I want you to give her a call.
- I will.

335
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
Benjamin.

336
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,590
- Benjamin?
- Yes.

337
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,360
Thank you for taking me home.

338
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,278
I'll see you soon, I hope.

339
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please,

340
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,700
for this afternoon's feature attraction.

341
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,540
Hey, over there.

342
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,540
Yes, I mean you. Your attention, please.

343
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,610
Are you ready in there,
feature attraction?

344
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,450
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

345
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,990
Listen. Now I'm gonna ask
for a big round of applause

346
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,790
to bring this boy out here, all right?

347
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,460
Now, wait a minute. Oh, let me amend that.

348
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:43,594
To bring this young man out here,
because today he is 21 years old.

349
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,260
Yeah! Let's go! Our food is cold.

350
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,970
Oh, now, just hang on a minute.
I've got a few words to say.

351
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,320
- You always do.
- Look who's talking.

352
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,970
Dad, can we just talk
about this for a second?

353
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,810
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.

354
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,400
I'd like to discuss this.

355
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,980
This boy... I'm sorry, this young man,

356
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,330
is soon to continue his education
as a Frank Halpingham Award scholar.

357
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,700
But before he does...

358
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,630
Before he does...

359
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,750
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You're disappointing them.

360
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,930
- Dad, can you listen?
- Listen, I'll give you 10 seconds.

361
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,710
He is going to give us
a practical demonstration

362
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,730
of what I feel safe in saying
is a pretty exciting birthday present.

363
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,010
And it better work,
or I'm out over 200 bucks.

364
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,500
Okay, then, let's hear it now
for Benjamin Braddock!

365
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,230
Come on, Benjy! Come on, Benjy!

366
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,660
Let's hear it now! That a boy!

367
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,530
Well, folks, this remarkable young man

368
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,620
is going to perform for you some
spectacular and amazing feats of daring

369
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,540
in water that is over 6' deep.

370
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,870
Hello?

371
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,360
I don't quite know how to put this.

372
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Benjamin?

373
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,380
Look, I was thinking
about that time after the party.

374
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
Where are you?

375
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,760
And I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink or something.

376
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,180
Where are you?

377
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,270
- The Taft Hotel.
- Did you get a room?

378
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,940
No.

379
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,920
Now, I know it's pretty late,
and if you'd rather...

380
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,220
Give me an hour.

381
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,690
- What?
- I'll be there in an hour.

382
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,510
- Where's the party?
- It's in the main ballroom.

383
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,360
- The main ballroom.
- Just there.

384
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,310
Can I help you, sir?

385
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,580
What? Oh, no, I'm just...

386
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,580
Are you here for an affair, sir?

387
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,660
What?

388
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,280
The Singleman party, sir?

389
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,120
Oh, yes. The Singleman party.

390
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,350
- It's in the main ballroom.
- Thank you.

391
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

392
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,930
- You must be one of the Porters.
- No, actually, I'm not...

393
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,250
Yes, I'd like you to meet
my sister Miss DeWitte.

394
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,610
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

395
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,290
And that's my husband, Mr. Singleman.

396
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,940
- Oh, sorry.
- Fine, thank you.

397
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,740
- That's Jeffrey, of course.
- Of course.

398
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,490
- I didn't get your name, sir.
- Benjamin Braddock, sir...

399
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,660
- Braddock.
- Yes, but I'm afraid...

400
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,200
Oh, no, no, no, I'll find
your table in just a moment.

401
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,930
Braddock, Braddock, Braddock.
Not Braniff. We have a Braniff.

402
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,500
No, actually, I'm just
looking for a friend.

403
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,170
Oh, well, I don't understand.

404
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,010
I'm not with your party. I'm sorry.

405
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,920
Hey, I don't get it.

406
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,980
I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr. Braniff.

407
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,580
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Oh, hello.

408
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,320
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

409
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,790
Thank you.

410
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,880
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

411
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,010
- May I have a drink?
- A drink. Of course.

412
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,880
He didn't see me.

413
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,520
- Waiter. I will have a martini.
- Yes, ma'am.

414
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,930
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.

415
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,720
Nervous? Well, I am a bit nervous.

416
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,360
I mean, it's pretty hard to be suave
when you're...

417
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,100
- Did you get us a room?
- What?

418
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,980
- Have you gotten us a room yet?
- I haven't, no.

419
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,540
Do you want to?

420
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,080
Well, I don't... I mean, I could,
or we could just talk.

421
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,380
- You want me to get it?
- You... Oh, no, no, I'll get it.

422
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,950
Do you want to get it now?

423
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,630
- Now?
- Yes.

424
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,890
Well, I don't know.

425
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,460
- Why don't you get it?
- Why don't I get it?

426
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,060
Well, I will then, if you'll excuse me.

427
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,540
Excuse me.

428
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,660
Yes, sir?

429
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,820
A room. I'd like a room, please.

430
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,570
Single room or a double room?

431
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,610
A single, just for myself, please.

432
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,420
Could you sign the register, please?

433
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,260
- Anything wrong, sir?
- What? No, nothing.

434
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,900
Do you have any luggage, Mr. Gladstone?

435
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,030
Luggage? Yes, yes, I do.

436
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,010
- Where is it?
- What?

437
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,740
Where is your luggage?

438
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,020
Well, it's in the car.
It's out there in the car.

439
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,980
Very good, sir.
I'll have a porter bring it in.

440
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,250
Oh, no.

441
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,360
I mean, I'd...

442
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,530
I'd rather not go to all
the trouble of bringing it all in.

443
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,240
I just have a toothbrush.
I can get it myself, if that's all right.

444
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,120
Of course. I'll have
a porter show you the room.

445
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,080
Oh, well, actually,
I'd just as soon find it myself.

446
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,870
I just have a toothbrush
to carry up, and I...

447
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,600
I can handle it myself.

448
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,980
- Whatever you say, sir.
- Thank you.

449
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,470
- Mrs. Robinson?
- Yes?

450
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,400
- For you.
- Thank you.

451
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,560
Hello.

452
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,100
- Mrs. Robinson?
- Yes?

453
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,290
- It's Benjamin.
- Yes?

454
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,330
Benjamin Braddock.

455
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,790
Benjamin, where are you?

456
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,670
Can you look through the glass?

457
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,370
- Can you see me now?
- Yes, I can.

458
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,080
- I got a single room.
- That's fine.

459
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,560
But there's one thing. The desk clerk
seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

460
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,760
Now, I don't know what the policy is...

461
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,670
- Well, do you want to go up first?
- Yes, I think that would be good.

462
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,590
- I'll be up in five minutes.
- Well, goodbye, then.

463
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,600
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

464
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,180
Isn't there something you want to tell me?

465
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,360
- Tell you?
- Yes.

466
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,940
Well, I want you to know how much
I appreciate this. Really...

467
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,690
- The number.
- What?

468
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,230
The room number, Benjamin.
I think you ought to tell me that.

469
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,040
You're absolutely right.

470
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,050
- It's 568.
- Thank you.

471
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,220
You're welcome.

472
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,640
Well...

473
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,890
I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

474
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,610
Check, please.

475
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,900
I've got it.

476
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,640
- I say I've got it.
- Sir?

477
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,970
- The toothbrush. I got it all right.
- Very good, sir.

478
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,160
- Yes. Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.

479
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,610
Hello, Benjamin.

480
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,480
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

481
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,390
Well.

482
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,810
- Benjamin...
- Yes.

483
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,470
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?

484
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,930
Sure. Shall I...

485
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,270
I mean, shall I just stand here?

486
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,480
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to do.

487
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,980
- Why don't you watch?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

488
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,610
- Will you bring me a hanger?
- What?

489
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,750
- A hanger.
- Oh, yes.

490
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,960
- Wood?
- What?

491
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,430
Wood or wire? They have both.

492
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,100
- Either one will be fine.
- Okay.

493
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,190
Thank you.

494
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,740
- Would you help me with this, please?
- Certainly.

495
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

496
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,590
Benjamin, would this be
easier for you in the dark?

497
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,090
Mrs. Robinson, I can't do this.

498
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,760
- You what?
- This is all terribly wrong.

499
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,300
- Do you find me undesirable?
- Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson.

500
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,930
I think you're the most attractive
of all my parents' friends.

501
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,720
I mean that. I find you desirable.

502
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,680
But I... For God's sake,
can you imagine my parents?

503
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,810
Can you imagine what they would say

504
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,020
if they just saw us here
in this room right now?

505
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,070
- What would they say?
- I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson,

506
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,730
but for God's sake,

507
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,940
they brought me up,
they made a good life for me,

508
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,570
and I think they deserve better than this.

509
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,700
I think they deserve a little better than
jumping into bed with the partner's wife.

510
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,660
- Are you afraid of me?
- Oh, no. You're missing the point.

511
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,010
Look, maybe we could
do something else together.

512
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,350
Mrs. Robinson,
would you like to go to a movie?

513
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,670
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Ask me anything you want.

514
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,170
- Is this your first time?
- Is this what?

515
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,430
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.

516
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,900
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
That's really a laugh.

517
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,350
- Well, you can admit that, can't you?
- Are you kidding?

518
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,770
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

519
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,100
- Wait a minute.
- On your first time...

520
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,150
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.

521
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,230
I mean, just because you happen
to be inadequate in one way...

522
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,580
Inadequate?

523
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,050
- Well, I guess I'd better...
- Don't move!

524
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,740
<i>Hello, darkness, my old friend</i>

525
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,970
<i>I've come to talk with you again</i>

526
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,730
<i>Because a vision softly creeping</i>

527
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,270
<i>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</i>

528
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,520
<i>And the vision</i>

529
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,860
<i>That was planted in my brain</i>

530
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,170
<i>Still remains</i>

531
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,030
<i>Within the sound</i>

532
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,040
<i>Of silence</i>

533
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>In restless dreams I walked alone</i>

534
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,570
<i>Narrow streets of cobblestone</i>

535
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,630
<i>'Neath the halo of a street lamp</i>

536
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,470
<i>I turned my collar to the cold and damp</i>

537
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,810
<i>When my eyes were stabbed</i>

538
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,460
<i>By the flash of a neon light</i>

539
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,370
<i>That split the night</i>

540
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,400
<i>And touched the sound</i>

541
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,280
<i>Of silence</i>

542
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,740
<i>And in the naked light I saw</i>

543
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,010
<i>10,000 people, maybe more</i>

544
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,960
<i>People talking without speaking</i>

545
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,460
<i>People hearing without listening</i>

546
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,840
<i>People writing songs</i>

547
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,440
<i>That voices never shared</i>

548
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,660
<i>No one dared</i>

549
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,150
<i>Disturb the sound</i>

550
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,710
<i>Of silence</i>

551
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:06,610
<i>"Fools," said I, "You do not know</i>

552
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,030
<i>Silence like a cancer grows</i>

553
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,330
<i>Hear my words that I might teach you</i>

554
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,830
<i>Take my arms that I might reach you"</i>

555
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,040
<i>But my words</i>

556
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,970
<i>Like silent raindrops fell</i>

557
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,220
<i>And echoed</i>

558
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,390
<i>In the wells</i>

559
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,560
<i>Of silence</i>

560
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,850
<i>And the people bowed and prayed</i>

561
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,150
<i>To the neon god they made</i>

562
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,610
<i>And the sign flashed out its warning</i>

563
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,950
<i>In the words that it was forming</i>

564
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,200
<i>And the sign said
the words of the prophets</i>

565
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,880
<i>Are written on the subway walls</i>

566
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,940
<i>And tenement halls</i>

567
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,670
<i>And whispered</i>

568
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,070
<i>In the sounds</i>

569
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,410
<i>Of silence</i>

570
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,660
<i>April</i>

571
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,970
<i>Come she will</i>

572
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:44,710
<i>When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain</i>

573
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:50,150
<i>May, she will stay</i>

574
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,480
<i>Resting in my arms again</i>

575
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,060
<i>June</i>

576
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,730
<i>She'll change her tune</i>

577
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:13,900
<i>In restless walks she'll prowl the night</i>

578
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,450
<i>July, she will fly</i>

579
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:25,630
<i>And give no warning to her flight</i>

580
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,800
<i>August</i>

581
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,910
<i>Die she must</i>

582
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,100
<i>The autumn winds blow chilly and cold</i>

583
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,440
<i>September</i>

584
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,070
<i>I'll remember</i>

585
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,730
<i>A love once new</i>

586
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,820
<i>Has now</i>

587
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,300
<i>Grown old</i>

588
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,510
Ben, what are you doing?

589
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,310
Well, I would say
that I'm just drifting here in the pool.

590
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,730
Why?

591
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,070
Well, it's very comfortable
just to drift here.

592
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,110
- Have you thought about graduate school?
- No.

593
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,140
Would you mind telling me, then,
what those four years of college were for?

594
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,000
- What was the point of all that hard work?
- You got me.

595
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,830
Now, listen, Ben.

596
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,700
Look, I think it's a very good thing
that a young man,

597
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,490
after he's done some very good work,

598
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,410
should have a chance
to relax and enjoy himself

599
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,220
and lie around and drink beer and so on.

600
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,130
But after a few weeks,

601
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,630
I believe that person would want to take
some stock in himself and his situation

602
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,570
and start to think about
getting off his ass.

603
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,570
The Robinsons are here.

604
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,270
Hi, Ben. What are you doing
with yourself these days?

605
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,750
Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.

606
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,250
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.

607
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,950
Hey, Ben, Elaine's coming down
from Berkeley soon.

608
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,800
- I want you to call her up this time.
- I will.

609
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,430
'Cause I just think you two
would hit it off real well together.

610
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,810
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

611
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,440
- Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
- Hello, Benjamin.

612
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,950
- Oh, my.
- Hi.

613
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,920
- Hi. Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

614
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,610
Benjy. Darling,
I'm going to ask you something,

615
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:09,200
but you don't... You don't have
to tell me if you don't want to.

616
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,510
What?

617
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,100
Well, I'm going to ask you what you do
when you go off at night.

618
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,140
When I go off?

619
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,920
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

620
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,100
No, I do. I want to tell you.

621
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,110
I drive around.

622
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,300
- What else?
- Nothing else.

623
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,390
Well, you don't drive around

624
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,720
from midnight until noon
the next day, Benjamin.

625
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,280
- Oh, no.
- Well, then what do you do?

626
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,910
- You meet someone?
- Meet someone?

627
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,610
Why do you say that?

628
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,020
Well, this is your business.
I don't wanna play games with you.

629
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,500
Wait, wait.

630
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,170
I don't meet anyone, Mother,
but why do you say that?

631
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,240
Benjamin, I don't want
to pry into your affairs,

632
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,000
but I would rather you didn't say
anything at all than be dishonest.

633
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,970
- Good night.
- Well, wait. Wait a minute.

634
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,470
Will you wait a minute, please?

635
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:09,650
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say
a few words to each other first this time?

636
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,650
I don't think we have much
to say to each other.

637
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,950
Look, for months, all we've done is
come up here and leap into bed together.

638
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,230
Are you tired of it?

639
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,110
I'm not, no, but do you think
we could liven it up

640
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,280
with a little conversation for a change?

641
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,110
Well, what do you want to talk about?

642
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,300
Anything. Anything at all.

643
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,000
Do you want to tell me about some
of your college experiences?

644
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,510
Oh, my God.

645
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,640
Think of another topic.

646
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,260
How about art?

647
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,810
Art. That's a good subject.
You start it off.

648
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,810
You start it off.
I don't know anything about it.

649
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,360
Well, what do you wanna know about it?

650
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,570
Are you interested more
in modern art or in classical art?

651
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,650
- Neither.
- You're not interested in art?

652
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,490
- No.
- Then why do you wanna talk about it?

653
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,030
- I don't.
- Now, look, we're going to do this thing.

654
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,430
We're going to have a conversation.
Tell me what you did today.

655
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,220
I got up.

656
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,420
I fixed breakfast for my husband.

657
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,440
There. There's something we could have
a conversation about. Your husband.

658
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,270
Oh. Him.

659
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,530
I mean, everything. I don't know
anything about how you work this.

660
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,010
What do you say to him
when you leave the house at night?

661
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,620
- Nothing. He's asleep.
- Always?

662
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,709
Doesn't he wake up when you come home?

663
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,660
- We have separate bedrooms.
- Oh, I see.

664
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,700
So you don't... I mean,
I don't like to seem like I'm prying,

665
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,070
but I guess
you don't sleep together or anything.

666
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,550
No, we don't.

667
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,330
- Well, how long has this been going on?
- For God's sake, let's drop this.

668
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,800
Well, wait a minute.
Why did you marry him?

669
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
- See if you can guess.
- Well, I can't.

670
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,310
Think real hard, Benjamin.

671
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,810
I can't see why you did, unless...

672
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,980
You didn't have to marry him
or anything, did you?

673
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,060
Don't tell Elaine.

674
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,230
Oh, no. You had to marry him
because you got pregnant.

675
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,750
Are you shocked?

676
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,570
Well, I never thought
of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of...

677
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,740
All right. Now let's get to bed.

678
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,760
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

679
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,630
- So how did it happen?
- What?

680
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,410
You and Mr. Robinson.

681
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,220
I mean, do you feel like telling me
what were the circumstances?

682
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,640
Not particularly.

683
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,350
- Was he a law student at the time?
- Mmm-hmm.

684
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,360
- And you were a student also?
- Mmm-hmm.

685
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,530
- At college?
- Yes.

686
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,700
What was your major?

687
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,980
Benjamin, why are you asking me
all these questions?

688
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,190
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

689
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,790
Well, what was
your major subject at college?

690
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
- Art.
- Art?

691
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,050
But I thought you...

692
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,890
I guess you kind of lost interest
in it over the years, then.

693
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,560
Kind of.

694
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,770
Well, how did it happen?

695
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,240
- What?
- You and Mr. Robinson.

696
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,850
How do you think?

697
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,480
I mean did he take you up to his room
with him? Did you go to a hotel?

698
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,640
Oh, Benjamin,
what does it possibly matter?

699
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,950
- I'm curious.
- We'd go to his car.

700
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,250
Oh, no. In the car you did it?

701
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,420
Well, I don't think we were the first.

702
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,960
What kind of car was it?

703
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,880
What?

704
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,180
Do you remember the make of the car?

705
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,290
- Oh, my God.
- Really, I wanna know.

706
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,560
It was a Ford, Benjamin.

707
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,290
A Ford.

708
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,550
A Ford. God damn it, that's great.

709
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,480
- A Ford.
- That's enough.

710
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,910
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

711
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,580
- Don't talk about Elaine.
- Don't talk about Elaine?

712
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,960
- No.
- Why not?

713
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,610
'Cause I don't want you to.

714
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:38,960
Well, why don't you? I wish you'd tell me.

715
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,700
There's nothing to tell.

716
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,920
Well, why is she
a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

717
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,710
Well, I guess I'll have to ask her out on
a date and find out what the big deal is.

718
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:54,180
Benjamin, don't you ever take
that girl out. Do you understand that?

719
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,230
Look, I have no intention
of taking her out.

720
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,070
- Good.
- I was just kidding around.

721
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,490
Good.

722
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,620
Well, why shouldn't I?

723
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,190
I have my reasons.

724
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,780
- Then let's hear them.
- No.

725
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,000
Let's hear them, Mrs. Robinson,
because I think I know what they are.

726
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,570
I'm not good enough for her
to associate with, am I?

727
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,330
I'm not good enough to even
talk about her, am I?

728
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,870
- Let's drop it.
- We're not dropping it.

729
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,750
I'm good enough for you,
but not I'm not good enough

730
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,310
to associate with your daughter.
That's it, isn't it?

731
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,810
Isn't it?

732
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,360
Yes.

733
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,190
You go to hell.
You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

734
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,650
Do you think I'm proud of myself?
Do you think I'm proud of this?

735
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,480
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, I am not.

736
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,210
- You're not.
- No, sir.

737
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,090
I'm not proud that I spend my time
with a broken-down alcoholic.

738
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,990
- I see.
- And if you think I come here

739
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,330
for any reason besides pure boredom,
then you're all wrong.

740
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,330
Because, Mrs. Robinson,
this is the sickest, most perverted thing

741
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,910
that ever happened to me.

742
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,390
And you do what you want,
but I'm getting the hell out.

743
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,060
- Are you?
- You're goddamn right I am.

744
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,050
That's how you feel about me,
that I'm a sick and disgusting person?

745
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,440
- Now don't start this.
- What?

746
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,930
- Don't start acting hurt.
- Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

747
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,900
Mrs. Robinson, you lie there and tell me
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

748
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,370
- Did I say that?
- In so many words.

749
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,360
Benjamin, I want to apologize
if that's the impression you got.

750
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,490
Well, two minutes ago, you told me
I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

751
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,030
Now you say you're sorry
I got that impression.

752
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,720
I didn't mean it. I don't think
you'd be right for each other.

753
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,680
But I would never say you weren't
as good a person as she is.

754
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,440
- You wouldn't?
- Of course I wouldn't.

755
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,260
What are you doing?

756
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,610
Well, it's pretty obvious
you don't want me around anymore.

757
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,450
Well, look...

758
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,460
I was kind of upset there.

759
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,450
I'm sorry I said those things.

760
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:30,090
It's all right. I think I can understand
why I'm disgusting to you.

761
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,600
Oh. Look, I like you. I wouldn't
keep coming here if I didn't like you.

762
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:41,350
- But if it's sickening for you?
- It's not.

763
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,510
I enjoy it. I look forward to it.

764
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:49,360
It's the one thing I have
to look forward to.

765
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,760
You don't have to say that.

766
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,740
Well, I wouldn't.
I would never say it if it wasn't true.

767
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,080
Well, may I stay, then?

768
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,710
Yes, please. I want you to.

769
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,360
Thank you.

770
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,550
Well, don't thank me
because I want you to.

771
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,830
But you won't ever
take Elaine out, will you?

772
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,840
I want you to promise me that.

773
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,960
Look, why the hell did you bring this up?

774
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,580
It never occurred to me to take her out.

775
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,680
Then give me your word you won't.

776
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,310
- This is absurd.
- Promise me, Benjamin.

777
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,930
All right, I promise.

778
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,440
For Christ's sake, I promise
I'll never take out Elaine Robinson.

779
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,240
Thank you.

780
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,870
- Benjamin...
- Let's not talk about it.

781
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,210
Let's not talk at all.

782
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,160
Elaine's back from school.

783
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,040
I think it might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

784
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,000
I suppose she's not good enough for you.
Is that it?

785
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,550
Look, Elaine Robinson and I
do not get along.

786
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,510
How do you know?
You haven't seen her since high school.

787
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,300
I suppose your evenings,
whatever you do with them,

788
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,930
are just too valuable.

789
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,950
That has nothing to do with it.

790
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,930
I guess I'll just have
to tell Mr. Robinson

791
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,810
that you're too busy every evening
doing God knows what.

792
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,160
Now don't go on like this.

793
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,520
If Benjamin absolutely refuses
to take her out...

794
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,650
I do.

795
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,960
...then I will simply have to invite
all the Robinsons over on Thursday.

796
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,190
Well, Braddock, it's about time
you got around to this.

797
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,220
Your wife predicted you would say what?

798
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,480
Patty Duvalle.

799
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,860
That I didn't know...

800
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,390
- No points, right?
- No.

801
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,740
Here's the next question. Gentlemen.

802
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,400
Hello.

803
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,820
What is your wife's most unusual habit?

804
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,320
Come on in.

805
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,840
I'm afraid the young lady
isn't quite ready yet.

806
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,780
Here, what would you say to a short one?

807
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,340
- Scotch still your drink?
- Bourbon.

808
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,260
Can you think of something
before that bell rings?

809
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,216
Not shaving her legs.

810
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,650
Gosh.

811
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,230
Well, I'll see if she's ready.

812
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,030
I don't even wanna play anymore.

813
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,330
Sorry, honey, I...

814
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,480
Well, what else could... What did she say?

815
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,900
Listen, this was not my idea.
This was my father's idea.

816
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,780
Benjamin, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear about this.

817
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,530
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have
a drink, and I'll bring her right back,

818
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:41,490
because it was either that
or a dinner party for the two families,

819
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,680
and I'm afraid I couldn't quite
handle that, if you don't mind.

820
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,460
Look, I have no intention of ever taking

821
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,460
your precious daughter out again
in her life,

822
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,130
so don't get upset about it.

823
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:55,310
I am. I'm extremely
upset about it, Benjamin.

824
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

825
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,140
Well, I want you to keep
your wits about you tonight.

826
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,410
You never know what tricks
Ben picked up back there in the East.

827
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,160
You're living at home now, is that right?

828
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,510
Yes.

829
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,590
- Do you know what you're going to do?
- No.

830
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,520
- Are you going to graduate school?
- No.

831
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,940
- Do you always drive like this?
- Yes.

832
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,150
Sit down.

833
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,050
Why don't you watch the show?

834
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,790
Benjamin, do you dislike me
for some reason?

835
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,970
No. Why should I?

836
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,470
I don't know.

837
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,740
You're missing a great effect here.

838
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,890
Go, go!

839
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,530
How do you like that?

840
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,160
Could you do it?

841
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,420
Go, baby, go!

842
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,960
Stop!

843
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,400
Hey!

844
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,200
Elaine, I'm sorry.

845
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,070
Elaine.

846
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:39,650
- Would you take me home now?
- I'm sorry I took you in there.

847
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,080
I think I'd better go home, please.

848
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,420
Elaine.

849
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,720
- Where's the car?
- I just want to tell you something.

850
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,970
- I want to go home.
- But can I just tell you this one thing?

851
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,210
- What?
- This whole idea, this date and everything,

852
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,260
it was my parents' idea.
They forced me into it.

853
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,940
Oh, that's very nice of you to tell me.

854
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,050
No, what I mean is that's why
I've been acting this way.

855
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:13,150
I'm not like this.
I hate myself like this.

856
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,310
Listen, could you
just stop crying, please?

857
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,730
No, I couldn't.

858
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,910
- But could you try?
- No.

859
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,790
I've had this feeling
ever since I've graduated,

860
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:42,250
this kind of compulsion
that I have to be rude all the time,

861
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,730
you know what I mean?

862
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,480
Yes, I do.

863
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,760
It's like I've been
playing some kind of game,

864
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,360
but the rules don't make any sense to me.

865
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:56,060
They're being made up
by all the wrong people.

866
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,930
No. I mean, no one makes them up.

867
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:01,240
They seem to have made themselves up.

868
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,250
Say, I wonder if I could request
you to turn that down a little?

869
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:13,760
<i>Pleasure machine</i>

870
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:19,760
<i>Do figures of authority
just shoot you down?</i>

871
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:24,350
<i>Is life within the business world a drag?</i>

872
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,790
<i>Did your boss just mention
that you'd better shop around?</i>

873
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,940
<i>To find yourself a more productive bag</i>

874
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,600
<i>Are you worried and distressed?</i>

875
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,070
<i>Can't seem to get no rest</i>

876
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:43,530
<i>Put our product to the test</i>

877
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:46,280
<i>You'll feel just fine</i>

878
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,340
<i>Now you can buy a...</i>

879
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,640
Would you like to come in?

880
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,290
I could make you some coffee.

881
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:05,850
No. I mean, I wouldn't want
to wake anyone up.

882
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,400
We won't. Let's go inside.

883
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:13,010
- Wait a minute.
- Is anything wrong?

884
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,240
No. I was just thinking.

885
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:21,700
It's still early. Maybe we could
do something, go somewhere else.

886
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,490
All right.

887
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,400
Where are we going?

888
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,320
I'm trying to think of where there's
a place to have a drink around here.

889
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,800
Isn't there one at the Taft Hotel?

890
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,620
What is the matter?

891
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,370
Nothing. I'm just wondering
if they have a bar or not.

892
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:48,560
I mean, let's go see.
Let's go see if they do or not.

893
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,010
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me
that there isn't a bar here.

894
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,170
I mean, as far as I know.

895
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,890
Of course there is. Look.
There's the Palm Room right there.

896
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,390
Good evening.

897
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:00,180
Hello. How are you, sir?

898
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,320
- Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.
- Hello again.

899
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,120
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

900
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,290
Benjamin?

901
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,570
Let's get out of here, Elaine.
Let's go somewhere else.

902
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,490
- Do they know you?
- Of course not.

903
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,380
- Good evening, sir.
- Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.

904
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,510
Mr. Gladstone, how are you?

905
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,580
- Benjamin, what's happening?
- I don't know.

906
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,710
They must think I look
like this guy Gladstone.

907
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,640
Hello, Mr. Braniff.

908
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,700
Elaine, I like you. I like you so much.

909
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,330
Do you believe that?

910
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,420
- Do you?
- Yes.

911
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,000
You're the first...

912
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,550
You're the first thing for so long
that I've liked.

913
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,720
The first person I could stand to be with.

914
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,220
My whole life is such a waste.

915
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,480
It's just nothing.

916
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:20,530
I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.

917
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:27,070
Benjamin, are you having
an affair with someone?

918
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,210
I'm sorry.

919
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,630
I'm sorry. That's not my business.

920
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,250
It just happened.

921
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:45,260
It was just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

922
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:48,180
Can you understand that?

923
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,390
Was she married or something?

924
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,310
Yes.

925
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,170
With a family?

926
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,400
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

927
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,900
- Did they ever find out?
- No.

928
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:08,990
And it's all over now?

929
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,290
Yes.

930
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,630
I'm glad.

931
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,330
Can we do something tomorrow?

932
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,640
All right.

933
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,010
During the day, we'll go
for a drive or something.

934
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,670
Okay.

935
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:43,590
- You sure you really want to?
- Yes.

936
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,930
'Cause I wouldn't want you
to do it unless you really wanted to.

937
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,110
- I do.
- You do?

938
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:51,475
Benjamin, I really do.

939
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,970
Drive down the block.

940
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:28,220
Mrs. Robinson, Elaine and I have a date.
We're going for a drive.

941
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,410
Do exactly as I say.

942
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:40,710
- Now, it seems to me...
- Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin.

943
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,490
You are not to see Elaine again ever.
Those are my orders. Is that clear?

944
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:47,870
- Mrs. Robinson, do you think...
- I can make things quite unpleasant.

945
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,550
How?

946
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:54,060
In order to keep Elaine away from you,
I am prepared to tell her everything.

947
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,230
I don't believe you.

948
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,130
Then you better start believing me.

949
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:03,440
I just don't believe you would do that.

950
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,780
Try me.

951
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,700
God damn it.

952
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,900
Elaine!

953
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,820
- Elaine! I'm coming up!
- Benjamin?

954
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,630
I'm not dressed yet.

955
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,830
- Benjamin, I said I wasn't dressed.
- You've got to go over the back fence

956
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,950
- and I'll meet you round the corner.
- What's the matter?

957
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,600
Hurry. Put your shoes on.

958
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,920
Benjamin.

959
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,090
- Benjamin, what are you doing?
- Elaine?

960
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:43,800
- Elaine, I have to tell you something.
- What is it?

961
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,010
- That woman...
- What?

962
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,930
That woman,
that older woman that I told you about?

963
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,140
- You mean that one?
- Yes, the married woman.

964
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,310
- That wasn't just some woman.
- What are you telling me?

965
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:55,070
Benjamin, will you just tell me
what this is all about?

966
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,840
- Oh, no.
- Elaine.

967
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,550
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

968
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,560
- Get out of here.
- Don't cry.

969
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,710
Get out! Get out!

970
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,180
Out! Get out!

971
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,440
Goodbye, Benjamin.

972
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:48,160
<i>Are you going</i>

973
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,850
<i>To Scarborough Fair?</i>

974
01:10:52,970 --> 01:11:00,350
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

975
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,630
<i>Remember me</i>

976
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:09,310
<i>To one who lives there</i>

977
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,720
<i>She once was</i>

978
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:16,410
<i>A true love of mine</i>

979
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,530
<i>Tell her to make me</i>

980
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:23,860
- <i>A cambric shirt</i>
- <i>On the side of a hill</i>

981
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,700
<i>In the deep forest green</i>

982
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,620
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

983
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,500
<i>Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground</i>

984
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,420
<i>Without no seams</i>

985
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,170
- <i>Nor needlework</i>
- <i>Blankets and bedclothes</i>

986
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,170
<i>The child of the mountain</i>

987
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:47,430
<i>Then she'll be a true love of mine</i>

988
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:52,770
<i>Sleeps unaware of the clarion call</i>

989
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,180
<i>Tell her to find me</i>

990
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,770
- <i>An acre of land</i>
- <i>On the side of a hill</i>

991
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:00,230
<i>A sprinkling of leaves</i>

992
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:04,110
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

993
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:08,860
<i>Washes the ground with so many tears</i>

994
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,490
<i>Between the saltwater</i>

995
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,950
- <i>And the sea strand</i>
- <i>A soldier cleans</i>

996
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,960
<i>And polishes a gun</i>

997
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:23,320
<i>Then she'll be a true love of mine</i>

998
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,920
Say that again.

999
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,100
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

1000
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:39,410
- Well, well, well.
- What's happening?

1001
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:44,190
Ben says that he and Elaine
are getting married.

1002
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:48,190
- I don't believe it.
- That's what he says, right?

1003
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,940
I'm going up to Berkeley today.

1004
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,920
Oh, Ben, that's so exciting.

1005
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,700
Here, come on.
We've got to call the Robinsons.

1006
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,370
We've got something to celebrate.

1007
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:01,450
- No, I think you'll want to wait on that.
- They don't know?

1008
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,870
No, they don't.

1009
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,830
- Well, when did you decide all this?
- About an hour ago.

1010
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:08,960
Wait a minute.
You talked to Elaine this morning?

1011
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,940
No. She doesn't know about it.

1012
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,170
You mean she doesn't know
that you're coming up to Berkeley?

1013
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,480
No. Actually, she doesn't know
about us getting married yet.

1014
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,600
Well, when did you two talk this over?

1015
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,280
- We haven't.
- You haven't?

1016
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:26,650
Ben, this whole idea
sounds pretty half-baked.

1017
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:30,710
No. It's not. It's completely baked.
It's a decision I've made.

1018
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,900
Well, what makes you think
she wants to marry you?

1019
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,460
She doesn't. To be perfectly honest,
she doesn't like me.

1020
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,890
<i>Are you going</i>

1021
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:57,240
<i>To Scarborough Fair?</i>

1022
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:06,210
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

1023
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:10,150
<i>Remember me</i>

1024
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:14,700
<i>To one who lives there</i>

1025
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,240
<i>She once was</i>

1026
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:21,920
<i>A true love of mine</i>

1027
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,000
<i>Tell her to make me</i>

1028
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,420
- <i>A cambric shirt</i>
- <i>On the side of a hill</i>

1029
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,170
<i>In the deep forest green</i>

1030
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:35,890
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

1031
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:41,020
<i>Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground</i>

1032
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,890
<i>Without no seams</i>

1033
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:46,730
- <i>Nor needlework</i>
- <i>Blankets and bedclothes</i>

1034
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,650
<i>The child of the mountain</i>

1035
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,690
<i>Then she'll be a true love of mine</i>

1036
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:58,200
<i>Sleeps unaware of the clarion call</i>

1037
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,700
<i>Tell her to find me</i>

1038
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,460
- <i>An acre of land</i>
- <i>On the side of a hill</i>

1039
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,830
<i>A sprinkling of leaves</i>

1040
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:09,630
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

1041
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:14,630
<i>Washes the ground with so many tears</i>

1042
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:18,100
<i>Between the saltwater</i>

1043
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,310
- <i>And the sea strand</i>
- <i>A soldier cleans</i>

1044
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,520
<i>And polishes a gun</i>

1045
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:28,630
<i>Then she'll be a true love of mine</i>

1046
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,400
<i>Tell her to reap it</i>

1047
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,570
- <i>In a sickle of leather</i>
- <i>War bellows</i>

1048
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,580
<i>Blazing in scarlet battalions</i>

1049
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:43,330
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

1050
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:48,580
<i>Generals order their soldiers to kill</i>

1051
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,420
<i>And gather it all</i>

1052
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,460
- <i>In a bunch of heather</i>
- <i>And to fight for a cause</i>

1053
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,430
<i>They've long ago forgotten</i>

1054
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:03,120
<i>Then she'll be a true love of mine</i>

1055
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,600
<i>Are you going</i>

1056
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:12,620
<i>To Scarborough Fair?</i>

1057
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:21,880
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

1058
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,830
<i>Remember me</i>

1059
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:29,480
<i>To one who lives there</i>

1060
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:38,280
<i>She once was a true love of mine</i>

1061
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:50,850
- You a student?
- Not exactly.

1062
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,120
- What's that?
- I said not exactly. No.

1063
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,910
- What are you then?
- Oh, I'm just sort of traveling through.

1064
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,280
I like to know who's living in my house.

1065
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,960
I like to know what my boys are up to.

1066
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:11,390
I'm not up to much, actually.
I'm just visiting.

1067
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,720
I mean, I've always wanted
to see Berkeley.

1068
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:21,800
- You're not one of those agitators?
- What?

1069
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,300
- One of those outside agitators?
- Oh, no.

1070
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,230
I hate that. I won't stand for it.

1071
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,240
I won't stand for that.

1072
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,990
Excuse me.

1073
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,160
Pardon me.

1074
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:07,130
Well, how about this for a coincidence?

1075
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,720
I was wondering where you were headed.

1076
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:18,470
- I'm meeting someone.
- Where?

1077
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,540
Where are you meeting this person?

1078
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,480
- At the zoo.
- The zoo.

1079
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,440
They have a pretty good one here, do they?

1080
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:34,740
- I don't know. I've never seen it.
- Oh. Well, I haven't, either.

1081
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:39,320
I might just ride out there with you.

1082
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:46,160
- Is that him over there?
- No.

1083
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,450
Where did he say he was going to meet you?

1084
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:53,510
- I thought he said by the monkey house.
- Oh.

1085
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,200
Benjamin, I would like to know
what you're doing here.

1086
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,620
- Here? In Berkeley?
- Yes.

1087
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,080
Well, I have this very pleasant room
on Carter Street,

1088
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,290
and I've been getting to some classes.

1089
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,630
- But you're not enrolled.
- No, I just sit in.

1090
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:08,960
They don't seem to mind.
They've been very congenial about it.

1091
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,880
Benjamin, you're...
I don't know what to say.

1092
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,930
Maybe we can get together
sometime and talk about it.

1093
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,570
Really incredible.

1094
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,820
- Here he comes.
- What?

1095
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,740
I've got a real feeling
that this is the fella.

1096
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,190
Elaine.

1097
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:28,080
He certainly is a good walker.

1098
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,280
Am I late? I'm sorry.

1099
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,460
We thought you said by the monkey house.

1100
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,700
This is Benjamin Braddock. Carl Smith.

1101
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,780
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.

1102
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,660
- Glad to meet you, Ben.
- Great meeting you, Carl.

1103
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,260
Swell seeing you.

1104
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:50,340
<i>Are you going</i>

1105
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,020
<i>To Scarborough Fair?</i>

1106
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:01,740
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

1107
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,900
<i>Remember me</i>

1108
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,500
<i>To one who lives there</i>

1109
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,580
<i>She once was</i>

1110
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:19,560
<i>A true love of mine</i>

1111
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:27,350
Who is it?

1112
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,000
I wanna ask you a question,
and then I'm going.

1113
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,670
- Come in.
- No.

1114
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,460
I wanna know why you're here in Berkeley.

1115
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,230
Because I am.

1116
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:37,970
- Is it because I'm here?
- What do you think?

1117
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:41,560
I think it is. I said I think it is.

1118
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:44,180
- All right, then. Yes.
- Well, I want you to leave.

1119
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,020
Well, look, I love you.

1120
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,730
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything?

1121
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:50,520
How could you possibly rape my mother?

1122
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,730
- What?
- I don't understand.

1123
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:53,690
- Did you say rape her?
- I don't understand how anyone could...

1124
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:55,820
What did she say?
You've got to tell me what she said.

1125
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,570
- Why?
- Because it isn't true.

1126
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,740
- I have to go.
- Tell me.

1127
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,290
She said that she was having a drink
at the hotel with a friend

1128
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:04,500
and that you waited for her
in the parking lot

1129
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,790
and told her
that she was too drunk to drive home,

1130
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,330
and that you would get her
a room for the night.

1131
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,790
Well, then what?

1132
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,590
Then you took her upstairs
and you raped her.

1133
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,010
Oh, no, no. That's not what happened.

1134
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:17,630
What happened was that there was
this party at my parents'.

1135
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,800
I drove your mother home.

1136
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,430
- I don't want to hear this!
- Then we went upstairs

1137
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:22,560
- to see your portrait. When we got up...
- No, I don't!

1138
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:25,020
- ...she started taking her clothes off...
- This is my mother, Benjamin.

1139
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:29,200
...and suddenly, there she was without
any clothes on. I mean, really naked.

1140
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:38,710
MR. McCLEERY: What's going on in there?

1141
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,790
- Oh, hello, Mr. McCleery.
- Who screamed?

1142
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,460
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

1143
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,080
Screaming is not all right.
Not in my house, it isn't.

1144
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,890
It was just a visitor,
but it's all right now.

1145
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,050
- What'd you do to her?
- Look, she's all right.

1146
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,680
She's upset, and she screamed,
but it's okay now.

1147
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,930
- Shall I get the cops?
- What?

1148
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:04,140
- I'll get the cops.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1149
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,370
Now, damn it, look.
Here she is, having some water.

1150
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,480
Now, there's no need
for the cops or anything.

1151
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,980
All right, boys.
You can all go back to your rooms now.

1152
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,960
Go ahead. We won't have
any more of this agitation.

1153
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,630
- Will we, Braddock?
- No, sir.

1154
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,800
I want you out of here.

1155
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,290
- What do you mean?
- Now, you heard me, out of here.

1156
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:32,930
- What for?
- Because I don't like you.

1157
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,180
I'm sorry I screamed.

1158
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,920
Benjamin, when you came up here,

1159
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,640
what did you think was going
to happen between us?

1160
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:20,550
Elaine, right now,
I don't feel like talking much.

1161
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:24,070
I'm sorry about everything,
but I think I'll just do this now.

1162
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,120
Can I just sit here while you're packing?

1163
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,000
If you want.

1164
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,270
What are you going to do now?

1165
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,980
I don't know.

1166
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:01,020
- Are you going home?
- No.

1167
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,060
Well, where are you going?

1168
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,990
Elaine, you're gonna have
to stop asking me that.

1169
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,750
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

1170
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,880
I don't understand.

1171
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,510
I don't want you to go anywhere

1172
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,390
until you have a definite plan.

1173
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,690
Goodbye.

1174
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:15,710
What's happening?

1175
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,310
- Benjamin?
- What?

1176
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,980
Will you kiss me?

1177
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,300
Will you marry me?

1178
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,310
- You won't?
- I don't know.

1179
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:07,560
- But you might?
- I might.

1180
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:11,480
Is that so? You might marry me?

1181
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,110
Yes.

1182
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,110
When?

1183
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:17,820
I don't know.

1184
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,980
How about tomorrow?
I don't mean to be pushy, but I think...

1185
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:25,420
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

1186
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,960
You mean you're confused?

1187
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,050
Look, don't be confused.

1188
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,300
We're getting married.

1189
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,550
I don't see how we can.

1190
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,520
We just can.

1191
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,650
I have to go now.

1192
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,490
Elaine? Are you serious about this?

1193
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,730
I'll think about it.

1194
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:05,040
- You really will?
- Yes.

1195
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,640
Good God.

1196
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,620
We can go down and get
our blood tests tomorrow.

1197
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,340
- Tomorrow?
- Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.

1198
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,840
Benjamin, I haven't even said
I'll marry you yet.

1199
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:33,270
We'll need our birth certificates. I happen
to have mine with me. Where's yours?

1200
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,900
- I just don't think it would work.
- Why wouldn't it?

1201
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,080
- Why wouldn't it?
- I just don't think it would.

1202
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:56,050
Tomorrow then. Can we get
our blood tests tomorrow morning?

1203
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,870
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

1204
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:02,000
Why don't I just drag you off?

1205
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,750
All right, I will.
Right after we get the blood tests.

1206
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:09,140
- I have to see Carl first.
- Carl who?

1207
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:14,110
Carl who?

1208
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:17,850
Carl Smith. He's a medical student.
We've known him for years.

1209
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:19,850
- Who, that guy at the zoo?
- Yes.

1210
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:23,670
- Why do you have to see him?
- Well, I said I might marry him.

1211
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,740
You what?

1212
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:30,120
How did he do it?
Did he get down on his knees?

1213
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,280
He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

1214
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:35,670
- No, Benjamin.
- Well, what did he say? I'm curious.

1215
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:41,040
He said he thought
we'd make a pretty good team.

1216
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:43,916
Oh, no. He said that?

1217
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,760
Well, where did he do it?

1218
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,430
I'd like to know where it happened.

1219
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,980
It wasn't in his car, was it?

1220
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:09,330
Good night.

1221
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,580
- Are we getting married tomorrow?
- No.

1222
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:19,570
- The day after tomorrow?
- I don't know.

1223
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:22,090
Maybe we are and maybe we're not.

1224
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:16,020
Do you want to... You want to try
and tell me why you did it?

1225
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:18,970
Mr. Robinson.

1226
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:20,930
Do you have a special grudge against me?

1227
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:23,180
Do you feel
a particularly strong resentment?

1228
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,310
No.

1229
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,390
Is there something I've said
that's caused this contempt,

1230
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:29,480
or is it just the things
I stand for that you despise?

1231
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,270
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1232
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:34,190
Well, Ben, it was
quite a bit to do with me.

1233
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:35,820
Now, look, please...

1234
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,690
Ben, I think
we're two civilized human beings.

1235
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:39,820
Do you think it's necessary
to threaten each other?

1236
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,160
I am not threatening you.

1237
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:44,260
Do you want to unclench
your fist, please? Thank you.

1238
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:47,160
I can see in the dark, you know.
I've been here quite a while.

1239
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:50,580
I'm trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

1240
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,580
I'm trying to tell you
I do not resent you.

1241
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,180
You don't respect me
terribly much either, do you?

1242
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,170
- No, sir.
- What?

1243
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:00,510
- No, sir...
- Don't shout at me, Ben.

1244
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:03,180
I may not be as young as you,
but I still have pretty good hearing.

1245
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,650
- Mr. Robinson...
- Have the decency to wait until I finish.

1246
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:10,730
I do think you should know
the consequences of what you've done.

1247
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:14,440
I do think you should know that
my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

1248
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,170
- But why?
- Why?

1249
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:23,030
Listen to me. What happened between
Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing.

1250
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:28,200
It didn't mean anything. We might
just as well have been shaking hands.

1251
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:32,210
Shaking hands. Well, that's not
saying much for my wife, is it?

1252
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:34,420
- You miss the point.
- I guess I do.

1253
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,640
The point is I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

1254
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,650
All right. Now, listen to this.

1255
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:43,720
I don't know whether
I can prosecute, but I think I can.

1256
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:47,650
I think I can get you behind bars
if you ever look at my daughter again.

1257
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:50,890
Now, I've seen Elaine, and I've made
damn sure you can't get to her.

1258
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:52,950
Stay away from me, Ben.

1259
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,770
I don't want to mince words with you.

1260
01:32:55,870 --> 01:33:00,000
As far as Elaine is concerned, you're to
get her out of your filthy mind right now.

1261
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:02,250
Is that perfectly clear to you?

1262
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:07,220
And that's all, Ben. You'll pardon me
if I don't shake hands with you.

1263
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:13,350
I think you are filth.
I think you are scum.

1264
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,100
You are a degenerate!

1265
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,230
Hi.

1266
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,970
Mr. McCleery, do you have some change?
I need to use the phone.

1267
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:31,720
I want you out of here.

1268
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:34,200
Look, I'll give you $10 for a dime.

1269
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:38,370
I'll give you $20. For God's sake,
will you let me use that phone?

1270
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:43,630
- I'm gonna call the police now.
- Could I make one phone call first?

1271
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,460
Get out of here!

1272
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,560
Elaine Robinson has left school.

1273
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,560
Her roommate's coming down
with a note for you.

1274
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:08,390
Dear Benjamin, please forgive me,

1275
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:11,680
because I know what I'm doing
is the best thing for you.

1276
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,600
My father is so upset.
You've got to understand.

1277
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,580
I love you, but it would never work out.

1278
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:31,850
<i>Dee, dee-dee-dee, dee-dee
dee-dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee</i>

1279
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,560

1283

<i>Do-do-do-do, do-do do-do-do</i>

1284
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:10,590
<i>Do, do-do-do, do-do do-do-do-do, do-do-do</i>

<i>Do-do, do-do</i>

1286
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:42,540
Elaine?

1287
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:46,290
Hello, Benjamin.

1288
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:53,280
- Where is she?
- Hello. Get me the police, please.

1289
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,740
- Where's Elaine?
- I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.

1290
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,510
Do you have a patrol car
in the vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road?

1291
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:02,220
Good. We have a burglar here.

1292
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,180
Just a second. I'll ask him.
Are you armed?

1293
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:09,520
No, I don't believe he is. Thank you.

1294
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,760
What have you done to her?

1295
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,430
I think we have everything
quite under control now, Benjamin.

1296
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,260
Would you like
a quick drink before you go?

1297
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,660
You can't stop me from seeing her,
Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.

1298
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:22,230
Sorry we won't be able
to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin,

1299
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:24,540
but the arrangements have been so rushed.

1300
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,620
What the hell have you...

1301
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:36,220
I don't think you'll have time
for that drink after all.

1302
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:40,050
- I'll find her.
- I don't think so.

1303
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:49,280
<i>Dee, dee-dee-dee, dee-dee
dee-dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee</i>

01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:09,660
<i>And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson</i>

1308
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,950
<i>Jesus loves you more than you will know</i>

1309
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:16,540
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

1310
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,790
<i>Stand up tall, Mrs. Robinson</i>

1311
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:24,040
<i>God in heaven smiles on those who pray</i>

1312
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,340
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1313
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,900
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1314
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:49,360
Say, fellas. Do any of you fellas know
where Carl Smith is?

1315
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:52,030
He took off in the middle of the night
to get married.

1316
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:55,110
Yeah, probably
one step ahead of the shotgun.

1317
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:57,360
Would you happen to know
where he's getting married?

1318
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,590
- I'm supposed to be there.
- Why don't you ask Carter?

1319
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:03,200
Would you happen to know
where I might find him?

1320
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:08,140
Hey, Carter! Hey, where's
the make-out king getting married?

1321
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:09,730
Santa Barbara!

1322
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:11,920
You don't happen to know exactly where

1323
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,170
the old make-out king
is getting married, do you?

1324
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:15,550
I'm supposed to be there.

1325
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:17,690
Where in Santa Barbara?

1326
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:23,320
I don't know. Maybe his old man's house
or in the maternity ward.

1327
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:26,560
- Hey, you going to the wedding?
- Yeah.

1328
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,990
Hey, tell him to save a piece for me.

1329
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:32,250
Of the wedding cake.

1330
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:40,390

- Yeah.

657-2036.

1340
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:51,400
- Hello, who is this?
- This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

1341
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,810
Is the doctor anywhere?

1342
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:55,520
Well, I'm afraid the doctor can't
be reached right now. If you'd like...

1343
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,110
I have to know where he is.

1344
01:39:57,210 --> 01:40:01,030
Well, you see, the doctor is at his son's
wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now.

1345
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:03,240
- He should be checking in any moment.
- Listen to me.

1346
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:06,120
I'm Dr. Smith's brother, Reverend Smith,

1347
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:08,120
and I'm supposed to perform the ceremony.

1348
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:11,290
I just got in from Portland,
and I've forgotten what church, you see.

1349
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:15,340
Oh. Well, I'm not sure,
but you might try the First Presbyterian.

1350
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,480
- Now that's on Allan Street.
- Thank you.

1351
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:20,440
Allan Street, where is it?

1352
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:23,900
Allan. It's, it's...

1353
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:28,780
It's six blocks up and, uh, three over.

1354
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,750
You need any gas, Father?

1355
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:21,840
Oh, Jesus God.

1356
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,060
No.

1357
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,346
Elaine!

1358
01:42:36,646 --> 01:42:38,691
Elaine!

1359
01:42:38,991 --> 01:42:40,385
Elaine!

1360
01:42:41,878 --> 01:42:44,138
Elaine!

1361
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,570
- Who is that guy? What's he doing?
- Elaine!

1362
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:49,340
- I'll take care of him.
- He's too late.

1363
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:52,556
Elaine!

1364
01:42:52,656 --> 01:42:55,703
Elaine! Elaine!

1365
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,270
Get up, you have to stop him.

1366
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:07,270
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1367
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:11,570
Elaine! Elaine!

1368
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:18,560
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1369
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:23,620
- Elaine!
- Ben!

1370
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:29,460
You punk. You crazy punk!

1371
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:31,800
I'll kill you.

1372
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:47,300
Elaine! It's too late!

1373
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,110
Not for me!

1374
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:53,600
Move! Move!

1375
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:55,830
- Damn you!
- Move!

1376
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:55,330
<i>Hello, darkness, my old friend</i>

1377
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:59,750
<i>I've come to talk with you again</i>

1378
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:04,460
<i>Because a vision softly creeping</i>

1379
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,880
<i>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</i>

1380
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:12,850
<i>And the vision that was planted</i>

1381
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:15,430
<i>In my brain</i>

1382
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:18,560
<i>Still remains</i>

1383
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:21,480
<i>Within the sound</i>

1384
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:24,650
<i>Of silence</i>

1385
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:28,990
<i>In restless dreams I walk alone</i>

1386
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:33,410
<i>Narrow streets of cobblestone</i>

1387
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:37,790
<i>'Neath the halo of a streetlamp</i>

1388
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:42,420
<i>I turned my collar to the cold and damp</i>

1389
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,710
<i>When my eyes were stabbed</i>

1390
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:48,760
<i>By the flash of a neon light</i>

1391
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,860
<i>That split the night</i>

1392
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:56,260
<i>And touched the sound</i>

1393
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:00,150
<i>Of silence</i>
