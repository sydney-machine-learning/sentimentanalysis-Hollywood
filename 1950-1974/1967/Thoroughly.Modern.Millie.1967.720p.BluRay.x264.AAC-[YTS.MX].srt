1
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,345
In a bungalow all covered with roses

2
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:04,680
I will settle down I vow.

3
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:11,355
That's why I'm looking at the world
through rose-coloured glasses...

4
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:34,312
There are those, I suppose,

5
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,725
think we're mad, Heaven knows.

6
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,816
The world has gone to rack and ruin.

7
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,524
What we think is chic, unique

8
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:46,238
and quite adorable

9
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,491
they think is odd and
Sodom- and Gomorrah-able.

10
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:54,578
But everything today
is thoroughly modern.

11
00:08:55,584 --> 00:09:00,210
Check your personality.
Everything today makes yesterday slow.

12
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,916
Better face reality!
It's not insanity,

13
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,667
says Vanity Fair.

14
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:11,388
In fact, it's stylish to raise
your skirts and bob your hair.

15
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:18,477
In a rumble seat the world is so cosy
if the boy is kissable.

16
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:23,813
And that tango they wouldn't allow
now is quite permissible.

17
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:28,101
Goodbye, good-goody girl,
I'm changing and how!

18
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,854
So beat the drums,
'cause here comes

19
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:38,280
thoroughly modern Millie now.

20
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:43,046
Everything is thoroughly modern.
Bands are getting jazzier.

21
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:47,383
Everything today is starting to go.
Cars are getting snazzier.

22
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:52,384
Men say it's criminal
what women'll do.

23
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,471
What they're forgetting is

24
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,935
that this is 1922.

25
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,396
Have you seen the way they kiss
in the movies? Isn't it delectable?

26
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:09,613
Painting lips and pencil-lining your
brow now is quite respectable.

27
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:14,031
Goodbye good-goody girl,
I'm changing and how!

28
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,412
So beat the drums,
'cause here comes

29
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:23,498
thoroughly modern Millie now.

30
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:24,720
35 cents, please.
- A pen, please.

31
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,299
A pen?
- To write a check.

32
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:30,680
35 cents I said,
not 35 dollars.

33
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:33,061
Who writes a check for 35 cents?

34
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,273
Oh, I do.

35
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,766
You can get it from your desk clerk.

36
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:42,112
But I don't live here, as yet.

37
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:43,859
Look, a pen.

38
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:48,114
Lady, I got 7 kids and 1 in the oven.
I can't take a check.

39
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,490
The date?
- I can't take no check!

40
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,866
No check? But it's
from the Gotham National Bank.

41
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,451
I don't give a hoot...
- Can I help?

42
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,962
You got 35 cents cash?
American?

43
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,050
Yes, I think so.
- Thank you, Miss.

44
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:13,048
Yes, I do.
Here: 10, 20, 30... 5.

45
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,559
You did say 35?
- Yeah, yeah.

46
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,522
Ain't every day you meet a Vanderbilt
and a Rockefeller.

47
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,564
Thank you.

48
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:43,452
Oh, but my bags?

49
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:48,081
It's all right. We can manage.
I live here. - Oh, thank you.

50
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,483
Allow me.

51
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,438
It is a middle-class hotel, isn't it?
- Yes.

52
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,363
Perfect.
- My name is Millie Dillmount.

53
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,611
Perfect. I'm Miss Dorothy Brown
from California.

54
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:28,995
I do hope there's room for me.

55
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:32,741
Yes?

56
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,912
Dear me.

57
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,744
This is Mrs. Meers, our house mother.
- How do you do?

58
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,755
How do you do? I'm
Miss Dorothy Brown from California.

59
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,130
How do you do? And who are you?

60
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:50,262
Oh, you're Millie. - It's the new me.
Toss your cares and curls away.

61
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,801
What can we do for you, Dorothy?

62
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,890
Miss Dorothy. I'm looking for a room.

63
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,232
I have a nice one on the 12th floor.

64
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,983
On the 12th floor? - Yes.
Directly across the hall from you.

65
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,234
Ethel Peace just checked out.
- But she only just checked in.

66
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,326
She went back to Wyoming.

67
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,447
But why?
She has no one there.

68
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,661
Oh, just a restless girl.

69
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,872
Now if you'd register, Dorothy.
I mean, Miss Dorothy.

70
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:25,160
The mail just came in.
Always some for you, Millie.

71
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:28,756
Lonely lady?

72
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:39,142
One from Brother in Chicago, two from
Mother, one from Sister in Detroit.

73
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:42,217
Millie has such a big, warm family.

74
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:46,393
You have such a big,
warm family, Miss Dorothy?

75
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,315
I'm an orphan.
- Are you?

76
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,316
Sad to be all alone in the world.

77
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,861
Thank you.

78
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,469
Gung ho, dear.

79
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:29,056
Heavy on the starch!

80
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,309
Thank you, Millie.

81
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:51,411
How long have you lived here, Millie?
You look lived in.

82
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,779
About 3 months.
Yes, I'm getting quite hard.

83
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,954
I'm looking for life raw and real.
I'm going to be an actress.

84
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,255
An actress? How exciting.
- Yes, But I've got to live first.

85
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:10,839
You should do very well on stage.
Pictures, too.

86
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:21,850
Would you mind closing the doors
and pressing number 12? - Not at all.

87
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,098
Thank you.

88
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:34,902
It's broken. - No, just temperamental.
Try again.

89
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:54,166
Some showgirls used to practice
their routines in here.

90
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:58,886
Oh, I love it. In the Ritz elevator
all you do is go up and down.

91
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,679
Would you mind taking over?

92
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,982
Is today your day off?
You are working girls, aren't you?

93
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:24,784
Just a minute. Yes, I just put myself
through business school.

94
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,282
A stenog.

95
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:30,571
Tomorrow I start interviewing bosses.
- I thought the other way around.

96
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,620
I can type 40 words in a minute.
I'm in demand.

97
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:39,583
Besides, I'm going to marry my boss,
whoever he may be.

98
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:42,414
You're a modern.
- Thoroughly!

99
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:53,926
I must study you
if I'm going to be an actress.

100
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:56,891
The theatre is full
of ruthless women.

101
00:18:57,314 --> 00:19:00,149
"Art reflects life."
That was in a speed test.

102
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,524
But it's true. Women today are free.

103
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:07,897
For the first time we're man's equal.
We can make a life for ourselves.

104
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:10,399
And I fully intend to.
- So do I.

105
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:43,596
Would you mind opening the door,
Miss Dorothy?

106
00:19:56,615 --> 00:20:00,280
Something tells me
you're not poor.

107
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,786
Ask me no questions,
and I'll tell you no lies.

108
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:07,241
One thing I know for sure.
You've travelled a lot.

109
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,781
Miss Dorothy?

110
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,207
There's little else for an orphan
to do. - Here we are.

111
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,465
I'm just across the hall,
if you need anything.

112
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,053
There's a dance tonight.
Wanna go?

113
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,640
Perfect. Would you
introduce me to the gang?

114
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,223
They're pretty high-spirited.
- Poor people usually are.

115
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:36,352
Watch out for the boys.
They pinch.

116
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:04,289
Excuse me, please.

117
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:09,875
Dont worry, the kids will soon
forget your dress is real lace.

118
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:13,755
Dont be concerned.
I'm having the most interesting time.

119
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:17,017
10 cents, girls.
For decorations and refreshments.

120
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:21,183
I left my checkbook upstairs.
- I've got it. - Oh, Millie.

121
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,974
10, 20.
Dip in and get your money's worth.

122
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,231
Millie, Millie, this is him.

123
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,560
Terrif!

124
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,362
Oh, delish!

125
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:52,538
Good evening.

126
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,793
Can I help you?
- It couldn't hurt.

127
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:57,590
I mean, are you looking for someone?
- Not anymore.

128
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:01,880
He's fresh as paint.
- He's just full of apple sauce.

129
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:08,601
May I introduce myself? - It's just
a friendship dance. - Jimmy Smith.

130
00:22:09,022 --> 00:22:12,971
Millie Dillmount, and this is Miss
Dorothy Brown. - Pleasure to meet you.

131
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:18,561
I was just passing the hotel
when I heard the snappy music.

132
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,658
You don't know anyone here?
- Sure, you. Dance?

133
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:25,195
I studied ballroom and tap,
but I'm not up on the latest dances.

134
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,403
I always make up my own anyway.
Dorothy. - Miss Dorothy.

135
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,412
Give me a name. - What for?
- Our new dance.

136
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,505
I never named a dance before. - What
did you have for dinner? - Franks.

137
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,469
Franks?

138
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:52,718
What else?
- Sauerkraut. - Sauerkraut?

139
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:56,431
No, what else?

140
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,230
Tapioca pudding.

141
00:22:58,648 --> 00:22:59,976
Tapioca?

142
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,482
Join me in the tapioca? And...

143
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:24,784
Well, then.

144
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:32,176
Now what do I do?
- Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.

145
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:41,176
That's too hard.
- Where are you going?

146
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:43,724
Everybody, tap, tap, tap, tap.

147
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:49,484
Tap, tap, tapioca. Everybody,
slap, slap, slap, slap,

148
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,893
slap, slap, slapioca.

149
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,892
If you got the dap, dap, dap, dap,

150
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:57,528
dappier flappers, flap, flappier.

151
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:00,240
Everyone is happier

152
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,990
when they do the tap tapioca...

153
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:08,405
when they do the flap flapioca...

154
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:34,017
A cup of punch, Miss Dorothy?
- Oh, yes, please.

155
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,812
Welcome to the Priscilla.

156
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:38,521
Thank you.

157
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:42,562
Excuse me.
- Yes.

158
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:59,205
They are clever, aren't they?
- Yes, aren't they?

159
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:06,337
Millie's a wonderful girl.
- Sweet.

160
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:22,011
A good friend, too.
First real friend I've ever had.

161
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,723
Sad to be all alone in the world.

162
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,315
My own recipe. Fruit.

163
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,896
Mrs. Meers, meet a terrif dancer
and a nice person, Jimmy Smith.

164
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,781
This is Mrs. Meers, our house mother.
- Pleasure to meet you.

165
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,907
Allow me. - Darn nice manners.
What a personality.

166
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,829
Care to dance, Mrs. Meers?
- Thank you. No.

167
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,865
I believe this one is mine.

168
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:50,832
And this is yours, Miss Dorothy.

169
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:53,960
Care to dance, Miss Dorothy?
- Oh, no thanks.

170
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:57,633
Go on, do it.
- I shan't break up a splendid team.

171
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:03,260
A darn nice party, Mrs. Meers.
- Please, go, enjoy yourselves.

172
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,223
You know the tapioca? - I believe not.
- It's the latest.

173
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:13,055
Well, I'm here to learn.

174
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:21,981
Pretend we've got a bowl.
We're gonna have some sport. Ha!

175
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:31,903
Add trumpled licks and a ragtime beat.
About a quart. Yeah!

176
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,796
Ya stir and stir with your knee,
adding a bump or two.

177
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:48,221
Ya heat it, mash it,

178
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,761
beat it, smash it,
if there's a lump or two.

179
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:21,875
Dont let the temperature drop
too many degrees,

180
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:25,875
or you'll wind up with what is called
the frozen tapioca freeze.

181
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,459
Everybody...

182
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:32,875
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tapioca.
Everybody, freeze!

183
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:34,584
Slap, slap,

184
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:39,341
slap, slap, slap, slap, slapioca.
Everybody, freeze!

185
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:14,955
Cinderella time?
- I'm afraid so.

186
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:20,754
I've got my employer's red roadster
outside. Care for a spin?

187
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:22,719
Sure.

188
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:32,926
I have to be back by 10:30.
- You betcha.

189
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:35,688
Look out!

190
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:41,392
I love driving on the wrong side.
Dont you? - Terrif.

191
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,938
Take the wheel.
- I've never driven a car.

192
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:51,074
You never named a dance before.
The starter, the gas and the break.

193
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:55,113
The starter, the gas and the break.
- Yeah.

194
00:29:04,298 --> 00:29:06,623
What other firsts ahead? Love?

195
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,217
Love? I see you're old-fashioned.

196
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:23,637
Okay?

197
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,935
Not too old-fashioned.

198
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:34,364
That's nice to hear,
but I know I could do better.

199
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:37,731
Jimmy, I'm going to marry my boss.
- When?

200
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:42,110
I don't know. I haven't got one yet.
I start looking for work tomorrow.

201
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,916
But I have plans, and I think
it only fair that you know.

202
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:49,126
Terribly fair.

203
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,130
I'm your equal. I'm going to meet
you men on your own terms,

204
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,593
cater to your craving for efficiency,
learn to talk sports, tell jokes,

205
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:01,711
smoke, drink and, if I have to,
I'll even kiss you back.

206
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,053
Love has nothing to do with it.
- I see.

207
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:09,968
We fought the war to end all wars.

208
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:13,314
Now's the time for fun,
especially for the new woman.

209
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:17,896
'Cause the old rules are out, and
they haven't made up new ones.

210
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:26,572
I never met a modern before.
- My beauty spot!

211
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:30,736
How am I doing?
- You're doing well.

212
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,288
What do you do for your employer?

213
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,378
What?
- I mean, what's your line of work?

214
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,036
I'm in steel equipment for offices.

215
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:43,591
Oh, paper clips like?
- Yeah. - I must get back.

216
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,462
Can I see you again?
That is, until you get engaged?

217
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,594
Oh, sure.

218
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:57,388
It's the 20th century.
I hope I'm up to it.

219
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,165
Mrs. Meers.

220
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,749
So late and still working?

221
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:35,093
Yes, very late.
Everybody should be in bed by now.

222
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:38,085
I have to do something here
with this spot on the carpeting.

223
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:40,922
A spot? - Yes.
- Where? - Here.

224
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:44,767
I can't see a thing.
What kind of cleaner is that?

225
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:48,188
Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce?

226
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:51,984
What do you know?
I must write Mama.

227
00:31:52,402 --> 00:31:53,730
Do that.

228
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,521
Good night.

229
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:05,621
Soy sauce.

230
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:12,709
Have a good time? - Sure.
He had his employer's red roadster.

231
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:17,955
Oh, Millie. Machines like gloves
should be black or white.

232
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,294
Are you sweet on him?

233
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:27,139
Oh, no. I've no time for puppy love.
I start boss-hunting in the morning.

234
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:30,760
Right. Good night. - Good night.
- Good luck. - Thank you.

235
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,094
Oh, give them hell.

236
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:42,690
Soy sauce.

237
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:28,311
Flannery, Miss Flannery.
Director of female personnel.

238
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:31,061
I run a no-nonsense organization.

239
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,946
Is that rouge?
- Yes, ma'am.

240
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:40,360
Why did you call ahead to make sure
Mr. Graydon was single?

241
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:43,654
I have no more time to waste.

242
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:47,285
You look fast to me.
- 40 words a minute.

243
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,838
No nonsense, girl. Mr. Graydon's
door is at the end of the hall.

244
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:53,798
Thank you.

245
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,114
He means, "Come in."

246
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:36,370
Hi, there, Miss Dillmount.

247
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:44,251
Right on the old button!
That's swell, just swell!

248
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:47,463
"Punctuality,
the pride of princes."

249
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:56,347
Beautiful.

250
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,016
How's that? - Your beautiful
baseball trophy. I love baseball.

251
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,145
I won it for golf.

252
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:07,063
I love golf, too.

253
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:09,444
Swell game. Play much?

254
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,032
Golf's my hobby,
insurance my business.

255
00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:19,236
You come highly recommended.
Bolt the door, take off your things.

256
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:22,953
Take a letter to...

257
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:27,753
to Mr. Harold Hudson.
You'll find his letter in the file

258
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:30,793
and an invoice
in the outer desk.

259
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:35,000
"Dear Mr. Hudson,

260
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:41,887
The shipment of floor wax
was rancid..."

261
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,977
Babyface,

262
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:50,225
you've got the cutest little

263
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,768
Babyface.

264
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:59,440
There is no other one
could take your place,

265
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,408
Babyface.

266
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,948
You sure have started something.

267
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,411
Babyface,

268
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,410
I'm up in heaven
when I'm in your fond embrace.

269
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:18,332
I didn't need a shove,
'cause I just fell in love

270
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:23,715
with your pretty Baby...

271
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,278
You've got the cutest little...

272
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:13,976
Swell.

273
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,059
Swell.

274
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:20,268
Congratulations, Miss Dillmount.
You've made the team.

275
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,461
Miss Dorothy.

276
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,586
No luck today either?

277
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:51,347
No, Mrs. Meers.

278
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:55,679
The only thing producers want to do
with me is take liberties.

279
00:38:56,186 --> 00:39:01,310
Sinful, but cheer up.
I've got something for you.

280
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,938
A California apple for you.

281
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:06,727
Thank you, Mrs. Meers.

282
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:09,773
It smells so fresh.

283
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:13,032
I'll bet it's juicy.

284
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:15,486
We had apple orchards.

285
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,781
Dont look back.
Face it.

286
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:22,825
Dont, Miss Dorothy!

287
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:27,118
You'll spoil your appetite. They're
going to set a doozy of a table.

288
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:31,294
Hello, Mrs. Meers. Did you forget
about the wedding night? I'm singing.

289
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:20,174
Mazaltov!

290
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:27,419
Groom, bride, mazaltov.

291
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:41,021
Drink to life,
it's wedding time.

292
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:44,894
Drink to life,
drink a glass of wine.

293
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:48,571
Let us sing,
it is such a joy.

294
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:53,368
Let us dance,
we should be happy.

295
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,076
Play on, musicians,
for the parents-in-law...

296
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:58,537
This is Jewish.

297
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:02,251
...for the groom.
Play louder,

298
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,497
so we can't hear
the two mothers

299
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:11,542
crying bitter tears.

300
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,636
Drink to life
is what mazeltov means.

301
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,556
Make a circle
that turns and turns.

302
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,808
A happy person
has money, too.

303
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,184
Drink to life
for the entire world.

304
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:34,940
Dance everybody. Dance
for the groom and the bride.

305
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:39,314
Be happy people.

306
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:42,863
Dance...

307
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:13,857
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:36,126
Drink to life,
it's wedding time...

309
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,115
Mazeltov!

310
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:23,587
Mr. Graydon's office.
Who's calling, please?

311
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,419
Jimmy!
- Dillmount! - Hold on.

312
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:32,007
A telephone is business equipment.
Not a back fence to gossip over.

313
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:33,633
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:42,314
Hello.
- Are you sitting on his lap?

315
00:44:42,736 --> 00:44:44,775
I've been here a week. Where were you?

316
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:46,987
On business.
- Oh, I wondered.

317
00:44:47,406 --> 00:44:50,407
I spoke to my boss about
your paper clips. - Thanks.

318
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:53,613
Did you kiss him back yet?
- No.

319
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:56,872
Has he held your hand? - No.
- Got a pet name? - Yes.

320
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,244
What? - John.
- John? - John. - John?

321
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:02,210
That's not very romantic.

322
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:05,629
But it's modern.
Mr. Graydon is very business-like.

323
00:45:06,048 --> 00:45:10,792
But he's not cold.
He's manly, but not gruff.

324
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:15,216
He calls me John, because I'm
so efficient. "Johnny on the spot."

325
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:19,217
I'm wearing a new dress, and...
- What time do you get off?

326
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:22,394
Half day Saturday.
- Like to go for an outing?

327
00:45:23,646 --> 00:45:24,642
That sounds grand!

328
00:45:25,064 --> 00:45:27,851
Lunch and dinner.
Ask Miss Dorothy to join us.

329
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:30,682
Miss Dorothy?
- She's still around?

330
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:33,602
Sure, I'll ask her.
- Pick you up at 12:45.

331
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,573
Fine. Jimmy, I'm still
going to marry my boss.

332
00:45:40,786 --> 00:45:44,404
Over my dead body!

333
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,248
I guess his nickel was up.

334
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:55,457
John, write a memo to Splife.
The paper was not up to snuff.

335
00:45:55,882 --> 00:46:01,386
Yes, sir. - Sorry luck. Not pleased.
Take it back.

336
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,550
Yes, sir. Got you!

337
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:18,141
You ought to try a pipe.
Separates the men from the boys.

338
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:22,518
Mr. Graydon, you're just a tease.
- Swell dress.

339
00:46:53,432 --> 00:46:55,010
Oh, Jimmy!

340
00:46:57,728 --> 00:47:00,681
I said,
the sky's the limit.

341
00:47:01,106 --> 00:47:02,268
What a thrill!

342
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:08,028
My employer's. But he's out of town,
so I can use it whenever I want to.

343
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:11,150
I'll teach you to fly.
- You're razzing me.

344
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:15,784
Just another first.
We're facing a lot of 'em, aren't we?

345
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:20,370
Jimmy, look there!

346
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:21,707
Raspberry!

347
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,230
Holy mackerel.
Who was that?

348
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:41,606
Mrs. Van Hosmere, our hostess.

349
00:48:42,026 --> 00:48:44,268
The outing's at her house.

350
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:48,072
We're flying over it now.
- Where?

351
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,615
That's a house?
I mean, somebody lives down there?

352
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:02,533
It's a mansion,
but she calls it a cottage.

353
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:07,504
My father used to be her gardener.
She's always been very good to me.

354
00:49:12,845 --> 00:49:14,339
Miss Dorothy!

355
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:17,966
That house down there...

356
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:22,056
I can't hear...
- The party is down...

357
00:49:26,273 --> 00:49:27,648
Oh, thank you.

358
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:32,562
That house down there...
Oh, look! Terrif!

359
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:38,611
A golf course. Mr. Trevor Graydon's
favourite. That's where we're going.

360
00:50:09,686 --> 00:50:14,643
Baron Richter, those loop-the-loops
are affecting my inner ear.

361
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:22,861
Why, Baron Richter.
You're perfectly marvellous.

362
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:26,863
To think we were against you
in the late war.

363
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:30,238
There you go.

364
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:32,574
Down you go, little Miss Dorothy.

365
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,671
Welcome, welcome, everybody.

366
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:48,084
Welcome, everybody. Hello, Jimmy.
The grass needs cutting.

367
00:50:48,553 --> 00:50:51,755
She thinks I'm the only one
who can trim the lawn like my father.

368
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:55,845
Do you promise to succumb
wholeheartedly to the merriment?

369
00:50:56,268 --> 00:50:58,937
Why, Mrs. Van Hosmere is
glamorous and gay.

370
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:03,730
Muzzy, call me Muzzy.
You, too, Miss Dorothy.

371
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:08,562
My flying instructor, everybody does.
We're all very friendly here.

372
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:14,316
Jimmy, I am proud of you.

373
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:19,699
Two delightful young ladies. I had
no idea you had such a good eye.

374
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:23,786
I do hope you all
have the most marvellous time.

375
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:27,162
Anything you want and don't see,
you just ring.

376
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:32,167
Well, now, what have we here?

377
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:34,916
Corky, the ace of hearts!

378
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,755
Love is very, very near.

379
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,563
You mustn't believe what you see.
Muzzy's full of tricks.

380
00:51:56,987 --> 00:52:01,399
Baron Richter, I'm going to need
popping soon again.

381
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:35,178
Sensational, Muzzy.

382
00:52:36,146 --> 00:52:37,640
My dance instructor.

383
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:40,646
Gregory Huntley.

384
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,474
Oh, where'd you get that dress?
- I rang for it.

385
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:24,593
Gee whiz.
Great wealth is so classy.

386
00:53:25,021 --> 00:53:28,224
Everything's so perfect.
It's just like in the movies.

387
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,769
Except for me. The very gates
of real society in a plaid dress.

388
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:36,274
What's wrong? - I feel unworthy.
- You look worthy. - But look at her.

389
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:38,572
She looks very worthy, too.

390
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:42,657
You know, Jimmy, you're a pip.
Everybody likes you.

391
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:45,996
If you take it in stride, so can I.
- Who's better than we are?

392
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:51,657
Only in America can a gardener's son
receive such spiffy treatment.

393
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:53,201
Jimmy.

394
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:58,754
Miss Tremaine, may I present...
- I've had the pleasure.

395
00:53:59,176 --> 00:54:01,003
Millie Dillmount, Judith Tremaine.

396
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:03,178
How do you do?

397
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:09,973
I couldnt help
overhearing your remark

398
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:16,348
about the gardener's son.
Jimmy's father had such a green thumb.

399
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:19,016
We hoped Jimmy
would take after him.

400
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:24,235
But there's been little evidence.
Good gardeners are hard to come by.

401
00:54:25,115 --> 00:54:28,815
Perhaps he prefers paper clips.
- Perhaps.

402
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:33,872
That gross diamond ring of Muzzy's
took my breath away.

403
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,199
Not completely, Miss Tremaine.

404
00:54:38,252 --> 00:54:40,244
No, not completely.

405
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:46,789
Bitch!

406
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:49,590
Miss Dorothy!
- I love you.

407
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:02,062
Ladies and gentlemen,

408
00:55:02,481 --> 00:55:04,853
attention! Thank you.

409
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:08,774
I have persuaded my star pupil
that she's ripe,

410
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:11,864
after only 5 nights of study,

411
00:55:12,698 --> 00:55:15,367
to make her singing debut tonight.

412
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:22,414
Okay, Muzzy.

413
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:25,533
She's miraculous.

414
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:37,627
My daddy was
a ragtime trombone player.

415
00:55:38,053 --> 00:55:41,303
My mommy was
a ragtime cabareter.

416
00:55:41,723 --> 00:55:46,598
They met one day at a tango tea.
There was a syncopated wedding,

417
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:50,222
and then came me.

418
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:53,981
Folks think the way I walk
is a fad.

419
00:55:54,401 --> 00:56:01,696
But it's a birthday present
from my mommy and daddy.

420
00:56:05,577 --> 00:56:09,788
I'm a jazz baby.

421
00:56:11,082 --> 00:56:13,158
Little jazz baby, that's me.

422
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:18,035
There's something
in the tone of a saxophone

423
00:56:18,463 --> 00:56:21,583
that makes me do a little wiggle
all my own.

424
00:56:22,008 --> 00:56:24,962
I'm a jazz baby.

425
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:29,846
Full of jazz-bo harmony.

426
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:33,930
"Walk the Dog" and "Ball the Jack"
caused all the talk.

427
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:37,602
It's just a copy of the way
I naturally walk.

428
00:56:38,022 --> 00:56:42,019
'Cause I'm a jazz baby.

429
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,767
Little jazz baby, that's me.

430
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:52,149
Rock to sleep
while the cradle went to and fro.

431
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:56,159
To and fro to the tune
of the tickle-toe.

432
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,204
Ever since I started to grow

433
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,918
love to hear the music playing,
see my dear old mommy swaying.

434
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:08,622
Razz-ma-tazz,
that's all I ever knew.

435
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:13,176
All day long
I would never get through.

436
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:17,177
Jazz-ma-tazz,
that's all I want to do.

437
00:57:17,598 --> 00:57:22,805
So play me a little jazz...

438
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:04,638
Jazz...

439
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:07,023
Baby...

440
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:11,275
Full of jazz-bo harmony.

441
00:59:11,697 --> 00:59:16,192
The wailing of the saxes
when those fellas go mad

442
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:20,662
cannot compare with what
I got from Mommy and Dad.

443
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,492
So hear this jazz baby...

444
00:59:48,812 --> 00:59:49,927
Miraculous!

445
00:59:51,982 --> 00:59:57,188
Little jazz baby, that's me.

446
01:00:10,831 --> 01:00:13,322
Swell! Just swell!

447
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:16,241
Everything's swell!
And you're just

448
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,995
swell!
- Let's be kissy.

449
01:00:19,422 --> 01:00:21,628
You like our place, do you?
- It's swell.

450
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:26,260
I can't wait to meet Mr. Van Hosmere.
- He went to his reward years ago.

451
01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:28,469
You said "our place."

452
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:32,304
When I married Mr. Van Hosmere
he was a widower.

453
01:00:32,725 --> 01:00:35,726
I came to all this
as the second Mrs. Van Hosmere,

454
01:00:36,145 --> 01:00:39,264
and I felt like a frozen quill
in Queen Mary's behind.

455
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:43,023
But Mr. Van H. Just swiped me
on the butt and said,

456
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:49,065
"Lady van Hosmere, it's our cottage.
Not my cottage, not yours, but ours.

457
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,482
Dont you ever forget it!"

458
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:57,744
Unfortunately, I enjoyed him but
for a brief but very ecstatic period.

459
01:00:58,164 --> 01:01:01,663
Sad. - Yes, and Mr. Van H. Hated
sad stories.

460
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:05,535
He wanted our place to be filled
with good fun and good friends.

461
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:10,588
Despite the noble experiment
we have a sufficiency of gin.

462
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:13,713
So drink up, everyone.
You're all invited to spend the night.

463
01:01:14,136 --> 01:01:17,587
We have plenty of extra PJs.
Myself I sleep in the altogether.

464
01:01:19,975 --> 01:01:20,756
Muzzy,

465
01:01:21,184 --> 01:01:25,644
you ought to be congratulated for
the enchanting grab-bag of people.

466
01:01:26,063 --> 01:01:28,933
It's so amusing to rub shoulders
with all kinds.

467
01:01:29,524 --> 01:01:31,683
And, darling, your ring!

468
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,901
How big is it?

469
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,814
About 2 quarts.

470
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:43,780
Raspberries! I've been waiting
all evening for someone to ask.

471
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:48,738
I thought it was real.
- It is real. I had it drilled.

472
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:53,377
The mascara has run
onto my brand-new dress from Paris!

473
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:58,457
Where? Dont worry. I know
something that cleans it.

474
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,508
You can't see a thing.

475
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,507
Soy sauce!

476
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,602
Soy sauce!

477
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:18,980
She's coloured my Paris gown
with soy sauce.

478
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:21,726
Please, Miss Tremaine, I...
- You! You!

479
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:24,314
Inviting a stupid shop girl!

480
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:27,656
Miss Tremaine, if I could...
- Idiot!

481
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:31,325
Dont you know anything?
Of course you don't!

482
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:36,287
I'll tell you
what's going on around here, you boob!

483
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,333
Miss Tremaine.

484
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:44,836
I will take care of dress.

485
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:49,583
No, I'm going home.

486
01:02:50,261 --> 01:02:52,088
Tea will show you out.

487
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:58,558
I'm sorry.

488
01:03:02,647 --> 01:03:06,940
I thought it would clean it.
Honest. Mrs. Meers swears by it.

489
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,570
Holy mackerel.
A dress from Paris, France...

490
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,696
Let's go home.

491
01:03:14,115 --> 01:03:18,278
We have to spend the night.
It's ceiling zero in New York.

492
01:03:18,702 --> 01:03:19,651
Oh dear!

493
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,831
Dont worry. It's like a film complete
with a witch, Judith Tremaine.

494
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:28,160
You're laughing at me.
- No. - I don't blame you.

495
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:31,503
And like the films,
there's a smash-bang happy ending.

496
01:03:31,922 --> 01:03:35,622
I'll become the paper clip king, and
I'll hire you for my stenog.

497
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:39,799
I'd be your boss, and you'd be
after me, and I'd say, "Sure,

498
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:42,712
okay, grand."

499
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,176
How can you be a paper clip king,
when you don't care a whit about work?

500
01:03:46,602 --> 01:03:49,472
You haven't asked me about
Mr. Graydon's interest in paper clips.

501
01:03:49,896 --> 01:03:54,853
You can't be happy-go-lucky all
the time. Make something of yourself.

502
01:03:55,276 --> 01:03:57,351
You're not getting any younger.

503
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:06,575
Maybe you should try gardening.
- They don't have stenogs.

504
01:04:06,994 --> 01:04:09,663
Be serious.
What's to become of you?

505
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,283
Do you really care?
- Of course.

506
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:14,989
I like you.

507
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,123
And I like you, by jingo!

508
01:04:22,216 --> 01:04:23,923
You've gotta show
some get-up-and-go.

509
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:28,885
I'll bring our latest paper clips
to show your boss next week.

510
01:04:31,974 --> 01:04:34,381
Dont. - What's the matter?
- I don't know. I feel...

511
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:38,060
So do I, Millie. You've unlocked
a room in my heart.

512
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,805
Please, no.
- Millie.

513
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:51,979
Interesting.

514
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:04,908
While I'm thinking of it...
Supper in half an hour?

515
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,791
Hello, Millie.

516
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:11,124
Thank you, Juarez.

517
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:30,105
Sometimes I get the feeling
Juarez is going to bite me.

518
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:35,767
He's a dear butler. He's teaching me
Spanish and rope tricks and...

519
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,448
Moderns don't cry.
- No, of course not.

520
01:05:47,998 --> 01:05:51,248
I must apologize for my guest.

521
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:55,535
Judith is a spoiled young lady.
Dont let her upset you.

522
01:05:55,964 --> 01:05:58,798
Muzzy, I'm so mixed up.

523
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:03,593
It's not only Miss Tremaine.
I am a working girl and a boob.

524
01:06:04,012 --> 01:06:06,633
There's certainly nothing wrong
with being a working girl.

525
01:06:07,057 --> 01:06:10,639
I was a working girl in a chorus,
but I wasn't a boob.

526
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:15,271
No, you married well,
and that's exactly my plan.

527
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:19,900
Jimmy told me your plans.
Love has nothing to do with it?

528
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:23,900
I'm a modern.
- You're a boob.

529
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:27,480
But you...
- You're not going to believe me.

530
01:06:27,991 --> 01:06:32,783
When I met Mr. Van H., I had no idea
he was a multi-millionaire.

531
01:06:33,204 --> 01:06:38,031
He was one of those darling daddies
hanging around the stage door.

532
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:42,409
I mean, he didn't even look
like a multi-millionaire.

533
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:47,878
And he drank beer.
Facts be known, I prefer beer.

534
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:50,756
He was a wonderful man.

535
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:53,847
Affection, that's what he had.

536
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:58,676
We became engaged, and he gave me
a great big old green-glass brooch.

537
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:02,766
I leant it to my girlfriend
so she could impress a new beau.

538
01:07:03,188 --> 01:07:09,107
As fate would have it,
he turned out to be a jeweller.

539
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:12,232
And the green glass
turned out to be emeralds.

540
01:07:13,364 --> 01:07:15,487
I truly prefer emeralds.

541
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:19,359
But I was upset.
I thought he had stolen it.

542
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,909
I begged him to take it back.

543
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,999
He just laughed and laughed.

544
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:29,959
Then he told me
he really was a multi-millionaire,

545
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,878
even if he didn't look like one,
and we became married.

546
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:40,134
While I truly do prefer emeralds,
we could've made it on green glass.

547
01:07:41,764 --> 01:07:45,927
While I've been in the bleachers,
you've been a player on the big field.

548
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:52,304
If it's marriage you've got in mind,
love has everything to do with it.

549
01:07:52,731 --> 01:07:56,776
Follow your heart.
No raspberries!

550
01:08:17,711 --> 01:08:21,329
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.

551
01:08:21,757 --> 01:08:24,792
Silly boy.

552
01:08:25,218 --> 01:08:31,754
Gee, what a real swell guy.

553
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:35,764
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.

554
01:08:36,186 --> 01:08:38,723
Oh, what joy.

555
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:45,398
He makes your troubles fly.

556
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:52,114
His glance has fireworks in it.

557
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:58,662
We kiss,
my heart does a whiz-bang,

558
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:02,366
flip-flop, heaven-for-a-minute.

559
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:06,576
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.

560
01:09:07,004 --> 01:09:09,673
Dont you know

561
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:16,128
what I can't quite confess?

562
01:09:16,554 --> 01:09:20,847
So coax me, implore me,

563
01:09:21,266 --> 01:09:26,391
I promise you won't bore me.

564
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:34,941
Jimmy, I might say yes...

565
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:46,924
So coax me, implore me,

566
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:52,964
I promise you won't bore me.

567
01:10:56,682 --> 01:11:00,382
Jimmy, I might...

568
01:11:01,103 --> 01:11:02,431
Jimmy!

569
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:12,528
Get in here, little Miss Dorothy.

570
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:45,605
Good morning.

571
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:49,523
Hello, everybody.

572
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:51,608
Goodbye, darling.

573
01:12:52,032 --> 01:12:54,949
We missed you at breakfast.
- I was in the gym.

574
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,952
Loosening up.

575
01:12:57,996 --> 01:12:59,573
Always searching.

576
01:13:00,206 --> 01:13:04,369
Cruncher, please meet
Millie, Miss Dorothy, Jimmy.

577
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:08,708
He saves his breath
for the last round.

578
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:11,703
You're not to be strangers now.

579
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:15,548
The country club is giving
a "Poor Man's Party."

580
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:20,382
We all get to wear rags. It should be
worth it. Promise you'll come.

581
01:13:20,807 --> 01:13:24,389
Thank you, but my weekends will be
taken up with Mr. Trevor Graydon,

582
01:13:24,811 --> 01:13:26,221
my boss.

583
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:29,895
Perhaps we can motor down for golf.
He's very athletic,

584
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:34,811
most mature, in contrast to
the flighty boys one meets these days.

585
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:36,939
And the best-looking thing ever.

586
01:13:37,488 --> 01:13:38,863
Yes, of course.

587
01:13:40,324 --> 01:13:42,566
Okay, bye-bye, little Millie.

588
01:13:42,993 --> 01:13:48,616
Promise you'll find your way back.
- Oh, Muzzy, you're so worthwhile.

589
01:13:57,381 --> 01:14:00,714
She's been so stand-offish
this morning.

590
01:14:01,134 --> 01:14:07,586
Could be she has a hangover.
The bathtub-ring was still on that gin.

591
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:05,314
Goodbye, Mr. Smith.
It was an experience.

592
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:09,440
I'll call you.
Hey, Millie! Millie!

593
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:22,866
Millie?

594
01:15:24,623 --> 01:15:27,078
Are you feeling quite well?
- Quite.

595
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,711
I thought your tummy was upset.
- The tummy isn't upset.

596
01:15:32,129 --> 01:15:33,410
Good.

597
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:49,889
Something you'd like to tell me?

598
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,387
No, nothing on my conscience.

599
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:17,574
Perhaps there's something
you'd like to tell me.

600
01:16:18,002 --> 01:16:21,418
Well, Millie, I... No, not now.
- Yes, go on.

601
01:16:21,839 --> 01:16:26,002
Well, I am terribly upset
about my career.

602
01:16:26,426 --> 01:16:27,671
Your career?

603
01:16:28,094 --> 01:16:31,926
Yes, the world of the stage
just doesn't seem to want me.

604
01:16:32,348 --> 01:16:35,053
They don't know the real you.
Cut your hair.

605
01:16:35,476 --> 01:16:38,809
Let them see
how truly abandon you are.

606
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:41,802
Cut my hair?

607
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:46,314
I don't understand.
Oh, I couldn't...

608
01:16:46,736 --> 01:16:51,895
People can't find you under the curls.
Good night. - But I...

609
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:55,320
Good night.

610
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:15,839
What? What is it?
- In my room...

611
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:40,489
Mrs. Meers!

612
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:45,278
Asleep in my room,
on my bed!

613
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:50,493
She works a very long day,
poor dear.

614
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:56,746
Well, good night.

615
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,411
Millie?

616
01:18:08,723 --> 01:18:10,799
What am I going to do?

617
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:13,925
Oh dear.

618
01:18:21,192 --> 01:18:25,901
Could I spend the night with you?
It'll give us a chance to talk.

619
01:18:26,322 --> 01:18:30,401
If we're going to save our
relationship, we need to talk.

620
01:18:30,826 --> 01:18:34,740
Have I done something terrible to you?
Please tell me.

621
01:18:35,163 --> 01:18:39,824
A girlfriend is very precious to me.
I don't want to lose you.

622
01:18:41,043 --> 01:18:44,293
Oh no, you haven't done
anything terrible to me.

623
01:18:44,713 --> 01:18:47,250
After all, I have my plans and...

624
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:49,749
I'm sorry.

625
01:18:50,801 --> 01:18:53,921
Your friendship is precious to me,
too. You can spend the night.

626
01:18:54,388 --> 01:18:55,550
Thank you.

627
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:01,512
But there'll be no more talk.
I'm not my brother's keeper, am I?

628
01:19:01,936 --> 01:19:03,596
You can have the bed.

629
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:07,390
No!
- I insist. To make up

630
01:19:07,816 --> 01:19:09,939
for my lack of gypsy spirit.

631
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,357
You can't take the small town
out of the girl.

632
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:21,195
Most irregular. I don't care
how middle-class a place it is.

633
01:19:22,078 --> 01:19:25,245
I really must callous up.

634
01:19:25,665 --> 01:19:29,958
Starting tomorrow, I am going
to be unspeakably fatal.

635
01:22:17,188 --> 01:22:22,644
Mr. Graydon's office. Jimmy, you are
always interrupting my life. Stop it!

636
01:22:23,069 --> 01:22:27,066
What did I do? - I have work to do,
and I presume you do, too.

637
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:29,316
Do it and leave me alone.

638
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:31,401
A day's work for a day's wage.

639
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:35,989
I didn't ask him to call.
I don't want him to call.

640
01:22:36,413 --> 01:22:38,489
Good. Forget the boys.

641
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:41,833
Get yourself a canary.

642
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:49,089
Forget the boys.
Get yourself a man.

643
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:10,729
Do you have a mo?
- A what?

644
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:13,564
A moment?

645
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:18,400
I would love to get a man's opinion
about Rudolph Valentino.

646
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:25,204
In "The Sheik" he takes Agnes Ayres
by brute force.

647
01:23:25,623 --> 01:23:29,537
And she enjoys it.
She enjoys it a lot.

648
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:33,163
What is your opinion
of brute force?

649
01:23:33,713 --> 01:23:36,998
I'm not for it.
Not at all.

650
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:40,166
Many women are unsettled.

651
01:23:40,594 --> 01:23:45,090
Now they are disillusioned.
They are in for truth.

652
01:23:46,141 --> 01:23:50,601
Give 'em a young man they can trust.
Tom Sawyer at 20.

653
01:23:51,145 --> 01:23:55,890
I never read Tom Sawyer.
Was he... sexy?

654
01:23:56,441 --> 01:24:00,521
He was only 12.
- When you've got, you've got it.

655
01:24:00,945 --> 01:24:03,352
John!
- Yes, sir.

656
01:24:09,452 --> 01:24:11,575
Take you to lunch?
- Mr. Smith!

657
01:24:11,996 --> 01:24:15,281
You are not going to take me
again ever, anywhere.

658
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:19,787
What did I do? What's wrong?
At least explain yourself.

659
01:24:22,297 --> 01:24:25,416
Not on company time.
- What...

660
01:24:27,426 --> 01:24:30,380
What lovely elbows you've got,
Miss Flannery.

661
01:24:36,226 --> 01:24:39,428
From my mother's side of the family.
- Really?

662
01:24:39,854 --> 01:24:42,724
The Bath girls were known
for their elbows.

663
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:46,889
Out!

664
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:52,484
Seems I'm leaving.
Bye, Millie. Ouch.

665
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:04,072
John, be a swell scout. Ring up
my club. A handball court for 6:15.

666
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:09,921
Yes, 6:15. - It'll work up a good
sweat. Edgy in the gut, you know.

667
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:18,135
Edgy in the gut.

668
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:29,846
You want a pen?
- Yes, of course. To write a check.

669
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:32,845
Lady, it ain't that much.

670
01:25:36,194 --> 01:25:39,314
How much?
- 25. - Thank you, Millie.

671
01:26:00,382 --> 01:26:06,336
Oh, sweet mystery of life,
at last I've found thee.

672
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:12,137
Oh, I know
it's just the secret of it all.

673
01:26:12,559 --> 01:26:17,434
...22, 23, 24, 25.

674
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:24,986
All the longing, seeking,
striving, waiting, yearning,

675
01:26:25,403 --> 01:26:29,187
the burning hopes, the joy

676
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:33,316
and idle tears that fall...

677
01:26:33,744 --> 01:26:35,535
Did I forget something?

678
01:26:37,956 --> 01:26:41,159
This is my friend, Miss Dorothy Brown,
from the hotel.

679
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:44,076
We were on our way to the Beauty Spot.

680
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:46,959
Miss Dorothys going to have
her hair bobbed.

681
01:26:47,381 --> 01:26:50,417
Bobbed? With your beauty?

682
01:26:50,842 --> 01:26:52,751
Mr. Graydon. Behave.

683
01:26:53,261 --> 01:26:56,676
I bet you could make
the moon and the stars behave.

684
01:26:57,473 --> 01:27:00,592
Miss Dorothys an actress.
The way the theatres so rotten...

685
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:04,635
You wouldn't rob some lucky stiff
of playing with those adorable curls.

686
01:27:05,063 --> 01:27:06,972
I just thought...
- Chuck it, John!

687
01:27:07,398 --> 01:27:11,347
He calls me John...
- John, we're taking Miss Dorothy out.

688
01:27:11,777 --> 01:27:14,731
And talk her out
of doing mankind such a disservice.

689
01:27:15,155 --> 01:27:18,773
Miss Dorothy, may I take the liberty
of asking you to dine?

690
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,618
You may.
- But what about your sweat?

691
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,954
Cancel it.
Swell, just swell.

692
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:29,077
We'll have dinner, and afterwards
a bit of vaudeville.

693
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:33,996
That is, if the comics aren't on.
Their humour can get too ribald.

694
01:27:34,422 --> 01:27:38,253
I hate for you to cancel your plans
with your gut so edgy.

695
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:41,878
On the other hand,
it would certainly be fun.

696
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:47,181
Perfect. Although I'd feel more
comfortable in a suitable frock.

697
01:27:47,683 --> 01:27:52,226
We'll be gilding the lily.
But we'll stop by your hotel.

698
01:27:53,146 --> 01:27:54,309
Taxi!

699
01:27:55,190 --> 01:28:00,100
Terrif! My first date
with Trevor Graydon. Come on.

700
01:28:04,906 --> 01:28:06,566
Oh, hi there.

701
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:30,958
Goodness!

702
01:32:40,145 --> 01:32:45,221
Ah, sweet mystery of life,
at last I've found thee.

703
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:51,652
Oh, I know
it's just the secret of it all.

704
01:32:52,155 --> 01:32:55,440
Oh gosh! Bravo!

705
01:34:13,017 --> 01:34:14,725
Raspberry!

706
01:34:15,144 --> 01:34:16,970
My God, it's Muzzy!

707
01:34:23,067 --> 01:34:25,190
What a full life she leads!

708
01:34:28,197 --> 01:34:30,901
Oh, do it again!

709
01:34:31,324 --> 01:34:36,910
I may say, "No, no, no, no, no."
But do it again.

710
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:47,619
My lips just ache to have you take

711
01:34:48,047 --> 01:34:50,289
the kiss that's waiting for you.

712
01:34:51,634 --> 01:34:53,460
You know if you do

713
01:34:55,512 --> 01:34:59,841
you won't regret it.

714
01:35:00,266 --> 01:35:01,843
Come and

715
01:35:02,268 --> 01:35:04,059
get it.

716
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,149
Oh, no one is there.

717
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:13,434
I may cry, "Oh, oh, oh..."

718
01:35:13,861 --> 01:35:16,945
But no one will hear.

719
01:35:17,364 --> 01:35:21,064
My mommy'd scold me,
'cause she told me

720
01:35:21,493 --> 01:35:24,162
it was naughty, but then,

721
01:35:24,579 --> 01:35:28,197
oh, do it again!

722
01:35:28,624 --> 01:35:31,459
Please, do it again!

723
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:33,427
Searching, searching, searching!

724
01:36:37,559 --> 01:36:40,892
Oh, Muzzy, we just loved you
and the human yo-yo's.

725
01:36:41,312 --> 01:36:42,972
Aren't they the sweetest people?

726
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:49,067
I was sure the Baron had done
permanent damage to my inner ear.

727
01:36:49,486 --> 01:36:52,486
The Bernini Brothers
have worked miracles.

728
01:36:53,072 --> 01:36:55,823
You were swell, just swell.
- Perfect.

729
01:36:56,242 --> 01:36:57,522
I'm learning.

730
01:36:58,243 --> 01:37:02,240
Hadn't we best be on our way?
Muzzy has to do her practicing.

731
01:37:02,664 --> 01:37:06,163
I'm through for tonight.
You can take just so much yo-yo.

732
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:10,118
We really must be going.
Tomorrow's a working day.

733
01:37:10,754 --> 01:37:12,497
Good night, Muzzy.

734
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:15,421
Swell, just swell.

735
01:37:15,842 --> 01:37:17,419
Yes.
- Oh, Millie.

736
01:37:17,844 --> 01:37:20,963
Would you mind assisting me
with these little hooks?

737
01:37:21,388 --> 01:37:24,093
Surely. I'll be right with you kids.

738
01:37:25,517 --> 01:37:28,138
He's divine.
- Thank you.

739
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:31,348
I'm falling in love with him
like you said was so important.

740
01:37:31,772 --> 01:37:35,355
I had no idea
they were such good friends.

741
01:37:35,776 --> 01:37:38,895
Oh no, they only just met.

742
01:37:46,535 --> 01:37:51,031
Such a baby!
It was his turn to undo me.

743
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,124
That Miss Dorothy!

744
01:37:56,544 --> 01:37:59,331
Great Scot! That Miss Dorothy!

745
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:02,755
Pretty as a peach
and skin to beat the band.

746
01:38:03,174 --> 01:38:08,050
Perfect little pippin.
- Perfect.

747
01:38:08,471 --> 01:38:11,674
What a dandy little bundle
for a fella to cuddle.

748
01:38:12,558 --> 01:38:13,553
Dandy.

749
01:38:14,059 --> 01:38:19,135
Imagine all that sweetness
in your arms?

750
01:38:22,024 --> 01:38:25,891
I'll type up this survey report.
Original in five?

751
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,775
Dont forget the dinner reservation
at the Plaza.

752
01:38:29,197 --> 01:38:33,574
Candle-nook room,
quiet corner-table for two.

753
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:37,027
I think Miss Dorothys for the Plaza.

754
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:41,580
And John... flowers.

755
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,326
There's a florist
just around the corner.

756
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,496
That's using the old bean, John.

757
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:51,539
Roses... pink... plump...

758
01:38:52,592 --> 01:38:55,083
long-stemmed...

759
01:38:55,511 --> 01:38:57,303
two dozen...

760
01:38:59,223 --> 01:39:01,180
in a vase.

761
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:32,625
Poor butterfly...

762
01:39:33,044 --> 01:39:37,290
'neath the blossoms waiting.

763
01:39:37,715 --> 01:39:42,043
Poor butterfly...

764
01:39:42,469 --> 01:39:46,964
for she loved him so.

765
01:39:48,891 --> 01:39:52,057
Plaza Hotel, please.
Candlenook room.

766
01:39:52,477 --> 01:39:57,139
The moments pass into hours.

767
01:39:57,565 --> 01:40:02,143
The hours pass into years.

768
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:08,322
Mr. Trevor Graydon would like
a quiet corner table for two.

769
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:11,692
Tonight, 7:30.

770
01:40:12,745 --> 01:40:13,694
Thank you.

771
01:40:14,121 --> 01:40:18,284
And as she smiles through her tears,

772
01:40:18,709 --> 01:40:24,129
she murmurs low,

773
01:40:24,547 --> 01:40:30,003
"The moon and I

774
01:40:30,427 --> 01:40:35,966
know that he be faithful.

775
01:40:36,391 --> 01:40:40,968
I know he'll come to me

776
01:40:41,395 --> 01:40:46,555
by and by."

777
01:40:46,983 --> 01:40:48,607
Flowerbox, please.

778
01:40:49,026 --> 01:40:55,064
"But if he don't come back,

779
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:59,108
Then I'll never sigh or cry."

780
01:40:59,536 --> 01:41:04,078
Flowerbox? Mr. Trevor Graydon
would like some roses.

781
01:41:04,498 --> 01:41:09,076
2 dozen, long-stemmed, pink.

782
01:41:10,128 --> 01:41:11,670
On the fat side.

783
01:41:12,088 --> 01:41:18,754
I just must die,

784
01:41:19,928 --> 01:41:27,757
poor butterfly.

785
01:41:50,955 --> 01:41:55,700
I run a no-nonsense organization!

786
01:41:57,544 --> 01:42:00,664
I'll step the law on you.
This is not a hayloft!

787
01:42:01,089 --> 01:42:07,340
Besides, she never wants to see you
again. Youth today! Going to hell!

788
01:42:14,684 --> 01:42:18,515
Never wants to see me again.
Banana oil!

789
01:43:11,733 --> 01:43:13,227
Oh, honestly!

790
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:16,570
Sorry to bother you, but...

791
01:43:20,074 --> 01:43:23,608
What is it you want?
- I'm looking for Millie Dillmount.

792
01:43:24,036 --> 01:43:26,111
She's on the 20th floor.

793
01:43:26,538 --> 01:43:28,080
Oh, thank you!

794
01:43:40,884 --> 01:43:45,426
...14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

795
01:44:43,146 --> 01:44:46,396
Judith Tremaine,
fancy meeting you here!

796
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,729
Jimmy, you crazy kid!
Get in here!

797
01:45:41,155 --> 01:45:43,147
Oh, wait! Wait!

798
01:45:49,287 --> 01:45:51,824
It's stuck!

799
01:45:52,247 --> 01:45:54,785
Push!

800
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:57,450
1, 2, 3...

801
01:46:02,882 --> 01:46:04,080
Millie?

802
01:46:11,139 --> 01:46:13,760
Millie? You crazy kid!

803
01:46:14,183 --> 01:46:16,140
I fell out.
- Hang on!

804
01:46:27,653 --> 01:46:29,729
Stop!

805
01:46:50,173 --> 01:46:51,999
Oh, there you are, Millie. Good.

806
01:46:56,011 --> 01:46:59,711
Just another first.
Come on, Millie.

807
01:47:04,018 --> 01:47:07,303
Hand over hand.
You're a whiz at it.

808
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:09,473
Gently now.

809
01:47:21,742 --> 01:47:23,485
I have you.

810
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:25,737
You're home.

811
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:33,957
Thank you! Thank you!

812
01:47:39,173 --> 01:47:40,667
Miss Flannery.

813
01:47:48,139 --> 01:47:50,215
Yes?
- Excuse me.

814
01:47:55,229 --> 01:47:59,309
Old elbow said you never wanted
to see me again.

815
01:47:59,733 --> 01:48:01,690
Well, I did say that.

816
01:48:02,735 --> 01:48:06,982
But I am glad to see you.
I was feeling awfully blue.

817
01:48:07,406 --> 01:48:09,197
You're a strange bird.

818
01:48:09,992 --> 01:48:13,656
You look different.
- I lost my glasses.

819
01:48:16,664 --> 01:48:20,329
You have nice eyes.
- Catch 'em by candlelight.

820
01:48:20,751 --> 01:48:22,293
Have dinner with me.

821
01:48:23,212 --> 01:48:26,746
Alright, but Dutch treat
at the automat.

822
01:48:28,424 --> 01:48:31,923
I'm leaving my job.
Mr. Graydon isn't available anymore.

823
01:48:32,595 --> 01:48:34,386
Oh, corky!

824
01:48:34,805 --> 01:48:38,220
He's lost his heart
to a friend of ours.

825
01:48:38,642 --> 01:48:40,551
Miss Dorothy?
- How'd you guess?

826
01:48:40,977 --> 01:48:45,270
Who else do we both know? Muzzy?
- Dont blame Miss Dorothy.

827
01:48:45,689 --> 01:48:48,690
I really don't.
Mr. Graydon neither.

828
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:53,355
Love swamped them. We're too young
to live a life of hate.

829
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:57,358
You're the one who should be
on the stage. You're good.

830
01:48:58,701 --> 01:49:01,535
You don't seem to care.
- I know.

831
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:04,785
You fickle Freddy.

832
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:11,995
Thank you!
- You're welcome.

833
01:49:19,761 --> 01:49:20,792
John!

834
01:49:22,721 --> 01:49:26,304
Your ex-lover.
- Coming, Mr. Graydon.

835
01:49:28,602 --> 01:49:33,179
I'll pick you up at seven, and we
aren't dining Dutch treat.

836
01:49:33,606 --> 01:49:39,359
I'm taking you to Park Avenue for
the best-fed picnic ever.

837
01:49:44,032 --> 01:49:47,115
Nothing but the best for my date!

838
01:49:48,327 --> 01:49:50,734
Seven then?
- Seven.

839
01:49:51,163 --> 01:49:53,653
Bye.
- Bye.

840
01:50:03,799 --> 01:50:05,957
Butterfly boy!

841
01:50:07,302 --> 01:50:09,674
I may never go back
to elevators again.

842
01:50:51,757 --> 01:50:55,505
The lights have gone out of you.
- You pulled a switch.

843
01:50:55,927 --> 01:51:00,588
Dont you think washing dishes at
the most expensive restaurant a lark?

844
01:51:01,015 --> 01:51:03,303
We should have gone to the automat.

845
01:51:03,726 --> 01:51:07,937
It's stealing when a person
doesn't spend accordingly.

846
01:51:08,355 --> 01:51:11,141
With his girlfriends
a person should be honest.

847
01:51:11,566 --> 01:51:16,441
You're a dabbler, playing footloose
and fancy free to everyone,

848
01:51:16,862 --> 01:51:20,859
living moment to moment, never getting
involved, throwing yourself away,

849
01:51:21,282 --> 01:51:25,196
and you could be something...
- Alright, call Miss Dorothy

850
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:28,027
and ask her to bail us out.
- I'll do no such thing!

851
01:51:28,455 --> 01:51:32,832
She's got the money. She's very rich.
- A fortune hunter to boot!

852
01:51:33,251 --> 01:51:35,327
I'll pay it back.
- In paper clips?

853
01:51:35,753 --> 01:51:39,916
I'm going to call her.
You're not having a lark.

854
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:47,377
Got a nickel?
- No!

855
01:51:47,805 --> 01:51:50,474
The coffee klatsch
is running out of cups.

856
01:51:50,891 --> 01:51:54,177
I want you to take 'em that tray.

857
01:51:54,603 --> 01:51:57,722
Now, snappy! Hop, hop, hop!

858
01:52:11,034 --> 01:52:13,821
Good evening,
you needed cups?

859
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:21,828
Over there, honey.

860
01:52:53,487 --> 01:52:57,152
Mr. Graydon, I thought
you were at the Candlenook Room.

861
01:52:57,574 --> 01:52:59,531
She stood me up.

862
01:52:59,951 --> 01:53:05,325
I went to the hotel. The lady at
the desk said she'd checked out.

863
01:53:05,748 --> 01:53:07,206
That's it.

864
01:53:07,625 --> 01:53:10,246
No note, no forwarding address.

865
01:53:10,669 --> 01:53:11,700
Nothing.

866
01:53:13,505 --> 01:53:14,880
John, where is she?

867
01:53:15,631 --> 01:53:17,173
I don't know.

868
01:53:17,592 --> 01:53:19,465
How very strange!

869
01:53:21,345 --> 01:53:23,670
I'll get you some more coffee.

870
01:53:26,683 --> 01:53:30,846
Strong spirits!
- Not strong enough.

871
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:36,273
Just stop this. You'll upset
that lovely system of yours.

872
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:39,854
Come meet Jimmy.
Perhaps he can figure it out.

873
01:53:40,278 --> 01:53:44,026
Dear Miss Dorothy! Why should she
slip away like that?

874
01:53:45,532 --> 01:53:47,157
Come on.

875
01:53:47,576 --> 01:53:50,280
Dorothy wouldn't leave
without telling anyone her plans.

876
01:53:50,704 --> 01:53:53,621
I spoke to her this afternoon.
- So did I.

877
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:57,040
Damn. I'm sorry, Millie.
But something's up.

878
01:54:04,632 --> 01:54:06,292
You suspect foul play?
- I don't know.

879
01:54:06,717 --> 01:54:09,469
Could you come up with a jack?
- Good as done.

880
01:54:09,887 --> 01:54:15,093
I wanna search her room. Mrs. Meers
isn't telling the whole story. C'mon.

881
01:54:41,873 --> 01:54:46,036
You made it.
- I'm rarely a 2nd-story man.

882
01:54:49,713 --> 01:54:52,382
I'd best call the police in on this.

883
01:54:52,799 --> 01:54:56,843
Miss Brown certainly would have left
a thank-you note for the flowers.

884
01:54:57,261 --> 01:55:00,546
True. I wasn't at the desk
at the time she left.

885
01:55:00,973 --> 01:55:02,846
Let me check once again.

886
01:55:03,266 --> 01:55:05,342
Excuse me.

887
01:55:06,811 --> 01:55:09,681
I'm sure you've searched thoroughly,
and I...

888
01:55:10,106 --> 01:55:13,142
No, no,
the young clerk is so careless.

889
01:55:13,567 --> 01:55:19,439
The letter could be anywhere.
No one takes pride in their work.

890
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:34,580
Her checkbook.
She can't be far.

891
01:55:35,002 --> 01:55:37,041
And all her clothes.

892
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:40,831
She checked out without saying a word?
A girl doesn't do that.

893
01:55:41,258 --> 01:55:44,258
Ethel Peace did,
and Fanny did.

894
01:55:44,677 --> 01:55:47,512
Another girl
when I first moved in.

895
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:51,678
Jimmy, all of them were here
one day and gone the next.

896
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:54,093
Without a word to anyone...

897
01:55:54,519 --> 01:55:56,595
Except Mrs. Meers.

898
01:55:59,023 --> 01:56:02,890
Mrs. Meers! - Oh drat! Graydon was
supposed to keep her occupied.

899
01:56:03,318 --> 01:56:05,062
Quick, under the bed.

900
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:11,992
Another first.

901
01:56:54,905 --> 01:56:57,360
Something fearful is happening.

902
01:56:57,782 --> 01:56:59,609
The roses are doped.

903
01:57:03,829 --> 01:57:06,949
The laundry men
have been following Miss Dorothy.

904
01:57:07,374 --> 01:57:12,580
Remember when you met us?
The laundry truck was up the street.

905
01:57:13,004 --> 01:57:15,577
I'm afraid I only saw Dorothy.

906
01:57:16,715 --> 01:57:21,922
The Chinese work for Mrs. Meers.
She's into something big.

907
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:26,510
What do all the missing girls
have in common? Money?

908
01:57:26,932 --> 01:57:32,009
Ethel Peace didn't have anything, no
family, no friends. Neither did Fanny.

909
01:57:32,437 --> 01:57:37,015
I've forgotten about what's-her-name.
She was all alone, poor thing.

910
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:42,985
Mrs. Meers said it to Miss Dorothy
when she found out she was an orphan.

911
01:57:43,405 --> 01:57:47,402
What? - "Sad
to be all alone in the world."

912
01:57:47,826 --> 01:57:54,077
Sad for the victim, but convenient
for a vampire like Mrs. Meers.

913
01:58:00,003 --> 01:58:01,829
You think that...
- I do.

914
01:58:02,255 --> 01:58:03,749
You don't mean...
- I'm afraid.

915
01:58:04,173 --> 01:58:06,379
By now she could...
- Yes.

916
01:58:08,885 --> 01:58:11,174
Yes, Millie, true but cruel.

917
01:58:11,596 --> 01:58:15,889
If a girl is all alone and checks out,
who's to question her fate?

918
01:58:16,309 --> 01:58:20,555
But Miss Dorothys not alone.
She has us.

919
01:58:45,709 --> 01:58:49,658
That'll be 20, Miss.
- 20? - Cents, money.

920
01:58:50,088 --> 01:58:51,250
Oh, 20.

921
01:58:51,673 --> 01:58:54,626
Another Rockefeller.
What is it with you dames?

922
01:58:55,050 --> 01:58:59,048
Well I seem to have forgotten
my purse.

923
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:02,471
But well...
- Invest it for me. - Alright.

924
01:59:21,365 --> 01:59:23,441
John, snap to.

925
01:59:24,242 --> 01:59:26,815
Let's get organized.
- Yes, sir.

926
01:59:44,635 --> 01:59:46,212
Any mail for me?

927
01:59:46,637 --> 01:59:50,005
It's too early for mail.
You know that.

928
01:59:50,432 --> 01:59:52,508
Hello, I'm Millie Dillmount.

929
01:59:52,934 --> 01:59:55,425
I'm Mary James. I'm new here.

930
01:59:55,853 --> 01:59:57,929
I hope we'll be friends.

931
01:59:58,355 --> 02:00:00,976
So do I.
I don't know a soul in New York.

932
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:04,484
I don't know a soul anywhere.
Except at the orphanage.

933
02:00:05,028 --> 02:00:08,859
Oh, sad
to be all alone in the world.

934
02:00:10,366 --> 02:00:13,117
12th floor, dear.
- I'll show you the way.

935
02:00:54,446 --> 02:00:55,774
Pity!

936
02:01:02,411 --> 02:01:06,574
Well, thank you. I'll see you.
- Yes, alright.

937
02:01:29,309 --> 02:01:30,340
Millie?

938
02:01:36,524 --> 02:01:38,931
Oh, isn't Miss Dorothy here?

939
02:01:39,443 --> 02:01:42,396
No, I'm sorry. She's moved.
- Gee, that's too bad.

940
02:01:42,821 --> 02:01:45,821
I wanted to show her
how it turned out.

941
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:48,696
Apparently just splendid.
- Not bad.

942
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:51,988
Not bad at all.
- I thought they were fine,

943
02:01:52,412 --> 02:01:55,615
but Dickie likes jazz babies
with fronts.

944
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:58,827
As soon as that clot proposes,
out comes the cotton.

945
02:01:59,377 --> 02:02:01,453
See you in the shower.

946
02:02:20,103 --> 02:02:21,266
Millie?

947
02:02:24,107 --> 02:02:27,143
Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you, Mrs. Meers.

948
02:02:27,568 --> 02:02:29,560
This is for you.

949
02:02:29,987 --> 02:02:32,442
I made them up for all you girls.

950
02:02:32,864 --> 02:02:36,731
I can't wait to get acquainted,
not having folks or friends.

951
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:38,737
Of course.

952
02:02:39,161 --> 02:02:42,494
Now everything seems to be in order.

953
02:02:42,915 --> 02:02:45,785
Envelopes, stationery...

954
02:02:47,877 --> 02:02:50,202
There's a lovely pen
in the drawer, too.

955
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:55,006
If there's anything else you need
just let me know.

956
02:02:55,717 --> 02:02:58,338
I'll leave now, dear.

957
02:02:59,387 --> 02:03:02,341
So you can relax.

958
02:03:32,416 --> 02:03:33,958
Hey, Graydon.

959
02:03:38,212 --> 02:03:40,205
He's a healthy young animal,

960
02:03:40,631 --> 02:03:43,466
but he has the instincts of
a gentleman. I thought he'd ask me,

961
02:03:43,884 --> 02:03:46,209
but he says, "I'll take a kiss."

962
02:03:46,636 --> 02:03:49,209
I say, "Take a kiss,
and lose a lip."

963
02:03:49,639 --> 02:03:51,964
So he got fresh and lost a lip.

964
02:04:10,073 --> 02:04:14,071
I said, "See you in church"
and turned on the lights.

965
02:04:14,494 --> 02:04:16,570
See you later.
- Yes, bye.

966
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:21,912
Hey, Zelda.
I got some lips last night.

967
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:27,117
Hey, take a look at Miss America.
You like it?

968
02:04:49,983 --> 02:04:52,308
I love you, too, you funny nut.

969
02:04:57,323 --> 02:04:58,521
Jimmy?

970
02:04:59,575 --> 02:05:02,694
Jimmy, you're not pretending.

971
02:05:08,290 --> 02:05:10,330
Mr. Graydon!

972
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:18,715
Jimmy! Come on! Come on!

973
02:05:39,276 --> 02:05:44,482
She's not much, but a little dark
corner on the late, late shift.

974
02:06:35,157 --> 02:06:37,826
Mr. Graydon,
Jimmy's in the laundry basket.

975
02:06:39,202 --> 02:06:40,946
The laundry men.

976
02:06:42,372 --> 02:06:43,996
Mr. Graydon!

977
02:06:49,545 --> 02:06:52,664
I must speak to the Buddha.
Mrs. Meers.

978
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:32,368
Act like nothing happened.
Dont look now.

979
02:07:32,791 --> 02:07:38,129
You see that laundry truck?
Follow it.

980
02:07:40,714 --> 02:07:43,501
Mr. Graydon,
you're letting it get away.

981
02:07:45,301 --> 02:07:49,168
Mr. Graydon! ...Oh, Jimmy!

982
02:07:49,597 --> 02:07:51,506
Buddha? Meers here.

983
02:07:52,558 --> 02:07:58,809
In front of the hotel, a dark man
in a red roadster. Remove him.

984
02:08:05,652 --> 02:08:07,063
No!

985
02:08:13,451 --> 02:08:14,482
Now.

986
02:08:16,203 --> 02:08:17,745
That's the starter.

987
02:08:21,166 --> 02:08:23,123
That's the gas.

988
02:08:23,543 --> 02:08:25,619
There's the break.

989
02:08:27,463 --> 02:08:28,838
I hope.

990
02:08:29,965 --> 02:08:31,507
Stop!

991
02:08:31,925 --> 02:08:34,214
Stop! Millie!

992
02:08:35,386 --> 02:08:36,797
Taxi! Stop!

993
02:08:37,472 --> 02:08:38,586
Taxi!

994
02:08:40,933 --> 02:08:42,178
Just another first.

995
02:10:50,879 --> 02:10:56,121
I... beg your pardon. I'm looking
for a young man wearing a dress.

996
02:11:59,939 --> 02:12:01,101
Jimmy!

997
02:12:01,732 --> 02:12:02,763
Jimmy?

998
02:12:04,776 --> 02:12:07,018
Oh, Jimmy, darling.

999
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:12,781
Jimmy, wake up, dear.

1000
02:13:37,565 --> 02:13:41,692
But I don't have a nickel.
Not even my checkbook.

1001
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:46,986
Borrow? I believe you've
never been in a Chinese opium den.

1002
02:13:50,743 --> 02:13:52,367
Oh dear!

1003
02:14:24,230 --> 02:14:27,100
Dorothy!
- Miss Dorothy!

1004
02:14:30,903 --> 02:14:31,934
Help!

1005
02:14:32,988 --> 02:14:35,229
Somebody, please! Help!

1006
02:14:35,657 --> 02:14:37,982
Miss Dorothy!
- Help!

1007
02:14:38,409 --> 02:14:39,951
Miss Dorothy!

1008
02:14:53,672 --> 02:14:56,080
Miss Dorothy!

1009
02:14:57,134 --> 02:14:58,165
Jimmy!

1010
02:15:08,519 --> 02:15:11,804
Untie the others.
Hide until the police come.

1011
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:22,568
I'm Millie Dillmount. Have you seen
2 Chinese and a girl?

1012
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:28,445
A boy? A very tall girl? Miss Dorothy?
She's lovely with brown curls.

1013
02:15:28,870 --> 02:15:32,155
Yes, they're over there.
- Good. Help me untie the others!

1014
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:40,247
Miss Dorothy!
Did they have their way with you?

1015
02:15:40,838 --> 02:15:42,831
Well, really! Millie!

1016
02:15:44,216 --> 02:15:48,000
My beauty spot!
Dont tell me you weren't busy.

1017
02:15:48,762 --> 02:15:50,422
Where is he?

1018
02:15:50,847 --> 02:15:52,258
Come on!

1019
02:15:53,057 --> 02:15:55,512
Faster!

1020
02:15:56,519 --> 02:16:00,302
Hope he won't be an addict
with all that dope.

1021
02:16:00,731 --> 02:16:03,186
It didn't hurt Sleeping Beauty
or Snow White.

1022
02:16:11,823 --> 02:16:13,365
That way.

1023
02:16:18,204 --> 02:16:20,280
Put him in the rumble seat.

1024
02:16:26,211 --> 02:16:27,325
Trevor.

1025
02:16:27,754 --> 02:16:29,912
Front seat's taken.

1026
02:16:35,302 --> 02:16:36,761
Hey, money bags!

1027
02:16:50,357 --> 02:16:52,433
That's the gas...

1028
02:16:57,488 --> 02:17:00,654
No, forward, dear.
- I know.

1029
02:17:01,074 --> 02:17:05,866
Oh, it's Mrs. Meers.
Maybe she'd like a lift.

1030
02:17:17,714 --> 02:17:19,790
Get in!

1031
02:17:21,509 --> 02:17:23,715
After them!

1032
02:17:31,559 --> 02:17:34,050
Snap to! Let's get organized!

1033
02:17:43,945 --> 02:17:49,365
Aha, heading for Long Island
and their rich society friends.

1034
02:17:49,783 --> 02:17:53,650
The four-hundreds
could be missing a few.

1035
02:17:58,541 --> 02:18:01,458
My God, you two are dreary.

1036
02:18:05,964 --> 02:18:08,965
Your adventure sends a chill
over my heart.

1037
02:18:09,384 --> 02:18:13,084
To think of such ungentlemanly
behaviour in my darling New York.

1038
02:18:13,596 --> 02:18:17,889
Millie, I lift my glass
in humble tribute.

1039
02:18:18,308 --> 02:18:21,723
A miracle the way
you rebuffed those fatheads.

1040
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:25,021
Everyone of them must die.

1041
02:18:25,856 --> 02:18:28,264
How do you thank a hero?

1042
02:18:28,692 --> 02:18:32,736
I saved you selfishly
for myself.

1043
02:18:37,825 --> 02:18:41,692
First that interfering
Dillmount girl!

1044
02:18:49,585 --> 02:18:52,254
Shall we join the others? Please.

1045
02:18:58,468 --> 02:19:00,756
Shall we join the others?

1046
02:19:06,933 --> 02:19:07,847
Good evening.

1047
02:19:12,980 --> 02:19:14,973
Raspberry.

1048
02:20:00,647 --> 02:20:02,105
Wonderful!

1049
02:20:28,504 --> 02:20:29,355
Perfect!

1050
02:20:38,596 --> 02:20:39,627
Me?

1051
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:43,809
Please, don't think this frivolous.

1052
02:22:02,586 --> 02:22:03,499
Perfect!

1053
02:22:05,547 --> 02:22:07,622
Muzzy, honestly, you were...

1054
02:22:08,174 --> 02:22:11,044
My law instructors are arriving.

1055
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:14,427
My rock.

1056
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:20,259
Sad to be all alone in the world.

1057
02:22:39,993 --> 02:22:41,653
Oh, Jimmy, darling.

1058
02:23:17,109 --> 02:23:19,184
Get in here, Muzzy, you...

1059
02:23:32,038 --> 02:23:33,781
Muzzy, too?

1060
02:23:34,957 --> 02:23:38,824
Sure, you wanna join me?
And my sister and my stepmother.

1061
02:23:40,087 --> 02:23:43,206
Sister, stepmother?
- Though she's not old enough to be.

1062
02:23:46,884 --> 02:23:51,261
I've been blind.
- No, Jimmy is like his father.

1063
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,214
He didn't look like a real
multi-millionaire either.

1064
02:23:56,017 --> 02:23:59,765
You're not in paper clips?
- That's not far from the truth.

1065
02:24:00,187 --> 02:24:02,429
The fortune was founded in steel.

1066
02:24:03,816 --> 02:24:06,485
Oh, I don't understand.

1067
02:24:07,402 --> 02:24:12,609
Judith Tremaine chased Jimmy, and
every fortune hunter chased Dorothy.

1068
02:24:13,032 --> 02:24:16,317
I sent the children out
into the real world

1069
02:24:16,743 --> 02:24:20,492
with high hopes they'd come back
with sweet partners. And they did.

1070
02:24:20,914 --> 02:24:25,705
Your father would be so proud of you.
Jimmy, off with the mask.

1071
02:24:26,293 --> 02:24:30,456
James van Hosmere, 1st Vice President
of Van Hosmere Worldwide Enterprises.

1072
02:24:36,427 --> 02:24:39,962
You do have nice eyes.
- Be my stenog?

1073
02:24:40,889 --> 02:24:44,589
I don't want to be your equal.
I want to be a woman,

1074
02:24:45,018 --> 02:24:49,311
a dandy little bundle to cuddle.
You think Miss Dorothy has curls?

1075
02:24:49,730 --> 02:24:51,390
You wait.

1076
02:24:56,194 --> 02:24:57,736
What's the final word, Tea?

1077
02:24:58,196 --> 02:25:02,442
I've been watching her most close.
I approve.

1078
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:05,193
A good old-fashion girl.

1079
02:25:08,663 --> 02:25:12,957
Tea practically raised me.
So that does it. Almost.

1080
02:25:28,431 --> 02:25:31,182
What do you want
for a wedding present?

1081
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:33,509
A checkbook.

1082
02:25:33,935 --> 02:25:37,434
Rich people can nickel
and dime me to death.

1083
02:25:41,067 --> 02:25:44,186
Swell.
- Just swell.

1084
02:25:47,614 --> 02:25:52,275
Oh, this is my...
what do you teach?

1085
02:25:52,702 --> 02:25:55,987
Like a squirrel,
storing the nuts of life.
