1
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,790
Guenevere, Guenevere

2
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,120
In that dim, mournful year

3
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,460
Saw the men she heId so dear

4
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,800
Go to war for Guenevere

5
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,630
The rules of battIe are not for
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.

6
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,700
Let us attack now while they sIeep.

7
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,500
We will attack when
I give the command, at dawn.

8
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,450
Merlyn...

9
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,490
...why is Jenny in that castle...

10
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,890
...behind walls I cannot enter?

11
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,400
How did I blunder into this...

12
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
...agonizing absurdity?

13
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,150
When did I stumble?
Where did I go wrong?

14
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,980
Should I not have loved her?

15
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,490
Then I should not have been...

16
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,290
...born.

17
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,230
Oh, Merlyn...

18
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,660
...how did it happen?

19
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,220
I haven't got much time.

20
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
A thin inch of sunlight...

21
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,770
...the arrows begin to fly.

22
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,080
Merlyn...

23
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,310
...if I am to die...

24
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,950
...in battle...

25
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,090
...please do not let me die...

26
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,920
...bewildered.

27
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,190
Think, Arthur.

28
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
Think back.

29
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,350
Think back.

30
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,110
Think back!

31
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,990
Oh, Merlyn!

32
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,850
Think back.

33
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,000
Think back!

34
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,530
Think...

35
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,220
...back.

36
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,770
Back! To one of the most
important days of your life.

37
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, yes!

38
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,610
Hello.

39
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,320
My name is Arthur.

40
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,960
I think I'll call you...

41
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,630
...Wart.

42
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,690
""I think I'll call you Wart.""

43
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,030
No, no, no!

44
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,570
Now you've gone too far back.

45
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,810
Not the day you met me!

46
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,580
The day you met Guenevere.

47
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,350
The day she came...

48
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,250
...to Camelot.

49
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,620
That's the beginning.

50
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,790
Yes.

51
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,530
I know...

52
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,360
...what my people...

53
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,630
...are thinking tonight.

54
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,670
I know what my people
are thinking tonight

55
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,010
As home through the shadows they wander

56
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,250
Everyone smiling in secret deIight

57
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,920
As they stare at the castle and ponder

58
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,090
Whenever the wind blows this way

59
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,890
You can almost hear everyone say...

60
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,930
...I wonder what the king
is doing tonight

61
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,270
What merriment is the king
pursuing tonight?

62
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,780
The candles at the court
They never burned as bright

63
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,110
I wonder what the King
is up to tonight.

64
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,120
How goes the final hour
As he sees the bridal bower

65
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,790
Being legally and regally prepared?

66
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,120
WeII, I'll tell you what the king
is doing tonight

67
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,460
He's scared
Oh, he's scared

68
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,870
You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Whacked him in two and fixed his wagon

69
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,970
Goes to wed in terror and distress?

70
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh, yes!

71
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,640
A warrior who's so caIm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle

72
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,140
Faces a woman petrified with fright?

73
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,310
Right!

74
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,320
You mean the appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering

75
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,960
Is merely the banging
of his royal knees?

76
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,720
Please!

77
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,660
You wonder what the King
is wishing tonight?

78
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,160
He's wishing he were
in Scotland fishing tonight

79
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,000
What occupies his time
While waiting for his bride?

80
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,610
He's searching high and low
For some place to hide

81
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,840
And, oh, the expectation,
The sublime anticipation

82
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,010
He must feel about
the wedding night to come

83
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,680
WeII, I'll tell you what the King
is feeling tonight

84
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,690
He's numb! He shakes!
He quails! He quakes!

85
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,020
And that's what the King is doing

86
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,930
Tonight!

87
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,830
How long before we get to Camelot?

88
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,730
Soon, Ma'am, but don't look out there,
it's a ghastIy forest.

89
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,200
It's the most ferocious, savage...

90
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,470
...terrifying forest I've ever seen.

91
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,810
I simply adore it.

92
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,380
Does Your Ladyship not realize
that this forest is crawling...

93
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,710
...with outIaws and brigands?

94
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,580
Clary! You think there's
a chance of meeting one?

95
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,820
Don't say it, Ma'am.

96
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,060
It would be marvelous.

97
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,500
Imagine, Ma'am, soon you will
not only meet the man you will marry...

98
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,040
...but His Majesty,
King Arthur of EngIand.

99
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,730
And one is the other.
What have you to say to that?

100
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,940
Was there ever a more
inconvenient marriage of convenience?

101
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,690
I am at the golden age of seductability,
and is my fate seaIed with a kiss?

102
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,360
Is it?
No, sealed with a seal!

103
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,090
Where are all the simple joys
of maidenhood?

104
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,430
Where are all those
adoring, daring boys?

105
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,770
Where's the knight pining so for me?

106
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,270
He leaps to death in woe for me

107
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,050
Oh where are a maiden's simple joys?

108
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,290
Shan't I have the normal life
a maiden should?

109
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,630
Shall I never be rescued in the wood?

110
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,300
Shall two knights never tilt for me

111
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,800
And let their blood be spilt for me?

112
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,130
Oh, where are the simple joys

113
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,140
Of maidenhood?

114
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,480
Shall I never be disputed for

115
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,810
Or on any minstrel's lips?

116
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,690
Never have my face recruited for

117
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,460
Launching countless ships?

118
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,830
Where are the simple joys
of maidenhood?

119
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,000
Are those sweet, gentle pleasures
gone for good?

120
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,440
Shall a feud not begin for me?

121
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,170
Shall kith not kill their kin for me?

122
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,680
Oh where are the trivial joys?

123
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,520
Harmless, convivial joys?

124
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,190
Where are the simple joys

125
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,590
Of maidenhood?

126
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,190
Halt!

127
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,030
Her Highness will rest here
while the Royal Hairdresser...

128
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,670
...attends her.

129
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,400
Can someone help with this canopy?

130
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,780
I should like some tea
while I'm being coifed.

131
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,270
St. Genevieve

132
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,600
It's Guenevere

133
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,610
Remember me?

134
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,810
St. Genevieve

135
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,210
I'm over here, beneath this tree!

136
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,620
You know how faithful and devout I am

137
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,820
You must admit I've always been a lamb

138
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,300
But Genevieve, St. Genevieve.

139
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,570
I won't obey you any more
You've gone a bit too far

140
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,040
I won't be bid and bargained for
Like beads at a bazaar

141
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,170
St. Genevieve, I've run away
Eluded them and fled

142
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,280
And from now on I intend
To pray to someone else instead

143
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,990
Oh, Genevieve, St. Genevieve

144
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,320
Where were you when my youth was sold?

145
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,830
Dear Genevieve

146
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,030
Sweet Genevieve

147
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,500
Shan't I be young before I'm old?

148
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,550
A thousand pardons, my Iady.

149
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,380
Don't run, I won't harm you.

150
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,560
You lie! You'll leap on me
and throw me down!

151
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,060
I'll do no such thing.

152
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,520
You'll carry me off on your shoulder!

153
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,790
No, I swear by the sword Excalibur
I won't touch you.

154
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,190
Why not?

155
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,370
How dare you insult me in this fashion?
Do my looks repel you?

156
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,430
-No, you're beautiful!
-Did you hear me praying?

157
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,870
I couIdn't help it.
You did pray loudIy.

158
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,670
So you know who I am?

159
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,710
Yes, you're Guenevere.

160
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,150
So that accounts for your polite,
respectful, despicable behavior?

161
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,210
Why isn't Merlyn here?

162
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,720
-Who?
-Merlyn. He's my teacher.

163
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,220
He's the wisest man alive. He'd
know what to do. He lives backwards.

164
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,660
-Beg your pardon?
-He lives backwards.

165
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,730
He doesn't age.
He...

166
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,130
...youthens?

167
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,400
He can remember the future...

168
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,910
...so he can tell you
what you'll do in it.

169
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,610
Come here.

170
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,750
CIose your eyes.

171
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,060
PIease.

172
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,560
Now just turn, gently.

173
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,430
Very slowly, open them.

174
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,630
Do you see that castle?

175
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,610
It used to light up
in a sort of pink gIow.

176
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,950
When I was young,
everything looked a little pink to me.

177
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,330
When Merlyn left,
he took all the pink with him.

178
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,490
Don't stare.
It's rude.

179
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,200
Who are you?

180
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,740
Actually, they call me Wart, actually.

181
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,280
-You sure you heard them properly?
-It's a nickname. Merlyn gave it to me.

182
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,280
Is it really Wart?

183
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,930
Why don't you run away with me?

184
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,830
You could be my protector,
defend me all over the world...

185
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,300
...in France, in England,
Mongolia, Scotland.

186
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,770
What a wonderful dream you spin.

187
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,970
And how easy it would be for me
to be caught up in it.

188
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,670
But...

189
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,940
...I must decline.

190
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,920
You forcing me to stay?

191
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,510
Oh, no, My Lady!

192
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,550
If you persist in escaping, I'll find
somebody brave to accompany you.

193
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,060
Then do so at once before
your wretched king finds me.

194
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,030
Do look around you, My Lady!

195
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,230
Reconsider.

196
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,360
Camelot is unique.

197
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,530
And we have, by far and away,
the most equabIe climate in all EngIand.

198
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,900
Ordained by decree.

199
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,410
Oh, come now!

200
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,310
It's true.

201
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,250
It's true!

202
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,680
The Crown has made it clear

203
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,590
The climate must be perfect

204
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,020
All the year

205
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,560
A law was made
a distant moon ago here

206
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,730
July and August cannot be too hot

207
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,740
And there's a legal limit
to the snow here

208
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,230
In Camelot

209
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,040
The winter is forbidden till December

210
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,750
And exits March the second on the dot

211
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,420
By order, summer lingers
through September

212
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,420
In Camelot

213
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,260
Camelot

214
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,800
I know it sounds a bit bizarre

215
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,440
But in Camelot

216
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,580
That's how conditions are

217
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,450
The rain may never fall
till after sundown

218
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,620
By eight the morning fog must disappear

219
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,460
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

220
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,130
For happily-ever-aftering

221
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,840
Than here in Camelot

222
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,080
And I suppose the autumn leaves
fall into neat little piles?

223
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,750
No, My Lady.
They blow away completely.

224
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,650
At night, of course.

225
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,160
I know it gives a person pause

226
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,300
But in Camelot

227
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,680
Those are the legal laws

228
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,340
The snow may never
sIush upon the hillside

229
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,860
By nine p.m.
the moonlight must appear

230
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,860
In short, there's simply not

231
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,860
A more congenial spot

232
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,690
For happily-ever-aftering

233
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,700
Than here...

234
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,870
...in Camelot

235
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,050
Look!
There, on the hill!

236
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm truly sorry, but...

237
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,250
...I'm afraid, on account of me...

238
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,130
...you may be hanged!
Or burnt at the stake for abducting me!

239
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,770
That uncivilized king of yours wiII....
Defend yourseIf!

240
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,270
There she is!
But who's that peasant with her?

241
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,180
The king!

242
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,350
Wart, it's the king!

243
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,450
Your Majesty, forgive me.

244
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,550
I did not know it was you.

245
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,230
The king.

246
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,430
When I was a young Iad
of 18 years of age...

247
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,370
...our good king, Pendragon, died,
leaving no one to succeed him...

248
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,440
...but a sword stuck through an anvil
that stood on a stone.

249
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,770
Written on it,
in gold letters, it said...

250
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,640
...""Who so pulleth this sword
from this stone...

251
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,210
...is rightwise born
King of all England.""

252
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,450
Many chaps tried to
dislodge it, but they failed.

253
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,650
So finally, a great tournament was
proclaimed for New Year's Day.

254
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,920
AII the mightiest knights in EngIand
were assembled at one time to have...

255
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,820
...a go at the sword.

256
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,330
I went to London as squire
to my cousin, Sir Kay.

257
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,130
On tournament day, Sir Kay found
he had left his sword at home...

258
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,810
...and he gave me
a shilling to fetch it.

259
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,640
Going through London,
I passed a square and saw a sword...

260
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,310
...rising out of a stone.

261
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
Not thinking very clearly...

262
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,290
...I thought it was a war memorial.

263
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,700
So I decided to borrow it...

264
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,430
...and to save myself the trip.

265
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,130
So I...

266
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,780
...took the sword and...

267
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,540
...and I failed.

268
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,510
So I tried again.

269
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,870
And I failed again.

270
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,550
So, with all my might,
I closed my eyes...

271
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,880
...and I tried...

272
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,650
...one last time.

273
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,260
And, lo!

274
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,730
The sword moved in my hand.

275
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,930
And slowly...

276
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,230
...it slid out of the stone.

277
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,240
I heard...

278
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,710
...a great roar.

279
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,180
I opened my eyes.
The square was full of people saying:

280
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,080
""...Long live the king!
Long live...

281
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,520
...the king.""

282
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,600
That's how I became king.

283
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,670
I never knew I would be.
I never wanted to be.

284
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,370
And since I am,
I've been ill at ease in my crown.

285
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,770
Until I dropped from the tree...

286
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,350
...and my eyes...

287
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,280
...beheld you.

288
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,180
And then, for the first time...

289
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,950
...I felt like a king.
I was glad to be king.

290
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,520
And most astonishing of all,
I wanted to be the most heroic...

291
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,400
...the wisest, the most...

292
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,300
...splendid king ever to sit...

293
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,600
...on any throne.

294
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,090
If My Lady will follow me...

295
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,960
...I'll find a proper companion...

296
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,630
...to accompany you.

297
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,510
I hear it never rains

298
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,630
Till after sundown

299
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,360
By eight the morning fog
must disappear

300
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,870
In short, there's simply not

301
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,210
A more congenial spot

302
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,540
For happily-ever-aftering

303
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,220
...than here...

304
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,990
...In Camelot

305
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,260
The map of England.

306
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,930
Map, indeed.

307
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,470
A fishnet of ill-begotten kingdoms
ruled by immoral lords...

308
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,610
...battling with their own unlawful
armies over illegal border lines.

309
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,410
And who is...

310
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,480
...king of this...

311
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,010
...jungle?

312
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,110
The man who 4 years ago
pledged he would become...

313
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,880
...the greatest king
who ever sat on any throne.

314
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,990
I...

315
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,490
...Arthur of England.

316
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,250
Yes.

317
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,660
The greatest warrior in the land.

318
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,060
For what purpose?

319
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,290
Might...

320
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,370
...doesn't always mean right.

321
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,910
What are you saying? To be right
and lose couldn't possibly be right.

322
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,440
Merlyn...

323
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,580
...used to frown on battles.

324
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,720
Yet he always...

325
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,250
...helped me win them.

326
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,480
Why?

327
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,750
Proposition:

328
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,890
Is it far better to be alive than dead?

329
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,500
Yes, far better.

330
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,660
If that is so...

331
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,310
...then why do we have wars...

332
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,270
...in which people can get killed?

333
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,170
I don't know, do you?

334
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,640
Yes.

335
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,910
Because somebody attacks.

336
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,750
Why do they attack?

337
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,560
Did I ever tell you...

338
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,030
...how Merlyn taught me how to think?

339
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,490
No.

340
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,100
By changing me into animals.

341
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,630
Oh, really! Arthur!

342
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,780
Jenny, I mean by making me believe...

343
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,110
...he had changed me into animals.

344
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,580
For instance, when a hawk
is up there Iooking down at the world...

345
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,850
...there are no boundaries.

346
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,120
Right?

347
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,500
Yet boundaries are what
somebody aIways attacks about.

348
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,730
And you win by pushing them
back across something that...

349
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,470
...that doesn't exist.

350
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,670
So we have battles for no reason at all.
Why, Jenny, why?

351
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,810
Because ladies love knights.
To see your knight in armor....

352
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,480
That's it, Jenny.

353
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,880
Jenny, that is it!

354
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,350
It's the armor!

355
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,220
It's the armor, Jenny.
The armor.

356
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,590
OnIy the knights are rich enough
to have armor. The foot soIdiers....

357
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,160
WeII, they have nothing.

358
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,600
So, aII that can happen
to a knight is...

359
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,460
...an occasionaI...

360
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,260
...dent.

361
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,270
Proposition:

362
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,560
Right or wrong...

363
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,270
...if they have the might.
So right or wrong, they're aIways right.

364
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,740
That's wrong.
Right?

365
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,320
I'm here.

366
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,570
Suppose we create
a new order of chivaIry?

367
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,140
A new order where
might is onIy used for right.

368
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,840
To improve instead of to destroy.
We'II invite aII knights...

369
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,780
...and kings of aII kingdoms to Iay down
their arms to come and join us.

370
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,280
Oh, yes, Jenny.

371
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,980
And we'II...

372
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,280
...take one of the Iarge rooms
in the castIe...

373
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,580
...put a tabIe in it
and aII the knights wiII gather at it.

374
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,090
And do what?

375
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,720
TaIk across it.

376
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,960
Debate.

377
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,530
Make Iaws.
PIan improvements.

378
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,370
But, Arthur, do you think
aII the knights wiII ever want to...

379
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,580
...to do such a ridicuIousIy
peacefuI thing?

380
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,940
We'II make it a great honor.

381
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,180
Very fashionabIe.
Everyone wiII want to join.

382
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,880
OnIy now...

383
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,780
...the knights wiII whack onIy for good.

384
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,320
Might for right.

385
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,160
Might for right.

386
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,620
Might...

387
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,630
...for right!

388
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,490
That's it, Jenny!

389
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,340
Might....

390
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,370
No, not might is right!

391
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,670
Might...

392
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,010
...for...

393
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,140
...right!

394
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,450
It's very originaI.

395
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,620
And civiIized, Jenny.

396
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,160
It wiII have to be
an awfuIIy Iarge tabIe.

397
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,820
What of jeaIousy? AII wiII cIaim
superiority and want to sit at the head.

398
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,930
We'II make it...

399
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,330
...a round tabIe.

400
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,470
So there is no head.

401
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,340
A round tabIe!

402
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,050
My father's got one
that wouId be perfect. It seats 150.

403
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,630
He had it as a wedding present
and he never used it.

404
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,060
We'II send the heraIds
Riding through the country

405
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,730
TeII every Iiving person far and near

406
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,400
That there is simpIy not

407
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,410
In aII the worId a spot

408
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,740
Where ruIes a more respIendent king

409
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,350
Than here

410
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,080
In CameIot

411
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,700
CameIot

412
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,210
In far off France
I hear you caII

413
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,190
To you aIone I'II give my aII

414
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,400
I know in my souI
what you expect of me

415
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,570
And aII that and more
I shaII be

416
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,900
A knight of the tabIe round
ShouId be invincibIe

417
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,280
Succeed where a Iess fantastic man
WouId faiI

418
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,420
CIimb a waII no one eIse can cIimb
CIeave a dragon in record time

419
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,750
Swim a moat
In a coat of heavy iron maiI

420
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,920
No matter the pain
He ought to be unwinceabIe

421
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,760
ImpossibIe deeds
ShouId be his daiIy fare

422
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,600
But where in the worId

423
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,600
Is there in the worId

424
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,280
A man so extraordinaire?

425
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,610
C'est moi, c'est moi
I'm forced to admit

426
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,290
'Tis I
I humbIy repIy

427
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,790
That mortaI who these marveIs can do

428
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,260
C'est moi, c'est moi
'Tis I

429
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,500
I've never Iost
In battIe or game

430
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,940
I'm simpIy the best by far

431
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,040
When swords are crossed
'Tis aIways the same

432
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,710
One bIow and au revoir

433
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,880
C'est moi, c'est moi
So admirabIy fit

434
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,890
A French Prometheus Unbound

435
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,220
And here am I
With vaIor untoId

436
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,560
ExceptionaIIy brave

437
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,060
AmazingIy boId

438
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,900
To serve at the tabIe round

439
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,370
The souI of a knight
ShouId be a thing remarkabIe

440
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,600
His heart and his mind
As pure as morning dew

441
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,720
With a wiII and a seIf-restraint
That's the envy of every saint

442
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,550
He couId easiIy work a miracIe or two

443
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,160
To Iove and desire
He ought to be unsparkabIe

444
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,060
The ways of the fIesh
ShouId offer no aIIure

445
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,070
But where in the worId
Is there in the worId

446
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,410
A man so untouched

447
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,140
And pure?

448
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,090
C'est moi
I bIush to discIose

449
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,910
I'm far too nobIe to Iie

450
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,200
That man in whom
These quaIities bIoom

451
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,920
C'est moi, C'est moi
'Tis I

452
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,240
I've never strayed
From aII I beIieve

453
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,770
I'm bIessed with an iron wiII

454
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,980
Had I been made
The partner of Eve

455
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,620
We'd be in Eden stiII

456
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,120
C'est moi, c'est moi
The angeIs have chosen

457
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,950
To fight their battIes beIow

458
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,290
And here am I
As pure as a prayer

459
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,600
IncredibIy cIean

460
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,030
With virtue to spare

461
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,700
The godIiest man I know
C'est moi!

462
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,800
Oh, King Arthur!

463
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,770
What caIiber of man you must be...

464
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,340
...to have envisioned
a new order of Iife.

465
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,680
I worship you before knowing you.

466
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,170
Don't run away, coward!

467
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,610
Come back and fight!

468
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,640
The swine!

469
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,080
-Are you hurt, Your Majesty?
-Fine.

470
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,620
PIease!

471
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,520
The next time you traffic with me...

472
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,720
...remember, you chaIIenge
the right arm of King Arthur.

473
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,100
ReaIIy?

474
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,370
I am King Arthur.

475
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,330
What?

476
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,440
You...

477
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,770
...are the king!

478
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,220
Yes, aImost the Iate king.

479
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,680
And I struck you?

480
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,590
Your Majesty!

481
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,560
I'm LanceIot du Lac.

482
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:29,040
In France I heard of your new order
and came to join.

483
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,400
I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.

484
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,000
Not because I deserve it...

485
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,610
...but because by forgiving me...

486
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,110
...I'II suffer more.

487
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,040
But, reaIIy, dear chap...

488
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,810
...I don't want you to suffer at aII.

489
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,950
I want to congratuIate you.
PIease rise. You, too, squire.

490
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,920
I can't, mon roi.

491
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,990
-I'm too ashamed to Iift my head.
-WeII, then I command you.

492
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,260
I have never feIt
a bash in my chest quite Iike it.

493
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,200
It was most spectacuIar.
Where did you Iearn to do it?

494
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,970
My skiII comes from training, mon Roi.

495
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,110
My strength from purity.

496
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:11,250
WeII, that's a unique recipe.

497
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,040
He's a unique man, Your Majesty.

498
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,150
At the age of fourteen
he couId defeat any jouster in France.

499
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,350
His father, King Ban,
made me his squire.

500
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,080
King Ban?

501
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,520
In France?

502
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,320
What did you say your name was?

503
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,190
LanceIot du Lac, Your Majesty.

504
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,700
You're LanceIot?
I was toId you were coming.

505
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,040
You were toId?

506
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,240
By MerIyn, the court magician.

507
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,810
He said to me one day...

508
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,250
...""Keep your eye out for a Frenchman
caIIed LanceIot du Lac.

509
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,910
He wiII come to the court of CameIot
and he wiII be....""

510
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,020
What was it now?

511
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,490
""He wiII be....""

512
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,930
Your aIIy, if you'II take me.

513
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,600
Your friend, who asks no friendship.

514
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,070
Your defender when you need one...

515
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,760
...whose body is your sword to brandish.

516
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,470
Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty?

517
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,240
For aII that, I am.

518
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,610
ReaIIy, my dear feIIow...

519
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,580
...this is far more
than I couId wish for...

520
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,420
...or even ask.

521
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,120
Then you wiII accept me?

522
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,450
Without hesitation.

523
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,560
-We wiII arrange for your knighthood.
-Oh, thank you!

524
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,270
We must arrange for
your knighthood immediateIy.

525
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,500
No, Your Majesty.
AII you know of me is words.

526
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,440
Invest me because of deeds, sire.
Give me an order.

527
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,940
-Now?
-This moment.

528
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,270
Send me on a mission.
Is there some wrong I can right?

529
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,680
Some enemy I can battIe?
Some periI I can undertake?

530
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,750
WeII, actuaIIy,
there's not much going on today.

531
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,230
It's the first of May. The Queen and
some of the court have gone a-Maying.

532
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,020
Gone a-Maying?

533
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,730
Yes, it's a sort of...

534
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,840
...picnic?

535
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,000
They eat berries
and chase young girIs around--

536
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:21,140
It's a custom we have here.

537
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,780
This is EngIand, you know.

538
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,640
And this is the season
for gathering fIowers.

539
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,110
Knights gathering fIowers?

540
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,650
WeII, someone has to do it!

541
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,620
And besides, it's....

542
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,620
It's civiIized.

543
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,730
And civiIization shouId have...

544
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,920
...a few gentIe hobbies.

545
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,130
Come.

546
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,800
I want you to meet the queen.

547
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,210
Dap, take the horses and feed them.

548
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,050
By George!

549
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,360
I suddenIy remembered
what MerIyn said of you.

550
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,460
How strange!

551
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,130
He said that you wouId be the
greatest knight ever to sit at my tabIe.

552
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,900
That was Iong before
I thought of a tabIe.

553
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,670
So he knew it wouId exist.

554
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,180
Oh, dear!
I thought he meant a dining tabIe.

555
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,970
But he meant this.

556
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,650
The Round TabIe!

557
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,840
And I have stumbIed on my future.

558
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,450
I've done...

559
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,320
...the right thing.

560
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,290
Did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty?

561
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,120
Of course.

562
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,550
OnIy fooIs...

563
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,290
...never doubt.

564
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,560
WeIcome, LanceIot.

565
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,670
BIess you for coming.

566
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,030
WeIcome to my tabIe.

567
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,910
It's May

568
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,550
It's May

569
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,360
The Iusty month of May

570
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,830
That IoveIy month

571
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,730
When everyone goes

572
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,270
BIissfuIIy astray

573
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,600
It's here, it's here

574
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,240
That shocking time of year

575
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,640
When tons of wicked IittIe thoughts

576
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,650
MerriIy appear

577
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,010
It's May!

578
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,990
That gorgeous hoIiday

579
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,950
When every maiden itches for fun

580
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,790
WhoIesome or ""un""

581
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,620
It's mad!

582
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,630
Depraved in every way

583
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,470
Those dreary vows that everyone takes
Everyone breaks

584
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,440
Everyone makes divine mistakes

585
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,010
The Iusty month of May

586
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,920
The Iusty month of May

587
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,260
That darIing month when everyone throws

588
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,390
SeIf-controI away

589
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,890
It's time to do

590
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,730
A wretched thing or two

591
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,000
And try to make each precious day

592
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,670
One you'II aIways rue

593
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,010
The month of ""Yes, you may.""

594
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,240
A time for every

595
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,750
FrivoIous whim

596
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,850
Proper or ""im.""

597
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,280
It's wiId!

598
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,120
It's wiId! It's gay!

599
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,890
A IibeIous dispIay

600
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,190
The birds and bees

601
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,850
WiII aII of their vast
Amorous past

602
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:39,370
Gaze at the human race
Aghast!

603
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,270
The Iusty

604
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,870
Month of May!

605
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,820
Now then...

606
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,990
...which way to go?

607
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,320
North.

608
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,550
No, no, that's north.

609
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,920
No, that's north.

610
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:22,270
I'm compIeteIy Iost.

611
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,330
Who's that rusty oId feIIow?

612
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,710
I've never seen him before,
Your Majesty.

613
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,280
Offer him assistance.

614
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,450
That mountain seems famiIiar.

615
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,820
Let's see.

616
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,820
Good day, my Iord.

617
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,450
How do you do, young man.
The name of King PeIIinore here.

618
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,220
You are a king, sire?

619
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,090
Of what country?

620
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,770
I don't know.
I Iost my kingdom.

621
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,770
To whom?

622
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,170
WeII, I misIaid it.
I Ieft it somewhere and I....

623
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,480
I can't find my way back.

624
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,920
-Why, I beIieve him.
-Your Majesty!

625
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,990
Your Majesty?

626
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,090
Yes, my Iord. You are addressing
Her Majesty, the Queen of EngIand.

627
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,730
The queen?
Why, why! How do you do?

628
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,600
Forgive me, Ma'am.
The beastIy hinges need oiIing.

629
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,600
Be at ease, my Iord.
WeIcome to CameIot.

630
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,670
Haven't I been here before?

631
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,510
Yes, years ago. I spent a joIIy
fortnight with a fine IittIe feIIow...

632
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,510
...caIIed Wart.
Ever met him, Ma'am?

633
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,110
ConstantIy.
He's my husband.

634
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,620
King Arthur of EngIand.

635
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:50,120
The King? Is he?

636
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,830
WeII, weII! Is he?
By Jove, good for him!

637
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:57,300
That's what I caII weII done.
Imagine. The king!

638
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,040
And he knows the name
of what he's king of.

639
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,000
Arthur wouId be pIeased to see you.
WouId you care to spend the night?

640
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,870
What, in a bed?
In a reaI bed?

641
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,310
Damnation, I'd Iike that.

642
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,850
I haven't put spine to feathers
since I Ieft....

643
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,640
Since I Ieft....

644
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,460
Go, one of you.
Escort His Majesty to the castIe.

645
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,890
I'm very gratefuI to you, Ma'am.

646
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,390
Thank you, very much.

647
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,410
I want to present to you
LanceIot du Lac.

648
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,310
He's come aII the way from France
to join our TabIe.

649
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,590
This is the LanceIot
that MerIyn used to speak of.

650
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,560
You're most weIcome.

651
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,330
I'm honored to be among you, miIady.

652
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:05,160
And aIIow me to pIedge my eternaI
dedication to this nobIe cause.

653
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:08,170
Thank you, monsieur.
Arthur, I met this strange man--

654
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,640
This spIendid dream
must become a universaI reaIity.

655
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,900
What?

656
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:15,580
AbsoIuteIy. It reaIIy must.

657
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,400
I have assured the king
he may caII upon me...

658
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,880
...at any time to perform any deed,
no matter the danger.

659
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,020
Thank you, monsieur.
That's most comforting.

660
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,660
I'm aIways on duty.

661
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,320
Yes, I can see that.

662
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,390
I wouId Iove to come to Iunch...

663
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,000
...but I want to Iisten to the pIans
that we have been discussing.

664
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,130
ExpIain it.

665
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,570
-To the queen, sire?
-Yes, of course.

666
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,260
WouId not Madame find it tedious?

667
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:47,070
I have never found chivaIry tedious.

668
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,210
So far.

669
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,250
May I remind you...

670
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:55,180
...that the Round TabIe happens to be
the idea of my husband.

671
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,080
My husband's idea.

672
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,560
Any idea, miIady...

673
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,820
...however exaIted, couId be improved.

674
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,700
-ReaIIy?
-Of course.

675
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,930
I've suggested that we create
a training program for knights.

676
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,590
-Isn't that a marveIous idea, Jenny?
-A training program?

677
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,710
The Round TabIe must have a standard.

678
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,210
A standard physicaI
and a standard moraI.

679
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,540
And whose abiIities wouId serve
as a standard, monsieur?

680
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,620
Oh, certainIy not mine, miIady.

681
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,320
It wouId not be fair.

682
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,180
Not fair? In what way?

683
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:37,590
I wouId never ask anyone to Iive
by my standards, miIady.

684
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,520
To devote your Iife...

685
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:44,500
...to the tortured quest
for perfection in body and spirit.

686
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,100
I wouId not ask that of anyone.

687
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,800
No, nor wouId I.

688
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,600
And have you achieved perfection,
monsieur?

689
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,430
PhysicaIIy, yes, miIady.

690
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,250
But the refining of the souI
is an endIess struggIe.

691
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,820
I dare say. I do daresay.

692
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,550
Do you mean you've never been
defeated in battIe or in a tournament?

693
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,220
No, Your Majesty.

694
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,460
And I gather...

695
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,400
...you consider it unIikeIy
ever to happen in the future?

696
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,770
HighIy, Your Majesty!

697
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,900
How was the channeI, LanceIot?
Was it a good crossing?

698
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,300
TeII me a IittIe of your struggIe
for the perfection of the spirit.

699
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:34,140
Have you jousted with humiIity IateIy?

700
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,940
""HumiIity,"" miIady?

701
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,550
HumiIité.

702
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,380
Or isn't it fashionabIe
in France this year?

703
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,400
We had best discuss the program
eIsewhere. You Iook too beautifuI...

704
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,530
...to have anything on your mind
other than froIic and fIowers.

705
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,760
Have a IoveIy day.
Same to aII of you.

706
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,560
Come aIong, LanceIot.

707
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,140
Come quickIy.

708
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,970
Good day, my queen.

709
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,380
-Mon dieu, he's unpIeasant.
-And so poisonousIy good.

710
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,220
He probabIy waIked across the channeI.

711
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,550
Sir Dinadan?

712
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,300
When is the next tournament?

713
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,100
A week from Saturday, Your Majesty.

714
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,800
And who are the 3 best jousters we have?

715
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,580
Sir LioneI, Sir Sagramore...

716
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,680
...and with aII humiIitay...

717
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,890
...I, Your Majesty.

718
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,590
ReaIIy?

719
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,710
Sir LioneI?

720
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,140
Do you recaII the other night
That I distinctIy said you might

721
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:16,110
Serve as my escort
At the next town fair?

722
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,950
WeII, I'm afraid there's someone
Who I must invite in pIace of you

723
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,620
Someone who pIainIy is
Beyond compare

724
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:27,460
The Frenchman's power is more tremendous

725
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,130
Than I have ever seen anywhere

726
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,800
And when a man is that stupendous

727
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,470
He, by right, shouId take me
To the fair

728
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,310
Your Majesty, Iet me tiIt with him
And smite him

729
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,970
Don't refuse me so abruptIy
I impIore

730
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,820
Oh, give me the opportunity
To fight him

731
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:54,150
And GauI wiII be divided
Once more

732
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,280
You wiII bash and thrash him?

733
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,560
I wiII smash and mash him!

734
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,000
You'II give him troubIe?

735
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,170
He wiII be rubbIe.

736
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,040
A mighty whack?

737
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,300
His skuII wiII crack!

738
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,340
Then you may

739
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,340
Take me to the fair

740
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:25,020
If you do aII the things
You promise

741
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,350
In fact, my heart wiII break
ShouId you not take me

742
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,180
To the fair

743
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,620
Sir Sagramore?

744
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,040
I have some rather painfuI news
ReIative to the subject who's

745
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,870
To be beside me at the next court baII

746
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,170
You were the chosen one, I know
But it's tradition it shouId go

747
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,210
To the unquestioned champion
In the haII

748
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:58,380
And I'm convinced
That spIendid Frenchman

749
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,720
Can easiIy conquer one and aII

750
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:07,530
And besting aII our IocaI
Henchmen, he

751
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,560
ShouId sit beside me
At the baII

752
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,340
I beg of you, Ma'am
WithhoId your invitation

753
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,400
I swear to you this chaIIenge
WiII be met

754
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,800
And when I have finished up
The operation

755
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,580
I shaII serve him to Your Highness
En brochette

756
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,210
You'II pierce right through him?

757
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,180
I'II barbecue him!

758
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,090
A wicked thrust?

759
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,490
It wiII be dust to dust.

760
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,890
From fore to aft?

761
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,320
He'II feeI...

762
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,190
...a draft.

763
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,330
My goodness!

764
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,600
You may sit

765
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,900
By me at the baII

766
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:58,270
If you demoIish him
In battIe

767
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,610
In fact, I know I'd cry
Were you not by me

768
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,610
At the baII

769
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,920
Sir Dinadan?

770
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,100
Didn't I promise that you may
Guide me to London on the day

771
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,800
That I go up to judge
The cattIe show

772
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,980
As it is quite a nasty ride
There must be someone by my side

773
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,650
Who'II be defending me
From beast and foe

774
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,650
So when I choose whom I prefer go

775
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,650
I take the strongest knight I know

776
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,220
And young du Lac seems strongest
Ergo

777
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,120
He shouId

778
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,260
Take me to the cattIe show

779
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,660
Your Majesty can't beIieve
This bIustering prattIe

780
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,170
Let him prove it
With a sword or Iance instead

781
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:00,080
I promise you when I'm done
This gory battIe

782
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,200
His shouIders wiII be Ionesome
For his head

783
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,550
You'II disconnect him?

784
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,810
I'II vivisect him!

785
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,940
You'II open wide him?

786
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,350
I'II subdivide him!

787
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:20,020
Then you may guide me
To the show

788
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,860
If you can carry out
Your program

789
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,200
In fact, I'd grieve inside
ShouId you not guide me

790
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,030
To the show

791
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,880
MiIady,
We shaII put an end to

792
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,870
That GaIIic bag of noise
And nerve

793
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,050
When we do aII that we
Intend to

794
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:47,050
He'II be a pIate of French
Hors d'oeuvres

795
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,060
I do appIaud your nobIe goaIs

796
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,560
Now Iet us see if you
Achieve them

797
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,400
And if you do
Then you wiII be the three

798
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,740
Who wiII go to the baII
To the show

799
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,400
And take me

800
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,680
To the fair

801
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,000
My Iords!

802
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,910
Have you seen the Iatest edict?
Tis the finaI straw.

803
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,440
Knights who refuse to Iay down
their arms wiII be attacked...

804
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,280
...as if they were serfs.

805
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:52,480
We're not onIy to kiII foot soIdiers,
but knights as weII.

806
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,880
We know aII about it, Dinadan.

807
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,560
But these other knights...

808
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,400
...if they fight back...

809
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,030
...we couId be kiIIed.

810
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,840
What's the sense of being born
in the upper cIass...

811
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,480
...if you can get kiIIed
Iike the Iower cIass?

812
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,510
It has the stink of French cooking.

813
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,580
After Saturday...

814
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:27,020
...we shaII be back
on Yorkshire pudding.

815
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,020
PeIIy, why don't you...

816
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:34,020
...give up searching for your kingdom...

817
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:36,460
...and come settIe down
with us for good?

818
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:39,030
That's joIIy kind of you, Arthur.

819
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,360
I mean, I Iove the bed and aII that...

820
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,300
...but the truth is I don't find things
too restfuI around here.

821
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,980
I can't heIp wishing
that you'd stop...

822
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,540
...thinking...

823
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,650
...and Ieave weII enough aIone.

824
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:55,340
I'm aII against
these new ideas of yours.

825
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,820
Any new ideas.

826
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:02,950
Best peopIe whacking best peopIe.
That's not right. That's not.

827
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:06,650
The chaps downstairs,
they're gnashing mad.

828
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,160
Gnashing.

829
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,360
It's aII his fauIt, you know.

830
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,700
Emperor CharIemagne there.

831
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,240
He has no activities,
that's his troubIe.

832
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,910
No secuIar pIeasures.

833
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,870
Quiet, PeIIy!

834
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,250
But do you not have any activities?

835
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,410
Any hobbies? Any...

836
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,690
...chambre à coucher?

837
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,160
No, PeIIinore.

838
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,800
There, you see.
Do you see?

839
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,730
Now why can't he be Iike the other chaps
instead of Iike himseIf?

840
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,000
Why can't he come home of an evening,
hang up his shieId...

841
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,700
...and do something
that he can be ashamed of?

842
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,670
You sure he's French?

843
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,280
I'm afraid my Iord is right.

844
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,860
AII fanatics are irritating, PeIIinore.

845
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,360
And I am a fanatic.

846
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,460
And I don't enjoy it
any more than you do.

847
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,840
Didn't you have a change to suggest?

848
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:37,050
We can discuss my idea tomorrow.
If you wiII excuse me.

849
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:51,290
WhiIe I was napping, did I miss
any improvements in chivaIry?

850
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,500
No, miIady.
If you wiII excuse me--

851
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:00,340
Monsieur, when you're arranging things
with God tonight...

852
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,640
...do be sure to give us
fine weather tomorrow.

853
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,690
Good night, sire.

854
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,150
Good night, PeIIinore.

855
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,850
Good night.

856
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:29,100
Heard the Iatest? He beIieves
his purity gives him miracuIous powers.

857
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,370
He was undoubtedIy referring
to his physicaI prowess.

858
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,200
Which is vast, indeed.

859
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,110
We'II see about that tomorrow.

860
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:43,270
Sagramore, LioneI and Dinadan
have aII chaIIenged him to a joust.

861
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,110
Three damn strong men!

862
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,180
-AII three in one day?!
-Quite, exactIy.

863
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,490
Isn't it marveIous? MarveIous!

864
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,160
ExactIy, yes!

865
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,490
I teII you, Arthur.

866
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,260
I've never met anyone Iike him.

867
01:09:58,470 --> 01:09:59,590
I mean...

868
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,530
...he has no Iady.

869
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,440
TaIks to no one but you and God...

870
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,970
...crammed fuII of reIigion,
an aII-around unpIeasant feIIow.

871
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,080
I can't wait untiI tomorrow.
It'II be a joIIy massacre.

872
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,850
Good night, Ma'am.

873
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:19,350
I'm reaIIy Iooking forward to it.
It's going to be marveIous.

874
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:24,860
A note of thanks from Sir LioneI.

875
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,530
I've promised he can carry
my kerchief in the joust tomorrow.

876
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,830
I wouId be most gratefuI if you...

877
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,100
...wouId withdraw your permission
from Sir LioneI.

878
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,610
I don't think I couId.
It wouId be rather awkward.

879
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:46,150
Then aIIow LanceIot
to carry it against Sagramore.

880
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,270
-I've promised my kerchief to him.
-Then against Dinadan?

881
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:53,820
I've promised him too.
He asked so prettiIy, I couIdn't refuse.

882
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,150
This is appaIIing!

883
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,950
It wiII seem to the court
that you are championing his defeat.

884
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,000
Perhaps he won't be. He knocked
you unconscious. You became friends.

885
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,570
He may knock them out,
and they'II aII take a house together.

886
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,500
I reaIize he's having
a difficuIt time adjusting.

887
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,170
But he's a stranger.

888
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:14,070
He's not even EngIish.
He's French.

889
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,250
WeII, he suffers in transIation.

890
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,940
I ask you--

891
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,480
I beIieve you're jeaIous of the knights
and their attentions to me.

892
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,920
JeaIous?
What absoIute rubbish!

893
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,950
You know I am deIighted
the court adores you so.

894
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,130
I trust you as God above.

895
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,030
You have dragged me off the subject
and I want you back on it.

896
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:36,720
WiII you withdraw those kerchiefs?

897
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:38,730
OnIy if you command me as king.

898
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:43,530
If I do...

899
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,830
...wiII you forgive me?

900
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:47,970
Never.

901
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,170
Then, if I ask you as a husband,
wiII you as a favor?

902
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,870
I find him overbearing and pretentious.
The knights are against him.

903
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:59,380
Can we not stay on the subject?

904
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,720
There's nothing more to be said.

905
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,490
If the king wishes me to withdraw
what I have given...

906
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,860
...Iet him command me
and Yours HumbIy wiII graciousIy obey.

907
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:40,160
BIast you, MerIyn!
This is aII your fauIt!

908
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,920
You swore that you had taught me
Everything from A to Z

909
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,230
With nary an omission in between

910
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:49,800
WeII, I shaII teII you what
You obviousIy forgot

911
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,570
That's how a ruIer ruIes a queen

912
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,210
And what of teaching me
By turning me to animaI and bird

913
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,510
From beaver
To the smaIIest boboIink?

914
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,950
I shouId have had a whirI
At changing to a girI

915
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,720
To Iearn the way the creatures think

916
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,830
But wasn't there a night

917
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,230
On a summer Iong gone by

918
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,200
We passed a coupIe
WrangIing away

919
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,840
And did I not say

920
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,610
MerIyn
What if that chap were I

921
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:35,880
And did he not give counseI
And say

922
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,710
What was it now?

923
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,890
Oh, my mind's a waII

924
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,950
Oh, yes! By Jove!

925
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,290
Now I recaII

926
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:54,800
How to handIe a woman

927
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:00,370
There's a way
Said the wise oId man

928
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,310
A way known by every woman

929
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:10,320
Since the whoIe rigmaroIe began

930
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:15,150
Do I fIatter her
I begged him answer

931
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,490
Do I threaten or cajoIe or pIead

932
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:24,660
Do I brood or pIay the gay romancer

933
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,900
Said he, smiIing
No, indeed!

934
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,940
How to handIe a woman

935
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,340
Mark me weII
I wiII teII you, sir

936
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:46,340
The way to handIe a woman

937
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,510
Is to Iove her

938
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,830
SimpIy

939
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,430
Love her

940
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:01,530
MereIy Iove her

941
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,370
Love her

942
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,450
What's wrong, Jenny?

943
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,860
Where are you these days?

944
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,860
What are you thinking?

945
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,530
I don't understand you.

946
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,940
But no matter.
MerIyn toId me once...

947
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:48,810
...""Never be disturbed if you don't
understand what a woman is thinking.""

948
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,950
""They don't do it very often.""

949
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:54,750
But what do you do
whiIe they're doing it?

950
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,760
How to handIe a woman

951
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:09,270
Mark me weII
And I'II teII you, sir

952
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,770
The way to handIe a woman

953
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:19,780
Is to Iove her

954
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,110
SimpIy

955
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,790
Love her

956
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:32,780
MereIy Iove her

957
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,620
Love her

958
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,530
Just...

959
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,840
...Iove her.

960
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,620
Here comes Sir LioneI.

961
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,500
One.

962
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:40,750
Watch the way Sir Sagramore maneuvers
his horse. It's extraordinary.

963
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,680
You see how he drives to the right?
And then suddenIy....

964
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,610
How cIever!

965
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,910
He maneuvered his horse
right out from under himseIf.

966
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,650
What controI!

967
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:25,470
Two, Jenny.

968
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,730
He's dead, Jenny.

969
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,160
PIease!

970
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,500
Live!

971
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:53,160
Live!

972
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,980
I beg you.

973
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,750
He Iives!

974
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,790
I'm trembIing with fear.

975
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,600
And the strength...

976
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,630
...has Ieft my arms.

977
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,500
And terribIe feeIings...

978
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,900
...burn within me.

979
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,370
TeII me.

980
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,170
You're oIder than I.

981
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,380
You know this earth...

982
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:58,250
...better than I.

983
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,990
I onIy feII upon it...

984
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,120
...a few hours ago.

985
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:12,230
What are you taIking about?

986
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:16,640
Guenevere.

987
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,350
Wait, PeIIy.

988
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,990
You've never been in Iove...

989
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:39,630
...have you, PeIIy?

990
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:41,320
Once.

991
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:45,590
But not IateIy.
Now I'm not young enough.

992
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:47,700
Or not oId enough.

993
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,900
And I'm too young and too oId.

994
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:55,010
Too oId not to know that fears...

995
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:57,370
...can be imaginary.

996
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:02,080
And too young not to be...

997
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,120
...tormented by them.

998
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,960
Forgive me, miIady,
for disturbing you.

999
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,980
CIarinda toId me
Arthur was expected here.

1000
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,240
Yes, he is.

1001
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,100
I Iove you.

1002
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,000
God forgive me...

1003
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:33,500
...but I do!

1004
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:41,310
Then God forgive us both, Lance.

1005
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,050
What a gIorious day!

1006
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,360
This is your day, Lance.

1007
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:51,920
And at Iast you shaII receive...

1008
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:55,260
...your earned and proper knighthood.

1009
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:07,070
UnfortunateIy,
sainthood is not in my power.

1010
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:14,340
Before the ceremony, we three
wiII have a nice quiet drink together.

1011
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,120
It was on such a day as this...

1012
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,810
...that the idea of the Round TabIe
was given birth.

1013
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,260
Remember, Jenny?

1014
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,370
To the Round TabIe!

1015
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,020
To be invested...

1016
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:40,680
...Knight of the Round TabIe
of EngIand...

1017
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:45,030
...of the CastIe of Joyous Gard...

1018
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,290
...LanceIot du Lac.

1019
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:58,500
ExcaIibur.

1020
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,180
Arise...

1021
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:15,820
...Sir LanceIot.

1022
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,710
Proposition:

1023
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,350
If I couId choose...

1024
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,890
...from every woman
who breathes on this earth...

1025
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,610
...the face I wouId most Iove...

1026
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:02,220
...the smiIe, the touch, the heart...

1027
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,060
...the voice, the Iaugh,
the souI itseIf...

1028
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:09,930
...every detaiI and feature
to the Iast strand of the hair...

1029
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:12,270
...they wouId aII be Jenny's.

1030
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:14,670
Proposition:

1031
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:19,410
If I couId choose from every man
who breathes on this earth...

1032
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:21,980
...a man for my brother...

1033
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:24,080
...a man for my son...

1034
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:27,310
...and a man for my friend...

1035
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,150
...they wouId aII be Lance.

1036
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,680
I Iove them.

1037
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,930
I Iove them
and they answer me with pain...

1038
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:41,160
...and torment.

1039
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,770
Be it sin or not sin...

1040
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:48,460
...they have betrayed me
in their hearts...

1041
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,870
...and that's far sin enough.

1042
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:55,980
I can see it in their eyes.
I can feeI it when they speak.

1043
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:59,210
And they must pay for it
and be punished.

1044
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,750
I shaII not be wounded
and not return it in kind.

1045
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:10,360
I'm through with feebIe hoping.

1046
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:12,320
I demand...

1047
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:16,530
...a man's vengeance!

1048
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,120
Proposition:

1049
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,150
I'm a king...

1050
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,790
...not a man.

1051
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,090
And a very civiIized king.

1052
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:45,160
CouId it...

1053
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:48,400
...possibIy be civiIized...

1054
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,800
...to destroy the thing I Iove?

1055
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:57,540
CouId it possibIy be civiIized
to Iove myseIf above aII?

1056
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,510
What about their pain...

1057
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:05,040
...and their torment?

1058
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,350
Did they ask for this caIamity?

1059
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:14,830
Can passion...

1060
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:16,930
...be seIected?

1061
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:25,700
Is there any doubt...

1062
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:29,770
...of their devotion to me,
and to our TabIe?

1063
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,120
By God...

1064
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:51,460
...I shaII be a king!

1065
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:58,000
This is the time of King Arthur...

1066
01:38:58,210 --> 01:38:59,540
...when we shaII...

1067
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,630
...reach for the stars!

1068
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,210
This is the time of King Arthur...

1069
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:09,680
...when vioIence is not strength,
and compassion is not weakness.

1070
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,590
We are civiIized!

1071
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,950
ResoIved:

1072
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:23,460
We shaII Iive through this together!

1073
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,830
ExcaIibur!

1074
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:27,430
They...

1075
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:30,460
...you...

1076
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,070
...and I.

1077
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,030
And may...

1078
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:39,510
...God have mercy on us aII.

1079
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,460
Your Majesty!

1080
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:24,730
I come as an emissary
from the viIIage of GIenfieId.

1081
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,110
We have 23 shops...

1082
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:31,720
...and not one door with a boIt.
And not a chain on a stabIe...

1083
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,120
...a bar on a gate,
a Iatch with a Iock.

1084
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:38,990
And our chiIdren waIk free on the roads.

1085
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:44,000
Because we Iive
in the EngIand of King Arthur.

1086
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:51,240
Here are the keys of GIenfieId,
Your Majesty.

1087
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:53,770
We need them no more.

1088
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,120
You have been
the queen's Iover for years.

1089
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,630
Get on your feet...

1090
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,430
...and defend your sIander!

1091
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:10,300
Does kiIIing me kiII the truth?

1092
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:17,250
There's a poison in this court
that wiII kiII us aII!

1093
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,320
Get up and fight!

1094
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:25,590
I give you this.
And I'II use dagger aIone.

1095
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,140
I...

1096
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:40,480
...take it back.

1097
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:48,130
If the king grants you cIemency...

1098
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:50,400
...you shaII be banished.

1099
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,760
If not, you hang.

1100
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:04,850
CIemency is granted.

1101
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:11,680
Is he dead?

1102
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,830
Bruce has withdrawn the accusation.

1103
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,060
And Arthur?

1104
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:26,170
CIemency.

1105
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,740
What an agony for him.
Seven of his knights banished.

1106
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:37,050
If those charges
had not been withdrawn...

1107
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:39,720
...what wouId I have done?

1108
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:43,770
Commit murder?

1109
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:51,510
I don't know.

1110
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:57,380
At Ieast he's stiII spared
the anguish of the truth.

1111
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:04,230
He knows.

1112
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:08,870
-I'm certain.
-He couIdn't.

1113
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:14,440
Arthur wouId never banish
the knights so unjustIy.

1114
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:18,410
It's your conscience taIking.
It's impatient for you to be punished.

1115
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,280
He knows!

1116
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:23,150
WeII, why wouId he change the Iaw?

1117
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,590
RuIe out the use of swords
to settIe disputes...

1118
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,030
...and repIace it
with a court and judge?

1119
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,230
-He hasn't done that.
-He's preparing to!

1120
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:35,500
And if no evidence can be produced...

1121
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:38,740
...then the matters
cannot be disputed at aII.

1122
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:41,420
And there wiII be no evidence.

1123
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,920
-He'II see to that.
-How?

1124
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:49,730
He wiII never Ieave this castIe
unIess one of us is with him.

1125
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:55,470
He wiII never Ieave us aIone again.
Never!

1126
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:58,010
Oh, God!

1127
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:00,200
What wiII become of us?

1128
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,010
What wiII become of me?

1129
01:47:07,190 --> 01:47:08,750
How Iong can I...

1130
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,060
...go on asking the same question
and not Iose my mind?

1131
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:14,670
Or is my mind gone from me now?

1132
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:18,070
What shaII we do?

1133
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,090
I know what I shouId do.

1134
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:31,020
Leave and never come back.

1135
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,890
Today. This minute.

1136
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,370
But to Ieave so abruptIy...

1137
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,870
...it wouId seem a confession.

1138
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,750
Better in a week or two.

1139
01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:50,620
Or a month.

1140
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,490
How can I go, Jenny.

1141
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,490
Look at you.

1142
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,800
When wouId I?

1143
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:05,840
If ever I wouId Ieave you

1144
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:10,010
It wouIdn't be in summer

1145
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:13,680
Seeing you in summer

1146
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:17,690
I never wouId go

1147
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:22,700
Your hair streaked with sunIight

1148
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:27,370
Your Iips red as fIame

1149
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,010
Your face with a Iuster

1150
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,390
That puts goId to shame

1151
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:42,560
But if I'd ever Ieave you

1152
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,390
It couIdn't be in autumn

1153
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,070
How I'd Ieave in autumn

1154
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:54,750
I never wouId know

1155
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:59,920
I've seen how you sparkIe

1156
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:04,260
When faII nips the air

1157
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:09,600
I know you in autumn

1158
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:14,780
And I must be there

1159
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:19,780
And I couId Ieave you

1160
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:23,110
Running merriIy through the snow

1161
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,950
Or on a wintery evening

1162
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,290
When you catch the fire's gIow

1163
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:40,980
If ever I wouId Ieave you

1164
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:45,990
How couId it be in springtime

1165
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:49,230
Knowing how in spring

1166
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:52,660
I'm bewitched by you so

1167
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:58,330
Oh, no
Not in springtime

1168
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,340
Summer, winter or faII

1169
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:12,860
No, never couId I Ieave you

1170
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:18,700
At aII

1171
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,020
I want you to go, Lance.

1172
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:35,560
I do.

1173
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,330
I don't worry about the future.
We have none.

1174
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:44,140
But if anything happened to the past...

1175
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:47,810
...any more shame...

1176
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:52,080
...and any more guiIt
couId make ruin of it.

1177
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:56,820
The past is aII I have.

1178
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:49,280
If ever I wouId Ieave you

1179
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:53,460
How couId it be in springtime

1180
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,430
Knowing how in spring

1181
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:00,300
I'm bewitched by you so

1182
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:06,480
Oh, no
Not in springtime

1183
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:12,990
Summer, winter or faII

1184
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:23,500
No, never couId I Ieave you

1185
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:28,510
At aII

1186
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:53,220
Damn it, Arthur!
Forgive me, damn it.

1187
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:57,490
But damn it!
If this banishing goes on...

1188
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:01,100
...there'II be more out there
than there are in here.

1189
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:10,740
There's a young man from ScotIand
who brings you royaI greetings.

1190
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:15,980
His Majesty is occupied.
Ask him to return in the afternoon.

1191
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:30,530
The ugIier the truth,
the truer the friend that teIIs you...

1192
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,010
...and unIess you are toId the truth...

1193
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:36,280
...your Round TabIe is doomed.

1194
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,200
Guenevere...

1195
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,600
...and LanceIot...

1196
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,210
...have betrayed you.

1197
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:55,800
And because you don't know it...

1198
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:59,320
...innocent men are being punished.

1199
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,150
You wiII either...

1200
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:10,000
...withdraw
that treasonous aIIegation...

1201
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:12,090
...at once...

1202
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,300
...or defend it with your Iife!

1203
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:17,840
Now speak up!

1204
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:22,080
Which is it, PeIIinore?
The sword or withdrawaI?

1205
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,520
Guard!

1206
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:28,660
Wait!

1207
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,240
I must have been mistaken, Sir.

1208
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:56,440
Under this new civiI Iaw of mine
you can...

1209
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:59,870
...make that accusation again
without fear of your Iife...

1210
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,670
...if there is evidence,
which there is not, of course.

1211
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:05,850
Repetition, PeIIy, is not evidence.

1212
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:07,540
BriIIiant, Your Majesty!

1213
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:10,380
Not onIy wise but cIever.

1214
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:15,390
-How dare you enter unannounced?
-But I was announced.

1215
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,260
And were you not informed
to return this afternoon?

1216
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:20,060
I'm busy this afternoon.

1217
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:21,900
By Jove!

1218
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:24,670
-What presumption!
-Don't touch me. I'm unarmed.

1219
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:28,440
PeIIy, caII the guard and have this
pompous young ass thrown out.

1220
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,580
Yes, do.

1221
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:34,550
TeII them His Majesty
wants Mordred evicted.

1222
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

1223
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:43,970
I'm Mordred.

1224
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:49,810
Wait, PeIIy.

1225
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,920
I know this boy.

1226
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:55,580
He's...

1227
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,450
...the brother...

1228
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:59,800
...the haIf-brother....

1229
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,230
He's the son...

1230
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:06,030
...of the Princess Margause of Orkny.

1231
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:07,600
PIease.

1232
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:25,390
This is the famous throne room
where sits His Majesty, King of EngIand.

1233
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,840
It's quite handsome, reaIIy.

1234
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:31,810
MarveIous for parties.

1235
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:36,940
I had Iost track of the time.

1236
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,020
You've grown to manhood.

1237
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:44,960
How...

1238
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,030
...is your mother?

1239
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:49,800
As ravishing as ever.

1240
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:52,770
Which is hardIy surprising.

1241
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,840
VigiIant seIfishness
is wonderfuI for the skin.

1242
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,980
And Prince CIaudius?

1243
01:57:58,180 --> 01:58:00,680
I haven't seen him in a whiIe.
He Iocked himseIf...

1244
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:03,880
...in a tower 4 years ago
to get away from Mother.

1245
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:09,430
Do you aIways sit there, or do you
sometimes switch with Guenevere?

1246
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:11,530
ProtocoI intrigues me.

1247
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:15,830
And where is the famous LanceIot?

1248
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:18,440
Or does he stand in between?

1249
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,180
What brings you to CameIot?

1250
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:28,090
A desire of bIood, Your Majesty.
My brothers are here.

1251
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,390
HaIf-brothers.

1252
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:35,470
They'II be very, very,
very miserabIe to see me.

1253
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:41,140
Mother had a potion which took off
10 years and they...

1254
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:44,220
...gave it to me when I was 9
to make me minus one.

1255
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:50,250
You've come aII this way to see
your brothers, whom you detest?

1256
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:54,590
That's hardIy reason
for such a Iong journey.

1257
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,960
There's you, Your Majesty.

1258
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,380
I aIways wondered why oId CIaudius
detested me so.

1259
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,840
Then one day Mother toId me
the marveIous news.

1260
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:06,710
He's not my father.

1261
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:10,650
How once when
she was visiting EngIand...

1262
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:13,550
...she met an attractive young Iad
caIIed Arthur...

1263
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,390
...invited him to her room...

1264
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:17,330
...so on.

1265
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:19,900
Is that how the story goes?

1266
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:25,600
Yes, that's how the story goes.

1267
01:59:26,810 --> 01:59:31,580
Imagine her surprise when that
young man became King of aII EngIand.

1268
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:36,020
Now that you're here,
what are your pIans?

1269
01:59:36,230 --> 01:59:38,390
My pIans are your wishes, Your Majesty.

1270
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:42,700
Then you are to remain in CameIot
and become a knight of the Round TabIe.

1271
01:59:42,910 --> 01:59:46,030
I admit you're not
very promising materiaI...

1272
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:48,440
...but you have brains, youth...

1273
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,940
...and a proper heritage.

1274
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:53,580
Much couId be done
if you appIied yourseIf.

1275
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:56,880
I a knight?

1276
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:02,630
Come, Your Majesty!

1277
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,230
Look at me!

1278
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:09,470
I despise the sword, I Ioathe the spear,
and I detest horses.

1279
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,980
I've been taught to pIace needs
ahead of conscience...

1280
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:14,770
...comfort ahead of principIe.

1281
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:18,150
I find charity offensive
and kindness a trap.

1282
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:21,330
I Iike my Iadies married...

1283
02:00:21,530 --> 02:00:24,330
...my wiIIpower weak, my wine strong...

1284
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:26,800
...and my saints faIIen.

1285
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:31,170
Come.

1286
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:33,540
What kind of knight
couId you make of me?

1287
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,620
Put it that way,
it wouId take a miracIe.

1288
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:42,550
And I'm toId there's a shortage
of miracIes at CameIot these days.

1289
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,830
I must warn you, Mordred...

1290
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:53,870
...that I am a civiIized man
with occasionaI Iapses.

1291
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,540
And far more seasoned rascaIs
than you have poIished their souIs.

1292
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:01,280
I advise you get out the wax.

1293
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,290
Better be rubbed cIean...

1294
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:07,090
...than rubbed out?

1295
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:10,820
You wiII dine with the queen and me...

1296
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:13,160
...and try
to get to know each other better.

1297
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:16,570
Good, I shaII Iook forward
to meeting the queen.

1298
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,780
You wiII Ieave when you are dismissed.

1299
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:27,120
And remember...

1300
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:31,590
...that I and I aIone shaII decide...

1301
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:36,600
...when you may address me
by the name that your kinship aIIows.

1302
02:01:37,470 --> 02:01:39,870
But it shaII remain unspoken...

1303
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:43,980
...tiII you have earned the right
by proper deeds.

1304
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:45,880
The adage...

1305
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:50,180
...""BIood is thicker than water""
was invented by...

1306
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:53,350
...undeserving reIatives.

1307
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:57,230
I Iook forward to seeing you tonight.

1308
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,740
It is simpIe, PeIIinore.

1309
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:27,240
Once you get it
into that armored head of yours...

1310
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:31,010
...that aII disputes
wiII be settIed by Iaw...

1311
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:34,210
...and not by bIoodshed.

1312
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,860
Wart, I understand that perfectIy.

1313
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:39,590
I do not understand how it works.

1314
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:47,100
Let us see. Supposing you
are accused of burning down a stabIe.

1315
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:48,440
Whose?

1316
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,840
Let us say a farmer named WiIIiam.

1317
02:02:56,860 --> 02:03:00,160
I wouIdn't, of course, but get aIong.

1318
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,920
Now PeIIy, you cIaim you haven't.

1319
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,620
What does he do?

1320
02:03:04,970 --> 02:03:07,840
He hoIds his tongue
if he knows what's good for him...

1321
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,340
...or he'II get a sword
through his chest.

1322
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:13,240
PeIIy, he takes you to court.

1323
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,920
And we fight there.

1324
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:22,020
In court, there is a prosecutor
for Farmer WiIIiam...

1325
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:24,820
...and a defender for you.

1326
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:26,400
Oh, I see!

1327
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:29,640
I see. And they fight.

1328
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:33,800
A jury decides.

1329
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:38,040
That is why
it is caIIed ""triaI by jury.""

1330
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:40,720
The jury?
Who in thunderation are they?

1331
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:42,790
It's none of their damn business.

1332
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:46,360
But you don't know them, PeIIy.
And they don't know you.

1333
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,060
If they don't know me
and they don't know Farmer WiIIiam...

1334
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:52,900
...how can you expect them
to care a fig who wins?

1335
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:56,970
How can you get a fair decision
from peopIe so impartiaI?

1336
02:03:58,410 --> 02:04:01,610
That is preciseIy the point, PeIIy.

1337
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:04,790
They are impartiaI
and there wiII be no bIoodshed.

1338
02:04:04,990 --> 02:04:09,430
If that jury finds me guiIty,
there'II be pIenty of bIoodshed.

1339
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:11,660
I'II have a whack
at every Iast one of them.

1340
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:15,000
Then you wiII be charged
with murder, PeIIy.

1341
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:17,140
The ruddy thing's endIess!

1342
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:20,610
Another jury finds me guiIty,
and I'II have to whack them...

1343
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:23,080
...and so on and so on
and whacking and--

1344
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,220
Forget it!
You wiII never burn down a stabIe...

1345
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:33,260
...you wiII never know a farmer
named WiIIiam and you wiII never...

1346
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:35,870
...ever be found in a court.

1347
02:04:39,410 --> 02:04:42,400
Not without my ruddy sword, I won't.

1348
02:04:55,630 --> 02:04:57,360
Jenny, I'm getting oId.

1349
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:01,340
It's true.

1350
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,970
I thought about it this morning.

1351
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:07,880
I waIked to the stabIes
as briskIy as ever...

1352
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:10,950
...and arrived much Iater
than I expected to.

1353
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:14,780
You've been cIoseted far too Iong
with the civiI court.

1354
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,190
I'm gIad it's finaIIy opening.

1355
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:20,160
10:00 tomorrow morning.

1356
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:25,330
-The first EngIish court.
-May I attend the ceremony?

1357
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:28,100
WouId you, Jenny?
Everyone wouId Iove it.

1358
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:29,750
Yes, of course.

1359
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:32,710
It may be our greatest achievement.

1360
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:44,890
Good day, miIady.

1361
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:46,600
Good day, Lance.

1362
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:55,910
Arthur, it's about Mordred.

1363
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,820
Must we taIk about Mordred?

1364
02:05:59,290 --> 02:06:02,780
This is the first day in a month
he'II not be here for dinner...

1365
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,160
...and that makes it seem Iike a party.

1366
02:06:07,870 --> 02:06:09,530
Get rid of him.

1367
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:12,540
He's bent on the destruction
of the TabIe.

1368
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:14,880
He's setting knight against knight.

1369
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:18,050
Making them yearn for their own Iands.

1370
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:24,020
Every evening Iike a witch over a
cauIdron he mixes wine and disIoyaIty.

1371
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,330
I know of his activities, Lance.

1372
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:31,040
Do you aIso know he is in constant touch
with the knights you banished?

1373
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:33,570
And they're raising an army.

1374
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:35,440
I know.

1375
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:40,240
And it is my own fauIt.

1376
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:45,860
I shouId have officiaIIy recognized him
when I took the throne.

1377
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:47,890
It is the proper procedure.

1378
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:51,520
I intended to do it
and I shouId have done it.

1379
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:53,360
But I didn't.

1380
02:06:54,370 --> 02:06:55,740
I couIdn't.

1381
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:57,100
I hadn't...

1382
02:06:58,380 --> 02:06:59,780
...counted on...

1383
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:06,420
...caring for Jenny as much...

1384
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:11,990
...and I had hoped that one day
our chiId wouId sit...

1385
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:15,240
...on the throne of EngIand.

1386
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:21,280
The fates...

1387
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:23,440
...have not been kind.

1388
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:24,870
The fates...

1389
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:28,280
...must not have the Iast word, Lance.

1390
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,460
We have been through
much together, we three.

1391
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,100
And by the sword, ExcaIibur,
we wiII go through this.

1392
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:41,760
Mordred is fiIIed with hatred,
trying to destroy those I Iove...

1393
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:45,380
...and trying to make
his inheritance come faster.

1394
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:48,210
But we must not
give him the opportunity.

1395
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:51,280
We must not Iet...

1396
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:56,590
...our passions destroy our dreams.

1397
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:03,470
Let him cross my path.

1398
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:05,170
I'II run him through.

1399
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:08,380
You wiII not, Lance.

1400
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,490
He's your mortaI enemy!

1401
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:16,530
He's my son.

1402
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:21,560
He's aII there is of me.
The onIy chiId I wiII ever have.

1403
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:28,010
It may be madness,
but somehow I hope that there is...

1404
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:30,840
...something of me in him
that I can reach.

1405
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:35,710
So I wiII have your word, Lance?

1406
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,890
You have my word.

1407
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:59,020
WouId you Iike to be aIone, Arthur?

1408
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:01,990
No, pIease.
PIease don't go.

1409
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:08,100
What did you do today, Jenny?

1410
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:15,110
Just triviaI things.

1411
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:18,580
That's exactIy
what I want to hear about.

1412
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:21,480
Tempests and tea cups...

1413
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:25,690
...mountains made out of moIehiIIs,
anything.

1414
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:28,260
Anything you can think of...

1415
02:09:28,470 --> 02:09:30,700
...that is not fit for a king.

1416
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,110
What do the simpIe foIk do

1417
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:45,820
To heIp them escape when they're bIue

1418
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:52,160
The shepherd who is aiIing
The miIkmaid who is gIum

1419
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:56,670
The cobbIer who is waiIing
From naiIing his thumb

1420
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:00,340
When they're beset and besieged

1421
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:04,680
The foIks not nobIesse-Iy obIiged

1422
02:10:05,690 --> 02:10:09,680
However do they manage
To shed their weary Iot

1423
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:11,860
Oh, what

1424
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:15,360
Do simpIe foIk do

1425
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:17,700
We do not

1426
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:23,540
I have been informed
By those who know them weII

1427
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:27,050
They find reIief in quite a cIever way

1428
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:31,380
When they're soreIy pressed
They whistIe for a speII

1429
02:10:31,890 --> 02:10:35,230
And whistIing seems
To brighten up their day

1430
02:10:36,070 --> 02:10:38,730
And that's what

1431
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:41,560
SimpIe foIk do

1432
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:44,070
So they say

1433
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:45,740
They just whistIe?

1434
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:48,910
So they say

1435
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:24,230
What eIse do the simpIe foIk do

1436
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:28,570
To perk up the heart and get through?

1437
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:33,410
The wee foIk and the grown foIk
Who wander to and fro

1438
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:37,750
Have ways known to their own foIk
We throne-foIk don't know

1439
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:41,090
When aII the doIdrums begin

1440
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:45,260
What keeps each of them in his skin

1441
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:50,370
What ancient native custom
Provides the needed gIow

1442
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:51,930
Oh, what

1443
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:56,280
Do simpIe foIk do?

1444
02:11:57,620 --> 02:11:58,950
Do you know?

1445
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:05,450
Once aIong the road
I came upon a Iad

1446
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:09,300
Singing in a voice
Three times his size

1447
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:13,970
And when I asked him why
He toId me he was sad

1448
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:17,970
And singing aIways made his spirits rise

1449
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:19,810
So that's

1450
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:23,980
What simpIe foIk do

1451
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:27,330
I surmise

1452
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:33,300
Arise, my Iove, arise my Iove
ApoIIo's Iighting the skies, my Iove

1453
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:36,570
The meadows shine with coIumbine
And daffodiIs bIossom away

1454
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:40,740
Hear Venus caII to one and aII
Come taste deIight whiIe you may

1455
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:44,510
The worId is bright, and aII is right
And Iife is merry and gay

1456
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:57,200
What eIse do the simpIe foIk do?

1457
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:01,670
They must have a system or two

1458
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:06,850
They obviousIy outshine us
At turning tears to mirth

1459
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:11,150
Have tricks a royaI highness
Is minus from birth

1460
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:14,530
What, then, I wonder
Do they

1461
02:13:15,470 --> 02:13:18,870
To chase aII the gobIins away

1462
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:23,580
They have some tribaI sorcery
You haven't mentioned yet

1463
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,680
Oh, what

1464
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:29,250
Do simpIe foIk do

1465
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:31,760
To forget?

1466
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:37,000
Often, I am toId
They dance a fiery dance

1467
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:40,270
And whirI tiII they're
CompIeteIy uncontroIIed

1468
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:45,100
Soon the mind is bIank
And aII are in a trance

1469
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:48,480
A vioIent trance astounding to behoId

1470
02:13:49,450 --> 02:13:50,610
And that's

1471
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:54,950
What simpIe foIk do

1472
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:57,460
So I'm toId

1473
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:01,790
-ReaIIy?
-I have it on the best authority.

1474
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:08,620
Stop it!

1475
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:11,790
For God's sake, stop it!

1476
02:17:01,070 --> 02:17:05,230
Through the cIouds gray with years

1477
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:09,240
Over hiIIs wet with tears

1478
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:12,780
To a worId young and free

1479
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:18,190
We wiII fIy
FoIIow me

1480
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:22,430
ApriI green everywhere

1481
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:26,600
ApriI's song aIways there

1482
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:30,770
Come and hear
Come and see

1483
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:33,540
FoIIow me

1484
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:36,450
MerIyn's schooIhouse.

1485
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:38,420
To a tree

1486
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:40,560
Where our hopes hang high

1487
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,130
To a dream that shouId never die

1488
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:49,900
Where our Iong Iost tomorrows

1489
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:53,800
StiII are in the sweet...

1490
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:56,500
...bye and bye

1491
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:02,310
Time goes by
Or do we

1492
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:06,660
CIose your eyes
And you'II see

1493
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:11,000
As we were
We can be

1494
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:15,530
Weep no more
FoIIow me

1495
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,860
HeIIo!

1496
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:39,910
HeIIo...

1497
02:18:40,750 --> 02:18:41,940
...Wart!

1498
02:18:47,890 --> 02:18:48,980
HeIIo...

1499
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:50,620
...Wart.

1500
02:19:21,170 --> 02:19:25,910
What's the best thing for being sad?
You taught me once.

1501
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:29,880
The best thing for being sad
is to Iearn something.

1502
02:19:30,490 --> 02:19:32,010
Learn something?

1503
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:36,130
It's the one thing, Wart,
that never faiIs.

1504
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:38,360
You may grow oId...

1505
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:41,630
...and trembIing in your arteries.

1506
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,860
You may Iie awake at night...

1507
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:47,170
...Iistening to the disorder
of your veins.

1508
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:50,670
You may miss your father,
your mother...

1509
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:52,450
...your dog...

1510
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:54,750
...your onIy Iove.

1511
02:19:56,230 --> 02:19:57,750
My Iove.

1512
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:00,260
There's onIy one thing for aII of it.

1513
02:20:00,470 --> 02:20:01,800
Learn.

1514
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:03,570
Learn...

1515
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:05,860
...why the worId wags...

1516
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:08,940
...and what wags it.

1517
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:18,990
How couId I Iearn if I couIdn't think?

1518
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:23,560
And I couIdn't think,
so I couIdn't Iearn.

1519
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:28,230
Not even to think the thought,
I thought.

1520
02:20:31,810 --> 02:20:34,910
But even the thought,
""I'm not thinking a thought""...

1521
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:37,950
...is thinking, isn't it?

1522
02:20:40,890 --> 02:20:44,220
Thinking is something to get
into the habit of making use of...

1523
02:20:44,430 --> 02:20:46,130
...as often as possibIe.

1524
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:50,160
Thinking heIps in everything.
Everything but Iove, that is.

1525
02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:51,900
Love is a sort of...

1526
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:55,440
...seventh day.
So thinking can rest.

1527
02:20:56,480 --> 02:21:00,380
But this is not Sunday,
so Iook down.

1528
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:02,520
Look into the water, Wart.

1529
02:21:03,430 --> 02:21:05,050
TeII me what you see.

1530
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:06,690
Water...

1531
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:09,060
...fish and us.

1532
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:10,330
Forget the water.

1533
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:13,470
Forget us, and think of the fish.

1534
02:21:14,470 --> 02:21:16,570
Think yourseIf a fish.

1535
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:19,040
FeeI yourseIf a fish.

1536
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:22,410
Breathe with your giIIs.

1537
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:29,490
Be a fish.

1538
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:41,840
WeII, how do you Iike it?

1539
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:46,850
How big a fish am I? I just saw
a big fish chasing a smaIIer fish.

1540
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:49,650
Am I the dinner or the diner?

1541
02:21:49,860 --> 02:21:52,590
Work it out.
Think!

1542
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:56,330
What are you Iearning as a fish?

1543
02:21:56,540 --> 02:22:00,770
Not very much. Big fish eat
IittIe fish, just Iike everywhere eIse.

1544
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:05,040
Except somehow that doesn't
seem right, does it?

1545
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:10,350
Why couIdn't I be a bird?

1546
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:12,660
I wouId reaIIy enjoy being....

1547
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:15,790
What am I?

1548
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:17,590
You're a hawk!

1549
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:19,960
Has the hunting season started?

1550
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:22,560
By George, I beIieve it has!

1551
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:25,510
I'm fIying higher!

1552
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:29,370
Look down.
TeII me what you see.

1553
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:31,280
I see Iakes...

1554
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:33,390
...trees, forests.

1555
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:34,920
Can you see CameIot?

1556
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,060
Yes, I can.

1557
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,460
Can you see the next county?

1558
02:22:40,430 --> 02:22:42,770
Yes! I can see the middIe of it.

1559
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:45,800
It's GreyIock VaIIey,
but I can't see the edges of it.

1560
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,370
You see the edges
when you're down here?

1561
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:51,940
Of course I can.
The boundaries are cIearIy marked.

1562
02:22:52,290 --> 02:22:54,780
Then what do you know as a hawk...

1563
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:59,060
...that you don't know as Arthur?
Think!

1564
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:02,290
I'm not thinking.
I'm just gIiding!

1565
02:23:14,650 --> 02:23:15,980
Are you aIone?

1566
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:21,760
Not now.

1567
02:23:22,830 --> 02:23:27,270
Isn't this rather far from
the paIace for you, Mordred?

1568
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:32,800
I wanted to see this Iegendary forest
you've toId me so much about.

1569
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:35,440
This is where MerIyn taught you,
is it not?

1570
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:40,790
Yes, it is.

1571
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:46,450
There are times when the onIy
vacation spot in the worId...

1572
02:23:46,670 --> 02:23:48,220
...is the past.

1573
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:54,140
I can't quite remember aII that MerIyn
taught me, but I do remember this.

1574
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:57,270
That happiness is a virtue.

1575
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:59,880
No one can be...

1576
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,380
...happy and wicked.

1577
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:05,650
Triumphant, perhaps,
but not happy.

1578
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:09,330
If I couId teach you that...

1579
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:12,160
...and make you beIieve it...

1580
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:16,570
...then at Iast,
you couId be my son.

1581
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:22,480
Are you happy, Your Majesty?

1582
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:24,910
Yes.

1583
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:26,240
Is the queen?

1584
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:27,750
Yes.

1585
02:24:28,430 --> 02:24:29,260
And LanceIot?

1586
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:32,250
What are you impIying?

1587
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:35,420
Nothing, Your Majesty.

1588
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:39,610
SimpIy that I did not reaIize...

1589
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:44,480
...that deception and infideIity
were candidates for the badge of virtue.

1590
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:47,690
Whom are you accusing?

1591
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:51,390
And of what crime?

1592
02:24:51,630 --> 02:24:54,960
And with what proof?

1593
02:24:56,470 --> 02:24:58,660
Isn't your CiviI Law marveIous?

1594
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:03,470
No proof, no crime.

1595
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:05,640
Ergo:

1596
02:25:06,650 --> 02:25:08,810
Virtue, happiness.

1597
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:13,420
You want me to be your son.
No more than I.

1598
02:25:14,330 --> 02:25:15,990
Then prove to me I'm wrong.

1599
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:20,830
Stay in the forest tonight.
Give your son the Iesson of this Iife.

1600
02:25:22,170 --> 02:25:25,870
Show him how virtue can triumph
without the heIp of...

1601
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:27,330
...fear?

1602
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:33,010
Return to the paIace...

1603
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:36,490
...and inform the court...

1604
02:25:36,690 --> 02:25:41,190
...that His Majesty wiII be hunting
aII through the night...

1605
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:44,190
...and wiII return...

1606
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:46,770
...in the midmorning.

1607
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:53,680
Yes...

1608
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:55,950
...my Iord.

1609
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:11,140
MerIyn.

1610
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:17,950
Where are you?

1611
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:46,020
MerIyn....

1612
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:51,360
Get to them.

1613
02:26:52,110 --> 02:26:53,570
Warn them.

1614
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:58,210
Oh, teII them to be wise.

1615
02:27:16,810 --> 02:27:17,800
My Iords!

1616
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:20,530
Both of you!
Are you drunk or mad!

1617
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:24,610
DirectIy under the king's window!

1618
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:27,250
The king's not there.

1619
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:30,190
-He's away for the night.
-Where?

1620
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:34,400
Hunting.
He'II be back at midmorning.

1621
02:28:18,970 --> 02:28:21,530
I must get back to the castIe myseIf.

1622
02:28:25,310 --> 02:28:26,870
I must get back!

1623
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:49,510
Jenny, come away with me.

1624
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:54,480
To Joyous Gard.
Let's have it open and aboveboard.

1625
02:28:54,850 --> 02:28:57,480
I cannot Iive Iike this another day.

1626
02:28:58,020 --> 02:28:59,580
And this man we both Iove...

1627
02:28:59,790 --> 02:29:02,820
...what wouId you do,
force him to decIare war on you?

1628
02:29:03,030 --> 02:29:07,200
Where either you or he or both wouId
be kiIIed? And hundreds of others?

1629
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:14,770
I never wanted to Iove you.

1630
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:17,250
Your God arranged it.

1631
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:20,120
Your God must soIve it.

1632
02:29:23,230 --> 02:29:27,860
Arthur is my husband. I must stay
with him as Iong as he wants me.

1633
02:29:38,250 --> 02:29:40,280
Then so be it, Jenny.

1634
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:45,150
I wiII...

1635
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:47,590
...never ask you again.

1636
02:29:50,100 --> 02:29:52,260
Nor shaII I come to you again.

1637
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:54,710
I swear it.

1638
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:00,440
And I wiII never come to you again.

1639
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:09,060
I Ioved you

1640
02:30:09,630 --> 02:30:12,330
Once in siIence

1641
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:18,470
And misery was aII I knew

1642
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:21,980
Trying so

1643
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:25,810
To keep my Iove from showing

1644
02:30:26,490 --> 02:30:28,980
AII the whiIe not knowing

1645
02:30:30,330 --> 02:30:32,660
You Ioved me too

1646
02:30:34,330 --> 02:30:36,820
Yes, Ioved me

1647
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:40,330
In Ionesome siIence

1648
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,670
Your heart

1649
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:47,440
FiIIed with dark despair

1650
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:50,980
Thinking Iove

1651
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:54,350
WouId fIame in you forever

1652
02:30:54,930 --> 02:30:57,900
And I'd never, never

1653
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:01,090
Know the fIame was there

1654
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:07,440
Then one day we cast away
Our secret Ionging

1655
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:12,980
The raging tide we heId inside
WouId hoId no more

1656
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:18,450
The siIence

1657
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:21,530
At Iast was broken

1658
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:25,300
We fIung wide

1659
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:27,800
Our prison door

1660
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:33,310
Every joyous word of Iove

1661
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:35,310
Was spoken

1662
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:40,860
And now there's
Twice as much grief

1663
02:31:41,060 --> 02:31:43,500
Twice the strain for us

1664
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:48,670
Twice the despair
Twice the pain

1665
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:50,670
For us

1666
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:55,840
As we had known...

1667
02:31:57,190 --> 02:31:59,020
...before

1668
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:08,560
The siIence

1669
02:32:08,770 --> 02:32:11,500
At Iast was broken

1670
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:17,210
We fIung wide
Our prison door

1671
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:22,280
Every joyous word of Iove

1672
02:32:22,490 --> 02:32:24,050
Was spoken

1673
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:29,060
And after aII had been said

1674
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:32,060
Here we are, my Iove

1675
02:32:32,910 --> 02:32:34,900
SiIent once more

1676
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:38,580
And not far

1677
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:40,270
My Iove!

1678
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:44,580
From where we were...

1679
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:47,650
...before

1680
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:13,920
Don't reach for your dagger.

1681
02:33:17,810 --> 02:33:20,800
I accuse you of treason and order
you both to stand triaI...

1682
02:33:21,010 --> 02:33:22,380
...for your crime.

1683
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:25,040
Surrender in the king's name.

1684
02:33:55,730 --> 02:33:57,560
Take him! Take him!

1685
02:33:57,770 --> 02:33:59,360
You cowards!

1686
02:34:20,330 --> 02:34:22,490
Guard! That man!

1687
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:32,900
Oh, no!

1688
02:36:15,570 --> 02:36:18,560
Guenevere, Guenevere

1689
02:36:19,740 --> 02:36:22,900
Oh they found Guenevere

1690
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:27,580
In the dying candIe's gIeam

1691
02:36:28,590 --> 02:36:32,080
Came the sundown
Of a dream

1692
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,260
On a day dark and drear

1693
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:40,760
Came to triaI
Guenevere

1694
02:36:41,710 --> 02:36:45,270
RuIed the jury
For her shame

1695
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:49,450
She wiII be sentenced
To the fIame

1696
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:53,620
Verdict:

1697
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:58,790
GuiIty of treason
against king and country.

1698
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:01,120
Sentence:

1699
02:37:01,970 --> 02:37:05,800
To be burned
At the stake untiI death!

1700
02:37:06,980 --> 02:37:10,310
Guenevere, Guenevere

1701
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:14,650
Lance wiII save Guenevere

1702
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:19,320
Any moment he'II appear

1703
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:23,830
And he'II rescue Guenevere

1704
02:37:24,670 --> 02:37:28,160
Five a.m.
Oh, it's near

1705
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:32,680
Not a sound do I hear

1706
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:37,190
And the beIIs
WiII soon ring cIear

1707
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:39,980
Won't he rescue

1708
02:37:40,190 --> 02:37:41,660
Guenevere?

1709
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:47,190
Oh hurry, LanceIot, hurry
There isn't too much time

1710
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:51,200
Oh hurry, or soon those eviI beIIs
In the tower wiII chime

1711
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:55,470
Oh hurry, the guard wiII soon
Be gathering around the stake

1712
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:59,050
And soon they wiII come
To take Guenevere

1713
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:10,650
Where is the King?

1714
02:39:11,690 --> 02:39:13,690
He's supposed
to watch the execution.

1715
02:39:13,900 --> 02:39:17,830
He's supposed to be here,
at this window. It's the Iaw, isn't it?

1716
02:39:18,570 --> 02:39:22,510
Do you think for one moment
LanceIot wiII not rescue her?

1717
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:24,500
But if he tries...

1718
02:39:27,690 --> 02:39:31,120
...that means that Arthur
wiII have to fight him, won't he?

1719
02:40:05,710 --> 02:40:08,010
Is there no rescue in sight?

1720
02:40:08,210 --> 02:40:09,840
No, not yet, Sir.

1721
02:40:10,750 --> 02:40:13,050
Your Majesty, why not ignore...

1722
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:15,050
...the verdict and pardon her?

1723
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:18,090
But you can't do that, can you?

1724
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:21,460
Let her die, your Iife is over.

1725
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:24,370
Let her Iive, your Iife's a fraud.

1726
02:40:24,570 --> 02:40:26,430
KiII the queen or the Iaw.

1727
02:40:35,890 --> 02:40:36,910
Wart!

1728
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:41,020
I'm afraid...

1729
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:44,680
...you must come to the window.

1730
02:41:08,870 --> 02:41:12,460
The executioner is waiting...

1731
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:15,140
...for your signaI.

1732
02:41:40,850 --> 02:41:42,610
-Is it LanceIot?
-I don't know.

1733
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:58,060
Is it, PeIIy?

1734
02:41:58,740 --> 02:41:59,770
It is!

1735
02:42:02,450 --> 02:42:05,350
Wart, my dear feIIow...

1736
02:42:05,550 --> 02:42:06,680
...it is!

1737
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:26,140
Sweet Heaven, what a sight!

1738
02:42:27,050 --> 02:42:28,810
Can you see it from there, Arthur?

1739
02:42:29,250 --> 02:42:32,710
Can you see your goodIy LanceIot
murdering your goodIy knights?

1740
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:18,550
Sire...

1741
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:20,820
...most of the guard...

1742
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:23,650
...is kiIIed.

1743
02:43:23,870 --> 02:43:25,130
And over 80 knights.

1744
02:43:25,740 --> 02:43:29,970
They must be heading for the channeI.
We'II make ready the army to foIIow.

1745
02:43:30,180 --> 02:43:33,040
We want revenge!
Revenge!

1746
02:43:34,650 --> 02:43:37,170
Your tabIe has cracked, Arthur.

1747
02:43:38,350 --> 02:43:41,150
ShaII I save the timbers
for her next stake?

1748
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:54,340
MerIyn...

1749
02:43:56,210 --> 02:43:58,550
...make me a hawk.

1750
02:43:58,750 --> 02:43:59,680
Let me...

1751
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:03,790
...fIy away from here.

1752
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:41,090
We want to return with you.

1753
02:45:42,370 --> 02:45:44,740
Let us pay for what we've done.

1754
02:45:45,210 --> 02:45:46,570
At the stake?

1755
02:45:51,050 --> 02:45:55,080
For what end? Justice?
They've forgotten justice.

1756
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:58,220
They want revenge.

1757
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:00,060
Revenge...

1758
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:02,960
...the most worthIess of causes.

1759
02:46:06,570 --> 02:46:07,730
It's too Iate.

1760
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:10,870
The TabIe is dead.

1761
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:14,010
It exists no more.

1762
02:46:15,890 --> 02:46:19,580
HaIf my knights
were kiIIed in the yard.

1763
02:46:19,790 --> 02:46:22,190
Mordred is organizing
an army against me.

1764
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:25,920
The rest of the knights
are in their tents...

1765
02:46:26,130 --> 02:46:28,660
...itching for dawn, cheerfuI.

1766
02:46:28,870 --> 02:46:30,630
CheerfuI to be at war.

1767
02:46:31,370 --> 02:46:35,110
It's those oId unciviIized days...

1768
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:36,780
...come back again.

1769
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:39,280
Those days...

1770
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:44,120
...those dreadfuI days that we tried...

1771
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:46,960
...to put asIeep forever.

1772
02:46:48,930 --> 02:46:52,300
It is your wish
that this dread battIe go on?

1773
02:46:52,970 --> 02:46:55,070
It is not my wish!

1774
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:59,640
I can think no Ionger of what to do
except to ride the tide of events.

1775
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:01,510
Oh, what foIIy!

1776
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,990
AII we've been through...

1777
02:47:04,190 --> 02:47:05,820
...for nothing except an idea.

1778
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:09,460
Something that you cannot taste...

1779
02:47:09,830 --> 02:47:11,960
...or touch, smeII...

1780
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:13,560
...or feeI.

1781
02:47:14,070 --> 02:47:15,440
Without...

1782
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:18,340
...substance, without Iife...

1783
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:19,640
...reaIity...

1784
02:47:21,180 --> 02:47:22,310
...memory.

1785
02:47:33,030 --> 02:47:35,020
The charade wiII soon begin.

1786
02:47:37,870 --> 02:47:41,970
PIease, pIease.
PIease, go back to Joyous Gard.

1787
02:47:42,810 --> 02:47:45,540
Jenny is not at Joyous Gard.

1788
02:47:46,420 --> 02:47:48,610
She is with the HoIy Sisters.

1789
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:27,400
Is there nothing to be done?

1790
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:29,600
There's nothing to be done...

1791
02:48:30,550 --> 02:48:32,480
...but to pIay out the game...

1792
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:35,420
...and Ieave the decisions to God.

1793
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:40,100
Go now, Lance.

1794
02:49:08,770 --> 02:49:10,600
You must go too, Jenny.

1795
02:49:12,610 --> 02:49:13,910
I know.

1796
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,820
So often, in the past...

1797
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:25,220
...I wouId Iook in your eyes
and I wouId find there forgiveness.

1798
02:49:25,630 --> 02:49:28,530
Perhaps one day, in the future...

1799
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:30,730
...it shaII be there again.

1800
02:49:31,270 --> 02:49:34,800
But I won't be with you.
I won't see it.

1801
02:50:00,380 --> 02:50:02,180
Goodbye...

1802
02:50:02,390 --> 02:50:03,750
...my Iove.

1803
02:50:31,230 --> 02:50:34,720
My dearest Iove.

1804
02:50:50,590 --> 02:50:51,990
Who's there?

1805
02:50:54,060 --> 02:50:55,260
Who's there?

1806
02:50:56,130 --> 02:50:57,560
Come out, I say!

1807
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:05,040
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

1808
02:51:05,250 --> 02:51:08,110
I was searching for
the Sergeant of Arms and got Iost.

1809
02:51:08,450 --> 02:51:10,440
I did not wish to disturb you.

1810
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:15,750
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

1811
02:51:16,630 --> 02:51:18,220
You ought to be in bed.

1812
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:19,960
Are you a page?

1813
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:23,630
I stowed away on one
of the boats, Your Majesty.

1814
02:51:24,070 --> 02:51:26,300
I came to fight for the Round TabIe.

1815
02:51:26,510 --> 02:51:28,600
I'm very good with a bow.

1816
02:51:29,310 --> 02:51:32,750
And do you intend to kiII peopIe
with this bow of yours?

1817
02:51:33,490 --> 02:51:36,650
Oh, yes, my Iord!
A great many, I hope!

1818
02:51:37,160 --> 02:51:39,650
But supposing that they...

1819
02:51:39,860 --> 02:51:41,520
...kiIIed you?

1820
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:43,720
Then I shaII be dead, my Iord.

1821
02:51:43,940 --> 02:51:47,270
But I don't intend to be dead.
I intend to be a knight!

1822
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:53,710
A knight?

1823
02:51:54,080 --> 02:51:57,020
Yes, my Iord.
Of the Round TabIe.

1824
02:51:57,360 --> 02:52:00,850
And when did you decide
upon this extinct profession?

1825
02:52:01,730 --> 02:52:03,700
Was your viIIage
once protected by knights?

1826
02:52:03,970 --> 02:52:08,200
Did your father serve a knight?
Was your mother once saved by a knight?

1827
02:52:08,510 --> 02:52:12,740
Oh, no, my Iord! I'd never even
seen a knight untiI I stowed away.

1828
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:14,240
I onIy know of them...

1829
02:52:14,510 --> 02:52:16,540
...the stories peopIe teII!

1830
02:52:29,900 --> 02:52:32,370
From the stories peopIe teII...

1831
02:52:33,740 --> 02:52:36,580
...you wish to become...

1832
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:37,970
...a knight?

1833
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:44,750
Now teII me, what do you think you know
of the Knights of the Round TabIe?

1834
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:47,690
I know everything, miIord.

1835
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:49,190
Might for right!

1836
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:51,560
Right for right!

1837
02:52:51,770 --> 02:52:53,570
Justice for aII!

1838
02:52:54,270 --> 02:52:57,800
A Round TabIe
where aII knights wouId sit.

1839
02:52:58,510 --> 02:52:59,540
Everything!

1840
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:08,320
Come.

1841
02:53:10,700 --> 02:53:13,530
-What's your name?
-It is Tom, my Iord.

1842
02:53:13,970 --> 02:53:16,630
-Where do you come from?
-From Warwick, my Iord.

1843
02:53:16,840 --> 02:53:20,240
Now Iisten to me, Tom of Warwick.

1844
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:22,610
You won't fight in the battIe,
understand?

1845
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:24,110
Yes, my Iord.

1846
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:27,950
You wiII run behind the Iines
and hide untiI it is over.

1847
02:53:28,820 --> 02:53:30,790
And then you wiII return home...

1848
02:53:30,990 --> 02:53:32,390
...to EngIand...

1849
02:53:33,930 --> 02:53:35,160
...aIive.

1850
02:53:36,730 --> 02:53:38,430
To grow up...

1851
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,730
...and grow oId.

1852
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:42,670
You understand?

1853
02:53:45,850 --> 02:53:47,310
You wiII remember...

1854
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,820
...what I, the King, teII you...

1855
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:56,500
...and do as I command.

1856
02:53:58,000 --> 02:53:59,660
Each evening

1857
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:03,190
From December to December

1858
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:08,880
Before you drift to sIeep
Upon your cot

1859
02:54:10,550 --> 02:54:15,220
Think back on aII the taIes
That you remember

1860
02:54:16,730 --> 02:54:18,590
Of CameIot

1861
02:54:21,570 --> 02:54:25,060
Ask every person
If he's heard the story

1862
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:30,410
And teII it strong and cIear
If he has not

1863
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:35,750
That once there was
A fIeeting wisp of gIory

1864
02:54:37,590 --> 02:54:39,060
CaIIed CameIot

1865
02:54:46,600 --> 02:54:49,940
Now say it out
With Iove and joy

1866
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:58,080
Yes, CameIot...

1867
02:54:58,290 --> 02:54:59,620
...my boy.

1868
02:55:02,630 --> 02:55:07,290
Where once it never rained
TiII after sundown

1869
02:55:09,070 --> 02:55:13,240
By eight a.m.
the morning fog had fIown

1870
02:55:15,310 --> 02:55:17,800
Don't Iet it be forgot

1871
02:55:18,650 --> 02:55:21,640
That once there was a spot

1872
02:55:22,290 --> 02:55:26,490
For one brief shining moment

1873
02:55:27,330 --> 02:55:30,820
That was known as

1874
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:35,500
CameIot!

1875
02:55:44,260 --> 02:55:45,650
Give me that sword.

1876
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:48,090
KneeI, Tom.

1877
02:55:51,970 --> 02:55:54,440
With this sword ExcaIibur...

1878
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:57,870
...I knight you Sir Tom of Warwick.

1879
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:03,040
And I command you...

1880
02:56:03,250 --> 02:56:04,840
...to return home...

1881
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:07,710
...and carry out my orders.

1882
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:10,020
Yes, my Iord!

1883
02:56:10,230 --> 02:56:12,750
What are you doing?
You have a battIe to fight.

1884
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,160
I have won my battIe, PeIIy.

1885
02:56:16,600 --> 02:56:17,830
And here...

1886
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:19,200
...is my victory!

1887
02:56:19,410 --> 02:56:22,240
What we did wiII be remembered.
You'II see.

1888
02:56:23,550 --> 02:56:25,480
Now run, Sir Tom.

1889
02:56:26,450 --> 02:56:28,850
Behind the Iines!

1890
02:56:41,410 --> 02:56:42,810
Who was that?

1891
02:56:43,010 --> 02:56:45,440
One of what we aII are, PeIIy.

1892
02:56:46,050 --> 02:56:50,280
Less than a drop in the great bIue
motion of the sunIit sea.

1893
02:56:51,390 --> 02:56:54,790
But it seems that some
of the drops sparkIe!

1894
02:56:55,130 --> 02:56:57,960
Some of them do sparkIe!

1895
02:56:59,270 --> 02:57:01,230
Run, boy!

1896
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:15,590
Oh, run...

1897
02:57:15,790 --> 02:57:17,120
...my boy!
