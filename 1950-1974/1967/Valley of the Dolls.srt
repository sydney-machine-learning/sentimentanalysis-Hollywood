1
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:50,740
<i>You've got to climb Mount Everest...</i>

2
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:52,744
<i>... to reach the Valley of the Dolls.</i>

3
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:55,867
<i>It's a brutal climb to reach that peak.</i>

4
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:01,462
<i>You stand there, waiting for the rush</i>
<i>of exhilaration, but it doesn't come.</i>

5
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,919
<i>You're alone.</i>

6
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:08,800
<i>And the feeling of loneliness</i>
<i>is overpowering.</i>

7
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:28,321
<i>I never meant to start that climb.</i>

8
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:32,323
<i>I took the first step when I left</i>
<i>New England and headed for New York.</i>

9
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>It wasn't easy to leave</i>
<i>that wonderful house.</i>

10
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:38,159
<i>My grandparents lived there</i>
<i>and theirs before them.</i>

11
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,540
<i>It was standing during the Revolution.</i>

12
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:46,417
<i>George Washington didn't sleep there,</i>
<i>but he did dip water from our well.</i>

13
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:50,589
<i>I can still see them</i>
<i>standing there waving.</i>

14
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,515
<i>Aunt Amy, Mama and Willie.</i>

15
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:59,187
<i>Poor Willie. He didn't know</i>
<i>I was leaving his life forever.</i>

16
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:04,565
<i>I'll never forget the night I told them</i>
<i>I was going to New York.</i>

17
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:07,772
<i>They said it was a dreadful place</i>
<i>for a vacation.</i>

18
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:11,067
<i>I announced I was going to work there.</i>

19
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:15,871
<i>Willie took it well.</i>
<i>He said he'd give me a month...</i>

20
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,500
<i>... and I'd run for home</i>
<i>ready to settle down in Lawrenceville.</i>

21
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:23,041
<i>I remember the day Willie pinned me.</i>

22
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:26,540
<i>He said it meant</i>
<i>we were engaged to be engaged.</i>

23
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,879
<i>I wanted a marriage like Mom and Dad's,</i>
<i>but not yet.</i>

24
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:34,929
<i>First I wanted new experiences,</i>
<i>new faces, new surroundings.</i>

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,765
<i>Lawrenceville would be there forever.</i>

26
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:37,721
<i>The cab driver kept complaining</i>
<i>about the sleet and slush.</i>

27
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:41,057
<i>I told him he should see</i>
<i>one of our New England blizzards.</i>

28
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,932
<i>He took me to the</i>
<i>Martha Washington Hotel for women.</i>

29
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,600
<i>Aunt Amy had stayed there.</i>

30
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:50,566
<i>She said it was as safe as you</i>
<i>could be in a city like New York.</i>

31
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:57,942
<i>The desk clerk warned me</i>
<i>they didn't allow men in the rooms.</i>

32
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,204
<i>I confessed I didn't know any.</i>

33
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:14,922
<i>Before my feet were dry,</i>
<i>the agency sent me on an interview.</i>

34
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:18,963
<i>I had butterflies, but I acted like</i>
<i>I'd done it all my life.</i>

35
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:21,513
<i>At least I thought I did.</i>

36
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,696
I knew it. She had that look.
- I'm to see Miss Steinberg.

37
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,825
I knew she was pregnant.

38
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:45,998
Certainly I should have kept an eye
on her, doctor, but she sneaks out.

39
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:51,329
I haven't any idea who the father is.
It could have been one of several.

40
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:56,299
All right. I'll start her
on vitamins tomorrow.

41
00:05:56,679 --> 00:06:01,341
Queeny's pregnant again.
My Siamese.

42
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:05,515
I hope it isn't that beat-up black tom
with the one eye.

43
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:09,187
A black Siamese should be very pretty.
I'm Anne Welles.

44
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:12,893
Oh, yes. The agency phoned about you.

45
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,946
B.A. At Radcliffe? Mr. Bellamy will like
that. He'll think it gives the office tone.

46
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:21,700
- The agency said he's a lawyer.
- A theatrical lawyer.

47
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:25,406
He handles actors, writers
and directors. Important ones.

48
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,451
He advises them and draws up
their contracts. No loopholes.

49
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,998
- Sounds fascinating.
- It isn't.

50
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:37,635
- Will I work for Bellamy or Bellows?
- There is no Mr. Bellows anymore.

51
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:41,469
Only his nephew, Lyon Burke.
You can tell when he's in the office...

52
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:44,844
...by the girls around that water cooler.

53
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:48,977
- How's your shorthand?
- Weak, but I type 60 words a minute.

54
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay, I'll take you in to see the boss.

55
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:57,276
Mr. Bellamy, this is Miss Welles.
She's here about the job.

56
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,818
- She's too good-looking.
- Mr. Bellamy, that's not fair.

57
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:04,161
I'll just get her broken in
and she'll get married.

58
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:06,204
- I'm already engaged.
- There, see?

59
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:09,494
Lots of secretaries are married,
aren't they?

60
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,252
Not in this office. Some days
you'll work until midnight...

61
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:17,255
...having dinner with me and a client.
I'll drink too much...

62
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:21,970
...and won't remember a word. You'll
have one sherry and remember it all.

63
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,094
- I have a good memory and love sherry.
- Can you handle it?

64
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,760
- I'm sure I can.
- Could she start right away?

65
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:34,142
- Stop running my life. I'm not convinced.
- Couldn't you please give me a trial?

66
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,112
All right. I'll try you out for one week,
starting as of now.

67
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:44,110
Here. Take these contracts to Helen
Lawson at the rehearsal hall on 44th.

68
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,491
Take a cab. See that she signs them.

69
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,537
- Let's see if she can handle that.
- I'll be right back.

70
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:54,875
And don't give her that "I loved
you when I was a little girl" routine...

71
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,795
...or she'll stab you in the back.

72
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:04,087
Helen Lawson?
Mr. Bellamy, that was wicked.

73
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,492
Twelve bucks an hour for 80 people,
are you kidding? Come on.

74
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,491
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

75
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:33,873
- I have some contracts for Miss Lawson.
- Go down the hall and turn left.

76
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,914
First dressing room on the right.
If you're a Capricorn, watch your step.

77
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:41,592
Yeah, Harry, it's a good company.
Come on.

78
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,177
- Why? Why? Why!
- That's it.

79
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,258
- Five, six, seven, eight.

80
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:50,562
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

81
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,772
Two, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. One, two...

82
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,763
You're sorry?

83
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,480
No good.

84
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,939
Lousy. A beast.

85
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,238
Out.
What kind of a press agent are you?

86
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,991
Why did they send me some green kid
fresh out of NYU?

87
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:56,707
- Who in hell are you?
- I'm Anne Welles. And I...

88
00:09:56,922 --> 00:10:00,172
Look, I'm tired and I'm busy.
What do you want?

89
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:03,260
Mr. Bellamy sent some contracts
for you to sign.

90
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:06,002
You, out.

91
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:10,180
Come on.

92
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:19,943
Give me a fountain pen.
And not one of those lousy ballpoints.

93
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,654
Come on.

94
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:29,402
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

95
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:38,752
That girl who is singing out there,
she's very good, isn't she?

96
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,796
Yeah.

97
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:45,421
How do you think the kid's song works
in the new spot? Great, huh?

98
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:47,091
The song goes.

99
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,886
- What?
- You heard me, the song goes.

100
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,686
- And the kid with it.
- Come on, Neely O'Hara can't hurt you.

101
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:58,770
You bet your ass she can't.
Because she isn't gonna get the chance.

102
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:02,021
The only hit that comes out of
my show is Helen Lawson.

103
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,023
And that's me, baby, remember?

104
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,401
- She has a run-of-the-play contract.
- I know about run-of-the-play contracts.

105
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,613
This won't help you in the business.

106
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,912
Right. Nor you, either.

107
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,784
So get Bellamy to do it.
He knows how. He's done it before.

108
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:23,419
You, go back and tell that son of a bitch
to get off his butt and earn his oats.

109
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:29,841
- But you haven't signed the contracts.
- And I don't intend to.

110
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:36,766
Not until Bellamy ties a can
to that little broad's tail.

111
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,243
Mr. Bellamy.

112
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,290
I've thought it over
and I don't think I...

113
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:56,623
- Oh.
...want this job.

114
00:11:56,793 --> 00:12:00,838
Excuse me. You must be Mr. Burke,
the one with the water cooler.

115
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:04,624
- I mean...
- And you must be Miss Welles.

116
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:08,172
Mr. Bellamy told me all about you.

117
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,676
Tell me, why are you
dismissing us so soon?

118
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:21,147
- Because I think show business is cruel.
- You're quite right. Have a seat.

119
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:24,272
- People do despicable things.
- Yes, they certainly do.

120
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:30,200
Like firing a girl because a crude person
like Miss Lawson resents her ability.

121
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:32,990
Please, have a seat.

122
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:39,036
Miss Welles, a raw recruit always dives
for cover at the first burst of enemy fire.

123
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:42,545
But don't let that happen to you.

124
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,799
Don't you throw in the towel just yet.

125
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:51,807
This is a rather cruel business. But it's
also a great and rewarding business.

126
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:57,561
For every Helen Lawson, there's always
a Helen Hayes or a Mary Martin.

127
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,601
Now you think about that.

128
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:06,562
- Well, may I have the contracts?
- Yes.

129
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:12,860
- They are signed?
- Oh... Well, one is.

130
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:22,668
Yes, yes. One is.

131
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,756
And legibly too.

132
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,011
I almost forgot. She gave me
a message for Mr. Bellamy.

133
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,678
- Yes?
- She said...

134
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,099
- Well, she said, "Tell that son of a..."
- Gun?

135
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,812
- Gun. "Tell him to get off his..."
- Yes, I think I know that message.

136
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:46,522
I'll see to it that Mr. Bellamy gets it.
Thank you very much, Miss Welles.

137
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:49,444
- Bye.
- Bye.

138
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:53,028
Miss Welles, you forgot your purse.

139
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,824
Thank you.

140
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:00,576
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

141
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm afraid I haven't made
a good impression.

142
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:07,207
On the contrary,
you've made an indelible one.

143
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,639
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

144
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:28,730
"Barely Pink."

145
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,278
Hey, look at Jennifer.
Hey, Jennifer?

146
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:55,717
Six hundred bucks for a headdress
and not a soul will see it.

147
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:59,141
- I feel a little top-heavy.
- Honey, you are a little top-heavy.

148
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,897
All right, that's fine, dear.
Thank you.

149
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:34,843
Hold it. Hold it!

150
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,393
Cut the song?

151
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:44,813
- The show is a little long.
- Wait a minute!

152
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:47,308
That's the best piece of music
in the show.

153
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:52,355
- Take out one of Miss Lawson's songs.
- Miss Lawson is the star.

154
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:58,909
- The public pays to see her.
- But I'll have nothing but a few lines left.

155
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:03,583
- I'm sorry, Neely. We have no alternative.
Don't listen to him.

156
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,669
He's protecting Old Ironsides.

157
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:10,088
This was her idea.
She can't stand the competition.

158
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,674
- Let's skip the personalities.
- You've got a run-of-the-play contract.

159
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:18,967
They'll pay me $200 a week
to sit in my dressing room?

160
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:21,936
They've got to, Miss O'Hara.

161
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,553
If that's the way you want it.

162
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:28,396
Personally, I'd walk away with dignity.

163
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,653
There'll always be another show
and a better part...

164
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,779
...providing you have talent.

165
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,282
Talent? You know damn well
she has talent!

166
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:41,830
Believe me, by next week every producer
in town will be after you.

167
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,125
It gives you stature
to walk out on Helen Lawson.

168
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:50,496
Don't listen. They want you to quit
so they can save 200 bucks a week.

169
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,212
- Call your agent.
I know her agent.

170
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:58,303
I can tell you what he'll say.
"Take whatever crumbs are offered."

171
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:02,716
He's not about to give up
his lousy 10 percent.

172
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:08,275
If she were my client, I'd advise her
to leave the show with dignity.

173
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,979
Well, he's not gonna get
his lousy 10 percent.

174
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:17,445
Because I won't settle for crumbs.
I'll leave this stinking show...

175
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,952
...with dignity.

176
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,285
You can call Helen Lawson.

177
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,000
Tell her the SOB earned his oats.

178
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:36,087
We could all use a little fresh air.
Come on.

179
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:42,306
I had such big plans.
I was gonna be a big star.

180
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:46,225
I was gonna take acting lessons
and dancing lessons.

181
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:50,181
Now I don't even have a job.
All I have is my dignity.

182
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:55,195
Honey, I'm sorry.
That old witch ought to be boiled in oil.

183
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:58,023
Thanks, Jen.

184
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:05,407
Honey, listen. It's a rotten business.

185
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,830
I know. But I love it.

186
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:13,089
- That poor girl. And she was so good.
- I know.

187
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,256
After she signs the release the song
will go back in. With the understudy.

188
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,880
Go to the office. On my desk
you'll find a musical arrangement.

189
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:24,592
Get it to Miss O'Hara
and tell her to learn it fast.

190
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,973
- She'll be singing it tonight.
- Suppose she won't do it?

191
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:32,015
- I wouldn't.
- Then make her.

192
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:38,567
One of the nice things
about doing this telethon...

193
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,526
...in addition to raising money,
is discovering new talent.

194
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:47,497
I think you'll love our next performer.
Let's have a nice reception...

195
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,001
...for lovely Neely O'Hara.
Everybody, let's hear it out there.

196
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,465
Thank you very much.

197
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,093
You're right. It is an exciting business.

198
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:06,096
How about that? Where are you going?
Neely, you'll raise a lot of money for us.

199
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,638
Tell Frank, Dean and Sam
they're gonna have to wait.

200
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,353
Thank you.

201
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,283
- Dom Perignon, 1959.
- Fine.

202
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:30,161
The closest I ever got to champagne was
seeing it broken on a ship in a newsreel.

203
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,992
- Welcome, folks.
- Hello, Frank.

204
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,041
- Lyon.
- Hello.

205
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,370
- Miss O'Hara.
Hello.

206
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:40,710
I caught the telethon. We're doing
great business with Tony Polar.

207
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,589
So I see.

208
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,635
Excuse me.

209
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,055
Frank.

210
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:08,537
There's Jennifer with one of her
rich boyfriends. Doesn't she look great?

211
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:12,951
She's lovely.
- I bet beads pop off when she moves.

212
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,583
- Vodka and tonic.
- Same for me. Make it two.

213
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:21,915
Neely, I have some good news. You're
following Tony Polar in the club here.

214
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,501
- Oh, Lyon!
- Neely, how wonderful.

215
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,546
You'll have to build an act fast,
because I exaggerated a bit.

216
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:32,135
- I told Frank you already had one.
- I will. I will.

217
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,521
- Miriam's not gonna like that.
- Who's Miriam?

218
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:08,818
- His sister. Over there.
- She manages him.

219
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:13,038
She does very well.
He won't make a move without her.

220
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:15,079
He's making one now.

221
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:56,661
- Friend of yours?
- Never saw her before.

222
00:24:56,833 --> 00:25:00,831
- But I'm gonna see her again.
- How many times do I have to tell you?

223
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:06,674
- At night, all cats are gray.
- You worry too much.

224
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,893
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

225
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:24,814
I haven't snitched milk
since I was a kid in Pittsburgh.

226
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:28,854
There were six of us
and I never got enough.

227
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,251
I can't stop thinking
about that audience tonight.

228
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,998
You don't know how it feels, Mel,
when they all applaud and whistle.

229
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:50,635
- They did whistle, didn't they?
- They sure did.

230
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:55,632
I felt like they were all taking me
in their arms and holding me.

231
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:01,849
It's like when you
put your hands on me...

232
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:06,104
...only it was double-triple.

233
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:11,653
This place is too small.
I'm gonna get a bigger place.

234
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:16,037
Maybe two rooms and a kitchenette.

235
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:22,788
Mel, let's get married.

236
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,461
I thought you'd never ask.

237
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,957
I'm not kidding.
I'll be making good money.

238
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:34,971
And with your 150 a week, we can really
live. We can get a maid to clean up.

239
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,976
We can get a mink coat.

240
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:41,560
Well, right now you better get
a good night's sleep.

241
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:45,396
So give me a double-triple.

242
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:57,659
Hello?
Yes, I'll accept the call.

243
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:04,450
Hello, Mother. I just got in.
I thought it was too late to call you.

244
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:09,416
But I just sent you $50
last week, Mother.

245
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:14,053
Okay, I'll send you $50 as soon
as I get my paycheck.

246
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:20,225
You told me Gran's been sick,
and I know about the oil burner.

247
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:25,899
I'll take the mink to Uncle Ayers' again.
He'll give me a couple hundred for it.

248
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,819
Mother, I know I don't have any talent...

249
00:27:28,987 --> 00:27:34,860
...and I know all I have is a body
and I am doing my bust exercises.

250
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:39,911
Goodbye, Mother. I'll wire you
the money first thing in the morning.

251
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:53,340
Oh, to hell with them. Let them droop.

252
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:06,851
Look, the models have goose bumps.

253
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:11,445
Yes, and come July
they'll be sweltering in mink.

254
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,156
You must be frozen.

255
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:17,072
- Are you sure you wanna walk?
- Positive.

256
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:23,703
Oh, how beautiful.

257
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:27,743
Oh, no. Sorry. Jewelry's not for you.

258
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:31,172
Maybe one single strand of pearls.

259
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:36,134
But not creamy.
Pink, to match your skin.

260
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:49,142
And don't expect flowers either,
because only white lilacs suit you.

261
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:53,067
And they're very difficult
to come by in New York in February.

262
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:56,608
But make a note,
remind me to send you some in May.

263
00:28:56,826 --> 00:29:01,903
- Are you wooing me, Mr. Burke?
- If you wish to be wooed.

264
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:06,161
What about that fraternity pin you wear?
That's Sigma Chi, isn't it?

265
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:09,787
- Deke.
- Oh, Deke. Yes.

266
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:13,665
It can mean everything or nothing.

267
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,464
Then I'll settle for nothing.

268
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:25,511
Did you know you are the most beautiful
girl that ever left lipstick in my office?

269
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:31,975
- You like women, don't you?
- I like career girls. We're compatible.

270
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:37,029
- It's said they don't make good wives.
- I'm not looking for a wife.

271
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,696
Some men just don't pull well
in double harness.

272
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:48,252
You're fortunate. You know yourself.
I don't know who I am or what I want.

273
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,836
I only know I have to find out.

274
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:16,291
Off-stage I hate her,
but on-stage I'm madly in love with her.

275
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:05,535
- Do you think it's a hit?
- It is with me.

276
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:08,158
But we'll have to wait until
4 a.m. For the reviews.

277
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,331
4 a. m? Good heavens,
what do we do until then?

278
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,712
We could go to Helen's hotel suite,
listen to four-letter words and wait.

279
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:18,871
I have a better idea.

280
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,500
My father used to come here
when he was at Yale.

281
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,052
Well, I'm an Oxford man myself.

282
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:28,802
I know all about you.

283
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:31,265
You do?
- I know your mother was English...

284
00:33:31,437 --> 00:33:36,230
...she was an ingénue at the Drury Lane
Theatre and you look exactly like her.

285
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,227
Well, not exactly, I hope.

286
00:33:47,495 --> 00:33:49,986
And when your uncle died,
you took over his business.

287
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:53,450
Oh, good old Steinberg.
Well, what would you like to have?

288
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:57,078
- Sherry, please.
- Good. Two sherries.

289
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:03,169
Did she also tell you that I once
thought that I could write?

290
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:06,760
Oh, I'm sure you could. You turn
a very neat phrase when you dictate.

291
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:08,307
Oh?

292
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:12,096
You know, I'm beginning
to like the agency business.

293
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:17,478
Every man a potential Henry Higgins
waiting to discover his Eliza Doolittle.

294
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,644
Thank you.

295
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,403
Thank you.

296
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:26,360
It's funny.

297
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:29,405
I used to come here weekends,
but tonight it's not the same.

298
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,162
No noisy students,
no drinking songs.

299
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,210
It seems the two of us
are alone in the world.

300
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:39,792
We are. You know that.

301
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:42,671
I've known it for a long time.

302
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:04,083
Beautiful.

303
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:10,962
Now, you call this acting?

304
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:52,152
Actually, this is a celebration.

305
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,278
I've been talking with the Coast.

306
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:56,612
They wanna test you
and Tony out there next week.

307
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:58,070
Oh.

308
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:02,459
I have the scenes right here.
And a song, a really good one.

309
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:05,498
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

310
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,591
- Telephone for you. It's your Aunt Amy.
- I'll call back.

311
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,010
She says it's very important
she speak to you.

312
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:15,637
Something must be wrong.
Excuse me.

313
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:17,601
Mother's not been well.

314
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,639
Miriam, here's a copy for Tony.

315
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:23,347
Incidentally, where is Tony?

316
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:27,767
Well, I know who he's with, but I don't
know where. I can't reach him.

317
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:29,356
Well, find him.

318
00:38:29,614 --> 00:38:32,319
I know you owe Miriam a lot, Tony...

319
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:36,157
...but I wish we didn't have to meet
in such out-of-the-way places.

320
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:41,324
I'll bet I'm the only showgirl who's
ever been inside the Statue of Liberty.

321
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:47,454
Honey, it's just that Miriam
doesn't want me to get serious.

322
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:51,625
Are you serious, Tony?

323
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:54,380
You know I am, baby.

324
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:58,221
But Miriam's got this thing
about marriage.

325
00:38:58,393 --> 00:39:01,311
She thinks it'll destroy
what she calls my image.

326
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,731
And there's something else.

327
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:10,070
I've never quite been able
to put my finger on it.

328
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,654
Maybe she's jealous.

329
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:17,159
No, not Miriam. She raised me.

330
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:19,245
Did without.

331
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:22,250
Worked like a dog
to get me my singing lessons.

332
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:26,372
Maybe that's why
she's so careful with money.

333
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:28,581
We always had so little.

334
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:31,427
Yeah. It's the same with us.

335
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:35,805
When my father died, my mother and
grandmother thought I was such a drain.

336
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:42,225
All I ever heard was how much I ate
and how much it cost to buy me shoes.

337
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:46,809
It got so I panicked when I thought
my shoes were getting too small.

338
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,983
- It's freezing here.
- It certainly is.

339
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,656
Let's go to your place. We'll unhook
the phone so Miriam can't bother us.

340
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,235
How's that? Come on.

341
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:00,492
Oh...

342
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:04,623
My mother said
I should've held out...

343
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,543
...and made you marry me.
- Oh, baby.

344
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,922
But when did I ever do anything
my mother told me to?

345
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,785
A telegram for a Miss Polar.

346
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:45,625
One second. You have to sign this.

347
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,922
Thank you.

348
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:05,639
Dr. Eberhart, this is Miriam Polar.

349
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:09,474
Yes. I called you
because I'm worried.

350
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,352
Tony just got married.

351
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,772
No, I never told him.

352
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:21,034
I know I should have, but I couldn't.
I couldn't do that to him.

353
00:41:21,204 --> 00:41:23,956
After all, it might not ever happen.

354
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,119
Well, the point is that...

355
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:34,750
...we'll be leaving for California
next week and...

356
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:38,093
...you'd better give me the name
of a doctor there.

357
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,390
I wanted to come for your
mother's funeral. Why didn't you let me?

358
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,478
It's my own grief.
I didn't wanna put you through it.

359
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:48,972
From what you said,
she's a wonderful woman.

360
00:41:49,149 --> 00:41:50,893
Yes, she was.

361
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:24,513
Anne, it's a dream town.

362
00:42:25,353 --> 00:42:27,392
I can almost hear
Paul Revere's hoofbeats.

363
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:29,639
He passed us by.

364
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:33,481
There was a scandalous rumor
going around we were pro-British.

365
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:38,315
I'm sorry you missed Aunt Amy. She's
gone to the cousins' in New Hampshire.

366
00:42:57,594 --> 00:43:02,552
Everything is better here. It
really is. I don't know how you ever left.

367
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:05,968
- Be careful.
- Hot!

368
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:12,399
I have an idea. Why don't we leave
the rat race and move up here?

369
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:15,521
I could write my book.
Or at least try.

370
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:18,898
- You really think you'd be happy?
- Of course I would.

371
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:23,819
Woods to tramp, river to fish.
This wonderful old house.

372
00:43:23,995 --> 00:43:27,614
And you beside me on that marvelous
old four-poster upstairs.

373
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:29,949
Well, it's a marriage bed, Lyon.

374
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:34,420
- You were thinking of marriage?
- Well, you know how I feel about that.

375
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:37,674
When you fall in love,
you belong to someone else.

376
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:42,591
We've gone through this before.

377
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:47,596
How do you think I feel sneaking out of
your apartment at 4:00 in the morning?

378
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,977
But you don't have to sneak.

379
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:52,768
And don't tell me I knew
what I was doing.

380
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:56,275
But you did. You knew.

381
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:58,853
But I loved you.

382
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:08,658
Does it make any difference how
or why it happened? It happened.

383
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:10,955
And for that I'm grateful.

384
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,512
Come on.

385
00:44:30,813 --> 00:44:32,604
Come on.

386
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:37,566
You think I could sleep with you,
here in this house?

387
00:44:45,161 --> 00:44:47,948
No, I guess you couldn't.

388
00:44:55,046 --> 00:44:58,166
I guess I should've known.
You're afraid of ghosts.

389
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:01,626
I'm not. And none of them ever loved
each other more than I love you.

390
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:05,587
- But not enough to marry me.
- But that's beside the point.

391
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:08,885
I'll get you a cab.
You can stay at the hotel.

392
00:45:11,688 --> 00:45:13,182
All right.

393
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:15,313
You do that.

394
00:45:55,565 --> 00:46:00,062
- Lyon Burke, please.
- I'm sorry, Miss Welles. He checked out.

395
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:06,362
He left this for you.
Johnny was just going to bring it over.

396
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:24,083
<i>Dear Anne, thank you</i>
<i>for the moment of reckoning.</i>

397
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,972
<i>You once said I knew</i>
<i>who I was and what I wanted.</i>

398
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:30,674
<i>I've always wanted to write.</i>
<i>So I'm going back to England...</i>

399
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:34,719
<i>... find the counterpart</i>
<i>of Lawrenceville and see if I can.</i>

400
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:38,308
<i>Somewhere in your wonderful New York</i>
<i>there is the right man...</i>

401
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:41,271
<i>... just waiting for you to find him.</i>

402
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:45,564
<i>Thank you for the loveliest winter</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

403
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:47,533
<i>Lyon.</i>

404
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:03,211
- How was lunch?
- I wasn't very hungry.

405
00:47:03,384 --> 00:47:05,542
- Mr. Bellamy wanted cigarettes.
- Oh, not now.

406
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,594
He's got a big new account in there.

407
00:47:07,763 --> 00:47:11,975
Say, I still have one of Queeny's kittens
left. Would you like to have it?

408
00:47:12,226 --> 00:47:14,848
It's a male, honey.
It won't give you any trouble.

409
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:17,773
A male in the
Martha Washington Hotel for women?

410
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,269
You could always move.

411
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:23,779
- Yes, Mr. Bellamy?
<i>Send in Miss Welles.</i>

412
00:47:23,947 --> 00:47:26,023
- Who's he with?
- Kevin Gillmore.

413
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:29,319
He made a mint
with that new hairspray.

414
00:47:30,995 --> 00:47:32,869
Miss Welles.

415
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,123
Take this down, please:

416
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:37,083
Point number one.

417
00:47:37,252 --> 00:47:42,708
The girl who introduces our products
on our show will be called the Gillian Girl.

418
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:44,211
Two.

419
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:48,049
She must be beautiful,
but more important, she must be refined.

420
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:49,846
Cultured.

421
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,007
A girl like Miss Welles here.

422
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:56,183
- That's not a girl. That's my secretary.
- We don't want artificial beauty.

423
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:58,928
We want the kind
that our audience can identify with.

424
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:00,352
College girl.

425
00:48:00,525 --> 00:48:04,060
Young matron will think she'll
look like you if she uses our product.

426
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:05,945
- I'm flattered, Mr.?
- Gillmore.

427
00:48:06,114 --> 00:48:08,522
- But I'm not an actress.
- I don't want an actress.

428
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,780
I want an unknown. A girl to be identified
with Gillian products exclusively.

429
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:16,703
- I will start her off at $300 a week.
- Gillmore, that's sabotage.

430
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:19,449
It's also very tempting.

431
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:22,415
Why don't we have dinner
and talk it over?

432
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,877
Okay, but bring the contract to me
before you sign it.

433
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:16,590
<i>KNBC, Los Angeles.</i>

434
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:21,180
<i>Celebrating the second anniversary</i>
<i>of the Gillian Girl...</i>

435
00:49:21,357 --> 00:49:25,604
<i>... Gillian products offers</i>
<i>a Gillian Girl's birthday special.</i>

436
00:49:25,778 --> 00:49:30,571
<i>Gillian high-fashion makeup.</i>
<i>Gillian high-fashion lipstick.</i>

437
00:49:31,242 --> 00:49:34,741
<i>Helps soothe natural curls</i>
<i>as it sets your hair.</i>

438
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:40,666
<i>After your shampoo just comb,</i>
<i>roll up, then brush out.</i>

439
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:52,127
<i>Gillian makeup gives grace and elegance</i>
<i>to that high-fashioned look.</i>

440
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:56,682
<i>Gillian makeup gives you just enough</i>
<i>accent to that flawless complexion.</i>

441
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,226
Hello?

442
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,691
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

443
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:12,900
Hello, Mother? How are you?

444
00:50:14,035 --> 00:50:16,408
Yes, I'm watching too.

445
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,705
<i>Remember, the beautiful people</i>
<i>use Gillian's.</i>

446
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,796
She looks lovely.

447
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:31,800
She's coming to California next week.
I'll be seeing her.

448
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:35,802
I know she's making big money.

449
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:40,895
Mother, I can't send you
any more money this month.

450
00:50:41,063 --> 00:50:43,768
Miriam has me on a strict budget.

451
00:50:44,399 --> 00:50:47,151
Of course she's still living
with us. You know that.

452
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:51,613
If that's long distance, don't hang on
the phone. You know how much it costs.

453
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,402
Mom, I've gotta go now.
I'll write you tomorrow.

454
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,075
Okay. Bye.

455
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:00,370
<i>Continuing our presentation...</i>

456
00:51:00,582 --> 00:51:02,789
<i>... of the Grammy Awards,</i>
<i>coming to you...</i>

457
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,456
<i>... from the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton</i>
<i>Hotel in the heart of New York City.</i>

458
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,585
<i>Presently on the stage,</i>
<i>about to present a major award...</i>

459
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:16,549
<i>... is the toastmaster general</i>
<i>of the United States, Mr. George Jessel.</i>

460
00:51:16,724 --> 00:51:20,424
<i>And now... Now a special award</i>
<i>for Miss Neely O'Hara.</i>

461
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,104
Hey, Miriam. Come and look.
It's old home week.

462
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,917
<i>Just a few short years ago you're an</i>
<i>unknown little girl singing for her supper.</i>

463
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:53,507
<i>And now, because of the warm,</i>
<i>plush, lush notes that emerged from...</i>

464
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:58,174
<i>... your fair throat, you've become the</i>
<i>idol of movie fans and record buyers...</i>

465
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,849
<i>... all over the United States of America.</i>

466
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:07,607
<i>With the same elation that I felt when</i>
<i>I shook the hands of the great Caruso...</i>

467
00:52:09,277 --> 00:52:13,144
<i>... I happily present to you this Grammy</i>
<i>Award for your warm contribution...</i>

468
00:52:13,323 --> 00:52:15,778
<i>... to the recording industry.</i>

469
00:52:18,995 --> 00:52:21,830
<i>Thank you, Mr. Jessel.</i>
<i>I'd like to thank all of you here...</i>

470
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:24,406
<i>... and all of you out there</i>
<i>who made this possible.</i>

471
00:52:24,584 --> 00:52:29,542
<i>Don't forget to see my new film</i> Love and
Let Love <i>at the Music Hall this week.</i>

472
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:32,205
<i>- I sing some great new songs in it.</i>
<i>- Oh, good.</i>

473
00:52:32,384 --> 00:52:34,460
<i>- Goodbye.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

474
00:52:49,484 --> 00:52:51,228
Neely.
- Annie!

475
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:54,606
Congratulations.
- Thank you. How long has it been?

476
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:58,779
It's been too long. I'd like you to meet
Kevin Gillmore. This is Neely O'Hara.

477
00:52:58,952 --> 00:53:00,494
- How do you do?
- And her husband.

478
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:02,572
- How do you do?
- We're going to the Coast.

479
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:04,906
- Maybe we can get together.
- Give me a call.

480
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:08,499
I'd like to see how Gillian's hairspray
reacts to smog.

481
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,170
- Good to see you, Anne. Mr. Gillmore.
- It's nice to have met you.

482
00:53:18,138 --> 00:53:20,178
Hey, you know something?

483
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:22,389
I've never carried you across
the threshold.

484
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,935
Oh.

485
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:28,515
Thanks, I need it.
Hold that, honey.

486
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:33,270
- You have a hard day?
- A brute.

487
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,572
Sit down, will you?

488
00:53:39,452 --> 00:53:41,990
I might as well give it to you
all at once.

489
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:47,079
The studio dropped my option.

490
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:52,455
So what? There are other studios.

491
00:53:52,632 --> 00:53:55,383
You should've never done Westerns.
You're a romantic lead.

492
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:57,093
Sure, sure.

493
00:53:57,261 --> 00:54:01,176
Look! You're a singer.
You can always go back to nightclubs.

494
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:04,682
- I don't wanna go back to nightclubs.
- Will you do me a favor?

495
00:54:04,852 --> 00:54:07,770
- Will you not worry about it?
- He doesn't wanna go back.

496
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:11,272
- He wants to make pictures.
- I'm gonna heat up the lasagna.

497
00:54:17,198 --> 00:54:21,030
Boy, can I go for a drink.
Me too. It's charming.

498
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:24,239
Would you care for cocktails?
- Two martinis.

499
00:54:24,414 --> 00:54:26,074
Ma'am?
- Glass of red wine.

500
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:29,748
I'll have a scotch and soda.
Thank you.

501
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:41,429
Pardon me, Beth.

502
00:54:45,477 --> 00:54:49,177
Hello, Anne. Welcome to California.

503
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:51,680
- Jennifer.
- Lyon.

504
00:54:51,858 --> 00:54:54,729
- Tony, good to see you.
- Nice to see you again, Lyon.

505
00:54:54,903 --> 00:54:57,608
- Lyon Burke, Kevin Gillmore.
- Hello.

506
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:59,489
How do you do?

507
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,949
- Well, how long will you be in town?
Not half long enough.

508
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:06,872
Just two days,
then I'm taking Anne to Hawaii.

509
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,911
Wonderful. You'll love it.

510
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:13,668
- Incidentally, how did you like my book?
- I haven't read it.

511
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:17,172
Oh, you should.
It's dedicated to you.

512
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:19,300
I'll send you a copy.

513
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:22,628
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay.

514
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:26,009
If there's anything I can do
while you're here, please let me know.

515
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:30,017
You're too late, Lyon.
We saw them first.

516
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:33,938
Thanks just the same.
- Not at all.

517
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,068
Goodbye.

518
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:41,823
Goodbye.

519
00:55:44,954 --> 00:55:48,405
Well, I think I'll have
the butterfly steak.

520
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:52,078
Hi, Mel!

521
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:56,002
- The door was open.
Jenny, how are you?

522
00:55:56,173 --> 00:55:58,332
- It's good to see you.
- Oh, lovely to see you.

523
00:55:58,509 --> 00:56:00,217
Sit down.

524
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:01,880
Neely's at the studio.

525
00:56:02,054 --> 00:56:06,004
- Oh, I thought she had a few weeks off.
- Two weeks until she starts shooting.

526
00:56:06,183 --> 00:56:10,264
And wardrobe fittings, makeup tests,
publicity stills, you know.

527
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:13,973
You don't suppose there's a part
for Tony in the picture, do you?

528
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,475
You can ask her, Jen,
but I wouldn't count on it.

529
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:21,281
She'll be home any minute. She's with
Ted Casablanca trying on new clothes.

530
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:23,906
Only in Hollywood do women faint...

531
00:56:24,077 --> 00:56:27,944
...because some queer
deigns to design their clothes.

532
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:30,245
Maybe you could put
in a good word for Tony.

533
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:33,204
Me? She doesn't listen to me.

534
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:35,121
I'm the last person to ask her.

535
00:56:35,797 --> 00:56:38,252
She's changed, Jen.

536
00:56:38,424 --> 00:56:42,802
She starts at 5:30 in the morning still
punchy from last night's sleeping pills.

537
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:49,142
So she takes a red pill to pep herself up
and at midnight she's still flying.

538
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:53,394
- I try to talk to her, it's like a brick wall.
- Well...

539
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:57,148
...I guess that's one of the drawbacks
of being a big star.

540
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:59,979
Hey, you know what these are?

541
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:03,156
One month's check she has to sign.

542
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:07,405
All the dough she makes, we still
had to borrow to pay the income tax.

543
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:13,748
Attorney, agent, manager,
secretary, doctor, maid, masseuse...

544
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:17,917
...voice coach. She sings like a bird.

545
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,759
- Psychiatrist.
- Psychiatrist?

546
00:57:20,926 --> 00:57:24,971
Oh, yeah, the studio wants her
to find out why she's so exhausted.

547
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:28,804
They say they think
it must be emotional conflicts.

548
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:34,351
Conflicts, my foot.
There aren't enough hours in the day.

549
00:57:34,648 --> 00:57:40,153
The headshrinker says she's insecure.
That she needs mass love.

550
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,811
Maybe I'm lucky
I don't have any talent.

551
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,484
Hi, Jen.

552
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:47,410
- Mel, get me some skim milk, will you?
- Want something?

553
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:49,452
I'll have a Coke.

554
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:59,245
Jen, I don't know what I'm gonna
do about Mel. He's changed so.

555
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:01,630
He just can't seem to get with it.

556
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:05,216
What do you mean, Neely?
He's gotten you lots of good publicity.

557
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:08,964
That was the studio.
They told him to butt out.

558
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:13,186
They don't even want him on the set.
They say he makes me self-conscious.

559
00:58:14,313 --> 00:58:16,983
Ted Casablanca says
he's the joke of the town.

560
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:20,690
I wouldn't pay any attention to that.
You know how bitchy fags can be.

561
00:58:20,903 --> 00:58:23,441
He's not even 30
and he's made over a million bucks.

562
00:58:23,614 --> 00:58:27,066
- Here we go.
- Mel, hand me my bag, will you?

563
00:58:27,243 --> 00:58:28,951
Thank you.

564
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:33,494
Well, I've lost 5 pounds already.
These pills are really great, Jen.

565
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:35,244
They kill your appetite.

566
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:38,869
Only trouble is,
they pep me up so much I can't sleep.

567
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:43,963
Well, what nice, fattening thing
did you tell Arlene to make tonight?

568
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:45,298
Arlene quit this morning.

569
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:49,883
She said you yelled at her. That's
three cooks in three months, Neely.

570
00:58:50,058 --> 00:58:51,635
She was a louse anyway.

571
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:54,929
You said yourself she was
taking home all the booze.

572
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:57,679
Other people have loyal help,
why can't we?

573
00:58:57,857 --> 00:59:00,183
You don't know how to talk to them.

574
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:04,568
That's your job. You better start
running this house properly.

575
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:07,984
I'm not the butler, Neely.

576
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:11,694
You're not the breadwinner either.

577
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:15,541
I'm afraid I better be running along.

578
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:19,580
- See you soon.
- Bye, Jen.

579
00:59:20,964 --> 00:59:23,455
That was a rotten thing
to say in front of Jenny.

580
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,544
Why?

581
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:27,510
She knows the facts of life.

582
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,380
You two sit around on your rumps
all day while Tony and I slave.

583
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,423
I can get off my rump
and go back to New York.

584
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:37,936
- I can always get my old job back.
- Suit yourself.

585
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:39,814
I'm too tired to argue.

586
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:42,391
I've got to take a shower
and get back to Ted's.

587
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:47,030
You know you're spending a lot more
time than necessary with that fag.

588
00:59:48,492 --> 00:59:51,991
Ted Casablanca is not a fag.

589
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:56,159
And I'm the dame who can prove it.

590
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,999
Thanks for making up my mind.
I should've left long ago...

591
01:00:03,173 --> 01:00:06,756
...but I kept remembering the old Neely.
She was quite a girl.

592
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:11,340
Now you're just like all the rest of them.
Success is too big for you.

593
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,265
If you ask me, my success
is too big for you.

594
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:18,145
Yeah, sure.

595
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,390
Sure it is.

596
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:26,655
I'll just take this. It's the only thing
around here that belongs to me.

597
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:07,644
I wrote about the things I knew.
My own experiences.

598
01:01:07,822 --> 01:01:10,740
But I guess I only had one book in me.

599
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:15,903
- Was I really that naive?
- Naive and wonderful.

600
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:18,288
I missed you, Anne.

601
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,501
Oh, I went back to the agency business.
And I like it.

602
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,918
- Incidentally, Neely's one of my clients.
- Really?

603
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:31,717
I don't know. England's changed.

604
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:33,845
Or I've changed.

605
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:38,009
The nightingale somehow
just sounded off-key.

606
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,478
I used to pretend you'd
gone bald and fat.

607
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:48,067
I pictured you at a sink full of
dishes. And a baby tugging at your skirt.

608
01:01:51,783 --> 01:01:54,321
Are you really going to marry Kevin?

609
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,032
I was, but now I realize
it's impossible.

610
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,374
I'm glad.

611
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,457
You know, every girl
I met always washed out.

612
01:02:11,053 --> 01:02:13,722
Just couldn't stand up to your image.

613
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:33,241
I am not taking you to a bistro.
I'm taking you home to bed.

614
01:02:33,409 --> 01:02:35,567
- As in sleep, which you need.
- Miss O'Hara?

615
01:02:35,744 --> 01:02:37,903
Yes?
- Would you autograph my program?

616
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,740
Of course.

617
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,076
There's Neely with Casablanca.

618
01:02:42,251 --> 01:02:44,540
- Where?
- Over there.

619
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:47,497
Let's try and catch up to them.

620
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:49,543
- Thank you.
- Darling, let's leave.

621
01:02:49,717 --> 01:02:53,631
Here comes Tony Polar.
He's gonna put the bite on me for a job.

622
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:03,230
I could've sworn Neely saw us.

623
01:03:03,397 --> 01:03:08,059
Well, she's near-sighted, darling.
She can't see 10 feet in front of her.

624
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,981
Yeah.

625
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:15,992
Tony! Are you okay?

626
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:18,160
I don't know.

627
01:03:18,496 --> 01:03:20,821
My legs just seemed to give way.

628
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:27,873
- Happened the other day on the set.
- I think you ought to see a doctor.

629
01:03:28,047 --> 01:03:31,879
No, I'm all right. Come on.

630
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:34,508
Tony!

631
01:03:35,972 --> 01:03:40,634
- Jen.
- Tony! Tony.

632
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:43,764
Tony.

633
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:46,729
There.

634
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,147
- He'll sleep for a while.
He didn't know me.

635
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:56,861
- He didn't know where he was.
- Go out. The doctor will explain it to you.

636
01:03:57,035 --> 01:04:01,827
It's called Huntington's chorea.
It's relatively rare.

637
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:05,332
Unfortunately, there is no cure.

638
01:04:05,502 --> 01:04:11,375
The symptoms of physical and mental
degeneration first appear about age 30.

639
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:18,134
There's a loss of muscular control.
Chances for inheritance are very high.

640
01:04:18,307 --> 01:04:21,806
Tony's father had it.
I kept hoping it wouldn't hit Tony.

641
01:04:22,603 --> 01:04:26,731
Now you can see
why I was against his marrying.

642
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:33,528
- Will he be able to walk again?
- As soon as the sedation wears off.

643
01:04:33,697 --> 01:04:36,698
But the motor disturbances
will occur again.

644
01:04:36,867 --> 01:04:40,651
And there will be periods
of blankness and hallucination.

645
01:04:41,163 --> 01:04:46,620
It may take a year before he reaches
the point of complete incapacity.

646
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:51,123
- Are there any further questions?
- No.

647
01:04:51,882 --> 01:04:54,717
Good night, Mrs. Polar.

648
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:03,683
If he becomes unmanageable,
we'll keep him sedated.

649
01:05:03,853 --> 01:05:08,147
He probably won't remember
any of this tomorrow. Good night.

650
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:10,688
Good night.

651
01:05:17,658 --> 01:05:19,485
Jen?

652
01:05:20,328 --> 01:05:23,779
Maybe you'll understand now why
I've been the way I've been.

653
01:05:23,956 --> 01:05:30,576
Money, for instance. I've put away
every cent I could get my hands on.

654
01:05:30,755 --> 01:05:36,176
We'll keep him at home
as long as we can.

655
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,428
- What about you?
- Tony and I had different fathers.

656
01:05:50,316 --> 01:05:56,106
I know how you love him.
I'm not blind. I thank you.

657
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:03,160
Miriam, I'm pregnant.

658
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:11,955
This way, Miss O'Hara.
This way.

659
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,004
Another.
This way.

660
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:18,088
What about Casablanca?
- Miss O'Hara has nothing to say.

661
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:21,512
Are you gonna marry?
Any comment?

662
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:26,094
- What about Ted Casablanca?
- You heard me. No comment.

663
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:30,730
Have any marriage plans?
What's your next film?

664
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:54,377
<i>Tony didn't realize where he was.</i>

665
01:06:55,924 --> 01:07:02,508
<i>The next day Miriam arranged a meeting</i>
<i>with a quirky European movie producer.</i>

666
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:11,596
Mr. Chardot, this is my sister-in-law.

667
01:07:11,774 --> 01:07:15,688
Mr. Chardot is from Paris.
He's out here looking for talent.

668
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:21,401
Mademoiselle Polar has shown me
your <i>photographie.</i>

669
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:26,451
I am interested
in a young lady with your...

670
01:07:26,622 --> 01:07:29,540
- How you say?
- Measurements.

671
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:34,121
In general, the French girl
is inclined to be flat in the bosom.

672
01:07:34,338 --> 01:07:37,754
I see. Just what kind
of pictures do you make?

673
01:07:37,925 --> 01:07:42,255
I make art films.
- I've seen a few. They're pretty raw.

674
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:45,965
French subtitles over a bare bottom
doesn't make it art.

675
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:49,143
Evil is only in the eye
of the beholder.

676
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:54,390
- My films are shown in your country.
- Jennifer...

677
01:07:55,318 --> 01:08:00,609
...you've posed undraped on the stage.
- That was before I married Tony.

678
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:03,985
It's up to you.
Tony wouldn't know the difference.

679
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:07,411
Well, I would.

680
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:12,289
<i>I realized I had to give in</i>
<i>and take the job.</i>

681
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:14,660
<i>The sanitarium was very expensive.</i>

682
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:18,622
All right, sheriff, you win.
You ran my father out of town...

683
01:08:18,842 --> 01:08:24,002
...now you're trying to run me out.
The Durneys don't give up that easy.

684
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:27,011
- It's too hot!
- Cut.

685
01:08:27,184 --> 01:08:30,138
Stand by.
- Well, it's too damn hot.

686
01:08:30,312 --> 01:08:34,440
- The cameraman's frying me.
Neely?

687
01:08:34,608 --> 01:08:36,647
- Shut up!
- She's full of sauce.

688
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:41,279
It's not booze, it's pills.
Send for her husband. Look, Neely...

689
01:08:41,448 --> 01:08:47,533
...we've got to finish this take.
- Get lost. I'm through for the day.

690
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:54,533
Get off the floor.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

691
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:57,202
- Zip up your dress.
I can't.

692
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:01,081
- It's bloat from those pills and booze.
I haven't had a drink all day.

693
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,466
You're going out there
and doing the scene.

694
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,629
How long do you think
you can get away with these antics?

695
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,926
Come on.

696
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:15,602
Give this to the hairdresser.
Miss O'Hara will be ready in a moment.

697
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:26,658
I wanna see Mr. Burke.
- He's not in, Miss O'Hara.

698
01:09:26,827 --> 01:09:31,454
"He's not in." That's all I've heard
at his office for three days.

699
01:09:31,624 --> 01:09:36,286
He's ducking me. He's giving me
the treatment, just like all the others.

700
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:40,329
- Where's Miss Welles?
He is in San Francisco, Neely.

701
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:44,256
Tell me something.
How come the boss of a big agency...

702
01:09:44,428 --> 01:09:49,090
...spends three days in San Francisco
with a lousy nightclub singer?

703
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:53,216
He's working overtime.
Why doesn't he look after my interests?

704
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:57,310
- I'm the one who pays his rent.
- You're being obnoxious.

705
01:09:57,483 --> 01:10:00,401
Oh, I'm sorry.

706
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:04,437
I want Lyon to talk to that director.
He's crucifying me.

707
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:07,949
- When's he due back?
- I'm not sure.

708
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:11,784
When a man says he won't do a scene,
that's called integrity.

709
01:10:11,956 --> 01:10:15,206
When a woman says it,
she's temperamental.

710
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:18,959
They say I'm difficult.
They say I'm drunk even when I'm not.

711
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,372
Sure, I take dolls, I gotta sleep.

712
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:25,713
I gotta get up at 5 in the morning
and sparkle.

713
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:31,308
- It's bad to take liquor with those pills.
- They work faster.

714
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:37,846
Here. With that guy of yours in
San Francisco you could use a few dolls.

715
01:10:38,024 --> 01:10:40,776
No, thanks.

716
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:42,482
Suit yourself.

717
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:46,283
You should make him marry you.

718
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:50,912
- Have you heard from Jennifer?
- Yeah.

719
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:54,865
She called me about six months ago.

720
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:58,997
You know what she asked me?

721
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:03,420
She wanted to know
where she could get an abortion.

722
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:06,299
An abortion. How do you like that?

723
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:12,014
She was the one who wanted kiddies
and the vine-covered cottage.

724
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:17,525
Then I heard she went to Paris
to make art films.

725
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:24,193
Art films.
Nudies, that's all they are. Nudies.

726
01:11:24,824 --> 01:11:29,652
That's her problem. She doesn't care
about me, so why care about her?

727
01:11:29,871 --> 01:11:32,658
- Nobody cares about me.
- That's not so!

728
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:38,081
Nobody cares if I live or die,
just so long as I write the checks.

729
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:43,545
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You're a big star. You have everything.

730
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:46,964
Oh, yeah.

731
01:11:47,138 --> 01:11:50,673
Yeah, yeah, I'm a big star.

732
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:57,054
I'm a big star.

733
01:11:57,649 --> 01:12:03,568
I tell myself that, Annie,
but I don't feel it.

734
01:12:03,738 --> 01:12:06,988
I don't feel anything anymore.

735
01:12:07,158 --> 01:12:10,195
I haven't slept with Ted in weeks.

736
01:12:11,204 --> 01:12:16,199
And that psychiatrist? Dr. Mitchell?

737
01:12:17,043 --> 01:12:22,749
Dr. Mitchell says
that I am self-destructive.

738
01:12:22,924 --> 01:12:25,961
So what?

739
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,675
What do I do about it?

740
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:37,058
The hell with them. The hell
with all of them. Who needs them?

741
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:42,142
Let them talk. Even the bad publicity
helps when you're as big as I am.

742
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:47,070
- And, boy, am I getting the bad publicity.
- You've had enough of those.

743
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:51,025
- Now, try to calm down.
- Leave me alone!

744
01:12:51,203 --> 01:12:56,909
I can't even remember when somebody
wasn't nagging or pressuring me.

745
01:12:57,084 --> 01:13:00,535
You're upset.
Why don't you lie down for a while?

746
01:13:02,214 --> 01:13:03,839
No...

747
01:13:05,884 --> 01:13:08,375
...not alone...

748
01:13:09,138 --> 01:13:11,889
...not anymore.

749
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,884
I need a man to hold me.

750
01:13:18,063 --> 01:13:20,899
I need Mel.

751
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:25,898
I mean Ted.

752
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:33,194
I'm going home, Annie.
I'm going home to Ted right now.

753
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:37,664
Thanks for listening.
I really got a lot off my chest.

754
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:29,130
Ted? Honey, it's me.

755
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:05,499
It's not cold, huh?

756
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:10,959
Do you think she can hear us?
- Relax. She's so full of pills and booze...

757
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:15,004
...the San Francisco Earthquake
couldn't rouse her.

758
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:27,317
Having fun, kiddies?

759
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:32,024
Don't mind me, go right ahead.
I'll watch.

760
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:38,235
You'd better run, you little tramp.
How dare you contaminate my pool?!

761
01:15:38,414 --> 01:15:42,827
Here, maybe this will disinfect it.

762
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:48,620
All right, faggot, start explaining.

763
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:52,299
You need glasses, Neely.
She's hardly built like a boy.

764
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:56,421
- I could take that better.
- I'm sure you could.

765
01:15:56,933 --> 01:16:01,013
- You almost made me feel I was queer.
- You're crazy.

766
01:16:01,354 --> 01:16:02,848
- Am I?
- Yes, you are.

767
01:16:03,022 --> 01:16:06,356
You want me to fight your studio battles,
take you to openings...

768
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:11,276
As a man, you're always too tired
and too full of those damn dolls.

769
01:16:11,614 --> 01:16:15,398
You've got guts. I catch you
red-handed with a naked broad...

770
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:19,989
...and you sermonize me!
- Not a sermon, just a few cold facts.

771
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:23,948
When I come home, I'm exhausted.
How can I think of sex?

772
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:28,041
Then why'd you sign the new contract?
You don't have to work. I make enough.

773
01:16:28,214 --> 01:16:31,334
You've got your new deal
and I have my sanity back.

774
01:16:31,551 --> 01:16:34,386
With that little whore?

775
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:40,050
That little whore
makes me feel 9 feet tall.

776
01:16:40,226 --> 01:16:45,185
- Please don't. I need you.
- You're damn right you do...

777
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:48,939
...but not as a man.

778
01:16:49,945 --> 01:16:52,696
You can go to hell.

779
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,690
Go to hell, you bastard!

780
01:17:11,049 --> 01:17:14,667
I tried to wake her, Mr. Burke,
but she wouldn't budge.

781
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:17,716
All right, thank you.

782
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:25,890
Neely. Neely.

783
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:32,779
Neely, wake up.
Come on, wake up.

784
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:41,871
You were due on the set
three hours ago.

785
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:47,323
- What set?
- Why didn't you show up?

786
01:17:49,588 --> 01:17:53,752
I couldn't, Lyon. I had a rotten night.

787
01:17:59,223 --> 01:18:02,058
- I want to tell you something.
- Stop yelling.

788
01:18:02,226 --> 01:18:05,429
- They're replacing you.
- They can't do that.

789
01:18:05,604 --> 01:18:10,563
- It so happens they can.
- My last picture grossed a fortune.

790
01:18:10,735 --> 01:18:13,439
It cost more than it grossed,
because of you.

791
01:18:13,613 --> 01:18:19,283
And now you've been out six days
because of pills and you walked out.

792
01:18:19,452 --> 01:18:23,402
And you've been boozing and eating
all through the picture.

793
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:29,002
- I'm the biggest box-office draw there is.
- Come on, get some sense in your head.

794
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:33,417
Stockholders are only interested
in one thing: Profits.

795
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:37,093
They're gonna replace you
with a younger girl.

796
01:18:37,261 --> 01:18:41,888
- Younger? Lyon, I'm 26.
- And you look 36.

797
01:18:42,058 --> 01:18:46,387
Look at that face. It's all puffy.
Your eyes are bloodshot.

798
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:49,682
Thank you very much.

799
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:56,525
I'm sorry, but I can't stand by and watch
a talent like yours go down the drain.

800
01:18:56,698 --> 01:19:00,031
You're my agent.
You're supposed to take care of me.

801
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:03,985
I'm trying to,
but you've gotta cooperate with me.

802
01:19:05,498 --> 01:19:08,583
What do you want me to do?

803
01:19:08,752 --> 01:19:13,330
I want you to go
to a sanitarium and dry out.

804
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:20,339
- A sanitarium?
- I'm sorry. It's the only solution.

805
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:25,593
Look, you just have to beat this thing.
You just have to beat it.

806
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,191
All right.

807
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:41,317
- All right. If you want me to go, I'll go.
- Good.

808
01:19:42,161 --> 01:19:46,621
Anne and I will come by
and pick you up at about 3:00.

809
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,958
United Airlines?

810
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:34,496
What time is your next flight
to San Francisco?

811
01:20:35,506 --> 01:20:39,551
Yes, one. O'Hara.

812
01:21:18,258 --> 01:21:23,050
- What do you say, baby?
- What do you mean, "baby"?

813
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:28,132
I'm Neely O'Hara, pal.
That's me singing on that jukebox.

814
01:21:29,978 --> 01:21:36,728
What are you, kidding? That dame's
great. You sound like a frog.

815
01:21:38,445 --> 01:21:41,316
Like a frog...

816
01:21:42,366 --> 01:21:45,070
- Take it easy. She's stoned!
- Get out of here!

817
01:21:45,243 --> 01:21:50,155
Who's stoned?
I'm merely traveling incognito.

818
01:21:50,332 --> 01:21:55,327
Well, get out of here, will you?
Go on, get out of here.

819
01:22:40,007 --> 01:22:43,590
Jennifer, shame on you.

820
01:22:44,887 --> 01:22:48,636
Still got that mole on your keister?

821
01:22:50,017 --> 01:22:54,264
Nope. They covered it up with makeup.

822
01:23:09,787 --> 01:23:14,995
Boobies, boobies, boobies.
Nothing but boobies.

823
01:23:15,376 --> 01:23:20,204
Who needs them?
I did great without them.

824
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:54,032
Who the hell are you?

825
01:23:55,917 --> 01:23:58,705
Who are you?!

826
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:19,562
Neely?

827
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:24,102
Neely.

828
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:39,913
- How do you feel, honey?
- Fine.

829
01:24:43,549 --> 01:24:46,550
It's a hospital.

830
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:51,180
- What am I doing in the hospital?
- You took an overdose of pills.

831
01:24:51,348 --> 01:24:53,590
Oh, God...

832
01:24:55,269 --> 01:24:59,896
- Did it get in the papers?
- Lyon told them it was accidental.

833
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:05,896
- Well, it was. It was. Honest.
- I know.

834
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:09,026
But the next time
you might not be so lucky.

835
01:25:10,201 --> 01:25:12,490
What am I gonna do?

836
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:16,906
We want you to go
to a sanitarium in Los Angeles.

837
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:19,788
- A nuthouse?
No.

838
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:25,548
- It's the same place Tony is in.
- I'm not nutty. I'm just hooked on dolls.

839
01:25:25,883 --> 01:25:29,964
- It's not a nuthouse.
- Getting off them is worse than dope.

840
01:25:30,138 --> 01:25:34,301
I'm scared. I've forgotten
how to sleep without dolls.

841
01:25:34,475 --> 01:25:37,476
I can't get through a day
without a doll.

842
01:25:37,645 --> 01:25:41,311
Please, Lyon, don't send me there.

843
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:44,056
I need a doll.

844
01:25:44,235 --> 01:25:50,949
Lyon, don't leave me here!
Get me a doll. Just one.

845
01:28:29,444 --> 01:28:33,572
Well, this is by far the best
we've made.

846
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:39,245
Fox would like to release the film
in the United States.

847
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:44,410
They have also offered
to buy your contract.

848
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:49,579
- Does that mean I can go home?
- I'm not sure I wish to sell.

849
01:28:50,966 --> 01:28:57,585
- Look, Claude, you'll make lots of money.
- True, but you will get half.

850
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:02,347
- I just want to go back and see Tony.
- What use is a man...

851
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:08,106
...who is no longer a man? A vegetable.
- Claude, please, stop it.

852
01:29:08,275 --> 01:29:12,653
I've hated this.
Go find yourself another girl.

853
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:18,567
Yes, I can. Younger. A real actress.

854
01:29:19,245 --> 01:29:23,622
- For what will you settle?
- Settle? I want my half.

855
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,745
Then I will not sell.

856
01:29:29,046 --> 01:29:34,717
All right, I'll settle for a third.
Anything. Just let me go home.

857
01:29:34,927 --> 01:29:40,847
Anything? Well, perhaps
we can make some arrangement.

858
01:29:41,017 --> 01:29:43,852
We'll talk about it later...

859
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:46,974
...at the apartment.

860
01:29:57,575 --> 01:30:02,071
I cursed you out at first,
but then I realized you did the right thing.

861
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:06,743
It was the only thing.
- I couldn't sleep that night.

862
01:30:06,918 --> 01:30:10,038
You should have taken a doll.

863
01:30:10,213 --> 01:30:15,456
No. I'm really very grateful.
Nobody else gave a damn.

864
01:30:15,635 --> 01:30:19,763
That's not true. There was a flood
of letters and telegrams from all over.

865
01:30:19,931 --> 01:30:22,303
We saved them for you.

866
01:30:22,475 --> 01:30:24,183
Thanks.

867
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:31,016
At first it was awful,
like living in a zoo.

868
01:30:31,234 --> 01:30:36,359
<i>The stuck me in this little room</i>
<i>with a big nurse with orthopedic shoes...</i>

869
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:40,446
<i>... who never left my side.</i>
<i>I asked for a cigarette.</i>

870
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:43,946
- Give me a cigarette.
- Two a day during social hour.

871
01:30:45,248 --> 01:30:49,377
I told her I had no intention
of socializing with kooks.

872
01:30:50,128 --> 01:30:53,580
I couldn't sleep. I needed a pill.

873
01:30:53,757 --> 01:30:58,336
I started screaming. I figured
they'd give me something to calm me.

874
01:30:58,512 --> 01:31:01,596
<i>They sure did.</i>

875
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:06,134
Get off me, you...
Let go of me!

876
01:31:06,311 --> 01:31:09,182
Let go!

877
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:16,692
<i>They ordered me to take off my gown.</i>
<i>I told them to drop dead.</i>

878
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,109
<i>They took it off for me.</i>

879
01:31:18,282 --> 01:31:20,405
No!

880
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:26,705
Then they stuck me in this big tub
and hooked a canvas around me.

881
01:31:26,874 --> 01:31:30,207
This young nurse sat there and
wrote down everything I said.

882
01:31:30,377 --> 01:31:33,213
<i>I used words that sure aren't</i>
<i>in medical books.</i>

883
01:31:33,422 --> 01:31:38,761
You stupid-ass nurse!
What are you looking at?

884
01:31:39,345 --> 01:31:44,137
<i>Actually, the water felt great.</i>
<i>It kept coming in and going out.</i>

885
01:31:44,308 --> 01:31:49,469
<i>I wanted to lie back and relax.</i>
<i>But that was what they wanted.</i>

886
01:31:50,398 --> 01:31:55,819
<i>I spotted this small hole in the canvas.</i>
<i>I started working at it with my toe.</i>

887
01:31:55,987 --> 01:32:00,399
<i>I got half my foot through it,</i>
<i>then I yanked my knee up to my chest.</i>

888
01:32:00,825 --> 01:32:04,241
Ow! Ow! Oh, God, it hurts.

889
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,116
<i>The nurse sounded the alarm.</i>

890
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:11,493
In the afternoon
we had recreation hour.

891
01:32:12,211 --> 01:32:15,129
<i>You never saw such a bunch</i>
<i>of well-bred kooks.</i>

892
01:32:15,298 --> 01:32:18,583
<i>They all acted as normal as apple pie.</i>

893
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,295
<i>I started playing checkers</i>
<i>with this cute little girl.</i>

894
01:32:22,472 --> 01:32:25,639
<i>All of a sudden she gets me</i>
<i>in a half nelson...</i>

895
01:32:25,809 --> 01:32:30,636
<i>... and accuses me of telling the rest</i>
<i>of the inmates she's a latent homosexual.</i>

896
01:32:36,069 --> 01:32:38,062
<i>You won't believe what happened next.</i>

897
01:32:38,613 --> 01:32:42,611
Once a week, we have a dance.
It's really camp.

898
01:32:43,034 --> 01:32:46,201
<i>I knew Tony was here</i>
<i>under an assumed name...</i>

899
01:32:46,371 --> 01:32:50,748
<i>... but I'd never seen him,</i>
<i>until one night...</i>

900
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:53,373
- Do you know "Come Live With Me"?
- Yes, I do.

901
01:32:53,545 --> 01:32:55,917
- Would you play it, please?
- Surely.

902
01:34:51,998 --> 01:34:54,833
Tony. Tony?

903
01:35:04,636 --> 01:35:10,425
When I saw that poor guy being led back
to his cell, I knew I was gonna make it.

904
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,930
You have made it, Neely.
And we're proud of you.

905
01:35:19,109 --> 01:35:25,313
Now business. How would you like to do
a Broadway musical for David Merrick?

906
01:35:29,328 --> 01:35:31,367
- You think I could?
- You know you could.

907
01:35:31,538 --> 01:35:33,910
Merrick believes in you.
And so do I.

908
01:35:34,082 --> 01:35:38,412
Lyon's checked with the doctors here
and they say you can do it.

909
01:35:46,887 --> 01:35:49,556
What about the bad publicity?

910
01:35:51,934 --> 01:35:56,762
It'll create sympathy.
People love to forgive.

911
01:35:58,691 --> 01:36:03,851
Lyon, I'm really in great shape.
I've changed. I've learned a lot of things.

912
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:07,398
I used to work my heart out,
kill myself.

913
01:36:07,575 --> 01:36:12,035
Not anymore.
There are things I want, Lyon.

914
01:36:12,204 --> 01:36:15,122
And I'm gonna get them.

915
01:36:16,584 --> 01:36:21,127
Know something, Annie? One of the
first things I'd like to have is your fella.

916
01:36:21,631 --> 01:36:24,466
You better watch out.

917
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:55,408
- How soon can I see him?
- You should remember him as he was.

918
01:36:55,582 --> 01:36:59,366
I want to see him, Miriam.

919
01:36:59,544 --> 01:37:02,213
All right.

920
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:06,922
I've booked you into a hotel
near the studio.

921
01:37:07,093 --> 01:37:10,178
Why did you write me
for a doctor's appointment?

922
01:37:10,347 --> 01:37:14,391
He's already told you
everything he knows.

923
01:37:14,559 --> 01:37:18,224
It's not about Tony, it's for me.

924
01:37:20,023 --> 01:37:22,810
It must have been a shock
to discover it.

925
01:37:22,984 --> 01:37:26,649
Lots of lumps mean nothing.
Some are only cysts, aren't they?

926
01:37:26,822 --> 01:37:29,526
Yes, but this one wasn't.

927
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:34,196
The doctor took a biopsy
and it's malignant.

928
01:37:35,122 --> 01:37:40,792
- Jen, I'm sorry.
- It's pretty hard to take.

929
01:37:40,961 --> 01:37:44,709
Tomorrow they have
to perform a mastectomy.

930
01:37:44,923 --> 01:37:47,628
Doctor says it's not
the end of the world.

931
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:52,629
He says lots of women live long
and happy lives after breast surgery.

932
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:57,806
- The point is to catch it in time.
- I'm sure they will.

933
01:37:57,978 --> 01:38:01,846
Afterwards you can come to the beach
with us and recuperate.

934
01:38:03,984 --> 01:38:06,024
I'd love to.

935
01:38:06,195 --> 01:38:09,813
You know, it's funny...

936
01:38:11,116 --> 01:38:14,070
...all I've ever had was a body
and now I won't even have that.

937
01:38:14,328 --> 01:38:17,662
Jen, stop talking like that.

938
01:38:20,209 --> 01:38:23,542
How am I gonna keep Tony
in the sanitarium?

939
01:38:25,548 --> 01:38:28,751
When I saw him,
he didn't even know me.

940
01:38:29,343 --> 01:38:32,795
Lyon will find you a job.
I know he will.

941
01:38:32,972 --> 01:38:37,183
Anne, let's face it, all I know how
to do is take off my clothes.

942
01:38:38,561 --> 01:38:40,518
Jen.

943
01:38:41,063 --> 01:38:46,021
Hello? Yes, I placed a call
to Milwaukee.

944
01:38:46,194 --> 01:38:48,945
Anne, I'm all right, really I am.
Run along.

945
01:38:49,113 --> 01:38:53,360
I'll stay with you tomorrow.
And don't you worry.

946
01:38:56,788 --> 01:38:59,076
- Bye.
- Bye.

947
01:38:59,624 --> 01:39:06,338
Hello, Mother, I had to talk to you.
There's something I have to tell you.

948
01:39:09,842 --> 01:39:14,054
I'm sorry Mrs. Gottlieb
was shocked at my pictures.

949
01:39:14,222 --> 01:39:18,469
No, I won't be undressing
in public anymore.

950
01:39:22,147 --> 01:39:25,266
What did I have to tell you?

951
01:39:26,067 --> 01:39:28,475
Nothing.

952
01:39:28,653 --> 01:39:31,323
Nothing.

953
01:40:00,602 --> 01:40:06,771
<i>Hello, Mother. I just got in.</i>
<i>I thought it was too late to call you.</i>

954
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:11,855
<i>But I just sent you $50</i>
<i>last week, Mother.</i>

955
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:16,242
<i>Okay, I'll send you $50 as soon</i>
<i>as I get my paycheck.</i>

956
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:22,321
<i>Tony!</i>

957
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:26,542
<i>- Jen.</i>
<i>- Tony!</i>

958
01:40:26,712 --> 01:40:30,128
<i>Tony! Tony!</i>

959
01:41:24,103 --> 01:41:26,262
<i>Let's go.</i>

960
01:42:28,502 --> 01:42:32,963
- You were the last one to see her alive?
Why would she take her life?

961
01:42:33,132 --> 01:42:35,623
- Was she depressed?
- She was in good spirits.

962
01:42:35,801 --> 01:42:38,422
Any reason why she'd take her own life?

963
01:42:38,595 --> 01:42:40,672
None. She was excited
about a new contract.

964
01:42:40,848 --> 01:42:43,090
- So it was accidental?
- Yes, I'm sure.

965
01:42:43,267 --> 01:42:47,810
Her measurements?
- That's enough. That's enough.

966
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:51,396
Break it up.
Come on, break it up. Break it up

967
01:43:09,919 --> 01:43:13,869
- A drink, a drink, a drink.
- I made one for you. Here.

968
01:43:14,048 --> 01:43:16,420
Thank you.

969
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:20,670
- What's that?
- Neely's.

970
01:43:20,847 --> 01:43:24,429
Neely's? Well, get rid of them.

971
01:43:29,355 --> 01:43:32,142
Do you have to go
to New York with Neely?

972
01:43:32,358 --> 01:43:35,692
Of course. You know I do.
I have to do my best for her.

973
01:43:35,862 --> 01:43:39,480
- Couldn't someone else go?
- No, she wants me.

974
01:43:39,657 --> 01:43:44,403
- She's scared. She needs someone.
- I know.

975
01:43:53,797 --> 01:43:58,423
- Darling, I'm worried.
- Why?

976
01:43:58,593 --> 01:44:03,588
- Neely spells trouble. She thrives on it.
- Yes, but she deserves a comeback.

977
01:44:03,765 --> 01:44:08,142
- I hate to think of you getting involved.
- Don't worry about that.

978
01:44:08,311 --> 01:44:10,434
I can handle her.

979
01:44:12,274 --> 01:44:14,812
I'm not so sure.

980
01:44:31,835 --> 01:44:34,207
Hello?

981
01:44:35,047 --> 01:44:38,712
Annie. Hi, how are you?

982
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,127
Lyon?

983
01:44:43,305 --> 01:44:49,094
I'm sorry, he's in the shower.
I'll have him call you back.

984
01:45:36,484 --> 01:45:41,062
- Where are you going?
- A press party for Helen Lawson.

985
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:45,071
- Her show's opening on Thursday.
- A party? Without me?

986
01:45:45,243 --> 01:45:50,830
Definitely without you. I'm keeping
you under wraps until your opening.

987
01:45:50,999 --> 01:45:53,916
- How's my tie?
- Bend down.

988
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,878
I hear the Lawson show
laid a big egg in Philadelphia.

989
01:45:59,048 --> 01:46:03,794
- I wanna go to the party too.
- You're the cutest and the cruelest.

990
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:06,971
Does anybody else have
a better right to gloat?

991
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:11,054
Baby, you may have a great talent,
but not for ties.

992
01:46:13,855 --> 01:46:15,515
Okay.

993
01:46:16,858 --> 01:46:21,152
Curl up with your favorite news analyst.
I'll be back early.

994
01:46:32,499 --> 01:46:36,627
A little closer together, please.
- Have you made many changes?

995
01:46:36,795 --> 01:46:40,378
Oh, yes, quite a few.

996
01:46:45,137 --> 01:46:48,921
Miss O'Hara. You look lovely.
- Thank you.

997
01:46:51,852 --> 01:46:54,010
- Who invited her?
- Nobody.

998
01:46:54,229 --> 01:46:58,061
It's great to have you back
in New York. You look marvelous.

999
01:46:58,901 --> 01:47:01,107
I thought you were keeping her
out of sight.

1000
01:47:01,278 --> 01:47:03,152
Should have kept her in a straitjacket.

1001
01:47:03,322 --> 01:47:07,402
- I'm very sorry, Helen.
- I think I'll sit this one out.

1002
01:47:08,285 --> 01:47:12,912
What are your plans?
That depends on Lyon Burke...

1003
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:19,499
I said, that depends on Lyon Burke.
He takes care of my affairs.

1004
01:47:19,672 --> 01:47:22,756
- And the rumors about you two?
- Marriage plans?

1005
01:47:22,925 --> 01:47:24,716
Well, we're both available.

1006
01:47:25,094 --> 01:47:27,881
Good evening, Miss Lawson.
Can I help you?

1007
01:47:28,055 --> 01:47:30,593
No, thank you.

1008
01:47:46,532 --> 01:47:50,696
Who are you hiding from?
The notices couldn't have been that bad.

1009
01:47:51,287 --> 01:47:55,783
- The show just needs a little doctoring.
- Don't worry. If it flops...

1010
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:58,710
...you can always understudy
for my grandmother.

1011
01:47:58,878 --> 01:48:03,754
Thanks. I've already turned down
the part you're playing.

1012
01:48:03,925 --> 01:48:07,294
Bull. Merrick's not that crazy.

1013
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:10,839
You should know.
You just came out of the nuthouse.

1014
01:48:11,349 --> 01:48:16,556
- It was not a nuthouse!
- They drummed you out of Hollywood...

1015
01:48:16,729 --> 01:48:19,933
...so you come crawling
back to Broadway.

1016
01:48:20,108 --> 01:48:24,153
Well, Broadway doesn't go
for booze and dope.

1017
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,405
Now, get out of my way,
I've got a man waiting.

1018
01:48:28,033 --> 01:48:32,908
- That's a switch from the usual fags.
- At least I never married one.

1019
01:48:33,413 --> 01:48:36,449
- You take that back, you old fag hag.
- Get your hands off of me.

1020
01:48:39,419 --> 01:48:41,791
- Oh, my God! It's a wig.
- Give me back my hair.

1021
01:48:41,963 --> 01:48:45,083
- Her hair's as phony as she is.
- Give me that.

1022
01:48:45,258 --> 01:48:49,422
Give me that, damn you!
What the hell are you doing in there?

1023
01:48:49,596 --> 01:48:53,380
Giving it a shampoo.
Goodbye, pussycat.

1024
01:48:55,685 --> 01:48:58,603
She threw it in the can.
I'll kill her!

1025
01:48:59,106 --> 01:49:03,815
- It won't even go down the john.
- Give me that wig!

1026
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:08,024
Okay, you want it back?

1027
01:49:08,198 --> 01:49:12,611
Here it comes. Special delivery.

1028
01:49:16,123 --> 01:49:20,749
So long, granny.
I'll tell your boyfriend not to wait.

1029
01:49:23,297 --> 01:49:25,503
How do I get out of here?

1030
01:49:25,674 --> 01:49:30,052
You can go through the kitchen.
It's right next door.

1031
01:49:30,846 --> 01:49:37,015
Sorry, Miss Lawson. What an awful thing
to do to a great star like you.

1032
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:49,190
I'll go out the way I came in.

1033
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:02,078
Not a word about quitting.

1034
01:50:02,253 --> 01:50:05,918
The going gets rough,
they all talk about retirement.

1035
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:10,337
Not me. I've had it rough before.
I'm a barracuda.

1036
01:50:10,511 --> 01:50:14,461
I don't need pills like Neely.

1037
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:17,511
Sure, I know you dried her out,
but it won't last.

1038
01:50:17,685 --> 01:50:21,897
Neely hasn't got that hard core
like me.

1039
01:50:25,985 --> 01:50:28,772
She never learned
to roll with the punches.

1040
01:50:28,988 --> 01:50:33,235
And in this business
they come left, right and below the belt.

1041
01:50:33,409 --> 01:50:37,359
Neely has no class.
No real down-to-the-gut class.

1042
01:50:37,872 --> 01:50:41,324
But she's talented, Henry.
She's really got it.

1043
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:44,537
I knew that when
I kicked her out of my show.

1044
01:50:44,713 --> 01:50:49,458
She'd never believe it,
but I'm sorry for her.

1045
01:50:49,634 --> 01:50:53,169
Nothing can destroy her talent...

1046
01:50:53,346 --> 01:50:55,920
...but she'll destroy herself.

1047
01:50:56,099 --> 01:50:59,515
And you, Lyon, you'd better watch it.

1048
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:02,058
Sure, everything's rosy now.

1049
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:05,065
You skip from one dame to another.

1050
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:10,234
But watch it, my friend.
Find yourself a good girl.

1051
01:51:10,405 --> 01:51:12,730
Have kids.

1052
01:51:12,908 --> 01:51:17,155
Or one day you'll wind up
alone like me...

1053
01:51:17,329 --> 01:51:21,492
...and wonder what the hell happened.

1054
01:53:56,573 --> 01:54:02,528
Allison's gotta go. I will not let her steal
the show. She almost did at rehearsal.

1055
01:54:02,705 --> 01:54:06,654
- It's too late. It can't be done.
- She hasn't got a contract.

1056
01:54:06,875 --> 01:54:09,960
She can be fired right now.
I want her out.

1057
01:54:10,129 --> 01:54:15,550
The old star sickness begins to appear.
No more gratitude, just power.

1058
01:54:15,718 --> 01:54:18,553
I'm not gonna do it, Neely.

1059
01:54:18,721 --> 01:54:24,842
You don't fool me, you're scared.
You wanna stay in good with Merrick.

1060
01:54:25,019 --> 01:54:28,222
I should've known this was
gonna happen. Anne warned me.

1061
01:54:28,648 --> 01:54:31,352
What the hell does Anne know?

1062
01:54:31,525 --> 01:54:36,768
I didn't get dough handed to me because
of my good cheekbones, I worked for it.

1063
01:54:36,948 --> 01:54:40,482
She's gone through life on a pass
because of her damn looks.

1064
01:54:40,701 --> 01:54:44,320
I wanna tell you something.
Everyone gets payback. Everyone!

1065
01:54:44,497 --> 01:54:50,001
I'm not everyone. I don't have to live
by stinking rules for ordinary people.

1066
01:54:50,211 --> 01:54:55,502
I licked pills, booze and the funny farm.
I don't need anybody or anything.

1067
01:54:56,217 --> 01:55:00,511
That's good, because I'm leaving.

1068
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:06,386
Who needs you? I'm sick of you.
You're just an agent.

1069
01:55:07,228 --> 01:55:09,020
And you're just a Helen Lawson.

1070
01:55:09,189 --> 01:55:13,566
And not even that,
because she's a professional.

1071
01:55:15,487 --> 01:55:20,149
They love Helen Lawson,
then they love Neely O'Hara.

1072
01:55:46,643 --> 01:55:50,059
Come on, you guys. Move it.
Come on. Let's go, girls.

1073
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:53,516
- Where's Miss O'Hara?
- She's in her dressing room.

1074
01:55:53,692 --> 01:55:56,776
Come on, move it down.

1075
01:55:56,945 --> 01:55:59,946
Curtain time, Miss O'Hara.

1076
01:56:00,449 --> 01:56:02,607
- Miss O'Hara?
- Where is she?

1077
01:56:02,784 --> 01:56:06,367
- She won't open up the door.
- Neely?

1078
01:56:06,538 --> 01:56:10,702
Open the door, you're on.
Neely?

1079
01:56:11,585 --> 01:56:15,453
- Hi.
- That's your costume for the second act.

1080
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:19,842
- I'll do the second act first.
- Quick, get the understudy.

1081
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:23,095
I'm ready, Mr. Hamilton.

1082
01:56:24,139 --> 01:56:27,805
You get lost, sister, I'm fine.
I'm just dandy.

1083
01:56:27,977 --> 01:56:30,515
Let go of me, you big jerk!

1084
01:56:36,652 --> 01:56:39,487
It's getting late.
I think we ought to go.

1085
01:56:39,655 --> 01:56:42,822
The understudy was great.
Thank you.

1086
01:56:42,992 --> 01:56:46,076
What happened to Neely?
Are you kidding?

1087
01:56:46,245 --> 01:56:52,248
They said she had laryngitis.
- Who had laryngitis?

1088
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,831
That new girl was terrific.
She sure was.

1089
01:56:56,047 --> 01:56:59,131
It was a lovely evening, nevertheless.

1090
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:02,467
My beautiful little dolls.

1091
01:57:02,637 --> 01:57:06,717
Just one, and one more.

1092
01:57:09,811 --> 01:57:12,728
We're closing now, Miss O'Hara.

1093
01:57:12,897 --> 01:57:15,269
All right, Edward. All right.

1094
01:57:16,025 --> 01:57:20,853
Here. Keep the change.

1095
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:24,150
Shall I call you a cab?

1096
01:57:25,076 --> 01:57:27,994
I don't need it.

1097
01:57:34,461 --> 01:57:37,415
I don't need anybody.

1098
01:57:37,589 --> 01:57:40,874
Because I got talent, Edward.

1099
01:57:41,051 --> 01:57:43,257
Big talent.

1100
01:57:48,391 --> 01:57:50,633
They love me.

1101
01:58:10,205 --> 01:58:15,544
Hey! Where is everybody?

1102
01:58:15,711 --> 01:58:20,171
Hey, everybody, where are you?

1103
01:58:20,382 --> 01:58:23,383
Where are you?

1104
01:58:39,068 --> 01:58:41,440
Gone.

1105
01:58:42,696 --> 01:58:44,488
Gone.

1106
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:49,243
Everybody's gone.

1107
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:52,866
The hell with them.

1108
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,958
Who needs them?

1109
01:58:56,711 --> 01:59:00,411
The whole world loves me!

1110
01:59:07,513 --> 01:59:10,763
Where are you?

1111
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:22,687
Lyon?

1112
01:59:26,532 --> 01:59:28,406
Anne?

1113
01:59:33,456 --> 01:59:35,449
Jennifer?

1114
01:59:37,752 --> 01:59:40,077
Ted!

1115
01:59:42,215 --> 01:59:44,920
Mel.

1116
01:59:46,302 --> 01:59:49,090
Oh, God...

1117
01:59:52,267 --> 01:59:54,094
God...

1118
02:00:01,651 --> 02:00:04,273
God?

1119
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:09,064
I'm Neely.

1120
02:00:10,619 --> 02:00:13,655
Neely O'Hara!

1121
02:00:19,544 --> 02:00:22,415
Oh, Neely.

1122
02:00:23,632 --> 02:00:28,341
Neely! Neely!

1123
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:57,331
For so many years
I prayed for this moment.

1124
02:00:57,499 --> 02:01:01,284
Now that it's come,
I don't feel a thing.

1125
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:10,337
Does that mean you won't marry me?

1126
02:01:10,513 --> 02:01:13,763
It wouldn't work, Lyon.

1127
02:01:23,484 --> 02:01:26,022
Isn't there anything I can do
