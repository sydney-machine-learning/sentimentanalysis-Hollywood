1
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,323
Calling Cape Com. Cape Com?

2
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:51,279
This is Jupiter 16.

3
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:53,452
Can you give a go for fourth orbit?

4
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:55,407
Cape Com to Jupiter 16.

5
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,292
Can you confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?

6
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:02,202
Roger. It all looks good
in the environmental control system.

7
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,960
OK. Everything looks good from here.

8
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,547
You have a go for fourth orbit.

9
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:09,716
Jupiter 16. Roger.

10
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:13,380
You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.

11
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:15,058
Jupiter 16, this is Cape Com.

12
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,057
Start your EVA when you're ready.

13
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,890
You have time in the other EVAs
for experiments.

14
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:22,061
So don't stay out too long, Chris.

15
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,388
OK, flight.

16
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,609
- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.

17
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:31,362
Cape Com to Jupiter 16. On my mark
it will be fourplus three seven.

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,408
Four, three, two

19
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,776
one, mark.

20
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:45,457
Cape Com, this is Chris.

21
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,495
I'm out.

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,669
Everything looks OK.

23
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,127
Good.

24
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,630
The manoeuvring unit works this time.

25
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,334
I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.

26
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:59,555
Cape Com to Hawaii,
this is flight control, come in.

27
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,260
Hawaii, roger.

28
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:05,176
Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.

29
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:06,855
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

30
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:10,314
An unidentified object is closing on you
fast from astern.

31
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:11,687
Can you see it?

32
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:16,437
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.

33
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,823
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,734
Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

35
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,112
An unidentified object is on our scope.

36
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:27,325
We see nothing.

37
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,451
Can you give me a bearing?

38
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,163
Appears to be coming up fast,

39
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:34,205
from astern.

40
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,378
Hey, now I see it.

41
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:39,048
It's another spacecraft!

42
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,593
Repeat, it's another spacecraft!

43
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,757
Does it looks like a close pass?

44
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,598
You're breaking up. Say again.

45
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,892
- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,104
It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!

47
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,066
I repeat, the front is opening up!

48
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,027
- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!

49
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,563
Do you read me? You're breaking up.

50
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,155
- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?

51
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,325
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,749
Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?

53
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:15,543
You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!

54
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,708
You're breaking up...

55
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:26,793
My lead line! It's cu...

56
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:32,054
Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

57
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:35,386
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,718
Hello, Houston.

59
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:39,938
We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.

60
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,473
Unidentified object is still orbiting.

61
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,563
Alert all stations and track him closely.

62
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:58,988
It is ridiculous for the Soviet government
to deny responsibility.

63
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,374
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.

64
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:05,124
The world knows
we are a peace-loving people.

65
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,295
I hereby give notice that in 20 days

66
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:10,093
the United States
will launch her next spaceship.

67
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:13,421
My government has instructed me
to inform you

68
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,137
that any interference with it
will be regarded as an act of war.

69
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,926
May I ask what motive

70
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,550
our Russian friends would have

71
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,308
for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?

72
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,060
My government sees this
as a blatant attempt

73
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:31,688
to gain complete and absolute control
of space itself for military purposes.

74
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,860
We don't agree.

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,445
Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced

76
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:39,944
that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.

77
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:42,830
Our tracking station in Singapore

78
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:47,333
reported faint echoes of this craft
coming down in the Sea of Japan area.

79
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,414
Might I suggest
that this is where you should

80
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:52,788
concentrate your intelligence forces?

81
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:56,624
The prime minister asked me to assure
you this is what we propose to do.

82
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,710
As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong
is working on it now.

83
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:12,354
Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?

84
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:14,522
You think we better?

85
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:16,644
No, just different.

86
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,652
Like Peking duck is different from

87
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,069
Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.

88
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,322
Darling, I give you very best duck.

89
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,491
That would be lovely.

90
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,238
We've had some interesting times
together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.

91
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,679
Take that door.

92
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,852
The bed!

93
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,271
- We're too late.
- At least he died on the job.

94
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,108
He'd have wanted it this way.

95
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:20,869
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed

96
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,416
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,

97
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,503
at the last trump.

98
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:30,498
For the trumpet shall sound and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

99
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,674
and we shall all be changed.

100
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:36,468
We therefore commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption,

101
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:40,726
Iooking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead.

102
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:42,809
Present!

103
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,062
Fire!

104
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,898
Fire!

105
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,942
Fire!

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,426
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.

107
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,530
Permission to come aboard?

108
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:29,899
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

109
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,991
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:43,251
Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.

111
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,420
Aye aye, sir.

112
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,675
- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.

113
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:56,427
You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.

114
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,598
We corpses have no sense of timing.

115
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,347
In you go... sir.

116
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:04,520
Thank you... ma'am.

117
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:18,159
- Sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

118
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,196
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.

119
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:26,408
Now you're dead, perhaps some of your
old friends will pay less attention to you.

120
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:30,079
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.

121
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:34,342
This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?

122
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:37,006
Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.

123
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:39,889
If our Singapore tracking
station is correct

124
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:43,300
about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?

125
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:46,056
We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork,

126
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:49,354
but the PM wants us to play it
with everything we've got.

127
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:52,767
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.

128
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:55,571
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?

129
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,486
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?

130
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,023
That's what you've got to
find out, and fast.

131
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,986
Before the real shooting starts.

132
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:06,903
This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.

133
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:11,118
When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.

134
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:13,493
Our man Henderson
will contact you there.

135
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:16,914
- Henderson.
- Captain here. Full ahead.

136
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,626
Right.

137
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:23,510
- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.

138
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:25,049
- 007.
- Sir?

139
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,933
We've only three weeks
to the next American launch.

140
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:29,517
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:33,427
My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one even earlier.

142
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,730
- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,940
By the way, how was the girl?

144
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,367
Which girl?

145
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,866
The Chinese one we fixed you up with.

146
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,368
Another five minutes, I'd have found out.

147
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,168
She'll never know what she missed.

148
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,545
Miss Moneypenny,
give 007 the password we've agreed

149
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,293
- with Japanese SIS.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:06,211
We tried to think of something
you wouldn't forget.

151
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:07,375
Yes?

152
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,806
I... Iove... you.

153
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,174
Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.

154
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:15,934
Don't worry, I get it.

155
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,804
Sayonara.

156
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:20,179
James... good luck.

157
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,098
Instant Japanese. You may need it.

158
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:29,104
You forget, I took a first
in oriental languages at Cambridge.

159
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,741
Stand by to load.

160
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:40,537
Lift to the launch!

161
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:47,212
Tube loaded.

162
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,288
Hubcap open.

163
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,083
Fire.

164
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,106
This is your ticket.

165
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,820
Thank you.

166
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,113
Dozo.

167
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,578
I love you.

168
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,915
I have a car nearby.

169
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,707
- Where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.

170
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:39,873
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.

171
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,094
Mr Henderson.

172
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,805
Wasn't Mr Henderson
able to come himself?

173
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,639
- I suppose not.
- Why?

174
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:54,977
He didn't say.

175
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:12,741
I think it's about hotel-time.

176
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:41,638
How long have you
worked for Henderson?

177
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:45,985
Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.

178
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,912
- Mr Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?

179
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,002
Mr Henderson would like
to see you alone.

180
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:23,724
Do come in.

181
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,770
Mr Henderson?

182
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:29,938
At your service.

183
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,409
I believe you wanted to
ask me some questions.

184
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,869
Yes. Excuse me.

185
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,665
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.

186
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:03,051
I lost that in Singapore in '42.

187
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:07,468
You must excuse
this rather odd mixture of styles,

188
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:10,437
but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.

189
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:13,647
Very fond of some of these old things.

190
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,812
- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.

191
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,862
I myself have lived here for...

192
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,654
28 years.

193
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,191
And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.

194
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:30,656
- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?

195
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,459
He's head of the Japanese secret service.

196
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,249
And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.

197
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,418
When can I see him?

198
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:43,507
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?

199
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,217
His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.

200
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:49,919
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.

201
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:52,809
That's stirred not shaken.
That was right?

202
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:54,559
Perfect.

203
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:56,726
Cheers.

204
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,396
Russian vodka. Well done.

205
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:04,024
Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.

206
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:06,359
Amongst certain other things.

207
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,814
Now, look. I think London's theory

208
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:12,448
about the missile being fired
from this country is right.

209
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,115
I don't know how or where.

210
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,702
And don't ask me who's doing it either.

211
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:24,084
But I have a fairly shrewd idea
that a major foreign power is behind it all.

212
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,882
You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?

213
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:30,210
It's not Russia, old boy, I'm sure of that.

214
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,383
It's not Japan either.

215
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:36,806
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...

216
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,332
Good evening.

217
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:07,162
Cheers.

218
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,459
Siamese vodka?

219
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,540
There he is!

220
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:52,796
Freeze!

221
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:11,105
Get in, quick!

222
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,366
What the hell's the score?

223
00:28:20,996 --> 00:28:23,665
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.

224
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,830
Like you helped Henderson?

225
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,117
I'm taking you to a place of safety.

226
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:31,538
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.

227
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:35,752
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.

228
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,133
Welcome.

229
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,811
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.

230
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,890
It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.

231
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:44,025
And how do you like our country so far?

232
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:51,035
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.

233
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:54,826
The one thing my honourable mother
taught me long ago

234
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:57,743
was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.

235
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:01,920
But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl!

236
00:30:06,258 --> 00:30:09,793
You have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr Bond.

237
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:17,348
You are James Bond, aren't you?

238
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:25,724
I am so very pleased to meet you,
Bond-san. I really am.

239
00:30:26,735 --> 00:30:28,858
Permit me to introduce myself.

240
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:32,321
My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.

241
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:35,533
If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?

242
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:38,903
I... Iove you.

243
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,743
I'm glad we got that out of the way.

244
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,958
I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.

245
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:47,125
They're from Osato's safe.

246
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,540
This is an order for naval stores.

247
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:56,376
500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.

248
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,346
What is lox?

249
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:02,143
An American name for smoked salmon.

250
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:05,352
But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen.

251
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,518
Which makes rocket fuel.

252
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,687
- Very interesting.
- Yes.

253
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:11,643
We must go.

254
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:14,860
The journey out will be more dignified
than the journey in.

255
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,063
That wouldn't be difficult.

256
00:31:17,198 --> 00:31:19,486
I'd like that negative enlarged.

257
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:21,656
OK.

258
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:29,117
My private train.

259
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:31,623
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.

260
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:34,504
In my position, it would be most unwise.

261
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,211
Very convenient.

262
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:44,176
I imagine that your Mr M in London
has a similar arrangement.

263
00:31:44,306 --> 00:31:46,345
M? Oh yes, but of course.

264
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:49,428
Then the girl in the white
sports car's one of us.

265
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,387
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.

266
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,229
- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.

267
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:57,139
Do you like Japanese sake,
or would you prefer vodka martini?

268
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,103
Oh, no. I like sake.

269
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:04,321
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.

270
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,525
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.

271
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,826
For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.

272
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:14,952
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.

273
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:23,919
A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.

274
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,007
My men found a microdot on the paper.

275
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:28,175
Enlarge!

276
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:33,760
It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel.'

277
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:37,012
'The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution.'

278
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:40,680
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.

279
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:44,184
They killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?

280
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,477
Can you make it bigger?

281
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,439
Ning-Po.

282
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:51,609
Check motor vessel Ning-Po. Full details.

283
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:54,696
All recent movements
and present whereabouts.

284
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:58,949
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!

285
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:01,573
Ama. Diving girls.

286
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,749
Can you identify that coastline?

287
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,918
Given time, yes.

288
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:14,422
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr Osato.

289
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:17,224
Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?

290
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:18,677
Of course.

291
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:21,382
But tonight, consider my house yours.

292
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,686
Including all of my possessions,
naturally.

293
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:36,024
My friend, now you take
your first civilised bath.

294
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:38,695
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.

295
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:42,658
Place yourself entirely in their hands,
my dear Bond-san.

296
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:46,074
Rule number one...
is never do anything for yourself

297
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,367
when someone else can do it for you.

298
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:51,040
- And number two?
- Rule number two:

299
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:54,997
in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.

300
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,339
I might just retire to here.

301
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:06,471
Your English girls would never perform
this simple service.

302
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:08,974
I know one or two
who might get round to it.

303
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:11,595
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?

304
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:14,269
We have our sources,
Bond-san, just like you.

305
00:34:15,527 --> 00:34:18,231
Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?

306
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:27,612
I suppose you know what it is about you
that fascinates them.

307
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:32,408
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.

308
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,582
Japanese proverb say,

309
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:38,210
'Bird never make nest in bare tree.'

310
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,258
If Henderson's theory is right,

311
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:49,005
why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?

312
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:52,723
Because if they were discovered,
they could deny responsibility.

313
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:56,019
Especially if some private organisation's
doing the work.

314
00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:58,186
- Osato?
- Perhaps.

315
00:34:58,316 --> 00:35:01,103
Mr Osato is one of
our greatest industrialists.

316
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,978
No, he's merely a front.

317
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:06,112
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.

318
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,568
Could be.

319
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:10,534
Now, massage. Which girl do you select?

320
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:18,245
I'll settle for this little old lady here.

321
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,621
Good choice.

322
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:21,791
She's very sexyful.

323
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:33,216
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.

324
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:38,549
But unfortunately...
we had to cut it short.

325
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:42,268
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.

326
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,769
So, we never got around to finishing it.

327
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:49,435
This time, you shall finish it.

328
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:54,109
Aki.

329
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,495
No one will disturb you tonight.

330
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:11,503
I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.

331
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:38,942
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.

332
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,612
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

333
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,372
Please come in, Mr Fisher.

334
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,288
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

335
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,460
You are three and a half minutes early.

336
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,628
Please be seated.

337
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:26,166
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?

338
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:29,381
Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.

339
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,547
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,626
- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.

341
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:37,803
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

342
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:40,803
I always take a glass in the morning.

343
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:43,390
- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.

344
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,648
- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.

345
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:56,858
A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr Fisher.

346
00:38:56,991 --> 00:39:00,739
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.

347
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,954
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.

348
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:11,709
So, you are the new managing director

349
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,665
- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.

350
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,419
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?

351
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:19,220
He died rather suddenly, poor chap.

352
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:21,254
Ah, so. From what?

353
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:23,428
He fell into a pulveriser at the works.

354
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:25,596
Ah, so.

355
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:27,765
How shocking.

356
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:32,179
- A very honourable death, all the same.
- Very.

357
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,557
He gained great face with the company.

358
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:39,269
I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself, Mr Fisher.

359
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:41,812
Me? I never take any risks.

360
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:44,819
You forgive me for saying so, but...

361
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,825
I think you are taking one now.

362
00:39:48,747 --> 00:39:49,742
I am?

363
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,995
You should give up smoking.

364
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,201
Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.

365
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:57,040
Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest.

366
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,914
Really?

367
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:02,084
You must tell me what I can do for you.

368
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:05,917
We're interested in the bulk-buying
of fermentation chemicals.

369
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:09,138
Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.

370
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:12,848
- Would you like a manufacturing licence?
- Yes, very much.

371
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,105
I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations

372
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:20,018
and delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.

373
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,649
We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.

374
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:26,732
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.

375
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:30,282
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

376
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:33,363
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.

377
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:37,368
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

378
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:43,584
Kill him.

379
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:01,592
Get down!

380
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,851
294 here. Tiger, immediate.

381
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:49,018
Come in, 294.

382
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:54,272
Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.

383
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:56,478
I'm heading south for Highway Two.

384
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:58,689
Arrange usual reception, please.

385
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:37,366
- How's that for Japanese efficiency?
- Just a drop in the ocean.

386
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:42,582
- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.

387
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,951
Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals.

388
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:49,001
- That fits. Go on.
- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.

389
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:52,382
Sailing for Shanghai
at 5pm this afternoon.

390
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:56,843
Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately
to look her over.

391
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:59,594
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.

392
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:01,967
Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.

393
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:04,141
Tiger, contact M.

394
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:07,102
Tell him to send Little Nellie.

395
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:09,271
Repeat, Little Nellie.

396
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,689
Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.

397
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,859
Most urgent. Understood?

398
00:44:13,988 --> 00:44:15,612
Understood.

399
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:44,508
Condensation: ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.

400
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:17,750
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.

401
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:19,919
I'm not leaving you.

402
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:23,748
Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.

403
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:25,711
Go now.

404
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:56,632
Take him to Number 11.

405
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,884
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?

406
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,557
Where am l?

407
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:07,725
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.

408
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:11,603
Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.

409
00:47:12,192 --> 00:47:13,983
I've got you now.

410
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,102
Enjoy yourself.

411
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:21,654
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.

412
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:25,235
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.

413
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,537
And why were you
snooping around the docks?

414
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:31,619
I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.

415
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:33,459
You are a liar.

416
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:42,509
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.

417
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:45,341
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.

418
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:48,382
They use it to slice off skin.

419
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:54,308
I hope you won't force me to use it.

420
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,231
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

421
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,456
I have a confession to make.

422
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:20,329
What?

423
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:23,035
Actually, I'm a spy.

424
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:25,212
I know that.

425
00:48:30,513 --> 00:48:33,882
I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business?

426
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:41,053
I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.

427
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:42,470
And...

428
00:48:42,607 --> 00:48:44,765
Well, it's worth

429
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:46,977
$300,000.

430
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:48,977
So?

431
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:53,407
I'll split it with you if you'll get me
out of here and back to Tokyo.

432
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,657
That's a nice offer.

433
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:59,653
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.

434
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,414
Why?

435
00:49:06,879 --> 00:49:08,919
Osato would kill me.

436
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:16,052
We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and l.

437
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:43,569
The things I do for England.

438
00:49:54,381 --> 00:49:58,544
Now, you are going to need some
very close... protection tonight in Tokyo

439
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:02,092
because... well, that's when
they'll try and get at you.

440
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:04,261
You'll need the best man we've got.

441
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,429
And who do you suggest?

442
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:08,387
Well,

443
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:09,717
me.

444
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:13,056
I'm afraid I have another appointment
tonight, Mr Fisher.

445
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:18,275
I'm awfully sorry to leave you...
but I have to get off.

446
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:19,989
Chasing girls will be the end of you,
Bond-san, I have told you before.

447
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,795
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.

448
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,126
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.

449
00:51:25,255 --> 00:51:27,248
- Would you?
- Heaven forbid.

450
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:29,173
Any progress?

451
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,218
Yes. We identified
the coastline in the photograph.

452
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:37,006
It is an island called Matsu, on the direct
route between Kobe and Shanghai.

453
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:39,383
We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter.

454
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:41,676
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.

455
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:45,227
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.

456
00:51:45,357 --> 00:51:48,192
But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.

457
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:50,559
That one we took last night.

458
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,948
And that one, early this morning.

459
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:59,074
- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.

460
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,610
Fully laden here and empty here.

461
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,869
I want to take a fast look
at the island now.

462
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,499
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.

463
00:52:10,463 --> 00:52:13,582
Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?

464
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:17,665
Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring
journey, probably to no purpose.

465
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:20,258
I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.

466
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,861
I have much curiosity, Bond-san.

467
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,781
What is Little Nellie?

468
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,526
She's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.

469
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,868
Can do anything. Just your type.

470
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:49,990
A toy helicopter?

471
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:53,706
No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.

472
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:56,706
We've made some improvements
since you used her last.

473
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:00,587
- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!

474
00:53:00,717 --> 00:53:02,793
Take my helicopter instead.

475
00:53:04,262 --> 00:53:06,301
Right. Now pay attention.

476
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,100
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?

477
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:12,261
100 yards, using incendiaries
and high explosives.

478
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:14,387
Two rocket launchers,

479
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:17,142
- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.

480
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:21,651
Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.

481
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:23,058
Good.

482
00:53:23,196 --> 00:53:25,817
Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.

483
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:29,531
- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.

484
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:33,533
Aerial mines. Now remember,

485
00:53:33,664 --> 00:53:36,119
use them only
when directly above target.

486
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:39,583
- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.

487
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,211
Cine camera.

488
00:53:42,338 --> 00:53:45,671
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck!

489
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,172
I'll contact you when I get over the island.

490
00:53:48,302 --> 00:53:50,425
Be careful, Bond-san!

491
00:54:51,276 --> 00:54:53,352
Hello, Base One.

492
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:56,985
I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.

493
00:54:57,115 --> 00:54:58,988
We'll keep listening.

494
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:30,760
Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.

495
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,896
Understood. Carry on.

496
00:58:30,475 --> 00:58:32,515
- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.

497
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:34,683
Little Nellie got a hot reception.

498
00:58:34,813 --> 00:58:37,185
Four big-shots made
improper advances,

499
00:58:37,315 --> 00:58:40,232
but she defended her honour
with great success.

500
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:42,482
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.

501
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:44,651
Russian space shot imminent.

502
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,781
Proceed vector4-6 degrees
and await instructions.

503
00:58:47,908 --> 00:58:49,900
- Understood?
- Roger and out.

504
01:02:05,713 --> 01:02:08,749
Clear the area. Clear the area.

505
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:20,972
Prepare for reception.

506
01:02:22,311 --> 01:02:24,351
Prepare for reception.

507
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:27,940
Radar blackout is now complete.

508
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:32,026
Radar blackout is now complete.

509
01:02:49,669 --> 01:02:52,291
Moscow radio's already saying we did it.

510
01:02:52,422 --> 01:02:55,209
The president's called
a press conference for 2pm.

511
01:02:55,341 --> 01:02:57,713
He'll deny emphatically we were involved.

512
01:02:57,843 --> 01:02:59,883
- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.

513
01:03:00,012 --> 01:03:02,170
No one will believe the Russians did it.

514
01:03:02,306 --> 01:03:05,556
Now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.

515
01:03:05,684 --> 01:03:10,144
Houston to Washington. We followed him
for one orbit, now he's offthe screen.

516
01:03:10,271 --> 01:03:12,311
That means he's coming down.

517
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,390
- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.

518
01:03:17,153 --> 01:03:20,272
The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.

519
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,445
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.

520
01:03:22,574 --> 01:03:25,943
We've re-photographed
every square inch.

521
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:03,813
Ventilator fans to full power.

522
01:04:03,945 --> 01:04:05,985
Open all air ducts.

523
01:04:06,114 --> 01:04:08,153
Area safe to enter.

524
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:10,322
All crews to stations.

525
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:12,657
All air ducts to normal.

526
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,536
Air ducts opened.

527
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:18,823
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.

528
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:21,874
Fire guards to station.

529
01:04:33,097 --> 01:04:36,347
Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.

530
01:04:38,935 --> 01:04:40,975
Reception complete.

531
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:45,561
Withdraw captive spaceship.

532
01:04:48,778 --> 01:04:50,817
Guards to stations.

533
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,307
Remove the prisoners.

534
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:48,784
I shall be in my apartment.

535
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,075
I may send for you later.

536
01:06:20,027 --> 01:06:23,692
I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.

537
01:06:23,823 --> 01:06:26,776
We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.

538
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:30,194
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?

539
01:06:30,328 --> 01:06:33,779
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.

540
01:06:33,915 --> 01:06:35,457
Hans!

541
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:43,753
You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.

542
01:06:44,675 --> 01:06:48,624
They can strip a man to the bone
in 30 seconds.

543
01:07:00,272 --> 01:07:03,688
I have decided to ask for
a little money in advance.

544
01:07:03,817 --> 01:07:08,146
I want the sum of 100 million dollars,
in gold bullion,

545
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,901
deposited in our account in Buenos Aires.

546
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:13,523
Our agreement states
no money should be paid

547
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,194
until war has broken out
between Russia and the United States.

548
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:21,493
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.

549
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,080
Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.

550
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:28,248
Osato and Number 11, report now.

551
01:07:43,103 --> 01:07:46,269
An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.

552
01:07:46,398 --> 01:07:48,307
Correct, Number One.

553
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:51,395
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.

554
01:07:52,403 --> 01:07:55,653
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.

555
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,982
James Bond.

556
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:02,696
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.

557
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,158
Rubbish.

558
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,281
Bond is alive.

559
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,741
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?

560
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,042
Don't tell me you let him go.

561
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,671
I gave Number 11
the strictest orders to eliminate him.

562
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:17,626
And did she?

563
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,882
She failed.

564
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,345
You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.

565
01:08:23,473 --> 01:08:26,260
This organisation
does not tolerate failure.

566
01:08:26,392 --> 01:08:29,310
- I know, but you see, l...
- Go!

567
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:32,934
Well?

568
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:44,070
Osato!

569
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:55,747
Kill Bond! Now!

570
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,910
Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.

571
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:41,836
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.

572
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:45,579
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.

573
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:47,837
Next time it will be war.

574
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:50,884
- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.

575
01:09:51,011 --> 01:09:54,095
We'll also need
a company of first-rate men.

576
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:56,380
Do you have any commandos here?

577
01:09:56,516 --> 01:09:58,555
I have much, much better.

578
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,467
Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-san.

579
01:10:02,396 --> 01:10:04,436
This is my ninja training school.

580
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:14,690
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.

581
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:53,146
This must develop
very fast reflex actions.

582
01:10:53,276 --> 01:10:55,019
And spiritual strength.

583
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:31,017
Now, we will see some modern ninjas.

584
01:11:34,564 --> 01:11:36,603
My plan is this.

585
01:11:36,732 --> 01:11:38,772
I make a base on the Ama island.

586
01:11:38,901 --> 01:11:41,356
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.

587
01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:44,401
They will be workers and fishermen.

588
01:11:44,531 --> 01:11:46,570
- What about me?
- Later.

589
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,151
But for the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.

590
01:11:50,286 --> 01:11:51,911
Very powerful.

591
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:54,575
See the holes in the back
for jet propulsion.

592
01:11:58,127 --> 01:12:00,796
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.

593
01:12:02,506 --> 01:12:04,628
This is our special baby rocket.

594
01:12:06,009 --> 01:12:09,460
Very useful for people who smoke
too many cigarettes, like you.

595
01:12:16,727 --> 01:12:19,644
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.

596
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:23,270
- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.

597
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:28,228
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.

598
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:30,687
Second, you train hard and quickly

599
01:12:30,823 --> 01:12:33,230
to become a ninja like us.

600
01:12:33,784 --> 01:12:37,319
And third, to give you extra-special cover,

601
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:39,493
you take a wife.

602
01:12:48,089 --> 01:12:50,046
Regretfully impossible.

603
01:12:50,174 --> 01:12:52,001
You must marry Ama girl.

604
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,210
One who is known on the island.

605
01:12:54,344 --> 01:12:57,678
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.

606
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,222
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.

607
01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:05,932
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.

608
01:13:06,063 --> 01:13:08,471
But first, you must become Japanese.

609
01:13:13,654 --> 01:13:16,524
Eyepieces to Hera.

610
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:24,492
Why don't you just
dye the parts that show?

611
01:13:34,464 --> 01:13:37,963
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.

612
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:46,433
Tiger said, from now on,

613
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:49,476
you must do everything Japanese-style.

614
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:51,595
Everything?

615
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,769
Good for Tiger.

616
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,054
I'm...

617
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,841
I... I...

618
01:16:04,976 --> 01:16:06,007
Aki!

619
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:08,183
I'm...

620
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:18,901
She's dead.

621
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,029
Poisoned.

622
01:16:25,578 --> 01:16:27,820
Tiger, we must get to that island.

623
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:31,241
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.

624
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:15,614
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

625
01:17:19,127 --> 01:17:21,166
This man is a stranger from outside.

626
01:17:23,131 --> 01:17:25,372
It's lucky we're getting out of here.

627
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:29,339
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker, with humble Japanese wife.

628
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:31,509
Yeah, with a face like a pig.

629
01:21:04,332 --> 01:21:06,371
My men are already ashore.

630
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,540
All over the island.

631
01:21:08,669 --> 01:21:12,417
We have four days left.
It is not much time.

632
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:15,934
This is my house.

633
01:22:18,524 --> 01:22:21,062
My friend has made us some food.

634
01:22:23,153 --> 01:22:25,193
Do you live here alone?

635
01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:27,943
Yes. My parents are dead.

636
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:30,114
Sit down, please.

637
01:22:32,287 --> 01:22:33,864
Oysters.

638
01:22:33,997 --> 01:22:36,618
Is this the only room there is?

639
01:22:36,749 --> 01:22:38,492
Yes.

640
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:40,665
That is your bed.

641
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:42,834
I shall sleep over there.

642
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:47,584
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.

643
01:22:47,717 --> 01:22:49,757
You gave false name to priest.

644
01:22:49,886 --> 01:22:53,089
But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.

645
01:22:53,222 --> 01:22:55,713
No honeymoon. This is business.

646
01:23:00,312 --> 01:23:02,554
I won't need these.

647
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:34,629
- Bond-san.
- What's wrong?

648
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,131
The Americans have changed
the launching date.

649
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,303
The countdown has already started.

650
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:43,516
The president has given
a last warning to the Russians.

651
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,264
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.

652
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:50,144
- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.

653
01:23:50,274 --> 01:23:52,314
Everything is so normal around here.

654
01:23:52,443 --> 01:23:54,732
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.

655
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:57,981
Yesterday an Ama girl
rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.

656
01:23:58,115 --> 01:24:00,736
- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.

657
01:24:00,867 --> 01:24:03,275
And when her boat floated out again,

658
01:24:03,411 --> 01:24:05,238
she was dead.

659
01:24:07,206 --> 01:24:10,291
- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.

660
01:24:10,418 --> 01:24:12,743
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.

661
01:24:14,546 --> 01:24:16,586
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.

662
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:18,458
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.

663
01:25:00,922 --> 01:25:02,749
All right?

664
01:25:02,882 --> 01:25:04,921
Now, where is this cave?

665
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:07,090
It's straight across.

666
01:25:07,219 --> 01:25:09,259
The cave is over there.

667
01:25:38,122 --> 01:25:40,162
Gas. Get over the side.

668
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,619
Quick!

669
01:26:06,648 --> 01:26:09,815
Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.

670
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:12,769
Did you notice the sulphur on the walls?

671
01:26:12,904 --> 01:26:14,943
- The yellow?
- Yes.

672
01:26:15,073 --> 01:26:18,323
It was once an underground outlet
for the volcanic lava.

673
01:26:18,451 --> 01:26:22,116
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.

674
01:26:22,246 --> 01:26:24,571
It leads all the way,

675
01:26:24,707 --> 01:26:26,201
right up to the top.

676
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,622
That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?

677
01:26:28,752 --> 01:26:31,421
Of course. It's business.

678
01:26:31,546 --> 01:26:32,957
Good.

679
01:26:51,147 --> 01:26:53,187
May I rest a moment?

680
01:26:53,316 --> 01:26:55,355
Surely.

681
01:26:58,654 --> 01:27:00,693
It's hard work.

682
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:03,823
Some honeymoon!

683
01:27:32,059 --> 01:27:35,309
It's going down! lnto the volcano!

684
01:27:40,275 --> 01:27:42,564
Heliport to position.

685
01:27:44,779 --> 01:27:47,187
The honeymoon's over. Come on.

686
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:25,560
This volcano isn't active, is it?

687
01:28:25,692 --> 01:28:28,017
It never has been. Not in my lifetime.

688
01:28:28,152 --> 01:28:31,272
There's been some
terrific heat here recently.

689
01:28:31,405 --> 01:28:33,481
What happened to the helicopter?

690
01:28:33,615 --> 01:28:35,655
It's down there somewhere.

691
01:28:36,576 --> 01:28:38,616
Come on.

692
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:42,739
Stand by. Mark.

693
01:28:42,874 --> 01:28:45,032
Stand by for ten-second countdown.

694
01:28:45,168 --> 01:28:46,959
10, 9, 8...

695
01:28:47,086 --> 01:28:49,873
All units worldwide
will remain at readiness

696
01:28:50,005 --> 01:28:52,247
so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.

697
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:54,500
..3, 2, 1.

698
01:28:56,386 --> 01:28:58,426
Ignition.

699
01:29:08,981 --> 01:29:12,231
This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.

700
01:29:33,545 --> 01:29:35,419
Is that deep?

701
01:29:35,547 --> 01:29:37,586
They usually are - very.

702
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:44,218
It's metal!

703
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:46,386
Wait here.

704
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,316
Heliport to takeoffposition.

705
01:30:09,828 --> 01:30:11,536
Open crater.

706
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,179
Emergency crews to stations.

707
01:30:34,976 --> 01:30:38,095
Go to Tanaka.
Tell him to come with every man he's got.

708
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:39,391
Yes.

709
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:15,506
Heliport to standbyposition.

710
01:31:57,885 --> 01:32:00,375
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

711
01:32:01,263 --> 01:32:03,302
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

712
01:32:13,732 --> 01:32:15,559
Attention, attention.

713
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:19,191
American target vehicle is now in orbit.

714
01:32:20,113 --> 01:32:23,280
Interception will take place
in two hours' time.

715
01:32:38,213 --> 01:32:40,252
Washington, this is Houston.

716
01:32:40,382 --> 01:32:42,421
Houston to Washington.

717
01:32:43,134 --> 01:32:46,966
Our vehicle is now
120 nautical miles altitude,

718
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,384
170 miles downrange.

719
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:56,887
Jupiter to Houston,
we now have second phase.

720
01:32:57,022 --> 01:32:59,014
Roger, Jupiter.

721
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:02,149
Four hours 36 minutes into the mission.

722
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:04,981
- Can you give us a time?
- Roger.

723
01:33:08,657 --> 01:33:10,697
Connect igniter cable.

724
01:33:12,202 --> 01:33:14,408
Connect igniter cable.

725
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:43,605
Radar technicians, report to control room.

726
01:33:44,732 --> 01:33:47,898
Radar technicians, report to control room.

727
01:34:07,044 --> 01:34:09,997
T minus 100 minutes and counting.

728
01:34:11,256 --> 01:34:14,257
Did you volunteer for astronaut training?

729
01:34:14,384 --> 01:34:17,550
In our country, we say cosmonaut.
Yes, both of us...

730
01:34:20,097 --> 01:34:22,884
Yes, since six months we started training.

731
01:34:23,934 --> 01:34:25,891
Good evening.

732
01:34:26,019 --> 01:34:27,893
Who the hell are you?

733
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:30,477
Stand back, I'm gonna blow the lock.

734
01:34:37,863 --> 01:34:39,986
Stand back.

735
01:34:49,499 --> 01:34:51,538
Get into their uniforms.

736
01:35:54,016 --> 01:35:56,341
Astronauts have two minutes.

737
01:35:56,477 --> 01:35:58,516
Repeat, two minutes.

738
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,396
Reserve astronaut to stand by.

739
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:14,116
- Lock on target.
- Lock on target vehicle.

740
01:36:14,243 --> 01:36:16,484
Check secondary guidance.

741
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:21,198
Launch time is now
T minus 90 minutes and counting.

742
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:23,823
Astronauts to launching pad.

743
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,118
Astronauts to launching pad.

744
01:36:27,213 --> 01:36:30,997
Repeat, astronauts
to launching pad immediately.

745
01:37:10,252 --> 01:37:13,087
Crews, stand by on gantry.

746
01:37:14,131 --> 01:37:16,040
Crews, stand by on gantry.

747
01:37:50,789 --> 01:37:54,703
- Stop that astronaut. Bring him to me.
- Stop that astronaut!

748
01:37:54,834 --> 01:37:58,333
- Summon the reserve astronaut!
- Reserve astronaut!

749
01:37:58,463 --> 01:38:02,246
Reserve astronaut
to launching pad, immediately.

750
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:14,058
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

751
01:38:14,185 --> 01:38:15,466
A new update

752
01:38:15,603 --> 01:38:20,099
with target vehicle
has been received from computers.

753
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:25,861
We now have T minus seven minutes
and counting.

754
01:38:25,988 --> 01:38:28,525
You made a mistake, my friend.

755
01:38:28,657 --> 01:38:31,823
No astronaut enters the capsule
with his air conditioner.

756
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:33,695
Remove his helmet!

757
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,331
James Bond.

758
01:38:42,586 --> 01:38:45,255
Allow me to introduce myself.

759
01:38:46,715 --> 01:38:49,669
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

760
01:38:50,844 --> 01:38:53,714
They told me
you were assassinated in Hong Kong.

761
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:56,470
Yes, this is my second life.

762
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:00,807
You only live twice, Mr Bond.

763
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:03,605
Target vehicle
passing over central Russia.

764
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,853
Approaching Mongolia.

765
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:08,734
Track is as predicted. All computers...

766
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:12,193
As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.

767
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:16,864
In a matter of hours, when America
and Russia have annihilated each other,

768
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:19,744
we shall see a new power
dominating the world.

769
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:24,117
- Target vehicle on scope.
- Brief check on target vehicle.

770
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:26,870
Remove his suit and search him.

771
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:30,121
Reserve astronaut ready on Bird 1.

772
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,258
Prepare for firing.

773
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:43,429
Clear the area.

774
01:39:44,476 --> 01:39:46,515
Clear the area.

775
01:39:48,813 --> 01:39:51,304
Emergency services to stand by.

776
01:39:52,316 --> 01:39:54,356
Area now clear.

777
01:39:57,946 --> 01:40:01,611
T minus one minute,
30 seconds and counting.

778
01:40:02,242 --> 01:40:05,029
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

779
01:40:05,161 --> 01:40:07,201
Bird 1 now in readiness.

780
01:40:07,955 --> 01:40:11,371
Astronauts ready on Bird.
All systems are go.

781
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,584
Close shutters.

782
01:40:15,712 --> 01:40:18,832
- Radar blackout commence.
- Radar blackout in operation.

783
01:40:22,302 --> 01:40:24,971
Effective range, kilometres 800.

784
01:40:25,096 --> 01:40:28,050
- Open crater.
- Opening crater.

785
01:40:30,643 --> 01:40:32,682
Crater opening.

786
01:40:32,811 --> 01:40:35,895
Bird 1 to liftoffposition.

787
01:40:53,956 --> 01:40:58,451
Gimbal the engines.
Pressurised tanks open.

788
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:01,585
Ventilator fans to full power.

789
01:41:01,713 --> 01:41:02,875
10 seconds.

790
01:41:03,005 --> 01:41:04,879
9, 8,

791
01:41:05,007 --> 01:41:06,715
7, 6,

792
01:41:06,842 --> 01:41:08,799
5, 4,

793
01:41:08,928 --> 01:41:10,885
3, 2,

794
01:41:11,013 --> 01:41:12,922
1, 0.

795
01:41:13,056 --> 01:41:15,381
Ignition.

796
01:41:41,123 --> 01:41:42,915
Close crater!

797
01:41:43,042 --> 01:41:45,081
Closing crater.

798
01:41:47,963 --> 01:41:50,454
Open shutters!

799
01:42:29,918 --> 01:42:32,206
Bird 1 to base. Separation complete.

800
01:42:32,337 --> 01:42:34,625
Confirm acquisition.

801
01:42:34,756 --> 01:42:36,997
Calling Bird 1.

802
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:40,584
You are 70 nautical miles downrange.
200 miles altitude.

803
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:43,839
Hans, our job will soon be done.

804
01:42:43,972 --> 01:42:48,468
Blow them up as soon as they have
captured the Americans. Here is the key

805
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:52,099
to operate the exploder button.

806
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:54,471
There are men in the crater!

807
01:42:56,108 --> 01:42:57,139
Crater guns, fire.

808
01:42:57,276 --> 01:42:59,315
Crater guns, open fire.

809
01:43:21,548 --> 01:43:23,790
The firing power inside my crater

810
01:43:23,925 --> 01:43:26,214
is enough to annihilate a small army.

811
01:43:27,053 --> 01:43:29,295
You can watch it all on TV.

812
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:32,514
It's the last programme
you're likely to see.

813
01:43:32,642 --> 01:43:36,141
If I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?

814
01:43:37,354 --> 01:43:39,477
Yes. Give him his cigarettes.

815
01:43:39,606 --> 01:43:43,189
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr Bond.

816
01:44:00,584 --> 01:44:03,121
Armed guards to control room.

817
01:44:18,058 --> 01:44:20,346
- Close the crater.
- Close crater!

818
01:44:20,477 --> 01:44:24,095
I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr Bond.

819
01:45:21,449 --> 01:45:23,192
Close the shutters.

820
01:45:31,708 --> 01:45:34,033
We are now impregnable.

821
01:45:34,169 --> 01:45:38,036
Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.

822
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:09,333
Impregnable?

823
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:12,714
- Come with me, Mr Bond.
- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.

824
01:47:12,842 --> 01:47:15,463
- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?

825
01:47:17,137 --> 01:47:19,213
Base calling Bird 1.

826
01:47:19,348 --> 01:47:22,633
You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.

827
01:47:22,768 --> 01:47:24,807
Seven minutes to interception.

828
01:47:24,936 --> 01:47:26,976
Roger, Base One.

829
01:47:27,689 --> 01:47:29,480
Houston, this is Hawaii.

830
01:47:29,607 --> 01:47:31,646
We have an unidentified object on scope.

831
01:47:31,776 --> 01:47:34,148
Order first alert. Arm all weapons.

832
01:47:34,278 --> 01:47:37,029
Interception will occur in six minutes.

833
01:47:43,995 --> 01:47:47,162
This is the price of failure, Mr Bond.

834
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,959
Come on.

835
01:48:05,306 --> 01:48:07,512
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

836
01:48:18,026 --> 01:48:22,189
There's an exploder button in the
control room. We've got to get up there.

837
01:48:22,322 --> 01:48:24,361
Impossible. Too well defended.

838
01:48:30,204 --> 01:48:32,243
Evacuate the control!

839
01:48:32,748 --> 01:48:34,207
Evacuate the control!

840
01:48:54,101 --> 01:48:58,394
Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.

841
01:49:10,115 --> 01:49:12,357
Give me cover till I get to the staircase.

842
01:50:56,879 --> 01:50:58,918
Bon appétit.

843
01:51:15,187 --> 01:51:18,022
Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.

844
01:51:18,691 --> 01:51:22,142
All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.

845
01:51:22,277 --> 01:51:25,064
I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.

846
01:51:55,432 --> 01:51:57,259
It's blown up! The enemy!

847
01:51:57,392 --> 01:51:59,800
I repeat, the enemy has blown up.

848
01:51:59,936 --> 01:52:02,427
All units will return to first alert.

849
01:52:02,564 --> 01:52:05,897
Codeword is not -
I say again, not - imminent.

850
01:52:09,236 --> 01:52:11,193
Tiger,

851
01:52:11,322 --> 01:52:12,602
we've done it.

852
01:52:32,174 --> 01:52:34,546
Down the tunnel!

853
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,290
Steady.

854
01:54:13,558 --> 01:54:16,227
Now... about that honeymoon.

855
01:54:16,352 --> 01:54:18,391
Why not?

856
01:54:18,521 --> 01:54:20,762
But they'll never let you stay.

857
01:54:21,982 --> 01:54:24,022
But they'll never find us.

858
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:54,209
- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.

859
01:54:54,345 --> 01:54:56,752
It'll be a pleasure, sir.
