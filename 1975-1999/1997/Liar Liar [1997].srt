1
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,176
W-O...

2
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,178
R...

3
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,180
K!

4
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,265
Work.

5
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:07,312
Today we're going to share
what our parents do for...

6
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:10,356
Work!

7
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,567
My mommy is a doctor.

8
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,028
My daddy is a truck driver.
- My mom's a teacher.

9
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:20,907
And your dad?
- Mmm. My dad-

10
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:24,661
He's... a liar.

11
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:29,582
A- A liar? Oh, I'm sure
you don't mean a liar.

12
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:33,461
Well, he wears a suit and goes
to court and talks to the judge.

13
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh! I see.

14
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,257
You mean he's a lawyer.

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,723
Hey, Fletcher.
How'd it go?

16
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,851
Just another victory for the
wrongly accused. - Yeah, right.

17
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:52,853
Mr. Reede, great job.
Do you want your coat back?

18
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,397
No, I'm sure you'll be
needing it again and again.

19
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:59,026
Do you have a moment? - I'm late.
It's my day to be with my son.

20
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:02,029
A couple of reporters want
to talk about your big win.

21
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,155
Yeah? How's my hair?

22
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,157
Fabulous.
You look great.

23
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:26,468
What time is it? - I am sure your
dad just got held up in court again.

24
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:36,977
Dad!
- Maximilian!

25
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,650
Hey, how ya doin', creep?

26
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,694
Good.

27
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:50,323
Me too, except my arm
has been botherin' me.

28
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:52,700
Oh, no, Dad!
- Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:55,661
It's becoming a claw!

30
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:02,292
Nothing can stop the claw!

31
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:09,507
Run, boy, run!
Save yourself!

32
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,093
Do the claw to Mom!
Do the claw to Mom!

33
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:15,763
Uh-oh. You found
the claw's only weakness.

34
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:18,807
Subzero temperatures!

35
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:22,519
So, did you have any trouble
finding the place?

36
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,147
Okay, I'm late. I'm sorry.
I ran out of gas.

37
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,526
The gauge is broken.
Rough neighborhood too.

38
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,695
Good thing I was wearin'
neutral gang colors.

39
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:35,406
I might have had to pull out
my nine and bust a cap.

40
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,700
<i><b>My mind and my money
and my money and my mind</b></i>

41
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:41,620
They would never hurt you,
Fletcher. You're their lawyer.

42
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:45,040
That was below the belt.
Keep the gloves up.

43
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:48,042
Mom, Dad's taking me
to see wrestling!

44
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:51,003
Oh, Fletcher!
- Oh, Audrey!

45
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:54,006
Why do you have to take him
to see that stuff? It's very violent.

46
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,677
The boy must grow
to be a warrior.

47
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,721
Who better to guide him
than Rick Rude...

48
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:04,224
and Randy Macho-man Savage
in the cage of death?

49
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,519
Oh, good!

50
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:12,315
Jerry, how's it goin'?
- Hey, gipper!

51
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,733
You look like you grow
by the minute!

52
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,653
Fletcher, pleasure to see you.
Hi, honey!

53
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:20,155
Hi.

54
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,992
Wow. That was a nice image.
Deleted.

55
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,912
I have some more boxes for you.
- Oh, you're an angel.

56
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:32,833
Boxes? - Remember, I told you a few
weeks ago, Jerry's moving to Boston.

57
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:37,421
Oh, right! The job, the thing.
What do you do again?

58
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:40,924
Hospital administrator.
- Right, right!

59
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:42,926
Well, the boxes
are in my car.

60
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,928
Oh, those can wait.

61
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,972
I made this young man
a promise, didn't I?

62
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:50,058
Got time to throw a few?
- Sure!

63
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,643
Come on, then!

64
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,146
I forgot the boyfriend was moving.
- Jerry!

65
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:58,357
His name is Jerry!
And yes, he's moving.

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,860
I'm sorry. I hated him less
than your other boyfriends.

67
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,738
It wasn't serious, was it?
- Semiserious, yes.

68
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:08,575
You guys aren't-
You know-

69
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:14,080
I have been
dating him for seven months.

70
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,874
What do you think?
- Really? Ooh!

71
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,960
I was hoping after being married
to me you'd have no strength left.

72
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:24,047
Remember, when we were married, I wasn't
having sex nearly as often as you were.

73
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,635
Ouch! And the ref
takes a point away.

74
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:33,055
Out!
- Max is gonna miss him.

75
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,099
I'll be here.

76
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:39,103
Ready? Yeah! Play ball.

77
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:42,314
Max, come on. We've gotta go.

78
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:46,359
Dad, are we really going to wrestling?
- Absolutely, Max Factor.

79
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,736
We just have to stop by
the office for one minute.

80
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,822
Excuse me, sir. Any spare change?

81
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,907
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all out.

82
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,034
I can't do it.

83
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:58,996
Fred, it's your duty to present
the strongest case possible.

84
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,998
The strongest case possible
consistent with the truth.

85
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,084
Will you let the judge
decide what's true?

86
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,921
That's what he gets paid for.
You get paid to win.

87
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:10,298
If you insist
that I take it to trial,

88
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:14,093
I will represent Mrs. Cole
aggressively and ethically.

89
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,345
But Miranda, I won't lie.

90
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,475
Then we'll just have
to find someone who will.

91
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,937
Twenty-first floor.
Men's wear.

92
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,610
Hi, Mr. Reede!
- Whoa!

93
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:36,780
Hey. Did you do something
to your hair?

94
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,657
It's a bit extreme,
isn't it?

95
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:42,452
No! That's the thing nowadays, right?

96
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:45,955
He said it would accent my facial
features. - That's what it does!

97
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,791
It completely accents
your facial features.

98
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:53,254
We're just gonna go
to my office-

99
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,716
Hey, Fletcher.
- Hey, Pete.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,219
You losin' a little weight?
- I don't know. Maybe.

101
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:02,804
Looks and personality.
A double-threat guy.

102
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,307
Hey, Mr. Reede.
- Hey... man.

103
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:07,433
It's, uh, Randy.
- Yeah, I know.

104
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,561
Takin' lunch orders.
Anything?

105
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,688
No, thanks.

106
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:16,191
I had so much for breakfast,
I'm ready to pop.

107
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:20,529
I mean, I'm full.
- Okay. Great.

108
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:27,452
Max!
- Hi, Greta.

109
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:32,248
Hey, what's new? - It's my birthday
tomorrow, and we're having a party.

110
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,668
Wow! I am sure your daddy
has got you something wonderful.

111
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:41,340
Yeah?
- Yeah, you bet! Listen, kiddo.

112
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:45,760
Why don't you play in my office
for a minute. Sue somebody for
everything they've got.

113
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:50,098
Maybe you can send a fax
to one of your girlfriends. Hey, sorry.

114
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:54,060
Damn it!
I completely forgot.

115
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,103
Oh, what a surprise.

116
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:58,856
You are a saint.
I should buy you a gift.

117
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:02,943
You did. - I always do
the classy thing. Any calls?

118
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,029
The Drawlings' clerk needs your filing.
- Tell him it's in the mail.

119
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:11,033
Right. You'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley
phoned to confirm your meeting tomorrow.

120
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:14,161
Strep throat. Some kind of virus.
What's goin' around?

121
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,330
Asian flu?
- Good one.

122
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,041
And your mother called.
- I'm on vacation.

123
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,543
It's your fifth week.
- Snowed in. Phones are down.

124
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,045
Break mother's heart.
Done. That's it.

125
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,090
Except Miranda's looking for you.

126
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,719
How much ass do I have to kiss
to make partner?

127
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,390
Tell her I broke my leg and I had to be
shot. - Tell her yourself.

128
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,560
And then send out a notice
of judgement on my win today!

129
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:45,899
I'll get right on it.
- Miranda! Hey, I didn't see you.

130
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,401
You look beautiful today.

131
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,028
Here! I bought you a gift.

132
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,949
Oh, thanks. I heard about
your victory. Congratulations.

133
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:58,577
You're making quite an impression
on the partnership committee.

134
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:03,206
That's right!
You folks are meetin' soon.

135
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:05,583
I've been so busy,
I haven't even thought about it.

136
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:11,672
Anyway. I have a client
in my office.

137
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:16,760
Better not keep him waiting.
- Actually, something rather
important's just come up.

138
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:20,013
Um, you're not busy tonight, are you?

139
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,314
We're not going, are we?

140
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:47,163
Audrey. You know how there are
moments you know are critical?

141
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:50,291
Mm-hmm.
- And choices that have to be made...

142
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:53,794
upon which all one's
future happiness will depend?

143
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,838
This is one of those moments.

144
00:09:57,673 --> 00:10:01,259
What are you
trying to say?

145
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,762
Will you marry me?

146
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:11,435
You're moving. - I know, but
l want you and Max to come with me.

147
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,646
Audrey, I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

148
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:16,649
You know I'm not prone to wild
flights of romantic fancy.

149
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:21,111
But the thought of you and I
together just makes sense.

150
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,030
Now I'm ready. I think
you're ready. I love Max.

151
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,408
You love Max.
It's right. It fits.

152
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:30,078
So what do you say?

153
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:50,847
Hey, creepy.
Happy birthday.

154
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,848
How old are you now,
22 or 23?

155
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:56,393
I'm five, Dad.
- Okay.

156
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:59,062
Return the beer keg.

157
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:02,274
Cancel the dancing girls.

158
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:05,318
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

159
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,946
I feel completely unprepared
for this.

160
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,865
You see, I bought you a present,
but last night...

161
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:14,201
I accidentally swallowed it.

162
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,996
Dad, it's in your belly!
- Scalpel.

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,040
I hope it's not
partially digested!

164
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:22,584
Ooh! Look out!

165
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,337
Cool! What is it?
- Cool!

166
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:29,090
It's- lt's a surprise.

167
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,092
All right, it's a pony.
Just open it!

168
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:35,888
I'm gonna help,
'cause I can't stand it!

169
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,767
Baseball stuff!
- Baseball stuff!

170
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,562
Cool! Can we play?

171
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:47,357
I'll be Nomo. You can be
Jose Canseco. Can we play?

172
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:49,901
Absolutely.
- Yeah!

173
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,863
Right after your party
tonight, we'll do it.

174
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,574
You and me.

175
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:59,952
I just have to really
concentrate on this right now.

176
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,433
Hi!

177
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:28,686
Hey! Happy birthday.

178
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,440
Thanks, Mom.
- Happy birthday, Max!

179
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:37,236
One, two, three, four, five.
And one for good luck!

180
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:39,321
He struck the child.
Did you see that?

181
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:42,949
Look at what Dad got me!
- Whoa! Great!

182
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:45,994
Hey, I have my glove
in the car.

183
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,455
Maybe we can stop at the park
on the way home and play catch.

184
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:53,042
Then tonight we can rub oil in it
and wrap a big rubber band around it.

185
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,878
It'll be great.
Hey, great gift, Dad!

186
00:12:55,961 --> 00:13:00,215
Thanks, son. I'm so glad my gift
could bring those two together.

187
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,301
My plan to phase myself out
is almost complete.

188
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:06,805
Something's come up,
and we need to talk.

189
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:09,140
Come on, Mom.
I want to go play!

190
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,351
And actually it's kind of important,
so maybe we could talk tonight?

191
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,520
Tonight?
- Yes.

192
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:17,648
Max's birthday party.
- Oh! Yeah.

193
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,192
Sure. Of course.
We'll talk then. Great!

194
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,613
Maximus! I'm outta here.
- Bye, Dad.

195
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,074
Jerry, enjoy my wife.

196
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,549
Well, this is good.

197
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,010
This is really smart.

198
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:51,012
Thank you.
- Only-

199
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:55,599
Well, it's not true.
Does that present a problem?

200
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,186
Mrs. Cole,
the only problem here...

201
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,023
is that after you've provided years
of faithful service and loving support,

202
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,275
of raising his children-
they are his?

203
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:09,570
Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah.
One for sure.

204
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:13,532
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you...

205
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:17,953
a fair share of the assets based
on one act of indiscretion. - Seven.

206
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:22,165
Pardon me?
- Seven single acts of indiscretion.

207
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,293
Seven acts of indiscretion,

208
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:27,670
only one of which he has
any evidence of...

209
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:31,299
and all of which he himself
is responsible for.

210
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:34,635
He is?
- Mrs. Cole.

211
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:38,555
You're the victim here.
The wife of a cold, distant workaholic.

212
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:41,266
Starved for affection, driven
into the arms of another man!

213
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,310
Seven.
- Yeah, whatever!

214
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,562
You're not trying to deny him
what is rightfully his.

215
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:49,107
All you're insisting on is what
is rightfully yours. - Yeah.

216
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,193
And maybe a...
fraction more.

217
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,737
I think you're
bending over backwards.

218
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,700
Yeah. I did offer to
give him joint custody of the kids.

219
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:02,911
He is, after all,
a wonderful father.

220
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,164
And how does he repay you?

221
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,583
By dragging you through
a painful litigation process!

222
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,253
No, no, no, no!
This can't happen!

223
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:16,048
With all due respect, this isn't
about you and Mr. Cole anymore.

224
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,092
This is about all women.

225
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,595
Where would Tina Turner be right
now if she'd rolled over and said,

226
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:24,931
<i><b>Hit me again, lke,
and put some stank on it?</b></i>

227
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:27,142
Rollin' on the river,
that's where she'd be.

228
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:31,270
But she's beyond Thunderdome,
because she decided to send a message.

229
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:36,233
Wake up, sisters!
There's no-o-o-o-o-o...

230
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:39,945
such thing as a weaker sex!

231
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:43,532
You know what?

232
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,286
You're right, Mr. Reede. I am
tired of getting kicked around!

233
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,955
Good for you!

234
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:55,167
Thank you.
I am so grateful...

235
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:58,170
to have an attorney
I can trust.

236
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,845
Oh, you are good.

237
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:11,682
You are very, very good.

238
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:15,728
The Cole case is worth
a truckload of money to this firm.

239
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:19,064
If you win, I guarantee
you'll make partner.

240
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:25,987
In fact, how would you
like to make...

241
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:28,531
a partner right now, hmm?

242
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:32,159
Oh, I don't know.
I should-

243
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,335
<i><b>Happy, happy, happy
happy, happy, happy</b></i>

244
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:46,047
<i><b>Happy
I'm so happy today</b></i>

245
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,509
<i><b>I live in the U. S. A.
- So honey?</b></i>

246
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,011
Have you, uh,
thought about-

247
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:56,849
You know, what we talked about?
- Uh, yeah. I can't go.

248
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,851
What? Wh-Why not?

249
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,437
Because of Max.
- But he'll love it there.

250
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,564
I'm gonna take him
to Fenway Park.

251
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,608
There's hiking
and camping-

252
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:10,528
Well, really,
it's... Fletcher.

253
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,364
Fletcher?
Come on, honey.

254
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,699
He wouldn't even come over
unless you reminded him.

255
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,368
I know, but when he does
come over, Max is so happy.

256
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:20,912
It's like they have their
own little world together.

257
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:24,874
The gipper and I have that too!
- I know, but it's different.

258
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,585
How?
- Well-

259
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,588
He does the claw.

260
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:33,591
The what?
- The claw.

261
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:36,719
You know, it's like this-

262
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,012
I don't-

263
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:43,892
Run for you life.
It's the claw! The claw!

264
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,065
I can't really do it that good.
That's not the point.

265
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:53,401
The point is...

266
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,945
if they're 3, 000 miles apart,
they're never gonna see each other.

267
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:57,946
Fletcher's never gonna
come to Boston.

268
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,575
Hello.

269
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:04,661
Audrey?
- Fletcher! Where are you?

270
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,080
We're waiting. Max won't cut the cake
until you get here.

271
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,083
Um- Oh, man!

272
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,668
Actually, something
has come up. I've-

273
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:14,920
I've got this problem
on a new case.

274
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,922
What happened?
- Nothing!

275
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:19,258
I stubbed my toe
on the desk!

276
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,178
I'm really sorry,
but I just can't make it.

277
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:26,598
The boss is, uh,
really ridin' me.

278
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:29,309
Fletcher, it's his birthday!

279
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,310
I know, l know.

280
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:34,980
I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll
pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?

281
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,191
You're gonna pick him up?
- Yes!

282
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:40,152
All right, hold on a minute.
You can say happy birthday.

283
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:42,612
No! Gotta go! Good-bye.

284
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,157
Hello.

285
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:50,244
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

286
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:55,457
<i><b>Happy birthday, dear Max</b></i>

287
00:18:55,499 --> 00:19:00,837
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

288
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,633
Okay, birthday boy.
Make a wish.

289
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:11,556
Come on, Max.
It can be anything you want.

290
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,724
Anything in the whole world.

291
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:31,073
Max.

292
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:34,410
Your father is sorry.
He had to work.

293
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:37,037
He said he was gonna
be here. He promised.

294
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:41,458
I know, but he promises that
he is gonna see you tomorrow.

295
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,545
Okay? He's gonna pick you up
from school. All right?

296
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:52,093
So come on.
Make a wish.

297
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:06,689
<i><b>I wish that for only one day...</b></i>

298
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:10,735
<i><b>Dad couldn't tell a lie.</b></i>

299
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:41,138
Mmm. That was incredible.

300
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,516
Was it good for you?

301
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,726
I've had better.

302
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,068
<i><b>l've had better?</b></i>

303
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:02,074
<i><b>l've had better?</b></i>

304
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,496
<i><b>l've had better.</b></i>

305
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,478
Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:37,773
New in the building?
- Yeah, I just moved in Monday.

307
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:42,110
Oh! You like it so far?
- Everybody's been real nice.

308
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:44,779
Well, that's because
you have big jugs.

309
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:47,448
I mean, your boobs
are huge.

310
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:51,160
I mean, l wanna
squeeze 'em.

311
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:55,080
Mama.

312
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:08,009
Any change, mister?
- Absolutely.

313
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,428
Could you spare some?
- Yes, I could.

314
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,055
Will ya? How come?
- Mm-mm.

315
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:15,641
Because I believe
you will buy booze with it!

316
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:20,562
I just wanna get to the office
without being confronted by
the decay of Western society!

317
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:22,898
Plus, I'm cheap!

318
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:25,942
Jerk off!

319
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:58,889
You look like you're
having a rough morning.

320
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:02,767
Ding, ding, ding!
What do we have for her, Johnny?

321
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:06,521
Fletcher.
- Dana.

322
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:09,899
All right, Samantha. How much
will it take to put an end to all this?

323
00:23:09,982 --> 00:23:14,070
Fifty percent of your estate.
- Fifty percent?

324
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:17,531
With a pre-nup and proof of adultery?
What's your case?

325
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,908
Our case is simply this.

326
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:04,115
Very funny, Fletcher!

327
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:07,994
You wanna play hardball?
I'm game.

328
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:10,830
<i><b>You wanna play hardball? I'm game.</b></i>

329
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:13,582
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

330
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:17,961
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens.

331
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:20,047
Honorable?

332
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:26,719
Good morning.
Call case number BD-09395.

333
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:29,639
Samantha Cole vs. Richard Cole.

334
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:32,642
How are we doing this morning,
Counsel? - Fine. Thank you.

335
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:37,938
And you, Mr. Reede? - I'm a little upset
about a bad sexual episode last night.

336
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:45,111
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.

337
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:49,657
In the meantime, what do you say
we get down to business?

338
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:54,453
First, Mr. Reede, I see-
- I would like a continuance!

339
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:58,707
This case has been delayed
several times, Mr. Reede.

340
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:04,129
I realize that, Your Honor, but l would
really, really like a continuance.

341
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,840
I'll have to hear
good cause, Counsel.

342
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,841
What's the problem?

343
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,311
I can't lie!

344
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:26,149
Commendable, Mr. Reede, but I'm waiting
to hear good cause. Do you have one or not?

345
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,360
Not.
- Motion for continuance denied.

346
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,321
Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?

347
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:37,326
I don't think so, Your Honor.
My client has already offered
Mrs Cole 2.4 million dollars.

348
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:42,205
But Mr. Reede has made it clear
he has no desire... - Settle!

349
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,667
Settle, settle, settle, settle!
- I don't want to settle.

350
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,004
Mr. Reede. You convinced me
yesterday, I'm the victim!

351
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:54,175
I'm starved for affection.
I'm driven into the arms of another man.

352
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,302
Seven!
- Yeah, whatever.

353
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:59,429
With the story you came up with,
I don't think we can lose.

354
00:25:59,513 --> 00:26:03,850
I want to proceed.
- Mrs. Cole, you don't understand.

355
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:06,352
Mr. Reede.
Do we have a settlement?

356
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,396
No!

357
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:15,486
No, Your Honor.
- There's no settlement.

358
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:18,530
Trial to commence 1:30 sharp.

359
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,383
It was me!

360
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:45,388
Hi, Mr. Reede!
Like the new dress?

361
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,184
Whatever takes the focus
off your head.

362
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:55,272
What's up, Fletcher? - Your
cholesterol, fatty! Dead man walkin'.

363
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:57,566
Hey, Fletcher. - Hey! You're
not important enough to remember.

364
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,569
What's it gonna be, Mr. Reede?
- A pockmark, eventually!

365
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:04,072
Don't ask!
For God's sakes, don't ask.

366
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:06,908
All right.
You can beat this.

367
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:09,869
It's all a matter
of willpower!

368
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,414
A test. Something small.

369
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:23,882
Red. Red. All right?
Now focus.

370
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:27,468
The color of this pen
is r-r-r-

371
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,765
The color of this pen...

372
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:35,768
is re-e-e-e-e-

373
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:37,895
Re-e-e-e-

374
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:45,276
The color of the pen
that I hold in my hand...

375
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:48,279
is r-r-r-r-

376
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,281
r-r-royal blue!

377
00:27:53,784 --> 00:27:56,787
One lie, and I can't say it!

378
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:59,873
I'll write it.

379
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:30,526
Write it! Write it,
or I'll break it off!

380
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:39,993
Agh! No!
Come on! Stop it.

381
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,089
Boss? What happened?

382
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:01,054
The pen is blue.
The pen is blue!

383
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,808
The goddamn pen is blue!

384
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,270
Mr. Reede, are you all right?

385
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:13,065
I gotta go home.
- Home? Was the case settled?

386
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,859
No! I have to be
in court at 1:30!

387
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:20,864
Then how are you going to go home?
- I don't know. I don't know.

388
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:24,951
Okay. Uh, Mr. Reede,
Reuben and Dunn called.

389
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,620
They need to know where the
Darby settlement offer stands.

390
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:31,999
I just proposed a settlement
to dick with them!

391
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:35,461
Dick with them.
Got it.

392
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:39,715
And your mother called. Are you
still on vacation? - No.

393
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:42,050
Then you're here?
- Yes.

394
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:44,552
Thank you for clearing
that up, sir.

395
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:47,931
And your ex-wife called.
She wants to know when you're
coming to pick up your son.

396
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:52,310
Oh, I'm such a shit!

397
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:58,649
Hello.
- Audrey?

398
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:01,568
Fletcher, hi. Are you still picking
Max up from school today?

399
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,695
Here's the thing.
I really can't!

400
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:07,657
I had a case l was certain would settle,
and it didn't, and I have to go to court.

401
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,244
Right. - It's true! I really
want to see Max today!

402
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,245
I really do.

403
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:16,123
Uh-huh, but things just keep coming up
at the last minute.

404
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:19,251
Yes, but this time it's different.
- I see. How is that?

405
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:23,255
Now I'm telling the truth.
- And last night you weren't.
Well, what were you doing?

406
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,299
Having sex!

407
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:29,469
Well, I hope that it was
with someone very special.

408
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:32,722
No! That's the thing. I don't even
like her, but she's a partner.

409
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:37,476
I thought l could help my career
by makin' her squeal.

410
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:44,274
What's wrong with me?

411
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:46,651
I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm reaping what I sow. I'm-

412
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,623
ls Dad still picking me up?
- No, Max, he's not.

413
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,835
I'm sorry, but l'm gonna
pick you up, okay?

414
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,837
I'll work it out.

415
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,881
I guess my wish
didn't come true.

416
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:14,844
What wish? - I wished that for just
one day Dad couldn't tell a lie.

417
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:23,018
Max?

418
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:29,607
I have something important
to talk to you about, okay?

419
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:31,943
Okay.
- Okay.

420
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:43,703
Hello? - Audrey! Let me explain.
Something has happened to me.

421
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:47,707
Well, something else is about to happen
to you. Max and I are moving to Boston.

422
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,001
What?
- Jerry has asked me to marry him,

423
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,712
and Max and I are going
this weekend to look at houses.

424
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,672
I thought it was semiserious!

425
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,508
It's just been given
a violent shove into serious.

426
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:00,093
You can't move to Boston;
I'll never see Max!

427
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:03,597
You'll have the same relationship
you have with him now, won't you?

428
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,432
Where are you?
- I'm going home.

429
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:08,768
When you get there, just stay there.
I'm comin' over. We have to talk.

430
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:13,105
Fletcher!
- I'll be right there.

431
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:16,483
Hey, Mr. Reede-

432
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:28,077
Fletcher.
- Holy hell!

433
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:35,376
You can run,
but you can't hide.

434
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:42,382
What's your problem, schmuck?

435
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:45,802
I'm an inconsiderate prick!

436
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:10,783
Oh, shit!

437
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,581
Shit!

438
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,508
You know why I pulled you over? - Depends
on how long you were following me!

439
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,012
Why don't we take it from the top?
- Here goes.

440
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,097
I sped, l followed too closely,
I ran a stop sign,

441
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,184
I almost hit a Chevy, l sped
some more, I failed to yield,

442
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:43,271
I changed lanes without
signaling while speeding!

443
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,774
Is that all?
- No.

444
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,737
I have unpaid parking tickets.

445
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,783
Be gentle.

446
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:01,496
Audrey! Wait!

447
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:08,127
Wait, Audrey. Ooh!
Hold on. Wait!

448
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:12,506
Wait. I just had an insight
into myself. I'm crazy.

449
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,135
<i><b>You call and say,
Wait, I'll be right over,</b></i>

450
00:34:16,218 --> 00:34:18,804
and here's the crazy part-
I actually wait.

451
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:22,891
I can explain this.
- I have missed a department meeting.

452
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:24,934
Did you come in a cab?
- Yes!

453
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:28,104
Where's your car?

454
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:31,649
Thank you! I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

455
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:37,071
I can. $1,654.11.
- How do you sleep at night?

456
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:43,743
I'm takin' this.

457
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,879
You scratched my car!

458
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:59,341
Where?
- Right there!

459
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:03,887
Oh, there.
That was already there.

460
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,015
Why, you!

461
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:09,017
You liar!

462
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:12,395
-You know what I'm gonna
do about this? -What?

463
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:16,231
Nothing! Because if I take you to court,
it'll drain eight hours out of my life,

464
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:19,943
and you won't show up, and if I got
the judgement, you'd just stiff me anyway!

465
00:35:20,027 --> 00:35:24,197
So I'm gonna piss and moan
like an impotent jerk...

466
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,700
and then bend over and
take it up the tailpipe!

467
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:30,870
You been here before,
haven't ya?

468
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,664
Well, I can't remember
when I've had more fun,

469
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:35,874
but if you'll excuse me,
I have a class.

470
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,876
Are you marrying this guy
because you're mad at me?

471
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,379
No, I divorced you
because I was mad at you.

472
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,715
Wait. I want to talk about this!
- What do you want to say?

473
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:46,676
Is this guy right for you?
He is so... not me!

474
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:51,806
That's one of his best qualities.
- But he's kind of a magoo.

475
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:56,435
I'm sorry. - You're wrong.
Sometimes maybe he is a little-

476
00:35:56,518 --> 00:36:00,063
Magoo!
- Yes. But since we've been going out-

477
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:03,149
My God, I'm not having this conversation
with you. - Audrey, you can't go.

478
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:05,652
This is not fair.
- Fair?

479
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:10,573
Okay, let's define fair. Last night
a five-year-old boy was crushed...

480
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:14,285
because his father lied to him
about coming to his birthday party.

481
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:16,287
Fair?
- Last night-

482
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,289
Was none of my business. None
of my business. - Thank you.

483
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:22,793
Two years ago, it was my business.
But I don't have to care anymore.

484
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,588
That's the magic of divorce.
But it matters to Max!

485
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:29,882
Everything you do matters,
and everything you don't do.

486
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:31,884
All right.
Now let me tell you something.

487
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,886
I'm a bad father!

488
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:38,974
I mean-

489
00:36:44,354 --> 00:36:46,940
I'm a bad father.

490
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:52,820
You're not a bad father...
when you show up.

491
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:55,656
What if I come right after court
and play ball?

492
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:58,951
Then you and I can talk before
you make any rash decisions!

493
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:01,286
No, we are leaving tonight.

494
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:04,080
Please, Audrey.
Give me one more chance.

495
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,541
I'm throwin' myself
on the mercy of the court.

496
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:11,796
I lost you, but please
don't make me lose Max too.

497
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,010
Give me a chance to be
the father I started out to be.

498
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,143
You're really coming?
- This is ironclad.

499
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:30,354
This is the mother of all promises.
What time?

500
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:32,356
Okay, 6:00.

501
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,484
Ten to six.
- All right.

502
00:37:35,526 --> 00:37:38,987
All right. But if I tell
Max that you're coming,

503
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:42,324
and you don't show up and I have
to see that look on his face-

504
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:44,784
that heartbreaking look-

505
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:46,786
we're going to Boston.

506
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:50,373
If I don't show up,
I'll pack you myself.

507
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:53,709
I will lovingly wrap your
nicknacks with bubble paper.

508
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,711
I hope so.

509
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:00,799
Do you know what your son was doing
at 8:15 last night?

510
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:04,427
He was making a birthday wish
that for just one day...

511
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:07,472
his father couldn't tell a lie.

512
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:15,813
Oh, my God!
That's it!

513
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,482
<i><b>l do not like them, Sam I Am.</b></i>

514
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:21,234
<i><b>l do not like green eggs and ham.</b></i>

515
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:23,945
<i><b>Would you like them here or there?</b></i>

516
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:26,823
<i><b>I would not like them-
- Excuse me.</b></i>

517
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:31,285
Hi. I'm Max's bad father-
Er, I'm his father.

518
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:35,706
Dad! - Could I borrow him
for just one second?

519
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:40,377
Monster Max!
- You came to play catch?

520
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,171
I'd like to, but I can't.
I gotta talk to you.

521
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:47,550
Your mommy told me about that wish
you made last night. It came true, Max.

522
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,636
Really? You mean you have to tell
the truth? - Yes.

523
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,888
No matter what?
- No matter what!

524
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,183
Is wrestling real? - In the Olympics,
yes. On channel 23, no.

525
00:38:56,225 --> 00:39:00,270
Will sitting too close to the TV set make
me go blind? - Not in a million years.

526
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:03,398
If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

527
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:06,484
Uh-uh. In fact some people
make a good living that way.

528
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:12,448
Now listen, Max.
You've gotta do something for me.

529
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:15,159
I need you to take back that wish.

530
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:17,786
So you can lie?
- Yes.

531
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,498
But not to you.
You see, Max,

532
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:25,835
sometimes grownups need to lie.

533
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:30,298
It's hard to explain,
but if-

534
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:33,551
Look, here's a good example.
When your mommy was pregnant with you,

535
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:36,428
she gained 40 pounds;
there was nothing she wouldn't eat.

536
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:39,014
And Daddy was scared.
But when she'd ask me, "How do I look?"

537
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:43,518
l'd say, "Honey, you look great.
You're glowing. "

538
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:46,354
lf I had told Mommy she looked like
a cow, it would have hurt her feelings.

539
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:50,149
Understand? - My teacher tells me
real beauty's on the inside.

540
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:53,611
That's just something
ugly people say.

541
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:57,531
Max, no one can survive in the adult
world if they have to stick to the truth.

542
00:39:57,614 --> 00:40:01,576
I could lose my case, l could lose
my promotion, I could even lose my job.

543
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:03,578
Now, I need your help, Max.

544
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,997
Okay.

545
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:10,293
Okay. Do whatever
you did last night,

546
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:14,672
only this time,
make it an "unwish."

547
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,973
I did it.

548
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,308
Excellent!

549
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,977
Now, I just need
a little test.

550
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,248
-Did it work?
-Not like l'd hoped. Did you unwish it?

551
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:55,459
Only-
- What? Only what?

552
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:58,962
Yesterday, when I wished it,
I really meant it.

553
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:02,549
This time when I unwished it,
I only did it 'cause you told me to.

554
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,760
All right.
Do it again.

555
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:07,762
And this time, mean it.

556
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:10,306
But I can't!
- Why not?

557
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:13,684
'Cause I don't want you to lie.
- I explained this.

558
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:17,146
I have to lie.
Everybody lies.

559
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:20,607
Mommy lies.
Even the wonderful Jerry lies.

560
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:23,693
But you're the only one
that makes me feel bad.

561
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:27,572
Max, recess is over.

562
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,866
Come on in!

563
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,704
Mom says we're moving to Boston.

564
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:39,166
That isn't for sure yet.

565
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,918
She promised we'd talk
about it tonight.

566
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,921
I am comin'!

567
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,257
You believe me,
don't you, Max?

568
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:51,219
I'll see you later, buddy.

569
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,731
Fletcher. How's it hangin'? - Short,
shriveled and always to the left.

570
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,405
Boss, it's Skull.
He knocked over another A.T.M.

571
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,116
This time at knife-point.
He needs your legal advice.

572
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:23,957
Stop breakin' the law, asshole!

573
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,799
Boss, are you all right?

574
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:36,302
My son hates me.

575
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:42,307
Max loves you.
I've seen you together. You're his hero.

576
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,727
Oh, yeah?

577
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:49,272
Last night at his birthday
party, he made a wish...

578
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:52,650
that I wouldn't be able
to lie for one whole day.

579
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:55,236
Kids.
- It came true.

580
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:58,947
What?
- Max's wish!

581
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:01,450
It came true.

582
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:10,291
Boss, maybe you should
just take a few days off.

583
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:14,712
Greta! Didn't it seem weird to you that
I kept tellin' the truth all morning?

584
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:16,714
Well, yeah. But-

585
00:43:18,715 --> 00:43:22,302
What are you saying?
That you are incapable of lying?

586
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:25,513
That's right!
I am incapable of lying!

587
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:29,976
Just for today?
- Apparently. 'Til 8:15 tonight.

588
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:32,103
It's one of those
24-hour curses.

589
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:34,105
Those are goin' around.

590
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:36,523
You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course not.

591
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:40,235
How ironic!

592
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,281
Okay. Ask me something
you think I would normally lie about.

593
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:48,159
All right. Remember a couple
of months ago when I wanted a raise?

594
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:51,412
I don't want to do this. - And
the company wouldn't give me one...

595
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:54,832
and I asked if you would give it
to me out of your own pocket...

596
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:59,127
And you said the company would not allow
it, because it would create jealousy...

597
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,338
among the other secretaries.

598
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,342
Was that true, or did you just
not want to pony up the dough?

599
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:10,847
Greta, please!

600
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,351
Judge Stevens, hi! Fletcher Reede. I'm
scheduled in your court in half an hour.

601
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:19,188
Judge Stevens, I badly, badly
need a continuance. Ill?

602
00:44:19,229 --> 00:44:23,191
Am I ill? That is
the perfect question for you to ask.

603
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:26,236
Please lie for me!
- I remember when you bought me this...

604
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,447
antique frame from Tiffany's-
Tiffany's?

605
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,034
Garage sale. Six-fifty,
marked down from ten.

606
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:37,955
I'll give you the raise!

607
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,999
Here's your raise.

608
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:46,045
Hi, Judge Stevens!
I know l haven't given you an answer.

609
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:49,132
But illness could mean so many things.

610
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:51,551
Can you hold?
Hello? Mom!

611
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:55,262
Hi! I wasn't really
on vacation.

612
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:58,640
Because I didn't want
to talk to you!

613
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:02,561
Because you insist on talking about Dad's
bowel movements- size, color, frequency!

614
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:05,397
I'll call you later!
Hello?

615
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,191
Oh, damn it!
I cut him off.

616
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:11,068
I cut off the judge!

617
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:18,450
Greta! Don't leave!

618
00:45:18,492 --> 00:45:21,411
I'm on my knees
in a 900$ dollars suit!

619
00:45:23,163 --> 00:45:28,126
Mr. Reede. Several years ago,
a friend had a burglar on her roof.

620
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:33,089
He fell through the skylight, landed on
a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

621
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,592
The burglar sued my friend.
He sued my friend!

622
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:38,886
Because of guys like you, he won!

623
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:43,390
My friend had to pay the burglar $6,000.
Is that justice?

624
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:46,810
No. I'd have got him ten.

625
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:50,605
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.
- No, wait!

626
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:52,648
I didn't understand!
Ask me again!

627
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:56,110
Have a nice day in court.
- Greta!

628
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:59,947
Hi.
- God in heaven!

629
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,407
It's nice to see you too,
Fletcher. Are you busy?

630
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:06,286
Extremely.
- Good. Would you follow me, please?

631
00:46:10,123 --> 00:46:13,959
Did you know that the partnership
committee is headed by Mr. Allan himself?

632
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:17,296
You used to work
directly for Mr. Allan.

633
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:20,882
Yeah.
- Tell me. What do you think of him?

634
00:46:20,966 --> 00:46:24,969
He's a pedantic,
pontificating, pretentious bastard!

635
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:29,849
A belligerent old fart! A steaming pile
of cow dung! Figuratively speaking.

636
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:33,019
Really? How delightful.
This way.

637
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:40,651
Pardon me for interrupting.
Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reede?

638
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:43,820
Oh, yes! Nice to
see you again, Fletcher.

639
00:46:43,862 --> 00:46:46,906
I'll be observing you
in court this afternoon.

640
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,867
I've been hearing
some good things about you.

641
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:54,872
Well, Fletcher has just been telling me
how much he thinks of you.

642
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:59,334
Why don't you tell Mr. Allan?
Well, what do you think of him?

643
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:10,344
He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard.

644
00:47:10,386 --> 00:47:15,599
A belligerent old fart.
A worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.

645
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:18,977
Figuratively speaking.

646
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:42,124
That's the funniest damn thing
I've ever heard!

647
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:45,043
You're a real card, Reede!

648
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:47,503
I love a good roast!

649
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,007
Do Simmons!

650
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:53,217
Simmons is old!

651
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:57,971
He should have been out years ago, but
he can't stay home 'cause he hates his wife!

652
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:02,309
You've met her
at the Christmas parties.

653
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:05,729
She's the one that gets plastered
and calls him a retard.

654
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,982
And you, Tom. You're the biggest
brownnose I've ever seen!

655
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:14,904
You've got your head so far up
Mr. Allan's ass, I can't tell
where you end and he begins!

656
00:48:14,945 --> 00:48:17,156
Priceless!

657
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:22,119
You have bad breath
caused by gingivitis.

658
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:26,789
You couldn't get a porn star
off. Your hairpiece looks like
something that was killed.

659
00:48:26,873 --> 00:48:31,627
I don't know whether to comb it
or scrape it off and bury it in lime!

660
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:36,131
Loser! Idiot!
Wimp! Degenerate!

661
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:39,092
Slut!

662
00:48:40,761 --> 00:48:45,181
I like your style, Reede!
That's what this stuffy company needs!

663
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:49,644
A little irreverence!
- Good! I'll see you later, dick-head!

664
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:53,272
Dick-head!
Priceless!

665
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:13,124
Keep your eye on that boy.

666
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:15,793
Dick-head!

667
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:38,480
Third District Court is now in session.

668
00:49:38,564 --> 00:49:42,984
The honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens presiding.

669
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:47,655
Afternoon, Counselors.
Are we ready to begin?

670
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:50,408
No, sir!
We are not ready to begin...

671
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:52,785
because my client
has not arrived!

672
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:54,787
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

673
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,915
<i><b>Here she comes
to wreck the day</b></i>

674
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,834
Mr. Reede!
- Sorry, Your Honor.

675
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,044
Go, go, go. Lupe,
you keep those kids quiet.

676
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,213
I'm not even close to kidding.
- Sí, seòora.

677
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:08,716
Sorry.
Billy threw up in the car.

678
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:11,302
You brought your kids
to your divorce?

679
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:13,554
Sympathy.
- Well, it's working.

680
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,723
I feel sorry for them already.

681
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:18,225
Miss Appleton, you may begin.

682
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:20,936
From March 6 through June 12...

683
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:24,314
I surveilled Mrs. Cole
at the behest of Mr. Cole.

684
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:27,066
During that period,
I noted that Mr. Cole...

685
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,278
Ieft each day
between 7:40 and 7:50.

686
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,948
Thereafter Mrs. Cole
would frequently have...

687
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:38,076
a male visitor arrive and stay
from one to four hours.

688
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,789
I was able to take several photographs
of the male visitor.

689
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,417
I see.

690
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:49,587
Do you know what Mrs. Cole
and her male visitor did...

691
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,715
during these frequent... visits?

692
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:56,176
Well, they were pretty good
about keeping the shades drawn,

693
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,889
but I was able to make
a recording of one such session.

694
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:04,517
Your Honor,
as you are aware,

695
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:07,020
under the terms
of the prenuptial agreement,

696
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:10,898
if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.

697
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,860
With your permission, we'd like to play
the following tape recording.

698
00:51:19,615 --> 00:51:22,075
<i><b>Here comes big daddy!</b></i>

699
00:51:22,117 --> 00:51:25,370
<i><b>Oh, God! Do it to me!</b></i>

700
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:29,207
<i><b>Do it to me! Harder! Harder!</b></i>

701
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:36,880
Oh, come on!

702
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:42,511
Your Honor, how can it be proved
that the male voice on that tape
is not Mr. Cole himself?

703
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:46,723
<i><b>You are such a better lover
than my husband!</b></i>

704
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:50,309
Your Honor, I object!
- And why is that, Mr. Reede?

705
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:53,312
It's devastating to my case!
- Overruled.

706
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:55,439
Good call!

707
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:59,026
<i><b>I gotta go. I haven't cleaned your pool.
- Your witness.</b></i>

708
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:02,070
All right.

709
00:52:02,154 --> 00:52:05,240
Well, Mr. Reede,
you may proceed.

710
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:12,663
How?

711
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:40,439
Your Honor, would the court be willing
to grant me a short bathroom break?

712
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:43,358
Can't it wait?
- Yes, it can.

713
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:46,819
But I've heard that if you hold it,
it can damage the prostate gland,

714
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:49,447
making it very difficult
to get an erection!

715
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,325
Is that true?
- It has to be.

716
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:55,327
Well, in that case, I better
take a little break myself.

717
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:58,705
But you get back here immediately
so we can finish this.

718
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:19,600
How am I going
to get out of this?

719
00:53:20,892 --> 00:53:24,396
Think. Think.

720
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:28,399
Think!

721
00:54:24,117 --> 00:54:26,536
What the hell
are you doing?

722
00:54:27,704 --> 00:54:31,582
I'm kicking my ass!
Do you mind?

723
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:59,358
I found him like this
in the bathroom, Your Honor.

724
00:54:59,441 --> 00:55:01,401
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

725
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:04,404
Who did this?
- A madman, Your Honor!

726
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:07,699
A desperate fool at the end
of his pitiful rope!

727
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:09,909
What did he look like?

728
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:13,245
About 6'2", 180 pounds,
big teeth, kind of gangly.

729
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,831
Bailiff, have the deputy
search the building.

730
00:55:15,873 --> 00:55:18,375
Yes, sir.

731
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,002
Order! Order!

732
00:55:25,548 --> 00:55:29,010
Under the circumstances, I have
no choice but to recess this case...

733
00:55:29,052 --> 00:55:32,096
until 9:00 a. m.
tomorrow morning.

734
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:35,391
Unless, of course, you feel
you can still proceed.

735
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:41,521
Can you?

736
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:50,571
Yes, I can.

737
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:53,574
I admire your courage, Mr. Reede.

738
00:55:53,657 --> 00:55:56,327
We'll take a short recess
so that you can compose yourself,

739
00:55:56,368 --> 00:55:58,537
and then we'll get started.

740
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:10,339
Here you go.

741
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:23,685
Hello?

742
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:27,397
Dad?
- Max? How's it goin'?

743
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:30,024
Great. You know Paul and Emanuel
from across the street?

744
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:33,819
Yeah. Uh-huh. - Well, they never
want to play baseball with me.

745
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:36,238
But I told them I'm playing
tonight with my dad.

746
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,574
So now they want to play.
Is that okay?

747
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,618
Sure. The more the merrier.

748
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,787
Coolest! Do you wanna be
Jose Canseco?

749
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,624
Oh, yeah. Who else is gonna hit
that famous Nomo slider?

750
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:52,086
Mr. Reede.
- I gotta go now, Max.

751
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:57,091
I'll see you
in a couple hours. Okay? Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

752
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:01,636
He's really coming!
I'm gonna go change.

753
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,763
Okay, go ahead!
- Yeah!

754
00:57:08,518 --> 00:57:10,686
Mr. Reede!

755
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:14,982
Mr. Reede! Mr. -

756
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,359
This is my lawyer.
He's a little unorthodox.

757
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:23,240
Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth Falk,
the man from the tape.

758
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:25,909
How could I forget?
- Hey, how you doin'?

759
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,120
I've slipped into the seventh
circle of hell! Thank you.

760
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:32,164
You? - Shouldn't we be going
over our testimony right now?

761
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:35,125
Basically, the plan is,
I walk you through the tape.

762
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,378
Step-by-step,
I ask you questions.

763
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:41,339
And we give the explanation
you came up with. - Exactly.

764
00:57:41,423 --> 00:57:43,550
All we gotta do is lie.
That sounds simple enough.

765
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:45,677
Doesn't it!

766
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,638
Then I'll finish up
with dramatic questions.

767
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,351
Something like: Mr. Falk, isn't it true
that you and Mrs. Cole...

768
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:58,397
have never made...

769
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:06,779
Ugh! Oh, God!
I can't do it.

770
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:10,950
I can't finish the question
if I know the answer is a lie.

771
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:29,258
You may proceed, Mr. Reede.

772
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:46,024
Respondent calls...

773
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:48,067
Kenneth Falk.

774
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,543
Raise your right hand.

775
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,630
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

776
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,425
I do! I mean-

777
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:20,055
I do.

778
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:28,396
Mr. Falk.

779
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:33,692
Do you know my client,
Samantha Cole?

780
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:35,778
Yes.

781
00:59:39,406 --> 00:59:43,868
Isn't it true that your relationship
with my client is entirely platonic?

782
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,954
I object, Your Honor!

783
00:59:46,037 --> 00:59:48,456
To yourself?

784
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:50,666
Yeah.

785
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,670
But I would like to...
rephrase the question.

786
00:59:57,214 --> 01:00:00,467
Mr. Falk, would I be accurate...

787
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:05,263
if I described your relationship
with Mrs. Cole as totally professional?

788
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:08,474
I object, Your Honor,
and I move to strike!

789
01:00:08,558 --> 01:00:11,143
Mr. Reede, I don't know
what you're on,

790
01:00:11,227 --> 01:00:14,730
but you better get
to the point and quick.

791
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:17,066
Thank you, sir.

792
01:00:19,943 --> 01:00:23,488
Is your relationship
with my client entirely platonic?

793
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:26,282
Not! Is not your relationship
with my client:

794
01:00:26,324 --> 01:00:29,619
<i><b>Boink! Bad baby, bad baby!</b></i>

795
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,829
Did you ever not make lo-

796
01:00:31,912 --> 01:00:34,915
Did you-
- Mr. Reede!

797
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:39,127
You had sex with her every time you met,
didn't you? Didn't you! Liar!

798
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,338
He's badgering the witness.
- It's his witness.

799
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:44,966
You slammed her! You dunked her donuts!
You gave her dog a "snaussage"!

800
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,427
You stuffed her
like a Thanksgiving turkey!

801
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:54,850
All right, it's true, okay! I humped
her brains out! There! Now you happy?

802
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:03,483
No further questions.

803
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,170
No questions.

804
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:28,172
You may step down.

805
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:34,929
Do I dare ask you
to call your next witness?

806
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:41,143
I have no further witnesses,
Your Honor.

807
01:01:41,184 --> 01:01:44,104
What are you doing?
Call me!

808
01:01:44,187 --> 01:01:47,440
You do not understand.
I can't lie.

809
01:01:47,523 --> 01:01:50,443
I can't do anything dishonest
until 8:15 tonight!

810
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:53,612
Listen, you bastard!
I want my money!

811
01:01:53,696 --> 01:01:57,032
I am not going to end up
a 31-year-old divorcee on welfare...

812
01:01:57,074 --> 01:02:00,702
because my scumbag attorney
had a sudden attack of conscience!

813
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:03,288
Thirty-one?

814
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:06,374
If Mr. Reede has
no further witnesses,

815
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:08,876
then I have no choice
but to rule in favor of-

816
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:10,837
Your Honor!

817
01:02:13,214 --> 01:02:16,050
I call Samantha Cole
to the stand.

818
01:02:16,091 --> 01:02:20,053
Order.

819
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:23,014
Order! Order!

820
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:25,475
Knock it off!
- Sit down!

821
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:29,979
Mr. Reede, it is out of
sheer morbid curiosity...

822
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:32,773
I'm allowing this...
freak show to continue.

823
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:39,154
Mrs. Cole...
if you dare.

824
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:57,212
Mrs. Cole...

825
01:02:57,254 --> 01:03:00,757
is this a copy
of your driver's license?

826
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:05,762
Yes. - It says here
you're a blonde. Are you?

827
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:08,723
If you don't remember,
perhaps Mr. Falk will.

828
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:11,475
Brunette. - We can play the tape
again. Maybe it's on there.

829
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:13,602
I'm a brunette!

830
01:03:13,644 --> 01:03:16,939
Thank you.
Now let's see.

831
01:03:17,022 --> 01:03:20,067
<i><b>Weight: 105.
Yeah! In your bra.</b></i>

832
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:22,068
Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

833
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,070
Bastard!
- Hag!

834
01:03:24,112 --> 01:03:27,073
Quiet! Overruled! Weight?

835
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:30,910
One-eighteen.

836
01:03:30,952 --> 01:03:33,954
All right, fine, fine.
I'm 127.

837
01:03:33,996 --> 01:03:37,124
Uh-huh. And it says here
you were born in 1964,

838
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,501
but that's not true
either, is it?

839
01:03:39,585 --> 01:03:41,503
Is it!
- No.

840
01:03:41,586 --> 01:03:45,465
Will you tell me what it says here on your
birth certificate under "date of birth"?

841
01:03:45,507 --> 01:03:48,092
Your Honor, what does this
have to do with anything?

842
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:51,095
Overruled. Mrs. Cole,
answer the question.

843
01:03:51,137 --> 01:03:54,431
<i><b>1965.</b></i>

844
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:57,976
Now let me get this straight.

845
01:03:58,018 --> 01:04:02,772
That would mean that you lied
about your age to make yourself older.

846
01:04:02,814 --> 01:04:07,193
But why would any woman
want to do that?

847
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:09,821
I changed it
so I could get married.

848
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:14,450
And the truth
shall set you free!

849
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:17,244
My client lied about her age!

850
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:20,706
She was only 17 when she got married,
which makes her a minor,

851
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:23,166
and in the great
state of California,

852
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,543
no minor can enter
into any legal contract...

853
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:27,837
without parental consent,
including-

854
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:29,839
Prenuptial agreements.

855
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:32,883
Prenuptial agreements!
This contract is void!

856
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:36,679
The fact that my client has been ridden
more than Seattle Slew is irrelevant.

857
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,807
Standard Community Property applies, and she
is entitled to half of the marital assets,

858
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:43,393
or $11.395 million!

859
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:47,772
Jordan fades back. Swoosh!
And that's the game!

860
01:04:47,855 --> 01:04:50,983
Nothing further, Your Honor.

861
01:04:58,824 --> 01:05:02,077
Order. Order. Order!

862
01:05:04,496 --> 01:05:06,539
In light of this new evidence,

863
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:09,167
the court must rule
in favor of Mrs. Cole.

864
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:13,295
Yes! - She is hereby awarded
half the marital assets.

865
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:17,341
The son of a bitch pulled it off!

866
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:21,762
I didn't know! - It doesn't
matter. The contract's void.

867
01:05:21,845 --> 01:05:25,890
Order. Order.

868
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:29,477
I understand both parties
have agreed to joint custody.

869
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,103
Is that correct?
- Yes.

870
01:05:31,187 --> 01:05:32,646
Yes.
- No.

871
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,648
I'm contesting custody.

872
01:05:34,732 --> 01:05:37,234
What?
- If I get sole custody,

873
01:05:37,317 --> 01:05:39,861
that's another ten grand
in child support payments.

874
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:42,322
You just won $11 million!

875
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:45,241
Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.

876
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:48,745
Now I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts.

877
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:53,207
But you-
you said he was a good father.

878
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,793
So?

879
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:02,549
Well, Mr. Reede, do we have
an agreement on custody or not?

880
01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:07,136
No.

881
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:10,097
I see.

882
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:15,102
In that case, there will be a custody
hearing on the 19th at 9:00 a.m.

883
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:17,479
Court is adjourned.

884
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:26,279
Come on, let's go.
- Daddy!

885
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:29,282
You stop that whining, or I'll
give you something to whine about!

886
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:32,034
I wanna go with Daddy!

887
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:34,954
Come here, kids. Come on.
It's all right. Don't you worry.

888
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:38,165
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

889
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,292
It's okay. It's okay.

890
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:43,378
Oh, for God's sake, will you
give me those? They're mine!

891
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:46,381
Let go of Daddy! Let go of him!
Let go of Daddy!

892
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:49,842
We're leaving now! Lupe, come on!
- Sí, seòora.

893
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:54,138
Don't you have some checks to write?
You haven't paid for them yet.

894
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:09,068
I love children.

895
01:07:09,152 --> 01:07:12,071
They give you so much leverage
in a case like this.

896
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:16,492
You did an incredible job, partner.

897
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,869
Look at him.

898
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,413
He's stunned.
He can't believe it.

899
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:27,293
Your Honor, may I please
approach the bench?

900
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,712
We're adjourned, Mr. Reede.

901
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:33,257
Your Honor, I think
we've made a big mistake.

902
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,801
Mr. Reede, I am tired
and very cranky.

903
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:39,638
I know, but this is
just... wrong, isn't it?

904
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,807
I manipulated the system.

905
01:07:41,848 --> 01:07:45,810
Just because you bought it doesn't mean
I'm right. It's a technicality!

906
01:07:45,852 --> 01:07:49,021
Young man, having my judgement
mocked in my own court...

907
01:07:49,105 --> 01:07:51,440
is not something
I'm prepared to tolerate!

908
01:07:51,524 --> 01:07:55,819
Well, tell that to the kids when they're
adopted... by the Manson family!

909
01:07:55,861 --> 01:07:59,948
One more word out of you, Mr. Reede,
and I'll hold you in contempt!

910
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:02,951
I hold myself in contempt!

911
01:08:03,034 --> 01:08:05,245
Why should you be any different?

912
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:07,330
Bailiff, take him away!

913
01:08:07,372 --> 01:08:10,291
This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

914
01:08:10,374 --> 01:08:14,628
Oh, no, don't do this!
I have a date to play ball with my son!

915
01:08:14,712 --> 01:08:18,382
I can't be late!
It's my last chance!

916
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:20,801
I'm Jose Canseco!

917
01:08:20,884 --> 01:08:24,262
I'm Jose Canseco!

918
01:08:27,223 --> 01:08:29,183
Phone call!
Phone call!

919
01:08:29,225 --> 01:08:32,186
I get a phone call!
I get a phone call!

920
01:08:32,228 --> 01:08:34,396
I get a phone call!

921
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:36,940
Hello?

922
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:39,651
Audrey, it's me.
Don't hang up!

923
01:08:39,735 --> 01:08:42,320
I can't talk right now.
Our flight leaves at 8:00.

924
01:08:42,404 --> 01:08:46,533
What? - I'm taking Max someplace
where you can't do this anymore.

925
01:08:46,574 --> 01:08:49,911
Audrey, wait! The most amazing
thing has happened to me.

926
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:53,706
I'm a changed man! Just come to
the courthouse with $1,000 and bail me out.

927
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:56,750
Hello? Hello?

928
01:08:56,834 --> 01:09:00,045
Time's up, pal. - No, just one
more call. Just one more call.

929
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,426
Okay, let's go.

930
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:10,054
Ready?
- Yeah.

931
01:09:10,096 --> 01:09:13,057
Will you get the door, please?
- Okay.

932
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:15,392
Thank you.

933
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:18,937
Mr. Reede, you made bail.

934
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:22,107
Greta! Oh, thank God!

935
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:25,777
Am I too late?
Have you been sexually molested yet?

936
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,321
Because I could circle the block.

937
01:09:28,404 --> 01:09:30,740
How did you know I was here?

938
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:33,075
One of the other secretaries
called me at home,

939
01:09:33,117 --> 01:09:35,578
said you went all noble
in front of Mr. Allan.

940
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:37,913
Yeah, I think I'm fired.
Isn't that great?

941
01:09:37,955 --> 01:09:40,290
I'll start my own firm.
Do you need a job?

942
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:42,876
I don't think
you can afford me.

943
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:49,799
Oh, man, I gotta get my car.
Audrey's on her way to the airport.

944
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:53,594
I could lose Max forever.
I can't let that happen. I love him!

945
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:56,263
You know, this truth stuff
is pretty cool.

946
01:09:56,305 --> 01:10:00,350
I love my son!
I love my son!

947
01:10:00,434 --> 01:10:04,104
I love my son!
I love my son!

948
01:10:04,145 --> 01:10:07,857
Hey, need some change?
Take everything!

949
01:10:09,817 --> 01:10:11,777
But it's not gonna make you happy.

950
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:14,280
I love my son!

951
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:16,615
I love my son!

952
01:10:16,657 --> 01:10:19,451
I love my son!

953
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,871
Hey, there you are!

954
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:25,707
Hi.
- Just in time.

955
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:28,793
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my entire life.

956
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:32,129
O-Oh! Well, m-me, m-mine-

957
01:10:32,171 --> 01:10:34,548
Well, ours... also.

958
01:10:34,632 --> 01:10:39,136
Hey, gipper. I have something
for you, young man.

959
01:10:39,177 --> 01:10:42,973
Ooh, watch yourself.
It's the claw!

960
01:10:43,014 --> 01:10:45,642
Ooh, the claw's comin' at ya.

961
01:10:45,683 --> 01:10:49,687
Ooh, you're scared of the claw.
You're scared of the claw.

962
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:52,898
Jerry. Jerry.
- Huh?

963
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,234
It's okay.
You don't have to-

964
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,820
Tower Air flight 1511
to Boston is now boarding.

965
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:00,822
Ooh, that's us.
- Yeah.

966
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:03,533
Ready to go?
- Yes. You ready?

967
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:05,743
Okay.
- Great.

968
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:07,620
Jim Rubing, please report
to Airport Security.

969
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:16,045
Excuse me!

970
01:11:16,128 --> 01:11:19,047
What gate is flight 1511 leaving from?
It's an emergency!

971
01:11:19,089 --> 01:11:22,425
Gate number 123,
but you'll never make it.
Flight's already boarding.

972
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:25,261
It takes more than a half hour
to get through security.

973
01:11:25,345 --> 01:11:29,265
If you want to go to Boston,
there's another flight leaving
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.

974
01:11:29,348 --> 01:11:31,601
Flight number one-twenty-

975
01:11:33,602 --> 01:11:36,647
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard flight 1511...

976
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,941
from Los Angeles
to Boston's Logan Airport.

977
01:11:39,024 --> 01:11:42,777
We'll be departing shortly, and if you
need help stowing your carry-on items-

978
01:11:42,861 --> 01:11:44,738
Honey, can I help you?
- I'm fine.

979
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:48,783
Are you sure?
- Jerry, I can open the bag!

980
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:52,536
Would you like anything
to drink before takeoff?

981
01:11:52,578 --> 01:11:55,748
Yes. Anything
with alcohol, please.

982
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:58,250
Audrey.

983
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:02,087
If you'll focus on the screen,
we'll be running a safety video.

984
01:12:02,129 --> 01:12:04,297
How about that drink?

985
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,779
Max! Max!

986
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:34,408
Max!

987
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,785
Wait!

988
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:43,291
That oughta do it.

989
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:49,881
Thanks! It's running great!

990
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,135
Max!

991
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:03,435
Hey! Max!

992
01:13:17,656 --> 01:13:20,659
Max! I'm coming!

993
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,170
Max!

994
01:13:41,845 --> 01:13:45,056
Max! Max, where are you?

995
01:13:49,477 --> 01:13:51,395
I love you.

996
01:13:54,231 --> 01:13:56,275
Thank you.

997
01:13:56,358 --> 01:14:00,320
That wasn't exactly
the answer I was looking for.

998
01:14:00,362 --> 01:14:03,365
Thank you very much?

999
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:09,954
I'm sorry. It's just-
- Too fast?

1000
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:12,415
It was too fast, wasn't it?
- No, i-it's-

1001
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:14,833
Chemistry?
Whatever it is, we can work on it.

1002
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:19,421
No, no, no. It's just that-
- Oh, my God, it's Fletcher!

1003
01:14:19,504 --> 01:14:23,300
No, no, this has nothing to do with
Fletcher. - No, honey, it's Fletcher.

1004
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:26,594
What?
- Dad?

1005
01:14:28,012 --> 01:14:31,807
I made it!
I'm late, but I made it!

1006
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:34,643
What is he doing?

1007
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:38,397
He came to see us off. Wave.

1008
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,487
I won't let you go!

1009
01:14:51,784 --> 01:14:54,078
Oh, shit!

1010
01:14:59,124 --> 01:15:02,919
Control one-nine, this is
Tower 1511, heavy. Ready for takeoff.

1011
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:12,887
What was that?
- Looked like a shoe.

1012
01:15:12,928 --> 01:15:15,180
Pull over!

1013
01:15:15,264 --> 01:15:17,808
Pull this thing over!

1014
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:21,937
Control one-nine, some idiot
has hijacked a flight of stairs.
We're gonna stop this plane.

1015
01:15:21,978 --> 01:15:25,607
One-nine Control. We copy.

1016
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:32,321
No-o-o-o-o!

1017
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,650
You people are all doing
a wonderful job!

1018
01:16:12,692 --> 01:16:14,818
That's far enough, folks.

1019
01:16:14,902 --> 01:16:17,654
He's my husband-
was my husband.

1020
01:16:17,696 --> 01:16:19,698
All right, go ahead.
- Okay.

1021
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:22,993
Max, you stay here with Jerry,
and I'll be right back, okay?

1022
01:16:25,954 --> 01:16:28,664
Audrey! Great news!
- Fletcher!

1023
01:16:28,706 --> 01:16:32,001
Both my legs are broken,
so they can't take me right to jail.

1024
01:16:32,043 --> 01:16:35,004
Fletcher, what were you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

1025
01:16:35,045 --> 01:16:39,967
No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

1026
01:16:40,008 --> 01:16:43,428
Dad?
- Creep.

1027
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:47,098
He was getting kind of upset.
- Are you all right?

1028
01:16:47,181 --> 01:16:51,352
Yeah. I'm hurtin' here, though.

1029
01:16:51,435 --> 01:16:54,021
I'm a dope, Max.

1030
01:16:54,063 --> 01:16:56,523
All this time
you've been here...

1031
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:59,401
and I could see you anytime,
but I didn't.

1032
01:16:59,484 --> 01:17:04,030
Then your mom told me you were moving
to Boston, and I started thinking.

1033
01:17:04,072 --> 01:17:06,699
I could be sitting around
sometime and...

1034
01:17:06,741 --> 01:17:11,412
want to look at you
and hold you and play with you,

1035
01:17:11,495 --> 01:17:14,707
and I won't be able to.

1036
01:17:14,748 --> 01:17:18,252
I don't think I'm gonna
do too well with that.

1037
01:17:19,962 --> 01:17:23,506
I love you more than anything else
in the world, Max,

1038
01:17:23,548 --> 01:17:25,884
and you know it's true.

1039
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:29,011
I couldn't say it if it
wasn't true. Not today.

1040
01:17:31,097 --> 01:17:36,060
I love you, and I'll
never hurt you again.

1041
01:17:39,938 --> 01:17:42,857
He's telling the truth, Mom.
He's not allowed to lie.

1042
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:46,778
I made a wish, and anything Dad
says today has to be the truth.

1043
01:17:46,861 --> 01:17:48,780
Max.

1044
01:17:49,906 --> 01:17:52,325
It's 8:45.

1045
01:17:52,408 --> 01:17:54,702
You made the wish at 8:15.

1046
01:17:54,743 --> 01:17:57,621
I've been able to lie
for the last half hour.

1047
01:17:57,704 --> 01:18:00,916
So you weren't-
- No, it was the truth!

1048
01:18:00,957 --> 01:18:03,418
I just wanted
to be honest with you.

1049
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,920
I always want
to be honest with you.

1050
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:15,554
Mom, do we have to go to Boston?

1051
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:22,894
No, Max, you don't have to go.

1052
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:28,691
I, on the other hand,
do have to.

1053
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:31,611
A hospital to run.

1054
01:18:31,652 --> 01:18:35,823
That's an open-ended ticket
if you ever change your mind.

1055
01:18:35,906 --> 01:18:38,116
Thank you.

1056
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:47,000
Looks like he's
got his father back.

1057
01:18:53,339 --> 01:18:59,303
<i><b>Happy birthday, dear Maximus</b></i>

1058
01:18:59,344 --> 01:19:05,809
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

1059
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,977
Okay, Max, make a wish.

1060
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:11,647
Ahhh, wait! I don't know
if we should do this.

1061
01:19:11,731 --> 01:19:15,776
Oh, Fletcher, come on. What are
the odds of that happening again?

1062
01:19:17,736 --> 01:19:20,238
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1063
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,407
Okay, Max, go ahead.

1064
01:19:29,705 --> 01:19:32,750
Mom? Dad?

1065
01:19:47,513 --> 01:19:49,432
Max!

1066
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:56,313
Did you wish for your mom and I
to get back together again?

1067
01:19:56,355 --> 01:19:58,815
No, I wished for Rollerblades.

1068
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:06,197
Do you want to cut the cake...

1069
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,199
Dad?

1070
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:10,451
I'd love to.

1071
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:13,370
But I have
this horrible pain in my arm.

1072
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:15,456
Oh, no, it's the claw!

1073
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:18,375
No one can stop the claw!

1074
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:22,754
No one can stop it!

1075
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:31,345
Nothing can stop the claw!

1076
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:58,203
If I was a boxer, l would bounce
those things like Sugar Ray Leonard.

1077
01:20:58,245 --> 01:21:01,248
I'm sorry.

1078
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,750
Brought your kids
to your divorce?

1079
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,794
Sympathy.
- Well, it's working!

1080
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:08,379
I feel sorry for them already.

1081
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:11,590
For this you will pay
a terrible price.

1082
01:21:14,593 --> 01:21:17,763
Well, it's working!
I feel sorry for them already.

1083
01:21:30,775 --> 01:21:32,735
Mrs. Cole...

1084
01:21:45,914 --> 01:21:47,999
a goose.

1085
01:21:50,668 --> 01:21:52,628
Including-

1086
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,630
Prenuptial agreements.

1087
01:21:54,672 --> 01:21:58,008
<i><b>Prenuptial agreements</b></i>

1088
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:05,974
No! I'd have got him ten.

1089
01:22:06,015 --> 01:22:08,309
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.

1090
01:22:08,351 --> 01:22:10,853
No! Wait!
I didn't know she had-

1091
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:38,712
Oh, shit.

1092
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:42,716
<i><b>Now let's see.
Weight: 105?</b></i>

1093
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:44,843
Yeah! In your bra.

1094
01:22:44,884 --> 01:22:47,178
Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

1095
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,347
Overactor!
- Jezebel!

1096
01:22:54,393 --> 01:22:58,647
He put me up to it.

1097
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:02,692
Yeah, sure he did.

1098
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:05,778
Oh, no.
They're onto me.
