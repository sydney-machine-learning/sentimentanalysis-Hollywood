1
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,890
Come, come!

2
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,490
Please!

3
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,510
Aziz. Aziz.

4
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,750
Aziz, light!

5
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,340
Aziz...

6
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,510
light.

7
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,510
Good.

8
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,420
We start again.

9
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,020
"When the three planets
are in eclipse...

10
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,360
the black hole,
like a door, is open.

11
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,370
Evil comes...

12
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,870
spreading terror and chaos."

13
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,530
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

14
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,610
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.

15
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,270
I got all the snakes.

16
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,710
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

17
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,220
If this is the five...

18
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,550
and this is the one...

19
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,050
every 5,000 years.

20
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,720
So, I've got some time then.

21
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,740
You bring them water.

22
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,740
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.

23
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,750
Go with God.
Be safe from evil.

24
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,150
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

25
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,410
gathering the four elements
of life...

26
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,420
water, fire, earth, air...

27
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,490
around a fifth one.

28
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,990
A fifth...

29
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,120
element.

30
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,330
Forgive me, Lord.

31
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,440
They already know
too much.

32
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,240
Father.

33
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,870
How are you?

34
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,110
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

35
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

36
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,690
It's the greatest find
in history.

37
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,190
You must be parched.

38
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,190
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,690
It's like a battle plan.

40
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,450
Here the good.

41
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,860
Here the evil.

42
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,290
And here, a weapon...

43
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,530
against evil.

44
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,370
I'm going
to be famous.

45
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,470
Then let us toast
to your fame.

46
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,980
To fame.

47
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
<i>Salute.</i>

48
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,650
You can't toast
with water.

49
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,050
Billy, in my sack,
the grappa.

50
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,570
This I don't understand.

51
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,230
This could be something...

52
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,500
prehistoric.

53
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,070
I don't know.

54
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,080
But, wait.

55
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,740
Here.

56
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,080
Look, look.

57
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,590
They're here.

58
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,770
This man...

59
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,370
this perfect being.

60
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,040
I know this is the key.
I know it.

61
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,450
This divine light
they talk about.

62
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,620
What is divine light?

63
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,290
Aziz, light!

64
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,230
Much better.
Thank you.

65
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,410
My Lord.

66
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,630
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I've ever seen.

67
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,030
Don't you think?

68
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,860
Are you German?

69
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,030
Lord...

70
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,200
I know he was about
to discover everything.

71
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,470
But, no worry.

72
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,440
I was there in time.

73
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,940
Priest...

74
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,780
you and those before you...

75
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,890
have served us well.

76
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,280
But war is coming.

77
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,550
Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

78
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,400
This...

79
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,580
is really amazing.

80
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,780
The fifth element.

81
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,610
Take the stones.

82
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,420
My Lord...

83
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,890
if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenseless...

84
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,320
when evil returns.

85
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,660
In 300 years...

86
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,060
when evil returns...

87
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,230
so shall we.

88
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,670
Oh, Professor.

89
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,340
Professor.

90
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,350
Don't move!

91
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,590
I have a gun!

92
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,220
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

93
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,460
Friends?

94
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,190
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!

95
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,860
I'll explain everything.

96
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,570
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

97
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,970
I am your friend.

98
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,530
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

99
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,440
Please, put...

100
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,810
the gun down.

101
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,110
Billy, no!

102
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,550
Hurry!

103
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,950
The wall is closing!

104
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,960
Here is your mission:

105
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,290
Pass your knowledge
to the next priest...

106
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,020
as it was passed to you.

107
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,960
I will do as
you command, but...

108
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,960
hurry, you still
have time.

109
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,900
Time not important.

110
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,560
Only life...

111
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,800
important.

112
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,910
I will fulfill
my mission!

113
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,580
You can count on me!

114
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,260
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

115
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,550
Anything yet?

116
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,960
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.

117
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,620
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5,000.

118
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,860
Let's see it.

119
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,140
It's taking shape.

120
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,400
Send out a probe.

121
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,340
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

122
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,640
<i>the President of</i>
<i>the Federated Territories.</i>

123
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,140
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

124
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,320
I saved this seat
for you, Father.

125
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,730
President on the line.

126
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,160
We're in position.

127
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,390
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.

128
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,040
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

129
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,940
All the calibers are overshot.

130
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,840
<i>We're initiating</i>
<i>thermonucleatic imaging.</i>

131
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,810
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

132
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,510
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

133
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,570
Recommendation?

134
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,740
My philosophy is:
Shoot first and ask questions later.

135
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,390
I don't like uninvited guests.

136
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,680
All right, then.

137
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,920
Mr. President?

138
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,090
<i>Priest Vito Cornelius,</i>
<i>expert of astrophenomenon.</i>

139
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,090
I...

140
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,930
have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

141
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,860
You have 20 seconds.

142
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,110
Imagine that this...

143
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,380
thing is not anything
that can be identified...

144
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,780
because it prefers not to be.

145
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,610
Wherever there is life...

146
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,720
it brings death...

147
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,780
because it's evil.

148
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,890
Absolute evil.

149
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,620
One more reason
to shoot first.

150
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,460
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

151
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,120
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

152
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,640
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

153
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,070
Growth rate is at 27%.

154
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,150
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time to go into it.

155
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,810
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

156
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,450
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

157
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,650
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

158
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,420
You may fire when ready.

159
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,760
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

160
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,670
Its structure solidified
on the surface.

161
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,500
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

162
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,010
The most...

163
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,770
terrible intelligence imaginable.

164
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,940
120's loaded.

165
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,780
The ship is
in combat formation.

166
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,850
<i>Missiles are loaded.</i>

167
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,180
- Staedert.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

168
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,850
I have a doubt.

169
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,950
I don't, Mr. President.

170
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,870
What happened?
Can you hear me?

171
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,800
What happened?

172
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,540
<i>- Did you destroy it?</i>
- I'm about to.

173
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,150
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

174
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,810
It's moving toward the ship.

175
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,390
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

176
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,890
Nothing, sir.

177
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,830
Staedert, do you hear me?

178
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,500
Get out of there.

179
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,900
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

180
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,240
<i>Get out of there.</i>
<i>Can you hear me, Staedert?</i>

181
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,400
<i>Do you understand?</i>
<i>Listen.</i>

182
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,170
That's an order.

183
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,510
<i>Do you understand me?</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

184
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,680
<i>Get out of there!</i>

185
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,690
Good God!

186
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,710
<i>Four a day.</i>

187
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,630
I'm tryin'.

188
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,300
<i>To quit is my goal.</i>

189
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,330
I'm up.

190
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,470
All right, I'm up.

191
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,900
God.

192
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,950
<i>Hey, dog brain,</i>
<i>Finger here.</i>

193
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,010
Hi, sweetie.

194
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,350
<i>I love you too.</i>

195
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,110
<i>You haven't called me that</i>
<i>since basic training.</i>

196
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,250
I was talking
to the cat.

197
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,950
<i>I forgot...</i>

198
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,580
<i>you prefer your cat</i>
<i>to the real thing.</i>

199
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,250
At least the cat
comes back.

200
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,590
<i>Still pining</i>
<i>for that two-timing slut?</i>

201
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,100
<i>There's millions</i>
<i>out there.</i>

202
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,830
I don't want
a million.

203
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,930
I just want one.

204
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,100
The perfect one.

205
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,930
<i>It don't exist, Major.</i>

206
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,940
Yeah, I know.

207
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,930
<i>What?</i>

208
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,000
Picture of you.

209
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,610
<i>- How do I look?</i>
- Like shit.

210
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,210
<i>Must be an old picture.</i>

211
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,540
Bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul.

212
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,010
- Negative.
<i>- A.S.A.P.</i>

213
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,340
I don't need one.

214
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,620
<i>Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?</i>
<i>I know how you drive.</i>

215
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,450
Finger, I drive
a cab now...

216
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,290
not a space fighter.

217
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,190
<i>Tell me. How many points</i>
<i>you got left on your license?</i>

218
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,530
<i>Major, how many points?</i>

219
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,140
At least 50.

220
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,760
<i>Know what?</i>
<i>You gotta learn to lie better.</i>

221
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,170
<i>See you tonight.</i>

222
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,380
<i>Welcome to Paradise.</i>

223
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,240
<i>Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.</i>

224
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,310
<i>It's Ruby Rhod,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you live at five...</i>

225
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,720
<i>the winner of the super green</i>
<i>Gemini Croquette Contest!</i>

226
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,190
<i>The winner will go with me</i>
<i>for two days to Fhloston Paradise.</i>

227
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,990
<i>Tune in to Radio Cosmos.</i>

228
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,220
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

229
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,730
<i>For a perfect world.</i>

230
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,770
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

231
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,330
Long enough.
Give me the cash.

232
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,240
Is that a Z-140?

233
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,670
Alleviated titanium.

234
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,250
Neurocharged assault model.

235
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,510
Good thing for me
it's not loaded.

236
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,920
It's not loaded?

237
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,590
You have to...

238
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,680
push that yellow button
to load it.

239
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,020
Take your time.

240
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,400
Want me to...

241
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,110
There you go.

242
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,270
Give me the cash!

243
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,210
That's a very
dangerous gun.

244
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,550
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

245
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,490
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?

246
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,790
No. Take it.
I don't need it.

247
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,620
That's a nice hat.

248
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,170
You like it?

249
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,100
God!

250
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,940
<i>Please enter your license.</i>

251
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,140
Yes, just a minute.

252
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,040
<i>Welcome, Mr. Dallas.</i>

253
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,510
Good morning.

254
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,120
Sleep well? Me too.

255
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,180
I had a horrible nightmare.

256
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,380
<i>Propulsion 2-X-4.</i>

257
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,360
<i>You have five points left</i>
<i>on your license.</i>

258
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,020
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

259
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,300
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

260
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,700
Why not?

261
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,550
You have 48 hours.

262
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,710
That's the time it needs to adapt
itself to our living conditions.

263
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,880
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

264
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,490
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

265
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,060
but to exterminate life.

266
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,730
All forms of life.

267
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,830
You're telling me
there's nothing that can stop this.

268
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,330
There is only one thing.

269
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,910
<i>The Mondoshawan have in their</i>
<i>possession the weapon to defeat evil.</i>

270
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,070
Four elements...

271
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,640
gathered around a fifth...

272
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,610
supreme being,
the ultimate warrior...

273
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,620
created to protect life.

274
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,880
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."

275
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,120
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

276
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,890
But, if...

277
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,120
evil stands there...

278
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,960
Then what?

279
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,400
Then light turns to dark.

280
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,060
Life to death...

281
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,470
forever.

282
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,750
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

283
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,650
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

284
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,810
Thank you.

285
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,990
<i>Permission to enter granted.</i>

286
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,260
Show time.

287
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,380
We are lost.

288
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,380
<i>Aknot, we are connected to Earth.</i>

289
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,720
Mr. Zorg's office.

290
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,160
<i>It's Aknot.</i>

291
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,730
I'm so glad
to hear you, Aknot.

292
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
<i>The mission is accomplished.</i>

293
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,000
<i>You'll have what you asked for</i>
<i>in a few hours.</i>

294
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,830
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.

295
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,510
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

296
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,240
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

297
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,350
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

298
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,020
Three hundred years
of waiting for nothing.

299
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,250
Go get some rest.

300
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,680
No.

301
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,850
The Mondoshawan...

302
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,690
I am their contact.

303
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,260
They will come for me.

304
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,090
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

305
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,530
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

306
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,100
Any survivors?

307
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,600
Only one.

308
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,370
You call that a survivor?

309
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,680
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

310
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,220
Have you identified it?

311
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,870
The computer went
off the charts.

312
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,890
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

313
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,620
which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

314
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,780
This has 200,000 memo groups.

315
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,790
Sounds like
a freak of nature.

316
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,970
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

317
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,410
You okay?
Over here.

318
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,750
Excuse me.

319
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,240
General, I want
to show you something.

320
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,690
This is a normal
human DNA chain.

321
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
You, me, anybody, right?

322
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,430
Watch this.

323
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,760
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

324
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,170
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

325
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,100
Almost like this being
was engineered.

326
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,510
Is there any danger?

327
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,770
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

328
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,940
The cell is,
for lack of a better word...

329
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,950
perfect.

330
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,190
Go ahead.

331
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,120
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

332
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,350
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.

333
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,190
Activate it.

334
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,060
Tissue processing.

335
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,840
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

336
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,410
This is the last phase.

337
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,720
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

338
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,360
That means
growing skin.

339
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,920
Wonderful.

340
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,600
Reconstruction complete.

341
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,530
Remove the shield.

342
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,440
I told you.
Perfect.

343
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,220
Thermal bandages.

344
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,120
I'd...

345
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,960
like to take
a few pictures...

346
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,300
for the archives.

347
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,460
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

348
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,190
Activate the phonic detector.

349
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,040
Is that thing solid?

350
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,650
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

351
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,320
If you want out...

352
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,390
you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

353
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,750
General alert.

354
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,880
Perfect.

355
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,150
Ladder on 18.

356
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,480
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

357
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,870
This way.

358
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,140
Lady, stay calm.

359
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,870
This is the police.

360
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,150
There's nowhere
else to go.

361
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,310
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

362
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,050
Do you understand?

363
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,790
She doesn't.

364
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,350
I think we need
a flying unit.

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,190
<i>This is the police.</i>

367
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,420
We are processing
your identification.

368
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,090
<i>Put your arms up</i>

369
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,440
She has no file.

370
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,050
She dove off.

371
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,460
<i>You just had an accident.</i>

372
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,630
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

373
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,410
<i>You have one point left</i>
<i>on your license.</i>

374
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,110
Look out!

375
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,480
Left!

376
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,090
I can't believe it.
Shit.

377
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,420
Any survivors?

378
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,420
Hi.

379
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,260
Are you okay?

380
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,030
Boom.

381
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,690
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."

382
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,860
Bada boom.

383
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,800
Big.

384
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,440
Big bada boom.

385
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,540
Big...

386
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,470
bada big boom.

387
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,980
Big boom.

388
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,550
Yeah, big bada boom.

389
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,880
Bada boom.

390
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,490
Big boom.
Big bada boom.

391
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,220
You're lucky you're not dead.

392
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,990
<i>This is a police control.</i>

393
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,990
<i>Please keep your hands</i>
<i>on the wheel.</i>

394
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,160
<i>You have an unauthorized passenger</i>

395
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,240
<i>We are going</i>

396
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,070
Thank you for cooperating.

397
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,670
Sorry, honey.

398
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,740
Looks like
this is your ride.

399
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,970
Open the door.

400
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,080
Do what they say.

401
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,410
Sorry.

402
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,200
"Please...

403
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,440
help."

404
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,280
I only have one point
left on my license.

405
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,150
I need it to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul.

406
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,710
You understand?

407
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,960
Can you please
open the passenger door?

408
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,050
Please...

409
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,460
help.

410
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,630
I can't.

411
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,740
<i>I repeat...</i>

412
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,540
open the passenger door.

413
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,410
Yeah, yeah, sure.

414
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,910
Why not?

415
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,830
Thank you
for your cooperation.

416
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,330
Help.

417
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,830
Finger's going
to kill me.

418
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,440
Emergency!
Emergency!

419
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,280
<i>One point has</i>
<i>been removed.</i>

420
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,520
Yes, I know!

421
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,620
This is so stupid.

422
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,190
<i>Assist in pursuit</i>
<i>of yellow cab.</i>

423
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,350
Unit 47,
we're on the way...

424
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,860
after we finish lunch.

425
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,790
Two golden menus.

426
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

427
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,970
Thank you so much.

428
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,880
And I'm definitely
too thirsty.

429
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,210
Look out!

430
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,980
We got lucky.

431
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,890
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

432
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,440
Maybe two miles.

433
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,800
Hang on.

434
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,840
Look, lady...

435
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,680
I only speak English
and bad English!

436
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,080
Run an I.D.

437
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,030
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

438
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,370
He's got a scan blocker.

439
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,270
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.

440
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,310
I don't know
what you did...

441
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,050
but they are pissed off!

442
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,140
Hold on!

443
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,470
We're safe for a while.

444
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,850
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

445
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,430
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

446
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,180
If we get to the fog,
we'll be okay.

447
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,340
If we make the fog.

448
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,300
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

449
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,870
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down if you don't mind.

450
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,890
Shit.

451
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,570
You okay?

452
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,840
Priest.

453
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,570
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

454
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,010
Vito Cornelius.

455
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,170
What?

456
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,180
Priest.

457
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,480
Yes?

458
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm looking
for a priest.

459
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,220
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.

460
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,560
She's not my bride.
She's my fare.

461
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,630
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.

462
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,690
The phone book
said he lived here.

463
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,900
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

464
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,670
Nobody does.
No file, no I.D., nothing.

465
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,900
She's got a tattoo
on this arm.

466
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,740
Tattoo?

467
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,080
Fifth...

468
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,760
element.

469
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,100
Finger's going
to kill me.

470
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,870
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

471
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,370
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

472
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,940
She just dropped in on me.

473
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,550
Started speaking
a bizarre language.

474
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,110
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

475
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,080
It's the ancient language...

476
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,320
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

477
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,220
He's a she.

478
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,760
You noticed that.

479
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,960
Yes.

480
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,570
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

481
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,500
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

482
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,400
But gently,
because this woman is...

483
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,970
mankind's most precious possession.

484
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,770
She is perfect.

485
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,810
Perfect.

486
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,160
More dignified.

487
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,890
Hey, lady...

488
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,290
wake up.

489
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,430
I shouldn't
have done that.

490
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,940
It was wrong
to kiss you.

491
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,770
He said
to wake you gently.

492
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,350
You're right.

493
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,790
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

494
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,510
Remember?

495
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,780
"Bada boom?"

496
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,450
"Big bada boom?"

497
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,520
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

498
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,190
I drive a cab.
This is me.

499
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,960
Korben Dallas.

500
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,300
Korben.
You understand?

501
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,860
Here.

502
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,030
Take it.

503
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,070
You can call me
when you learn English.

504
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,040
Just kidding.

505
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,970
What is your name?

506
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,650
You.

507
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,380
Korben.

508
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:58,050
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

509
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,150
Good.

510
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,160
All that's your name?

511
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,060
Do you have...

512
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,400
a shorter name?

513
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,670
Short.

514
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,070
Korben Dallas.

515
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,510
Leeloo.

516
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,850
Leeloo.

517
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,350
Korben, Leeloo.

518
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,350
Leeloo, Korben.

519
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,110
You're sure
she's a Supreme Being?

520
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,940
Absolutely sure.

521
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,550
Old friends.

522
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,040
Yeah, you're right.

523
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,050
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

524
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,550
Korben Dallas.

525
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,550
Thank you for your help.

526
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,560
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

527
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,760
She's been on
a long trip.

528
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,130
I know.
I was there when she landed.

529
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,620
Wait, wait, Father.

530
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,300
She said something
I didn't understand.

531
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,800
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?

532
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,300
"Never without my permission."

533
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,470
That's what I thought.

534
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,480
I shouldn't have
kissed her.

535
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,660
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.

536
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,600
How about some
nice Thai food?

537
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,760
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

538
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,340
<i>Buddy, I'm waiting</i>
<i>all day here.</i>

539
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,270
- Finger.
<i>- Where's the cab?</i>

540
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,340
Car's running fine.

541
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,270
<i>Fine. What "fine"?</i>

542
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:58,280
<i>I know you.</i>
<i>"Fine"ain't in your vocabulary.</i>

543
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,750
<i>You can tell your old buddy Finger</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

544
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,210
<i>What? You save the planet?</i>

545
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,950
<i>You dinged the fender again.</i>
<i>That's it, right?</i>

546
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,790
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

547
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,120
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

548
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,200
<i>How big?</i>

549
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,470
Five-nine...

550
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,310
blue eyes...

551
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,470
long legs, great skin.

552
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,540
You know?
Perfect.

553
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,370
<i>I see.</i>

554
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,380
<i>And this perfect fare,</i>
<i>she got a name?</i>

555
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,050
Leeloo.

556
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,830
What's she doing?

557
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,990
Learning our history,
the last 5,000 years that she missed.

558
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,830
She's been asleep
for a while.

559
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,250
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

560
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,510
You're right.

561
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,420
Chicken.

562
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,850
Good.

563
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,750
Chicken.

564
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,870
I'm really sorry
to interrupt you, but...

565
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,440
the case...

566
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,530
with the stones...

567
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,770
where is it?

568
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,380
Stolen?

569
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,610
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

570
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,620
Excuse me, sir.

571
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,860
The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

572
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,630
Is it possible
to fire 500,000?

573
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,240
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

574
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,240
Fire one million.

575
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,470
But 500,000...

576
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,580
One million.

577
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,740
Fine, sir.

578
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,910
Sorry to have
disturbed you.

579
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,000
It's for the Supreme...

580
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,430
Sorry.

581
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,830
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

582
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,760
You just put it like that.

583
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,270
Yes, there was
a man with a limp...

584
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:46,110
came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

585
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,770
Said he was an art dealer.

586
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,520
What was his name?

587
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,190
I'm bad with names.

588
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,960
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.

589
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,800
What'd she say?

590
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,900
<i>She says she knows</i>
<i>exactly where they are.</i>

591
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,320
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

592
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,480
Aknot, is that you?

593
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,320
What an ugly face.

594
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,820
It doesn't suit you.

595
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,150
Take it off.

596
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,660
That's better.

597
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,490
Never be ashamed
of who you are.

598
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,130
You're warriors.
Be proud.

599
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,830
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

600
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,100
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

601
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,110
Your time for revenge
is at hand.

602
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,770
The ZF-1.

603
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,940
It's light. The handle's adjustable
for easy carrying.

604
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,610
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

605
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,780
A word on fire power:

606
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,520
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip,
with bursts of 3 to 300.

607
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,530
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

608
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,790
One shot...

609
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,700
and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

610
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,150
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

611
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,870
Rocket launcher.

612
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,140
Arrow launcher...

613
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,220
with exploding
or poisonous heads.

614
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,820
Very practical.

615
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,260
Net launcher.

616
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,220
The flamethrower.

617
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,690
My favorite.

618
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,160
And for the grand finale...

619
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,740
the new Ice Cube System.

620
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,080
Four full crates...

621
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,740
delivered right on time.

622
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,840
And what about you,
dear Aknot?

623
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,580
Did you bring
what I asked?

624
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,590
Yes.

625
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,590
Magnificent.

626
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,930
This...

627
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,870
This case is empty.

628
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,540
Empty?

629
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,610
Empty...

630
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,440
the opposite of full.

631
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,940
This case
is supposed to be full!

632
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,110
Anyone care to explain?

633
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,390
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

634
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,620
Who took another route.

635
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,900
She's supposed
to contact this person...

636
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,630
in a hotel.

637
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,570
And she's looking
for the address.

638
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,800
Easy.

639
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,980
Dot.

640
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,260
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

641
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,420
We're saved.

642
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,750
I'm screwed.

643
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,260
You asked for a case.
We brought one.

644
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,830
A case with four stones
in it!

645
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,260
Not one or two or three,
but four!

646
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,660
Four stones!

647
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,670
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

648
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,000
We are warriors,
not merchants.

649
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,340
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.

650
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,950
Four stones, four crates.

651
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,020
Zero stones, zero crates!

652
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,120
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

653
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,780
We risked our lives.

654
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,860
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

655
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,130
So you are merchants
after all.

656
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,200
Leave him one crate
for the cause.

657
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,540
I don't like warriors.

658
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,010
Narrow-minded,
no subtlety...

659
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,380
and they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

660
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,380
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.

661
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,980
I'll tell you what I do like:
A killer.

662
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,650
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold-blooded, clean and methodical.

663
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,810
A real killer
picking up the ZF-1...

664
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,480
would've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

665
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,350
Bring me the priest.

666
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,410
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

667
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,040
and a blueprint
of the hotel.

668
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,480
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

669
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,250
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

670
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,760
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

671
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,370
There must be a way.

672
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,860
I'll get it.

673
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,830
Weddings?

674
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:18,550
Not really.

675
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,550
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?

676
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,380
Mr. Zorg.

677
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,940
<i>Jean-Baptiste...</i>

678
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,290
<i>Emmanuel...</i>

679
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,440
<i>Zorg.</i>

680
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,290
It's nice to see
you again, Father.

681
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,790
I remember you now.

682
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,890
The so-called art dealer.

683
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,130
I'm glad you got
your memory back.

684
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,130
Because you'll need it.

685
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,730
Where are the stones?

686
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,410
I don't know.

687
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,910
If I did, I wouldn't tell
someone like you.

688
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,410
Why?

689
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,480
What's wrong with me?

690
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,310
I try to serve life.

691
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,310
But you only...

692
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,090
want to destroy it.

693
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,420
Father...

694
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,160
you're so wrong.

695
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,490
Let me explain.

696
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:16,500
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction and chaos.

697
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,110
Take this empty glass.

698
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,110
Here it is, peaceful...

699
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,170
boring.

700
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,170
But if it is...

701
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,450
destroyed.

702
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,610
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

703
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,520
Notice how each is useful.

704
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,450
What a lovely ballet ensues...

705
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,290
so full of form and color.

706
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,860
Now think of all those people
that created them.

707
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,460
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

708
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,540
so those children can grow up
and have children...

709
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,040
and so on.

710
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,200
Thus adding
to the great chain...

711
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,200
of life.

712
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,410
<i>Water. Fruit.</i>

713
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,220
You see, Father,
by creating a little destruction...

714
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,560
I'm encouraging life.

715
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,000
In reality,
you and I are in the same business.

716
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,890
Cheers.

717
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,240
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

718
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,010
Or the engineer?

719
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,090
Or their children, maybe?

720
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,200
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

721
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,940
How your entire empire
of destruction comes...

722
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,440
crashing down...

723
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,950
all because of one, little...

724
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,780
cherry.

725
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,730
You saved my life...

726
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,130
and in return,
I'll spare yours...

727
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,890
for now.

728
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,900
You're a monster, Zorg.

729
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:32,970
I know.

730
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,910
Torture who you have to,
the President, I don't care.

731
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,080
Just bring me the stones.

732
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,910
You have one hour.

733
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,160
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

734
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,000
Why is it eating up
all the satellites?

735
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,940
We're working on it.

736
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:22,780
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

737
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,290
And the stones?
Did you find them?

738
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,450
They weren't on board.

739
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,790
What?

740
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,800
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

741
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,800
They gave them
to someone they do trust.

742
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,690
<i>Her name is Plavalaguna.</i>
<i>She's a diva.</i>

743
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,210
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

744
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,140
She has the stones.

745
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,650
<i>The Mondoshawans will help.</i>

746
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,470
We must send someone...

747
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,980
<i>to get the stones.</i>

748
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,210
Excellent.

749
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,350
I want this operation to be
as discreet as possible.

750
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,820
No troops.
No big operation.

751
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,550
I want your best man
to go undercover.

752
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,560
I have the perfect one.

753
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,160
You've got a message.

754
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,700
Not opening it?
Could be important.

755
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,200
Like the last two
were important.

756
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,970
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

757
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,040
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

758
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,220
That is bad luck.

759
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,550
Grandfather say...

760
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,160
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.

761
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,380
I bet you lunch.

762
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,820
Okay.

763
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,060
Come on.

764
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,730
"You are fired."

765
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

766
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,510
At least I won lunch.

767
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,010
Good philosophy.

768
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,910
See good in bad.
I like.

769
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,810
- Hello.
<i>- Korben, sweetheart.</i>

770
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,410
<i>You got broken fingers?</i>
<i>You can't punch my number?</i>

771
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,480
Hi, Mom.

772
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,680
<i>Seventeen messages.</i>

773
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,290
<i>Don't say your machine is broken again.</i>
<i>They last 1,000 years.</i>

774
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,950
Mr. Kim,
you should go.

775
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,930
This'll take a minute.

776
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,930
<i>You don't feed your cat a croquette,</i>
<i>who you love more than me.</i>

777
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,430
<i>She didn't breast-feed you.</i>
<i>I did.</i>

778
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,600
Good fortune for you.

779
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,710
You don't have a girl.
I'll never be a grandmother.

780
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,540
It bring you good luck!

781
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,120
<i>My body's failing.</i>
<i>Take me on this trip.</i>

782
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,620
What are you
talking about?

783
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,550
<i>You want to make me beg?</i>

784
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,280
No, all I want
is an explanation.

785
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,520
I just got in.

786
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,560
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.

787
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,160
Besides that,
everything's peachy.

788
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,970
Thanks for asking.

789
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,060
Now settle down
and explain this to me.

790
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,300
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>you won a trip...</i>

791
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,470
<i>to Fhloston Paradise for two</i>
<i>for ten days?</i>

792
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:00,310
<i>I suppose you'll just leave me</i>
<i>on the lunar surface?</i>

793
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,310
If I'd won a trip,
I'd know.

794
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,490
I would've been notified.

795
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,990
<i>They've been blaring your name out</i>
<i>on the radio for an hour.</i>

796
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,660
I'll call you back.

797
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,600
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

798
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,000
Nice apartment.

799
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,270
You've settled
into a wonderful life.

800
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,930
Heard you lost your job.

801
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,770
You heard that?

802
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,450
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.

803
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,680
Don't bother.
We have one for you.

804
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,290
"Major Dallas...

805
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,010
you've been selected
for a mission."

806
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,290
- What mission?
- To save the world.

807
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,960
"You leave
for Fhloston Paradise.

808
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,960
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

809
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,130
Any questions?

810
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,570
Why me? I retired
six months ago. Remember?

811
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,970
Three reasons.

812
01:00:58,370 --> 01:00:59,360
One:

813
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,300
As a member
of the Elite Special Forces Unit...

814
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,710
you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

815
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,380
Two: You're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

816
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,550
The third?

817
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,650
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.

818
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:15,890
Check your messages?

819
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,550
I've had enough good news.

820
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,220
Might be important.

821
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,050
<i>You're a winner!</i>

822
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:26,500
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

823
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,070
Here are your tickets.

824
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,240
You rigged the contest?

825
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,070
Congratulations.

826
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,410
You couldn't
be more discreet?

827
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,740
Old tricks are the best tricks.

828
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,680
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

829
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,020
I am not going.

830
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:51,520
Why not?

831
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,190
Excuse me, General.

832
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,430
Who is it?

833
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:08,600
Who is it?

834
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,380
My wife.

835
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,570
You remarried?

836
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,170
Yes... no. I just met this girl,
but I'm going to marry her.

837
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,220
I love her,
but she hates the military.

838
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,320
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

839
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,650
She can't have anything
to do with it.

840
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,210
If she sees you,
she'll kill me.

841
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,050
- Major...
- You gotta hide somewhere.

842
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,630
You've gotta help me.

843
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,960
We'd love to,
but where can we hide?

844
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,630
We don't
have time for this.

845
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,290
It's just for one minute.

846
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,560
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

847
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,800
No idea...
You have no idea.

848
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,310
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

849
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,680
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

850
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,480
Major!

851
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,220
You're on my foot.

852
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,680
Major! Major!

853
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:02,630
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace...

854
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,690
Dallas.

855
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:07,760
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

856
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,830
Is this the way
priests vacation?

857
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,670
We're on a mission.

858
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,100
What kind?

859
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:15,970
We have to save
the world, my son.

860
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,110
You're gonna
save the world?

861
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,940
Yes!

862
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,610
Down there.
Down there.

863
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,020
<i>This is a police control.</i>

864
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,860
<i>This is not an exercise.</i>

865
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,570
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

866
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,640
Just stay here
for one minute.

867
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,800
<i>- This is a police control.</i>
- Don't touch anything.

868
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,540
<i>This is not an exercise.</i>

869
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,280
<i>Can you please spread your legs...</i>

870
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,290
<i>and place your hands</i>
<i>in the yellow circles.</i>

871
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,720
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

872
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,120
Yeah, but I...

873
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,160
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

874
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,490
Let's see it.

875
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,900
<i>Are you classified</i>
<i>as human?</i>

876
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:16,730
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.

877
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,700
I found him.

878
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,730
Mr. Korben Dallas?

879
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,170
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

880
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,080
Smoke you!

881
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,680
Wrong answer.

882
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,190
<i>The police control</i>
<i>is now terminated.</i>

883
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,590
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

884
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,600
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy but we bagged him.

885
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:50,100
<i>- Thanks for the tip.</i>
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

886
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,440
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

887
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:57,870
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

888
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,540
and I'll be in Fhloston
in four hours.

889
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,280
Don't come back
without the stones.

890
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,300
We got Korben Dallas.

891
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:23,560
Perfect.

892
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,800
Akanit, take command.

893
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,900
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.

894
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,910
If Zorg really wants them...

895
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,240
he'll have to negotiate.

896
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,980
Revenge is at hand.

897
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,590
Oh, I am so sorry.

898
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,660
I forgot
about the autowash.

899
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,090
There's an autowash
in that shower.

900
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,660
I'm so sorry.

901
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,160
Autowash.

902
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,170
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

903
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,330
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.

904
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:05,500
Both times
you've ended up in my arms.

905
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,950
It's my lucky day.

906
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,740
Lucky day.

907
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,630
Did you hear something?

908
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,030
Cornelius.

909
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,370
Autowash.

910
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,130
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

911
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,650
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

912
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,680
Autowash.

913
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,650
Coffee's not my specialty.

914
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,150
But you must drink a lot
of coffee being a priest.

915
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:01,900
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

916
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,740
I'll take the mission.

917
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,530
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

918
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,830
Good.

919
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,500
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

920
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,370
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.

921
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,370
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.

922
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,280
Now David is...

923
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,080
in great shape.
He'll protect you.

924
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:56,390
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

925
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,960
Now. Yes.

926
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,520
Okay.

927
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:07,560
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.

928
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,460
The tickets.

929
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,170
- I.D., please.
- I'm sorry.

930
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,540
- There.
- In here?

931
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,040
Mr. Dallas?

932
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,310
Congratulations on the contest.

933
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,220
Oh, right. Okay.

934
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,020
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

935
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,320
The garbage.

936
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,550
Made it!

937
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:40,230
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it...

938
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,670
so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

939
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,830
Now David must go.

940
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:46,840
Thank you. Bye.

941
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,730
I am Korben Dallas.

942
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:53,440
<i>Please report infractions</i>
<i>immediately to the spaceport.</i>

943
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,010
And this is?

944
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,350
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.

945
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,350
Multi-pass.

946
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,250
She knows
it's a multi-pass.

947
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,350
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.

948
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:09,190
Bump into each other, sparks happen...
She knows.

949
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,850
Anyway, we're in love.

950
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:15,200
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

951
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:18,700
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

952
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,150
<i>- You want more?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

953
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:29,710
Make that two.

954
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,720
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

955
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,120
What!

956
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,880
I didn't know
what to do.

957
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,720
But this is not possible.

958
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,790
This is not possible.

959
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,300
<i>You want some more?</i>

960
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,800
This is all my fault.

961
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,300
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

962
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,460
I know.

963
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,240
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

964
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:56,310
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.

965
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,570
I don't want
to go to Egypt.

966
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,480
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?

967
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,750
That's me.

968
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,920
Just a minute, please.

969
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,930
It will just take
one more minute.

970
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,940
We'll be right back.

971
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,180
Mr. Dallas...

972
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,120
we really need you now.

973
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:42,450
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and needs to interview you.

974
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,850
Multi-pass.

975
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,860
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

976
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,460
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.

977
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,710
Backup unit, zone 18.

978
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,890
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.

979
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,000
He's so green.

980
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,360
I'm sure you're excited.

981
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,520
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

982
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,660
I prefer to remain anonymous.

983
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,000
Korben Dallas!

984
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:39,410
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

985
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:43,350
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

986
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,080
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

987
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,020
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

988
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:53,420
Right on.

989
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,690
And he's got
something to say...

990
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,260
to those 50 billion pairs of ears
out there.

991
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:00,090
Pop it, D-man.

992
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,090
Hi.

993
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,530
Unbelievable.

994
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,710
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.

995
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,210
Right here
from five to seven.

996
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:17,940
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

997
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,550
His dreams...

998
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,050
his desires...

999
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,950
his most intimates of intimates.

1000
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,960
And from what I'm looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

1001
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,960
So tell me, my man...

1002
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,560
you nervous in the service?

1003
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,060
Not really.

1004
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:39,400
Freeze those knees 'cause Korben's
in the place and he's on the case.

1005
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:43,480
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's Prince...

1006
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,910
of Fhloston Paradise!

1007
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,240
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

1008
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,910
A magic fountain flowing
with nonstop wine, women and...

1009
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,820
hootchie-kootchie-koo...

1010
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,580
all night long.

1011
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,820
<i>All night long</i>
<i>All night</i>

1012
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:09,490
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

1013
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:12,660
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.

1014
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,110
On the trail of the sexiest
man of the year: D-man, your man...

1015
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,600
my man.

1016
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,610
<i>End of transmission.</i>

1017
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:26,520
See you tomorrow at five.

1018
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,810
How was it?

1019
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,680
It was just absolutely green.

1020
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,290
Green like what?

1021
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,530
Crystal green.

1022
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,690
Any kind of green
you want...

1023
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,770
tree green, emerald,
pond green.

1024
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,750
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

1025
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,480
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

1026
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,080
It must pop, pop, pop!

1027
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,650
So tomorrow, from five to seven...

1028
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:10,090
please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

1029
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,160
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

1030
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:16,500
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

1031
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:19,900
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

1032
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:23,010
Tomorrow, from five to seven,
you'll give yourself a hand.

1033
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,410
Green?

1034
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,840
Super green.

1035
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,510
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

1036
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,910
That's me.

1037
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,250
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

1038
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:42,430
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

1039
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,360
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.

1040
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:48,260
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

1041
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,370
I need to talk
to someone!

1042
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,270
I don't believe this!

1043
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,540
<i>This is not an exercise.</i>
<i>This is a police control.</i>

1044
01:14:57,710 --> 01:14:59,870
I'm sorry. I'm calm.

1045
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,210
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

1046
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,850
To make your flight short...

1047
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:07,120
flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

1048
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:10,250
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

1049
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,760
Thank you.

1050
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,170
Hi.

1051
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:23,000
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.

1052
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,300
Good.

1053
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,940
We are not on vacation.

1054
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:30,600
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

1055
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:33,770
If I hadn't come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

1056
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,010
Understand?

1057
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:36,280
Yes.

1058
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,440
But you, no trouble.

1059
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,680
Me, Fifth Element.

1060
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,360
Supreme Being.

1061
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,290
Me protect you.

1062
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,790
Sleep.

1063
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,800
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.

1064
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,370
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

1065
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,530
Thank you.

1066
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,870
Are you operative?

1067
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,810
<i>Zone two?</i>

1068
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,210
Everything's ready, Captain.

1069
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,310
What?

1070
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:13,540
Assume your
individual position.

1071
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,550
But I want all positions!

1072
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,150
Mr. Rhod...

1073
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,420
Parasites in landing gear.

1074
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,550
Ground, copy?

1075
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:24,290
Got it.
Front gear.

1076
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,160
Hey, man,
give me some heat, man!

1077
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:31,000
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!

1078
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,340
Some heat over here, man!

1079
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,670
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!

1080
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,850
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

1081
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:00,100
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

1082
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,530
Take that.

1083
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,110
Mr. Rhod!

1084
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,040
You can call me Ruby.

1085
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:13,270
Fueled and ready to go.

1086
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,780
I'll buy you one.

1087
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,720
Taken off already?

1088
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,050
I'm not on the plane.

1089
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,560
What?

1090
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:26,450
The real Dallas
took my place.

1091
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,060
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1092
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,720
Are you making fun of me?

1093
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,060
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!

1094
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,290
I never felt this way before
with a human.

1095
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,460
Really?

1096
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,470
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.

1097
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,640
Ground is clear.

1098
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,410
Ready for liftoff?

1099
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,820
Confirmed.

1100
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,490
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

1101
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,330
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

1102
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,460
- Protection?
- Confirmed

1103
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,660
Power increase.

1104
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:14,940
Ten seconds.

1105
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,600
I am...

1106
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,510
a little...

1107
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,610
disappointed.

1108
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,440
5...

1109
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,180
If there is one thing
I do not like...

1110
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,010
3...

1111
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,780
it is to be...

1112
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:27,610
2...

1113
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:29,780
disappointed.

1114
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,620
1...

1115
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,780
Sorry, it will
never happen again.

1116
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,130
I know.

1117
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,280
Liftoff.

1118
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:49,870
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.

1119
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,330
We're finally
getting something.

1120
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,840
It's sending
radio wavelengths.

1121
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,730
What does it want
with radio waves?

1122
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,010
Maybe it wants
to make a call.

1123
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,840
Zorg's office.

1124
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,250
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

1125
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:37,520
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1126
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,420
and Mr. Shadow's
on the line.

1127
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,360
<i>It's Shadow again.</i>

1128
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,260
Zorg here.

1129
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,770
<i>Am I disturbing you?</i>

1130
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:58,210
No, no, I was just...

1131
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:01,780
Where are you?

1132
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,710
<i>Not far now.</i>

1133
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,280
Good.

1134
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,390
Good, good.

1135
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,990
<i>How are the stones?</i>

1136
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,720
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.

1137
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:21,900
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

1138
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,800
but it wasn't easy.

1139
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,410
My costs have tripled.

1140
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:30,400
<i>Money is of no...</i>

1141
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:33,080
<i>importance.</i>

1142
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:34,900
<i>I...</i>

1143
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:36,380
<i>want...</i>

1144
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:39,640
<i>the stones.</i>

1145
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,210
The stones...

1146
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,250
will be here.

1147
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,990
I'll see to it
personally.

1148
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,600
<i>I will be among you...</i>

1149
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,600
<i>soon.</i>

1150
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,430
We lost it.

1151
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,170
We lost the signal.

1152
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,330
Damn!

1153
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,520
<i>We've begun our descent</i>
<i>toward Fhloston Paradise.</i>

1154
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,690
<i>The local time</i>
<i>is 3:20 p.m.</i>

1155
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:28,630
<i>Auto-temperature is currently</i>
<i>85 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

1156
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,700
<i>We hope you enjoyed your flight</i>
<i>and hope to see you again soon.</i>

1157
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,720
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to paradise.</i>

1158
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,170
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

1159
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,710
Parasites in the main ventilation.

1160
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,610
Again?
I'll get it.

1161
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:57,290
Have we arrived yet?

1162
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,230
Oh, good.

1163
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,720
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1164
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,960
All the restaurants
are between levels two and ten.

1165
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:11,230
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p. M...

1166
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,130
then the airship goes higher...

1167
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:14,900
to offer you a better view.

1168
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,400
Is the Diva here?

1169
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,740
Not yet.

1170
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,470
Any tickets left
for the opera?

1171
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,410
You have a seat reserved,
front row...

1172
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,640
next to Ruby Rhod!

1173
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,910
He's so talented.
I love him. He's so sexy.

1174
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,490
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

1175
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,980
Where can I get
something to wear?

1176
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,230
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1177
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:52,440
<i>You miserable bastard,</i>
<i>I never should've pushed you out.</i>

1178
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,510
<i>I was in labor for days,</i>
<i>and this is how you repay me?</i>

1179
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,280
<i>I should've gotten</i>
<i>a robot.</i>

1180
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,050
Come on, Ma.

1181
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:01,510
<i>I should be there, not you.</i>
<i>I need a tan.</i>

1182
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,280
<i>I need a cocktail.</i>

1183
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,310
Get the case in.

1184
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,080
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.

1185
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:36,590
Welcome to the...
I'm security.

1186
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,590
Welcome to the...

1187
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:40,020
Tall.

1188
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,610
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

1189
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,680
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1190
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:08,180
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you are here.

1191
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,350
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1192
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:12,450
Stay here.

1193
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:18,960
<i>You're listening to Radio Cosmos.</i>
<i>It is 5 p.m.</i>

1194
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,130
Helm to 108.

1195
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,140
Helm 108!

1196
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,470
Helm to 108.

1197
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:29,140
<i>Time to join Ruby Rhod...</i>

1198
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:33,210
<i>and Korben Dallas,</i>
<i>the lucky winner...</i>

1199
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,810
<i>of the Gemini Croquette contest.</i>

1200
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,150
<i>Coming at you live</i>
<i>from Fhloston...</i>

1201
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:40,710
Paradise!

1202
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:45,720
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

1203
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,730
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1204
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,990
and 8,000 other lucksters here...

1205
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:56,000
to enjoy the privilege of
the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1206
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:01,670
Now we enter what must be...

1207
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,500
the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

1208
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:08,740
A perfect replica
of an old opera house...

1209
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,910
but who cares?

1210
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,690
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1211
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:18,420
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1212
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,360
He's not going to get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

1213
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,700
To who?

1214
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,700
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1215
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:31,430
The Emperor of KodarJaphet
and his lovely daughter.

1216
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:34,770
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1217
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:38,280
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1218
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,310
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

1219
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,180
for Korben to say
the word of the day.

1220
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:49,720
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

1221
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:53,630
Thrilled.

1222
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:56,490
And now...

1223
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,550
champagne!

1224
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,970
Commercial!
Commercial!

1225
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,800
<i>Break for 30 seconds.</i>

1226
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:25,760
Show time.

1227
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,700
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

1228
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,710
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

1229
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:28,050
<i>- Permission granted for one hour.</i>
- More than I need.

1230
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,220
Champagne for the Diva.

1231
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:47,060
I'll take it.

1232
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:23,260
I found it.

1233
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,130
Get her!

1234
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:34,730
It was an ambush.

1235
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,240
If it's war they want...

1236
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:42,570
it's war they'll get!

1237
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:47,480
Bravo! Bravo!

1238
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,740
Bravo! Bravo!

1239
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,580
My compliments, little lady.

1240
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,140
Thank you for doing
the dirty work.

1241
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:56,190
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

1242
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,090
Hand over the stones.

1243
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:40,700
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

1244
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:46,140
Hands up!

1245
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,600
I know this music.

1246
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:01,040
Let's change the beat.

1247
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,680
I think we're
being attacked.

1248
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,190
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

1249
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,450
<i>I see one of them.</i>
<i>They're warriors, and they're ugly.</i>

1250
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:17,890
<i>They got big teeth, and they got</i>
<i>big foreheads, and they stink.</i>

1251
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,950
Mangalores.

1252
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:24,200
The government
sent me to help you.

1253
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:26,000
If somebody hears this,
come and get me.

1254
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:28,540
I'm in the first row.

1255
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,200
You must give her the stones.

1256
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,300
Who?

1257
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,040
The Fifth Element.

1258
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:39,650
The Supreme Being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1259
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:40,810
Leeloo?

1260
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,560
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

1261
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:49,150
She needs your help...

1262
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,160
and your love...

1263
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,060
or...

1264
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,560
she will die.

1265
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,830
Stay with me.

1266
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:02,240
Help!

1267
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,580
If you want
something done...

1268
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,680
do it yourself.

1269
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,410
Come on, honey.
You can't die.

1270
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,750
Wake up!
Where are the stones?

1271
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,250
Where are the stones?

1272
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,590
The stones.

1273
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:39,210
They're not here.

1274
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:41,610
The stones,
where are they?

1275
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:45,270
In me.

1276
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:46,610
What?

1277
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:55,120
Oh, my God, Korben.

1278
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,960
Korben, another one coming.

1279
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:59,830
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

1280
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,890
Hey, you!

1281
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:03,960
I said you.

1282
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:05,900
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?

1283
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,400
I said, "one minute."

1284
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:12,140
Ruby, hold this gun.

1285
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,800
What do you
want me to do?

1286
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,900
Come on.

1287
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:16,510
Put your hand
on it.

1288
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:18,980
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.

1289
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:21,590
I don't feel right.

1290
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:25,090
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

1291
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:37,000
I got a headache.
This ain't me.

1292
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,680
Sorry.

1293
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,120
Think he'll be okay?

1294
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,130
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1295
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,540
Shit. Three coming.

1296
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:18,540
You guard this
with your life...

1297
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,700
or you'll look like him.
You green?

1298
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,870
Green.

1299
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:23,310
<i>Super green?</i>

1300
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,880
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

1301
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:29,890
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1302
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,740
Move! Move!

1303
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:01,980
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1304
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:03,180
Ladies and gentlemen...

1305
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,850
this is amazing.

1306
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:08,520
Let me do it.

1307
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:16,860
Oh, my God.

1308
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,060
Korben Dallas, my man,
is in trouble.

1309
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:26,930
The gun!

1310
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:30,720
Give me the gun.

1311
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,040
I'm going to go...

1312
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:36,450
and try to see if I can see
something a little closer.

1313
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:54,800
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1314
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,110
Thanks, Ray.

1315
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:09,750
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

1316
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,910
Get up!

1317
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:13,490
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

1318
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,990
I'm not armed.

1319
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:19,650
Oh, my God.

1320
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:21,460
I'm on vacation.

1321
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,930
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.

1322
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,100
I won a...

1323
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,000
contest.

1324
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:30,170
Gemini Croquette's to...

1325
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,780
Fhloston Paradise.

1326
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,970
Down.

1327
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,680
Wait a minute.

1328
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:40,080
Get down!

1329
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:43,320
He's trying
to say something.

1330
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:44,320
Down!

1331
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:00,030
Sorry, my man.

1332
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,710
Where are you?

1333
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:14,380
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1334
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,050
They're coming.
They're coming.

1335
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:22,150
Don't move.

1336
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:34,500
What you doing?

1337
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:36,230
Count to ten.

1338
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:47,020
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

1339
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,520
3! 4! 5!

1340
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:50,750
6...

1341
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:51,910
7, 8...

1342
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:54,420
9...

1343
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,880
10.

1344
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,290
I am...

1345
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,790
very disappointed.

1346
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,630
Korben, what are you
looking for?

1347
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,960
Control room.

1348
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,460
- This is it.
- I'll be here.

1349
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:38,940
Let's go.

1350
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,970
Quiet! Quiet!

1351
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,810
You in charge?

1352
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,470
How many
are out there?

1353
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,240
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1354
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,810
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

1355
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,250
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

1356
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:10,300
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

1357
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:13,270
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

1358
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:15,500
That's the leader.

1359
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,510
Send someone to negotiate.

1360
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,010
I've never negotiated.

1361
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,180
You mind if I try?

1362
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,780
We're sending
somebody to negotiate.

1363
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:39,790
Anybody else
want to negotiate?

1364
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:42,630
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1365
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:44,470
I wonder.

1366
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:50,340
Where's Ruby?

1367
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,800
I thought he was dead.

1368
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:53,970
Master!

1369
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:57,210
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

1370
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:00,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1371
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,820
still alive.

1372
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,890
What's wrong with you?

1373
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,220
It hurt!

1374
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:15,000
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1375
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:17,570
but I'm fighting
for a noble cause.

1376
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:20,570
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1377
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:23,070
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.

1378
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,330
Leeloo's in trouble?

1379
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:26,570
When is Leeloo
not in trouble?

1380
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,570
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.

1381
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:35,080
Hang on.

1382
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,720
Here, come on.

1383
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,750
How do you get yourself
into these positions?

1384
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,190
Come on.

1385
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:50,430
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.

1386
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:51,930
Listen.

1387
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,530
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

1388
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:04,110
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

1389
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:15,790
If it was a bomb...

1390
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:20,230
the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

1391
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:24,900
<i>This is a type "A"alert.</i>

1392
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:28,070
<i>For security reasons,</i>
<i>the hotel must be evacuated.</i>

1393
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:30,970
<i>Proceed calmly</i>
<i>to the lifeboats...</i>

1394
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:32,630
Stay calm!

1395
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:34,300
<i>... located in the main hallways.</i>

1396
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:35,640
Stay calm!

1397
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,980
You know how to stop this,
right?

1398
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:53,000
<i>Two minutes</i>
<i>to complete evacuation.</i>

1399
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,990
Get back!

1400
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:57,830
Evacuation!
Evacuation!

1401
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,340
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

1402
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,440
I know.

1403
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:23,860
I don't want to die.

1404
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:25,190
Please, my son.

1405
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:27,160
Get in.

1406
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,730
<i>One minute to total evacuation.</i>

1407
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:40,500
This one.

1408
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,750
<i>45 seconds.</i>

1409
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,580
Get her strapped in.

1410
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,360
You know how to fly this?

1411
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:59,760
Like driving a cab.

1412
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,370
How will we
get out the door?

1413
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:21,720
<i>15 seconds.</i>

1414
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,620
<i>10...</i>

1415
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,280
<i>9, 8...</i>

1416
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,620
7...

1417
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,400
<i>6...</i>

1418
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:34,620
<i>5.</i>

1419
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,320
For the honor.

1420
01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:00,310
Hold on.

1421
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:23,940
Like driving a cab.

1422
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:28,610
It is now 7 p.m.,
time for the news.

1423
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:30,690
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1424
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,780
<i>End of transmission.</i>

1425
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,680
That's the best show
I ever did.

1426
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:41,360
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1427
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:44,300
and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

1428
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:50,210
We're saved.

1429
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:09,050
The Diva said
I should take care of you.

1430
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:12,720
Humans act so strange.

1431
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,060
What do you mean?

1432
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,830
Everything you created...

1433
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,600
is used to destroy.

1434
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,330
We call it human nature.

1435
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:25,500
You learn that
on your screen?

1436
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,510
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."

1437
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:30,680
"V" is good.

1438
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,020
Some good words in "V."

1439
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:34,420
Like what?

1440
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:38,090
"Valiant."

1441
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:39,920
"Vulnerable."

1442
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,020
"Very beautiful."

1443
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:58,270
Oh, of course, Munro!

1444
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:00,700
Mr. President?

1445
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:02,110
Now what?

1446
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:06,880
We have a problem.

1447
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:13,720
It's advancing?

1448
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:17,450
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

1449
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:25,300
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1450
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,080
Korben, there's
a general on the phone.

1451
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,470
I'll give you
the President.

1452
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:41,650
Major Dallas, I first
would like to salute a warrior.

1453
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:44,250
<i>You're a shining example</i>
<i>of this army.</i>

1454
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:46,190
<i>In the name</i>
<i>of the Federation...</i>

1455
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,320
Any idea when you'll
get to the point?

1456
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,490
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
heading straight for earth...

1457
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:59,000
<i>and we have no idea how to stop it.</i>
<i>That's the problem.</i>

1458
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:03,830
How much time do we have?

1459
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,340
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1460
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:11,440
I'll call you back
in two hours.

1461
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,780
Hello?

1462
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:26,160
They just landed
in the desert.

1463
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:30,120
Good job, David.

1464
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,030
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

1465
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:43,610
You got it figured out, Father?

1466
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:46,300
This one should be fire.

1467
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:48,710
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

1468
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:52,040
The four stones
should go around.

1469
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:54,310
The Fifth Element should be
in the middle...

1470
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:57,220
and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1471
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:59,980
You've never seen this work?

1472
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:01,210
Give me that.

1473
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:04,830
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

1474
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:14,330
That's it.
That's it.

1475
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:15,940
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!

1476
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:18,670
Wind.

1477
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,570
My man, what you doing?

1478
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:24,670
- What?
- What you doing?

1479
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:27,680
Trying to keep you
in the D.J. Business.

1480
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:32,410
Fire.

1481
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:35,030
Done.

1482
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:36,250
What happens?

1483
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:39,020
So, now,
we have to open them.

1484
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:42,120
And you know how to do that.
Right?

1485
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,530
Theoretically...

1486
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:46,360
No.

1487
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:52,870
Leeloo, honey, wake up.

1488
01:53:53,050 --> 01:53:54,270
You have to help us.

1489
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:56,950
How do you open the stones?

1490
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:00,120
Wind blows.

1491
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:03,210
Fire burns.

1492
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:06,720
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1493
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:08,290
Rain...

1494
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:13,130
falls.

1495
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:21,000
What does it mean?

1496
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:24,140
I think that...

1497
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:25,470
Maybe it's a charade.

1498
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:27,140
A game or something.

1499
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:30,070
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

1500
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,810
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1501
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:45,760
Too late.

1502
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,160
We've lost contact with them.

1503
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:50,670
Three minutes.

1504
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:53,500
I think mine is broken.

1505
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:55,160
Why I gotta get
the broke one?

1506
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:05,340
We're never gonna make it.

1507
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,850
It moved.

1508
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:16,520
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

1509
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:18,190
Shut up, shut up!

1510
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,390
Show me what you did,
step-by-step.

1511
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:23,800
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.

1512
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:28,200
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said...

1513
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:30,630
"We're not going to make it."

1514
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:33,970
And that's it?

1515
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,050
Korben, my man.

1516
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:45,710
Wind.

1517
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,890
She said, "Wind blows."

1518
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,330
Everyone take a stone.

1519
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:01,570
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

1520
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:05,170
Earth.

1521
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:06,900
Open the other one.

1522
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:25,200
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.

1523
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,530
I have no matches.
Do you have any?

1524
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:30,100
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?

1525
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:32,930
Got some matches?
We need some fire.

1526
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:35,930
We're going to die.

1527
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:44,610
Don't breathe.

1528
01:57:03,970 --> 01:57:04,960
Fire.

1529
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:06,800
One minute.

1530
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:08,570
Let's go, Leeloo.

1531
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,730
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1532
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,970
Protect life...

1533
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,480
until death.

1534
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:17,810
Listen to me!

1535
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:19,470
Listen to me.

1536
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:22,310
Listen,
I know you're very tired.

1537
01:57:22,490 --> 01:57:26,220
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

1538
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:28,080
But if you don't
do something right now...

1539
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:29,820
we'll all die.

1540
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,660
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1541
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,660
It'll enter the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1542
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,660
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

1543
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,000
There are some things...

1544
01:57:42,170 --> 01:57:44,510
very nice things worth saving;
beautiful things.

1545
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,770
Beautiful things.

1546
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:49,340
Like love?

1547
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:51,540
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.

1548
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:54,020
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.

1549
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:56,720
I don't know love.

1550
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:00,050
I don't know love.

1551
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:02,560
I was built to protect,
not love.

1552
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:05,560
So there's no use for me
other than this.

1553
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:07,720
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1554
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:10,060
I need you.

1555
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:11,900
I need you,
very much.

1556
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,800
Why?

1557
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:18,070
Because...

1558
01:58:18,410 --> 01:58:19,810
because...

1559
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:22,740
Tell her, Korben.

1560
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:26,070
Tell me.

1561
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,240
Please.

1562
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:29,310
Why you need me?

1563
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:31,250
Because...

1564
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:32,920
Tell me.

1565
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:36,530
- Tell me.
- Because I...

1566
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,250
Because I love you.

1567
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,830
I love you.

1568
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:45,690
10...

1569
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:46,760
9...

1570
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:47,930
8...

1571
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:49,000
7...

1572
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:50,770
6, 5...

1573
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:52,940
4, 3...

1574
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:54,330
<i>2...</i>

1575
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,670
1.

1576
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:37,880
<i>Scanner imaging has confirmed</i>
<i>the dark planet dead.</i>

1577
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,320
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

1578
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:56,400
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?

1579
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:59,070
Every five minutes
it's a bomb or something.

1580
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:00,580
I'm leaving.

1581
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:16,490
Mr. President.

1582
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:19,330
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the center.

1583
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,330
It's an honor, Mr. President.

1584
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,200
Where are my two heroes?

1585
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:27,100
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

1586
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:29,170
I have 19 meetings after this.

1587
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:31,780
Let me see
if they're revived.

1588
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:33,000
Thank you.

1589
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,610
We go live in one minute.

1590
02:00:43,690 --> 02:00:44,780
They're...

1591
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:47,690
not ready.

1592
02:00:48,690 --> 02:00:49,790
They need...

1593
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,190
five more minutes.

1594
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,690
You have 20 seconds.

1595
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:55,030
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.

1596
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,190
Who's that?

1597
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:58,030
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.

1598
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,360
Give it here.

1599
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:03,200
Mrs. Dallas,
this is the President.

1600
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,210
On behalf
of the Federation...

1601
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:07,210
<i>That doesn't</i>
<i>even sound like him.</i>

1602
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:09,810
<i>The President's an idiot.</i>
<i>You don't sound like an idiot.</i>

1603
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:11,510
<i>If you don't want to talk</i>
<i>to your mother...</i>
